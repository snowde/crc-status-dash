P S.,"Waianae, HI",115,71,34,5.0,1/4/2018,"You know how we have ONE chance to make a first impression?  On Thursday afternoon I called this location to inquire about the advertised TV rib/chicken special.  Gladys answered the phone and I could 'feel' her smile as she talked to me.  Warm, welcoming, and professional. We came in around 2 pm and were seated in Kahner's station...a most delightful young man who was personable without being overbearing, efficient and cared about our meal and it's timing.    I watched the other crew members as they interacted with diners and with other staff...smiles, laughter, teamwork. (I'm a retired JCP trainer, I notice this stuff) Kahner was asked to clear an area and he respectfully agreed 'once I have taken care of my people' Obviously CUSTOMER SERVICE comes first!!  WOW!   First visit to our island Applebee's and it won't be our last.  THIS place, these people GET it.  From first impression to walking out the door with numerous 'thank you's'  from waiter, hostess, other staff members. They GET it.     And that rib special???  Oh heavens!!  Treat yourself!"
Maloury M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",60,8,2,3.0,1/8/2018,"Came in on Thursday for dinner, party of 3. Service was good. Wait time for food was kinda long. Nearby tables were not cleaned for at least 15 minutes after people left (not sure when our neighboring tables were cleaned because they were still full when we left). Must be short on bussers that night.  Ordered the AYCE chicken tender special, only got the chicken and fries. Had to ask for sauce and no coleslaw like the picture shows.  Didn't notify the server(My fault I know, I was starving and didn't wanna cause a fuss or wait any longer for food).  Overall, We'll give then another try in the future. The prices are not bad (our food actually came out fresher then other reviewers,  Not super greasy or cold).  We like having another dining option nearby. Fingers crossed that things get better."
Sally D.,"Mililani, HI",0,3,,1.0,1/7/2018,"ONE (1) star!!!  They didn't call us even though we were in the restaurant, seated right across the hostess!!   Waited over 45 minutes with parties checking in after us, seated already!  Gave us a 2 seater where the 2 men on either side took all the room so we could barely breathe.  To their credit, they were accommodating when we asked to move to a nearby booth.  Took another 8 minutes to even have the waitress check on us.   Food is classic Applebee's.  No comments."
Dawn R.,"Honolulu, HI",80,47,9,2.0,1/6/2018,"Went with a friend for lunch here a couple weeks after they opened.  Based on that first impression, I probably will not be back.   We waited until a few minutes past opening for them to actually open the doors and let people start coming in.  The floors were slippery when we did walk through the restaurant to our table.  Waiter took our order and came back a few minutes later and told us the grill was broken so I couldn't have what I ordered.  Told me nothing could be grills, so no chicken, burgers or steaks.  That didn't leave me many gluten free options, so I ordered a salad.   While we were waiting for our food to arrive, a burger came out from the back.  We called the waiter over and asked if the grill was fixed.  No was his response.  Pointed out the burger and he walked away to look into it.  Came back to let us know it could be cooked on the flat top, but still no chicken or steaks.  I ordered the caprese burger to go with my tiny salad. Burger came and it was ground beef, loads of garlic mixed in, and falling apart.  There was a slice of tomato and a small piece of mozzarella cheese on top.  No basil, no balsamic.  At this point, my friend was done her meal, so I just ate what I had while we waited for the check.   I was extremely disappointed in the meal as a whole.  I probably will not go back to Applebee's, which is a disappointment.  I like visiting them on the mainland, so I was thrilled when this location opened close to my home."
Diana L.,"Honolulu, HI",318,195,320,2.0,1/3/2018,"First time. And probably last time. I've heard about this place, but never had any real desire to dine here, but my husband insisted that we checked them out while running errands at Pearlridge Mall. This Applebee's is located inside the mall at Pearlridge Uptown. It is on the first floor on the side closer to TJ Maxx. You can't miss it. Tons of parking. We arrived here a little past the lunch hour and waited a bit to be seated. They're understaffed right now, so understandable.  Eventually we were seated and our waitress came by to get our drink orders. Don't get me wrong: the staff is very friendly, though they seem a bit inefficient. Not sure if it's due to the understaffing or the newness of the place. Got our menus but no share plates, no napkins, and no utensils. No biggie.  As for the food - this is where my un-satisfaction comes from. My husband and I opted for the ""Build Your Own Appetizer."" We went with the three choice option for $16.99: Spinach and Artichoke Dip, Chicken Wonton Tacos (which comes with 3), and the Boneless Wings. As for my entree, I ordered the Caprese Mozzerella Chicken and my husband ordered the Double Crunch Shrimp plate. So, let's begin the review: Spinach and Artichoke Dip: The chips were a bit too oily for me, but the dip was actually pretty good. Some bits of chunky artichoke in there, and well seasoned. It came out warm enough for me to enjoy with the chips. Chicken Wonton Tacos: Disappointing. You get that Thai tangy chili sauce in the taco, little chunks of chicken, slaw and cilantro mix in a wonton shell. The shell was a bit oily, but edible. But, I was not impressed. Boneless Wings: We opted for the Classic Buffalo Sauce. The plate came out cold and the food at room temperature. You can either choose Ranch or Bleu Cheese. We asked for both and got Ranch. It also comes with celery sticks, if you're wondering. Caprese Mozzerella Chicken: I was pretty excited about this, but was sorely disappointed. The mashed potatoes were meh. The chicken was cooked well but also meh. All-in-all, I was not impressed. If you've ever noticed the temperature of your dish at the end of your dinner, well, that's how it was when I got my plate. Room temperature. Like it was sitting for a bit.  Double Crunch Shrimp: Well, I didn't try this. But my husband had two pieces of his shrimp and a couple pieces of his fries and the he stopped eating it. He was not pleased. He did enjoy the slaw though. If you're a slaw lover like he is, he recommends the cole slaw. I imagine my dish would be a little better had it come out warm and fresh, rather than tasting like it had been sitting out in the kitchen for a bit before being brought out to me. I'm not super picky, but when every single dish that comes out is at room temperature when it should actually come out, at the very least, warm, is not acceptable. Might possibly be a one-time thing. Might not be. I'm sure there are die-hard Applebee's fans, but I can't say I'm one of them. They've got a lot of other options that may just be hidden gems in the menu, but it was a miss for me. On the flip side: the prices are reasonable, the location is convenient, I bet they've got a great selection of mixed drinks, and the staff is pleasant.  Enjoy."
Reyna A.,"Honolulu, HI",13,142,233,1.0,1/1/2018,"Unfortunately the bad reviews are true. The service is horrible. Totally understaffed. I ordered the Classic burger with onion rings and the onion rings were overcooked. The burger was meh. We had to flag down the manager to get our check.  The only highlights of our dinner was : 1. Our waitress Octavia. Her personality was friendly, patient and helpful. It's too bad she was so busy. 2. Birthday dessert for our son Definitely definitely not returning"
Shelby L.,"Honolulu, HI",326,181,2568,4.0,12/28/2017,"2 for $25 deal! Best and most reasonable date night evahhh! Love love LOVE their 2 for $25 deal! One appetizer to share and 2 entrees all for $25.  It's so nice to be getting some good eats restaurants at Pearlridge! It's definitely refreshing to not have to go all the way to town or the new town, Kapolei to get food food.  I came here once so far and I must say, it's pretty big! There's a bar in the back and tons of seating throughout. They're looks of TVs, and light up signs! Definitely, a sports bar kinda place.  As for the food, my date and I got the Spinach Artichoke Dip and I got the Shrimp & Chicken Platter while my date got the Oriental Chicken Salad. The dip was good but we couldn't understand why there was a GIANT chunk of cheese in it. It made it very difficult to eat cause it was solid. But other than that, we enjoyed it and ate around it.  As for my Shrimp & Chicken Platter, it came in a skillet with some home fries & sautéed onions. My shrimp and chicken was covered in garlic butter and made everything super flavorful! The home fries were nice and crispy and didn't even need ketchup because of all the flavor from the onions and garlic butter! (I loooove ketchup so that's saying a lot!) The onions soaked up all the flavor at the bottom of the skillet and so did the chicken and shrimps. The chicken itself wasn't too dry either. I would definitely get this dish again.  My date loved her Oriental Chicken Salad. I do wish their potion size this this entree was a bit more but it did have a generous serving of crispy fried chicken. It probably needed a bit more veggies to balance it out. But, I must say, the chicken itself was very crisp and not oily at all. My date also mentioned really enjoyed the dressing! Definitely a go to if you want a lighter and somewhat healthier meal.  Overall, this was a great deal! My only complaint was the food took EXTREMELY long to come out. Like 20+ minutes and our appetizer and entrees came out at the same time. They're still pretty new so I won't hold it against them too much. I'd definitely be back again for that awesome $25 deal!"
K N.,"Honolulu, HI",108,23,24,2.0,1/4/2018,"My sister and went there for dinner, had to wait a while for our food. Our spinach artichoke dip came out with burnt chips, the dip was a little soggy.    There were too many waiters and waitresses just standing around and talking story. There was another waitress sweeping the floors while still had customers. Heard the manager on duty walked out crying and upon we were leaving an employee was getting scolding in the open where we saw him crying. Won't be going back there for a long time till the get their ""shit"" together. Only thing that came out good was our waitress who was very apologetic for the bad  food."
Nicole Y.,"Mililani, HI",414,232,692,3.0,1/9/2018,"During a trip to the mall, my son and I stopped in for a quick lunch. The wait for a table was about 20-30 minutes, so we decided to try and sit at the bar. There was only one seat left but the hostess was nice and got us another chair. We were greeted by the bartender and quickly placed our order. The menu has a lot of options at reasonable prices. We opted for 2 appetizers for 12.99 and chicken tenders. Since we didn't order a lot, I figured our food would come out pretty quickly. To my dismay, our order did take some time. The bartender apologized for the wait time. My son and I didn't mind so much as we were busy watching the football game on tv. The food was good and what one would expect from a bar/grill type restaurant. All in all, I'd say I'd come back to try their menu items and for more appetizers!"
Andrea C.,"Honolulu, HI",55,8,4,3.0,12/30/2017,"We came around lunch time so we were expecting a line which there was. We checked in and were told by the Hostess that it will take 15 minutes. 15 minutes went by then 30, I'm not one to complain but when I noticed people who came AFTER us getting called first I had to say something. I went up to the host stand and asked how much longer? She says ""Oh what name is your party under?"" I gave her my name and she said ""We already called you but I can seat you right now"". How can they have already called our name when we've literally been sitting right in front of them the whole time. I honestly think they just skipped us and, also how didn't it bother her that we've been sitting there for a while. I failed to get a name of this Hostess but only thing I can remember is that her foundation was too yellow for her skin tone.  Ok moving on to the reason why this review is getting a 3 star was our bomb waiter Jose. Always checking in on us, made sure our drinks were filled and was all around very kind.  Food was alright, we ordered the Combo Appetizer which consist of quesadillas, chicken wings, mozzarella sticks and chips with spinach dips. Everything was great but the  chicken wings was super super salty. The lady who brought out the appetizer also said she'll bring out the ranch dip for chickens but she didn't. I got the triple bacon burger, the bacon was crispy otherwise it taste like any ol' burgers. My friends enjoyed they chicken wrap and some kind of taco. (Sorry!)  Overall, the host stands needs to be more attentive and acknowledge their customers so they don't skip people. Prices are reasonable, there was 4 of us and our bill came out to $79 including drinks and appetizer. Jose is awesome!!!"
Colin H.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,2,,1.0,1/10/2018,"Can't believe how terrible the service is for a new place.  Waited 15 minutes because John one knew who was the server for our table. Then took our drink order, and didn't get that till another 15 minutes. We decided to be patient and just order our food. Big mistake, our food was under the warmer for a while because the cole slaw was hot and the mac-n-cheese was hard.  We noticed others were not getting served too. They actually went up to ask if anyone was going to serve them.  This place isn't going to last to long in a busy shopping center."
Clarissa M.,"Honolulu, HI",59,395,1258,5.0,12/23/2017,"Welcome Applebee's to the neighborhood! Seated for dinner fairly quickly without any wait for a party of four. Our server, Aaron, was friendly, attentive, and super efficient! We devoured the spinach and artichoke dip and mini chicken tacos. Both were quite tasty. For dinner we tried the fish and chips, bourbon chicken with shrimp, double crunchy shrimp with sweet potatoes fries, and grilled chicken with broccoli and grilled veggies. Our food was hot and prepared well. The shrimp sure had the double crunch. Grilled chicken was not dry and seasoned well.  Of course you can't miss dessert here. The triple chocolate meltdown with ice cream is enough to share. Thank you Aaron for your recommendations!"
Keawapuhi K.,"Kapolei, HI",112,1,1,5.0,1/10/2018,"Last night was my first visit to Applebees and personal thanks to my server for making it the best restaurant visit I've had in a long time. I believe his name was Cedrick. He knew the menu flawlessly and answered all my questions perfectly! I was just in the mood for some good dessert and he offered me his personal favorite dessert ""Triple Chocolate Meltdown"" which was delish! I can't wait to visit him and another Applebee's soon! Thank you Cedrick!"
Leicie Y.,"Pearl City, HI",40,24,22,5.0,1/7/2018,Most of these stars are just due to service.  Kacie was awesome. She's so entertaining and friendly. She repeated back our order perfectly. She chatted and joked with us. She was just delightful. The food was good. Dessert was definitely the highlight though.
Danielle M.,"Waianae, HI",0,127,280,5.0,12/20/2017,"Came here for the 1st time ever since we were shopping and it's always nice to check out a new restaurant. It was lunch hr when we arrived so very crowded. The hostess said the wait was 5-10 mins they were clearing tables, we waited about 13 mins. Not bad wait time being peak time less then a week before Christmas. When i looked up there were about 8 empty tables waiting to be cleared or swept under it. Lots of parking being at the mall Located at the old Farrells ice cream restaurant. Near the stairs and hallway by Tilt.  Restrooms are behind the hostess stand They have lots of tv's and a bar Ordered the 2 for $25 which comes w/ 1 appitizer and 2 meals. Also ordered the chicken wonton tacos bcuz it looked good and it was. Our waitress was Kacie she was  super nice and efficient. We didn't wait long for the appetizers and main course once we ordered. Ask her for recommendations she has her favs too.  The grill chicken on the oriental chicken was a little over cooked but the salad itself was tasty. Overall everything we ordered we enjoyed...ate family style. If you don't like to wait to be seated go during off peak hours, when we left after 1pm the place was emptying out and there was no one  waiting at the door. We went on a good day and had a great experience with good food. Plan to go back next time we visit the mall to try the Thai Shrimp Salad and highly recommended Triple Chocolate Meltdown dessert."
Val M.,"Honolulu, HI",67,5,5,5.0,1/6/2018,We really enjoyed ourselves here. Food was good and service was awesome. Very friendly staff. And it came fast
Jeff H.,"Honolulu, HI",265,64,22,4.0,12/4/2017,"Grand Opening was today, and I had to renew my registration at Pearlridge, so I stopped in. No line, no wait, just me, so I sat at the bar. No TVs yet, Direct TV is on its way. I have been to many Applebee's on the mainland and know what they are all about. I am glad to see them in three locations on Oahu- PR, Kapolei and Ewa.  I ordered the appetizer sampler. I got the brew pub pretzels, chicken won ton tacos and artichoke dip with chips. My bartender was Kalena and she was excellent- attentive and made an excellent cherry Pepsi.  My food came really quick. The chips and artichoke dip were hot. The chips were not drained properly so they tasted stale, a soft crunch. But hey, it is their fault, first day. A manager came over and understood my description, apologized and started a new batch.  My pretzels came and instead of beer cheese dip, it had mustard dressing and ranch. A manager, Ryan came by and got me the right dip. The pretzels had no toppings on them (salt and cheese, like in the menu picture). He apologized and brought the toppings out. By this point, I was the ""problem customer"", but the staff did not make me feel that way, I just felt that way. Ruel, the cook/chef came out to check on me and I told him that all the issues I had were manini and indicative of restaurants as they newly open.  The fire alarm went off while I was there, but again, just a growing pain.  The food was excellent. My fave was the won ton tacos. The pretzels were better than the pretzel restaurant that is in the mall too- Pretzel Anne's.  The chips that were fixed were really good, just need a sprinkle of salt. But texture and flavor were good.  Applebee's is not a culinary delight destination with aspirations of food awards, but I expect quick service, good prices and tasty food. This new location is right on track for that. The managers and wait staff stepped up, fixed issues and the back room crew sent out tasty food. I enjoyed my experience at this Applebee's and left with a full opu and money still in my wallet. They will give their competitors a challenge and Pearlridge shoppers another affordable option for meals. Stop in and try their chicken won ton nachos!"
chrysanthe m.,"Honolulu, HI",6,23,8,3.0,1/2/2018,"I'm not really interested  in what Applebee's has to offer however am glad they opened in Pearlridge Uptown giving it more sit down dining options.  This location just opened so it's best to allow them to work out the kinks as most business do.  1. New and clean. However, it feels more like sitting in fast food then a restaurant because of the open seating, though there are booths.   2. They have easy access restrooms!  The former Farrell's had a very badly accessible restroom, otherwise you'd have to go into the mall restroom. 3. I only ordered French onion soup and house salad.  Was good!  The bacon on the salad could have been more ""fresher"" for aesthetic value but it still tastes like bacon, so good, minors!  But the rest of my party ordered steak items, and all 5 orders came out over cooked and incorrect. The kitchen is too new and needs to season more! 4. Servers are actually good.  And they check on you often.  I feel bad I forgot our servers name but she was excellent. 5. The tattooed manager who took care of us, I forgot her name. But she's very sincere and super cool.  6. They have happy hour and alcohol and will have more soon.  I could have wrote a better review but I'm in a rush right now.  I will update because I know my mom will want to come back and she likes Applebee's in the mainland.  After I lose my first 5 lbs of the year I'll order some ribs.  Ok. Gotta go! PS. Don't let bad reviews be your determining factor.  Someone just might have had a shitty day or want to complain about everything. Thank you."
Annalynn R.,"Mililani, HI",0,15,,1.0,12/27/2017,"My husband checked in at 1:06pm and was told the wait was 10-15 mins. A half hour later I checked to see the status with the girl at the front and was told the kitchen was backed up.. so I asked ""you're not seating anyone because the kitchen is backed up?"" And she said yes.. so I asked her to remove us from the list and we would eat elsewhere..  we walked past the restaurant not even 10 mins later and they had seated EVERYONE waiting..  I will absolutely not be dining here any time soon..  That's horrible in my opinion."
Leila F.,"Honolulu, HI",164,7,8,5.0,12/30/2017,Our server Aaron was very attentive and took care of all our requests. Didn't have a nice experience at the Ewa Beach location but this location was much better. We will return in the future. We enjoyed the mozzarella and spinach dip. The entrees were delicious as well. We just enjoyed our visit.
Amy F.,"Kalihi, Honolulu, HI",47,2,5,5.0,12/31/2017,"Thank you to our excellent server Kacie V!!  Our food was taking longer than usual to arrive and she kept checking with us to apologize for the wait. Because of the long wait, she offered us a complementary desert.  Portion sizes vary, but everything tastes good.  Thank you Kacie!!"
Alyssa G.,"Pearl City, HI",0,4,,4.0,1/2/2018,"This was mine and my Boyfriends first time trying an Applebee's. We came in with an open mind as the other reviews had us skeptical to try, the ambiance is very low key and you can have actually have a conversation with the people you are trying to enjoy your meal with, unlike other restaurants like Chili's, and Buffalo Wild Wings. The staff here are very nice and friendly, Xochil was our server. She was very welcoming, friendly, and personable.  There are a few kinks to work on such as the time waiting for your food, but that is like anywhere you go. The food was amazing, my Boyfriend got the Chicken Tenders and fries, I got the Salad from the 2 for $25 menu. The Chicken Tenders were crispy just like the fries, the salad was phenomenal, full of flavors. We will definitely be back here again."
Chris L.,"Mililani, HI",66,161,190,2.0,12/18/2017,"I'm not very enthusiastic about this restaurant chain anymore after my experience with my fiancé's family.  The chaos of a new, busy restaurant I can accept but our wait times were ludicrous.  A beer on tap took over half an hour to arrive at our table, orders made in advance for the 2 children so they could have food and drinks during our wait time came out both too late and incorrectly and our food really wasn't that great either.  I had the stir fry, the meat was chewy and there really wasn't any flavor involved in the experience.  I'm sad to say the experience around our table was pretty much the same. Maybe we'll be back, but I don't think so."
Elson B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",287,14,15,5.0,1/7/2018,"Kacie was fantastic! She was definitely personable and attentive to our needs. We couldn't believe it that this is her first job as a server! The red Apple sangria tasted like a jolly rancher - so delish. Slight wait, but the ambiance was inviting and it didn't have the apple cinnamon smell like the other one (reminds me of bathroom air freshener). Definitely the better of three Applebee's on the island."
Kyle g.,"Aiea, HI",61,2,,3.0,1/7/2018,"First time here with the family and after we were seated, we waited almost 15 mins for our waitress to greet us and another 10 mins to bring us our beverages. Totally unacceptable since it was not crowded.  Our food also took a long time too, so they did provide us with a free appetizer. But also majority of the staff were not friendly and our whole experience was not what we had expected."
Brown B.,"Honolulu, HI",9,33,152,3.0,1/5/2018,"Or third time here, KACIE was our server, and she was EXCELLENT!  We were on a time crunch with a doctor appointment at 2:30 pm and and she was able to get our meals to us quickly.  The best service of our 3 times here!"
Lovely R.,"Hickam Field, Honolulu, HI",11,3,3,3.0,12/30/2017,Omg this place has great ambiance but DAMNNNNNN the kitchen staff is so damn slow!! The poor waitress I had Leila was so sweet to us which was a table of 9!  Her service was in no way shape or form bad it was actually great and she tried her best to push food out when she couldn't.  That kitchen staff sucks sooo damn bad I got in at 5 on the dot and order by 5:15 but everyone's plate came except for myself and another member of my party.  I asked my sweet waitress Leila to remove my entreé. As soon as I asked for it to be removed which was 6:30 not only did my entree arrive but my other party members I spoke of arrived as well.  I don't think I'll be revisiting until the kitchen staff works out its kinks and orders more food instead of running out at the most prime time on a damn Saturday.   Outside of that Leila and Lauren if you ladies are reading thank you so much for your hospitality and kindness all the way through.  Btw where the hell was the manager while this madness happened. If it wasn't for Leila this place would get one damn star sorry. Not sorry
Erika C.,"Honolulu, HI",10,11,19,2.0,12/21/2017,Service was terrible.  Took forever to eat napkins.  Waitress brought our food and we had to ask her to get us forks. No water refills.  Took almost 45 minutes to get our food and my mashed potatoes were cold and my beans were undercooked. The presentation was good though.  Mozzarella sticks were awesome
Lola P.,"Honolulu, HI",0,5,6,1.0,12/14/2017,"Awful! We chose this spot because I am pregnant and had a craving for it and because it had the highest rating of the other locations. Sadly I left still hungry.  We were seated quickly. We ordered our food and then realized that our meals are on the 2 for 25 so we should have gotten an appetizer.  We flagged the waitress down and brought it to her attention and she seemed confused and unfamiliar with which meals qualified. After she confirmed she said since she already put our meals in the appetizer would come after our meals, no problem. Not much longer our food comes out and I bite my fries which are cold as can be and my chicken tenders look old as well. I don't like to complain so I started to deal with it but I just couldn't. Our waitress didn't deliver our food and never followed up so I waited probably 20mins before finally just asking a random server for some service. Within 2 minutes a man comes by with the replacement. And the fries are slightly heated up and the chicken as well. Looks old and is slightly heated up. I picked the chicken up and it is practically sitting in oil. To me it appeared as if they had just recooked or refried the original chicken.. again I try to deal with it because I really wanted this and it was a little warmer. But I was so pissed off that they tried to serve me the same food instead of fixing it the right way plus it was drenched in oil. I literally had to squeeze it with my napkin before trying to eat it. And the fries are cold and seasonless, nothing like the mainland. Anyway 20+mins later waitress finally comes by. I tell her I'm not happy she asks if I want it made fresh... in my head im like yea that should have been the original plan but now I can't trust you guys to not do anything to my food so no. I simply told her no. At this point we still never got our appetizer and we had to remind her. She didn't bring any condiments we asked for when we ordered everything and when we reminded her she acted like it was her first time hearing it. Her excuse for the staff is that they were new and she had to go back and personally make our appetizer. Which was also off. The whole experience was a turn off, i know every place has off days but i dont think we will go back back."
Marti S.,"Kailua-Kona, HI",25,1,,1.0,1/10/2018,"We have always enjoyed Applebees in Nebraska... this was not good. Bad food, mediocre service. Don't go there.... got charged for an extra meal we didn't have too! They should not be allowed to carry the Applebees name!"
Ashlie L.,"Pearl City, HI",10,6,7,3.0,1/8/2018,"Came here for a late lunch today with my friend at about 3pm. It wasn't too crowded. We were greeted and sat right away. Our sever came shortly after, introduced herself and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. We ordered the strawberry lemonade and it was really tasty and refreshing. We both shared appetizers, wonton chicken tacos and the spinach and artichoke dip. Tacos were good, the wonton didn't have that burnt flavor, it wasn't soggy. The chicken kind of had a BBQ taste to it, and the veggies were really crisp. The spinach artichoke dip was CHEESY. Pretty good but CPK might have beat them on that one. For the entree, my friend got the four cheese Mac and cheese with honey peppered chicken(she wasn't that stoked about it), and I got the 3 cheese chicken Cavatappi, it wasn't great, I also had to add some salt. Our server was really nice, but there were times where she forgot to bring stuff. Understandable though, a new restaurant still needing staff. All in all I would come back to this location, maybe order something different next time. Additional side note, it's VERY CLEAN!"
Moani K.,"Honolulu, HI",230,16,2,2.0,1/3/2018,First off the food is DELICIOUS !!!! But let's get to the service and the crew. As soon as you walk in you get greeted by two girls with messy I brushed buns plopped on their head with some pretty nasty facial expressions. She proceeded to ask me how much people were in my party I said two then she asked table or booth I said table she then told me it would be a 10 to 15 minute wait which was fine !!!! We decided to walk around for a bit cane back in maybe 10 minutes we waited for about 15 minutes you could see literally half of the restaurant with open tables. I then walked over to let her know that either table or booth was fine ( because she asked my preference on seating) and she snaps back and says oh well we were told we can't sit anyone else because the kitchen is backed up. So then we proceeded to wait for another 15 minutes while all the workers were talking story and laughing. Tables were filled with dirty plates and rubbish and you can't say they were understaffed because I'm sitting in the restaurant  at this very moment writing this review and there are over 8 servers working. As we came to our table it was not cleaned expected that) our waitress is kind we ordered our appetizers and once again they were DELICIOUS even better than chillis in my opinion lol the time that it took to arrive was decent food was hot. Back to the workers you can literally hear them talking shit about their customers to each others it's quite pathetic and that is a NO NO working in customer service. More servers and workers are walking around with HUGE cellphones hanging out of their back pockets which look totally unprofessional. You're at work put your phones in your bags ESPECIALLY when you work in a restaurant. The way the staff present themselves and choose to act make a restaurant that serves delicious food quite ghetto.  But again the food is really good lol  By the time I finished writing this review it's been over 20 minutes and I still haven't received my main entree.
Scott B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",49,1,,5.0,1/7/2018,I had a great experience here. The greeter opened the door for me and welcomed me. The restaurant had a really good vibe to it. Everyone was friendly. My table was visited by 2 different managers asking how my experience was going and if I needed anything. The food was great. I didn't have to wait to long for food even though the restaurant was full. I definitely will be returning.
Linda B.,"Honolulu, HI",0,32,1,2.0,1/9/2018,"We were seated quickly, but after we ordered, it took almost 45 minutes to get our food and the restaurant was empty!  Most of the food was cold.  The sodas were flat.  The only highlight was that our waitress was very sweet."
Lily P.,"Sparks, NV",77,3,,1.0,1/7/2018,"I thought because it was new and in Hawaii that this Applebee's may be a better quality than the ones on the mainland USA.... I was wrong. It is just as bad if not worse. I tried to eat here twice, mainly because it was a new restaurant but both times was left disappointed. Silverware looked brand new with food stuck on it but still managed to get rolled (had to ask for another set) . The table was dirty both times we went,  service was okay, but the food was disgusting each time. I'm really shocked that who ever is bussing and wiping down tables is unable to look with their eyes and see food crumbs and what not on the tables and seats. The people next to us saw us looking at our dirty table while seating and told us they had the exact problem while their table.  Waited 35min for the trio app,  fries were cold and stale (had to ask  for fresh), also had to ask my server for utensils and plates after the food came, spent $30 on drinks that had way to much ice,  got a steak quesadilla made with American cheese not a cheddar blend, the buffalo sauce was 3/4ths grease, and I ended up getting physically sick to my stomach afterwards. The manager never came by to check on us but took $4 off our check when they shouldn't have charged us for the late and gross food.  I will never go back to Applebee's again based on my last experience, and will be sure to let others know about the quality or lack there of that Applebee's provides. Shameful for a new restaurant and shameful for the management inability to read a bad situation."
Toni D.,"Mililani, HI",9,3,32,5.0,12/4/2017,"Grand Opening today! I have to say from the time I walked in and the time I received my food, I was amazed by the service! The staff are all pretty and handsome! I will definitely be back soon! The General Manager Gladys Duenez is amazing! You will not be disappointed at all!"
Mikala K.,"Honolulu, HI",0,95,6,4.0,1/2/2018,"Loved the steak quesadilla for taste and size.  Love the won ton tacos for the cole slaw freshness, but skimpy serving of chicken.  The mozzarella sticks could've been good but the oil was so old and perhaps not changed after the lunch crows, nor will they change for dinner bc past 6pm.  It left a bitter, slimy aftertaste in my mouth so would recommend first 2 appetizers or 3 pupus/$16.99.  Good to eat while family member's shop."
Tamie S.,"Wahiawa, HI",65,9,5,3.0,1/6/2018,"My first experience did not go well until their corporate office got involved. Refunding me took several unanswered calls, messages until our issue was tweeted and corporate got in touch with me. Finally got a call from management and had to go to AppleBees to pick up my refund. After one month of trying to straighten this issue. Decided to have lunch which they comped the least expensive meal, thank you. The service was nice and friendly and got our meal in 20-25 min. Previous yelp rating indicated that the service was very slow. Ordered the chicken strips, tomato basil soup and a chicken fajita wrap sandwich. The food was all average. It opened over a month ago and hopefully the poor ratings they had in the beginning improves. Would I go back, not sure."
Nonya B.,"Honolulu, HI",59,48,45,3.0,12/12/2017,"Came here when they first open, waitress was attentive guess because they were slow at the time. Food was good and portion size is good we order appetizer, a burger and a lunch special, food took a while and when it came food was warm and not hot felt like it was sitting for awhile. Overall food is good service was good maybe their new and still need to get a routine going. I'll be back to try other things in the menu"
Brandi O.,"Pearl City, HI",36,9,5,5.0,1/3/2018,"Came here for a last minute lunch. Ended up sitting at the bar. Our bartender (Sara) promptly greeted us, set up us with menus and took our drink order. Any questions about the menu were quickly answered. Food came out quickly and perfect (ordered the ribeye). Sara was super friendly and very attentive. I would definitely come back for the food and awesome service."
