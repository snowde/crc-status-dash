T T.,,0,1,,1.0,12/13/2017,"The service was absolutely the worst. Waited for 2 hours and still no food. They kept taking customers knowing the kitchen wasn't producing any orders. My waitress was very apologetic and I appreciate that, but it wasn't her fault.  Hopefully, Chili's will have their orders out in a more appropriate timeframe."
Nina C.,"Waipahu, HI",0,2,1,5.0,12/4/2017,"i came for the grand opening and the service was stupendous. all the servers were on their toes making sure customers were satisfied, drinks never empty, and that everyone had a smile on their face. this just became my favorite applebee's on oahu. 10/10 would recommend."
Rebecca L.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,,4.0,12/9/2017,Food and service was great! Used to frequent the Applebee's back in Oregon and couldn't be happier having one in Hawaii now! Will definitely be coming back! Ordered the 4 cheese Mac and the classic combo- both dishes tasted great!
Savannah A.,"Aiea, HI",0,1,,1.0,12/30/2017,"Today was our first day trying Applebee's and I have to say it was the WORSE food we have ever ate. The spinach pasta had deep fried spinach on it which tasted like they grabbed a bunch of leaves outside in a tree & fried it in a bunch of oil and put it all in the plate. The four cheese Mac with the chicken strips was way worse. It had three small strips which look like they just heated it up and tasted like it came from a store bought refrigerator (like sams or cosco). They also may have put bbq sauce which was suppose to be like a pepper sauce on the Mac but tasted so off. Oh and no bacon!. The 6oz sirloin was cooked good but when you got it looked like a 3oz beef jerky. Now when you have to put a bunch of ketchup on it something tells me it could use some kind of seasoning! The only reason I gave it a one star is because our waiter Chelsea was great and the manager did apologize for how the food turned out!. I was not the only table to complain today (Dec. 29, 2017) so that tells you a lot."
Yah Y.,"Honolulu, HI",0,3,,1.0,12/15/2017,"I had high hopes of great food since I ate at an applebees in another state and it was not bad. This wasn't the case. The service was great but the food was bad. The spinach dip came out and it was decent but there were a lot of small broken chips and the bottom chips were really oily. I ordered the bourbon street chicken and shrimp and my wife ordered some shrimp wonton thing. When my chicken came it was literally half a chicken with some remnants. They actually cut half of the chicken off and put some mangled remnant piece in its place. It looked like a child portion. Then the shrimp wasn't on top of it, it was spread around the dish. The shrimp looked like something precooked and thrown on the plate. The chicken was dry and the shrimp had no flavor. I asked them to take it off the bill and I didn't want to eat it. My wife's shrimp looked like the exact same shrimp but thrown on a different type of dish. Hers was lacking sauce.  The manager came and was very apologetic. She did a good job handling the situation. The service was great but the food sucked. I hope  they can step their game up or they won't last in Hawaii for very long."
Enlil G.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,,1.0,12/15/2017,"VERY VERY BAD. DO NOT COME HERE. My family of 6 orders takeout every other night and decided to order from here.... big mistake. They forgot 2 of our orders and our steaks were over cooked. I tried calling them the very next day because they had closed when we got home. I asked to speak to the manager and they said she was busy and would call me back, i never got a call back. Called again the following day and was placed on hold to talk to the manager again, waited nearly 10 mins and called back because it was apparent they weren't putting me through. They let the phone ring until voice mail, then i called for the third time and the lady hung up on me once she recognized my voice. Called again only to be put on HOLD AGAIN mid sentence, of course i hung up and redialed, demanded to speak to the manager and told them i had been waiting for days now. They transferred me to the assistant manager which was a guy that had a major attitude. I had asked to speak to the main manager and he was like ""why"" ""who am i speaking to"", only to find out that the main manager was SUPPOSEDLY not here again. I explained to him how i had been waiting for days and he said ""I'll give her a call right now and make sure she will call you tomorrow when she comes in"". The next day came and went and i have still yet to hers back from the manager. Tomorrow will make a week of me trying to get in touch with the manager and i have had no contact with her yet. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. The food is over cooked and they will forget your orders that you paid for. Highly encourage everyone to heed my advice."
