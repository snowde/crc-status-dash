T K.,"Kailua, HI",34,23,26,1.0,12/28/2017,"Applebee's service SUX SUPER BIG TIME. First off the table next to us which came after us got their food same time as us. Service is super slow. The food took almost an hour to come to the table,then they forget half of our tables food. I will never return to this place again."
Ari P.,"Eielson Air Force Base, AK",5,10,4,1.0,12/26/2017,Good service but my family and I were waiting for about 30 minutes... It could've been rated better if it was faster!? There were a bunch of waiters but still was slow. I don't really recommend going here but if you want to wait for a long time then come here. Overall I don't recommend this AppleBee's restaurant and I think I won't be coming here again.
Matt O.,"Waipahu, HI",85,43,1,4.0,12/18/2017,"One thing's for sure, I was hoping to myself ""Okay, I'll be nice, I'll be fair and try not to be negative, but PLEASE don't scrutinize me, Applebee's. I went to two different places near the end of the year, and I get something that was the complete opposite of what I wanted."" So...without further ado, time to talk about my time eating lunch at Applebee's. I have to say, the waitress was really appreciative for our visit. Okay, so that's the good news. The menu gave so many options to choose from that I wanted to try and make sure to make my first visit here worth it. I wanted to leave a good first impression with my lunch. And boy, lunch hour was crazy filled. Bad news? I ordered the Classic Burger with Sweet Potato Fries, and what came out of that? It was a Classic Burger with cheese. Yeah...three strikes now that I got scrutinized. However, I did want to be fair and nice, considering that this was my first time coming to an Applebee's here. So...the waitress was kind enough to take back the order, which I appreciated and re-fixed the order. They put some complimentary fries with my fixed order, which I think was kind of them to do that, since I had to wait for my order to be fixed. I was gonna consider putting an even lower rating on this if they screwed it up again, but...to my amazement, finally I was able to eat my food. They did apologize to me for the order taking a while, and I can understand. After all, it just opened for 2 weeks. It's still probably a work in progress, but this was more better than the San Diego Applebee's, or any in California, in fact. I actually had a pretty good lunch, and to be honest, I really loved it. The sweet potato fries are really tasty. And probably, I had a very solid meal. Next time I come, I may go for the lunch special. I'd say give this restaurant a chance and not give them a hard time, especially if this is your first time coming to this Applebee's. But likewise, next time I come here, and they scrutinize my order, they may not be that lucky to get a positive review out of me. Consider themselves warned, because looking at the reviews, 12 are negative reviews, and after this, 26 will be positive. I'm hoping they can correct things and make customers really happy. ((26/38 = 68.4%))"
Shavonn O.,"Mililani, HI",248,3,1,5.0,12/22/2017,"The service was excellent from start to finish.  The manager Lori went out of her way to make sure they had the ingredients to make our lemon drops (not on the drink menu) We had a great server Xochil, ask to be seated in her area, she is the best server we've had in a while. Her bubbly personality was so refreshing at this hectic time trying to get out Christmas shopping done Lori was awesome, 1st manager I had in a long time with outstanding customer service. She made sure we were ok at least 4 times throughout our drinks and meal."
Ranier D.,"Honolulu, HI",113,72,30,5.0,12/30/2017,"Our waitress kacie was very nice and attentive. There was an issue in the kitchen that delayed service, but the comped dessert and appetizers + the friendly service more than made up for it. Which means alot coming from me...5 stars for the service ...but 3.5 stars for the food. Just your typical Applebees."
James E.,"Wahiawa, HI",105,1,,4.0,1/5/2018,"Great first time experience at one of Hawaii's newest Applebees. Food was amazing even though it took awhile to come out, but they are still working out the kinks of a new establishment. The Bartender Sara did an outstanding job and was very friendly. I definitely recommend people visiting her during lunch time."
Kristal Diaz L.,"Northridge, CA",0,22,,1.0,12/28/2017,Very sad. Manager was rude and after telling us it would be a 45 min wait and checking twice once being told 15min more and the second time being told we will have to wait another 30 min passed an hour we already waited it was very disappointing. She was rude talking to us and not one apology. Gave them plenty of opportunities to tell us it would be over an hour and no one ever did. Was also told two different stories that the table was ready they were just setting it up and then that the kitchen was backed up. Never heard of anyone not seating because the kitchen was backed up.
Jacob D.,"Honolulu, HI",0,7,3,1.0,12/30/2017,"I ordered the bone in chicken wings and bourbon street steak for dinner. When the steak was delivered, it was cut in half. I was confused, but I'll play along. Turned out to be steak, but nothing reminiscent of the famed bourbon street steak that I was expecting (and have eaten at several Applebee's over the years).  The waitress then told me they ran out of the chicken wings and that I could have the boneless if I wanted. After the entree is served is when you figure out the appetizer isn't available? All in all, it was garbage food compounded by garbage service and garbage ambience. Maybe one of the Ewa Applebee's lives up to the name..."
Kimo K.,"Waipahu, HI",0,2,,5.0,12/29/2017,"Great food. Awesome staff. Glad they put this in Pearl Ridge uptown. There was a shortage of family friendly, sit-down restaurants on that side of Pearl Ridge. We will be back."
Billy S.,"Aiea, HI",192,2,2,1.0,1/1/2018,"I'll probably never come back to this place. My family and I tried the first time and it will be the last. My son ordered cedar salmon with maple mustard glaze. Salmon seems like it's been sitting in the counter for awhile. My daughter had cedar grilled lemon chicken and she said that her meal got cold quickly and there was not enough rice. Over all it was just bland. Me and my wife had the sirloin wonton stir fry and it was SO oily and had charred, small pieces of meat. After eating it, it was as if I craved a hot green tea because it was SO oily as I said before. She and I also had the firecracker cavatapi and basically it was just mac n cheese with Siracha and battered shrimp. It's an overpriced meal that was not worth it at all. Spend your money wisely and don't bring your family and friends this this place. Need my hot green tea now...."
Kat N.,"Pearl City, HI",14,2,,2.0,1/7/2018,Went here for lunch and Our utensils were really dirty. There was actual leftover food on one of the spoons and the other spoon was sticky. I had caprese chicken and the flavor was sour and bland. Our daughter spilled a full glass of soda and it went all over the floor. No one put up a caution sign and other staff kept waking over it and they kept seating customers. I had to warn someone everyone they walked past. I even asked if they had a sign which I believe is standard for safety reasons and they had to go look for it. When the guy came to mop it up the mop water was stinky and I just lost my appetite. I'm hoping this is just for to them getting there hand off things since they just opened up.
Danna H.,"Honolulu, HI",13,4,3,1.0,1/1/2018,"It took forever to be seated. It wasn't busy. There were empty tables everywhere. Once we got a table and ordered we sat for an hour waiting for our food. They brought out our appetizers the same time as our entrees and everything was cold. Who wants to eat cold cheesesticks and wings? Not I. We ended up paying over $23 a person. With the wait and the disgusting and unappealing food combined, I am 100% positive that I will not be giving them any more of my money."
Tana C.,"Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, HI",0,13,4,2.0,12/27/2017,"This is a new restaurant but its inexcusable to open up with lacking items listed on the menu .The waitresses are not fully trained on how to check out customers receipts.There was an underage female who gave our table an alcoholic drink.She also confused my non-alcoholic drink with my friends and stated ""sorry I'm a minor working the bar I know nothing about drinks""."
Rosalynn B.,"Honolulu, HI",40,4,,5.0,12/23/2017,"Our Waitress Kacie was outstanding as this was her biggest group she has served. 13 people including 6 kids 1 wheelchair person, and 6 adults. Talk about chaos. Only discrepancy was there wheel chair person who ordered steak was the last person to get his food. Other than that Kacie was outstanding."
AnnaAndnoli E.,"Aiea, HI",56,1,,1.0,1/8/2018,Service was ok but the worst part and it's very alarming is charging my credit card aside twice one that I signed for and a second one I didn't sign or aware of the amount of. I called and spoke to a mgr named Rebekah and said she'll take care of it and take out the charge but 3wks past and still no refund on the charge that I didn't even authorize for. Be careful
Shayna S.,"Honolulu, HI",17,2,,5.0,12/22/2017,"It was our first time visiting an Applebee's and it was a great experience! On a last minutes notice the manager Lore, got us a table for 11 in such a short time. As soon as we got seated the waitresses Kacie and Lauren were so nice and helped us with everything. They always checked on us and made sure we were good! I would definitely go back again!"
Yoyohunnay Q.,"Honolulu, HI",2,9,10,5.0,12/22/2017,Kacie is an awesome waitress she was very polite and so helpful with ordering our entries.  She's so upbeat and friendly.  Hopefully the next time we dine here again we will have her as our waitress.
Yasmine G.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,5,5.0,12/11/2017,"From the minute we entered, we had a good experience at this restaurant. Our server, Victoria, promptly checked up on us. My family had ordered the following: Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Boneless Wings, Whiskey Bacon Burger, BBQ Brisket Tacos, 12 oz. Steak, and Shrimp Stir-Fry. The food was absolutely great! Prices are reasonable. Overall, the service + food = A GREAT TIME!"
A M.,"Aiea, HI",0,2,,2.0,12/18/2017,"My boyfriend and I were stoked to try the new Applebees in Pearlridge. It had only been a couple of weeks since it opened but we were willing to give it a chance. The overall experience was quite disappointing.  When we first put our name in, we were told it would be about a 35 minute wait. We waited for about 45 minutes (10 minutes over time...not that bad). Once seated, we waited over 15 minutes for the waiter to come and bring us drinks (we didn't even have water at our table.) After he came back, we ordered our food. I ordered the 2 appetizers for $12.99 (the chicken wonton tacos and the pretzels with the beer cheese dip) and my boyfriend ordered mac & cheese with chicken. The restaurant had started to empty out by the time we put our food in so we figured the wait shouldn't be long. Of course, ""this is not going to go the way you think."" We waited for well over 40 minutes for food with an apology after around half hour. (Feeling mildly annoyed)  Noticing the families around us, we had one family who came around 20 minutes after us got their food before us and another family who came before us got their food after us. I'm not sure what was wrong in the kitchen but I put no blame on the waiter/waitresses on the wait time matter. The waiter, however, did not check on us as often as he should. He was good with refilling our drinks but when it came time for the check, we waited for another 15-20 minutes. Noticing most of the waiters and waitresses, their customer service could be improved overall.  After the lengthy wait, the food was not up to par. My boyfriend's mac and cheese was a little cold and after the length of time we were waiting, you would expect the food to have been hot and fresh. The waiter also brought out my pretzels with the beer cheese dip and immediately took it off the plate and brought it back to the kitchen (not sure what was wrong with the one that was on the plate but he took it away quickly.) That (of course) took about 10 minutes for another cheese. The chicken wonton tacos were okay but not worth the 40 minute wait. My boyfriend generously gives the food a 6/10 where I would give it a 5/10.  Overall, the food was not worth the 40 minute wait and the dinner experience was not worth the whole 2 hours. We hadn't voiced our frustration about the wait time but the waiter mistakenly told us that our food would be covered by the hostess (which it wasn't) but he did take off our sodas from our tab so we were very appreciative of that. He did take note on how long we were waiting so it was nice of him to acknowledge that. We still decided that it isn't worth going back to this Applebees for awhile...give it maybe a year or two till they get their system down."
Lisa M.,"Kailua, HI",2,9,3,5.0,12/29/2017,This restaurant is in the perfect spot and even being brand new the service is as great as the food. Kayla is an awesome server and I'd definitely recommend sitting in her section!
