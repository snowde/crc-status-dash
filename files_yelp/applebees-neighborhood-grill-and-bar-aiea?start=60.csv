Omar U.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/15/2017,This was our first time at this new location and it was definitely a great experience. Kacie was a great server who paid attention to the small details and made sure our orders came out as we wanted and that the entire experience was a pleasant one. Would love to come back and visit again soon.
Larue P.,"Honolulu, HI",38,10,6,3.0,12/27/2017,"Our experience at a new busy restaurant at the mall on a holiday week was very typical and exactly what you could expect busy and long waits. However due to our servers excellent customer service Kahner made a long wait of being seated and assigned a server a great experience for my party of 6. He was super friendly... and if we ever decided to come back to applebee's hands down we would ask for him to be our server!! Overall, Applebee's deserves 3 stars, but KAHNER A deserves 5 ;)"
Ashley B.,"Pearl City, HI",297,1,,5.0,12/22/2017,"This was our first time dinning in, and the wait for the grand opening couldn't have been anymore anticipating. The experience was beyond our expectations and I must say that our waiter Kala (Male) was everything you'd ever want in customer service. He was on it from the beginning to the end. Our food didn't take long at all and everything we ordered was perfect. Way to Start things off Laurie (Manager) who's making sure her team is going above and beyond! Thanks for an awesome evening"
Aaron-Michael H.,"Pearl City, HI",132,1,,5.0,12/22/2017,"Server Aaron is quick, and very personable.  Lighting is well, and the din provides for private conversations."
Martha V.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,,2.0,12/26/2017,"The hostesses were very rude. Didn't acknowledge us as we entered, nor as we left. Customer service was terrible. Manager/supervisor didn't seem friendly either. Wasn't like other restaurants where they make you feel welcome. Would've given one star but our waitress Kayce deserved an extra star because she did an amazing job. That and the food was great. This review is based on our experience on 12/26/17 at around 4pm."
Cindy P.,"Las Vegas, NV",93,141,580,5.0,12/7/2017,"I think most of us have been to Applebee's in the past. I remember when it was one of my favorite restaurants. I don't know what happened, but slowly over time I think the cooks didn't care as much. I've been anxiously waiting for this Applebee's to open. I had to see if they would be better than the ones I'd been to recently on the mainland. Today as I was walking through the mall, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were open. I was quickly seated and my waiter Khalen was quite pleasant as he suggested items to drink. I gave him my order and he was back quite promptly with my water. This had given me a short time to look at their ample menu. I chose the macaroni with 4 cheese and crispy honey chicken tenders. Everyone in the restaurant was very friendly and made sure I was taken care of. My meal arrived in a timely manner and was surprisingly good. I was quite full and in a hurry to get some Christmas shopping done or I would have tried one of my favorite desserts they make...the blondie. I'm just going to have to go back and have dessert first"
Makana M.,"Aiea, HI",122,8,2,3.0,12/26/2017,"The staff are super courteous, but you will be waiting a loooong time for your food. My family of seven went here one Sunday and we enjoyed our service, but we waited close to 45 minutes to get our food and the restaurant was not even that crowded."
Jayson T.,"Aiea, HI",9,1,2,5.0,12/12/2017,Great service from kacie. She is quick to respond to every need. Food out in less than 10 minutes and the bacon bourbon burger was tasty
Kimo Y.,"Honolulu, HI",0,17,2,5.0,12/20/2017,"Stopped in for some cocktails after doing some Christmas shopping... Tasted 3 of their specialty cocktails and was presently surprised on taste and friendliness of Bartending crew... Bar is a little small and bar stools oddly shaped, but restaurant's aura makes up for it.... First impression is 5 stars....."
Jessicalyn T.,"Kaneohe, HI",144,1,,5.0,12/28/2017,"Me and my sister came into the restaurant to get a drink before doing some shopping and the bartender Matthew was so friendly. He was very accommodating, and made sure we felt comfortable. This was our first time ever coming into an Applebee's so we asked what were the drink specials or what he thought we would like. He asked us what kind of drinks we usually would drink and based of our answers he recommended a fireball lemonade and when I say that was one of the best drinks I've ever had, I mean It lol. I don't even care the price. I will definitely be back."
Jay Jay K.,"Honolulu, HI",74,2,,5.0,12/6/2017,"Great place for a last-minute bite after a long day of work, school, and shopping.  Our server Pua was very attentive and friendly.  She helped make our meal enjoyable tonight.  Mahalo Pua!!!"
Claudette E.,"Aiea, HI",14,8,9,4.0,12/9/2017,"Waited forever for this place to come to Hawaii. Now it's in my back yard! Awesome! Great food and friendly staff. Pua our server was fantastic! Even warned us that the good might take a while to come out, so I used the extra time to balance my checkbook."
David M.,"Honolulu, HI",19,1,,5.0,12/16/2017,"Dri was our server and I must say, excellent service was an understatement. Our two year old kept telling thank you at her and without skipping a beat she said with a smile you're welcome all 200 times lol. DRI IF YOU READ THIS, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!"
Kalena G.,"Pearl City, HI",0,2,,5.0,12/19/2017,"The waitresses offered fast and attentive service, making sure that our cups never stayed empty for long. Our main waitress, Dri, was friendly and efficient; and our food was brought to us promptly. The spinach/artichoke dip is a must-have! Definitely recommend trying out the wonderful dining experience."
Daniel Z.,"Kapolei, HI",73,1,,1.0,12/21/2017,"For starters, I'd like to thank the bar tenders servers and kitchen staff at this location, y'all are awesome! I'm posting this on Yelp to see if I can get in contact with someone above the GM at this store.  If I can at least be heard, I will give this location the five stars that the employees deserve."
Tasha L.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,2,5.0,1/5/2018,Great customer service!! Like that theres a large selection of food will be coming back again to try more food.  Our ribs were delicious oh yeah and yummy desse
Samantha B.,"Wahiawā, HI",1,9,20,5.0,12/10/2017,"Went about 8:15 and waited about twenty minutes to be seated. Hosts weren't really that great. Not too friendly and also didn't give us crayons for my sons menu I had to ask for them. Anyways had amazing service from Leila. Ask for her when you come in you will not be disappointed! Food came out decently fast and delicious! Heard a lot of complaints from other customers about wait time for food and said that their service sucks. Let me just say it's not up to the severs when your food comes out. When it's done they bring it to you. Trust me if it was up to them they would have you in and out as fast as possible. Also kitchen is working as hard as they can. They can't serve you raw food so patience is key. Also, if you don't currently work in a restaurant or have not in the last five years let me just say you really should not talk like you know. Because yes Barbra it took a full fifteen minutes to get your food out but guess what you probably couldn't make that pasta any faster at home. Don't come out at prime time dinner rush and go to a full restaurant and expect your food to be out in five minutes. If you're going to think that way and be rude you should just stay at home and make a microwaveable dinner."
Danielle S.,"Mililani, HI",203,5,,1.0,12/13/2017,Absolutely terrible. Bad/slow service. Food is microwaved so some foods came out FROZEN in the middle not to mention super late. Forgotten sides. I cannot and will not again.
Angelica G.,"Aiea, HI",0,1,,5.0,1/5/2018,Our sever Aaron was awesome! Helped us the menu and was so patient with my decisive mom!
Clinton W.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,,5.0,1/4/2018,"Had Matt as our bartender he was great.  Had Lori the Manager come greet us and we had great service.  French Onion soup, Bourbon Chicken & Shrimp was great.  Shrimp won ton was amazing.  Come down and get some."
