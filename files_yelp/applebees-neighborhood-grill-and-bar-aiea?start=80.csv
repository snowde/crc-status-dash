Dana S.,"Honolulu, HI",102,2,,5.0,12/8/2017,"Incredible food and incredible, incredible service! My husband and I came here for our weekly date night and everything was perfect. Our drinks were constantly refilled, the food was hot and delicious, and our waitress, Kayla, was attentive. This has become our favorite place to go!"
Taylor S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,,5.0,12/28/2017,The food here great and Kacie was very helpful with finding my wife food that she can have. I would definitely recommend her in the future. The All Day Brunch Burger was delicious and the Guinness was great. Had a great experience and will be coming back.
Matthew B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",51,2,,1.0,1/2/2018,"We were pretty excited to eat here since we hadn't been to Applebee's in quite some time. Sadly I wish we would have checked the reviews first. It took forever to get seated in a less than busy restaurant. The bench at our table was broken and wobbly, which seems odd for a new restaurant. The service was horrible. Our food came out before our drinks which were just water. Our server was horribly slow, and it took us longer to get the check and pay than it did to eat. I suppose I should be happy that our food came out 5 minutes after ordering, but that raises a whole new question about how much they precooked. I would say stay away, very far away."
Tyler S.,"Wahiawa, HI",0,2,,5.0,12/7/2017,"Came in for dinner on Tuesday, food was great and our server Leila was awesome. Leila was very friendly and accommodating. We'll be back soon!"
Shirl R.,"Mililani, HI",62,3,,1.0,12/18/2017,"I would have left a negative star but its not possible.  We came in on Friday night, it was 830pm and we waited 35 minutes for a seat. At 905pm we sat down. Needless to say fpr mpre than 15 minutes no one came to our table for our order/drinks or anything. My husband had to go to the front at 922pm to ask for some service. The lady took our order finally. At 927pm we finally got our drinks. At 937pm a different lady came to our table to see if everything was ok, I told her that we have been waiting awhile, she assured us that our order is in and should be out soon. Still waiting.... 956pm came and I was expecting at least our appetizer by then, but another lady came to our table and said that they no longer had the entree my husband ordered. Uummm, didnt the lady say our order was being worked on over 20 minutes ago?? After only recieving water in an hour, my husband and I walked out. Never in my life have I walked out of a restaurant but service here could have been delivered better by a 5 year old! I will never return to this place!"
Kelly T.,"Kihei, HI",0,2,,5.0,12/29/2017,"Our waitress Bree was awesome, she catered to our every need and had a great attitude. The food was great as well, it came out within 5-10 minutes of ordering.  Will definitely come back for the great service and food."
Lance J.,"Aiea, HI",0,1,1,5.0,12/7/2017,I came here with my family and Aaron was our server. The food came out quick & Aaron provided excellent service. We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share and everything came out fine while tasting oh so delicious. I am definitely coming back soon to try other food.
Daniel K.,"Kaneohe, HI",0,1,,5.0,12/22/2017,"Best Applebee's experience I've had. Really enjoyed our waitress, Victoria! She was very sweet, always came by to check on us and always had a smile! We'll be back again!"
T M.,"Honolulu, HI",0,9,6,1.0,12/9/2017,"If I could give a lower star rating I would. First of all the wait took a hour then took 15 minutes just to get our drinks, and 25 min to get my kids drink cause the ran out of milk and couldn't blend a lemonade after they said they could. Food took over a hour to come out. Then they didn't even bring out the right order. So we waited another 45 for frizzled onions, which still didn't come out so, then we ask to take off our bill, and the waitress said she couldn't take off after already ringing, come on please I'm in the industry that's bull*! Don't come here food sucks and service sucks"
Gino D.,"Ewa, Ewa Beach, HI",454,1,,5.0,12/27/2017,LOVED my time here at Applebee's pearlridge! From the hosts to the server to the manager... Service was great food was awesome... I had the chicken wonton tacos and spinach artichoke dip and Asian chile boneless chicken for appetizer ... then I had the bourbon steak and the triple chocolate meltdown for dessert... I was so full and satisfied when I left.. definitely will be back again.
Denise S.,"Pearl City, HI",0,38,17,1.0,12/17/2017,First of all Yelp is showing this place is close?? Today is Sunday Dec 17 and Applebee's is open! Wait time was about 30min so we decided to sit at the bar? Only 8 people n 2 bartender and service is slow! Finally got our order and my steak was well done/overcooked n dry! Hopefully the second time around it comes out Medium Rare like I ordered it!! If not it will get sent back and my order will be cancelled! Lucky for the cook my order was done correctly! Just saying!Oh and btw- tell my way the host in the front never came to call my name for a table we checked in about 7:30ish?? Would have been waiting all night if we never sit at the bar! Now it's 8:55 and no one asked if we wanted desert but did tell us our tab is in the glass!! Looks like I'm not coming back here again!!!  Worst Birthday dinner ever- unhappy customer!
Toni A.,"Pearl City, HI",0,2,1,5.0,12/5/2017,"Chicken tenders was really good. And the triple chocolate meltdown was the best! Good service and good food, we will be back for sure!"
Geoff C.,"Waimanalo, HI",0,5,,1.0,12/21/2017,"Bad service, dirty dishes and restaurant, small portions, mediocre food. It took 5 minutes for the hostess to come to the podium.  There were two parties ahead of us that had been waiting even longer. The floor was greasy and slippery. (this is a new restaurant).   We waited 5 min for a waiter, we ordered drinks and waited 12 minutes to get a beer and a glass of wine.  ( I started timing)  my wife's wine glass has dried food on the outside. When the food came my salad bowl had greasy fingerprints on the rim and dry crusty stuff on the under side,  like it wasn't washed well.  I decided to deal with it.   I unwrapped my silverware and saw a greasy film on the fork and knife.  I showed the waitress and she got me another set.  They too were greasy.  She went in the back and hand washed a set for me.   She did her best. Overall there seemed to be a lackluster attitude by the staff, manager included. We won't be going back."
Lynn U.,"Pearl City, HI",0,9,,2.0,12/5/2017,"I wish I could say positive things about this place but I can't! Went there and everything was excellent. Sat us quickly and immediately our server was at our table! This was nice since most places take for ever! She got us a sampler and then that's when it started! Our sampler was to come with honey bbq wings but came with buffalo. I was excited to eat there, I figured it was a little mistake easy fix! It took 20 mins to get the replacement wings, already 20 mins into our dinning experience that's 40 mins! I asked for ranch that didn't get to me until 10 mins later. Then after another 20 mins that pass by we where told that there was a mix up in the kitchen and our manager will be up to talk to you. Another 10mins pass by and finally our food comes out with the manager and all she asked if the food looked good and didn't address the issue . Ready to eat I mix my food up, load and behold a blue plastic trash in in my food. Sent it back and cancelled it, no manager to come to address the issue again! Wow! I even told my mom we should eat there then told her we are definitely not going back. The waitress Victoria was ok. She apologized but seems like her head was in The clouds most the times other people had to help us and flag her down to let her know we needed help! Ugh!"
Tang I.,"Waipahu, HI",0,7,2,3.0,12/15/2017,"It was a good and bad experience. Appetizer was good, we order the sampler combo. Server was very attentive but the food was kind a awful experience because at first shrimp and the sauce on my friend sirloin was missing. So she have to wait for it. Secondly, they round out of what my other friend wants to order and they suggested something else, but thats no problem cause we understand because the place was just recently open. Then when my friend finally gets her compromise order,  the sirloin wasn't  well cook as my friends requested. So she ask for it to cook again. She waited too long and when her ordered finally came then they forgot the Shrimp and sauce again on the sirloin!!!  Remember this is my other friend. She kind a lost her appetite already because two of her friend almost done eating. I think  the managers came to us like three/four times to apologized many times for the mistake on our food. Manager give us discount ($5) for the  inconvenience... In our opinion the food wasn't that taste good, it was so so. Also tomato basil soup no taste at all. We also ordered tea drinks with different flavors but we didn't taste the flavor at all. We might not coming  back here again."
Jeffery S.,"Aiea, HI",344,4,1,5.0,12/9/2017,"It was Our first time at Applebee's.  Keeping in mind we went at peek dinner time, from the time we gave our name to the time we were seated was less than 30 minutes...and they gave us a call to let us know which allowed us to go window shopping in the meantime.  We were seated and promptly met by our waitress Leila.  Absolutely great smile and personality along with her attentiveness to our needs.  We ordered drinks and absolutely loved the Blackberry Honey Quenchers.  We had 4 Apps and 4 Entrees. The Food Was Great as well as the time it came out in.  Dessert was the Best Part ,  The BLONDIE is to kill for.  During our meal the Manager Gladys came by and made sure everything was to our liking as well as our expectations.  Gladys was very professional and had a special Aloha Spirit in her that made us feel at home.....Kudos to the entire staff and wonderful new restaurant to the Aiea area.  I will definitely recommend this establishment."
Brannel L.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,,5.0,12/9/2017,"Tried the new Applebees after shopping for a few hours. It was busy but waited only 10 mins. Food was awesome! Ruel constantly checked on us to make sure everything was ok, Aloha Ruel for the great customer service!"
Nikki S.,"Aiea, HI",0,3,,4.0,12/9/2017,We tried the chicken taco and steak quesadillas were Ono. Our server Pua and manager was terrific and awesome :)!
Roxanne B.,"Kaneohe, HI",0,3,,1.0,12/6/2017,I can't believe we spent $45 on dinner that was less than what they give you in a bento box.  My husband's steak was dry and cold while his potato was steaming.  Not worth my hard earned money.  I guess we won't be returning here anytime soon.
Palaie T.,"Ewa Beach, HI",146,3,,5.0,12/13/2017,"My partner and I had a great first time experience at the new applebee's in pearlridge! Our food was good! ( I had the mac and cheese with the honey tenders, and my partner had the stir -fry) it was part of their 2 for $35 which is very fairly priced. the decor is nice and modern, and the overall feel of it doesnt feel to cramped or small. As far as service goes truly cant thank enough the 3 staff that just made our experience awesome. The  hostess Ali wow'd us with how she made sure we were all ok as we waited to be seated, even checking on us after we had sat. Bartender's Nolan and Matthew are awesome! ( Nolan makes a mean drink but so good!) Nolan was super attentive to us, and Matthew made sure that even if he was busy or Nolan was helping someone else he made sure we were doing ok. Now I will add, the restaurant is in a mall, so its expected to be busy, but with great service from Ali, Nolan and Matt, truly made the difference! We will definitely return."
