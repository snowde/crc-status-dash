Catrine M.,"Stony Point, NY",1,30,26,3.0,8/19/2017,"Just ate here with my friend and our 2 children. We only had some salads, grilled cheese, and chicken nuggets with fries. The service was excellent however, it was very pricey. Couldn't believe it was $60 with tip. We could have gone to many other places for half the price. The food was not any better than other chains.  We will go elsewhere next time. It was an expensive lunch."
Kyle D.,"Manhattan, NY",187,27,6,1.0,10/24/2017,"I'm disinclined to expend too much energy on a restaurant that feels no compunction to spend much energy on its food. I haven't the faintest idea why I chose to dine here and am frankly embarrassed that I did so. The place was mostly deserted, and, as we found, with good reason. The boneless wings were more breading than chicken, slathered in a sloppy (in all senses of the word) sauce, and absurdly salty. The steak was overcooked despite my clearly having stated it be cooked rare. The broccoli had a slightly metallic aftertaste. Even my mother's drink was watery. I am giving two stars out of politeness, but I suppose I should be polite to myself first and foremost and go back to steering clear of places like this. EDIT: On second thought, there is no logical reason this place deserves anything more than one star."
Sean H.,"Washington Township, NJ",83,215,16,3.0,4/29/2017,The kids love it. The staff is always very nice. The food does sometimes come out salty.
Scott W.,"Sussex, NJ",10,202,130,2.0,9/10/2016,"It's kinda like a McDonald's with a liquor license. Not knocking this particular place but the food is not to my liking. The premixed cocktail mixer don't do it for me either but I will say that in this particular spot, the service is friendly but good. However, I'm skipping the chain restaurants from now on"
Vanessa B.,"Nanuet, NY",585,160,321,2.0,4/11/2017,"good service, though all tenders are not straight - don't know if that bothers you. food is okay; just not worth it. small chickenfeed and $50. unbelievable, and the two for $20? sneaked into 2 for $27. might as well have gotten two steaks instead of pasta and a steak."
Karla A.,"Tuxedo Park, NY",20,9,,1.0,3/4/2017,"Horrible service: I ordered carside to go (just an appetizer) It was supposed to be ready in 10 minutes but 25 minutes later I call to say that I was outside and the guy said ""Uh well, I'm the bartender and I'm the only one ""on"", if you want your food you're gonna have to wait."" I was flabbergasted, who talks to a customer like that? So since these people have my food, I didn't say anything in fear that they would do something to it. Then he said, or you can just come and get it yourself. What a jerk. The food was super cold and the service sucked so I'll never go there again."
Michael D.,"Nanuet, NY",0,1,,5.0,5/5/2017,"Still my favorite place for happy hour!!! The burgers are always fresh. The staff is friendly and really cares about their guests. It's in a convenient location. Exit 14b off the thruway. Hop off, get a bite to eat, and hop back on! That simple!"
Tom W.,"Orangeburg, NY",45,4,1,1.0,12/4/2016,"The service was terrible. The restaurant wasn't full, yet there was a wait for seating. The appetizers arrived before the drink from the bar, (which were incorrect), part of the order never arrived, and the pricing was inconsistent with what was on the menu. There was a parade in the town the evening we went, but it was widely publicized and if the restaurant was worried about being busy, they shod have put extra staff on. The lack of organization left me completely bewildered. Both my wife and I have several years combined in the food service industry and we're equally disappointed."
Angelo P.,"Monsey, NY",0,35,2,5.0,5/21/2017,"Food ia like on any other appbs... Mehhhh, but my 5 stars go to the GM, i dont remwmber his name, but he was friendly and attentive, thanks for a great experience man!"
Angelo P.,"Point Pleasant Beach, NJ",29,10,2,1.0,3/23/2017,Waited 25 minutes to be seated along a huge crowd of people and there was only someone(the bartender it seemed) at the host stand for less than a minute of that time(only one party was seated during that time).  Other staff looked and kept on walking.  Absolute joke cant imagine how bad the service would of been if we actually ate there.  They have there number posted outside so I called out of curiosity and they answered right away...why do they have someone just for the phone but not a host.
Elizabeth D.,"Saddle River, NJ",0,7,1,1.0,10/8/2016,Ordered take out this eve.. The prices charged did not match website prices  49.00 for three entrees . Charged me over 15.00 for cedar grilled lemon chicken  A Very Small portion and way too salty!! Disgusting!  Onion rings way over fried!!! Last time Dining there!!
Adam H.,"Suffern, NY",80,38,2,1.0,6/1/2016,"Probably the worst and most disgusting Applebee's I have ever been to. Just awful service, dirty & grimy feel to the place, terrible food.."
Maire B.,"Nanuet, NY",11,61,,1.0,2/12/2017,"Went there in late January with an adult and a child.  We ordered two entrees and a kids' meal along with two bar drinks and appetizer.  We were not in a hurry, and the waiter knew this.  The drinks are expensive and huge and we would have liked some time to relax and enjoy them, but right after they were served we received EVERYTHING:  the appetizers AND all the meals.  Needless to say we could not enjoy any of the food since we rushed through our drinks to eat the appys while they were still hot.  No matter, the dinners were cold by the time we got to them.  To add insult to injury, I requested a senior discount when our order was taken and mentioned it again before the bill was totaled.  In the confusion of trying to call up and pay the bill at the table I didn't realize the waiter hadn't included my senior discount .   The bill was over $100, so this was not a small sum.  Perhaps the waiter was new, but that doesn't excuse the poor service and the neglect to bill me correctly.  (It was sent to my email address and I didn't see the error until after I checked my computer.)"
Melissa C.,"Mahwah, NJ",0,5,,5.0,8/12/2016,"Consistently good, solid food, great drinks, great dessert and great service. Host, Nick,  is friendly and inviting and will find you a great seat quickly and checks up on you to see if everything is okay."
Sophie K.,"Mahwah, NJ",0,7,,2.0,8/24/2016,"I like Applebees appetizers, so me and my family went there after 10pm, all appetizers are half price. But the waitress service was terrible, I don't even want to talk about it."
Karma D.,"Trenton, NJ",0,25,4,2.0,11/4/2016,"Went here because I had a gift card. The server was nice. The food was not. Kids had burgers, both were under cooked. I had a southwest chicken salad. Not sure how you can mess up a salad with some grilled chicken on it, but they managed. Hope to never return"
Lisa M.,"Rockland County, NY",235,100,356,4.0,11/6/2015,"I sat at the bar for the first time and it was kind of cool. We got our food in a decent amount of time. I was surprised that the place wasn't packed! The game was on last night. Anyway, I tried something new: the Chicken Fajita Rollup and while it did taste delicious, I didn't taste any chicken!! But I didn't let the waitress know because I didn't want to be such a burden nor get charged extra haha. Overall, I guess I can say I had a nice time. I think I ended up being in someone's picture (if you're reading this, you should practice being more discreet sir lol)."
Robert M.,"Ramsey, NJ",3,6,,1.0,7/19/2015,"Not only did everyone seem to hate being there but no one wanted to even talk. We were ""greeted"" by the greeter and she didn't even say hello. She actually looked scared. Then we got to our table, waited 10 minutes to have a woman come over and go ""are you getting a drink"". No hello no introducing herself just a rude what-do-you-want attitude. After we got our drinks she then left with out asking if we were ready to order and we were. When. She finally appeared we had to call her over to tell her we were ready. It took 30 min just to get our appetizers and then another 20 minutes to get our food!!!! The worst part was they were not even busy! Our waitress was so rude and curt that when I asked why is it taking so long she actually snapped at me and said ""you wanna see the ticket of when you ordered? Ya that's what I thought"" and walked away. DO NOT EAT AT THIS APPLEBEE'S!!!"
"Karen Baptiste,Real Estate Agent B.","Suffern, NY",0,7,3,5.0,2/17/2016,"We love it at Applebee's. I arrange for a client meeting at the restaurant.  The service as always was wonderful. Great Food, drinks and atmosphere!"
Simon P.,"New York, NY",103,174,37,4.0,2/18/2014,"Got out from a late night event at church and was in dire need of grub. A friend suggested Applebees and I immediately vetoed. I've had waaay too many bad experiences at Applebees so generally I avoid it like the plague. However, when he mentioned it was half-off appetizers after 10pm, I had a change of heart aka I went into ""ballin' on a budget"" mode.  I've got to say, even if our bill wasn't 50% off, this place would still be pretty good. Portions were huge and the food tasted fresh. And best of all really good service."
Skye J.,"Summit, NJ",3,8,,4.0,4/17/2015,I've had a good experience even time I've came here. The servers are very nice. They changed the menu and removed a lot of my favorite appetizers which is really annoying. The portions got smaller and more expensive. I'm still going to keep going here though because I love the food and its a great place to bring the family.
Ashley H.,"Spring Valley, NY",0,13,,3.0,3/16/2015,Very nice and friendly. Food was good but restaurant need updating. Happy hour deals are great but they also need updating.
Sandra D.,"Suffern, NY",0,3,,2.0,2/1/2015,Friendly staff but the quality has done down at this location.  We've been going to this Applebee's for a long time and now it seems to have a weird odor - like a kitchen smell when you walk in.  not very appealing especially if you get seated near the kitchen. Too many menus were given to us too - and 1 of them wasn't even valid as it was the mon-fri lunch options apparently.  Not worth it.
Devin L.,"Yonkers, NY",296,684,95,3.0,10/13/2010,"Not a bad location. They have a special on pints and apps until 7pm.  There are also little speakers on the bar tables so you can listen to the tv's. The food was pretty good.  Had the shrimp app, nachos and wings.  All were tasty with a little spice.  The wait staff was very attentive and nice."
Steve B.,"Stony Point, NY",41,153,29,3.0,3/19/2012,"Second time and if you don't ask for the 2 for 20 special you don't get that menu. I feel abused. Food and service was good but again, I feel ripped off with having to ask for the special menu"
Paul W.,"Hoboken, NJ",25,27,54,5.0,12/7/2013,The food was new applebees had a Philadelphia cheeseburger and broccoli and food was great for a chain. Sam Adams seasonal also good and cold.  My friend ordered a strange brown rice and shrimp and they said now problem made it and put on same plate.  Our server was also fast polite and excellent service note we were there at 3:30 a non rush time thoug
Elizabeth B.,"Nyack, NY",3,2,,4.0,12/7/2013,"Did lunch here on a Wednesday. Service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable. My friend ordered the Napa chicken- wasn't very impressed with it. I ordered the grilled chicken caesar salad and it was good. The server recommended the dessert 'bites' which we tried- strawberry cheesecake and brownie bites and both were very good and exactly the right portion for wanting something sweet but without being overly indulgent. Would definitely come back if in the area again."
Jim H.,"Sloatsburg, NY",146,6,,2.0,3/2/2012,"I've got to start with the thought that I usually really like Applebee's, and Their menu is great.  My trips to the Applebee's in Airmont however have left me disappointed.  When I went with my wife and daughter we never got our dinners and had to box them up and go because my daughter who is 1 was getting tired after being there over an hour.  The server was nice and friendly, however they have some serious work to do."
Jen M.,"Suffern, NY",1,26,,1.0,5/20/2013,"I used to dine at this Applebee's fairly often and always had good service until this past year. I have been noticing a slow decline over the past year and now it has hit rock bottom. I can't complain about the food because it is just chain food and the same at all of them unless they go out of their way to mess it up. Ok so we went there around 7 pm, was not busy at all. We had to wait for about 5 minutes for the host to even come seat us, and he had a horrible attitude. After we were seated our waitress walked by our table at least 10 times, and didn't take our drink order for 15 minutes (drinks didn't arrive for another 10 minutes). We normally would have just left at this point but had had a long day and just wanted something to eat. I ordered the Chicken fajita roll up with no Pico De Gallo. When she finally brought our food what seemed like a lifetime later, she had chicken fajitas (totally different meal). I told her that that was wrong and she just looked at me with a blank stare and told me that that is what I ordered until another server stopped and helped us and told her to take it back. It came back about 20 minutes later but with the pico on it. By this time the table sitting behind us had asked for the check and the table behind them was complaining because she brought out the entrées, but they had ordered soups and salads and apps and the server did not understand why they wanted her to take the entrées until after they were given the app, she actually stated ""Ohh so you don't just want to have them now or after?"" I asked to just have my meal prepared to go because I was not going to make my partner wait for yet a third attempt to get what I actually ordered. She finally brought me my to go food. At this point the table behind us with small children had been asking for the check for over 45 minutes. It was a joke in our whole section because she had messed up everyone's meal. The couple behind us asked to see the manager. He came over about 10 minutes later threw his hands in the air and yelled, ""Well what do you want me to do about it!"" I believe the couple was just in shock and said they just wanted the check, he stormed away and came back and literally threw it on their table. That was not a pleasant experience and I did not go back for a very long time. A couple of weeks ago, I decided to get the car side to go. I called and ordered and the girl just hung up after I said the last item. I called back to give them my info for my car and a different person answered the phone. He said ""Oh..you want her to actually bring it out?"" I replied yes and asked if they were still doing that, he says, ""Yea I guess."" So I get there and park in the car side area. I waited for about 20 minutes. I didn't want to go in because I have a broken foot and didn't want to walk up the curb, hence why I was doing car side. Finally she came out and handed me the check with out even a hello (There goes your tip right there). She went in and came back out with my cold food, gave me my credit card rolled her eyes and shook her head on the way. That will be the last time myself, family and even friends who I told will ever be going to that establishment. Very sad because it used to be good."
Susan G.,"Nanuet, NY",0,2,,3.0,3/14/2013,"Food and service are ok-alot better than the one at Woodbury Commons. I get their oriental chicken salad and onion soup  and the salad is always crispy. The soup is passable.  I am have mostly been  there  at non crowded times. At lunchtime, I have  always been given the special menu. If I have gotten take out and asked them to rush the food, they have...adequate food for the price."
Janine W.,"Suffern, NY",294,444,248,3.0,11/5/2008,"Pleasantly surprised are the words that come to mind.  There were no screaming children and the food was OK.  I ordered from the Weight Watchers menu, an Italian chicken and mushroom sandwich with a side of fruit.  The sandwich tasted like an actual grilled piece of chicken and the mushrooms were slightly marinated in balsamic vinegar.  Hubby ordered the chicken Caesar salad which was meh.  Tasteless but a rather large portion compared to my WW delight. All in all OK if you are in a bind and don't want to cook."
Clare J.,"Nanuet, NY",0,1,,1.0,3/24/2011,"This place has the absolute worst service out of any restaurant I've ever been to. My friends and I had to wait for an hour until our food arrived, and the waitress we had was just plain annoying. Also, the food tasted terrible. I know I'm never going back here again!"
