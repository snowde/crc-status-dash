Scotty B.,"Albany, OR",0,6,,5.0,12/23/2017,"Impressed!!!!  We ordered the two meals for 25 dollars. The salads were fantastic!!  The main course was outstanding!!  Just the right amount of food. Great service!!  Even though the place was busy, it was clean!!  Our new favorite for sure!!!"
Emma I.,"Albany, OR",4,3,1,5.0,11/25/2017,We love this place because they have improved  a lot and the food is great. There service has also improved a lot more than there food which is great. Everyone is very kind and interactive and the food is very fresh! In this case I think they should at least have a 4 star rating
Denny S.,"Waterloo, OR",3,6,4,1.0,1/10/2017,"My family and I ate at this Applebee's restaurant in the summer of 2016 and we thought it was great... We ate there again on January 9th, 2017 on my birthday thinking that we would repeat the great summer experience.  I ordered a full rack of baby back ribs with baked potato and broccoli.  When the dinner arrived, the ribs were dry and somewhat tough... They appeared to have been cooked the day before then microwaved to warm them up.  Succulent is NOT a word one could describe them with.  I complained and was served another order with exactly the same results.  I am no stranger to good ribs and these guys did NOT qualify in any respect... The broccoli was served plain, steamed and not toppiing not even butter.  The baked potato was reasonable but not outstanding. My wifes dish was overly spicy and she had specifically questioned the waitress as to weather it was a spicy dish and told that it was mildly spicy... Not true, too hot for my wife to eat so they offered her another food choice... She ordered a hamburger and it came with patty, two buns and cheese... NOTHING else in it at all. I was happy with the waitress and even the manager but the cook or the food were lacking.  I don't feel that we will be returning there anytime soon.  Either the cook has changed or else he failed the McDonalds 'reheat and serve again' classes. To set the tone, none of the meals were served with any garnishment or plate appeal.  This is all contrary to our visit earlier the previous summer. Applebee's is supposed to be a upperend bar/restaurant chain but this experience has certainly left a foul taste in our mouths. It is my hope that this review might inspire the management to take a close look at the meals served and consider putting forth an order that LOOKS as well as Tastes appealing."
Michael L.,"Corvallis, OR",219,70,58,5.0,2/27/2017,"We were hesitant about coming here but it was close to an errand we had to run. We have had really crappy service at locations in Corvallis and Salem in the past. Now that being said the Albany location was AWESOME, it looked like it was going to be a long wait as we walked in but they seated my wife and I right off the bat.  Our server was Lloyd, he was an amazing server. He took our drink order and made sure we were never low on our drinks the entire time we were there. My wife has a gluten sensitivity and he helped answer any questions we had, he also remembered the allergy as we were getting our food and didn't bring something out that had gluten which we were thankful for. He was amazing and attentive the entire time, something we haven't had at other locations. He also had a  full section so it shows how good he was. We will definitely be coming back to this location versus others."
Ty S.,"Albany, OR",0,7,,1.0,4/20/2017,Foods decent but didn't expect much it's Applebee's.  Absolute worst service I've ever had!
Stephanie K.,"Albany, OR",34,66,26,5.0,11/15/2016,We always go to Applebee's for late night apps as a woman's night get away. But this new menu and steaks are actually worth going again for. I took my husband this time who's a total beef snob and he didn't complain.  Which means he still thinks he can make them better at home on the traeger but these were pretty good he said. Which actually says a lot LOL. Also we had Lloyd as a server. I mean who could be better. Lloyd is the best!!!! Applebees should know that there is a huge post on Facebook and albany happenings featuring Lloyd!!! He is a terrific server and running out to a customer in the parking lot to tell a customer they paid to much is amazing. That more then just good service that's honor and integrity!!!!!!
Stephen I.,"Brownsville, OR",1,27,19,5.0,10/30/2016,Thank God they have finally upgraded their menu. Great food now and great prices. Kid friendly and you can watch football from just about any angle.
Shawn F.,"Mount Enterprise, TX",0,4,,5.0,11/18/2016,They have a Great bartender named Nicole. I have been there several times and this young lady always has a smile on her face and is very attentive.      Food is excellent!  Especially the Butter pecan Blondie.  Chips and salsa are excellent !  Drinks are good as well!
Becca S.,"Renton, WA",13,154,1,3.0,6/14/2015,The service was slow and rather absent. It took awhile to even see our server after being sat when the restaurant wasn't very busy. I had a moment where I wondered if we were sat in an unmanned section on accident! Siracha shrimp was a bad choice and they have very limited dairy free options available.
Cyndi C.,"Santa Fe, NM",0,37,40,3.0,11/21/2014,"We stopped the other day for happy hour....Just a warning Happy Hour drinks are WEAK!  I had to send back my sour apple martini, it tasted like water and looked like water!   (see the picture) I was told it was the happy hour drink and they were a little different than the regular....NO thank you I'd rather pay full price for the real think. Our service was GREAT we called him Mr. Applebee because no mater what we asked him about from the menu he knew the answer and he had a great personality! If I could give separate ratings it would be .....Drink 1 star and the server a 5 stars!"
Shannon C.,"Salem, OR",0,17,4,1.0,2/22/2016,"My husband and I were there this past Saturday for lunch. Not sure what the bartender was on but YIKES.  My perfect margarita wasn't very perfect, another guy sent his back and all she did was pour it from the glass he obviously has drank from, back into the shaker, add simple syrup, poured herself a taste and then sent it back to the customer.Yuck.  All the while complaining and bitching at the wait staff! Some of our good was burning hot and some barely warm, it was really disappointing. We wish would would have just drive back to Salem to eat."
Nick H.,"Philomath, OR",0,10,,2.0,3/12/2016,"All I can say is that the food was good but the service staff is slow, and completely unatentiv to us. Apparently there are no refills on water, and takes a long time to get ranch for you appetizer. Maybe they had to make the ranch."
Jeffrey R.,"Molalla, OR",15,89,3,2.0,5/23/2013,"Oh, Applebee's; you used to be a safe bet, but now you seem to be struggling. I've had 3 star, even 4 star experiences with you, but last night was appalling. We visited the Albany location last night with a group of seven, including two children (ages 7 & 10). I ordered the ""Blackened Tilapia"", which has the following description, ""Lightly rubbed in Cajun spices, grilled and drizzled with garlic and thyme sauce. Served with fried red potatoes and seasonal vegetables."" I wanted just a small side salad to go with it, but they wanted $3.49 extra, so I decided to pass. First off, the ""cajun spices"" were almost completely absent, and it just seemed to be grilled tilapia -- no sign of blackening whatsoever. The ""garlic and thyme sauce"" drizzles were more in the form of blobs with the consistency of apple sauce. And those were *red* potatoes? Really? They were so dry and charred it was hard to tell -- seemed more like breakfast home fries to me. Overall the food was OK, but just not up to what was being sold on the menu. Wasn't really worth the $12.49 to me. My wife ordered the ""Lemon Parmesan Shrimp"", which in the picture, looked like it would be half a plate of shrimp, and half a plate of rice. The actual end product was a very small portion of shrimp and the rice smushed out onto the plate so that it took up 3/4 of it. Again, the taste was OK, but seriously -- are you struggling that bad that you need to short people on the shrimp? A few minor complaints: Ketchup bottle at our table was empty, and we were not given enough silverware for our table. Not a big deal, but a little annoying considering how slow the place was when we got there. One of the biggest annoyances of the evening was that our server brought the check out without even asking if any of us wanted dessert or coffee -- and then she completely disappeared. It really felt like they were trying to rush us out of there so they could turn the table and get it ready for the later crowd that was starting to trickle in as we were leaving. After quite a while of visiting at the table, we finally tracked down the hostess and asked her to get our server so we could start another tab for desserts and coffee.  The desserts were good, but not good enough to pull this experience above 2 stars -- especially compared to Applebee's experiences I've had in the past. The flavor of the food may have been 3 to 4 stars, but the poor execution pulls it down for me. I'm not likely to return to this one... I'd rather head down the block to Red Robin."
Aaron H.,"Albany, OR",25,41,8,2.0,1/9/2015,"Let me preface this by starting out that my employer gave me a gift card to Applebee's, otherwise I would have probably gone somewhere else. I have had mediocre experiences with Applebee's in the past and had a similar expectation for this visit. I took my wife to lunch and were there just after they opened. The host was cordial and actually opened the door for us. However, he definitely had a script to follow (everything he said just came across as in-genuine). The employees were messing around with the stereo and kept changing the volume which made it difficult to have a conversation. As for the food, I ordered an the American Standard burger and my wife ordered the Classic burger. The food was good other than I actually had a couple of pieces of bone in my burger. I understand how hamburger is made but it's pretty rare to get bone in it anymore and these two pieces were around a centimeter long each. My wife actually complained to me that her burger had too much cheese on it which stuck to her mouth (and my wife likes cheese). Our server was nice and attentive. I wanted to put $20 on the gift card I had and the rest on my credit card so I could write in a tip. She said ""no problem"" and went to process the transaction. When she came back several minutes later, she informed me that she accidentally ran my credit card for another table's ticket, had to reverse that transaction and re-run it correctly. She handed me a stack of receipts, apologized and said that the reverse charge would probably post to my account in a day or so. I understand mistakes happen, but this visit to Applebee's absolutely fell into what I expected from them when I walked in the door. Unless you have a gift card burning a hole in your pocket, I would avoid this Applebee's in favor of somewhere else. There are plenty of other places close by with better food, atmosphere and service, Red Robin, No Baloney and Novak's (just to name a few)."
Ian M.,"Albany, OR",1,12,,1.0,1/9/2013,"While I was out one night I decided that I would stop for dinner at Applebees. I've been to Applebees more than a few times. The food was usually decent even if the service was lacking, but I was feeling motivated enough to eat there mostly due to a gift card I received. I ordered a steak with sauteed mushrooms and garlic mashed potatoes; my favorite dinner order there at the time.      My food arrived looking as good as always but it was when I took a few bites out of my steak that I noticed something unforgivable. As i chewed my food I noticed that the mushrooms were much more solid than they should have been. I checked the contents of my mouth only to find that with my mushrooms they had also cooked a nice chunk of cardboard. This was only complimented by the fact that my potato was completely under cooked.      Needless to say I will not be returning to Applebees again. One mistake would easily be forgiven as I have also worked with food, and I realize that mistakes happen. However, I was treated with bad service, bad food, and left wanting report the restaurant  to Food Safety."
Laura C.,"Albany, OR",0,10,,1.0,7/9/2013,"This Applebees is not one of our favorites. The few others we've been to before have been great. The service here was horrible, it was packed and we did not get seated for about 20 minutes, despite there being tables available. We were told from the host that he did not want to overwhelm the servers by seating us... which is about the most idiotic thing you could say to a customer. If the servers are overwhelmed by a busy restaurant, get rid of them. The customers comfort should be taken into account before a paid employee, sit us at a table and give us some menus! Anyway, we were greeted about 5 minutes after being seated from a server, he said he would be right with us. After another 10 minutes, we just got up and left. Nobody noticed us leaving or said a word to us.  At this point we were starving and most everything else was closed. We just went home, we'll never go back. If you're busy, hire more people, schedule more staff. Letting customers slip through the cracks because you want to save on labor costs is a pretty short-sighted way of doing business. This place is regularly busy, you are very lucky the people of Albany don't have many options. VERY lucky."
Eric P.,"Sweet Home, OR",45,349,265,3.0,12/31/2011,"Many people tend to bag on this place, and I am not really sure why. This is not the upper crust food store, and it never will be. However it is predictable and decent, and when one does not want to cook and have something that four very different eaters can all find something to eat, it is the place to go. I am appreciative of the light side menu for those of us, who still like the taste of food, but where it in our thighs or ass. As with everything these days, the prices are going higher and higher very quickly, yet the quality of the end product has remained the same. This is more a commentary of our government than of Applebee's. Lastly as many others have stated, in this sleepy little town there is not much else to choose from if you happen to be later than the normal dinner rush."
Ed s.,"Albany, OR",4,9,5,1.0,9/20/2013,that's right alienate all the Oregon State Beaver fans. I for one think who ever made the decision to place Oregon Ducks on the whole back wall and leave the Beavers completely out of the redecoration has lost their mind and should be removed from making any more decisions regarding this restaurant! I will take my business to a local place where they will at least give equal respect to both schools and fans!
Geoff P.,"Roswell, NM",163,198,64,1.0,2/14/2013,"The service in this place is horrible.  I have gone here three times to attempt to not be bias about a possible off night, and every night is an ""off"" night.  The manager runs around like he doesn't know what is going on, and doesn't help out at all.  Your drinks take forever to get.  Food is thrown on your table without you having a chance to ask for silverware, sauces, etc.  I'm done.  I even wrote a two page letter to the manager once and she gave me a $50 gift card to use and a wonderful apology.  I went back and the service was even worse.  I highly recommend you skip this place and go someplace, anyplace else.  Go to the one in Salem, the service at that one is great.  This place needs to be audited bad by corporate."
Todd B.,"Albany, OR",0,10,,1.0,12/31/2013,Wow what terrible food now. We went there for dinner tonight and was very disappointed with the food. My mom ordered the honey pepper chicken with the 4 cheese macaroni. There was no cheese taste or even appeared to be any cheese on there. I got the shrimp and wow I didn't even eat half. Would have been better off buying frozen shrimp from grocery outlet.
William L.,"Albany, OR",15,12,,3.0,11/8/2010,"Let's just say Applebee's is safe. At least in my experience it has always been predictable and I always get what I expect. My recent visit to the Albany Applebee's was with my wife and some friends and we went to eat and watch Oregon State play UCLA. We sat in the bar area where we could see the game. The bar tender was also our waiter and as expected he was friendly. My wife ordered chicken sliders which are an old menu item that can still be made. This is why I rate Applebee's as just okay. My wife and I go to Applebee's to get comfort food. These are foods that  are good because they are predictable. So when the menu changes and the items we come to rely on are dropped from the menu we no longer have a reason to eat there. This happened when Applebee's had onion peels on the menu and then were dropped. We didn't go to another Applebee's for at least 5 years. I ordered the the boneless chicken wings appetizer. This would end up being my dinner since I was pretty full after eating them. They were good and as expected, exactly the way I have ordered them in the past. My wife also had a Margarita which she claimed was very good.  Applebee's is also indicating on its menu healthy and low calorie options. I haven't tried these. If we go back I will need to try these and hopefully I will be able to raise my rating. Although I expect I will find something I like only to find out on the next visit it has been dropped from the menu."
Wiese A.,"Corvallis, OR",0,21,,2.0,12/20/2011,It's the only option after ten unless you want fast food jack in the box.  It really isn't anything to feel good about.  From sad faced bartenders that think they are pretty important to kitchen staff looking like they missed their parole hearings.  I had  a $10 slider/burger that was overcooked and really unimpressive.  The fries were decent after bartender/server was gracious enough to bring to me ketchup to cover up the taste of the burger.  And I had to get my own water refills from the pitcher on the bar because he seemed to pissed at the world to maintain even eye contact.
