Jazmin K.,"Alexandria, VA",6,37,1,5.0,10/26/2017,"I met up with a group of friends last week for the $1 Margaritas and had such a great time! I haven't been to Applebee's in probably 20 years and the girls there definitely gave my friends and I a good experience.  I wanted to take the time to recognize our server Britt who was quite busy with a few tables but did her best to accommodate all of her tables.  Though she took longer than I'm used to, to check on our table, what's most important is for all servers to understand that every night won't be easy, sometimes it will be a busy night, it isn't realistic to think that a server will get to you very quickly every night. Britt is only 1 person and for being as busy as she appeared she handled her load well and stayed very pleasant with not just our table but all of the tables she was helping. I also want to acknowledge Hazel and Tiara who were working behind the bar and all 3 of the ladies seem to work as a great team and have positive attitudes, definitely a relaxing environment. Thank you ladies !"
Stephanie B.,"Bonaire, GA",71,32,21,1.0,10/3/2017,If your looking for good food and good service don't look here.  We waited 20 minutes to be sat as the host conversed with other employees.  After we were sat we waited 30 minutes and didn't get greeted or asked if we wanted something.  40 minutes later we finally found a server and he took our order.  Let's see how much time we can waste on this disaster of a location.  #wewillnevercomeback #waitingfordays #applebeesfailure
Andrew C.,"Springfield, VA",30,28,6,1.0,1/7/2018,"We went tonight because we saw a commercial for the all you can eat ribs.  I haven't been to this location in a few years and was hopeful.  When we arrived we ordered our drinks and were off to a good start.  The food came out in a reasonable time and was all correct.  My wife asked for some dipping sauce for her chicken tenders and the waiter forgot to bring it to her.  We then started to eat and all of us were out of water.  It took about 10 minutes for the waiter to check on us and then he remembered the dipping sauce.  We asked for more water and some more ribs.  He then came back with one water.  We never got the second order of ""all you can eat"" ribs, it took over 25 minutes and we just gave up waiting for the food.  Now I remember why I had not gone to this place in several years...."
Gail B.,"Washington, DC",380,1223,1839,1.0,10/26/2017,"We stopped in with friends from out of town. There wasn't anyone waiting in the lobby and we could see empty tabletops at the bar and empty booths. The greeters said that there was a 20 minute wait. That didn't make any sense, unless they were short staffed. They weren't clear on why we had to wait, which would have helped us understand. I asked if we could wait at a booth, even if it took longer to place orders. The staff seemed reluctant to seat us ""early"" and even more reluctant to allow me to ask a manager if we could sit comfortably at a booth while waiting. So we left."
Kevin G.,"Alexandria, VA",5,148,236,3.0,6/24/2017,"It's not a grand meal in a city with multiple cuisines to choose from, but hey it's Applebee's the neighborhood bar grill. Every now and then you get the urge for something simple. The stir fry was actually pretty good and the quesadilla burger is the same as remembered. It may not be Cheers where everyone knows your name but it hit the spot for the day. So when you don't want to spend a lot and just need a quickie go to Applebee's."
Rachel A.,"Salem, OR",47,15,1,1.0,12/8/2017,Zero stars if we could. We walked in and were seated quickly.  We sat for 25 minutes and not a single staff member waited on us for drinks and or took our food order. We called the manager and he offered us a free appetizer or dessert on our next visit. We told him we would not be coming back to his restaurant ever again. His staff walked past us numerous times and we even made eye contact with them and they still refused to service us.
Josh L.,"Washington, DC",165,6,,1.0,12/2/2017,"Came in and was seated immediately. That's a good start, but was ruined by the fact that we sat for over 20 mins and no one said a word. No drinks ordered or anything. Not a word. We were ignored the entire time. Our visit came to a close when we eventually got fed up and left without ordering anything. This location needs better staffing and better service."
Lawan H.,"Washington, DC",9,1,,1.0,10/31/2017,If I could give a half a star. I came here for my sons birthday dinner on Halloween and the service was slow and our food came out cold. Antarctica cold!!! They need more wait staff especially on any kind of holiday. I don't care if it's donut day.. more wait staff!! We talked to the manager and she kept giving excuses about what she thinks it could be. I will not be going back to this Applebee's!
Tiana S.,"Washington, DC",69,3,,1.0,10/9/2017,I went to Applebees last night & the whole experience was horrible. From getting their waiting 20-25 minutes to be seated. When there was plenty of seating & only 1 party in front of us. The waiter was very slow & forgetful. And was unable to anticipate our needs without prompting. We waited for our food for at least an hour. The food was ok however it gave me food poisoning. I don't know if they were understaffed or what but that resteraunt is the worse. Haven't an experience that bad in a long time if I could give it 0 stars I would
Shaquana W.,"Alexandria, VA",0,9,1,1.0,11/1/2017,"Wish I could give zero stars this place is the worst!!! My first time here ever and the service was bad food was just meh... They made us wait for a table for like 5 minutes no problem there it's expected. Then we are escorted to our table only to find its dirty and hasn't been cleaned off. The waiter was meh he got us drinks took like 10 minutes, we placed our food order and like any normal place I wanted my apps first then my entree. But everything came out at once. Server never offered us refills or eating utensils (no forks, knives or napkins). After asking twice I gave up told him to put my food in a to go box and got out of there. If you ask him for anything it takes him forever to come back and he always comes empty handed. Just awful!! Don't go here!"
Moira H.,"Alexandria, VA",0,5,,5.0,11/30/2017,"It's a busy Thursday night, but we're being treated really well. There's a cool ""Order your appetizers"" like play station thing at the table. The manager came around to make sure we were being served well. I like this place a lot!!"
Patrick D.,"Lutherville-Timonium, MD",72,1,,1.0,8/19/2017,"This is my 2nd and last time ordering from this establishment. The first time I ordered from here they forgot to include my steak sauce. This time I came in to pick up my order and found that they'd given my order to another customer. Although they remade the order the manager was not apologetic at all. NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN! Just avoid this place, it's chaos"
Katherine L.,"La Mesa, CA",23,30,,1.0,10/21/2017,"The host with the long dreadlocks needs to be fired now! The rest of our experience here goes without saying. Holes on the walls, dirty booth tables, employees yelling at one another in front of customers, host berated my child as a ""joke"", and to top it off, we waited over 15 minutes and still no service! Left thinking that was the WORST Applebees I ever walked in to."
Damien L.,"Edgewater, MD",2,35,7,1.0,10/2/2017,Horrible service. Waiter smelt like cigarettes and he charged me for someone else's bill. I asked for a refund and to charge me the correct amount and the manager claimed that refund receipts don't exist.  Food took an hour to get and the margarita was watered down ridiculously....AVOID
Luz M. S.,"Alexandria, VA",22,2,,1.0,3/29/2017,"Decided to take my son for dinner here for his birthday. Waited 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge the fact that we were there, but she proceeded to give a table to a couple that came in after us"
Israel R.,"Arlington, VA",91,7,2,1.0,4/29/2017,20 minutes ans none has come our table even though this place is empty for a Saturday night
Jesus M.,"Dallas, TX",0,6,,1.0,6/18/2017,"Waited way to long for our waiter to serve us and the waiter was rude and not very attentive to what we were saying and forgot many of our orders, drinks came way after our appetizers and overall just plain bad."
Julia L.,"Collegeville, PA",119,1,,1.0,10/13/2017,"If zero stars was an option that is what I would rate this place. We had just driven in from philly to visit family that lives in this area, hungry from the drive we decided to visit this location due to the half priced apps we know and love but we didn't get that far. We asked for a table for 4, the hostess did not acknowledge us and disappeared for 5 minutes, came back and told us it would be a 45 minute wait. Now understand, we arrived at midnight, the place said it closed at 1 am.... there were also only 7 tables sat in the whole place. I am a server myself and know that you wouldn't be placed on this kind of wait, we asked the hostess if she was joking and yet again we were ignored. We then inquire if we can sit at the bar, yet again we are ignored. We ask two more times and nothing! So we walk to the bar ourselves. We wait at the bar for 10 minutes and no bartender in sight! At that point we gave up and left, but noticed on our way out that two servers were sitting at the host stand conversing with the hostess... funny how they have time to talk but don't have time to take care of a four top... definitely put a sour taste in mouth for the applebees brand."
Jessie C.,"Alexandria, VA",0,1,,5.0,10/17/2017,"Although it was monday night and it was busy as heck there we had fantastic service. They seemed kinda understaffed but our server (Dustin) was doing a fantastic job handling our section by himself. He was very very attentive and made sure we were taken care,of  frequently even though it seemed like he had 8 or 9 tables while running back and forth to the bar. Our food came out hot and delicious. (I had the full rack baby back with 4 cheese mac and french fries). All in all we had a great experience and we will be coming back not just for the food but to see Dustin again. Hes very cool and my kids really loved his pokemon tattoos! It was nice to also see the manager so hands on and helping out a lot."
Andrew S.,"Washington, DC",234,8,,1.0,2/14/2017,"If there was a .5 or 0 option I can assure you that would be more fitting. First, we were not helped for at least 15 minutes. It took 30 minutes or more to get our drinks. We finally ordered our food and my order was wrong after over an hour of waiting. My friend's steak was cold and straight rubber, his was also incorrect. We were then ignored for another 45 minutes. If you find yourself here, turn around... go to chillis. Anywhere else."
Malia L.,"Alexandria, VA",97,25,,1.0,1/6/2017,"Definitely won't be picking this place as our take out option. While running errands, we put in an order online, which said it'll take about 15 minutes. We pulled up and parked and had some waiting. Once it was a few minutes after our wait time, we headed inside, where the lady quickly said he'll be right out. We got back in the car and decided to give it another 10 minutes before going back in. Of course, time passed and our food was waiting. They were suppose to bring it to the car, but it wasn't a huge deal. The guy didn't seem too busy and could have easily brought it out since it was all paid for. Last but not least, we probably should have checked our food before we left. I had a cup of soup half empty and a burger with nothing on it. Hey, maybe there's a reason behind the poor service tonight, but safe to say we won't be returning again."
Evelyn P.,"Alexandria, VA",43,31,10,2.0,8/4/2017,"The food is okay, not many selections. Customer service needs A LOT of improvement. I sat for 15 minutes without even a sign of a waiter for water. After 20 min I decided to leave as no one came near our table. I have been before and hasn't been the greatest experience either. They are not a memorable place, rather go to McDonalds."
Shane H.,"Fort Washington, MD",0,11,,1.0,10/22/2016,Waited 10 minutes to be seated then 15 minutes for a waiter that was not a good people person  drinks sucks never go to this place keep driving its other restaurants in the area
Milan S.,"Washington, DC",0,2,1,1.0,1/21/2017,"I placed a order for pick up, and there was no one at the entrance to guide me to where I picked up my food so I had to find it myself. When I looked at my food my caesar salad was just lettuce and my steak was no where near well done!!!"
Penny W.,"Alexandria, VA",1,33,22,1.0,4/2/2017,"Ugh. I can't believe I did this to my own mother. She stayed over on 3/30, we were famished and It was too late to pick up from Outback. I decided to try the Applebees I've driven past for years. It was inedible and I regularly exist on food that I can microwave. We ordered the Bourbon Street Steak with Crispy Red Potatoes and a Triple Chocolate Meltdown to share. The steak looked like roadkill that had baked in the sun for months; it was placed on a bed of slimy, onions and mushrooms floating in a puddle of grease. I had to inspect the mound of filaments to distinguish the mushrooms from the onions. The red potatoes were dry and shriveled.The chocolate dessert was stale and would be a distant second to a hostess cupcake on its best day. The vanilla ice cream we did eat but didn't enjoy...I can only describe it as cheap tasting. I picked up this order yet still experienced crappy service. I waited at the hostess stand for a few minutes but was not acknowledged. I then asked a server where to pick up food and was told to ask the bartender. I then waited at the vacant bar for a few minutes and stared at a group of employees chatting while the packaged food was on the bar aging further. (I know that people sometimes receive nasty food and service when they order a minute before the restaurant closes but this Applebees was scheduled to be open for another hour and thirty minutes.)"
Austin C.,"Fort Lesley J. McNair, DC",53,17,5,1.0,10/15/2016,"Super disappointed recently visited this location for take out food. Waited an hour (they weren't very busy at all). I ordered my food at 3 PM so definitely not the dinner rush. They messed up 2 orders, and forgot to give me my salad and one meal. I was so frazzled by the time you left I couldn't bring myself to go back in and ask for the remainder. All this occurred AFTER I spoke with the manager and he offered me a discount for my next visit. THERE WILL NOT BE A NEXT VISIT!!"
Melissa L.,"Sandwich, MA",0,1,,1.0,5/13/2017,"I had a gift card and tried to order car-side service online. The card number I had was not recognized by the online system. I called the restaurant and a manager helped me weave through the maze of ordering options. Turns out that d dry rubbed baby back ribs that didn't have the fries with it as promised. The ribs were dry and splintery. The pig was already dead, they didn't have to kill it again. The sauce was a combination of mustard, ketchup and some A-1 sauce...for $18.99. Never again."
Phil T.,"Matthews, NC",0,5,,5.0,2/3/2017,"The food was AMAZING! Went with my entire family, had a great server and everything came out in time, overall the place was clean and the waiters were very polite, no complaints for this one."
Rob S.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,1,,1.0,1/23/2017,Very horrible experience.  Bad service from pregnant manager and host.  We got sat in dirty section and dirty table .  manager she didn't care she said k let me wipe it . she should of sit us different table.   Her attitude was bad and fake smile with fake gesture.
Andreas L.,"Strasburg, VA",14,4,,2.0,5/13/2017,The food was good but the service was only ok. They gave us plastic utensils. This is a sit down restaurant...I am not paying for plastic. The margarita was mostly ice vs drink which was too sweet and they charged $9. Since when is ice $9?
Marianne L.,"Alexandria, VA",225,620,330,2.0,11/30/2013,"We had a good meal here and will probably be back as Mom likes them and there are none where she lives (plenty of tv ads though). But a somewhat shady experience when the bill came is costing a 3rd star, and likely will for continued visits. Bottom line - add up your bill. Make sure the total at the far away bottom is actually what it should be - and watch out for hinky explanations from the management. After catching an afternoon flick, Mom wanted to come here for dinner. I did give the menu an advance scouting to make sure I could fine something that would fit in with my healthier eating habits (hey, at least I try) but it's Mom so of course we're going to go here if she wants to. We greeted upon entering and the hostess kindly took notice of our request to be seated away from the arctic tundra that was the entry way to a nice booth on the non-bar side of the restaurant, where we might actually be able to see what we were eating. Our friendly waiter joined us to take our drink order a few minutes later and to see if we were ready to order or had questions. Mom opted for the 4-cheese Mac & Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders. Sometimes you just got to love your Mom who chooses the one thing on the menu you're dying to have - but won't because you simply know what a nutritional catastrophe its bound to be. So she ordered it and I got to try it :-)  Works for me. I ordered the garlic sirlion (rare - expecting at best to receive med-rare).  We also  indulged in some Green Bean Crispers, one of my favorite apps - if not the healthiest of selections :-) Our entrees came and sadly my steak was very well done, couldn't have gotten a drop of juice out of it if I tried. I flagged the waiter down and let him know. Every business handles this situation a bit different - and I could see the waiter struggling for a moment not wanting to leave one patron with nothing to eat while the other dined or their meal got cold. I was always taught the proper thing was to replace the entire dish - since the sides are meant to be eaten with the main. But the waiter took away my steak only, leaving the mushroom and and roasted red potatoes. In short order, a nice rare sirloin arrived back at the table. Everything was fine until the check arrived. Mind you, I'd never once asked that my meal be comped so I was quite surprised to see that directly below the line for my steak dinner, the value had been deducted. Problem was - after I scanned down through 5+ inches of nonsense about gift cards, diner survey numbers, and whatnot - there to my surprise at the bottom of the slip was the total not up at the top under the itemized order.  This is a bit weird. I'm not an infrequent dinner and am used to inches of nonsense that I immediately ignore but that all usually comes AFTER the part that belongs on the check in the first place. I'm glad I'm good at doing math in my head as the total was far too high for 1 entree, 1 app and 2 drinks. The 2nd entree that had been deducted at the top was mysteriously added back in at the bottom.  The waiter was perplexed, understanding immediately that the bill clearly wasn't right. So he brought the manager over and quickly explained the problem. The manager gave some song and dance about it wasn't a comp that is how the corrected order had to be put into the kitchen. I call BS, though I clearly don't know how Applebee's POS system works. But if the order had to be put in again and then backed out so the kitchen would know to refire 1. why did the plate not come out complete (OK the waiter may have stuck his head in and said meat only), but of more concern 2. why weren't there 2 orders for my entree on the bill and one backed out. Frankly I think they tried to make it look like they'd comped it hoping I wouldn't notice that it was sneakily stuck back in way at the bottom."
Diana P.,"Alexandria, VA",0,5,1,2.0,5/28/2017,2 stars is about right for this place. Usually bad wait staff and food is lackluster.
Toby I.,"Alexandria, VA",65,8,,1.0,7/2/2016,"Worst Applebees experience, EVER! Hostesses argued in front of us, over where to seat us. One wanted to seat us immediately, and the other wanted us to wait 10-15 minutes. Waiter was nice, but had no working knowledge, AT ALL! Food came out lukewarm, at best. Had to ask repeatedly for drink refills."
Jeremy G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",31,4,2,5.0,10/7/2016,Food was good! Waiter brought food and drinks promptly and then danced to ain't no other man. What more can you ask for?
Linda A.,"Springfield, VA",18,29,2,2.0,7/11/2016,"I came here with my daughter. The hostess seated us promptly. However, the rest of the visit was lackluster. Service was slow and spotty. I had to ask for a cup for my daughter's milk, a spoon for the yogurt. The food was decent but I won't be returning. Too many other really good places around."
Miss Foodie M.,"New York, NY",0,199,19,2.0,5/28/2016,"This place has two stars. Yep thats accurate. Customer service was poor. Servers yell at eachother from across the restaurant. I asked my server if the Cedar chicken had apples and she responded "" I dont know."" She made no attempt to ask anyone for me or to do her job effectively. The manager brought out our entrees and we were not done with our appetizers, I hate that. When I commented on that he said sorry then walked away. Our server had to leave at 4pm and we knew this because she yelled it to her coworker. Our check was brought out before we finished our meal which was fine but then shortly after another server asked us if we were done. It was obvious we were still eating. The staff needs customer service training."
YoYo J.,"Alexandria, VA",29,27,98,2.0,9/26/2015,"Honesty, we come here out of habit. You will not receive extraordinary service, your food will not be revered enough to post to your instagram feed. It is what it is. Applebee's. Expect kinda slow service, decent margaritas, and the 2 for 20 deal. Yay for the mundane and semi inexpensive."
Jade T.,"Silver Spring, MD",155,13,41,3.0,5/2/2016,The food was great but the establishment definitely needs an upgrade. Service was slow at the bar but the steak with shrimp parm topping is simply delicious.
Paige M.,"Fort Washington, MD",48,34,39,5.0,7/15/2015,"This is my favorite Applebee's. I'm a little surprised by all the negative reviews that they have. I feel that I am treated like family every time I walk into the restaurant. I try to go to this place as much as I can. We go so much that we have a favorite waiter named Donna. We decided to adopt her into our little family. My mom calls her niece. We don't get her all the time, and we used to be sad when we couldn't get her. It's hard to make that kind of relationship with a waiter.  The first thing I found out was that even when we do not have her, we are still having a great time. The food comes out great, and my drink never empties. The manager Ray has been there for as long as I can remember. If your having a concern, speak with him and he will see that everything turns out ok. We have gone so many times that we must have used at least all of the waiters by now. I just can't wait to go back next time, and get wonderful service and food ((Recommend the Mozzarella Stick, the sauce is not the nasty chunk kind. My new favorite entree is the Bourbon Street Steak w/ Red Potatoes - Only 19 Points with Weight Watchers)) [Noted to Self: Don't forget to check in next time.]"
Jill M.,"Springfield, VA",3,26,4,1.0,4/24/2016,"I guess I have to give you 1 star because Yelp won't allow me to go any lower!  First we went around 3 pm and the place had 7 chain smokers at the bar   Needless to say it was a nasty ass smell.  We decided to go because we had $100 worth of gift cards.  The food was sub par.  Super nasty! They put some sauce on my sandwich which I asked for it not to be on there and the waitress was super pissed they needed to remake the item.  I am a big girl so this is in no way to mean but our waitress was so out of shape she was sweating, huffing, and really didn't want to take any extra steps to make sure our items were correct.  I even went to her at the waitress station about my item so she wouldn't need to walk!  The company needs to rethink their service plan. Some people aren't meant to be waitresses.   We had 50 bucks left on gift cards.  I gave them to a friend to use up.  The root beer from ibc was great. M I see Applebee's going belly up.  Don't waste your time there is a chili and a Friday up the street.  Stay far away you will regret going."
