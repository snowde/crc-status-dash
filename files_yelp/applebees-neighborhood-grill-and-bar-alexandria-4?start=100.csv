John P.,"Washington, DC",1,10,,4.0,12/22/2011,Half-price appetizers after 10pm.  Nuff said.
rosa b.,"Washington, DC",2,14,,2.0,6/2/2011,"I went here last Saturday, and low and behold, I found a line waiting to get in?  I'm never willing to wait to get into a national chain.  But for once, I decided to.  I shouldn't have.  It was exactly what I expected.  The chicken was tough and over-cooked.  The vegetables tasted like microwave food.  The service was confused.  At times I wasn't sure who my server was, and the one who I think was our server was in an argument with another server.  Atmosphere?  Cliche.  My recommendation is to not bother.  Speed?  One would think that the service would be speedy, but it wasn't.  We waited forever for food.  I would avoid this place."
steven a.,"Alexandria, VA",2,24,,1.0,10/7/2012,"If this restaurant is any indication of the health of the chain, I foresee Chapter 11 in their future. The service was terrible. Nearly as bad as the food. I will NEVER NEVER subject my family to this restaurant again"
brad j.,"Fort Belvoir, VA",14,32,,2.0,2/19/2008,"Just another freaking Applebee's. Bring your SCUBA gear, this one's smokey smokey.  I got the nachos, which I usually like from Applebee's because they have cheese sauce, not real cheese, which dries up and sticks all of the chips together. But once again, I was either overchipped or undergoodied.  Because less than halfway through, I was checking underneath dry chips to see if there were any non-dry chips left.  Nope, just more dry ones. My wife got this thing from the weight watchers menu, which she says was 'not as good as steak night' at the officers' club, but not bad.  It looked okay, but I suspect that the sauce on the steak was mass produced by children at the Applebee's factory.  The vegetables were probably frozen. Just overall uninspiring.  Not sure why I'm bothering to write what everybody already knows.  Applebee's is a decent place to get food when you don't feel like cooking it yourself."
Rowland S.,"Alexandria, VA",10,29,7,1.0,10/19/2008,This used to be a decent Applebee's.  It would appear that they have tried to cut costs a little too much.  The service was alright but the food was just plain GROSS.  It is hard to mess up pasta but they managed it.  Avoid this place like a dark ally in Adams Morgan.
Marcus A.,"Woodbridge, VA",1,49,6,2.0,3/20/2012,"Recently I went with some of my friends to Applebee's.  Usually Applebee's is a favorite amongst us, but this time none of us was impressed.  It started out when we first walked in.  There was a man (the manager?) who was standing at the front of the restaurant, looked at us and didn't have the decency to even greet us.  Finally someone came and sat us down.  Once we sat down our table was noticeably sticky.  It took asking 3 times before the table was finally cleaned.  At this point we are leery of the service.  Once we ordered our food, the food was actually good and probably the saving grace because our waitress rarely came back to check on us and did not keep up with our refills.  Needless to say this was a very underwhelming visit.  I'm not sure what the problem is with this restaurant but I sensed a horrible vibe from the staff.  This was definitely not a place that I would want to come back to.  They have lost a customer."
