Kevin S.,"Alexandria, VA",12,1,,1.0,4/29/2016,"Absolutely terrible! Waitress told us the special ""wasn't activated on her terminal"" and that we probably just shouldn't get it. What kind of service is that?!"
Susie K.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,36,12,1.0,4/16/2016,"We dined here last night. The food tasted bland to us compared to other Applebee locations we visited. We used our credit card to pay for the bill and this morning we were notified by the bank that our credit card was used in Africa and Ohio. Really scary stuff. The only time the credit card left our sight was when waiter took it to the register, so you figure it out. We did not use our card anywhere else after dinning at this location."
Christina G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,5,,1.0,5/2/2016,"I was really disappointed by this location when we stopped by last night. We have 4 kids and need 2 high chairs. When I told the host, I was rudely told ""you're just going to have to wait"" (which I expected on a Sunday afternoon). After helping 3 parties of 6-8 people who came in after us, they showed us to the low 4 top in the bar. With one highchair added. Which still wasn't enough seats, not to mention enough room for everyone's plate. We said we'd be ok with waiting for a larger table to open up but were told ""I don't think we can do that"". I don't think we will be returning to this location."
Louie L.,"Clarksville, TN",44,68,37,3.0,3/14/2016,"I gave this place 3 stars because the server and the bartender were friendly...their wings is good...I always order chicken and shrimp Alfredo on penne...the Alfredo sauce is really good but what I'm upset about is both time I ordered for to go, I always ask for extra Alfredo sauce and they would charge me extra, which is fine...but when I get home and look inside the container, there isn't any extra sauce...my penne would look a little dry...it happened twice!!! Like how can you charge me something extra and not give me what I ordered!!!"
Samnang S.,"Washington, DC",134,52,4,1.0,3/13/2016,"Told us it'll be a 10-15 minutes wait but we waited 30 minutes only to find out that they had a ton of space! Manager from 03/12 night should be fired, no apologies or anything. Never coming back to this awful location."
Lendsey C.,"Alexandria, VA",153,245,472,3.0,12/31/2014,"I don't usually review chain places unless there's a need to. There is a need to tell you that Applebees has seriously stepped up their food game. I don't know what other locations are like, admittedly I've only eaten at the same location multiple times, but while the service is still a little slow the menu items are worth the wait. Their new lunch specials of strawberry & avocado salad and artisan grilled chicken on ciabatta in proper portion sizes shows their commitment to making healthier lunch options is front and center.  So if you can skip the pizza and limp foot long subs, I'd say swing into an Applebees for surprising and safe menu upgrades."
Lake J.,"Alexandria, VA",0,26,14,1.0,6/26/2015,"After Chilis was totally packed for happy hour, ventured down a bit to Applebys. What a mistake!  Service??  No service is more like it.  Our waiter took our order and vanished...  The order was fulfilled on demand by any server that walked by. Manager say in a corner socialising with his staff.  I want to work at this Applebys!  I can pull in a pay check AND hang with my friends and post pictures to Facebook while texting. Just drive on by this Applebys!"
Adam E.,"Poneto, IN",0,23,5,4.0,12/27/2016,"Upon entering the establishment, I noticed the floor. It was not clean, nor was it dirty. It was a simple floor. The booth in which I was promptly seated had a rather noticeable and large scratch on the side of it, forcing me to Sit on the inside. Upon taking a detour to inspect the men's facility, my nose was vilely assaulted by a putrid aroma emanating from one of the waste disposal machines. As far as staffing is concerned, The waitress remembered my order from nearly a year ago. However this event took place before before I was a expert yelp critic. So it will not positively or negatively impact the final score . I arrived just before lunch hour, so the floor was noticeably underwhelming. Therefore the agonizing wait for a simple glass of water is simply inexcusable. my drink eventually arrived, thus the agonizing wait for my appetizer begins.  Agonizing is most certainly the correct word I could've possibly used to describe to use to describe the wait for my appetizer, this would have been most certainly a deduction, if not for the simply exquisite and outstanding taste brought on by The food. My entre was brought out in a similar fashion as the rest of my food.overall this is a wonderful place to patron. Unfortunately the wait times for everything was enough to deduct a star from the overall outcome. I had to simply wrestle with the pepper shaker in order to get a simple spurt. All that aside, my waitress was simply divine"
Kenneth D.,"Alexandria, VA",0,4,,1.0,11/13/2016,"Zero stars is not available, they should change that. True story - We we're greeted at the door, just asked 'How many?' Followed the server who didn't know where he was going, then waited about 10 minutes after being seated to be asked about drinks. 15 minutes later he came back to take our food order (still hadn't gotten our drinks). While we waited, we listened to the servers curse and argue, good times. Another 15 minutes goes by and our food arrives, all except for my wife's food. I also ordered a salad that never came, but at this point I let it go. I waited until my food was cold to ask the server (who spent the whole time at the register) about my wife's food. He came back to say they forgot about it and he would wrap it to go and take it off the bill. It came out swiftly...on a plate, not wrapped. He then brought us the bill...complete with the salad I never received. Amazing. Simply amazing. Save yourself, the irritation. Find another Applebee's."
Tony H.,"Vienna, Austria",107,2,,1.0,3/27/2016,The most terrible experience I've ever had in applebees. Terrible food terrible service. How would you tell your waitress that the food is terrible and all she says is yeah thats how it is and lifts her shoulders not knowing what else to say or do.
John W.,"Alexandria, VA",0,5,,1.0,7/18/2016,"What an awful experience. Went there today fir lunch only like 3 people in the entire place. Got seated and realized the air conditioning wasnt cooling very well. Servers was seated at a table paying no attention to the guests.  After 5 minutes  we decided to leave. As we were leaving we told the servers we were going somewhere else because the air conditioning didn't seem to be working and they were too busy on break to wait on customes. One of the servers responded ""That's cool, Bye"".  Never going to anorher Applebees ever."
Andrea C.,"Alexandria, VA",4,1,,1.0,3/24/2015,"Food was okay. Service was bad. Very shady billing/business practices. More detail below. Receipt that was brought for signature charged for more than the original, correct receipt. When asked for a correction they said they ""couldn't give us our money back"" despite the fact we hadn't signed for it yet.  I'm not usually the type to speak to managers, but when I did, he seemed defensive about it and solved nothing. Ended up paying for something we never got. Very shady business, ended up canceling the card I used just in case. Total scam."
J P.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,22,5,1.0,11/3/2015,"My girlfriend and I came here about a year ago.  I deleted the memory from my mind but they are now running a $6.99 burger and fries deal on Monday... Which intrigued me, then I realized how horrible my last experience was and decided to write a review. Long story short. HORRIBLE service, the server forgot our APP order.  Then my beer was less than cold.  Then my shrimp pasta was salted beyond belief. The breadstick was obviously microwaved. Then my girlfriends STEAK literally tasted like a breakfast sausage. Simply horrible. How do you mess up steak? Salt, pepper, 2.5 minutes one side and flip. I wish I didn't have this experience, I would probably give it a shot otherwise. I would rather eat McDonald's."
Youngking W.,"Alexandria, VA",36,1,,1.0,12/28/2015,Waiters were good but food was delivered wrong and manager took entirety long to fix the issue I had to walk pit and leave and only pay for my drink I don't recommend anyone to come here unless the want a good drink from the bar
Alexandra K.,"Alexandria, VA",85,43,66,3.0,7/3/2015,"It wasnt anything special but not bad either. The service was good and for the most part, food came out in a timely manner. Usually, when I go to an applebees, theres sports memorabilia on the walls but this one had alot of old pictures of celebrities instead. The waiter was very attentive, however, my boyfriend and I are the type of diners who sort of prefer getting our food and being checked on once or twice. She did it like 10 times but I understand its because another diner complained about her service. No big deal!!! The food was good, the sirarcha shrimp was better than I expected, wontons that came with it was crispy and great. Worth a try. The rest of the food was decent and I would go back. It was out of our way from where we lived but we weren't disappointed."
Carl W.,"Arlington, VA",109,56,,2.0,2/26/2014,"I do not care for Applebee's in general but I somehow ended up with a $15 gift card and an empty stomach so I went. It was Applebee's and I did not have high expectations and those low expectations were met. Nothing was outright bad - neither the food nor the service - but nothing was very good either. I had a Reuben sandwich and a salad. They were fine. It is hard to screw up a Reuben but it is easy to not add any character to it. It was not what you would call good, but also not bad. It filled my belly. That is about all I can say for it. The service was slow, considering it was past the lunch rush and I was one of perhaps ten customers. I won't be back unless I end up with another gift card on a day I forgot to bring lunch to work. Funny - I once dated a woman who LOVED Applebee's and thought it was a great place. It was a short-lived relationship. It is like saying you love mediocrity, laugh tracks and blandness. I guess someone has to love that sort of thing. Like my great-grandmother used to say, there's no pot made so crooked you can't find a lid to fit it."
Laura D.,"Alexandria, VA",10,17,3,4.0,10/31/2015,Good food and service. Not a complaint at all. I had the fiesta lime chicken and it was good. My husband had the chicken fingers and they were good. The brownie bites are yummy.
Summer B.,"Alexandria, VA",3,57,180,1.0,5/26/2015,"Oh my god, ridiculous. Just a ridiculous place, ridiculous food, ridiculous service, ridiculously dirty, ridiculous."
Dee P.,"Alexandria, VA",13,14,2,3.0,8/16/2015,The only reason I am even giving 3 stars is because the staff is so friendly. Applebee's does a lot of price changes and not notify anyone. One day your drink is 3.00 then next 5.00.
Lateashea L.,"Washington, DC",83,1,,2.0,5/7/2016,The service was extremely slow and the staff wasn't friendly at all. The food came out hot which was plus
