Milton P.,"Washington, DC",20,33,5,5.0,8/6/2015,Seems like this is my wife's favorite place now to eat. She is in love with their apple sangria drink! I like the atmosphere and service! I usually have the Bourbon steak with roasted potatoes...some kind of good!
John D.,"Lorton, VA",76,7,2,4.0,7/30/2015,"This Applebee's location has really stepped up their game. For awhile it seemed as if the place would flop due to the characters who worked at the establishment. That has all changed greatly. I frequently go to this location now, especially if a ball game is on. The food has always been reliable and the service is 1000x better. With football season approaching I would recommend any fan to take tailgate festivities to this location. Especially on Mondays for Burger Night."
Marla R.,"Kendall Park, NJ",1,21,,1.0,12/27/2013,This was one if the worst Applebee's we have been to.  We normally try to have local cuisine while on vacation but wanted something quick and easy. They do not have items our Applebee's has on the menu. We asked for mild boneless wings and got hot ones. Then they never took the empty basket from our table.  The baked potato was not fully cooked and it took forever to get butter and sour cream to go along with it. Maybe they thought the potato would finish cooking while we waited!  Much better choices in the area even if you are looking for a chain.
Michael C.,"Alexandria, VA",2,88,62,2.0,4/20/2013,"This is the most accurate, precise, and unbiased review for Applebee's at the 6310 Richmond Highway location.  First of all, I am not new to Applebee's.  I have been to several across the United States and even one outside the United States.  For the most part I have had great experiences.  Their Bourbon Street Steak is one of the greatest entree's in this restaurant category - when prepared correctly of course.  But this isn't about the past.  This is about today. I ordered my food for Curbside To Go today and one of the entrees was the 9 oz House Sirloin with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables.  During the call my order was taken and was even recommended to get the 2 for $20 deal since I put in orders for 2 separate meals.  The other was Chicken Penne.  Anyways, I was told 15 minutes and I got there in 18 minutes.  I noticed that unlike every other Applebee's, they don't ask you for the color or make of your car.  You see, in most Applebee's, they actually come out to your car.  That is the entire point of Curbside To Go.   Well, I didn't sit out in my car waiting like a doofus.  It was obvious that I had to walk in myself.  I noticed the place was about half full but had a musty smell.  Looked very old and dim.  Keep in mind this was at 2:40pm on a Saturday where it is super sunny outside.  The bartender got my order and I checked out.  All is good right?  WRONG! Before I say what's wrong, let me tell you that I'm cutting for the summer so I obviously have the worst nightmare to all restaurant chains that give meal sizes in terms of weight - a digital scale!  As I look at my supposedly ""9 oz"" steak, it looks really small.  It must be the most dense steak in the history of cows or I just got hosed.  I take the steak and place it on my scale (that is tared already) and what does it read?  5.35 oz!!!  I kid you not.  So I'm thinking maybe they charged me for a 7 oz steak and the cook got a really fatty piece and maybe he cut it a little short.  WRONG!  I was charged for a 9 oz.  It makes me wonder what a 7 oz would look like?  A chicken nugget?   I just ate everything and so far so good.  Who knows what will happen later.  All I know is that I was expecting 9 oz.  Now I'm going to have to fix a protein shake to make up for the loss!"
Mèo Béo T.,"Alexandria, VA",5,3,6,1.0,2/22/2015,"I love Apple Bees but today is our worst experience ever. We orderd a trios appertizer and a $25 for two deals so we have total 2 appertizers. Both are wings but the waiter'd never asked which sauce we want. However, the second wings order never came out. The waiter name Lawrence NERVER check on us during our dinner. We didn't have either our second wings appertizer or have our water refilled during dinner time. However, he did check on the table next to us and pass us real quick that we had no chance to say anything. Finally we had a chance ( after we finished our dinner)  to ask him for refills and remind him that second wings did not come, he said ""uh oh""  then brought us wings with sauce on the surface is TOTALLY DRY OUT. Worse, he took our glasses for refill but never give it back. We hopelessly asked for our bills and leave. My friends were verry upset and we will not come back to this location anymore."
Erin M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,24,6,5.0,3/21/2016,"I was wary of going to this location because of the mixed reviews but I am glad I did. We went for lunch on Saturday. Jessica S. was our server and she managed multiple tables well. She was friendly and efficient and brought our food as it came out. I was pleased with the wait time and the temperature of our food. We ordered an appetizer, two entrees and a kids meal. I would go again!"
Joseph M.,"Northern, VA",28,238,3,1.0,2/17/2015,"One star because they have awesome mudslides. But, the greasy food that'll leave you with a stomach ache, bizarre servers, nasty customers you'd expect to see on Cops, weird smell, bad vibe, dirty interior, not so safe neighborhood, and a bar that feels like a holding area at county lock-up. Me thinks not.. People including servers are always verbally fighting in here when I've come in. ""Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!"""
Nasus H.,"Alexandria, VA",0,5,,5.0,2/9/2016,I love how Applebee's provide free meals for veterans on Veteran's Day. I come here for lunch every year for Veteran's Day. I sit at the bar and always receive outstanding service from the bartender. The food is very delicious and seasoned perfectly. Can't wait till this Veteran's Day!
Tom F.,"Evans Mills, NY",1,2,,1.0,10/26/2014,"Worst service I ever received in my 26 years on this earth. Our waitress was rude, didn't introduce herself or say hi, never checked on us, looked mad when we asked for refills, and never said thank you or good bye. If I ever come back to FT Belvoir, I'm never going to this Applebee's again."
Brandi S.,"Alexandria, VA",1,44,3,2.0,8/7/2014,"The service at this applebees is consistently slow. The staff doesn't seem rude or anything, just un-attentive and even on slow times they just don't seem to care that much. Really not a great place if you are trying to be served."
Crystal-Nicole B.,"Springfield, VA",18,57,1,3.0,8/14/2014,Came to this location to eat lunch and found the service to be fine and the food good. Nothing to write home about really. Didn't expect much and wasn't disappointed.
Tyler R.,"Philadelphia, PA",94,222,58,1.0,4/23/2012,"What a surprise- I found myself at an applebees on a Friday night in Alexandria, VA. This was not your typical Applebee's, or maybe it is. We entered looking for a seat at the bar. Seeing that it was full, we took seats at a table adjacent. The server was polite and took our drink orders quickly.  That's when the excitement happened. First, a large group entered and was seated around us (four to one side and one person to the other). This influx of people must have attracted much attention. A man peddling balloon animals approached their table as a Kevin Costner movie (during a soft core scene) played in the background. He made two large heart-shaped flowers for the women at the nearby table. This happened while I waited for my salad and beer.  Unfortunately, the woman seated at our left had an undercooked burger, and she made it well known. The manager came over, and it just so happened to be the balloon animal artist! His presence drew my attention to the bar where he was stationed. There sat a man worth a glorious mullet flirting with a waitress. Clearly this place had everything. The salad I had was fine, though over dressed (they did use sesame oil or sesame flavor in the dressing) and over priced ($11) for a lot of lettuce and sliced almonds with crispy chicken bits sprinkled about.  I was left underwhelmed, so I took advantage of their half price appetizers and ordered onion rings.  They came, but were first served to the table next to us by a waitress who had her purse and was leaving for the night. When they got to the right place, it turned out there were a few shrimp mixed in. The onion rings themselves were pretty bad- all deep fried breading and no onion. The BBQ sauce served with it was sugary and awful. Thankfully, there was Heinz ketchup on the table.   As I finished the onion rings, I requested the check. The woman to our left received her re-cooked burger as I signed. She proclaimed it was still raw, and my friend and I decided it was prime time to go."
Jerry T.,"Madison Heights, VA",35,14,6,4.0,2/19/2013,"Arrived at 5:00 , was promptly greeted and seated. Our waitress was helpful and very nice, not overly anxious but came around enough to service our needs. The sizzling nawlins skillet was great... Would definitely recommend !!!"
Nick A.,"Alexandria, VA",104,246,6,4.0,10/31/2012,"I'm not one for these sorts of chains - and not for Applebee's in particular. I was out shopping and I was starving, and this was the first thing that I saw, so I decided to sack up and give it a shot. The food was standard fare, but that's not what this is about. The service was outstanding. I mean just great. It was lunchtime on a Saturday, and they were pretty busy. Nonetheless, the service was fast, pleasant, and efficient. The manager took the time to stop at every table and see how the meal was going, and my waitress was stellar. I'm not sure how service is at other times, but this was fantastic, maybe even enough to change my mind about Applebee's. But no, probably not."
Dom B.,"Alexandria, VA",4,26,,1.0,5/29/2013,"Good cheese sticks. Poor pasta. Ok chicken strips. Worst service ever.  Waitress checked once after 45 minutes, when we asked for the check. I'm typing this review as I wait for her to pick up my credit card. It's been 15 minutes and counting."
Tammy B.,"Hollidaysburg, PA",0,1,,1.0,9/10/2015,We were just at this applebee's the food was ok but everything went downhill when we paid with a $100. bill and our waitress Kershaw said we gave her a $50.bill. We asked to see the manager she said she checked her book and she didn't have a $100. my guess she already pocketed it. And yes I am 100% sure we give her $100.!!!!
Georgia B.,"Alexandria, VA",2,18,10,3.0,4/17/2014,Applebee's has a great menu and reasonably priced I would definitely say! However I went to this location a couple weeks ago with a few friends and our waiter was terrible. Let's start with the overall attitude and also we all felt rushed to order like he kept coming back every minute or 2 literally asking if we were ready like come on man give us some time more than a dam minute!!!  Also we requested split bills (3) however we got 2 bills so that had to be corrected. One of my friends also had a online appetizer coupon and was told she could use it but then was charged full price on her tab so that also had to be corrected! Anyhow on a good note prices are good and I think Applebee's has the best steak compared to it's competitors such as Fridays ruby Tuesday etc.  I didn't care for the service here at all but the prices and good are good that's why I will give it 3 stars.
Lance H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",39,24,8,2.0,3/10/2011,"I love Richmond Highway, and all that it has to offer. Applebee's is Applebee's wherever you go, but it's the staff that sets one apart from the other.  I went in to kill some time with a couple beers and was sat as a dirty bar, with a bartender that seemed to want to bitch about co-workers more than talk with customers.  There are other, way better, places to go in this area."
Ashley K.,"Alexandria, VA",0,2,,1.0,6/1/2015,Awful customer service and understaffed. Will not be coming here again and will make applebees a last resort option from now on. Asked for our bill and to box our food and that took 30 extra minutes.
Rick G.,"Phoenix, AZ",998,396,11390,2.0,2/20/2013,"Other Applebee's in area are better!  When I know the restaurant's a big box national chain, I cringe at the inevitable automaton staff, factory dish and production ! This patron's opinion of dining here both validated my fears, and proved to be a somewhat unpleasant experience compared to other Applebee's in the region! Although I obviously don't pretend to have tried everything on the menu, what limited portions I and those with me did have, showed that their food preparation, cooking and attention to detail and quality, did not hit the mark, although the service was fairly good, it appeared to me overall to be short of adequate, to say the least! I am sure you'll find other Applebee's better elsewhere as I have, and urge you to do your homework if you really want a worthwhile experience, attentive service and quality dishes. Bon appétit!"
