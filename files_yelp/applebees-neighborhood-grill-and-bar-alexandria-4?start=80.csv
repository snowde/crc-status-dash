Melissa R.,"Lancaster, PA",2,1,,1.0,11/25/2013,Don't go for food. Drinks are ok. But the food is bad. I've eaten Applebees before and I can say this location is bad.  I had the 9oz sirloin with mashed taters and mixed veggies.   Steak was bad and not medium like I ordered. Veggies were mush.  Potatoes were good.  Would I come back.  Nope.
Ce N.,"Owego, NY",23,5,,1.0,3/28/2014,"The service is horrible, the staff is rude, I found hair in my food, and had to wait over an hour for a kids quesadilla because the server dropped the first one. I will never go to this location again"
Carla C.,"Annandale, VA",3,11,,2.0,8/21/2014,"Never again! Honestly I never thought I was going to get horrible service from a manager I forgot his name but I remember it started with a C, he was our server, anyways i was with my boyfriend at the bar, at the cocktails tables food came out great, and for cheap prices and also we had drinks and they're  good prices as well so that's why I'm giving them a two starts just because there app and drinks are cheap. When we were eating we decided to order a sangria and wings and the wings didn't come out it was already 15 minutes  if I didn't get up I'm sure it would if been more the restaurant was super slow, so there no excuse!!!! The sangria was sitting at the bar and no one decided to get it even the manager walked by it like four times and sits down the table next to us, it was just very rude and didn't even Care the sangria was there siting down, I went to the bartender to get it. I should of made him make me a new one but I didn't, and the wings I had to go to the bartender to get it as well, I didn't even want the wings anymore the bartender was nice and took them off and manager didn't even care at all!!!! The only person that actually seemed to care was the bartender. I'm never coming here again"
Mike D.,"Vienna, VA",28,15,,4.0,8/11/2012,"When you have kids, especially two small ones, it seems that this restaurant does a pretty good job of taking care of their Customers. We were seated quickly, even though there were 5 others ahead of us, and were promptly met by our Server within just a few minutes. Service was really above average, and the food came fast hot and delicious. The kids were having a ball, and Mom and Dad got to eat a meal that wasn't Hamburger Helper or grilled cheese sandwiches. I have to say that I'm a big fan of the regular and boneless hot wings with the spicey sauce. But I have to admit that they also do a pretty good job with the Buffalo Wing sauce as well.  All-in-all, if you have a family with kids, this Applebee's in Alexandria is a pretty safe bet."
Hany R.,"Lorton, VA",9,61,10,2.0,5/23/2013,"I like the combinations and the sauces, but I'm sorry you can't keep me as a fan with processed rubbery steak =/"
Brandon R.,"Washington, DC",71,82,200,1.0,1/21/2012,"We walked in and found a 70-year-old man wiping off menus inside the front door. I was certain he wasn't the host because he didn't acknowledge our presence.  I waited about ten seconds before clearing my throat. ""Ahem."" He looked up, annoyed. ""Two,"" I said. ""Table for two."" ""Well, let me go see if I can find a table."" I laughed out loud. I seriously thought he was joking. WE WERE THE ONLY CUSTOMERS IN THE RESTAURANT. EVERY TABLE WAS EMPTY. ""NO,"" he snapped. ""See all these tables? We don't have a waitress for every table! Stay here."" He slowly--very slowly--shuffled to the very back corner of the restaurant, and stared at a booth for a few seconds. Then he slowly--very slowly--shuffled back. Without saying a word, he grabbed two menus and walked again (slowly) to the table. We followed him and sat down. As it turns out, I was right. He wasn't the host. He was the manager. Wow. That encounter pretty much sums up our experience here. Though we were the only ones here (at 8:00 on a Monday night) it took 40 minutes to get our food.  As we were leaving, I passed the manager, still wiping off menus."
Phillip R.,"Houston, TX",3,16,,1.0,9/2/2013,Worst meal ever I ordered the steak topped with shrimp mixed vegetable and mashed potatoes. The steak was extremely tough and vegetables very salty. I was actually going to do a happy hour with several co-workers on TDY with me but after the bad food not to mention slow service I shall pass your lost Applebee's there would have been 20 in my party!!
Renee H.,"Fort Washington, MD",0,4,,4.0,10/13/2014,I never really cared for Applebees I was a Fridays customer. When our regular Friday's got a little rowdy we stopped by Applebees. The first visit we pointed out to the manager we travelled from Maryland and were loyal patrons to the right business.  We get nothing but excellent service the Manager Broderick Brady is the best manager I have witnessed. I have visited many restaurants and am very impressed with management of the floor. Although I wish they would add more selections but it's inexpensive with a tasty menu and great bartenders.
Rachel H.,"Kansas City, MO",9,16,1,2.0,12/20/2012,"This Applebee's is the worst! We went on a Saturday evening and it was pretty dead.  We got a 2/$20 and each ordered a cup of soup.  When we got our entrees, the food was totally cold and basically tasteless.  It is an older Applebee's and pretty cramped.  I wouldn't recommend this place to others."
Emily H.,"Honolulu, HI",49,41,,1.0,9/20/2012,"Don't do it! We should have known by the lack of cars in the parking lot. Worst Applebees I've been too. I'm surprised my husband and I did not get sick from this place. Dirty, smelly, dark and dead. We got stuff on our hands and clothes from something sticky underneath the table. Took forever for our food. I wasn't sure about getting my toddler a meal and by the time I thought to get her a corn dog I figured we'd never get it in time to leave. The waitress was not knowledgeable about the food. The host was not very friendly. Seemed bothered actually. Staff was on the phone with personal calls. Never got extra silverware I asked for so I got some myself. ICK!! This place is awful."
Trish C.,"Alexandria, VA",72,20,1,4.0,1/29/2013,"My boyfriend and I went here for late lunch this afternoon because we wanted to try something different. This place is pretty decent, despite the reviews I read. Our appetizers, food, and dessert came out piping hot, though my entree (Bourbon Shrimp & Chicken) did not taste like bourbon, was a bit too salty, and the chicken somewhat overcooked. The wait staff was very nice to us, however. The Triple Chocolate Meltdown was fantastic! I'd have given 5 stars, but we had to wait about 20 minutes before we were sat down, despite a number of empty tables and booths aside from the bar seating AND the hostess just standing around and not getting the names of patrons who were waiting for a table (until a gentleman behind us asked if they were taking names)."
Jess M.,"Alexandria, VA",2,24,,4.0,2/15/2014,"Some friends and I went here for a fun, casual valentine's evening. Our server was friendly and incredibly attentive. As soon as someone's drink was empty he was there asking if we'd like another round. ($3 long island teas??? Keep 'em comin'!) Was the food exceptional? No; It's Applebees, for goodness sake. But the food was fine for what it is. We'll definitely be back for happy hour again."
Ashley V.,"Alexandria, VA",22,101,5,2.0,6/13/2011,"I enjoy Applebee's and their menu, and upon stopping here, I figured it would be on par with the other Applebee's I have visited. Not the case. It was dirty, dark and dusty - three things a restaurant shouldn't be and making the restaurant feel seedy."
Ladan S.,"Fairfax, VA",2,47,,2.0,3/29/2015,"I'm giving them 2 stars because the food was great..however the service not so much. We were seated right away which is usually rare on a Saturday night at any chain restaurant. From the time we were seated however, it took about 10 minutes for our waitress to come introduce herself and take our orders for drinks, we even ordered our entrees right away because we obviously had enough time to decide. Our food came out in a timely fashion. She came to check on us when it looked like we were done and we asked for the check. It then took her 10 minutes to bring the check, then we had to wait about 10 minutes for her to come get our debit card, then about another 10 minutes again for her to come back with it. The table next to us that she was serving seemed unhappy with her service as well. It was not very busy for a Saturday night either.  Food was great and that came out in a timely fashion, but having to spend about 40 minutes of just waiting time for everything else was unacceptable."
J B.,"Alexandria, VA",1,21,,4.0,8/16/2012,"The family and I in around 6:15pm. We were greeted at the and promptly seated. The service was quite good and accommodated  to changes on my order.  My only complaint was that we sat between two families with small babies. This soiled my dining experience, no fault to Applebee. But overall, it was a good experience."
Jim D.,"Memphis, TN",71,24,6,1.0,10/5/2011,"Stopped in for lunch with the soup, salad bread special. The service is not too quick on refills, as soon as you get 1st order you need to order your refill. The soups are canned not fresh. Typical Applebee's service and food."
T. W.,"Washington, DC",0,12,,1.0,7/17/2013,"The waitress was nice, but the food was awful.  I had went into this Applebee's during a week day around 2pm.  I had ordered the orange chicken meal and it was rice, onions, veggies and a lot of juice in the meal.  It felt like a soup.  I will not return to this Applebee's again."
Cole D.,"Washington, DC",0,214,31,2.0,10/10/2011,"Service was mediocre, at best.  I don't think I ever saw any staff member smile.  The lack of enthusiasm was contagious."
Freddy P.,"Annandale, VA",32,49,4,1.0,5/29/2011,"Keep driving on this one. Ordered one beer, the waitress finally realized she didnt bring it our after I was starting to eat. Is there a manager in this place? He should have his hands cut off for opening the doors every day. Harsh? Not really"
Amy G.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,38,4,2.0,6/28/2011,"I must concur with the other reviewers who said this is the worst Applebees they've been to. Unfortunately for me, it was on my birthday. Went with hubby, kids & in-laws for my b-day celebration. Usually go in Woodbridge & have outstanding service. Went to this one as it was closer to in-laws house. The food was pretty good but the service was horrible. The waitress (Sharday, I think) was rude & argued with me. I ALWAYS order the buffalo tenders for appetizer. I have never had a problem. I said boneless buffalo tenders, my kids both got tenders & fries. She asked what flavor sauce for the kids & then listed a bunch of flavors. We chose barbeque & honey mustard. We got BBQ tenders instead of buffalo ones. I went to find her & told her I said buffalo. She said ""no you didn't. I asked you what sauce & you said BBQ."" I explained to her that I thought she was asking what dipping sauce for the tenders & she said ""Well, I asked you that then I asked you about the boness tenders & you said BBQ."" I was real annoyed at this point & said ""it's my bday & that is the one thing I really wanted. I always get the buffalo tenders & I said buffalo tenders."" She continued to argue with me. I walked off & she followed me to the table where she argued with me & my husband for a few more min. then finally said ""what did you want, I can get you what you want."" Uh duh!!! Why she couldn't have just got me what I wanted to begin with is beyond me. I have been a waitress. FIRST RULE ""Don't argue with your customer!! Even if they're wrong."" So, of course we got our main course before the app. I told her to just to box it. I actually was pretty polite as I didn't want to get all stressed on my bday. I normally would have pushed it & spoken to a mngr. as she was very rude. She was ok after that but did not ask if we wanted more drinks. (We all would have ordered more bahama mamas & long island Ice teas) My in-laws paid sep. & were done about 15 min. before us. Paid cash.  She had them sing the bday song & brought me cake/ice cream. Very nice. Ok, maybe she's redeemed herself. I'll cut her some slack & still leave a decent tip. Then we wait like 20 min. after that for her to take the check up. Finally had to go find another server to go get her so we could pay. She brings back CC & we are charged for BOTH checks.  After hunting her down again & waiting for her to figure out her ""mistake"", she says ""Oh, my mngr said I had to combine the checks in order to comp the dessert. I forgot & hadn't cashed out the other check yet."" WTF?! So she's telling us she forgot she already was paid for the other check & accidentally added it to ours? Makes sense. She said ""the extra charge will come off your card tomorrow."" Today is Tues. 3 days later & it's not off yet. It's pending, so we'll see. Needless to say we did not leave a tip & will NEVER go back. I'll stay in Woodbridge, thank you. I have never had a bad experience at an Applebees before this. Stay away from this one!! Should have heeded the warnings of others. I can't help but wonder if she was trying to pocket the cash. Strange explanation. BTW, in the 12 yrs. my husband & I have been together this is the 1st time we have not left a tip. I felt a little bad about it after leaving until my hubby mentioned we have to worry & wonder if that charge is going to come off our card, on top of her rudeness. Good point!!"
