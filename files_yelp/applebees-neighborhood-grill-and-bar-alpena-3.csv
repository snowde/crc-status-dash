Mahinalani A.,"Southgate, MI",21,21,31,4.0,6/29/2017,Not sure why so many bad reviews. Came in during prime time dinner hours. Seated immediately although place was filled with diners.  Food came out quickly and server was attentive.  The Manager also stopped by the table to check on us.  This is the only franchise sit down restaurant in Alpena.
Jim W.,"Traverse City, MI",0,1,,1.0,5/22/2017,"ordered a chicken fajita wrap that had maybe 2 little dark chicken cubes like in a Campbell soup can with a lot of chopped lettuce and Colby Jack cheese, It had no onion no peppers!"
Michael S.,"Midland, MI",12,67,4,4.0,5/16/2015,"While I hadn't been to an Applebee's in years, my visit at this particular one was surprisingly good. The food was significantly better than I remember dishes being at Applebee's, especially the Cowboy Burger. The fries were a bit on the salty side with the seasoning, but not a dealbreaker. The other highlight for me was the superb service. Our waitress was excellent and attentive, bringing refills before the glasses were empty, and the rest of the staff seemed friendly and on-point. Would definitely visit again."
Lulu R.,"Atlanta, MI",0,6,,2.0,1/15/2017,"Awful.  Felt like we were an imposition to the staff and bartender.  We ordered a beer and daiquiri.  It took 15 min to get that, had to go to bar to get and the bartender got mad.  Then the waitress came back 5 min later and took our order.  It was 3 on, not busy and all we ordered was the appetizer platter.   Will not return."

Mimi J.,"Anaheim, CA",5,10,,5.0,8/19/2013,"The food was good, servers were friendly but what really impressed me was the helpfulness of the server Blair and her shift leader J. Roberts. We went to this branch because of the old local photos they used to have on the wall, including one of a high school track team from the 40s which had my stepdad's father and uncle in it. Upon arriving, we found out that they had remodeled and gotten rid of the pictures. Blair and J. Roberts helped us find out what happened to them and went back and forth to answer our questions. Those two really exemplified great service. Small town friendliness at its best."
Winston S.,"Livonia, MI",0,22,1,3.0,12/5/2011,"I have been to lots of Applebees over the years. I like Applebees.   It just seemed like during my visit here that the excessive corporateness seemed to overshadow the good points.   It was like our servers all were reading the corporate scripts trying to upsell at every contact.   You could hear them repeating the same lines over and over at nearby tables.   The funny thing is that I don't remember feeling this way during my past visits at other locations, so I am not sure if the employees at this location are different in some way, or if the corporation has adopted a new improved system of brainwashing.    The food was good as usual.   I thought that the current menu special features were not that interesting (to me anyway) and seemed to be a lot alike, so if one of them did not appeal to you, neither would the others.  I suggest a little more variety on the special features, but  the menu still offered plenty of good choices."
