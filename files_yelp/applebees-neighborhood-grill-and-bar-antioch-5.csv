Gabby S.,"Concord, CA",63,5,2,2.0,12/27/2017,"You know the service is bad when the bartender working the bar has to serve your table!! Thank god for Lacey, she's an absolute delight. I made sure to tell her the money left on the table is for her only. It amazed me that we sat for 15 minutes and no drink order was taken at all until we flagged Lacey down. The guest greeter Gabby could have very well took our drink order. She was very sweet as well but she could be cross trained to be a helping hand to the waitresses when it's backed up like this night was, maybe a training issue? The booth behind us also complained of the slow service. Do not blame them it was bad.  Anyway, Lacey your awesome at helping us out when you didn't need to. You could have stayed at your station behind the bar. Please Applebee's management speed up your servicing crew. Food is awesome, not so much the speed of service."
Jared S.,"Antioch, CA",57,22,57,2.0,12/2/2017,"Came in with some of my family for a late dinner on Saturday evening. We received all around poor quality service throughout the night. Environment: Typical sports bar type interior. Casual setting with a full bar and a multitude of different seating options. Nothing remarkable, nothing bad. Service: Awful. Just awful. We ordered appetizers and waters to begin. The waters were dirty, so we asked for replacements. The waters came a full 40 minutes later after asking 3 times. The Appetizer was a sampler with a dip that should have come with chips. The chips did not come until we asked for them twice. Two managers had to come around and take care of our needs. We finally ordered our food a full 50 minutes after taking our seats. The food finally arrived 1 hour and 30 minutes after sitting. I was honestly so tired of dealing with the employees I just gave up, ate some, paid, and left. There was a game charge added to our bill that we didn't request or add, this had to be removed by a manager, extending our stay to a total of 2 hours and 30 minutes.  Food: The appetizers were decent but certainly not spectacular. My sisters steak was cold. My steak was ordered medium rare and came out medium well. If you have a lot of time to burn and don't care too much about quality or service, you might find yourself here. Otherwise avoid it. Bonus: May come back for the Dollar Long Island Ice Teas, they were pretty good Edit: They comped us for the appetizers for the service issues so I'll change from 1 star to 2 stars."
Alejandra C.,"Pittsburg, CA",39,13,2,1.0,10/19/2017,"WORST FOOD EVER!!  My husband, daughter and I had dinner there, first of all, the menus were completely full of sticky stuff.   We order our food (2 for $20).  We asked for a steak, mine medium well, my husband's well-done, when the food arrived my steak was so raw (blood coming out) and my husband's steak was really pink in the middle.   Service was so bad.   As I mentioned, We order the 2 for $20 and my Daughter had a kids meal! When we got the check, to our surprise, we were charged $87.  They offered you things but they don't mention that all those things are extra charge!   To make matters worse my husband and I have tummy problems now!!   I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO APPLEBEES!! Ugh"
Erica N.,"Concord, CA",190,277,234,5.0,12/29/2017,We always enjoy coming here and we always request to sit in Ang's section. She is super friendly and always takes great care of us when we go in. Love the drinks too!!! Delicious!!! Oh and happy hour is awesome!
Elva J.,"Antioch, CA",1,8,40,1.0,12/8/2017,Chips were hard with spinach dip!  Burger overdone and dry. Potatoes were rotten on the bourbon chicken n shrimp...yuck!   Waitress never checked up on and never refilled our drinks until it was time for us to leave!   That's the reason we haven't been back here for 8 years now and won't be back!!
Kelly J.,"Antioch, CA",76,2,,1.0,12/22/2017,"I don't even want to go in to no type of story, honestly but what i will say is just keep driving. This place is truly trash with a capital ass. And that's all."
Von Christopher L.,"Hayward, CA",60,3,,2.0,9/18/2017,"BEWARE OF THE LATE NIGHT BAD SERVICE! This is probably my last time ever eating or ordering here.  22:30  Service - 0/5 - Waitress checked on my table twice the whole time and that's counting the time she came with drinks and to take my order. Passed my table over 10 times as I sat there waiting for her. It wasn't as if there were more people or anything. She only had two tables to wait.  Food - 2/5- I order the same thing every time. The four cheese mac with chicken. It's gotten worse every time. This particular time, it was cold flavorless noodles, with mildly warm  burnt crispy chicken on top. Management - 3/5- -at least the manager did all in his power to replace the food and make it a bit better, I guess. But still it's his team that fail so most fault is to him."
Reg T.,"Antioch, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/3/2017,"I'm not going to waste my time writing an extensive review. Just about every negative thing that has happened to other reviewers was experienced by  my wife and I. Do not waste your time and money there. My only regret is not reading previous reviews.  You'll receive better service and a higher quality of food by going to the Shell service station next door. I'm giving it one star, only because there's nothing lower."
Debbie M.,"Puyallup, WA",0,3,,1.0,12/26/2017,By far the worst service i have ever had at your Applebee's. We eat there at least twice a month. We got our appetizers with out silverware. Had to get the bus boy and he didn't bring it out then our server finally brought it over. My salad came out without any dressing. Had to wave down our sever and she never came back with it and went on her break. The girl that took over was very sweet but still took time to come out with my dressing. It was over 15 mins before my dressing came after my salad had been sitting there.
Zoey B.,"Antioch, CA",24,90,17,1.0,8/9/2017,So I came here again KENDRA sat us Kendra was very kind and hospitality was great surprised she's not a server she's great! & and we got sat in ARACELIS SECTION didn't recognize her and again she disappointed she's terrible customer service personality I I was a server before and I don't see how she is employed here  ... long story short we ordered our food and she sucked per the usual .. we went to the rest room and came back our food was in a box WE ASKED FOR we were gone for no more then a few minutes just washed our hands and she throws everything away! .. when we ask her what happened she said ITS IN THE TRASH wtf no I'm sorry I trashed it? Just ITS IN THE TRASH and walked away you B**^# tf you mean it's in the TRASH You  IDIOT! the manger was very nice and kind and replaced it please get rid of her bad attitude having self PLZ!!!!!!  ARACELI; I'm generally a amazing tipper but I wouldn't ever give you a penny! Your attitude sucks! Your customer service is terrible get a new job this isn't a job for you. Sorry not sorry!
Kat D.,"Pittsburg, CA",53,270,62,2.0,8/16/2016,Double date night wasn't super successful. As we were waiting for menus (took 5 minutes just to get them) I knew we should have went to Chili's. But we were already here so we figured we might as well stay. Service was incredibly slow. It took 10 minutes just to get the beers we ordered. They weren't even draft. 10 minutes for 2 bottles of beer. Looking over at the bar and the waiters and one bar tender are in a full blown conversation.  The food was bla... My side salad looked sad. Wilted lettuce and too much dressing. Hubby had mac and 4 cheese. He said he got the mac but no cheeses. The steaks were tough and flavorless. I wouldn't return here.
Laura D.,"Antioch, CA",1,3,,1.0,10/8/2017,I will never again waste my time and money at Applebee's. Me and 20 of my guest received the worst service from Hillcrest Applebee's in Antioch. And the store manager Louis has me at a loss for words. His etiquette is a complete disgrace to restaurant management. We wasted 4 hours there because there is no communication between staff and poor customer service. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY THERE! We will never be back and I will continue to tell everyone I know. Until corporate decides to do something to rectify our night of horror.
Kathleen L.,"Antioch, CA",43,10,1,1.0,10/8/2017,We have always loved going to Applebee's. They have delicious food and a great selection. But the last couple times we have been to Applebee's in Antioch have been a nightmare. Tonight we went six of us. They told us 35 minutes. We waited 45 and were told we probably wouldn't be seated for another half an hour. It is clear that this restaurant does not want our business. It's clear that there are not enough servers to handle the few people that are going to dinner there. We offered to sit at two different tables just so we could be seated. The hostess went asked the server if she could accommodate us and the server said no. We walked out and we will not ever go there again too bad
Mike C.,"Oakland, CA",587,18,134,5.0,7/31/2017,Friendly service is a plus for me. That's what we got when we went to eat here. Today(Mondays)the burgers were only $6.99 w/fries.
Adan O.,"Antioch, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/8/2017,the drinks here are actually free if you walk out because the bartenders never pay any attention to you. The bonus is that they open the door for you when you walk out
Gene L.,"Antioch, CA",13,7,2,1.0,8/18/2017,"WORST SERVICE, CRAPPY FOOD! Ordered and paid for carside pickup, was told 15-18 minutes. Got there, waited half an hour, called and after being confused with several other people, was told they couldn't find my order, but would get right on it. BS! Waited longer.  Kept watching orders coming out and asking each server where my order was. Each saying, ""they'd look into it"". AN HOUR WENT BY, STILL NO ORDER. Called again,  talked to what I was told was a manager, after being confused with someone else again, was told he'd,  ""get on it"". More time.  FINALLY a server showed up with my food. So I asked her if it was fresh, considering odd now waited well over an hour.  She said,  ""of course""! Food felt warm enough,  so I drove home.  FOOD NOT FRESH,  BUT ACTUALLY SOGGY,  RUBBERY AND TOTALLY GROSS!  TOOK IT BACK FOR A REFUND!  STAY AWAY!"
Derek M.,"Oakland, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/17/2017,Bad management I ordered online for carside pickup it said ready at 1:07 pm I waited until 1:30 no one came out so I called and was told they are short staffed so just left me sitting out here looking at the sign that says available 11am to 9 pm it's now 1:45 and they came out with that order that sat for 30 minutes I asked for a fresh order it's now 1:57 still no food this is the worst ever.
Jessica A.,"Antioch, CA",258,12,,1.0,10/16/2017,"Food sucks! My bf and I sat at the bar and he ordered the Bourbon chicken and shrimp, NO flavor.  I ordered the Bourbon steak Medium and it was well done and superrrr dry.  We ate cause we were hungry and waited so long for our food.  The bartender Johanna was new but nice and fast. She asked me if I wanted to return my steak but I was too hungry at the moment.  I added lotssss of A1 sauce to give it flavor. She recommended the brownie bites and they were delicious but how can you go wrong with brownies and a scoop of ice cream?  Won't be eating here everrrrr again.  Strictly drink and that's if Johanna is working."
Greg B.,"Antioch, CA",3,6,1,1.0,10/14/2017,"Read the reviews for this place.  Over 200 reviews and 1.5 stars?  Be very leery of this joint.  Phones disappear off your table right in front of you, when only employees had access and availability.  After using Find My iPhone while walking around the restaurant, knowing the phone had never left the premises but not hearing the alert going off, the Manager walks to our table - with my phone in hand - he says ""how's everybody doing?"".  Not ""did you lose your phone?"".  When confronted, he says ""somebody turned it in but I don't know who"".  Right, and pigs fly.  Very slick.  Last time we'll be visiting this establishment."
RekaYuki J.,"Pittsburg, CA",27,35,63,5.0,6/29/2017,Just an update review. I still love the food and alcohol when I come to Applebee's along with my friends occasionally. But what I am writing about is how welcoming they are to me and my Service Dog. A lot of places gives SD handlers a hard time and since I've started taking my Service Dog places with me it's always good in my book when no one's giving me a hard time or distracting my dog from his work. So just wanted to say the staff is awesome for respecting him and not making my anxiety spike!
Norma M.,"Oakley, CA",0,6,1,1.0,7/4/2017,"I have not been in this place for many years, and I forgot why, food lazy made, disgusting, service the worse!!  Thanks for reminding me... never coming back again!"
Andrew D.,"Pittsburg, CA",99,55,16,1.0,8/15/2017,Horrible service had online order for blondie came to bar for the order 2 people working they see me say nothing look pass me bad service already then still nothing been here for about 10min now nothing see why they have such bad reviews don't be waiter bartender if you came perform good customer service you have to speak acknowledge people already bad people don't come here
Frankie V.,"Ontario, CA",1,1,4,1.0,5/7/2017,This place is a bad place to eat the food is cold and have no flavor at all and I asked for lemonade but they gave me Sprite
Joseph N.,"Carriage Hills North, Richmond, CA",0,37,19,1.0,11/21/2016,"Certainly one of the worst Applebee's anywhere in the world. It has to be. I've came here a few times in the past 10 years or so. Every single time, including the last time, has been a  notably terrible experience.  Terrible service, terrible food, and one bout of food poisoning.  There are tons of other food options directly in the same shopping center as this Applebee's. High quality Japanese food/Sushi and American/Diner literally in walking distance from this place. If the owners don't care to improve the business, they don't deserve your business."
Gaby C.,"Concord, CA",0,4,5,1.0,1/7/2017,This restaurant isn't that good the food isn't good. The drinks are always water down . the staff is alright not tip worthy tho. . this Applebee's has to be the worst in the bay area .  I will not be coming here no more!!!!
Caitlin C.,"Phoenix, AZ",4,15,5,1.0,6/8/2017,They say they close at midnight but they locked there doors over an hour before midnight. Then the manager shook his head at us while laughing when we tried to walk in.
Echelon B.,"Antioch, CA",93,5,,2.0,8/14/2017,I really wanted to give this place 4 stars but due to management this place is slowly going down like the Titanic!! For one the old managers left and it seems like after they left there was a chain reaction of some good quality co-workers that quit as well. The food service got a lot slower and it seems like the host does more then some servers.
Bobby L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,2,,2.0,10/31/2017,"We were looking for sizzler resturantBut I guess it had closed up so we seen an applebee's Good home town cooking And yes the food was great as usual ,but .....The service was absolutely horrible ! Granted everyone and every place has a bad day so please keep this in mind as I write this review So I walked in the door It was greeted about 2 minutes later from a nice Young man who escorted us to a booth at the far end he said that was the only booth available we said we would wait for another one but he basically insisted that we set there , So we did .Shortly after that we realized why no one was sitting at that booth the phone was directly behind us within the 1st 5 minutes it rang over and over and over probably 10 times When the young man came by again we asked him if we could move to a different spot he replied that he was very busy and short handed that he didn't have time to do that for us but that our server would be able to help us when she got there .10 minutes later and I mean 10 minutes our server came to us asked us what we would want to drink My wife's reply to him was could we please move into another booth he replied I'll see what I can do and never returned At this time it had been over 20 minutes that we were inside of applebee's and didn't even get a drink .We just got up and moved to the bar .We should have stayed at the booth and put up with the service there and the phone ringing ,Because literally even sitting at the bar we waited another 10 minutes for our 1st 2 drinks which by the way were excellent I had a margherita silver patronne on the rocks with no salt I believe my wife had some sort of lemonade Non alcohol .Now get this part 10 minutes later we asked if we could order some appetizers as she never came to us after she brought the 1st drinks which by the way were empty at that point .We ordered our appetizers the sampler plate which really looked great that's all it did as we got that 7 or 8 minutes after our food arrived ,Once again not to be repetitive all of the food was great we took the appetizers home for our dog . Maybe we'll go back and try again another day like I said sometimes people or places have a bad day this was just our experience there. Stop and pick up a snack on your way there if you are in a hurry to eat ....lol. Bone appetit"
Susan P.,"Gardnerville, NV",0,4,,5.0,6/21/2017,Great service from the moment we entered the door!  I had the dry rub baby back ribs and my hubby had steak. The dry rub was the best I've ever had!  Nice and cool inside on a hot summer day.  The watermelon sangrias were delicious too.
Ernest B.,"Brentwood, CA",0,15,,2.0,7/13/2017,"AppleBees has been around a long time food always good , but I must warn if you do a pick up be careful they have a habit of screwing your order up this is my second time forget to check order missing items/food once I got home."
Vickie R.,"Antioch, CA",2,106,,1.0,8/24/2016,"This must be the WORSE Applebees in their whole chain of restaurants. I can't understand it. The service here is so bad. We stopped going years ago because we got sick and tired of walking into this place and basically being ignored.  Typical Antioch Applebee's Experience: You walk into the restaurant and can literally stand there for 15 min or more without one person acknowledging you. They SEE you but for some reason appear to feel that if no one talks to you, you just might go away, making their lives much easier. Once you do get seated, it takes another good 15 min OR MORE to get a server to approach your table.  Then once you do order, it takes forever to get the food and it's SO inconsistent, sometimes good sometimes bad, you're  left wondering why you bothered. This scenario happened many times to us until we just decided to give up. So we stopped going.   It was so bad that it scared us off of going to any Applebees anywhere until not long ago, while visiting some friends in Lodi,  we wound up at their local Applebees for lunch and couldn't believe the difference. Fantastic service and food. We were amazed!  We thought maybe things have changed for the better so we decided to give  Antioch Applebee's another try. WRONG!  Same old story but this time we didn't bother to wait around for the food. We just left. NEVER again."
Candice S.,"Antioch, CA",9,292,,4.0,4/24/2016,"I can't believe I'm actually giving an Applebee's a 4-star review. This must be a fluke. It has to be right? Upon entrance we were warmly greeted and seated right away. Our server was courteous and accommodating of my father and I's apparent physical disabilities. The interior of this location underwent a huge update as did management and menu design. It felt a bit more hip and keeping up with the trends. I enjoyed seeing the pride they have for their local high schools by displaying pictures of the high school athletes everywhere. My dad and I opted for the 2 for $20 meal. 1 appetizer + 2 entrees. Pretty sweet deal. We got the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer. It was very filling, but lacked a fresh artichoke flavor. Regardless, we damn near cleared our the ramekin. He ordered the chicken bourbon with shrimp and I ordered the lemon glazed grilled chicken. His order came with fried russet potatoes on the side. His only comment was that the chicken was way overcooked, but that it had a great flavor. I enjoyed the lemon glaze on mine and found the grilled chicken to be perfectly cooked and moist. My dish also came with a side of rice pilaf/quinoa and small (very small) chunks of apple, cranberries and celery for texture. It only needed a teensy bit more apple to balance out the bitter-sweetness of the cranberries. Overall, our experience was very satisfactory and I may actually consider coming back. Which says something because I've never been a fan of this location or Applebee's at all. New management I hope!"
Jinthana S.,"Brentwood, CA",171,41,100,1.0,4/8/2017,"Listen to the reviews. Went in here on a Friday night around 9, didn't leave the restaurant till almost 11. What I don't understand is that...it wasn't even that busy and they managed to screw up my entire order and visit. I ordered a strawberry LIMEADE. Got a strawberry LEMONADE.  Ordered a 2 for $25 meal... asked for the ribs and it usually comes with coleslaw and fries, ended up getting broccoli and mashed potatoes. I'm not complaining but it's just funny how my order was messed up.  The third strike, I asked the server to put everything on a gift card and then the rest on cash, she does the complete opposite and so we had to wait for her to fix it. She ended up fixing it but shorted us some change, so we had to wait AGAIN. We asked to talk to the manager and he ended up fixing it for us but had an excuse that they were really busy. They weren't even that busy to be honest... but like the others, trust these reviews.  Won't be coming back."
Vinny M.,"Antioch, CA",17,2,3,1.0,1/20/2017,"Racial profiling and employees steeling money off gift cards.    First of all, I never care to leave reviews. I feel it's a waist of time as I run my own business and would rather spend free time with my family.  First bad experience happened a few days before Christmas. I sat at the bar to watch the warriors play. I found out they had a deal,  buy a $50 gift card, you get an extra $10 gift card that had to be used in the month of Jan.  I told the bartender, I wanted two $50 gift cards and gave her my credit card. She left, came back, handed me the phone and said we just have to verify this is your card. Now, I'm on the phone with someone, asking for my name, my mothers maiden name and the last 4 of my social security number. After I answered those questions the guy on the phone, says ok let me see if those are correct.  A red flag went off, usually they know right away if you answered correct or not. I asked the bartender who she called, she said the number on the back of my card, then she told me just to hang up. I asked if she can show proof of who she called. She said she couldn't because she dialed the number in the back in the kitchen. As far as I know I just gave out personal information to some random person over the phone. They said they had to call to make sure the amount was going to go through, I said it's a credit card, you'd know right away if it was going to go through.. I called my cc company to see if they received a call about verification. I was relived that they did, but still irritated about the entire situation. I asked the manager Luis, why couldn't they just ask to see my ID like the standard thing to do. His reply was that people have fake ID's. I ended up just getting the gift cards and leaving right after. I never in my life had a situation like this happen.  I ended up going back Jan 15th. After my meal, I gave the waitress, Megan  a $50 gift card and the two $10 gift cards. She gave me back one of the $10 gift cards and said I can only use one per visit. No problem, sign the receipt and tipped her and left.  Now today, Jan 20th after my meal, I gave the waiter the $50 gift card and the other $10 bonus card. He came back and said the balance was 0 on the $10 gift card and only $12 on my $50 gift card. I asked to talked to the manager and Luis came over.  I told him the situation last time I came in, the waiter taking both $10 cards and giving me back this one, that should of had $10 still on it and mentioned that I should have $25 out of the $50 gift card. I showed him proof of my receipt from last time and he said there nothing he can do about it. I asked him if he could just talk to the waiter since it was just a few days ago, but nothing.  Its not even all about the money it's about the principle, I'm showing proof and for a manager to basically shrug his shoulder and say he can't help, made me write this review. I told him it's fine, everything happens for a reason, paid for my meal and left.  I like apple bee's but I'll never go back to this one, I'd rate them 0 stars if I could. This place needs to work on their customer service, stealing money off gift cards and the entire experience with having to talk to someone from my credit card company just to use it, is ridiculous."
Tanner J.,"Byron, CA",1,16,5,5.0,5/27/2017,"I have little to say. I can't say much about the other servers, but I know Max was a really nice guy and he listened to me. Bummer  this place has such a low rating. Max was cool."
S G.,"Antioch, CA",0,9,5,1.0,5/27/2017,"WORST PLACE! TERRIBLE SERVICE I stopped going here a couple years ago because the service was bad and food was just ok. I went back against my better judgment and service was bad. It was only about 30 ppl in the restaurant with most of them being in the bar area and me at the booth with my kids and food took 1 hr and a half. Cook keep messing up on our food so the manager came out to apologize and again they messed up. My meal was missing it's sides and the waiter said sorry and still never brought it out. Place is a mess, they seriously need to be shut down. First place I DID NOT TIP ."
Camilo B.,"Pittsburg, CA",1,6,,1.0,4/3/2017,"Regardless of the time or day my wife and I visit, the service is always very slow and sometimes rude. While the food is fine, common Applebee's fare, the service has really turned us off this restaurant. About a year ago, we were eating when a fight broke out between two different tables and the people started throwing steak knives at each other. The manager handled the crazy situation as best she could, and stayed professional in the middle of chaos. But, the overall feel of the restaurant is low quality, and this just reinforced that! We have only been back once since that time, and nothing had changed. I don't think we will be back again."
Joselyn G.,"Antioch, CA",23,3,1,1.0,3/5/2017,"I bit into the chicken we got for take out and i thought I was biting into a burnt cucumber. No flavor , frozen and disgusting. This place has gone extremely downhill it's a miracle it isn't closed yet."
Terry H.,"Richmond, CA",16,1,,2.0,9/24/2017,Got seated right away but sat  for 15 minutes before I asked someone to at least take our drink order. Turns out our server was sitting chatting with friends.
Eric T.,"Antioch, CA",88,545,6990,3.0,10/18/2014,"I was surprised that their next door neighbor (Sizzler's) was closed so I settled for Applebee's. Overall not a bad experience for a typical chain. Food prices are pretty reasonable. Their Onion Rings and Fried String Beans wasn't strained so there was small puddle of grease on the bottom the tray, else it was flavored well and the dipping sauces were excellent. Their shrimp linguine had good flavor but it had a bit too much olive oil (reminds me of Hell's Kitchen when Chef Ramsey tilts the plate and you can pour the olive oil on a napkin, but it wasn't that extreme) Their strawberry ice tea is something I will avoid; but if you like strawberry syrup added to your ice tea, then you'll like it"
