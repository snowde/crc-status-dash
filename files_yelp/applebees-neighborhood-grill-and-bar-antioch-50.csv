Susana V.,"Pittsburg, CA",151,2,,1.0,6/16/2014,"This place is horrible! Waited 10 minutes just to get something to drink. Appetizer was pretty good,other than that I don't recommend this place. Ordered a sirloin steak medium rare, got well done. Asked for another steak , took a bite and it was still raw! Had to go to the bathroom and throw up, complained to the manager she took it off the bill which was okay I guess. This place just has HORRIBLE SERVICE seriously!  I wouldn't recommend anyone to come here, unless you want to wait an hour or two for your food than go ahead!  Lol but place is horrible-,-"
bety j.,"Walnut Creek, CA",140,9,10,1.0,4/7/2012,Services sucks!!!! All the servers need to be retrained on customer service you can tell no one likes there job.
Dori Y.,"Antioch, CA",0,5,6,1.0,11/17/2013,"Server ignored us!  Arrived at 6:30, seated at 6:35, left at 6:50 because server didn't so much as acknowledge us. She walked right by us five times, managed to speak with every other table but ours.  She went out of her way to ignore us.  Went to Chili's instead.  Had our drinks within five minutes, appetizer within 15 and our dinner within 25.  NEVER going to Applebee's again!"
Moovers Inc. I.,"Pittsburg, CA",130,40,3,1.0,12/19/2013,This place is horrible! Call it a rant but definitely nor a rave! Service non existent and can't wait to taste the food.....nuff said!
K F.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",149,2,,1.0,4/1/2011,"Total disappointment! I recently went to the Concord Applebee's and was thrilled with the food and service. Then I made a huge mistake in going to the Antioch location off of Hillcrest Ave.  Walking in, there was no one even there to greet the four of us so we stood up front for a good 5 minutes before a young girl walked up to finally get us a seat. Mind you this same girl was chatting with what looked to be friends while we waited for her attention. Once she gave us a place to sit we waited another 15 minutes for a young man to walk up and say 'what do you want to drink?' Forgive me for saying but what happened to the good customer service of 'Hi, my name is ____ I'll be your server today, can I get you started with something to drink?' Due to the long wait we were ready to order the dinner and the drinks (sodas). To shorten this up a bit, it took another 15 minutes for the drinks to get to the table and after that 30 more for the meals. We arrived at 9:45pm and didn't leave until after 12:20am and got only drinks and some appetizers. Numerous employees past up our table and not one apologized for the wait or even smiled in our direction. Our server gave the guys (obvious friends of his) a free meal that were sitting at the table next to us. They tipped him some cash that he pocketed right in front of us, they shook hands and they left without any shame.  I usually would just walk out on service like that but it was too late to attempt another location and waiting that long for drinks alone made everyone just want to stick it out. We all left extremely irritated. For as many people out there that need jobs, places like this should get rid of the high school kids that have no customer service respect and employ the people who need to pay their mortgages and families.  Tip of the day: Don't waste your time on going to Antioch Applebee's."
Finesse R.,"Antioch, CA",97,12,12,2.0,1/14/2012,The food was ok but I recommend not coming here when its football season ridiculous how long we waited to get our bill this is mainly a last resort place...
H C.,"Bethel Island, CA",0,16,8,3.0,7/26/2012,We had the 2 for $20 the other day. The artichoke dip was delicious and hot. We ordered the 3 cheese pasta for entrees. The pasta arrived slightly warm and hardly any sauce. My husband returned his to be warmed up. The waiter bought it back with an extra side of sauce. It ended up being ok. we have eaten there many times before and always had a good meal. 3 Stars for the pasta. Service was quick and attentive.P.S. The older lady who greets and seats is wonderful!
Linda L.,"Antioch, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/4/2014,Awful experience. Was seated quickly but waited 15 min.  for someone to take my drink order...never happened. Noticed most of the waitresses hanging at the bar with custamers so I went there. Sat another 10 minutes never was acknowledge by waitresses or bartender so I left. Use to go there often not anymore.
Nicky F.,"Pittsburg, CA",2,17,,1.0,2/19/2013,"I'm a bit too late , but better late than never for my review! On New Year's Eve I went to this place with a friend to have dinner. It was early evening when we arrived. We were seated in an area which seemed to be in the back of the place. The server came up and handed us menus, he did not greet us nor tell us his name, We ordered our food, waited, and waited for it to arrive,  after 15 min (the restaurant was not busy)  The served seemed to throw the pates on the table, and flew off  like a bat out of hell! We did not see him for awhile to ask about our drinks.  He did not even ask if we were having any. After our meal we wanted coffee, once again no server, after awhile we finally asked another server to find him & tell him of our need for service. He apparently ignored our request because we waited another 10 min. When finally  our server showed up coming out of a back room, we asked for coffee, off he rushed, got our coffees but did not bring cream or ask,  by this time we were feeling very dis satisfied.  We had to demand the check from our server as he zoomed by our table. I wrote on the check our over all dis satisfaction . The cashier knew of the problem as other customers also complained about him. The food was fair, but because of lousy service we will not go back. No service, no tip!"
Kevin B.,"Antioch, CA",2,42,,1.0,6/8/2010,"Generally, I like Applebee's.  I have eaten here 3 times.  1st time, never saw our waitress except when we ordered and when we got the check.  2nd time, there was a hair in my friend's food, 3rd time there was a hair in my sister-in-law's food and it took 20 minutes to get a beer. Their manager has great customer service skills, but the staff is useless."
kim c.,"Antioch, CA",56,125,22,1.0,4/14/2010,HORRID........... I would not go back and eat with George Bush Mouth.......it was that bad and i am a fan of applebees But Not this one...We Get There The Girl at the Front Said there is a Wait . A Wait For what the Place was Empty....the Food was Yuck.....i am soooo Upset
Maria M.,"Oakley, CA",13,70,5,1.0,9/28/2012,"Just got back from applebees (9-28-12) 8:15pm-9:40pm, the waiter was super friendly but we waited for refills for over 20 minutes. The food quality sucked. The cook said that we should try the Chipotle Cream Steak & Shrimp that it was his favorite. My boyfriend did and the steak lacked all flavor and shrimp were overcooked and for $13.99 the amount of food you get is a joke. It had a 7 oz steak including 5 baby shrimp and about 6 small cubes of potatoes. We did not receive any napkins for dinner. It seemed a little busy but not to spend an hour and half to eat and go. I had a bacon cheeseburger nothing special, and also the queso blanco which was alright. I have to say I would have rather spent $35 at Jack In The Box! My boyfriend told me when we left he will never eat there as long as he lives and he was still hungry when we left!"
Amanda C.,"Antioch, CA",1,5,3,1.0,12/30/2012,"We arrived on a Sunday past the normal lunch rush time. The waitress informed me they had only two servers on staff for the morning. We waited awhile for our drinks, enough time to figure out our order and have our kids complain of hunger. When we received our meal we were missing one of our child's meals and we did not receive it until we had to remind another server it was missing. The food was not cooked to our order, did not appear to be anything like the menu picture depicted, and it tasted awful. I don't understand why greasy fried food is seen as good food. My burger was smothered in mounds of cheese, bacon, and grease soaked onion fries and hardly any fresh produce. If we had not been given a gift card to this restaruant we would not have gone and won't be going back. We were apalled when we received the tab and saw how much they charged for the junk they were serving."
Chelsea B.,"Antioch, CA",77,3,,1.0,1/13/2014,"The level of poor service was almost comical upon my last visit. Once we were seated, it took about 15 minutes for the waiter to take our drink order. After another 15 minutes we were finally served our drinks. The waiter wasn't very attentive and when it came time for our meals to be served my plate was completely forgotten. The waiter mumbled something like 'the rest is still coming out' and retreated to the back. Another 10 minutes passed before he returned to our table-empty handed. At that point a we had to remind him that we were still missing a plate. He scurried to the back again, and at this point everyone in my party is feeling bad for me and sharing their meals. When my friends were finishing up eating, another waiter stopped at our table to let me know they just STARTED making my meal. When I finally got my burger I immediately asked for a to go box and left. The only decent part about that evening was the fact the manager came out and comped my meal. I thought that was the end of the Applebee fiasco, but when I went to eat my burger I found that it wasn't even the item I ordered. Save yourself the hassle and treat yourself to something a bit nicer, like maybe Denny's."
Pugg Z.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",96,39,,1.0,4/13/2011,"So I've been to this location a handful of times and every time I've been here its been nothing but a disappointment. My friends and I went for happy hour here a few times. We had a bad experience with a certain bar tender, Vanita. . . . My friends and I ordered a lemon drop and her reply to us was ""There's too many steps in making a lemon drop, I can't make it right now. I'm too busy. Can you pick another drink?"" Yeah... Never going back to Applebees again !"
Alan H.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,33,,1.0,3/20/2012,Sucked big time!!!  My burger tasted good but was barely luke warm.  My french fries were dry and not even warm like they had been sitting there for quite some time.  My first time eating at a Applebee's and probably my last.  What a disappointment and not cheap either.
Marchelle D.,"Antioch, CA",1,16,1,1.0,3/19/2012,"if your waiter is greg, run the other way and fast! he is the worst we have ever had. food comes late, cold and not at all what you ordered. that being said. this place is a total hit and miss, some nights we go and get exactly what we want and in a timely matter. other nights i wonder why we even bothered. their bathrooms are always dirty, the managers are always busy and never want to hear from the customers. actually you would be better off going to chilis."
Buena D.,"San Francisco, CA",8,4,,1.0,1/6/2011,"A couple of friends and I were in Antioch 1/4/11 and decided to go to Applebee's for dinner since we never had problems eating at other Applebee's restaurants before. The restaurant was not crowded at all and we were seated right away. Our waitress came by our table within 10 minutes to take our drink orders. While we were waiting for our drinks, we reviewed their menu deciding what to eat. We decided on the chicken wing appetizer with the sauce on the side, chicken broccoli pasta Alfredo, teriyaki shrimp pasta, combo chicken and shrimp sizzling skillet fajitas, a Caesar salad with dressing on the side and tomato basil soup and garlic bread basket. Within 10 minutes of our order the chicken appetizer arrives (so far so good). 20 minutes later the waitress comes to our table to let me know that they had just run out of tomato basil soup. I then order the rib-lets with no fries since I ordered the Caesar salad. Our food finally arrives 15 minutes later and it looks real good until we taste it. The chicken broccoli pasta Alfredo was so dry that we asked for extra Alfredo sauce which took 15 minutes to heat up so by the time the sauce arrives, the chicken broccoli pasta was cold, yucky!! The only thing sizzling on the fajitas platter was the onions and bell peppers. The chicken was cold and the shrimp half cooked so my friend buried the shrimp under the veg to cook more and she just ate the chicken cold. Her flour tortillas was wrapped in foil and was brick hard and I mean it was hard!!! She couldn't eat it at all. The Teriyaki shrimp pasta was so salty because of the sauce that my friend could not eat it. Her blood pressure would have been off the Richter scale lol. My ""plain"" Caesar salad arrives with a couple of cut up romaine lettuce and 3 tiny croutons. No Parmesan cheese!!! It looked so sad and even sadder was my 2 1/2 small pieces of rib-lets. During our ""unhappy meal"" we told the waitress that we would like to speak to the manager because we were not satisfied with our food and at that the time she informed us that she did speak to the manager to let him know. By common courtesy the manager should have been to our table right away to make things right but he doesn't show up until after the bill was paid for!!! This is beyond ""shitty"" customer service. Oh, by the way the reason the tortillas was brick hard the restaurant uses a microwave to heat up the tortillas instead of heating them on the grill. The main reasons we will not be back to that restaurant is because of their lousy customer attitude, unacceptable food preparations and management lack of cooperation."
Nancy S.,"Dublin, CA",4,77,1,1.0,11/11/2008,"Worst service I have ever experienced in a restaurant - ever.  The hygiene of this place is also highly suspect. 1. The hostess station was filthy when we came in. 2. The hostess was sorting silverware at the dining  table closest to the front door. 3.  The booth seats were covered with food and I had to wipe them down myself. 4.  The waiter could not remember what we order to drink for 10 seconds. 5.  My boyfriend asked for ranch dressing to go with his onion rings and the waiter went away for about 5 minutes and then came back with BBQ sauce.  Then it took him another 5 minutes to go back and get the ranch dressing so all the food was cold by the time he finally brought it. 6.  My boyfriend's hamburger was half off the bun and the cheese was half off the burger.  The food in generatl was mediocre at best. 7.  We were charged for a side salad we did not order and I asked the waiter to take it off the bill before he charged the card, he came back - without the detailed bill and the credit slip had the same total as the original bill."
Espresso C.,"Antioch, CA",3,112,23,2.0,3/2/2011,"I probably should give it one star.  I was very disappointed.  My husband got me a gift card for xmas for 25 bucks to Applebees, kind of a joke.  I had never been and really didn't want to waste my money hence the gift card. So we decide to go on Valentines of all days.  How did I know everyone and their friggin mother was going to Applebees!  It's a nasty chain restaurant for peets sake! Anyway I order the burger my husband some chicken thing.   We got an appetizer, which I can't even remember what it was.  Our food took over an hour to come.  It gets their and my husbands is literally sizzling away, mine is cold and hard, gross.  I tell her just have them microwave it I don't want to wait for another, I want to go home.  So it comes and then when I really look at it, it's so over cooked the meat is like sawdust, disgusting.  The desert was good, it was the Maple blondie.  Would I go back, maybe for lunch with the kids, they really like garbage food."
