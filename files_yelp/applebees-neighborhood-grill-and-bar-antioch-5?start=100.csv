Ray L.,"Pittsburg, CA",4,19,,2.0,6/18/2015,This use to be a great place to eat. Over the last year or so it's  become extremely nasty inside. Cold food and subpar service. Do yourself a favor and go to Black Angus in Brentwood.
Nik A.,"Pittsburg, CA",6,42,108,1.0,2/25/2014,"Horrible. I will never step foot into this Applebee's again. Me and my girlfriend visited this location on February 13th, 2014.       We walked into this establishment and waited at the podium to be seated by a hostess; after two minutes of making eye contact with numerous servers ""vii"" finally came to greet us, she told us it would be a five minute wait to sitdown and we had no problem with that. About three minutes passed by until we were seated to look over the menu.  After we were seated we waited 10 minutes for a waiter to greet us and take our drink order. We noticed tables around us were being serviced while we were not.         We happend to notice ""vii"" walking by and asked her why haven't we been serviced yet. Her response was ""the kitchen is currently backed up, it will be 20 minutes before anything comes out, we aren't even seating anybody at this moment so they can catch up on orders"".     After she said that line to us she walked off without us having a chance to respond.    Me and my girlfriend walked out right after that. As soon as we were walking out another hostess was sitting a family down.  The kitchen being backed up has noting to do with a waiter coming to our table or serving us drinks. The table behind us, in front of us  and to the side of us was being serviced but not us.  ""Vii"" said they were not seating anybody else until the kitchen has caught up with their orders,  yet they were sitting people as we left.  I will not be going back to this place again. They ruined my Valentine's day dinner."
Diane C.,"Antioch, CA",7,17,1,1.0,9/6/2015,"We can't say we haven't tried this Applebee's over many years since it opened and EVERY time they mess something up.  Either the order is wrong, it takes forever, I can't count how many times someone in our party has left without food because of something they've done wrong or sent food back.  I guess we're gluttons for punishment, as we keep thinking maybe this time it will be better.  Tonight was the LAST STRAW.  I ordered a side salad and potsticker appetizers and my husband a chicken dish. They brought out my food first even though we wanted them to bring them out together, and promised the chicken would be ""right up""; however, after I was through with my salad (and not through the postickers because they were awful!), they told us there was a problem and the manager would be right over. We told them forget it, I had already eaten and my husband, no longer wanted to wait. We paid the bill, which was $28 for 2 appetizers and 2 beers! And low and behold, the manager just hid behind the bar. NEVER has a manager apologized to us for the many times they've messed up our orders. In a GOOD restaurant the manager would've been falling over us apologizing offering to comp the whole tab, but as I left and peered over at the manager, she just sunk below the machine at the bar.   Do not waste your time or your money!  I don't usually write reviews like this, but after 10+ years of this, I've had enough.  No more chances Applebee's, and I guaranty I'll be writing to the corporate office.  This is the worst restaurant in Antioch for sure."
Nancy F.,"Antioch, CA",0,14,,3.0,6/24/2016,My BF and I came here on Father's Day for a late lunch and was totally surprised that the food had improved. He had the ribs and actually enjoyed it. He is usually very picky about his food. I had some kind of shrimp stir fry and was also satisfied with it. The hostess that seated us was friendly and our waitress was ok. She did forget to bring us our drinks and it was only iced tea and coffee. Then we were never offered refills. But the food was good so we might be back.  I have never liked Applebee's in the past. Food was always too bland.
Dangja M.,"Martinez, CA",291,76,67,1.0,1/29/2014,Just don't come here.  Bad everything. Super slow service  Food is salty  Crap people  Bad neighborhood.
George M.,"Antioch, CA",171,52,,1.0,6/14/2015,"Dump. Save your money. You're better  off at the next door To go's or Jack in the Box. Or even snacks from the Shell gas station. Service is s-l-o-w. Your order will be wrong, and the server will look at you like it's your fault. Your companion will get her order, but it will freeze over while you wait for your correct order to arrive. Finding a manager is a process, as they attempt to wait you out so you'll just leave. Just save your money and drive away"
Grace Anne D.,"Concord, CA",265,364,623,4.0,2/21/2010,"So I read everyones review. We just stumbled upon this today since kabuki closes on Sundays. When I read te review I instantly judged this place and thought lowly of the food and service. BUT it was pretty much the opposite. The service was great. Joy, our waiter, was nice. Got our orders and refilled our drinks without even asking which was nice. Mlmy aunt and I got the 2 for $20 deal. We got onion rings as our appetizer. They were huge and filling! Loved them.  I took one star away because omfg the buffalo wings were so salty! It was ridiculous. I instantly had to gulp a lot of my shirely temple just cause of one bite of it. The place was cold and it was already cold outside and raining. :(  But overall: good food. Excellent waittress (who is Filipino and speaks Tagalog which was a plus). Business hours: Friday-Saturday 11am-12am. Sunday-Thursday 11am-11pm both for food and bar."
Alma C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",59,21,1,1.0,1/19/2015,"I wouldn't have ever came back to this place if their wings weren't good. Anyway, we went to this applebee's four times. And I must say, the first time my girlfriend took me to this place, I was a little impress on the surrounding but the food? No thank you. We came there four times, twice with both of our family's. Our food was UNCOOKED! UNDERCOOKED! The meats were still red. I'm sorry to say but they're unfriendly and they need a new cook asap. Thanks"
The Ç.,"Oakley, CA",0,14,,2.0,9/17/2014,"I really hate to say this. And if you look at my record of reviews and see the massive list of five stars I've thrown around, you know I REALLY hate to say this. But I can totally see why this place only has two stars. We went for my step sister's birthday, and I know she and her friends are rude and not very patient, but I was running out steam trying to protect the server, whom I knew personally from high school. Maybe they were just having a bad night, I want to say, ignoring the glaring two star total the business is sporting. But seriously, we were only supposed to be there for an hour and a half. Instead, we WAITED FOR FOOD for over an hour. Finally the food came out and the birthday girl's mother had her order wrong (although she didn't have him correct it, but maybe she was afraid to wait another hour). That bitch is no peach, so on a $70 bill she left our server $2. Which was so deplorable. I wish I had known before we left. Our server was a great dude and he didn't really do anything wrong. He was very present and on top of things with the drinks, and the place wasn't all that busy so he was constantly moving between the kitchen and his three tables. The lady behind us yelled at him and demanded to see the manager, and my mother and I started talking a little shit about ""people who are bad to service people"" and then that bitch apologized to him when he came back around with the manager. Seriously, I have to say again, it WAS NOT his fault. The kitchen was probably understaffed (or on strike back there, wtf) and there wasn't anything he could do about it. I could tell he was under pressure too, because he tried to save himself by making the birthday girl's dessert HIMSELF. You know there's an issue in the kitchen if the server is suddenly making your food. My mom and I tipped extra, because unlike everybody else at the table we have a shred of sympathy because we actually had to work at our service jobs and put up with bad customers. If I had known my stepmom was going to be such a shady bitch, I would have tipped him even more. I only gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 because he tried hard enough that the least he deserves is a star on damn review site. Hint to the owner; maybe you need more cooks or maybe your waitstaff needs a raise, but you better do something because I know at least nine people (myself included) who will never eat there again."
Chrissie G.,"Antioch, CA",71,127,82,1.0,9/8/2013,"Negative STARS!!!!!! WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN!  Was seated, waited at our table for about 8mins with a crap load of waiters pass us by and not one said anything to us.  Walked out and will never look back."
Brandon M.,"Berkeley, CA",30,91,38,2.0,10/26/2013,"2/5 for service everything else was trash, my burger was the size of a McDouble(look at the picture) & it costed me $10.50!  Never again, I'll learn from this... Don't get the blue cheese burger it has a good flavor but it's greasy.  Their happy hour items are slim & nothing really catches your eye."
Nancy S.,"Belen, NM",25,35,1,1.0,5/28/2015,"I am SO sorry I didn't take the other reviews seriously. My apologies to you. THIS PLACE IS AWFUL!  We were at the table for seemingly 10 minutes with no service! Finally got our order placed, asked for napkins to wipe up the table (NEVER GOT THEM). And the food sucked!  Fries so salty that's all you could taste... Salt!  DONT GO!!!"
Cecilia B.,"Manteca, CA",141,118,30,1.0,3/8/2014,Won't be coming here ever again!!!    My boyfriend and I usually like coming to Applebee's for the late night happy hour for the games and apps.. Well in the Central Valley it's poppin' here not so much We weren't greeted. We sat ourselves at the bar.  We got up to get our own menus. The server saw me and never tried to acknowledge our existence. The hostess walked by and we asked for water. I asked for help and she didn't know what was going on herself and wasn't trying to be any kind of helpful. So we got up and left.
Christopher A.,"Concord, CA",1,10,4,2.0,8/16/2015,"Only came here because I had a gift card.  Food was as expected - slow at arriving, lukewarm when served and overdone to the point that someone must have forgot to take it out of the microwave in time.  Buffalo wings were dry and lacking sauce, almost as if California was also in the throes of a wing sauce drought.  Ribs were like chewing on jerky at either end.  Old fashioned was overdosed with simple syrup.  Should have stuck with the unbastardized beer, called it a day and picked up something more palatable.  Perhaps a Lean Cuisine next time."
Annie A.,"Millbrae, CA",367,70,119,4.0,2/24/2015,Great service. Rob was a great helper.  I wasn't feeling well so he bought warm water with honey & lemon. Soup and Fiesta chicken was yummy. My mom is vegetarian so she loved  her tomato basil soup.  So thank you Applebee's.
M N.,"Antioch, CA",254,135,178,1.0,1/25/2014,Horrible place to eat food portion is not enough for one person. The only thing missing on this rib plate is a few fries the ribs were just pulled apart and barely any meat. We paid to pull apart bones.  Servers are always non existent. I have never seen such a restaurant serve such little food and careless servers.
Jessica-Joy R.,"Pittsburg, CA",106,65,24,1.0,2/10/2014,"Haven't been here for a few years, and apparently for good reason.  Not that Applebee's is any kind of top place to eat, but this place is run down and the food was crap!  I used to come to this Applebee's all the time for happy hour a few years ago.  The customer service and food quality has gone waaaaaaaaay down!  The place smelled like mildew and it felt humid and disgusting inside.  Maybe it was because it was raining, but nonetheless, felt disgusting.  There were tons of seating but had to wait to be seated.   The food was TERRIBLE!!! We started with an appetizer, the spinach & artichoke dip.  I used to swear by this appetizer.  It was gross.  It was runny, bland, and no cheese to be found.  It was like warm, and the chips were cheap & gross.  I ordered the three cheese chicken penne.  Something I've always ordered when I used to come here, and it was beyond disgusting.  There was definitely not three cheeses in the dish.  The sauce was runny, kind of a clear gross looking substance, with watery uncooked tomatoes & overcooked pasta.  I ordered my son chicken tenders which were damn near burnt with a side house salad which had wilted lettuce.  My husband ordered honey lime chicken & shrimp with mashed potatoes and green beans.  The green beans were undercooked.   However, our waitress was surprisingly pleasant.  She's the only reason we tipped the place. Why did we stay & pay you ask?!  Because I was starving & pregnant! Anyway, don't come to this sorry excuse of an eating establishment.  Save yourself some money and the trouble of having to tip and go to Jack in the Box instead.  You'll surely get more consistency!"
Kyle B.,"Modesto, CA",2,68,35,1.0,4/19/2015,"Haha what kind of swiss mushroom burger has two sliced mushrooms on it no bigger than nickels??? I also asked for the sauce on the side and add mayo, that didn't happen. Waitress seemed like she hated her  job or had somewhere else she would rather have been. Brought me my refill and it wasn't even close to what I ordered in the first place.... Glad I had a gift certificate would have been more pissed if I paid for this shit food with my own money."
John D.,"San Bruno, CA",0,6,,1.0,7/12/2015,I signed up for YELP just so that I could write this review. Went in on a Sunday at 10pm and it wasn't busy. We got seated quickly but our server was terrible and extremely slow. Our food came out cold and our order was incorrect. Manager came and took over in order to fix everything.
R L.,"Antioch, CA",1,23,3,1.0,4/30/2013,"Horrible service last night and it wasn't even busy. I went in ahead of my boyfriend to get us a table and order drinks. It was 9pm and not busy. I stood at the empty hostess stand for a few minutes and waited while no one came to greet me or even acknowledge me. One server walked past me while taking another group of guests to their table. Finally, after cleaning a table, another server came to seat me and provide with a menu but did not take a drink order. When my boyfriend joined me, I said I was unable to get a head start on a drink order because the server didn't stop by. Finally two different servers walked past our table to bring food to two different tables. We decided to move to the bar since a bartender was there. When we got up to leave, one of the servers who had set food down at a nearby table but stayed to chat with the table said: is something wrong?  What a joke. We received no acknowledgement the whole time we were seated until we get up to move. I understand chatting with patrons and being friendly but we were not acknowledged at all. Not even a: I'll be right with you or someone will be right with you. Until that moment, I didn't even know that server saw us. We would have walked out if we weren't so hungry and if we had another nearby sit down option still open for dinner.  Bar was fine. We were given the minimum service in that we were asked for drinks and our food order but we had to ask for refills...while at the bar. Food was ok: I ordered the grilled chicken Caesar and he ordered the steak and shrimp. He said his tasted like a microwave dinner.  I'm not expecting red carpet service at Applebee's but last night was just offensive."
