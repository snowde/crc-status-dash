Alexzandra R.,"Rio Vista, CA",52,6,4,1.0,6/17/2015,"The food was ok, but the survive was complete crap. We barely saw our waiter and it took way to long to get our drinks and food. I'll never eat there again. My friend ordered a drink and they took there sweet time getting it to her mean while they kept forgetting pieces of our order that was included in everything. There was no excuse it wasn't that full and there were waiters a around us and would see our empty drinks but to no avail ignored us."
Scott C.,"Antioch, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/18/2016,"We have had bad experiences here before, but this may be our last. 20 minutes after being told we would be seated in 5 we got our table - only because the greeter cleared and cleaned it himself. It took 10 minutes for our server to take drink orders, and another 15 before we could order food (we tried to order with or drinks - we were ready). 25 minutes later my son and wife got their food, but I had to wait another 15 because apparently the Salmon I ordered was still frozen. My Family was pretty much done eating by the time my food arrived - crispy Salmon with a soggy center. If our Server Lacey (and another we don't know who kept trying to get our food quicker even if it meant duplicating an order (find her and give her a raise!)) had not been attentive there would not have a tip at all. I detest this location, I have had too many bad experiences here and we came only because it is where my wife wanted to go. We both agree now that it will take an act of God to make us come back, most likely after a long hiatus if it even happens."
Yo D.,"Antioch, CA",2,17,7,1.0,10/17/2014,Food came wasn't cooked right waited 25 minutes for another order at the  table that they forget about. We gave up when the manager told us maybe we should find a new Apple bee's.
Barry D.,"Antioch, CA",4,45,13,1.0,2/6/2015,"My family goes to Applebee's about once a month. Normally the service is good and the meals are decent. But tonight's trip was less than satisfactory. It was Thursday, we arrived around 6 PM, and we're seated within a few minutes.  A couple of minutes later our waiter arrived and another minute after that we had our drinks.  Our order was placed and we literally did not see your waiter again until roughly 6:45. My Shrimp and broccoli pasta was hot on the bottom and cold on the top, and the shrimp was soggy.   My wife had the fish and chips. The fish was damp on the bottom and the portion of fries was literally half of what she expected. My children both had Caesar salad with grilled chicken. The lettuce had seen better days.  It will be several months before we return."
Julia S.,"Antioch, CA",5,2,,1.0,11/6/2014,"Service from a waiter not very proficient, 3 cheese chicken pene had hardly any  sauce , server was cut dry short not looking to refill drinks..New management was very nice took some stuff off tab...I will give them one more chance in a month or two..good luck antioch Applebee's.  Ohh and kids food was super late on top of that the he was putting cooks down, people before us was complaining as well."
Jim W.,"Discovery Bay, CA",85,38,,1.0,9/27/2014,"Absolutely the worst service ever. I will not be returning. To begin with we ordered an appetizer and I ordered fish & chips for an Entrée and my mom ordered a bowl of soup for her entrée. They brought her soup with the appetizer, strike 1. Tried for 10 minutes after this to get napkins and silverware to no avail, strike 2. Finally got a manager to come over after another 10 minutes and while she apologized she made excuse after excuse, strike 3. To top it all off after the worst service ever, there was no offer of a free desert or a discounted meal or anything you would expect for the inconvenience."
Stuart Y.,"Antioch, CA",1,6,,2.0,10/9/2014,"Very disappointed.  Haven't been here for a long time, went in late last night around 9:45PM.  Chicken won ton appetizer was tasty, thought meal was going to be alright.  Ordered the Fish and Chips plate, came pretty promptly.  Stuck fork in fish, expecting flakey cod fish consistency?  Fork bounced back, almost bending, literally had to use knife to cut it, more like saw through.  Thought fish might still be frozen, no heated all the way through, just one hecka tough piece of fish. I've had tough beef, pork, poultry before, but this was the first time in my 52 years of existence that fish was like that. Must be Rock Cod and I just got the rock!  Ruined my appetite at this point. Too disappointed to send back, I know, how will they know if no one tells them? Atmosphere and servers were good."
Alma H.,"Parkmerced, San Francisco, CA",1,31,27,1.0,7/4/2014,Awful service! Walked in on a Sunday evening an hour before closing time and was completely ignored by the staff. There was no host! They clearly did not want any more customers. Ended up leaving with no apology. Will never return.
David N.,"San Jose, CA",63,23,7,2.0,2/27/2016,cheap food..can't complain. its the Denny's of Bar and grill.. anyone agree?  lol
Rob S.,"Concord, CA",4,64,4,1.0,11/25/2013,"WAITRESS:  5 stars for cuteness. 0 stars for service.  She was simply not available.  I actually had to get up and go get her attention.  She was too busy flirting with the guys at the bar.  YES YOU ARE SEXY, but that's not why we are here.  Go work at Hooters if that's your thing.    ENVIRONMENT:  GHETTO!  Maybe it was just one of those nights but we did not feel safe in the restaurant and felt VERY unsafe in the parking lot.   FOOD:  WTF??  Small portions of overcooked cold food.  The sliders looked like charcoal chunks put between tiny burned buns.  We will not go back to this Applebee's."
Kara P.,"Brentwood, CA",0,5,,2.0,9/30/2014,"I always love going to this place because of the ambiance, the food and the service. However, last night I was really disappointed when we got seated it took forever for the server to approach us which we have to get the host's attention if someone's even gonna help us. Plus it wasn't even busy at all. The server didn't even check if we were doing okay. When she offered for refill she took the cup and just moved it a few inches away from where it was. She wasn't on top of what she was doing and for the record the next table beside us had the same problem."
David K.,"Discovery Bay, CA",1,4,,1.0,10/5/2014,"Worst restaurant experience in a long time.  Some items on menu were unavailable.  Food took a long time to be delivered and we got some excuse about the fact that we ordered an appetizer..  Chicken was over cooked and dry.  Some random person with grease all over her clothes came up to our table and said, ""how can I Help you?""  ... Might have been the manager, I don't know.  Wanted desert badly (the blondie) but not willing to sit here any longer."
Kurt C.,"Fairfax, VA",75,407,156,3.0,11/17/2012,"Applebee's has for a long time been a favorite of mine. My wife and I typically get the 2 for $20, and we almost always go home with leftovers for the next day or two. With that said, this location has been anything but our favorite. The staff were all friendly, but it just hasn't seemed as good as elsewhere. On top of that, they have either changed their 2 for $20 menu or just have different things than other places. The only thing still on it that either of us usually gets is the 3 cheese chicken penne, and that has been coming with less and less sauce... Watch it Applebee's, or you may lose us to Chile's."
Niall M.,"Antioch, CA",16,320,60,3.0,8/1/2011,"First I have to say that after having read the other reviews I have never experienced terrible service. It was never stellar, mind you, but never terrible. This could be said of the entire experience, nothing terrible, nothing stellar. T.J. Palmer, co-founder of the chain but not currently involved said in an interview that there is no longer any reason to go to Applebees. I would add, except that it is there. It is strategically located right by Rte 4 with no significant competition nearby. Sitting at home with Judit talking about where to eat I cannot imagine suggesting Applebees. However, turning off rte 4, I have been know to suggest a stop in for a bite and a beer. A couple of comments. Happy hour prices seem to be in effect longer than full prices. After 9pm be prepared for loud music and noise."
Cheryl C.,"Antioch, CA",13,263,109,4.0,11/2/2015,"Against my better judgement my husband convinced me to come here today for lunch. We arrived around 12pm, and were seated immediately. Dominic was our waiter. He came by and took our drink order, then promptly returned with our drinks and took our lunch order. I got the Chicken Fajita Wrap, and Chicken Tortilla soup off the Lunch Combo menu. My husband got the All-Day Brunch Burger and Fries. My wrap was good but a few too many red onions. The Chicken Tortilla soup was yummy! I tried my husband's fries, and they were hot and seasoned perfectly. I wish they had more Chicken sandwiches to choose from since I'm not really a fan of hamburgers."
Heather P.,"Antioch, CA",1,14,2,2.0,2/25/2015,Yucky yucky yucky. Half cook food. This place made me sick. I will never go there. Better go somewhere else if you want fully cooked food.
Leo D.,"Antioch, CA",137,98,7,1.0,7/16/2014,"I received a gift card for here and ordered to go rather than deal with horrible service... well to go service is just as bad.... I got ""passed off"" to 3 different people before someone would take my order .... there was barely any customers yet I waited over 1/2 hour for a burger .... then it took another 10 min to pay"
Angelina O.,"Antioch, CA",158,119,84,4.0,6/25/2013,Went to visit today...I had 3 cheese penne pasta and my husband had the chicken tenders..food was excellent!  Waiter could of been a little more friendly
Coco B.,"Antioch, CA",0,13,,1.0,4/28/2014,"Such a horrible experience! Don't even know where to start! 1. My family and I walk in and waited nearly 15-20 minutes just to get our orders in. (Oh- btw this was on a Sunday night around 10:30PM- it wasn't busy AT ALL) - VERY SLOW SERVICE!  2. One of my family members ordered a sandwich and asked to replace the hamburger meat for chicken & confirmed to make sure there were lettuce/tomato/onions- waitress addressed that there was. 20 minutes later food arrives and what was served? - A HAMBURGER w/ NO lettuce tomato and onions. && with that, returned it and waited ANOTHER 15 minutes while the rest of the family finished up their dinners. 3. And to top it all off- WE WERE CHARGED  for food that was not even ordered!!!! I've never been a fan of apple-bees but the family insisted on giving it a shot and we were all disappointed.  The only good thing I have to say about this place is the fact that their shakes are very good! Aside from that- total waste of money!"
Critic V.,"San Francisco, CA",50,34,,1.0,12/21/2015,Avoid going here unless you're starving..you're better off going to KFC or Jack in the Box next door...
