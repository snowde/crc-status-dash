Lupe P.,"Antioch, CA",9,32,5,3.0,9/18/2014,"My visit wasn't all that awesome, but it wasn't horriblem. Food was okay, nothing special. I got full a little too early . Our waitor, Jonathan, was polite and helpful when asking for recommendations on the food. My visit wasn't special. While I was there I kept over hearing the other guests complain at their tables about the general manager.  It's not the first time I over hear people speaking of her. They don't speak highly of her and say her management skills are horrible and she is not very polite with guest. She didn't give me a problem, so it doesn't bother me. I feel that the positive thing about that location was the service from Johnathan . Thank you for the good service ."
Danielle B.,"Antioch, CA",96,58,27,1.0,3/30/2014,Applebee's do you not read your reviews??? You suck I will never go back there even chilis is way better and that's not saying much lol...tear this down and put something good there..waste of space!!!
Cathy P.,"Antioch, CA",0,11,1,1.0,5/7/2014,This place makes Applebee's look bad. Waiter was rude food was cold and over cooked. Will not be going back.
Lynn B.,"Brentwood, CA",27,59,10,1.0,2/22/2014,"We just ate at Applebee's for lunch today. Haven't been in years! The food was ok. The waitress was fair. But there was hardly anyone in the restaurant and all the servers were by the bar, corner table! Loud gossiping talking crap about people. So unprofessional! We won't be back for this reason. I expect employees to be be stellar not sub-par!!! Tell this group of loud girls and 1 guy to grow up and do your job!!"
Cheryl E.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/16/2015,We've been here several times while in Antioch on business.  Tonight the food was terrible.  My husband ordered a steak with a baked potato. The waitress informed him when she brought his order that they were out of butter so she brought him sour cream.  Wow!  Paid top price for the upgrade but no butter on the potato.  Would have expected better from Applebees.
Moe J.,"San Francisco, CA",56,19,467,2.0,2/25/2012,"For the most part this location has been fine...  Today wasn't so great...  Waited 45 minutes for carside order, didn't receive full order & food was cold... My girl called in to speak with manager and she refused coming to the phone, continuously sent messages thru other staff saying they were busy and that she was unable to come to the phone and if we would like to leave our name, number & complaint she will call back... Still haven't called us back... ""Disappointed in today's Applebee's experience""..."
Troy F.,"Brentwood, CA",10,38,4,2.0,9/7/2012,Every time we come to this location is the same. SLOW service - and George the MGR is the worst deflecting person on planet earth.  Lets just say if your meal takes 52 minutes to show up - he feels the chef is giving it some love. Nothing is ever their fault with george at the helm.  I would avoid this location as it will drive you crazy -  this guy (George) has more excuses than a pregnant nun.   Can't believe he is still with applebees -  really?  Lets hire someone that gives a flying @@@@ Tried several times yelpers - AVOID the stress and poor food.
Kammy K.,"Antioch, CA",0,3,1,1.0,4/20/2014,"I went here with my mother about a week ago. There was a party of about 16 sitting right next to us. When asked to move the server had an attitude. We were so close to the party that we had to walk sideways to get the  restroom.  When we were finally seated it took 25 minutes for them to ask us what we wanted to drink and another 20 minutes to actually receive the drink.(they were incorrect)   My mother's food was cooked wrong. Asked for well done and received pink.  It took them 30 minutes to come with our check. The waiter was nowhere to be found. We will not be returning. There were no apologies for the wait or anything of that nature. Horrific service, bad choices, all healthy choices involve a giant mushroom, NOT EVERY ONE EATS MUSHROOMS!"
Angela P.,"Antioch, CA",95,39,7,5.0,1/28/2014,I think this Applebee's is so nice! I am in love with the oriental chicken salad and tomato basil soup that I had tonight. My fiancé  and I also ordered Peach Sangrias that tasted awesome. The atmosphere here was great and even a bit romantic. Our server was very nice his name was Jonathan. My finance and I will definitely be back here soon!
Laura M.,"Antioch, CA",0,11,,1.0,1/4/2014,"Went to Antioch Applebee's after seeing a movie.  Got there at around 9:45 p.m.  Not a lot of people in there.  The music playing was loud and it was rap music.  The two salads we ordered took 35 minutes. We think they forgot to put our order in.   The place just looks bad.  The two guys bartending were nice, but the staff was not the best.  One waitress had hickeys on her neck.  This place was just not a place I am going to revisit."
Huy Anne H.,"Concord, CA",28,32,117,1.0,1/19/2014,"If I could give zero stars I would! Service here is horrible! Even the manager working was rude ! We had a party of 7 come in about 45 min before they closed and first thing they said was we stop serving alcohol. As soon as we sit down, we hear the bartender telling then last call is in 10 min. WTF seriously. Then when asked if we can order a drink, the bartender said ""Nah, we don't have any"" ! The waitress we had kept complaining that's she's tired and not to ask her any questions cause she not all here right now being so tired! Everytime we give this particular location another chance , they seem to get worst and worst ! I just hope they didn't spit in our food for making them work! I hope that the owner of this location get a clue and revamp how this place is ran! We didn't even have silverware ! Pathetic!"
Real D.,"Alameda, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/17/2016,"Me and my boyfriend went to this Applebee's for  lunch.and the fake!.. Kim Kardashian waitress!.. Treated me and my boyfriend like we were criminals we order our meals along with, cocktail drinks.. Our waitress ask to see are IDs so we showed her, our IDs. Then she left and told us that she would be right back with our drinks.. So we were sitting here waiting on her and she came back a second time and ex to see our IDs again so I looked at her in a weird way but we both showed our IDs a second time... Then she told us that she would be right back with our drinks again,. So we told her okay then waited again so me and my boyfriend sitting there waiting and second time!.. Then the third time she had another waitress come over to look at our IDs again so the third time I asked her what's the problem? As I was showing her our IDs for the third time!.. Then she going to tell us to hold on, and take our IDs to a different table where the manager was,  to show him our IDs for the 4th time then she takes our IDs to some backroom so me and my boyfriend went back there where they took the IDS., we got back there and they had our IDs they were all huddling around looking at our IDs so my boyfriend asked what was going on and they told us that my boyfriend didn't look his age and he's older than me he's in his forties and they were trying to say that he was younger!.. And that we were lying about our ages so he end up telling them to cancel our orders and this is the worst service that he ever experienced in our lives!... I mean really! why would I come all the way to Antioch! to play games! with someone time! to lie about my age? some would say it's a compliment.. but I took it as disrespect and humiliation for me and my guy...I would never go back to this Applebee's ever again!... They treated us so poorly and like we were criminals and Liars!.. And all we were trying to do is sit down and have lunch, and have a drink on the side.. wow!.. I guess cuz we were the only black couple in the restaurant I wonder do other people have this much trouble ordering a drink at Applebee's?! we sure did!. Antioch Applebee's sucks! really! bad!.."
teresa b.,"Brentwood, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/19/2014,"Horrible service and wait staff had a horrible attitude! Waited 20 minutes to get drink orders and when we said we were also ready to order, the server just walked away!!"
Margarita C.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,8,,1.0,8/1/2015,"Horrible Service!!!! The greeter was nice. But then we waited over ten minutes before flagging down a waitress to get us drinks. And waited another ten minutes to get our drinks, we literally saw our drinks ready at the bar. All the while two of the servers were chatting with the bar tender while we waited . I then tried to ask to speak with the manager and at first the server  tried to ignore me but I spoke up and said I want to speak to your manager. The manager was trying to be nice but at the end of the day all he wanted us to do was spend more money. He didn't even offer one free appetizer for all the BS he's staff was doing. He actually said that he noticed us sitting there but was too busy to do anything about it. It's sad really because my boyfriend still left more than 20% tip. And I will never go back!"

Coles H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,23,,1.0,1/18/2016,"Sunday afternoon, about 4:30.   Group of four women seated at a booth and given menus.  We made our selections quickly and set menus down. Waited a half hour and 7 different wait staff passed our table without inquiring about our order.  Had to ask the hostess to have someone take our order.  10 more minutes before we were waited upon. Ordered 3 chicken Caesar salads and one salmon filet.  Salads were delivered first and I had to ask for silverware.  Server brought 3 forks and 3 cheap paper napkins.  Had to tell server there were four people at the table.  When she returned she brought another fork and napkin.  Asked server for knives and why they were not included with the fork and was told that she did not bother with them when people ordered salads.  Asked her to bring knives to each of us.  She was put out and brought 4 steak knives. Salmon dinner arrived about 7 minutes after salads.  Salads were served in large bowls with a small amount of romaine, smaller amount of chicken and a few stale croutons.  They cost $11 each.  Small filet of salmon was not hot, was served on three small chunks of cold potato and was missing the artichoke sauce.  Customer had to ask for melted butter to cover dry salmon.  Salmon cost $15.  Total awful dinner with no bread and butter, no drinks & no dessert with tip was $60!  Lousy food, lousy service, never again for this customer.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY HERE."
D H.,"Antioch, CA",0,10,,1.0,2/25/2014,"Everything that happens in this place points to poor management. Staff sitting around talking on the floor in groups in front of the customers. Poor food presentation. One night the MOD spent almost an hour talking to friends in the bar at the table next to us rather than run his busy floor. Our server was desperately in the weeds and wasn't experienced enough to get out on his own. He just continued to get worst as the night went on. The food was horrible. It was either cold or never made it to the table in the first place. Just a mess. If this is what they're doing, they need to just shut it down. They say ""Never Say Never"". Well I'm saying NEVER. I'm done with this place."
Jackie F.,"Sacramento, CA",813,505,116,1.0,5/21/2009,"So you managers found my stickin review for the place huh?? Well I tell you what.... You cannot hold this against me. Yes, I was very mean in the review, but I believe that the 1st Amendment 'Freedom of Speech;' kinda protects me. You know....censorship is frowned upon in this society.  So yes, to the narc who found this and TOLD the managers that I wrote something bad, SHAME ON YOU!!!!!!!!!!! Yes this place is terrible. Not necessarily food wise, but in their treatment to employees, and (to me) former employees. And why?? A certain female manager has shown me the most unethical and unfair treatment I have ever experience in my years of employment. Not only did she showcase obvious hints of favoritism, she showcased many incidents of how not being her favorite can rule against your favor.  Applebee's  in their treatment of me, has violated many laws, and I have full intention of taking as many legal actions I can to have justice served.  And again I say, to the narc that turned me in, show yourself to me. If you have the balls to narc me out, have the balls to show yourself."
Karen C.,"Brentwood, CA",0,5,43,1.0,9/10/2013,"{Writing this review for my mom}   Horrible service.  Waited 28 minutes (yes, she kept track) for anyone to take even just their drink order.     The waiter added a $13 tip charge, on top of the $6 tip my mom left.  My mom went back to get the charge refunded and the manager told her that while he couldn't explain why the additional charge was on the receipt, he said a server ""wouldn't do that"".  He refunded my mom, but also told her not to come back."
Tony K.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",4,288,224,4.0,4/4/2010,Jean was very friendly and not upset that we came in 15 minutes before closing.  Good job on the refills.   My friend stan the man eats here all the time and loves the place. We got the 2 for $20. Deal.    And it was a deal. My pasta was served not warm so I took away a star.
