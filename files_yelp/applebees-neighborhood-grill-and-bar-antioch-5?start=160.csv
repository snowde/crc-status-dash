Josh S.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",3,329,26,4.0,8/4/2011,"Wow, this Applebee's is getting BASHED on here!  Well, I will give it four stars only because I went in last Friday night, and Gene (Jean?) and Eddie kicked ass as our bartenders. There were some assholes there talking mad shit at some of the patrons and a manager, and Eddie and Gene/Jean kept their cool the whole time. They did a great job paying attention and splitting our tab.  I enjoyed a few cocktails as well as mojitos on other days.  Can't say much for the food, had a steak dinner there once a few years back, and couldn't really complain. It wasn't 5 star or anything, but it was definitely not bad either."
Glenda P.,"Antioch, CA",1,5,9,3.0,2/25/2015,"it was fun for a first experience on a Saturday.  but.. if u r a light weight, do not get an AMF (they're good and strong) and then get the 2 for 20 ""all american burger"". I was having too much fun to say anything about the fact that my burger was just cheese and meat. nothing else but bun. wth"
V D.,"Contra Costa County, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/25/2015,"DON'T GO TO THIS RESTAURANT, GOT NO SERVICE AT ALL. We were a party of 4 adults & 2 young children. No one wanted to take our order and after 20 mins. waiting we walked out. We never even get a glass of water and no one tried to ask us why we were leaving. SAVE YOURSELF THE HASSLE!!!!"
Angela D.,"Oakley, CA",33,2,,4.0,5/5/2015,"After driving home from a long day in S.F. We were planning on going to Denny's for breakfast but last second saw the Applebee's exit and decided to give them a try. Ever since other restaurants have came to the area and are closer to our house we haven't been back to Applebee's in many years. Not that we ever had a bad experience it was just new places. However after having quite a few very bad food services (mold) at ch****, we thought why not. Our visit was a few days ago and on a sat at about 9pm. Pretty quiet considering a sat and our waiter Justin felt a little green but did seem to try and no complaints. Hubby and one teen both got hamburgers. A little weird that lettuce, tomato etc was ""upon request"" but Justin brought them out right away. They absolutely LOVED them. I got the salmon... It was good. Cooked perfect, I was a little disappointed on the creamy dill sauce that wasn't creamy. I removed it and ate just the salmon. Might have considered it great if it had the sauce I expected. Last...other kid ordered salsa verde nachos...wow, very yummy. Last night was my bday and after kid sports and no time grabbed 2 orders of those nachos, mozzarella sticks, won ton tacos  and called it a night. So twice within 3 days and yes we will continue to go back."
Christine H.,"Lafayette, CA",1,14,,1.0,12/14/2012,With the exception of the employees that work there I never seen the caliber of people in one room that I saw in this restaurant last night.  Rough crowd.  I was sitting at the bar trying to order something to go and this drug infused meth head of some sort tries to pick a fight with me as he hangs out with his 250lb girlfriend. I have seen clasier people at the some of the dive bars around the bay area.  Skip this place unless you want to feel unsafe while trying to eat or order your meal.
Clair S.,"Oakley, CA",0,7,,5.0,4/26/2014,I recently ate here and my server Kevin gave the best customer service I've had in a while. He was super apologetic when then didn't have many vegetarian options and was overall a really nice person. Service was fast and the food was good.
Felipe V.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,2,,2.0,8/3/2013,"I was slightly excited to go to Applebee's for the first time seeing as how I've heard so many good things about it. When we walked in, the place had a strange musty kind of smell which kinda made me lose my appetite a bit. After we ordered, out server vanished and only showed up after we were done to bring the bill. There wasn't very many people there so I don't understand what he was doing. I had to ask another server for drinks instead of being asked if I wanted a refill. My food was okay. The burger was much smaller than I was expecting, and the tomato basil tasted like it came out of a can and was watered down. Also the croutons used to garnish it felt a little stale. I won't be coming back to this Applebee's again."
Shannon H.,"Brentwood, CA",749,1031,606,2.0,8/14/2010,"This place really is a dump and has even become more so over the years! I have been here a few times over the last few years only to be more and more disappointed. I went here specifically for happy hour a few weeks back, only because they seem to actually make some decent drinks and the Mozzarella cheese sticks are not that bad   however, I was left with a sour taste (not from the food ) but from the same old horrible service I seem to encounter time after time...I mean from the clueless hostess to the extremely bitchy bartender that we unfortunately encountered twice, it was all an absolute joke.....10 min for a hostess to get us our menu as well as to waive the waitress down to let her know we have been waiting for the last 10 min but, what really threw it off was the attitude my friend and I received from the extremely unhappy bartender. I had asked for some extra pomegranate juice to be added to my Pom Martini only because there was such a scare amount and she completely gives me an attitude from hell...this went on for the next  1/2 hour that we were there...no tip from me sweetie....yup..No deserve! Needless to say, I will never step foot into this Applebee's again!!"
Emanuel H.,"Antioch, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/5/2014,We got up and left. Horrible is an understatement when referring to service.
Tricia R.,"Antioch, CA",0,12,3,2.0,1/30/2013,"I'm reviewing this particular visit. Our server (he never introduced us), the check said Mohammad I but another table called him Abraham. He took 20 minutes to take our drink order, another 15 to bring them out, our food wasn't out until we finished our drinks, and then he took about 30 minutes to bring us our tab (I had to go ask for it) and another 10minutes until he ran it. He was a horrible server, worst I've ever had and it was obvious we weren't the only table displeased with our visit."
Em G.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",1,23,2,2.0,7/7/2014,"The reviews don't lie, service here is slow. We got here a little after 9:00 PM and didn't leave the restaurant until 10:30, the place was maybe only 1/3-1/2 full so there's no reason for that long of a wait. Our waiter was polite when he did stop by though and when my food came, I thought it was delicious (lemon Parmesan shrimp think it was called). The Kentucky fruit tea drink is also super good. Overall, I wouldn't come back and endure the wait for the food again though."
Cheryl B.,"Livermore, CA",122,317,43,2.0,12/13/2010,"5 stars for the maple blondie dessert and the lemonade that tastes like lemon instead of sugared water.  Other than that, it's an Applebees. Weird crowd. Maybe I'm a little conservative, but it's just odd to see so many families there at 10PM on a Friday night mixed in with people who want to get drunk."
Barbara G.,"Lodi, CA",259,310,22,1.0,6/30/2014,"Oh where do I start?? Stopped here on our way to a concert. We walk in early for dinner, most of the employees were sitting around a table rolling silverware in napkins, while the rest waited I headed straight to the ladies room, when I was kind of rudely  asked ""can I help you"" I said no I am using the ladies room while she was telling me I needed to wait to be seated. So they seat us then we order finally, our food came out wrong and horribly cooked. While we were getting ready to leave my son in law who was using a knee walker after a motorcycle accident couldn't get down the aisle to the bathroom because they had people sitting in the aisle at a booth, so as he was going around the same person who asked me ""can I help you""? hmmmmmmmmm okay so who appointed you the bathroom nazi was my only question. They just made up my mind that I will NEVER go to Applebee's again. I would give 0 stars but that isn't possible!!!"
Heather L.,"Benicia, CA",4,48,,3.0,10/23/2011,Ok the food isn't anything special I think we all know that. Average chain restraunt food. Alfredo sauce taste like something you would buy in a jar. But the buffalo boneless are really good. I like the heat with that sauce.  ok but the advertise and have sport gear everywhere. They do not have the sport package. So when your going here on a Sunday don't expect to see multiple games. You only get one.  The service is ok. We always seem to wait like 10 minutes for out bill to come after. We have finished eating. Blah.
Kathy T.,"Antioch, CA",4,6,3,3.0,8/4/2013,"We went there Saturday night, we give 3 stars because everything was great, the best actually since the last couple times we've been there were horrible. The service was slow, so we just asked for multiple things the first chance we had. The biggest complaint we had was the FLIES there were alot of them!"
Scott C.,"Concord, CA",0,12,,3.0,1/12/2014,"Decent food, about what you would expect from applebees. I would say it is a step down from chilis. The service was not too bad, very friendly older woman host at the front door. The atmosphere is very dull, kind of dark and dreary. And as I said the food was... ehh not anything to come back for. I came in the afternoon so maybe this staff was more friendly than the night crew."
Cassey M.,"Martinez, CA",28,25,39,1.0,4/29/2013,"Never again will I spend another dollar here!!!!! I have been disappointed too many times and keep making the mistake of eating here since I live near by. Today I ordered a club sandwich which was so greasy that I couldnt even take more then 2 bites before feeling grossed out, it even had barbecue sauce. Since when does a club sandwich have bbq sauce. Waste of money, wouldn't even feed it to my dogs. Save your money and your tummy go elsewhere."
denise s.,"Concord, CA",0,57,,1.0,5/18/2014,I don't come here very often but when I do it's always right at 11 o'clock when it opens.. I read the recent bad reviews but thought well I've never had a bad experience so I went again a couple of weeks ago.  I went in as usual right when the place opened and the hostess said to me ' well officially we are open but there won't be any servers available for 15 minutes as they are all on break' WTF!!! I said you mean there's nobody to take my order for 15 minutes and she replied yes. I just said that's really stupid and walked out. I guess this is the result of the new management everybody's been talking about but I mean really... WTF are they on break from??? I won't be coming here again.
Janael F.,"Antioch, CA",68,22,16,2.0,5/13/2014,First the waitress was very annoying she got our drinks wrong took forever to check on us to the point where I had to ask another waiter to come pick up the bill because I was using a cc the food was ok as well I've been here many times before but my last 2 experiences was not to good back in February I ordered pasta they forgot to put the sauce on my pasta I don't know how you forget that but they did. I love the ambiance on the restaurant though.
Stephen B.,"Antioch, CA",40,8,,5.0,12/4/2014,"After living in Antioch for 6 years and within a couple miles of Applebee's on Hillcrest. I have seen a myriad of managers and staff come and go at my neighborhood grill. I am not a big yelper, but feel the need to let people know that the service starting from the top led by Robert. The staff with bartenders like Amanda, Nick, and Sean. The food 2 for $20 and feeling you get when you walk in, have all reached an all time high and in my opinion  unmatched by any restaurant in the Antioch area .. Keep up the good work Applebee's, the extraordinary changes and professional staff additions have not gone unnoticed.."
