J G.,"Concord, CA",0,59,2,2.0,4/14/2013,For a $10 salad I expected more. I got 7 pieces of pencil thin chicken breast.  It was maybe 40% of the size of a regular chicken breast.  My daughter got a half a sandwich and soup.  They didn't have the soup she wanted but instead of asking what she wanted as a substitute the waitress brought us the soup she told us wasnt good!  Haha ok.  Skip this place.  Go to Dads or chillies down the road.
Barbara A.,"Clayton, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/19/2015,"Order time 5:32 pm.  Pick up time 5:47 pm.  I arrived on time.  I had to wait 8 minutes to get my order.  I drove back to house and unpacked food.  My order was wrong.  I called the restaurant at 6:01 pm.  Spoke to manager and he said to come back and it would be taken care of.  He offered me either a free dessert or appetizer, I said cheese sticks and he said ""Wow, go large or not at all"". Which struck me as rude.  I drove back to restaurant and waited in 10 minutes in my car.  No one approached me.  I went in at 6:20 pm and explained problem.  Young lady at counter said she would check and it.  I waited until till 7:00 to get order (no cheese sticks instead a piece of cheese cake).  I checked order, it was correct but nothing like picture in menu or on line.  I had to drive 2.8 miles in each direction to get my order, plus I had wanted my order at 5:47 not 7:00.  Not that it has a lot to do with this order, but my daughter had gotten me a grande gingerbread latte at Starbucks and by the time I got to house with my food it was cold.  The attitude of the servers was not conciliatory, it seemed resentful.  The exception being the young lady who had originally delivered my order, she was both professional, courteous and friendly.  Sorry I did not get her name.  Very unhappy with whole visit."
Steve S.,"Concord, CA",61,322,116,3.0,1/10/2011,"This place is ok, the good thing is that this place is very clean. But nothi g too exciting. I came here for happy hour and the manage kept turning up the radio so loud you could not even think. Really...this is apple bees right not a club. But I give it three stars because I love the blonde desert."
Paula R.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",13,126,20,1.0,6/7/2012,"Huge disappointment. I am shocked they have stayed in business with the decline in quality/taste of their food and drinks. There are way too many other places to go to enjoy a good time.  The first time we had a bad experience it was our waiters first day on his own, mind you this was a busy Saturday night. Not so wise. It took him 20min to come wait on us. We never got a refill on our drinks. The second time my husbands meal was not at all what he ordered. We were nice about it and the waitress had the ovaries to ask ""so you don't wan it??"" Uggh no you cow, it's not what we ordered. The last and final time I will step foot in an Applebees was last week. My husband and me decided to go out for happy hour, we had a babysitter and the evening to ourselves. HUGE, HUGE let down. I ordered a Margarita and my mouth was watering just thinking about it. I get it and think perhaps thought the waitress thought I was under 21 and brought me a virgin. I told her I would pay full price for a decent margarita. She said that's how they make them. I immediately canceled the rest of our order and we left and headed to Chilis. I had to confess to our waiter that we had an temporary lapse of good judgement and strayed but we were back for good.  I will not be surprised if I drove by this place and it was shut down.  Negative 5 stars and 2 thumbs down!!"
Sean I.,"Oakley, CA",18,124,9,2.0,5/7/2010,"Had a terrible experience there once. Took 15 minutes to get drink orders, and the waiter took another 40 to get us our food. By the time we got it my burger was super stale from heat lamps.  Only thing saving the review from a one star was the manager apologized and comped us some of our meal. Even then we won't go back."
Rick C.,"Antioch, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/20/2013,"Horrible experience Friday night.  When did Applebee's become a bar, grill and very loud rap music night club?  I took my family there and while in the middle of eating they started playing very loud and obnoxious rap music. There were even some young kids (about 8 to 10 years old or so) singing to the song with the words Bubble Butt and those were the tame lyrics. I was very surprised by the foul language from the loud music and all of the families that had kids with them.  It really blew me away.  Maybe I am getting too old, but I thought a restaurant should do something unique such as serve good food with peace and quiet. My daughter's cajun pasta with shrimp was horrible.  No sauce, no spice, and very bland.  She even found veins in the shrimp.  We shared our meals with her so she could get something decent to eat.  We should have sent it back. My wife ordered a medium rare steak, but got a steak barely cooked.  It looked almost blue.  She sent it back and got it cooked the way she asked. On the plus side, my steak was exactly as I ordered it and good.  My other daughter had the chicken ceasar salad and that was good as well. What the night told me is that when you have to resort to gimmicks to entice people to come, then you might suspect the food will be bad and you probably should leave."
Cara B.,"Brentwood, CA",132,16,,1.0,1/11/2013,"We just ate here against our better judgement. It is always slow, cold and the cooks get the food wrong. Our waiter wrote all the details down, yet they brought out the wrong food. We got our food at different times. Horrible. The manager walked around while we waited for him. The waiter had to go back and tell him again. Then when he came, he said nothing. We told him the waiter did correct, it was the kitchen. He did not believe,  Giovanni. I will never set foot in here again."
Liz P.,"Antioch, CA",0,3,1,1.0,7/14/2013,Horrible service!!! And the food is not savory it takes like hospital food blah!
Vince M.,"Antioch, CA",55,97,11,2.0,11/28/2009,"Service was crap! Waitress was rude and only came to our tables to take our order and give us our bill. It was another person who actually brought our food. No refills at all. Food was eh...dry meat on my burger, microscopic portions on the appetizer. Applebees 2 for 20 is a good deal for a night out at a restaurant but not at this location. Alameda one was way better."
Paul K.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,6,,4.0,6/9/2012,"The management must have read the bad reviews last year and fixed everything. I just ate there. The food was great for all three of us. Bacon hamburger, great. My dad loved his steak, mom loved the chicken.The manager introduced himself. Service was fast and friendly. The doorman was friendly. The music was low so we could talk. The floor layout with booths was good."
Jennifer B.,"Brentwood, CA",46,15,,1.0,1/1/2014,Horrible service no drink refill and waited forever for our check. We had a screaming infant so they should have known to get our check umm no the waitress was nonexistent for like 20 minutes and other servers walking by no one asking if we needed anything.. Horrible
Jonathan J.,"Auburn, WA",0,2,,1.0,9/8/2014,"The other reviews should be a warning, had to cancel our order after waiting an hour. Not to mention it took forever to even get seated when arriving. No service at all. The only people enjoying it were the ones completely wasted at the bar -_-"
Darren W.,"Antioch, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/1/2014,Maybe the entire staff was having a bad night. I had to wait 45 minutes before I got my drink order taken. Then another 30 minutes for my dinner order.  My waitress had a nasty attitude and yelled at me!!! They tried over charging me but I caught it.  I will never return to this Applebee the service sucks! !!
W R.,"San Francisco, CA",40,9,8,1.0,10/30/2011,The service was bad making us wait to sit down then making us wait for drinks then our meal takes over 3 hours of waiting is nonsence here. To top it off the food is crap didn't expect this type of service. Its has a ghetto vibe at night and the bathrooms smelled like weed or a dead animal just bad. Hope they get better management or get their act up to fix their problems
Dannielle K.,"Contra Costa, CA",11,59,,2.0,8/31/2009,"It always tastes pretty bad, yet I still occasionally come here because this is one of the few (possibly only) diners that list WW point values of the food they serve. Still, I leave unsatisfied! *SIGH* will my search ever end??"
Joseph C.,"Chino Hills, CA",57,15,,1.0,7/7/2014,"My family and I recently moved to northern California from southern California. Down south we frequented out neighborhood Applebee's every other week. One night, after a trip to the emergency room with our 4 year old daughter, we stopped here at her request. Let me just say, the difference between our old Applebee's and this one is day and night. We got seated quickly, but that was the only good thing about this visit. Took forever for our server to get our drink order and even longer for him to come back and take our food order. We ordered an appetizer with our drinks, because my daughter was starving. Drinks came out about 15 minutes later with no appetizer. After we finally ordered our food it took, and I am not exaggerating, 45 minutes for it to come out. Still no appetizer mind you, and the entrees that did come out were cold. I said something to our server when he took so long to come back to take our order. He came up with some BS story about being short staffed and three people walking out on top of that. When the food came out cold, I couldn't take it anymore. We spoke with the manager, who came up to the table, grabbed a chair and sat there staring at us. He just looked at is for a good 40 seconds, before i finally started talking. He tried using an excuse of them being super busy and one person had called out. He asked if they could remake our orders, but we declined because it was late, my daughter was hungry, and I told him we didn't feel like waiting another hour before fresh food came out. He didn't really seem to care and didn't offer any other solution to the problem. Well, he did remover the appetizer from the bill. But WE NEVER GOT THE APPETIZER! Horrible location. management has no sense of urgency or ownership. I will not be going to this location EVER AGAIN,"
Nancy L.,"Antioch, CA",11,35,,1.0,8/10/2013,"Last night a friend of mine asked if he could pick me up dinner. He knows I am disabled and don't go out much at night and I don't drive at night at all. So I looked on line and what great pictures they have and selected a spinach salad, with blue cheese chunks, roasted pecans, roasted chicken ( I am a vegetarian so asked it to be on side to give to girls, strawberries and blueberries. Now if you look at the picture you will see a beautiful salad. When he dropped it off I could not believe what I saw, so I took a picture and it is now my main photo on my profile. I don't even think their was one strawberry and the few blueberries half were rotten. Needless to say I did not eat dinner at all. It looked like the spinach hadn't even been washed. I called the manager and told him what happened he said come back and we will make you another one. I told him I don't drive at night so he said he will send me a coupon for a new salad that I should receive within 3-4 weeks. The coat of this box of spinach was 10.99! I am on a limited budget and that took part of my food allowance for the week. He could of offered to have someone bring the salad to me.. I would of preferred a credit so I could have money for food this week. So look at my picture and then go to their website and tell me if you think I got ripped off. My little chihuahua's did enjoy their chicken! Don't go there! The service is terrible. I owned a business and would of had someone to that persons house in under 15 minutes and offered it free had I sent something that terrible to them! Thanks for reading my review and really take a look at the picture it will give you a good laugh! Great photographer lousy food!"
Peggy N.,"Antioch, CA",240,324,3,4.0,3/24/2009,"I'm laughing that I'm giving it four stars and Jackie f works here, gets half off and only gave it three!  OK - its Applebees. I have avoided this place intentionally many, many, many times. But it was open on Friday night after my man and I were out drinking at Legends so we stopped.  To my surprise (this goes back at least three years and yes I absolutely remember her!) Jean, the bartender was working. I swore I would never order a cocktail from this spot unless she was making it. I was so so so in luck!  We had seen the commercials for the two entrees plus an appetizer for 20.00 - always thought what a cool deal but never thought we would actually go to Applebees to try it.  Funny how ""never"" works, huh?  We ordered the buffalo bites for our appetizer and two bacon cheeseburgers for our entrees. OMG!!! A TRAY of at least 20 buffalo chicken bites come out followed by HUGE bacon cheeseburgers!  We could not believe the amount of food or how good everything was and all for 20.00 bucks!  Since Jean was working I had a chocotini for dessert - that pretty much put me over the edge!  I'm not sure I ever want to go back to Applebees - I'm afraid it won't be as good as it was on Friday night!"
Carly A.,"Antioch, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/4/2012,"This is probably the worst Applebee's I've ever been too. The costumer service is a disgrace. They will walk right passed you as you wait for you drink order to be taken... sit back your going to be parched for awhile. You order you food finally when ever they get around to you and then oh lets say 45-50 mins later you still dont get your food you have to ask if you can have it. I've literally waited for my food asked the waiter for it and had him tell me ""oh sorry its been sitting out for awhile I'm going to have them remake it"" thanks bud your really looking out for me. I'll never go there again. Just the worst place."
J V.,"Antioch, CA",42,4,,1.0,11/23/2012,"forget about it.  I have given this place multiple tries, and with out fail i leave pissed and dissapointed. First, went into the bar for a beer and it some how turns into a dance club for black biker gangs. Once i find a stool that had old food piled on top on the bar the manger came and grabbed the plate and the bartender ( lets call him a bartender for lack of a better term) takes 15 minutes to tell some girls that hes DJ'ing some weeding. Finally he comes over and takes my order. Since its turned into a full on rave bartender is now wearing a glowing mouth piece, he removes his mouth piece and grabs the lemon wedge with the same hand that was just in his nasty mouth.  Went there for lunch on Veterans Day, and food was aweful... 55 minutes for two cheese burgers and forget about refills."
