Annette S.,"Antioch, CA",3,3,,1.0,12/4/2012,"We went here this past Friday, just around 6:45 pm, wait was to too bad- it was dinner hour after all.  Table was horrible from ambiance standpoint.  Located right behind the Host station.  The host could side line as an auctioneer! He would literally shout across a crowded room to servers about pending seating arrangements.  Just gave the overall feeling of being at a Denny's or something. Waited for a server to take our order longer that we waited to be seated.  We waited over 45 minutes for our food to arrive -according to the over apologetic server, the kitchen was soooooo busy ( shouldn't one expect a busy kitchen at dinner hour? In a restaurant? And perhaps prepare in advance for it) After enduring the wait, THE FOOD WAS COLD!!!! Obviously our food sat in the ""busy kitchen"" for some time before being brought out :( Itwas more than apparent that there was a shortage of skilled servers in the building, it seemed more like training camp for potential servers as there was much unorganized running going on with no productive table waiting happening.  The level of service has continued to TANK at this particular location for about the last six months.  We used to frequent weekly, then new management or something came in, we tried to ride out the quirks but stopped going all together after about five attempts for a nice meal.  This was the first time we had been in in about three months.  We were hopeful things would be smoother and more enjoyable by now however, it was just the opposite.  We will not be going back. EVER!!!!!"
Angelica A.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,10,,1.0,12/29/2011,"Beware - During my first visit to this Applebee's in 10/2011 I found a hair in my salad . . . OK, it happens, got another salad but WOW, 1/2 the size, I guess that's because I had already ""dug in"" (understandably).  When the bill came I questioned the price of the side salad, charged $1.00 too much. Waiter shrugged his shoulder, ""didn't know price"" so I checked menu, told him I was taking off his tip - didn't bother him in the least.  BUT, here is the real disappointment. Purchased a $50 gift certificate on 12/21/11, but my bank statement showed $55.  Called GM and after reviewing charges, he found $5.00 tip had been added.  NOT BY ME!!!  His reply to me was - my word against hers, call my bank and file fraud!!!BE AWARE ANTIOCH APPLEBEE""S CUSTOMERS - Crooks on staff.  Make sure to fully check bill, leave no blank area when signing credit card receipt AND check your monthly statements. You may be paying TOO MUCH!"
