Tony D.,"Brentwood, CA",0,9,,1.0,4/10/2017,"Service was ok, Not enough dressing on Caesar salad. Small meatless half rack of ribs was hard to eat and over cooked. Not fall off the bone ribs. Very disappointing. We will not be back."
Leah N.,"Vallejo, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/22/2017,Food was cold! Even the salad was gross! I will not be returning. Unfortunately I didn't look at Yelp reviews before I went.
Alexys E.,"Antioch, CA",80,334,325,2.0,10/5/2014,I forgot I wrote a review here over a year ago and my experience was pretty much the same. I even ordered the bourbon steak again because it seeks everything on that menu is so uninteresting. I only came here because my boyfriend wanted to try Applebee's for the lulz for his first time before we saw a movie.  The only good thing was the new taco appetizer. A little messy and hard to eat but still good. The unprofessionalism is still the same as last time with a trainee being disrespectful to his trainer IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS.  This is a sad restaurant chain quite honestly and I'm struggling to figure out how they stay open.
Mike R.,"Brentwood, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/15/2017,"Went to Applebee's this evening.  A group of us sat at the bar.  There was a group of 2 males and a female sitting across from us.  One of the males was obviously intoxicated.  As he was continuing to drink alcohol, he leans over and throws up on the floor in the bar.  We told the manager, he asked them to leave but the continued to drink at the bar.  The same guy threw up again and continued to drink.  We brought this to the managers again and they continued to drink at the bar.  We moved to a table from the bar because of the horrible smell.  The bartender is should have never allowed these guys to continue to drink to the point of throwing up.  I will not return to this restaurant."
Adriana A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/18/2017,"Cold food and horrible customer service, I don't plan on going back, and this was my first time eating here, our waiter was the only one who was very nice"
Eliza E.,"Stockton, CA",1,11,,5.0,6/5/2016,At did not want to go there but my friend did. the whole experience was over the top.  My server was very attentive to my kids' needs even the manager when to say hi and asked us if things were OK. The food was delicious (excellent kitchen team) and perfect. I really think this is a good place to be with friends and now I will go for the nice service!!!! 5 STARS for the perfect Management.
Roger J.,"Antioch, CA",443,4,,1.0,4/8/2016,"I have just finished my third meal at this restaurant. Unfornately I have had my final visit here. It appears that the service just prefers to remain terrible. The only person that was of any experience dealing with people was an older hostess. Having been in the business of dealing with people all my life I find allot to be desired about it here. After being seated we sat about 15 minutes before being greeted or even acknowledged by any one. There were 4 empty tables in our area we were seated. Throughout the meal, we saw our wait person once. It was only after the hostess came by that our drinks were even refilled.  This service is similar to service we have received in two prior visits. We won't discuss the food it was not well prepared. As two tables near us sent there's back.  I will no longer be visiting your restaurant again. The service never seems to improve."
Sherie H.,"Concord, CA",98,13,2,1.0,11/30/2016,"Placed my online to go order to at 9:10. Said it would be done by 9:30. 9:50 then 10:00... by 10:05 I was finally out the door. ONLY because I got mad and finally spoke up. If I had not already paid when first arrived, I would have walked out no more than 15 mins into it. Unbelievable!!!!!!  I am disgusted at their customer service. Also, I swear my chicken was 5 months old, well atleast that is the way it tasted. I just moved near this location and will never visit the Applebees again."
Miki C.,"Discovery Bay, CA",43,73,266,1.0,11/6/2016,"Well this is a fun place to go hang out with friends but not really if you want to eat a meal. We waited 40 minutes when our server came and told us there were no more ribs! Then we finally get our meals (hour wait) ok not to find it was cold and not cooked through. Pink, cold pork chop with cold baked potato and cold beans. Not sure I will be coming back here. Not even sure I am going to actually get my meal today! Or my friend get her meal!"
Kyokudoperformance k.,"Concord, CA",82,24,32,2.0,12/10/2016,"Service was slow, food was cold and not at all prepared for someone to eat, I know it's only Applebees but come on guys, You still charge and we pay for the service you provide. Not at all happy with the quality of food or service at this p"
Michael D.,"Antioch, CA",0,8,,1.0,12/29/2016,"Dropped in on a Thursday about 6:00, liked the look of the enchilada dinner. What I was served was nothing like the picture. The enchiladas looked like something from Taco Bell's value menu with added sauce and cheese, the wife's dinner was cold, and our granddaughter's mini burgers were served together on a regular sized bun cut in half. Sent mine back to the kitchen with my wife's, hers was hot when it returned, mine the same. Talked to the manager she agreed it's not like the picture on the menu, but it comes pre-prepared for the kitchen to heat and serve, so there isn't anything she could do to fix it. Won't be eating there again."
Patricia A.,"San Jose, CA",65,7,4,1.0,10/1/2016,"This was the absolute worst ever! Horrible service, apparently there is no Team Work, and management is well aware of the attitudes between team members!"
Gino L.,"Antioch, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/4/2017,The Service was bad and slow and the manager had a fucked up attitude and they didn't have no remorse about it. So we just walked out
Jean H.,"Brentwood, CA",6,252,,1.0,12/22/2016,"My reason for this rating is this:    The waitress brought onion rings to our table but no plates.   We ordered 2 for 20 and both ordered the Oriental chicken  salad . ..it was menza menza (just ok).    I wouldn't order it again.  The onion rings were great!        When we  were ready to leave the waitress brought us ""to go"" containers but no bag to put them in.   All in all it wasn't anything wonderful although it is a very nice restaurant.      The service was not wonderful either.   Too bad.    The salad had frozen chicken nuggets in it.  yuk yuk and yuk."
Veronica D.,"Antioch, CA",10,3,1,1.0,10/30/2016,"Very disappointed with the service. 3 of us there early this evening for dinner. It was not busy at all. 2 of the meals came to the table. I sat waiting for my husbands dinner to show up. My son was more than half way through his meal before Our server came back to the table to check on us. When she did come, I asked where the other meal was, she came back and says I forgot to enter it in the computer :( She asked if he wanted her to put the order in now and when he said no, she asked if she could get us dessert?! Really??? I explained I was very upset. She did not apologize, she used the excuse she was busy and overwhelmed. I asked for the manager. The manager was nice, she apologized, she made an adjustment on our bill like I asked as I was not willing to pay for anything but my son's burger. I am very disappointed in the service..."
Jessie H.,"Pittsburg, CA",36,34,3,1.0,12/17/2016,"The service here is horrible. My husband and i waited for our food for an hour and a half. When we finally received it, it was very cold and missing half of the meal. It took us a while to be able to locate our waitress to make a complaint. After that it took 20 minutes for the manager to come and find us. Many people decided to leave and not wait for the waitress to take there order."
Ipl L.,"San Francisco, CA",1,16,14,1.0,10/13/2016,"worst applebee's   the one star is for the server.     but should be minus 5 stars for the restaurant we were having dinner at applebee's,  there was  a customer at the bar getting drunk. and kept barking like a dog.   the female manager and bartender  found that entertaining!!!! and where laughing at it.   really!   seriously!    we spend over $100 on three meals. all we wanted was to have dinner and relax not going back to that restaurant ever again."
Mary-Christine V.,"Winston, OR",130,5,,1.0,8/24/2017,"We arrived at around 7:50 PM on August 17th with a party of 8.  We waited about 10 minutes to be seated in a booth.  The restaurant was not busy at all, and there were a whole row of empty tables.  We received our menus and ordered our drinks and the rest of our meal.  After waiting about 15 minutes, 2 people in our party were given their salads.  The rest of us just sat there while they ate.  15 minutes later, 2 more people in our party were given their salads.  I was still left without a salad, so my husband spoke up to the waiter and told her that we were still missing a salad, and the waiter replied, ""The kitchen is backed up, so it will be just a little longer"".  We have eaten at MANY Applebee's, and have always had the salads served at the same time.  We had the same issue with our entrees.  Everyone was served except for my husband and me.  By the time we received our food, everyone else had already eaten.  Our two entrees were COLD! My husband asked to speak to the manager, who was not the LEAST bit helpful.  He apologized, and told us that he would give us 10% off my husband's and my food (not the whole order).  We explained that our food was cold, and the waitress near us was chatting away to people she must have known, instead of helping refill iced tea, etc.  Our waitress took away our cold food   to have it remade.  We told her to put it in to-go boxes as our family had already eaten, and we didn't want to have everyone wait on us.  Meanwhile, 1 person in our party just received his wings appetizers (it was now 9:00), and he told the waiter that he didn't want to be charged the regular price since it was now Happy Hour.  He asked for an order of the same wings to go since he was starving by the time he got the wings.  We had to ask for refills of our iced tea, and several of us didn't even get refills.  We got our two boxed up meals, and the person who ordered the wings got the wrong wing order!!!  He just sent them back, and didn't bother to reorder.  When we received the bill, we noticed that after this horrible dinner, we were only given $5 off the bill!!!  My husband again asked to speak to the manager.  Husband told the manager that this was a horrible experience, and $5 off the tab was not going to cut it.  The manager said that he would speak with the general manager, and get back with us. He came back and removed $20 more off the bill.  This was still unacceptable, so my husband went back to speak with another one of the managers, who informed us that the general manager was not on site!!!  The other manager (male) had lied to us!  This other manager (female) ended up giving us a $40 gift certificate to an Applebee's of our choice and $60 off of our bill.  She made things right.  This entire time, that same waitress was chatting away with customers and other employees.  Horrible, horrible experience!  In all the Applebee's where we have eaten, this was the WORST.  Never had this happen at any other Applebee's, and will never eat at this particular establishment again."
Mabel M.,"Antioch, CA",0,3,1,1.0,5/9/2017,Wooow Now I remember why I haven't came here in sooooo long!!! It's been 30 mins and still no food!!! All I order was boneless chicken wings & wonton tacos!!!! Fml smh but yet people that jut got here are eating before us!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!
Nydia S.,"Brentwood, CA",16,147,261,3.0,2/25/2016,"Customer service was okay. Ribs platter consisted of 4 burnt ribs. Appetizers were mozzarella sticks and wonton tacos. They were flavored well and not over fried, despite the expected greasiness that was expected with the chain. Sweet potato fries were fried perfectly not over nor under fried. Kids meals were $3.00 and that makes it less frustrating and reminded me not to expect 5* food quality at a 2-3* price and establishment."
