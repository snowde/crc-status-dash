David G.,"Union City, CA",24,356,1,3.0,12/31/2015,Pretty decent.  Service was so so and the food was alright.  Not much to say about Applebee's but it is what it is.  They did have a lot of good lunch specials to choose from so that was a plus.
Tni B.,"Yermo, CA",139,4,,1.0,10/23/2016,Never really liked this establishment always had problems with customer service . That was almost 3 years ago decided to come back and yet I know why I don't even attempt to come back. With 2 kids  ( 1yr old & 4yr old) waiting was horrible... we ordered our drinks which took forever and we ordered our food before 2 other tables received it last and the waitress never came to check on us and when we asked for something it 20 plus minutes to get.  We will never be coming to this place even if mom wants something from here. All the alcoholic beverages tasted like juice and she had one sitting on the bar for 20 minutes the ice was turned into water. The manager never really wanted to see us and just passed us off to the waitress.
Lesila L.,"Berkeley, CA",0,3,1,1.0,9/16/2016,Like serious Applebees what the hell is this!!! I came in with my sisters to eat and this is what my plate looks like!! Usually we come in with a full plate looking like someone wants to eat it. But this looks like your trying to find potatoes to add on my plates!! Shoot!! Applebees
Ariana M.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,7,,2.0,4/13/2017,Came in at 9:30 asked to be seated at a booth... host made a face but we got a booth  Someone got our orders for our drinks 9:40pm and went ahead and ordered since we knew it was going to take time for someone to stop by again  Drinks arrived 9:45pm  And the appetizer at 9:50  10:02 our food arrives but my mac and cheese pasta was hard as in put in the microwave for a little too long I wish they would of done that to my steak since it was kind of cold in the center  Overall this place is not on the first choice to go eat category it's alright not the best but also not far from the worst. 2.5 stars or 1 star but definitely not 5  The utensils were full of soap scum eh  I know what the restaurant life is like so I try to be a little comprehensive  For an hour stay and only being checked by the waiter 3 times I'll let you judge by yourself on their service  Probably won't be returning and I will try other places
Terry L.,"Antioch, CA",40,26,,1.0,7/26/2016,"Picked up and Tried the new SOUTHWESTERN STEAK SALAD  ($11.49) Mixed greens, hand-cut USDA Choice top sirloin with chimichurri, corn & black bean salsa, cheddar and crispy tortilla strips with a creamy house-made cilantro ranch dressing. Hard to say it was much of a salad. Some how I didn't get and chimichurri very little to NO corn and black bean salsa!!! Not worth the 11.49 I can see why the crowds their has gotten smaller."
Estrella M.,"Pittsburg, CA",56,67,2,2.0,1/9/2017,"We ordered curbside on New Year's because I was craving ribs and it's close to our house. We had been to the restaurant inside once before and liked it. Boy was I disappointed. The ribs weren't tender or meaty and were swimming in sticky sauce. I hated them. My sides were mac and cheese, which was another disappointment, no flavor at all , i hated it, and it's costs extra as a side? what nerve. I ordered a milkshake and they gave my husband the wrong flavor. To their credit they gave him another one at no charge and told him to keep the other one too. However, another disappointment. They don't use real whipped cream. You get a better milkshake at the drive thru, at least they use real whipped cream. They use that synthetic tasting kind.The onion rings were pretty good though. Hubby said his burger was just ok. Next time we want to take out i can guarantee it won't be at Applebee's. It was a bad meal, $30 down the drain."
Kalie C.,"Antioch, CA",0,9,8,5.0,2/24/2017,"Just wanted to say Karel was an amazing waitress!! My family is large can be rude/ demanding and there was an issue with a corn dog being cold, my family was not kind to her . She kept a smile on and was fast and helpful. And there was a change of plans on the bill and she also was fast and did great!"
Amie A.,"San Ramon, CA",1,4,2,5.0,5/28/2016,We have been to our fair share of Applebee's and for the most part not always the greatest experience. This place though has been the best out of them all. As soon as we entered we were greeted right away and seated. Our waitress CHEYENNE was amazing!! Super friendly and was always checking in with us. Great personality as well! Food was great as well. Honestly the best I have ever had at any Applebee's and the cook in the back came out a fees seconds behind one of the other staff when he realized that they brought the wrong wings to us. We changed our flavor last minute but they were right on top of it. Over all great experience!
Joyce K.,"Contra Costa County, CA",1,42,4,1.0,6/20/2016,"Went last night for Fathers Day dinner around 9pm. NEVER COMING BACK. Let me say that our server Julie L was very sweet & the manager did comp our meal $11, but here's what we got: initially ignored while standing in lobby waiting to be seated. Bartender makes eye contact a number of times, says nothing. Wait staff see us, looks around then goes back to their own business. We look around: there are about 10-12 tables/booths with customers & the rest of the restaurant is completely empty. We wait still getting looks but not a single staff person saying, ""someone will be right there"" or acknowledging us at all for a while longer before we start talking about trying somewhere else. Just as we're about to leave, a very polite & courteous young guy comes out from somewhere in the back & gives us menus & seats us. Julie L comes to the table with a smile & introduces herself then takes our order for drinks & appetizers while we look at menu. Hubby orders a margarita on the rocks, received margarita blended. He very politely shows Julie, who apologizes as she says she wrote on the rocks on the ticket & takes away the blended drink to return with one on the rocks. Hubby takes one sip, stirs the ice & sees ***DEAD FLY*** in the drink. I'm grossed out & want to leave immediately but he says to give them a chance bec it's our first time eating here. We flag Julie down, she apologizes & brings hubby new drink which he says is much better so we stay. Our appetizers arrive & they're hot & fresh. We give our order (Parmesan shrimp steak: medium rare, smoked double steaks: rare & egg: over medium) to Julie, who asks what sides my husband wants with his meal (baked potato & 4-cheese mac), then she leaves. She comes back later to ask me what sides I want with my meal because she didn't realize my meal came with 2 sides. So I order crispy bacon cheddar potatoes & mashed sweet potatoes & ask what soups they have tonight then order the French onion soup. She leaves while we eat our appetizers. She comes back again when we're halfway done to say they're out of the French onion soup, so I order the steak & black bean soup instead. A while later, the manager comes out (we assume she's the manager because she's in orange but never introduces herself) pauses to look at us before saying: ""Sorry about the fly in your drink. We really do try our best to get the flies out every morning (YUCK, had that fly been sitting in their ice or on a table since this morning???). We're also out of the mashed sweet potatoes & garlic mashed potatoes. And I know you ordered the French onion soup & were told that we're out of it, but we're also out of the steak & bean soup too but we do have tomato basil & tortilla chicken instead."" So I order the 4-cheese mac instead & agree to try the chicken tortilla soup. By now, I'm feeling like the guy on Sesame Street trying to order food at Grover's restaurant & something's always off. My soup arrives with our meals (it's hot, spicy & tasty) delivered by two other ppl. I start in on my soup when I look at my husband & he's staring at his plate. No shrimp Parmesan on the steak, broccoli in place of baked potato (the manager said only that they were out of all mashed potatoes so what happened?) & his steak looks well-done. At this point, we decide to just eat what's there instead of wasting more time sending it back so we flag Julie down & tell her that's not what we ordered. She looks at it & says, ""oh, you ordered the Parmesan shrimp... Do you want them to put some on top of your steak or serve some on the side?"" She's trying at least. We say no & just want to make sure we're not charged for the higher costing meal & she says that the manager will comp our bill. So we say okay & start eating. I eat most of my soup before starting on my meal: tiny egg on top with the yolk popped & pooled under the steak. Oh well. I cut into the steak, it's just okay tasting. Second bite the same. Go for third bite: *raw meat* the meat was still blue, shiny tendons... Inedible. Switch to corners of same steak & get only one bite before it's the same on the other side. Set all that aside & start on second 4oz piece: I only get just the two corners: raw, raw, raw inside. I have over 30+ yrs of experience with the difference between raw/blue & rare. Please don't even try to say that those steaks were cooked. I just pushed them aside & stopped eating at this point while hubby powered through his well-done, dry plain steak. The 4-cheese mac was okay on both our plates. Julie come back & says that the manager feels bad about our experience & would like to offer us a free dessert. At this point we just want to try to leave gracefully so we decline. Julie brings us our bill = my meal comped -$6, hubby's DEAD FLY MARGARITA= free, hubby's wrong meal comped -$5. With the other drinks & appetizers (apps @ happy hour prices) plus tip we paid +$65 for a memorably awful Fathers Day dinner.  Should've checked the Yelps before we stopped here."
Irene S.,"San Jose, CA",26,42,8,1.0,6/18/2016,This place is just bad. By far the worst Applebees I have visited. Wait staff is slower then molasses and stand around talking to one another while you sit and wait for a drink order.  No one acknowledged us after we were seated for another 10 min. Now how difficult is it to make a salad? Clearly very.  This place needs an over haul.  This is my second time here and last. Dueces
Michael O.,"Brentwood, CA",0,13,1,2.0,9/1/2015,The manager Luis sucks.  He tried to cut us off of alcohol after 3 drinks...saying it's policy. General manager ceasar the general manager came by though and fixed the problem.   He spoke to us respectfully and was awesome.
James B.,"Antioch, CA",12,4,2,1.0,6/21/2016,Worst restaurant in Antioch! Manager doesn't have a clue how to run this place. Takes forever just to be approached. Food is mediocre at best. Chilis here i come!!!
Danielle C.,"Fremont, CA",0,7,,2.0,6/19/2016,The waiter was somewhat nice however this visit was more than disappointing. The service was extremely slow. When we finally got our appetizers my girlfriend found a hair in her salad. Needless to say we will not be coming back to this location.
Tonya D.,"Antioch, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/7/2017,The food was good the service was shitty!! Waited 10minutes for lettuce mayo and mustard!! No silverware and no napkins.
Monie B.,"Antioch, CA",0,13,3,1.0,1/2/2017,"Today was the worst service iv ever experienced... We waited almost 25 mins 4 a damn drink we never received!!! Bartender was playing both that and waiter, both order of wings were extra dry, and had to be drownd in ranch!!!! Definitely cool of Apple Bees, or at least this location!!!! I GIVE THEM NEGATIVE 5*'s!!!!!"
Jack B.,"Oakley, CA",16,11,,1.0,6/5/2016,I had the top sirloin steak however there was nothing top about it I ordered it medium rare and they cooked it medium it was tough and definitely not worth the 20$ the whole meal was pretty nauseating. The waitress was pretty friendly and refilled my coke without asking so that was nice.
China R.,"Oakley, CA",0,7,4,5.0,3/31/2016,"My boyfriend and I go here about 2 times or more a month , it is our favorite place for boneless wings and 2 for 20$! We always get these two wonderful servers . Cori I believe her name was and giovanni. They are our favorite . They're Amazing with explaining the menus and making us feel welcomed. We're never let down with the service ! Love it love it love it"
Kimmy E.,"Antioch, CA",1,2,2,1.0,12/17/2014,"Honestly, my boyfriend and I are VERY patient and understanding when it comes to dining out. Working and running a restaurant business before, we understand that sometimes mistakes happen and service can be backed up due to how busy the restaurant is. But this time was just beyond HORRIBLE! This month, we've came about 2 times hoping that the service would be better, but it got worse and worse each time. The second time was the absolute WORST service we've ever received anywhere! Experience #1: We came in and waited a while to get seated, but it wasn't a big deal because we figured that the host might be busy with Togos (totally understandable, no biggy). When we were seated there were only two other tables, it was not busy at all. It took our waiter about 10 minutes to finally acknowledge us, but he nice so we let it go. We ordered our food and I ordered a Midori Sour (blended). The drink was made on the rocks, so I kindly told him that I had ordered it blended. Instead of re-making it, the bartender just added more ice and blended it and it tasted so diluted and watered down. It literally tasted like shaved ice with a hint of lemon. I didn't want to make our server take it back again, so we accepted it and moved on (Maybe next time, right?). Our food comes out and the pasta was super dry so I asked for more Alfredo sauce on the side. It took 20 minutes for them to bring out the sauce, at that point my boyfriend had already finished his meal so we just packed mine togo. This wasn't such a great experience, but seeing that the waiter was nice and probably trying his best left it alone and hoped for a better experience next time. WRONG! Experience #2: We came in and got seated right away. The restaurant felt so empty. There was two customers at the bar and about 3 other tables besides our table in the entire place. The waitress was VERY RUDE. The food was came out so slow and she got one of our order wrong. We didn't mind that it was wrong, but she was very rude about it.  When the rest of our food came out the Rib-let basket looked like leftovers from another table (see picture). The dish was messy and there was very little fries. The waitress noticed this too and said she would be back with more fries (never did). We asked for more water for everyone and before we could finish our sentence she was already walking away from our table and turned around with a quick ""UH-HUH, yeah"". Overall, the waitress' tone, attitude, and service was horrible. To us, it felt like she didn't even want to be there.  Our friends and families have told us that the service and environment has changed drastically and we should've listened to them. We will NOT be coming back to this location. I hope the management does something fast because the place is getting worse and worse. It used to be so packed and lively and now it's completely washed out.  Now don't get me wrong, not all their waiters and waitresses are bad. We've had some of the funniest and sweetest waiters and waitresses from other times that provided us the awesome service."
Eileen S.,"Aurora, CO",1,28,3,1.0,10/26/2016,This place is just horrible. Every time we get car side Togo they mess something up.! They are real quick to charge you but not give you what you ordered. There is no point speaking to a manager because they don't do anything about it.
Breanna M.,"Pittsburg, CA",9,25,8,1.0,11/28/2015,GROSS! I have been here maybe 5 times within the past 10 years. And it's for a reason. I think to myself well maybe they've changed. NOPE! Still the same nasty a** frozen food and horrible customer service. The last time I had went here was during happy hour in the bar. We sat ourselves and we were sitting for about 30-45 minutes without service. The waiter looked us dead in the eye and didn't say one word. You couldn't pay me to go here!
