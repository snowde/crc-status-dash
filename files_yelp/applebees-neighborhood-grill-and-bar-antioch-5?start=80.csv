Mona C.,"Antioch, CA",66,41,26,1.0,2/17/2016,"Waited for an hour for a to-go order. After the lng wait, manager Luis overcharged me for $5 more! Never coming back here again. Sold all my Applebee's gift cards on Ebay."

Fer R.,"Oakley, CA",237,341,1803,5.0,9/3/2013,"Was craving Applebee's! So I took the family here last Friday (August 31) for a dinner out. It was also my lil mans 4th birthday. I've been here many times and have always had a good experience. Our waiter was Mohammad, boy was he very polite, attentive and on point! He brought our drinks out to us in record time I think! The food was served hot, fresh and appealing. The place was loud with conversations going on everywhere but hey, its the 'Neighborhood Grill & Bar' right?! It was nice to hear the laughter. I felt like I didn't have to ssuuuush my kids because they were being too loud. The 24ct boneless buffalo were eaten as a meal instead of appetizers. Demolished by my 15yo! I had only one (as he gave me the evil eye if I ate any more), the sauce was hot and chicken was moist and fresh. Hubby had the Bacon Cheeseburger. Demolished! The patty was a bit thin for his liking but he stated he was full after wards. I ordered the Roast Beef bacon & mushroom and Swiss Sammy. I devoured it! The roast beef was thinly sliced and plentiful. The mushrooms were sauteed and placed over the thick slices of perfectly cooked bacon. The sourdough bread was lightly toasted and didn't get all soggy. Or maybe it didn't get soggy because I didn't put it down long enough!?! I would order it again. The birthday boy ordered the Kids Mac n' Cheese. A very simple plate of just that. No sides came with it. When we ordered milk with it, it comes in a sealed milk bottle. I like that it came like that. All in all, we all enjoyed our food, drinks and our server.  Bathrooms were clean and smelled free of ""stank"" LOL"
Tanj S.,"Antioch, CA",65,21,2,2.0,10/29/2014,"I've lived down the street from this location for 14 years and have never been here...until tonite. And I was quickly reminded why..... So this just happened... I wanted one of the halloween drinks and was quickly told they were out of bacardi so they cant make any of them insay alrite, gimme a margarita. 5 mins later, I see them making the halloween drinks at the bar. When I askrd, I was told they used house rum and its not as good. So, Im thankful that you didn't want to serve me shitty tasting drinks, but Im not sure how I feel about you serving nasty drinks to other patrons.  Then the kitchen messed up our chicken wings, came out 10 mins after everything else.  The manager comes out and half ass apologizes, blames someone else for not ordering enough rum, blah blah blah, then walks away saying...and I quote ""Well I hope things get better for you guys""  O_O.  Really???"
Angela M.,"Antioch, CA",67,17,15,1.0,3/15/2015,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! my sister and I went out to eat and had the worst time. First off, our server Rachel, had a horrible attitude right off the bat. she came over to our table and rudely asked us if we wanted drinks. not a hi..hello....welcome,NOTHING. My sister ordered a strawberry lemonade and I ordered a raspberry lemonade... couldn't tell if it was actually lemonade, or red kool-aid because it was beyond too sweet. We ordered our food hoping it would be better.WRONG my sister order their nachos with no onions extra cheese and a side of sour cream, I had there chicken penne. My sisters nachos were covered in extra onions and no cheese, large hard peaces of jalapeños that could break your teeth and cabbage. My penne was tasteless oh and my chicken was still bleeding. Its obvious were never coming back. ended up not paying, not leaving a tip and going to wingstop for dinner."
Oscar G.,"Sacramento, CA",39,92,96,1.0,10/19/2013,"Very poor service.  Very poor.  We had to wait for our food.   One of our servers looked like he didn't want to be there.  The other server completely forgot my coffee refill, forgot to bring a box to take our left overs.  We asked for separate checks and we got one bill.  When it came time to pay, the manager screwed up (i have a feeling i got double billed.  All hell is going to break lose if they did). Seriously, most of the reviews of this pitiful establishment is pretty bad, you'd think management would fix the problem.  It all starts from the top.  If management doesn't care for its customers, nor will the rest of the staff.  Will never step foot in this place.   A tip was left though, $2.37 for a $170 bill.  They're only worth $2.37"
Breana H.,"Brentwood, CA",0,13,1,1.0,9/23/2016,"Ok so where do I begin? Not sure if they just run out of food often or only give you 1/3 of the portion of food shown in the picture. Ordered chicken with onions mushrooms and a side of potatoes. Chicken has no mushrooms onions or savory sauce that's supposed to come with it. Order two kids meals with chicken strips , not chicken strips. Literally looks like they gave us 5 boneless wings and called it a day. You want your food to come out at a reasonable time or at least warn when it gets to you, that's not happening here lol. You want a water? Lmao your waiter will forget about 5 times before bringing you your warm water with no ice. The place wasn't even busy. I simply asked to speak to the manager. Lmao oh he knows what everything looked like before it came out , the temperature all the food was at. I mean he's literally arguing with me about my meal. I can say I asked for water 20 minutes ago he'll say no you didn't. No one at the table ate their food. I told the manager I wasn't paying for any of it unless he gave me new food. Told me he was giving me 10% discount and that's it. Says have a good night and walks away."
Don S.,"Antioch, CA",2,4,7,1.0,3/23/2016,I have been sitting here for 20 minutes waiting for a waitress I should've left 15 minutes ago don't eat in this play you cannot get served I'm going to wait long enough to talk to the manager somehow this place should be shut down more sold your own company that can get the job done this is absolutely The worst place to eat.
Lilly G.,"Pittsburg, CA",54,2,,1.0,3/9/2017,"Horrible! I will never eat here again! First I ordered a Roy Rodgers and it tasted like the syrup was rotten, so I asked for a new one and they fixed it. Then we ordered a sampler plate as an appetizer, it was okay except the spinach dip had hard cheese on top that wasn't warmed at all. The platter also had some mozzarella sticks that were cold and tough! My fiancé ordered a pasta with a corn salsa and some fried shrimp he received bland mac and cheese with some shrimp no corn salsa, no seasonings nothing just mac and cheese! He sent it back and ordered a mozzarella burger. After 20 minutes of waiting and as the rest of the table finished the waitress comes and tells us they are out of that dish. He then ordered wings which we eventually got and they were actually good. One thing that really bothered me was I saw a woman push a straw back into a glass with her hand standing by the bar and the waiter served it to another table. I complained to the manager and guess what, she was the same lady I saw push a straw back into a glass with her bare hands! So if the manager is willing to do this while standing at the bar in the middle of the restaurant what is the rest of the staff willing to do?!"
Carla F.,"Martinez, CA",0,50,,1.0,8/8/2016,"I ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  Pretty hard to screw up, right?  WRONG!  The burger was way overcooked (I ordered it medium) and the fries were limp and not even warm. Once the server took my order, I never saw her again."
Richard T.,"Pittsburg, CA",10,4,,1.0,11/21/2015,"The manager Katey said she may or may not have stuck her finger in my food, ive got a finger for her if ya catch my drift."
Deb B.,"Antioch, CA",0,33,,1.0,3/17/2017,"Went in for a salad and asked waitress if oriental salad was gluten free and she said she would ask,well i figured she would ask the cook but no she asked the manager and they told her to bring me out a big binder with ingredients of all there food for ME to look up what i wanted..Unreal..I told her what i thought about that and left!.....I will never go back to this sad excuse for a restaurant.....They hire people who know nothing about the industry and how to give good CS....Its the way of the world now days i guess because it seems there is only a handful of decent restaurants in this area. We have had other issues before and quit going for a long time but this last experience did it never again.I wish more people would not go to places with bad service because maybe then they will make changes for the better if they loose enough business.WE are paying them our hard earned money for good service and food and i expect no less."
Nihad V.,"Antioch, CA",51,137,155,2.0,11/18/2015,"poor service , long wait for food, most of the time tables are really dirty . menu should be better."
Rainy Day F.,"Stockton, CA",0,11,1,3.0,1/17/2016,Come here a lot because I like the food. Not all the servers are very good. I'm a server myself and so I don't judge when my wait times are long or they mess something up because I know how it is but the ive came here too many times when my server doesn't check on me and I see them standing at the bar talking to other servers. I won't name names but this place could use some people who care about their job
Anna G.,"South San Francisco, CA",96,41,37,1.0,5/30/2014,"Horrible. Came back after a few years and the food was subpar.  Also, their service.. Ummm... Service? What service? If they offered any, we sure didn't get any. I saw at least 5 people walk out from lack of customer attention.  Atmosphere was shitty at best.  Never going back here again."
Myrta H.,"Antioch, CA",3,26,19,1.0,6/5/2014,Oh where do I begin...If I could give 0 stars I would. Came in to order food to go. Bartender (Dominic) took my drink order than proceeded to go talk to the other wait staff for 10 minutes - with the drink only partially preparred - thus I got stuck with a watered down drink. My daughter noticed that afterwards he cleaned a glass on HIS SHIRT!!! GROSSSS! While waiting for our food all he did was complain - using profanities - about other customers.  Seriously?!?!?!? Hoping the back of the house does not suck as much as the front.
Melina V.,"Vallejo, CA",200,124,148,3.0,8/6/2015,I'm usually not a fan of Applebee's but the day I came to meet with some girlfriends . It did the job. The food was good. The waitress was friendly. We had kids with us. So the lunch specials and kids menu was perfect and not an arm and a leg. There were so many lunch combinations you could build to your liking. I thought that was great. I just might be back sooner than later.
Amanda H.,"Antioch, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/10/2014,"I was very impressed; Travis was the best server I've ever had,  the food came out in a timely manner and tasted of zest and passion. (Tommy cooked our steaks to perfection).       I recommend this place you want a warm, family-friendly environment with fantastic service and food alike!        Thank you Applebee's; EPITOME of the restaurant business."
Deborah L.,"Pittsburg, CA",5,27,,2.0,12/29/2015,"We've been up here for about 6 months, and have eaten there 3 times. I had some new pasta dish last time and had to send it back - nasty! But, if you stick with the soup and salad you can get a decent meal. Fries are good too if they bring them out quick. I like the bartenders, but service is super slow. Not the fault of the servers, management needs to hire more people is all. Not our first pick for dinner, but will work if we are out running errands and want to stop off for a bite to eat"
James H.,"Oakley, CA",180,19,5,2.0,5/16/2014,Waitress was good. My bacon cheese burger was dry and way over cooked.  Based on my experience and other people's reviews it is highly unlikely I will return.
