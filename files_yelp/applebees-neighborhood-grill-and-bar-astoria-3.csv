Gyaljen Nuru F.,"Mount Kisco, NY",2,51,83,3.0,10/9/2017,"It is okay late night dinner and drinks, they have great margarita but wish they can make little stronger. I am really picky when it comes to drinks but their margarita has nice twist and flavor of lime salt and tequila. Soup is hot and burger is juicy, it is like any other Applebee's but if you want to go after movie here by Astoria Kaufman then not bad idea to stop by for drinks or quick stop. I will come back and I have been many many Applebee's"
Akash N.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,,1.0,9/30/2017,3 shorts word to describe this place. I went to this place to chill with my friends on a saturday night. Racist! Worst service! Unhygienic racist- because the white people came after us has been taken care first and asked us to wait. Worst service beacuse they took forever to take order and bring our food  Unhygienic because the table they took us to after making us wait forever was not clean. They sat us first and then cleaned the table. No apologies were said.
Linden A.,"Astoria, NY",555,2,3,1.0,12/21/2017,"The worst meal I've had by far , Food didn't have much flavor to it , the spinach and artichoke dip was cold and cheese on top was ice cold ... chicken quesadillas tortillas were stale and wasn't served with sour cream ...  chicken on the sizzler didn't have any flavor and shrimps were horrible .. won't be coming back complete waste of money ... nothing there was even close to ok .. need to replace kitchen staff and need more waiters"
Monica R.,"Flushing, NY",86,103,57,4.0,1/6/2018,"You can't go wrong with $2 blue moons and appetizer samplers. Came here on a Saturday night, we were sat down immediately  in booth seats. Thank god because I was thirsty. Everything have became digitalized for example we can order our drinks and food through a tablet on our tables. We had some hard time placing orders because we wouldn't know how many sets of food was being ordered, it was confusing . Otherwise ! The service was nice and friendly. Food was fast. My fav are the chicken wings and quesadillas , and u really can't go wrong with 10 oz $2 blue moons lol."
Sandra R.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",17,88,170,5.0,4/15/2017,"I regularly frequent this Applebee's location. I love the atmosphere and the good vibes you get here. I must also say that the bartender ""Steve"" is so awesome. He makes it so worth coming back such a warm friendly welcoming attitude. My husband and I come back all the time as regulars all because of the great vibe we get here.  So I must say yes we are regulars, you will catch us here on a Friday or Saturday night at the bar.  But, if you happen to pop in here and see Steve let him now you heard you he is great. Don't take my word for it. See for yourself!!!! This Applebee's Will have you coming back and bringing friends.   But don't remember you heard it from me first.   Oh... happy hour like everyday!! Great prices and drink selection."
Demar P.,"Flushing, NY",107,184,499,4.0,6/14/2017,"This is your average Applebees. Nothing more, nothing less. The food was good, however the service needed some work. Our waitress was a bit unfriendly. I probably would not care to come back to this location and would opt for the competitor across the street (Pizzeria Uno)."
Dennis H.,"Astoria, NY",128,78,440,3.0,4/4/2017,"I've been coming here for a few years now mainly for their great happy hour deal. Half off appetizers, 5$ well drinks, and 4$ 20oz domestic beers. They have huge TV's wrapped around the bar, and if you want to hear the TV you're watching the bartender can provide you with little sound boxes to do so.  It's usually a calm environment during the week unless a big game is on then you'll need to get here a little early. The weekends are what you'd normally expect for a place like Applebees especially when you have the movie theatre right down the block. I should mention in this review you can come here for a meal and then ask for half priced movie tickets I think that's always been a good deal since it saves you money from buying expensive concession foods at the theatre. This is a cool spot to come for the happy hour deals with your friends to catch the game however I'm not too crazy about the food here anytime I eat it. That's just my opinion. It seems as if everything is microwaved and brought out to you within minutes."
Danielle M.,"Queens, NY",279,265,583,3.0,7/12/2016,"Nothing really stands out to me about this location. I mean it's ""Applebee's"" haha They are all the same for the most part. I don't usually desire to go to an Applebes but in this case, I was going to see a movie and wanted to eat and grab a drink before the movie started. This place is right down the block from the big Kaufman movie theater. So it's pretty convenient.  We were seated very quickly so that's a big plus. The waitress we had was very attentive and super nice. I mean those things are all good but I gotta say, my booth was pretty gross. My side had food pieces all over it that I ended up wiping down myself. So that was nasty. I know they are a busy place and it's like a revolving door with all the movie goer traffic, but atleast maintain cleanliness lol  The waitress recommended the berry sangria which was very good! I ended up splitting the appetizer combo with my fiancé and I guess it looked better than it tasted. Only thing about it I really enjoyed was the little chicken quesadillas on it. Otherwise I thought the boneless wings were very salty, mozzarella sticks flavorless, and the spinach dip not so good lol  But again- it's a chain restaraunt and I wasn't expecting to be blown away by flavor lol It's a good spot to hit up though if you are going to head to the movies nearby or perhaps a spot on Steinway for shopping or whatnot."
Shannon F.,"Queens, NY",12,47,42,4.0,6/25/2017,Applebee's is as Applebee's does. My wings were great. Of course the drink was weak. But this apple bees is one of the cleanest.
Vanessa M.,"Astoria, NY",278,5,,1.0,11/3/2017,"Extreamley poor service at this restaurant. I will NEVER come back to this restaurant . I came here on a friday night with a group of friends and became instantly embarresed . We came for happy hour around 11:45PM and left at 12:45am still unattended since ive always wanted to try their happy hour and waited for ALMOST 1 hour! If i could give no stars, i would. They gave us the menus 20min after we brought it to their attention, and we waited the remainding time until we realized we had waited an hour. After being told MULTIPLE times that ""our server would be right there."" I have severe anxiety attacks and i almost had a breakdown because of how hungry i was. I felt extreamly hurt and embarrased of how unprofessional i was treated. Dont come here if you want to be embarrased and be treated like a ghost. They never apologized to us and did not offer us anything for it."
Isabel J.,"Sunnyside, NY",820,1466,1100,3.0,4/4/2016,"My review is only for the bar since I have never actually sat down at a table here and ate. I love the bar, plenty of seats and they always have great deals during the week.  Every time I been here its being during the week to grab a few drinks and have appetizers.  The drinks are decent and I like the wings.  The bartenders are usually pleasant and get your order in a moderate time."
Winston L.,"East Elmhurst, NY",14,7,4,1.0,7/5/2017,Every month after my club meeting we always go eat. This month we chose this Applebees. We sat down at 8pm and 2 and half hours in still no food and no check ups.  Worst customer service ever.
Jessica A.,"Queens, NY",81,7,2,5.0,12/1/2017,A few years back this Applebee's use to have poor service. I cannot say the same nowadays the management and servers are amazing!! Makes coming to this Applebee's worth it. Shoutout to Sammi for being an awesome server :)
Ethi S.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",34,28,17,1.0,9/4/2017,Really bad customer service I was just there nobody asked me if I needed help ... I was waiting there  for my pickup and this desi Bengali or Indian bartender is supposed to give me my order and she just ignored me !!
Honey J.,"New York, NY",28,33,10,5.0,8/21/2017,"Christian was really great! Made great suggestions, offered their special drinks - his service was simply spot on and personable. Would come back for him and the discounted movie tixs."
Misis R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2,1,,1.0,11/5/2017,"No wonder the ratings of this place is 2.5 stars!! I should have check 1st before coming into this place! The manager and staff should take some classes and learn what customer service means!! They ruin my son's birthday! One of my friend ordered soup, a freaking soup!! But all of our entrée are served and ready and about to finish our meal and his food is still not out! To think that its not even busy! Chicken in my salad is ice cold. My son's oreo shake was not serve. We had to ask like 4 times where is it. AWEFUL!!"
George G.,"Brooklyn, NY",118,10,,2.0,3/19/2017,"Great Bartender Horrible Food,  How do you mess up boneless buffalo chicken. Had a bad aftertaste where all of my friends and I said it smelled like you poured turpentine on it!   Waitress was ok.  Seemed like the place was also understaffed  as There were a lot of people waiting to be seated yet I saw a lot of empty tables that needed to be cleaned. Oh and ALL these chain restaurants think it is a convenience having these ""I-Pad"" type things on the tables to help pay your bill at the end of your dining experience but not if they can't read your card or if you touch it by accident and get charged for something you did not order."
Yuxin Z.,"Queens, NY",111,27,14,1.0,7/26/2017,"Till this day, I refuse to go back to this Applebee's. So I came here with my little brother who had just graduated. It was just me and him. We ordered buffalo wings, they gave us the wrong buffalo wings. We ordered steak from the kids menu, the steak literally made his stomach hurt so much that I literally had to carry him out of the store which is totally embarrassing. Plus he's quite heavy so that too a toll on my own health. Also we not only waited 1.5 hours for our food but when we called for different wait staff, they were inattentive. We just wanted BBQ sauce and water. They basically denied us a basic necessity, WATER! God, everything about this place is bad. I don't even want to give it a 1/5. This place deserves a -10/10. Please improve upon your food, staff and attentiveness. It would be greatly appreciated."
Robin K.,"New York, NY",332,376,434,4.0,5/4/2017,Conveniently located super close to the museum and the movie theatre! Great spot for before or after an excursion to either two. Open space. Classic Applebee's.
Sabrina F.,"Glendale, Queens, NY",207,213,220,1.0,5/24/2016,This place has customer service down packed but their cleanliness and quality is gross. My husband got the new fire cooked steak the other day and the quality of the steak was the worse he's ever had. I just had chicken tacos and there was a thick black hair in the bottom of my plate as I was finishing it up. Will probably only come for drinks going forward
Akasha A.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,5,,4.0,6/29/2017,Service is always nice.  Good food too.  Affordable and the drinks are delicious. It is also in a good location. Right next to the movies and a Billiard so if you want to play or watch a movie after the options are always there.
Jada C.,"Honolulu, HI",156,280,2188,4.0,5/22/2015,"I like this Applebee's. I find the staff welcoming and easy going.  We got our seats pretty quickly considering it was a Friday evening.  Location wise it helps to be close to the Kaufman Astoria movie theater! A great way to spend your Friday evening with friends, family even bring your date here. Decorated with pictures of movie stars, it adds more fun and more conversational pieces. Not a boring place.  When you order here you can get discounted movie passes to the Kaufman movie theatre!! What a treat and brings in more business.  Go to the back of the menu. You find some of the better deals like blacken tilapia.  Take advantage of the happy hour menu. The food tastes pretty good. Pretty much the standard menu you find at a regular Applebee's. The prices look decent. I usually order the unsweetened ice tea. Something I look forward to."
Mu Y.,"皇后區, New York, NY",16,2,,2.0,4/5/2017,"Watery, sweet, and over cooked mac n cheese didn't look like one or taste like one worse than the $0.69 boxed one in the supermarket. The waitress that was in charge of our table left before we left the restaurant... food was really not worth of the price we paid"
Fatima J.,"Queens, NY",0,5,2,1.0,4/22/2017,"I AVOID GOING TO THIS LOCATION am sitting in this Applebee's rite now service is absolutely horrible. It's been 1 hour I am sitting here  with my friends and they took the order rite away and my order never came. The waitress explained that ""chef thought they were out of wings but manager just found out they have it in stock so they making it now'' and when the food came it was disgusting old and tasted bad, staff was also very unprofessional and was complaining rite behind me stating about how their manager kept them there till closing like seriously!!! DONT GO TO THIS PLACE food is horrible and it's also the managers fault for doing this to the staff and piss them off and they end up pissing customers off will never come back to this place again the food is just so bad. THE FOOD QUALITY OF APPLEBEES FRANCHISE IS WORST THEN EVER. And it's not the first time it has happened to me at this location."
Dimple K.,"Jackson Heights, NY",56,103,4,1.0,12/3/2015,"I used to come here a lot but stopped due to bad service and food. I always go to the Queens Center Mall location. The decor is changed, and I didn't like it. The seats are all high, and you can see everyone eating. i liked how this place looked before. It gave some privacy to people when eating a bit secluded. This place looks like a food court now! Tables everywhere!  Again, I was disappointed. We ordered the two for twenty. Our boneless wings were not fresh at all. They weren't tender either. They tasted reheated and not like the Applebee's quality I usually have. The ribs were horrible! Usually, at every Applebee's location, the ribs are cooked in the sauce. At this one, the ribs were hard, but, and had sauce THROWN ON TOP of them! That's something I've never seen before. I sent the food back, and the waiter owned up to the ribs looking different. She said that our ribs would be fresh again, but she comes back with the same ones! How can I tell? I can tell because of my own bite-mark from my ribs before! They just reheated our ribs in the sauce! And they tasted cold now. We just sighed and had no choice but to eat our re heated ribs.  This location is HORRIBLE! Go to the QCM one! They actually give big generous portions of food, and it actually tastes great!"
Benito M.,"Sunset Park, Brooklyn, NY",18,34,66,4.0,3/4/2016,Pretty cool spot near the movie theater.   Order a margarita mango on ice. With two apps. Wonton chicken tacos ( which are very tasty) also Oder chicken quesadilla ( nothing to special about them but they are edible ).  Me and my  really enjoyed our self.  Loving it.   On to the movies.  Great spot around here for happy hour. $5 margaritas can't beat that. $3 draft beer why not???
Otylia T.,"Manhattan, NY",88,74,16,2.0,5/7/2016,"My boyfriend and I came here a few times because of the close proximity to the movie theater. The 2 entrees for $20 combo with an appetizer is so tempting. But, last night I got the 8oz Sirloin in the $27 combo, and have been feeling sick ever since. Also, my steak was extremely fatty and split into half - one half was well done and the other was medium rare, I had ordered medium rare.  On top of that, it's super annoying to have to deal with the iPads. If you even press on a game you'll be charged $2, even if you don't play it. The service is also slow and unprofessional.  Definitely won't be going back. I had just been to Dominican Republic for one whole week and ate steaks and everything there, and felt fine. Ate a steak at Applebee's and now I'm feeling super sick."
Tory L.,"Brooklyn, NY",276,351,813,3.0,12/6/2015,"Came here for a quick dinner with friends after a Museum of Moving Image visit.  Saw they were offering some of their new dishes for 10.00 as a holiday menu so tried the 7oz Grilled Onion Sirloin with Stout gravy. Ordered it medium rare and as a previous review said it was more seared on outside but pretty bloody on inside, this is not a problem for me as I like my steak rare but if you dont I would advise getting it Medium. The steak itself was a bit veiny but I mean its a 10 buck steak at Applebees not Lugers so....the sauce was actually pretty good and it came with really good crispy red potatoes that were dusted with seasoning, some unnecessary sun dried tomatoes and one huge freaking piece of onion. For dessert I got the churro smores which was a plate of crunchy,warm churros and a little bowl of warm chocolate sauce with toasted Marshmellows on top. Pretty good but my sweater was cinnamon sugar dusted.     The service was a tad slow, our waitress was nice but she was often hard to find and they brought our entrees without knives and we had to fag her down for that and again when my friend needed a pepsi refill which was worse as I had to listen to him dramatically act ike he was on the Sahara!    They also have a tablet on the table which you can order desserts and drinks, pay bill with CC or flag down waitstaff (doesnt speed that up,you  just have to look at a mocking blinking light) but heres the problem with it, it offers a trivia game on there, now lets face it you see the trivia game and youre gonna play it. Well I dont know if there is a warning or if my friends just grabbed it without reading but after playing a few trivia games (which btw repeat questions!) we put it down and noticed a 1.99 charge on the bill for the game! This is like charging kids for doing the maze on the placemat in IHOP!! I wonder how many other fools like us get caught in this trap. I mean its 2 bucks so we didnt argue but still! Maybe if the games were better...ah grumpy old man wave!!"
Sandy V.,"WOODHAVEN, NY",22,67,63,2.0,7/12/2015,"I only come here for my Margaritas, which are always made so well. The only good thing about this Applebee's is that the bartenders are really nice. I personally don't recommend having a meal here. The dishes are awful and the food always looks like splattered school lunch. I love pastas, so I thought the pasta would be alright here. I was wrong. The pasta is always over cooked and dry. I was never able to finish my dish because it always sucked. Then again, what can you expect?  But anyways, if your trying to get a quick detox, then eat up! My boyfriend learned to never eat a salad from places like this. One of my friends got food poisoning from eating here as well. Therefore, I'll just stick to the bar and eat else where before or after."
Arman H.,"SOUTH RICHMOND HILL, NY",156,29,11,1.0,4/11/2016,"I ordered takeout for the lunch combo. I ordered the 4 cheese Mac and cheese with honey pepper chicken tenders and specifically stated I wanted no bacon. I do not eat pork for religious reasons. After picking up my order and eating the food I notice bits of bacon still in the Mac and cheese. Not to mention 4 measly pieces of chicken... I had to pick out the pieces of bacon and put them to the side because I didn't have the time to walk back there and complain. I then call and the host to mention what happened, and she states it's probably because the Mac and cheese was pre-made with the bacon. Well that would've been nice to know before I actually placed the order and stated no bacon... Safe to say I won't be ordering from there again"
Erica F.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",500,332,1619,1.0,5/5/2016,So ao disappointed at this place. They did 1% military discount with is offensive to me. And the host had a long line of wait and tons of empty table
Samantha B.,"Flushing, NY",0,11,2,1.0,3/11/2016,Loyal customer but stopped coming here due to constantly rotating faces. I used to come here when  narmin and Christine use to be behind the bar. Haven't seen them in months and the new faces are very unprofessional  and can not make drinks. Very disappointing to know the neighbor bar and grill has gone down hill.  Ps... bartender Kaitlyn today was very rude and two face. Would pretend to be nice in your face and talk about customers with friends who posed like customers.
Preety H.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,19,1,4.0,4/29/2017,"Busy location. Came here to sit down and eat but it was taking forever so decided to order for takeout instead. Saturdays are extremely hectic so be prepared to wait a good 45 minutes or an hour before you get your table. The food itself was all right , they have good deals (2 for $20) on entrees and drinks as well."
Yaz A.,"ASTORIA, NY",35,18,12,2.0,4/28/2016,"It has been a while since I had a meal here.  The sudden change whoa.. Now having a iPad or w.e on the table to place orders and contact your waitress/waiter... *GASP*  Giving this please 2 stars! I would give it one but here's why. 1. When we was seated we sat there with our menus waiting for a glass of water.... Or to even find out who was our server. Ha! (Ipad to call for help) yeah RIGHT. 20mins later after sitting there clueless and thirsty and ready. Still no sever..  Finally a someone came seen us sitting there with no help approach us asking were u even help or anything? I explain to her how long we were sitting here  20-30 mins now not even a water was given she apologize and help us. until FINALLY our server came and ""taken"" our order.  Time for the waiting game again.. *yawn* food was brought to us after we was sitting in the store total of 65 mins. Not once we was ask by our server if we were okay or needed anything else. Time to use the new fancy iPad again.. Pftt Server came ask for a check she said okay give me one moment.. Goes straight to other people asking them if they need anything and went off taking someone else order.. 10 mins later finally received our check paid for it. The person that help us even when she wasn't our sever is reason why I given this place 2 stars. I even tip her alone because she deserved it.  If your going to make the place more about ""customer service"" make sure you have to right crew for it. And if your going have a ""iPad"" for service help and ""ordering"" make sure it gets done."
Joshua S.,"New York, NY",151,134,37,5.0,3/19/2016,Came here with the family on a night out and was greeted in the front by the nice hostess Daniela. She sat us and I asked her if she knew anything good to eat which she recommended that I eat the enchiladas meal which was very tasty. Our waiter I didn't catch his name but was very nice he didn't have a name tag so don't know who to thank. But he got our orders in and out fast even though this place was crazy busy today he was very respectful and kind this Applebee's is starting to lighten up in there I will definitely be coming again when im in the area keep up the good work guys :) !!
Sarah S.,"Seminole, FL",0,3,,5.0,4/17/2017,"Great staff , perfect customer service. Food on point. Very accommodating. Super fast."
Reinna S.,"Manhattan, NY",5,2,,1.0,11/1/2015,Horrible service ever.  I went there for watching Mets world series. But i went out right away.  Because there's lots of high table area to watch big screen tv. But they didn't give us and didn't give us a proper reason.  Horrible terrible. Sucks
Jessica O.,"ASTORIA, NY",61,131,664,2.0,12/9/2015,"I came here with some friends on a Tuesday night after watching a movie at the UA Kaufman. It was just up the block and wheelchair accessible, otherwise I wouldn't have endorsed this trip. Despite the sparsely occupied restaurant, wait service was inconsistent. My friend and I ordered a blackberry sangria ($9.99) while I agonized over the entree. My sangria was so sweet it made me thirsty. If there was any alcohol in it I couldn't tell and it didn't taste like blackberry at-all. My friend told me that my sangria was downright flavorful compared to whatever water-down beverage they brought him.  Eating at a chain can be tricky. Despite featuring every type of dish under the sun, most of them aren't really palatable. You can usually count on the rubs being so salty they dry out the meat, the protein being inferior, minuscule and overcooked, and the glazes being candy-sweet. At least the menu listed dishes' calorie counts, so I could see how fattening that salad really is. I saw the $10 dishes, but I was afraid to try them because of the reasons listed above.  Finally, I just had to order something; I decided upon the hand-battered fish and chips. Most restaurants can usually provide a reliable deep-fried item. And I was right. The waitress forgot my tartar sauce, but the batter was flavorful enough that I didn't miss it. The fish seemed freshly battered, not something Gorton's Fisherman dragged out of the freezer. Still, I was shocked when the bill came back with a $17 price tag for it. I'm even more shocked that the price for this at the 42nd Street location is $20. For a few pieces of fried fish, french fries and a tablespoon of coleslaw? That's upscale dining prices. I didn't have to suck it up at an Applebees to pay that.  If distance wasn't a constraint I would have suggested we head over to Mighty Balls or Arepas for cheaper, tastier options."
Ken D.,"New York, NY",204,85,4,5.0,1/19/2016,"This was a quality visit. Usually I would have given 4 stars for the wait that I had, but then I found out this poor girl had 9 tables at once. We weren't lacking anything, our party enjoyed a great evening of conversation and the food was delicious. I had the clubhouse grille and my wife the salmon dish and I was floored with the sauces and toppings on the sandwich. It truly was delicious. We also got the Kobe style meatballs, the honey bbq boneless wings and the sweet potato fries. I'd go back just for the sweet potato fries. They were incredible! The crew checked on us several times and ensured we were enjoying our evening. We saw literally 8 birthday celebrations and Applebee's does it right for the people celebrating their birthdays. A very good experience overall from a team that did a very good job."
Nicole L.,"New York, NY",2,15,,1.0,5/21/2016,"I've been coming to this Applebee's for years and all I can say is things are going downhill. For the past couple of months I've been here I've had rude waiters, getting the food cold and getting the food late. A friend and I waited almost an HOUR for our appetizers, and another 45 minutes for our main dish. When you use the little pad to call the waiter over, they never even come to your table.. What's the point of that pad if it's not gonna help?? I don't know but service here years ago was amazing but this past year was nothing but rude people and cold food."
