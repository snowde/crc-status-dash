Amanda L.,"ASTORIA, NY",1,4,2,1.0,9/14/2013,"Find a different Apple Bee's to go to.  The servers are friendly but have majors flaws. First of all, they are very slow. When we got our appetizer (Artichoke Spinach Dip) it was cold and it was one of the smallest portions I've had. Our entrees came next and they were delicious. But again, at room temperature and again, the portion size was off. The server failed to ask how our food was until I finished.  Overall, a very disappointing experience."
Sonia P.,"Astoria, NY",18,110,264,4.0,9/5/2014,"Nice lunch with the family. Had the 2 for $20 but we had to pay extra for the desert, not sure why. The food was good, the servicer was super nice so over all was a good experience."
Nick S.,"ASTORIA, NY",94,7,,5.0,8/31/2014,"Been here a few times over last few months. Last night I tried their Tomato Basil soup. Pretty impressive, was not expecting it to be that good. 12oz steak cooked the way i asked and always a pleasant smile on our waitress who constantly came to check up on us. Kids had fun, everyone are their food. That makes it Another happy night at Applebees!"
Angela A.,"Portland, OR",48,61,15,4.0,4/14/2014,My family went at around 11:30pm on a Saturday night so it wasn't packed. We were seated immediately and our waitress came over to help us. The food was good and the drinks were too!  She was also nice but I can't remember her name. We had to remind her to get my nephew's soda but that's about it. A good experience.
Janice L.,"BAYSIDE, NY",4,4,,1.0,4/30/2014,I tried many applebees before but this applebees has the worst food. I ordered a medium rare steak but it was overcooked and salty. It also had a bad taste like the beef wasnt fresh. If you go here just get appetizers and sit at the bar. The food sucks.
Amy M.,"Manhattan, NY",50,303,615,3.0,4/5/2012,"I've been to many different Applebee's restaurants. They're all about the same. And they have the same menu. This location is good and convenient since it is right across the street from the movie theater. It's a cheap restaurant with decent food. I usually get the mozzarella sticks and boneless buffalo chicken wings for appetizers at these locations. I've also had the pasta, burger and fries, quesadilla, chicken fried chicken. They're usually generous with their portions. Desserts are okay too. The 2 for $20 and 2 for $26 menus are cool. Saves people money."
MK M.,"Jackson Heights, NY",265,283,72,3.0,6/6/2015,great happy hour... huge bar which is nice. overly salty and sugary processed food a downer but hey.. its applebees
Samantha T.,"Queens, NY",18,53,31,4.0,5/7/2014,"I love this apple bees! There 2 for 20$ is great. Its not like small portions, I recommend the burger and fries. There boneless buffalo wings are the best! Even when I am to full to eat I cant leave without ordering them. There happy hour is good to but you have to get there early because its only at the bar. Also you can get a discount on the Kaufman movie theaters across the street when you eat here which is a big plus! This is by far the best apple bees I've been to."
Daniel O.,"New York, NY",140,16,14,1.0,12/1/2012,"Horrible experience!  My wife is a vegetarian and they really didn't have any options for her and when we asked if we could sub out chicken for a veggie in the pasta they made it alot more complicated than it needed to be.  I ordered a hamburger and it was ok, but her pasta was disgusting lol to say the least. Service was horrible on top of this as well.  We saw a manger walking around while we were in and even with empty glasses he just walked past us numerous times.  Staff is attentive because management isn't so I get that, but this really should be addressed. If there is a saving grace its because you can discount movie tickets.  Do yourself a favor and go to costco and get your movie tickets there!"
Erica B.,"Astoria, NY",233,224,59,2.0,6/28/2011,"I have many friends who are employed at ""chain"" restaurants. They have the most horrible stories about what goes on in the back. I'm not stereotyping, this can go for any dining establishment! Basically, your food is going to be taken out of the freezer and put in a microwave. Pretty much anything you order. The only thing to write home about is the decent drink specials. There's also an extensive list of sweet drinks for the ladies (or gentlemen) that tend to be popular. The food is generic and the menu options are endless. Leave your diet at home, kids. Ask them about discount movie tickets."
Tom T.,"Forest Hills, NY",11,1408,62,3.0,3/5/2014,Tasty food.  I liked it.  Your standard Applebee's fare.
Lucas M.,"Flushing, NY",1,4,,3.0,7/13/2014,"My friends and I used to come here often, usually before a movie. I think the only reason we stopped is because we got tired of the menu. One of the best deals they offer are the half priced appetizers at the bar, and that's the only thing I have now when I go. I have never had a problem with the food here and the employees are very nice. Great place to go in a group."
Marianne M.,"Astoria, NY",4,11,,5.0,5/19/2014,"What a wonderful Applebee's! My boyfriend is obsessed with this chain restaurant so we had a get together there for his birthday. The bartenders were wonderful, we never had an empty cup! They also brought him a dessert and sang their signature Applebee's 'Happy Birthday' song which was a blast. Also--the prices there are great, and happy hour is 4-close! We had a spectacular time!"
Anna H.,"New York, NY",152,57,7,2.0,5/18/2015,"I wish greatly that I could write a fantastic review. I've been a loyal fan of Applebees for over 15 years. Sadly after a recent experience I cannot. In short on the way to the bathroom I saw a women slip on a puddle of water. I heard her exclaim to her waiter that she told him before about the water there on the tiles. I was very careful but unfortunately fell myself. Please note that there was no caution sign and no other way to the restrooms. After waiting 15 minutes for a manager to appear, he began to explain how I needed to walk better to prevent the fall. Instead of becoming aggressive I simply asked him to please put a mat down as to prevent anyone else from having to experience this. I saw him tell a busboy to take the one slip free mat from the front entrance and put it in the area where the fall occurred. This now putting in danger any entering guests. The food was average during this experience and our personal waitress was a fantastic human. I expected a lot more from a company I had come to admire."
Diana Z.,"Tampa, FL",6,20,4,1.0,2/18/2011,"Completely disappointed in this location. This place was not very busy and didn't appear to be short staffed. Service was extremely slow. Manager hung around. Seemed as though he'd rather mingle with staff then tend to patrons. As for the server, he never checked on us to see if we needed anything.  He only took a beverage order once when we sat and that was it. We received the appetizer before the Corona. SMH  The fajitas we somewhat edible.  They came out burnt to the skillet. Rice was stuck to the skillet and not so fresh. Tortillas were stuck and tore. And don't even get me started on the limes... dry like the desert. They should be embarrassed for the poor quality in food and service. I will never visit this place again. Save yourself the headache and money and head to Panera or Uno next door."
Manny R.,"Springfield, VA",29,32,24,1.0,2/21/2015,The worst!! I don't get it. How can a franchise be so different from one city to another?? I got their dinner special. Two for $26. Got the spinach dip. It was 30% of the portion I got in Michigan. Why? They say its the special so it's less. Are you serious??? Now on to the entrée. I order medium well sirloin covered w parmesan and shrimp. I get well done steak w no shrimp or parmesan. Now I have to wait for another dish. I won't come back here again. They have a special affinity for ruining a once positive perception of their franchise.
Amanda P.,"Long Island City, NY",0,1,,1.0,5/15/2015,The service was terrible here. I ordered a margarita on the rocks and it came in a martini glass with no ice. My friend ordered a strawberry margarita and it tasted awful. Our cold food finally came and we had to ask for utensils. This led to (not even our waitress) running around to look for forks. We were handed forks without napkins and no knives. There was a separate run around for knives. Neither utensil was wrapped in a napkin and it was questionable whether or not they were washed. I would never come back here.
Peter E.,"Astoria, NY",65,216,123,2.0,11/17/2013,"I went to the applebees in Long Island City and as a novelty and for nostalgic reasons....I used to remember going when I was a kid.  I never remember it tasting so bad :(.  The service was good and the waitress was friendly but that's all I can really say positive about the place.  Oh, also you can buy discounted movie tickets with your meal.  Other than that, the food was forgettable and almost had no taste and the ambiance is generic/boring. If I go just for the discounted movie ticket, I would go to the chain across the street.  I think it's slightly better!"
Margaret A.,"Astoria, NY",69,108,228,5.0,2/1/2011,Love this applebees.  I come here everytime there is a holiday or special occasion! The people are nice and the service is great plus you get a deal on movie tickets.  No one can compete not even the place next to it.
Tony M.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,23,4,4.0,1/21/2013,A good place to hang out for happy hours at the bar. Hazel the bartender is just great and the drinks are just perfect. There is nothing else to add  Just great
