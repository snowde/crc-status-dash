Robert N.,"ASTORIA, NY",10,4,,1.0,6/22/2013,"wow, the service here has really gone downhill.  After waiting 45 minutes for our food we asked our waitress ""Nadia K"" to at least bring out our son's order of Macaroni & cheese.  10 minutes later they finally brought it out, cold.  Since they didn't give him utensils, we had to wait another e minutes before he could eat it.  They never offered to refill the drinks, even though the entrees finally came out after an HOUR.  All of this would be bad enough but the attitude we got was what really had me mad.  I understand that none of these kids wants to be here on a Saturday but they can at least try and be civil.  Skip it and go to McDonald's you'll get better service for no tip."
Tara L.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",158,582,17,4.0,11/2/2010,"I only come here after 10 PM on weekdays for cheap beers ($2 Coors Light) and half off appetizers but the bartender is great, the food comes quick and is really quite good for a chain. The sliders are a perennial favorite and the boneless buffalo wings with sweet/spicy sauce are also really good. I normally don't eat at a lot of chains in NYC but this Applebee's is definitely the exception with the excellent bartender and late night happy hour. It's perfect for me and my husband to meet at when he gets out of work since he works late a few nights a week."
Kristy R.,"New York, NY",368,1402,155,4.0,12/7/2008,"Like I've stated in the past, I normally do not enjoy ""chain"" restaurants but Applebee's has always stood out to me simply because of the spinach dip amongst the other good food. This location stands out (in a good way) based on the service alone.  The food is good, they have beer (always good in my book) the location is excellent but the service, man, the service.  The waiter knelt before us (and managed to make my friend and I feel like queens) and the food was out in a jiffy (yes, I said a jiffy).  And they have a sweet movie ticket deal for the theatre across the street."
Bronwyn B.,"Long Island City, NY",151,155,10,3.0,7/22/2013,Went here with my daughter's friend and her family after her dance recital.  Nice inexpensive food and good breadsticks!  The 2 for $20 deal is worth trying.
Lex B.,"Astoria, NY",8,70,8,1.0,9/2/2010,"Yuck. Both my friend and I got food poisoning last March, me from eating a shrimp & bacon salad, him from a burger.  Run far, far away. Especially if you love your digestion enough to keep it away from largely reheated ""food."""
Joe C.,"Honolulu, HI",201,337,4875,3.0,3/15/2011,Its Applebees.. Pretty standard fare. If you get two adult entrees you can buy tickets for a discounted price like 1/3 off. I had the fajitas last time. They were slathered in sauce and didnt appear to be freshly cooked. Not that great. I like to stick with the appetizers but eh.. thats all I can say
Lauren C.,"Miami, FL",72,60,3,1.0,4/10/2010,"I cannot even begin to describe how horrible the food is at this place- it's well below the quality of your average applebees, if you can even imagine that.  I'm not a fan of any of the chain friday's-style restaurants, especially living in New York and having so much variety available, but this was sub-par even for that category.   I found myself here because a group of us were going to the movies, and we had to find a quick place to eat.  I ordered the sirloin with mashed potatoes and rice pilaf (apparently applebees can't think of any other non-starch sides to offer besides plain brocolli).  When I cut into my steak, it looked more like pork- it was whitish greyish inside and had obviously been defrosted in a microwave.   It was chewy and had a fake grilled flavor that tasted like the burnt stuff on a piece of meat that you usually don't eat.  The mashed potatoes had a dry film over them as if they had been sitting on the plate for more than an hour- they were dry and flavorless.  The rice pilaf was worse than the 90-second microwaveable rices you can buy at the grocery store.  All of this for $16.95- I would have been better off with a burger and fries from McDonalds.   Trying a few of my friends plates as well, I thought of the perfect way to describe applebees cuisine- overpriced microwaveable tv dinners with mediocre table service."
Rainbow L.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,33,15,2.0,4/16/2012,"The price for the size of the portion was not worth it. The waitress did not pay attention to my table. The food came out warm-cool, not hot. (You can tell the food was sitting out for quite some time before it was served.) The place was empty, I would understand if it was busy."
Grace H.,"Long Island City, NY",38,139,62,2.0,9/12/2010,"Well I have happy hour with my co-workers here. Sit at the bar, order happy hour drinks & boneless buffalo wings. Apps are half-off... That's it.  Don't sit down, don't order an entree.  Don't forget to get half off movie tickets too for after dinner."
Geo N.,"Astoria, NY",25,295,1,2.0,10/14/2010,"Normally I do not write reviews on big chain restaurants like Appleebee's but since I wrote one for Uno's might as well for this place. I was here recently. As a matter of fact, I was here tonight! I liked the fact that it was quiet, probably because it is a weekday but even so, the waiters were slow. For starters, we had the chicken wonton taco (if you have read my other reviews, I am a BIG fan of chicken). The other option was pork but I am not a fan of pork. They were really great! As a drink, I had the strawberry lemonade, which was tasty but it was even more tasty when I mixed in my friend's mango lemonade. Anyways, as an entree I ordered the Lime Tilapia with a side of broccoli and mashed potatoes. While I waited for my dinner to arrive, my friend and I ask our waiter for a glass of water. He said he would be back in a minute. More than ten minutes pass and I make a remark to my friend ""he must be fetching it from the well"". Our waiters passes again, asks me if I want a refill on my lemonade and I told him ""no, but may I have some water please?"" He was apologetic since he forgot. He came with our dinner and still no water. I pointed this out to him and he said ""oh, J****** didn't come by?"" I thought *clearly not!* and he left... I WANTED MY WATER DAMNIT! He came by again asking us if we wanted lemonade and I kind of snapped ""NO! WATER!"" and he finally brought us the damn water.  The dinner part was okay. The potatoes and broccoli was great; however, you could taste that the broccoli came straight from the freezer into the steamer. Now here comes the ""dun dun dun"" part... the Tilapia...  The Tilapia was NOT cooked the way they normally do. Outside, it was burned a bit but I didn't complain. The taste was okay. I could tell the fish wasn't great that much because it would crumble off of my fork. -sigh-  My friend's food tasted good though. The aftermath, it's not great. I came home to discover that my tongue is filled with small little pimples. I know I am not allergic to fish or anything I ate, which means the food was either old or the utensils weren't cleaned properly. My friend had problems too. She may have slight food poisoning because she was running to the bathroom.  Sorry Applebee's but I will not be seeing you for a loooooong time."
Sadri B.,"White Plains, NY",5000,1934,449,3.0,11/29/2014,"i had to meet a buddy on steinway, at the pc richards parking lot and decided on applebees for drinks and some end of the season college football. i had dinner already so a few diet cokes and dessert would do the trick. typical applebees decor with that casual sports bar, restaurant theme.the bar area is always crowded , so nice comfy booth, and viewing tvs are easy cause many all around. this place has a more younger crowd then other places i have visited. the menu is pretty well round, but as i have stated before, food is damn to salty. a movie theater  is near by so grabbing a bite before catching a flick is an option i notice , cause when you purchase food you get discounted movie tickets and some folks were doing just that.while the football games are going on , more people make there way in, maybe cause the 2 for 20 bucks menu. is appealing to some folks who are on a budget .the desserts are pretty decent here, i had the chocolate mousse shooter yummy yummy in my tummy, and before i left i did have a second one which i shared with my buddy( i am lying no sharing on my part ,sorry. its was good) i wish tgif had the same dessert options.when the weather permits outdoor seating. very friendly staff and joint is kept clean, so i will be back time to time to hang with my buddy from astoria. p.s. when i got home the yummy in my tummy was rumble in the tummy jungle."
Linda Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",216,191,93,4.0,7/5/2010,"Okay I never liked Applebee's as much, from a bad experience several years ago, but why did I give this place a four star, well for one thing - server was really friendly when I came here for lunch.. also one main reason why I gave this place as much stars as I did.. for every entree order, you can purchase a discounted adult movie ticket for the theater across the street... when a normal feature is usually $12, this discount ticket is $7.50, so get this.. matinee like prices all the time, and anytime.  Sever was also able to split the check, so it was a good lunch."
MacKenzie F.,"New York, NY",4,106,2,1.0,9/29/2012,"I was totally looking forward to some good old fashioned microwaved chain restaurant food but unfortunately it was meeeeeeeeeh and overpriced. I had the chipolte shrimp and I swear, a lean cuisine frozen shrimp dinner would have been better.  (i don't eat lean cuisine dinners.  but i feel like this is an apt comparison none the less. it was not good.) my boyfriend had the appetizer sampler.  he liked it okay with the exception of the spinach dip, which he swore tasted ""fishy.""   we were told the appetizers were half priced b/c it was happy hour, but when the bill came it turned out that all appetizers EXCEPT the sampler platter were half priced.  nice.   unfortunately the literal interpretation of ""Crapplebee's"" was realized late last night/ today. discounted priced movie tix are nice."
Pat C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,48,,3.0,8/8/2010,"If It were not for it's location I would never go. Who ever is responsible for putting this place 1 block from the only movie theatre in Astoria deserves a raise. The food however does not. Service was very decent, they always make an attempt to up-sell which is A) their job and B) annoying - catch 22?"
Habibur R.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",1,12,1,1.0,8/7/2014,"Horrible service. Appetizers came quick when finished, we didnt get our entrees until 40 minutes later and the restaurant wasnt busy. Horrible horrible horrible"
Kimmi V.,"West Deptford, NJ",72,46,19,3.0,8/22/2013,"My boyfriend and I always come here after we see a movie at the theater across the street. I think they do some kind of deal, like you can buy movie tickets at Applebee's for a few bucks cheaper and then eat dinner there also. We never do it like that though, lol. Every time we come here it's usually around 9-10pm. The music is loud, the decor and pictures on the walls are cool. Most of the servers we had were nice. Never had a problem with the drinks and silverware like I've seen reviews on here say. Usually get the chicken fajita wrap, I swear every time we come the food gets smaller and smaller and the price keeps rising! The amount of fries on the plate are progressively less than the last time. Smells like they're trying to rip off customers, or possibly aren't doing as well as a business as they were in the past. But it's Applebee's so I don't expect a 5 star meal. It's just, whatever here lol."
Romana Claretta H.,"Astoria, NY",103,440,325,3.0,5/31/2012,"they have a great deal which is an appetizer, and two meals for $20! not bad at all and the selection is a variety of different tastes. the only thing is, the service is lacking! they always seem understaffed. have to ask for each and everything, sometimes repeatedly. the food is good. i mean its a chain restaurant so its decent."
Samantha R.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,18,3,2.0,2/18/2013,"Overpriced, pathetic food presentation, made me SICK to my stomach and the waiter did not understand the meaning of LIGHT ICE -_- never again...never...again.  Go to UNO's across the street."
Kat A.,"Jackson Heights, NY",0,2,,1.0,5/11/2013,"next time I'm in the mood to overpay for food that makes me feel like crap after anyway I will make sure to go here.  so we went here for a late lunch at 4 thinking it would be quick. Not only did we wait over 25 minutes for an appetizer (we were not drinking) it finally came out and the CHICKEN WAS RAW!!!!! The manager told us he would ""take care of it."" By take care of it he meant the kitchen will bring out another plate of wings. instead they brought us six pieces of popcorn chicken.  We finally got our food 45 minutes later in which two of us ordered soup so I don't know what exactly took the 45 minutes to cook.  Regardless we ate our meals and long behold the check comes and we received no compensation for eating RAW CHICKEN.    So if you want salmonella, raw chicken to be replaced with an appetizer half the size of what it should be, an hour to wait on your entree and a bullshit apology from the manager who offers you no compensation, go here! Otherwise, go to uno's."
Debbie d.,"New York, NY",5,147,76,5.0,4/4/2012,"Friendliest (And pretty to boot!) host I've ever encountered and server's not bad himself! Half off appetizers on weekdays inc Friday, but only if seated in the bar.  Open past till 2am on weekends :)"
