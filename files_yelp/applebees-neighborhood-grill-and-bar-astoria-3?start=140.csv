Christopher F.,"Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, NY",5,28,4,5.0,3/22/2012,This is the best Applebee's that I have eaten at. The service is good and the food here compared to other Applebee's is way better.
L C.,"Woodside, NY",2,6,1,3.0,4/16/2012,"The waitress was pretty cool but unfortunately, forgot about our refills and brought it out late. Did not like the price for the little portion they give, definitely would rather go to Dallas BBQ's, it would've been cheaper and definitely a bigger portion. Next time, I'll stick to my gut feeling."
Melanie Rose P.,"Boulder, CO",716,195,26,4.0,9/18/2008,"Wow. Can't even believe I'm doing this. I'm taking the time to update my review...for APPLEBEE'S. It used to be my least favorite place on the planet. And I probably won't ever go to a different one, but this location actually impressed me. This Applebee's made it's debut at the beginning of 2008, which is when I last visited. I hadn't stepped in there since the Grand Opening, until this past weekend; Though I do walk by almost daily, and will occasionally sneak a peek at the bar TVs for the Mets score. On Saturday, following a very long and damaging Friday night, my best friend and I decided to ""stay-in/local."" This, of course, included tanning at 9pm, so we headed up (down? over? ....in any case, it was East) 35th Avenue. Before we made it to Beach Bum, we passed Applebee's and I, being the slightly unstable baseball fan that I am, stopped dead in my tracks when I saw the Mets game playing in the window.  My friend (who is 6 feet tall and gorgeous, yet can eat whatever the hell she wants...bitch) suggested that we go in so that I could watch the end of the game, and so SHE could order a 12 oz NY strip and double mashed potatoes (BITCH!!!!). We sat at the bar (I was appropriately already wearing a Mets hat/shirt...I told you, I'm unstable when it comes to this), and looked at the menu. While it did take a little too long for us to be greeted (I think my only complaint), once we were it was by several friendly bartenders. We both got steak (considering my last positive food experience and my friend's recommendation I was wiling to take the gamble). While we were waiting for our food, the *CHA CHA SLIDE* came on over the speakers. I, of course, perk up when I hear this song, since they use a cut of it at the Mets games (EVERYBODY CLAP YOUR HANDS!!!). Anyhoo, once he realized what was playing, one of the (male) bartenders did a little twirl and jump...he may have squeaked a little too, and then started dancing his heart out! Note: By the end of this, I wanted to take him home with me.  Before we knew it, every single server on the staff was line dancing (with tons of spirit) around the restaurant. I seriously felt like I was at a Bar Mitzvah! It was AWESOME. I told my friend I wanted to come back every night, just to see this display of enthusiasm. Aside from the energy, the food turned out to actually be very good! My steak was cooked perfectly, which is more than I can say for a lot of places (even STEAK places), my broccoli was steamed al dente, and I treated myself to their garlic mashed potatoes, which probably had a stick of butter in them, but nom nom nom. Since I had already screwed my diet for the night (and the Mets had just won!), I ALSO ordered the Key Lime Pie dessert ""shooter"" which was just as delicious as the first time around. So, no shame anymore. This Applebee's is actually quality! I mean, as far as chain restaurants go, the food was above par, the service was definitely great (The bartender was so gracious, she came back and thanked me a second time after she saw her tip, which I thought was really really nice.), and it was entertaining as all hell."
Lori P.,"New York, NY",44,101,16,1.0,8/12/2008,"I am not a snob. Far, far from it. Hell, I used to eat at ""The Ground Round"" regularly when I was in college. However.... Applebees is possibly the worst chain restaurant on the planet. Yes, even worse than the abomination that is known as ""The Olive Garden"".  Applebees makes you appreciate the sludge you were served in your high school cafeteria. It's grotesque! The staff is barely functioning. It's overpriced and, I swear to god, everything on the menu has high fructose corn syrup in it.  Applebees wants to kill you."
Kimberly F.,"Brooklyn, NY",174,430,25,3.0,12/17/2008,"Its Applebee's, its yummy, its quick and good! This place moves a little on the slow side tho, i hope you don't have to make a movie, cuz you will miss the previews. Other than that, quick yummy food, delivery is a drag, but shut up and enjoy the Zesty Nachos"
Rosie R.,"New York, NY",0,2,1,1.0,3/9/2014,"I went here today with my fiance and a friend we went for a quick appetizer only, the waiter came to us pretty quick to take our order and me and my fiance to drink ordered water with lime. The waiter repeated the order and included in it sprite soda I said no sorry we never asked for soda and then he goes off and brings the drinks. When he brings the drinks guess what !!! He brought to the table watet and sprite and the water not in lime but lemon!!!! I told him I didn't order soda he said oo ok u want to cancel ur order of soda I said no I never ordered it !!! Then they bring my chicken grilled ceaser salad and omg my chicken was so cold and the salad was nasty !!! Food tasted disgusting like if they had it out sitting for a long time !!! I was already angry when then they bring the bill and this dude was trying to charge us for something we didn't even order. We told him we never ordered that and he wants to go off saying we did !!! We ended up paying it cause we not cheap but no tips for him. Horrible food and not all but horrible customer service !!! Will never go back there again."
Justin Y.,"BOSTON CLG, MA",0,6,,1.0,12/24/2010,"When I walked in, the hostess went to the back of the restaurant. I thought she would come back promptly, but I stood there waiting for about 10 minutes. Another employee was there behind the counter wiping and cleaning, she did notice me but did not offer help. After that, I just left. I think it is highly unprofessional to keep people waiting like that.  It was in the middle of the day and the restaurant was mostly empty. I'd understand if they were busy. This was my first visit and my last. People come to eat and the least you can do is show some respect and seat them down even if you are not ready to serve."
Chris A.,"Long Island City, NY",58,108,70,2.0,7/19/2011,Food served warm. It is the most convenient place to good for food near the Kaufman Astoria Regal Theaters.
Queens L.,"Floral Park, NY",91,43,12,2.0,12/28/2013,"I just come to this Applebee's because my kids like to go to the movies and its closeby.  The burger size is so small, they give you little bit of fries.  The service is okay here. Not bad and not good.  A clean place though. The boneless chicken is a little bit salty.  I have ordered The three cheese chicken Penne before and they give you a little bit of chicken.  Not very filling meals.."
Ron L.,"ASTORIA, NY",83,83,3,4.0,10/29/2011,Love Applebee's and this one has a great movie theatre ticket deal with dinner.
Lorilynn R.,"Palm Desert, CA",1030,327,198,3.0,5/24/2011,"We frequent here because its across the street from our favorite movie theater.  Service could be better, but food is decent."
Johnathan E.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,6,,4.0,1/11/2014,Not a long wait. Good tilapia. In and out on a Friday night. Tables could be cleaner. They are a little sticky. Lol
Ece A.,"Astoria, NY",4,32,1,1.0,6/15/2011,"very bad smell,very bad service even the dishes come in dirty oily  plates. I was so disgusted that I couldn't even finished my meal (which was a potato and beef salad with NO dressing No taste) Wouldn't go again"
Tristan B.,"Bronx, NY",4,22,,2.0,7/14/2009,"Oh man. This place. Went here with the lady. I ONLY do booths when I eat out, why? Cuz they're fun and fancy ;] Had to wait a while for one but that was my choice! Compared to other applebees i've been to the decor here sucks! It's all photos of sports and what-not! Other applebees have cool things like deer-heads and traffic signs and it's funky and fun. This place seemed too ""good"" for that. The service was HORRIBLE! Our waiter was some tall black guy and he brought me my drink and arrive with my GFs like 10 minutes later. Our appetizer was cold. We had to flag down other waiters 2 times. And he even dissapeared on us when we asked for the bill! I stood up and asked the manager to ring us up and she was like: ""Again?! I'm gonna kill him, he always does this, if I had a nickle for everytime...""  She even took one of our orders off the bill it was so horrible. I'm gonna give the place a 2 because he might just be a bad apple... but man stay away from that bad apple unless you want it to poison you."
Gene K.,"New York, NY",80,167,3,3.0,3/24/2012,"I could give this Applebee's 4 stars or 2 stars.. depending what you talk about.  So I had a $30 gift card to use and came here for lunch... service was really good.  Hostess was friendly, cute and asked us where we wanted to sit...our waiter was on point the whole time.  He explained the menu when we asked and always stopped by to ask us if we needed anything or if the food was ok, etc... so they were awesome... excellent, excellent service!!!  The menu had a 2 for $20 deal and a 2 for $26 deal + free appetizer... so great value for eating out.   The downside is the food... rather blahhh.  We ordered the boneless chicken wings to start as appetizer.   Probably the worst wings I've had in years!!  Seriously, I mean if you went to your local supermarket and got microwave buffalo wings, they would taste better than these overly breaded and overly salty wings.   I got the Bourbon chicken and shrimp for my entree...very greasy, very salty.  Hard to taste the Bourbon spices described on the menu.  The chicken was better tasting than the shrimp, but then again, the shrimp were small and only 7-8 shrimps in total with potatoes and onions served on a hot skillet.  The presentation looked delicious, the food however was exceptionally blah.  Yes I know what youre thinking.... it's Applebee's and what do I expect for paying a 2 fo $20 meal, and i completely realize that! So that is why I'm giving 3 stars.   I guess it's an ok place if you're in the neighborhood like seeing a movie across the street at Kaufman theaters or on a tight budget to go out, but otherwise  I think I'd only come back to try their cheap drink specials during happy hours and avoid the food all together  :)"
Trixie V.,"Queens, NY",10,95,20,4.0,12/7/2008,"I am a fan of Applebee's in general, but this is one of the nicer ones I have been too. The food is the same as it is in all Applebee's. I love their spinach dip. Don't go to any location expecting fine cuisine and ""diet"" friendly food. DO expect fried, fattening chain store yummy comfort food. What sets this location apart is the service. The service is outstanding, the wait staff SUPER friendly. It's much better than eating in any Applebee's in Manhattan. In Manhattan it is always super crowded and loud, jam packed with tourists and the waitstaff tends to rush you. But NOT at this location.  You can relax and enjoy your meal and the staff doesn't hover. They cleared our appetizer plates quickly and our main dish came fast. We enjoyed the 2 for 26.99 deal and a few beers. They had Sam Adams Winter Lager on tap! Plus, you can buy discounted movie tickets with your meal for the Kaufan Astoria Theaters for $7.50. I will definitely be returning."
K B.,"Milton, PA",1,17,6,4.0,10/17/2009,I've been to this Applebees many times. The service suffers when crowded but overall the food is delicious. I always get the Spinach and Artichoke dip (yummmy). I'm not the type of person to try new things so I always order the Chicken Broccoli pasta bowl w/out broccoli. On holidays it may take 2 hours for you to get seated and sometimes waiters go off and don't return.
