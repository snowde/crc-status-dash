Ana L.,"Brooklyn, NY",45,85,185,4.0,11/30/2015,Out of all the Applebee's this one is pretty good. I came here for happy hour with my other half and we had mango margaritas that the bartender recommended and they were amazing. The chicken wonton tacos were so yummy and the chicken quesadillas were also good. Perks: near the movie theater!
Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",949,1027,25111,5.0,7/30/2012,"Kay, I kind of wished I was more ashamed about reviewing an Applebees than I am...but I'm really kind of not. Even if I do teasingly refer to them as, ""Crapplebees"". I've been to this location twice, first on a movie/dinner date and second with my best friend. Did the 2 for $20 with the guy and the 2 for $26 with my bestie - definitely had a better time with her as the bartender on staff loved us and was AMAZING. We split their spinach and artichoke appetizer and for our entrees she had the spicy Cajun shrimp Alfredo pasta with garlic bread and I had the 9oz hangar steak cooked medium rare with a loaded baked potato (butter, sour cream, cheese, chives, bacon - the WORKS!) and as for beverages it wasn't happy hour but our bartender's service skills were so superior that he comped us a few drinks here and there, made us delicious (and heavy handed!) cocktails that weren't on the drink menu (in large cups mind you) and didn't give us any sugary, sweet, stupid drinks - we spent a few hours at the bar supporting Team USA in the Olympics and enjoying our cocktails. My best friend and I went as far to call it our ""Saturday night rager in Applebees"". The restaurant manager even came over to check on us, see if we were being attended to well - we never felt rushed, never sat for more than 5 minutes with an empty glass and the food - while not the very best I've ever had, it's APPLEBEES, you don't expect the stars, but it was still tasty and and their ""2 for $20"" and ""2 for $26"" are great, reasonable and I've definitely had worse food. Oh, he even let us charge our cell phones at the bar - 5 stars for good food, good times, great bartending and for providing us with a better time than I thought we would have :)."
Eric R.,"Flushing, NY",9,5,,2.0,12/20/2015,"It's been at least 3 years since I been to Applebee's due to the lack of value with my past experiences. I decided to go Saturday around midnight with a few friends. WORST IDEA EVER!! You might as well go to McDonald's. 1st red flag: my server brings appetizers over and sets the food on the dirty table. How can you not even clean the sauce and sticky shit when the last group leaves after their meal???? It's a no brainer. 2nd red flag: our food arrives and we had to wait for silverware. 3rd red flag: I ordered 7 Oz steak with 2 sides. Asked for med rare. Steam broccoli was over cooked and soggy. Red potatoes had no flavor. Steak was cooked terribly, as it looked like raw pork shoulder with a few grill marks. I could of done better with a George Forman grill. The only reason I gave 2 stars and not 1 is because my draft Stella beer was fine and the server chick was nice although you can clearly tell this is one of her 1st server jobs.   Come here for drinks at the bar but if your hungry, save your money and go to UNO across the street."
Brenda C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,1,2.0,3/15/2015,"On Sunday, 3/15/2015, I was in the neighborhood to see a movie and decided to have a burger.   I ordered a mushroom swiss burger (well done) with sauteed onions and  fries.  When I receieved my order, the bun was hard around the edges and the burger was actually crunchy, the fries were lukewarm, (I stressed to the waitress to please make sure that the fries are HOT;  Who wants fries any other way), and I didnt  receive my sauteed onoins! I requested to see the Manager on duty.  When he got to the the table, I explained my displeasure,   he seemed not to understand that my burger was hard and crunchy and that my bun was hard around the edges. He had a baffled look on his face, and was trying to explain away the terrible food, instead of being accommodating.  I had to tell him that I wanted a whole new plate of food which I eventually got.  Needless to say, the burger and buns were just okay and the fries were not hot (I couldn't eat them) and they didn't bring my sauteed onions out with my food, and when they got to me, they were cool and not cooked well ( I sent them back).  This is not my first time visiting this Applebee's and ordering the exact same items.  I won't be back!"
Christina A.,"Long Island City, NY",128,1,,5.0,7/17/2016,"Bartender was super fast and friendly! They have great happy hour deals everyday of the week (including weekends) from 4pm to close! $6 mucho long islands, $5 Bahamas mama, margarita and craft beer, $4 domestics, wine and well drinks. Also half price appetizers!! They also offer discounted movie tickets with food purchase of you want to make a day of it. Love this Applebee's.."
Richard R.,"Loveland, OH",12,27,7,1.0,12/7/2015,"The food here sucks... The grilled chicken was burnt and dry.   The rice was dry without flavor.   The steamed vegetables had butter all over them... Don't waste your time or money....  No wonder I never eat at Applebee's... Shit food If I could leave no stars I could...  Waitress said the manager took everything off my bill,  but the manager never leave out to apologize.... Hiding in the kitchen I guess"
Andrew D.,"Manhattan, NY",159,2,1,2.0,6/26/2016,"Ask and you shall not receive. Asked for an additional ""trough"" of ranch and did not receive it with our meals."
Aura V.,"OZONE PARK, NY",68,9,3,1.0,3/13/2016,"We have been to a few Applebee's in queens and to be honest, this place was probably the worst I've ever experienced.  We wanted to go to dinner somewhere close to the bowling alley we were planning to go to, so we picked Applebee's as a safe choice. We went in already knowing for 10 people it would be a bit of a wait. The hostess told us we would be waiting about 20 minutes and were okay with that. I'm not gonna lie, it got pretty packed quick. But we kept seeing people after us getting seated and I still didn't say anything. Twenty or so minutes passed and I asked the hostess if our table will be ready son . She assured me that they were just waiting to set up a table for all of us. I was like okay and she told us to wait. A group of six people, who arrived five minutes after I spoke with the hostess, ended up getting seated before us. I was a bit annoyed at this point, so I went up to her and asked her what was taking so long? She told me she was waiting on a table for ten people so she can seat is. I told her, ""then why sit six people who came AFTER us before us when you could've cleared an extra table to sit us right away?"" And she just said for us to wait. Mind you, we were there for almost an hour and at this point I was losing patience. The waitresses and the hostess looked like they were fresh out of higher school and this is their first job in handling a fast paced environment. The manager came to me to assure us that our table will be ready in five minutes. We didn't get seated till another 15 minutes. On top of that, our own waitress kept getting our orders wrong. And when it came to paying the bill I had to stand next to her to explain how we are splitting the bill. And she didn't give us the right bill when she added the birthday desert. How can you not see the dollar difference?! Anyways, I was so deeply disappointed in all this that we left a $10 tip on a $200 bill. They're even lucky to get any sort of tip to begin with.  Overall, this place is horrible. They better hire actual adults to handle their business better."
Erika Y.,"Woodside, NY",210,257,162,2.0,1/16/2015,"I typically do not eat at chain restaurants unless I am in a rush or I am being dragged there by someone else. In this case, I had a movie to catch, and Applebee's offers a cool deal where you can buy movie tickets at a reduced price with your meal $8.50 per ticket). I ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp and my boyfriend ordered the Three Cheese Chicken Penne. Both were on the 2 for $26 menu, so it can with one appetizer. We decided on the boneless chicken.  My entree was alright. The chicken wasn' t seasonsoned to my liking and I didnt taste the garlic in the mash potatoes, even though the waitress told me it had garlic in it. My plate was sizzling for sure; however, the appetizer and the pasta dish was warm. My boyfriend found a piece of plastic in the pasta that had the shape of a toe nail clipping. Let's say we  didn't finish the food.  The staff seemed very friendly, which made the experience better, but I will likely not be coming back here even with the reduced price movie tickets."
Nazia K.,"Flushing, NY",62,26,,3.0,4/29/2016,"I used to love deir deir burger wid ground beef n supper crispy onion but dey hv stopped serving da dish , hv tried deir combo steaks n etc but dint find anything as yummy as deir burger."
Kora B.,"Queens, NY",3,9,3,1.0,2/28/2016,"SERVICE is horrible; I was waiting for food around 20 min. Whan it did not arrive I ask where is the food She told they were searching who ordered that food but they could not find the guest??!! I got the plate finally and it was not what I ordered. The guest who was sitting next to me was complaining about the quality of her food. We agreed this is the first time we were in here. In my 44 years of my life, this was the worst service ever. Definitely, I will go to the next block Mexican restaurant."
Daniel s.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,15,,2.0,11/10/2014,"Hi, I visited your Astoria location (35th Ave) on 11/9/14. My girlfriend and I arrived at 1pm for your happy hour (1/2 off appetizers, $3 domestic drafts). I asked to order a Sam Adam Rebel IPA, which our server confirmed was actually a Bottle beer and would be $5. I changed my order to Sam Adams Winter Lager, which is a Draft, and brewed in the good ole USA. My girlfriend ordered a Blue Moon, from lovely Boulder Colorado. We continued to order Sam Adams and Blue Moons while eating a selection of your delicious appetizer offerings. When our bill arrived, we were surprised to see that we were actually charged $5 per beer. I figured it was a simple mistake. I brought it up to our server, who replied ""Sam Adams and Blue are ""expensive beers""."" Now I may be confused, which is why I took a picture of your menu to make sure it didn't say ""$3 cheap drafts"", which it of course didn't. I am very unhappy with this mislabeling of your services. I will proceed to enjoy my Sunday happy hours at Pizzeria Uno, which is directly across the street and does not distinguish between ""Cheap"" and ""Expensive"" domestic beers when advertising their ""$3 DOMESTIC Drafts"" Please email me at   with any thoughts you may have regarding this unfortunate situation. I have pictures of receipt and menu, should they be needed."
Hadessa M.,"Woodside, NY",42,16,59,5.0,5/3/2015,"Just a little wait to sitting but after that they serve the food petty quickly, and delicious food. High recommend with friends and family."
Carlos C.,"Brooklyn, NY",184,557,36,3.0,1/6/2016,"By far the fastest service I've ever received at Applebee's. Food came quick as in five minutes quick. I had the Whisky shot chicken with shrimp, it was salty and those cheddar jalapeno mash potatoes, lacked jalapenos, it tasted like cheesy mash potatoes. The waitress did not  refilled our glasses with water, but I won't hold that against her, she was busting lots of tables. So far so good, and a three from a non fan of this restaurant chain says a lot."
Jamal R.,"New York, NY",1,2,6,1.0,11/22/2014,I'm mad I had to give it a star to comment on how horrible there food is worst night ever!
Melissa C.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",29,33,10,1.0,12/6/2015,"I use to come here often, but stopped because I wasn't a fan of their food. Came in on a Sunday afternoon and Ordered the appetizer sampler, everything was ok, except that our wings were COLD! The manager came over and offered a new order of wings, which was nice of him. But Their drinks are watered down, and their food is not all that great. I will not be returning."
Cheryl B.,"Astoria, NY",43,154,129,5.0,3/21/2015,"Quick serving of our orders, which was key since we were going to the movies.  Pamela was very attentive to our table but not so attentive to be annoying.   *That's key-to all of you over-bearing waiters and non-existent ones too! Only issue, was my Bahama Mama alcohol-less?!?  Seemed so to me!  My son said maybe it's to prevent drinking and driving...but ummmmm, I don't drive...."
Billy V.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",580,500,655,4.0,8/29/2014,"OK, don't hate me for reviewing a chain restaurant, Applebee's, but ""i Like"". This location is right off Steinway and down the street form Regal Movie Theater. This location like other chain restaurants have deals. I love deals. Happy Hour, half price app's, $3 domestic, $5 import, discounted margaritas and all the other discounts you see on TV. Happy Hour only available at bar area. Since I like the deal, I have to sometimes compromise in choices. So, for $3 I need to drink Bud Light and Coors Light. Not the end of the world.  Appetizers very good; wings, chicken strips, poppers, etc. All standard bar food. Nothing to write home about, but when you are enjoying adult beverages; they hit the stop; good. What sells the place for me is their 4 huge HDTVs by the bar. Great place to catch a game and enjoy a decently price beverage. Bar service very good. Fast and attentive. Very friendly. No attitude in the house. Very nice. Overall, Applebee's is not the place I usually go to, but it is a nice change where I can enjoy a couple of beers, watch the game and snack on some tasty app's."
Mohammad B.,"Floral Park, NY",107,6,,5.0,10/23/2016,"If you're looking for quality service, always ask the front of the house if Adiba is available or what section she is working. I've visited this location multiple times. Always before going to watch a movie at Kaufman. I had her as my server for back to back visits when I first started watching movies at Kaufman and wanted to grab a couple of drinks in case the movie ended up being a drag. Anyway, Adiba never fails to have my company and I seated quickly and always gets our food and drinks out in a hurry. She remembers orders and even makes sure the food is prepared and handled exactly to my liking. I am a very picky eater and I have no complaints about her. She is great and a very engaging young woman. Honestly, many of you reading this can think it's Applebees, but I come here for the service and knowing I'll be seated by someone that can make my drinking and dining experience enjoyable."
Michelle Z.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",5,1,,1.0,6/30/2016,"The worst service out there, hands down the waitresses and hostess don't even know that they're at work. There is rarely any people on the floor to take orders or even greet people, like should I just sit myself and go to the kitchen to place my order as well? First waited 20 mins to get seated when it was clearly not busy at all at the inside or outdoors tables. After finally telling a manager who appeared from thin air about the wait and being seated waited another 20mins before flagging down our waitress. Food arrived at our table about an hour later overcooked and not even hot anymore both burgers too rare and the fried egg on top was more like a slab of burnt egg whites. Took way too long to get drinks to the table just overall horrible experience. Manager was nice enough to comp our bill, but def wouldn't recommend going to this location at all!!!"
