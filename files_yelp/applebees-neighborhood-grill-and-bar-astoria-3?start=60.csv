Risca P.,"Elmhurst, NY",181,116,90,2.0,7/22/2015,"Came here last night with my bestie. It was a hot day and we were both starving. Came in at around 7pm and it was not too crowded. We were told that no seats at the booth were available so we agreed to sit at one of the regular tables. As we made our way to the table, I saw PLENTY of booth seats that were empty. There must have been at least 10 vacant booth seats. Oh well, maybe they had a valid reason. Maybe there was a system in place. I let it be. We sat down and the hostess told us our server will be with us in a bit. We waited..and waited..and I started to get antsy. I voiced my discontent to my best friend and she said to wait just a bit longer... So we waited some more.. The server station is directly behind us and there were about 3-4 servers standing around and talking while putting in orders. We looked at them for a short while, hoping they'd get the signal and ask us if we have been helped or not. A few servers walked back and forth to our section... NOT ONE SERVER ever stopped to check on us. After what felt like a good enough amount of waiting time, my best friend asked, ""Do you want to just walk out and go to Uno's across the street?"" I hesitated for a second (thinking maybe we should wait just a bit longer), then my stomach reminded me that it needed to be fed and by this point, I was cranky. So we walked out and never looked back. I could have raised my hand and got their attention, but the fact that NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON even acknowledged us even after we looked around at them is unacceptable. We shouldn't have to be raising our hands for your attention. We even closed our menus to signal them that we are ready to order. Nope, that didn't work either. I just shook my head and left."
Tammy M.,"Toronto, Canada",2,18,4,1.0,7/28/2014,came here with family.. Service was SHIT... Server was SHIT... Food was SHIT.... not cooked... or burned..  Not worth the 50 minute wait. Dont waste your time. This place sucks asshole.  I would pick no stars if i could!!!
Bri A.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",0,18,9,1.0,10/26/2015,Ordered a medium rare steak and received a well done steak didn't take a single bite and the waitress comes back to tell me that I ordered something else like seriously? I can understand you are working hard and probably got my order wrong but instead of apologizing you come to tell me that you were right I was wrong apparently I like my steak the way you tell me?? Terrible service!!  My drink took half hour and I didn't say anything but telling me how I like my steak?
Jessica B.,"Elmont, NY",0,37,17,3.0,8/4/2016,I really used to enjoy this Applebee's being that I grew up in the area but after the renovation and the touch screens service has gone down so bad. I would only recommend going for happy hour drinks and the half price apps before a movie. It's a shame because it was a good go to before.
Denisa R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",894,578,354,4.0,1/2/2013,"What is there to say about Applebee's that hasn't been said before? I mean, if you've been to one you've been to them all. The only things that really change are the location and faces of the restaurant. Now, there are a couple of pros to this particular Applebee's located in Queens. For example: 1. It is conveniently located across the street from the UA Kaufman Regal movie theater. Due to this, if you order an entree you can get discounted movie tickets for less than $10 each. That's a steal if you haven't seen the movie prices lately! 2. They always have amazing deals on appetizers and really good happy hour pricing. 3. The staff has always been nothing but friendly and attentive every time I've gone. From the servers to the bartenders everyone is laid back and looking out for the customer. The only real con for me is some of the dishes offered by Applebee's. Certain items can be a hit while others are a complete miss. That doesn't take away from the fact that you should visit this Applebee's.... like NOW!"
Sabrina C.,"East Bronx, NY",44,14,42,3.0,7/12/2015,"Overall I never really had great experiences at Applebee's but recently it's been better and better. Menu is okay as far as franchise foods. I have become very fond of the appetizers. You can never go wrong with the chicken wings and the new Sriracha Shrimp! Drinks are okay, I usually stick with the bahama mama or grab a beer."
Iris H.,"New York, NY",0,9,1,1.0,8/25/2015,"Absolutely  horrible will never ever go back to this Applebee's again. Went there with my son who has a special diet but can eat at certain restaurants Applebee's be being the first one I've always ordered white rice and a hotdogs for my son when I got there the waiter said the whole kids menu was changed and tried to get me to eat something else.There was another family right next to us who also had a problem with one of their dishes and the manager was called to say the same thing the waiter which was ""our menu had changed and this is how the dishes will always be. Ridiculous! my butt had to get up and go to Unos and thankfully there was something for my son there that he could eat I will forever go to Unos. But the fudge desert is so much better than Unos the lava cake! 5 star on the dessert!"
Dave R.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,13,16,3.0,12/29/2013,I always expect something the food to be better or the menu to be more appealing everytime I go but meh it seems kinda boring to me. The portions are kinda small and expensive.  The meals are honestly not that remarkable. The waiting staff seem friendly enough though. I just honestly think I dont enjoy this chain of restaurants because of the boring food menu. I do enjoy their margaritas though! Hit those up!
Tina H.,"Ridgewood, NY",5,55,10,3.0,5/16/2015,Lately this place is going down the drain. The food is a hit or miss. You never know if it will be fresh or old.
Chevelle W.,"Long Island City, NY",2,19,6,1.0,5/27/2015,I came to this establishment with my mentally  challenged individuals and was treated very poorly. The waitress was rude and served us cold food . Then we didn't see her for 20 minutes. I spoke to the manager he didn't care . If u want hot served food do not go to Applebee's.
Sunnie P.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",0,14,,1.0,12/5/2015,Waited an hour and a half for delivery order. Somebody input pick up order instead on receipt.  It's from online order. How could they get it wrong? So food was freaking cold when it delivered.  No wonder AppleBees going down hill.
Hayleigh S.,"ASTORIA, NY",40,12,,2.0,5/10/2014,"I've been to this location numerous times simply because it's so close to the movie theater, so my fiance and I often eat here first before our movie dates. However, after a couple negative experiences, I think we'll opt for different restaurants from now on. In my experience the waiters and waitresses have always been really friendly, but the majority of times I've been here the service has been incredibly slow. When it's even the slightest bit busy it's difficult to get the attention of a waiter.  Food is consistently meh. We ordered the 2 for 20$ entrees, I got the oriental salad and he got the chicken tenders. My salad was 50% dried noodles with a couple shreds of lettuce underneath and quite literally swimming in salad dressing. His entree looked like they picked out the absolute smallest tenders they could find out of the batch, with a handful of fries. I don't know if smaller portions are just something to be expected with their 2 for 20$ deal but either way neither of us were satisfied. I think it's weird and annoying that you can only get the happy hour drink prices/half off appetizers if you're seated in the bar area. Any other restaurant/bar chain I've been to with similar specials has never made them bar-specific. Had I been able to get the happy hour deal, I would have gotten a couple beers. I opted for water instead. The only thing I can think of is that they don't want groups dining in for happy hour and only ordering a couple half off appetizers and drinks, but surely there are enough people who actually order off the regular menu as well to offset that. I've had better experiences at other Applebee's locations, but I'll probably avoid this one from now on."
Alyssa G.,"New York, NY",2,26,2,1.0,5/2/2015,So the only reason I am even giving this place one star is because our waiter was SUPER nice! His name was Jashim and he was the only one in that place who gave good customer service and made sense. I walk in the first thing I see is the high tables next to the bar covered in a mess from the previous customers. Then we are seated on the left side near the windows where across from our table there were more tables covered in a mess... like really??? GROSS! Who wants to sit at a restaurant paying 115 for a bill and be surrounded by rude people and messy space. Never will I go there again. I was there for happy hour which was around closing hours and thought it would be more like other Applebee locations I have went to before but what a disappointment.
Daniel M.,"Newark, NJ",139,98,160,4.0,8/26/2014,"It's a great location, right next to the theater. They have huge TVs and great beers on tap. It's on pat with their stores of the franchise. The food is great and the service friendly. I can't recall a bad experience I had here. During major sporting events the place gets jam packed but that's true of most bar restaurants."
Debra D.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,4,,5.0,12/23/2014,"Love love love  astoria applebees every manager waitress busperson pleasant wonderful never never have had a bad experince so from now on when i want to take my 92 yr boss to lunch .

Joe K.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",18,10,1,1.0,4/10/2015,Has anyone else noticed the horrible smell emanating from the sewer beneath the restaurant?
Maravillosa G.,"SUNNYSIDE, NY",1,57,2,2.0,8/19/2014,Visited this chain restaurant with my significant other. The waiting was about 40-50 minutes and I only ordered a Thai Shrimp Salad and my significant other a steak with some kind of sauce and vegetable. Way to long of a wait for a couple of simple dishes.  I found the bill to be steep for lettuce and salty beef. Don't think I'll be back
Susan R.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",81,31,54,4.0,6/15/2015,"I had the Oriental Chicken salad with grilled chicken, and it's delish - must try! My daughter had a kids meal (Chicken Mac n Cheese, with a Cesar Side Salad). She's 9 years old, and it was definitely enough. Everything was excellent, as was the service."
Jessica N.,"Long Island City, NY",193,337,248,3.0,5/14/2015,"I will go for apps and drinks ANYTIME at applebees. The entrees themselves I can do without. They have pretty great happy hour specials, half priced apps - $3 beers. Last time I came with my daughter and mother and sat outside which was nice. Our waitress was super attentive but I feel like the other tables (who had other servers) seemed disappointed because they didn't come around. Maybe since they just opened the outside not too long ago they haven't gotten the hang of it. We ordered the Spinach dip, wonton tacos, honey BBQ boneless wings and the pretzels with beer cheese. The best? The wonton tacos. These are my absolute FAVORITE app...almost anywhere. The worst? Pretzels with cheese. The cheese was getting stiff and the pretzels were kinda hard. I do appreciate the fact that I was able to cash in on the happy hour specials, without sitting at the bar. I would hate sitting ten feet away from it, and have to pay full price because I have my child with me. The kids meals are customizable so they can choose two or three things..which my daughter loved."
L. V.,"Forest Hills, NY",117,156,232,1.0,4/6/2014,"This Applebee's sucks.  The food is terrible and If you let  your waiter know, they don't care. Our waiter actually said ""you should have ordered what I suggested"" WTF??? Are you kidding me?  The drinks are extremely blah, don't bother.  I don't know what is up with Applebee's and the food/service but it's disappointing.  Good luck with whatever you order =/"
