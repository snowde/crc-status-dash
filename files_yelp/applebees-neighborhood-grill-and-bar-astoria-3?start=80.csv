Anthony P.,"New York, NY",0,16,5,1.0,2/15/2015,The first time i went it was ok the second i gave them a chance and it was just worst then the first. I ordered the appetizer sampler i received it with my food at the same time and it came fast then the sampler was so cold. The artichoke dip was cold the chicken fajitas the same and the classic wings. I asked to reheat it came back dry as hell. Next i asked for a chicken ceaser salad waiter brings me the wrong salad and i asked her is this ceasar salad she replied yes like what the hell. I called another waiter and he went to the back got me the right salad. All in all i think the service here needs help the food was just bad this night i wont be goin to this location anymore.
Demo K.,"Astoria, NY",76,251,93,1.0,11/18/2014,Don't come. Service and management sucks.  Wifi is almost impossie to connect to and speed is ultra slow!  Manager male bald black guy has zero mangament skills.  If you don't come here you aren't missing. much.
Debbie D.,"Bayside, NY",626,328,63,1.0,11/19/2013,"Hostess was really nice and tried but if something is on your menu, you should honor it. I am staring at the menu saying honey pepper shrimp & chicken is on the 2 for $20 and then you tell me I can't have it. So disappointed to the 100000th degree!!"
Gregg H.,"Orlando, FL",25,70,1,5.0,6/18/2015,"Normally, you cannot get me to walk into an Applebee's. But my sister swore up and down this was a great place and the best happy hour you will ever see. Pretzel sticks and just a bunch of great choices for under $5.00!   We sat at the bar and I don't think we left for like 3 hours.  Very lively entertaining place and all of the food was quite reasonable and excellent.  We stayed a little past happy hour, but we really had such a good time.  Service was exceptional and I can't remember a better time at a bar."
Jessica S.,"Sunnyside, NY",0,15,3,1.0,11/28/2015,"Horrible service. Def not going back here.  We did not wait long to get seated but once we were brought over to sit we were led to a dirty table.   There was a puddle of water on the floor from the bar that all the workers just continued to step over.   Appetizer was ordered as soon as the waitress came over to take our order and it took 30 minutes to come out.  The appetizer was brought out wrong.   Horrible service, rude staff.  Def will not be returning."
Tania C.,"Flushing, NY",210,354,1026,3.0,1/8/2014,Ehhhhh not my favorite place anymore. Great spot to catch a drink and have some mozz sticks. The entrées are ok I guess. Not a fan of the steak. Too rubbery. But the 2 for $20 deal is gd.
Jolena C.,"New York, NY",0,13,,1.0,11/9/2015,"Used to be a favorite place to eat. The last time I went, I had to send the food back 3 times. Each time the brisket came out cold as an ice cube no exaggerations. The waitress was amazing and was helpful as she can be but the food has gone downhill. The chefs need to step up their game"
XiaoHwa N.,"Long Island City, NY",186,167,129,3.0,12/2/2013,"Re:  my Chicago Uno Grill review. STOP JUDING ME, PEOPLE.  Yes, sometimes we eat at Applebee's.  And it's not as good as it used to be.  The whole chain, I mean.  Wasn't there a time that it tasted like they cooked their food?  Now it seems all their food is microwaved in steam pockets. I give this particular Applebee's 3 stars because the service is super nice and friendly.   Ok, so mozzarella sticks are still a hit amongst my family.  But I'm always watching what I eat and everything under 500 calories is a steamed, microwaved mess.  They took away my favorite Italian Grilled chicken portabello mushroom sandwich that came on a whole wheat bun.  It was like 350 calories and tasty.  Oh well. So I guess my advice is don't even bother to eat healthy.  Or eat healthy but suck it up because you're in an Applebee's.   Oh, and why is it so freaking expensive too?  Like $16 an entree expensive?  Why am I giving this place 3 stars again?"
Dermot T.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,3,,1.0,11/2/2015,"Monday night at 7:30 and they make my party of 4 wait 10 mins, when the check in girl had 25 open tables to seat me. Wife ordered frozen drink and machine was broke, I ordered tap beer and they had to change keg. Got a bottle instead and it was warm. Had to wait 10 mins for it too, waitress said bartender was busy.They make you order on a computer and the employees don't know how to use it . Never again. It's shock food, what is so hard."
Melanie S.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,171,8,2.0,5/19/2013,-No utensils given unless we asked. Was I supposed to dunk my face into my appetizer like a dog? -No water given unless asked. I'm sure you won't mind if I get it myself since you're busy watching the basketball game.  -No personality of our server what so ever. Remove the stick from your ass. -No apologies given for any of this crappy service. Good we're even since no tip was given either.  -My tortilla soup looked like puke. Luckily it didn't make me do so. -Never checked up on us to see if we needed anything. Should I throw my wallet at your head to indicate I need the check?  Skip this place and go somewhere else.
Lexi F.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",82,13,,1.0,6/23/2015,"I have never reviewed a place while still sitting in it. This Applebee's has the WORST service ever! I had to wait 15 minutes just to tell a hostess my name and party number, and no one was in front of me. It's not crowded at all. Once she took the information down, I was seated pretty fast. The hostess argued about the booth seat that I wanted, and kept telling me that my party wouldn't fit. I should know if we can fit or not .. Wtf? She then said that if we decided to change later that we would be stuck here. Great service you got there LOL! We fit perfectly btw.. I then proceeded to wait 15 minutes for a server to come to the table and ask for drinks. The party that was seated after us got a server before my table! I had to see a manager and he was the one who took our order. Our food took pretty freakin long.. 45 mins later, no food, no water. Did they forget about us? No.. Here comes the waitress. She was pleasant but did not take our menus away and we had to ask her for refills... This place is  NOT BUSY so I really don't understand. I will not be coming back here. They didn't even take away our appetizer plates before giving us the entree. Terrible ! I expected better service for Astoria .. Wow. The one in Jamaica is WAYYYYYYYYYYYYY better omg."
Max A.,"Tyresö, Sweden",25,8,6,2.0,6/15/2013,"Visited with my family and we were pretty out hungry. Had the hot wings with asian bbq sauce as apetizer and they were good so it all started well.. The entree were realy bad for our party. The burger for one of us were raw and cold in the middle. I had ribs that were fairly OK... Not close to anything ""better"". However, the staff handled us well allthe tie and after I pointed out the undone burger it was delt with by the manager by not needing to pay for anyhing for that person who had the bad burger.  Soo.. Overall food was not special and even ""worse"" in some cases. But the waiters were friendly and did his bestl.... Overall wouldn't recommend this place, there are other places that I would chose anyday over this one...."
a c.,"Bronx, NY",0,41,,1.0,11/3/2015,"my friend had a $25 gift card so we tried this place, she should have sold it. you could tell the fish was from frozen, the fries were cold. her wings were terrible she said it tasted like the meat was old she sent it back and ordered the riblets, got the riblets they were dry and very chewy. the only good meal were the chicken tenders on the kids menu. the service was good but the food was really bad. we told a couple sitting down to cross the street and go to uno's their food is really good, and the prices are similar.  what a waste of a good location. if the food was good we would go there. it was like they were using up the food they had left over before they used the fresher food."
KJ S.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,38,2,5.0,6/23/2014,"I mean.... It's Applebee's so it's not five star dining by any means, HOWEVER.... Demetrius was absolutely amazing. We had a party of six on the patio and I felt like we were his only table because he was so attentive. He made sure our purses and charging phones were secure, gave us feedback throughout the meal if the drinks took a little longer to receive (which was 5 minutes, max) and overall had a fabulous personality. I'm from LA, so unfortunately I won't be able to come back to see him for a bit, but I'm so happy he took care of us. Everyone needs to come in. TAKE CARE OF HIM!!!!! Thank you Demetrius :)"
Kat W.,"New York, NY",20,138,5,5.0,9/25/2013,This was my first time in Astoria/LIC (?) AND Applebees despite growing up in the city. We stopped for some happy hour drinks while enroute to the Museum of Moving Images and happily discovered the best bartender I've had all year! She was amazing. She made us delicious pickleback shots with hot sauce and kept us laughing the whole time we were there. Check her out every Friday and Saturday! Zero input on the food... the rest of the place looked kind of depressing...
Jess C.,"Astoria, NY",15,38,33,4.0,8/3/2013,Stopped in the other night before a movie. Sat at the bar for 1/2 priced apps and beers.  FOOD:  Spinach and Artichoke Dip= Very good. Salsa that comes with it is also very good.  SERVICE:  Bartender was awesome! He was very friendly - personable - I would go back just for the good service. He was also busting ass working his full bar and making drinks for  the servers.
Joyce K.,"Flushing, NY",11,55,4,3.0,11/10/2014,"One Applebee's isn't much different from another. My friends and I occasionally eat here if we're seeing a movie at the Kaufman theater nearby. It's bigger and cleaner than the one in Flushing's skyview center, but that's about the only real diference. It's pretty much what you'd expect from this chain."
Tenzin K.,"Jackson Heights, NY",0,1,,1.0,12/25/2015,The service was terrible the plates were still dirty and the workers showed their anger towards the customer and they were racist and rude
Eric F.,"Flushing, NY",25,16,34,1.0,6/28/2014,This is literally the worst Applebee's around !! Even when it's busy or not you have to wait super long just to order & even longer to receive the food ! I will not recommend anyone to come here & staff is really unorganized & rude like if they don't care about the customers.
Maria S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,,5.0,1/14/2015,Even though this place can get very packed. . Me and my loved one enjoyed this location very much. We go here to eat when we both have time off. The servers are very friendly as well. I look forward to returning here again this weekend. The area isnt the best area but we always drive in here.
