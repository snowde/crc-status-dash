Teresa L.,"Nevada City, CA",0,15,,5.0,12/10/2017,"Most of the time when thou go to a chain restaurant you think of it as just that. I have to say the Auburn location seems a step above and the service is exceptional. I try to never be demanding at a restaurant but I have to admit that yesterday we were a bit needy.  Changed our mind on drink order after already placed,  then server actually came back and suggested something different as similar drink was on special.  Also changed our mind and decided to order dessert, last minute.  They were very busy but still very attentive,  even with our neediness.  Kelsey,  our server was amazing and very pleasant."
Eric H.,"Applegate, CA",20,33,6,2.0,10/6/2017,"Applebee's has been in this location in Auburn for many years.  I have lived near Auburn for even longer.  Sometimes you drive by a place day after day and don't even give it a second thought.  As time passes your forget the reasons that you don't go there.  My wife wanted to pick up dinner on her way home from Grass Valley and we decided to give it another try, it had been at least two years since our last visit. This time I would call in an order and she would pick it up as it was late in the evening, about 8:40.  She told me what she wanted on the phone and I went to my computer to look at the menu.  The web site told me that I could order on-line and get $5.00 off my first on-line order using a code that they provided.  I proceeded to the menu ordering system and placed an order for fish & chips, a burger with a baked potato and an order of nachos. At the end of the ""fill your cart"" portion I entered all of the pertinent personal information, email address, name, etc.  There was a field for the coupon code.  It wouldn't take the code that was advertised on the previous page.  I tried it twice, I decided to complete my order anyway.  I entered all of my credit card information and completed the order.   I included a $5.00 tip as I figured some server was going to have to assemble the order with utensils etc.  It was about 8:45 PM.  The site told me that our order would be ready at 8:58 PM.    My wife arrived there at 9:00 and they told her that it wasn't ready yet.  She waited and waited, she texted me and waited some more.  At about 20 minutes after they finally brought her the food.  They told her that they did not have any potatoes to make baked potatoes, they substituted mashed and gravy instead.  She was already aggravated at this point as she had waited too long.   The gravy was already coating the inside of the bag so they had to re-bag the food and place the gravy container inside another container to prevent spillage. 8 minutes later, she is home with the food.  I was not happy with mashed potatoes.  How does a restaurant run out of potatoes to bake?  Maybe poor management of the ordering process.  It's not like they are items that spoil in a day or two.  The burger was very good, the nachos were so-so. My wife started on her Fish & Chips and they were not even warm.  We surmised that they probably were prepared first and sat while the rest of the order was cooked.  She was extremely disappointed and had to microwave the fish to warm it up. Now it all comes back to me why we drive past that Applebee's as if it doesn't exist!"
Sirrena S.,"Sacramento, CA",360,7,2,1.0,12/31/2017,"Service slow, unable to fill our order and still charged us full price??? Only a half rack .. and sides not what we ordered ... The pay at your table service was down .."
courtney m.,"Auburn, CA",0,16,5,3.0,8/29/2016,"Went for a family dinner last night. The menu has changed a lot since the last time I visited but the food was great!! And very adequately priced. Would come again for the food. The only downfall I see with this place is that it seemed like it's ran by a handful of inexperienced young kids. The service at the front door was super awkward and we weren't greeted. I loved the server we had as we ordered our drinks. But then our new server popped in to take over. While she was pleasant, she was so annoying which is why I won't state her name. Overly salesy, overly rehearsed words, asked my boyfriend if he wants a refill while taking care the table next to us which I thought was unprofessional. I don't want to be included with another parties dining experience. We are all seperate. I'll be back for the food and drinks!"
JEN M.,"Rocklin, CA",119,275,64,4.0,6/28/2016,"Max was our server, he was great! Grilled chicken was juicy and yummy. Thai shrimp salad had good flavor and tasted fresh. They had a few entrees on the lighter side which was nice. You can order from a button on your table or call your server :)"
Roberta H.,"Placerville, CA",49,54,54,5.0,6/18/2016,"Anthony is our fab neighborhood bartender, our drinks are always perfect and he remembers our favorites. This place is perfect for date night and a business lunch!! Great staff and Great Food."
Joanna L.,"Newcastle, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/24/2017,"We got here around 8pm.  We were served quickly and the food was average, which is par for Applebee's.  There is a little device on the table that let's you order/pay/call for the server.  We used it to pay, but I wanted to take my food home so I selected the button to call for the server.  I guess they figured that because we had paid that they didn't need to help us  we sat at the table for 15 minutes with the red light flashing calling for service and we're ignored by our server who served the people beside us then left.  Not only that but we were ignored by the other servers, too.  I won't be coming back.  This place has a poor Yelp score for a reason."
Rana S.,"Sacramento, CA",9,40,2,5.0,5/15/2017,"I came here with my mom and brother because we wanted to try their 2 for $20 promotion. The restaurant is clean and well attended - we were were seated right away because it wasn't too busy. We started with the spinach and artichoke appetizer (which was quite good), I got the Three Cheese Cavatappi, my brother got the Spinach and artichoke Cavatappi and my mom got the half rack and chicken breast grill combo. Mom and brother were happy with their meals but I would say for mine it wasn't very saucy (it was like eating just macaroni), I couldn't tell there were three cheeses and it lacked flavor so I added some black pepper and that made it a bit better. I like spicy foods though and would have loved some hot red pepper (or something!) to give it a zing of flavor. Next time I'll try the ribs....mom's was good! But the food is fine and as expected for a chain like this...our server Jason B really made the night great by being so attentive and taking care of us so well. I would come back to this location for him next time we drive through Auburn, he was so nice! Although come to think of it, all of the servers seemed to be professional and attentive to their customers so maybe they're all worth coming back for!"
Suzi Y.,"Auburn, CA",0,4,,5.0,11/12/2016,"My husband is a veteran and due to surgery he wasn't able to celebrate Veteran's Day at our local Applebee's.  My son-in-law talked to the manager, Juliette who gladly gave him a free meal to deliver to the hospital.  Thank you Applebee's for allowing my husband to enjoy his special day!!"
Malinda T.,"Auburn, CA",38,1,,1.0,12/14/2016,I  have always  loved  Apple Bees  but it has taken a real nose dive lately.  Probably  won't  be  going back. Such a bummer.
Judy A.,"Colfax, CA",3,51,,4.0,4/1/2016,"Had a late lunch today and I have to say Kelsey is a wonderful server and deserves major kudos for her patience, her professionalism, manners and sense of humor. Applebee's is a decent place to meet for lunch, the Wonton Tacos are very good, a lite meal if you wish but we had them as an appetizer. If your in the mood for adult libations try their Perfect Patron Margarita, but be prepared to sit a while if your a light weight like me!  Lol"
Kate S.,"Auburn, CA",15,32,16,5.0,10/5/2015,"Getting my to go order of wonton tacos!! They are really yummy...not a full meal, but fills u up if ur a light eater. They are filled with chicken and cabbage and a kind of spicy oriental sauce. I usually get them every time I come either for an appetizer or a light meal or lunch. Thx Artie!"
Robert P.,"Auburn, CA",0,16,4,1.0,3/23/2017,"So used to love this place but it's def gone downhill. Wife and I just ordered two burgers and when I picked mine up grease just dropped and dropped out of it and left a puddle about 6"" around on my plate. My wife took a bite of hers and all she could taste was the grease on a BBQ burbon burger. We won't be going back. The manager came out and did t charge us for the meal or the meal my daughter had and even though you could tell she felt bad and gave us a free mazzarello stick plate next time we won't be back."
Bryan L.,"Roseville, CA",5,281,,3.0,8/2/2016,"Went here for dinner last night and while it was practically empty when we came in, it took nearly 30 minutes for us to get our food. All we ordered was a salad, some mozzarella sticks, and a small plate of shrimp. The food was good but maybe they were short staffed in the kitchen or something."
Kerrie K.,"San Mateo, CA",1,12,6,5.0,8/20/2016,"Our waitress Cathy was wonderful, explained dish ingredients and the  was good!!! Great lunch, thank you."
Luanna W.,"Vacaville, CA",0,5,,2.0,12/28/2016,"Let me start by saying the food was good when we finally got it It took an hour  We got no menus ,no silverware, no sugar,no salt,appetizers were cold   When we did get silverware it was dirty  Very disappointed usually I really enjoy eating there oh and I never got my dessert ."
Maricela S.,"Auburn, CA",30,10,,1.0,12/14/2016,"This was my Togo place after work sense they close pretty late our waitress very nice lady my daughter would call her Marshmallow unfortunately she was transferred to a different apple bee she was so kind and welcoming we miss her at this apple bees she was so good at her job. One night after a long day from we me and my husband decide to go have dinner there everyone was super nice we ordered and everything, I got my food wonton tacos I was enjoying them as I'm half way through my taco and I start pulling it out of my mouth, I told my husband my hair doesn't easily fall off and you know that. He got one waitress to help me out who sent another waitress who took my food and apologized. She came back with a new plate of tacos and she said "" sometimes it helps to know but it was your hair you may feel less grossed about the situation me and the supervisor took a look at it and it looks like your hair.""  Still bringing me the hair that I put in the plate ,First of all how could you make an accusation against your customer couldn't we be more professional and just take care of the problem period and not make accusations and make your customer uncomfortable. Worst experience. It could have been handled differently."
James B.,"Roseville, CA",42,75,89,3.0,1/31/2016,Alright experience. Nothing special. Had the grilled chicken and rice. Tastes good. Too much seasoning on the chicken tenders though.
Professional T.,"La Mirada, CA",1,11,3,3.0,3/22/2016,"Dinner. Washed up in the restroom. They were clean.  Ordered a Caesar salad, and the bourbon street steak done medium and a dirty martini.  The Caesar salad had fresh cold romaine. The dressing was watery and did not stick to the lettuce. It should have been creamy. The martini was good.  The steak arrived sizzling hot. It was expected to be dripping with butter as it was prepared on a skillet. The temperature was perfect. The seasoning was too salty. It was supposed to be a Cajun seasoning. No heat, but salty. Expected paprika and some red pepper. Never tasted that.  Service was good.  Applebee's is one of those chains that you can find almost anywhere and they will fill you up without regard to health. There are a few items on the menu that have 600 calories. Better off going to an outback or Texas road house for a steak. But for comfort food that is a chain, this place is average. Not horrible but not extravagant."
Nicole J.,"Colfax, CA",5,29,,3.0,9/29/2015,Really frustrates me that drink items on the menu do not have prices. Food is decent. Service is decent.
Kurstin K.,"Auburn, CA",0,4,,3.0,1/2/2015,"Normally I don't like it here but my experience New Years eve was great! My husband and I ordered from the 2 for $20 menu, chicken tenders and fries for both, fireball lemonade, and a shirley temple, andddd it was quite yummy!  The server was great, and we ended up staying later for their New Years ""happy hour""."
Bob J.,"Auburn, CA",9,11,,2.0,5/25/2016,It seems like they are always changing their menu and of course prices. My friend and I went today I ordered a burger and the same for my friend. The buns on the inside were black. We ordered an appetizer not very good received the bill was $45.00 not thinking about going back anytime soon.
Debbie T.,"Auburn, CA",0,9,,1.0,11/25/2015,Awful food. We complained about how bad I was and still had to pay for it and we didn't even eat it. Save your money.
Brooke W.,"Roseville, CA",46,25,2,1.0,5/2/2015,I got FOOD POISONING here yesterday from the grilled chicken. Projectile vomiting all over after feeling like shit all after eating there.  I didn't eat anything other than that all day so I know it was them. I still feel like shit the day after. my body is in shock.  I wouldn't even give them one star
LJ E.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,3,,2.0,10/19/2013,"If you're in the mood to be badgered by a totally unprofessional, ill mannered, aggressive, unpleasant, very sarcastic and completely rude restaurant manager......come here and ask for Teryn.  Great job of making us all feel uncomfortable Teryn!  Don't know where you came from, but wish you'd go back.  We don't treat each other like that here. I STILL have the image of her ranting with her hands on her hips.....""This is my lobby, this is my restaurant!!!""     APPLEBEE'S CORPORATE OFFICE you need to address this!!!  Previous reviews at the Redwood City Applebee's show that she has a history of aggressive behavior and poor customer service skills.   I have given 2 stars, (instead of 1) because luckily there was another very professional and apologetic, manager there that was able to handle Teryn and her erratic/rude behavior. Thank you to that manager for handling things appropriately, and assuring me that what I had just experience was of no fault of my own."
Jackie J.,"Roseville, CA",3,124,6,3.0,1/4/2015,Thought it was good. Little skimpy on portions . Food was cooked well. could have given more fries for a 13.50 plate.  Waitresses were nice . Im not a big Applebee eater. I had a gift card ..  I think its silly that someone said portion sizes were due to voters and medical benifit changes.   Its just a matter of applebees just being cheap as all companys do.   And yes trying to survive as well in a tough market
T S.,"Newcastle, CA",3,151,,4.0,7/25/2015,"Want to commend the servers at this location as our service was excellent!  Very friendly welcome and table service.  We came here on a Saturday night at around 8pm and there was plenty of seating in the restaurant and bar areas.  Our drinks and appetizers came out in a reasonable amount of time, and our entrees followed soon after.  We had the mozarella sticks, popcorn shrimp, the baby back ribs and the peppercorn sirloin with whole grains, and we enjoyed it all.  We'll definitely be back!"
Brett N.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",61,205,20,2.0,4/5/2013,"Lately I've noticed a steep price increase and smaller portions.  The same beer I used to order is now a dollar more, and so is the regular meal I used to order  In addition, the portions are smaller on some things. I'm quite sure they're gearing up for the tax hikes and medical benefits regulations.  (Way to go voters....  :\  ) The same meal I ordered 6 months ago with 2 beers had more food and cost  $4 less with a standard 15% tip. I definitely felt the price bump and will not be going back.  The portion sizing is kind of the last nail in the coffin."
Jo O.,"Winters, CA",0,27,1,5.0,1/26/2016,"Loved everything from walking in the door to the fabulous service from Tennille. Thanks single mom who doesn't get out much. Good food, great service, lovely waitress."
Jennai P.,"Grass Valley, CA",68,25,2,1.0,4/5/2014,"We just returned from a terrible dining experience. My husband and I decided to go to Applebees for dinner. We were seated quickly as it wasn't particularly busy. We got out drinks in a timely manner, but it took the waitress about 15-20 minutes to come take our order. We ordered a bacon burger with fries, the chicken penne sun dried tomato pasta and for an appetizer we ordered the spinach dip. It took about 15 minutes for the spinach dip to arrive. When we got it, it was warm, and the chips were stale. We didn't bother complaining as we were very hungry so we just dealt with it. Unfortunately, we couldn't do the same with out dinner. My chicken penne pasta arrived cold, with cold diced tomatoes on it (no sun dried tomatoes to be seen) and the pasta was so overdone it was like paste. The burger was ok, but the fries looked like they had been reheated already.  I'm not generally a ""send it back"" kind of person, but this was not edible food. Bu the time I finally got the waitress' attention, my husband was nearly finished with his burger. I gave the waitress the food and opted not to order anything else as I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes, nor did I want to sit and eat by myself. The waitress acted like she was doing us a huge favor by taking my meal off of the bill. Mind you, I took 2 bites and gave my husband a bite to make sure it wasn't just me being picky. The table next to us had ordered the same drink, and I am not exaggerating, SIX times and had never received a single one. The place was only half full, and there was only one person sitting at the bar. There is no excuse for this poor of service. They were not short staffed as servers were tripping over each other there were so many. I feel like Applebees should have at least comped us our appetizer as the chips were stale, and I left without dinner. We won't be returning any time soon."
Jacob B.,"Auburn, CA",9,13,7,2.0,6/14/2012,"I have eaten lunch / dinner here at least 5 times.  I'm giving 2 stars because I am not impressed with the food at all.  I know I should have pretty low expectations since it is just Applebee's, but I end up leaving disappointed after every meal there. My wife had the ribs one time, at least we think they were ribs.  She called them ""fibs""...... fake ribs.  They didn't look like real ribs at all, sort of on the level of what I would expect out of a McRib. I have no complaints about the staff or the service level, as it has been descent each visit.  Although one time was a little odd when my wife and I were seated at a table next to some dude who was dining with his Persian cat along side him.  I am a total animal person, especially cats, but it was just a strange experience to be eating in a restaurant while kitty is getting fed dinner bits a few feet away.  I was surprised they allowed that, since a lot of people are allergic to cats.  I was wondering how they might react if I brought in my 110 pound German Shepherd to dine along side me.  ;-)"
Chris J.,"Auburn, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/31/2014,We were very disappointed to see how poorly the servers were treated by their manager Teryn. She is very inappropriate and rude. We could hear her screaming in the kitchen and then witnessed her cuss at her employee. Many of the servers attitudes changed drastically after her rude remarks and comments . I really hope they find a new more professional manager for this applebees because I really enjoy going there and the service is always great.
Paige L.,"Rocklin, CA",0,14,,1.0,6/25/2012,"Hostess staff is always friendly and ready to seat you. The problem is the serving staff and most of all the food.  I go to Applebee's ONLY because a friend likes it there; I will not go again. My last meal was again cold, it took 15-20 minutes to arrive, and that was only after I asked where my meal was. We sat at the bar, bar tender was sooo busy chatting (for a long time with one or more customers) she never asked me if I wanted water as I was coughing. Food quality is bad and service is pityful.  Nope, nada, will NOT EVER go back..."
Karole M.,"Grass Valley, CA",37,51,4,3.0,6/15/2012,"Ok, let me first wrap my head around the fact that I'm actually giving a review of Applebees.  Now I need to remember that this is a chain and not the wonderful Mom and Pop type places I typically frequent. Last, I should focus on the fact that the menu item photos will never look like what you actually get on a plate. So now that I've taken into consideration all of the above, I have to say that the last two times I've visited Applebees have both been at this Applebees in Auburn.  Both times, we were seated quickly by a friendly host/hostess.  Our drink orders were taken immediately and our drinks were brought to us quickly (even though my drink the first time wasn't made correctly). The food was really very good.  My steak was cooked perfectly and the mushrooms were sauteed the way I like.  However, there were way too many greasy onions and my garlic potatoes didn't have any garlic in them.   Honestly, I think the prices for what you get are ridiculously overdone.  An $80 bill for four dinners?... wait... An $80 bill for four Applebees dinners? Not worth it. $40... yes.  Absolutely.  Our server was sweet and attentive so we gave her a 20% tip but I did argue with myself beforehand considering I didn't feel our meals were worth the bill amount."
Paula H.,"San Leandro, CA",97,25,4,1.0,11/15/2013,"We go to Applebee's alot and we were stopping by on our way back home. We usually get out of there for abot $21 or less for 2 people. We get the pretzels, potato twist, boneless wing and 2 drinks. Well as we were ordering and asking question and adding up how much it would be for the same stuff we always get we were sitting about about $40 and we asked why it would be so much and she kept saying I don't have buttons to do the discounted pretzels and potato twist since we didn't want the sauce sides. So we got up and left the bartender was extreme rood to us."
Danell M.,"Auburn, CA",11,46,3,2.0,10/10/2013,"I enjoy going here because of the fun menu and the customer service. The problem is, they are never consistent. Last visit my soup was cold so I just ate my half sandwich. (The waitress pretended not to notice or ask) Prices keep going up but food portions go down. With that said, it's convenient so I will probably go back and hope for one of their better days. Oh and beware!!! That iPad type device charges money...so when they hand it to a child take it and set it aside. We learned the hard way."
Summer T.,"Durham, CA",32,15,,1.0,11/17/2013,"Most Applebee's I've been to were ok. Nothing to brag about, but the appetizers are always tasty. I've been to this location 4 or 5 times. Once or twice we had a great experience. The last two times I've been were pretty awful. Cold food, TERRIBLE service, and a bill for $50???? I will not be returning to this location"
kindra s.,"Auburn, CA",0,9,,1.0,9/3/2013,"Dumb the bartender literally told us that she ""doesnt feel like hearing anyone right now?"" Umm okay. It was strange we decided to go else where.v"
Mike C.,"Rocklin, CA",8,20,,1.0,7/25/2013,"1 star for vegetarians or vegans. If you're vegan, the only thing they offer is a side salad of iceberg lettuce and tomatoes. The server actually wanted to give me a second salad for free since they don't offer anything else for vegans. Just avoid the place if vegetables make up any part of your diet."
david y.,"Rocklin, CA",0,15,,2.0,6/25/2013,"Went for lunch today, disappointing. I have to admit there wasn't anything wrong with the restaurant or our food, it's just that our expectations of the food were evidently too high. My friend ordered the American BLT (regular sandwich) and it was ok for $7. On the other hand, I tried a Lunch Combo. It's supposed to be a half sandwich and small bowl of soup ($8). The chicken tortilla soup was fine. The half sandwich though... that was a total joke. The 'new' Turkey Breast sandwich on my plate was about the width of half my pinky finger (maybe 1.5 inches) and about 5 inches long. It was literally 3 bites (not big ones) and was a total joke. Considering that they've changed the menu and didn't have what either of us went there (bowl of chili, endless soup/salad $6 special) for it was quite disappointing."
