b. l.,"Auburn, CA",0,25,,3.0,3/4/2011,"This is Applebee's.  This is the also-ran among TGI Friday's and Bennigan's.  If you haven't eaten at Applebees, then you should set your expectations low.  It's a kind of sport's bar, greasy food, lower middle age chain.  Once you accept you're going to Applebee's, this place is good. They serve beer for cheap prices in the late evening. They serve beer and food until *MIDNIGHT* (as of early 2011), later than anywhere else in north Auburn and later than anything other than Denny's (on I-80) within a 20 minute drive.  The wait staff and managers are pleasant and don't complain bitterly if you come in after 11pm like in some other joints that have no customers.  If you don't want to watch sports TV, you are out of luck. There are a zillion screens and there's no table where you can avoid looking at one. Their musak cycle is a pretty mid quality rock-to-pop stream, lots of top hits from the 1960s to the 2000s.  Fries and beer until midnight in closed-at-9pm Auburn, those who complain about this place are confused about what else is available. If you think you're going out to a fine dining experience or you don't understand that 20 year old wait staff are new to the profession and will make errors or perhaps you are deciding between eating Applebee's and a better chain, go somewhere else. If you want a beer and fries or maybe a cheap, oily appetizer after 9pm on a weekday in Auburn-area-foothills, this is your only non-Denny's choice. Enjoy it or stay home."
Samuel S.,"Auburn, CA",15,19,4,5.0,10/25/2013,"Got our regular cowboy burger "" excellent "" and Samuel Adams of course I like! Quick service. Portions do seem smaller on the fry side but why be a glutton I am comfortable, and happy! Most people it would end up in the trash.  Kaley was excellent!  Will be back soon.  Now it's time to leave a good tip, and people do not be such tight wads people work hard to serve you."
Kristen S.,"Rocklin, CA",2,46,1,4.0,7/14/2014,"Went in this evening and had dinner. Server was nice, helped explain their table tablet system. Steak was slightly more cooked than requested, but good nonetheless and my shrimp with fries and coleslaw was good. I loved the coleslaw. Will be back, especially for their Veterans eat free day."
T. W.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,426,202,3.0,10/14/2012,I like Appleby's for the price.  This one has a great location with plenty of parking.
Riana H.,"Yuba City, CA",0,11,,2.0,2/17/2014,"Before I get into the negative I would like to talk about the positives. The service was very good. Our server was very nice and asks if we needed anything a couple of times. The other servers also paid close attention to make sure we had everything we needed. Sadly the food did not compare to the service. Well, two out of the four entrees we ordered were burnt. One of the entrees was a chicken dish and the whole bottom of the chicken breast was burnt a similar problem occurred with one of the other entrees sadly the second entree was completely overlooked and somewhat burnt. Even though the service was great the food didn't meet out expectations. If one person doesn't enjoy their food it destroys the whole experience. I won't be returning to this location."
Angela D.,"Grass Valley, CA",36,180,26,3.0,3/17/2012,It's Applebee's  the only thing I ever get here is the oriental chicken salad. It certainly Isn't fine dining. You get what you should expect. Semi fast chain food. I'm alway happy with my salad and it is kid friendly:) I ordered a salad to go last night and was greeted by the friendliest staff I have encountered anywhere in a Long time:)
Jay O.,"Auburn, CA",0,2,,2.0,5/30/2014,The food is terrible these days and the management and staff are even worse. Only reason I think people still go here is because there are so little restaurant choices in auburn. If I were corporate I'd get rid of everyone and completely start over. Their probably no better than their employees though so let's just call it a lost cause.
Mike M.,"Auburn, CA",10,82,14,1.0,1/1/2009,"This is not an exaggeration, I have eaten at thos place at least 10 times ( Not all my choice) and every single time is was terrible and gross. My buddy swears they make the best Rita's, but I will never go back.  HORRIBLE PEWK FOOD."
Brittany M.,"Grass Valley, CA",2,67,,4.0,2/14/2012,"I've eaten at this Applebee's multiple times with my husband and I have to say it really isn't all that bad - at least when we've been there. The service is always consistently decent, the food is consistently what you'd expect from an average Applebee's - not overly greasy, but nothing life changing or amazing - pretty standard, average American cuisine. It's always a bit pricey, but we get the 2 for $20 deal. The appetizers are always very good. We've always left here feeling like we had a decent meal for the price. I will say their alcoholic drinks taste like there's hardly any alcohol at all... but oh well. Overall, it's a good place to go if you don't feel like cooking every now and then. It's always pretty packed and loud, but that's the standard for anywhere you go."
Matt C.,"Placer County, CA",1393,972,81,3.0,1/24/2009,"Recently, in response to national criticism---- Applebee's changed their menu, removing MSG from a significant portion of their entrees and salads. My wife is now able to eat at Applebee's without getting ghastly sick to her stomach, and she is eternally grateful!"
Jennifer W.,"Rocklin, CA",12,13,2,1.0,11/20/2011,"We keep giving crapplebees.. I mean, Applebee's a chance but I think this last visit was the last straw. Every time we go there is a problem, from getting served our dinner before we get our appetizer, to my sons burned cheeseburger.  The last time we were there I ordered a margarita which I am pretty sure had zero alcohol in it, and a half rack of ribs. I substituted a green salad for the cole slaw because their cole slaw is gross.  My ribs were disgusting. They tasted rubbery and old and like they had been sitting out all day and then were warmed up in a microwave.  I took two bites and sent them back and was done. I've never sent food back in my life but there was just no way I was willing to pay 14 bucks for what they served me.  They took the ribs off our tab but still charged me for the salad. I tasted those nasty ribs in my mouth all night! Yuck!  I know that when you pick Applebee's to eat at you shouldn't expect a 5 star meal, but for what they charge the food should at least be edible. We won't be back, we will spend our hard earned money somewhere else."
Amber N.,"Auburn, CA",6,3,,2.0,2/6/2012,The food is ok but the waitress' always mess up my order! ive been there 6 or 7 times and my order is always wrong! not worth going to unless the can get some waitress that know how to give the chef the right order!
Carol D.,"Roseville, CA",2,183,1,2.0,2/22/2011,"There is a place in the restaurant universe for Applebee's - for example, when you have a party of kids and adults of all ages.  Or when you and your companions want different kinds of calories: salads versus pasta, or burgers versus fish. The menu will satisfy everyone.  The service is inconsistent. The atmosphere is chaotic, with loud music and even louder voices. Go if you are hungry!"
Todd D.,"Auburn, CA",1,44,,1.0,4/1/2008,I have to agree with Matt on this one. Absolute worst chain in America. Food is terrible and service is even worse. I swear to god a two year old could cook a better steak than the horrible chefs or whatever you call them. I am not really sure why but I have been here a few times and every time the service pisses me off. I got taken there for my Birthday a few years back with a party of 10 and they forgot my order! Almost everybody was done eating but the time I got my God damn food!!!!!! I could go on and on about this place but I am pretty sure you get the idea.
Angie m.,"Auburn, CA",0,5,,2.0,6/19/2011,"This Applebee's, and probably all of them for that sake, are what I call a fast-food chain. The food is already prepared and microwaved before serving. Absolutely disgusting!! My food had become gritty and tasteless. I would have been more satisfied with a greasy McDonald's cheeseburger. Not to mention the service was a disgrace. The woman who was waiting on us was completely ditzy and had forgotten everything that we had requested at our table. The food we had received was wrong, the food was gummy, and just unappetizing. Lets just say we didn't leave a very good tip. The only positive side of this place was there Blondie Sundae. Very delicious, but then again, I'm a sucker for sweets. Overall, I probably wouldn't come back here again."
Jennifer W.,"Auburn, CA",4,133,,1.0,5/15/2010,"I haven't been to an Applebee's in a while, but have always gone to the ones in Roseville or Sac, but since I recently moved here decided to try them out....big mistake, which is a huge disappointment cause its not exactly like there a ""lot"" of places to eat around here let alone chain restaurants.  We went after 9pm and sat at the bar and the service sucked big time (and they weren't even really busy either).  The girl was nice, but completely unattentive.  EVERY time we needed something, we had to take several attempts to get her attention.  We were almost finished with the apps by the time she gave us napkins and forks.  It took over an hour for what could have been a quick drink and apps.  The drinks were fine, but the apps were not so impressive.  Something has changed in the last couple of years, or this particular location just blows.  The boneless buffelo wings were not covered well with the sauce at all.  I remember pieces of chicken covered in sauce, but these reminded me of the ones you buy at the store and microwave, but instead thrown in the fryer.  We also did the build your own app trio and got the queso, mozzarella sticks and steak quesadilla towers.  The queso was ok, but the chips tasted stale.  The towers were gross!!!  They were cold...wtf?  The mozzarella sticks were the only thing that I remember the same, but it's pretty hard to screw up something that you take from frozen and through in the fryer.  The desert shooters were pretty cool though given that they were only 2 bucks, but all together between three people for just apps and drinks came to $65 (and that was given only the minimum 10% tip for crappy service).  The same group I went with this time I had gone out with to a different location and never spent that much for almost the same amount of food.  I have truly lost my faith in Applebee's.  They use to be great.  WHAT HAPPENED?????"
Lisa F.,"Rocklin, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/29/2011,Very slow to bring food.  Our waitress went on a smoke break with several others.  We actually saw them put on there jackets and walk to the far end of the parking lot to have a there cig.  Incredible!!  No one check on us or told us our food would be right out....nothing ... for at least 15 minutes.  We were given two large gift cards for Xmas.  We won't be using them.
Shannon L.,"Meadow Vista, CA",0,4,,4.0,9/7/2010,Took my husband and Dad to Apple Bees for lunch for Fathers Day. We where told that new owners have taken over the restaurant since we were there last. Thank goodness. New menu and new faces. We sat in the Bar area. The Dads ordered the fish and chips and I order a hamburger made my way with bacon and blue cheese. with fries. Alex was our server and he rock. The food got to us so fast and was delish... The Dads said the fish tasted fresh and was large whole fillets. Light and not grease at all. Unusual for a chain restaurant I think. Large cut fries and cold coleslaw where the sides. My hamber was cooked perfect and had a lots of blue cheese and bacon. No scrimping here. Our sodas where refilled with out asking. I treated my Dad to desert and surprised him with the apple crisp that served with vanilla ice cream. It came out sizzling on a platter. It soooo Good. It was so large we all eat some. We have been back twice now and each time the food was great. My husband I have been back twice. We ordered the same thing each time. (creatures of habit and it was so good) I wish the prices were lower but the food was wroth it!!!
