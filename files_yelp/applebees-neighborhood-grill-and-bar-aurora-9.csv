Angela L.,"Denver, CO",0,12,,4.0,1/5/2018,"Applebee's has went up and down since we have been going. My husband and I have quit going here and there due to different things.  Our most recent experience was my family holiday lunch on 12/30/17 where we had a party of 20+ people.   First, they allowed me to call that morning to give them a heads up of a party that large coming in and had a table pulled together in the back corner for us which was greatly appreciated! Which by the way Texas Roadhouse told us they could not accommodate us in any way, shape, or fashion so we didn't go there. The waiter we had was great, he worked through all of our family madness with presents, and drinks, and weird food orders like a champ. His name was Kuiet (like ""Q""uiet with a K) and he was great! Everyone was happy with their food except my husbands hamburger, but I believe this issue is not necessary Applebee's but something to do with the lack of good ""burgers"" in Colorado? Maybe ""I"" need to read more reviews on here about hamburger places?! I ordered the special they had advertised on TV, which was the sirloin with the special topping, which I did the onions and mushrooms and the loaded potatoes which I did the loaded mashed potatoes, and it lived up to every delicious picture they show on their commercial!! Others raved about the bourbon chicken and shrimp dish which I can't remember if that is the real name of it, but at least 4 people got that, and my uncle got the fish and chips which was awesome because he let us taste it!  And very important the Blue Moon I had was super cold, if any one has had a Blue Moon, what does it have to be to be good...COLD! As for now...I would absolutely recommend this location and would suggest what I had above!"
Denise G.,"Aurora, CO",149,295,269,5.0,12/28/2017,"I feel like Applebee's is the best place for a family that wants a variety of things for dinner.  They have everything from wings to salads and tacos to steak. Pretty much anything that your taste buds desire, they have it. I haven't really had a bad meal at any Applebee's I have been to.  This Aurora location is no exception.  Every time I go, I am in love with what I ordered.  This particular time we sat at the bar and were greeted by Natalie the bartender.  She was great! Ready with suggestions and checking in on our drinks to make sure we didn't run out of cold beer. I went with the quesadilla burger, which I have never ordered before but my boss raves about it all of the time. Natalie said it was a great choice as well. When that thing came out the first thing I thought was man, I am not that hungry. The quesadilla is packed with hamburger meat, lettuce, jack cheese, bacon, tomatoes and dripping in their mexi-ranch.  It was so big! I could only eat half.  I went to take a picture of the burger and the manager, John, came over to check on me.  I think he was worried that something was wrong with the food.  The complete opposite actually.  I loved it. Sorry for confusing John and throwing him off, but I just wanted to get a good picture of the quesadilla burger so I can put it on social media. Love this location and I will continue to come back."
Mike T.,"Denver, CO",0,3,,1.0,10/13/2017,Went in for some late night take out 9pm and got some of the smallest portions and cold food ever. If you go to this location make sure you check your order before leaving. We ordered a shrimp plate only to get home and it only had 4 small shrimp and a tiny portion of rice. Great HAPPY hour for drinks skip the food.
Steven S H C.,"Denver, CO",745,646,1874,4.0,3/2/2017,"haven't been to this location for eons but glad i did.  maybe the day or hours of the day, but it was not crowded and our server was prompt. ended up trying the steak and beans soup which was very meaty and very full filling but also lite to your stomach for late evening meal.  there sweet potato fries were good too.   liked their lil machine on each table that you can use to split the bills evenly or what you actually ate and also calculates tips for you."
Carol J.,"Acton, CA",1,148,8,2.0,4/24/2017,"I asked if the had sparkling water. Server tells me yes so I order one to go along with a salad. (Their salad selections are pathetic) She brings back a plastic cup of soda water...and charges me $2.69 for it! To go service was a bit slow. 3 female employee's standing at the greeter podium talking personal matters. Not good business. Applebee's needs to teach their employee's service. Soda water isn't considered real, BOTTLED sparking water. If they serve it to customers, warn us first and don't charge us for water!"
david c.,"Highlands Ranch, CO",7,23,,5.0,7/14/2017,"Excellent service, everyone from host/hostess to server to cook to management here are very professional and good-hearted folks that deserves recognization in my humble opinion; and special Thank you to you Carrie, You are the game changer and I appreciate the care, Concern and commitment to bring smile for anyone  Enjoying good dining experience at apple bees. I highly Recommend this Apple Bees located on Iliff Ave"
Ellen L.,"Denver, CO",63,645,99,3.0,11/27/2016,"The happy hour is a good value, but margaritas are watered down. It'll appeal to a variety of group taste preferences."
Sue P.,"Aurora, CO",0,39,7,2.0,10/7/2017,"Probably will not go back to this place. Please don't, just don't try the $1 margaritas....they came to us and it literally looked like clear water (not exaggerating)....ewww, so gross tasting too! My husband and I also ordered the 2 for $25 special...his 1/2 rack of ribs were the tiniest ribs we have ever seen (it was truly laughable)! I had to give him some of my food to fill him up! My plate...not much better...my bacon Mac n' Cheese had ONE piece of bacon (not kidding, not exaggerating)! I gave 2 stars because the spinach/artichoke dip was good. Overall though...huge disappointment!"
Eric L.,"Aurora Highlands, Aurora, CO",5,4,,5.0,9/29/2017,Super friendly staff. My father and I go in to grab a bite at least once a week. Food is excellent. Service is very snappy as well. You will not be waiting long for food or drink.
Nader B.,"Aurora, CO",74,10,,5.0,2/24/2017,"Sure, it's Applebee's, but they have yet to disappoint. They have trivia nights in Friday although I only have an it when I have picked up an order. Good service, good food and decent prices. My order has come out perfect each time so I give them the five star rating for consistency on all marks."
Denise R.,"Aurora, CO",650,491,905,2.0,5/20/2016,So lately I've been going to Applebees and just getting takeout I love the fact that you could just drive up and they bring out your food however I guess they change the menu I realized that they changed the menu that is one of the worst things that can happen at a restaurant for me but I ended up getting the salmon anyway it was so dry there was no artichoke sauce and they didn't even put a lemon slice I have to say I was very disappointed
Kimberly M.,"Aurora, CO",29,7,1,2.0,4/10/2016,The service is horrible! We got here and waited 15 minutes for a server to even approach us. When we got up to tell someone who worked here they were polite but when the server came to the table she looked and acted like she wasn't in the mood to serve us. Seriously the only good thing about this place is the Butter Pecan Blondie.
Kellie S.,"Aurora, CO",17,53,1,4.0,11/17/2016,"My husband and I had our first date at this Applebee's location. Our first date ended up lasting a little over 5 hours. The server made no stink about us staying this long and talking. We went back at our one year dating anniversary, and the staff let us pick the table where we had our first date to sit. The service is great. The food is pretty standard, but good too. This is definitely a popular location, so it is a bit noisy, but overall definitely worth a visit."
Robin S.,"Aurora, CO",12,2,,3.0,6/11/2016,"The 3 stars are for the wait staff, not the food! Applebee's new menu is terrible! The meal I ordered was inedible as was the replacement meal I took ""to go"". Even the green beans were a problem as the stems were still on the beans!. Herbs are a wonderful gift unless not properly used. management  needs to convey this problem to the corporation  who manages these restaurants and correct these ASAP. I for one will eat at at Rosie's."
Jese S.,"Aurora, CO",333,467,319,4.0,12/2/2014,I don't often go to Applebee's and I am not really sure why not.  Well that's about to change a little.  Needed a place for a quick lunch on the way to the airport this afternoon so decided what the heck.    We were quickly greeted and seated.   It's been well over a year since I have visited this or any location so everything on the menu had changed.  Decisions decisions.   I went with the pick 2 lunch Tomato Basil soup and 4 cheese mac with Honey Glazed Chicken Tenders.  I was beyond happy with my selections.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  I was actually floored over the Mac and Cheese.  This was certainly not something that was boil noodles and squeeze a sauce over it.  There was roasted jalapeno bits through out the cheese sauce and covered in very large pieces of REAL BACON.     I was in a Mac and Cheese mood and this certainly hit the mark for me today.   Oh yes.. the soup.  This was a nice little cup of creamy Tomato Basil goodness.  Their happy hour starts at 3 so this also fits into my day nicely.   I will reurn!
Cecile L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",65,39,7,1.0,8/9/2016,"Service was exceptional, food was horrible...  Steak was tough, and food bland. Last time I will try eating here..."
Scott S.,"Aurora, CO",0,5,,2.0,2/2/2017,"Service was ok. I've had much better at this location. Kid was fussing so we ordered ""to go"". My wife ordered a salad and kid has mini burgers. All I wanted was buffalo sauce with my shitty tenders and gross fries. Get 5 miles down the highway and have literally 50 packs of catsup and no napkins or utensils and no buffalo or ranch!! And it was on receipt!!! She seemed distracted by another male employee and had zero work ethic to properly bag a ""to go"" order. Still pissed I'm eating chicken fingers with catsup and wife can't eat because of no utensils. I hate to check my bag, I like to believe it's going to be together!! Nope. Another horrible server. Get it together lady. Just horrible. You have ZERO business working in this industry."
Doug W.,"Torrance, CA",46,369,45,4.0,8/13/2014,"Yeah, I know it's a chain, and it's next door to the hotel and we had been on the road from Durango, 7 hours! I opted for the ""Sizzling Double Barrel Whisky Sirloins"" with garlic mashed taters my Mrs. had a side salad (huge, an I helped!) and French Onion soup and considering how fast she wolfed it down it must have been good! My steak was a perfect ""rare"" and the sauteed peppers and onions fantastic! The potatoes were good also. I took 1/2 of my steak with me and ""nuked it"" in the am and ate it with the ""free"" breakfast the hotel offers the next day! Thanks Brittany, your the best!"
Kathy H.,"Aurora, CO",32,7,,5.0,10/30/2015,"After several visits and several bowls of too salty french onion soup, I made a call to that location and spoke with the Manager, Michelle.  She was super nice and interested in resolving the problem.  She also emailed me a gift card for the entire amount of ticket on our most previous visit!!  When we visited again, we were very pleased when ordering our usual bowls of french onion soup.  They were perfect and have been on every visit since.  Clearly, they have changed vendors or something!! Thank you Michelle and Applebee's.  We will continue our patronage!!!"
Lua F.,"Denver, CO",60,133,32,5.0,3/25/2015,"I have always had wonderful service here and the greeter has always seated me in a comfortable spot. Especially if me and my S.O. Were on a date. The waitresses have always been polite and never flirty, but always fun. Great place for casual date nights!"
Andreina E.,"El Cajon, CA",2,6,,1.0,2/11/2016,"This place is terrible. We waited one hour. In that hour we never got our appetizers and our food wasn't even on the way. Not to mention the horrible service, horrible servers and hosts. The dishes were dirty. It was a terrible experience."
Adrienne C.,"Aurora, CO",116,7,,5.0,3/8/2016,I dont normally like going to applebees but could not be happier with my experience. We had the pleasure (and it was our pleasure) to have DJ as our server. Hes by far best server we have had at applebees but also probably ever. He keeps up on your needs and wants and is very informational. Also knows how to sell ; ). I also work in the industry and its so refreshing to see someone treat me the way i treat my guest. Thanks DJ your great def be seeing you soon!
Damion W.,"Aurora, CO",150,351,322,3.0,8/9/2013,"I was here having a couple drinks and grabbing something to eat. The bartender was cool as hell. I asked him about his specialty drink and he made me a couple margaritas that were to reckon with.  My meal was pretty good - it's Applebee's ladies and gentleman. Usually when you go to a chain restaurant the food is pretty consistent. If it isn't, then you need to say something to management.  On a lighter note, I was watching the NCAA tournament and was taking a bite of my meal when the player from Louisville had a compound fracture to his leg on national TV. Needless to say, I lost my appetite immediately."
Biz M.,"Aurora, CO",0,25,6,1.0,3/12/2015,"Came to this particular location with my family and mother in law who is visiting from California. The moment we walked in we were so called greeted by a hostess who offered us seating in the ""bar area""   We declined the offer and  told the hostess we prefer not to be seated in the bar area. The hostess immediately had a attitude for some unknown reason, gave us the worst look, rolled her eyes and didn't say anything to us about finding us a table. Finally after 10 minutes she found us a table.  We didn't have any issues with anything else, but if you decide to come to this specific location, prepare your self for a hostess with attitude. The first thing you want in any restaurant is to feel welcome and greeted with kindness. Not in this case.  The food was great, server was great and enjoyed our meal."
Timothy J.,"Aurora, CO",0,5,,2.0,7/22/2016,I have to say the food was pretty awful. I ordered the butchers meat and potatoes which was as visually unappealing as it was unappetizing. Looked like Fancy Feast tasted like cheap frozen tv diner. My wifes salmon was passable but she thought 15 dollars as a crime for the size and flavor. Her grilled veggies were raw and the so called bed of spinach was a pathetic smear of wet mush. The kitchen was slow to get food out but our server was nice and did a good job taking care of our needs. The server picked up on our displeasure and informed the manager who seemed uncertain in his responsibilities.
Elisa C.,"Aurora, CO",5,39,24,5.0,9/11/2015,"Applebee's would just be Applebee's if it wasn't for the superb level of service received in this location. Looking for a drink and dinner after a long day of work, we wound up here. Service was spectacular from the second we walked through the door. (You know your in a good place when everyone is smiling at you.) Steven was our server and I'm not even joking or exaggerating when I say he is the best server I've ever had. Having been a server myself, I know having just two people sit at your booth at 9:45pm is not the best case scenario. However, Steven was overly attentive and catered to our every need before we even knew we needed it! He was spot on and a rock star even helping out the host and cleaning tables, even when he had an entire section full at a late hour.  Consider my expectations exceeded! Will definitely return back next Friday night and ask for Steven again!!!! I suggest you do the same, fellow yelper!"
Julie R.,"Aurora, CO",41,10,10,1.0,11/15/2015,"They don't know how to cook a steak took three times and still didn't get it right. Should have given me a discount,or taken it off the bill for having to deal with the trouble. They didn't even have the manager come talk to me."
Tres T.,"Aurora, CO",0,8,,1.0,6/9/2016,"This is probably the worst Applebee's I have ever been to when it comes to service (yes I know it's Applebee's). So close to our house but not worth the attitude and terrible service. This was the final straw. We went in and two employees were gossiping. A server walked by and said to them ""are you girls helping anyone?""  They responded ""no"", then can you please seat them? We were seated and not a single person came to our table within Fifteen minutes. This would be unacceptable to me even if they were to be busy."
Sue N.,"Aurora, CO",240,39,10,1.0,7/5/2015,"Going downhill ! I ordered a shot of patron with no salt or lime......got a patron with salt and lime.    Asked for a garden salad with French dressing ....got French fries      Really ? There are many franchises in the same neighborhood and I do not expect much but dammit...get my order right    It is simple , even for a new waitress, I have a suggestion ....if you want a generous tip, take care of your customers requests"
Jose Z.,"Aurora, CO",0,1,,5.0,5/8/2016,I hate going to eat.  This was My best  experience in along time. Great cooks. And manager server was great. Lets see next time  it was mothers day
tiffany a.,"Alhambra, CA",37,60,17,2.0,12/16/2015,"Service is fine, but food is horrible. Ordered the $25 for two that includes an appetizer and 2 entrees. The onion rings were so battered that you didn't get much onion taste, and they were hard. The ribs that I had were dry and overcooked and the Mac and cheese with bacon looked better in the picture than what they served. Avoid this place."
Alisa V.,"Aurora, CO",33,16,2,5.0,5/7/2015,We had a ladies night out last night and Stephan was awesome at seating our table of 10 at 6 pm. Steven was our server and despite the separate checks and requests for discounts of military and senior citizen he was calm and patient. Our meals were fantastic so kudos to the kitchen too. We will be coming back again. Thanks for making our night enjoyable. We had a lot of needed laughs and good conversation. Thank you!
Tony H.,"Aurora, CO",0,6,,4.0,4/17/2015,Steak and shrimp was good. I would recommend this plate to friends and family. I. Give 4 out of 5. I personally recommended this plate to anyone
Matt S.,"Aurora, CO",0,2,,1.0,6/14/2015,"This restaurant was fair for the price. The waiters were nice and helpful. I came with a group and most people liked the food while some were disappointed in the four cheese mac and cheese. Personally I had the chicken tenders platter and was not bad for the price. Overall this restaurant is decent. I would compare it to a slightly less quality TGI Fridays. Jk I redact what I said, this applebees is garbage"
Isebella T.,"Aurora, CO",4,11,1,5.0,11/16/2014,"Tonight we decided to stop and have a wonderful family dinner. Our server was Kimberly F, and she was the most amazing server we had ever, and I mean EVER, HAD!!! She checked on us to make sure everything was going as we wanted.  She even made sure our glasses were always filled, that's a big, big plus for us. I will travel 45 minutes just to see her welcoming smile and receive her wonderful service. The food is great but she is even greater! I will defiantly be back and ask for her. Thank you so much Kimberly F. You surly made our night!"
Brittany W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",67,6,,1.0,12/11/2014,"Ok so the food was OK but what pisses me off is that they refuse to sell alcohol to you if you have a ""vertical ID"". I am from California and there, if you are under 21 when the license is issued, you get a vertical license. I have never had a problem anywhere else... They said it's their policy... How can refusing to serve someone over 21 with a VALID LEGAL form of identification be a policy! Applebee's, you need to change...."
Evan W.,"Los Angeles, CA",962,32,20,5.0,9/27/2014,Great to find a place in Aurora that is open late. Their specials were great especially five dollar cheeseburger sliders and half-price appetizers after 9 PM. Good choice for vampires like me.
Jason A.,"Aurora, CO",3,85,,4.0,3/12/2012,Went tonight for the 2 for 20 deal. They keep changing the menu which is both good and bad. I missed some of the things I used to get but there are new things that looked good too. Always amazing oriental chicken salad. It just takes 30 minutes to eat it.  Also had potato chip and queso app. OMG amazing. I would eat the queso with a spoon. Was not too impressed with the desserts. But oh well i had an app so no dessert for fatty.
Kristopher G.,"Aurora, CO",0,1,,1.0,6/13/2014,"I found a gram of broken plastic in my 4 cheese mac & cheese it was my last bite,  no pun intended lol manager sucks at dealing with situations horrible manager,  great bartender!"
Natasha P.,"Aurora, CO",15,60,90,3.0,5/22/2011,"Food is okay. On Tues, they have trivia and happy hour from 9pm to 11pm is 2 for 1 on most drinks and appetizers."
