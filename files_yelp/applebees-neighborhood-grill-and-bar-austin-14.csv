Wendy K.,"Austin, TX",191,445,349,5.0,8/19/2017,"The waitstaff and manager and food have improved incredibly. The trivia is okay. Really liked the strawberry lemonade quencher. We got our twenty percent off. I really liked the build your own topper. The waitress was wonderful. I loved the steak with the mozzarella topper. The brocolli was good as well and the mashed potato, with butter. Our favorite greeter was here as well. The steak was delicious and I really like when they don't take driver. Thanks Applebee's for getting your mojo back."
Brandy W.,"University Park, IL",0,4,,1.0,10/17/2017,"My husband and I went to this location at 9pm on a Tuesday. We walked in and were greeted by the hostess who asked ""what can I do for you all?""....clearly we needed a table. We were seated and waited for our server. A man, seemingly a manager, walked by us without saying hello after he made eye contact with my husband. We waited a few for about 5 more min before my husband went to the hostess to find out who our server was and also to ask if the guy who walked past us was the manager. We were informed that the guy was the general manager. My husband asked to speak to him. The hostess came to our table to ask if we wanted the manager or the server. We asked for the manager...again. We informed her that he walked by without speaking or acknowledging us and she said ""yea...he's like that sometimes."" He came to the table apologizing saying her thought we had been served already, which is no excuse for not, at minimum, saying hello. He continued to apologize. We decided to leave and HE FOLLOWED US TO OUR CAR!!! What kind of crazy person does that?! He was telling us that he wanted to make it right and take care of us if we decided to come again.  At that point the damage was done. Him following us to our car was insane. We definitely won't be returning to this location.  ***sidenote*** there was another table also looking for their server because they hadn't seen them in a while."
Grant S.,"East Cesar Chavez, TX",96,4,,1.0,7/14/2017,"Avoid this dumpster fire at all costs. Don't ask me why I thought attempting to eat at Applebee's was a good idea.  I say attempting to eat, because we never actually received any service. My fiancée and I came here on Wednesday night and it was moderately busy - maybe half the restaurant was full.  We were seated promptly and told our server would be right with us.  A few minutes later a table is seated next to us, and their waitress comes over instantly to grab their drink order. After ten minutes we begin looking around for someone to take our order - however all the employees appear to be ignoring us.  After another ten minutes of unsuccessfully trying to find our server, we left. On our way out the waitress for the table next to us told us to ""Have a nice day!""  It would seem obvious to me that if a table that has no drinks of any sort, no silverware, and menus still on the table hasn't been greeted yet. At any rate, we went to Plucker's down the street and had a great time with amazing service even though the restaurant was packed and it was trivia night."
Charles L.,"Denver, CO",101,2,2,1.0,12/30/2017,"Place is a train wreck.    Ordered a to go order.  Burger was not cooked correctly.  Clearly says ""no pink"" on the burger.   See the pics below.  I won't be back!!!!"
Stephanie A.,"Austin, TX",44,161,1262,1.0,7/9/2017,"Well, fool me once - your fault; fool me twice - my fault - go back a third time and that makes me an idiot! We went here because it is so close to our home, mistake - again. Every visit there is an issue with the food or service or both.  I have seen management try and deescalate customers who are upset - why did I return? The waitress - she kept looking at us like we had 3 noses and 8 eyes, I think this was her first customer service job.  She was OK, but I wanted to go to the other section where the waiter clearly either liked his job or did a fine acting job. The food we ordered: Brew Pub Pretzels + Beer Cheese Dip:  The cheese was already salty - why add so much more to the top of the cheese?  Not really keen on the idea of suffering from a stroke.  We asked her to take it back, and of course the looks we got.... When she brought it back, it was clear they just ""tried"" to scrape the excess salt mix off the top - well they took half the cheese with it. Salsa Verde Beef Nachos: I asked for extra queso, which I did not get. Another waiter delivered our food and asked if I needed anything else so I mentioned I did not get the extra queso and he offered to bring me a side of it - awesome - until we were getting our check and he still never showed up with the side of queso. The nachos were ok. Clubhouse Grille: Fortunately my husband had no real complaints with this dish - he did enjoy it. Drinks: Dollar margaritas!  So first, when ordering a margarita, usually you are asked with or without salt. No such thing happened so we asked for salt to be sure to get it.  When we got our second round - no salt! The spigots or machine the margarita mix is in clearly has not been cleaned in a very long time, tasted stale. So yes, we learned our lesson - never going back!"
S.J. K.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,47,1,1.0,11/16/2017,"Total crap. I'm sure the food would have sucked, as all the surrounding tables were complaining about botched orders or late and cold food. I can't complain about the food though, as I sat for 30+ minuets and was completely ignored. No water, no order taken. Nothing. Nada. Zero. Zilch. To further ice this shit-cake, as I was walking out, the clueless host only commented, ""that's not good"" when I explained my departure. No apology, nothing, zero, nada. Not even an attempt to remedy this debacle. Now I'm starving and have a huge headache."
Jennifer N.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",31,10,,1.0,10/19/2017,"DON'T EAT HERE!!!! This is our first time here and it will be our last. The service sucks. We waited forever for our appetizer but it did come out hot. The waitress said the wait was due to them running out of steak???? The table in front of us never got their drink refills or the other food they ordered. They then proceeded to charge them for another table food! We also witnessed another table walking out on their check when they couldn't locate their server. We have been sitting here for 40mins. Waiting for our main course. We got it the steak had no seasoning, we  asked for more water it took  10 mins to get a refill. The manager walked by by and asked us ""having a good day?"" Ummm he should be asking how the service and food were but he didn't care. Oh and my husband food had a hair in it. Please don't eat here, it should be shut down for poor service and management!"
Shelbay D.,"Austin, TX",145,12,,1.0,6/12/2017,"Never coming here during a basketball game...ever again. Talk about loud and GHETTO.  It plucks my nerves when we walk in and are seated AFTER five people who walked in before us. The hostess got all mad about it. Cool, whatever.  We've been here 20 minutes and have yet to receive our silverware AND our appetizer that we ordered literally a million years ago.  Our waitress completely sucks. I understand it's 11:00, but baby this is your job and if I'm giving you my money you better work for it. I will never ever ever come back here EVER again.  (Maybe I should have ordered an alcoholic beverage with this bullsh*t.)"
Keed J.,"Elgin, TX",19,64,15,5.0,6/3/2017,"Overall was a decent experience on this visit.  Our food came out with great timing and the portions were pretty spot on.  The fact that kids eat free is what brought us here but weren't disappointed at all.  Our waitress was 10 stars always on top of everything we needed. Only recommendation is that the bathroom doors might need to be worked on cause each time someone used it, the doors slammed pretty hard."
Vannessa N.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,1.0,10/7/2017,"Not the best experience, our waitress took forever to refill us, after she asked if we were ok while all our drinks were empty I had to complain. Food took 45 mins there was only roughly around 15 tables for them to take that long. Manager Vanessa took care of us. Not sure if I would ever comeback or recommend anyone to this location."
Christian W.,"Belmont, CA",60,103,,1.0,8/11/2017,"Why did come here, I hate Applebees... Oh right, it was next to the hotel and the last thing I wanted to do was get in the car again. From the start everything is wrong. Wrong iced tea, wrong burger order for my husband, my chicken is overcooked. Service is horrific and there is no one here! I'm looking out windows that are so disgusting I'm losing my appetite. Get in the car and drive anywhere else, you'll be happy you did."
Jermaine E.,"Pflugerville, TX",56,46,86,2.0,6/19/2016,"I thought tonight was going to be a good night but I was wrong. No line, no wait and not loud inside.  The $1 margaritas...don't do it. I ordered the chicken macaroni dinner but I think I ordered a frozen dinner because my food came out ice cold. My waiter was will to fix it but I don't understand why would you want something like this to be presented to your customers. When asked by manager how my meal was, told him that I was disappointed by the cold meal. He said "" I'm sorry to hear that"" and walked off. No sympathy in that respond.  Thought I would give Applebee's another chance. Guess I was right...(shaking my head). No more...."
Nicki D.,"Round Rock, TX",276,426,1167,3.0,9/30/2016,"Surprised TF outta me w their menu choices, but ultimately I was only there for an appetizer & drink.  The $1 Margaritas special was AWESOME. But the drink SUUUUCKED, LOL. I had ZERO expectations. But it was water w lemon and a dash of bottom shelf tequila. I upgraded to the $6 one, frozen, and it was garbage too.  The mf egg roll paper TACO thing, WAS DELICIOUS!!  Few friends enjoyed their meals, but had suggestions on what would have improved them. But, overall ate everything.  Would I go back? Not likely. Too many options in the area."
Tim S.,"Houston, TX",833,19,10,5.0,5/17/2017,Thanks to Manager Josh for saving the day and swooping in to help his team. The chicken is delicious! Great place to get dinner and watch the game. The kitchen is back on track with the new menu.
Lucero S.,"Austin, TX",24,15,17,5.0,4/24/2017,"This is my first time dining at Applebee's, and I'm already planning on what to order on my next visit lol. My hero and I ordered the new spinach pasta and the combo starter's  dish.  Food was delicious! I love the chef's excellent food presentation. The vivid  green color of the plate matched the tasty and colorful spinach chicken pasta. Service was also great. We're promptly greeted and offered a table. Thank you!"
Gail T.,"Round Rock, TX",23,16,1,1.0,5/2/2017,"Okay, yes, our waitress said it was her first day out of training. Two of 6 of us got our food got our food after waiting about 30 minutes and the other four of us got our food 30 minutes after that. Other folks who came in during our long stay got their food way before we did. I only ate about 1/4 of my food because the rest was inedible. We all had asked for separate checks, and that was probably way too much to ask. All of our checks were scrambled and we had to get the manager to run all new checks for us. After two hours I finally got pay and go home. I will not go back."
John B.,"Austin, TX",36,134,78,2.0,9/23/2016,"We stopped by for a late night/early morning snack.   The food was average, but hit the spot. The music was loud and annoying.  The music was pulsating, techno garbage pulsating from the jukebox.   They were the only real choice in the area at 1230 am.  If there were another option, I would have walked out and gone elsewhere."
Saul J.,"Austin, TX",0,10,11,1.0,4/25/2017,Slooooooow Service. Food not so great.  Pretty empty for a weekend day.  Not the best place to take your in-laws.  Strawberry lemonade was good.
Sophie P.,"Austin, TX",38,8,1,5.0,2/22/2017,"Great customer service, and did you know they are actually open until 2am, the bar turns into Club Apple, serving $1 Ziegenbock on draft, $1 Jell-O shots and half off appetizers!? Now that's what I'd call an investment in a good time!"
Jo N.,"Austin, TX",20,69,18,1.0,4/23/2016,Oh my under staffed....we walked in stood  up front for at least seven minutes and no one came to greet us. Then we were seated and placed drink orders the drinks took at least 10 or 15 minutes. I ordered the sweet potato fries and the shrimp salad. The salad took about 30 minutes I thought they just forgot about it. We were here for over an hour just waiting to get drinks we ordered. The restaurant is very empty so I don't know what took them so long. Don't go if you are in a rush.
Lupe S.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,60,20,1.0,3/10/2017,"Wow. That was really awful service. They are not well staffed or trained to provide great customer service. I felt awful for the bartender because she was trying so hard but looked super lost, and being short doesn't help. Will not be back."
Marty B.,"Round Rock, TX",34,5,,1.0,10/23/2016,"This place will suck your soul out of you.  Came here for my mom's birthday and we should have gone anywhere else. Sat down at 3:45 and didn't get our food until 4:30. We ordered 3 orders of the boneless wings and the French Onion Soup, as well as an appetizer if Sriracha Shrimp and the Artichoke dip. We never received the appetizers.   As for the wings, tool 45 minutes to get 2 of the orders (my brother and sisters).  Mine never came until I asked the manager about my wings, which came out 10 minutes after everyone else.   I would maybe understand if they were busy, but our waitress has 3 tables, and we're the largest (a 6 top).  We had to ask her three times just to get my mom and SIL glasses of water. Ive been to the Applebee's in Round Rock many times and never had service like this. Seriously, spend the extra 10-15 minutes to drive up to Round Rock and to there. You'll get better service and more than likely be out of there before you'll even get your food here.  I honestly wish we had gone somewhere else at this point at this point. Edit: I will say they did comp part of our order, which was nice. I don't know if it was an off day or if it's always that bad there. I'm glad I've gone to Applebee's before at other locations and had a good experience as today would have turned me off from Applebee's for good if it was my first time."
Rubbie S.,"Manor, TX",59,516,2074,4.0,2/1/2016,I received a gift card for my birthday to go here.  We arrived and were seated right away with no problems. The waitress was very attentive. Our food was great. I ordered rib-lets which were awesome with fries and my cousin ordered steak with vegetables and mashed potatoes. He said that choice was delicious. Very nice portions of food. drinks were definitely never ending or shall I say ever flowing the waitress was on point with our refills. We shall be back.
Irum J.,"Dallas, TX",108,124,38,1.0,5/19/2017,"Just experienced a real poor dining experience!!  We walked in and immediately informed the wait staff we were in a time crunch and to bring all food at once and the bill with Togo boxes. We patiently waited a whole hour!!! We kept asking if there was a problem in the kitchen and got bullshit responses like ""kitchen slow"", ""manager in back helping"", etc. I finally told the waitstaff we couldn't wait anymore and we were leaving. We had our appetizers still on the table and in this frenzy the waiter there out our food! Needless to say the manager brought the food out and placed it Togo bags and got us out quick and shaved off half the bill to clean up this mess. Wish the inexperienced waiter would have been more upfront about our food situation rather than holding us hostage. Now we're going to be pulling up to our remote Texas town tomorrow morning! Pissed because we disclosed we had a long drive ahead of us...we've officially written off all Applebee's....they need to do a better job training their servers- oh and the server didn't refill our drinks!!!! We asked for the drinks to be refilled and it never happened!"
Brenda C.,"Abilene, TX",5,56,98,3.0,9/19/2016,"It was late...very late! Just needed a little snack. Service was great. Drinks were good. Appetizers were okay. All in all, just about what I expected."
David L.,"Arlington, TX",51,89,137,1.0,7/14/2015,There is nothing like the consistency of Apple Bee's.  I eat and pay for 40 people a month in Ft. Worth and try to find the same level of service at other locations.  Unfortunately like so many of the locations the lack of service is only as disappointing as the long waits for food.  I keep telling myself to quit trying chains while I travel but I love the Ft. Worth location and was hoping they where AppleBees not an exception. I was wrong and the sorry rotted spinach (picture posted) should help say more than the longest review. Save your money and eat elsewhere.
Tony C.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",99,28,,2.0,9/30/2016,Has to be the worst Applebee's I've ever been in... the table i sat at in bar looked 10 years-old.. think it was clean but not sure...  service was good at least.. if this was my 1st time in an Applebee's i would never come back!!
Rylan M.,"Kissimmee, FL",93,4,,1.0,9/20/2016,"Every time we come to this location there is no host at the front door to seat us. After waiting a while the last time, someone finally came to the door to greet us. She had a great personality and sat us near the kitchen in the middle section of the restaurant. We had good hopes for this visit because of her. We waited at the table for 10 minutes before we just got up and left. Nobody had come to introduce themselves or bring us waters or ask if we had been tended to. We pressed the ""call server"" button on the tablet at the table and a girl made eye contact with us from the kitchen, but continued to talk to her coworkers and never came to us. I understand waiting a minute or two if the restaurant is busy, but when there are only two other small parties at a restaurant this size, 10 minutes is beyond unacceptable."
Dan F.,"Austin, TX",3,5,2,4.0,11/12/2015,"Appelbee's has a very generous Veterans' Day discount which earns huge respect from me. They are part of the same corporation as Chili's and Olive Garden, and as a Navy veteran I eat at one of those places each year usually. I've gotten consistently good service each time and this Appelbee's was no exception. I also appreciate the late hours that they're open (until 2am even on Vets Day) because I tend to eat dinner past 10pm. So I got the late night shift staff, and got outstanding service, which is why I'm writing a review of a chain restaurant that probably doesn't need publicity. My server was a slim, tall blonde woman that I'd guess was around 32-38, but I forgot her name. She was super friendly and cheerful despite the late hour, checked on me diligently, and thanked me for my service as a veteran. I tipped what I guessed (since it was free) was 30%, and afterwards wished I'd tipped even more. I ordered the 7oz sirloin steak medium rare and I was impressed how the cooks grilled that right to perfection, just like I wanted, exactly medium rare. The meat was juicy, flavorful, a bit chewy like it should be at medium rare. It was no Roaring Fork ribeye but for the normal price it would be a very good deal. Veggies and mashed potatoes were savory.  Other commenters have noted that the surrounding neighborhood tends to be low income, but with gentrification advancing in Austin at a frantic pace that won't last. This part of town is getting to be one of the last places a working person can buy a house in. This restaurant targets people pulling off the interstate hence the late hours I assume. The lighting was bright all around the restaurant and I felt safe parking here around midnight. Maybe because I always behave on Vets Day like I'm grateful for a free tasty entree, so I'm respectful to the staff, so I got great service, but then I always try to behave that way (you can't complain about bad service if you were a difficult/rude customer). It's the same everywhere, be a decent customer and you get optimal service. If the servers at this location have to endure a lot of cheap tippers then you'd never know it. Raise your staff's wages if the customers' tips trend low, management. Both my maitre d' and waitress were outstanding, steak was grilled just right. For a chain restaurant at midnight I couldn't expect more. I'd give it five stars but there are numerous other places in town that are my favorite steak houses, and I can't grade it as high as them."
C C.,"Austin, TX",0,14,,1.0,3/4/2017,"The one star is simply because the food was fresh, and flavorful.  When we arrived, there wasnt anyone to seat us.  When the young man came to the host stand, all he said was ""come on y'all.""  There was an average number of patrons for 10:00pm, but a lot of dirty tables.  Plenty of staff, but they didn't seem concerned.  Asked to be seated in the bar, where there were very few people, but a lot of dirty tables.  Music blaring like it was a nightclub and one server that wreaked of marijuana.  If you want a ghetto experience, go to this location."
Corinne M.,"Long Valley, Washington Township, NJ",0,2,,1.0,4/2/2017,The service was horrible me and my boyfriend and his friend got our food late and the fries were cold.
Keasha D.,"Houston, TX",169,57,184,2.0,6/30/2016,"Omg I feel sooo sorry for the waiter and our waitress (T.T), as they are the only staff waiting tables in the building!!!! This is terrible, how can this happen? This place is PACKED!! We waited 20 minutes  along with four different groups of guests. The manager Isreal was also helping them which was great. He did address the guest and was very pleasant. I could tell they were doing their best. T.T. was extremely helpful in, I'm sure, this stressful situation. The door greeter was greeting people, far and in between cleaning tables. THIS PLACE NEEDS IMMEDIATE STAFF!!! HELLLPPP!! Our drinks came fast and we're good. I had the Bahama mama...delicious! My husband and I ordered Bourbon Street Steaks, our food came out piping hot!!"
Chiloquin S.,"Washington, DC",14,100,27,2.0,11/30/2016,"I tried their curbside ordering online feature for lunch today. I ordered the All American Standard burger meal  for 9.99...it has a nice size beef patty, American cheese,  bacon, grilled onions and pickles with a sprcial sauce...sounds good huh? Well that is not what I received...my husband picked up the meal and dropped it off at my workplace. I ate my fries first then opened my box that held my sandwich...the only thing the burger had was a slab of beef with some cheese on it...nothing else. I had to ask a co wirker if she could take ne back to Applebees since my husband already left my workplace to head back to his. I get to Applebees and showed them the burger...they added what was missing from what i could see but when i got back to my office, i noticed they for got the bacon! This Applebees does not even know their own damn menu! I do not recommend them for lunch and Always, Always check your to go order before you leave the restaurant ir check the menu before you leave!"
Dan T.,"Noblesville, IN",25,8,3,1.0,2/2/2017,"So why did I not stay with my original plan and eat at Pappadeaux?  Hey there's Applebee's, quicker, cheaper and usually pretty good.  Not tonight--took 15 minutes to get a glass of wine.  Paul my waiter is definitely not cutout for this business and the MOD is a nitwit!  The steak is flavorful, warm and chewy, broccoli warm and well broccoli--all you have to do is get it to the table hot,right?  My wife and I eat at the Applebee's in our home town probably once a month it's kind of one of our regular spots, but avoid this place like the plaque."
Graham J.,"Gordonville, TX",0,11,1,5.0,2/24/2017,I don't understand the 2 average. Our food and service was excellent. My wife had the shrimp and I had the grilled salmon. The $1 draft beer was great!
Denise M.,"Marble Falls, TX",36,1,,1.0,8/26/2016,Worst service ever! Wait staff acted like it was the first day on the job and manager was clueless! Asked theee times for the checked and hd to chace them down to get my credit card back.
Kasper P.,"Austin, TX",81,1,,1.0,2/15/2016,"!!!WARNING!!! WATCH THE SERVER WHEN YOU HAND YOUR CARD OVER.  Waiter ran my card for the table of 5 next to us' $200 bill. My card is now overdrawn and I have no money to eat or put gas for the next 3 days until the refund is *supposed* to process.   To top it off the manager was told and knew what happened and did not even come over to tell us or apologize!!!  I had to find out the hard way when I left there and went to the ATM.   Then when I called to ask what the hell was going on, I was given nothing but an excuse - no apology whatsoever.  Sure this doesn't happen often, but the reaction to their mistake and the fact I wasn't informed is what gets me."
Rick G.,"Austin, TX",74,47,22,4.0,7/16/2016,Cool place to come and chill. Nice staff. They get really busy so the food can take a while. The drinks were stiff which is def a plus. Could have been 5 stars but they lack flavor to the food
Alberto O.,"Leander, TX",0,1,2,1.0,2/3/2017,Not to say the service is terrible but i did not appreciate the disorganization of the team. We waited 20+ minutes to be seated. All of the servers did not even bother greeting us. Very disappointing
Kat W.,"Austin, TX",5,15,2,1.0,4/23/2016,"Slowest service ever. I write this review while in the restaurant. It is 3 o'clock on a Saturday and it is dead slow in here. It took us 10 minutes of standing in the front to get seated. We were catered to right away, however it took nearly 20 minutes for our drink orders to come. Our server was a gentleman from another location and he was alright. He was nice, friendly, but not attentive. Another person came up to take our orders. No one checked up on us. Our appetizers took 15 minutes to come out, and another 30 for my salad to arrive. Mind you only I was eating at the time, my friends only ordered drinks. I will not be back to this Applebee's due to their slow and unfriendly service."
