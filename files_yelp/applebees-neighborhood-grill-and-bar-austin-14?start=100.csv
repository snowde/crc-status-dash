Gabrielle L.,"Wylie, TX",228,203,47,3.0,8/20/2009,"It's Applebees what else can I say?  Its another version of chili's which is not bad but it's not very original either. They have a wide variety of items on the menu so it's hard to get bored with the selections. I always feel they are a little pricey for what they offer but I have always enjoyed the food I get.  I really like the chicken ""sliders"" and the artichoke spinach dip. Pretty solid food all in all."
David P.,"Austin, TX",0,16,,1.0,4/14/2008,"I can not imagine a more nauseating experience. The food was bland as can be. The decorations were clearly picked by a board room of executives from a wal-mart poster section. My favorite was a painting of a generic baseball player that had a generic, ""Baseball"" written above. They have a poster for Anchor Steam beer but sadly don't even serve it.  There are hundreds of other original, exciting, local places to eat in austin. I can't believe anyone would choose this place. So you asking why I choose it.....I had a gift card."
Joe C.,"Austin, TX",4,11,,3.0,4/26/2008,"Well, it has finally happened. After centuries of failed governments, plagues , and a worldly poor disposition on oral hygiene - a restaurant has finally stepped up and provided food items that will let us forget about our miserable existence even after working the night shift  at the cell phone outlet store. Menu items read like Shakespeare in the Park: Mini Chicken Ranchers Oriental Chicken Rollup   Mini Bacon Cheeseburgers Double Crunch Shrimp Italian Three Cheese Stuffed Red-Hot Rancheroos I compel you to drop whatever it is you are currently doing and treat yourself to a flavor festival were every known cultural cuisine can be simultaneously represented in one masterful dish. Care to guess its name? Love ya Applebees, you are truly a Neighborhood Grill and Bar."
Kristina B.,"Pflugerville, TX",19,12,,4.0,11/14/2013,"Come weekly to pick up to go orders and the staff always provides excellent customer service, the manager is very nice, and the food is always yummy!"
Philipp S.,"Austin, TX",1,27,4,3.0,2/4/2011,Quite nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Burgers are Ok. But it doesn't give you the feeling that you've got to stay much longer.
Manny D.,"Austin, TX",16,57,6,1.0,3/15/2010,"well, where do I start on this one.  My wife and I decided to go out and eat last night, so we went here.  Let me say first, the service was great. Our waitress was wonderful and very attentive to our needs, not to mention very pleasant.  Now we ordered an appetizer of the queso blanco with chips.  That was pretty good, no complaints there.  My wife and I ordered steaks.   Well just to put it plainly, the steaks were really bad. Badly cooked, had absolutely no flavor.  It was supposed to be medium rare, well it was in spots, medium to well in others and burnt on the edges.  Which meant the cooks had it on a grill whose heat was not evenly distributed and failed to keep a good eye on the bland (more than likely previously flash frozen meat)  As my wife said, we spent 47 dollars on a meal that gave us the same satisfaction as a .50 cent bowl of cereal at home.  BLAH!"
Adam B.,"Tacoma, WA",31,11,88,2.0,10/15/2010,Food is okay. Great desert though. Restaurant was a little dirty. Friendly staff.
Charles G.,"Austin, TX",18,87,,2.0,7/13/2010,"Like every other location. Decent food, predictable. Same food in Austin Tx or Austin, Mn."
Suzie M.,"Austin, TX",0,6,,1.0,8/6/2009,My mom went there and ate somthing and got a rash so severe if she hadn't taken medicine her throat would have have swelled up and she would have died. Seriously. No joke. I double swear. But they have ok fajitas.
