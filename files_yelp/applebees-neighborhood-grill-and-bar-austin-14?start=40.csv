Jessica D.,"Warrenville, IL",27,19,,1.0,11/3/2016,"If I could give this zero stars I would. Granted, an Applebee's on its own is not expected to be some sort of fine dining experience, but I don't think capable service is out of the question. We walk in and get sat pretty quickly. Then we wait and wait. Finally a server comes by and grabs our drink order. Then another server proceeds to try to get our drink order again. No big deal, but in the time it took the original server to actually get the drinks, the other server came by and did the same thing again. They were not that busy, maybe 6 tables between 2 servers. We ordered a couple appetizers and when they arrived, it was very clear that the boneless wings had been sitting in the window for awhile. Considering how long it took to get them, we just ate what we had. I ordered a Chicken Fajita Roll-Up which has been a staple in their menu forever. Trust me, I worked at an Applebee's for almost 3 years in the early 2000s, so I know this is true. I get my food and there is an absolutely ridiculous amount of mexi-ranch dressing inside the  wrap. I finally flag down the server and point out that every time I have ordered this before, the sauce was on the side and meant for dipping. She tells me that she has only been there for 2 weeks and she would do something to get it fixed. Fair enough. After another 15 minutes, she come back with another one prepared correctly. She then proceeds to tell me that the cook told her that he knew it was wrong when he made it, but had hoped no one would notice. What?!? Unfortunately, the replacement was pretty obviously quickly thrown together and the tortilla was extremely soggy since they had not put it under the broiler (side note - that is how they did it when I worked there, I cannot vouch for whether or not the preparation has changed since then). I took one bite and decided I was done. We ask the server for the check and she doesn't even question why there is only one bite taken and a napkin thrown on the plate. We pay and get the hell out.  After spending over an hour there, I still left pretty hungry. If that is the kind of service that they are ok with, no wonder locations are closing."
Richard P.,"Austin, TX",0,6,,1.0,1/12/2017,Worst fucking service ever. Did not tip and I always tip. This place is run down with a bunch of racist employees who couldn't give two shits about serving whitey. Buggers and cum.
Dave L.,"Downtown, Austin, TX",0,8,,1.0,6/25/2016,"Appalling experience. Got seated at a booth then moved because stroller blocked aisle (why didn't waitress foresee this and seat us in a suitable spot?). Allergy info not printed on menu so after asking a very confused waitress what didn't contain wheat & gluten, I received about 10 pages of stats about the dishes that contained allergens but it was not clear & there were no images. When I asked, the waitress couldn't decipher the stats and went off to get a manager. The manager never arrived so we left. 30 minutes of our life we can't get back. Thanks Applebee's for wasting our Saturday evening!"
Lindsay Y.,"Austin, TX",0,5,4,1.0,10/20/2016,"No host at the stand so we had to wait til somebody noticed us - that was weird. But the worse thing is that I was still hungry after eating the $11 steak salad.  Our waitress was polite but she totally lied to me about my salad already having dressing on it. There was no dressing. She tried to say ""it's a vinaigrette so you can't see it"" but that salad actually comes w ranch so there's no way. The steak was like tire rubber and it was about 4 bites of meat. There was hardly any corn or beans on the salad. I could make one 10x better at home in seconds. Why is this place still in business?"
Sam G.,"Austin, TX",8,67,8,1.0,10/23/2015,"Oh boy. I worked here, and it deserves the low rating. Let me explain why and how. This is an Applebee's in a particularly ghetto location - about 90% of the people who come here on a regular basis are terrible people and even worse tippers. Combine the two, and you have a waitstaff that is angry about getting treated horribly by demanding customers and hilariously underpaid. It is incredibly disheartening to treat people well and then be tipped a dollar on $40 because they're inherently cheap people. This happens enough, and people start quitting. I've seen waiters have food thrown at them, I've seen waiters have 2 tables on a lunch shift, get stiffed on both, and leave the restaurant owing money due to tip-out requirements. I've also seen waiters literally fight each other in the restaurant, I've seen a gun flashed while working here, and I've seen literal pimps come in with their... Employees. It is a terrible, hostile environment. Eventually, enough people quit that management has a hard time keeping up with hiring, so you have a revolving door of waiters who are semi-trained, not the best crop you can find, and who are equal parts anger and stupidity rolled into one. So you have angry, shitty waiters waiting on angry, shitty people all day. If you are one of the normal people coming in, you'll either get the best service of your life because that waiter is so desperate for normalcy that they treat you like royalty, or you get shitty service that's based on how awful their day has been. Believe me, we can spot a decent customer from a mile away. We can see and smell a bad customer from even farther. The food is your typical Applebee's microwaveable TV dinner. The cooks are trying, but they don't really have a lot of leeway with how they cook things. Sorry, if you expect better, don't go to Applebee's.  The decor is a combination of late 90s and downtrodden urban decay.  The drinks aren't weak because the bartender is stiffing you. The drinks are weak because you ordered a $2 margarita with bottom shelf liquor which is basically watered down rubbing alcohol with food coloring.  If you are a decent person, stay away from here. If you're a thuggin ahole who wants to show off to your hoe but can't afford the tip, don't worry, you'll fit right in."
Jennifer C.,"Austin, TX",36,20,17,3.0,4/11/2015,"Very attentive, until you order and then they disappear to the back.   Food came out pretty fast but it's not very busy in here.  There are six families and we each have our own waiter, .... slow day."
Tom S.,"Austin, TX",40,43,,5.0,3/12/2016,"Wow. Top echelon Austin dining. My Bud Light and dinner were TO DIE FOR. If you don't eat here while in town, you are missing out."
Michael G.,"Modesto, CA",40,3,11,1.0,8/14/2014,The sever was very  rude So I tank her for not doing her job Never came back after she gave or food then when I ask for water she gave a look like I ask here for here to do some thing that is not her job
Jacquelyn C.,"Austin, TX",79,26,1,4.0,2/27/2015,"The food was average, as restaurants on this level usually are-- don't like the new potstickers and they kinda skimped on sauce on my three cheese chicken penne, but I can't complain. This location is actually pretty nice and updated, and the wait staff were super friendly.  Yolanda is SUPER AWESOME! She was super attentive and sweet. Give this girl a raise!"
Arlo P.,"Austin, TX",43,16,1,3.0,9/15/2015,"My family and I love the variety on the menu, and the quality of the food is fine. There definitely is room for improvement for the service. But the real reason I only gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is because TWICE we found a pubic hair in the food! Once in the tortilla soup and the 2nd time on the boneless wing appetizer! I have to wonder if someone in the kitchen is doing this on purpose! I will continue to take away one star for every additional pubic hair we find. SO GROSS!"
N M.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,8,10,1.0,7/19/2016,"I'm sure Applebee's corporation will come shut this place down soon with how horrible the service is .   Been her twice ordered to go. Been ignored twice for 20+ minutes. The QA helps me after getting on his phone, takes my money and never tells me how long it'll be, yet walks away to talk to his buds."
Kristie R.,"Corona, CA",0,7,,1.0,8/26/2016,"The service was horrible. The wrong orders were wrong up. One person or party didn't get his meal. The manager had no table side manner and was not apologetic at all. The waitress was brand-new and just thrown at our table and was not experience whatsoever. Staff was all sitting in the back corner just talking and goofing around. This is the worst Applebee's I have ever been to yet alone worst restaurant customer service I've ever had in my entire life. Restaurant Impossible  definitely needs to stop by at this location. I tried to give it zero stars , but I want to let me post this but that's what I truly believe zero stars."
Faithful J.,"Austin, TX",20,6,1,1.0,8/23/2016,One of the worst places. It gets worse each year. The tables are sticky and peeling. There is only one person working the floor. Must be only one in the kitchen also. Shame use to be such a great place
Haley B.,"Anaheim, CA",523,4,1,4.0,7/20/2016,"This Applebee's is nice with great customer service . I didn't write 5 stars only due to there was only one worker .. Scott did an amazing job multitasking! He did everything he could in his power to make us help us. He Made drinks, took orders and went above and beyond to please us along with assisting other customers he had.. This man is a hard worker and deserves a gold metal from excellent work ethic. Thank you Scott for helping my friends and I for a great experience here! Your truly appreciate and this is coming from a first time customer to this location !!"
Carolina B.,"Austin, TX",48,3,,4.0,2/14/2016,"I came in to eat dinner with my boyfriend it was busy but they still took care of us fast and with great attitude. The manager Christian is a wonderful worker he's always greeting us and everyone from my perspective with a big smile and attitude every time we come, he'll stop and bus a table if needed without thinking twice, constantly ask if everything is fine or if we need anything. Absolutely one of the best managers we've encountered. And not to mention the young lady waitress TT she's very good and always in a good attitude people like them deserve a great tip thanks you guys!! :)"
Zachary R.,"Austin, TX",0,4,,2.0,2/12/2016,"Had the endless soup and salad special and was okay. I'll highly recommend the chicken tortilla and tomato soup. The house salad was better than the Caesar salad. At one point,  I went without a refill for nearly 10 minutes and it wasn't really busy. One server failed to greet me on the way in, but another server was outgoing and personable.  Avoid the french onion soup, nothing but soggy bread with a glob of white, over microwaved cheese. The service here is hit or miss.  My server was nice and polite but could have done a better job. As I write this review my server failed to take my dirty plates and I've already paid and tipped her adequately. Did not ask if I wanted dessert."
Jennifer W.,"San Antonio, TX",2,71,5,1.0,10/28/2015,"If I could give it less than 1 star I would. The waitress seemed half-asleep (it was 7:30pm) and barely came around. The table was sticky  (gross!!). My husband and I were super hungry so we thought we'd just stick it out. The waitress dropped part of my husband's food on his lap (luckily, he didn't get burnt). His food was partially burnt and bland. My food made me incredibly sick. What a waste! This place is awful!!"
Bo L.,"Austin, TX",4,17,12,1.0,1/2/2016,"It was a Sunday night a month or so ago. I stopped by here for a beer and lare might snack. I first ordered a Ceasar salad. The Romaine lettuce was not fresh at all. I mean yellow or black. It was a busy night. Only one bartender was working then and a middle-aged man later came out and helped. He said he was a manager. And I complained  about the salad. He said that I ate it all. Maybe he replied to me in a joking manner but I was offended. Yes I HAD TO EAT because I was hungry but I took out the worst part of salad! The person, if he is really manager on duty that night, should find a different job. He is not the kind of person in service business"
Alexandra C.,"Austin, TX",0,6,,1.0,7/3/2014,"I actually don't care much for this chain of bar/grills and, in all honesty, I haven't been to this particular location but, I'm writing this review for something atrocious they did during the US-Belgium World Cup match: they called a tow truck and started to lift cars. I understand parking lot policy but, they were almost empty and Ojos Locos (next-door) was at full capacity. That's an asinine move regardless of anything! Soccer is supposed to bring people together not this!"
Sara K.,"Dallas, TX",47,3,1,1.0,8/15/2016,This is the worst Applebee's I've ever been too. Applebee's is one of my favorites so when I saw this location was in the parking lot of our hotel I was super stoked. I ordered car side too I sat outside for a really long time before going in and asking abut my order the guy acting like I was some inconvenience he threw everything together said it was all there I left. I should have checked the bag I realize that they left my two year older milk out. The food was terrible. We got two orders of the Mac n cheese with the chicken strips. Both orders lacked seasoning and had no cheese on the macaroni. I ordered my son the kids meal macaroni with chicken and a side of yogurt. The macaroni dish had about a quarter cup of liquid just floating around in the bottom of the bowl. Not sure what it was exactly and the yogurt had a strange texture like it had separated. I would avoid this location.  Would have been better off ordering a twenty dollar frozen meal from the hotel staff.
