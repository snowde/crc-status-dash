Kimberly L.,"Honolulu, HI",92,285,189,5.0,8/13/2014,"Came here for drinks and some appetizers. The food & drinks were good! I forgot what drink I had but it was with Malibu Red + something tropical lmao, the bartender even gave us tips on how to make it at home. Hahaha. :D Bartender was great and friendly.  I saw they had entertainment outside the restaurant one night. It seemed fairly busy that night in the actual restaurant."
Tyler L.,"Austin, TX",2,63,5,1.0,10/24/2015,Cant pour a beer to save their lives. Shorted me 4 ounces of dosxx. Not a cheap beer but a good one and needless to say im not gonna stay after i finish this one.
Laura B.,"Round Rock, TX",12,147,43,1.0,6/18/2014,"My co-worker and I went here for lunch today. The food was so bad, there was not much room for it to worse. I ordered chicken tenders and chicken Caesar salad, my co-worker had tortilla soup and a fajita wrap. The food took an inordinate amount of time to come out, and was so cold that the grease was pooled on top of the chicken tenders and cheese on the wrap was congealed. The chicken tenders were over cooked, hard and dry. The salad was soggy and limp from the dressing, and heavily coated in dressing. The tortilla soup hardly had any broth. The chicken on the salad was dry. The table they sat us at was clearly dirty with food crumbs and hair, yet we still had to point it out and ask for the server to wipe it. I would have walked out, but my co-worker was treating me and I didn't want to make a scene.  I only hope I don't get sick."
Robert M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,13,,1.0,7/9/2016,Got back to the hotel. Food was completely inedible. Cold and gross. Wasted 25.00. Ended up buying another meal.
l m g.,"New Baltimore, MI",0,6,,2.0,6/22/2016,"We have been going to this location for a few years. Liked the changes of food choices and how they cleaned up the place. Went there recently food portion was very small, our child had over fried/baked chicken tenders. They were hard, not edible. Our serve was slow. Not too crowded either. We will be looking for a new place."
John M.,"Austin, TX",346,429,1371,3.0,12/26/2013,"So..We jumped the ""Chain"" fence to give the Chilis counter part a try...Nice menu selection so there is A LOT of combos to come up with...The main reason I was attracted to Applebee's was the commercial for the Pretzel and Beer cheese dip Appetizer...They were good...Nothing special about the Beer cheese dip...seamed like your standard Queso..Wife went with a Ceasar salad and the 4 cheese Mac with Honey Pepper Chicken...Salad was fresh..Mac and cheese was tasty..Chicken was different for my wife..She did like the crunch, whole new flavor for her and it was good with the Mac...I went with the Club House Grill 1/2 and cup of onion soup..Sandwich was tasty...sounds busy on the menu, but it fit well together...As for the soup...It was my first French Onion, so I have nothing to compare it to...So..It was good..The Wee one had the corn dog..She is easy to please...We do come to places like this and Chilis to save money...they do have great value and a lot of combos..That and my granddaughter loves to go to either one..:)"
Jennifer D.,"Aurora, CO",203,9,7,1.0,5/12/2015,"I never review restaurants but this one deserves a horrible review. I called several times to place a to-go order. After 3 attempts, someone finally answered the phone with, ""hello?"" I had to ask if this was Applebee's. She then put me on hold so someone else could take my to-go order. After waiting for 3 minutes, someone picked up the phone and hung up. I never ordered my food and probably did myself a favor by going somewhere else instead."
Amanda W.,"Petaluma, CA",1,26,,1.0,3/2/2015,"Just got up and left this Applebee's. Drinks were made wrong, the service was awful at best. Didn't even wait for the food, since it took 25 minutes to even order. After waiting another 15, we left. The manager wasn't available because he was trying to soothe another displeased table. The place wasn't even that busy, so I'm not sure what was going on, but I won't be back."
Ishimal T.,"Austin, TX",0,6,1,4.0,8/27/2015,Yelp removed my review for no reason after posting it for two days. Let me try to post it again.
Emily D.,"Richmond, TX",0,1,,1.0,8/15/2015,"I ordered online for a car-to-go order to be picked up at 5:37 PM. I got there about five minutes before and walked in around 5:40. When I walked in, I could see several girls in the kitchen cracking up about something but the floors were dirty, and the phone was ringing off the hook. When one of the girls finally finished her conversation, she rushed over to the phone and was rude to the customer. She had no tact and a horrible attitude. Once she finally got to me, I told her my name and she said to wait by the bar and they'd bring my food out. I waited by the bar, and the manager walked out asking if I ordered online. I answered yes, and he frantically searched for my ticket. My food hadn't even been made yet. Finally, he apologizes and let's me know I can take a seat and my food will be out shortly. In this time period, there was salsa spilled on the floor that no one cleaned up, and they laughed at the person who spilled it. You could hear the manager barking orders to the kitchen staff. When they brought my order out, they asked me to check it. I went through it but was missing a burger that I paid for online. The girl told me they could make me another ticket and I could pay for it there if I wanted to. I let her know I had already paid for it but would pay for it again since I just wanted to leave. I took another seat and the manager came over with my card letting me know they wouldn't be charging me for it. While the manager in the situation was incredibly helpful, the rest of the staff seemed more involved in conversation than cleaning, and helping the customers. I can honestly say I will never return to this particular Applebee's and I'm less than impressed, and more disgusted."
Tami F.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,1.0,4/27/2016,This is the worst place you can go to eat. Starting with waiting at the host stand for about 10 minutes and there was only 4 tables in the entire place. Then it took another 10 minutes for us to asked what we want to drink. It wasnt even the server who asked it was the manager. It took another 10 minutes to get a beer served to me. then our food took about 45 minutes to come out and when it did only half the table was served then 10 minutes later the other two plates came out. The food was cold and very disappointing. We asked for the manager and it took him about 20 minutes to show up at our table. He got us our bill. But we waited and waited for our server to show up and take payment. Finally we walked to the bar to cash out. We will NEVER return.
Mindy T.,"Austin, TX",49,32,2,3.0,11/13/2014,"We came in and placed ourselves. The waitress seen us come in but didn't bother to greet us. Anyways the music was too loud for our first choice seating so we chose a different area. The manager came and greeted us and turned the music down for us. (Thanks!) Anyways, a waiter came by, very sweet, took care of us. We've placed our order and didn't take long to come out. The half rack baby back ribs plate was not filling :( . I was hungry after still. But the ribs was excellent! We had room for dessert. Ordered the shooters. We enjoyed 1 out of 3 shooters. (3 cups of different flavored sweets). My overall first time experience at Apple Bee's was okay."
Jackie H.,"Austin, TX",1,2,12,1.0,4/5/2015,"Worst experience every single time I go. It's near my house so every so often I decide to give it a go now, maybe it will be better and I could not be more WRONG!!!! Staff doesn't care at all and it's clear, they have never gotten my to go order right once (and give me attitude when I ask them to fix it). Last time I went it took 40 minutes for my mozzarella sticks to come out. No discount for the wait (and no they were cold and gross I threw them out and paid for nothing essentially). Do Not Go here, Especially This Location! Stay away. Bummer too I liked their menu a lot."
Gardenia B.,"Woodlake/ Briar Meadow, TX",3,5,,3.0,11/13/2014,"Service was very nice, but the food was awful. I've been before and didn't like, but tried again because close to hotel I'm staying at.  Will not try it a third time for sure."
Ryan G.,"Meadowbrook/Allendale, Houston, TX",0,1,1,1.0,3/8/2015,"Horrible service. There were open booths yet they still made us wait for 20 min. We had to ask for our drink orders since they took to long. Took about an hour for our food. Only two employees were actually doing their job. The rest weren't doing anything but conversing amongst each other. One employee wasn't even dressed professionally, a tank and black pants are not professional and highly unpleasant when they got tattoos all up and down their arm. Management needs to be changed.  Don't go there unless you got time to burn because believe me they take their time. And not in the good way."
Ray C.,"Seattle, WA",0,78,,5.0,2/7/2016,"Have yet to not be happy with a meal here. Went on February 5th, and ordered a bacon burger with fries and it was cooked to perfection. Waitress had a nice smile ."
Rajkumar C.,"Austin, TX",15,1,,1.0,1/7/2015,Time to close restarent if there keep that kind off waiters I wait 1 hour 31st night nobody give response restarent not busy at all only 5 tables sorry for the owner
Nikki S.,"Austin, TX",62,22,,2.0,3/21/2013,"This applebee's I will not be returning to. Our original waitress was rude, and took forever to wait on us. She didn't know what she was doing either. I asked about skittles shots, and she said they never had them? which was odd because I was at a applebees the weekend before and had one. Unless they carry different things? Anywho, we were there well over an hour because we had to continue to wave down another waiter to help us. She didn't even apologize for her disappearing on us...the gentleman that was helping said they were busy, ummm I have eyes and they weren't busy at all. Not busy enough to interfere with one of your tables at least. Food was good though no complaints there!"
Shelly L.,"Austin, TX",2,67,28,4.0,7/19/2015,We Showed up around 11:30pm and honestly it seemed somewhat ghetto upon entering. Not the restaurant itself but the patrons I suppose. That's fine. So this man is seating is next to the bar and I asked if we could sit farther away from the bar because the loud rap music was not something I want to have blasting in my ear while I'm having dinner. He makes some snide comment which I can't remember now and moves us to a booth across the restaurant. Peaceful. Things got WAY better after that. Our server Shellie was incredibly sweet and attentive. She deserves a raise. Now the food. Yum! We started off with the sriracha shrimp. Pretty damn good. Then we got hot boneless buffalo wings which were spot on as well. My boyfriend ordered some meal that consisted of sweet chicken strips over Mac and cheese with bacon bits. It was a little strange but still tasty. I ordered a fiesta chicken or Santa Fe chicken I don't remember but it was hella good! The cooks were definitely on point. I'll be back again soon.
Nikki B.,"Austin, TX",6,30,1,2.0,8/15/2012,"I wish I had given them more than 2 stars but I really have experienced better than Applebees!!  Also, this review is not based on just a couple of experiences...unfortunately I am stupid enough to give this place more than a couple of trys... First, The service is slow (turtle slow!!) I asked the waitress to give me a couple of minutes to decide and she came back after 20 minutes after I waved my hand. I literally regretted not to order when she was there for the first time!!!....Then another 20 minutes to get the food. I ordered Hot Wings (an appetizer) and Sirloin steak!!...Wings were not HOT (as in temperature)!!...Sirloin wasnt well done and I had to send the steak back to get it well done:( when It came back, It was VERY VERY well done and I couldnt even chew it...Only thing I liked was celery with ranch and wont go there again just for that..."
