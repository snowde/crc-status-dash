Sophia D.,"Austin, TX",2,11,9,1.0,9/7/2014,"This is the worst Applebee's in Austin...by far. Each time we have been here - even when we are just ordering to go - has been full of mistakes and bullshit. We went here last weekend and witnessed a very uncomfortable and unprofessional fight between the manager and two of the cooks. It was awkward and just unpleasant. One of the ""cooks"" (I'm almost positive that all this food is just heated up in the microwave) left the wrapper that they use to heat the rice in our food. Before that, I was already not feeling great about our food but after that we decided that we won't be back. Thanks for nothing, Applebee's."
Alan S.,"Austin, TX",48,80,,1.0,9/26/2013,"Another midprice restaurant with problems. Ordered a weight watchers dish, came out wrong, missing a parmesan sauce. Sent back. Untrained cook took sauce from a Jalepno shrimp dinner, added to the plate. I am allergic to cilantro - has cilantro, took benedryl right away. Called manager, she said oh no this is parsely. If the dish had been made right, it would have been parsley!. Left, never again."
Alin R.,"Pflugerville, TX",182,15,,1.0,1/19/2014,"First time I went the service was good. Took our orders and had our food quickly, it was lunch time too! Second time I went it was horrible. It was Saturday around 845. Walked in and it took the hosts about 5 minutes to even acknowledge that we were there. There was a family of 5 and a couple ahead of us. Since we were all awkwardly standing there I asked the couple how long they'd been waiting and they said they had walked in only a couple if minutes before we did. The host came up and unplugged a phone and still didn't acknowledge us or the other couple. She sat down the family of five and we decided to sit down.  She then returned and said it would take 10 minutes to sit us and the other couple down. We said it was okay but the other couple left and a few minutes later she sat us down. Our server came over 5 minutes after we sat down and took our drinks. We weren't ready so she gave us a few to order. We finally ordered and noticed that it wasn't all that busy so we thought we would be served pretty quick. We were wrong. 20 minutes passed and we didn't even have our appetizer. The server came after 25 minutes and said she was going to check what was going on with our order. I figured since she had walked by us a few times already that she would have asked 15 minutes after. So after a 30 minute wait we decided to walk out. I was really disappointed because I had a good experience the previous time."
Fregilia L.,"Houston, TX",200,385,91,3.0,12/5/2013,"We were in Austin for the Formula 1 race which was the same time as a big UT game going on in the city. So every restaurant we stopped at was super packed and we ended up at Applebee's. Our server was pretty good and attentive. I was not impressed with my meal at all but the drinks were good and so was my dessert. My friend enjoyed his meal mine lacked flavor. This could be because I ordered a dish that was one of those ""low calorie healthy"" dishes. I should have paid more attention to the menu."
Rob R.,"Austin, TX",0,11,3,1.0,4/8/2014,Waited for 10+ minutes to be greeted by waitstaff after being seated. No one arrived so we got up and left. Hostess cheerfully thanked us for coming no realizing she Had just seated us 10 min before. I mentioned no one served us and she said thank you.
Jon P.,"Austin, TX",9,10,,1.0,5/27/2013,"Applebees, America's worst restaurant. Over the past year I have eaten at Applebees on 5 occasions and had one good experience. I thought for sure it was just the location, but now just a firm believer it is Applebees in general. This is a novel, but could go down as one of my worst restaurant experiences ever.  My friend and I get sat and our server is wonderful to begin with and provides exceptional service. The restaurant is dead with one big table of 15 or so people and one other table in the whole restaurant.  Our waitress brings out our steaks and disappears and I mean disappears, no where to be found. Anyhow, we aren't at a fancy steakhouse, so obviously she isn't trained to say ""can you cut in the center of that steak and maked sure it is cooked as you ordered.""    I ordered medium rare and she ordered medium. Well, her steak is rare and her mashed potatoes are cold. We wait for five minutes for our waitress and she is nowhere to be found. Matter of fact, not a soul around until I go to the bar and the bartender comes over to the other side of the restaurant and helps us out. Asked how she ordered her steak and said ""wow, that is RARE, far from medium, we will get you a new plate out shortly"".  Ten minutes go by and a steak is brought out with two helpings of potatoes. Well, the steak is about 1/3 the size of the steak she had ordered and there were blood droppings all over the plate. It looked disgusting, then the steak had A-1 on it and she didn't order A-1.  We ask for the manager and he says ""can I get you a new steak"" disgusted, my lady friend says ""no, I lost my appetite with this experience."" Manager says how can I make this right. I inform him we had a free meal here because our last experience was so miserable and would like to use it for this meal as we won't be back."".  15 minutes go by and our waitress who hasn't been seen since she dropped off the original steaks is still MIA. I ask the manager ""Can we get our tab so we can go as it has been 15 minutes since we asked for our tab.""   He brings back the tab and took $8 off of it and said 'have a nice day"". I asked him flat out, excuse me, has our waitress been phased as she started out so amazing but we have not seen her once since she dropped off our food."" He says ""I don't know."" and walks off.  1. You are the manager of a restaurant and you don't know where she is?  2. Make something up, give me something, just don't walk away.  Sorry if this seems petty, but it was so gross. Wish I could articulate in words how gross her plate looked with a quarter size steak, blood droppings on the plate and A-1 on the steak when she never put A-1 on it. Batting 200 as a restaurant is not the way to run an operation. Save your money, time and experience dining someplace else as Applebees SUCKS."
Voodoo D.,"Austin, TX",119,29,1,2.0,10/9/2008,"Who? Who will fill the gaping maw that Bennigan's left in the happy-good-times-casual-dining hierarchy inside your heart? Applebee's, that's who. Sure, you could pepper in some fun at Chili's but America's chain has taken on a flair for the exotic. And by exotic I mean ""embracing of other lifestyles."" And by ""embracing of other lifestyles"" I mean Turkish Bathhouse.  I don't know what these deviants are insinuating with ""brown sugar habanero rub"" but I do hope Astroglide is a la carte cause you're about to get fisted. Anygay. We could move on to the Olive Garden since most people would trade sexual favors for unlimited breadsticks. But Olive Garden is for ""most"" people who pitch a tent every time they sniff fancy, foreign food. People who hate our freedom.  No, you crave consistency. Stability. Menus with large text and helpful pictures you can point to when you're not feeling verbose. It's a scary world out there and that's precisely why you're going to Applebee's.  Why sit in front of the big screen eating microwaved TV dinners at home when you can do it here? At Applebees. Your friendly, neighborhood incestuous union of Tyler Florence and IHOP. (This is the restaurant's parent company. Or we could say Applebee's ""Leather Daddy."") Have a seat. Here comes a server with your menu. Relax with one of their signature, market-tested, top-shelf apple mocha swirl douch-tinis. The crispy mediocre-balls are on their way with a side of ""I could have done better."" Mmmm..Smells like failure. All the comforts of home! Everything is going according to plan. But wait. You say you want an Applebee's dream sequence set to the tune of ""When the doves cry?"" Performed in bored monotone by a single Mother in a stained apron? Consider that itch scratched. Hit it Angie! Dig , if you will, the picture.. of previously-frozen fried chicken strips reconstituted orange glaze covers me deep throat, my darling  fake salsa and stale chips.."
Tyler S.,"Austin, TX",39,11,,2.0,9/4/2013,"Have been here a few times over the last couple of months and have noticed a few major trends.  1. The food is always good and usually comes out as ordered.  2. This has to be be one of the worst places when it comes to getting your food in a timely manner. They always have the same excuse of ""it is crazy in the kitchen today"".  - Overall, it is Applebee's, it can be a fun family experience or can be a long drawn out   below food experience.  They used to have a fantastic pick two lunch deal, but since that has changed, I am not sure when we will be going back."
Tani B.,"Austin, TX",34,65,1,4.0,10/20/2010,"I can usually take it or leave it when it comes to Applebee's.  I do love their Perfect Margaritas, but I didn't order that this time.  The Tequila Lime Chicken has been very hit or miss (mostly miss!) the last several times I've gotten it, so I don't order it any more. We went for dinner on Sunday evening, and none of the four of us were in a particularly good mood.  That might have influenced our server - service was particularly lackluster on this evening.  We had to ask for my water to be brought to the table many minutes after everybody else got their drinks and the food order had been taken. But the salad I had.  Wow, it was GOOD!  I ordered the spinach salad with grilled shrimp, bacon bits and hot bacon dressing.  Now perhaps I'm just not ready to admit that bacon makes everything better, but damn, that was one delicious salad!  I think I've found a new favorite! I'm still ticked that Applebee's took the fried pickles off the menu, but between this salad and those Perfect Margaritas, I think I can find room to forgive them that particular indiscretion.  Four stars ALL for the BACON!"
El b.,"Austin, TX",10,131,98,5.0,6/17/2010,"I frequent this place at least once a week because...well... I heart it!!! Someone else posted the perfect description for this place its basically a local Cheers.  All the servers and hostess are awesome and make you feel just like family.  If you go on a Friday night sometimes you can catch live music...and JELLO SHOTS.   Any place that allows me  to enjoy Ribs and slurp down JELLO SHOTS is right up my alley!! ( I guess this says alot about my character, and yes I am one CLASSY LADY!!) Even though its got a bar atmosphere going on, you can still sneak into a booth and have a good evening.  I highly recommend their Chicken Wonton Tacos...Outstanding."
clayton m.,"Round Rock, TX",112,40,5,4.0,7/11/2011,"Had lunch here a few times now. Cowboy Burger AMAZING! Also, salads and ribs are really good too.  Lunch food specials and drink specials make it affordable.. Service is incredibly fast and takeout is as well. Love this Applebees."
Bo T.,"Austin, TX",34,18,,4.0,4/19/2010,"I hesitate to write this review, I don't want too many people finding out about this place. If only I could keep it a secret so it doesn't get too crowded. But I would be doing you, the public, a disservice to not share this with the world. So there is this little divebar in my neighborhood called ""Applebee's."" It is like most neighborhood bars but not only does it have Coor's and Bud Light on draft they have an incredible full menu! The walls are covered in funky memorabilia (it is SO AUSTIN). This place is like Cheer's for me. I walk in the door and everyone is like ""Yo Bo!"" and I take my barstool and without having to ask they bring me my usual plate of ribblet dippers and a frosty mug of the good stuff.  Oh well cat's out of the bag! If you are lucky enough to live in the neighborhood (don't drink and drive) then I'll see y'all at MY bar soon."
Staci Kae A.,"Arlington, TN",282,339,264,1.0,6/10/2010,"Gross. Frozen. The steak had fake ""grill"" marks on it. Not only did we not finish our onion rings or meal, we didn't take a to go box! Chili's is way better a mile down the street!"
Tony H.,"Austin, TX",81,269,53,4.0,10/19/2012,"I'm a little surprised by the pultry reviews of this place.  I've only been once with a couple of other friends.  Ironically they stuck us with the gay server.... I wonder if they were judging us, lol.  The server was friendly and the food was good.  I didn't order a meal but did have some of the appitizers but everyone else seemed to enjoy their stuff.  They also had some good drink specials.  We went over ACL weekend, and it was pretty packed around midnight time frame."
M F.,"Pflugerville, TX",1,82,41,1.0,12/26/2013,"FIRST time and our LAST!!  Came here last night with my Girlfriend so we could celebrate Christmas.  We sat at the bar and please take into consideration we were prepared for a little chaos but not THIS much!  The bartender, Matt was the most unapproachable and rude bartender I have ever encountered!  He does NOT greet you, does not look around the bar to see who comes and goes and makes it clear that he is irritated with any little thing you need.  I had to get up and get patrons silverware from the hostess counter twice.  We had to get our own menus from a different table as well.  As a bartender myself, you have to be able to look around and Be observant of what's actually going on at your bar.  Get your eyes off of the sinks hun.  Our salad, baked potato, and salmon plate came out right under an hour.  Def check out our picture of this ridiculous salmon plate that had clearly been sitting on the food counter for quite some time!  By the time it got to us it was cold, and looked like Santa sat on it.  The guests next to us was even glad we sent it back because they said it looked disgusting and was clearly NOT an entree worth $14 and looked nothing like the mouth watering picture in the menu.  This place was a joke.  There was no personality at all!!  Matt literally rolled his eyes when we asked if we could order dessert.  Um... I saw that.  He was also incredibly rude when I asked what came on the potato... ""well it's your usual loaded potato.""  ""okay well everything except chives then.""  ""Well it doesn't have chives so.""  ""Well that's why I asked.""  ...Are you kidding me??  Thanks Matt, I'll definitely tell everyone I know to avoid this place because you were a total jerk even in front of the other guests.  TERRIBLE SERVICE!  Let's just say the $30 Christmas tip turned into the usual $4 for you because we were treated like trash.  Ho ho ho!!"
Susie G.,"Austin, TX",444,795,11,3.0,11/30/2006,"I have one thing to say about Applebee's. Most of Applebees is just like any other chain restaurant.... ( although they do make some seriously good margarita's here.) However, for all you dieters out there, one restaurant has recognized this and actually made an effort to cater to your diet needs. No more wilted lettuce while everyone else is having steak! Applebee's has partnered with Weight Watchers to bring several actually decent meals to the table, all with relatively low points values. And for once a restaurant is up front with the amount of fat/calories/points these foods contain.  From chicken sandwich's,  onion soup and steak and shrimp skewers, these are not your grandma's diet creations. Although nothing can really make up for the fact that you wont be enjoying some deep fried goodness with the rest of your friends, these options will make your tummy, and waistline, pretty dang happy."
Lamont S.,"Austin, TX",7,3,,3.0,1/17/2013,"Sitting in the bar area is comfortable, especially with the presence of Iuliana;  bartender. I pass one two other Applebees, Just to come eat , socialize, and work at this location."
Marq R.,"Austin, TX",82,1,,1.0,1/27/2012,"I will never eat here again! Most of the staff is very immature and unprofessional! The manager seems cool, but the employees are only as good as the leadership, right! This by far is the worst Applebee's in Texas! I was treated very badly at this place last night!"
judy b.,"Austin, TX",2,6,,2.0,3/8/2010,"Had never been to Applebee's before as generally speaking I prefer locally owned restaurants to chains.  But I was meeting a friend and she suggested it.  So off we went. I was pleasantly surprised by my Cajun Lime Tilapia.  It was tasty, and the accompanying broccoli was cooked just right.  I tried an new beer, Blue Moon, that was nice. Sadly, my friend ordered medium-rare steak and portobello.  It came without a hint of red or pink.  It got sent back, which means that we ate separately.  The new one came and it was just barely acceptable. Oh, well."
Steven C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,4,,4.0,4/13/2014,"Visiting from Los Angeles.  Never been to Applebee's before and wanted to see what it was like.  2 mains and app for $20.  What do these people expect?  Fine dining?  For what they are, I thought were friendly and good.  Salty, and too much butter, but again, do you come here thinking its going to be Wolfgang puck?  4 stars... why not!!"
