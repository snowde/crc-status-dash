Paul H.,"Clarendon, Australia",1,106,17,5.0,1/3/2018,Outstanding.  $12.99 unlimited ribs or chicken tenders.  The ribs are tender and tasty.  Took 25 minutes to get a seat but after that the service was excellent.  Desserts under $3 were a hit as well.
Tracy W.,"San Francisco, CA",213,148,258,5.0,12/16/2017,"This is a typical Applebee's here in bako.  It is clean and the service is great. No to very short wait even on busy nights whether it be at the bar grabbing drinks or eating food, sit down with friends, or food to go.  They have the gaming console on each table which makes dinner and waiting for food go by so fast and a lot of fun. From trivia to poker to board games you can play with others at your table or throughout the restaurant. you can also pay and tip right on screen so no waiting for the check.  The service is great and the drinks are tasty and strong. The food is hot and prepared exactly how you like it. I have been here several times and am never disappointed. Good spot to go before or after a movie."
Sherri S.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,14,3,1.0,7/28/2017,"My husband and I went in to eat, no one to greet us at the front, two employees talking with zero acknowledgement of us waiting to be seated... Another employee finally seated us, told us our server would be right with us... After waiting about 10-15 minutes with no server, nothing at all, we left... As we were leaving, the two, now three employees were still talking amongst themselves as they watched us leave... As a note...this just happened... In conclusion, we will not be back..."
Amanda M.,"Bakersfield, CA",416,163,53,5.0,11/29/2017,"Kristen and the manager Daymond are amazing ! Honestly, the best service ever ! Food was great, but really, I will return just for the service !"
Greg W.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,3,,3.0,1/9/2018,"Not doing too good tonight. Ran out of Onion soup, drinks were not made correctly and waitress seems to be in over her head."
Natalie B.,"Bakersfield, CA",22,18,1,1.0,12/26/2017,"Save the hostess/Manager (apologies for not knowing His name---the very nice African American man who seated us and took my name down on the wait list) He came back to check on us more that our server, very disgusted when Jack in the box has better service than Applebee's!!!! I can only imagine why you don't take reservations. Not the best service in the neighborhood!"
Steve K.,"Bakersfield, CA",102,68,21,3.0,9/17/2017,"The service was great but the food was average. My father-in-law got Cajun shrimp and chicken. He took some home. He liked it. My wife and I  ordered the 2 for $20 deal. She got the sirloin steak with grilled veggies and macaroni and cheese. The meat was over cooked which our server took care of. Super sweet! I tried the ribs with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies. The vegetables stood out! It also came with appetizer chips and salsa and spinach dip. Good. Ribs were ok, but a little dry. Drinks refilled often. No wait! Placed was packed. Lots of Tv's with various games."
Jacob W.,"Bakersfield, CA",47,9,32,4.0,11/8/2017,The atmosphere is upbeat and fun. My lovely wife and I had a late dinner tonight. She ordered the 8oz sirloin steak with grilled squash and garlic bacon green beans. I had their whiskey bacon burger with fries.  The burger was delicious. My only complaint is they press sweet onions inside the burger. I'm not a huge fan of onions but they did give it a good flavor.
Robert D.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,121,8,3.0,12/6/2017,"My fiance and I came here primarily for the dollar long island iced teas, and they did not disappoint. First off, the iced teas were more watered down then your typical long islands, but for one dollar what more do you expect. However, after having 3 of them I had a decent buzz going, so it's definitely a good value! The food was overpriced and the beer was too, 8 and some change dollars for a pint of blue moon? Real expensive, but it was a great experience nonetheless. Would definitely recommend!"
Jennifer W.,"Bakersfield, CA",224,311,701,2.0,1/9/2017,"I remember when this establishment first opened. I would go to lunch here with girlfriends and occasionally to dinner with family. It was never my first choice nor did I completely enjoy it here. We have gone a few times with our boys. A few years back, we stopped coming. The food, in my opinion, was gross and the service was awful.  Fast forward to this past weekend. We received a gift card from a family member and our boys had free meal passes for getting Student of the Month. So, we decided to try it out once again even though we weren't that excited. When we pulled up, our boys were not happy. We talked them into staying. Kinda wish we didn't. But, it was pretty much a free meal. Although, I would have preferred to go to McDonald's! Service was pretty bad. Our waitress was friendly, but she never came to ask us if we needed anything. We always had to catch her as she walked by. Our food was delivered by the manager. We asked him for ranch and BBQ sauce. He never returned with it. We ended up eating most of the chicken strips without sauce until we caught the waitress and asked her for it. The food...yuck! The fries were horrible, the food was cold. Nothing has changed. Same bad place. I think we will continue avoiding this restaurant."
Chris E.,"Morro Bay, CA",9,54,34,1.0,1/7/2017,"Everyone told me this place had improved, but I should not have believed them.  Just another chain restaurant that should've closed long ago.  We had a gift card or we wouldn't even went."
Hani G.,"Bakersfield, CA",3,122,8,4.0,7/23/2017,"Nice restaurant in market place. Always busy. We were seated right away. We got the 2 for 25 deal which is 2 entrees "" 6 oz sirloin steak included"" and 1 appetizer. We got the sirloin steak which comes with 2 side orders and the artichoke Spanish dip. The food was good and surprisingly I liked my steak. Our waiter was attentive. It was a good service."
Diana S.,"Bakersfield, CA",45,11,18,4.0,7/2/2017,Probably the best service I've ever received by a young man and a girl named Linda. Very attentive to their customers. I love shrimp but this was most definitely not the best shrimp I've ever had. Burnt shrimp is not my thing. My baked potato was actually hot! One of the best ones I've had at a sit down restaurant.
Manuel G.,"Bakersfield, CA",5,98,27,2.0,6/9/2017,"We came in for dinner with a few friends. It wasn't busy. We were sat quickly. The waitress did take long time to come see us. The food was just okay. The service was just okay. Overall just a meh experience. I guess I shouldn't expect much from pre-made food, but the service should make up for it. Nope"
Inez N.,"Bakersfield, CA",136,204,94,2.0,8/26/2017,"I'm really only giving them two stars because the service was good and the place is clean. The food is so awful, and the menu descriptions are not entirely accurate. The happy hour deals aren't so bad though."
Darlene R.,"Bakersfield, CA",64,8,4,5.0,11/20/2017,"My boyfriend and I love coming to this Applebee's! Every time we come here we leave satisfied and full. I usually get the chicken tenders platter and my boyfriend gets his fiesta lime chicken or the whiskey bacon burger, and we get boneless buffalo wings as an appetizer. We have never been disappointed with out food, it always comes out hot and fresh! Our servers are always attentive to us and make sure we have what we need, which is great because customer service is VERY important to me and I'd complain if I felt we weren't being paid attention to. Overall, our experiences here have been great and we will continue to come back here. As for others who have had bad experiences, that's really horrible. I say you just talk to the manager about the employees that made your visit horrible so that the manager can do something about it to make this an ever better place to go to! That's what I'd do. :)"
Rebecca C.,"Bakersfield, CA",51,14,10,2.0,8/23/2017,I ate here last week right at 5 on a Wednesday evening. Not busy at all yet. The hostess was flat out rude. My boyfriend and I didn't have a server the entire time. The manager took our order after being seated & waiting for about 20 or so minutes. Maybe they were short staffed that evening? Who knows. I used to like this place a lot but service has gone downhill. 2 stars were for the awesome 4 Mac & cheese with chicken dish.
Alisa I.,"Bakersfield, CA",9,103,19,3.0,2/5/2017,"Lunch on Sunday w friends. Server was nice and explained menu. Ordered the steak salad. Meat was supposed to be cooked medium. It came julienned and merely seared (almost raw). Had fat all around the edges. Lettuce seemed beat up and was chopped into tiny bits. I wasn't impressed. The food ordered by others did not look any better. To me, it's not worth the drive over."
Teena R.,"Bakersfield, CA",30,55,72,5.0,1/3/2017,"Love this location, we have been coming here for over 4 years. Only once have we had bad service and management at the time did everuthing they could to make it right. The boneless wings are amazing, and you cant beat the 2 for $20 meals!!! Great Happy Hour appetizers and drinks!!"
Lindsey S.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,8,,2.0,10/29/2017,"I have not been to Applebee's in over 10 years & my first time back no one was there to greet us. An employee comes up & takes the persons name who walked in behinds us then finally realized we were waiting. Anyway, we get seated & had a lovely waitress. She is the only reason I gave two stars at all. She was attentive & sweet. Moving along, We get to the paying process & try to use a gift card that was given to me . The card did not go through on the kiosk & popped up as inactive. Our waitress tried on their kiosk, which we are literally seated next to. She asked her manager Brandon Wally what could be done & with the most rude attitude he says ""THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO. THEY HAVE TO PAY & WE ARENT DOING ANYTHING FOR THEM. THEY CAN CALL THE NUMBER ON THE BACK BUT WE ARENT DOING ANYTHING"". Yes, the manager said that & we weren't even trying to get out of paying, putting up a fight or anything. The waitress just asked what they could do after she checked the gift card. He said it loud enough to where other families could hear, which was absolutely embarrassing! The waitress repeatedly apologized for her managers behavior & even stated she was embarrassed. There was no need for his tone or rudeness. Just saying...not worth going if you aren't being served by our lovely waitress. Her name was close to linda or Lidia. Never going back unless it's to speak to a different manager about Mr. Wally because he was obviously not meant to be in customer service."
Gary W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,1,1.0,7/28/2017,This place is horrible.  The service is the worst.  The food is horrific.  They must microwave everything.  I would never go back to this place.  I just sent all of my food back.  First the French Onion soup came out cold.  Then the server came back with soup that was just tossed in the microwave. Sent it back.  I order the steak with mac & cheese and maple mash potatoes all came out cold.  I give up just sent it all back.
Jennifer B.,"Bakersfield, CA",48,70,182,2.0,4/3/2016,"I only gave it 2 stars because of my waitress Giselle. She was sweet and attentive.  Only came in because Smitty's at the Haggen Oaks farmers market was out of mac n cheese and we were all so hungry.  So the food was alright I guess I had higher hopes considering they have awesome commercials but duh it's advertising.  For a table of all vegetarians the best we could come up with to order was appetizers and the mac n cheese for obvious reasons. I got the Wonton tacos with extra slaw, the nachos , sweet potato fries. I really enjoyed the look on my waitresses face when I ordered all this without the meat!! Seems like that must never happen. Anyways so back to the food - tacos good , nachos were blah not special quiet the opposite I would say so the chips must have been from the bottom of the bag they were small and stale the microwaved cheese on top I mean come on seriously!!!! Sweet potato fries were pretty good but it doesn't require much skill to deep fry.   The mac was good, although the first came out with bacon and I had to send that back and that was for the kids so while we were waiting for the mistake to be fixed all the food was getting colder and soggy. The manager replaced the plate and apologized so that was nice. So for the rest of the restaurant, the bathrooms we clean and there is a changing station for the babies, the bar was pretty packed for a Sunday afternoon which surprised me but I didn't get a chance to see if they were offering a happy hour special. The remodel ?? Haven't been here to the Bakersfield location so just from first view it's decent. Staff that was delivering food to tables around me seemed to gossip and complain a bit not something you want to hear. Overall not a place I will frequent unless invited and have to."
Louvenia H.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,6,1,5.0,7/3/2017,Happy Hour was awesome at Applebees.  The service was great and the food was good. We will most defiantly be back.  The bartender was super cool.
Chris S.,"Bakersfield, CA",76,349,1772,2.0,1/29/2016,I feel bad giving such a low rating but the food has gone down hill. I used to enjoy going here. But this is my last time. We had to wait for a booth but no problem. It wasn't busy but they have to get more help because the service was really slow. It took a long time to pay also. My fish was over cooked yet the vegetables were barely warm and limp looking. I never received the salad I asked for but at least he didn't charge us for it. Change your menu and buy better ingredients and up your game. I can see why the ratings are so low.
Paula B.,"Bakersfield, CA",4,24,,2.0,4/24/2017,"The service is not that good. I order the classic burger which stated lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle and cheese. All I had on my burger was a meat and the bun. It took my a while to get the waitress to fix the problem. She never came back to see if we wanted a refill. It use to be good."
Kyndra L.,"Bakersfield, CA",50,3,,1.0,9/26/2017,"I had hands down the worst service/experience I have ever had at any restaurant I've ever been to last night! Our server Jacob was so busy with everyone else he barley aknowleged us! He gave everyone else around us his undived attention while We got the short end of the stick.  We got  to this location around 8:15 ish was sat fairly fast but they sat us next to the servers doing all their nightly sidework  (putting silverware sets together). Being as I use to work in a restaurant I've always tipped 20-25% but sad to say Jacob got no tip from me last night.  The food was just okay I'm glad we ordered an appetizer because that was the best thing we ate all night. I ordered the quesadilla burger I was disappointed in that. I felt like I was eating a crunch wrap supreme from taco bell. And the person I was with ordered some type of chicken wrap the chicken was so mushy It was just not very appetizing! I'm not sure if we will return to this establishmen due to the horrible service and with the food just being ""okay"""
Kevin D.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,9,7,1.0,6/5/2017,"Roaches in the lobby yikes! Staff wouldn't even kill it, there was also food and trash under the table and the front staff was rude about the whole thing when I brought it up, it definitely wasn't a good experience! The food has been lack luster and over all just a terrible experience"
Cuteness A.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,18,,1.0,6/2/2017,"The quality of food and service has gone down drastically since when Applebee's first opened up. I have tried to give it the benefit of the doubt because they have a good happy hour special daily starting at 9pm, but every time I go I am disappointed. My food is always cold and always just looks thrown together with no flavor. The waiters take forever to get your order and then ignore you when you try to call them. They have also on two occasions brought me and my friends another tables order. It's sad because it is such a nice place and environment they just need to get it together!"
Patti K.,"Bakersfield, CA",34,18,1,1.0,3/26/2017,"This used to be our families go to for fast service, good service, clean establishment, and good food. Sadly the only thing still decent is the food. For starters the waiting area smelled like the restroom, after being seated at a dirty table, we waited 10 minutes before I called over a server and asked if we had a server! The restrooms smell terrible and the booth smelled like dirty people. I think it's time they have a deep cleaning crew come in and get busy. Time to find another hang out."
Stephanie D.,"Greenacres, Bakersfield, CA",23,1,,1.0,9/17/2017,"Terrible service!! We waited over an hour for our food. The waitress never really came back so we didn't get any more drinks for happy hour if we desired them.  When we complained to her, she basically stated it wasn't her problem. She had a very bad attitude. They actually charged us full price for everything. It takes a great deal to make me upset, but we won't be coming back."
Rodney B.,"Bakersfield, CA",371,217,810,4.0,11/9/2015,"I have to give it to Applebee's for changing it up. Of course its the same layout, but they have made big changes to their menu and the look of the overall restaraunt. I appreciate this Applebee's putting a ton of local artwook which showcases our city.  The food was decent. I should have ordered the regular rivs instead of the gooey asian style ribs, my fault for being ""adventurous."" The fries were outstanding like all fries should be and their artichoke dip with their not Chile's chips was on point.  I appreciated the manager coming by to make small talk and to of course make sure that the meal was good to go.  A lot of places don't take the time to check on the service."
Yudith R.,"Bakersfield, CA",60,5,7,1.0,11/4/2016,"Most disgusting dinner I've ever had in my entire life ! Applebees by the marketplace on Ming it's disgusting! I ordered the Shrimp 'N Parmesan Sirloin†* ""WELL-DONE"" and this is what they gave me ! So disgusting ! I didn't complain as of course I'm a nice person and the waitress was being nice. But yikes, first and last time I go Applebee's!"
Brandon S.,"Bakersfield, CA",78,26,,5.0,4/1/2017,Went for dinner and drinks tonight. Service was great and food and drinks were on point. We like to sit at the bar and talk with Mitchell. Great time thanks
Edgar V.,"Bakersfield, CA",37,3,,4.0,5/3/2017,I love happy hour. The wait time is a bit lengthy during the weekends but thats understandable.
Amanda R.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,35,,2.0,3/10/2017,"Man oh man the food was bad! Service was ok but it wouldn't have mattered if it were the best service ever, the food was bad. I do not understand how the GM can allow this place to sink because of bad food. Get a new chef, implement more training on food prep, do something but until they do, don't eat here. For your safety and just so you get some quality for the price eat elsewhere."
Dustin P.,"Bakersfield, CA",249,11,6,5.0,2/18/2017,"A little bit of a wait, but nothing bad on a Saturday night. Did wait a while for drinks from a server, but the new server Steven was AMAZING!  He made tonight's service very enjoyable, and will make sure he's our server next time we come in.   Always had a smile when coming to our table. Can't take away a star for a serve not acknowledging us, but he did make it better. Enjoyed the 2 for $25 L"
Roland L.,"South San Francisco, CA",44,71,16,5.0,7/25/2016,My bourbon chicken was a little on the salty side. My strawberry lemonade thrust quenched was on point. 2 for 25 got my friend and I more than enough to eat while we were in town. Hats off to manager Brandon for settling the receipt and bill for my latter itemization concern at work. Couldn't have done it without him.  Tip: bring an empty stomach.
Robert M.,"Carmichael, CA",26,10,23,2.0,12/2/2016,The wait staff tries but the restaurant is just not laid out well.  When they are even slightly busy it seems like everything comes to a halt.  The menu has gotten worse over the years.  Portions get smaller and prices get higher.
Vanessa D.,"San Diego, CA",2,7,3,2.0,1/1/2017,"Whatever you do, don't order online and pickup. It only takes 15 minutes for a reason. My food was cold, late, and chewy. It tasted like it was refrigerated from last night and then microwaved. Ridiculous, considering the prices. I would have gotten better food at Jack in the Box. The employees are very nice, so I added a star. Otherwise, meh."
Barbara F.,"Bakersfield, CA",39,1,,1.0,4/1/2017,The food was mediocre at best. Steak was stringy and Mac and cheese was so cold it was hardened in the outside.   After informing waiter who then told management the manager Wally was only willing to reduce bill 10%.
