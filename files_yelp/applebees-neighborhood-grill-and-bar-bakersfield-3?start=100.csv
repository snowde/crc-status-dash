Ashley K.,"Bakersfield, CA",2,7,,1.0,5/20/2015,"I am sitting at your empty bar right now. There are severs everywhere. I've been here almost 10 minutes with no service at the EMPTY bar. Lucky for you, as I type, someone comes to the bar. You almost lost money to someone else for zero service"
Scott M.,"Las Vegas, NV",15,13,3,5.0,3/31/2015,"Best Happy Hour in town. My friends and I love the late night happy hour. We can meet up for drinks after closing our restaurants.  Great drinks, appetizer, and prices!"
Kimberly M.,"Bakersfield, CA",117,107,6,1.0,9/6/2013,"Oh Applebee's, I used to adore your 2 for $20 greatness. My husband and I used to come here often for lunch dates, the food was pretty great.  What happened?!?!  We came here about a month ago and I was very disappointed. My pasta was brought out to me cold, yes, very cold. The sauce was flavorless and bland. Our spinach dip was warm, on the verge of being cold with no flavor either.  This is the worst part... My husband. I have been blessed with a husband who will literally eat anything. He is not a picky person by any means, so for him to not like something is BAD. He ordered a steak and literally doused it in a1. This was the first time I have seen him use a1 since we've been together. His potatoes were very good, but the veggies were cold and bland as well.  Our server wasn't very friendly either. She barely smiled and couldn't even be bothered to tell us goodbye or have a nice day when we left. I hope she enjoyed her undeserved, way too high tip we left her. Maybe that brightened her spirit."
Breanna P.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/16/2015,Service was good but food was horrible. They messed up on half the orders and they forgot the kids maccorini that we ordered. My potatoes were hard and didn't taste right. As we were leaving we saw a big bug on the inside of the door.
Silvia Z.,"Arvin, CA",0,3,,3.0,3/27/2016,"This has one of the best strawberry lemonades. I have gone to lots of restaurants and I always try the lemonade they have, and this restaurant has the best one by far! The lemonade is sweet yet has a small tangy sourness. It has the perfect balance!"
Rikk P.,"Spokane, WA",5,46,79,3.0,1/18/2015,Drink arrived quick then waitstaff to a long time to take order.  Noisy environment many loud over-the-hill men and women drinking to much.  Distracting when trying to watch the game.  The good many large screens disbursed through out.
Brian G.,"McFarland, CA",71,5,4,1.0,10/15/2014,Food was ok but the waiter left and went home before we ordered turning a quick meal into a very long evening. I don't plan on going back.
Narciso A.,"Northridge, CA",650,478,847,1.0,4/7/2013,"Blegh. Came here for a late night dessert (love the ButterPecan blondie at other Applebees) -- which was fine. The coffee I ordered was disgusting, tasted like the pot was at least 5 hours old...and my hunches were correct, there were burned coffee grounds floating throughout my coffee! Yuck! Our waiter was ok, however other waiters weren't."
Hailey M.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,7,1,1.0,4/28/2015,I went in with some of my friends and they had us wait about 45 min for a table. It was ridiculous because we obviously saw that there were tables available. The waiter was nice but lacked customer service. The food was ok. We ordered hot wings as an appetizer and they came out cold. I know for a fact I will not be returning to this Applebee's ever again. Worst experience ever. Save yourself the torture and go somewhere else.
Steve C.,"Bakersfield, CA",3,2,,1.0,4/25/2015,"They're horrible! The food is okay. The service was bad waited over 20 minutes for a table.. because the bar was full of people.. The hostess said that this side is closed. WTH... ok whatever... waited, waited and waited, they skipped us and started seating people that just got there and they didn't even have reservations.. they didn't care about us. We got up and left."
Frank S.,"Bakersfield, CA",57,6,17,4.0,2/10/2014,Love this place really good deals happy hour is amazing deals.... How can we complain? Food for two for 20$ that's a deal
Hope F.,"Bakersfield, CA",9,2,,1.0,3/27/2015,"Three of us went tlast night for dinner and left very dissapointed with their food. Service was decent.  We ordered an appetizer, two Chicken Ceasar Salads and the 9oz Sirlon Steak.  The salad plates looked almost empty.....little bit of romaine lettuce with a few pieces of chicken! We asked the waitress if the kitchen made a mistake and sent us half salad orders instead of full ones.  She agreed with us that the portions were extremely small and took them back to get them redone.   As far as the steak, there was no way it was 9oz!! the 6oz steak at Tahoe Joe's is bigger that what I got from Applebee's. Steak was overcooked! come on Applebee's you can't even cook veggies!!  The baby carrots that came with the steak looked as if they just oppened a bag and dumped them on the plate.  Oh, and NO horseradish sauce in a restaurant??? Don't offer steaks if youi do not have the condiments to go with it."
Greg W.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,8,3,2.0,1/10/2016,This was my third time out to this apple bees. First two experiences sucked both food and service. And this time just the service sucked. Food was good they cooked it to my liking just took forever. Place is extremely meh.
Joseph D.,"Bakersfield, CA",22,1,1,1.0,3/13/2014,Been a while since been back to eat here. 2 for twenty sounded good .Food took a while and my ribs were overcooked. Step up to the bar and it smelled like vomit. Only thing that was good was the se
Angie R.,"Pasadena, CA",55,149,381,2.0,12/13/2012,"I'm not a big fan of this restaurants but  I know a lot of people for the drinks. Since I am not a drinker, I base this review soley the food. I would rate the food C-, I feel like its reheated frozen meal. I do enjoy their spinach dip and desserts but thats about it. I'd go to Chile's anyway, but since so many people love their drinks, Im happy with my spinach dip appetizer"
Steve D.,"Bakersfield, CA",3,11,,2.0,1/4/2013,"Me and my friend visited this restaurant and had a pretty bad experience. Ill start with the bad and finish with the good. Here is the bad. We had to wait for 45 mins to be seated when quoted for 20 mins. I expect this kind of system from restaurants. Though no professional it is a tactic used by almost all restaurants so that is not where my stars are lost. We were seated and the place was PACKED! again, rather expected. The cherry on top of it all was that we were seated next to a pair of parents who obviously had to sense of parenting when their child enjoyed playing with a knife and fork, throwing things over to our booth, and screaming at the top of his lungs. Nope, no effort by the parents or management to control the situation. Even after I brought it to the managers attention, he told me there was nothing he could do. He didn't even acknowledge our request to move and stated we would have to wait back in line like everyone else. And there go the stars. Here is the good. the food can actually taste rather good at times. Honestly I'd rather go to CPK. better service, better food."
Melani A.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/3/2016,"Worst service ever! Crap for food, and when we went during happy hour, the sangria's are always $5, well I guess, all of them EXCEPT the blackberry ones. Those are $9. Yeah, would have been nice to know prior to ordering. When we asked for our food to be exchanged since it was made so poorly, they brought us out chicken strips and fries, that were cold. To top it all off, when it came time to pay, they had messed everything up, then tried to fix it, and yet again messed it up. Rude management and horrible service, never again going back!"
Eduardo C.,"Yuma, AZ",0,2,3,2.0,12/22/2015,I asked my steak well done and it was almost raw. My wings were way too saucy ! Service was fast even though it was packed. Would not come here again.
Lindsey M.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,24,,1.0,4/25/2012,"The food here is disgusting, why would anyone ever go here? I went with my family with the intent of ordering a salad, but at 10 bucks for a salad served with their preservative laden dressings, no thanks. So I decided not to order anything. My mom ordered a steak that came with a side of vegetables and potatoes, so she gave me her sides. Let me tell you, these were the most overcooked vegetables ever! The vegetables were so overcooked that they didn't even hold their shape. It was like eating baby food. The potatoes tasted like chlorine. I tried some of their fries, which were good. No one at my table was really pleased with their food. I mean, it's edible, but it's just not good. I'm highly suspicious that this place just pops all their food in the microwave. The building and location are nice. The service is average. The clientele are mostly overweight. Do yourself a favor and cook at home, or support a local restaurant. As quaint as the ""neighborhood bar and grill"" slogan is, it should really be called ""nationwide bar and grill."""
Nesto C.,"Bakersfield, CA",7,30,52,2.0,8/7/2014,Bad customer service especially during happy hour. Waited a long time to be seated. Then waited longer for drinks and got our food almost an hour later. Come here less and less frequently
