Angela C.,"Bakersfield, CA",9,18,24,2.0,8/7/2014,"It's rare when we come here and we get good service, so our visits have been fewer and further apart. We came for happy hour and our waiter couldn't tell us what was in certain drinks on the menu and then forgot about us."
james o.,"Stockton, CA",57,80,109,1.0,7/10/2014,Terrible service with a very rude manager and an over cooked steak supposed to be medium rare
Mery M.,"Shafter, CA",0,34,12,1.0,8/5/2014,"Really disappointed with applebees. Went with 3 other people. When we first walked in we noticed a nasty smell. But whatever, we stayed and ordered. Everyones food was terrible. Service was okay."
David N.,"Bakersfield, CA",12,78,1,3.0,4/11/2013,"I order burgers at every resturant, and here was no different.  They are fabulous every time. .....Surprising I know. Atmosphere sucks ....only thing it has working against it Its also ALWAYS packed"
David S.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/5/2015,"Real REAL bad place. Never coming here ..everything was bad from the start ..we never got our utensils tell we ask for them like 3 times and no napkins at all and asked for mashed potatoes and got fries instead and asked for a booth but supposedly it would be a long wait even though there was not a lot of people waiting and lots of booths open,so we had to sit in bar area"
Lu A.,"Union Square, San Francisco, CA",1,7,1,1.0,4/5/2014,Wow all I can say this place has the WORST waiters . Took my son for dinner and it seem like the host just hang out about 6 of them chit chatty took a while to ask for our names we got seated 15 min . Once it came down to our waiter we had 4 diff people come to us no one ever introduce themselves or made us aware that they had became our waiter it took 20 min to get our drinks we order water ...... The food was poor I got the tequila like chicken wasn't good my husband had the shrimp and it looked burn our food took about another 30 min once me and my husband got our food they forgot my sons and that was another 10 min WORRRSST SERVICE EVER def not going back again would not recommend it
Nancy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,38,4,3.0,3/20/2014,Quick service and good food! It's a place you can go with jeans and sandals. I love that! Great happy hour specials :)
Michelle W.,"Lake Isabella, CA",35,11,7,5.0,7/23/2014,"Our go to place is usually BJ's, but we wanted something different for a change. So glad we changed it up this time. Aaron was our waiter, and he was spot on.  Didn't miss a beat with refills or noticing I might need something else to drink when my mudslide was almost gone. So, even though he was the star of the day, the food was right on par with his 5 star service. Me and my son both ordered the Thai shrimp salad. Just the perfect balance of sweet and sour. So very good, and the portion was perfect. My daughter had an herb shrimp and steak, cooked a perfect medium rare,  just like she ordered.  My other daughter had chicken and shrimp. We all had to sample each others food to see which was the best. It was a close tie between them all. We'll be splitting our time evenly between BJ's and Applebee's from now on. Can't say enough good things about the entire dining experience."
Richard L.,"Delano, CA",0,4,,5.0,9/21/2015,We came to Applebees on a Monday and ordered the steak.  It was very tasty and tender.  We were very pleased with the service and the food.  It was the best that we have ever had here at Applebee's.  Try it!  They have new management and new cooks give it a try! The manager also sropped by our table and asked how we were doing. I appreciated that very much!
Ryan R.,"Salem, OR",174,57,75,4.0,7/21/2012,The server David was fantastic.  Really personable and friendly.  The only reason for missing one star is because of the over abundance of hostile drunks in the bar.
Sindee I.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/17/2014,"Freezing cold atmosphere.  Employees say that cannot be changed.  I requested to speak to the manager and was reminded by another employee that nothing could be done as the cooling system is locked by corporate.  They do not care. We could not finish our meals.  Due to a medical condition exacerbated by extreme cold, we had to leave and will neVer be back again.  Two employees did not care about that either. How can they pay their AC bill?  Ridiculous!"
Marlena S.,"Bakersfield, CA",93,9,1,5.0,9/5/2014,"I always enjoy coming to Applebee's whether its to eat, or drink at the bar catching up with a friend, its a nice environment. About a month ago I was reconnecting with a friend who came back to bakersfield, and we went to celebrate their happy hour, and sat at the bar, and the bartender was very friendly. She was polite, but helped us as if we were the only customers. I find myself coming here more frequently due to the great service.!"
Joel O.,"Bakersfield, CA",259,7,3,1.0,10/11/2013,Service very slow server very unattentive. We won't be coming back ever again. Server never came back to take our order we waited 30 minutes then we left. We asked for a manager too. The last time I went to Applebees service was good and food was delicious.
Joey O.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,12,,1.0,4/25/2013,Came with my wife and the food sucked got ribs and it was very little meat and too much BBQ sauce
Mercy P.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,11,11,1.0,4/15/2014,Food is good. Service is bad when I went to eat there with my boyfriend they charged us more than what our bill said. When we checked our credit card statement we noticed so I called and talked to a manger and they gave me a call back it was the lady manager and she told me that everything in their part was good that it was my bank and just hung up on me.
Wen Y.,"Berkeley, CA",60,68,101,4.0,6/18/2011,"5 star service. We got the patio and the servers were very attentive with getting drink orders, refilling drinks, and bringing our the appetizers fast. 3 star food. I had the appetizer package since I went to a mingling event.  The boneless chicken wings were a bit too sour and had too thick of a soggy flour coating. The onion rings were nice. Fried nicely, not too oily. Batter stuck to the onions. The mozzarella sticks were fried very nicely as well, good crust, but the flavor was a bit bland. Could have used more herbs or pepper/salt on the crust.  The salad was lackluster. Typical iceberg lettuce with a tad of carrot slivers and cherry tomatoes topped with cold grated cheese and hard bacon bits.  Nachos were nachos. Not much to say about it."
Carolyn L.,"Pismo Beach, CA",366,166,134,2.0,5/6/2013,Omg the service here is usually hit or miss w/ the last being a miss. Our server was so rude and only focused on one out of her 3 tables because they were ordering a lot of booze. I think waitresses should treat all her tables well because not only does she look bad but she's making her restaurant look bad. Anyways the food is just as good As any other Applebee's but I just didn't appreciate the service
Floyd H.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,38,12,1.0,7/1/2013,"I have come here at least four times and there service is getting worse every time. Tonight being a monday night I thought they would not be busy so the service might get better. My mistake they just dont care about customers. We waited for everything, to be seated, for drinks, then food and finally for a bill. Never going back again."
Amy G.,"Bakersfield, CA",117,205,15,3.0,9/10/2013,Love that many options have weight watchers points already calculated! The food is hit or miss. I've had great meals and just okay meals. While on weight watchers it is handy as many of hte meals come pre-calculated for you. Service is fast and they aren't too pricy. It seems they always have a dinner combo (2 for $30 or something like that) which makes it especially affordable if the options suit your liking.
Hilary R.,"Goleta, CA",9,3,1,1.0,12/27/2013,Wait isn't worth the food drenched in salt. Plus my grilled cheese smelled like fish.
