Sam L.,"Fort Worth, TX",37,34,30,1.0,5/14/2013,"The Cajun shrimpy shrimp shrimp dish was kind of disgusting, but I was starving. Now I feel horrible."
Q B.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,3,1,1.0,1/15/2015,my bill came out expensive then I realized my server Luis was serving the wrong drink. other than that the place was too crowded and the food was not that good. the desert was orgasmic.
Joy E.,"Bakersfield, CA",198,44,5,1.0,10/11/2012,"This place may have specials, however it could be free. You never get service. Hubby and I have gone twice, seated quickly. Never saw a server, didnt get asked if we wanted something to drink or a poke in the eye. Second time was too much for us. Will never go back. Got up and went to local Muertos. Food, service and fun so much better. support local dump Apple Bees."
Brian P.,"Carson City, NV",7,22,2,2.0,4/15/2013,"The food is your typical Applebees fare, but watch out for the booths to the left of the bar. The seat cushions are in terrible shape. Management knows and does nothing about it."
Jay R.,"Richmond, VA",0,11,1,1.0,3/7/2012,Worst service and old food never again
Mark P.,"Temecula, CA",17,271,11,2.0,12/30/2009,"Let me start this review by stating that I don't like Applebees.  I used to like Applebees until I found out that just about everything they serve starts out frozen and they just microwave it on a plate.  YUK! BUT, we were driving up to Fresno from SoCal and didn't want to eat fast food again so we thought, hey the kids like their cheeseburgers so we'll give it another shot. In typical Applebees fashion, they have plenty of seats available but they make you wait.  My kids ordered the cheeseburger but they have turned the kids cheeseburger into a slider (TINY) and kept the same price.  The service was ok, food was microwaved, but it wasn't fast food...now that I think about we would have done better at fast food."
Nitesh P.,"Bakersfield, CA",8,15,,1.0,3/4/2012,"I'm only giving it a one star because of their amazing mango martini. Other than that, I'd give this place a zero. Such rude service at the bar!"
April K.,"Bakersfield, CA",39,12,12,5.0,7/18/2014,I have been to this location twice now and both times were great.  Way better than olive garden! Half the price. House Salad is great. And good in size more than just boring unnutritional ice burg lettuce.  Service pleasant food great.   We'll be back. Thank you!
annie o.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,41,1,3.0,3/15/2013,"Been going here for a while. I will always love their oriental chicken salad! It is one of my all-time favorite salads. Stopped going here because we only get take out and the quality has gotten worse continually for what my boyfriend orders, usually steak or salmon."
Anna L.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,13,6,2.0,10/11/2014,"Ordered curbside from online. If I'm being generous the food was ""ok"". My husband ordered mashed potatoes with his ribs. They gave him the bacon bits in a tiny container but forgot to add the mashed potatoes... He did say the cross cut ribs were good. My pasta was way over-cooked, very mushy. Definitely not something I would go back for."
Francisco M.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,16,19,1.0,11/3/2013,Would rate zero stars if I could! Crystal the manager was rude to all of our guests. As a manager I would have never addressed issues like she did no wonder this establishment is rated two stars.
Marcelo L.,"Bakersfield, CA",39,6,,1.0,9/18/2011,We showed up on a Saturday evening and expected to see a big line waiting to be seated. What we did not expect was to see at least 10 open tables that were in plain view of the front desk.   4 more tables were open in the bar area (which is usually first come anywhere else) but we were not allowed to sit there either.  Why do they keep open tables when people are waiting outside in the heat.   They have lost me as a customer.
Michelle H.,"Bakersfield, CA",206,286,218,1.0,10/11/2011,Good menu..cooked badly. Our waiter tried but the manager just wanted to blow us off by giving us a free dessert. No Thank You! Spoke with Jeff Ward District Manager in regards to our experience and got nothing but fake apologies. Don't even try going here in Bakersfield...maybe another location out of town
Jason M.,"Clovis, CA",63,35,60,4.0,11/20/2011,Stop in for Veterans day they were packed but on top of things. I think that any place that does stuff for Vets rock. And the food is really good to I love the hamburgers but my wife and daughter love their salads.
Rhiannon B.,"Florence, AZ",20,34,1,2.0,3/18/2013,"my husband and I have been there many times, and it was never anything special. but this last time was THE LAST TIME. it was busy but we were seated fast. our waitress was nice, but she seemed like she didn't have time for us, she was cold and distance. I ordered some pasta and shrimp plate. wen I received it there was a small piece of plastic in my pasta. when the waitress cams back I told her about it and she seemed like she didn't care. she asked if id like a replacement I said yes and she brought out my replacement way to fast for normal. we wont be going back"
Arlene M.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,14,,3.0,6/25/2012,"I went with my friends for drinks and snacks, they are open late and I like the fact that they have appetizers for half the price in the evening. Their long island ice tea is worth the money and  their wonton chicken tacos are also good. I did not like their service, they do not bring you the drinks on time and also it took our waiter 10 minutes to bring our check after we asked for it. I will go again and see if the service is better and maybe increase them to 4 stars."
Lori M.,"Jamul, CA",60,20,6,5.0,1/12/2011,"Love this restaurant. Not just for the food, but the team of staff that work there always work hard to insure that my family and I have a great experience...every time!"
Manuel E.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/10/2010,Came late on Saturday.. Food was great... Service was excellent... Everything was perfect
