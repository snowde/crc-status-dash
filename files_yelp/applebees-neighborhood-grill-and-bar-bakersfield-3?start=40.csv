Vince S.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,4,,5.0,3/31/2017,"Love the environment! Great food, deals, and people. We go at least 3 times a month. Go after 9 and happy hour starts!"
Myrna H.,"Wasco, CA",8,3,,1.0,8/3/2017,Took 15 minutes to get drinks food another 30 weren't  even busy ordered a drink never got it didn't charge me for it or would have been pissed .

Lee B.,"Shafter, CA",0,4,,4.0,3/8/2017,"Very friendly. And our lunch special was delicious. Cleaned our plates. I'm not one to yelp as much has these other elite 50pagers yelpers. Theirs some sorry a** people out there. Bashing and trolling businesses. It's sad . Im a cook at a family restaurant and there's the good and the bad, but come on."
Elaine A.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,22,3,5.0,8/10/2017,"Excellent food and service!  Had their pick 3/4.....we chose the 6 oz sirloin, with cajun shrimp topping and sides were their new garlicky green beans (perfect!) and garlic mashers!  We were too stuffed for dessert, but plan to return soon!  We were celebrating a friend's 90th birthday and she even ate almost all of it!  Of course, she took it home and enjoyed it the next night. :-)"
Fili C.,"McFarland, CA",15,3,,4.0,3/5/2017,"Overall the food was very good. Service was not as good as past times. Server had too many tables. Constantly would forget to take order, and bring silverware but overall all good."
Maresa R.,"Bakersfield, CA",47,11,6,1.0,12/18/2016,The waiter was very kind. Going to start off with saying that the place they seated us the area was very cold so I asked if they could lower the ac nothing was done about that then when the appetizers came we ordered the classic combo the only thing we enjoyed about it was the spinach dip my drink had a bug in it and the cup was dirty it looked like a booger lol very gross asked for it to be changed and they did..service was good but then the entrees came the food was very cold and hard we ordered ribs with mash and Mac and cheese the Mac and cheese was very good but the rest of it was cold and salty I really wanted to like this place but I won't be coming back here wish they would step it up with that food especially for the price it definitely is not worth it..:/
Dawna W.,"Bakersfield, CA",17,8,,1.0,8/3/2017,"My husband and I went to eat dinner here , we were greeted and seated in a timely manner . after waiting 20 mins a server asked what we would like to drink, waited another 20 mins for drinks. Than our server forgot that we never ordered dinner, after another 30 mins our order was taken. It took over 40 mins for our cold food to arrive. We won't be back"
David P.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,7,,5.0,1/19/2017,"We came on a Sunday night with my kids and wife. They said it would be about a 30 minute wait, they got us a table in 15. Our server was great! I believe his name was AJ. They lookhave aed extremely busy, but he always made sure to pay attention to our kids chocolate milk.  The food was delicious.  It was our first time there.... But we will definitely be back"
Cyndi H.,"Bakersfield, CA",357,248,1704,5.0,5/16/2015,"Can't believe we only have one Applebee's in this town and this is it... That being said this one is popping during dinner time.  I love the employees here. I've never gotten bad service or attitude from any of them. They are always friendly, attentive and caring. Whoever the manager is here.. I want you to know you are doing a great job with this restaurant!  I love coming here for dinner and a few drinks. The drinks here are strong and very good. Try the perfect margarita. You won't be disappointed. The food is pretty good also for a chain restaurant.  The molten lava cake is my favorite dessert. So yummy!  Applebee's, 5 stars!"
Melissa I.,"Bakersfield, CA",4,9,1,2.0,10/20/2016,"Got here and ordered an appetizer, 30 minutes later I decided to cancel it since I was sure our food would be coming soon. Another 15 min (45 minutes later) we got the food we ordered. Maybe they should hire more people. Don't think we will be back"
Terry M.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,26,,3.0,1/20/2017,"Usually this is a nice experience.  The food is consistently good and desserts are wonderful.  This time the appetizer, entree, and dessert were good, it was the service that was not up to par.  We were ignored at first, those being seated after us being served first, then the server (male) was very inattentive throughout the meal.  When dessert came, we ordered the maple butter blondie, which we shared, and when we've ordered this in the past, we chose not to use the cream cheese sauce, which comes on the side.  The order was delivered to our table by another server, and before we could take a bite, our server comes to the table and without asking just pours the cream cheese sauce over the dessert!  Under other circumstances, we would have sent it back but we were very tired and didn't have the time for that.  This server will be avoided by us in the future."
Emily C.,"Porterville, CA",171,3,,2.0,5/22/2017,"Good happy hour margaritas but the waiter we had made us feel overwhelmed because of how fast and loud he was talking . It was so weird . I know it's something they say all day every day but when a customer asks for a happy hour menu or what's on it and prices I shouldn't be told "" it's the normal stuff , margaritas and what's on tap"" I'd like to know my options."
Whitney W.,"Bakersfield, CA",211,189,569,4.0,6/4/2015,"Much better experience today! Came in for my wife's birthday lunch, and so there's that extra pressure for it to be good. And it was. Terrific server kept us happy with special orders and refills!  Food was much better this time. I tried the Triple Hog Dare Ya sandwich, which is pulled pork, topped with bacon and Canadian bacon as well as crispy onion straws! It was fantastic, and it filled me up.  It came with the new homemade chips, which were crunchy and nicely seasoned.  My wife ordered a BLT with soup. She asked for no tomato.  It arrived with undercooked bacon and tomatoes, but our terrific server fixed it up right away. My wife said she loved it, and the tomato basil soup was excellent as well. We had the birthday sundae and a brownie bite dessert. The sundae was just ok: vanilla ice cream, a small dollop of chocolate and drenched in too much whipped cream. But it was free. The brownie was really good, served warm with ice cream and hot fudge, and we both liked it a lot! We'll be back again!"
Jose S.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/23/2016,"We came in with a group of 5 how much do you think that would cost? 40? 50? Try 90 mother fucking dollars. Tyler was our waiter....dick. He was super slow and not curtious. He had a case of resting bitch face. They had a promotion going where if they don't ask about a gift card you tell them and they give you a free dessert, we flagged him down and notified him that we wanted to use this promotion and he said ok 1 sec....40 minutes later a manager showed and asked what we wanted, no menu was given so we looked at the menu once given...had to wait another 30 min . Shitty ass place. Better eat before coming here horrible"
Brandi B.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/18/2017,"I used to frequent this establishment on a regular basis, now I can't even manage to get my order in. It takes the wait staff so long to come over to take even our drink order. It's such a disappointment. Tonight for example I came in with a party of 4. We waited 15 minutes for our waiter to come to the table for the first time. When we tried to place our orders we were told ""sorry we're out"" of basically every side dish they had. We requested for just the steak then, he stated he'd still have to charge us for the sides regardless of if we ordered them or not. That made no sense, he made no attempt at trying to accommodate us. Very dissatisfied."
Nicole N.,"Bakersfield, CA",277,88,305,4.0,1/24/2015,"I like this location. They changed the menu. The pub diet items are a great addition.  The staff here is always courteous, the wait staff makes great recommendations.  Great place foe the family."
Alex S.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,9,,3.0,7/1/2017,"Food was good. However, there was a mistake made with our appetizer. I ordered a 6 oz steak and it clearly didn't look like a 6 oz, looked more like a 4 oz steak. Service seemed to not be on point today."
Bob W.,"Bakersfield, CA",92,12,35,5.0,3/26/2017,"Wow! What a treat tonight was bringing the wife and kids to Applebee's during Happy Hour! Our kids, 9 and 13  had been craving hot wings for a few days which is a monthly norm for them.  Dena and I like em' too and since we were out and about decided tonight would be the night. We have another favorite spot in town for hot wings, but tonight Applebee's got the call and off we went. When we got there the hostess greeted us by kindly opening the door for us and with a smile asked if we wanted a table in the loft area or would we like the Happy Hour floor/bar area. Of course in my mind the words Happy hour meant ice cold beer so my response was quick and off to the floor we went. We were greeted promptly by our server Amanda, who was very sweet and attentive.When we asked about the happy hour menu she explained that the HH menu did have hot wings but they were of the boneless type. We all agreed we wanted the bone-in wings and a helping of the spinach-artichoke dip. In quick time Amanda brought our drinks and made certain we were good to go. In no time our food appeared from the kitchen, all brought out at once by kitchen staff. Nice touch. Amanda followed up immediately and made certain we were covered with all necessities. The aurtichoke dip was maybe a little on the soupy side, but it tasted amazing. The chips are very light and tend to fall apart easily in the cheesy dish. Overall I'd rate them a strong 8/10 because of flavor and presentation. Now the good part. Last time we came to AB's we requested the kitchen to make our wings a tad hotter if they were able. We all like them with a good kick. What we were served honestly, they were just okay. They weren't nearly as spiced as the other place we like to go, but they were okay. Tonight though... omg! The flavor was amazing! The wings were very tender and spiced perfectly! Just enough to clear your sinus' but not so much that your taste buds were overwhelmed with heat. We ate through half of two 9-piece dishes when we realized that a couple of the drumsticks were just a tad undercooked. Really, not very much at all but just enough to make a person not want the next bite. The manager Dillon, noticed me looking at the chicken closely and scooted right over to the table to see what might be amiss. When I explained that there were a couple of wings out of the 10 we ate that seemed a little underdone, he quickly ordered us two additional plates to be cooked a little longer and paid for them himself!  He insisted! He explained that the wings were now bigger, which they were, and that the fryers cook at a certain time/temp, that suited the older style.  Great job Applebee's for stepping up to the plate in customer service. Made our night!"
H F.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,225,64,2.0,2/22/2017,I wish I could say that only the food was bad in taste but more than that both the hubby and myself had an upset stomach. Spinach dip and chips was way too salty. I looked up the nutritional facts later and it had 3980 milligrams of sodium. The beer cheese and pretzels was still a little salty at 1700 milligrams but edible. Unfortunately both of these items are pre-made from corporate and come to them this way. Corporate needs to fix this problem.  The four cheese mac and cheese is made with bacon but unfortunately it doesn't state it on the menu. The house salad comes with bacon but it doesn't state it on the menu. This is not good for vegetarians.  The fries were excellent and came out hot. The salmon on cedar plank was very good also. All the food that came out of the kitchen was hot and there's a lot to be said for that.  Not sure what upset our stomachs but if the food had not given us an upset stomach I would have given them a review of 3 stars instead of 2.
Danny B.,"Ventura, CA",0,14,10,1.0,6/2/2016,So much is wrong with this Place. But I'll Try to go in order of my visit 1) manager is enjoying a meal at a table near the bar while I wait for someone to greet me 2) i sit myself at the bar 3) wait 9 mins to be a...... I'll just cut to the chase. I ordered food and it took forever. They even sent the wrong app but I ate it after I realized no one was going to check on. Oh and while this is all happening the manager is now talking away with two servers sitting at his table.
