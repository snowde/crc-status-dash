Raul S.,"Bakersfield, CA",5,3,2,1.0,12/12/2015,"I tried to give this place a 5th chance but they messed up again. I ordered 2 entrees and 2 appetizers. The entrees came before the appetizers. I hate them for this bullshit due to the fact that that eff'd up... 5 times!!! Then i saw the manager talking to my waitor and he took the appetizer dishes away like nothing happened. Am i gonna get a sorry, another ""heres a free appetizer on ur next visit???!!!"", or something?ď Man fuck you. Ill be back cause its your job to serve me and this bs is unsatifactory. Dafuq"
Tori W.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,16,5,2.0,3/25/2016,"It looks really nice in here, now. Totally updated and seems more spacious. Applebee's is alright. We had a super nice waitress, Nicole, but their food is just mediocre.  Unfortunately, I don't think this is a place I'll ever have a craving for."
Peter P.,"Bakersfield, CA",407,257,2139,1.0,8/1/2014,We used to love Applebee's but I can honestly say they are disgusting! Who can go wrong on a kids pizza? I nearly vomited trying my son's food because he refused to eat it. Our server Charlana went missing in action for 20 minutes. We were gonna order dessert but we waiting tooooooo long for her to come back from lala land that we didn't want anything after all. Don't come here!!! Just go to Denny's hahaha!!
Artie N.,"Bakersfield, CA",3,4,1,2.0,4/25/2016,"What a dissapointment. We waited for our food for a long time and when the waitress told us our food was ""up "" we waited some more while she talked to the folks at the next booth,and took orders from the table across the way. When we finally got our order the burger was cold, the chicken was greasy, and I found out the large steak was only 9 oz. Tha small steak is only 7 oz. The med rare steak was served well done,with dry potatoes, and a side of greasy onions. With 3 soft drinks  the bill came to 50 bucks. ..don't waste your time and money at this place."
Patty O.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,3,4,2.0,7/26/2016,We went in for a late night. We had some appetizers and desserts. Food took 35 mins to come out and the desserts we not hot. The drinks that were ordered were good but overall service wasn't good. I don't know if she was tired or slammed but it was a long wait for just desserts and appetizers. The restrooms were not clean.  Hopefully they improve.
Yvette W.,"Santa Maria, CA",3,5,,1.0,5/27/2016,"Not sure if I can give any stars. We love the Applebee's in our hometown so we tried this one while in town. Slowest service ever on this visit. While the waitress was apologetic and friendly, she didn't appear to be trying to hurry things along. By the time she got to us she took our bar order as well as dinner order. Took 20 mins to get our water then drinks. My perfect margarita was no where near perfect. From the time we ordered it took about 40 mins for our food. Mine was cold. My DIL salad was wrong son's steak was cooked wrong. Noticed other tables around us were being taken care of in a slow manner. Not sure if it was waitress or kitchen staff. Manager blamed it on another table. They partially comped us, but wasn't enough for what we endured. Not going back and not recommending."
Nick W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,53,6,3.0,4/26/2016,Beer prices are getting extremely unreasonable. Even with happy hour discounting you are better off at just about any other restaurant in town.
Alex J.,"Ventura, CA",6,66,368,5.0,6/20/2016,"Materials aren't styles, but procedures can involve treasures.  Applebee's Southwest Steak & Black Bean Soup: juicy, wet, meaty, beany, a teeny bit smoky with mild to medium umami taste; Applebee's Blazin' Texan: saucy BBQ appearance from as much breadiness as meatiness; Applebee's Maple Bacon Chicken Piadini: slight hot tortilla crisp over smoother bacon texture to add mouth hot umami taste; Applebee's Chips & Salsa: crunchy lime flavors by chews for wet mildness in recognition of nostalgic texture as well as familiar licks above Mexican juiciness gusto.  This list is from the rooms inside my tummy out, inducing my favors toward Bakersfield Applebee's pickup moments table side to involvingly munch, checking p.m. guests four in bewilderment if not the rest smiling or curious with conditional excitement.  No Pink-165, a couple of things for silent promotions unless eaters beg, two to four meat pieces boneless rather than wingless, a building of distant symbols for glamorized alphabet usage, missing promotions for diet energy, plus hidden bacon in a sandwich with curly frills.  I can use a handheld to take pictures of Handhelds then eat the Handhelds with the handheld in my cool pockets, during my faint stay at Bakersfield Applebee's custom dining architecture of restaurant geography; kicking up the lighter fare with laidback observations over curvy Pepsi glasses and disposable napkins, I think a cup may be like this window during road trip visitations to colorful physics that spell out the hidden annoyance which forces itself in inclusion with Applebee's server psyche.  The Yelp reader mustn't improperly judge a message's ink since I'm schizophrenic with unknown mental disorders, but I confess that my mature bias for Applebee's collections of rations just stimulates my progression against typical interests, especially since I finally woke up after 5 years of blind life to heavily enjoy foreign foodstuffs.  A mere credit card isn't an expression, for style is idiosyncrasies, thus there exists good kinds of materialism on a planet where our smiles shine like flashing targets metaphorically.  Applebee's hours are a minimal surplus in freshness and reflect employee styles that go with demands revolving around business theories called policies; to remark on business practices, I believe restaurant rules are divided associations, so a company's gusto to stubbornness isn't completely understood with one basic glance; there has to be constant meals through precious time, in order to interpret my wits correctly and justify Applebee's readiness with allowed drugs and measured portions of attractive eats.  Applebee's recent commercials imply romance that isn't universal; perhaps with their presentation of possible opportunities, imaginary for many citizens, Applebee's can display their rad affectation for spicy clients.  For a commonplace Yelper to dismiss Applebee's, vulgar idiots might as well lie about gourmet maple mustard (which complements umami tastes) and complain about peaceful weather (which happens); I wouldn't talk about effective drinks as a rude metaphor or with gross exaggerations, since Applebee's exotic tasting and sales of partials for completions become heavy symbols of Applebee's exotic capitalism, which isn't totally refined with a cute picture of an apple."
Mari M.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,9,1,5.0,2/1/2017,Came to have dinner for my husbands birthday. Happy hour was great!! And waitress Taylor was amazing even though it was a bit of a wait for our food she was amazing at keeping us updated all the time and brought over the steak sauce before our plate everything was awesome food was delicious!! And free bday sundae bomb!!
Jill K.,"Chugiak, AK",3,19,5,2.0,12/27/2016,Waited for the carside to go service for 25 minutes for food... after the time it was supposed to be ready. Kind of defeats the purpose. Sat in the car for all that time with 4 kids. Not fun!
Kristy S.,"Bakersfield, CA",12,6,,1.0,6/25/2017,terrible food and serivice. overcooked food. serivice by waiter was terrible and managers response was unprofessional
Augustusaint W.,"Bakersfield, CA",3,11,22,4.0,7/24/2015,"Always a happy ""happy hour"" got rid of the cheap college kids with just $20 in pocket and spending $20 bucks on drinks, back to neighborhood Applebee's!!"
Cindy V.,"Bakersfield, CA",133,20,23,5.0,6/26/2015,My husband and I went there for a meeting with another vendor and really enjoyed ourselves! The staff was very pleasant and love the food! Menu is easy to read and the serves is very good. Our water and tea was Never empty.  Thank you and we plan on going again.
Maddy E.,"Bakersfield, CA",2,19,13,4.0,6/9/2014,"Went there on a weekend, it was fairly busy. The food came out slowly and tasted okay. Our visit to AppleBee's was made very pleasant by our beyond great waitress, Emily.  She was super friendly, made sure to check on us frequently, and give us updates on the status of our food. If anything would bring us back here it's Emily's excellent customer service!"
Lynn U.,"Pismo Beach, CA",58,111,688,2.0,12/26/2013,"The appetizer sampler was tasty, I forgot to take a photo. The rest of our meal was mediocre. The waitress was nice though and despite being busy we were sat in 15 minutes and the place seemed clean. 1 star for the quality of food, because despite their attempt to be more than basic the taste is lacking in a major way."
Jenna C.,"Bakersfield, CA",185,77,9,1.0,9/7/2016,"I would give this place negative stars if I could. Worse service ever!!!!!! Was told it would be a 10 minute wait took over twenty. When we got there, we told them We would need a high chair for my barely 1-year-old daughter and they said it would be no problem. While we watched they seated a family at smooth with the same amount of people but with older toddlers that came in after us and gave them the last 2 high chairs, one of which had been promised to us. They seated us at a table with chairs. We asked for a high chair and there was no response or acknowledgement. I ended up holding my baby on my lap for over 5 minutes waiting and asked again. They then informed me they had no more high chairs available. I asked what I was supposed to do & they said I could just use a booster. But they don't work with chairs & she would fall out of it anyway house she is so little. Then they told me I could just hold her on my lap. I asked for the manager and he was just s useless as the hostess & server. The place wasn't even half full and there was maybe 4 high chairs that I could see so I'm not sure why they didn't have enough to accommodate s common request. I am very confused & disappointed. I come her often but will not in the future."
Melissa C.,"Shafter, CA",33,19,11,1.0,1/29/2016,"I've never had a bad experience here until tonight. First, my friend only got 4 onion rings on her order, they were rude over her asking for just a couple of more.. Second, my other friend found a piece of glass on her dessert! They were kind over the incident and replaced it right away, but I felt as though out of common curtesy they could have not charged her for her order at all but they did.. Just thought they could have handled the situation better."
Kat L.,"Bakersfield, CA",89,38,185,4.0,1/19/2015,"Good service. Good drinks. Tasty food. Typical chain style restaurant, but I appreciate the detailed portion counts on the menus, calories, proteins, fat, carbs. Perfect for whatever kind of diet of the month you want to claim! My skinny margarita was lite, and perfectly balanced out, not overpowering with one ingredient over another. I had to click #4 due to the amount of the beverages served. My glass probably only held about 4.5 ounces. Then again, it was a skinny???"
Brenda G.,"Wasco, CA",0,11,6,2.0,3/30/2016,"Have been to this Applebee's twice and both times, I did NOT like the food at all! Service was okay and the place is decent....but it was so cold in there (and cold outside) I couldn't even enjoy my time. The food didn't have flavor at all.My boyfriend payed $40 something for food we didn't even like and left more than half of. Definitely not going back for a third time."
Priscilla C.,"Show Low, AZ",6,17,5,1.0,11/1/2014,Worst experience ever!!! Found a hair laying on top of my steak right after the plate hit the table starving from waiting over an hour on our food  and the waitress has the nerve to come back and say in an accusing tone that none of the cooks have hair and that it looked like wig hair!!! Wow really didn't know I was skilled enough to drop a hair on my plate right in front of you hmmmm...... Waited not even a couple minutes before they had another plate out to me so I'm thinking maybe their questioning of  my honesty is a sign of there dishonesty!!! BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!!! I WILL NOT BE BACK AT THIS LOCATION!!!
