Travis K.,"Bakersfield, CA",79,28,77,2.0,10/29/2014,"2 stars only cause they have 805 on tap. Other than that, not a good visit.  Ordered a medium well bourbon street steak.  I got 7 little potatoes, steak was charred on the outside and had no flavor. It is piece of meat and call fill a 6 year old. Best thing on my plate was my wife's bacon from her heavily loaded classic blt."
Rob S.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,17,6,1.0,8/31/2016,"Awful service. $7.50 for a small tap beer. Small, expensive, appetizers (avoid the ""steak"" quesadilla, so salty). Thought we would give it a chance with the new revamped menu. Still a bottom choice among the chains. Just about anywhere else would be equal or better. Open late (midnight) which is why we went once other places closed. Not good enough to give them another chance. Won't be going back voluntarily."
Jane A.,"Bakersfield, CA",7,10,1,5.0,11/19/2015,We ordered the Brunch burgar. It was so good. Will definitely come again. Servers were so sweet thanks to both Taylors. Good food and service.
Steve G.,"Bakersfield, CA",2,72,44,2.0,1/13/2016,"Ordered mozzarella sticks 10 mins ago and people next to us sat down 5 mins ago and already chowing down on mozzarella sticks....lol.. I ordered the shrimp scampi ...wife had the mozzarella sticks....and small nacho............Eh!!!that's about all I got!!  Scampi was ok nuttin to write home about ,,wife's plate was decent ...sticks tasted like typical sticks....took awhile for food ...seemed like the place was full.... beer is  pricey. ...6.99 for what looked like 16oz ..... been there done that kind of feeling , on to better and more unique places.."
LA Slug V.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,88,139,3.0,11/29/2015,"I read about this place and I thought they had free Wifi...nope. We went for the $20 appetizer and 2 entree deal.  Ordered the boneless chicken ""wings"" with the Asian sauce they are really giant chicken nuggets (whatever). Ordered the riblet for myself, borderline inedible.  Good sauce, but the meat quality is poor.  I think our waiter was politely trying to steer me away from that dish.  Note to self: Always pick up on cues from waitstaff about dishes.  Also ordered the Chinese chicken salad thing.  The chicken was a tad salty but overall a solid, delicious dish.  The service was excellent and I almost gave 4 stars but the riblet was ¡muy terrible! Sometimes going out validates my cooking.  Unfortunately this is one of those times.  BTW, a good place to watch the game if you don't mind paying $8.50 for a draft beer."
Jennifer C.,"Bakersfield, CA",41,5,,1.0,9/3/2016,"Wr just ate here and are so disappointed.  We were seated promptly, drinks were fine and we got the pretzel and cheese dip appetizer that was excellent. My husband ordered chicken tenders, they were just fine, not great but fine. I ordered a maple glazed salmon that was supposed to come on spinach with a sauce and fire roasted veggies and mashed potatoes. When our food came out I got the wrong meal, same basic food but not prepared the way I ordered it. The first person said he would just get the sauce and spinach, but that is not what I ordered. Our server took it back and came back and said that it was just the wrong plate and mine was still being finished up.  It took well over 5 minutes to get that far. We waited another 10 minutes and my meal was brought out on a dirty plate! Not like oh a little smear but crusty dirty! We pushed the call your server button and waited 10 more minutes before my husband just brought the plate to our server.  The manager had visited every table around ours, not even a nod out way though. They were gracious enough to take the meal off our bill and try to tell me that the plate was not dirty just the hands of the cook.... It was gross and so disappointing. We won't be back."
Sydney K.,"Bakersfield, CA",96,7,,4.0,2/18/2016,I mainly go for personality. That is all it takes to win me over. Even tho our food was under cooked. They were still very nice they took off the under cooked meal from our check. Very kind people and the food still tasted amazing. Even tho we had that complication i would still go back
Anici S.,"Bakersfield, CA",48,62,1,2.0,6/4/2015,"First time trying Applebee's here locally. I opted for a two time special at lunch. The food itself was just ok. Not the best, not the worst. I had a salad ( dressing screw up) and a basic half sandwich ( condiment screw up). Service was to be expected mediocre. All in all had I not had a gift card that allowed me to eat for free I never would have tried Applebee's. That being said I won't probably be back either."
Lori H.,"West Jordan, UT",128,236,56,4.0,9/4/2014,"Typical Applebee's. Came here for lunch since it was close to my mother in laws place. Hubby had a lunch combo of Thai Shrimp Salad and a Wrap. I had french onoin soup and honey chicken. It came with fries too. I was very pleased with the soup. Good flavorful broth, plenty of onions and a bunch of cheese and bread on top. The chicken was delicious and moist and the fries were piping hot.  Minus one star for the overly air conditioned place. I know Bakersfield gets super hot, but I had to ask to be moved because of the arctic wind chill that was blowing on me. The server said it's automatic and she can't adjust it.  If you go, bring a jacket."
Valerie S.,"Bakersfield, CA",88,127,335,1.0,5/13/2015,"The only good things about this visit was they gave us happy hour out on the patio and the first waitress we had was perfect. But everything after was bad. Came with a group of around 16 to celebrate a going away party. They would only seat us if half of our group was there, understandable. Once we were seated they start taking drink orders. We had  a perfect waitress who was very personable and interactive but then they swap her with someone else. This new waitress doesn't look happy and you can clearly tell she is pissed. She takes our orders of the current people there and leaves.Okay. Drinks start coming out about 15 minutes later, and after that no one checks up on us until our food arrives 30 minutes later. People are constantly opening the door of the patio and looking around at our group and then leave, never saying anything. Also, it took almost an hour just for us to get silverware to the point where we were sharing one utensil set and I was eating my boneless wings with a knife. A KNIFE. It took one of our friends about 45 minutes and a reminder to the waiter (who was just bringing out food) to get her sriracha shrimp that when brought out was cold. The waitress was quick to get our checks and we were more than happy to get out. Not worth it, but what else do you expect from Applebee's."
Jennifer L.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,42,46,3.0,8/10/2015,"Service is not all that great. The sweet potato fries are awesome ! They come with 3 different dipling sauces marshmallow, sriracha, and BBQ. Caesar salad is good. The steak is also pretty good with the shrimp and creamy sauce on top even though the shrimp taste like small frozen shrimp from a bag."
PatrickJ T.,"Bakersfield, CA",193,2910,14296,3.0,3/25/2014,"I used to be a fan of this Applebees location, but I no longer am.  The last couple of visits have just been mediocre. Their menu seems to be constantly changing.  I do not have any favorite ""go to"" entrees here.  Normally, I just order whatever deals they have going on at the time.  During our experiences here, we have always been treated fine.  Can't remember a time when the service was bad or the food awful. I am kind of surprised that this place still gets packed.  Each time we've been here, we have had to wait a few minutes to be seated.  I suppose they remain busy because of their good location at the Marketplace.  It can't be because they serve amazing food because as I said earlier the food is just mediocre. With all that being said, this Applebees branch is A-OK.  They could be a lot better though like they used to be."
Tim P.,"Bakersfield, CA",34,7,2,1.0,10/5/2015,This is the worst Applebee's I've ever stepped into. The place was dirty our waitress looked dirtier and the food was horrible. I've never turned back food or complained about serves but this restaurant took the cake. I will never step foot in the place as long as I live. If your looking to take the family out for a nice dinner this isn't the place. Please don't waist your money go somewhere else.
Nathan C.,"Bakersfield, CA",2,27,,1.0,2/27/2014,"Food was OK. Sat at bar and heard bartender complain about a customer ordering multiple milkshakes and sending them back. I mean complaining loud enough that the entire bar and anybody sitting in the area could hear.  Also heard remark from waitress that he should ""put a little extra in the next one"". Awesome right?? All of this right in front of manager whom acted like he did not care."
O A.,"Summerland, CA",1,17,,1.0,4/17/2015,Horrible service. They had us wait for 30 minutes just to tell us that they called our name and gave our table to someone else. She didnt realize that we were sitting right next to her along.
Joseph C.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,11,2,1.0,7/23/2015,"I would give 0 stars if I could, no night is ever good there. I wish TGIF would take over"
Paula S.,"Bakersfield, CA",122,52,10,1.0,2/15/2015,"I was really surprised to see open parking when we got there.  I really thought they would be much busier on a Sunday afternoon.  Now I know why, HORRIBLE service.  We got there today about 1:20.  Had a 15 min wait for a table.  I could clearly see there were a minimum of 10 tables available. I would have left then but I had a gift card so I waited. They sat us next to a table with 5 kids.  We are a 50 year old couple.  Really?  Not to mention the carpet had pieces of trash on it....that NO ONE picked up the entire time we were there. They never brought our water, even though the waitress walked past us 3 times until we finally asked for it. When we got our food we still didn't have silverware.  We asked the server for silverware.  She NEVER brought us any.  Never.  I had to get up and go take some off of one of the empty tables they had no intention of sitting anyone at. She never even came back to say she was sorry or acknowledge that we now has some. The food was good but the bad service will keep me away for good. Oh, just so I don't forget anything.  The hostess that talks crap at the front with other staff members....not good.  Not only did she do it when we were waiting to be seated she was doing it again when we were leaving. Management....I think you should take note.  I have been going to this location since 1997 and it has really gone down hill."
Carlos A.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,33,12,1.0,2/21/2015,"Horrible, L.A. applebees are better, asked to substitute one item and the waitress automatically said no. I'm in the hospitality industry,  she should have said ""let me check if we can substitute for a ceaser salad"". When we arrived we informed them we had 8 adults and 1 child. There was a large table in plain view, 3 groups that arrived after us were being seated first. In the end I don't blame the employees,  I  blame the management,  poor leadership."
Dena W.,"Bakersfield, CA",3,23,5,5.0,3/25/2015,"Rarely will I give a chain restaurant 5 stars, but our last family outing to Applebee's was certainly worth commendation. We primarily go for the hot wings and happy hour spinach artichoke dip and drinks, and occasionally we'll pop in to view a basketball game.  This evening not only was our hostess, Amanda, delightful and funny, but also the manager, Dylan, was the perfect balance between accommodating, friendly, and professional.  There appeared to be a very positive energy throughout the restaurant, easy and light; the service and table side manner, remarkable. Sometimes the social ambiance can totally make a dining experience, and tonight was no exception.  Great job!"
Laura H.,"Lancaster, CA",2,4,2,5.0,6/6/2015,Really love the staff here. Glen and Angel always make you feel like their special guests. Food is always consistently good. Not a typical Applebee's. Very nice experience when you are looking for a relaxing bite to eat.
