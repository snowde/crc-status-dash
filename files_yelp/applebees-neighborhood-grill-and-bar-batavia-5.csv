Karen D.,"Cincinnati, OH",99,609,444,3.0,12/10/2017,"Stopped by Applebee's last Sunday after walk at nearby park and shopping at Eastgate, I had a gift card to use. The place was busy and we found a bar top table in the bar area. They now have a monthly drink special of the month, December's special is $1 Long Island Iced tea, my friend took them up on the offer. We also went with the two for $25 meal special with an appetizer - my friend loves their cheese sticks, and both ordered 6 oz steak, which came with two sides, I selected wood fired veggies and garlic mashed potatoes, while friend had steamed broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes. Note the music in the bar is very loud and they also had Sunday football on, we were seated by a speaker and could barely hear. They are happy to split the bill 50/50 with the dinner special, so I was able to use my gift card. Lots of regulars, many people at the bar seemed to know each other and the servers knew the patrons."
Christopher M.,"Loveland, OH",30,99,59,4.0,12/5/2017,"We came here for dinner with my wife and two boys.  The only reason it was on the radar is this is the place I had my first date with my wife and the fact they are doing $1 Long Island Ice Teas right now.  I ordered a few apps which were half off even on a Friday night between 3-6 pm so that is awesome.  We got the cheese stix and pretzels with beer cheese, both of the apps were good.  I got wings which were priced at 55 a wing and they were awesome and huge.  I got an order of cheese fries which I didn't need b/c of everything else I had but they were just okay.  My wife got a 12 dollar 6 oz steak that she liked with a butter sauce on top of it.  They have really picked up there game at Applebees recently.  My boys got kids meals that were a good value. Pros: Great 1/2 app times 3-6 Monday thru Friday but may even be more often. Steak dinners well priced with good quality sides Cheap booze although not sure how much alcohol was in it Cons: The location is in the middle of a traffic headache of Eastgate Service may very depending on waiter Check still came out to over 60 with tip."
Courtney W.,"Cincinnati, OH",7,56,28,2.0,1/3/2018,Went there and got the lunch portion and 2 appetizers. Wonton tacos were good but chicken quesadilla was EXTREMELY small. My lunch portion four cheese mac and cheese with honey pepper chicken was the worst thing I've ever had at Applebees. The worst mac and cheese I've ever had. Taste like plain noodles with honey. It was so sweet it was just repulsive. My club sandwich was soggy. I'm only giving two stars because I like the wonton tacos. My friend who dined with me complained to me that her lunch portion was small and that the appetizers used to be bigger. What a waste of money!
Josh C.,"Batavia, OH",5,7,,1.0,12/16/2017,Terrible the worst management ever we had RAW wings and the manager just stared at us and didnt even come over they only took the wings off DO NOT COME HERE EVER
Andrew B.,"Mt Lookout, Cincinnati, OH",236,436,1200,4.0,7/10/2016,Have never had a problem at this location with quality of food or customer service. It is our go to location because of how close it is to us but I would have to say overall it is one of the better ones in the area regardless. For appetizers the spinach and artichoke dip and the beer cheese and pretzels stand out. They also have an option where you can get smaller portions of both together for a lower price..pretty cool. Their hamburgers are always exceptional..and the quesadilla burger really stands out. Never really tried dessert here because nothing has really stood out..tho I'm not much of a dessert person overall. Will continue to frequent this location when we're in the mood for some Applebee's for sure.
Elise G.,"Mount Orab, OH",46,5,1,3.0,8/27/2017,"Every time we go to Applebee's we almost never have good service, my boyfriend and I went there recently and I ordered ribs I didn't specify what size I wanted but pointed to the half rack.. when it came out it was a full rack of ribs, I explained to the server I only wanted a half and she said she would get it taken care of as far as the bill goes, towards the end of the meal it was getting harder and harder to get the server over to our table.. which it was Friday and they get busy so I understand. When we received the bill it was nearly 50 dollars and we ordered waters to drink! She never changed the bill like she said and we ended up just paying the full amount because we got sick of waiting and ended up not being able To go to the movies because they took to long to bring us boxes and our check."
Linda T.,"Loveland, CO",0,18,3,2.0,2/24/2017,"I always go Applebee's when I travel, but this experience was unsettling. The food was ok, there service was ok, BUT half way through my dinner they seated a women right next to me who had a dog!! I am not unsympathetic to those needing a service dog, however, that Little mutt was a long hair Collie that could not sit down, was not well behaved. It shook every couple minutes and I could see hair flying around. My allergies started up, and I left.  Isn't there some kind of health laws that prohibits dogs in restaurants? ?? I don't pay to eat out just to sit next to someone's dog shedding, Pacing and licking everything. DISGUSTING! !##"
Scott A.,"Williamsburg, OH",67,7,,2.0,5/19/2017,"Slow service; indifferent staff; appetizer was good (spinach & artichoke dip); Lemon Pepper Chicken & Mac and cheese dish was dried out, warmer on top than center (like it sat under a heat lamp). Quality has gone down hill since my last visit. May not return."
Randy S.,"Utica, MI",0,13,,2.0,7/20/2017,"40 minutes for a burger. Wow,  i don't even know what to say. I stopped in for a quick bite before work and it turned into an ordeal. I was seated quickly and the girl got my drink order right away. That's where the fun stopped. I ordered a burger and sweet potato fries. A burger for gods sake.  It took over 40 minutes to deliver my food and by then i had to leave for work. She packed it to go without much of an apology and i paid and left.  I ate the burger cold and wrote my review.  I won't be back to that location."
SL C.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,15,11,4.0,4/15/2017,Great place to eat !! Brit was our server and did an AWESOME job ! The promos are a great price but when ordering off menu it and be a little high in cost. Nothing strange just a side of fries. I will be back to this location.
April B.,"Hillsboro, OH",0,1,,1.0,10/14/2017,"First time here in a long while, WILL NOT RETURN anytime soon. Seated, placed order at same time as drinks. Waited. Waited. Waited. Table filled on other side of divide. Waited. Waited. Drinks finally. Waited. Table across from us gets appetizers & begin to eat. Waited.  Waitress walks by, stops, backs up & says you don't have your appetizers yet? Answer no. She makes a funny face & goes back to kitchen. Waited. Finally brings out 2 salads and 2 appetizers. Waited a long time. Waitress keeps telling us it should be anytime for entrees, told us several times. Waited. Finally brings food out. On my check was  bourbon street chicken & shrimp, lightly seasoned as well as 6 oz steak, medium-well, with mashed potatoes & broccoli. The chicken & shrimp dish came out sizzling and was very good, chicken cooked perfectly and shrimp blackened as promised. Everything about the steak dish was horrible. All three items were completely cold and the steak was so tough I couldn't chew it. I tried to make the best of it but finally decided that it had to go back, which I'm not a fan of doing. I asked them to prepare the chicken & shrimp dish instead & make it to go please. We waited another 20 minutes. In the meantime she brought the check and it was incorrect. The manager had taken off the chicken item instead of the steak which was more expensive. She took it back to be fixed. At no time, did a manager come to the table to speak with me, apologize or offer a discount for our troubles. I paid full price. Management should have handled this but kept sending the waitress back to the table. To top it off, 2 other parties ordered the steak as well and theirs was the same, too tough to chew. They roughed it through, all the while talking about how bad it was. In my opinion, the waitress definitely needs retrained, she apologized several times to not only our table but also both tables on either side of us for mutiple issues and long wait times. The restaurant wasn't busy either. This is not the Applebees I remember at all, it used to be quality steak cooked to perfection with an amazing grilled taste and sizzling when it got to the table. Long review but very unhappy customer."
Jodi A.,"Williamsburg, OH",33,38,8,2.0,5/19/2017,"My husband and I went for date night tonight, and we were sorely disappointed. The service was below substandard, the portions were pitiful, the flavors were good, but there was so little meat on my ribs I left hungry. My husband regular orders the pepper chicken mac & cheese meal because it's One of his favorites until tonight. Our server never gave us his name, we felt rushed giving him our orders , we saw more of the other servers than we did him. It will be quite a while before we go back, if ever. Never have we ever had this many problems at an Applebee's. I don't recommend this restaurant."
Jeff B.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,3,,1.0,12/18/2016,Probably the worst Applebee's experience I've ever had. Messed up two out of three of our orders and continued to have horrible service. Took my mom here for her bday and not only was the service **** but the parking lot was covered in ice and she slipped and fell. Now I'm on my way to the ER. This place is cursed and an embarrassment to the franchise.
Heather W.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",2,2,,1.0,7/2/2016,Wow....the bartender here last night was rude! Very inconsiderate of others. She was even getting shitty with the waitresses. Our waitress was nice & attentive....the ONLY reason we didn't walk out!!!!
lilly k.,"Parkersburg, WV",5,62,25,5.0,4/27/2015,"Applebee's review for 4.26.15 Intro: greeted and seated promptly. Place wasn't very packed. Very calm vibe. Order 1 (mine): Shrimp scampi linguine: Tasted and textured great. Had no issues with it. Filled me up good. Side: salad with cheese, ranch dressing, and bacon bits: tasted great.  Please note: We had a party of 3, However I do not remember what the other two ordered.  Service: Waitress was very prompt and pretty nice. Did great! Overall: 4.9  Recommended: Yes."
Jenni H.,"Milford, OH",26,250,21,3.0,12/31/2014,"I've eaten at this location a few times and I would say it's very consistent.   It's pretty normal for an Applebees.   Our waitress today was Danni and she was very nice; she did a great job but good golly was service slow!!!  We ordered the lunch soup and salad deal and waited 30 minutes.   Two minutes after receiving it, the waitress asked us if we wanted to place our next order because ""sometimes it's slow.""  I hesitated thinking I'd only had a couple bites but went ahead and ordered.   Again, another 30 minutes!  The lady next to us recieved her food long before she recieved her silver ware and then on her 2nd bowl of soup, had to ask for a spoon......again.    I'm not saying I'll never visit Applebee's again but it'll have to be when I have over 2 hours available to do lunch."
Jeremy M.,"Florence, KY",20,58,7,4.0,8/2/2014,"When it comes time to eat, but you don't know what to do, sometimes you just go for what you know. And such was the case when my brother Mitchell and I found ourselves in Eastgate with 2 hours to kill and empty stomachs to feed. I was craving a burger, and my brother had the same thought. So, we hit this Applebee's.  Accessibility: There need to be a few more disabled parking spaces in the parking lot. The ramp in the front wasn't that steep (good thing for me as I'm currently dealing with some spinal issues on top of my normal problems). The bathroom left a lot to be desired in terms of room to move around and I'm sure I caused a bit of trouble to other patrons parking my chair outside the larger stall to do my business. Otherwise, given the size of the restaurant I had few issues. Food: Good, standard American fare. Mitchell and I both got the bacon cheeseburger, and he thought the bacon was a bit too fatty. I didn't care about that. Would've liked them to give me more mayo though for the burger, which was otherwise solid. Fries seemed a bit too salty and I think my brother had the right idea to get his without the seasoning, though I do like the taste.  Staff: The people were pretty nice. Maybe could've used another staff member or two for the rush. I made sure I tipped well, because they were busy. Our server, Kayla, was pretty nice and kept the Mountain Dew coming (I can't have alcohol right now because of medication, otherwise I told Mitchell I might've opted for a beer). Price: $25 for two people pre-tip, I can't complain too much about that, really. I've spent twice as much on three. Overall: Four of five. The accessibility issues listed above hurt the score here."
Dane D.,"Medford, MA",75,105,12,2.0,10/30/2013,"Not impressed with this location. I know much of the specials are governed by the main company, but there is really no incentive to go here anymore. The decor is the usual and nothing exciting. The staff however could be much more professional. I understand it may not be their dream job, but you have to work hard and not be a playground both management and workers. The food was very lacking, but Applebees has never been a great food stop. My sirloin was a pathetic piece of beef and my wife's Chicken, if you can call it that, was so overcooked, it was very nearly inedible."
Karen O.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,2,,3.0,3/25/2016,"Drinks are always consistent.  Wish I could say the same for the food.  Ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp.  The potatoes (which were FANTASTIC on my last visit) were raw.  Asked for mashed to replace.  Didn't receive until I was finished with my meal.  Not sure why the kitchen can't put out the meals the way they are supposed to be.  Sure wish they would get their act together.  Can't beat their prices ($3.29) for a Long Island Iced Tea.  And boy, are they good!!"
Ryan C.,"Batavia, OH",94,2,,1.0,11/17/2015,"Always have issues with food,  not coming back,  I'd rather go to the white castles across the street"
Jamie B.,"New Richmond, OH",14,7,,1.0,9/3/2014,"I used to love going to Applebee's, but this one is not at all up to par with the other one's.  Went here with a group of five girls.  My friend ordered the buffalo wings, which should have been a easy meal, but when she went to take a bite, IT WAS NOT EVEN COOKED.  There were RAW chicken pieces on her plate.  Needless to say, none of the 5 girls including me finished our meals.  No one wants food poisoning before a wedding."
Timothy C.,"Cincinnati, OH",231,1,,1.0,4/2/2014,"They have beer. Cool! Do they have many vegetarian options? NO! Huge disappointment, probably will not be back.  Although the waitress tried to be helpful, at first she suggested their chicken salads, as a healthy option. Not necessarily what I was looking for.  Maybe they should look into more options."
Stefani H.,"Pompano Beach, FL",8,208,14,5.0,4/5/2015,My sisters and I ate here for lunch last Monday afternoon. The service and food was very good. This Restaurant was very convenient to where my mother is staying during her recovery at Care Springs .
J Springer S.,"Batavia, OH",63,11,1,4.0,5/31/2014,Great hangout. I always sit at the bar and have a good time. Happy hour is long and has great apps and drinks. Very lively environment.
Jason B.,"Champaign, IL",82,157,5,4.0,10/7/2010,"Came back late Friday night after working a football game.  The food was much better this time.  After watching the Today Show that morning and hearing how unhealthy the mozzarella-stuffed meatball dish was, I couldn't resist.  Just had to try it.  I only had a few bites and took it home, but I can tell you the meatballs were great and the pasta was amazing.  Very flavorful.  We started with potato skins, which were okay.  One of my buddies ordered the chicken quesadillas.  He only had one and gave me the rest (which is why I took my pasta home).  They were pretty good.  So the place was a little better than last time, but still not quite five-star."
