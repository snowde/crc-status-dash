Will H.,"Corona, CA",16,211,,4.0,10/5/2017,"Excellent craft burger, Caesar Salad, French Onion Soup and mashed potatoes.  Speedy service while in the bar area. NOTE:  all during the month of October, you can get a margarita in the bar or dining area for the amazing low price of only $1......What a GREAT PROMO....Spread the word...... The only drawback to this visit was the same nasty habit I now see spreading from server to server in the restaurant world:  They do not give you your change back with the bills, with the assumption that the change will be part of the tip.   Well, that is great for the server, but if you do the math and you were going to leave $3 tip, the extra 60 cents missing now bumps up the server's tip by another 20% from $3 to $3.60......Time for the manager here to step in and remind all servers and bar tenders to ALWAYS give the customer back his coins and then if he wants to leave them as part of the tip, it is at the customer's discretion....."
Morgan L.,"Riverside, CA",70,27,39,1.0,12/18/2017,"My meal was served cold, the mashed potatoes were the only item hot. When I asked for hot broccoli I was charged $1.49 for it. I had to speak to the manager to get it corrected."
Kelly K.,"Beaumont, CA",0,6,1,5.0,11/13/2017,My husband and I stopped by last night for dinner. We were very happy with our meals. We had steak which was cooked to perfection and a few appetizers and their French Onion Soup was amazing! Everything was very good! BUT THE SERVICE was the BEST PART!!!! We have not had a server like the one we had last night in a long time! He was very on point with everything!! We will definitely be back!! And we will be asking for Manuel aka Manny! He was the best server ever!! Thank you so much!! -Kelly & Josh
Nateika C.,"Beaumont, CA",0,17,3,4.0,12/6/2017,Our waitress was awesome I give her a 5 plus the food was good but my only issue and the reason I gave 4 stars was because you pay more and eat less. I'm not a baby I'm a grown big tall girl when I come to a restaurant I WANT TO EAT!!!!!
Kevin R.,"Beaumont, CA",0,13,,1.0,12/28/2017,"I was unfortunate to receive an Applebee's gift card as a Christmas gift. I considered throwing it out, but since it's been at least five years since I ate at an Applebee's, I decided to give it another shot. I ordered a bacon cheddar grilled chicken sandwich, and triple chocolate meltdown dessert. The latter was fine, but then again, it's difficult to screw up a brownie and vanilla ice cream. The fries had enough salt on them that I couldn't eat them. The sandwich was terrible - a thick slab of rubbery, reheated chicken that barely exceeded the quality of a bagged, microwaveable sandwich from a grocery store. Even having not spent a dime of my own money on the food, I still felt like I'd been ripped off, given that they had the audacity to charge $25 for a meal that, absent the brownie, was equivalent to food I would expect to find in a school cafeteria, or maybe a prison. If you're looking for a bland, rubbery, luke-warm beige lump of vaguely digestible protein, look no further."
Danielle G.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,29,8,4.0,9/25/2017,"Felt compelled to write a review based on my positive experience and the low reviews this place has gotten. I'm in town on business and there is a lack of eating establishments. Most are cash only so I came here when I really wanted tacos and beer... I'm glad I did though. Everyone was super nice, the restaurant was clean and the food came out right away. I got 2 entrees to go and side salads. Drive 10 minutes back to the hotel and everything was hot and delicious! I'll be back several times now this week."
N E.,"Fresno, CA",8,40,17,5.0,6/30/2017,"Did Applebee's get a make over!?? Food was amazing!! The service was even better. We had a party of 20 and our waitress did a great job. Thank you. I honestly would not come to Applebee's because of my past experience, but this one here exceeded my expectations."
Diana P.,"Banning, CA",0,19,19,5.0,7/25/2017,"Love this place been coming since they first opened for business , the appetizers are good n I love the French onion soup also a full service bar"
Gladys M.,"Banning, CA",23,27,60,4.0,5/19/2017,"Love coming here for happy hour. My boyfriend, son & I always enjoy lunch & dinner. The staff is friendly, love the prices, and the food is always served warm & quickly."
Kim A.,"Beaumont, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/20/2017,This Applebee's is the best one I've been to. Friendly staff. Great well cooked food. & it's always very clean. I would definitely recommend coming here !!
Madeline A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,13,,1.0,9/19/2017,"The worst, my husband ordered the blonde desert, with the ice cream, nuts and cream. For one thing the blonde was half the size and the ice cream was an imitation substance not known to man. I really see why this restaurant chain is closing their doors. My personal opinion is, no one should patronize the restaurant, just close your doors quickly."
Thomas D.,"Beaumont, CA",1,14,,4.0,8/29/2017,Cedar plank lemon chicken was excellent. We ate in the bar on a Monday night. Not crowded and no wait. Service was great and our food was tasty. We will be back. Only negative is they need to add mandarin oranges to the Oriental chicken salad and stock some champagne. 4 1/2 stars.
Jennifer L.,"Arcadia, CA",249,481,4707,4.0,6/21/2016,Randomly walked in here after lavender festival nearby. We needed a place to watch the NBA final. Lots of tvs. Great service during busy happy hour. Food actually came out fast and delicious. Happy hour domestic beer pitcher $6.99.
Ken B.,"Bellflower, CA",131,171,683,3.0,6/3/2016,Busy busy restaurant. But no worries just hop over to the bar and dine if you have no kids. Service is very fast and you can get your meal and dine quickly. Food here was descent and affordable.
Chelsey J.,"Gardnerville, NV",34,36,14,3.0,7/14/2017,"The service here is okay, there are some slower than others. Food isn't the best of course, it's Applebee's. Only pretty good for the 2 for 20 deals and happy hour deals. The place is clean though and we've never had a problem with that which is good."
Juan O.,"Corona, CA",240,13,,5.0,11/19/2016,"We just moved to the area and it has been our 5th time here.  All the employees are very friendly and welcoming.  The food is always fresh and delicious.  Yesterday, we ordered a to go order.  I was in a rush and I didn't check the food, until I got home and I had the wrong order.  I called back and like always they were really friendly and apologizing for the mix up.  I went back and they had a fresh new order and also added a chocolate cake with ice cream.  The handled the situation very professional and made us happy like always.  The manager Samantha Cottage came out and apologized again and I got to talk to her for a bit.  Great customer service  Great food  Thank you guys. Me Daughter and Wife loved the cake.  Juan"
Amber D.,"Beaumont, CA",54,6,2,5.0,7/8/2017,This location gets 5 stars simply because of there outstanding host Christian. Super polite and attentive.
Terry L.,"Beaumont, CA",19,18,1,5.0,10/11/2017,The dinner and service were awesome.Those people there hussle even with the place packed our dinner was there in 10 minutes and done perfect .Our waitress was named coco was very sweet and attentive. Great deal for seniors wens 30 percent off .can't beat that
Linda F.,"Beaumont, CA",0,8,7,1.0,10/8/2017,"Went in for 2 for $25 dinner. We each ordered a $1 margarita. I believe it was. non-alcoholic. ‍ I ordered ribs and my husband ordered firecracker shrimp and cavatappi. Ribs were dry and tough, fries were cold, but salad was fresh. Shrimp and pasta was just ok, not great. The server was good and attentive. Someone needs to get in the kitchen and manage it properly!  Disappointing!!"
Jill W.,"Redlands, CA",0,23,1,5.0,1/2/2017,"I really like this place. Today Tori was our server and she is sharp. Never let the glass get empty and laughed at all of my bad jokes.  I had the Sirloin and Shrimp Parmesan. I had a double order of broccoli instead of fries. This made the dish totally Paleo for those of you on the Paleo diet...Only 6 carbs, so I could have a few beers.  Close to home, really nice staff, tasty Paleo friendly food. I really like this place."
Jenny H.,"Beaumont, CA",0,8,,1.0,5/8/2017,"This was my first and LAST visit!!!! I was soooooooooo hungry for fish and chips and decided to try this place. First, the waitress was sarcastic, rude, snotty, refused to bring us ice water and refused to let me substitute anything for the coleslaw. I have a stomach issue that will not allow me to eat raw cabbage. She just told me, ""Too bad"" and then refused to take my order. My sister and I got up, left and had a wonderful, cheaper dinner at Denny's.  Very limited menu, terrible service and NO respect!!!"
D W.,"Riverside, CA",0,42,7,3.0,8/20/2017,"Sunday evening went in for happy hour, perfect Margarita's are ok, we order 2 for $25.00 4 cheese with chicken and I had chicken and shrimp, both orders were dry may be reheated too much but not was happy with the food. The server was the best but the food was over cooked. :("
Christine A.,"Beaumont, CA",25,32,,1.0,6/22/2016,"We got seated right away and that was the only thing that went right! Oh yeah the drinks came out fairly fast. The rest of the order took forever ! The steaks were not cooked properly and tastes terrible ! The chicken wings were coated in the worse sauce I have ever tasted!  We lost our server after the drinks. The manager had to step LOUSY FOOD, LOUSY SERVICE!!! We will never return '! This was our 3rd try and LAST"
Heather S.,"Beaumont, CA",46,12,3,5.0,2/28/2017,"I usually come here late night and never have a problem. They have a great happy hour and very friendly staff. I am somewhat of a regular here and Manny at the bar definitely makes me feel so.. he always remembers what we like to drink, we never feel rushed, and he's very very attentive to our needs. Good food good prices and great staff . I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a good dinner"
Tiffany R.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,60,79,4.0,4/1/2016,"I had the lunch special for $8.99, and was happily satisfied. For a chain restaurant, the food was really tasty. Service was good. The waitresses seem overworked as they seem to take care of more tables than they should. Good tips are necessary for them. I also love that my sister's cheer picture is up on the wall - warms my heart and will keep me going back whenever i'm in town."
Tim D.,"Beaumont, CA",55,1,,5.0,1/29/2017,"Sat at the bar and had Manuel as our server/bartender, absolutely great service! Very attentive and very social. I highly recommend being where he is."
Mark L.,"Beaumont, CA",199,130,96,1.0,8/19/2015,"This review in no way reflects on the service of Applebees. The employees were quite nice even though they mentioned they were short staffed that day and we had to wait an extra 20 minutes. The diarrhea inducing food on the other hand is worth negative stars. My food actually tasted great even if it looked like someone scooped it out of the trash and put it on the plate. My wife hated her food and said it was the most bland crap that she's ever had. After lunch we both became violently ill and we attest it to the shrimp and undercooked chicken that were on both of our plates.  Oh, and the price of 2 days of diarrhea? $81 for four people. The food is way overpriced for what you get. I guess if you want to lose weight quickly and have tape worms eat away at your body it's the best place to go in the city other than eating a pile of garbage under the bridge. My wife had to miss work the next day. They also have these tablets on the table where you can play games against other people which would be nice but they actually add a charge to your bill if you play them. Again, service was good. They looked stressed out which is probably why we got food poisoning. Our family has vowed never to go back. We will give any gift cards we receive to Applebees to our enemies."
Derek C.,"Menifee, CA",100,76,199,3.0,3/3/2016,"I'm definitely a fan of Applebees because I frequently order their lunch specials during the week.  Food is great, but since I'm used to picking up and waiting in the car, they have been hit and miss on even seeing me in my car waiting for the food to come out.  Most of the time, I will have to walk in so they realize I'm waiting.  I was once even told that they really don't carry out to the car, and I have to come in to get my food.  Kind of defeats the purpose if you ask me.  Service is always ok though and I can't complain about that or the food.  It's just that I've been to better Applebee's before."
Steve G.,"Banning, CA",13,29,,2.0,7/5/2017,"We have been going to this location (and others) for a long time and normally have no problem. Most recently we visited on a holiday (July 4th), well after lunch hour. The restaurant was not busy at all, however service was very slow. Our Server was pretty much invisible the entire time and never checked back once our meals were served. I think she had two tables. As a hospitality professional, I understand that sometimes a Server is having a bad day and is not on their best game, so I always tip, regardless of service quality. However, the better you serve me, the better your gratuity. ALWAYS check with your guests within a few minutes of serving the entree', and as often as possible thereafter."
Olivia B.,"Banning, CA",18,66,8,1.0,2/6/2016,"I remember Applebee's use to be pretty good, what the hell happen.  Our server was nice but food was gross Okay, so we ordered their nachos and tell me the meat resembles the meat you get from a frozen burrito? Seriously!! It looked and tasted like it had been frozen or it could have came out of a can. Don't get the nachos, it didn't even come with sour cream.  The chicken quesadillas were probably the best thing out of everything. And the mozzarella sticks are pretty standard frozen shit lol  My sons food was a joke! So you offer juice boxes but charge extra for a second, at chillis my kid can have as many as his little heart desires. His fries were cold and the three little chicken stripes were frozen and deep fried lol  Everything comes frozen, doesn't it!!! Lol Applebee's needs to rethink their whole menu and start fresh because I know your losing money to places like Friday's and Chilli's  I would never come here again not even for happy hour."
Rick K.,"Los Angeles, CA",123,25,2,2.0,7/11/2016,More expensive than Chilis and the food was blahhhh.   Nothing to get overly excited about. Won't be going back.
R R.,"Pala, CA",0,63,9,3.0,11/7/2015,Cleanliness 3 Cost 4 Cuisine 3 Customer service 4 Great deal @ 2 for $20. Its an average restaurant like chilis or tgif's. Nothing spectacular but good enough. Id recommend for a two for twenty meal.
Ricky S.,"Hemet, CA",33,5,,1.0,2/14/2017,"This place sucked the royal high hard one tonight, entree was good but server wasn't being helped by others, and the deserts (short shakes)were melted. Not good for Valentine's."
Heidi L.,"Beaumont, CA",0,12,,1.0,1/6/2017,"So far not good. I gave the bartender my order 5 minutes ago, but instead of getting my drinks and taking my order, she's talking to another customer. I hope that lady leaves my tip."
Scott K.,"Beaumont, CA",17,17,,4.0,2/10/2017,"Place was very busy for a Friday night, plus a lot of the elementary schools had their sweetheart dance tonight. Which brought a lot of father's and daughters in afterwards. Service was fast and accurate. Our waiter was very busy but still made time to come by a few times to check on myself and my daughter."
Ruben T.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",34,10,5,5.0,4/15/2016,"Applebee's  in Beaumont ? Who knew ! If you miss ""old school"" service with a smile , impeccable  menu knowledge & friendly guest rapport ... Stop here and see MARTHA  This young lady demonstrate  all the passion that make a concept successful .  Applebee's  is lucky to have her."
Jonathan R.,"Beaumont, CA",17,3,4,1.0,10/19/2014,Unfortunately I couldn't give half a star. This place still sucks even after the new waste of time and money spent on its cheesy renovations. And to boot its all because they still have that shitty night manager.   My family and I were sat down and waited 7-10mins and still never waited on. Not surprised. Ugh...Applebees please just die already!
Barbara S.,"Banning, CA",1,39,4,1.0,9/9/2015,"This place does not measure well with multiple other locations; to say it's poor is an over-estimate!  This place is sub standard on quality, and worse in customer service. Go somewhere else, anywhere else. It's not the fault of the wait staff but they take the brunt of complaints!  Not fair and equitable ."
Ashley H.,"Hemet, CA",0,27,,2.0,2/1/2017,"Went there today, got the 2 for 20 deal and for my appetizer I chose the spinach dip and they burnt it, all the cheese was black. My good friend ordered his bourbon chicken with out mushrooms cuz he's allergic and they threw major attitude when he asked for a new one. Then my fries that came with my meal were burnt. The customer service was bad, rude people. Our server was new and we had 4-5 different people bringing our stuff and they were all so rude."
Cailey S.,"Yucaipa, CA",85,3,2,1.0,7/19/2016,"It really sucks when your walking into a place to eat and two servers look right at you and dont even seat you. As well as not even having a legitmate hostess waiting at the front for people to come in. Terrible service and it sucks to say because I love Applebees in general, food is amazing. But the service at this location is absolutely terrible. I am a server myself."
