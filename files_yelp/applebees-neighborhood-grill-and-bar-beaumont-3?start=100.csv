Lizzie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",370,844,633,3.0,10/2/2008,"Applebee's.  When you need something to eat and are located in Bumfuck, Egypt.  Seriously, there is an Applebee's wherever there are places normal people don't want to go.  I ate at this one yesterday and had a fine lunch. I ate some tilapia, and on the plate was a moung of broccoli the size of my head.  They either thought that I looked like I love broccoli or no one else had ever ordered any and it might be going bad.  It tasted good though, and my lunch was healthy.  Applebee's.  Who GOES to this place if they have other options?  Luckily, it ain't so bad.  It's better than eating roadkill."
Rich M.,"Beaumont, CA",0,39,,4.0,10/22/2012,"The best food for the price on Wednesday's.  The Two For Twenty Dollars are the best buy.  Senior price as on Wed...great service.  Get there early before 6 pm and you won't Have to wait.  Food Great, Prices right?...a must place to try."

Rose W.,"Riverside, CA",14,6,1,3.0,8/10/2010,I normally love Applebee's but if you go to this particular one when it's not busy the service sucks but it still deserves a gold star for taste. I did the curbside to go once and I loved it! It was ready when they said and the quality was on point. If you live in banning I personally prefer this to the Chili's on the other side of the freeway.
Regina J.,"Redlands, CA",0,8,1,1.0,5/22/2011,"Really am not even sure about giving them one star. Ordered mac & cheese for my 3 year old. Came out looking like it had sat for quite some time and then reheated so that it was extremely hot as well as dry. I tried it and it was very mushy. My 3 yr old was ok with it so I let her eat it because we had waited so long to get it the first time. I ordered the bacon cheddar burger which came out the first time lukewarm with old, dried up, oily cheese and wilted lettuce. I sent it back and got new lettuce this time, but had onions on it (which I am allergic to), and was still lukewarm with the same cheese. So I sent it back a second time and I really do believe that the same patty was put in the microwave because it came out really hot and with the same nasty cheese. Also was dressed with onions again and pickles which I cannot eat and asked that they be left off. Really a shame. I usually like Applebees."
Jean d.,"Beaumont, CA",1,35,,2.0,7/22/2010,I don't  get the rave. its like one step up from fastfood...
Wayne H.,"Yucaipa, CA",2,4,4,4.0,2/19/2010,"Good, quick service, for a Friday night.  Chicken was tasty."
Faith R.,"Cabazon, CA",1,41,8,2.0,10/6/2012,Terrible food and not so great service. Have ate here 3 times and each time the food taste funny. I should learn but keep trying to give it a chance.
Jenn K.,"San Dimas, CA",28,7,1,1.0,12/14/2010,"This Applebees really really sucks! We don't live too far and became regulars on a weekly basis and order quite a bit from their menu. Anyhow, I have given them several chances to prove that at least one time they might serve a warm dish of food or not leave you sitting and waiting at your table for at least 45 mins to an hour for your food. The assistant manager Yianni that is usually on staff nightly there is the most rude and unprofessional person anyone could come across in a business establishment. Don't ever expect to go to this establishment and have great service or have any understanding when they continuiously mess your food up...the manager just would rather argue with you and not rectify the situation. I was a long time regular and a high tipper as well. People please do not waste your hard earned money on this food and establishment....go to Chilis around the corner where you can get HOT food and nice staff! It's way more with the bucks you shell out! I have eaten many Applebees all over the country but this one tops the list for the worst one out there!"
Cathy S.,"Beaumont, CA",5,8,,4.0,3/7/2009,"I always enjoy this Applebee's. Jireh is the best waiter Ihave ever had the pleasure to meet. This place is always clean. Prices are reasonable. I would like to see some menu changes. I did the curbside to go once, and it was great. I called from the road. And the food was ready when they said and it was piping HOT. They have a kids' night every Tues. Kids eat for 99 cents. There is a balloon guy and free dessert for the kidlets. I pt out usually, even though I have 2 children. Too noisy on that day."
