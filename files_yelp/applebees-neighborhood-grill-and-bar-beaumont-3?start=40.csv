Leslie N.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,17,,3.0,12/1/2016,"Applebee's is a great place to meet friends.  The atmosphere is nice, and the staff is very accommodating.  They have a wide variety of dishes even if the menu pricing is difficult to understand.  The food quality is spotty.  Sometimes it's so delicious, and other times it is less than average.  The same dish can be so different from customer to customer."
Cynthia J.,"Banning, CA",6,28,20,5.0,2/21/2016,Great service on Friday night sat in the bar to celebrate my fiance Mom's birthday! I love our server she was so awesome!!!
Dianna A.,"Beaumont, CA",0,4,,4.0,12/27/2016,The service here is very pleasing! Their waiters are all super friendly especially Jeremy! My husband and j like coming in at least once every two weeks or so when we don't feel like staying in to have dinner and we're hardly ever disappointed. Good management here as well I love to see the managers step in to help when it's busy. It shows they lead with good example!
Donna G.,"Beaumont, CA",21,44,85,5.0,9/26/2016,"Me and my son and my husband came in here on Sunday 9/25/2016 at 3:30 pm - 5:00 pm ,it wasn't that packed at all . It was clean inside and as we walked in we got greeted by a young guy he was very pleasant very polite ,he walked us to our booth to sit down at ,our waiter was very pleasant and very polite she answered all of our questioned that we asked. I ordered a chicken / shrimp plate but it had cajun seasoning on it and I asked my waiter if I could get my plate without the cajun seasoning ,so right away she got the manager and the manager took charge of the change on my order which was a good thing ,the waiter did a good thing by getting the manager and they both were very polite to accomidate me on making my order the correct way ,it's cause I can't eat nothing spicey at all . When I got my plate it was done  right and it was very good and I also had a peach tea quencher which is the bomb . My husband also had the chicken / shrimp plate but he likes the cajun seasoning and he loved his plate as well as I did mine too . My son ordered a grilled chicken macaroni and cheese dish off of the children's big appetite menu with garlic mashed potatoes and they were the bomb,he was very happy with his meal also ,The atmosphere in here in this restaurant is very good ,I liked it alot in here and everyone had a very pleasant very polite personality . We will come back again and try new and different foods from the menu .Thank you to our waiter she was awesome as well as the lady manager ."
Leeanna C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",3534,399,4787,3.0,11/9/2013,"Well, as with any chain restaurant, you get the same expected food and loud decor so I really won't get into all that. I only want to note that the tortilla soup is pretty gross, the rest is all the same as the next chain. However, I wanted to review this spot so that everyone knows that the service is sooooooooooooooo slow. Especially in the bar area. Good God!"
Stan Z.,"Banning, CA",0,11,1,4.0,11/9/2016,"The food was below their usual standard tonight, but the management  team went above and beyond expectations to make us happy.....thank you Sharon  and Jason. I even bought $100 worth of gift cards so you know I'll be back."
Lesley S.,"San Antonio, TX",939,1200,1290,5.0,11/15/2014,"I've been to this location multiple times and always had great service. After reading several reviews in the last month that had bad service, I have realized I must be the luckiest person in Beaumont to always get great service. We came in even on Veteran's Day which most people know is usually the worst day of the year to go to Applebee's or any other restaurant that offers free meals to Veterans. We were seated within ten minutes, never ran out of drinks, always greeted with a smile, thanked for our service, our food was cooked perfect, and I even seen one of the managers help a Veteran that walked with a cane on to a bar stool so that he may be seated in a timely manner. She told him how much she appreciated his service. I think this is a great Applebees. Considering the lack of options in Beaumont I'm glad they have an Applebees and a good one at that."
Toby B.,"Beaumont, CA",47,7,1,1.0,2/20/2016,We were seated right away but we waited like 20 minutes to even get the servers attention even though he walked right passed us. Then some other lady brings us our food instead of him. Was there for about an hour and only saw him 2 times. Never again. Never again.
Joseph S.,"Loma Linda, CA",0,14,,2.0,8/27/2016,I am looking at the last review and laughing.  The steaks were so chewy I had to spit half of it out.  There is much better steak at the Grand Oak nearby.  This meal was way overpriced for what it was.  They do not cater to kids.  The kids meals were overpriced and no refills on drinks and no desserts.  Remember with happy kids parents write better reviews.  Will not go again for a very long time.  I understand why it was not crowded on a Saturday.  Mediocre service.
Timmy V.,"Beaumont, CA",0,7,1,1.0,3/24/2016,This place has the worst service I have ever experienced from a large corporation type place.  I have tried to come in several times to see if it was an isolated incident. But it wasn't.  Won't go here ever again.
Virginia G.,"Banning, CA",0,2,3,1.0,1/29/2016,The worse microwave potatoes and vegetables ever.  The waiter took 15 minutes to take our oder .   The food was cold and not very good.  We will NOT BE COMING BACK!
Angie D.,"Fullerton, CA",11,6,28,2.0,9/21/2014,"The customer service was very bad in the beginning. The lady who took our orders seemed not to like her job and her customers. She didn't smile at all and seemed to look down on us. Luckily, she was not our server. Our server was Kathleen who was much better than the first lady. The food was ok. There were not many people there, but the restaurant took a long time to make our main dishes. My cousins said the Applebee's in Riverside was very crowded, but the servers were always friendly and fast. The Applebee's in Beaumont needs to improve!"
Keely K.,"San Jacinto, CA",47,14,52,2.0,11/5/2015,This is the second time I've used their car side to go and was completely ignored. If ur going to offer this service than u needed to have at least one person watching for cars!! The hole point of this is so I don't have to go in. Get ur butts n gear!!
Danielle H.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",130,164,10,3.0,10/15/2014,"This is definitely the best Applebee's I have been to. Kathleen was our waitress and she was exemplary. In fact, she appeared to be the only person actually working while everybody else was hiding in the kitchen. I ordered the nachos and they were very tasty. They use a queso blanco and chili with beans instead of shredded cheddar and steak. Delicious! My only grievance is entering the parking lot. It's rather precarious, especially at night."
Jaimie P.,"Banning, CA",22,28,19,5.0,7/26/2015,"Ok, so I come here a lot! A lot a lot! Not just because now everyone knows me by my name, or because all my friends come here after work, but also because the food is good. I love the buffalo sauce, I think their wings (boneless) are much better than Wingstop or Buffalo Wild Wings. Salads are always fresh crisp lettuce and veggies. They have a decent low calorie menu that my boyfriend loves also. Prices are good, and it's nice to go to a restaurant that's open after 10pm that isn't Denny's! Great bar specials, and I find the staff very accommodating."
Tim M.,"Calimesa, CA",5,13,1,3.0,7/20/2015,It's always a disappointment when you walk in a place and get ignored. Evidently the bar maid is the waitress as well. She only seems to care about the customers at the bar- seems to be her friends even tho there are only three tables with patrons. Thank goodness for the hostess who noticed we were being ignored. The happy hour is great. The food is quite good but the service in the bar area is tragic.
Laura A.,"Yucaipa, CA",30,16,,4.0,7/18/2015,This is my 3rd visit. I have to say my husband and I have been treated very well. The service is great as well as the servers . I will definitely be back
Matt G.,"Upland, CA",1,18,,4.0,8/13/2014,"This Applebee's makes their food very good. Although we've had a few oddball waiters and waitresses, there has been equally the same amount of nice ones. And I really feel like their doing a good job. Every time we go here I always get that feeling like ""OH GOD WHATEVER ITS APPLEBEES, WELL JUST GET A STANDARD DYNER MEAL,"" But the cooks at this one really put good effort into what they make. And I haven't had a bad meal yet."
Andrea M.,"Beaumont, CA",3,29,1,2.0,6/25/2016,"I worked in food service for years and let me say , I was Very disappointed in the service, cleanliness and food. The host was difficult to understand. He kept mumbling and we had to keep asking him to repeat himself, which became very irritating the third time around. We waited about 10 minutes for a server to even greet us. We had already decided what we wanted to eat and drink by the time she got to us. She said she ""forgot"" that our table was in her section. Pretty embarrassing to admit, I think. When it came to ordering, I asked if I could substitute fruit for fries; I'm pregnant and I REALLY wanted fruit. The server said they didn't have fruit. Well, I looked at my daughter's kid's menu and they at least had apple dippers. Hello, the place IS called Applebees for Pete's sake. She could have offered me those considering that IS fruit, but no! The server showed me other sides I could choose from that wouldn't cost me extra, so I chose the grains and rice side. A few minutes later she came back and said, ""I'm sorry, I just found out I will have to charge you for the rice side. Is that ok?"". Of course it was NOT ok, and by then I was so irritated I just let my husband choose a side that sounded good to him that he could have. For her mistake, they should have given me the original side I wanted without the extra charge. The food was nothing special, and it was served to us on a table that was haphazardly wiped down, smelled like an old rag and felt sticky. Oh, and my daughter's highchair was delivered to us dripping wet in the middle by the mumbling host and was also sticky. I wiped it down myself. Just an overall unpleasant experience and a complete waste of $30, which included a very generous tip of $3. TIPS stands for ""to improve proper service"" and the service was nothing close to being proper. Very sad, and we will definitely not be returning. Train your people Applebees"
Lindsley P.,"West Covina, CA",36,15,1,1.0,2/15/2015,"This place is awful, our food not good at all. Taste like it had been reheated one too many times."
