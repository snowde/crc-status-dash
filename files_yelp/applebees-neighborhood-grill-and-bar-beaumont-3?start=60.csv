David S.,"Chino, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/22/2015,"Just a joke of a place. Waited after being seated for 5 minutes, was ignored. Welcome Chilies."

Tiffany P.,"Tustin, CA",67,12,10,1.0,7/10/2015,Love the food but I like the bar and there is a waitress with a serious attitude problem she wants to sit on her phone and ignore request mix up orders thought the first time it was a bad day but when it happens three times it just makes me mad I come to enjoy myself not deal with her anger issues they gave me a free meal but she's still there!
Mathew S.,"Beaumont, CA",5,66,3,4.0,1/12/2015,"They serve beer and totally decent meals until midnight, which is hard to find anymore. Place is clean and the staff is friendly. Not sure what else you can expect from a dining establishment in the pass area... I always leave satisfied."
Ed W.,"Beaumont, CA",2066,148,918,3.0,2/17/2015,"APPLEBEE'S RESTAURANTS offer a very predictable dining experience. The food isn't bad; it's just not very exciting. A bit overpriced for what you get and a boring atmosphere make dining at Applebee's a very ""ho hum"" event."
Mike S.,"Beaumont, CA",23,134,104,3.0,5/12/2015,Fish and chips was good Spinach and chips was good Service was excellent Speed in which we received our food took quite some time Overall not bad Not my favorite place
Macy V.,"Temecula, CA",4,16,22,1.0,4/9/2015,Took my sister here for dinner and she found hair in her food.  We both got so disgusted we stopped eating everything.  Manager took food off bill so that was cool.  Def not coming back.
Dave H.,"Beaumont, CA",0,3,,5.0,7/13/2015,Great food  and the service was awesome today. The staff was friend and made sure our food came out on time. I didn't have to ask for anything they were on top of it. Very clean restaurant as well. The menu is way better then a few years ago and the chefs know how cook.
Warde M.,"Beaumont, CA",26,94,5,4.0,11/5/2014,"Lunch on Wrinkle Wednesday once more. Wife had broccoli-cheese soup & 1/2 artisan ciabatta sandwich, I had tomato-basil soup & same sandwich. We both agreed sandwich was outstanding. Wife also loved her soup as did I. Great lite lunch @ 30% off, I love this place!"
Stephen C.,"Murrieta, CA",0,5,,4.0,4/22/2016,I came here for lunch and got seated right away. The waitress was nice but disappeared a lot. That was main reason why I gave it a 4 star. Everything else was very pleasant.
Cody S.,"Beaumont, CA",67,6,1,2.0,6/23/2015,"Food is bland and not worth the restaurant price. Staff was mediocre. So many other options in beaumont for food, doubt ill be seeing this place again any time soon."
C. T. R.,"Loma Linda, CA",0,17,17,5.0,1/25/2015,"Celebrated with my family our wedding anniversary! Service was great! Our glasses were never empty! Everything we ordered was superb! Appetizers, Steaks, Shrimp, and Desserts!"
Stefanie P.,"Torrance, CA",1,11,3,3.0,1/24/2015,"My husband and I stopped for a meal while traveling back from Palm Springs. Little did we know there was a UFC fight being shown and the place was packed with spectators.  It was a little loud but we still had a great meal and our waitress Kathleen was very attentive. I had forgotten my reading glasses and the manager, Bill Norby, made an exception to have them mailed since we live several hours from Beaumont.  I would go back but maybe when a sporting event is not being shown."
Sara W.,"Beaumont, CA",0,7,,5.0,5/6/2015,Traveling with a 4 year old a 7 month old. We were seated fast and our food came really fast. I was still eating my salad! Great drinks to destress during our quick break. Clean and great atmosphere. My hubby is gluten free and they are always very good about making sure wheat doesn't slip in to his meal. Very attentive.
Jacquelin S.,"Indio, CA",3,21,,2.0,7/12/2015,"Very poor service, no management present on floor.  Wait staff seem unorganized and dissatisfied.  Ordered ribs which come with fries and coleslaw and tomato basil soup.  When the ribs came out the outer portions of the fries and ribs were body temperature at best, only the center areas were hot which meant it went on the slide hot but wasn't served out for a while.  The coleslaw had no sauce at all!  The tomato basil soup was warm and for 4.95 there should've been a lot more soup and not served 1/2 with crotons.  That soup was served in appetizer form rather than meal.  The final blow was they charged us .99 for a game on the table that was not noted anywhere!!  Now I know why we prefer Chilis.  This was strike 2  at this restaurant."
Henry C.,"Torrance, CA",3328,403,8,4.0,9/4/2012,"Here is my new discovery to late night dining...  Although there aren't any Applebee's near me, but if I'm in a neighborhood with one, I'd be very happy to be a frequent patron there!  Don't ask me why I'm all the way out in Beaumont, but hopefully all the other Applebee's can model after this one... Applebee's is a Denny's-like diner except with much better food in my opinion... They have their famous special of either 2 for $20 or 2 for $24 with  an addition of a free full size appetizer included!  (Always pick the chicken wings for the best value!) but what I truly love is their 50% appetizers during happy hour! So what makes this Beaumont location different?  They allow all appetizers to be priced at 50% during happy hours!  YES!  ALL OF THEM!!!  Also, happy hour is anywhere in the restaurant not pertained to only the bar area... (Be sure to check with each of the Applebee's location about what exactly they are offering during happy hour!) What are my favorites? **Boneless chicken wings... (Beaumont location allows to be either bone in or boneless to be included in the happy hour special) **Cheeseburger sliders **Wonton Tacos **Onion rings Imagine... all these large portioned appetizers priced from $6.49 up to $9.99, but during happy hours, the prices ranges from $3.25 to about $5 bucks!  The portion stays the same too!!! One tip!  Should you be shopping at the Desert Hill Premium Outlets, this would be great place to have a late dinner after a long day of shopping!  It's probably only 7 minutes or so going 10 Westbound! Also, service here is great (Served by Kathleen)!  But the parking is tricky so be sure to pay attention when trying to get into this place.... not sure why they would setup their parking lot entrance like this.... Next time you are out late and there is an Applebee's nearby, be sure to check out their happy hour special!  Remember, HH happens between 3-6pm and 9p-close!"
Thomas R.,"Beaumont, CA",28,23,5,5.0,8/27/2014,"I've gone to this location multiple times and have always had good experiences.  Whether it's dinner with the family, drinks with my wife, watching football, basketball or the free showings of UFC events with friends we always enjoy ourselves. That being said, I have been to other locations where the food has been bland."
Dennis M.,"Corona, CA",75,20,17,2.0,9/21/2014,"The low rating is for the disheveled bar area. Came in after work to catch the end of the football game and have some dinner. They obviously couldn't handle the rush because the bar is a mess! There were plenty of open seats,  but I had to search for a spot that had actually been bussed and wiped down! It looked like a bomb went off in this place. It's an embarrassment to most other Applebee's. Sat here for 10 minutes waiting for someone to help me. Finally went and asked if anyone was working. ......pitiful."
Georg H.,"Anaheim, CA",0,9,2,1.0,6/3/2014,"Insult to food. Prepared without any love or care. The waitress hates her job and it shows. And of top, they run out of beer.... Beer, not tortured water"
Jessica H.,"Pomona, CA",75,18,27,3.0,10/25/2014,Food was good and the service was pretty good. We were seated next to two other tables that like us also had babies so I'm assuming they say us all in one section on purpose. A waiter introduced himself as our waiter and said if we need anything to let him know however he never took our order or came back just all of a sudden another girl was serving us. I found that odd but her service was good so there was no issue.
