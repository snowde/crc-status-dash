Paul W.,"Benicia, CA",1,4,,5.0,12/29/2014,"This is on customer service alone.  I always sit at bars you get better consitant service.  I have not been to an Applebee's in years(I'm kind of a foodie food snob), but it was the only thing open.  Service was fantastic and the burgers have improved they are now backyardish and not over complicated.   Soft bun and charred patty.   Not gourmet, but not disappointing as expected."
Gracie P.,"Beaumont, CA",0,1,,3.0,12/10/2015,I've come here serveral times and the service is always horrible however today me and my family were helped by Stacey ( Anastasia is her real name) and she was so attentive and efficient I was impressed! She was amazing! Thank u for the great service!
Chris C.,"Beaumont, CA",0,3,,2.0,11/28/2015,"Make sure you check your food when you pick it up, I ordered a burger called ""The Classic"" it was suppose to come with bacon cheese and lettuce onions. But all got was no bacon and no cheese, paying extra for the burger. Once again check your food before you pick up."
David H.,"St. George, UT",0,4,,5.0,12/19/2015,"After living in Beaumont for 5 years one realizes that there aren't many good restaurants in the area.  And mostly fast food establishments,  We have eaten at Applebee's over 50 times, and continue to be impressed with the excellent service and consistently good food.  I see all the poor reviews and wonder if these are people who are really hard to please or are they the competition.  Honestly, if it weren't for Applebee's, we'd be making many more trips to Palm Springs or Redlands or Riverside."
Crystal W.,"Beaumont, CA",34,3,,2.0,8/13/2015,"Service was bad. Food was burnt. They took forever to place our order. Forever to bring us our food. Forever to bring us ranch sauce. And forever to pick up our checks. Very poor service. Not happy. Still waiting here as I write this, for them to take my money. Two minutes away from just walking out the door. They honestly wouldn't even notice, because we got no acknowledgement the entire time."
David M.,"Hemet, CA",70,49,134,4.0,3/26/2014,The drinks took forever when after ordering. I think they forgot to make them. I wasn't pleased with the mixed drinks. The servers were pleasant. The food was delicious.
Bill M.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",0,104,68,1.0,11/12/2013,Drinks n Food good.  Problem kids {under 10} running around and yelling in bar.  Parents busy texting and not paying attention.
Quinn C.,"Beaumont, CA",36,211,1,1.0,8/18/2013,"Horrible service at this Applebee's today!  We waited about ten minutes for someone to come over and take our drink order.  No apology, nothing.  Took about another five to get drinks.  15 minutes for appetizers and then, of course, food came out about one minute later.  Waitress was either MIA or walking fast by our table and not even checking on us.  Terrible!  I complained to manager, which is rare for me to do, but that's how bad it was.  She took one thing off our bill and was very nice about it.  The waitress, however, was so bad.  I would say maybe they were shorthanded, but even if they were the waitress walking by us numerous times without looking at us is inexcusable.  The food was actually good today, other times it's been pretty bad.  It's always something with this place.  If Beaumont had more choices we never would've gone back after first time."
Carlos D.,"Beaumont, CA",13,8,8,2.0,3/6/2014,Every time I have been to this place the service has been disappointing and yet again yesterday night same thing as always as far as food this place is okay but I don't recommend the service to anybody
Matt M.,"Fresno, CA",42,436,48,3.0,10/22/2013,It's been fair at best the few times I've gone there.  It's kind of what you expect from a chain.
Nora F.,"San Diego, CA",405,235,45,2.0,3/11/2013,The manager was really helpful but our waitress was MIA. The food from Applebee's is generally better but not this time. I ordered the jalapeño lime shrimp and it tasted like it tasted like it came out of a microwave.
Stephanie S.,"Calimesa, CA",0,10,1,5.0,5/6/2015,"Very friendly staff! We love coming here for drinks and appetizers everything is always so good. Not once have we had bad service even when they seem to be super busy they stay on top of everything. The only complaint is, We miss Gary as the bartender haha. Keep up the good work guys :) we'll be back soon!"
David R.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",170,34,53,4.0,9/30/2013,This place is terrific.  Bathrooms are so clean and the food surprisingly delicious. Not the Applebee's I remember in the past.
Mike F.,"Beaumont, CA",0,144,7,1.0,8/16/2012,Horrible Applebee's. We go there every 6 months to see if anything has changed. It never has. Horrible service. It takes forever to get your food. The food is always cold.  Not sure why they can't get it together.
Panda G.,"Temecula, CA",58,46,17,5.0,9/26/2012,I come here often for Happy Hour. I love the prices and the bartender Gary is pretty cool and very helpful. I've never had a single rude server.
Ray P.,"San Diego, CA",0,19,2,5.0,7/10/2014,my favorite place for cocktails the bartender made our drinks just right. when we asked for sugestion to the menu the waitress was very informed on what  came with what.
Tyler M.,"Banning, CA",0,15,,1.0,1/28/2014,Every time I come here I leave disappointed. That usually never happens to me at a restaurant. The food along with the service is just too mediocre. Since this always happens to me here I had to only give it one star. Sorry but not sorry
One P.,"Beaumont, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/1/2014,"Second time here in two years coming here received a gift card for x-mas having dinner with my wife on new years eve. The hostess greeted us sat us down at a booth and then we waited. The restaurant was fairly busy being new years eve it was approximately 4:PM. We sat there as a waitress walked by us 2-3 times, after 15 min another waiter walked by and took the order of the booth right next to us that had been there for no more than 5 min, wow. My wife was saying how other parties around us were being waited on while we sat for a glass of ice water, my wife then requested to go somewhere else and I was more than happy. Wow, terrible service if I was a Manager there I would not be happy. We then left and went to El Charros, it was great, thank you."
Clinton B.,"Beaumont, CA",5,86,4,1.0,7/22/2011,"Horrible Service everytime I've been here!  Spend the extra 10 minutes on the freeway a go to the one Redlands. Trust me, you actually save time by doing so!"
Paul J.,"Shawnee, OK",0,28,,4.0,2/24/2009,"The previous reviewer is not from this area so I sort of get her review. If you live in this area, we really do not have many choices and Applebees is really one of the better places to eat around here IMHO.  Heather O. and Jireh - top notch wait staff! Ask for them by name! Excellence in customer service and very attentive.  Trish is an outstanding manager. She cares about her peeps and cares about your experience. If it is not right, she will make sure it is made right.  Sometimes the food can be hit or miss but if you have the right people serving you, the food will be right too! They will make sure of it.  I eat here once a week or so but I make sure I go in when my favorite peeps are working."
