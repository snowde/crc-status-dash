Roxie G.,"Portland, OR",133,131,39,4.0,12/26/2017,"I haven't stepped foot in an Applebees since the year 2000. But the man got a gift card from work and I wanted steak. So we thought we try that new special going on. I got th 12oz and it was tasty, the parts I got to eat. I know a good steak has some fat. But this was a lot. I ate around it, no big deal. Our server was Brandon, I believe. He was great! On top of everything. Polite all the way thru too. Because of him I'm thinking of coming back."
Baltazar R.,"Beaverton, OR",45,40,125,1.0,1/1/2018,"MISSING MENU ITEMS topped off with BAD ATTITUDE. After driving 6 hours we were looking forward to visiting our usual restaurant, which we love because the good price, fair treatment and kids love to use the tablets' games. Today was different.... No milk, no chocolate milk, no apple juice nor french fries. Ok, we can deal with that and order other things from menu. What we can't stand is bad service from the waitress. She literally said ""Well, it's a restaurant... It happens "". Maybe she thought it was funny but after a few interactions we noticed she was about to walk out the door (And we would have applauded that!). We'll fill out the survey and notify headquarters about this because we really love this chain, we actually had a great experience at another Applebee's just two days ago!"
Patricia G.,"Beaverton, OR",32,101,181,1.0,10/16/2017,Years ago I went to Applebee's on a regular basis. I haven't been here in a very long time. I didn't remember why until tonight.  Service: has to be the slowest service of anywhere I've been. You can't even waive down your sever. I was able to order my sons food and it was served before I could even order mine.  Food: The menu looks great but the food taste is yuck!
Kayrin P.,"Portland, OR",53,52,15,2.0,10/15/2017,Just as below average as I remembered. We decided (erroneously) to go here last Friday during the $1 margarita special. BAD IDEA. The place was packed. The food was so flavorless and bland. One up-note - the mozzarella sticks. I work across the street and this should/could be a go-to spot. Nope.  I swear their food used to be good....what happened?
Nguyen Minh Man T.,"Beaverton, OR",30,1,,1.0,12/27/2017,Food is disgusting. Went here for breakfast and ordered the 4 cheese mac n cheese with chicken tenders. There was too much oil in the fried chicken
Jessica B.,"Tanasbourne, OR",67,9,,5.0,12/21/2017,"Everything is fine, the only bad thing is the hostesses, they do not even know what they doing"
Zoey M.,"Beaverton, OR",0,36,21,4.0,4/8/2017,"It seems like I may have had an unusual dining experience here in that it was quite pleasant for me and my family. I have only now checked Yelp reviews for this place after the fact and am pretty shocked at other's experiences. Then again, I am not too picky and I ask for very little: good tasting food and decent customer service.  We went here on a Saturday afternoon after seeing how packed Sweet Tomatoes was. Applebees wasnt too busy and the nice hostess actually opened the door for us. We were quickly seated at a booth by the window. We had Brandon as our server and he was excellent! He had a nice attitude, didnt rush us to order, didnt check on us too much (I hate when waiters do that), and never left us with an empty glass.  I got the shrimp and parmesan top sirloin steak with steamed broccoli and garlic green beans. It was sooo good! The steak was tender and cooked the way I wanted (medium). My husband got the ee brisket tacos and fries which he said was delicious, and my daughter had the mac n cheese which she enjoyed as well. We ordered the artichoke dip for an appetizer, which was pretty standard but good, and we skipped dessert. Not sure what people expect from a chain restaurant."
Janet M.,"Portland, OR",294,901,2974,2.0,6/11/2016,"Yeah. My bad.  So I was tired, sick of people,  and had been suffering with ongoing horrendous back pain when my child texted ""I want salmon""....not cooking. NFW.  Hmm what to do. I mean she doesnt always get what she wants but I figured it was doable, so why not? I really knew better.  I thought I'd try their ""curbside to go.""Fish options, no real human interactions, and I could stay in the car. Awesome, right?  I ordered online and headed over. They told me it'd be ready in ten. It was closer to 20.  The kid was nice and friendly. The food was dispatched quickly. It was still hot when I got it home ten minutes later.  But my $4 side salad was missing. We both had meals and salads so I had looked and observed four containers, two small and two large, and I thought it was cool. But my baked potato was in the fourth box not the MIA salad.  Sigh.  My bbq ribs were ok. Small. But lean and tender. Baked potato was fine. ""Fire roasted veggies"" just were not great. Two enormous chunks of squash and a few squares of red bell pepper.   Child's salmon was overcooked and not seasoned. She ate a bite or two, offered some to the cat ( he sniffed and walked away) and we trashed the rest. She did not like the ""rubbery"" broccoli. Garlic mashed taters with cheese were pronounced ""edible."" Her side Caesar is still in the fridge two days later. The romaine was dark and wilty. Not appealing.  It was all VERRRRRRRY salty. Like wake -up -in- the' night -parched- like -youre -in -the- desert, salty.  So. Kind of a bust.  Chains. I really shouldn't try them. Another yelper said drinking would help.  So, maybe try that? If I have the urge to do curbside lazy chain takeout again Ill do that ""Chinese"" place. It's salty too, but at least my order all makes it into the bag.  And as Princess pointed out, we actually LIKE that."
Felicia N.,"Belltown, Seattle, WA",86,145,227,2.0,7/13/2016,"Went out for dinner with the family on a Tuesday night here, which is kid's night woohoo! My little brothers ate off the kids menu for less than $2 each. One of them ordered the grilled cheese and barely touched it. He loves grilled cheeses but there was something off about this one... Dad and I did the 2 for $25 deal that comes with an appetizer to share and two entrees. I ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp and dad got the Baby Back Ribs in Chipotle sauce with grilled veggies and garlic green beans on the side. We got the spinach and artichoke dip for our appetizer and were disappointed. We liked the salsa that came out with the chips better than the dip itself, hah.  The Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp was WAY TOO GREASY. It came with a pat of herb butter on the chicken that I removed immediately, but the entire dish was drenched in oil still. The sauteed onions and mushrooms were overcooked on the sizzling pan and were lost to the grease. The portion size was great, the shrimp was cooked well, but the chicken was a little dry (maybe that's what all the grease is for...). The dish came with a side of fried potatoes. Yay, more grease. Can you tell that the excessive fat ruined the dish for me? Dad's dish was delicious. The meat fell off the bones of the ribs and the grilled veggies were clean and fresh. The garlic green beans were greasy also, but mixed with the grilled veggies it wasn't too bad. Overall, good bang for your buck but beware of the fat content in the food that you're getting."
Lora R.,"Phoenix, AZ",34,69,22,1.0,9/29/2017,"Visiting from Arizona. Came here with my mom, Aunt, daughter & daughter's friend. Sever asked if we wanted seperate checks, my daughter said that her and friend were on same check & I said the remaining 3 would be on the other check. (This will be important towards the end of this post.) On to the food. My Aunt just wanted a salad & baked potatoe, loaded. Server explains that its $2 upcharge to have it loaded - Aunt says ok but asks if loaded meant bacon, sour cream, cheese & chives to which server replied ""yes"". Mom orders ""butcher meat & potatoes"" entree which is supposed to have mashed potatoes but she requests a loaded baked potatoe instead, knowing the same $2 upcharge will apply (we didn't know until we got the check that they also charge ANOTHER $2 to sub the bake for the mash). These baked potatoes were poorly ""loaded"" (and didn't have chives) & were cold. Mom's butcher meat was however plentifully loaded with gristle. I ordered the burbon chicken & shrimp which was way overcooked & chicken was inedible - at that point I asked for something else (Lemon pepper chicken mac m cheese - was mediocre at best - the dog didn't even like it - however she did like the butcher meat). So we basically had expensive dog food with awful service. She didn't even check back at appropriate intervals to make sure everything was ok. I had to get up & go to the bar to request condiment. The girl brings the checks (we're supposed to have 2). My daughter is paying for her & friend & I'm paying for the rest of us as we stated when she asked in the first place. We pay cash because the way she's explaining to how to pay with cards sounds like we need a tech degree on their table machine. I'm sure its not that serious but she was a mess explaining. So while we're getting our cash together the server is standing there hovering over us like we're trying to dine n dash or something. I was kind of stuck where I was seated, but as I was able to get out I dropped the cash on the table in front of her & she gave me a snide ""thaaaaaannnnnks"".  Then our little group is standing outside chatting before parting ways & out comes our server in a very accusatory manner saying that we didn't pay for one of the guests & was very rude about it. Finally (to make a long story short) it gets figured out that she split the check 3 ways instead of 2. The friend didn't notice & neither did the rest of us because we were only thinking about 2 checks! So the friend pays her for the missing meal, but wow this girl was so unprofessional. Definitely won't be back."
Tabatha P.,"Hillsboro, OR",718,257,464,2.0,3/22/2017,"I decided to give it a try, since we had seemed to try everything else in the area. Their service was awesome, I really enjoy how we were treated there. From the door to exiting, just top notch customer service.  My compliant is the food choices. There was hardly anything I could eat or was interested in eating. I have high lactose intolerance, and my food without cheese was extremely limited and extremly bland. Many choices were fried, fattening, high calorie, and all around bad for you.  The place had TVs everywhere, which I understand people like their sports, but there were too many and it was overwhelming. Then with the screens on the tables and people on cells phones, just too much!  We probably won't be back."
Shanae B.,"Portland, OR",22,80,31,2.0,1/13/2017,"I'm bringing my rating up a little bit but this location has still not impressed me much.  The food was good, nice and hot and we were checked on about half a dozen times which actually was a little annoying but not terribly off-putting (and was the exact opposite of my last experience).  What irritated me today was that my brother was brought a drink that he didn't order but the waitress said it was an extra and not to worry about it. Ok, cool.  Then, because it was my brothers birthday, he got what was supposed to be a free desert which we requested in a to-go container so he could eat it later.  Then we got the bill and found out that the waitress charged us for the drink and for the free Birthday dessert because we requested it to-go.  The argument was not worth the $5 savings.  It probably goes without saying but my $10 tip on a $35 bill was reduced to a $5 tip."
Alexander S.,"West Linn, OR",15,28,11,5.0,10/8/2017,love the dollar margarita and veggie burger new favorite . Best service and very quick service very nice employees
Rohit M.,"Portland, OR",0,5,,4.0,7/24/2017,"We were hungry on Sunday, and came here. It was on Sunday and most restaurants were closed early so we were happy apple bees was still open. Even though it was late, the staff was pleasant and attentive. Food was good but it was lit the same like in the pictures lol Over all a great place to get a late bite!"
Jason F.,"San Francisco, CA",18,236,17,2.0,4/25/2016,"Simply dreadful.   The bourbon chicken and shrimp can only be described as strange.  The weird butter (?) sauce on it tasted like someone grabbed whatever herbs were sitting around and threw them together.  The shrimp was overly chewy and tasted a bit off.  The potatoes were undercooked and flavorless. I also made the mistake of ordering their steak, which borders on inedible.  Tough, fatty, and overcooked. They do have decent (albeit weak) drinks though and the staff is nice. It's Applebee's so I suppose I shouldn't be expecting much.  The name is pretty much synonymous with bad to mediocre food."
Justin H.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,4,,1.0,7/28/2017,"Do not sit in NATE's section. I accidentally left my sunglasses in his section and called immediately to make sure he found them. He did and ensured me I could pick them up within the next couple days. Described the make model etc.  Couple days later and they are nowhere to be found and with no accountability from the management team there. Really disappointed and will be taking my business elsewhere.  They have unreliable, dishonest staff. Not to mention broken procedures."
Morgan H.,"Beaverton, OR",0,1,,1.0,9/30/2017,"I ordered a steak medium rare and it was completely purple on the inside and when the waiter brought it back after re cooking it, It wasn't even chewable at that point. Would not recommend"
Lauren M.,"Hillsboro, OR",52,8,,3.0,4/5/2017,"The last time I came in was about three weeks ago with my boyfriend. At first our waiter was fantastic; very enthusiastic and pleasant.  The food was what I expected. However, I didn't expect to wait such a long time. Waiter came back and apologized, saying he forgot to enter in our meals. We accepted and waited a few more minutes and then he brought out our food. Long story short, he didn't give us any kind of a discount or void for the extra wait due to his mistake.  We were disappointed."
Jitin J.,"Seattle, WA",21,14,,1.0,7/4/2016,Mozzarella sticks were cold. My drink (Bahama mama) had too much sweet syrup and chicken grill had a burnt taste. Only Mac and cheese was decent. Need I say more :/
Bill V.,"Portland, OR",0,18,,1.0,2/14/2017,"The weird thing about Applebee's run-of-the-mill menu is: it is so run-of-the-mill, I can never figure out what to order. Perplexing. Haven't been back in years. Wouldn't go back if they gave me a $100 gift certificate. I would never be able to figure out how to spend it."
Nick E.,"Beaverton, OR",0,18,10,5.0,1/1/2017,"Love the happy hour here,. Great shot prices on a couple drinks...awesome 1/2 appetizers,  never packed..you can usually get a sest right at the bar, which is nice ..its clean..and a solid xhoice for happy hour-ers..."
Matt L.,"Beaverton, OR",1,37,2,1.0,6/11/2016,Saw your waitress like once. Food was horrible. They didn't even seem to try. Won't return.
Jennifer A.,"North Plains, OR",44,3,,1.0,1/19/2017,Went for lunch with my mom and the food was awful. Greasy as heck. And drenched in to much sauce. Will not return. They definitely need a new cook
Sabrina M.,"Aloha, OR",31,3,4,1.0,12/10/2016,Horrible service! Super small portions! It shouldn't take an hour and a half to get dinner
Terry B.,"Beaverton, OR",38,1,,1.0,12/10/2016,Just left without tipping the service was slow the food was marginal and the drinks were weak and way too expensive.  Don't waste your time here eating dinner shouldn't be this painful
Khoa N.,"Beaverton, OR",162,18,15,3.0,6/8/2015,"We were a party of 5 that had wanted to go out for happy hour to which one of our friends got there first and saved us all a seat in one of those half circle booth. The seating was a little awkward where it made the people on the ends feel isolated, i got a beer and my friend got a margarita that was recommended by the waitress who acted like she had a few margaritas herself which made the experience a little uncomfortable at times. We all got a full sized meals despite of our original plan to have happy hour items. My friend ordered riblets which came out a little burnt to which he got a whole new plate of ribs that were made well. They implicated a new ordering system using tablets but i would recommend not using it because it takes away the personal experience you get with your waiter and makes it seem robotic. TL:DR new renovations are weird and waitress was drunk"
Betty C.,"Hillsboro, OR",39,274,71,2.0,1/10/2015,"So we came in for the new healthy menu.  Well it's low call but not healthy.  The veggies are overcooked...and I ordered my meat NOT charred to a cinder --in fact, blue rare, and it came very well done.   When I insisted on no french fries and asked for fruit instead or a veggie OTHER than broccoli (why do restaurants not have green beans anymore?  O even asparagus?) that was declined, but I COULD order slaw (high calorie mayo anyone?) or any number of other things that would negate healthy.  Tomatoes though are impossible to get I guess.   The waiter must have asked me about a thousand times was I SURE I didn't want slaw.  No, clearly I am an idiot and the first time I told you ""No"" I was just kidding."
Deja A.,"Beaverton, OR",12,189,506,4.0,9/9/2013,"I come here often. The waiters are over all pretty good. They have bingo nights, live music etc. The happy hour is pretty awesome. Love the 2 for $20 deal. Nice date night place!! I'm addicted to their sirloin steak w/ mash potatoes, loaded and vegetables. For an  appetizer the boneless bbq wings are awesome. They have a  great happy hour menu.. yummy margaritas for only $3.50 They have a new little system. Its sort of an ipad looking thing thats on each table. You can order appetizers or desserts from it also ask for refills threw it. It also offers games but you have to pay for them. Cool electronic thing!!"
Lindsay H.,"Beaverton, OR",0,61,33,3.0,7/12/2014,"Where to start.. I'll just dive in! Pros:  -Our server Michaela was nice. Not overly friendly, but provided great service, and cracked a smile or two throughout the night. We thought she was great. -The food* totally edible-- I'll dive in more in the cons... -wait time was probably about 5-10 minutes on a Thursday at dinner time, totally reasonable. -food arrived pretty fast after ordering, drinks were refilled when we wanted and plates cleared up not too long after finishing-- all great stuff! Cons: - the waiting area seats like 5 people maybe... And the couple sittings in the corner had family come in and all try to squeeze in.... Making it super awkward for us the couple standing because theirs no seats, and the other couple seated. Too close for comfort. -The table we sat at was clean, but the hairs had food on them. -the food pt II: I ordered medium on my steak, got well done-- definitely not a deal breaker cause it was still pretty good, BUT the menu and the real deal were night and day. Do not expect to get that beautiful meal in the menu. The manager called to follow up with me and I've been unable to reach her back just yet, but I appreciate they take my small complaints seriously. I'd definitely go back, I think they are a nice little restaurant with some good people that work there :)"
Tommy D.,"Portland, OR",0,9,5,3.0,11/5/2015,Our lunch special came with Frys that tasted like they were stale off of a hot table. My ribletts were Luke warm.  Service I give 5 stars.. Amber did outstanding.  I don't eat the west side of town much but not real impressed.
Audre W.,"Beaverton, OR",45,15,2,1.0,5/11/2015,"Nice host,   our waitress could put a little more effort in pronouncing the foreign dishes correctly but not big problem,  just preference but could have checked the glasses before handing me water with lettuce stuck to it.  I should have checked the both seat before putting my purse next to me on sticky surface and crumbs of some sort. The booth cloth was strained and has not been washed from looks of it.  The dish I would have liked at least clean sides of plate,  got sauce all over the sides not presentable for me.... meat was rubbery and food was alright. Feeling uneasy. .... should have gone to red robins. .."
Pinky J.,"Portland, OR",0,2,,4.0,11/27/2015,"Came in pretty late the day after Thanksgiving because not much else was open and we wanted to get out of the house. Was not busy at all, so service was quick.  Had a great burger and was pleased to find now have veggie burgers on the menu which has changed since the last time I was at an Applebees. Fries were nice and crispy the way I like. Also had mozzarella sticks which were nice and hot.  Server was nice, and the music on the speakers was a change from the ordinary."
Ethan B.,"Portland, OR",39,129,30,2.0,5/20/2015,"Decent food, good for the price. Very salty and when there's sugar there's a LOT, so be aware of that. I got a two for $9 lunch, excellent bargain. Bar is relatively well stocked. Wait staff are very talkative which isn't my cup of tea but if you're more social it may be a good fit."
Megan L.,"Camas, WA",191,279,46,3.0,12/10/2014,After finals my friends and i decided to chow down at this restaurant. We were sat quickly and the hostess was friendly. She explained how we could order off the tablet at the end of the table for appetizers and desserts.  The food here wasn't anything special but it tasted good. We mainly used the tablet for ordering and paying that was super easy.
Jen C.,"Forest Grove, OR",0,46,,2.0,10/2/2016,I usually get appetizers (won ton tacos and steak quesadillas) when I eat here but tried the brew pub philly last night and was terribly disappointed with my choice! It was very salty and soggy and lacked peppers or onions. My fries were cold and tasteless. Definitely a different quality from the apps I usually order. Won't make that mistake again.
Scott P.,"Beaverton, OR",24,29,1,2.0,5/30/2016,Overrated no doubt. Was expecting  better service and food thought I was at burgerville across the street. Guess I should of went there.
Charlie L.,"Seattle, WA",119,686,97,5.0,11/3/2013,"Wow. This is my Applebee story, and after reading this, you will also say ""wow."" I went here for a late night bite on a Tuesday. I just got cash for the first time in ages (more than a day's wages) in preparation for a trip. Somehow I dropped the entire wade in the restaurant and didn't notice.  On Wednesday, I was in a panic looking for it... the only place that it could be was Applebees. Ok, cash left at a restaurant... there's no hope of it being recovered. I called the restaurant. Renee, the manager on duty said no one had turned it, but she took down my name and number... and told me she would track down the night manager to verify.  Five hours later I get a call from her... our server Andrew had found it (glad I gave him a 20% tip)!! I couldn't believe it. When I called back the night manager Eddie, tells me that it's in an envelope with my name on it and the date I'm returning.  I went in today and Eddie handed me the cash. Couldn't stop thanking him and the staff that made the return possible. Thanks Applebee, you guys rock my world."
Tasha H.,"Portland, OR",130,251,343,3.0,1/4/2015,Its not what it use to be!!! What happened the food use to taste so much better! or maybe my taste buds have been spoiled. either way its not a go to place for a quick get together any longer. I dont know what else to say. The staff is friendly. But it seems there is less interaction with server now they have the electronic ordering at the table.
Edward T.,"Russian Hill, San Francisco, CA",23,20,15,2.0,12/28/2014,I didn't really expect much but gave it a chance.  I wouldn't come here at all since I heard the service in San Francisco was horrible.  Here the food is either overseasoned or underseasoned would love to meet who made my food and ask him/her what's the hell she's doing. I also asked them that I wanted a 9oz but gave me a 7oz and didn't even bother cause I didn't want more overseasoned meat. I was literally eating meat that's been picked up from the ocean.  That's what I said I didn't expect much anyways. The only thing that was decent was the cheese stick an appetizer.
Ryan M.,"Hillsboro, OR",21,5,1,1.0,7/31/2015,"The Goodish: The service was received was okay. The Bad: For not being busy it took about 20 minutes to receive appetizers, no small plates or silverware came with the appetizers, the small plate that were finally brought were very dirty and still had some sort of sauce of them, my steak which was requested to be very rare, came out medium rare, the two sides of vegetables that were ordered with my steak were literally dripping with butter, so much that the small greens of the broccoli had a film and there were no gaps because of the death by butter drowning it received.  After taking a few bites of the of the veggies, I notified the server, who's response was ""Hmm the veggies?"" All I wanted was a decent meal, apparently not to be found at Applebee's."
