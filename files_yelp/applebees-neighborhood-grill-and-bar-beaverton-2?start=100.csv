Jamie H.,"Beaverton, OR",9,82,14,2.0,9/1/2011,"Definitely not very impressed with this Applebees. The appetizer was pretty good but my dinner salad was not. I ordered the Chicken Caesar salad. It's a pretty straight forward dish but they somehow managed to make it bad. The greens were warm, the Caesar dressing was very watery and the chicken was bland. I only ate about a quarter of it. Luckily, they didn't charge me for it."
Ernest W.,"Lake Oswego, OR",77,8,16,3.0,5/2/2011,Average food. Portions were not nearly equivalent to the menu pictures. Waitress Alexandria did a solid job.
Heather S.,"Hillsboro, OR",1,3,1,4.0,11/30/2011,We usually come for the 2 for $20 deal. We've never had bad service in all our trips here. I'm glad they've added wifi.
Brynn M.,"Bakersfield, CA",33,142,15,3.0,2/6/2010,"This Applebee's is just like any other. Food is ""eh."" Service is ""eh."" Drinks are ""eh."" But it's open late. And when you get off work at 10pm, its hard to find a place to go and get something to eat. So when I got off work Thursday night and needed something to eat, we went to the only place better than Shari's that was open. So when we first got in, we were seated by the bar area where a table full of drunk guys were yelling at the Washington/Arizona bball game that was on tv. I couldn't even hear myself think. So we asked to be moved. The waitress was very nice and moved us right away. Food was ok. Nothing memorable. Chicken strips were probably the same ones you can get out of the box at the supermarket. But they were hot and I was hungry, so no complaints. Husband really enjoyed his burning love burger (I think that's what it was called). So not my favorite place, but I'll go back the next time I'm working late and need something to eat. What other options do I have?"
Adriana R.,"Hillsboro, OR",1,46,7,1.0,1/27/2013,"All I have to say is: Disgusting food. I decided to give it a second chance and decided I will never come back here again. Food is very bland, tastes like it was out of the microwave."
Phillip B.,"Portland, OR",8,17,5,1.0,10/3/2006,"Can I give 1/2 a star?  I've been disappointed by Applebees 4 out of 4 visits, but only one of those visits made me sick. Just one fantastic example of the experiences I have had at Applebees: First attempt to order a Bombay Sapphire and Tonic on my most recent visit: ME: Could I get a Sapphire and tonic? Clueless Waitress (CW): Ok  . . . CW Goes to talk to the Clueless Bartender and then returns to the table . . . CW: What's in that? ME: Bombay Sapphire and Tonic.  Oh, and Lime. CW: OK  . . . CW Goes to talk to the Clueless Bartender and then returns to the table . . . CW: Here you go. Have you decided what you'ld like to eat yet? ME: Not yet.  Could I get a lime with this? Ok, not so bad at this point, and you might think I'm picking on her - so here's me trying to order a second Gin and Tonic from THE SAME WAITRESS AND THE SAME BARTENDER!!!! CW: How is everything? ME: It's ok.  Could I get another one of these? CW: What was it again? ME: Sapphire and Tonic CW: Ok, I'll be right back.  . . . The clueless waitress came back with a rocks glass full of clear liquid.  I assumed (silly me) that it was gin and tonic with no ice and no lime. ME: Could I get some ice and a lime with this? CW: Sure; be right back.   . . . Ok, this time it was still in a rocks glass, but at least it had ice and a lime..... I took a big sip and literally did a Hollywood style spit-take.  I then politely asked the CW if she wouldn't mind taking the drink back to the bar again and see if they could add some tonic water to the GLASS OF STRAIGHT GIN they had given me. Oh, and the food sucked."
Catie L.,"Portland, OR",115,200,226,3.0,6/4/2007,"It's Applebee's...yes....but one of my late-nite places to find reasonable prices on some appetizers; namely their boneless buffalo wings.  Delish. The service is decent, and I have had good success going in groups of about 6-8."
chelley L.,"San Jose, CA",22,184,67,1.0,1/27/2007,"was it because we had a group of 12?  did they purposely seat us in the lonely corner with no other customers around?  We came here on a night were it wasn't even that busy...  and here's the proof:  everytime i looked around for the waiter, he'd be standing at the bar area talking to some chicks.  i'm silly enough to raise my hand  like a student and still the horny guy did not get my attention.  we called other waiters/waitresses for our waiter just to get him over to our table.   took forever for him to take drink order.  took even longer to take our food order.  if i know exactly what i want, i want to order it right then and there, or else i start looking through the menu again and continuously change my mind... and i believe i changed my mind about 3 times then decided i'm sharing with the bf.  no need to add more to the bill so the waiter would get more tip (gratuity).  yeah i'm an @$$ like that, so what! food arrived cold.  i shared fajitas with the bf but didn't even recieve any tortillas with the meal.  15 minutes later the tortillas are cold and the fajitas are even colder.  GGRRR. the guy  didn't pay much attention to us (he was busy thinking with the other head i suppose). i hate this place!"
Steven J.,"Beaverton, OR",40,20,3,4.0,2/26/2012,"I'm quite honestly surprised to see the rating so low.  They have quick and cheap food that has good flavor.  The atmosphere is perfect for our baby who enjoys to look at all of the colored lights.  The service has always been friendly and multiple managers have come by to say hello.  They have even remembered our names!  Sure, it's isn't a ""foo foo"" restaurant but great for a quick bite to eat.  They recently added a Bourbon and Blue Cheese Burger that is to die for.  If you like grilled onions, check it out while it lasts!"
Katie W.,"Everett, WA",200,226,41,3.0,10/8/2008,"Ok, there has been much improvement the last few times I've been there. I wonder if they had a chat with their employees? But that last couple times I've been, I've actually gotten refills, the food has been better (and I loooove the combo thing that comes with a meal and sides and dessert!), and the servers don't always look like they hate life."
Kevin J.,"Portland, OR",4,14,,1.0,10/8/2008,"It doesn't matter which Applebees you eat at. They are all carbon copy corporate structures filled with kitchsy junk and crappy food. I think the best thing I ever ate once (you know, before I gained the knowledge to know that SYSCO food isn't the pinaccle of a dinning experience!) was a chicken salad. Then again, that was years ago...it's sort of like a virgin's first time; anything is tasty, but give em someting to behold and they never go back!"
Jake J.,"Beaverton, OR",0,39,,1.0,5/13/2012,"Dragged here against my will by colleagues, I ordered a small plate of bacon cheeseburger sliders.   Can't go wrong, right?  Wrong!  Flavorless patties and greasy tasteless bacon on soggy mini-buns.  Even the friendly service and attractive price point can't make up for a truly awful cheeseburger experience.  Sorry Applebee's - I'll be enjoying my burgers elsewhere from now on."
Gil K.,"Torrance, CA",37,439,26,2.0,9/10/2010,"Service really kills it for me, but I used to go here as a poor high school student so I guess they won't pay much attention to you at that age. It was the go-to place after church gatherings because we didn't have to drink and they have cheap food for happy hour. Must have gone here over 10 times. Food is franchise goop, but service was really want turned me off. Avoid and go to Sharis!"
