Bersheba H.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,8,,4.0,10/16/2016,Thai Shrimp salad to die for. Andrea was our server and she was fabulous. Would give 5 stars but the bartender needs some work.
Chad D.,"Hillsboro, OR",8,51,,4.0,10/21/2015,"So much better than I'd imagined.  I'd resisted Applebee's because I assumed it was putting out the typical dreck associated with big chains.  Went with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  Triple Bacon Burger was perfectly cooked and wonderfully flavorful, despite having very few (if any) condiments.  Monday special was $6.99 and included unlimited and very good fries.  That's an unbeatable value.  Compares very favorably with the hip-but-mediocre Helvetia Tavern."
Ethan K.,"Camas, WA",0,4,,3.0,3/26/2016,"Now This is a place that's been a little overrated for the past a couple years and I want to address that it's not a bad place but also not a great one.  The marketing they put out is something that they shove in your face and try to make you like it and that's one problem.  The staff is something that's okay but you can find way better.  The food itself isn't amazing but it's actually pretty good until you realize it until you get the bill and also realize it's overpriced and you leave spending 30 dollars on a couple meals.  Sometimes the food is good and most of the time it's bad.  Food can be overcooked and sometimes it can be just awful it's like a radiation inside of a patty but then you leave and just forget about it.  And for all those problems I listed i'm giving Applebee's a 3 out of 5, have a good day.                                      Recap Problematic staff okay food overpriced"
Kit P.,"Beaverton, OR",17,15,,4.0,2/17/2015,"I don't expect much from chain restaurants. The food is always going to taste the same. Sometimes they'll hit a sweet spot with a dish and it'll make it worth the trip. It's pretty standard for places like this.  The staff at this location makes it good. I can come here knowing everyone will be able to get what they want and pay a fair price. We'll also get a smile, attentive service, and refilled drinks. Everyone is basically guaranteed to be taken care of and satisfied."
Mike J.,"Beaverton, OR",1,2,4,4.0,11/11/2015,"Just a note to say  Thank you for a wonderful meal, cooked to perfection. Wonderful reception and great service From a grateful Veteran."
J S.,"Hillsboro, OR",17,11,2,3.0,3/8/2017,"I have been to this location a few times over the last 6 months or so. Service has been ok each time. This last time though is what lowered my rating. It was happy hour and not very busy, we were seated right away. the waiter was just standing looking bored by the computer when we were seated. He waited about 5 mins to come over and take our drink order for us. He checked back a few mins later to take our order an seemed rushed and impatient for us to make up our minds on what we wanted. It was happy hour and he did not point out the happy hour menu until after we ordered drinks, which may have changed our drink order than for something cheaper. Usually when I go at happy hour they come over to introduce themselves and than would remind about happy hour and the menu that pointed out which items were cheaper. Overall, I like the food here especially the appetizers but the service could use some work."
Kimberly M.,"Hillsboro, OR",3,25,,5.0,1/30/2015,"When you come home from work, look at your loving family knowing you don't want to cook for them today... This is the place to go. Just drive up, get the car side to go them go home and enjoy your wine. It's fast, cooked correctly and yummy. There are a lot of options on 185th, many of them come with bugs. Applebee's has no bugs, no a$$holes, just good food and nice people.  Eat your dinner and relax"
Megan R.,"Hillsboro, OR",9,21,7,3.0,7/10/2014,"Food is okay, but what's really cool is their new ordering system! It's an ipad type device on every table where you can order appetizers and desserts. You can pay for your food too. No waiting for the server to give you a check. No being held hostage at your table when you want to leave. It's amazing. Every restaurant needs to get this!! It would be great if the whole menu was like that."
Buddy B.,"Hillsboro, OR",8,48,108,5.0,5/15/2015,"Kyle stepped up as a great server and prompted me to finally write a review. Great service, very attentive without being obtrusive. Love the garlic shrimp on the steak. Whoever hired Kyle; you hit the mark all staff should strive for."
Kay K.,"Honolulu, HI",70,14,133,4.0,9/22/2013,"The Honey Pepper Sirloin, cooked medium and served with potato and onion, was so delicious. Good service and good food at a decent price.  We started with Boneless Buffalo Wings and ended with Triple Chocolate Meltdown."
Tiffany M.,"Portland, OR",101,258,14,4.0,1/15/2013,"I'm not a huge Applebee's fan, especially when there are so many other places in the area that have better quality food. That being said, we went with family and I appreciated that they had a nice variety of lower calorie options. I got one of the 550 calories or less shrimp dishes, and while the shrimp was just ok the rest of the dish was pretty flavorful.  This review would have been two or three stars had it not been for one thing: best. server. ever. Her name is Michaela, and she was super awesome. When I go to a restaurant I expect someone knowledgable and with personality, and Michaela had both in spades. She was very...chill I guess is the right adjective, but not so much so that it seemed like she didn't give a you-know-what. It was more just her feeling comfortable enough to be herself and joke around, and she was an incredibly attentive server towards all of the tables in her section. We told the manager how awesome she was on the way out, as I used to appreciate that as a server. Although let me clarify, we didn't pull the ol' verbal tip (compliment the server to their boss and think that means it's ok to leave a crappy tip) and neither should you. EVER."
Sean A.,"Portland, OR",58,155,61,4.0,7/20/2014,"For a chain this place tends to be on point with both service and quality.  This visit was a tad off.  Apps came out, followed by our meal within 2 minutes. Kind of a carnal sin.  Table orders apps, and you also take their meal order, NEVER put them all in at once.   That being said, food was good, and not the original stuff sent out (good call on someone's part).  Service was prompt.  They also have a trial run of a table side tablet which you can play games on, call your server (lord help them) order your own apps and desserts and even pay on.  We didn't give it a go this time as it was still new and didn't think we needed to complicate the evening.  But we like it here.  Worth going to when no one can decide on a place lol"
Chiemi N.,"Cornelius, OR",126,301,351,3.0,3/22/2012,"The decision to go to Applebee's late on a Wednesday evening was probably one of the worst decisions that I've made so far in 2012.  It was pouring down snow, which should have made me question my sanity in driving at 11pm to meet up with friends.  But I was bored and realized that I hadn't eaten since lunchtime. I've eaten at Applebee's many times over the years.  There hasn't been anything memorable...nothing really good, nothing really bad.  Just so-so.  When counting calories, I did appreciate the Weight Watchers menu items.  There was a veggie pizza thing that wasn't on the menu, but had heard about from a friend.  It was quite good. Anyways, on this particular evening, I ordered the spinach artichoke dip.  Out of all the places that I've had spinach artichoke dip, this one has to be the most bland tasting dip.  I was hungry, so ate almost all of it.  I never did get a refill on my iced tea.  I didn't get to the restaurant until 11:30pm, and the restaurant started closing at midnight.  Next time, given the option to go to Applebee's or stay home, I should play it safe and stay home!"
Amanda B.,"Hillsboro, OR",35,64,1,2.0,3/16/2014,"This place has always been ok- not spectacular, which is why I only gave it 3 stars before. While I appreciate the 550 calorie menu options nothing else really makes this place stand out.  I'm updating my review to 2 stars because I came here the other night with my boyfriend and got food poisoning. I don't know if it was the bloody steak (which I had ordered medium well) or the lemon in my water which I had NOT requested lemons in my water having heard horror stories about them being dirty.  So while I was sick as a dog that night I won't completely take it out on them and only give them 1 star- I will give them 2 and take some responsibility and say I should have just sent the steak and water back instead of risking it. But I hate being that person. Guess I paid the price for that one!"
Natalee A.,"Portland, OR",11,17,4,5.0,3/5/2015,"After working in a similar setting for many years, it's great to experience happy vibes when coming into a corporate restaurant such as this!!! The bartender Topher was all smiles and did a great job! High five!"
Marilyn M.,"Beaverton, OR",12,36,78,4.0,10/6/2015,"Greeted promptly.  Seated immediately.  Orders taken quickly.  Excellent service.  Efficient staff.  The chicken tortilla soup was slightly spicy for my taste buds, but delicious.  The grilled lemon chicken topped with diced zucchini over rice with cranberries is now my favorite entree.  My husband's steak was perfect.  I would very much like to see sorbet or Breyer's dairy free ice cream added to the dessert menu.  My husband also felt that the dessert menu was somewhat limited.  My rating is based on service, appetizer, entree & alcoholic drink selection & quality of food.  We will definitely return to this Applebee's! Restaurant."

Cindy S.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,1,,1.0,5/30/2016,"This was probably the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant, in my life. I ordered a drink and an appetizer. I stressed that I wanted the appetizer and eat it before I get my actual dinner. The waiter said ok and about 20-30 minutes later I got my appetizer, and not 10 seconds later my dinner arrived. I ordered a 7 ounce sirloin medium rare and fries. To my surprise, the steak was flavorless and extremely hard to cut into and hurt my jaw when I chewed. I had it taken back and asked for another one to be made, and it was just as bad if not edible for anyone to eat. The fries were also really stale. The appetizer was spinach artichoke dip which was lumpy, burned, and had no flavor. This dinner was not worth the huge bill. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone anymore."
Rebecca W.,"San Diego, CA",20,249,42,3.0,2/15/2014,"So what to say that hasn't already been said? Well, I will say that our bartender was great! Not too in your face, he didn't screw up anything, he was fast, attentive, pleasant, the man was in the game!  The food: well, aside from the fact that they look nothing like the beautiful images in the menu, they were decent. My complaint would be that the menu did not show over-cooked limp veggies overly sauced in some juice of unknown origin. Nor did the photos reflecting skimping on the squash. It tasted good, so I can't complain too much. My fear though is that the calorie counts provided are not accurate when too much sauce is placed on the dish. Not sure if they are following the recipe to the ""T"" there. The noise level wasn't too bad and every table was taken. Music was good. Deserts looked divine. I wish I could have partaken in one of those.  All in all, a good dinner out. Honestly if a little extra effort went into the food prep and presentation Applebee's would have earned 4 stars tonight, 5 stars if based on the bartenders service alone."
Suyash K.,"Beaverton, OR",41,13,14,4.0,12/6/2014,Pretty nice place to enjoy the evening... If you are a heavy drinker.. You may find it a bit towards the costlier side.. Food service is slow when it's crowded.. But the wait is all worth of. Drinks will be served promptly by the very friendly staff.. Must try boneless wings with barbecue sauce along with long Island Ice Tea...
