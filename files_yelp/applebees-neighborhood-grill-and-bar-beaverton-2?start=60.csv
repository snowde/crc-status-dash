Allison R.,"Portland, OR",259,251,97,2.0,9/24/2013,"BLEH. Never again. Applebee's used to be so good! I grew up in a small town in Cali and this was one of the only good resturaunt's to eat at. Or maybe its because I was a little tween and didnt know any better. HA!  Does anyone remember the ""onion peels""? yum. Anyway, Applebee's sucks now. Straight up. I feel kinda bitchy writing this review, sorry for that. This location was fine, our waiter in particular was not so great but everyone was friendly, our food came out decent and we had no real issues. But the food was not ANYTHING to come back for."
Jason W.,"Lexington, KY",41,14,4,1.0,3/17/2015,I don't expect much from Applebee's but the service was terrible. Everything took longer than reasonable. Simple things li j e bringing water to the table had to be asked for. Our server was more concerned about his cell phone. The only positive thing was a person not our server named Nate.
Leia C.,"Beaverton, OR",42,43,76,4.0,2/22/2015,"Average food and drink, however is a nice place, and never crowded. Try to nachos for happy hour, good price and tasty."
April V.,"Beaverton, OR",50,29,24,2.0,11/23/2014,"If it wasn't for their chicken wonton tacos i probably wouldn't come here. Everytime that i HAVE come to eat here the service was horrible and the drinks tasted like bartender just threw together what he thought makes a drink. They have the thing on table where you can order your food now, which I'm going to assume it's because they know their service sucks and instead of working on customer service, spend it on some table gadget to avoid any social interaction. Our server seemed irritated that we ordered thru the table menu...you know...because waiting 15 minutes for her wasn't long enough. Then got rude and short with my friend's autistic son who had questions about a meal. Yea, good wonton tacos or not, this location...I'm done with the 2 stars are for the wonton tacos."
Maya M.,"Portland, OR",0,6,2,5.0,3/16/2016,Applebees is a very smoothly running buissness and great survece I ordered the chicken tenders and fries it was well cooked and every time my drink was about to run out the waitor got me a new drink right away and I didn't even have to ask I think everybody would love applebees.
Genna C.,"Beaverton, OR",49,266,,2.0,1/4/2011,"1/2 price appetizers during Happy Hour: !!!! Quality of said appetizers: !! Service: !! Almost 6 goddamn dollars for a metered well drink: WTF? Look, I know my way around a dive bar, specializing in those of the hinterlands / western suburbs. I've been spoiled by spots that serve up a strong pour in the neighborhood of $3.00 (one, this is the universe's compensation for suburban relegation, and two, see what I did there with ""in the neighborhood?"" Shaddup.) So, I get that I am used to cheap and strong drinks. Therefore $6 for a weakass well drink does not follow. Oh, and I have the choice of gazing upon either mass-produced faux-morobilia or lovely, scenic 185th Avenue while drinking it? PASS."
Pragya S.,"Hillsboro, OR",6,11,2,5.0,2/10/2014,Loved my first experience! I went with my friends .. very friendly staff.  Food is really good and not too pricey.  I loved the strawberry lemonade.My friend is a huge fan of mango lemonade.  My friends took a sip from my strawberry lemonade and they wanted to order one each for themselves.. and they were not charged for it :) the waitress was happy and she said its on her.. i would recommend this place for sure!
Jesy B.,"Portland, OR",168,572,29,2.0,12/27/2010,"If you want to be ""eating good in the neighborhood"" set your sights elsewhere.  I haven't been to one of these for awhile. But there was a giftcard involved in this visit and it was a ""eh, why not try it?"" decision.  BLAH. We were seated promptly right by the hostess stand. AND waited. No server came to take our drinks until 7-10 minutes later when our menus were down and we were looking bored. Seriously? It surely was not busy at all - our waitress Michaela was simply being lazy. I can easily say this now because she was inattentive.  Well I should say, to the customers. To her two friends sitting in the bar area like us, she was super chatty, lingering for 5-10 minutes at a time without a single glance to see if anyone needed anything. The only prompt thing she did was make sure we liked our food a mere second after it was given to us. When she did help us, she was oddly abrupt as if we were getting in the way of her pow-wow.  She also gave us the wrong beer. In PDX, this is like a sin.  This service from Michaela (I remember her name because I was so irritated) coupled with ""just OK"" food = no need to come back ever."
Jason D.,"Bothell, WA",24,453,683,3.0,8/16/2013,Nothing special but not bad either... I did to go here while visiting Portland for the weekend
Brett L.,"Portland, OR",35,113,18,1.0,2/1/2013,"If only I could give zero stars. Sorry folks, but often I make my dining choices based on food, location, reputation or a combination of all. While I will occasionally visit this location based on convenience of location and a decent happy hour, their reputation took a big hit with me when I read this article:  I just can't see myself supporting this business after what I see as a huge ethical mistake."
Del R.,"Beaverton, OR",38,158,75,1.0,11/11/2012,"Okay, so like other's have already said, it's an Applebees, so expectations can't really be all that high, right? Well there are a few expectations that any patron should have for a sit down restaurant: 1. If you bother to hire a greeter, make sure they are someone who actually knows how to greet your patrons. Upon entering, the ""greeter"" was too busy watching the college football game to even notice my boyfriend and I, until our conversation alerted him to our presence. And then he stared at us as if he'd never seen queer people before. Granted, we are more rare in this area, but COME ON! 2. The food should be a touch above fast food quality, especially for the price. We ordered the appetizer sampler for $12.99, plus the french onion soup (the only real highlight of our dining experience, and even that I am told, by my more experienced french onion soup eating boyfriend, was mediocre). I found great irony when a taco bell commercial came on one of the many TV screens that their quesadillas taste so much better than those in our sampler.  The ONLY star worthy aspect of our experience was our server. She was friendly, down-to-earth, and very accommodating. If I was just rating her, she'd definitely get 4 stars.  So, please, save yourself the $$ and just walk next door to Taco Bell. You'll get much better food at a MUCH better price. .shakes head."
Steven B.,"Beaverton, OR",1,6,1,5.0,5/15/2014,"The food was amazing and the service was great. The lady at the front door, I think her name was Lupe. Is the most genuine person in the world."
Laura C.,"Beaverton, OR",1,14,,4.0,11/14/2014,The food and drinks were very good. Only set back is the allowance of staff to take their breaks up in the dining room and their chatter. Will return..great food.
John C.,"Puyallup, WA",54,135,111,4.0,4/23/2014,"Late lunch 2 pm, not to busy here, management not friendly, servers are quick and friendly. I had the southwest chicken n shrimp tequila tango, very good meal."
Sean K.,"Irvine, CA",35,188,,3.0,11/19/2012,"Simply A-OK joint for me. Even with a pretty good happy hour menu, the quality and taste of the food and drinks there are mediocre at best. However, if you are looking for a simple get-together with friends with some inexpensive drinks and finger food on some game days, this place will do justice.  I got traditional wings (10 pieces for about 5 dollars or so?) and a fountain drink for about 8.50 total. I think that's a pretty good deal and was able to watch a Sunday Night Football game too. Wings were ok. Sauce was alright and the texture and meatiness of the wings were inconsistent. I would prefer Buffalo Wild Wings anytime. But since this place offers other great happy hour dishes, I don't mind coming here to chill with my friends.."
Chris H.,"Hillsboro, OR",21,213,88,1.0,5/16/2014,"They just underwent a remodel. Aside from new signs, and a tweaked interior decor, it remains the same as before.  Ive been here a number of times since my last review. All of witch were when family invited me otherwise I would not go by my self. Food here is mediocre. Either undercooked or overlooked and ZERO flavor what's so ever. Thankfully, the steak issues from my last review were not present today, but the steak was still very bland even with steak sauce. Applebee's seems to love to push weight watchers meals. They are scattered throughout the menu and even the non weight watches meals still taste like crap. Service can be a hit or miss. Really depends on who you get.  It's a decent place, but nothing special and nothing to write home about. It's more of a place you go to with family or friends on a Friday or Saturday night. Other then that, just skip this place."
Harvey B.,"Beaverton, OR",2,36,,5.0,4/4/2014,"Well, we went back, to this location, to see if our last visit was the exception to the rule.  I now know why they d=call this ""your friendly neighborhood grill"".  Texiera, the Manager, not only recognized us, she actually remembered both of our 1st names.  She made us feel as though we had just walked in to a local, neighborhood, ""Mom & Pop"" restaurant.  My wife had actually goteen tired of Abpplebee;s,  She thaought that it had gotten a ""little stale"".  The greeting , from Texiera, has put them back on the top of our list.  When you go there ask for her & tell her that Harvey & Marlene sent you.  Be ready to be accepted as ""one of the family"",."
Gillian W.,"Beaverton, OR",130,351,1631,4.0,6/19/2012,"I have been in here many times, although just to hang with friends.. not usually drinking but a local group of us folks got together and had a few drinks here. Thier food here has always been steller and edible. Had I not already eaten I would have ordered something from the menu. We were in the back corner on the left hand side. We had quite the group! I think we may have been a little rambunctious, but we did have fun. I enjoyed and I always like Appleebees. I tend to like divier joints but not faulting Applebees for that. The wait staff was great and took care of our crazy bunch!!"
Vanessa S.,"Beaverton, OR",0,11,,5.0,9/13/2015,5 stars to the bar tender that was working a closing shift on a Saturday a couple weeks ago. My friends and I were slightly intoxicated and she was so patient and so sweet!!  She needs a raise. Wish I could remember her name! Maybe ally?
Finnaeus E.,"Beaverton, OR",7,13,,1.0,4/25/2014,"It's an Applebee's. Nothing special as far as restaurants go, but it was our 8 year old's birthday and he chose it (probably because of the mozzarella sticks and endless refills on his root beer). First, they gave our 13 year old an adult menu and a kid's drink. No big deal, a minor annoyance, but whatever. Then it took more than 30 minutes to get our food once we ordered. This was after 7 pm - there's no dinner rush to be blamed for the lengthy wait. My husband and 13 year old ordered ribs. A little while after they came, we realized our 13 year old didn't get any silverware or a napkin. Wonderful. They usually give you wet-naps with ribs. After we were done eating, it took another 20 minutes to get wet-naps and the 8 year old's free shooter.  And then another 10 minutes to get the bill. We finally left about 45 minutes after I asked for a box.  Let's hope the kid grows out of his love of cheese-filled breads and endless sugary drinks before he turns 9 (fat chance), because I'd really rather not return."
