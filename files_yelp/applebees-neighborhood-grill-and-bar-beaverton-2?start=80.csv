Nick E.,"Beaverton, OR",0,8,,4.0,5/29/2014,"Pretty good overall place to eat. I have had a few bad experiences there, but a majority of good experiences. The best time to go in is happy hour, where their apps are half price.  Staff is very friendly, and has a loud energetic atmosphere."
Janice S.,"Seattle, WA",14,155,103,3.0,4/22/2011,"So, I heart applebees.  One of my favorite places to eat and drink.  I love how you can drink here for hours and they won't try to rush you out.   This particular location was super busy on a Friday night at dinnertime. So 9:00 rolls around and they have this DJ on his mic announcing it's karaoke night. Supposedly they do this every Friday which is very unexpected of applebees.  Although I don't mind it, a lot of people sure did. People came here expecting a nice and quiet dinner.  Come on, it's a family restaurant.  The couple next to us complained about it and asked to get their food boxed up to go because they were so upset. The one thing they should do is post a sign outside so that customers know what to expect on a Friday night.   Other than that, applebees is a great place to eat, drink and hang out."
Diva A.,"Beaverton, OR",1,154,15,3.0,2/10/2014,"Nothing terribly special or horrible about this place. Parking is a bit stupid, but I can get over that. Usually chain restaurants can get at least four stars from me, but there is really, utterly, nothing fantastic that has stood out to me since I've been coming here.  Service is mediocre at best, at times we're left a ""few minutes"" too long to look at the menu. I don't know what servers do if they don't actually serve me ANYTHING. Every time we've come, there is a new person bringing out anything for us. The server will take our orders and some other person will be running it out to us. A different person for drinks, a different person for appetizers, a different person for our meals. I don't know if this is normal but it's a pain in the ass. I can't find my server for anything because they don't bring me anything, and when I ask the person who brings me something, most of the time I can tell they sure as hell don't want to bring it to me. Or they drop something off and run away so fast I can't ask anyways. I don't feel really good about tipping highly because the server didn't actually do anything for me, all the people running their food did. I've wondered if I should hand each person giving me something a dollar instead of tipping...hmm... Food is decent, two for twenty all the time. Nothing to make my mouth water but on a budget it's alright. It's the food you'd probably cook at home yourself but since you don't want to buy all the ingredients and do the time, probably coupled with cabin fever and wanting to get out of your shitty apartment...then yes, Applebee's forever."
Christopher S.,"Los Angeles, CA",68,74,164,3.0,7/31/2011,"The food wasn't bad, its what i expected from applesbees. The waiter was friendly and prompt and did a good job. The only complaint I have was that the carpets were messy with food everywhere. The price is reasonable , for three of us it was around 45 dollars for drinks appetizers and a main course."
Remy S.,"Portland, OR",3,19,,5.0,4/5/2014,Outstanding service with a smile the waitress was awsome i left her a $20.00 i wish more people were like her in the service industry
Kal C.,"Portland, OR",143,601,438,3.0,3/14/2011,"Mostly crappity crap food. The broccoli cheddar soup is the BEST EVER.  But probably because it has enough sodium in it to give me a heart attack. Otherwise, it's all about the $6.99 all you can eat soup, salad & bread for lunch Monday - Saturday."
Sharon M.,"Portland, OR",24,175,3,3.0,5/8/2013,"I ate at Applebee's recently and I was pleasantly surprised.  I got the 2 for $20, and it was quite a nice dinner.  My husband and I shared the artichoke dip and I had the 7 oz sirloin.  My husband had the 3 cheese penne pasta, and the portion was big enough that we had took some home and had it for lunch the next day.  Usually we go there on the spur of the moment, and it is always good enough for us.  Sometimes I think the menu is too extensive and there are too many choices.  I guess that's a good thing, but I never exactly know what to get."
Chris M.,"Beaverton, OR",0,62,8,4.0,11/22/2014,"A typical Saturday night ... it was very busy, but a twenty minute estimated wait turned out to be only fifteen, not bad.  The waitress was great and very efficient.  My husband and I ordered two different burgers and shared them.   The new bacon burger and the swiss mushroom burger are very good.  The only negative would be the spinach artichoke appetizer, I found it to be too salty, but still good."
Lebra B.,"Hillsboro, OR",1,7,1,5.0,9/10/2013,"5 stars from me. Service was great,place was packed but was seated in 10mins and the food was great. The turkey bacon and avocado sandwich hits the spot."
Leslie E.,"Portland, OR",298,135,155,3.0,1/13/2011,"It's an Applebees.  Whoop-de-doo.  Yeeehaw.  Right? Pretty much.  the main menu is....mainly disappointing and overpriced. The new $2-$5 specials menus are pretty great though...you can get more food than any of the entrees for a lot less!  For example, i ordered the Steak w/ Garlic Shrimp off the main menu which runs about $13-14, and the BF ordered the Wonton Tacos, 2 little sliders and a half Reuben with Fries, all at about $11-13.  Not only did he get more food, but his was WAY better than mine too.  Especially the Reuben...tasty sauce and really tender, thinly sliced meat!  The wonton tacos were awesome too, the shredded pork was also very tender, and the coleslaw in them was nicely gingery tasting."
Chuck S.,"Portland, OR",48,180,9,3.0,2/25/2010,"I decided to dedicate some time to hanging out with my mom on my birthday.  She asked if I wanted to go somewhere for lunch, and since I've been cutting back drastically on fast food/restaurant chains, I thought I'd take her up on the offer.  Normally, I'd go to Old Chicago for a calzone, but I decided to buck the trend.  I had a craving for a Chicken Broccoli Pasta Alfredo Bowl (they really need to re-name this meal). On this particular day, I was constantly reminded of my days at Westview High School up 185th.  Typical Applebee's fashion of having a glass case full of WHS ""memorabilia.""  Two girls, who were most likely skipping class, splitting an appetizer plate.  And our server, Matt, also attended Westview and graduated the same year I did.  I wonder if this is exactly what Bill and T.J. Palmer had in mind with their ""Neighborhood Bar & Grill"" pitch. The food and service is not atypical of the Applebee's meals you've eaten at any location before.  It's overpriced for what it is, but it's not -horrible- (kind of like Reggie Bush in the NFL...ZING!).  The CBPAB looked and tasted just like the one I had in Springfield a few months prior. Overall, just another visit to (an) Applebee's.  Glad to know there's one close to home.  Also glad to know there's other restaurants off 185th to go to next time.  Best word to describe the experience: ""meh."" NOTE: Almost tempted to attend their ""Late Night"" hours, just to see at what kind of attempt they make at being more of a bar and less of a grill, and to be ""that guy"" who got drunk at Applebee's."
Gloria G.,"Portland, OR",0,3,,5.0,11/13/2014,went for lunch on Veterans Day and I give a salute  to the wonderful service and meal my wife and I enjoyed. Applebees is to be complimented for caring for the countries veterans and active duty personnel.
I R.,"Portland, OR",0,34,,1.0,7/15/2012,I don't understand what the deal is here. I've tried it twice. Once for a late dinner and now for lunch. The service is decent but all the food tastes the same and microwaved. It's gross. Save your time and go somewhere else. Yuck.
Scott M.,"Aloha, OR",39,133,42,4.0,10/1/2012,"Clean, friendly, cheap, decent. Happy hour is a major bonus - the drinks are pretty cheap (and not TOO watered down) and the 1/2 price appetizers are great. Order appetizers for dinner and be done ordering before 6pm - your wallet will thank you."
Kirsten H.,"Beaverton, OR",140,13,2,4.0,3/10/2013,Delicious food.  I love the two for 20.00 deal.  I usually split it with a friend when we go out.
Carolina H.,"Portland, OR",24,75,534,2.0,2/2/2010,Classic Apple-bee's restaurant but not one of my favorites...but it is the closest one to my home. :) We go here about once a month and are ok with mostly everything. I will say this here and now though...I miss the old way they had decorated and i DESPISE what they have done now. I mean I get that you want to do the local things - but really?!?!?! This way sucks!  We were in yesterday and we had the $20.00 deal...you know a appetizer and two meals...we had the Chicken for app. (very good with the BBQ on them!) the Oriental Chicken Salad and the steak. The salad was just ok this time. They did not bring out enough dressing and my friends steak was touch and chewy. Not out best experience here. I will give them tops for the lady who opens the doors and sits us - she is great - and our waiter was great too.
Jilly P.,"Kamuela, HI",56,220,2,2.0,6/18/2010,"I think I expected a lot with this one. Their commercials make it seem like the food is soooooooooo good. But ehhhh, it was alright.  My sister and I got the 2 for 20 deal. Which I think is pretty good. We both ordered the riblet basket. It was good I guess. Nothing special. The fries were a little on the salty side and HOTTTTTTT. But once they cooled down they were pretty good.  We also had the spinach and artichoke dip as our appetizer. Now that's good eats. I love spinach and artichoke dip! I think that if they put more cheese on it, I would've enjoyed it A LOT more. But it was still good as heck. I enjoyed it. Our server was alright - he was nothing special. The assistant manager came and greeted u - he was funny. Our hostess was kind of rude. My sister asked for a booth and she didn't respond to her - did not appreciate that at all.  Overall, the service could've been improved, but Applebee's was alright."
CaLiLu H.,"Happy Valley, OR",39,175,21,2.0,4/17/2010,"Came to Applebees with my famly after attending my god-brother's play at Westview High because it was the only place still open at 11pm in the immediate area.  When out group of 7 arrived it seemed to tick off the server who was working in our section because apparently he wanted to go home (a fact he loudly told the host).  Feeling like you have to apologize to your server for working is never a good sign before you're even seated! Due to giving up my carnivorous ways for 40 days, I was at a loss for vegetarian options and ended up getting the nachos with chili on the side.  It wasn't bad, but also not good.  My cousins mentioned that the burgers weren't as great as the ones they've had at Red Robin, and my dad's salad was pretty flavorless.  It occurred to me that I was silently wishing that the Burgerville across the street was still open!!"
Tony M.,"Hillsboro, OR",32,120,15,3.0,2/15/2014,"hate that a place that is just ok is always packed and we had to sit at the bar.  bartender was great, but the overall experience was just ok."
Arlen K.,"Beaverton, OR",2,11,,1.0,9/25/2011,"If you wish un-attending waiters/waitresses, cold food, food prepared nothing like you order, uncaring management and a 35+ dollar bill when choosing an advertised 2 for 20 then go the Applebee's. We know we will not be patronizing this establishment again"
