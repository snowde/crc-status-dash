Amanda W.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,16,,3.0,10/3/2017,"This location of Applebee's is decent. The food was good. I think it was a kids eat free night so the place was a disaster, I felt bad for the staff that had to clean it all up. Again, I think this was also the reason that the service was slow and the food took a very long time to come out. But the waitstaff did the best they could, they appeared to be short staffed, however, all of he waitstaff were very kind and attentive..:just overworked."
Princess A.,"Belleville, MI",115,14,4,1.0,1/8/2018,"My original review is below. I reduced from 4 stars to 1. On yelp no customers have more check ins at this location than me however every time I come I feel like I'm hassling the staff or inconveniencing them in some way. The only persons who is friendly there is Kelly who is the host. Anytime I have an issues I'm met with excuses from the management or I just get ignored. After today, checking in 6 times I have decided to stop going to this location. I will gladly spend $50 per week elsewhere. My place to go when the game in on. I like this Applebees location. Most of the staff here is friendly and the bartenders will actually have a conversation with you, especially if you're visiting alone. They do have busy times but I'm my experiences they generally staff properly in advance to be sure they're prepared for rushes. Half off appetizers after 9pm great for weekends and long nights."
L K.,"Romulus, MI",0,45,5,1.0,10/24/2017,Slow to seat people. Greeter was busy talking to other staff for a while and totly ignored our party.
Patrick C.,"Belleville, MI",0,4,,1.0,10/22/2017,They used to have great French onion soup. Nice portions. Its now in a 'boat' .. If you remove the cheese you get 4 oz of soup. It slops around in that stupid boat to make it look like you are getting more soup than you are actually getting. No wonder they are going out of business.
Jamie M.,"Southgate, MI",1,20,,1.0,9/12/2017,"(I wish zero stars was an option). Multiple times I've come here and the service was poor. Takes a long time to greet us, a long time for drinks, a long time to check on us, and forgetful. I know it's not fine dining, but some servers need a lesson there on how to talk to a table. Way too unprofessional. Went to Canton to try that location and it was WAY better. Will eat there from now on."
Kris L.,"Belleville, MI",0,5,,5.0,9/29/2017,"Wonderful staff, good food, good price! Their bar tender Matt Mcgill is amazing and deserves at the very least a gold star!"
Kaylee T.,"Austin, TX",35,30,3,1.0,3/19/2017,"Absolutely not coming back. Ordered a to-go lemon chicken dish, and the side is literally about 1/4C of rice? $10 for a breast of chicken and a tiny bit of rice??? Absolutely never again."
Christina W.,"Belleville, MI",1,69,,3.0,3/2/2017,"Whenever I go to this Applebee's location, it's because the group I'm with wants something more upscale than the coney island down the road. In this case, ""upscale"" refers to the pricing, not the quality of food. On the plus side, we always get seated quickly and it is decorated nicely with references to local sports and attractions. That's it for pluses. On the downside, once at a table, it always takes 4ever to get service. The wait staff is usually nice and they take down orders accurately. Getting those orders in a timely manner or getting their attention later on is a study in futility.  The food we can afford to order is generally good. The less you pay, the smaller the portions. Until I win the lottery, I will not order their $10+ burgers. Their menu seems to have improved over time, but it's still too expensive for a chain. If you're into people watching, you'll be in overdrive at this location. Always an interesting crowd. I do appreciate that they support local businesses and veterans though. On a final note, I intensely dislike their new ordering/payment system at the table. I'm quite computer-savvy, but don't trust my info is protected on these table-top devices. Plus, it's just driving another wedge into that wait staff/customer contact."
Gautham R.,"Belleville, MI",0,4,,5.0,9/1/2017,"Great Food and Ambiance of the place, great staff loved the lemon chicken and rice i had and also spinach dip"
Rígel J.,"Belleville, MI",35,36,10,1.0,6/18/2017,"Cold TV dinner style food with worse service than microwaving it yourself. Came here for a late night bite (not much else open), abysmal service even though they were not busy at all. Food came out lukewarm at best. About an hour later.. Projectile vomit.. That's all I have to say, that finally did it for me, not coming her ever again."
Katrina F.,"Honokaa, HI",2,35,,4.0,4/23/2017,"I am not a big fan of this chain, however, this one in Belleville is the exception to my no Applebee's rule.  During a recent visit with family we ate at this restaurant twice.  The menu was a nice mix of items, with items from salad to burgers to mac and cheese to steak and all very tasty.  Our server was amazing.  Next time I am in town I will return to this restaurant."
Jemz O.,"Ann Arbor, MI",3,12,5,4.0,6/25/2017,"We always have excellent service here, although the food isn't always the best. The main problem is the menu has been watered down to the point there is nothing remaining I really want to eat."
Rhonda V.,"Ypsilanti, MI",115,7,8,3.0,7/1/2017,"Nothing extravagant, but it always does it's job. Can't go wrong with a $3 tall coors and the cheeseburger egg rolls."
Mike S.,"Belleville, MI",33,103,374,3.0,1/27/2016,"Applebee's?! More like Crapplebee's am I right? Seriously though - this place sucks. I honestly can't believe there are hundreds of these places still across America.  It's hard to give this place a legit review when everyone should already know coming here is probably the worst choice you can make during your day besides maybe punching a baby or pushing an old lady off her electric scooter and then hopping on it and backing over her. I will concede their new menu is better than their old menu but, everything here is still a half step above a Swanson's Hungry Man TV Dinner. Most of the meats are clearly frozen and a lot of the stuff you will order comes out way too hot - which is a tell tale sign of a microwave being employed. I can microwave shit at my house, why do I want to drive all the way here and pay these clowns to do it for me? I'm lazy but not that lazy. There are just soooo many better places to eat, why do you even want to bother? I will say though this location had a couple of things going for it if I still can't talk you out of coming down here. We came in about 8:30 and there were at least 3 people cleaning. My negative self automatically assumed there was some type of inspection tomorrow but nonetheless, I have been some places a dozen times and never saw a single person cleaning so, I am happy to give credit where it's due. Also, the service was very good. Attentive, competent, friendly - and not just our server but, the others around us were similarly solid to their customers. The trifecta of what you'd want/expect. Which begs the question why a good server would want to work at Applebee's. But I digress. If you must go here the sriracha shrimp and beer cheese pretzel apps are decent, the quesadilla burger and bourbon street steak are also decent but all of this stuff is loaded with either sodium or MSG or both so, make sure you pound some waters. In closing, other restaurants that I've given 1 or 2 stars to should take notice. If I despise Applebee's but I'm willing to give them 3 stars well -  you need to step your game up playa because you clearly aren't giving it your best effort."
Bine M.,"Belleville, MI",0,1,,1.0,9/15/2017,Food and service usually ok. This time around food was lukewarm. Salad was replaced with different option? No manager around. I won't come back.
Shawn A.,"Tucson, AZ",10,26,2,2.0,2/4/2017,Sat at bar for what felt like 8 minutes before anybody said something to me. Then who I think was the manager proceeded to complain and bark at other employees in front of me while taking my order. I come here quite often but never on the weekends hoping this was just an off day! Disappointing
Crystal A.,"Canton, MI",0,1,,4.0,4/27/2017,Great place. Very sport bar like though with lots of TVs. Food was OK. If you like Applebee's you will like this one.
millie j.,"Dearborn, MI",5,47,2,4.0,6/6/2016,"Visited this location for the first time last night. My son and I enjoyed a couple of delicious steaks. I ordered medium rare, as did he. They were perfectly prepared. We had steamed broccoli I had fries, and he had bacon Mac and cheese. Yes I said BACON. Delish. Service was good. We were seated promptly and even enjoyed a few rounds of trivia on the table set while we waited for our food. Also we enjoyed the appetizers. Spinach and artichoke dip and salsa and chips."
Wendy N.,"Detroit, MI",227,192,624,2.0,5/29/2015,"This visit was not the best.. I took my kids and mom the service was very very slow...We ordered two appetizers  boneless wings and spinach  artichoke dip which came out a few minutes before the meal. The meal was a MW steak, a fajita  wrap, mac and cheese bacon pasta with chicken strip dish, and a kids meal cheese pizza with fries. The quality was not up to par, the mashed red skin potatoes microwaved and pasty. The spinach dip runny and had a hardened cheese floating on top. I did not try the wings my mom and son said they were fine. The wrap was decent I do like the pico de gallo. My mom said her pasta  was just okay a bit bland and chicken strips slightly overcooked. We also had a mishap with my son's  drink there was a melted crayon on the inside of glass...my son didn't  notice right away and to say the least..not pleasant. My children  like Applebee's  it is  one place they  both agree on so that's  why we went but quality has been declining. Service was okay but slow the back of the house very  slow. On a positive some  decent happy hour specials  including 3 buck apps however not worth ordering if they arrive moments before meal and yucky after being under a heat lamp to long... Sorry Applebee's  but this visit  was a disappointment."
Bonnie B.,"South Bend, IN",2,46,8,1.0,2/28/2016,"Worst service, poorly managed Applebee's ever! Waited over 15 min to give our order and nearly another 30 minutes for food with a rude server. Lots of non-servers standing around. Food order came in pieces but at least it finally showed up.  Steak overcooked, foos presentation was bad and we practically had to beg for drink refills. When my daughter asked how much longer on the food she was told ""You'll get it when it's ready."" NICE TOUCH!! When will we learn to check yelp before we get out of the car? I guess I expect more from an Applebee's."
Steve C.,"Pewaukee, WI",0,14,11,1.0,4/13/2017,Might be the worst Applebee's I've ever been to. Food was meh. Drink was meh. Staff was worse. I ate at the bar and they seemed to struggle to keep up when they were only slightly busy. Maybe understaffed? I would skip it for literally anywhere else.
Natasha M.,"Detroit, MI",41,4,,1.0,5/14/2017,"Ordered a chicken wrap to find out they put everything inside the wrap except for the chicken, poor customer service"
Shannon S.,"Belleville, MI",0,4,,1.0,4/9/2017,"Was there today, and it sucked!! My wife and I ordered our meals and an appetizer. Main course came, no appetizer. The waitress forgot to put it in. Then, no silverware. Ask for silverware and never got it.  We got up and left. The best was when we turned around and saw the waitress with a stupid look on her face. ""Like, what's going on""!! You suck at being a waitress, and don't play with your phone in view of waiting customers. Hope you can afford to to for our meals and drinks. Patrons margaritas. Ouch!"
Audrey M.,"Ypsilanti, MI",0,2,3,1.0,8/28/2016,I am here right now. All sides came out barely Luke warm. No apologies from manager at all. They are not busy. No excuse for this.
Rob N.,"Belleville, MI",0,7,,3.0,8/24/2016,"Your normal Applebee's ... You have had better, you have had worse.  At least you know what to expect."
J E.,"Belleville, MI",167,24,,4.0,5/26/2016,"Sitting here at Apple Bees after having walked out of the Twisted Rooster for their lack of service.  I don't like looking at menus that hav more than one page.  This place needs a more concise menu.  Overalll, the service has been good so far.  I am so hungry.  Cant wait to get my foood."
Megan R.,"Belleville, MI",18,11,1,3.0,3/22/2016,I use to go here a lot on my lunch breaks at work.  Wait staff is friendly and mostly fast.  I like the auto check out at the tables so you don't have to wait for your check if your in a hurry.  Their French Onion Soup is my favorite.  Mostly always clean inside.  Only reason I didn't give it a higher star rating is because they don't cook the food right sometimes.  I don't like my burgers pink in the middle.  I love bleeding steaks but not burgers.  And 7 out of 10 times it is pink.  I'm not one to complain either so usually I just suck it up and eat it or take it home and reheat it later.  Last time I went though it was not even editable.  Like it splatted on the plate when I took it out of my mouth it was so raw.  So that is why.
Amanda M.,"Belleville, MI",18,10,34,1.0,9/12/2015,"I went to this location for a simple birthday lunch for my boyfriend, and the service was horrible! We waited sooooo long for our food. The waitress checked on us once, and when she did.. She yelled from across the restaurant ""Hey, you guys ok?!"" I needed something but I was not going to yell back so the entire restaurant could hear my business. Horrible service, wouldn't suggest this location to anyone!"
Stefanie K.,"Belleville, MI",23,3,1,1.0,2/13/2016,"First my soup had a hair in it. Then our appetizer was cold. Dinner : Steak was cold. Shrimp pasta was cold. Slow service!!! waited an hour for food and it came out cold?!?! Had to ask our server where are food was, he responds with ""You haven't gotten your food yet?!"". ....... As we sit at our empty table. Would not recommend or go back!! Wasted 90 minutes for garbage food and poor customer service."
Cindy M.,"Belleville, MI",22,6,,4.0,3/12/2016,"I ordered the ribeye and my husband ordered a new menu item, the brisket enchiladas. My steak was as expected but my husband's meal looked NOTHING like the picture on the menu, it was flat and they were MAYBE 3"" in length. My husband thought they tasted okay but for that small of a portion with a bunch of dry rice next to it...$11? Nope. Plus....they took the cowboy burger off menu!! :("
Thomas D.,"Belleville, MI",0,15,,3.0,4/9/2016,"The 2 for $20 deal is great!  They offer a good selection of beers, including Bell's Two Hearted. I love the tabletop tablets that allow for reorder of drinks and appetizers, as well as paying directly vs having a server take your card from sight.   I recently had a food quality issue and was promptly contacted by the day shift kitchen manager to speak to me about it.  She assured me it would be addressed with the kitchen staff, as well as the wait staff.  She also promised me a gift certificate since that particular meal was a bust...but she forgot to send it."
Andy D.,"Belleville, MI",50,1,,1.0,2/28/2016,Carside to go is always the worst.  I arrive when they say my order should be ready and typically wait at least 20 min before someone will acknowledge I'm there.  Followed by waiting another 10 min to get my bill and food.  Meanwhile you can see your Carside person just hanging out in their little station.  And I'm staring at the sign that says parking in the Carside to go spot has a 10 min limit. So that's 30 min past the ready time before I receive my food.  Can you imagine the quality of the food after sitting for 30 min.  It's awful.  Get better Applebee's!!!
Ashley T.,"Belleville, MI",43,7,3,3.0,8/3/2015,"Pretty slow service. The servers are nice enough it just takes forever for food to come out always. Pretty standard run of the meal Applebee's food, it's open late and fairly cheap so it does the job when you want something other than fast food late in the evening or to have a few drinks with friends."
Royce P.,"Novi, MI",0,8,,5.0,1/21/2016,"The service was amazing!  Food is always great and you really get a ""neighborhood bar and grill "" I am definitely going to be going back for a family and friends event soon. Thanks!"
Deby C.,"Ann Arbor, MI",0,4,2,5.0,6/30/2016,Favorite hang out place! Always great service with cool waiters! Come here at least twice a month!
Joimel J.,"Humble, TX",460,21,8,4.0,6/16/2015,Had a craving for the riblets...still as yum as I remembered. I'm convinced service in this area is just lackluster so the service wasn't as bad as others in the area.
Christopher C.,"Canton, MI",32,15,3,1.0,2/21/2014,"On Thursday 2/20/2014 ordered a very simple Car Side to Go from this restaurant.. I ordered a very basic snack, a quesadilla, a salad and a diet pop. The person taking my order was not friendly.  This was at 4:59 We pulled in and was totally ignored, even though we were the only car.  Usually most Applebees bring out your drinks and total, so they can get your credit card and process it.  Finally about 5:19 the server brought out my food. My quesadilla was average, but my salad was bad because of soggy stale croutons. It totally wrecked the salad. Since she did not get it earlier the server had to take my credit card inside to process. It took her so long - I ate my food before she returned. Never once did she smile or apologize for the delays. The server took my credit card and finally brought out my receipt at 5:35. Basically took 36 minutes to get a bad salad and a quesadilla.  For $13, I expect a lot more service and quality.  I will go to Applebees but will not go to this location again. I also will tell all our friends, family and co-workers to avoid this location. You should avoid it too. Go to a different Applebees location!"
Sean H.,"Ferndale, MI",49,63,35,4.0,4/7/2014,"Been here several times in the past 45 days and it is a good place for reasonably priced good food. I have had the appetizer sampler(pretty doggone good), Garlic Parmesan Steak(excellent), Hamburgers(good), & Fiesta Lime Chicken(Excellent). Service is not perfect but they are quick to rectify any issue immediately with a Manager at your table making sure it s fixed.  High marks!!"
J L.,"Dearborn, MI",0,32,1,1.0,5/22/2016,"MMMMM, who doesn't love frozen food heated up in a microwave?  Gross."
Mosey F.,"Inkster, MI",7,7,1,2.0,10/31/2014,"Second time in 2 weeks going here, and thats only because i wanted to give thwm a second chance. Unfortunately both times or appetizers were cold and when my friends fiesta lime chicken came it was also cold.. i mean COLD. The second time we went service was slow but the place was empty. At least the remade the appetizers, but i doubt ill be back to this location. I know its only Applebees, but at least heat the food up."
