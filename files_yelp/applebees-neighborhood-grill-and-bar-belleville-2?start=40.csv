R L.,"Ypsilanti, MI",0,1,,1.0,2/28/2016,"I will never go back to eat at this Applebee's, out waitress seem friendly at first but after we place our order we never seen her till near the end of our meal, I ordered the boneless wing with BBQ sauce in the sauce and when another waiter brought it out there was no sauce and he just drop the food without no plates nor  napkins. We than had to wait and a different waited brought out our main course and again no napkins. No one check up on us till near the end of the meal. This applebee on Belleville rd has got the worst customer service. Even though I didn't want to tip, I still did but I will not be returning."
Mardoll H.,"Utica, MI",3,1,,1.0,8/10/2014,"All of our meals were cold and the manager came to see what was wrong, she did apologize and finally had our meals remade. But when they were very subpar!! Unripe tomatoes on the sandwiches, burnt chicken,  soggy fries, etc. Then when the bill came we ended up double charged for everything. Very disappointed.....!#!"
Misty C.,"Birch Run, MI",58,4,,2.0,11/10/2014,We come here occasionally just because it's one of the closest affordable restaurants. The food is pretty standard for every Applebee's but the service is almost always terrible. When you get seated every time it's at least ten minutes before a server comes to the table and another five or ten before drinks come. After that refills are almost impossible to get and when your food comes you probably won't see your server until your done and have to wait another ten minutes for your check.
G W.,"Springport, MI",3,19,34,2.0,5/23/2014,"The food was good, but the service....Not impressed! I Sat at the bar, service was pitiful. The bartender was unorganized. All of my empty dishes  sat in front of me, even the appetizer dish and drink glasses during my entire meal. The entire bar was like that. Had asked for drink refills every time.  I placed a to go order, and it never came out. One of the other girls went to look for it and I overheard another waitress tell her all it's been sitting back there for quite a while."
Mary T.,"South Haven, MI",0,4,3,1.0,2/8/2015,Awful! Terrible and slow service!! We have been waiting 15 minutes to just place our drink order. Others are being served around us. It is like we were forgot. I love to eat at Applebee's but their service is non existent. Now after 20 minutes we received out drinks. The manager walks around observing but not talking to any of the patrons at the tables. I will avoid Applebee's in Belleville on Friday nights going forward. They do not know how to staff!
Vicky K.,"Romulus, MI",0,1,1,2.0,5/3/2015,"Not impressed at all. My party of 5 went there this afternoon for lunch.  Our waiter approached us in a timely manner and took our orders.  The appetizers and drinks arrived shortly after our orders were placed.  However, we waited approximately 40-45 minutes for the food to arrive.  The three cheese pasta entree was cold and had to be sent back to be heated.  The waiter had it re-made instead of heated.  The appetizer portions and the two Oriental Chicken salads were considerably smaller than usual. Food was just so, so.  Our waiter was nice and apologized for our long wait.. The restaurant was not very busy and had many empty tables.  Not a great meal for us...... Sorry, Applebee's, you missed it today."
Russ H.,"Royal Oak, MI",193,138,4,3.0,4/11/2013,"It's Applebee's. What are you expecting. Service was good, food was as good as I'd reasonably expect. Parmesan sirloin & shrimp was pretty good"
Wally S.,"Ypsilanti, MI",286,274,121,1.0,5/19/2010,"What were we thinking. You guys don't have to take away my elite badge, I'll voluntary give it up after eating at this poor excuse of a restaurant.  Wow. They brag that they serve ""Kraft"" macaroni and cheese... How many real restaurants do that?  I ordered the onion rings for an appetizer. No dipping sauce and onion rings that verged on being burnt. Also, no flavor.  Main dish. Chicken Penne Pasta. This dish looks great in the picture. The price was right. The dish looked real good when it arrived at my table. What transpired after taking my first bite.... NOTHING. This was yet one more item on the menu that had perfect planning and perfect blandness. ( is that a real word). The 3 grilled chicken slices that sat above the pile of pasta had all indications that they had been grilled; grille marks, a slight grilled flavor and served on their own they might have been considered average. Once you got past that, it was down to tasteless cheese sauce over pasta with a few diced tomatoes sprinkled in for good measure. I was totally underwhelmed. This dish was served with a piece of garlic toast that once again.... (say it with me) had no flavor and was almost inedible. I need dishes that make me happy, not dishes that bring me down.  I need to stop doing this kind of stuff... It only reinforces my ideas about restaurants like this that underachieve to serve the lowest common denominator.  Pass this place by."
Camper R.,"Honolulu, HI",0,31,,1.0,7/14/2012,"I've never been to a place where the wait staff and bartender try to screw you as much as possible. As a bonus, they cant make the franchise food very well. Everything is two notches below other Applebee's."
D'Wayne T.,"Belleville, MI",136,22,18,3.0,9/30/2012,"I have never had a bad experience at Applebee's. I find that it is a restaurant with mediocre food. The menu has a great variety of entrees, appetizers, desserts and combos. Prices are moderate, but value is created with the 2 for $20 menu. I have found that service and management is consistent and very present. I will return in time."
Liz W.,"Belleville, MI",1533,1111,145,1.0,12/6/2009,"Come to Belleville any night of the week and the most crowded parking lot is Applebee's. I for one do not get it at all. I will preface this review by saying I have never been to an Applebee's I like. I find the food bland except for the oddly overspiced things like fries and the selection lacking variety or imagination.  This Applebee's though is almost my hero because they managed to turn my formerly Applebee's loving hubby off of Applebee's forever. Yay! They always overcooked everything, rubbery chicken, overfried anything, don't get me started on already poor choices of steak. My salads were never fresh enough and honestly I struggled to pick anything else from the menu as it usually made me pretty nauseous.  From the tough ribs to numbing down his prior fave tequila lime chicken into uber dry fiesta lime chicken (which really sucks), well even my husband could no longer deal. I think the true breaking point was one night when we stopped in for dessert, the maple butter blondie was served to us dried out, obviously stale and burnt the first batch. The second was naturally still stale and dried out because the batch was, at least they did not burn it. They then decided to tell my husband that is how it always is. Not a smart move at all. It resulted in him dropping money on the table and walking out on the spot.  We have never had to return.  Sorry to say even for an Applebee's this place sucks worse than the norm."
Robin C.,"Battle Creek, MI",0,51,,5.0,6/23/2013,Great service and great food during a recent visit.  Waitress really knew her stuff and could answer any questions we had on the menu. Really pushed appetizers and dessert but that's her job. Brought us refills on our drinks before we asked which is great.  Definitely one of the better Applebees.
David H.,"Belleville, MI",5,129,,5.0,6/29/2013,"Had a very nice dinner at Applebee's tonight.  Had the chicken and beef fajita and it was cooked perfectly.  My son had his typical chicken fingers and they were just right as usual.  The server Haley (bartender), was fantastic!!  She was vey prompt in serving our beverages and dinner.  She made pleasant conversation and actually seemed like she not only cared about us, her customer, but like she enjoyed her job.  Not used to finding good help at these type of establishments  My only concern was that it was very cold in the restaurant.  I don't think I've ever said anything in life about a place being cold, but I did mention it to the Manager (Joe) and he was busy and I thought he blew me off.  I said something to him a second time and he said he had not been to his office to turn the air down yet, but that he would as soon as he was done doing whatever he was doing to the bar register.  Never did feel it get warmer, but we left shortly thereafter.  Overall, a great experience and look forward to a return visit soon with Haley.  She said she bartends on Friday and Saturday and is a server the other nights she works.  Just a heartfelt thank you to Haley and I will brig a blanket next time."
Aaron N.,"Canton, MI",99,49,11,3.0,5/13/2010,"And my first review as an Elite Yelper goes to... Applebee's? Lets be honest folks.  Applebee's is not great.  Sometimes it's not even good.  It's what they call ""casual dining"", which means Applebee's is sorta where you go when you don't care where you go.  Sadly, it is one of the few restaurants in Belleville that isn't fast food and I found myself here on a Monday night at 8:30 just needing something to eat quickly after a long, frustrating night at work and before a long, frustrating night of getting my ass kicked in Mario Kart.  Their Carside to Go® option is pretty convenient when you don't even want to wait for a drive-thru.  Just call ahead and pick it up.  And no worries about bad service... or so I thought. I got the Crispy Orange Chicken Rice Bowl.  To be honest I'd had it before and it was a known quantity.  The pieces of chicken are always plentiful and meaty.  No gristle to be found.  The sugar snap peas are crisp, not soggy, and the orange ginger sauce is fairly tasty.  There's truly enough food there for two meals.  Unfortunately, I got home to find that I had been given no sauce.  I was kind of upset, knowing that there was no way I was driving back over there for a 1/4 cup of orange sauce.  I made due with some Iron Chef sauces I had laying around and pretty much duplicated the sauce they normally serve.  But I was annoyed and called Applebee's to inform them of the lapse (also known as bitching).  I got their manager and she apologized and asked if I wanted to come get the sauce.  ""No"" was my simple reply and she apologized again and surprisingly offered a free meal the following night. So there was my dilemma.  Applebee's isn't great (we've been over this) and here I was agreeing to go twice in two nights.  But it was quite a nice gesture.  I could have been any old scammer calling to say I hadn't gotten any sauce when in fact I had.  The manager had no way of knowing I was for real, but she made the right call and that's worth a star right there. So I sucked it up and before driving home the next night I ordered ahead and got one of their ""under 550 calorie"" meals.  Grilled Dijon Chicken and Portabellos.  I was expecting awful and was actually pleasantly surprised.  Aside from not being piping hot (it was pre-ordered take out after all), the chicken was tender and the portabello on top was almost as thick and meaty as the chicken breast.  It honestly was not bad, especially considering the low calorie content. So Applebee's gets a 3 star review for service that went from lackadaisical to overachieving and food that was better than expected. BRAVO!"
Zack S.,"Grapevine, TX",0,29,4,1.0,10/2/2012,"Bad experience back in August 2012.  My fiance and I went in for dinner and drinks before a movie date night, nothing out of the ordinary, both of us got sandwiches and salads, trying to be good.  Well, I overheard the table next to me say they found a hair in their food.  I know these things happen at restaurants sometimes, but, lo and behold, I dug thru my salad and a nice long grey hair on the plate.  I immediately brought it to our servers attention, and she kindly offered to refund the ONE DOLLAR ($1) additional charge for the salad.  I guess that's what customer satisfaction means to them.  We propmtly left, without finishing half of our entrees.  Then, I sent a handwritten letter to the store manager, mentioning my displeasure and dissatisfaction, and it has now been almost 8 weeks, with NO RESPONSE.  Next time you want some quick easy sit down dinner, go to Roosters down the road.  Similar prices, and better food.  We certainly won't be back and will encourage all of our friends NOT to support them."
