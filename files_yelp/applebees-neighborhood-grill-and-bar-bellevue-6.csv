Mark C.,"Papillion, NE",36,355,670,3.0,5/21/2015,"Eight of us went to visit Applebees for lunch on Thursday.  Four adults and four children.  Thought the bill was going to be huge; however, a HUGE bonus on Tuesday and Thursday is that kid's meals are priced between 99 cents and a $1.99.  Daughter got a small steak and fries for $1.99.  Can't beat that with a stick. Place was busy and server was running all over, but she took pretty good care of us.  Food was acceptable.  Only problem we had was the hair in the salad.  Not very appetizing. Menu has a good variety and if you have kids, you will find it hard to beat the prices on their meals, but make sure you go on Tuesday or Thursday.."
Kylie J.,"Bellevue, NE",0,6,,1.0,11/24/2017,Currently sitting in a booth feeling very confused and uncomfortable. My waiter is being very strange and making weird ass comments. Making the customer uncomfortable is a no no. I shouldn't have to say this. I will not be coming back to this wack ass Applebee's!!!
Deana G.,"Bellevue, NE",57,4,10,1.0,11/14/2016,If you want to eat in a night club atmosphere this is the place for you!  Music so annoyingly loud ( during early lunch mind you) that we could not enjoy our meal.  We Asked management if it could be corrected and she said no.  It's as low as it goes. Really?  Are we dumb?  So loud I could not hear my husband directly across the table from me.   We will never eat here again.  I don't like loud hip hop music while I'm trying to eat a meal at 11am.   Bad management!! Lost my business
Peyton B.,"Bellevue, NE",0,2,,4.0,4/13/2017,"This place was a very well-run place. I recommend if you go here, please ask for Shayne. So nice and friendly, makes small talk with the customers to make sure they feel welcome. There was a red head I didn't get the name of that seemed a little unprofessional but other than that, great service. Amazing food. Great dinner place for family."
Jessi P.,"Topeka, KS",19,1,,1.0,10/22/2016,every single time I go here I get bad service. yesterday we went there and waited 20 mins before WE had to ask someone if we can order our drinks and food. and even after that I was completely nice and they still only came back when I grabbed her to pay because the machine wasn't working. I continued to give applebees the benefit of the doubt that maybe it was just a bad night but I am officially done with this location.
Shae W.,"Columbiana, OH",0,1,,1.0,1/13/2016,"My boyfriend and I love coming to Applebee's, especially for their late night half priced apps. But tonight was another story, we were sat at our table at 8:28, a time when the restaurant wasn't even half full. Multiple servers passed our table multiple times, I had even made eye contact with 3, trying to grab someone's attention. Also, we tried using the ""Call Server"" button on the little tablets at each table twice with no avail. It wasn't until a manager saw the flashing red light on our little tablet that she sent over a clearly busy employee, he kindly apologized and took our drink order. It was then our server appeared with an excuse of trying to take care of 15 peoples checks, okay, but it really only takes a minute to at least tell as ""hey, I'll be with you in a second"", but no. We were finally served at 8:49. 21 one minutes later."
Lisa P.,"Omaha, NE",42,56,153,1.0,5/8/2015,"You can't give 0 stars, I found out. Holy crap... I've visited the Bellevue Applebee's and the 72nd & Dodge Applebee's a few times these last few months... I cannot figure out why I keep going back!? Seriously, their spinach & artichoke dip is the only reason. I have never experienced such unprofessional, inappropriate service in my life! I'm not trying to compare Applebee's to anything legit or noteworthy but, given their menu prices and advertising, their customer service HAS to be better than this. It's insane! Even the freakin MANAGERS! I sit at the bar and they all stand around swearing, talking about customers, gossiping... the Bellevue manager keeps throwing her arms in the air, loudly whining and bitching, and huffing and puffing and saying she's about to ""fucking punch somebody"". They don't even try o hide it! It's some of the craziest shit I've seen. Fucking spin dip... I'm gonna need to part ways with you. Stay away and close this shit hole down!"
T K.,"Glenwood, IA",0,3,,5.0,12/13/2015,"Awesome service, great food, delicious drinks, a little pricey, but always the 2/20$ menu!"
Dillon I.,"Paso Robles, CA",13,14,4,1.0,6/20/2012,"Not only was the food bad, but the service was awful. We ordered hot apple pie for dessert and waited 15+ minutes to get a piece that was frozen in the center. I can't even attribute this experience to them being busy, as it was about 4:00 with hardly any guests. I was already on the fence about Applebee's, but now I outright hate this place."
Ken W.,"Plattsmouth, NE",0,2,,1.0,5/23/2015,"They ran out of beer at 9:00 on a Friday night. No Blue Moon, no Super Nova Empyream, just crap beer left. Manager dropped the ball."
Maria B.,"Moreno Valley, CA",114,92,22,2.0,8/31/2013,food was not as good as it is here in cali.  service was slow && the waitresses were all in corner talking about someone's wedding && what their plans were for the weekend meanwhile all tables were left unattended with water that needed to be refilled etc.  A blonde girl chase my daughter out of restaurant while she holding my grandson trying to pick up on her SMH really inappropriate chats going on in the restaurant by all the waitresses then to have one chase her out WOW def wont return here
Nick K.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,11,,5.0,1/10/2015,"Best experience I've ever had at an Applebee's.  Granted the wait was long, but I came in on a Saturday at 7 pm. Avoid that time unless you have patience to wait to sit down. Honestly the food was amazing. The experience was even better. Had a very knowledgeable and awesome waiter named jason h. Coolest waiter I've ever had. He knew what was good and what wasn't. Always filled the drinks and was a blast to talk to. The 2 for 20 menu is good. My wife and I got the spinach dip which is always good, and I got the penne which I highly recommend.  My wife got the fiesta chicken I think it was called.. always would highly recommend this. The restaurant was clean. Good atmosphere.  I recommend this location to anyone"
Brian V.,"Bellevue, NE",1,26,6,4.0,8/8/2014,"I had the Artisan Grilled Chicken Ciabatta. This is a favorite sandwich of mine. The fries are good, seasoned with some spices. It was a Friday night so very busy. The waiter was okay, nothing special. I took the kids and they all liked the food so thats a plus."
Jessica S.,"Bellevue, NE",5,41,,4.0,8/25/2013,I love their 2 for $20 that includes an appetizer. Spinach artichoke dip is amazing! I also like their steak. Pretty good service as well & they give military discount!
Kimberly N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,5.0,11/13/2007,"This restaurant is absolutely amazing.  For starters, the appetizers are delicious.  I would recommend the honey BBQ boneless wings.  The diverse choices on the menu make it great for whatever appetite you have:  Mexican, Italian, Asian.  You name it, Applebee's has it.  They change their promo items often, meaning there is always something new to try.  Finally, the desserts are AMAZING!!!  There's ice cream on the side of each of them, so you get the gooey, melty taste with the actual dessert, and the cold, creamy taste from the ice cream.  It's genius!  Perhaps the most important, the staff was absolutely wonderful.  The hosts really greeted us warmly, and our server was very attentive without being overly accommodating.  The manager visited our table to check up on us, which made us really feel like they  actually cared about our dining experience.  I will definitely recommend the Bellevue Applebee's to anyone who wants a great meal with friendly service."
