Joan H.,"Bellevue, WA",52,72,296,5.0,7/12/2017,"This is one of my favorite place to come to after work for a late night bite and a drink with my friends since they close at midnight. I come to this location very often because of the staff there. Shout out to Erving for being a great waiter and giving good service!  I really enjoy coming here for the appetizers for happy hour. You can really just order bunch of appetizers to share with friends for a good price. Very chill place to come hang out and chill with your friends. Great staff too which makes your dining experience even better! Also, I really like the mango perfect margarita! It's my favorite drink to get!   But yeah, overall, really good service. Really good food. With a good price!"
Glenn G.,"Bellevue, WA",87,65,274,5.0,11/11/2017,"I stop here at least twice a month to get my happy hour fix. Wings, steak quesadilla, mozzarella sticks and then finish with a triple chocolate meltdown. I always come when the server Jose is there. I specifically ask to sit in his section. You should do the same. Great happy hour !!"
Jimmy B.,"Bellevue, WA",19,310,125,4.0,4/11/2017,"Stopped in for a quick lunch between accounts.  What started off not so good, turned out pleasant.  Sat down at the bar, perused the menu looking for something that's not too filling but will satisfy my hunger, and settled in on the build your own app.    After waiting about 8 minutes, I was finally greeted by the bartender, and even before I could say hello, was interrupted by another employee asking the bartender a question.   Not impressed by the lack of manners.  Unbeknownst to me, where I sat at the bar, is also used for staging ""to go"" orders and stacking dishes headed to the back room, not a pleasant seat.   Now for the main topic....the food.  My order came out fairly quickly, hot, and was VERY tasty.   For a large chain operation, Applebees is usually very consistent at reasonable prices.     Everyone at the bar but me was greeted by the their first name, so obviously there's a ton of repeat business from locals.  That in itself is a great compliment to the staff (not the guy who interrupted me), the management, and the quality of good, especially when you have so many other options near by.   I'll definitely be back when I'm around this part of town."
Martin P.,"Sammamish, WA",9,17,2,4.0,10/24/2017,"I have to give this place 4 stars because everything, the service, the food,  the soft drink refills was excellent but I hate those billing machines on the table. Maybe that's just me. Anyway, my wife and I had the two for twenty five selection. Starting with the wonderful salad, when Oscar brought it out I turned him away saying we didn't order a salad entree. It turns out that this huge beautiful thing was the salad appetizer. It was beautifully put together with all kinds of greens not just iceberg and bits of tomato, cucumber, bacon and some other stuff. Our entree selection, 1/2 rack of BBQ ribs with fries and garlic green beans, was wonderfully messy and delicious. Oscar our waiter was courteous and attentive with handi wipes, napkins,drink refills and everything else one would want in a professional wait staff. As to price, for what you get it's really inexpensive."
Riana S.,"Bellevue, WA",0,5,3,1.0,10/13/2017,DO NOT GO HERE. Worst service seriously ever. The manager Sarah or something (with a shaved head) charged our account twice and then said we were getting new food and it never came out. She was rude and very unprofessional. I wish I could of eaten instead of sitting for TWO HOURS. I get it's Friday and busy but we never got our food and charged double instead.  Crazy.
Payel C.,"Bellevue, WA",11,18,1,3.0,8/8/2017,We generally try out the 2 for $25. The food is good. The vegetarian options are very limited. We had a bad experience with one of staff(who was extremely rude) one time after which we rarely go to this restuarant.
Elvira M.,"Bellevue, WA",228,25,21,3.0,1/22/2016,"Not sure if my review might be as helpful since Applebee's is obsessed with having the same atmosphere, same vibe, and the same layout as any other Applebee's that I've been to. As far as this location goes, it's very convenient for lunch, meetings, or happy hour at the end of a tough work day. They are also very understandable with your health choices so substituting something is no problem.   Best healthy choice - Savory Cedar Salmon with roasted veggies but substitute potatoes for more veggies. Although they just bring some broccoli and zucchini, it's still delicious."
Diana R.,"San Bernardino, CA",3,19,13,5.0,6/1/2017,This place is amazing! Manager Andrew was sooo friendly and actually came out to see how the tables were doing. He has a great sense of humor. Miguel was our server and he did a great job as well. This is the place to go for good food and great  service!
Lauren P.,"Kent, WA",695,737,373,3.0,2/8/2016,"Applebee's is always a pretty standard experience, seeing how it's a chain. We were seated quickly, our server was really nice and checked in on us an ample amount of times... But I just wasn't wowed with my food. I got the nacho appetizer and it's probably the most ""eh"" nacho appetizer around. It supposedly comes with white queso, but I didn't taste or see it, and there was a wimpy amount of cheddar. I asked if they had guac, unfortunately they don't, but the server said he could get me a side of avocado... Turns out they ran out. The pulled brisket was the best part of that dish. Won't be ordering again, or going to Applebee's if it's my choice."
Sophia G.,"Bellevue, WA",0,17,,5.0,1/22/2017,My husband and I love coming to this Applebees just because of Ya-Wei and her 5-star service. She is always so attentive and friendly and makes great drinks too! She makes it a great place to go for happy hour.
Michelle L.,"Bellevue, WA",126,173,10,3.0,8/20/2015,"I have been told that I am a ""grandma"" for going to Applebee's for drinks. About 85% of the customers are senior citizens, ingredients are probably never fresh but always frozen, and the ambience is a bit tacky with all of the decorations on the walls.  But here's how I see it. Happy hour is consistent and you can count on it having your standard ""bar"" food. you've got your chicken wings, your spinach and artichoke dip, sliders, etc. etc. Drinks are to the point and simple. They do their job! If I want a vodka soda with extra lime then I will get exactly that, and I don't have to worry about seeing a ridiculous price for it on my bill. Lastly, I can be totally relaxed in this place. I don't gotta worry about acting all fancy schmancy!  So, if the boyfriend and I are just looking to have a chill but fun time? We go to Applebee's! I mean, why not? We hang out in the bar and have our drinks, have some food, and walk out with numb faces. it's allllll good. And if I'm being called a ""grandma"" for drinking here? gtfoutta here."
Brad H.,"Kirkland, WA",234,971,114,5.0,6/19/2016,Your standard Applebee's in terms of service and food quality. The food is fresh staff is efficient and the location is clean. The location looks to have been recently remodeled and has a less cluttered look then older locations. All in all a decent dining experience. No complaints and 5 stars for what you would expect from Applebees.
Pawares P.,"Bellevue, WA",172,85,151,4.0,12/10/2015,"This review is for my last 2 visits at Applebee's at this location (1st was about 1 month ago at 11 pm, 2nd one was around 10 pm on 12/9/15) Due to my weird working schedule, I usually get off work late 4-6 days a week.  So, I have limited choices of restaurants where I can sit to eat, drink beer and chill after a long day of work.  This Applebee's right here happens to locate close to my house (about 10 blocks away), so whenever I want to have dine-in late night steak with reasonable price, I would come here.  For the last 2 times, I got the same thing.  It was the Bourbon Street Steak (I think the price was 16 dollars?).  The reason I got it again?  Because it satisfied me!  I know the quality of the steak wasn't as amazing as real steak house.  But I'm talking about 10-11 pm Dine-in restaurant... Who else does that you know??  So, I have been happy about this Bourbon Steak I got, which came with grilled mushrooms and onions, and I asked for side of mashed potato instead of baked potatoes. Although I went there late, the service there usually was great... not amazing though.  There were a few times where I had to wait too long for my drink or for someone to walk by, but whatever, it was late so the staffs were shorter than day time.  The server always checked if my steak was cooked right by letting me cut it opened in the middle right after he served me.  He also asked me if I wanted extra steak sauces, which I always got A1 and Ketchup to eat with my steak at Applebee's.   You can tell that I was happy with my meal because I ate everything on my sizzling plate... or maybe I was just hungry?? who knows haha.  All I know is I got full, a bit buzzed and felt relaxing meanwhile watching Sports Center on one of their 4-5 tvs...  The bill came out to be 22 dollars for a steak and beer, reasonable price.   Overall, I have been happy with my experience here.  I'm glad I live close by to it, and I'm sure I will keep going back once or twice a month for late-night steak and beer!"
Jerry T.,"Redmond, WA",156,6,12,1.0,12/31/2015,"First time in my life ever feeling like I do not want to pay for my meal. My steak was charred and burnt for being well done. It really sucks that they don't have turkey gravy but only stout gravy; like really?? Even Denny's have turkey gravy.  Charred meat causes cancer, hope you all know that before eating anything charred."
N R.,"Sammamish, WA",0,16,,1.0,4/28/2017,The food was very bland. The grilled chicken tasted off as well as the crispy chicken. Half way through my meal my stomach was not feeling well.
Gary F.,"Seattle, WA",20,15,2,1.0,12/20/2015,"Usually have a good experience, but the last few times here were not. Took 30 min to get my takeout. Food was cold and seemed like much less than regular amount of ""eat-in"" food served. Called to have them reorder or at least give me more potatoes. Heard them talking in the background about me complaining, then they hung up on me...um ya. Bad form people. Just dont have time to come back in right now to deal with this, but wanted to document it so I can get a refund later when I get back in town from Christmas."
Ratish K.,"Bellevue, WA",18,87,127,4.0,4/11/2015,"One of our all time fav hangouts when we are left with a question of where to go when many restaurants in Bellevue ""village"" have closed down before 10 pm. they keep changing their menu often for the good.  The siracha shrimp, chicken tacos, Napa chicken, chicken & shrimp combo are some of our favs"
Kaitlyn A.,"Redmond, WA",122,15,1,5.0,9/18/2016,"Love coming here. We come to watch the Seahawks game on Sunday's not to mention half priced appetizers after 9. Come here and ask for jose, he won't disappoint!"
Stefanie H.,"Kent, WA",16,147,12,1.0,7/26/2016,"I never write short reviews EVER but my experience was a year + ago and the only thing that still holds strong in my mind was that i was deeply sickened after eating here at Applebee's. The service was great, the waiter was nice and sat me quickly, they opened the door for me, the restaurant was decently quiet and the food time was somewhat slow but the food was good. Good that is till i got home and became so sick i had to throw up what i just ate and had stomach pains till the next day. But of course whoever cooked my meal that day is either gone or is still working there. I don't know but once a place gives me under cooked food or food that is not acceptable to serve and it gets me so sick to where i waste that $ i just spend on the food to just throw it up, i won't ever be giving them a second chance and i won't be returning."
Lamb588 L.,"Bellevue, WA",0,20,2,5.0,6/24/2016,Love their new wood-fire grill steak!  More Juicy and flavorful!  Taste about the same or better comparing to other mid-price-range restaurants in Bellevue!  But at a much more affordable price!  Their baby-back rib is also delicious!  We'll definitely be back for more :-)
Thomas L.,"Everett, WA",1,6,8,4.0,1/14/2017,"Always love going to Applebee's for late night apps. This trip we went with a few friends, group of 6 overall. We sat in the bar and the waitress was very friendly and attentive. The apps came out in good time, and everything tasted great. The only thing we didn't like was when a waiter came to our table after we had a few drinks and told us not to drink and drive. While we appreciated the message, he stood there and told us about his experience and it kind of put a damper on the mood of the evening. Otherwise, everything was great!"
Christian M.,"Kent, WA",1,30,8,5.0,10/7/2015,"I seem to always have a pleasant experience at this Applebee's. The service was nice, friendly, and very inviting. The food I ordered was fresh and cooked to my specification. The alcoholic beverages I ordered to compliment my meal were well made and very refreshing. I would recommend this Applebee's location to anyone, especially those seeking a nice hang out spot after work."
Rohan T.,"Edmonds, WA",40,96,30,4.0,8/21/2015,"Good comfort food, easy to sit down and order food. Good drinks and good value for money... When you can't decide what to eat... This is an easy call..."
Maria P.,"Bellevue, WA",0,4,,1.0,5/25/2016,The waitress we had was horrible. We order food for our staff and one of them ordered a steak and did not get the steak until almost everyone was done eating. Also while one of us was still eating they asked if they could take the plate because at this time we had already been there for 2 hrs which was not by choice. Another server was able to help us so they got the tip instead of the server we had. I would say stay away!!!
Tony C.,"Bellevue, WA",1217,198,451,5.0,6/11/2015,Love the burger deals on Mondays! Always have had great service here. They hold the door open for you to when entering. Very nice and accommodating!
Unbame K.,"Redmond, WA",1,6,8,2.0,2/4/2016,I wasted my time and money. I am so disappointed. My order was Sirloin steak and fries it was too salty
Paul B.,"Redmond, WA",0,3,,5.0,4/23/2016,"I don't know about the other Applebee's  but for a proper made cocktail  ( i love a proper Rye Manhattan straight up""  or their ""Perfect Margarita"" )  nobody can  beat their bartender on friday night Ya Weh.   A couple of drinks with an order of their Asian ribs and some hamburger egg rolls you and your significant other have the start of a great evening to build on.   Along with this they have several great beers on draft including Mac and Jack and Stella.  Great service, excellent food and the best mixed cocktails and you don't need to  hock your car when you get the bill."
Chris A.,"Seattle, WA",336,136,74,3.0,3/11/2014,"Well, let's be honest guys... we are talking about an Applebee's. haha ____________________________________________________ CON Service is usually pretty good and the food is... well Applebee's. I dont think we are going to see much variation here. The food is not so great but the deals are cheap and therefore it makes it worthwhile to go. This location in particular has great service and if I had to choose between other Applebee's I've been to I would choose to come here. Nevertheless I don't think an Applebee's can get a score of greater than 4.  ____________________________________________________ PRO With all that said... Pitchers are really cheap and TOTALLY WORTHWHILE if you want a beer for a cheap price. Go get them pitchers son :) Happy eating my friends"
Charles D.,"Bellevue, WA",0,1,,5.0,4/16/2016,"Epic, I had the best time at Applebee's with my fiance tonight. My server Shawn was attentive and recognized me from my first visit. He was chearful and had many fine suggestions for our supper. The food was just as good as the first time. Furthermore, the manager Andrew dropped off our food. After asking if I would like another beer he offered me (A newcomer to the state of Washington, having moved far from home for work) a small flight of the local color in samples, on the house! Very cool, very charming! Needless to say I have a new favorite brew (Mac&Jack) and a new favorite place to drink it. Hats off to the Applebee's on 140th and bell red. I felt like this staff cared about my dining experance and that i wasn't just another patron. Thanks for a good night!"
Inna B.,"Bellevue, WA",840,1116,3120,4.0,2/20/2013,"First thing: This is an Applebee's, and it is a lot like every other Applebee's I remember visiting as a teenager. It is a chain and it's not a place I normally choose to eat, but... it's fine sometimes. In this case, it was a pretty good experience. I got some standard small steak with veggies on the side and my friends were on some special diet, so they had some very specific requests for their salads. The waitress and kitchen did a great job listening to those requests and serving only what my friends wanted. The one funny but sad thing is that after my friends told her they were on a special diet and requested very minimal/specific salads, she still offered us brownie bites. I'm guessing she had to offer those things because... well, they just didn't fit with anything we ordered that day. Was this a fabulous gourmet experience? No. Was the waitress nice and did she listen to our requests? Yes. Was the food pretty good? Yes."
Sherene K.,"Kirkland, WA",75,44,17,3.0,3/23/2015,"This place does NOT suck.  It's not the grandparents stand-by (think Dennys), nor the kid-fest that Red Robin usually is. It's something in the middle with reasonably priced, decent food. Some of it is surprising good - like their new burgers where they cook in a bunch of veggies. Yum.  Plus they have good, attentive service. It's a decent alternative for breakfast or lunch with colleagues you don't need to impress all that much. You can talk because it's fairly quiet -which the ""impressive"" places all seem to lack.  And if you're there for a meeting, that's a big perk.  Overall - not sucky."
Sam D.,"Seattle, WA",3,49,8,5.0,3/23/2015,"The service here is the best in town.  The servers are almost over-friendly.  You can get happy hour in the dining room, and the staff are great with kids.  The manager at this location runs an amazing operation, we're always impressed by how well-mannered the service is. If you've eaten at the Applebee's chain, you know what the food is like.  There's no real reason to review an individual location on the national menu."
'Trishas S.,"Bellevue, WA",11,1,1,5.0,4/11/2015,"My family and i love reading here. Their service is great, food is awesome, and prices work for a single mom. The 2 for $25 is where it's at!"
Mehdi A.,"Bellevue, WA",87,18,1,3.0,3/4/2016,Good service not really good food cold greasy food dry fried but I give 3 because of server
Shoham D.,"Redmond, WA",42,80,,3.0,10/20/2014,Pretty decent place for burgers and pastas....the waitresses were polite and courteous....service was great....chicken n shrimp entrees were delicious..... Try their cocktails too....quite good..... Overall a good place to visit for a quick snack/breakfast/lunch/dinner .
Pamela W.,"Bellevue, WA",0,3,,2.0,2/20/2016,"This is my go to late nite eatery.  Usually good, but last nite I ordered a burger and fries.  Was asked how if I wanted the patty done or pink.  I said ""done for sure"".  Got home and it was more pink than done... Fries were old and uneatable... Can't use the excuse they were busy, it definitely was not.. also I only live 5 blocks away so the excuse of 'It was to go and fries get cold"" will not fly either... Bad nite for them?? Hope it was... super bummed... now I need to find a new late nite place  =("
Eric W.,"Kirkland, WA",0,2,2,3.0,10/25/2015,"Went in for a quick dinner and took advantage of the half off appetizers happy hour deal. We got the boneless wings, fries, and chicken quesadilla. It was very good and our waitress was awesome!!! I was bummed out that bone in wings are no longer part of the half off deals but other than that 3 stars!!!"
Lorraine S.,"Redmond, WA",0,23,1,3.0,10/24/2015,"The food is a solid 3 but the waiters are 4.5; they make it worth it. They're willing to talk and make jokes, they don't just serve you and leave like most places. Shawn, Irving, and Andrew are fantastic. Thanks guys :) One other thing though is they don't have any vegetarian options outside of pretzal bread sticks or plain pasta, even the tomato soup has chicken broth in it."
Shep G.,"Bellevue, WA",50,406,39,4.0,10/9/2014,"Say what you want about this chain, but they are always involved and excited to help you out. We dropped a group of 20-30 on them because Bellevue Brewery was booked by MS. They couldn't have been nicer about it, and they went way above and beyond for all the separate checks that we bombed them with. I don't like all their food, but anyone can find something to like on their deep menu..."
Sara M.,"Seattle, WA",29,304,54,4.0,7/16/2012,"I used to work here in College (12+ yrs ago) but have never dined at this location. Usually I don't think of this place when I want to go out to eat but it was close to where we were heading and quick. Our server was really nice and made sure to take care of us when the person he was training became overwhelmed. Turns out the guy knew my husband from HS so that was cool to watch them catch up. He ordered the quesadilla burger and a cup of french onion and I enjoyed the chicken wonton taco appetizers and a side salad. Even though it was early morning, they were serving both breakfast & lunch so that was cool. We're rarely in the area but I would surely consider coming back. Some things are hit and miss (never order a steak here) but the basics are always good."
