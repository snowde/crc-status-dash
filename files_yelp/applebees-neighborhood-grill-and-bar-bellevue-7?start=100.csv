Digital G.,"Bellevue, WA",0,40,11,2.0,4/3/2008,"My husband likes it here but I think it's a waste of time.  Their multi-course meals are a great value but the quality and quantity of the food s questionable - I got a rubbery steak that was like eating a dog's squeaky toy and a ""shooter"" cheesecake that I could eat in one spoonful.  They try to be like Red Robin with all the crap on the wall, but their service doesn't compare.  I'd rather spend dinner at Denny's - at least the food is real."
