Maggie L.,"McKinney, TX",18,24,4,5.0,6/5/2016,"Awesome place!  We had to walk out of the Bellevue Brewing Company last nite  for their inattentive and disinterested attitudes, but luckily my husband thought of Applebee's.  Good times, good food, good drinks and open till 1:00 am.  I found my new fav spot.  Yummy"
Maria Y.,"Seattle, WA",64,262,72,2.0,6/24/2012,"This place is just.... not good. I am not opposed to chain restaurants, because while they are usually not particularly inspiring, the food is generally consistent and there is enough variety in the menu that everyone in a group will have something they like. This review is overdue - it was actually over a year ago that I ate here - but I remember it quite well. I came with some friends for my birthday, not all 21, so we sat at a table in the general dining area and not the bar. (In general, I prefer to sit in the bar at chain restaurants, because there are no noisy kids and overall a more relaxed feel.) I had not been to an Applebee's before, that I could remember, but this place was centrally located for all my friends, some of whom are picky, so I thought it would be a good option. Well.. it really wasn't. The drink I had was weak and the food was just not good. I had a grilled shrimp entree with veggies and the veggies were completely overcooked, mushy, and pathetic. I couldn't even finish them. The appetizers were good though, so I'm not going to give this place only one star (I reserve those for the truly disgusting places where the food is literally inedible.)"
Erin B.,"Bellevue, WA",17,23,30,1.0,2/16/2015,"Alright buckle up because I'm about to lay down some hot fire of truth here, and don't take this lightly, we used to come here all the time, but it's been slowly getting worse and worse. The staff is great, but the food is horrendous!! I went there on Valentine's Day, after many bad run ins, (one of which included my 15 year old sister being flirted with by a waiter. But that's for another time!) anyway! The food was awful. We ordered the green been crispers (my favorite thing) we had maybe 6 beans that were actually tasty. The rest were damaged, and just sad. We also ordered the spinach artichoke dip, and it was cold. Not even Luke warm. We sent it back, but we were pretty sure they just popped it in the microwave. Everyone's food was mediocre at best, I ordered steak, not grease soup. My steak was covered in this oil/grease and so was the plate. It had a kind of burned taste to it, at first I thought it was a seasoning or something it was fried in but then I realized it wasn't fried... The only thing that was good about my dinner was the mashed potatoes... A hard thing to mess up really. After many attempts at trying to come back here and giving it ""one more chance."" And I got sick after eating here! So if you go here and things are bad, no it isn't just a bad night, it's been bad. It is bad bad bad bad. Wow. Okay, I'm so glad I got that off my chest! I feel much better! But seriously, run away!!!  Just to recap!  * Creepy waiters  * burned food  * getting food poisoning  Alright class dismissed!"
Rhea H.,"Seattle, WA",12,47,2,3.0,6/9/2015,The food here is....well it's Applebee's. On the other hand the service here is pretty great. The bar is insanely clean!!! Jory and Yah Wei are amazing servers and bartenders! I would give those two 5 stars. The reason for 3 is only because I wasn't really a fan of their food. Their bathrooms were mediocre as well.
Edith L.,"Forest Hills, NY",84,161,100,3.0,8/20/2015,"Came here late one night for some snacks. Their food was average. 1/2 off happy hour appetizers was a good deal. We had pot stickers, boneless buffalo wings, spinach and artichoke dip and mozzarella sticks. The artichoke dip was too chunky for my liking. The other food was okay but service was slow. We paid on the fancy new machines at the table and took almost 20 minutes and 3 people to find her to give us our receipt."
Allie S.,"Bellevue, WA",388,447,36,5.0,12/29/2013,"""Five stars? Really, Applebee's warrants FIVE stars, Allie? What's wrong with you?"" you probably are asking yourself if you're bothering to read this review. There are some caveats. Yes, this is still a chain, yes you'll probably have a similar experience at the Applebee's down the road. This five stars is definitely not on par with some of the fancier restaurants I've bestowed the honor of five-stars upon... But really hear me out: Applebee's is one of the best chains for making crazy requests. I do my best to eat a ketogenic diet so I keep my non-fibrous carbs to a minimum and try to keep my fat content up -- Applebee's is always more than happy to accommodate me and my cray-cray sounding restrictions. Case in point: Tonight the boyfriend and I went and ordered off the 2-for-$20 meal. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and two sirloin steaks. They had no issues with swapping out the tortilla chips that the dip came with raw veggies, swapping out the default mashed potatoes with extra steamed broccoli and didn't judge me when I got my broccoli ""fully loaded,"" with bacon, cheese and sour cream. And this is how they always are -- always willing to go above and beyond to make sure you're getting the meal you want. Applebee's may not be the classiest joint, but for consistency and overall satisfaction, this location is fantastic.  Also, their happy hour is freaking amazing and you don't feel like a terrible person if you trudge in wearing your pajamas... because it's still *Applebee's* -- and sometimes it's just what you need."
Vy M.,"Redmond, WA",198,91,144,3.0,4/23/2016,"Came here for a late night birthday dinner for a coworker. It was also my first time. I've always been skeptical about Applebee's because of some of the negative reviews, but I was excited to try it out for myself. The service towards the end of the night was good but in the beginning, not so much. When our server asked for our drink orders, my coworkers, who were over 21, ordered some margaritas and he asked how many we wanted and I said 4. I don't know if he thought I wanted one as well but when he asked to see our IDs, I was confused about why I needed to show mine since I haven't ordered anything, but I just went ahead and asked if they had Virginia drinks and he said ""how about just a lemonade?"" I thought that was kind of rude but I brushed it off. Next when we got our food, I ordered a steak and shrimp parmesan, steak cooked medium rare but when I got it, my steak was definitely well done. If it was any other time I wouldn't have cared so much, but I just wanted to see how our server would react to me sending back my steak. The way our server handled the situation wasn't as pleasant, but the manager was great. He apologized multiple times and kept checking in. Over all, it wasn't as bad as I thought, but I don't think it would be the first place I'd choose to go to for a meal."
Laura D.,"Kirkland, WA",6,51,14,3.0,12/28/2013,"Honestly I would probably never come back here if it wasn't for the management.  Our waitress was not very good, she forgot my drink on multiple occasions. And when our food came out the bacon in my boyfriends dish was nearly raw. So undercooked it was pink and white! I called her over and told her there was raw bacon in our food and she told me no it was cooked! And proceeded to tell me it was tomatoes and spices in the sauce.  Her manager Scott came over, apologized and replaced our food! When it happened again, he went and checked his kitchen to find sauce that wasn't prepared properly. He removed the charge from our bill and gave us in store credit. He apologized profusely, a very nice young man. If he had not have intervened, we would never be back. It was nice to see a manager handle his restaurant with customer service."
Marquiteax M.,"Lynnwood, WA",1,1,,5.0,3/5/2015,"Everytime I come here my homeboys Jose and Scott treat me like royalty, and I come here a lot, once or twice a week. Service here is the best"
Pushpak K.,"Sammamish, WA",19,27,169,3.0,1/29/2015,"Ordered the Triple Chocolate Meltdown -- 2 orders. 1 was perfect. The other was not heated properly. The chocolate lava had not melted and was more fudgy and lava. Still, tasted delicious :)"
K B.,"Aiea, HI",9,204,34,3.0,9/7/2013,"The place is a bit pricey, our server was not very friendly and took forever coming to our table.  They ran out of the food item and did not let me know until 15-20minutes after I ordered so I had to wait longer while the rest of my group got their food items. The management was much friendlier and offered free dessert though I did not take it. When I got my check, they kept the food item I originally ordered on my check, which was more expensive than the one I ended up ordering since they ran out."
Gavin P.,"Chicago, IL",33,251,345,3.0,5/13/2013,"Set aside whatever you think of Applebees as an average run of the mill American bar/food restaurant. This place has some of the best and kindest staff I have seen! They open the door for you, find you a table really quickly, and if you are a regular they remember what your preferences and are cheerful to converse with. You feel like you are among friends.  The food is average American, but still it is good here. Nothing I haven't had before, but it all tasted great! I like the wings, and friend vegetables.  They also have a lot of screens so you can follow whatever sports event is going on at the time.  But seriously, the service is worth it. They are so kind and happy here."
Sheree Ann E.,"Seattle, WA",170,22,12,2.0,11/7/2014,"If your on a hour long lunch, you might want to go elsewhere. When ee came in, it wasnt all that busy. Waitress gave us our drinks and that was the last we saw her. Had to flag down a different waitress just to order. Overall im just not satisfied with the service. Shouldnt take no more than 10 mins just to get soup. Omfg...."
Michael P.,"Seattle, WA",410,125,121,2.0,10/10/2014,"I am so overwhelmed with ""Meh"" every time I walk in to an Applebee's. The food? Grease bombs. The walls? Covered in who cares. BUT! Then you sit down, and the drinks are cheap, and the veggie quesadilla isn't so bad. The bar had tablets for ordering food that the waitress was all-too-happy to joke were gunning for her job. Even though I work in IT I am still not ready to give up the idea of human interaction at a restaurant. But hey at the end of the day, there's nothing wrong with a cheap outing!"
Kathie s.,"Bellevue, WA",28,314,227,4.0,1/10/2014,I was given a gift card to applebee's and decided to try it out for happy hour.  What a great atmosphere!  The bartender was excellent and beer price was great.   The appetizers were half  price from the happy hour list.  We tried the fried greeen beans and the pretzels which both were excellent and all vegetarian.   We were greeted by the management team and made to feel welcomed.   This was a pleasant surprise as honestly I would have never gone in if we had not had a gift card. Great experience.
Morgan L.,"Seattle, WA",198,587,835,4.0,12/6/2012,"This is a nice Applebee's! My boyfriend and I like Applebee's because they have decent wings for cheap (Happy hour) and I personally could eat the oriental chicken wrap everyday of my life. The food is solid here, and the staff are overly nice.  I think they are trying to step it up because they have added new menu items. We tried the pretzels with cheese dip- wow, really good and surprisingly fresh, warm pretzels! We also had to order the fried green beans, while they were good they were a little too stringy for fried beans (if you've had these at different places you'll know what I mean). We may order this again, but doubt it. Pretzels, we would totally order again! They have TVs in every corner so my Dad watched the game while I talked his ear off.  I have been to a number of different Applebees and this is by far the best I have been to."
Mikayla H.,"Renton, WA",0,4,,5.0,4/23/2015,I come here with my friends probably 2 times a week during happy hour. Scott and his wait staff do an incredible job at making us feel warm and welcome every time we come in. It is seriously the best service in town!
Karen L.,"Seattle, WA",296,904,341,3.0,4/12/2013,"The BF and I had finished working out at 24 Hour Fitness just across the street and it was already 9:00 PM and we didn't feel like cooking dinner, so we decided to eat at Applebee's. Honestly, the food here is just okay. I got the baby back ribs, which were pretty good. BF got the Cajun shrimp and steak, which was okay. We also tried the French onion soup and tomato basil soup, two of our favorite soups, but we weren't wowed by any of it. Dessert, however, was pretty amazing. We ordered the triple chocolate meltdown, which is a fluffy and moist chocolate cake with chocolate drizzled over it. It was very good, and came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The food here isn't anything amazing (although the desserts are delicious--but how can you mess that up?), but it's not a bad place for happy hour."
Kristin C.,"Issaquah, WA",312,689,30,3.0,7/30/2012,"I went into Applebee's expecting it to be the worst thing ever. Honestly. I haven't been to an Applebee's in years. I used to go a lot in college because they had Happy Hour that started at 9, and that's when I got off work across the street. But the food was always so disgusting, I refused to go back.  When Allie S and I decided to get shitfaced on a Saturday night because we were bored, we decided on Applebee's. My plan was to be a complete asshole and get kicked out, but I ended up actually planning on going back.  Sure, the food is still crap, always has been and always will be. I will only order their 1/2 price appetizers during HH, and will never order an entree here. We had some nachos, potato skins, and chicken wings. Most of them were ok, the chicken wings were pretty gross, I ended up just using them as a way to shovel bleu cheese dressing into my mouth. BUT, the food is cheap. It was like $13 total for all that food. Plus, when you're drunk, it doesn't matter as much.  Drinking is the reason to come here, surprisingly, they don't mess up alcohol. I had 3 long island iced teas which are $4 during HH, and for an extra $1 I got top shelf booze and more of it. I also had some sort of huge 32 oz beer which I drank with a straw, gangsta' style(really, white girl college style). They have 2 HH 3-6 and 9-close, everyday.  The real reason to come back though is the service, our server Andrew was fantastic. Nice, great at is job, funny, and cute! He ordered and held more drinks for us before HH ended, he was very friendly and spent a lot of time joking around with us, and even started being inappropriate with us(which had nothing to do with alcohol).  If you have zero expectations coming in here, and just plan on boozing it up, this really isn't *that* horrible of a place. Apparently you can get 30 chicken wings for $11 during HH.... so we plan on having the boys have a chicken wing eating contest, while Allie and I drink a lot."
Natasha J.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,4,1,1.0,8/6/2014,"I ordered a salad, and they gave me half a head of lettuce with some feta cheese sprinkled on top. They couldn't even be bothered to break it up into a salad!"
