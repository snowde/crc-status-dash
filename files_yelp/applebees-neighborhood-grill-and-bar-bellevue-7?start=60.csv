Tiffany S.,"Seattle, WA",395,295,38,4.0,11/24/2014,The bartendars are awesome at this location. Super friendly and not weird friendly like they're trying to hit on you. A lot of locals at this location so it really is like an episode of Cheers sometimes. But this is definitely an experience I haven't had at all Applebee's. If I'm in the area I'll definitely be stopping by this location.
Sarah B.,"Bothell, WA",1,3,1,4.0,12/31/2014,"This place is great! The service is always fast, friendly, and the servers as well as the managers really care about good service. We love coming here, the tacos are delicious! Dinner is always good and drinks are yummy too! We have been to this location for dinner several times, this time we had Sierra, I think, and she was delightful! Came here on new years exhausted and everyone was in such a good mood it was refreshing! Definitely will be back again soon!"
Kristen B.,"Redmond, WA",158,159,27,1.0,3/1/2012,"I really dislike giving bad reviews... but seriously. Applebees.... Some of the most unappetizing food I have ever eaten in my entire life. Although the staff was extremely friendly and promptly sat us at a booth, the food was just horrendous. My better half and I ordered a few appetizers and were not pleased. A friend told us that the steak was surprisingly good, so we ordered it... Unfortunately... The steak looked as though it was broiled in the oven, or microwave, with grill marks added on at the end with some sort of heated cooking utensil. One bite was all we could stomach. Fortunately, the dog was hungry enough to eat all the leftovers. We promised ourselves that we would never be back. What a dissapointment."
Danelle S.,"Kenmore, WA",0,3,,4.0,9/23/2015,"Wow, went here with a huge group of people today with out giving them notice  and the waitress ( Agapia) and the manager( Andrew May) really came through for us.The food was amazing! We were celebrating a coworkers anniversary  and they even offered him a sundae! thank you!"
May P.,"Bellevue, WA",0,4,,1.0,2/4/2015,"This Applebee's was super disappointing. Starting with the food, the 'ribs' were more like scraps of chicken thrown underneath some fries. The black and bleu burger was the greasiest thing I'd ever eaten,  and the bacon on it tasted like cardboard. The shrimp fettuccini was completely bland alongside drenching it in sauce. Personally, I would never eat here again."
Liliane E.,"Keaau, HI",74,377,353,2.0,8/6/2013,"The staff here is extremely inattentive, and don't care about being helpful. Came here for happy hour with my husband, and found that even just ordering drinks was a chore for these ladies. The atmosphere is the Applebees status quo, nothing more nothing less. The staff seemed more interested in having social hour amongst themselves than engaging the patrons."
Buffy H.,"Redmond, WA",6,4,,4.0,1/16/2014,Great staff!  It is full of locals and you need to earn your place at the bar. But love it.
Judy K.,"Bellevue, WA",271,76,16,2.0,5/12/2011,"I only come here when my friends when we are feeling like getting uber cheap happy hour.  I haven't hit up this place very often since high school.  However, I usually go to the Factoria location which I personally think is better.  Why? Service is usually spotty at Applebees, but that night when I went with friends, it was especially bad.  Maybe its just this location.  The server took almost 20 minutes to get our drinks.  Finally she came back and we scurried to order.   When the food came out, the portions were MUCH smaller than the ones served at the Factoria location.  Usually I wouldn't care, but I was with a large party that night, so it was disappointing.   On my own free will, I don't think I would return, but sometimes greasy food really does hit the spot especially when the prices are so low."
Link P.,"North Bend, WA",10,79,3,3.0,9/26/2013,"This is the place a usually boycott because service here is usually bad.  When you sit in the bar seaction and the bartender doesn't even acknowledge you...NOT GOOD.  This time we sat in the regular section, it was better.  We like the food alot and they have Blue Moon on tap, very nice.  It's one of those things I guess, you just never know about the staff and their committment to service."
Christine W.,"Bothell, WA",58,2,1,5.0,3/10/2015,"The best of all Applebee's!  Despite the fact that they still allow kids..... we still love it! ;)  We came for the happy hour and keep coming back for the service!  Shaun has provided exemplary service and all the staff is kind, knowledgeable and customer oriented.  Jory has to be one of the most outgoing and welcoming bartenders."
Tristyn T.,"South Salt Lake, UT",14,31,,1.0,2/20/2011,I came in for lunch on a weekday. They did not appear to be busy. I was sat promptly and waited for a server to come by. I sat for 15 minutes and servers walked right past me but did not acknowledge me. I tried flagging someone down but to no avail. I left.  Can't comment on the food because I didn't eat it.
Amos Y.,"Bellevue, WA",134,245,738,3.0,5/5/2013,"Went there for happy hour, and ordered a bunch of half-off appetizers. Recommend the nachos, and wings. The cheese on the nachos doesn't seem high quality, but it tasted fine. The wings were quite tasty, got the honey BBQ as well as the original ones. Service was quick and snappy, though the waiter did try to sell a bunch of various drinks to us. But once we said no, he was good about not asking anymore."
Jon E.,"Paris, France",107,331,211,1.0,3/21/2011,"My girlfriend and I came in here a while back, thinking we'd check it out since they advertise on TV all the time.  Turns out everything is either: * Deep-fried * Covered in melted cheese * A burger with cheese and deep-fried stuff on top * Really boring and unappetizing I was surprised, but I couldn't find anything I wanted to eat.  We left and drove back to Seattle.  I think we ate some yummy and relatively healthy Italian food instead."
Kumiko M.,"Issaquah, WA",248,96,19,3.0,3/21/2011,"I used to come here quite often with my high school buddies back when I was a senior since our high school was just a few miles down the road. It's not really one of those places you'd go to for 'fine dining', but if you're looking for a nice casual place to roll up your sleeves and eat a burger (or veggie burger), wings, ribs, or whatever deal they've got going on (I swear Applebees is always having sweet deals for certain days of the week), then you can't go wrong with Applebees. Oh and since it's an east side restaurant, it has it's own private lot... can't stress how much I hate street parking.  Service has always been super friendly, for me, at least. They usually seat you quick, since I've never seen the restaurant terribly full. Aside from being another chain restaurant, I have nothing against Applebees."
Misty N.,"Renton, WA",138,275,64,5.0,9/17/2012,"Other than the other yelpers....I have always had a GREAT experience every time I come in here! There is always daily specials for some good drinks and meal deals. The servers are always friendly and quick. You have to keep in mind, it is a chain restaurant."
Kevin P.,"Diamond Bar, CA",128,193,83,3.0,5/21/2013,I would only ever come here for happy hour. That being said I love the sliders. They serve it on great bread and fries. If you don't like fresh onions then be sure to order no onions because they pile it on. I suggest adding the bacon.
Marilee O.,"Bellevue, WA",0,5,,1.0,1/28/2013,"We ordered to go!  Went to park at curbside and people were parked in it.  When asked why it was not enforced, we were told they get too busy to monitor.  We ordered six dinners at 6:00 pm on a Sunday night.  Three of the dinners were double crunch shrimp meals.  It was awful.  Some shrimp were okay while most tasted like freezer burned.  That means frozen food that has been left too long in freezer.  French fries were soggy.  I do not recommend them."
Julia Z.,"Bellevue, WA",561,589,586,1.0,2/15/2007,"I'll be blunt: I hate Applebee's. This location is no better than any other; mediocre food, slow service, and prices that aren't justified by the food or dining experience. Honestly, why would you eat here when a few blocks away, you can get a fantastic burger (Wibbley's  ), a great almost-anything-for-the-kids (Red Robin), a good drink (Firenze  ), or real Mexican (Tu Casa  )? Last time I ate here with co-workers, I chose the fajitas, figuring that they HAD to be safe from a food-allergy standpoint... nope. Somehow they had soy in them too and I was in allergy hell... I've already established that their fried chicken and their bread have soy flour in them, making them off-limits to me. Yuck. Their mixed drinks are really overpriced for the weak libations you get, and good luck if you want lime in your soda."
Taylor M.,"Seattle, WA",0,34,,4.0,5/21/2011,"I have never been a huge fan of Applebee's, but my wife has always likes it; so we go there from time to time.  This was our first time at this Applebee's, and I can say we were both pleasantly surprised.  Doors opened for us, seated within 10 minutes, and our server was at our table in a timely fashion.  We ordered the boneless Buffalo Wings (classic buffalo sauce), Bourbon Street Chicken and shrimp and an order of Three Cheese Chicken Penne for the wife.   The wings were bought out fast, had a good buffalo taste, not too hot but had some kick.  Chicken was moist and all white meat.  The breading was crunchy, but not too thick or over cooked.  We both were surprised at the quality and how well it was cooked.  A Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp was great.  It has Sautéed mushroom and onions over a large piece of chicken breast that was perfectly cooked, with shrimp sprinkled over the dish.  The side was a southwest style baked potato pieces that was fantastic.  Everything was cooked spot on and tasted great.  Applebee's really surprised me with this.  A+ The wife's Three Cheese Chicken Penne was pretty good.  She liked it, but not quite as in love as I was with my dinner.  Penne was cooked just right, chicken was moist had a good seasoning.  The sauce was creamy with the right amount of cheese taste and the side Pico that came with it was matched perfectly.  A We only had two hiccups.  First was that we had to ask for water.  Not a huge deal since we had grabbed drinks from the bar while waiting, but something that was noticed.  Second one was our second round of drinks were a little slow.  Apparently there was some confusion between the bartender and the waiter.  We got our drinks and an apology after a 5 minute wait.  Again, neither are big issues to us, but enough to drop it down to a 4 star rating.   Overall, we really enjoyed it and plan to be regular customers if the food and price continue to be excellent.  The 2 for $20 was an excellent deal and we will try it again on our next visit."
Glenn S.,"Bellevue, WA",353,283,247,5.0,5/17/2010,This by far better then the Factoria Applebees. I'm so much closer to the Factoria one but the staff here rocks. The quality of the food is prepared at this location better as well. The best thing that they got rid of was the Chimmi Chessecake. The drinks are great! Bar staff rocks! Try the pretzel sticks! Yummy
