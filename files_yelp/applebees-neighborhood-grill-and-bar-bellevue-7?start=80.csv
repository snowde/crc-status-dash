Lilly T.,"Seattle, WA",71,182,41,3.0,9/23/2009,"Good happy hour specials here! From 3-6 pm and 9-close, appetizer's are 1/2 off and to be honest, one appetizer could feed at least 2 people. Nothing here is healthy so I pretty much feel guilty leaving the restaurant every time, but it is well worth it! I'm a big fan of their chicken quesadillas and the boy likes their boneless wings w/ classic sauce :). Portions are extremely generous so we always end up with leftovers. Always good service at this location and good classic American food!"
Kat R.,"Redmond, WA",62,135,169,3.0,2/3/2010,"Just got out of here. Let me preface the review by stating the service was great and the waitress was attentive. Also, my fiance *loved* the steak. I have to say, even though it was well done (which I hate) it was still quite tasty and not ""shoe leather"" like most of them are.  That said... this place gets 3 stars. Even though D's was good, my salad was just okay. We also had the artichoke dip -- bad idea. I've started realizing that I just can't eat greasy food. Was that an extra coat of grease just for me? Why thank you! In all, I will probably be back. Hey, its Applebee's! But, I think I may try their more healthful options. Lately, I've realized the wisdom of saving my artery clogging for the important things... like Shorty's hot dogs."
Flora C.,"Seattle, WA",21,808,2653,3.0,1/31/2010,"We were there for your Happy Hour and order Chicken Quesa.  WHen the bill arrived, it was showing $5.00 but the menu stated that it only cost $7.99.  The waitress explained that the chicken cost AB extra and there for it costed more.  If that is the case, why this price discrepancy not stated in your menu.  Your company just asume the consumer will figure it out or will never pay attention to only a dollar difference.  This is wrong and dishonest.  I am writing and hoping that your company will clarify this misleading information to the public.  The waitress was a great server until she had to explain the ""chicken costed us more and if we don't charge extra we will be lossing money...""  As a consumer, I don't care how you make money from me but I demand true and honest information."
Blue A.,"Issaquah, WA",0,21,32,3.0,1/20/2013,"We ordered two steak and salad, the service is very well, they will ask you what do you want more , I choose mushroom and I get it."
Nancy S.,"Brockport, NY",3,10,,4.0,2/21/2013,"I visit this Applebees often. On Monday it was particularly nice visit. I tried their new Deep Fried Green Beans appetizer which were excellent! Our server was friendly, I have never had an issue with that before but she had a great personality and made time for us. I will remain a regular at this location!"
Liz M.,"Seattle, WA",101,454,9,3.0,8/1/2011,"Traffic sucked and I was trapped on the Eastside and craving one of Applebee's oriental chicken salads.  I find that I am generally happy with food ordered from Applebee's if I stick to the salads, and disappointed otherwise.  My salad hit the spot, the host at the door was almost alarmingly friendly, and my waiter did a great job at swinging by to check on me.  Unfortunately, my lime margarita on the rocks was terrible and drops this from a 4 to a 3."
Miae A.,"Bellevue, WA",119,22,5,3.0,12/7/2013,"I have to admit that getting a free meal for my family of six definitely improved my rating.  Service was very slow tonight and the kitchen was confused.  We waited over 30 minutes to get our appetizers and salads.  The worst part was that our entrees arrived within minutes of receiving our appetizers.  When we commented to the server, the assistant manager (?) came out to see us.  He wasn't especially helpful, but offered to take our entrees back to re do them so that they would be hot when we ate them.  My parents hadn't gotten though 1/4 of their salad so they took him up on this offer.  But than there food didn't arrive until after the rest of my family was done eating.  The general manager Andrew May saved the day by comping our meal.  That was a very pleasant surprise.  The food is tasty and I have finally found some healthy options.  While my family chows down on 1000 calorie appetizers I can keep it healthy with a tasty entree."
GiJeuk J.,"Kirkland, WA",160,82,40,2.0,4/12/2012,"I should have known better when I walked in and all the people at the tables were under 20. I've been to Applebees before but it was never as distracting as this one. The people near our seat talked so loud and were distruptive the whole time. Our waiter didn't come for a really long time and forgot to even set out water for us. We finally ordered our food and when I got my order it was wrong. After asking for the correct plate he quickly grabbed the manager who came to appologize and bring the right order. I would be really ticked off if the poor guy wasn't practically in high school and overwhelmed with all the other tables around us. At that point I chose to take pity on him and tip him well and thank him for the time. I will be back to applebees, but never to this one again. Thank goodness for one in the Factoria area!"
Michael S.,"Sammamish, WA",1,213,,4.0,4/16/2012,"Am I the only person who thinks there's nothing wrong with Applebees? The drinks were strong, the food was fine, and they have a lot of tasty, healthy options (including steaks) under 550 calories.  Good luck finding low calorie options that aren't vegetarian/vegan from local restaurants - chains tend to do well with that kind of thing.  My steak was far from the best I've ever had, but it was good enough for the price that I paid. Service was good too.  I'd definitely come back for a happy hour or lunch.  It isn't Daniels Broiler but at the same time it's definitely better than Denny's so I don't understand the flak they're getting in many of the reviews here."
Bob N.,"Bellevue, WA",0,5,,4.0,3/10/2014,"The dark beer selection is always weak.  The burgers are real good, and the new waitress, Cora, is very nice and really hustles.  So, 2,4 and a 5 round out to a 4 (good job Cora!) for this Applebee's."
John G.,"Issaquah, WA",0,88,,4.0,11/17/2011,"Had early dinner there 11-16-11. On their 2/20+app my wife had the steak/shrimp, I had the chicken pasta, we shared Onion rings, and she had a small Caesar salad. Very good, surprisingly good. Our waiter was a tall young guy, very pleasant, quitely attentive. The place wasn't busy so perhaps we got the benefit of that. As to the food, the side salad was quite large, very fresh, quite good. The onion rings are the best I've had in over 50 years, her steak was terrific, and my pasta was very good. So we'll be back to this one. Our experience was not quite as good at the Factoria store."
Betsy H.,"Seattle, WA",185,149,29,4.0,4/2/2008,"You know, I rarely have a bad experience here, granted it's generally for lunch or the occasional after work drink since it's so close to the showroom. I know, I know... Applebees... so many other places you can go Betsy! But honestly, some times I just want to get a bowl of French Onion soup and a basket of fries (total cost about $6) or they have a great ""Pick 2"" lunch menu."
Michael T.,"East Glacier Park, MT",2,14,,1.0,6/1/2010,"Although I'm not a fan of Applebee's generally, I've always had a decent, if overpriced meal.  That is until I had the misfortune to step into the Bel-Red Applebee's.  Three times. The first time, I was alone, late on a Sunday evening.  The restaurant wasn't that busy but clearly they were short on staff, and so I forgave the quite abysmal service. The meal, on the other hand, was unforgivable.  The burger, ordered medium, arrived after 25 minutes.  It had clearly been in the grill for 23 of those minutes.  I've had charred burgers before, but never one that was charred through to the centre.  The bun was completely untoasted, all the better to reveal the stale to the point of mold age.  The fries were your typical fast food frozen fry, and, sadly, the only food worth consuming.  The manager was completely unresponsive to my polite observations when, during checkout, he asked how my meal had been.  Several months later, when hungry and in need of a quick meal out late on a Saturday, and against my better judgment, I again gave this Applebee's another try.  This time, the service was better (actually quite good service, very attentive), and the food hadn't been as thoroughly abused as my first visit, but it still ranked as bad food, carelessly prepared.  Again, the manager (different from my first visit) asked how my meal had been.  I complemented the server before I provided a kind but accurate assessment of the food.  He thanked me for my comments about my waiter as he swiped my card and ignored my comments about the food.  Please don't blame me for giving this Applebee's the third try:  I had carpooled with friends to a play, and they wanted to have a post-performance meal here.  I attempted to dine defensively (soup and salad) but once again, I fell victim to what has to be one of the most incompetent kitchens (or perhaps I should say uncaring managements) in all of Washington. The next time friends want to eat here, I'm calling a taxi."
Tim S.,"Bellevue, WA",39,24,1,2.0,9/12/2011,"Nice location, friendly staff, but every Applebees I've eaten at just has the same fairly tasteless food, with high calories and unhealthy menu.  And the Bellevue location is no exception."
Ian L.,"Renton, WA",6,14,1,5.0,7/4/2007,"My name is Ian L., and I am addicted to Applebee's Happy Hour wings.  I'll admit it, sometimes I go two, three times a week on a carnivorous rampage, leaving nothing but a 5"" tall lincoln-log cabin of discarded bone and gristle in my wake. Not even the celery survives.  The people I work with: also addicts. A week without wings, we show signs of withdrawal. Now we can't even order wings anywhere else without a feeling of infidelity gripping our hearts. And at like $10 for 30 wings? Delicious, tangy-hot classic-sauce drenched wings? Or perhaps the salivation-inducing honey barbecue, with the power to negate otherwise fiery aftermath, even at a 2-to-1 ratio? The value is as inescapable as the flavor.  I got hooked with Wing Dome... that's where I got my first fix. And Wingdome IS excellent, arguably the best, especially with the variety of flavors. But when you've got this hunger for like, 15-45 wings a week, at a dollar a wing you're practically on the crack-smoker's road to poverty. And really, nobody should be giving blow-jobs for wings. Cut that down to about $0.33/ wing, and you've got a habit you can live with. I don't come to Applebee's for burgers, or kid food, or drinks, or Mexican. I come for the super-cheap, delicious wings, and at this point, it's hardly a choice.  So I warn you: If you like wings, beer, and don't want to break the bank, avoid this place like the plague, or you'll practically be living here."
Janine S.,"Bellevue, WA",24,85,88,2.0,8/18/2010,Wanted to grab lunch with a friend near his work so we decided on Applebees. Service was okay - the waitress got the order right and was cordial but you could tell that she didn't really want to be there (I guess who could blame her).  We ordered a Bacon burger and Salad/soup combo which took a long time to come out for just 2 orders.  Didn't taste the burger myself but my friend said it was okay. My oriental salad on the other hand was kind of sad... the leaves weren't exactly fresh and was drenched in sauce... and it was warm.  The chicken tortilla soup was just okay too.  Next time I'll do my research first before eating here again since there's probably better restaurant options nearby.
Gunjan N.,"Bellevue, WA",0,12,2,4.0,11/23/2009,"After reading poor review for the factoria Applebees we decided to try the bel-red rd Applebees. Here it goes:  1) Arrival and Seating  We went their on a Friday evening and there was wait if you need booth but non-booth seating was readily available We were greeted by both the lady on the door and guy on the front desk. We were seated within 10 minutes.  2)Ordering  After we were seated the server (her name starts with A) was right away there and started offering the specials etc. We told her we will try 2 for $20, she said sure are you ready to order then? we said sure and ordered right away.  3) Food Arrival  Food arrived in an acceptable time and appetizers and entrees had almost exact time gap in between,  4) Food quality,quantity and test  Food seemed fresh and was served hot. I was so full with the appetizer itself that when the entree came we told our server ""A"" to pack mine fro to-go and she readily did that with a smile. we shared the other entree. The entree and appetizer were real dinner size and not as we thought previously that will be smallas we ordered a special 2 for $20. 5) Billing  Billing was on time and there was a special hand written thanks from the server. Our bill with dessert came around $30 including tip which is reasonable. 6)Departure  Last but no least every staff we met on our way out thanked us.  I gave 4 start and not 5 just because the server never asked for dessert we have to order ti on our own, the reason could be she was thinking that we were already stuffed;) as we took a whole entree to go.  Overall a great dine-out experience , much better than what you expect from traditional chain diners.  Thanks for reading , hope your experience is as great as ours. ."
Chris D.,"Tacoma, WA",8,19,,1.0,1/1/2010,"I didn't have very high expectations for Applebee's from the start.  I realize that it's a chain restaurant that specializes in comfort food, and it may be good when viewed from that perspective but my review is based on their lower calorie menu options. I prefer to eat pretty healthy and it's hard to find good places to go out to eat that have healthy choices, but I thought it would be worth giving Applebee's a shot after hearing that they have some lower calorie choices and weight watchers points shown for some menu items.  I ended up choosing one of the dishes with the weight watchers points shown called Garlic Herb Chicken.  It was horrible.  The chicken was totally drenched in sauce that was way too strong and incredibly salty. The potatoes and veggies that came with it also appeared to be drenched in oil or butter so I was kind of doubting that the meal was really as low in fat and calories as shown on the menu.  I couldn't even finish it, it was just too gross. If this meal was representative of the healthy choices they offer, Applebee's should forget it and stick to the usual comfort food that they probably do a lot better."
Miranda L.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",3,97,1,2.0,12/22/2008,"I had to knock a star after trying out the breakfast this past Sunday. Not that it was the worst experience ever, but it just wasn't that good. We saw the advertising card during happy hour one day and decided to give it a try. First off, the place was completely empty. There were maybe two or three parties spread out through the restaurant. We thought we had really scored as the lady sat us. There was some rather obnoxious kid that belonged to a waitress that would randomly shout out things toward the kitchen whenever he got bored. I understand because of the weather, mom probably didn't have a choice but to bring him to work, but it was still mildly irritating. So we could deal with that, no problem. Then about five minutes into the thing, these old people come walking up, apparently the regulars in the booth RIGHT NEXT TO US. I don't mind having to sit right next to people when a restaurant is full and there is a lot of noise, but once again, there were maybe 3 parties in the entire place. If they have regulars and an empty restaurant, then why did we have to sit right next to the stupid regulars booth? They were loud because they were four old people, and we all know they have to speak loudly about annoying old people gossip, practically shouting to hear each other talk about boring old people gossip. Yuck. So we were instantly annoyed. Not a problem if the place had been busy, but it was empty. So we moved ourselves a couple of tables away. I think the staff was annoyed that we moved, but we didn't care. They didn't say anything, but you can see their customer service veneer fade slightly, and the lady hardly checked on us, even though we were only two tables away now instead of one from her regulars, and she was checking up on them about twice as much. Okay, the other thing that really irritated us... the mimosas took FOREVER to get to us. We could even see the guy making them after about five minutes of standing around. Then after he made them, it took him a while to even start meandering over to us. Tasty, though, I have to admit. The food was meh... okay... I don't recommend getting anything with too much egg to it. I felt the eggs were kind of gross, and the hashbrowns had the taste of being cooked with bad oil or on a dirty grill or something. It appears that they put the rookie staff on during Sundays, because there were people constantly being trained, or people that seemed like they didn't quite know what they were supposed to be doing. Basically, Applebee's should just stick with the Happy Hour and mediocre dinner thing. The boy might want to go back for breakfast, but I would rather run through the drive-thru and make my own mimosas next time."
Brittany F.,"Kirkland, WA",1,7,,3.0,1/31/2012,"Cheap, friendly and fast at lunch.  Average prices for dinner.  Very comparable for the area.  The food is just what you would expect.  Some of it tastes fresh out of the bag it came from but sometimes something is surprisingly good.  I will go here when I am going out to eat with a lot of people or people with kids.  Lots of selection, something for everyone."
