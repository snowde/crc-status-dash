Bob E.,"Blaine, WA",0,10,,5.0,7/8/2017,"The wife and I for a change ordered the same item from the menu, it was a chicken and shrimp dish that was cooked to perfection, very tasty and well priced. The staff were atentive but not overly just right. A great job well done folks. We will be back"
PJ S.,"Lynden, WA",78,80,197,2.0,1/1/2018,"I'm so bummed to review this way. Per usual, I'll always have positive feedback as well.  My family and I love dining with Applebee's, and their multiple locations. They have always met my expectations and held their reputation.   Our location here has me scratching my head. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by our host in a timely manner. The restaurant was slightly less occupied than expected, so were we happy to be brought to our table in just a short while.  Brandon, our server was a younger waiter, friendly, and knowledgeable of the menu. We ordered our drinks and appetizer, chips and salsa. The kitchen was out of apple juice for the kids, so they enjoyed chocolate milk instead. I had hot chamomile tea, and hubby had a water. Our appetizer, arrived with warm tortilla chips and what tasted like a jar of store bought salsa. This was clearly NOT made in house. It was thick and dry. Not what we remember this dish to taste like. Hubby and I ordered from the 2/$26 menu. Mine, was the meat and potatoes, that tasted alright. The potatoes tasted real fresh, the fried onions were crunchy and the beef was cooked through. Hubby's dish tasted ok too. However, our daughter's kids meal, chicken strips and mozzarella sticks, were completely inedible, that she refused to eat them. I thought they tasted like frozen, store bought cheese sticks, and over cooked/fried chicken. Our other kid's meal was two sliders and applesauce. It arrived as a small patty stuffed in an oversized bread roll and cut in half.  I usually don't criticize the ambiance and loudness of other dining guests, but because we were seated next to the bar area with only a short divider, we were able to hear their conversations!  It was a bit too loud. Which made for an unpleasant experience."
Amanda G.,"Whatcom County, WA",6,13,1,1.0,12/30/2017,This used to be the husband and my favorite restaurant to go to especially after shopping excursions but time and time again the past year or so their service SUCKS!! It was so bad and their food is almost inedible..... their steaks are tough their chicken is chewy their pasta is burnt it's just terrible and their customer service did I mention is terrible terrible terrible terrible.... the server it seemed was too busy flirting with the bartender!!!! And even worse the back of house staff were sitting in the lobby laughing and joking so loud it was distracting..... so NOT coming back to this place again....it was just ridiculous!!!
Kevin H.,"Bellingham, WA",0,1,,1.0,8/29/2017,"Wow!! What happened to Applebees?  We've had carside-to-go numerous times, it's always pretty good. Tonight we both had steaks, they were inedible. I started by sharpening my steak knife, thinking it had gone dull, but not so. Once I had sawed off a small chunk, I could not chew it enough to swallow it...toughest steak I have ever tried to eat. It's in the garbage.  Even the fries were chewy. The green beans, on the other hand were absolutely delicious, but so over cooked that I didn't need to chew.  Part of me is tempted to give them another chance, but with so much good food in Bellingham, why bother?  Sorry Applebee's, this is ""Goodbye"". Thanks for the good meals you used to cook for us :-("
Sheri C.,"Seattle, WA",210,1826,1610,3.0,3/1/2017,"My husband and I came into this Applebee's and the food was really bad, but the waiter and manager made up for it so giving this place 3 stars for how they handled the situation.  I wouldn't return here. First, the menu has changed dramatically - there's only 1 pasta dish, only 4 burgers, and many other things are really limited or completely gone.  The waiter told us they were getting another new menu in about a week. I ordered their burger with a fried egg and hashbrowns which I didn't want but didn't see anything else I did.  The waiter said if I didn't like it, he'd get something else for me at no charge.  My husband ordered a plain burger. My burger arrived and looked pretty pink after I cut it in half.  I ate a couple bites then saw that the entire middle was raw.  I told the waiter who had the manager come over and she offered to get me anything else.  We were trying to get to a family engagement/service so I asked for chicken fingers thinking they would be easy and fast to cook.  They were, but they didn't taste good.   The waiter comped both entrees for us because of this. Tried to pay with the kiosk on the table and it wasn't working. The door was held open for us when we got there and the manager raced us to the door to open it for us as we left and thanked us for coming. Food: 1 Service: 5 Ambiance: 3 Parking: 3"
Jen B.,"Vancouver, Canada",71,274,458,3.0,10/13/2016,"I've always seen the adverts for Applebees, this was my first time here.  It's casual dining. Normally we'd go to Shari's for a meal but it was closed for renovations so we decided try Applebees. The menu isn't out of ordinary. It's your burgers, steaks, salads - etc. I had a pasta dish with grilled chicken. It wasn't bad. I didn't care for the balsamic vinegar mixed with tomatoes the used as a garnish. Each table is equipped with a portable tablet. It's used to call your server, play games, place your order, see the specials and pay for your meal. I'm not a fan of this gizmo.  To be honest it's not hygienic. I never saw anyone wiping them down. Use them if you dare. My tip: if there are two if you dining it's best to turn to the back of the menu. There you will find dinners for two $25. You get an appetizer and two main dish. What a deal! No complaints, it's okay. Applebees please get rid of those gizmos, it's a germ magnet!"
Jeremy R.,"Bellingham, WA",0,3,,1.0,11/14/2017,The customer service there is terrible. TERRIBLE!!! I was treated so poorly and am really offended and hurt. I just wanted to cry because she was such an ashore!! I wish they could fire her. She's there always and every single time I just want to request a different server.  ****Updated I went there the other night and yet again I wish I could give a -100 stars.
Jan B.,"Bellingham, WA",29,172,28,4.0,3/20/2017,"Hadn't been here for a couple of years.  They have new menu with many pages of selections...almost overwhelming.  We were here on prime time Friday evening and the place was nearly empty.  I like the ""light"" section of their menu.  Many tasty, healthy, low calorie options.  I had the spicy Thai shrimp salad.  It was huge and very good!  My partner had the salmon with sweet potatoes.  Very generous portions."
Danielle K.,"Vancouver, Canada",111,185,444,3.0,12/7/2015,"I've been to this Applebee's countless times before, and I must say one thing: the food quality here is quite variable. Sometimes you get really delicious & well-prepared dishes, but other times the dishes come out tasting pretty bad.  On our most recent visit, we stopped in for a late dinner (around 9ish pm). We had the ""2 for $20"" special - an appetizer to share, and 2 entrées.  The appetizer we chose was the mozzarella sticks. Sadly it was not really well-prepared this time, with the cheese being kinda hard instead of soft & gooey (we have had this here before). I would probably go with the boneless wings next time around, as I've found that they don't seem to mess up on that dish as much.  The entrées we chose this time were the chicken tenders & the cedar grilled lemon chicken. The chicken tenders were pretty hard and overcooked. Lots of breaded crust & not much actual chicken meat. The fries were alright. The cedar grilled lemon chicken, on the other hand, was pretty good. It was served with tasty basmati rice, and topped with cubed green apple bits.  They offer a different selection of dishes in the ""2 for $25"" special, of which I've tried and liked the double crunch shrimp, and the mac & cheese with honey pepper chicken tenders. Service is generally OK here. They also have a tablet (at each table) from which you can order, call for your server, or play games. All games are locked behind a pay wall. I believe it was $1.99 per play? Not too sure of the pricing as the selection of games didn't really interest me. All in, decent value for the food & service you get, with a nice small town family restaurant ambience. Will probably be back again when I'm next in the neighbourhood."
Olga K.,"Bellingham, WA",342,13,17,3.0,4/18/2016,"Quality of food: I could be wrong but it tastes and looks as if it's just microwaved frozen food. I've tasted and prepared enough food to distinguish a huge difference between the two. This is why I usually  pass up the meals and meats and just stick with appetizers. Soft pretzels are choice.  Service: No complaints. Always greeted warmly and seated promptly. There is one young lady that stands out, she only greets and seats people I believe. I didn't catch her name. She is full of energy and always looks as if it's just the best day of her life. That is a very rare kind. My respect.  Couple more things Id like to add. The seating is great. Plenty of booths (my favorite), and subtle lighting, gives it a comfortable warm atmosphere."
Donna N.,"Surrey, Canada",109,96,48,1.0,8/27/2017,food is so bland and really is nothing special. bad service i would never go or recommend this place
Alexandra R.,"Bellingham, WA",72,9,3,1.0,5/3/2017,"We used to dine regularly at Applebee's. This Applebee's provides terrible customer service. We've tried giving them a second chance and it was just as bad. A bunch of ditsy, inattentive teenagers running the place. We even did the survey and explained our bad experience but got no response and no one attempted to rectify the situation. We will never go back."
Leena K.,"Bellingham, WA",262,8,2,1.0,6/8/2017,I don't know why we continue to go back and try again. I ordered the steak and shrimp. I got my steak and broccoli but the waitress messed up my order so they were cooking the shrimp right away for me. I was pretty much done with the rest of my food when the shrimp arrived. It was seriously raw and covered with whatever they were supposed to cook it with to the point it was a big puddle on the plate. Trying to get the attention of the waitress was pointless. She finally came and asked if I wanted something else. No thank you. They did give me $5 off my meal... But who can't cook shrimp?  My husbands meal wasn't very good either. Food came inconsistent temperatures. Macaroni and cheese was disgusting. Not cheesy (or warm) at all. I will try to remember to never go back.
Brad H.,"Kirkland, WA",234,971,114,3.0,3/22/2015,"The food quality here is consistent, it is fresh and full of flavor. I enjoy there new pick your own appetizer meal- it allows for a good selection of small bites at a decent price. The new table tablet that allows you to order drink refills on demand and pay your bill with an email copy of the receipt is a great addition.  The lack of a stars comes from that service can be hit or miss- it is never bad- but there are very clearly employees here who just don't care. There is one associate who I had who was great- the other ones (bar area) just do not seem to care in the afternoons about their guests."
Chris K.,"Bellevue, WA",98,10,,3.0,3/7/2017,Been here multiple times and every time we either seat ourselves or wait for minutes with no host... And it's not busy.  Wait staff is under par on the smile points... What helps is that the food is pretty good compared to other Applebee's.
Ron W.,"Ferndale, WA",0,87,,1.0,7/23/2017,"Stopped here this afternoon for a late lunch (3:30pm) Seated right away. Only a few other customers in the restaurant. Waitress came and asked if we wanted drinks. Ordered a beer and coffee. A few minutes later here comes the drinks. At that point we placed our order. After ten minutes our drinks were empty and no waitress in sight. I decided to push the ""call server"" button at the table. After five more minutes here comes the waitress. I ask for more drinks. Five minutes later she returns with my beer, but the coffee? ""Sorry, we have to make another pot, so it will be a bit"" WTF? Shouldn't your first clue to make more be when your customer orders the first cup? Food was cold and way too expensive. We won't be back."
Stephanie T.,"Richmond, Canada",85,152,2788,4.0,4/27/2014,"My friend and I decided to stop by on our same-day states trip as we wanted something reasonably priced and I had never tried it before. I've heard of this chain restaurant so I had respective expectations for it. They had a $20 deal going on and that was very attractive to us.  We got there around 6:30 pm and was promptly seated, no reservations necessary (this was a Saturday). It was quite busy but not 100% full. Our waitress was very friendly and patient - no attitude. She could have been a little faster when stopping by for drinks, taking our orders, etc but I guess she had a lot of tables to look after. Still we had no complaints about her service - very personable and conversational. This restaurant had free wifi, which was very slow so I barely bothered with it.  The $20 deal comes with one appetizer and two entrees for two people. Awesome price compared to regular menu price which is already reasonably priced.  Boneless wings, honey BBQ flavour with ranch dip, $9.49 normally: these were breaded chicken breast chunks with a BBQ sauce on them with a dip and celery sticks on the side. I loved these but would have preferred less BBQ sauce. However these were still great - I ate these so fast! Citrus lime 7 oz sirloin, $13.49 normally: I got this medium rare. It came with a plastic stick on the top. The server said this just meant how well it was cooked for the kitchen's benefit, I guess. It came with potatoes that are like breakfast ones, and a side of vegetables (zucchini and beans). I didn't like the potatoes but my friend loved them. The vegetables were good as they wer covered in the same sauce as the steak, which was cooked perfectly by the way. Sauce was so good but a little salty. I was very thirsty after this meal.  My friend got the riblet basket with fries, normally $9.49 I think. This was a huge portion, many rib things and fries. I was not aware of this kind of rib. They had bones throughout and less meat. The sauce was same as the boneless wings. The fries were good. He couldn't finish though as it got boring.  For a chain restaurant, I had a great time. The food was good enough, the service was great, and overall an awesome experience. I left in a really great mood. I don't see why there are so many poor reviews. It's nothing fancy and you can't compare it to something like that. The food came hot and our waitress was nice.  In the future, I would definitely go for the $20 deal again. I would also like to try their happy hour - half prices appetizers from 3-6 and 9pm to close! Also there's a free appetizer if you join their perks thing. Yay :)"
Niki A.,"Boulder, CO",71,1,,1.0,12/22/2016,My husband and I come in here periodically. The service is almost always bad.  Food is hit and miss.  Tonight the won ton tacos were like jerky and they messed up our order twice with no real apology.  The manager and some of the wait staff were more interested in visiting with each other than waiting on us.
April Y.,"Ferndale, WA",30,214,443,3.0,3/28/2015,"Kind of slow once you place your food order. Food is good lots of tv's to watch and a nifty device called ""ted"" that you can use to place your own appetizer and/or dessert order. You can also use it to pay your bill and for a few dollars you can unlock games on it."
Kat E.,"Oakland, CA",0,109,,4.0,10/8/2015,"I don't usually eat at Applebee's, but this one was pretty decent. Our food came at a good pace and it was well cooked. I ordered a drink and I got my money's worth for the alcohol content. I also like how many TV's this particular one had set up everywhere."
Lee R.,"Bellingham, WA",3,6,,3.0,6/28/2017,We have had many enjoyable visits through the years at Applebee's.  Tonight was our first real disappointment.  The deep fried chicken appetizer's were rock hard.  We had them split our dinner order of Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken and it was lukewarm and the chicken not completely cooked.  We ordered a salad that came five minutes after our dinner so we sent it back.   We had three different servers which may have caused some of the issues.  The servers and door greeter were very friendly and respectful.  The person hustling people outside at the Alex Lemonade Stand was friendly but to aggresive.  After a customer declined to donate she snapped back that didn't they know it was for children with cancer.  She did not respect the customers space and made others standing nearby uncomfortable.  We had already donated to her but wished we hadn't after that exchange.  Oh well  Life goes on and we will return and know things will be better next visit.
Scott B.,"Lynden, WA",0,68,5,3.0,3/1/2016,We frequent here quite a bit because we can always get in around 9 to 10 PM and the appetizers are half price. You would not want to pay full price for any of the appetizers because the portions lately are horrible. They keep changing The appetizer menu and not for the better. I wish they would go back to their old menu a year ago. They had large portions especially their quesadillas. They also used to have really good nachos. They tried to go fancy with their hors d'oeuvres and failed miserably. Ever since they took all the fun stuff off the walls they have gone downhill. I have been coming here less and less over the last year and before long I guess I won't be back. They need a serious management adjustment to get back to their winning ways. I gave them three stars because they usually have very good employees.
Shawn K.,"Portland, OR",6,32,,3.0,1/21/2015,"I've never been an AppleBees fan and actually haven't eaten in one in a number of years. The food has always been below par and the service usually sucks. I was in Bellingham on business and when I'm traveling for business everything goes on the Amex card. Needless to say this can greatly reduce restaurant choices especially when I'm out of the major metropolitan areas.  Knowing they would take Amex I went to the Applebee's in Bellingham and the food was not horrible. Still what I consider to be under par for the price but better than my last few times at this chain. I must say that the service at this Applebee's was probably the best I've had at this chain. Very good service, friendly attentive waitress. Food was delivered fast and hot. I'm sure there are better places here but my experience here was good enough for 3 stars... Mostly for the service."
Jessica Y.,"Lynden, WA",62,46,45,4.0,10/24/2015,"I come here sometimes and the atmosphere is great, the food is fresh, the place is clean, the people are nice but the only thing I found disappointing was the change in the menu. The last times I was there I ordered the Super Nachos and they indeed were huge but just recently I ordered the same thing and it was puny. If it's super it should be super but everything else I've ordered was great. The alcoholic beverages are excellent and are very tasty."
Jeff M.,"Bellingham, WA",123,291,133,4.0,5/4/2012,"I know.  Applebees?  Really?  Yes, Applebees. We got an Applebees quite a few years ago and I have always like the place.  Before their recent remodel, I loved playing ""I Spy"" with all the nostalgic stuff...  But their new clean look is good, too.  Simple modern.  Yeah, it works. The menu is, I will admit, a bit too exhaustive.  I usually turn to whatever is ""hot and exciting"" today.  The ""2 for $20"" deals usually suit me and whomever I am with. The service is usually pretty reliable, the food is good (""good enough""), and the ambiance is what you would expect from a chain restaurant, fine, but not stellar. So go, you'll be fed and taken care of.  And it won't break you."
Kenton K.,"Renton, WA",0,1,,2.0,5/8/2016,Consistently slow service. We waited a long time for our food and our desserts took a ridiculously long time to arrive.
Rebecca P.,"Bellingham, WA",2,17,,1.0,10/5/2015,"I went to Applebee's on Sunset today with my grandfather (who has severe alzheimer's) and my grandmother. Our server was an older gentlemen maybe in his late 40s early 50s who was very pleasant and was a wonderful sever. Our meal came to about $32 with their senior discount and the food overall was a lot better than I remember in the past. As I mentioned my grandfather has SEVERE alzheimer's and it is hard enough taking him places anyways. He lives in the past when 50 cents was a LARGE tip. Whenever we go out to dinner it's a huge fiasco when we pay for the meal and my grandfather will argue until he's blue in the face about leaving a tip and has even gone to the extend of going back to the table as we are leaving to take more money away from the server. My grandmother and I have made it a habit to let him leave a small tip and as we walk out we tip the server more so it doesn't cause a scene. At the end while paying for our $32 meal my grandfather left a $3 tip which in my opinion is insulting  (I've worked in this industry but i NEVER expected anything from anyone knowing how hard times can come up). I had 7 more dollars in my hand to hand to the sever because he was great. As the serve took the money I watched him walk to the register, shake his head, sort of hit his hand down and legitimately through and fit. He looked absolutely on fire....! He wouldn't even look at me when i was trying to get his attention. It was very uncomfortable. I immediately put my money back in my pocket. I get that a small tip can be irritating. I've been there. But to choose this job with the odds of an elderly person giving a small tip and then to visually throw a fit like that was discusting to watch. I will never step foot in a Applebee's again. I hope this server and his manager reads this.. this event has truly bothered me."
Gustavo A.,"Bellingham, WA",0,3,,1.0,6/24/2015,Ashley is the slowest server around. How long does it take to get water. It wasn't even that busy and it still took forever just to get our drinks. Also we placed a to go order at the same time as our meal and it wasn't ready yet when we asked for the bill. Everyone else brought us stuff and ashley did the minimum. Even to pay took the longest. We hardly go there to eat and now they only make sure we go even less. Sorry Bham applebees but no matter what you change about yourself you still suck.
Kevin S.,"Bellingham, WA",0,3,14,4.0,4/5/2013,"I've always loved Applebee's!  For a chain they do a great job.  Always clean, fresh food, prompt and friendly service.  Sometimes their portion sizes look a little smaller in person then they do on the menu but they are tasty all the same. I sat in the bar today as I usually do when alone.  Dez was the bartender and she was friendly and did a great job.  I usually spend about the same amount here as I do at fast food so why not eat better?"
Sasha K.,"Vancouver, Canada",9,53,32,3.0,12/19/2015,"We have been here twice, and the food is good. But they are awfully formal there. As a nonbinary person, I hate being called ""sir"" or ""gentleman"" all the time, so have to think whether I want to go there again. Just say ""hi"", and that's enough..."
Howard L.,"Park Ridge, IL",54,1064,9128,4.0,5/14/2011,"Applebee's is a life saver if you ever need to work late nights near Bellingham.  They are open til 1 am most nights, and have good food, good music, and generous portions.  I tried a variety of items from their extensive menu, ranging from their ribs, pastas, and salads, and they are all decent and very reasonably price.  As dead as night time Bellingham can appear, seems there's always some life here.  I found out that their music is on a subscriber channel like XMI or whatever, but it was just the kind of 70's - 90's music selection I liked, at 1am anyway."
Kiana F.,"Edmonds, WA",124,244,17,3.0,1/21/2014,"My friends and I went to Applebee's all the time since we were poor, starving college students.  Their happy hour is probably one of the best around Bellingham.  Their boneless chicken wings with blue cheese?  Ugh, I'm making myself crave them which is super masochistic since I'm currently living in Japan.  I know, craving Applebee's, what has my life come to, right?  But hey, they're cheap and hit the spot with a couple of drinks, so I really can't complain."
E C.,"Bellingham, WA",0,19,,1.0,7/6/2014,Stopped by for a beer and some apps. We sat in the bar area. Took 14 minutes before we got approached by the waiter/ mgr. Id'd us then took our beer order. Didn't ask what size he just took it upon himself to bring us the biggest one he had. Guess we were paying for it weather we finished or not. Then made excuses about taking so long. This happened last 2 times we dined there. This new staff sucks. I miss a lot of the waiters/waitresses/mgr of old. They always made sure your visit was great. Not the case anymore. Won't be back
Laura C.,"Bellingham, WA",6,134,24,1.0,6/10/2011,"Went there on a Friday night and the place was packed. I'm amazed, since the food was incredibly boring and the same quality I would get from the frozen food aisle at the supermarket. Our waitress was pleasant and helpful, but the food was so lame won't be going to this place again."
Regan M.,"Tucson, AZ",25,22,27,1.0,1/28/2013,"The food is absolutely horrible. Why is this place still in business??? Wrote a little song about the place: Applebee's (sung to the tune of Drive My Car by the Beatles) Fell in love with the hostess there Chelsea baby, I love your hair You flashed me a smile, and then you Said, ""What I want isn't on the menu"" The waitresses are the mostest But the food is the grossest Chelsea is an awesome hostess And baby, I love you Beep beep mmbeep beep, yeah!"
Shameem S.,"Bellingham, WA",0,5,,2.0,8/5/2014,"Terrible service and mediocre food. Honestly, how do you biff up a wedge salad? Only Applebee's knows. We called in for pick up, went to get it the 20 min later they asked for, waited another 20 for it to be ready. Cold, greasy potatoes, disgusting clump of spinach with a chunk of bottled garlic and a wedge of iceberg with brown leaves and what they must have hoped was enough blue cheese to cover that up? The only reason for the 2nd star is take out can be hard and I should have known better when the prices were 2 entrees for 12 bucks."
Aliese N.,"Bellingham, WA",21,11,17,5.0,3/19/2013,"This is a 5-star review for Applebee's TRIVIA on Tuesday nights! Win prizes while showing everyone else how smart you are. Except you, Chuck. You're lame."
Kate H.,"Bellingham, WA",0,2,,1.0,6/6/2015,"My boyfriend and I ordered some food to pick up at the restaurant and when we got home with the food we realized that everything in the bag was literally eaten food (either trash or someone's leftovers) which was disgusting. We called and were told it would be taken care of when we got back to the restaurant to pick it up. After driving all the way back, all of the employees were extremely apologetic and took my boyfriend to the manager who was right where he picked up the food in the first place. The employee directed her to his issue and she literally TURNED HER HEAD, IGNORED HIM, AND WENT BACK TO WHAT SHE WAS DOING. After he walked away with the food, he heard the manager ask the bartender who was helping him what the problem was about. Are you serious? He was standing right there and she could have asked HIM and tried to help but she IGNORED HIM and asked AFTER HE WAS WALKING AWAY. To make matters worse, we were not offered any kind of compensation for being given a literal bag of trash instead of our food. One of the worst service experiences we've ever had with a MANAGER of a restaurant. Hopefully someone will see this and chat with this particular manager. Whoever it was, she was on duty today June 6th at 8:00pm."
Alison Y.,"Calgary, Canada",13,92,17,1.0,4/9/2012,"I've been to applebee's a few times over the last 6 years...they went from great service and food to mediocre at best. Between burned burgers and iffy service on one trip, to this time we had a 5 minute wait for 2 measly vinegar packets, a server who would walk away after delivering our food so we had to wait 5 minutes just to ask for the vinegar in the first place, fish-stick tasting fish and chips that was supposed to be cod....on top of that when we first arrived the hostess asked whether we'd want the lounge or the dinning area, we said we'd like booths in the dinning area and for five minutes we ended up arguing with her (politely of course because she was being very pushy) about not wanting to go to the lounge. She pushed the lounge to the point where we ended up with a table that was half-booth and half chairs in the lounge, but if you're going to ask where you want to be seated you should NEVER push the area that's the opposite of the customer's answer. I don't know what she was thinking. Overall we have been very displeased and we will NOT be returning to this restaurant."
Andie K.,"Bellingham, WA",2,22,10,1.0,3/4/2013,to be perfectly honest - It gets busy here and I don't know why. The wait staff can either be nice or mean but I notice when it is really busy they are usually cranky because they are very busy. It can be a long wait for a table but even when you're seated you still have to wait for them to take your order. Depending on the time of day this can take a while. Portions are small and its well known that they microwave most of their food. Unless you like the atmosphere and don't feel like microwaving your dinner your self - there's really no good reason to go here. Nothing outstanding about this place.
