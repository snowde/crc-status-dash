J. M.,"Bellingham, WA",19,67,,1.0,12/30/2009,"There was a hair in my food when I went. Which actually wasn't too surprising considering that any time I'm drug to or have tried out an Applebee's, there has been a hair in my food. Literally. Every time. One time, I ordered some fettuccine something or other with broccoli and they forgot the sauce. And when they brought it and i dumped it on my dish, there was a giant, long, thick black hair in it. (this was at the Marysville location) This one in Bham, we waited 1/2 hour for just our appetizers and when they came out, were cold. Not even lukewarm. Service is ALWAYS bad. And slow. And there's ALWAYS an issue with the food. yuck yuck yuck"
John M.,"Dallas, OR",2,10,,2.0,9/1/2014,"The""perfect margarita"" was watery and far from perfect.  My chicken and portobello mushrooms was dry and the lettuce in my wife's Thai shrimp salad fell off the produce truck sometime last week.  We often eat at Applebee's when we are on the road and this particular one does not measure up to others in the franchise.  Mediocre at best."
Alexis D.,"South Jordan, UT",108,21,2,3.0,8/13/2012,"The waitress and hostess were very kind, and it wasn't too busy on a Sunday night. Drinks came promptly and our food did not take too long. Food wasn't cold like other reviewers stated and it was all done how we asked. My only problem was that the food seemed to be covered in pepper. My french fries were completely coated in salt and pepper which was kind of gross.  I got the chicken wrap and it wasn't too spicy, but some bites were.  Someone in my party got the shrimp salad and her shrimp were covered in pepper as well.  It made it almost too spicy for her.  Overall the food was okay, just way too much salt and pepper.  It feels like they are trying to flavor things with it. Next time I think I will order a salad or something to avoid this."
Lady G.,"Bothell, WA",2,30,3,1.0,1/21/2012,"I've occasionally chosen Applebee's in various places because it was a known quantity.  If I wasn't feeling very adventurous, it was a place to go.  But, after eating at this one, I can't bring myself to go there again *anywhere*.  Even for an Applebee's, this place is horrible -- way worse than any other I've been to.  The food is cold when it comes out, and the service is slow and generally bad.  The food itself is poorly made, even for what it is.  Still, both times my husband and I went, the place was inexplicably packed, so everything was incredibly slow.  It was just a terrible experience all around. Don't waste your money."
Peter W.,"Bellingham, WA",124,26,5,3.0,8/9/2011,"It depends, sometimes I am amazed how good the food is, and other times I just feel like I am hungry so I am gonna eat it.  But the Carside service fits my needs often so that is why I keep coming back to the staple applebees!"
terry b.,"Bellingham, WA",1,48,,2.0,11/23/2012,"it ain't the best and it ain't the worst had old forks and napkins under the table food has tons on salt in it, drinks are good but overpriced,"
Jonas E.,"Garden Grove, CA",7,82,21,2.0,2/27/2013,I wish we went somewhere else.   The waiter was a good guy.  The food was.... Two stars I'm being generous.
Cicero D.,"Seattle, WA",28,80,2,3.0,5/19/2008,"Applebee's, like any other in the world, is really good for it's happy hour.   That's the only time I really eat at this place anyways.  But usually I cruise by Applebees with friends when we want to get a quick dinner and some drinks to match. They have a pretty good happy hour special that begins at 9pm til close.  The appetizers (most of them) are half-off and the drink specials vary.   But like any chain restaurant, or any dining place, there's just many factors that contribute to how well your experience is.  On average, the good is good and the service is quick... but I always depend on who's with me to top off the experience."
Matt W.,"Lynden, WA",3,24,1,2.0,7/5/2010,Very average food and good service. I wont be going back the food just is not that good.
Trevor F.,"Bellingham, WA",41,16,,4.0,3/11/2009,"In today's economy, I have to agree with the previous reviewer and recommend the ""Bee's"" for their Happy Hour. This place is classic American and has earned it's reputation as the ""Neighborhood Bar and Grill."" We walked in expecting an ordinary dining experience until we were seated in Amanda's section. She takes the average fare, and kicks it up a notch to make the Bee's a really fun place to hang out, have a beer (they serve Boundary Bay) and get some good grub. So the next time you go, ask for Amanda, enjoy the happy hour with friends or family, and try to forget about the abysmal economy for a while."
Brandon B.,"Bellingham, WA",8,28,7,4.0,4/18/2009,"Compared to other Applebees I've been too, this one stands out mainly for the staff. This is our monday night spot and we always hang in the bar. The bartender is awesome, able to keep up with work while having a genuine conversation. You can chat with the other waiters and waitresses and they are pretty level headed. And at happy hour it's only $4 for good chicken wings. And I'm a fan of any places that puts Seattle memorabilia all over the walls"
Jen S.,"Seattle, WA",3,4,,4.0,12/5/2009,Ate here on a busy Friday night and the hostess made sure we felt welcomed. OUr food was hot and enjoyable. It had been a while since we have eaten at an applebees but we are glad we tried it again. Our waitress was ok but that didn't seem to ruin our experience.
