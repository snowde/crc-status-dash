Julia A.,"New York, NY",76,1,,4.0,7/21/2017,"Great service from Nathaniel!! Frequent Applebee's at lots of locations and our food was the freshest we've had! New management, wait and kitchen staff is working for them! Now this sounds like a fake review lol but definitely give them another shot!"
Valerie K.,"Belton, MO",76,4,2,1.0,5/20/2017,"Came for what was supposed to be a ""quick"" bite between soccer games for my daughter. Came in at 5:00 and the entire place was empty but we were told there was a 20 minutes wait with 2 other families waiting ahead of us... umm ok? So we waited. Once we were finally seated after the full 20 minute wait we mentioned that it was weird because it was empty and the hostess was rude and said well we are under staffed someone will be with you soon.  Full 5 minutes sat there waiting. Finally someone comes and we were like- well we are ready to order we've been here for 30 minutes.  Ordered food and again- it took FOREVER. Service was terrible. Seems like this location is very poorly ran, managed and staffed."
Melissa L.,"Raymore, MO",0,11,,3.0,6/2/2017,Waited to be seated for a couple minutes. It want busy at all and no one waitress or waiters were there to seat us. When someone finally did come the food was good. The waitress helping ended her shift and handed us off to another one and she was good as well. I was impressed by both waitress. Would've given more stars if it wasn't for the long wait to be seated.
Jay A.,"Shawnee, KS",0,2,1,1.0,5/28/2016,We ordered full portion salads through Curbside. The portion specs are seriously ridiculous. A complete rip-off. A salad that cost $10.79 weighted less than 10oz.! A cup of soup $3.79 that weight less than 6oz.! Not again..
Katie P.,"Leawood, KS",86,16,11,1.0,12/29/2015,"I placed a to-go order this past Sunday thru the "" curbside"" server. I asked for a cheeseburger with mushrooms and sub onion rings. Also, I asked for the chicken tender platter since "" it came with 7 vs 5 in the basket"" plus fries and slaw with a side of ranch and bbq.I was told 10 min. I call when I pulled up and was called "" Crystal"" and waited 25 extra minutes for my order.  When I got home with my family, I pulled out the food I just wasted $25 on. The burger was covered and dripping in grease;my burger bun wouldn't stay together and it too was dripping with grease. The mushrooms were rubbery and nasty thrown in a side container. I didn't receive onion rings, instead, I got stale old fries. The chicken platter had 5 tenders and old fries with bbq and missing the ranch plus 2 other tenders that I paid for.  I don't know if it's hard to find good help these days in the service industry but if I was a cook there, I would take pride in the company that puts food on my table so-to-speak. When I served/bartender, I refused to serve food to anyone that I wouldn't eat nor serve to my family.  This establishment needs better caring employees who are more in tune with customer needs and double checks orders prior to being served."
Michael H.,"Harrisonville, MO",0,3,,1.0,10/15/2016,"We were seated and no one spoke to us for 10 minutes, after our drinks were ordered, it took an additional 15 minutes to get that then one of they drinks was wrong.  At that point I didn't have a lot of faith in getting my order quickly or correct.  I will not be back, should have known since the parking lot was empty on a Saturday night"
Donita W.,"Grandview, MO",0,10,22,3.0,3/30/2016,"So,my husband and I decided to give this location another try after being disappointed on our last. We entered the restaurant and we're left standing g while servers wandered about. After finally being recognized and seated we ask to put our orders in right away as we knew what we wanted, two waters and two orders of wonton tacos. It seem s to gave taken forever to get our orders to us (and I am a very patient person). Finally the food comes and we eat,the food is tasty, thanks goodness."
Brittany P.,"Belton, MO",0,3,,2.0,5/23/2016,I'm give this place 2 stars. We just ordered for carry out and they didn't even give us our whole order and made it very sloppy. I called and complained and they gave us a free 2 for $20 or 2 for $25 but I wish our order was made right the first time to begin with.
Bud M.,"Clinton, OK",0,23,2,2.0,10/15/2016,We watched our food go to three tables and drinks went to other tables. Watching around it was happening to everyone very poorly ran place!
Molly B.,"Belton, MO",0,6,1,1.0,9/25/2015,"Bad. Got there at opening. 11am. Took 45 min to get 3 burgers. The condiments were off brands from hyvee. They are no longer owned by Applebees. Dont waste your lunch break, menu items changed lunch menu not worth it."
Dawn T.,"Belton, MO",9,52,73,5.0,10/24/2015,"This location had really gotten better! I'm loving the new burgers and unlimited fries.  Service is also much improved. The brunch burger is cooked in onion and bacon, what can be better than that? It's really amazing."
Zak T.,"Belton, MO",0,15,2,4.0,11/8/2015,The wife and I have made several trips to this location since we moved to the area. The new menu is great. Haven't had a bad experience with the food. Every now and then we get a high school aged server who needs some work but that doesn't detour us from going back. The brunch burger was suggested to me and I will definitely reorder.
Holly L.,"South Padre Island, TX",0,12,2,2.0,8/16/2015,Usually slow so don't go if your in a hurry. Ordered car side to go and that took forever. Order was messed up and grilled cheese both were extremely burnt
Krisan M.,"Raymore, MO",74,11,3,1.0,5/24/2015,Arrived at 6:10 pm. Was told that there was a 10-15 minute wait...on my way to the restroom there were at least 10 unoccupied tables throughout the restaurant.  We left .
Austin S.,"Kansas City, MO",503,732,94,3.0,5/10/2013,"Long story short: not bad, but I didn't really appreciate that they have an indoor smoking section in the bar area Long story long: My girlfriend and I came down to Belton, originally trying to go to Bdubs to watch an NFL playoff game, but because of the game, the wait was over an hour, so we decided to not go for it and came here to Applebee's instead. We walked in and I smelled cigarette smoke.  Not overwhelming, but it was there.  When the hostess came by and we asked for a table, she asked if we wanted smoking or non-smoking.  What??!?!? I thought smoking in restaurants was a thing of the past.  It is highly unsanitary and just plain disgusting.  But yeah, that's why I smelled cigarette smoke.  We obviously opted for the non-smoking section. We actually came here twice in a single weekend, and we happened to have the same server both times, and she remembered me and my girlfriend the 2nd time we went.  Her service was very good and attentive both times. We felt that the food seemed better than at the Grandview location.  I mean, a place like this, the food is going to be the same from location to location, so maybe we just caught them on a good weekend.  We were definitely pleased with that.  If we find ourselves down in Belton during their late night happy hour, we will probably come here again.  I just am turned off by the indoor smoking section."
Mike S.,"Grandview, MO",15,93,11,3.0,11/13/2014,Are you freaking kidding me. There is a sign on the front door explaining that the establishment has a smoking section. READ THE SIGN AND GO ELSEWHERE IF YOU DONT LIKE IT. Seriously you have no right to complain about the smoking unless you can't read. I enjoy Applebee's food but the service at this one is slow.
Cindy B.,"Bellevue, NE",0,2,,1.0,8/3/2014,"Indoor smoking? Seriously? Belton is just outside the KC metro and indoor smoking is apparently allowed. I had a nice lunch at this location in June, although the service was too slow considering we had an 11 month-old with us. I didn't notice any smoke that time.  I'm asthmatic and allergic to smoke. When I went two weeks ago, I smelled the smoke just after we sat down. I figured it came in from outside until it continued. I now know Belton doesn't have a restaurant smoking ban in place--not until Jan. 2016. It'll be at least that long before I visit again. I'm way past wanting to ever smell like an ashtray. If this location decides to add some class, they'll enforce the ban early. Chain restaurants should be consistent--especially in a metro area. I'll drive to Grandview to use my Applebee's gift card tonight!"
Toni W.,"Harrisonville, MO",21,46,66,1.0,11/1/2014,"Have eaten at this Applebee's at a minimum of 4 times a week.  Have always loved it however in the last several months has gone down hill.  This week alone walked out 3 times and went to another local restaurant, that we don't really care for but.  Arrive after 4 pm and only one server on floor, so can't seat you for 15-20 minutes.  Today, Saturday, when asked to speak to manager the young man didn't even know who it was.  Lunch still not to bad, but forget going here for dinner.  When April S. left it just went to pot.  Need to get April back give her what ever she needs and six (6) months to get business back.  Don't care for Applebee's in Harrisonville, and Lee's Summit farther than we want to go on a regular basis.  Please, Please do something with our Belton Applebee's love it and don't want to give up on it."
Tracy W.,"Grandview, MO",90,28,15,1.0,10/14/2012,"I visited the Applebee's location in Belton, MO on Sunday, October 14th  and I'm not sure if the cook was having a good day. I ordered the Blackened Chicken Penne Pasta dish. The pasta was like eating paste. The Manager was nice and gave me a discount but I refused to get a replacement dish. I didn't want to take any chances with someone becoming upset and spitting in my food. I gave the waitress a generous tip because it wasn't her fault. She did whisper to me that two other customers complained about the pasta not being al dente. Even the Potato Twisters, appetizer dish wasn't good. The potatos were dark brown. I hate to say this but I won't be going back to that location.I will stick with the location on 135th and State Line or Truman Corners in Grandview. I will not be back and will tell all my friends."
Shannon L.,"Belton, MO",108,27,77,2.0,4/6/2014,"Season salt overload on my fries and sandwich, I want to like there food but it's just so drowned in season salt I can't taste the chicken, lettuce or tomato. If this were the first time I might say try it again but it's every time I  have eaten there in the past 2 years. The food is just SATURATED in season salt it makes me wonder seriously if they are insecure in the quality of their food?"
Samantha H.,"Butler, MO",1,14,,1.0,9/13/2014,"Every time we went here it was a horrible experience. The first couple times it was just awful waitressing, rude, didn't pay any attention to us, and never checked on us because she was to busy flirting with guys. (Seriously this happened with every waitress we got, a couple times it was the same girl.) But the last time was the last straw, on top of the horrible waitresses my husband found a roach in his food. The manager was pretty nice, he said we could have our meals for free and we left. We will never be back."
Carla G.,"Lee's Summit, MO",95,198,4,2.0,1/20/2012,"I'm tying to be generous here. The women of the church I pastor took me here for lunch on Wednesday to celebrate my birthday.  Our group was seated at 11:17 and I finally left at 1:37, some of our party was still trying to pay their bills when I left!!!! With Applebee's like most chain restaurants you pretty much know what the food is going to be.  My grilled shrimp, spinach salad was pretty much as I expected.  The high point of the meal was the chocolate moose shooter, which was suppose to be comped because of my birthday celebration.  It wasn't until the person handling the bill had to get that straitened out. Our service was not good.  One order was wrong out of 10.  The waiter had to be reminded to bring refill items for those that ordered the 'all you can eat' items.  The steak of the other birthday person was overcooked.  Medium is pink in the center.  That steak was well done.  Although I must say the baked potato looked totally delicious. The real clinker for me was the hostess of the celebration from my group kept apologizing to me for  how bad everything was.  I of course reminded her it was not her fault.  No manager came to check on us after the first problem.  I think our group hostess spoke to various restaurant people at least 4 times. The icing on the cake was when I was leaving an I said something to guy who opened the door for me.  I said the food was good (mine was) but the service was very slow.  He had the audacity to tell me that they had gotten slammed.  I so wanted to say:  ""HELLO,  your restaurant was at most 1/4 full.  That is NOT slammed.""  I just left shaking my head. I'll probably not be back to the Applebee's."
Vince P.,"Raymore, MO",14,60,4,4.0,8/4/2011,"I've been here a few times in the past and the place was a dump.   Recently, out of desperation for something other than a burger, I forced myself to go to Applebee's. I was pleasantly surprised.  Quickly being seated, waitress was right there to take drink orders and checked back several times before taking our food orders.   Food arrived within a short time.  Food quality was good.  The steak was cooked correctly and very flavorful.  I sampled oriental chicken salad and it was also very good - not too much dressing and the chicken was tender.   I think they have recently remodeled the interior, it certainly looked a lot cleaner.  The service was also an improvement from the past.  Food quality was also improved from prior visits."
John G.,"Kansas City, MO",2,20,14,1.0,3/15/2014,This is the second time I have been here in the last few weeks. Service out of the kitchen has been horrible. Both times we had to wait an hour for our food and everyone was complaining. It was not even busy. Last time they did at least comp 1 meal. This time they just apologized. Not sure I'm ever coming back.
Brent D.,"Gardner, KS",0,59,5,2.0,11/13/2014,If you are past high school age and eat at an Applebee's then I don't feel sorry for you when you are unhappy with your meal
Danielle A.,"Raymore, MO",108,99,29,3.0,12/16/2012,"Personally I'm not a huge fan of the Applebee's menu, I have a hard time finding something I want to order.  But we ended up here one night and our server was excellent.  I wish I remembered his name.  Now we go back hoping to find him, of course we keep missing him.  But I found I liked the black & bleu burger, so they are now on our rotation."
Mscop31 C.,"Peculiar, MO",0,11,1,4.0,7/13/2014,"Applebee's gets a bad rap but I will tell you that we have almost always had good food and service with the exception of two times out of like 50, with the apple bees perks coupons and the two for twenty menu you can't eat decently any cheaper at home for two!"
