Eric N.,"Tacoma, WA",0,1,,3.0,1/9/2018,"The fault with most chsin restuarents is they don't publish drink prices for adult beverages.   The one in Silverdale, Wa. the manager said that it was a piece of onion skin we found in the soup and not plastic.  The wait staff agreed that it was plastic, he took the price of the meal off the bill but lying about it when he did not have to was wrong."
Cam S.,"Bend, OR",0,53,,1.0,8/11/2017,"This location has really tanked.....  filthy rest room, dirty tables (at 3:30 in the afternoon - hardly the ""Busy"" time), bartender who could care less about serving a customer.  After waiting for him to decide to wait on us (waited 20 minutes - we were with only maybe a dozen other people in the whole place) we let him continue chatting up some woman at the other side of the bar and left.....  Won't be coming back!"
Spike O.,"San Jose, CA",0,20,1,5.0,8/13/2017,"Went in for a beer & food about 12:30 pm last Friday, August 11th. They were pretty busy needless to say because it was the lunch hour. The one server that I had named, Lisa, was extremely busy, but yet she took the time to acknowledge me and told me that she'd be right with me. I really appreciated the fact that she said what she did because I saw that she had probably five tables that she was working and all of them were at least three to five people per table. She was a real gem to have be my server. She was friendly, she was courteous, she was polite, she was funny & she got my order down perfectly! I was extremely happy with my overall experience with Lisa G. I'm sure that if you get her as your server you will find that she is great! Thumb's up young lady!!"
amanda w.,"Bend, OR",0,13,1,4.0,6/25/2017,"We've only been 3 times in the past few years but it's always been good... decent food (it is a chain so you can't expect superb), friendly service, attentive wait staff, and rather clean from booth to restroom. We stopped by in a rush the other day - accommodating and prompt service."
Lindsey M.,"Bend, OR",0,3,,4.0,6/1/2017,My boyfriend and I go get their 1/2 priced apps after 9 pretty frequently. We prefer to sit in the bar and Ryan has always given us great service and is fantastic at recommending things that we may like if we're on the fence about it. Can't beat the $5 long islands and a table full of 1/2 priced appetizers...
Elizabeth C.,"Prineville, OR",8,2,,1.0,1/23/2017,"When we arrived the host told us they were full when clearly half the tables were empty. I asked about the bar and the host agreed to let us sit just before a waitress asked him, ""who is going to cook?"" That's when I realized we would not be eating there. We had a drink and spilt. I will think twice before going back."
Peter S.,"West Covina, CA",0,15,34,1.0,1/2/2017,"We came in with a party of 2 at about 9pm.  It wasn't busy and our order was taken right away.  About 15 or 20 minutes later, the waitress returned to say that our order had been lost by their computer system after she put it in.  We repeated our order and waited patiently.  The food arrived a short time later, but with problems - the soup was cold and the Mac and Cheese with chicken tenders was watery and gross.  We would have complained, but the waitress never returned -- no refills, no ""how is everything,"" and not even a bill.  In the end, we got tired of waiting and checked out using the ziosk on the table.  I would not come back."
Shelly T.,"Eugene, OR",26,40,,1.0,4/16/2016,"This is the dirtiest Applebee's I have ever been to. The menu's had food and whatever else on them. I want to read what I want on the menu, not taste it on the menu. The menu's were bent and warped. Items were crossed off menu with a black marker-tacky! The bathrooms were not kept up and were disgusting. We were told to sit and it would 10 minutes before a table is open. However, many tables were open and the help was very slow in cleaning them. The Hostess was far from the mostess. When the mozzarella sticks were delivered, it was gently thrown on our table and the gal was already walking away when she announced what they were. If we didn't have a gift card from our wedding, we would have left but it was still a gross experience.  I don't know why but Tuesday Margarita and Kids  Night seems like a bad combo to me. ""Let's drink a bunch of alcohol and then drive the kids."" Seems safe right? The one good thing? Becky. Only bad thing about her is that she isn't the manager-needs to be!"
Debbie F.,"Sherwood - Tualatin South, Tualatin, OR",10,3,7,1.0,6/21/2017,Went to Applebee's June 20 2017  I went to use a Groupon.   Went to order and was told they had no ribs or wedge salad or thousand Island dressing.  These are things that we wanted to order.   Ordered an appetizer or and it was brought out until our meal.  I had $50 in the Groupon. My bill came up to $44 I asked for the golden apple  discount.  I waitressed did not know what it was.  We explain to her it was the senior discount and she   Would give us that 10% off.  She brought the bill back to us with no discount and was told that there's no change to be given  back from that $50 Groupon.  Oh and no refills on her ice tea   This was the first time my husband and I did not leave a tip   Will not be back to that Applebee's
Michael T.,"Fayetteville, NC",92,7,1,1.0,5/5/2017,Just walked in Guy told me there is a wait?! I said how there are only like 5 tables with ppl literally more than half the rest if empty. He said the kitchen is behind and they are trying to catch up so they are putting everyone on a wait. By this time the whole wait area is full. You could explain sit us and let ppl spend money on drinks!!! Duh!! Ending up leaving not waiting 15-20 mins to be seated in an empty rest. Then to turn around and wait for our food when u sit 6 families waiting! Have better customer service!!! This is horrible!
Luis L.,"Bend, OR",0,3,1,1.0,2/14/2017,"When I go to restaurants I always pay the bill with a card and then I leave a tip in cash, but when I came to this place the waitress Krista starting being rude and disrespectful once she saw that I had not leaved a tip when I paid the bill, not knowing that I was going to leave a tip even though I don't think she deserved it since she only came once to check on us. Didn't refill drinks at all. If you do come here don't get her."
Paul B.,"Bend, OR",0,16,,1.0,6/3/2016,"This place, despite its recent facelift, has just gotten gross, and in my opinion you can blame the staff and the management! I've been in several other Applebee's that are much better. A friend and I visited yesterday. We arrived at 11:00 AM, just as they were unlocking the doors, so we were literally the first two customers in the restaurant. My friend went to use the restroom, and while I was waiting, I couldn't help but notice that our tabletop felt sticky. Looking around, I noticed bits of food and other dirt and debris on the floors everywhere - under adjacent tables and chairs, and in the aisles. My friend came back, and his first comment was ""can you believe this place just opened? The bathroom's disgusting. I had to flush the toilet before I used it - there was still urine in it!"" I checked it out as well - trash cans were overflowing, there were water spots all over the mirrors, and there were bits of paper towel, toilet paper, and dust on the floors. I rarely see restaurants in such a filthy condition after a day of hard use, let alone when they first open their doors. When we left several hours later, the floors and bathroom were even worse than when we arrived. It obviously calls into question the condition of the kitchen, and the quality of the food we were getting. My friend and I have been regular customers of this Applebee's for many years, and have seen it steadily decline. This will be our last visit."
Katherine R.,"Clackamas, OR",10,9,3,3.0,6/25/2016,"The food is the same as any other Applebees - ok, and slow to arrive. The place is empty and we have been waiting 30 minutes for our food. The music is loud and obnoxious and we have been told they can't change anything. That's fine. We just won't come back and we'll tell everyone about your obnoxious atmosphere."
Brandon B.,"Bend, OR",70,16,6,3.0,4/26/2016,"Started with the boneless wings, absolutely texturally unappealing. Not to mention on the bland side, even though they're coated in franks hot sauce. Alcohol selection was lacking, my makers old fashioned was balanced and on point, so congrats on making the most basic of cocktails. Overall another mediocre chain restaurant."
Christy M.,"Beaverton, OR",42,11,3,1.0,10/13/2015,"All I can say is WOW! Not impressed, at all. I guess I decided to visit on employee social hour. There were several employees hanging out at a table cussing (I knew they were employees because of name tags). I almost said something, I should have. Even the managers joined in.  One of the employees little kid was hanging out. That's not the issue, the issue was the kid kept running into the kitchen."
Elaine J.,"Bend, OR",6,11,1,1.0,5/13/2016,"Carside to go. Pulled in to Carside To Go parking space and waited a couple of minutes. No one came to deliver carside, so I went inside and picked up ""my"" order. Discovered in my car that I was given the wrong food. Came back inside. They ""got confused"" and didn't make my food. So I sat in the waiting area for 30 minutes while they made my food, every few minutes someone telling me it was ""almost ready"". We only ordered here because of a gift card. Thanks a lot, jerk who got my boyfriend an Applebee's gift card! I blame you."
Shannon S.,"La Pine, OR",0,20,,1.0,12/6/2016,"We keep trying to visit Applebee's and have a great experience...hasn't happened yet. Food is always good but service is slow, help is unfriendly. But the WORST, all the time, every visit is the bathrooms! I just don't understand how a casual dining sit down restaurant can have such dirty bathrooms. I won't go into any of the awful details, but every time I've visited it bathrooms are filthy. I'm done. I simply won't return."
Adam R.,"Federal Way, WA",279,296,190,1.0,12/21/2014,"I think we had been here a number of years ago when we were in town but don't remember what it was like. Unfortunately, I remember what this trip was like and it's one that makes me not want to go back to this location. I generally like Applebee's and enjoy the fresh food and their healthy portion of the menu. While the food was ok on this trip, the service was terrible. I get it that some people have off days, and maybe that was the case, but dang. It started when it took a very long time for our waiter to stop by. When he did, we placed our order but because he wasn't paying attention (looking off at another table) we had to repeat the order to him because he didn't here it. After placing the order, it took almost 15 minutes for me to get my beer and the rest of the table to get their beverages. Because it was happy hour, we ordered two orders of the pretzel sticks and one order of the sweet potato fries. For the main course, I ordered the mac and cheese and my husband ordered the chicken. Our dining companions ordered the wonton tacos, wedge salad and french onion soup. I list the entire table order because what we got isn't what showed up. About 20 minutes later, we got the fries, an order of pretzels and an order of Spinach/Artichoke dip and chips. About another 15 minutes later we got the wedge salad, tacos and chicken. While eating their entree's a second order of the pretzels made it out. I figured I wasn't going to get my entree so I enjoyed the pretzels. Well, at some point it was noticed that they still owed the second entree, so I asked him to just bring it in a box. I had already eaten so much of the appetizers. By the end of the evening, we got the bill. One of the appetizers was not rung in as Happy Hour prices and we were charged for the soup we never got. SO, since a manger had never been by like they are supposed to, we had to go ask someone to get them. It took another 15 minutes for the manager to make his way by. All the while, our waiter hadn't even bothered to stop by. While the manager fixed the check issues, it didn't seem like he cared. Overall, a very bad experience and since we don't live here, I don't plan to be back."
Barney L.,"Glen Ellen, CA",1,11,,1.0,4/29/2016,"Food is a real disappointment.  Shrimp Thai salad was something I could have thrown together with a trip to Safeway.  I was still hungry so ordered some buffalo wings.   They were like chunks of chicken parts molded together and deep fried.  I can honestly say they were the worst I've ever had.   Beer has good.  Service, slow and sporadic.   Good reason to cook at home."
Heather B.,"Bend, OR",2,60,42,3.0,3/23/2016,Hit or miss with this place I swear! Some times I can have the best service and sometimes I can have the worst. Sad part is one of the woman managers there (I think) is the rudest! I've left before because she was gonna be my server. Every time I get her she's so rude.
Jayde marie L.,"Redmond, OR",6,10,,1.0,3/7/2016,"Very unimpressed. Applebee's was not our first choice, but I had received a gift card. So we went out to Applebee's and decided on the 2 for $20 menu, we chose the Mozzerella Sticks appetizer, the Three Cheese Cavatappi, and the Grilled Bourbon Skillet Chicken with Shrimp. We had been sitting for about 20 minutes before the waitress even headed to our table to take our drink order, but asked us to wait for a moment so she could deliver another table their food. We continued to wait, when finally we were able to place our order. We sat and waited for our drinks and appetizer which took about 20 minutes, which we had quickly devoured, only to wait an additional 30 minutes for our meal. Now to the main dish, the three cheese Cavatappi was in fact not a Cavatappi, but a Penne noodle, which I didn't mind, but was a little turned off when I noticed a mix of Penne and Cavatappi noodles, when I asked the waitress she told me that she had forgotten to let me know that they are getting new menu's and that the noodle had changed. I told her no problem and we continued to pick at our food. I then noticed that in my Three Cheese Cavata- Penne, an Italian pasta dish, was a large amount of Pico De Gallo, now I love and live for Pico De Gallo, but NOT in my Italian pasta dish. My boyfriend ordered the Chicken and Shrimp, and the Shrimp was good, just very over seasoned, the Chicken was very hard to cut through, the mushrooms and onions thrown on the skillet/plate were burnt, and the roasted potatoes were raw. After finally deciding we would not eat anymore, we looked at the bill on their electronic device, with the ""2for $20"" and my iced tea for $2.99, our total should have been 22.99 but instead, it was 25.49, and we were charged 22.50 for the ""2 for $20"". So we called the waitress over and asked her about the price and she said ""Oh I forgot to tell you, on our new menu, the chicken and shrimp is on the 2 for $25 meal deal"". We then told her that it was fine, but that we would like to be charged what we thought we were paying for. The waitress then went and made the change, brought the receipt over and told us to have a nice night.  I don't plan on going to an Applebee's again, because of this experience."
Lacy C.,"Rocklin, CA",11,26,2,5.0,4/8/2015,"As a business traveler, I've ended up in Bend, Oregon.  I was coming from Corvallis yesterday evening, and not being very familiar with the state, I nearly had a panic attack trying to get to Bend in a Toyota Corolla (but that's another story for another Yelp review).  The result was that when I finally arrived last night, I was too stressed out to eat anything, so today-- after 27 hours without eating-- I found myself at this Applebee's, ready to eat everything in the world. I took a seat in the bar area and found that service from Cari E. was friendly and attentive.  She also informed me of the daily drink specials, of which I took advantage of the special on house wine ($4 a glass!  Yayyy!!!) I've heard lots of hype about the pub bites menu but haven't had a chance to try it yet, so I asked Cari to bring me an order of the pub bites buffalo wings to start off as an app.  The wings were generously and evenly coated, yet still crispy!  They're a bit overpriced at $5.99 for 4 wings, but otherwise, I thought the pub bites portion was perfect for a single app. For lunch, I ordered from the pick-a-pair menu and got the chicken caesar salad and the Clubhouse grille.  Portions of chicken on the caesar were generous.  The flavor of the Clubhouse grille was a bit odd, but that might have just been the sweetness of the BBQ sauce on it.  I thought both portions-- the salad portion paired with the half sandwich-- was PERFECT for lunch.  Not too much, not too little. Finally, I couldn't resist adding on a brownie bite (which comes with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream) for $1.99.  There's no way I would have paid $5.99 for an entier giant brownie sundae, so the brownie bite portion was PERFECT and it was the perfect cap for my lunch! Overall, well done on service, portions, and food selection.  I'm not local to Bend, but based on this experience, I'll be sure to visit my local Applebee's much more often."
Rachael C.,"Bend, OR",10,9,,1.0,10/10/2015,"Bartender just kept serving drinks tonight to 2 belligerent patrons who yelled obscenities, harassed the female waitresses and guests and then said some very rude things to my party on their way out because we were the only ones who pointed out to them they were being inappropriate in a family restaurant. None of the staff did anything to diffuse the situation. I'll not be back."
Dave B.,"Redmond, OR",68,15,2,2.0,6/16/2014,My family took me here for fathers day. It was about noon and the place was under staffed. I had the Oriental salad which was mostly coleslaw with almonds. It was not good. The rest of the family enjoyed their meals. Chicken strips and a chicken wrap. The server was very nice but she was tending bar and taking orders. It took forever to get refills for our sodas. They should have had 4 or 5 other servers working. With Redmond having so many new pubs opening... well... I'd rather eat at a pub next time.
Mule D.,"Rogue River, OR",6,4,,1.0,2/2/2016,Horrible Numerous tables  not bussed or wiped down No host or hostess to seat Lettuce wilted No wonder it's less than half full at dinner time
Shawn W.,"Bend, OR",1,14,7,4.0,7/31/2015,I try to stay away from food chains but Applebee's is great :) I usually roll in on Thursdays late to avoid the crowds. The service is 90% spot on. The drinks are always made right and Ryan is a awesome bartender. One night they made a steak for me that was a little overdone and the manager gave me my drinks for free to make up for it. Give then a try because with all the choices here in Bend they stand out :)
April S.,"Terrebonne, OR",34,3,,2.0,1/2/2016,"We went there with 3 of our kids. We do not go out very often as we live pretty far out of town. With that said, I am assuming service should be much better than it was. It took almost an hour to get food and it was not a full restaurant. The food was Luke warm at best, nothing special and tasted really salty. I asked for extra sauce when they served our food, I had to press the button for the waitress call finally 15 minutes later our waitress showed up and I had to ask again for sauce. There was not many employees wondering around to flag down to refills or anything. Forget dessert, we went out for ice cream. I gave 2 stars because I did not have to cook or clean up the dishes. Def not worth the money tho."
Bobby J.,"Bend, OR",0,3,,5.0,4/26/2015,"Cant complain anymore, Ive been here many times since I last wrote a review, Kind of a regular now. I havent had any food problems,  And the service is always friendly."
Justice B.,"Eugene, OR",0,6,,3.0,9/5/2014,"I had a good time here.  The employees were very nice and the food was good.  The only problem I really had was they brought us a dirty plate.  The server was aware and went back to get a new one and never came back.  We had to call someone else over to help us. The friendly service made up for that mistake so I wasn't bothered by it personally, though I know other people would be.  I would come back"
Mike C.,"Bend, OR",7,53,7,2.0,10/1/2015,"This place is like a box of cracker jacks you never know how it's going to turn out. The restaurant got a face lift but same performance inside. Our server was good and attentive to our needs. I ordered the chicken wrap and the tortilla wrap was burnt. My wife's hamburger was not like the picture on menu. She had ordered a special with everything and got a patty with tomatoe and no lettuce & burnt buns with charcoal flavoring. We dine at Salem Applebee's and is always consitantly good. This Bend branch just doesn't get it. Other staff members looked young and confused. I hope I have your attention here go find another restaurant Bend has many. And for Applebee's you better get your ""A"" game on or your not going to make it in Bend Oregon. It is home to a lot of great eateries."
Ken D.,"Flower Mound, TX",2,25,4,1.0,4/12/2015,"Well, once again we tried to give Applebee's another chance. They slapped new paint on the outside, but same dismal service inside. We didn't even get seated this time! Came in off busy hours 4pm, maybe eight tables served. Two employees walked by us at the entrance, no I contact, no greeting. After almost 10 minutes we departed."
Jessica H.,"Bend, OR",71,41,1,1.0,11/8/2015,"I haven't been to an Applebee's before. Wow. This place is all about stoking your desires without fulfilling them. My steak was chewier than my leather jacket. Kids' Kraft mac and cheese is $5.99. Huh? And our bill for 2 adults and a kid was $40, for 3 entrées and a beer. We can get superior food for that price at any of our local breweries or great taco shops. Blech. The waitress was dare i say, aggressive. the food porn photographs and audible sizzling were offensively manipulative. It is a suburban nightmare-- something I knew in my heart but dared to test tonight. what a mistake!"
Karley W.,"Bend, OR",2,6,,1.0,11/19/2014,"I would avoid this place if you want your orders to be correct with all the ingredients that are supposed to be included. Slowest service, horrible customer service and bland food that they pull out of the freezer. Oh and it would be nice if they heated up the food before bringing it to the table. Over all not a good dinning experience Applebee's ! You would be better off going to McDonald's or burger king."
Laketears J.,"Roseville, CA",8,67,10,2.0,7/2/2013,"Stopped for lunch when we were traveling.  Chopped salad-not so fresh lettuce but was good tasting.  French onion soup-was ok.  Fish and chips- fries had nice taste but definitely was old.  Coleslaw-blend, kids Mac and cheese looked like couple days old and got worse as it sat. But service was friendly.   I would guess they make bunch of food during lunch and serve leftover till they make more for dinner."
Mama K.,"Bend, OR",0,11,,2.0,7/29/2014,"Live in Bend, Or hadn't been here for a couple years ( we try to avoid chains) won't go back for a couple more years. Got the 2/10.99 which is a salad wedge and an entree. I thought the salad wedge would be served first but after at least a 20 min. wait lettuce came with dinner. Which meant I ate the salad last as my dinner was coldish. I had the steak and onion. Looked good in the picture. Wasn 't done to my order, over cooked and barely warm. I never order steak and never at a place not known for steaks, what was I thinking?? Husband had shrimp and linguini, his meal was hot and tasty. The salad wedge was the best part of the meal. Service was just ok.  There are too many good restaurants in Bend to waste money eating here."
Keith A.,"Bend, OR",84,254,764,3.0,2/9/2013,"It's been over a year since we've been here.  Decided to give it a whirl the other night.  Not much has changed.  Read previous review.   However, two positives from this past night were:  The ""2 for 20"" specials was right up our alley.  Shared a mozzarella app and we each had the Oriental Chicken Salad----which was heavy on the cabbage & light on the lettuce (blah) but still tasted okay.  Not great.  Musta been the bottom of the bag?  Washed down with their signature Perfect Margarita, we left satisfied. Second positive was our service.  Sat at one of the elevated (tall) tables in the bar.  Our server was FANTASTIC!  Engaging, fun, attentive.  My wife thought she might have been the actual bartender.  I dunno.  She had the personality for it though.  Either way, she was a definite plus for the entire experience.  In the end, especially after reading other's reviews, I stand firm that our local Applebee's is totally hit or miss.  When it's on, it's on. When it's off....well...it can be way off and very disappointing."
Kazuya M.,"Redmond, OR",9,20,15,2.0,5/14/2014,"OK, went here last night at about 8:30 PM with the wife and 3 kids. The place was pretty empty. I ordered the new sirloin steak with the vidalia onions with Hawaiian BBQ sauce. The wife had a burger. The kids ordered from the kid's menu and got mini burgers, cheese quesadilla and a pizza. Everything tasted good except the pizza. Edible is as good as I can rate it. OK, now the service. First...they brought out our food....we didn't have any silverware, so we had to request it. Then the server forgot to bring the drinks for one of my kids. Refills, none were offered even when we had empty glasses/cups. The place was practically empty, our server seemed to be more interested in sweeping under the empty tables and get out of there ASAP when they closed instead of serving."
Sonja A.,"Bend, OR",106,31,26,3.0,12/26/2015,"I just popped in for a bit while waiting for folks at the mall across the street.  You know, when you go to a chain you should expect chain restaurant standard food.  It's going to be pretty consistent, not that great necessarily, and I think dependability (good or bad) is what counts.  As far as Applebees goes, what can set them apart is service.  In this case, I just bellied up to the bar with my laptop and snacked on a caesar salad (300 calories - the menu tells you how many calories everything is which is a bit disconcerting when all you want is to gorge yourself but your conscience steps in).  The bartender is a sweetheart.  Very attentive.  Obviously good at her job.  Engaging, providing great service and being totally awesome and never standing around - actively working the dishes, the bar and the staff drinks for their tables.  I was super glad to have her.  That is what sets 'standard franchises' apart - their people.  Krista is a jewel.  Don't go to Applebees to have a rocking meal - know what you are getting into.  But hopefully you will have a great server!"
Debbie D.,"Bend, OR",0,5,,1.0,1/10/2016,"Oh so BAD!! Our server was great but the food was ridiculous!! spinach artichoke dip was small and slightly burnt. chicken wings were all fat!! My daughters burger looked like a burnt dog poop . My husband's burger and fries and nothing else on the plate, no lettuce . tomato or pickle. Presentation was absolutely horrible, plain white plates with food just thrown on it and no garnish, all the while it sounded like a party going on in the kitchen. I have worked in restaurants for over 25 years, Definitely Not worth wasting your hard earned money on!!!!"
Art V.,"Chicago, IL",0,2,,1.0,7/23/2014,"Went through Bend on a business trip and stopped due to the convenient location. I waited inside, no one greeted me, and there were no signs directing me to wait or seat myself, so I seated myself in the bar area. Still nobody talked to me -- no waiters, no waitresses. I sat for 10 minutes trying to make eye contact with anyone, then I gave up, left and won't ever be coming back. I could have hunted someone down but I was tired and didn't mind leaving for a better option I should have chosen anyhow for dinner. As another reviewer said, there are plenty of local pubs in Bend and Redmond. Time for this Applebee's to close the doors. Service = worst I've ever experienced. Food = worse than the service, since I wasn't served any food Beverages = see the food review. Couldn't even get a glass of water. 1 out of 5 stars is being extremely generous."
