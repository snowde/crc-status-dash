C H.,"Bend, OR",0,5,,1.0,7/16/2013,Our food was cold and my husbands plate was Dirty. The server was rude and our beer was  Served in dirty glasses. We could see actual Lip marks!! Thank god the bar has NO IDEA On how to pour a beer correctly ( left 3 inches Of the glass empty) or we probably would not Have seen that the glasses were that disgusting! Please don't waste your hard earned $ here.
Obi W.,"Bend, OR",0,44,9,2.0,10/20/2013,"Triple Chocolate Meltdown is everything a dessert should be. Love it.  However my Napa Chicken & Portobellos had a few black specks that may have been mushrooms but otherwise was just chicken, onions and LOTS of salt.  My mother-in-law got a steak that was more gristle than meat. Kids liked their Mac and Cheese so if you stick with that and dessert its almost worth going back."
Everett R.,"Salida, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/15/2014,"Looked like normal apple bees. But took over 15 minutes to get a Long Island ice tea and when I did get it it looked like lemon aid. Bartender was also waiting tables away from bar area. He, as was most employees, where not dressed professional, as they all had some kind of super hero shirt on, example, Batman decal shirt, ninja turtle shirt. Food was normal. Was first time in bend location. Would not eat here again."
Cynthia P.,"Bend, OR",7,11,2,2.0,9/13/2013,"We waited 10-15 minutes after being seated, a server never even came to our table... I used the women's restroom and it was filthy with water (well I hope it was water) all over the floor, broken toilet paper holders, filthy counters, a broken leaking toilet. I returned to the table to find that no server had come yet.... Finally a manager came over and got our drink order, we waited 10 more minutes for our drinks to be brought to us by another person still not our server mind you we were sitting at a tall table right next to the bar and could see our drinks sitting there the whole time. We sat for another 20 minutes for someone to come up to our table and say ""looks like you guys are ready to order"" no introduction no specials named, no greeting, no nothing. Another server then came over and said our drinks would be compted since we had to wait so long to have our order taken, 15 minutes later the manager comes over and says that the server was incorrect and they cannot comp alcoholic drinks at all. Our appetizer arrived we got boneless buffalo wings that were luke warm, upon bitting into them it was very clear they were under a heat lamp not the greatest taste at all. When our food came, it was less than mediocre. I had the honey pepper chicken and shrimp on top of green beans and potatoes. Now I will say this the potatoes and the green beans were cooked perfectly however it was so smothered in honey it was the only taste that could be tasted so those perfectly cooked green beens and perfectly cooked potatoes could not even be tasted, this meal was also luke warm, my husband had the riblette basket and fries made into a platter. The riblettes he said tasted horrible, and were cold, the fries were gross he had one fry and said hardly any salt I took a bite of a different fry and it was so salty I gagged, fries were also cold. During all of this hardly anyone came over to our table. We never really knew who our actual server was. We saw 3 different servers come to our table and the manager. The last server that came to our table we started telling him we were not satisfied and before we could even finish speaking he was walking away and calling over the manager no words accept "" i will get her and yup she is on her way over here"" We left very unsatisfied with the food and the wait staff service!  Now with that being said I will say this the new manager Liz went out of her way to try to make things better for us. She comped our meals, she spoke with us she apologized, she offered us new meals (though we declined) and asked us to return! Liz is a great addition to this particular Applebee's and I personally see her making great changes. We will try Applebee's in bend one more time and it is only because the manager made such an effort to turn around a bad situation. So because of that manager and only because of that manager am I giving 2 stars in this review otherwise it would have been a 1 or less."
Glenn R.,"Bend, OR",0,4,,1.0,4/6/2015,"Went in hungry. Let hungry. Reason, ordered a full rack of ribs, but got a full rack of meatless bones.  Did not know there was such a thing a Vegan ribs.  Server was nice, so tipped as usual."

D H.,"Bend, OR",0,7,,1.0,12/10/2013,Has to be the worst Applebee's I've been to. Service was unattentive at best. Waited for fork for salad for 5 minutes then steak came before I could take two bites of it. Had to stop eating steak die to the taste of freezer burn.
A A.,"Issaquah, WA",3,16,,2.0,1/15/2013,"My husband and I recently moved from Seattle- we enjoyed a particular Applebee's restaurant up there and were excited to see one in Bend.  We were seated in a booth where we sat and sat and sat until finally someone took our order. We ordered the spinach and artichoke hot dip, but it was just spinach and not very good. Our dishes showed up and were only marginal. I could have done better by buying a frozen bag of chicken and veggies and it would have tasted better than the slop that arrived. My husband's pasta was less than appetizing and my asian chicken salad was only so-so. It was such a disappointment that a favorite place to go for dinner turned out to be worse than a frozen entree from the grocery store."
Mike V.,"San Carlos, CA",0,9,,1.0,7/26/2012,"Generally applebee's is a nice family place to get good food and service. Well this place was NOT. It had the worst service a restaurant  would have.  It took someone 10 minutes to order our drinks.   About another 10 minutes later they finally took our order for food and brought us our drinks.  After we took our order we realized that there was no silverware at our table.  We asked for silverware and when they brought it to us it was dirty.  It was a disaster.  We had to ask for cleaner silverware. About  45 minutes later are food finally came, but we still had no silverware.  Finally are silverware came and it looked clean.   We ate are food which was okay.   I wish someone could come from the food critic business and see how there experience was."
Lindsey D.,"Sandpoint, ID",7,3,,5.0,12/31/2012,"Service was fast, waiter wasn't pushy or overbearing. He was friendly and there when we needed him :)"
Shanna K.,"Gresham, OR",3,71,10,4.0,11/3/2012,BEST Applebees we have ever been to. Food was AWSOME. Waitress was great (other then having to wait 15 min for our check) loved it! Best Strawberry margarita I've ever had. half price appitizer
Mel C.,"Bakersfield, CA",21,299,154,1.0,4/13/2010,"I've been to my share of Applebees before. THIS ONE SUCKS!!! We ordered drinks, appetizers and lunch and it was all sick! The food was not good at all. At one point, the waitress informed us that our Spinach Artichoke dip was sitting under the heat lamp. Which, DUH, that isn't really something you should share with your customers. Yes, we all assumed that it would sit under a heat lamp, but don't tell us that. The Red Apple Sangria was horrible. I've ordered it from another Applebees and loved it. I assumed that it would taste the same at this one and boy was I wrong. It was lacking so much. The waitress was horrible; the manager was like 13 years old and didn't really seem to make the experience any better. The ONLY good thing about the entire experience was the hostess. She seemed like the only smart person there and she was super nice.  After lunch, we all referred to this Applebees as Asslebees! Ew!"
Terri B.,"Troutdale, OR",0,13,,1.0,1/29/2013,"I had to put a star down, but if given the choice I would not have even done that.  It was probably the worst restaurant experience i have ever had.  14 of us went there for a birthday party,  and the crappy service started the minute we walked in.   It took 15 mins just to get our drinks ordered.  Drinks came out at all different times.  Two drinks took close to 20 minutes and two were completely forgotten.  When dinner finally arrived, out of 14 people 5 dinners were sent back.  I ordered a steak with spinach stuffed portabello mushrooms, what I got was a pile of potatoes and mushy veggies.  I asked the waitress about the stuffed mushrooms and she sent the mamanger over.  He explained that they were out of mushrooms (of course no one told me). After several people from the table complained about dinner and sent their meals back, I think he decided to take it all out on me.  When he was done and left the table, I was in shock...When the checks came, they did comp us 5 drinks, and 4 meals.  The manager came back and said he was sorry, then decided we needed to hear all his excuses of what went wrong, and of course he wasn't included.  While we were waiting for our food, I noticed a couple come in the door and were not helped, and they left.  A family of 4 came in and waited several minutes before someone walked by and said that they would help them in a minute.  Of course a minute took several and they decided to leave.   Never again.....The meal comps and ""I'm sorrys"" will never make me come back."
Michelle D.,"Bend, OR",8,36,,1.0,4/27/2006,okay so the food is so so but the service....you have to wait 15 minuts before someone even comes and takes your drinks and then u have to wait another 40 minutes to get your order in and then by the time your waiting for your food your sompletely pissed off and bored
