Local_Guy ..,"Dacula, GA",1,31,,3.0,9/1/2017,"Applebee's, the apex of the lower end chain restaurants. Typical sports bar with a variety of decent food. Staff is friendly and attentive and it is a clean place. This location is smack dab in the middle of happening area of Bethlehem, which consists of 2 large plazas. Applebee's is to chain restaurants like what MTV is to legitimate award shows. It's the lower end of the chain, but still edible. This location is pretty good though, the food is fresh and comes quickly. Local Guy tip- order the 2 for $20.00"
Ken P.,"Winder, GA",2,3,,2.0,1/9/2018,"Went for the Riblet special. Believe me, not so special. Just was not very good. Stringy and tasteless. The table based POS system was dead, so has to wait for check. Waitress was pretty good, attentive and courteous, but did not make up for food."
Shane W.,"Buford, GA",44,10,5,1.0,12/20/2017,"I recently placed my first to go order with the Bethlehem, GA location. I was incredibly disappointed with this experience. I had 4 issues with this order. The first, when I went to pick it up, I was missing one of my drinks and had to ask for it before I left without it. Second, when I got home I noticed one of my sides was completely missing all together. Third, the steak I had ordered (kids 4oz) that I called about prior to driving out there regarding how it's cooked and was told it was cooked medium (which was what I wanted), ended up being very well done. Shoe leather consistency. Fourth, I also requested a side of BBQ sauce for the kids chicken fingers during that same call to the store prior to driving out, and that was missing as well. I don't normally go to Applebee's as I've never had much luck in the past with other locations. However, I was given a gift card and decided to give the new Bethlehem location a shot. Once again, I was left incredibly disappointed. Additionally, since I paid for the order with a gift card, I was told by the restaurant manager when I called back that a refund could not be issued. The experience was absolutely terrible and a waste of the gift card I was given."
Susan C.,"Broomfield, CO",0,20,,1.0,11/19/2017,"The service here is horrible. We waited nearly an hour for our food. Apparently they have a staffing problem in the kitchen, if they are having their customers wait that long for their food orders. We had to wait 30 minutes for ice cream for my granddaughter. We won't be coming back to this location."
Trina A.,"Dacula, GA",0,2,,1.0,11/3/2017,"Although the waitress was nice, the service was extremely slow and the food was terrible. I definitely won't be back."
Robert H.,"Dacula, GA",0,10,,4.0,4/13/2017,"Eating in at this location is pretty pleasant and the food taste up to the restaurant chain standards.  The workers are friendly and the place is clean.  My only complaint is the drive in pickup.  Too many mistakes when ordering online.  An example is ordering a custom burger, they didn't get the order right.  If I order a burger without cheese, they added cheese.  My advice is double check your order yourself.  When the host is delivering your order to your car, they have a habit of reading to fast, especially if it's a long list."
J W.,"Auburn, GA",1,20,1,1.0,1/23/2016,"Terrible service and the food was inedible. We started out with the meatball appetizer. The four tiny meatballs tasted like generic frozen meatballs that you get at low end grocery stores. They were drizzled with institutional Marinara sauce and served with a half piece of stale bread. My husband ordered the Salmon and it was decent. I ordered the steak, medium rare, with grilled shrimp and Parmisan sauce, with baked potato and Ceasars Salad for my meal. I got my entrée before my salad. The steak was ice cold raw and the potato was not done.....hard as rock and barely warm. I rarely send food back, but $19, I expected a whole lot more, so we politely sent it back and asked that a properly cooked steak and DONE potato be served instead. And I had to remind our waitress that had ordered a salad. She brought it out on a warm plate. I ate it anyway.  While I was eating my salad, I noticed another server in back of the restaurant wipe her nose, bare handed and proceed to smear whatever she retrieved from her nose on the wall and then go directly to one of her tables. When our waitress finally brought my steak entrée back, it was quite obvious that the kitchen staff had just stuck the whole plate in the microwave. The steak was extra well done to the point it curled up around the edges. The shrimp had been vulcanized into rubber, the potato was still raw and the sour cream had boiled into a leather substitute.  That was it. We sent it back and had it removed from our tab. The manager came over and apologized and gave me a card for a free meal. I gave the card to my husband. He travels for work, so maybe he can use it. I won't be going back."
Jill H.,"Lawrenceville, GA",1,5,,5.0,10/7/2016,"We eat at this Applebee's quite often.  The staff is nice and friendly and we rarely have any problems.  On the rare occasion that something is not right, it is immediately corrected.  I place to go orders here as well on occasion and the order is correct.  I recommend this location."
King L.,"Auburn, GA",0,16,,4.0,7/17/2016,Despite the bad reviews I gave this place a shot on 2 separate occasions and so far have been very pleased. The service was quick & prompt and the food was great. I had Morgan the first time a few weeks back and Shelby tonight as my waitresses. Both were super friendly and provided great service. Never went without a fresh refill and the food orders were always right. Can't say my experience reflected some of the others so maybe Applebee's upper management has took note and is making the necessary changes.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the first time I came they were out of a few things but Ms. Morgan more than made up for it and made the visit very pleasant. I'll keep returning until they give me a good reason not to.
Kari H.,"Winder, GA",0,3,,1.0,5/21/2016,"Unfortunately we did not have a good experience. We had a party of 4 and it took over an hour to get our food. It was 5 o'clock on a Saturday and they were not busy. I ordered a steak medium, what I got was a black chard piece of meat. Another person in our party's food was incorrect and sent back. They received their new food quickly, it was just a baked potato. Because Applebee's food can be cross contaminated and not safe if you have a food allergy, which this person does. My food was brought in a to go bag because everyone else was done eating. This is not what I had expected when I went OUT to dinner  We will not be going back."
Damian R.,"Dacula, GA",0,1,,1.0,8/24/2015,They're horribly slow. Majority of my families was cold. I recommend longhorn steakhouse over by the carmike movie theater instead.
Heather C.,"Bethlehem, GA",3,23,,5.0,9/17/2015,"We visited on a Thurs evening around 7pm and business was steady but not crazy, our party of 2 was seated immediately. Our waitress Tabatha took our order by memory and got everything right. My medium steak was perfectly done & juicy. The food arrived in avg amount of time compared to every other Applebee's. The service was great, no complaints here."
Alex K.,"Bethlehem, GA",0,5,,1.0,1/21/2016,We really haven't eaten at Applebee's in quite some time but we received a gift card and decided to try it out again. Hate to say it but there's a reason we don't eat here. The presentation of the food is just terrible. We ordered our food Togo and quickly checked it and went home. Went to open our food and our burgers were missing their top bun and we had barely any fries. Almost as if someone had been eating our food. If we go here again it'll only be for drinks. The food is your typical bar food.
A C.,"Bethlehem, GA",0,9,2,5.0,11/1/2015,"New local restaurant w/ good food & service. At first opening, the latter was not superb but it has definitely gotten better-and it was expected. Shop local!"
