Alexander M.,"Las Vegas, NV",403,1023,2304,3.0,7/21/2017,"Applebee's is one of those ""once in a blue moon"" type of restaurants for me just because the food is hit or miss. My family decided to treat me to a nice lunch before my flight back to Las Vegas so they decided on Applebee's. I'm not ungrateful so of course I accepted!  When we first walked in we were greeted right away and also seated pretty quickly. They weren't very busy at all which ended up being a plus for us, or so you would've thought! Our waitress was sweet but oh my so ditzy and at first it was funny but it turned to be a little annoying when we had to keep repeating for certain request like water, sauces, refills etc. On top of the forgotten request there was an issue with my step mom's order and just other little things.  The 2 for $20 menu is always a life saver because it really des end up being a lot cheaper than ordering everything separately! I went with the full platter of ribs and my little brother decided on the chicken fingers. For an appetizer we of course went with the boneless wings (HOT) ! The food was actually not that bad and I enjoyed my Top Shelf Patron Margarita! Overall this visit get's a solid 3 stars!"
Pat S.,"Northfield, MN",0,3,,1.0,1/7/2018,service was terrible at this location. Seated at a little two-person booth there is really not room for that little black box especially since it didn't work. Ordered a beer took 10 minutes to come and it was lukewarm. Must have been poured in a warm mug. when the waiter finally... Finally came back around I told him about it and all I got was... Oh really? waited another 10 minutes for another beer. the only thing those little black boxes do is make it more difficult for your waiter to actually interact with you as a person. totally dissatisfied and will not go back to this one ever. BTW never got comped for the warm beer that I only drink half of and it took him forever to take that mug off a table. I had another Empty Glass and beer bottle before he came and took the warm bottle of beer... Really?
Kevin B.,"Eden Prairie, MN",319,66,62,4.0,12/18/2017,"We stopped by Applebee's for half price appetizers after a Timberwolves game. This neighborhood establishment had a great vibe from the moment we walked in. We were introduced to the game of Bargo, that had prizes of free food. There were definitely regulars who showed up for this festivity. I enjoyed the vibe and energy of the restaurant."
Chris M.,"Minneapolis, MN",47,219,7,2.0,10/17/2016,Sometimes you just want water!  Usually a sign to servers that your not going to order much or tip well.  We tip quite well!   Just wanted a quick light dinner as we were working on the yard all day.  After bringing our water she disappeared for 15 minutes to take our dinner order.  We wanted cup of soup and just a few side dishes.  Son ordered a full dinner.  She forgot the salad with my son's dinner and then forget to bring my wife's dish.  She didn't return until after our meal was done with the bill.  We told her about the missing dish.  She ran to kitchen and delivered a scalding hot plate with dried up food on it.. Ha!  Politely asked her to removed the item from the bill.  I've been burned by Applebee's before.  Why do I come back!?
Owen R.,"Minneapolis, MN",53,12,,1.0,12/6/2016,"Dont bother with this place. They sold this ""butchers meat and potatoes"" as a good dish. The menu states it comes with tomatoes...it didnt. A stout gravy...it wasnt. The garlic mashed potatoes had no garlic whatsoever. They pushed a garlic ciabatta bread...it was the heel of a loaf that they drizzled melted butter with a hint of garlic in it. My girlfriend order the mac n cheese with chicken...more like butter noodles with a little cheese sauce and chicken fingers across the top."
Sarah S.,"Mississauga, Canada",204,199,1912,1.0,8/21/2015,Meh as much as I dislike their food the service was awful too last night too it took them 30 mins to get our apps out!!Don't know y I went there!!
Tam J.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,17,7,3.0,5/16/2017,The food was good. But the issue I had was this guy... just setting food where ever he wanted on the table. He wasn't friendly either. Towards end of meal he actually spoke to us
Jeanette S.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,15,126,4.0,5/1/2017,"always good eats, good wait staff, and convenient location."
Zachary V D.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,20,3,2.0,6/9/2015,"Placed on-line order through the Applebee's web site. Simple order and no modifications-chopped chicken salad, basil soup, bacon cheeseburger, loaded brownie. Requested silverware (plasticware).  Order prepared quickly and warm on pick up. All good. Get to hotel room- burger is dry. Applebee's forgot to add mustard/mayo/ketchup. Even though I ordered soup and asked for silverware- a spoon was not provided. So, I will survive but I did want to take advantage of the Applebee's guest experience survey so went on-line to complete. Survey was kludgy, slow to load (very slow even though I was on high speed broadband), and I gave up about half way through so was unable to complete the survey.  Called the Manager on duty to say your survey is broke and what's up with not providing a packet of mustard/ketchup and no spoon??? He was a good guy and tried to make it right on my next visit, but I'm not from here and just passing through.   So-Yeah it was Meh. I've experienced better. C'mon Applebee's this is easy stuff to master."
Caitlin F.,"Seattle, WA",276,2,,1.0,6/21/2015,"If I could have rated it with 0 stars, I would have.  We arrived and waited for someone to seat us because no one was at the front. More than two parties were waiting and the place wasn't very crowded.  When we were seated it took 10 mins until the waitress took our order. We ordered everything then and there because it was getting pretty late. 45 mins later... My grandmother called her over to ask her to please check on our order because she hadn't once asked if we needed anything or checked on us.  The waitress came back to tell us that when she was entering our order the ""computer made a mistake.""  We immediately left.  The wait staff is very poor. It's an Applebee's so I wasn't expecting much... But was severely disappointed when the service was so bad.  Avoid if you can."
Deana M.,"Brimfield, IL",88,6,,5.0,3/11/2016,Crystal panek is the First Lady of the bees and is awesome. Even though she didn't give us free booze she gave us a free app!! Great!!
Joey Z.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,17,33,5.0,6/1/2014,"What a find! This unique establishment has all the comforts of refined dining in a relaxing atmosphere. I was delighted to find my Riblet basket full of grease and fat! I am also following a high fat diet so they accommodated me by bringing me a tub of butter with a spoon for dessert. I can''t say enough about our server who had yellow teeth and disappeared for long periods of time for a ""smoke break"". How lucky they are that Applebee's allows their staff to wait on tables only when they feel like it.  I wish there were more then one of these fun and fancy restaurants."
Paul T.,"Green Bay, WI",20,3,,2.0,12/20/2015,1/2 hour to get our order.  Had to send my steak and wife's shrimp back twice.  Had to ASK to be comped the steak.  And finished the evening up with someone's vomit in the men's bathroom.   Just a WONDERFUL experience.   At least our server Shelby hung in there through it all.
Minna C.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,6,13,2.0,9/4/2015,"The entree food tasted good. We came in a group of four. Ordered two steak, burger and fish and chips. The service was alright, we were quickly seated and our order was taken fast too. Only problem we had was the wait. It took over an hour to get our food. Customers that came after us already ate and left too. We had like three different people coming to deliver our order which seemed to be messy because they accidentally brought double of some orders, but they kindly gave it to us on the house for the long wait."
Kassie J.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,3,,1.0,1/26/2015,"When we walked in the door, there was no Host at the stand. The manager looked us in the eye and walked away. An off the clock employee came over and sat us; without silverware mind you.  Took several minutes for the server to notice us and get a drink order. However we did receive the drinks in a timely manner. But then waited another 8 minutes for her to return for a food order.  We ordered simply mozzarella sticks and a bacon cheese burger with cheddar cheese.  The burger arrived with no bacon and American cheese. When the server came over; we made her aware of the missing bacon and incorrect type of cheese. To which she replied ""oh I even told them in back."" She walked off with the burger and had them remake the burger.  I received my burger 5mn later by the same manager who ignored is when we came in; and my burger was comped. Overall, this was a dining experience of the most unpleasant nature. I felt very unwelcome and felt as if I burdened them while I was there.  We will NOT be returning to this location."
Art T.,"Eagan, MN",44,11,2,4.0,5/22/2015,"Great food, Hit or Miss Service (Depends on Server I believe) Nice decent price casual restaurant with nice ambiance. Fun times most of the times but here's a horror story to duck out a star, Once we landed to the rightmost wing section of the restaurant that was super cold. We had to do carry out because the place was super cold. We notified the server but seems like she didn't cared much; She replied you are the 4th one to say that."
Travis K.,"Seattle, WA",3,14,2,2.0,11/2/2013,"The food was ok for myself and our 2 kids, but my wife's food wasn't that good. She ordered a steak, medium, it came well done, and poorly seasoned. She said it was severely over salted. The broccoli that came with looked like it was the frozen type they managed to over cooked. The mushrooms that came with the steak were barely covered in sauce.  This was quite possibly the worst food experience we've had there."
Unknown U.,"Bloomington, IN",0,4,1,3.0,3/24/2015,"Kinki Margarita worth trying, it was not crowded and there's only one to two person taking order.  The others who clear the table didn't really have a look on you although you've already try to raise your hand to get attention. The person who serve me is doing a good service but i think maybe lack of waiter or waitress who's in charge to take order that's why it took awhile. As I can see those who's in charge to take order are busy running around. which is only 1-2 person."
Raisa B.,"Shakopee, MN",191,102,65,4.0,1/11/2013,Applebee's is a staple when I'm home in Minnesota visiting my family.  Nothing beats the soup and sandwich lunch special for really cheap.  I had tomato basil soup and a half oriental chicken salad.  It hit the spot after 3 hours of shopping.  Our server was quick and friendly.  He got us refills of our iced tea without even asking.  He didn't pressure us to leave when we were finished even though they were pretty busy. It was standard Applebee's food with great service.
Catherine K.,"Minneapolis, MN",18,62,7,2.0,11/27/2013,"The food was good, for a chain, but our service was very poor. It was very busy, so I give them that, but a table of 12 who came in 15 minutes after us, were served and out the door while our table of two was left in the dust by the same server. Maybe he got a guaranteed tip with that party number. I can say he would have with us too if he would have acknowledged us."
Steve L.,"Bismarck, ND",0,17,,1.0,7/13/2014,"I want to give it zero stars but cant. People waiting at door, but host would not seat people in one area because ""it was closed"" he dropped the f-bomb in front of my kids. Food was terrible(how hard is it to nuke frozen food anyway?) needless to say i am ruined on applebees for a long time and it is one of my longtime favorite places:("
Erik L.,"Chaska, MN",3,13,9,4.0,8/31/2013,"Food is standard, the really sad thing is that if you buy a drink here it will cost more than some other cities because of Bloomington liquor taxes. They have an extra three percent to all liquor sold in bars."
Dan A.,"Minneapolis, MN",7,121,56,4.0,6/11/2013,"$5 Burger & Fries on Monday. Also $5 crappy beer pitchers, $8 for real beer pitchers."
Kyla A.,"Bloomington, MN",1,3,,2.0,3/13/2014,Had the napa chicken and portobello. Sub par. I wouldn't be here if my team hadn't picked it out. Try and stay away from Franchise.
Tom B.,"Chanhassen, MN",0,3,,1.0,1/13/2012,"If I could give it no stars I would. I was in the Southtown area doing Christmas shopping with my girlfriend. Since we were done shopping we decided to get some food. The food was what you would expect from Applebees, I'll let you decide there. But the waitress was slow, it was during happy hour, so I gave her a break. I payed for the meal and tipped well. We remained in the bar for another 10 minutes after signing the check. It did not phase me as I was sitting there so long after I signed the check I was never returned my credit card. I thought I had already been returned it.  I live about 20 miles away in Chanhassen and two days later I realized I didn't have that credit card. I checked my statement and found Applebees to be the last purchase, phew! I called the manager and he said he had it, and that I could come get it. When I arrived he was too busy to meet with me, although the restaurant itself was very mellow. I talked to a hostess and she said call in and complain, because that is what I wanted to do! It had taken over an hour out of my day and 40 miles of gas to drive there and back for the sole purpose of picking up my credit card. That night, I called in and talked to the manager, still trying to be respectful but let him know it was an unnecessary hassle. The manager agreed and apologized. He offered me a complementary meal that they would send to me from corporate. I accepted and have been waiting ever since. This is over a month ago.  The management is unprofessional."
Dianne H.,"Minneapolis, MN",17,9,,5.0,7/30/2014,"Great neighborhood style place. The service was great, the appetizers and steak were unexpectedly good and cooked to order. The server was friendly and attentive to our preferences. There were some noise makers but hey, it was Saturday night and it was all good. The atmosphere is laid back, a comfortable, clean place to enjoy fresh and flavorful food."
Terry H.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,3,4,1.0,9/14/2014,I think Steve L review quite accurate. People can wait a long time at door and not get noticed.   Have seen walkout.
Jackie R.,"Nokomis, Minneapolis, MN",117,184,8,2.0,3/12/2009,"ok, I went here because my mom wanted to have the 2 for $20 special. My grandma used to like going here and I think my mom was thinking about her, so off we went.  For this deal you get an appetizer (from a choice of 4) and 2 entress (from a choice of like 8 or 10).  We ordered the spinach artichoke dip for the appetizer. It was terrible. I mean really, it was a waste of an appetizer if I've ever had one. First of all, I prefer my spinach artichoke dip to be served with bread rather than tortilla chips. Strike one. I also like it to have some flavor. Strike two.  For the entree, I ordered the riblets. The sauce was good and what meat they did have on them was good as well. I just wish there had been more meat. I mean really, if I took all the edible meat off these things it would have maybe filled a shot glass. It was ridiculous.  My mom ordered the 7 oz. house steak. It was nothing exceptional but I will give them the fact that they actually cooked it just as she asked. It was tender, and that's always a plus. At least it didn't have the consistency of an old shoe. Yay!  I probably would have given them a 1, but cooking the steak correctly along with tasty (though woefully short on actual meat) riblets earned them another star. I was going to take one off because when I ordered a cherry coke the waiter said ok rather than inform me that they actually had Pepsi products (in which case I would have ordered a Mt. Dew as I don't care for Pepsi cola) but he was a nice guy so I didn't.  That's how I roll. ;)"
Kathy M.,"Lincoln, MA",0,4,,5.0,9/2/2012,"This Applebee's is nothing special at all. Mediocre food at a good price and fast. The only reason I give it 5 stars is for the excellent service by a young waiter called Omar. Props to you, you really should be working at a higher level eatablishment."
Eric H.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,12,,4.0,8/2/2010,"Applebee's are Applebee's for the most part, you know what you are going to get.  What separates this location from the others is the bartending staff.  There are three primary PM bartenders and all three of them are a complete delight.  I go in there after work for happy hour anywhere from 1-3 times a week just because of Jen, Beth, and Joy.  I am being completely unbiased, I didn't know these ladies before I started going there, but it is totally my place now.  Go see them!"
