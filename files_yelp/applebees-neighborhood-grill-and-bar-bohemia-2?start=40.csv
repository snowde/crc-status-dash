Jess K.,"Pelham, NY",165,1240,162,4.0,3/15/2006,I like going to this location more than the Lake Grove one just because it is less crowded. The Applebee's in Lake Grove makes it a really popular spot for those coming from the mall/movies or heading out to the nearby bars. This one is more removed so the wait for a table isn't as ridiculous. Go here after 10pm for half priced appetizers and drinks! Just be careful because half priced does not equal half calories. Ha!
Jeremia F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",218,421,61,1.0,9/21/2012,"Came here on a Sunday night and was completely baffled by how bad everything . I understand that it is a Sunday and that  means football this time of year but why can't you get your act together. We were seated pretty quick but it took forever to get a server to stop by our table and then the drinks never came until we were therefor at least 30 minutes. I order one of the lighter fare options because everything else at Applebee's is at least 1200 calories with no real nutritional value.The steak I ordered was way over cooked and considering I couldn't even get a manager's attention to come over and address my dissatisfaction with my meal I choked the tough flavorless hunk of meat down the hatch. The side of ""Grilled"" shrimp were repulsive, They were essentially precooked salad shrimp that were sauteed and then possibly thrown on a flat top for 2 minutes to make them appear to have been grilled. It was ridiculously bad and I can't recommend this location to anyone."
ELITIA L.,"New York, NY",86,482,927,2.0,8/11/2007,"This trendy neighborhood grill by celebrity chef and owner Tyler Florence is a big hit with the twenty-year-olds. All the kids know it. . .  two-fers on drinks and 1/2 price appetizers after ten (don't they drink in parking lots anymore?).  The waitstaff are mindless fetchers who take and bring your order with little consideration or thought.  The bottom of the TGIF spectrum.  But for $10 walk-out price, after tip, two drinks and food, how can you go wrong?"
