Russ B.,"Newberry, FL",16,69,93,4.0,10/29/2017,We ate here since it was so close to our hotel. When I checked in I noticed their low rating. I found both the food and set on par with sports bar chain restaurants. I had the Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp and it was very good.
Brad R.,"Maple Valley, WA",146,171,222,2.0,3/9/2017,"Well sad to say my second visit didnt live up to my first one. If it wasnt for the awesome waitress in the bar this would have been one star. I ordered the 10oz sirloin medium rare. It came well done and if I hadnt been starving after a day of travel I would have went someplace else. It was barely chewable. Other  choices around, just have to drive a few minutes to get there. Nice place for a drink and close to hotels is the only plus."
Mary K.,"Richland, WA",64,2,,2.0,12/16/2017,The food was great but the service was very very slow. They were nice but it took a hour to get our food due to the fact that it took 30 minutes for them to ask for our order.
Sandra M.,"San Ysidro, CA",27,46,57,4.0,8/29/2017,"I'm surprised on how good the steak was perfect medium rare , the baked potato on point and even broccoli tasted yummy , the service was super good the only thing I don't like is the tablets in the table , I almost got charged   1.99 for using it to see what games they had I draw something, the table tells you 1.99 unblock all games but they charge you if you use it automatically to your bill . Unlike other restaurants where you have some free games and you can pay for the nicer once . Back to food the 2 for 25 menu is great and also half price appetizers from 3/6 and from 9 to close the wing are actually good !!! Not the steak quesadillas poorly served ."
Darin B.,"Boise, ID",27,1,2,1.0,12/1/2016,"Kind of a long day.  I didn't want to drive anywhere and thought ""what the heck"" I'll watch the game and since it was next to my hotel. Service was decent and I was enjoying the game.  I ordered an iceberg wedge and an order of chicken wings.  The wedge came out first,  it was good,  fresh and a good to start a meal.  The wings were brought out next.  I took a bite (while hoping Dallas wasn't going to score a touchdown) and was chewing and swallowing my first bite and noticed that the wing was raw - not a little pink but RAW (see my pic). I do like my steaks cooked to medium but my chicken needs to be fully cooked because of my silly aversion to salmonella poisoning.  I notified the server,  she took the plate and left.  A few minutes later the manager came out and apologized and stated a new order was being prepared.  I thanked him but declined.  He didn't charge me for the wedge and my drink and offered me the wings to go.  I didn't have an appetite at that point.  If you go,  you should probably avoid the wings and check any chicken you order to be sure that it is cooked enough to be safely consumed. Otherwise,  maybe keep looking for another location to satisfy your hunger."
Ruben B.,"Downey, CA",75,5,,1.0,9/10/2017,Been here a few times but today's service is bad. The bartender is all by herself acting as bartender and waitress. Not good. I waited 10 minutes before they asked me what I wanted to drin
Mallory G.,"Blackfoot, ID",48,12,,3.0,8/10/2017,"The service provided was good and the facility seemed well maintained. They were kind to our children and were very accommodating. I wasn't a huge fan of the food, it had an unusual flavor in my opinion, but that's subjective. The food is reasonably priced."
sizzle G.,"Eugene, OR",0,64,136,1.0,4/2/2017,If you have 5 tables in the entire restaurant and your day has just begun there is absolutely Zero excuses for horrible service!  The manager 4/2/17 @noon was a disgrace and a lazy example the 2 other staff members doing nothing except holding the wall up! A stack of dirty dishes sitting on our table throughout this meal was GROSS!
Addie G.,"Milford, UT",0,11,,2.0,7/4/2017,"There was about 4-5 tables filled in the whole place, yet we were all shoved into the same corner. The waitress came around 3 times. Once to take our order, once to check on us, and then once to give us our check. What happens when they are busy? What really set me off to leave a review is that my husbands burger was very burnt and had a hair in it! We just got a ""sorry"" it was clear she didn't really care. She offered us a new burger but he declined since we were about to leave, and he had lost his appetite. We ended up still having to pay for the burger. We would've accepted the new burger and given it to our dog or something if we knew we were going to have to pay 12 bucks for a burger he took 3 bites out of! We didn't want to be obnoxious customers and ask not to pay for his meal, but I was kind of shocked she still made us pay for it.  I don't know if she didn't care because she thought we were looking for a free meal or what. My husband took 3 bites out of his hamburger, so obviously that wasn't the case. My mom was the one who actually told the waitress since my husband and I hate having to confront staff with complaints. I'm disappointed with the lack of care with how disgusting it was, and for charging us even after we mentioned it and she could see that he hardly ate any! Terrible customer service!"
JB P.,"Pocatello, ID",2,29,16,4.0,3/20/2017,"Service was fast and friendly, and continued to offer excellent service! Food was hot and tasty. It also looked the part. Beer was cold. Bathroom and tables were clean. 2 apps, 3 meals and 6 drinks and meal was under $60"
Julie G.,"Orofino, ID",18,11,15,4.0,4/7/2017,Excellent service. Great food. Had the steak and shrimp and the steak was tender and juicy. My husband had the porkchop and it wasn't dry at all. The green beans were fresh and cooked perfectly. We will be back.
Michael J.,"Round Hill, VA",0,7,2,4.0,7/30/2017,"Excellent and proactive service from Austin and the rest of the service team. Great food, well served."
Iris T.,"Chubbuck, ID",8,4,6,4.0,9/14/2016,"We were seated immediately and our drink and appetizer showed up almost immediately. The price was reasonable considering the generous portion size, and everything was cooked to order. Colby was a friendly, attentive, patient server."
Brian Y.,"Richmond, VT",0,11,,1.0,8/17/2016,"I've never exorience such poor service at a Applebees.  Walked in, place less than half full, seated quickly and told maitress would be right over.  Waited over 7 minutes, nothing!!  Finally I flag a manager and ask if anyone would be our maitress?   The manger takes our order, app & drinks come quickly. Manager comes back to take main order.  Food service reasobable at this point.  My beer is empty, but is anyone around, NO!   Finally flag the manager again to order beer.  Then wait, and wait and wait.  Finally some other waitress delivers beer and I'm told bartender is busy.  REALLY,  the place is still half empty and how much effort to pour a draft! I'm soo done with Applebees if this represents their level of service.  If I could give them ZERO stars I would.  The entire crew at this Applebees should be fired.  There is no management here, just a bunch of folks killing time.  Applebee should be ashamed of their management if this is what they produce from their training."
Lenchi J.,"Boise, ID",464,9,10,1.0,10/26/2015,"HELLOOO APPLEBEES MANAGEMENT!!!!! OCT 26 2015 430 PM  Restaurant  not busy, girl who seated us was busy talking to others as we are being seated. Our server comes to take our order and says something random about other server  and walks off before taking our order. Ordered appetizers (wonton potstickers), was excellent. Main course fish and chips. 3 pieces 1 was cold the others mediocre.  Ordered burger, asked for mustard, server sprinted by and dropped off mustard without speaking a word. Table was dirty....and resturant not busy , could have been cleaned before hand. We eat out a lot. ,tip well, etc ...but this service was horrible , will not be back Tip to servers, not my problem if you hate your job, be nice, be kind , be friendly.  We Will not be back.."
Jeff B.,"Beaverton, OR",3,47,13,2.0,4/13/2015,"Don't waste your hard earned money here! It's not that the food is bad, or that the service sucks,  it's because there is no value here!  Their portions are SMALL!  I patronized the place last night, ordering a Thai chicken salad to go. I got a small salad with a small sliced chicken breast, 2 small dressing containers, and A bread stick that smelled and tasted of some type of seafood! Not a salad worth $12!!! Go elsewhere, unless you're not hungry!"
Dave H.,"Boise, ID",89,1,1,1.0,3/24/2016,Wish I could give it no stars.I got a burger and it's so burnt that I can't believe it.It definitely doesn't look anything like the Comercial. I would stay far away
Shai C.,"Northglenn, CO",31,15,1,5.0,4/30/2016,"Austin the bartender is the man! If you're of age sit there. They have great local brews on draft. I reccomend the Welcom To Idaho IPA, Apocolypse Ipa and the Dagger Falls IPA.  The food is consistent as always. I got the hot buffalo wings and the bourbon street steak as always. Very satified. Can't emphasize the bartender enough."
Todd H.,"Crested Butte, CO",0,4,,5.0,7/24/2016,"Just popped in for take out burger and one beer. Krystal was quickly taking my drink order and recommending some menu options. The host was great also coming in and leaving, but didn't catch his name.  Just finished my burger and it was great. Sometimes you wish you could hang out longer with a friendly place like this. Hope to be back."
Ross T.,"Kuna, ID",0,2,,2.0,7/11/2016,Nothing special here folks. Nothing exceptional to say. Just standard large chain atmosphere and food
Wayne C.,"Bonney Lake, WA",0,2,,1.0,7/10/2016,Couldn't tell you about the quality of food since we waited over 15 minutes for a server to acknowledge us. Never happened; we left and no one even asked us how our meal was.
Summer B.,"Post Falls, ID",0,31,3,4.0,6/20/2016,"Love that they are open late at night.  This chain's food is always a tad too salty, but the food and service were great.  Sweet potatoes fries are yummy.  The clam chowder was decent."
R W.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,24,2,4.0,1/17/2015,"I'm always a little surprised when people give a place like this one star. Unless the food is total swill (read: you'd walk out rather than eat it) or the servers are obnoxious beyond repair, it just seems a little unfair. I mean, it's Applebee's...if you go here looking for Top Chef you deserve one star for idiocy.  I ordered chicken tortilla soup, it was in front of me five minutes later and was pretty tasty. I then ordered a salmon dish that was forgettable but once again, I wasn't there to take pictures of the food, if you know what I mean.  My server/bartender, Austin, was ON IT and super friendly. He hooked up a solid libation. That and the Clippers game and I was good! Food:3  Service: 5+ Drink: 5 For the record, I must state that I do not love the food at Applebee's. That being said this place is only A five minute walk from the Fairfield  and it is the only option that is within walking distance.. Don't let the sucky reviews stop you from going here if you're hungry. You can enjoy fine dining when you return home to your local establishments."
Christina F.,"Boise, ID",172,136,38,1.0,1/31/2015,Close to my hotel when I come here every trip has been a reminder why I chains are shit and this one especially...the manager is a complete tool talking shit about employees at the bar loud so its not a secret his knuckles drag on the ground as he grossly attempts to flirt w the customers place is a jerry Springer mixed w walmart
Alisha L.,"Marietta, SC",14,64,27,5.0,2/5/2015,I'm normally not a big applebees fan but this one is an exception. Service has always been great and food was exactly how it looked on the menu. My husband and I go here a lot for happy hour specials. The appetizers are great and the drinks are strong!
Sunny S.,"Nampa, ID",0,9,,1.0,9/1/2016,"Ordered carry out, everything was disgusting. Cold, the shrimp was way over cooked and the noodles weren't cooked. We literally threw it It in the trash. No effort what so ever. Major fail"
David M.,"SPOKANE VLY, WA",1,37,3,2.0,12/3/2014,You lmow I went to this place only because it was close to my hotel. Unfortunately food was only marginal kind of what I expected. The service is great though.  That's all I can say.
Dexter M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",5,19,47,5.0,6/22/2015,"Second time here in the last couple of days. Today, they were able to squeeze our 19 girls and 7 parents into an already crowded restaurant. We just finished our first game of the 2015 USYSA Soccer regionals and staying at the Fairfield Inn down the road. These guys are accommodating and they try to cater to all the teams out of town. Tony, our server, has been AWESOME! If you're staying at nearby hotels, ask for the hotel discount. Thanks Tony and staff for they great service and food!  We will definitely return this week to feed our team!"
Shirley B.,"Corbett, OR",0,1,,1.0,7/12/2016,I ordered the top sirloin to go and while I was waiting for an itemized receipt-  I decided to open it and eat before it got cold (he took my tip and I never saw him again).  I could not cut into it!  People started laughing around me so I had to return it and I got chicken instead.  After paying $35 (ordered a beer while I waited and foolishly tipped 20%) I walked away with a plain piece of chicken and will never step foot in another Applebee's again.
Bernie R.,"Glendale, AZ",2,33,13,4.0,10/24/2015,"Minutes from the airport, I always stop here for lunch before my 1:34 flights. Their lunch specials are reasonably priced, but they are small. Perfect size for me but it may not fill up someone with a big appetite. Fast service. This is my usual place for lunch, as I travel a lot. I would have given 5 stars but the restaurant is always cold."
Dyellie J.,"University Place, WA",1,7,6,1.0,6/28/2015,Absolute worst service I've ever had at an Applebee's Glad I don't frequent Boise. Will not be back
Jon B.,"Boise, ID",4,56,22,4.0,4/4/2014,"Typical chain....only a great example of how great service tops all.  Tyler was the server.  Very attentive, with great suggestions for my family.  Great service Tyler! We had the typical 2 for meals cooked to order with great sides.   Thank you for the great service"
Kyle C.,"Kent, WA",22,97,116,1.0,1/24/2015,"Like every other time I've been to Applebee's, it wasn't by choice. It had been a while since I had been and this was the group pick of where to have lunch so there ya go. I tried to be optimistic because I hadn't been to Applebee's is while, so I thought things could be different. At first it was fine. The staff was pleasant and the environment was nice. They had lots of sports on TV and a little computer on the table in which you could order from. I got the triple bacon burger thinking that would be an easy lay up for any restaurant. Then I saw my food come out... I don't know what I was imagining would find its way to my table, but what I got was like something from a drive thru. It was on the smaller side and all disheveled from itself. I know making the diner assemble their own burger is normal now, so I'll let that slide. The fry sauce I got was served in either a small shot glass or a large thimble, don't know which. Basically, it's a portion problem. Maybe I'm a fat assed American, or maybe I'm just a normal American who already worked eight hours that day? The taste is just okay. Every dish was just okay.  I don't want you to think I hate you Applebee's. I don't. You just don't do it for me. I don't have an answer for your problems either. It's just you. And it's just okay. Unless you make a radical change in your doctrine as a restaurant, I don't know when if ever we will meet again."
Jessica J.,"Washington, DC",39,18,,4.0,3/8/2016,Loved the table trivia games for just $1.  The food was good too.  I'd be back if I'm ever in the area again.
Brad S.,"Boise, ID",0,7,,4.0,3/27/2016,"It's hard not to shake your head while reading through some of the reviews for this location.  One of the most unfortunate things about Yelp is the screening (or lack thereof) process.  People come with unrealistic expectation and then write an emotionally driven post about it.  Please understand what you are walking into.  Applebee's is what it is.  They don't advertise as a 5 star steak house experience nor do they advertise the best burger in the world.  For what they do advertise, this location is on point.  I'm back and forth from the airport frequently and this is a good stop.  You will get good service and your food will be the correct portion as laid out by the company spec.  There is one post in particular that the girl gives ""1 star"" because her procrastinating boyfriend had an expired ID and was trying to order booze and the server denied it.  Guess what, that server did EXACTLY what he/she should have.  It is illegal in ID to have an expired ID, let alone be served alcohol with one!!!  Yeah, sure lady, this server is going to risk their job, possible jail time, possible loss of license to the business (which would put them out of business) because your BF can't get his license renewed in a timely fashion.   It's people like this that are everything that's wrong with YELP.  So, if you are looking for a decent meal that isn't gonna break the bank and you are choosing Applebee's, be realistic in your expectation.  I have been here 6 or 7 times the last few years and it always serves the purpose.  If you are business and traveling solo, sit at the bar if Austin is working.  He's sharp, professional and will chat sports with you any day.  Oh ya, and for a big chain, they do a good job of serving a rotation of local beers!"
Baby G.,"Littleton, CO",35,7,14,1.0,7/16/2014,Poor service....me and my boyfriend stay a night at hotel next to applebees....im order black russian and my boyfriend order bluemoon....but when she's check our ID...she said she can't sale drink to my boyfriend....coz his ID expired...this is 1st time check expired date not DOB. When we want to order chicken wings...she just told us...its not happy hour....I love applebees....but for this...im very unhappy. After shes delivery our food...she's never come back to check our table....if need something else. We never have this problem....
Jonathan C.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",106,152,41,1.0,11/2/2014,Ok well the service is exceptionally slow. The bar tender lacks any professionalism. When my waitress asked him for me if they have new castle his response was don't ask me if we have crappy beer. Maybe his beer knowledge is limited to just Applebee's or maybe he is one of those craft beer snobs. The food is mediocre and the service is worse. I say go any where else even the damn grocery store before coming to this place. At least the service will be better.
Buzz M.,"Billings, MT",86,425,113,4.0,2/1/2013,"I don't know why the bad rap from the other reviews.  It's a standard Applebee's except busier than most I've been to probably due to all the nearby hotels. Best to go early or late.  From 6-8pm they're swamped most nights of the week. I sit at the bar, which is usually very busy, and the bartender/server gal does a fantastic job.  She's a real go-getter who stays on top of all her bar customers as well as pouring drinks for all the other servers. My meal?  Very very good.  Bourbon Street Steak, medium rare and cooked to perfection.  Mushrooms and onions on the side with fried potatoes.  It's very good, fairly cheap ($14) and comes out piping hot on a sizzling platter ala fajitas. Yay!  I'm a fan.  =]"
Michelle L.,"Riverside, WA",0,3,13,1.0,3/25/2014,Nice to have a low cal option  however the price was too much for the small portions.The chicken dish w mushrooms was almost too salty to eat. I won't try this again.
Kelly B.,"Wenatchee, WA",0,3,,2.0,9/5/2015,"First server was great. We paid our tab with her as she was going home. Second server was busy... But not TOO busy. Spent all her time talking to everyone else. We asked the bartender to help us, he looked around like ""uuuhhh what?"" We had the ""call server"" light flashing for ten minutes with other servers helping everyone around us. I hope the manager teaches them to work as a team. I'm a server, terrible service. Sorry. Serving people is a team effort.  Did I mention my husband had to go to the bar to get the drinks we had ordered ten minutes prior? They were sitting there THAT long.  Why could no one else run them out to us? Terrible."
