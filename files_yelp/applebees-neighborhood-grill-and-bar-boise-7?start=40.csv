T B.,"Newcastle, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/1/2013,"I was in Boise on a business trip this week two of my associates and I decided to walk over, from our hotel, and have a few drinks... First off the waitress took forever, she kept apologizing for the delay stating that they were so busy, and we understood that because there was a few people there, but the fact of the matter was not to many to serve us.. So the drinks finally came and we were having a good time, we decided to take one shot each, thats it one....one more beer and then one more beer, the waitress comes up and says that her shift was ending so maybe we could close out with her and another would take care of us, I had no problem with this but when the ""other"" waitress never came we started to wonder... had they forgotten about us? were they ignoring us, we are from Calirornia, or what was going on??? Then the manager comes over and says "" my staff and I have come to a conclusion that we are not going to serve you anymore"" ???? What??? Why??? we had done nothing wrong or for the slightest bit been out of line, but I have an idea as to why....I am a white man the woman i was next to is an african american and there was a table next to us,all white men, who by the way were having shot after shot and I counted five each in the same time frame with beers, is Idaho so backed up with the times that they cannot see, that other people deserve the same respect?  I was and am very disapointed with their actions and would not recommed this establishment to anyone who is not from there, apparently they are not with the times"
Marjoe D.,"San Antonio, TX",4,7,2,4.0,9/12/2013,"We went last night and had dinner here and I liked it.  The service was good, the staff was extremely friendly.  They even noticed my husband was watching a basketball game on his phone and one of the waiters told him that if there was something he would like to watch they could switch to that channel so he could watch it on the tv that on the wall in front of our booth (that was really nice!).  The food was delicious and because yesterday was Wednesday we only paid 99 cents for our son's entrée (a super deal they have on Wednesdays). The only reason why I'm only giving 4 stars is because our waitress forgot to refill our drinks."
Jim K.,"Novato, CA",7,45,,2.0,7/20/2014,"Bad service here. I don't usually eat at chains like this but I was staying at a nearby hotel, so I ate here out of convenience.  I sat at a bar table and the server came by and wiped it with a wet towel. The only problem was she left it soaking wet! Of course there were no napkins on my table so I had to grab some from another table to wipe it dry myself. I ordered a Blue Moon draft with a lemon. It came back with a lime. I then ordered a steak and baked potato. She asked if I wanted the potato loaded, to which I said yes. I had no idea this was a $2 upsell; I only noticed it on the bill. It came out looking like I would expect without the extra charge. The beers here were a pricey $5. $25 and change for average food and poor service. Too much. The next night I ate across the street at the bar in another hotel (I think it was called the Sports Page) and the food and service were much better. The beers were only $2."
Mike A.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,43,9,1.0,7/24/2012,"Food is gross, Service is worse. Ordered Carside To Go, specifically asking for no mushrooms in my meal. Get back to my hotel, and it's littered with mushrooms. I call them and let them know that I'm allergic and the dish needs to be remade.  Manager is nice enough to comp my meal, which is really the least they can do after wasting a half hour of my time driving back this late at night. The food is obviously reheated, as the spinach has completely wilted and the chicken is covered in condensation. The first to-go container was room temp, and this one is super hot. I call back to make sure they didnt just reheat a dish I was allergic to, and they assure me it's fresh. It is actually worse if this is a freshly made dish, considering how unappetizing it is. So I dig in, and it's gross. I'm starving, but this is borderline inedible. And all it took was an hour of drivetime and waiting. Applebees isn't that great to begin with, but this one is particularly bad. Oh yeah, and my hot dessert was given to me cold. I'm in a hotel and don't have a microwave."
Amy B.,"McCall, ID",3,21,,2.0,3/23/2012,Food is what is expected for Applebees. Do not expect to get in & out in an hour. Salad and soup does cost extra as a side. Not sure if that is Applebees norm or not.
Robert G.,"Sherwood, OR",0,10,,1.0,4/10/2011,"Some colleagues and I decided to check out the new $6.99 Soup, Salad and Bread lunch menu that Applebee's is promoting.  We visited on Friday at 12:30.  Arrived to a less than busy place.  Maybe about 25% full. The three of us were seated promptly.  The waitress was on the spot taking drink orders while we looked over the menu.  We already knew what we were going to order but perused the soup and salad choices. When we ordered, the waitress informed us that for $6.99 we got only one pick of soup and one of salad but could get refills of the same.  For $2 more, we could get our pick of any soup/salad for each refill.  A little bit of up selling there and not quite what we expected. Well, it went downhill from there.  First it took over 20 minutes to get the first course out to the table.  We were well halfway into our lunch hour by then! When she brought the food out she asked if we wanted to reorder then and there.  Since we hadn't tasted anything, we declined.  That was a big mistake.  The soup was a tiny cup of soup with no more than 2/3 cup of soup in the serving.  The salads consisted of about 1 cup of salad.  All arranged on a 11 inch basket so it looked like more food.  The spinach salad was swimming in dressing -- literally.  The 3 shrimp in that salad looked awfully lonely.  My chicken salad had more chicken than greens and again, swimming in dressing.   My colleague's French onion soup was bland and watery.   It took us all of 2.5 minutes to finish the small portions that were served.  It took the waitress about 8 minutes to come back by.  We reordered with gusto.  The second round took over 12 minutes to get to the table.  Really, it takes that long to dish up 3 soups and salads?  And after that the soup was lukewarm! Well, because of the delays, we were running out of time and had to leave after round 2.  Another server mentioned that they were having trouble with their broiler. I would not recommend this particular special feature.  Applebee's needs to learn a few things about speedy soup/salad lunches from Olive Garden.  In addition, they need to rethink the quality of the food and the portion sizes being served for a all you can eat feature."
