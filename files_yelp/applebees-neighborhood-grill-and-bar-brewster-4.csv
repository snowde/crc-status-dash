Matt F.,"Yonkers, NY",45,401,540,3.0,11/20/2017,"Eh, it's Applebee's - which is about a slight notch higher than a standard diner.......sometimes. The only reason this location gets the third star is because the meal generally was ok - except the meat, which wasn't cooked the way I wanted, but still fine.  The menu is standard for all locations and this was no exception. The ""2 for $20/2 for $25"" choices are blah. I kind of think they should have a better selection for those ""deals"".  The waitress was friendly and attentive. The place was clean and spacious enough. Memo to Applebees - you should only put lemons in drinks when people actually request them. Not everyone likes lemon in their sodas or water. Just an FYI.  They have these little doohickeys at the tables where you can pay your bill, swipe your card, order etc. Not a bad innovation. It's my first time seeing that anywhere, though it could be just the area.  They share the land and parking lot with other businesses, but you should be able to find a spot.   So it's an Applebees. If you know the company, you should know what you're getting. So if you don't want to go to the diner, then this is a somewhat equal alternative."
Liz B.,"Carmel, NY",25,12,,1.0,1/10/2018,"Absolutely the worse service. Every place is hit or miss. I always give 2nd, 3rd, chances but it has been a 'miss' the last three times. The waitress was incompetent. She started off by complaints about her job. No hello, how are you nothing. I should have left then. The food was horrible. The appetizers portions are pathetic. The wing portion has always stayed the same but the pretzel and mozzarella sticks were pathetic!! The worse is the charge finally posted to my cc and $1 more was added to the tip. It might only be a $1 but I painfully gave her a %15 tip after the terrible service and I'm angry. We want to support our local restaurants but can no longer support this one. I will will not be returning."
Rob B.,"Carmel, NY",0,6,1,2.0,10/19/2017,"Went to Applebee's on 10/14. They were running their dollarita special. We ordered our first round and some appetizers. We had a couple other rounds after that, each worst than the next. They literally gave us margarita mix, water over ice. There was no tequila added, period. I couldn't believe it, I was paying to drink straight margarita mix. The boneless wings were good with ranch, mozzarella sticks were cold and only okay. 2 stars solely for the boneless wings. I would avoid this location, much better options for almost anything. Get the 2 for 20 new whiskey BBQ burger, with the boneless wings if you do go."
Devorah M.,"Manhattan, NY",63,24,1,1.0,2/27/2017,"Sadly, the food is tasteless and mediocre.  The service is terrible.  I've tried it too many times each time hoping that it would be better. No such luck.  I don't think the restaurant really cares. It's too bad...I really want to support the local restaurants. Disappointed :-("
Carlos V.,"North Salem, NY",17,5,,1.0,5/1/2017,"Went to have dinner with my wife on a Monday evening. Not sure, but the ""B"" crew must have been working. My wife ordered grilled shrimp and steak; steak was good, but shrimp came out uncooked/raw. After bring it up the the waitress, she stated that the manager (who didn't show his/her face) also said it was raw. After coming back with the same shrimp, now slightly grilled, asked ""is that good enough?"" Don't you think the idiot grilling the shrimp should know how to grill shrimp? What did she want my wife to go in the kitchen and cook it herself? Needless to say, my wife didn't eat the shrimp. As for my meal of fish and chips, fish was ok; fries were cold and old- inedible. Last time eating there for us."
Jon N.,"Brewster, NY",75,50,8,1.0,6/12/2016,"Very low quality food and poorly managed! Went in there a few weeks ago. Told the waitress my wife was allergic to onions, but she served her chicken with onions anyway. When we mentioned it, she took it back, removed the onions, and brought the same meal back. When we asked to speak to the manager, he was very indifferent to the situation. Most nights we've gone there, the manager is nowhere to be found. I think we're done with Applebee's!"
Rachel S.,"Carmel, NY",51,248,1,3.0,7/13/2016,"I did not come here for a while due to the quality of food not just the Carmel location but Applebee's everywhere.  Since they have upgraded their food menu quite a bit I have returned.  My favorite item on the menu is the Chicken Wonton appetizer and I have the with the agave margarita.  If you sit in the bar area, the drinks are 2 for 1."
Indira P.,"Danbury, CT",0,35,5,1.0,11/22/2016,"Sigh! This is my second review for this location, Sunday Nov. 20th my husband and I went for a late lunch since we were in the area. We walked in and noticed it was not crowded at all given it was Sunday during Football season and it was snowing! We walked in and sat down at the high top bar tables and waited 10 mins before the waitress Terry in our section acknowledged us and asked if we needed menus. We gave us the menus and said someone would be with us soon, Another 10 mins go by before our waitress Michelle D (who had an entire section and at least 5 tables) was able to stop by and take our drink orders. I asked for a Fat Tire and Michelle D had no idea what that was (it's a craft beer currently on tap). She apologized for the delay and was very professional and gracious.  This is what really bothered us, the entire time we sat at the high top the floor manager Kim was there saw us come in and sit there waiting and not once did she much as have someone help us or even let us know they may be shorthanded.  In my opinion, if you are a manager at this Applebee's location you don't care, you don't care about your employees, your job or most importantly your customers."
Nelson S.,"Carmel, NY",17,22,2,3.0,11/17/2016,Wow I have to say this place is really hit-or-miss sometimes it's good and sometimes it's just awful food is ok service is slow! The last time I was there we had a really great waitress it was late and she was one of two waitress there and she was very nice even though overworked!
Angela Y. Z.,"New Hyde Park, NY",32,6,287,2.0,9/19/2015,What we ordered did not look the same or close to what we saw from the menu. The waitress was slow and the fork was dirty. There was a dried mushroom/onion on it. Totally lost my appetite after seeing it :(
Ashley V.,"Fishkill, NY",0,1,,1.0,11/12/2016,"Ever think to yourself ""I could go for a one star restaurant experience right now"". If so, this Applebees is the place for you. You know I'm not one to post reviews, let alone negative ones but this place has inspired me so much I just couldn't help myself. I always try to be empathetic towards waiters and if I have an unpleasant experience I try to give them the benefit of the doubt. But there was no reason for my friends and I to wait over an hour for our meals. Our waitress had an attitude from the start and took a long time to even take our drink orders even though there were probably more waiters working than actual customers and therefore no reason to have to wait so long to take our orders and for us to get our food. Like I said I'm usually understanding and if service is slow I figure the kitchen could be backed up or something but I found that since there were barely any customers there in the first place, this couldn't be the reason. Not to mention our waitress didn't even come over during that entire hour we were waiting for our food to apologize for the long wait or to see how we were doing. After waiting what seemed like the entire length of the movie Titanic without seeing our waitress or our food I was getting hangry and cold. Oh, did I mention we were seated next to a door that even though it had a sign on it to keep it closed at all times, the workers decided to ignore and keep open so the nippy November air kept hitting us. I should've know there was a reason the entire staff was wearing north face jackets. So not only am I hungry at this point but I'm closer to getting frostbite than I am to getting my food. If Harambe was alive this probably wouldn't have happened. After being ignored and feeling like I just got into a fight with Elsa I tried my best to let it go. Our food arrived and when I went to ask for ketchup (what kind of restaurant doesn't put ketchup on a table) our waitress had disappeared . It wouldn't be for another half hour until we'd see her again... the food was pretty disappointing for all three of us. I should mention we have pretty low standards. I am not picky when it comes to restaurants or food but I was just so angry at this point which is pretty rare for me. I saw our waitress walk past our table several times but never once stop to ask if we need anything. I NEEDED KETCHUP. I even saw her standing around at one point doing nothing. None of the other workers asked how we were. I started to feel like we had Ebola or something. (We don't). We were going to order dessert but we're so displeased we just asked for our checks when she finally checked on us. This location really needs to get their shit together. Also why are you called Applebee's? Doesn't even make sense. This experience was probably more devastating than the election results. Mic drop."
Joseph J.,"Carmel, NY",0,3,,1.0,2/2/2017,This is the most unprofessional place a person could eat at in Brewster. There waiters lack professionalism and do not care about you the customer or frankly their job. The management has to be pathetic also because the food is horrible and slowly prepared. Plus I've learned people only perform at a low level if you don't push them for excellence. The waiters were having a great time with each other instead of tending to customers needs. Pathetic excuse for a restaurant. Save your money and go up to hill and eat at a legitimate restaurant...Ever Ready Diner.
Jack G.,"New Haven, CT",0,7,,1.0,4/9/2016,"DO NOT EAT HERE, maybe drinks and food at bar???? So, waitress walks over what you want to drink, need a minute, I ask what kind of wines do you have, she replies,  the typical ones, Cab, Char, Pinot???  Its in the menu, no prices ???  Need even more help We order after receiving drinks, order was lost of never placed, waitress no where to be found,  waitress comes by and tells me I need to find out where your meals are  duh? Then she did not return for some time. Finally arrived, I asked for a comp wine for delay.  She says I will ask mgr, then she never came back. I asked for water, she never gave me water and points to the device, you can pay here.  That was the last I saw her.  When leaving I tell the hostess that the service was poor and meal was luke warm at best,  she replies, Thank you come again!  What, never.  Do not go there, there are plenty of other  eateries near by, local businesses not this chain."
Bianca Z.,"New York, NY",5,11,1,1.0,1/18/2016,Wow not surprised at all by the terrible reviews already on this page. My family orders take out from here at least once every month and it just keeps getting worse and worse... Last night they completely omitted an item we ordered and everything else was cold and extremely small portioned. We called and they said we could get a free meal next time but who knows what that even means because we spent almost $70 on barely any good last night. Very disappointed. Brewster needs a larger variety of takeout options because Applebee's just isn't cutting it anymore.
Blass B.,"Brewster, NY",19,47,4,1.0,7/26/2015,"If it were possible to give zero stars, I'd give it now. This filthy pathetic excuse for a chain restaurant goes down as a total nightmare. Time after time they have disappointed us in so many ways  (service, food quality)yet I had never given them a review but this was a long time coming. I went there and got take out the other day for lunch. Mind you, only a couple customers, a couple waitresses and a male manager (sitting and hanging out like a customer) were in the front of the restaurant at the time. I ordered Pub Pretzels with the beer cheese and an Oriental chicken salad. I paid and drove home and when I unpacked my meal, it was immediately obvious that they had some wise-ass working in the kitchen. The Pub Pretzels had a big cup of mustard and a small cup with less than a teaspoon of beer cheese (which is mostly why you order them), and the pretzels were hard because they had been microwaved to partial dehydration. I was starving and decided to opened the salad after deciding to nix the pretzels. I thought the dressing looked off so I decided to taste it prior to putting it on the salad added the dressing. This makes me furious because it immediately burned my mouth and throat and tasted rancid. I called Applebees and eventually got the manager on the phone, who listened to my complains. He said he just got there and apologized (see above, he was there the whole time) and offered a $10 gift cards of my next visit. My husband put everything back in the bag and took it back to Applebees for a full refund. The manager offered some flimsy excuses and tried to apologize but it seemed like this kind of thing just happens so often they are no longer embarrassed or surprised. Went to Eveready Diner instead.  Would recommend you go anywhere but this Applebees. Anywhere but there."
Scott M.,"Carmel, NY",0,16,4,2.0,7/22/2016,Went for early dinner with wife & teenage son.We ordered from two for $25 menu some seafood something & ribs for my son(most were over cooked )in which we asked if Mac n cheese & sweet potato fried come with it & server said yes.There was a extra charge for them it was called substitution charge $2 ..I ordered beef Stirfry tasty but small portion.Then I caught on the check was $1.99 video game charge.I Left there still hungry & had a bowl of cereal when I got home..oh there are annoying flies always at the windows
Rick J.,"Poughquag, NY",0,9,,1.0,5/21/2016,The waiter tried to tell us it wasn't happy hour. We both read the sign saying it was happy hour Monday through Friday 3-6. I Was charged 7 dollars for one beer I had traveled a half an hour to get the drink specials for happy hour. The waiter had the audacity to tell us otherwise. The waiter was also unable to answer the simplest question related to the menu. I could read the stupid on this grown mans face. I will going to chills and only chills again . I will never go to Apples Bees again anywhere in the unites states again.
Ken S.,"Pleasant Valley, NY",0,10,,3.0,8/17/2015,"The food was nice, the hostess was prompt however make sure your waiter doesn't have to clock out in 40 minutes after getting seated. He was very distracting because he wanted us to pay the taab so he could go home."
Veronica L.,"Carmel, NY",5,40,,3.0,4/7/2015,"We just went back here for dinner for a fundraiser type event for my employer and I was pleasantly surprised. As we were seated my 2 year old didn't want to sit in  the highchair and started to cry. The hostess didn't miss a beat and came over with a toy to distract him which worked wonders. The waitress was warm and kind. The food was hot, well prepared, and came out in a timely manner. My husband and I ordered burgers (to be on the safe side) and they were very good."
Nicole D.,"Carmel, NY",0,53,,1.0,7/20/2015,"What happened to Applebee's food?! Stopped in for lunch after a doctor's appointment down the road...I REALLY wish we went to Everready instead.  ALL of the food was GROSS, tasted like it was microwaved time and again."
Al T.,"Bristol, CT",0,3,,1.0,10/31/2014,"My grandson picked this place for his birthday lunch. We got  there together with his parents at about 2:30 AM on Saturday, October 25th. After we were seated, no waitress showed up for over 10 minutes at our table and we were unable to make even eye contact with any waitress, so I got up, went to the hostess area and told whoever was there about this problem. A waitress did show up shortly thereafter, apologized and said that they ""forgot"" that we had been seated at that table. After we ate the meal, she asked if we wanted a dessert menu, and we said yes. She came back about 5 minutes later without a menu and we said we wanted to pay, which we did. I have to say, that I barely can remember another restaurant where I experienced this kind of unprofessional and inattentive service! it appeared as if there was no supervisor/manager present to coordinate and oversee the restaurant. And the restaurant was even only moderately busy at that time!  All of us were disappointed/upset and discussed alternative restaurants in the area for future restaurant visits. We also discussed how to go about tipping, even considering not to tip at all, but settled on 10% ."
Tom H.,"Patterson, NY",5,18,,3.0,2/3/2013,"Same as every other Applebee's. Best bet is a cold draft beer. Good place for budget eats. Get there on Tuesday nights after 8pm for trivia night. Had fun and stuck around for most of the game. Needed to ask for refill on coffee.      Service is better than most Applebee's, noise level is moderate. Place is kept clean."
Murphey D.,"Goleta, CA",0,137,4,2.0,10/7/2015,"The food is OK, the service on the other hand is lackluster. I came here the other day and our waitress greeted us however we were not ready to order our food so we just got drinks......twenty minutes later she comes back with our drinks and ready to take our order. We ordered an appetizer and a entrée for each of us (3). After about a half hour of waiting and waiting , no waitress in sight, she finally brings out our appetizer along with our meal. Seriously, who does anymore? You could already guess the appetizer was cold, go somewhere else they don't know what they're doing here."
Stephanie F.,"Brewster, NY",28,7,,1.0,12/28/2015,"This place has been going down hill for awhile!! Went tonight the waitress I don't think knows how to smile or has no clue what she is talking about. How can medium well be different in each reasturant? FYI Applebee's medium well is burnt!! Then what my son ordered did not have mushrooms on it but... We found black burnt mushrooms. What if he was allergic?? They did take his meal off my bill but I will never go back,I will just drive a few minutes more to Red Robins. Also I wish I didn't have to give any stars!!!!!"
Bernadette M.,"Carmel, NY",0,3,,1.0,5/11/2014,"In this day and age where vegetarians/vegans are quite common is it expecting too much to find some meatless offerings?  I would have been happy with a veggie burger but when I inquired as to whether this was available I was told that they did have them at one time but not any longer.  How hard is it to have this item in the freezer for their vegetarian patrons?   Food is mediocre and I'd put it in the category of ""fake food.""  The two appetizers we ordered tasted like they were nuked or came out of a can and appeared to be highly processed.  In all fairness, the salad we ordered (without chicken) was quite good and fresh.  I learned my lesson and have crossed Applebees off my places to dine list.   The server was very polite and accommodating and the service was fine so the one star is for him.  Otherwise it was a complete bust."
Juan O.,"Carmel, NY",0,110,,4.0,8/8/2013,"Good service when we have eaten in.  No issues with cost, food or service.  We do lots of curb side also.  The 2 for $20 deals are great, although they have scaled back the menu.  Clean and nice environment.  Take out is quick and reliable.  Food is plentiful even with curb side.  Recommend to all either for dinning in or curb side to go."
Liz E.,"Bronx, NY",19,30,26,5.0,8/4/2013,Ok. I have been to many MANY applebees and this one is the best!!! Awesome staff A+ thanks !! Great job management!!
James W.,"Weymouth, MA",1,20,,1.0,5/17/2013,"Finally, I know what it's like to be invisible.  My wife and I were seated promptly and were told Kristen would be our server.  We eventually got to see Kristen who appeared after almost ten minutes.  Communication?  Not sure.  She took our drink order, never asked about an appetizer,  so Applebees never got that order.  She brought our drinks and walked away, again not asking about an appetizer (yes, we wanted one).  She eventually returned and took our dinner order.  My wife liked her ribs, but I really didn't like the Lemon Shrimp Fettuccine (not her fault, I just didn't care for it).  When Kristen next  appeared we requested the dessert menu and she was kind enough to bring one.  After a couple of minutes, and the menu sitting on the end of the table, she must have taken the menu on the end of the table as a signal to clean the table next to ours instead of taking our order, so she didn't get that one either.  All in all, not a great experience.  We were just passing through, but locals who go there, be forewarned, the service is slow.  Of 3 sales opportunities, this employee missed 2.  Applebees, how much business can you afford to lose before you train waitstaff to do a better job?"
