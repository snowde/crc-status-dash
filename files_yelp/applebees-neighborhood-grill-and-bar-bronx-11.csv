Don L.,"Franklin, MA",28,140,97,3.0,11/1/2017,"This is a good sized Applebees.  Located right outside the gates of Fordham University.  The menu is standard Applebees.  The prices are are a pretty good deal. The food is OK and predictable.  We had several varieties of burgers.  it is interesting that they don't ask how you like them, and they come out fairly well done.  We did like the fries. Our server was efficient.  They have the touch screens to play pay with, which I personally hate, but obviously some people like it. There is a lot of dining options in the area, I would not put this near the top of the list. It is OK, just not particularly special."
Jacqueim M.,"Bedford-Stuyvesant, NY",198,2,3,5.0,1/4/2018,Love the $1 LIT they actually taste good now! Food was great. Applebee's is really coming around and making great changes for the better. They even have Sunday brunch in some locations. Drinks are finally stronger and staff is usually very nice. I would def recommend the location upstate close to Peekskill and the one on Times Square 42nd st
Jerrius J.,"Bronx, North Hempstead, NY",142,93,122,3.0,10/29/2017,"Went on a Monday night during a Yankee game. The place was fairly busy and although i was only one person, probably took me about 10 minutes to get seated.  The burgers/fries are only 8.99$ on Monday nights and draft beer like Stella is only 5$ so it was a good deal. I got the quesadilla burger and I think I regret it. It was a fine burger: the salsa tasted fresh but if I am going to go out of my way to eat red meat, this would not my choice. The fries were fine but literally my favorite thing about Applebees is that if you ask for a side of BBQ, they bring you hot (like temperature wise) BBQ and in my humble opinion, everything tastes 2X as good with hot BBQ.   I will go back and get a different burger probably but satisfied for sure."
Lisa M.,"Manhattan, NY",12,4,14,1.0,12/14/2017,If I could give negative stars I would give it. As many time I have come to this location I can say this is the WORST!!!!! Poor me waitress didn't know the menu after recommending a dish. Then every beer had to be returned cause of a hot tap SMH and after all the returns of dishes and drinks NOT ONE of the 2 mangers came to see what the problem was or try to make us feel better about the continuous fuck ups SMH I don't think I will return to this location.
Daybel V.,"West Bronx, NY",120,14,2,1.0,9/21/2017,I came here with my husband to grab lunch on 9/21 @ 2:00 pm. We went to the bar because we had an appointment around the corner. It's not even the bartenders fault. She was working alone. The bar was completely filled. She had to go and get the to go orders herself. The bar area was filled with about 26 dirty cups. Garbage on the floor. Boxes of product on the counter. There were ppl waiting to pay for their orders. She had to also grab her own food. Where's the management making sure they are providing Great customer service ? That's how employees get overwhelmed and begin hating their jobs.
Jari R.,"West Bronx, NY",18,3,2,1.0,11/16/2017,"This is hands down, The worst Applebees ever created. This place only produces the worst workers. Everyone sucks at their job."
Samantha B.,"Morrisania, NY",0,10,3,4.0,9/11/2017,Was here yesterday 9/10/17 a Sunday evening for dinner and the service was great. My server name was Brian and he was really nice and helpful. I took my parents and it was awesome. Food came out quickly and everything was great thanks Brian we enjoyed it.
Nani S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",46,6,9,2.0,3/11/2017,"Decided to come here late at night for a quick bite with my boyfriend. I wasn't really that hungry so we order from the 2 for 27 menu. When the waiter arrived with our food the fries given to my boyfriend were old and cold. I ordered red potatoes as my side and was given mash potatoes, after telling the waiter he said he'd bring out both. After two minutes he returns from the kitchen with darkened potatoes that appeared to be sitting out for at least two hours. I never received a credit for the item and honestly I didn't want it because I didn't want to go back ! If you're going to go to this location, don't go a hour before closing! I'm pretty sure they do this to any and everyone."
Andrew W.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",304,33,43,1.0,6/23/2017,"This is one of those chains you can rely on to have the same standard wherever you go. Awful food, their steaks are like the soles of my shoes without the holes. Timing impeccable, if you want to wait 2 hours for a steak. Their margaritas alcohol free.  I miss them already, and plan to keep it that way."
Drew K.,"Bronx, NY",0,10,10,1.0,12/8/2017,"This Applebee's COMPLETELY SUCKS...we went here tonight and it took 10 minutes for our starting drinks to come out. Drinks were all ice and weak. Entrees look NOTHING like advertised on menu. Had spinach dip appetizer and sauce was some microwaved crap. Just no love or care put into preparing food. Our server, Amanda was nice, but manager was an ass...gave us a lot of lip service for the tiny, unsatisfactory second round of drinks, and instead of just giving them to us on house, he took them. Hope he didn't give them to someone else bcuz I sipped on it and have a cold. And if he poured them out, then that just goes to show the extra mile he'd be willing to go to make customers happy. This place is just terrible on so many levels....this is just a few. Outside the restaurant heard other patrons with exact same complaints....I will NEVER EVER go to this location again....in fact, I won't bother with any Applebee's period. Quality of food is just not good and for a few extra dollars, can get better quality, better prepared food somewhere else. I'd suggest people reexamine their palette if you think this quality eating (no offense to those reading this, but I'm being serious). CRAPPLEBEE'S!!"
Velma C.,"Bronx, NY",16,24,18,1.0,10/8/2016,"So far 12 servers, just lollygagging around. Our server didn't bother to help with the menu options and she seemed bothered that I said we would need more time. We picked the wrong specials, which was fine cuz she advised us. But no help on the fact that what we were looking for was on the menu elsewhere, and not restricted to the specials menu.  Servers are sitting at the bar, hanging out and hugging each other while gossiping. Not professional at all, but what can you expect from this generation?"
Caroline H.,"Manhattan, NY",173,139,108,1.0,6/22/2016,"I recently had a negative experience at this location.  I've visited a few times now and had a couple of general complaints - service has always been a little slow, and everything from the table to the menus is a little sticky.   My friend and I recently came for lunch.  The restaurant was about half full, but wasn't particularly busy.  I ordered from the pick-two lunch menu and she ordered the American Standard Burger (which is supposed to be cooked in pickles, onions, and bacon).  My friend also ordered a drink - which came with a hair in it.   It took nearly an hour for our food to be delivered.  When it arrived, my order was lukewarm.   My friend described her burger as ""a beef patty with stale bread."" When she'd ordered this at other locations, little pieces of pickles, onions, and bacon were in the burger - and nothing was in this one.   We had to flag down 3 different servers before our waitress came over (which took about 20 minutes).  This is probably the longest I've had to wait at a restaurant.  When we explained the issue, the waitress argued with us for a bit.  My friend hoped to get the actual burger she ordered, but service had taken so long that we didn't have time.  Ultimately the waitress took the burger off of the bill, but only after much discussion.  Overall, our lunch took about an hour an 20 minutes - a ridiculous amount of time, especially when the place wasn't that busy.  Service was not attentive and borderline rude.  Applebees has some good deals, but I would not recommend this location."
Paula M.,"Bronx, NY",195,310,172,1.0,5/3/2016,"I know, I know. I shouldn't have done it to myself. From the moment you walk in, these girls are like chickens without heads. I gave her my name and wait. Then after a while I noticed that 2 other people were called before me when they had come in after. I immediately go up to the girls there and give her my name and she tells me that she did call me several times. Ummm, no! Paula isn't a hard name to say or spell. I'm pretty sure I would have heard my name sitting 2 steps away. So we get seated and of course it takes the waitress a while to come. Then she takes the order and inputs it on those small machines on the desk. Literally over 20mins pass and no food. I ordered freaking appetizers. And no where was this waitress to be seen. Finally the food comes, the tortilla chips are saturated in oil, I tried to bite into one and it was like biting into rubber rubbed in oil, it was disgusting!!! I wait to see the waitress again, 5mins pass and nothing. I have my son go get a manager from the front. The host comes over and I tell her I need a manager, and explain about the food. She leaves. 10mins pass, no manager. The waitress shows her face, I tell her I do not want the food and want the check. She apologizes, cancels it on that machine and leaves again I SWEAR!!! I checked out and leave a $1 tip. Thanks for SHIT!!! This place is TRASH!!!"
Bella P.,"Queens, NY",114,10,,1.0,1/25/2017,"HORRIBLE FOOD OMG who hired these ""CHEFS"" even tho applebees food it come frozen ! the food was cold and it had a hair my boyfriend and I saw the lady take the hair out and put the plate on the microwave like SERIOUSLY !!!!!!!!!!!!! It was 20 minutes before closing ! if you wanted me to leave you should of told and it wouldnt spend my hard working $60. I will never be coming back !"
Enrique T.,"Mount Kisco, NY",0,15,1,1.0,6/28/2017,"Problably the lowest quality applebees ever we were not expecting a fine dining experience bud from that to waiting like a hour for a burger and a tilapia that taste like anything else bud not fish, rude service the waitress made us feel like she was doing us a big favor by taking care of us. Do your self a favor go to another place"
Jasmine B.,"Manhattan, NY",4,33,4,1.0,4/8/2017,"The worst Applebees I've ever been to! The place wasn't that busy yet the wait for food seemed to be extremely long. I had a child wait an hr for some chicken tenders and fries... why??? Then it took an hr and a half for some ice cream. The waitress claimed she's trying to get the cooks to hurry up but they were ""taking their time"". I just found it strange when she told us she was telling them to hurry up because the entire night she was talking to her coworkers. Ended up paying $84 for shitty service. Yeah. . . Won't be coming back here."
Frances H.,"Belmont, Bronx, NY",0,2,,1.0,8/28/2016,"Terrible service(slow, moody bartenders) Nasty(flies all around the bar area)  Drinks(weak!)"
Stephanie D.,"Bronx, NY",19,30,14,1.0,9/20/2015,"I used to come here a lot when it opened, and I really liked it. I came about two weeks ago, and I was shocked at how much had changed food wise. I will start off by saying that my waiter Manuel was the nicest guy ever and so attentive, if there was anything memorable about going, it was definitely what a great job he did. As for the food, me and my sister did the 2 for $26. As an app we got the boneless chicken wings that tasted old and warm. I got the mash and steak, and I was mortified at how gross my potatoes looked. They were discolored and literally had the consistency of play-doh, I didn't touch it and just took half of my sisters bake potato. I should have probably told my server, but I'm one of those customers that don't like to nag or bother, so I left it alone. What put me over the edge, was when I ordered a refill of my Pepsi, and midway through my drink, I noticed there was mushy paper in the middle, so gross!!!!! I wanted to gag. As nice as my waiter was, I'm never going back. They definitely need to get better cooks in the back, and manage the food that's coming out that kitchen, because it's inedible."
Tracey T.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,2,,2.0,8/27/2017,"Well... My girlfriend and I waited close to 30 mins without anyone even so much as offer a glass of water. Finally, we got a manager and he comped our first drink, took our order and made sure we received our food while it was still hot. Big shout out to Jose C! Carlos was a big help as well. However, Sylvia, and the other blonde with the red lips.... Smh. The worst.  5 stars for the manager and Carlos! Would I come back? Maybe..."
Eve B.,"Bronx, New York, NY",0,3,,1.0,4/6/2017,"I was very underwhelmed by this location.  The dish was terrible.  I ordered a lunch special of soup & sandwich and I disliked it.  The soup looked nothing like it should have.  Needless to say I reordered however, I was still dissatisfied.  The service was decent but the food was not @ all!!! I was able to get a discount from it but I would definitely not be returning!!!"
Elena P.,"Bronx, NY",1,24,,1.0,3/2/2017,"What a terrible experience. With the exception of our wonderful waitress, I think her name was Genesis this was a nightmare. First of all there was a 30 minute wait but I guess that's because of the happy hour special. But there was a second floor not being used at all. We ordered appetizers and then our main course. Our main course came first and the lady we bought it not our waitress btw was upset that we asked for our appetizer first. This whole time there was a crowd of about 6 people completely drunk out of their mind at the bar. Being disruptive and loud, to which the bartender kept the drinks coming. I'm almost certain there's a law about how much drinks you can give to someone who is so completely wasted. By the time I got my pasta again it was cold and salty thank god our waitress didn't charge it. Did I mention the cops had to be called. What a night and not in a good way!"
Draya-Renee J.,"Bronx, NY",179,34,60,5.0,12/22/2015,After working out across the way at 24 Hour Fitness I was famished. Made a beeline to Appebees for some eats while i waited for the next metro north train. I got the Asian bone in wings and a Bahama Mama (dont judge me...I'm all about a fitness/life balance yo). At the bar area it was happy hour unbeknownst to me so imagine my surprise when the bill came and the total was $12.68!! Prompt service.  The drinks was done within 5 mins and food came out within 10. The wings are the right combo or tangy and spicy. The drink? I can actually taste the rum!  2 thumbs up. This might become my after gym ritual.
Rodd R.,"West Bronx, NY",0,1,,2.0,3/23/2016,"Horrible customer service , extremely untrained service and ""hood servers/hostess"" The manager tries to help but not much can be done when the servers and hostess are are simply bringing the place down. Second star is just for the manager!"
Lucy M.,"Fordham Manor, NY",39,45,8,1.0,3/6/2016,"Worst Customer service. As soon as I walked in there was a huge line and many empty tables. I went up to the hostess tiara and asked her how long was the wait for it table for two she said 15 minutes. She asked for my name but I did it clearly hear her and ask her to repeat what she said, she gave me a really nasty attitude and repeated herself. I sat down for 35 min & still no table. This is the second time I go in and have been treated very poorly. I will never come again to this place"
Z A.,"Bronx, NY",0,35,,1.0,11/25/2016,"Food was good, but the waitresses and staff were seen eating non-Applebee's food, standing around, and their phones. Drinks were brought out after the food was. Waitress seemed condescending. I won't be back."
Stephany C.,"Bronx, NY",0,4,1,2.0,4/22/2016,"Ridiculous service. How are there multiple empty tables and we still had to wait to be seated. Then the host states ""sorry I forgot we had these seats."" Thankfully they invested in the table assistance machine to take our appetizers order, because waiting for a server would be waiting for ice to melt.  Did not know to get an order of lemon water takes more than 10 minutes and then they forget the lemon. Thankfully the food was good, with the exception of the chicken Quesadilla that took forever to come out.  I was able to place an order for dessert, pay for my bill and the sever still took forever to bring out a to go bag.  Overall this Applebee's needs to reset their workers to be more productive and efficient."
Ann W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,,1.0,10/23/2016,"It seems like service gets more horrible then the last. I went in to have some drinks at the bar, I was sitting there for 25 mins and no one bother to speak to me. No one bother to give me a menu, tell me to give them a sec to finish , they will be right with me nothing. Not even acknowledge me. 25 mins !!! I know it was busy I clearly can see one bartender busy making drinks but there was another lady behind the bar walking around doing little things. This isn't the first time this had happen to me. I came a couple of months ago and was sat at a table, and waited 30 mins for someone to come take my friend and my order. We would have been waiting more for a server if we didn't just grab someone who was just walking around. Fordham is a busy area, it seems they need a bit more staff. Very disappointed, I rather travel the distance and go to the one in 225."
Cameron G.,"Syosset, NY",142,40,11,1.0,2/26/2016,Food is what you expect from an Applebee's. I like the honey barbecue sauce on the wings and the mozzarella sticks but everything else is just okay. The portion sizes for the money aren't generous either. Service is slow no matter how crowded it is. I have had my order messed up several times here and on the simplest orders. It's really frustrating and I've told my friends I'm not going back.
oZ P.,"Bronx, NY",30,58,83,1.0,12/6/2014,"Never again, never again.  Stale, small portioned, weeks old food served to you straight out of an industrial sized GE microwave oven; complete with the misty taste of last week's busted hotdog.  The real life equivalent of ""Coming to America's"" fictional McDowell's restaurant."
Briana T.,"Bronx, NY",0,6,,2.0,11/7/2016,Everytime I come I leave full but dissatisfied with the food. It honestly tastes like its microwaved or boxed food just being heated up and thrown on a plate. The plates you sometimes get with your food on it looks dirty . The servers are young chicks who are sometimes rude. They're not genuinely nice it's just for tip. If applebees had more better customer service and real hand made food it will definitly be a better experience .
Victor S.,"Bronx, NY",265,69,7,1.0,1/11/2016,"Unfortunately my visit to this particular Applebee's sucked. YES I said sucked! I went here with my wife on Monday January 4th, 2015 during the day time and the place was practically empty - you would think that we are about to get exceptionally fast service..... NOT!!!  First things first the music that plays in the background was super loud - Headache Loud to be honest, who wants to hear super loud music while they eat in the middle of the day? Anyway we tried to put that to the side but after sitting there for 20 minutes without anyone acknowledging us my wife decided to bring it to the attention of the manager. It's not like the server did not see us sitting there  she only came to the table next to us 5 times and looked dead at us.... wtf is that? Once the manager reamed her out which was very obvious as he did it on the floor where everyone could see, she strolled over to tell us her name and that she would be serving us.... Like really we already know that bozo!!! At this point were 30 minutes into our visit, she finally takes our orders - we started with an order of mozzarella sticks for 2 followed by an order of riblets for my wife and a steak meal for myself.  DISAPPOINTED just isn't the word I would like to use at this point - we waited an addition 45 minutes for this food and it SUCKED as well. The riblets looked like a steak as they were 1 solid piece and her fries were overdone, my steak was bland and under cooked ( I asked for well done) my baked potato was hard like a rock and by the way - the mozzarella sticks had the flavor of frozen to them accompanied by a miserable tomato sauce. Dessert (chocolate Lava Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream) was about the only tasty thing we had but even that left a sour taste as we had to wait 25 more minutes just for that. - that's over1 1/2 hours to have a complete meal at a non crowded Applebee's. Felt  like no one really cared or wanted to work - even the greeter was horrible with her unwelcoming attitude. Do yourselves a favor and go to checkers across the street you may enjoy that better and for a lot less..... Never going back once is enough for us!!!"
Angel M.,"Bronx, NY",0,4,,4.0,10/25/2016,"I visited this resturant around a month ago and once before then. In both occasions the service was great and the food better. I went with a friend and the food was delievered fast and our server checked up on us at a good rate. I had the chicken shrimp pasta and when i return in the future i dont plan on ordering anything but.  The lipton rasberry green tea (unsweet) was great and refreshing. If i didnt already state it, the food was amazing. If your looking to eat great food for a great price, i suggest this resturant."
Elizabeth R.,"Mount Hope, Bronx, NY",4,6,21,4.0,3/22/2016,Pretty awesome neighborhood spot i dont come to eat i come to enjoy drinks withbmy girls been coming here for 6+ years
Terrel I.,"Bronx, NY",1,11,24,5.0,10/6/2015,"Love coming here after work for drinks.Pleasant vibe and good food.You can't beat a 4-12 happy hour with 1/2 off  apps,$3 beers,and $6 large sized Long Island ice t's!Charmaine and Lanaya are so kind,professional and they make great drinks!I'll be back for sure"
Lourdes S.,"Bronx, NY",3,27,,4.0,7/30/2016,"Drinks were delivered very quickly.  Food was very good...delivery was a little slow. My server, Elizabeth, was very accommodating and courteous."
Gen G.,"Albany, NY",0,3,,1.0,2/28/2017,"Reason why I have this restaurant 1 star, for the simple reason you are obligated to rate in order to write a comment. So as I'm number 8 on a waiting list, a couple walks in and bribes the girl working upfront with a $20 so he can skip the line and the worker went right along with it. Her name is Xiomara, Spanish looking girl with long black hair."
Yadira D.,"Bronx, NY",0,2,,1.0,11/18/2015,"Horrible service waitress forgot our drinks  Appetizers were cold,our food was cold  We got the table in front of ours drinks  Try eating cold spinache dip yuck gross  Definitely not going back nor recommending anyone Definitely thumbs down from us."
Michele R.,"Bronx, NY",17,72,166,1.0,9/21/2015,Horrible service & wait time.  The evening manager is rude and spends most of his time surrounding himself around the young female staff.  The promotions are not displayed so make sure you ask about them before you order. The drinks are very watered down and take long to be delivered to your table.  They run out of certain appetizers during the peak time and wait to tell you after they bring you your other items.  Waiters do not come directly to you at times unless you stand up and grab their attention.  It is in a great location so its sad that service sucks and food is not that great.  Like others noted sometimes the food taste like it was warmed up in the microwave. Its an okay spot if you only want to grab a snack and a beverage and chat with a good friend.
Amanda A.,"Bronx, NY",0,19,36,1.0,2/20/2016,"If I could give this experience 0 stars I would. We took my sister out to celebrate her getting her bartending license. And we regret coming here. First all we waited 25 for our drinks and WATER and for waitress take our order. The waiters did not know the table numbers and kept getting food confused. My mom ordered a sandwich with fries and specifically told them NO SALT AND PEPPER! Of course it comes with both! My mom got her entree first while my husband and I waited 20 more minutes for ours. I could have sworn all food comes together? Finally when i get my food, its the WRONG type of pasta! I had that dish many times I know what its supposed to look like. My sister ordered a drink and it was horrible. The other waitress gave us an attitude about ordering drinks.  To put the cherry on top: we were there for 1 hr and 30 mins waiting for everything while a table right behind us got all of their food and drinks and checks in 30 mins.  Speaking of the checks, we waited another 20 minutes to get our check to the point we could have walked out cuz no one checked on us. Our waitress was NEVER around! So my mom went downstairs (we were seated upstairs) and told someone about our check. The other waiters were like ""you could've paid with the little computer on the table"" again NO ONE told us about it! NEVER coming back here again! I would've got better service at the Checkers across the street! I don't know why I even paid for my meal!"
Marcus W.,"Fort Wayne, IN",53,28,16,4.0,4/11/2015,Applebee's is always da bomb but Keyshia was not....I think she was feeling some kinda of New York way being from the Bronx.
