KAROL C.,"Bronx, NY",20,73,58,1.0,4/25/2015,"Third Ave and Fordham Road location. While  the service may be quick, waiting for your drinks is too long!  The food arrives before the drinks!  This place was packed on a Friday  and one bartender!  Not worth the wait for the wait, the food is basically tasty, however  the adult beverage situation  is terrible!"
Kristen F.,"Staten Island, NY",110,49,135,1.0,12/3/2015,This place sucks... slow inattentive service. The only reason to come here is if you want to drink flat beer from a dirty line or be ignored.
Dayshon H.,"West Bronx, NY",0,2,,1.0,6/24/2016,wish I could give negative stars....came on a Friday 6:30 (3 adults 2 kids)  asked about happy hour and was told it was until 11pm we were seated almost an half an hour later in the upstairs section our hostess seats us and 2 minutes later takes our happy hour menus and apologized because it was 7:00 and happy hour ended when we explained that we were told by our host happy hour was until 11 she replied he was new. We asked to speak with the manager (Al Clark) and he tried to explain it was a mistake and reluctantly comped us one round of happy hour drinks...As we were waiting for of food the restaurant was not well ventilated in the upstairs section and with all the flame cooked food it became very smoky and the fire alarm kept going off...we were so uncomfortable the only good thing was our server (Brooke) she was very accomodating but clearly over worked...update we got our bill and he only comped us 1 drink 1 at happy hour price and 1 was full price
S P.,"Newark, NJ",12,10,11,2.0,9/6/2015,"I find it hard to be disappointed at a place like Applebee's, since the menu is no surprise and the prices are reasonable. It's a beer, wings, or burger type place for myself.  I was in NY visiting a friend, we chose to hang out here for a drink or two, and I must say the service behind the bar sucked. There was no Heineken on tap, the Samuel Adams was flat, and the Coors Light had a weird odor to it.  Our bartender spent more time away from the bar than behind it.  Luckily my friend and I didn't make a big fuss over it as we were just trying to catch up and enjoy ourselves.  I should of known from the beginning of our visit as my friend asked for a water and the bartender completely forgot it and finally, like 20 mins later, my friend had to remind her and ask for a water again. I didn't look for any names, but I just had to say, as someone who has had some great experiences with great service at Applebee's in my home area, I was like damn, this Applebee's sucks...lol. Like I said I didn't take names, but I do know our bartender was dressed as Wonder Woman. They were having a best costume contest for the employees. And on a better note, when the shift changed, our 2nd bartender, dressed as Cat Woman was much more attentive and took care of us normally. So peace to  Cat Woman lol for her i give 2 stars."
Grace C.,"Concourse, Bronx, NY",8,5,,1.0,8/3/2015,Horrible service came here for my son birthday he tells the waitress it's his birthday and all she said was ok was not friendly at all. Then I order a salad took her 25 minutes to tell me they were out of salads and didn't even bring me a menu so I can choose something else just horrible service!
Bella L.,"Methuen, MA",72,182,183,5.0,3/28/2013,"My favorite Applebee's location. Employees make you feel so welcomed and valued and it seems the Chef takes a little extra time in preparing your food just right. The service is great and the food is delicious. I've visited a few other Applebee's but this one is my favorite. I did have a negative encounter once but just like they say to turn a frown upside, that is exactly what the manager did. She fixed that issue right up! so I do not stress that one time. My favorite is the Cajun Shrimp Pasta, favorite drink is the Sangria and I try to fit in the Triple Chocolate Melt if I am not that full. It is so good and they let you know, it's real Haagen Daz ice cream served with it. The bar is also cool here, especially sports nights. Those sport fans turn into comedians. Great food, at great prices in a great atmosphere, how can you go wrong. Enjoy!"
Stephanie C.,"Bronx, NY",0,14,,1.0,9/14/2015,"Never would I ever eat at this place again. They almost KILLED ME. Couple weeks ago I came here with some friends. I was not hungry so as my friend ordered meals I order a dessert ( the chocolate lava cake with ice cream ). Not only did our order take a hour to make. But I was served my dessert with peanut. I chose that dessert knowing it was not served with nuts but when I bite into it I had a peanut. Thank goodness I  had a minor allergic reaction to it which is a itchy throat. I just drank alcohol. And my friends orders were all messed up and they had to reorder. How annoying, so I'm never eating there again."
Maxien A.,"Bronx, NY",2,50,14,1.0,7/17/2015,"These people always ruin my order. It's really not that complicated! I've been a few times to this location hoping that it'd be better, giving it a chance each time. However, I have no plans to return. The service is not good and the food is no better. Really terrible."
Joaquin C.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,4,2,1.0,11/29/2015,The service was horrible. The moment my girlfriend and I got there it was ok at the beginning but after the main course got on the table no one asked how we were doing. We have to wait more then 30 minutes to see the waiter again after waiting  for so long my girlfriend and I decided to order dessert that was another 20 mins waiting for it. That was already disappointing but to make it even worse LANAYA our waitress come out with the wrong dessert. She really brang down our experience.
Monique D.,"Greenwich, CT",39,32,10,1.0,6/10/2015,I've been to this location several times.The waiters always have gotten SOMETHING wrong. The food is barely ok. It tastes like school lunch. The employees are overall have attitudes. A young Caucasian waitress kept speaking to my go up and I in an unprofessional/ slang. (My group was over 30 and polished looking) Don't know what made her think we speak that way. Very sweet girl but some of the Ebonics she used made us uncomfortable. (slang is one thing but how she spoke to us was not natural slang even for an urban area) Just a very weird experience. We laughed it off. Forgive me if I offend anyone. Just describing our experience as we perceived it. I think they need to hire employees a bit older and mature.
Jess F.,"Bronx, NY",6,20,36,2.0,9/4/2015,"I've been to plenty of restaurants and in my opinion the greeter/person that seats you is the first person you see... So it would be nice if they were nice to you. That's just my opinion. I visited this location with my friend today and the greeter looked miserable. She mumbled something under her breath. When we were seated she mumbled something about the 2/$20 and walked off. The place was warm, no AC or it was low so that's always nice. But our server, Alexandria was really nice and attentive. That's the only good thing about the visit. Other than that I wouldn't bother going again."
Alessandro T.,"Manhasset, NY",3,31,12,2.0,1/21/2015,"What can I say about this place which I frequent about once every couple weeks? Well the the beers flat, food takes about an hour to come, and my favorite part is the rude obnoxious bartenders. Well not obnoxious because that would mean they would interact with you, we'll leave it at rude, slow and incompetent. I continue to go here because it's usually a humorous venture for me and my buddies and we have a good time despite the gremlins behind the bar. The food has been good most of the time and I've tired a variety of dishes from this place. My advice is DO NOT SIT AT THE BAR if you would like any kind of decent service. The bartenders here have earned this Applebee's two stars along with the flat beer. If you stay away from them you should have a decent experience, it's not all good in the neighborhood..."
Bonisha V.,"East Bronx, NY",3,5,,1.0,9/17/2015,"Service was not that great. I asked for a French onion soup & when it finally arrived if looked as if it was preheated the bowl was hot but the cheese and bread were so hard. Then I sat there 20 min waiting for my next soup and it never came. When the waiter approached my table I asked what happened to the soup he said h said it didn't look good and didn't suggest another so I didn't bring it  I was so mad because wasn't he supposed to suggest another? Anyhow as my husband and I sat there and waited for our food 4 waiters came with appetizers and I asked why are they bring this and they said we ordered it mind you we never ordered appetizers just the soup that I was dying to eat that unfortunately I never got. The food was good, but the service sucked and My husband still tipped very well, but what ever.  I'm still upset at the fact that I didn't get that soup. I'm expecting and I needed that soup. The waiter will get a stye for doing me wrong  lol"
Anita D.,"Bronx, NY",5,12,8,1.0,3/7/2015,"This place is honestly lucky that I give them 1 star. I am appalled at the service. The waiter was ok. The manager was offended that we had said something about the poor service. They added on food that we didn't ask for. The portions were so small for an unreasonable price. Some of the food ordered was NOT cooked. And I feel kind of weird  after leaving the restaurant. And they added money to the food when it cost something totally different. They tried to take an extra 40 dollars from me. Just horrible. Will not go there ever again. And hopefully others don't go either. I rather have gone to White Castle , at least they get me what I asked them."
Jack K.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,13,,5.0,5/4/2016,"Absolutely wonderful experience. Brooke was a fantastic waiter, the best I've ever had. She made our night and handled our large party wonderfully. Our highest praise goes to her."
Augustine M.,"Chicago, IL",10,12,,5.0,9/18/2014,Great spot! Angie's the bomb! She always makes sure my dining experience has a happy ending!
Edgar S.,"Bronx, NY",98,556,145,3.0,5/10/2011,"""Pink or no pink?"" That's the question I got when I asked for my burger ""medium well."" It sounds more like something from a porno then preference of how someone would like their burger cooked. I actually asked my server if she was ""serious."" I shook my head and just ordered. Anyway, the decor is cool. The Bronx is reppin' with photos of everything from the borough that never gets respected.  25 minutes during lunch time for a party of 1, with a mostly empty tables to wait for a burger?  At least it was worth the wait because I destroyed the burger. It was goooood.  Its cool lunch option. Dinner, ehhhh."
Tae K.,"Bronx, NY",69,57,70,1.0,12/19/2015,"I would give this place a zero if I could.  I came here on Dec 1st, 2015 at around 5:30pm right before I went to the pre-opening for the Train show at the New York Botanical Gardens.  The place had no wait but why would they?  The one server at the bar( young Spanish woman) wasn't very pleasant, she was more concerned about gossiping with c0-workers about men who normally come in to the establishment.  I believe I even heard her use a derogatory name to reference one of the men (ni$$*).  I didn't catch her name and it was because she didn't offer it.  She got my order wrong and then blamed me in a very nasty way.  She never came back to check on my party after she brought my food out.  The food was utterly disgusting and I didn't even eat it.  My friend only had a drink, thank god!  We had to wave her down to get OUR check.  When she came back to our spot at the bar she saw nothing was even really touched on my plate and didn't even ask was everything ok.  I see this is why I stopped going to places of this caliber and started frequenting new chic pop-up restaurants.  Happy hour is just as cheap, food is better and service is always on a thousand!"
Jay B.,"Philadelphia, PA",8,16,138,3.0,9/18/2014,Ask for Angie you get a free appetizer with that ENTREE! Woooooooooooorrrrrrrllllllllddddddd staaaaaaaaaaaaar!
Solangi R.,"Bronx, NY",16,12,1,1.0,9/5/2014,So my and bf walked in there and our table was dirty so we moved then the chair was dirty so I tried  to go wash my hands and the bathroom men and women were out of service seriously.
