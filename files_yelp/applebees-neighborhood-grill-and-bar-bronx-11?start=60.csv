Mardory V.,"New York, NY",395,413,1358,3.0,7/3/2011,"Slow bar service...Burnt fish...Awkwardly constant attempts to force feed me....where do I begin... All drinks come from the bar and are served by random servers who seem to like plopping drinks down on all tables...appetizers came on time..HUGE nachos portion without which I would have left without any actual food. This applebee's gets 3 stars only because my hubby's meal was done right and came with good timing, the nachos and the alcohol ratio was perfect.  I HOWEVER suffered the misfortune of ordering the salmon dish.... It arrived appearing somewhat normal with deep ""grill"" marks.  Upon my first bite I find that this salmon must have been swimming in coal because the underside was literally so black it could have been carbon! How can you mess up fish? I stopped eating right away and had to wait about 10 or so minutes for our waitress to re-appear from wherever waiters go and dont return....So she hurriedly starts taking it away and asks if I want another one.  Well, I glance at hubby's nearly empty plate and decide it won't be fun to have him stare at me eat for 20-30 minutes...(Hey I'm a slow eater) I told our waiter I didnt want anything else, she sends the floor manager who apologizes and says another salmon will be out in 15 minutes ( Note to the cook fish doesnt take 15 minutes to cook). I say no thanks I've had my drinks and I dont want to wait another 15-30 minutes for more food/drinks.  So she sends over the kitchen manager who apologizes and asks me if there is ANYTHING he can do, ANY dish I would want to eat he would do it ANY way I wanted...By this time I'm weirded out and hubby is surprised at this guy's drive to please me and we're both dreading they'll send someone else over.....It was like if I didnt get something else they would get in trouble...GEESH! I kinda felt bad but I was a little too tipsy to care so we left.  I dont know what was worse: the burnt fish or the non-stop cajoling...  it's nice for them to aim to please but sending 3 people is weird."
Sammy S.,"Bronx, NY",6,54,,2.0,3/23/2013,"So, I went here recently and had a pretty poor experience.  I ordered the Southwest Shrimp Alfredo.  When I got my food, it tasted off.  It was bland.  I asked for extra parmesan cheese on the side.  They brought me mozzarella, which is a very mild cheese.  When I informed the waitress that she brought me cheese that I didn't want, her response was that they were out of parmesan.  Seriously??? Parmesan is a flavorful cheese.  That is probably why my meal tasted off.  You can't make  Alfred without parmesan.  I was really annoyed that the kitchen was making poor substitutions with the food.  Overall, I say go to a better run Applebee's.  I've had other problems with the Applebee's to go service too at this location."
Selenie V.,"Bronx, NY",0,3,,1.0,12/12/2014,"A few hours ago I ate at this apple bees with some close friends and family members . The service was awful and the wait was extremely long for my food. However the worst part was after coming home I felt sick. I believe it was the cheeseburger sliders I ordered . I basically just vomited everything I ate ! Thanks Applebee's ! Ps- on my way out the restaurant I sat down at the waiting room area to wait for my brother as he returned to our table to pick up his hat. An extremely rude employee stated I couldn't sit there because customers waiting to be seated are only allowed to sit there -.- even after I expressed to him I was just briefly waiting for my brother and I just had been eating there !  Overall I hated it I won't go to this location again, I got sick and the employees were rude !"
Eladio A.,"Titusville, FL",0,30,19,1.0,8/5/2014,It all started as soon as we walked in there was no one at the door to greet us there are four employees talking by the stairway when I went to go take a seat an employee told us. you have to wait in the front so you have to go back to the front with me to seat you. As soon as we sat down the employee grabbed menu's and said follow me. She then sat us but it is very close the front entrance . We had a carrage and a small rolling bag.  It was 3:05 pm other customers that came after us were getting served before us time we got some new tricks to take our order it was 330 and by the time we got our food it was 4 p.m. I was finished by 4:05 because my burger was so light that it took me 5 minutes to eat my wife finished at 4:20. The waitress gave me the bill at 4:53 I waited for her to come back to collect the money but she never came back so I left the money on the table and I told the employees at the door as I did not see the waitress and she says I'm sorry and that was the end of my parients Applebee's If I didn't pay the bill they probably wouldn't never notice anyway. Terrible service at all points. This place needs a manager. The hostess that greeted us was pretty rude and condescending.  And the waitress was really nice but she disappeared 15 ~ 20 minutes at a time never showed up to any of the tables. There's really no importance to customer service if this location is taking new manager I will apply and I'll fix it up
Juan M.,"Bronx, NY",34,4,,1.0,3/4/2014,"The service wasn't there, allow me to explain, I have eaten at this particular location once and the service wasn't good, the waitress bring out the dishes didn't know what was being served, the food wasn't bad but it wasn't memorable either which isn't good in my opinion. Recently I walked in with my brother to order to go and we were directed to go to the bar, which was unattended, to wait for someone to take the order. We had numerous conversations while we waited and finally the bartender acknowledged us after about 15 minutes. We advised her that we wanted to order a dish and she said she would take our order soon. We waited for her to return, but she never did after 20 more minutes. We ended up leaving all together without any service."
Marlene M.,"Fordham, Bronx, NY",0,14,4,4.0,8/25/2014,"I've been here a few times with family and I must say that I have not had a bad experience. The happy hour special is the best in town if you're looking to be in an energetic environment. I love sitting at the bar. The bartenders are friendly, and not too flirty. I'm giving it four stars simply because it Applebee's and the food isn't anything to get too excited over."
Joseph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,57,,1.0,1/21/2015,"You could fly to Miami quicker than you could be served a beer and wings here, and the most appalling part of what I just stated is that it is not hyperbole. To invoke another Floridian culture staple, walking into this Applebee's is like walking into the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. It can take upwards of ten minutes to be seated, just like the theme park attraction, as the hostess blatantly ignores you or disappears into the proverbial Twilight Zone. The ride only gets worse, though, as the wait staff regularly disregards your table for long stretches of time, forgets to refill your drink, gets your order wrong, or take far too long to give you your check. You never know what's going to happen in the Twilight Zone, and you never know what scary surprise you'll be in for next at the Fordham Applebee's. You may even miss a business meeting, class, or an important deadline waiting for your change."
Jon H.,"White Plains, NY",21,116,,3.0,12/3/2011,"Ummm, well I recently went with my wife on Veterans Day and they had a nice special; get one Entree and the other one is free - you can't beat that!  My wife ordered a chicken topped salad and I ordered from a special menu provided for Vets Day - a small 7oz steak.  The food was ok but I sure was hungry about an hour later. I guess you get what you don't pay for ha!  As it was crowded we sat by the front door near the hostesses who provided free entertainment - they were actually dancing together to the music being pumped through the restaurant. That was ""interesting"": I'm no prude but it looked a bit odd to see these young women doing dances I last recall seeing done in my military days in a strip bar.  Ummm, I guess the entertainment was free too! Not quite sure that fit with the ""family-theme"" Applebee's tries to put out there.   The only negative was the wait to pay the bill.  We needed to leave quickly and were stuck for an extra 15 minutes with no food or drink in front of us to pay - didn't the waiter want his tip?  A bit odd I thought.  Anyway, I will go back for a special probably but overall I was a bit  underwhelmed."
Daneliz R.,"Bronx, NY",180,238,30,4.0,3/9/2011,"Eat here frequently with the team, friends & even my mom.  Good Service. The Manager Que is great & knows all of us by name & treats us extremely well. Never eaten anything I didn't like. Drinks could  use a bit more alcohol but thats all Applebee's not just this one. UFC Fight Nights are a popular event here & its standing room only so I suggest you secure a table early. Good place to hold a private meeting, conference room is available if scheduled in advance, just make sure to confirm the reservation, unfortunately they forgot once though they did prepare the room immediately & we only had to wait about 15 minutes. Parking is easy to find, street parking is available & there is also a parking garage around the corner.  It tends to get busy so if your impatient this may not be the Applebees for you on a Friday or Saturday night."
He-Anne M.,"Bronx, NY",0,43,128,2.0,2/10/2015,"I like it here... well sometimes when there aren't stupid people that works here. Went here with my friend and ordered the two for $20 and the waitress gave us horrible service the whole time!! First we ordered classic BUFFLO wings with RANCH AND BUFFLO SAUCE and the waitress told us later that they didnt have anymore wings and she will give us boneless. . FINE. Second, she then brought out BBQ BONELESS wings with just ranch sauce umm we then said ""we wanted bufflo not BBQ"" and she replied saying that she was sorry and that she will take it off our bill. Then when taking our orders, I ordered the steak and mashed potatoes and my friend ordered some shizzling entre, we also wanted BLUE CHEESE CRUMBLES. She came out with our entre's and i said to her ""Excuse me, you forgot the blue cheese crumbles.."" and shes like ""Oh,  sorry and came back with ranch!! Then she went back and brought out blue cheese dressing,i was so disappointed....What got me more upset were the fact that her  friends were sitting by the table asking her what we were saying to her and she was talking about us to them in front of us! She was soo unprofessional. Last, our bill came, it was all wronngggg she charged us wronggg and thats when we hoped that her clueless mind thought ""DAMN, ITS ME not them."""
Jacob P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,35,2,2.0,4/22/2014,table service sucks. the waitresses are fucking jerks with condescending attitudes. that whole staff needs to be fired.
Marsellette D.,"Manhattan, NY",366,4,4,1.0,10/9/2011,TERRRIBLE service!!!! waiting for our drinks over 20 minutes before we decided to stand up and paid then LEFT...   they didn't TAKE their jobs seriously and thinking about customers!! very disappointed!!
Chris Michael M.,"New York, NY",123,35,98,3.0,8/26/2010,"Applebee's in the Bronx?! near Fordham University?!! My friends and I would usually come here for a nice dinner, instead of cooking. Plus, its college student friendly. This location has some nice Fordham-themed decor! There are old pictures of Fordham Road and the community from like 30-50 years ago? They have a whole in tribute to the athletics and sports at Fordham University. This place even welcomes Fordham students to the upstairs seating lounge where you can overlook the main floor and bar area. It's pretty nice. The burgers are delicious. The artichoke spinach dip is okay; I can pass. The pasta are good. All in all, the food is not bad, actually pretty good. But the service sucks!! Everytime I come here the waiters and cooking take forever!! They always seem to be just hanging out and chatting with their coworkers.  This place is just okay."
Sarah C.,"New York, NY",154,353,60,3.0,4/29/2010,"You know what? I kind of had fun here. Back before I moved out of the neighborhood, I made Boyfriend take me here because when I was in high my first date was for half price appetizers with two other couples. It was incredibly awkward with bad food, but like most things about high school that were kind of cheesy and awful, you can't help but laugh at them now. So, we went to Applebee's, and pretended to be on Long Island with nowhere to go. I felt mad nostalgic. I felt really happy I didn't have to move home after college. Then we got our food. I got some sort of ridiculous sandwich with bacon and way too much white bread and iceberg lettuce. It came with soggy fries. Boyfriend got a gargantuan burger, also with bacon. We laughed at how deep and wide the booths were, especially after we spotted a table of really fat people who could only sit two abreast. That's when I remembered that Applebee's is kind of disgusting and opening one in this neighborhood is not going to help solve the obesity crisis among the lower class. That was a downer. Still, I like that they've decked the place out in Yankee's and Fordham sports memorabilia, as well as photos of other Bronx attractions. They apparently had so many job applicants here that getting hired was more difficult than getting into Harvard, so the service was good. It was clean and bright, and guess what? After 10, they have half price appetizers and beer. It may not be all that great, but sometimes, it's fun, right? Is it hipster of me to ironically like Applebee's?"
Sillygoose S.,"Manhattan, NY",232,35,220,3.0,8/20/2012,"Surprised to see that my Applebee's Neighborhood Grill improved from my last experience of this restaurant.   I noticed that the managers are at plain sight and the service was excellent.   My waiter, Luis was very attentive and had the pleasure if speaking to Alfonso, the manager himself. I ordered my usual Bourbon Steak with loaded mash potato.  Glad to add Applebee's back on my list."
Dionne A.,"East Bronx, NY",84,57,10,3.0,3/29/2013,"It was an ok lunch special, the tortilla soup was awesome and it was pretty clean and convinient...ehhhh"
Michael J.,"New York, NY",208,298,93,4.0,1/24/2013,Have visited this Applebee's location a couple times and service is pretty good and so is the Steak. I normally don't go for Steak at chains but this location makes a good one.
Kristine R.,"West Bronx, NY",1,6,6,1.0,7/16/2014,"By far one of the very bad Applebee's experiences I have had. Over cooked fries. Asked for a basket of garlic read, got two uncooked small pieces. Over fried shrimp, no manager table visit instead he was on his phone on the floor the whole time. Waited more than 30mins to get greeted. Food here sucks and so does the management!"
Vern W.,"New York, NY",20,52,12,3.0,5/9/2012,The food is standard Applebee's fare.  Which is a plus.  Lots of options except maybe for vegetarians (but I suspect a vegetarian would not go to Applebees or it's ilk) Service varies. I have gotten speedy service on some days and others it has been very slow.  The thing that makes up for it is that the staff is generally very nice.
Albert R.,"Bronx, NY",0,5,,1.0,3/14/2011,"Hey Yelp!  I'm one who is simple in what I like, and that applies for dining out. Good food, and good service. Anything else is just extra that's not expected. But sadly, in this location the food is OK, but the service is something out of a bad movie. As if they are trying to live out a stereotype of the restaurant business. Granted, when I heard this location was gonna open, I was thrilled. He I am, born and raised in this neighborhood, though I spent most of my ""growing"" years going to school in Manhattan as well as working in the city, it was nice to know something that I was use to was going to be ""in the block"" so to speak. I've gone 4 times since it's opened, and every time I go, I just assume that the last visit was a 1 time issue, easily fixed because I asked my self..it can't just be me. We'll the first time I went, which was around when it opened, service was a bit slow. I didn't think much of it. With a new staff and what looked like a young staff..I figured it was a work in progress. The second time, I sat at the bar. I would have to say my appetizers must have taken over 20 mins to come. Which was odd, since it was later at night, and not crowded. The bartender had a tendency to stay on 1 side of the bar, so getting more drinks was just a general hassle. The 3rd...well that was an epic fail. 3 colleagues and myself decide to go eat. We sat in a table, and after waiting about 10 mins for the waiter to come and introduce himself, we all knew it was gonna be an interesting night. We basically ordered before he left, since we  were uncertain the next time he would come, we figured while he is around...why not.  If I didn't witness/be a part of this myself I would have not believed it. For appetizers and 4 salads, it took 1 hour and 25 mins. You read right. 1hr 25 mins. He only came after I walked to him to grab his attention,(about 35 mins in) told him if he could check on our food. He said he would. About 50 mins later he came back (just as we were standing up to leave annoyed at the situation) bringing the food with him. That was about 8 months ago. But tonight after my long hiatus from apple bee's (in all locations- my way of protesting the service) I decided after a quick workout I should get a quick bite to eat. Surely things have changed..right? Not at all. I walk in, I don't notice a hostess. Doesn't really mean anything since she may have been seating someone...(doubtful) I went ahead and walked to the bar and sat down. The Bartender comes over and I informed her I would be eating. She gives me a menu. Could it be? My first good experience...I spoke to soon. I waited about 10 mins for her to come back to order my food. Maybe she figured I needed extra time to order, so I didn't hold that against her. After I ordered, I waited. Well, being a thirsty man after my work out, I wanted some water. Bad move...She finally comes over(she basically stood in one side of the bar) and I ask for some water and it actually works out. Here I am waiting some more, for the food. I would say I waited about 30 mins. Here we go again.. I'm looking around noticing it's not busy, so I can't imagine the kitchen being busy either. Guess what I saw...A guy that looked like he was a COOK coming out with his food and sitting down to eat. I'm a customer...god forbid..I wanna eat at a restaurant in a timely fashion... Finally the food comes..delivered by possibly the runner. As I am finally ready to start my dinner..What's left?? Well..No silverware. No biggie, I'll just ask the bartender. Well..I would have if she did leave to go to the restroom for about 5 mins. I kid you not. I ate my food quickly, and wanted to pay. I was lucky to grab her attention and ask for my check. Well, to say the least, that part of it came within seconds...So your thinking thats the end of the story right?? Nope.. I had to wait another 5 mins to try to pay!!...I waited long enough that I finally saw a manager and asked him if I could pay. He was nice, I could tell he was wondering where the bartender was. I mentioned to him my experience for my dinner. He was pleasant and listened. I hope this letter reaches him. As a person who deals with many people on a daily basis I know things can get fixed. It's a matter of implementing change.  I don't think I have any intention of ever eating at any applebee's ever again. Well, unless I happen to read reviews on yelp and it's glowing. But truth be told in regards to this location..I wouldn't hold my breath. I hope this helps people."
