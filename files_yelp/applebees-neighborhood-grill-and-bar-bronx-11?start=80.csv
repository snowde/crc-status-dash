Tee B.,"Manhattan, NY",24,57,46,1.0,5/16/2011,"the worst dot org!!! Came here last friday, arrived at  a few minutes till midnight. Was told they would be closing soon but a friend said they closed at 2a. Then the waitress at the bar said 1a....all we could order was one drink which took forever because she barely looked up from her ""dish"" duties. And when i asked could i order an app she states that the kitchen is closed yet they seated a party of seven as soon as i walked in and they ALL ATE....hmmmm????.....of course we complained to the manager Quie....This is why we never get any good spots in the hood....Go to Fridays on Gunhill Rd or BBQ's on Fordham. Better service and better food with consistent hours!"
LaBeauty L.,"Bronx, NY",4,9,,3.0,11/13/2011,"Me and my sister only go here for the 2 for $20 deal and for the fact that kids get free juice and refills. The drinks are ok and the food is fine. This place is set up nice but still nothing special to brag about. It always seems to be jammed packed but you never have to wait to be seated. The longest I've ever waited was maybe 5 minutes at most. One thing that I must say is that I feel the females workers are always dressed inappropriately some wear head scarfs, tank tops with boobs hanging out and half of the time the girls look like they're going to the club after work. I think the females should wear button down shirts just like the guys. Besides that me and my sister will keep going to get out steak and potatoes with the boneless honey barbecue chicken =)"
Frances D.,"Bronx, NY",67,24,3,5.0,5/13/2011,Finding great customer service is sometimes harder than trying to find a needle in a hay stack... I believe it also depends on your waiter and management... My family and I went to Apple Bee's so that we could celebrate my girlfriends birthday... The kitchen was backed up so our food took a while but our waiter Brett was heaven sent. I have a mentally disabled child and he tends to act out every so often especially when plates are being taken away and Brett was very understanding. I ordered a medium well steak and it was bought to me well done. Brett took my plate away and returned to inform my there was a rush on my steak.... A few minutes later the Manager Quie came out with him and stood table side to make sure my steak was fine... He stated that if that steak wasn't done to my liking he would return it yet again and bring me another... My steak at first sight wasn't exactly what I wanted and I just said it was fine as I felt they went through enough trouble to appease me and my family and he mentioned that I didn't look please and that all I had to do was say the word and he would give me another steak.... As I cut more I realized the steak was perfectly fine... I originally order the house sirloin and was given a porter house for it not being right the first time..... I must say for a large party as mine our waiter never showed distress or impatience and the manager was WONDERFUL! it is definitely a place I recommend.. There are many young waiters and waitresses and I too have been there and had not so good service... Everyone isnt great and everyone isn't horrible... But in my opinion their manager Quie is the best around Side note* my mother ordered a drink and it wasn't weak it was actually pretty strong!
Michelle S.,"Bronx, NY",0,12,,1.0,8/7/2013,The food in this place is very good. The drinks are watered down. Oh warning don't leave your table to go the bathroom Ana the server here might want to take your husband away. I recommend the food but the service sucks! Plus I wasn't given back my credit card back. I had to go back to this place to get my card.
Tara C.,"New York, NY",0,4,,5.0,8/3/2011,"Good food and good service, fun and energetic atmosphere. I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, but I like coming to this Applebees for several reasons.  It's super clean, it's always playing good music, there's plenty of HD flatscreen tvs throughout the restaurant to catch the games, and in my experience, the service is why I give it 5 stars.  I read the other comments and I'm sure every server is different, but my server Jennifer took care of everything that I needed to have a great dining experience.  I didn't really need to ask for anything because she always came back with what I needed on her own, refills, extra napkins, etc.  You can always tell a good server from a crappy one and she's definitely a gold star.  As for the food, I come for the honey BBQ wings. They're good."
Natasha S.,"Bronx, NY",29,62,60,2.0,4/19/2011,"I came here this past sunday to have dinner with my hubby. First of all I am used to going to the Applebees in Bay Plaza. Even though that one is always rather crowded especially on weekends the service is rather good. Now lets talk about the service here. The waiter we had was extra friendly but he definitely was not prompt in bringing our drinks or food. I can't blame him because the drinks come from the bar and the food comes from the kitchen so technically the slowness of everything is not his fault. It is very aggaravating though when you have to wait 20 minutes for drinks and 45 minutes for your food. What did they do? Go to the farm themselves and kill the chicken and cow to cook it lol. The only thing that came out fast was the appetizer which we ordered. It was boneless buffalo wings which I might add I fell in love with. The waiter was very nice and kept apologizing for the drinks and food taking so long to come out. He even sent the manager over to talk to us when he seen we were getting extremely aggravated waiting so long for our food when we were starving. After all that was said and done the food finally came out and it was actually really delicious. I had the bourbon chicken and shrimp and my hubby had the sirloin steak which we had no complaints about. With our food the waiter also brought over another order of FREE boneless buffalo wings which i was pretty surprised but happy about. We also got a FREE dessert on the house as well which me and the hubby shared. We came out of there stuffed like fat pigs because of all the food we ate. All the food was rather good despite the wait. Although we had to wait so long, hey at least they made up for it because some other places wouldn't even do that. Overall the service isn't the best but the waiter being so nice and the free food we got made up for it. Oh and also they have TV's all over playing whatever sports game is on which can be rather annoying because I feel if you want to watch the game sit at the bar. Everywhere else should be for people wanting to have a nice dinner with friends or family. Once the game is on with a TV displayed everywhere the whole male species ignore whoever they are with just to look at the game. Also men watching the game should keep their voices to a minimum because the players on TV can not hear you and when other people are trying to have a nice peaceful dinner we don't need to be hearing idiots shouting at the TV. Well I guess besides that if you want to take your chances coming to this applebess in the middle of fordham rd thats on you but I would prefer any other applebess over this one!!!"
