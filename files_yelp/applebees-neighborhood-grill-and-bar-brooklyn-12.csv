Lily F.,"Brooklyn, NY",416,303,767,3.0,12/23/2017,"Late night dinner calls for whatever is open. Came here with my boyfriend and his friend after realizing we were hungry and wanted something by sheepshead bay. I ordered the oriental grilled chicken salad. It was kind of plain, I was hoping that it'll have more ingredients like it said on the menu. The boneless wings were good, we ordered the Asian one which was sweet and spicy. A bit too spicy for me but still pretty good. My boyfriend ordered the ribs and he didn't really enjoy it. My boyfriend's friend ordered the steak and lobster which he enjoyed very much. The spinach and artichoke dip was pretty good, although I wish the chips were fresh. It didn't seem like they were. I don't think I'd come back unless we had to because I don't prefer food joints. But our waiter, Jonathan was pretty cool and nice. Kudos to him for being attentive when it was so busy."
Huseyin Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",54,9,2,1.0,12/4/2017,Waiting too long for hostes and for server and for receiving food.plus you have to tolerate attitude. This is not hospitality. One star is too much for this place.!!!!!
Elina A.,"Brooklyn, NY",71,20,11,1.0,11/5/2017,"Just got my food delivery that I places through Uber Eats for my parents  ( $5 booking feeand Everything was missing)  No Fork  No Napkin  No ketchup for the fries , I asked for Mayo also Nothing  Burger was missing every single ingredient.  not sure if the cook was sleeping!! only had meat & cheese Nothing else  no lettuce ,  tomatoes,  pickle , onion, bacon  ( yes the 1 I ordered came with all that )  NOTHING.  I EVEN TOOK A PHOTO TO POST"
Eric R.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,,1.0,8/12/2017,"2.5 stars for this location? It deserves 0. We were in there for an hour and finished eating after 30 minutes. The other half hour was spent waiting for the check, which couldn't be paid through their flawed system. And don't get me started on the waiters. We only occupied one table, yet three different waiters/waitresses served us. None of them deserved the $3.97 tip I left and even that amount was being too generous.  And with the amount of salt on my fries, I wouldn't be too surprised if my doctor said I had high blood pressure. To put it lightly, I will not ever visit this place again. Service was horrible and the food was mediocre at best. The valet drivers were the real MVP's of the night."
Redd J.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,1.0,1/8/2018,The manager is super nasty and disrespectful... we sat down and got right back up to leave with out even hesitating after waiting to be seated for 20 minutes ... there were plenty of open tables and no hostess... waitresses continued to walk past us like we weren't even there. After all that the manager sat us with a huge attitude and zero customers service skills .. I've worked in restaurants my entire life and I would never ever treat costumers this way..
Laura F.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,126,166,3.0,10/6/2017,"I recommend their appetizers here, especially the steak quesadilla. But, I don't recommend their steal entrees because it was dry, tasteless and small portion."
Natali P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,,1.0,1/2/2018,Terrible service. Took an hour for the waiter to bring the check. Food was awful as well. I felt like the meat was not fresh at all. The host was very mad at everyone too. I saw a family and a child walk in and it seemed like she was mad that they had a carriage.
Alicia T.,"Brooklyn, NY",316,7,2,1.0,11/25/2017,"HORRIBLE!!!! Came here on a Saturday with my mom to grab some drinks, sat at the bar for 10 mins and was never acknowledged! Mind you there was only one other couple at the bar. No ""hello"" no ""I'll be right with you"" NOTHING! To the young black girl with the two ponytail puffs, I really don't understand why YOU would get into the customer service business if that's something YOU don't want to do. Please quit your day job."
Anton D.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,16,,1.0,7/31/2017,Fire all the waiters. They're incompetent. Owner needs to sell this joke of a restaurant.
Darrin T.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,125,9,2.0,11/21/2017,"As a 20-year resident (1989-2009) of Sheepshead Bay, I came here once when it first opened many years ago. Unfortunately, my one and only time was far from a pleasant experience. It was downright criminal. A male waiter whose name was Irish-sounding changed my tip to a higher one. The amount was over the top. When I checked my card transactions via phone, it did not match my tip receipt. This waiter thought that I must have just fallen off the turn-up-seed truck. When I phoned the restaurant, they assured me that said person will be fired. What I should have done was prosecute his twerp ass."
Joey S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,10,3,3.0,11/14/2017,"There was no wait but the booth was uncomfortable. The seat was sunken in and there was no leg room. The food was the same as always, nothing outstanding. The waitress was also the bar tender and took a long time to serve us."
Wesley Y.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",44,1,,2.0,12/15/2017,"Overall food was great and came at a reasonable time. The only two reasons this didn't get a higher rating was the staff and the seats. Our seats were cramped and had only 1 inch between our bodies and the table. The waitress who seated us was rude and gave us an attitude when we pointed to the seats we wanted. I quote ""We would prefer that you sat in these seats but if you really want to-."""
Cassandra M.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,51,25,3.0,12/7/2016,"Sheepshead Bay is my favorite location. Though I've grown to loath franchise restaurants, I keep coming back here. For starters the staff pretty welcoming and energy is always chill. Next, the food is normally pretty good. Finally, even the take out is good and that's always my biggest issue with Applebee's, the takeout is trash; but not this location.  My family and I had came for a late lunch last Sunday afternoon. We waited a while for our food and was given a discount; very nice gesture! Myself and husband had come for a quick take home dinner, and enjoyed it!  Would most likely come again, even though I'd choose a Mom & Pop restaurant first. If any Applebee's, I'd prefer this one."
Momo K.,"Brooklyn, NY",56,20,3,1.0,6/29/2017,"Decided to come here after a longgg time for some wings. It was FREEZING in here, when we asked to move outside the bartender/waitress actually told us NO!! AC was also never turned off and we asked at least 4 times and other customers were complaining.. actually terrible customer service. For our waitress (and bartender at the bar same time) this is not how you earn your tip sweetheart. The customer is always right, no matter how ludicrous the request. Never coming back. I would give it a 0 if I could."
Ben S.,"Brooklyn, NY",252,1,,1.0,9/17/2017,First off they don't open at 7am it's 9am Sunday tru Thursday if you looking for a drink this early
Thai T.,"Flushing, NY",14,71,75,1.0,2/2/2017,"30 second review go!!!!!@@@@@@@@@ 1. the food quality is ...not fit for human consumption, not fresh, poorly prepared, tasteless, better just go home and heat up a microwave dinner. 2. the drinks/cocktail are $10.00, they are watered down and taste horrible, other 1 star reviewers also has same complaint 3. the stupid self serve/tablet on every table, its tacky, i hate it, it blocks the whole atmosphere out how a decent dinner table should be. this applebee's lost the feeling of the classic ""applebee's nieghborhood grill"", i really believe you could have a better meal with a instant Cup noodle and sriracha at home. whoever thinks this place is anymore than a 1 star probably didn't eat for a several days."
Jonathan R.,"New York, NY",20,3,1,1.0,5/23/2017,"I just ate there and had the worst service experience ever ! I saw my waitress once, when I asked the manager about my desert she ask the waitress for it and never even bothered to look at five dirty appetizers and dinner plates that was still on my table. When the desert finally came out the waitress STILL DID NOT PICK UP THE DIRTY PLATES ! Never coming back !"
Mari K.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",68,4,1,1.0,7/31/2017,"Sitting here waiting for the check which has already taken over 15 minutes. More than half the tables are empty, hostess is rude and seated 5 people at a 4 person table because ""i was gonna seat other people at that table"" -_- no one has been seated there for over an hour. Food is bland and drenched in oil. Just ew."
Bob M.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,8,,1.0,8/4/2017,"Used to like this place. Food, service, bar all gone downhill. I keep trying and am consistently disappointed."
David Z.,"Sheepshead Bay, NY",26,1,,1.0,5/21/2017,Bad service!! We Waiting  almost 10min for give the check !  look busy not is not really...   No more next time to here...
Lilly C.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",3,30,13,4.0,9/5/2017,i prefer this applebee's more than the one on surf ave the wait staff here is so much nicer and haven't had a problem yet with food coming out wrong!(if you'd read my review on surf ave applebees) I love the outside seating it's really pretty!
Bk T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,13,1,1.0,4/13/2017,Rob the waiter starter out pleasant. Orders took 45 mins food was serve cold had to go back. Order a two soda's never came. Applesbees is disgusting.
Andrew D.,"Queens, NY",83,44,12,4.0,3/28/2017,"Went here for dinner Monday evening. The staff was very friendly and greeted my daughter and I with a smile. The dining area was not packed at all since it was Monday, we were seated right away and taken care of. Love the fact that we can order drinks and appetizers from the table at our table, which we took full advantage of. I almost got the feeling like a self service restaurant where the staff just brings your food (Not Complaining). Our food came out in a timely manner and was delicious. Would recommend this place and love the fact that they have their own parking lot with lots of parking available. Will be back for drinks!!"
Tiffani G.,"Brooklyn, NY",69,142,219,4.0,4/3/2016,"I come to this Applebee's a lot when I'm over by my best friends house. It's decently priced and the food always comes out good. I really love the 2 for 26$ special. Comes with appetizer to share and 2 entrees.  I also like to come around happy hour with half priced apps and half priced beers. Who doesn't like a 3$ cold tall glass of Stella!  The waiters are all very nice people and they make sure everything comes out in a timely fashion. The only thing I'd really say was wrong with this place is that we always get the same hostess and most times she just seems like she gets overwhelmed very easily.  Working in a chain restaurant must get hard because in an area like this is gets pretty busy, but she's been working there for a while and still sometimes forgets to even put silverware on the table.  Other than that it's great!"
Deidra G.,"Brentwood, NY",1,14,5,4.0,5/27/2017,"I ordered a pepper jack, bacon cheeseburger and fries it was pretty tasty and simple and the location of this Applebees is right across from the water which I love."
Leonard L.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,13,26,5.0,4/23/2016,Great place to grab a bite. Quiet for a Friday afternoon.  Good and service are consistently good. Another Friday.  Can't beat the two for $20.
Alexandra S.,"Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, NY",25,7,11,1.0,7/5/2017,What a terrible service! They ignored us for 1/2 an hour until we left. I was with a child. We'll never come back:(
Lea M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,1.0,9/19/2017,"If you're looking for great customer service, This is not the place for you. Ordered food once and was given the wrong order. When I reached out for help management told me a lie & gave me the ultimate run around. Wasn't helpful nor friendly."
Angela C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,13,,2.0,2/5/2017,Come here once in a while and their curb side to go is a joke! Now they closed that side and have to pick up my order at the bar. The service is not all that! Not too friendly. They often mess up my orders and pisses me off. Can't do their job what can I say. One unhappy customer
Chris C.,"Rockaway Park, NY",149,55,24,5.0,2/23/2017,"I enjoy stopping in here on my breaks in between classes. I sit at the bar, grab a drink sometimes with a bite to eat and they allow me to do my work. Food is average which is fine and relatively affordable. Happy Hour is generous with time and pricing. The bar tenders are ussually engaging and on point. I don't really have any complaints about this place and I come here often. One of the better applebees I have been to."
Linda M.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,165,378,3.0,12/27/2015,It's Applebee's so food is pretty predictable. Had the 2 for 26. Salads to start then penne pasta with chicken and chicken and shrimp skillet.  Slow start to service.  A couple seated after us in another section was attended to first.  Overall experience was fine.
Felix V.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,11,,1.0,9/2/2017,Food was good but the service is terrible.  First noone was at the front for us to be seated. Then we placed an order with a waiter and in about 10-15 min another waiter came and said he will be our waiter and we had to order all over again.   No one changed our plates or asked if we wanted anything else.   While we were eating waiters/waitresses were standing next to us in the next booth and having conoright over our shoulder. Which was very disturbing.  Would not recommend!
Yasmin K.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",44,7,,1.0,8/30/2017,"Nothing wow about my experience here. The waitress constantly forgot many things. Starting with the food order then the food itself and than the bill. I received my food first and than my father did 15 minutes later and our appetizers came towards the end of our meals. From the beginning of service we informed the waitress of food that we can't eat or drink  due to religious restrictions and yet my father received an alcoholic ice tea and there was bacon on both the mashed potatoes and the four-cheese mac and cheese which we weren't informed of. She then asked if I would like to have an different sides and I chose onion rings which came 30 minutes after, cold. We received drinks on the house and because I'm diabetic I can't have regular soda and she brought a regular Pepsi and an alcoholic iced tea. To top it all off, we were charged for the drinks, onion rings ( which were supposed to be included) and the mac and cheese. Waitress was flustered and clearly couldn't handle the pressure. Will not be returning any time soon. Management was nice but not helpful."
Begum T.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,3,1.0,4/11/2017,The restaurant is not clean. I took photos of dust. Also we wait 1 hour for our food and we didn't like the steak. The waiter was ok but for busy restaurant there was not enough 3 waiters. I don't want to try my chance to go there again for spending money and my time.
Foring A.,"New York, NY",90,137,197,4.0,9/1/2016,"It is a regular Applebee's..but this one is the best one ..if you consider the waterfront location and a Valet parking!!! I have been coming here for gazillion times ..never had any awful experience..but what I found that over here they charge u a tiny bit more than the other Applebee's..otherwise I had good experience over here..It is good for groups,kids and in the summer time u can seat outside and enjoy the view!!!"
Jonathan T.,"Brooklyn, NY",440,221,1587,4.0,3/29/2016,"listen. its a chain restaurant but when you go to a chain you have a general idea of what to expect.  fajita style triple bacon burger..... tasty, lots of grease, fattening.... but delicious. meat can only be cooked medium and up which I find odd. either their meat supplier is questionable or the meat they use isn't fresh.  drinks are good. food is pricy, for two people having lunch our bill was around $50.00"
brenda z.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,,2.0,8/20/2016,we went here tonite and we asked for the talipia not blackened it came back over done. It was 2 orders tasted like rubber so i asked for the garlic  greenbeans that came with the fish. I changed both orders for the stteaks. me and my husband had them we said medium rare it was more like rare. we sent it back again ti was ok. The greenbeans were washed off and very salty. we asked to speak to a manger his attitude wasnt  concerned. we will never go back again i  been here many of times. We should of been compensatdfor sitting 2 hours. SO dissapointed me and my husband.The manage  didnt seem to care one way or another we had problems.HIs answer im sorry and  didint seem to car so goodbye lousyfood place.
Dee M.,"Englishtown, NJ",0,26,11,2.0,3/19/2017,"Came here to watch some March Madness. Waited 20 minutes to even be acknowledged at our table (there was only 3 of us sitting in the bar area). After becoming antsy, I walked over the bar to order our drinks since we were not being attended to. I asked for Stella, Corona Light and Yuengling. She proceeds to tell me no Yuengling. That's fine, I understand. I asked for a Sam Adams ... no Sam Adams. I then ask for a Coors Light which she shockingly had. Brought it back to our table. Another 10 minutes before someone walked over to us. She was SO rude. Like she couldn't even be bothered with us. She took the order then we overheard her talking to another waiter saying ""this isn't even my table"". Oh okay miss I am sorry to have bothered you????? Service was so slow. So rude. Bathrooms were VILE."
Arty A.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",134,1,,1.0,4/11/2017,This is the worst place to eat the services sucks will never come back to this place the food is disgusting and the staff is nasty
Eckie E.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,62,5,4.0,12/23/2016,"Decent food. Their buffalo chicken nuggets are good if you like spicy food. You'll enjoy their appetizer sampler, there will be something for everyone."
