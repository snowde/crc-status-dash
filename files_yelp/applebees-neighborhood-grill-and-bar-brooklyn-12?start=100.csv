Darryl D.,"Marine Park, Brooklyn, NY",0,20,,3.0,9/29/2013,"After Friday's closed, I was dragged to Applebee's by my SO multiple times because she liked their fru-fru girly drinks. And while she's binging on pink cosmos, I'm suffering their horrid food.  Now, I'm not unreasonable. I know that Applebee's food is prepackaged and basically just reheated. I expect that. My issue is when I'm dropping about $60 for two people to eat said food.  I refuse to eat dinner here. If we go, we go to the bar area have a few drinks and get three appetizers.  I will say this. I don't know about the other reviews, but the staff has always been great with us. I've never had an issue with personell."
Tammy W.,"Brooklyn, NY",118,408,162,3.0,10/19/2013,It's ok.  I wish service was better.  The waitresses barely check up on us so it takes forever to get anything even the check
Tom P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,18,,4.0,10/29/2014,"After my Surf Ave Applebee's misadventure, used my gift cards here tonight. Went for early dinner on weeknight so they were not packed yet.  Prompt seating and service.  Had boneless wings with honey mustard on side, steak and tilapia.  Food was better than I expected, compared to expectations from other reviewers. I will go again, esp during non-peak hours."
Jessica S.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",0,5,,1.0,2/7/2015,Beware Horrible service! The manager has no control over seating process. You can go to another restaurant eat and then come back and you will be on the same line waiting to be seated if your not friends with the manager or Black out! Never coming here again.
Cori C.,"Toronto, Canada",106,370,16,2.0,5/14/2013,"I'll admit I went here as a joke. They just started serving breakfast and I expected something like IHOP, Perkins, etc. The food took over 30 minutes to come out, even though the place was empty. The wait staff seemed pretty overwhelmed. We got an omelet and pancakes - they were pretty bad, even for a chain."
Thomas F.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,62,,3.0,1/8/2016,great place for half price appetizers. Service is ok depending on who you get.
Allie D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,11,13,2.0,7/16/2014,"went there with my husband for dinner. waiters texting, damp humid dining area, waited for 20 minutes for a server, cowboy burger was messy and unedible manager not found anywhere not a great place to dine and relax not a good dining experience here"
Jarret W.,"New York, NY",28,22,2,5.0,1/27/2013,"The waiting room has a smell that is reminiscent of human feces. There are few other places in the world that after I walked in and smelled shit, it doesn't seem out of the ordinary and I'll still sit down and eat. Welcome to Applebee's, right?  Service was fast, food was made as expected. What else can you ask for?"
Iama S.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,4,2,3.0,11/11/2014,"Me and my boyfriend have been here a few times and the place is usually pretty crowded, but never had to wait too long to be seated. Nice atmosphere, friendly servers, who are sometimes pretty busy, but to be expected. Food is pretty good, we will continue to come back!"
Mensa M.,"Manhattan, NY",119,372,93,2.0,2/26/2012,Going to an Applebees? PREPARE TO DIE.

Andy R.,"New York, NY",0,93,21,2.0,6/21/2015,"Came for happy hour and left unhappy. Never order margaritas in this place. Completely not what Margarita should be like. It was sour and overly sweet and yucky. So I got a beer as my second drink. Beer was sour too, and it was Sam Adams Boston lager. Apetizers were ok. Next time I am going to a regular bar. At least beer is ok over there."
Gomar H.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,46,,1.0,7/21/2012,"I was there just today.  All the bad reviews are spot on!  I liked the Applebee's in Orlando, so decided to give this  one a try.  Bad idea! 1st waitress took our order, then passed her notes to 2nd waitress.  She could not read what 1st one wrote, so asked  us to repeat.  So we wait like 30mins, while eating the bland appetizers.  I was just about to complain about the wait when the food arrives.  I had a steak, and was served mashed potatos.   To say it was hard as a brick is not enough. My mom's chicken was too spicy, but the shrimp and mushrooms were ok.  Her bro had a steak w/shrimp which was ok as I tasted it.   But wait, where is the soups?  oh waitress... she comes over and  says the 1st waitress was supposed to pass it on.  But, after 10mins  the soup comes. I guess the best part was drinking Ginger Ale to wash all that junk down the pipes.   Oh, and so when I was in the can, a young man was real sick in there.   No more Applebee's for me."
Kimberly F.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,,1.0,11/2/2015,"Everything seem to be ok until we had to wait really long for our food to come out & at the end my 4yr old son gave our waitress Sara (heavy set young lady) her tip & she just looked at my son & put it in her apron, she was very rude, we asked for a container & she refused to give us one, we ended up asking someone else!!!!! Would never ever recommend Sara as a server very nasty & disrespectful for someone that says she has a 2yr old she was nasty to a 4yr old!!!!!"
Melissa B.,"Manhattan, NY",5,18,50,3.0,4/16/2016,"This is a great place to go if you just want to munch on appetizers. Their cheeseburger egg rolls, wanton chicken tacos and loaded nachos are fantastic. However, the entrees were a disappointment. I ordered the mac n cheese with chicken fingers because they described the chicken as ""honey pepper chicken tenders"". To my dismay, they turned out to be ordinary chicken nuggets that were on the dry side, mixed into a bowl of very uneventful tasting mac n cheese. I took a bite of my fiancé's dish which was the brisket enchiladas. They looked amazing in the menu photograph, but were not very good at all. How do you mess up a dish like that? I didn't taste the burgers from the kiddie menu, but they looked gross and the boys hardly touched them. The best entree they have ate the ribs. Other than that, this is not the place to go if you're looking for a full meal. I gave them three stars because of the appetizers and the nice hostess and wait staff."
Joe P.,"Sunny Isles Beach, FL",23,20,2,1.0,5/18/2012,"This is the worst place I have ever eaten at.  I see people giving good reviews and I have to say that they should have their Yelp rights revoked.  I know better than to eat at a chain restaurant but I figured how could they screw up a burger? First, I ordered a side Caesar salad and when I received it, it tasted refrigerated and the croutons were stale.  I then ordered one of their ""signature"" burgers. I asked for it to be cooked medium rare.  I was told that they can't make it this way.  Im still trying to understand why.  I specifically asked that it not be well done.  Sure enough it was well done and the bacon was undercooked...better yet it was cold.  The burger itself was cold and I asked to return it for what I ordered.  So believe it or not, they brought me another well done burger.    With all that said, when I took one bite of the salad and pushed it away the bartender didn't even ask what was wrong with it.  Likewise with the burger, all they asked was if I was finished. In conclusion, the kitchen staff is terrible, the service is completely oblivious and doesn't seem to know how to service their clientele. The best part of the entire place was the valerie guys who got me in and out of there fast.   Sad that I have to actually give it one star."
Alison B.,"Manhattan, NY",9,7,,1.0,5/12/2013,I'll skip the colorful story and head straight to the reasons I will not come back again: -Grossly underestimated the wait time -Seated many parties that came in after our party of 3 -Lackluster wings and chicken finger plates were the quality level of a dingy Lower   East Side bar....at a premium price -Actually reheated some macaroni and cheese once I got home just to make up for the experience And I can't leave out the bloody family fight that broke out in the parking lot on my visit before this one I suppose their location is the reason for any business they have.
Patrick C.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,39,2,3.0,8/3/2014,"My husband and I wanted to try this location even after reading all the bad reviews.  I agree with what allot of people say about the service, we had to wait an hour to get our food.  However the food was much better than I expected!"
Aya S.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,29,4,1.0,6/26/2014,"I had a really bad experience there I didnt like the food at all it was very noisy and I felt like I was setting with the table next to me I could here their conversations and they could hear mine no privacy and they were overpriced , overall am not going back."
Vera C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,,4.0,10/23/2013,"I have no complaints, food is everything that's expected for an all American restaurant.  My boyfriend and I have been coming here every Wednesday night as a tradition, sometimes bringing friends along.  I enjoy their happy hour  $3.50 wine and he his beer.  We almost always stick to the 2 for $20 unless in the mood for 1/2 price appetizers.   Service is great, the staff always does a great job. It helps that they all know us and my wine is already ordered for me once I'm seated, thanks guys.   They're very good with substitutions on the menu if we requested something done differently and changing the channel to accommodate out seats.   I would give them a 5 but I wouldn't push to say that the place is ""As good as it gets"", it's just a casual place with a good atmosphere and a nice short walk from my house.  Hope to see you there tonight!  Must try appetizers: Chicken Quesadilla's, spinach artichoke dip, buffalo boneless wings, potato twisters"
Rich B.,"Staten Island, NY",43,228,63,2.0,3/12/2014,Was forced here by my kids... place is horrible. But I can jonestly say Ive never ever had a good meal at any Applebees...ever.. the parking lot is ridiculously crowded here
