Chastity M.,"New York, NY",0,6,,2.0,2/19/2015,"I don't think I like Applebees anymore Last night I had a sucky waitress with an attitude because I asked for a new sprite. I hate flat soda and I will never drink flat soda. I asked nicely said please and thank you like I always do. She give me the drink with an attitude and I swear I think she gave me back the same exact drink. So ever since then her attitude began. Tried the new pot stickers they sucked! Filling was weird, sauce was weird. Might not have been properly cooked do to me being sick this morning. I had the fiesta lime chicken with mash and I saw pink inside my chicken so i didn't eat it. I didn't send it back because I was so disappointed I didn't wanna say anything. When my weird mojito came I needed water I told my boyfriend to ask for water because I didn't want any more attitude from her. Suprisinlgy she brung me a glass as well. The dessert was the only good thing. Triple chocolate melt down. It came so fast tho obviously it was microwaved. Even my mojito was nasty like I dont understand. For once I would just like to have a good experience and have a waitress take care of me how I do for my customers. Is that too much to ask??! Please step it up Applebees I used to LOVE your food and drinks."
Alex V.,"Brooklyn, NY",36,127,47,5.0,1/19/2015,"I have always been a fan of Applebee's. My most recent time being there was on my girlfriend's birthday. We reserved a spot there because of the amount of people that were going to come. When we entered, I was greeted along with my friends by the employees who work there. When we sat down we explained that we are still waiting for guests and they were very patient. It took about half an hour for everyone to come and join. We made our order and everything like steak, french fries, drinks came in a timely fashion. Nothing was rushed nor delayed. The food was incredible! Everything was tasty and delicious. The place in general was pretty nice and not as noisy as I assumed for it to be. The restaurant was kept really clean. The tables were spotless and so were the carpets in the place along with the bathroom. Emmons is quiet a busy place for people who arrive here on cars, but not to worry because this Applebee's has their own private parking lot. This place is perfect! After you are done with the food you can walk outside to the perfect view of the bay filled with boats and a nice sea breeze. Defiantly a friendly place for friends and family to come by and enjoy what Applebee's has to offer."
Ansel G.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,6,,1.0,9/1/2014,I'll give applebee's credit. They are very consistant. Consistantly bad all around. The food not only tastes like crap it also looks like crap. But that isn't the worst part of this place. The service is so bad it makes me wonder how they could still be in business. Even when I try to avoid the service by getting take out they still screw that up. If you enjoy being forgotten about as well as getting your food at all different points of your dinner this is your spot.
Paul M.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,16,,2.0,5/8/2015,1st waited for my beer after they served me with wrong one . Then they screwed up my wife's order . So I'm leaving 2 stars because the food was a OK and NO Service.
Doris H.,"New York, NY",490,141,105,4.0,6/1/2013,I always like going to Applebee's outside of Manhattan (priced higher than advertised). My boyfriend and I stopped here to grab food and ordered from the 2 for $20 menu (1 appetizer and 2 entrees). I had the 7 oz. steak and the boneless chicken wings for the appetizer. The wings were decent. It wasn't hot. There was three skinny sticks of celery on the side that was a bit warm when we got them. I ordered my steak medium well and that's how I got it. Nice and delicious! The side of vegetables was extremely soft (probably little nutritional value) so I only ate the broccoli (my favorite vegetable). The side of mash potatoes was good (just add a little pepper). Service was a little slower than I would have liked but not unbearable.
Chuck D.,"Irving, TX",0,34,,1.0,4/25/2014,"Disgusting food, filthy place, rude waiters and waitresses. The menus are straight from the hood: torn, ripped off, sticky. I mean it is insane! They do not even know how to cook a burger. Even if you are starving, do yourself a favor, do not end up in this dumpster. To make matters worse, there was a gas leak a few weeks ago, some employees apparently were poisoned by carbon monoxide. They had to shut down the place, fire department and cops were on site, patrons had to leave...But they still had to pay, what a dumpster"
Elizabeth F.,"Staten Island, NY",109,59,,2.0,4/22/2013,"Came here on Sunday for late lunch. We order from the 2 for 26 menu. We decided on the buffalo wings to share. We also added the spinach dip which were both good. For dinner I had the creamy steak and shrimp and my friend had the steak. The service was good, we had to wait a little bit for a table which was fine. The reason for the 2 star review, both me and him did not feel well after we ate. Since we both had steak I'm assuming it was that cause we were both complaining of stomach pains. I've been here before and it was fine, but I doubt I'll be back after this."
Marc S.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,19,3,1.0,2/2/2013,DO NOT SUPPORT THIS PLACE.... During the storm they had power and would not support the  public by letting us charge our cell phones. The food and service is crap
Jay T.,"Brooklyn, NY",33,18,9,1.0,8/31/2013,Came here on a monday to celebrate a birthday with some fam...listen if you work and havin a bad day...go sick and come back when you feel better..it is a poor reflection of customer service when customers see u complaining and looking very disgruntled...anyway besides the bad customer service..the food was trash..i ordered a full rack of baby back ribs and when it finally came 50 minutes later it was garbage!!!!! The meat was way overcooked and dry i thought my teeth was going to break..i def wont be coming back here anytime soon unless its for drinks!
SpanishBOB N.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,29,90,4.0,10/9/2011,"Stopped at applebees after the movies for a quick bite with friends. Once again I ordered the cowboy burger and wasn't disappointed. Furthermore, applebees was clean and appealing. Love the set up! Waitress wasn't up to par, but the overall experience was great.."
Piotr R.,"Manhattan, NY",110,22,30,3.0,6/12/2014,"While driving through Brooklyn my friend and I decided to stop and eat at the local Applebee's. Not knowing a lot of business in the area I figured it would be a safe choice. We started off with the artichoke spinach dip which was really good but the dip to chip ratio was definitely not enough. I got a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger which was cooked properly (medium well), juicy and tender with a good amount of bacon, tomatoes and lettuce. Fries were okay but not to die for. My friend ordered an Oriental Chicken Salad which she HATED. Personally I didn't see anything wrong with it but she claims the flavor was all over the place and the chicken itself was dry. She had one bite and decided not to finish. Therefore we ended up sharing my burger and fries. Our server was pretty forgetful (no napkins or drink refill) but she made up for it with politeness and friendliness. Overall a good vibe and service relative to the price. Well at least they were playing good jams, here's 3 stars."
Sam B.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,260,16,4.0,4/20/2013,"Im a self proclaimed foodie, so snobs like us hate chain places like Applebees. With that said,  gave this place a high rating b/c ( I was dragged in by my sister, otherwise I dont normally go to Applebees)--anyway they had great customer service this morning. The host was friendly and attentive, and my waitress was super cute and really nice. Food is just like any other applebees---medicore. The only things I do like there are the spinach and artichoke dip and they now have fried green beans. I also like the oriental chicken salad and the blackened tilapia."
Frances N.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,26,,1.0,1/7/2014,Why anyone comes here is beyond me...applebees is one of the worst chains going...the food is terrible...i give it one star because of the bar...
G S.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,11,5,5.0,3/19/2013,"I came here for my birthday on a week day and there wasn't that many people which was good. We did not have to wait. The place was very calming and you did not feel like you were at a restaurant. We got a bunch of appetizers which our waiter messed one of the appetizers up but it was not a big deal because another waiter fixed it. The food was delicious! I have to say beats all the similar restaurants such as Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Fridays, etc. I had a Red Apple Sangria and that was awesome! Our waiter was pretty good and we enjoyed our short time there. Overall a great experience and great food!"
Kelsey B.,"Amsterdam, NY",0,28,,3.0,9/23/2014,"I really wanted to go to a nice, non-chain restaurant seeing as I was in Brooklyn for the first time, but by the time we got around to going out to dinner it was late and a lot of restaurants were closing. After stopping at a seafood restaurant and not knowing what anything else beside salmon was on the menu we decided to go to Applebee's to get some grub at a cheap price. I wasn't looking forward to coming seeing as the Applebee's we have here in Johnstown NY is the absolute worst. Besides it being a basic chain  restaurant with generic food it was pretty decent overall. Food wasn't too bad and the service was pretty good. A-OK for an Applebee's."
Jason C.,"Brooklyn, NY",74,11,2,2.0,12/9/2009,"-Food: 2 1/2 stars I ordered the Fire Pit Bacon Burger. It had applewood bacon, chipotle sauce, pepper jack cheese, tomatoes & onions with a thick burger patty. The meat was a bit on the dry side, the dressings was better than the meat. For appetizers I had boneless buffalo wings; they weren't that spicy and also at room temperature. It might not be fair to compare this Applebee's with another since it's a chain, but the other one I went to served at least 15 pieces of boneless wings, this place however served 8 pieces. This Applebee's thinks it's a Manhattan restaurant or at an airport. Many things that belong in the 2 for 20$ are in a separate 2 for $26.99 section. I don't like to be skimped or ripped off. No dessert here. Small portions. Food is mediocre. Quality is mediocre. -Service: 4 stars The lady who served our table was pretty nice and hospitable. She always kept on a smile. Although it seemed like she was at the corner buying time to slack or something from time to time. She also never asked me how I wanted my burger but I understand since I came with 12 people. -Enjoyability: 3 stars I came here for a birthday party, so I had no choice; I would probably not come here on my own will as there are other alternatives in Brooklyn. I'd recommend Three Stars on Avenue U if you are looking for something similar to Applebee's with a restaurant feel."
Win C.,"New York, NY",17,51,43,3.0,8/6/2012,"I was there for dinner & breakfast previously. I like the choices they have for 2/$20 dinner or 2/$26 dinner. the portion was large enough to fill me up & my boyfriend. the food taste ok. I had the steak, the meat was tender enough. My boyfriend had grilled shrimp & chicken with rice. the shrimp was just alright. He liked the chicken & the rice. And then with the dinner receipt, if you go back there for breakfast with the dinner receipt within 1-2 wks, you get 10% discount on your breakfast bill.  since my boyfriend & I wanted to try their breakfast anyway, so the 10% discount came in handy. But the waitress for breakfast time wasn't friendly enough, maybe she was too tired. so we left her alone even she place the wrong order in for my boyfriend."
Jabber V.,"Brooklyn, NY",104,35,9,1.0,8/1/2012,"I've been here three times and I don't know why. They are quick to get your order but the service is pretty dismal. The food is probably microwaved and not enjoyable. Every time I have gone my food doesn't seem fresh, I ordered a fajita type plate with my friend. My friends plate came out somewhat sizzling as it should and mine came quiet and warm. I was very disappointed. I will try to not go there again, but its a regular spot for some of my friends so I will have to push them away from there and to a Chili's or Red Lobster or something. Don't waste your time and money if you are looking for good food."
Ralph L.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,143,67,2.0,5/17/2012,I asked for a Medium steak and was thrown a rare and cold steak. Was sitting with 2 other people and the orders were thrown on the table and we had to organize the plates. We were also never offered refills. Food for other guests was passable. But I have had problems here before. I'll pass next time.
Lori S.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,20,2,2.0,1/19/2014,"This place is really poor with their customer service. I'm not surprised that they only have barely 3 stars. The bartenders at the bar are rude and are not friendly unless your buying a drink or having dinner at the bar. Since we were waiting for a table they outright rolled their eyes at us. The hostess told us twenty minutes, and when twenty minutes came I asked a bout how much longer and she almost told me twenty minutes again. Smh I reminded her of how long we were there and she then said 15 minutes. We continue to stand and wait in the very crowded and packed entrance as we are shooed from the bar, the entrance and everywhere. Meanwhile as someone slept on the couches used for the people waiting. As we are waiting lots of people were leaving yet no ones names are being called. 4 tables that could've sat at least 2 per table just remained with rejected food, dirty dinnerware and no sign of anyone emptying and cleaning to let others sit. From the time we began waiting to the time we were finally seated. Our waitress was pretty good but watching as other waitresses leaned on the wall and sang gangnam style instead of waiting on their tables was the perfect lasting image of thus place. Btw at our table the floor had fries and chips and even some fruit yuck. Then they had the audacity to charge almost $20 for a bowl of pasta and 3 chicken tenders . Never again! I miss TGIFridays not being open..."
