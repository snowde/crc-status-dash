Guy C.,"Brooklyn, NY",164,141,74,2.0,9/14/2013,"Not so good. 2nd time in a row.  Food was tasteless & cold. I never complain because of the saliva & visine factors.   I ate about 1/3 of the asian chicken salad. The waitress who was personable never asked the obvious question, ""is everything ok?""  I used to frequent this Appleby's often but i think its time to give it a long hiatus."
John S.,"Saskatoon, Canada",51,66,2,4.0,1/4/2010,"Dined there on a Saturday night.  Service was excellent, and although the place was packed (always a good sign of quality in a chain restaurant far from the Subway), the experience was not too stressing. The strip on Emmons Avenue is not too bad.  Parking is valet. Ordered again tonight... $10 for Shrimp and Steak.  How on earth do you possibly beat that deal?"
Jerrys K.,"New York, NY",10,81,1,1.0,10/29/2010,"I'd rather have an apple stuck in my ass and a bee sting my balls then go back to that hellhole.  We waited 45 minutes for a waitress only to experience the worst tasting shit ever on the face of the earth. I forgot what the fuck I ordered but it was like someone pouring a jug of salt down my throat.  I'm seriously wondering why a lot of yelpers like this place and raved about it giving it 4 stars, is it me, am I crazy...I dont think so"
Ginger R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,10,,2.0,12/6/2010,"I've eaten here several times.  When I came in with as friend and a big order, service was good.  I came in myself for lunch a couple of times, sat at a table, was completely ignored and walked out.  They do not want service for one.   Lunch was once served cold and lunch doesn't tend to be good.  Dinner on a holiday for 2 with a lot of food was decent.  I would suggest it only for big spenders and more than one person."
Jordan W.,"Bronx, NY",1497,1224,2927,4.0,8/24/2010,"This has got to be one of the best Applebee's ever. I came here last tuesday with my cousins and grandfather on my day off. We had a great time with it. Very cool bartenders and the area is great. I honestly had not been in the area for quite a while.  I ordered the Asian Shrimp it was one of the grilling platters and it was good. I didn't really want one of the lunch specials because the portions seemed really really small (not worth even the $6.99 price).  The strip here is great if you come early in the afternoon you can see some people coming back from fishing and stuff.  I would definitely come back here, hopefully we get the same bartender."
Michael J.,"New York, NY",20,389,11,1.0,4/6/2009,did you forget? Went there a few times (not by choice of course) Things i have experienced ill just make a list: Ran out of beer Bring wrong beer Bring COLD beer in a WARM glass Bring barley warm food Bring all the food for everyone at the table different times Ask for a napkin wait 10 minutes. Refill a soft drink - makes you look at your watch  Always a long wait  Bring the check - FOR EVER The plus valet parking - yay?
Emma N.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,2,,1.0,11/21/2012,"This place doesn't even deserve a star. First let me say the only reason me and my friend came to Applebees was because Friday's was closed due to sandy. We were seated pretty quick. I asked to go to the bathroom and had to walk through a maze like environment. It's so inconvenient. The tables are so close together and the bathroom seemed like a mission to get too. I'm surprised the stalls had toilet paper. There were no towels to wipe my hands with. I went to go sit at the bar and the stools were uncomfortable to sit on because they were wobbling. When we ordered our food we didn't wait long. When the food was brought out the waiter TWICE switched our order so whatever I ordered was given to my friend and vice verse. My friend ordered potato twists and instead he got plain chips with cheese. Who wrote this menu ? It was literally chips and cheese. My wings were good. The drinks weren't as strong. The waiters seemed inattentive and boring. When I commented on how i liked the waiters shirt because it said ""Hello Brooklyn"" on it instead of replying oh thanks! he said ""it's our uniform..."" Not a fun place. i was looking forward to coming to eat here but IT'S NEVER HAPPENING AGAIN. This place needs new management."
Sharon C.,"Brooklyn, NY",89,733,856,2.0,10/11/2010,"I usually don't go to cookie-cutter establishments but I have on occasion been to this Applebee's. I've always been disappointed. Their soups and sauces have a filler texture and everything tastes laced with MSG. Someone invariably orders steak... always excessively fatty. Um, not thrilled."
Andy K.,"East Brunswick, NJ",376,1066,199,1.0,7/11/2008,"Screw these turd burglars...there I said it No seriously...I go here once with my wife (then girlfriend) and we order some of their sub par fast food elite meals. The bill comes and it is like $30.55 and the lady leaves us the thing to leave the money inside it. We leave her a tip and then a $50,a quarter, a dime, and four nickels to give her $50.55. This means she just grabs a $20 for us and it makes life a tad bit simpler for her. I have this OCD where I have to leave exact change for the waitress because I feel like its helping her...yes odd...but whatever...I have this weird thing with bills and giving the person the exact change if I have it. She is taking forever returning with our change...so we decide, ""eh lets just get up and walk over to her, she seems busy."" We are standing behind her and she doesn't realize it. I come to the realization that she is bad mouthing us about giving her the loose change in the bill. Why oh why does she care? I did not realize that giving her 55 cents would make her so angry. I say excuse me, she turns around and is shocked to see us and plays it off like she was not talking about us. I just laughed to my wife, got my $20 and left just finding this entire incident so stupid. Angry applebees lady...I am sorry for being such a hassle...it wont happen again...because I hate applebees...oh not because you are an awful miserable server...but because your food is absolute crap."
Emily S.,"Lynbrook, NY",5,99,,4.0,9/8/2013,"Came here with some friends because they had a voucher that they won for a few free meals. I didn't have high expectations coming here at first but I was pleasantly surprised once I arrived. They have a parking lot with valet parking. The ambiance is your typical Applebee's setting. Our waiter was pleasant and he even introduced us to the general manager who was friendly. We had a three course meal and all of the food was delicious especially the Wonton Chicken appetizer. Overall, I left this place satisfied and happy."
Sherlee R.,"Brooklyn, NY",182,8,,3.0,9/21/2010,"Went out with the hubby last night to Applebee's to spend quality time. Went to the one here on Emmons Ave just to get away from the hustle and bustle of Brooklyn. Service was okay, nothing to complain about really. Hubby ate well and so did I, timely service, clean table. A-Ok."
Virginia Y.,"San Francisco, CA",1562,1444,4563,5.0,12/24/2008,"I love coming to this Applebee's. The location's perfect for spring or summer. After a meal or before a meal, you could take a stroll around and the beach is 15 minutes away I believe. The Mojitos here are pretty good and so's about everything else. Portions are big, filling and affordable. They also have a parking lot, so that's another plus. Worth checking out."
E B.,"Brooklyn, NY",26,18,42,1.0,7/11/2012,"This place needs a complete renovation. The booths are damaged and uncomfortable. The bathrooms are filthy, and the staff is inattentive. The menu is average for a family style chain restaurant. The prices are good since there is usually some sort of special going on. It's nice that you can sit outside and get a breeze from the water, but the wait to be seated when there are empty tables available is ridiculous. T.G.I Fridays and the EL Greco Diner are both only a few blocks away and also have outdoor seating with better food, better service, and a much cleaner environment."
Pliego Family N.,"Salt Lake City, UT",23,225,11,2.0,3/18/2011,"I been here so many times, and I can go on with the problems that I have came upon them. I mean if you feel like you have no place to go then you can go here."
Amy X.,"Brooklyn, NY",203,31,6,3.0,3/2/2010,"I always get the $20 for 2 since I only eat out with my loving boyfriend. The food is alright but we keep coming back. Although I believe Applebees anywhere have no difference .. they always lack a little spaz. I tried to go there on Valentine's Day and it was packed .. they said wait for party of 2 would be an hour. A few times we went there, we had honest waitresses. Nothing too special, my comfort food."
Bryant Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",150,16,33,1.0,12/8/2009,"I came here on a Sunday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. I had the 2 for $20 deal. I ordered the 7 oz steak, grilled chicken caesar salad, and the boneless buffalo wings. When my appetizer came..the waitress ended up serving it to the wrong person. I ordered my steak medium and it came out medium well, the mashed potatoes came out cold. The only decent part of the meal was the grilled chicken caesar salad."
Christopher B.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,115,,3.0,11/7/2012,"I've only been here once, and didn't have a problem. Don't think an Applebee's needs valet parking for THEIR parking lot, so I parked on the street about a half block away. We got their on a Saturday around 3:30 pm after shopping, and beat the crowd. My wife and I took advantage of their 2 for $20 deal. The appetizer and both entrees were fine. The server was polite and attentive. I think if you get here before it gets crazy busy, you'll be fine!!"
Philip B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,20,,1.0,2/8/2012,"Went to Crapplebees, ordered a ""frajita"" dish and distinctively told the server {Russian}""no mushrooms"" cuz I`m allergic to them. 40  minutes later when it finally came, it was cold and LOADED  with `shrooms. I sent it back and waited another 10 minutes. When the servre put it on the table, she said very rudely ""are you satisfied now""? Ate it and left. Bland and tasteless, the chicken was  tough and overcooked, and the peppers and onions were practically raw Gave her a very small tip- and I generally tip very good. . A total bummer, one of the worst ""dining"" experiences I`ve ever had. I intend to complain about it on their website. Avoid this  place like the plague. Not worth your time or money.Zero stars."
Max M.,"Bethlehem, PA",293,27,1,4.0,3/13/2010,how wrong can you go in a applebee's (besides of  the check lol)  the food always rocks the drinks are amazing never found what to complain its my favorite  places to chill and enjoy a nice meal with friends! as usual always great food very friendly staff  (for a Brooklyn restaurant)
gary m.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,261,144,3.0,1/10/2010,"This time, the portions were much larger.  I got the 2 for $20 again.  There were at least 7 pieces of broccoli that came with the steak and a huge scoop of mashed potatoes the size of a burger.  The half grilled caesar salad was a plate full.  I was much more satisfied with the portions this time than the first time around."
