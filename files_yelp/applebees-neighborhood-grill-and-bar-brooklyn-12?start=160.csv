L S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,11,1,3.0,12/24/2008,Well this location is much much better than the Valley Stream in LI.(We been in both places) the food tasted like tv dinners in L I. Awfull! God why did we came?
Nana E.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,9,1,3.0,7/14/2011,"Food is good. Service is sometimes good. I dont know why they need valet parking outside, i think thats just dumb since the parking lot is right there. But once I went there with my friend, we placed our order and were waiting for our food forever, till the waiter comes out and says that the kitchen caught on fire and our food will be right out. We waited and waited, and after an hour we were told no food! Such a disappointment, they could of at least offered us a free meal or something for some other time since we've been patiently waiting for a whole hour. Went there last week, waiter was good, food was good, prices are reasonable. I give it an overall 3 star."
Jawad S.,"SoHo, Manhattan, NY",15,2,,1.0,12/24/2011,"Worst Applebee's I've ever been to! I complained about the beer tasting a bit stale and they said ""that's personal preference and we can't do anything about it"". To not even take the 6 dollar drink back and give the customer a good experience tells me a lot about the quality of this place ."
Irina R.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,17,,4.0,11/12/2013,what I loved the most was Happy Hour!!! I will continue to come here JUST for that the prices were great and the food was nothing to complain about. very pleased with the service and atmosphere.
diana m.,"Brooklyn, NY",135,807,,3.0,7/8/2008,This is my favorite Applebee's. In fact it's the only Applebee's I really like. This is a nice place to come in the summer and sit outside with a good meal and a cocktail.
Baby S.,"Oceanside, NY",0,598,,1.0,8/25/2009,"The place used to be more or less OK when it just opened and we mostly come here because our kids love their mac and cheese and the activity booklet with crayons that they give out.  We went this summer and the first disappointment was that the mac and cheese portion came on a small plate, there probably were like literally 3 spoonfuls on it.  My kids are not big eaters and before, I would order them a single portion which came in a bowl and that would have been a plenty, but this time, I had to order two more portions to feed them.   Turns out that they fooled us and even when we pressed, they kept on telling us that this is the right size.  So, we spent 15 bucks on a plate of Mac and cheese.  The service absolutely stinks.  I don't know why this place is so crowded.  I am never setting my foot in it again."
Joe Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,12,,1.0,7/15/2008,"New to the neighborhood 18 months ago, I made the mistake of going to Applebees on Emmons Ave.  The service is absolutely appalling  I can't get over it.  I seriously thought I was getting Punked.  I wasn't even there on a weekend and it took me nearly an hour and a half to get food and drinks and get out.  If I could rank this Applebees a zero I would.  I ended up going back several times with my wife because she loved one item on their menu but we always dreaded going knowing we'd end up extremely frustrated.  Now that item has been discontinued so we will never have any reason go back.  Thank God!  Save yourself the trouble and go elsewhere!  And forget about the take out.  They can't get that right either."
