Jennifer J.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,22,,1.0,2/16/2017,Waiting for the waitress to take the bill... This review is solely based on the service... My waitress named May her phone rings while taking my order not vibrate ringtone ring she excuses herself and proceeds to walk away to answer her phone awkward... After several minutes she comes back to continue with my order...my appetizer was  spinach artichoke dip it comes and is severely charred like wtf I always get the same appetizer and never had it looking like that I ask for another and she tried to tell me she prefers it that way but if I want she'll send it back didn't I ask for another in the first place smh it goes out comes back I know all they did was stir it and add more cheese on top because when she brought it out the cheese on top wasn't even melted so I mentioned it and she tries to tell me it was changed I'm not stupid but wasn't going to argue so I kept it stirred it  to melt the cheese and enjoy my dip... Moments later my salad comes out I specifically asked for grilled chicken and had the latter so before she could put it down she took it away if it wasn't for the fact that I'd wanted to go to Applebee's for a while just for the oriental chicken salad I would have walked out. I always tip well but for the first time in my life I under tipped I didn't want to feel like a complete douche by not tipping I know servers make their money from tips but I even felt the need to write on the bill terrible service with a sad face because that's the second time I've received such poor service in my life will not be back to this location again.
Annmarie H.,"Brooklyn, NY",34,4,3,1.0,1/2/2017,Worst Applebee's ever! Took 45 mins to get a drink from the bar. 20 mins for my son to get his lemonade  50 mins to get apps. Waiter acted like nothing when I said something. It's not even busy cause then maybe I would understand. This place is really going down hill
Sam K.,"New York, NY",73,9,1,3.0,7/1/2016,It's ok loud  bad annoying music and I have been here twice first and last. I mean the food is pretty good and kind of cheap so it's not that bad.
Allen H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,3.0,12/27/2016,"Came in on Christmas and it was very busy.  Sat at the bar and had a chicken quesadilla, which, most of the time is cooked just right, but it was just  so so this time.  There were a couple of slices where there wasn't much between the tortilla..(just air and the tortilla, where was the cheese and chicken?).  The ladies behind the bar were very busy but friendly and attentive... It's a shame that there is no sound for the tvs but the food is fine and the beer is cold.  If you come in for lunch, sit at the bar and say hello to Carla.  She is always pleasant, personable  attentive and hard working."
Doma G.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,36,35,5.0,4/5/2016,Came here on a Saturday evening. It was packed and the lady said it'll be a 20 min wait but it ended up being 4 mins. We got seated and our waitress Sheresse was super nice and patient. We got the 2 for $20 Riblets and Quesadilla Burger along with the boneless wings. It  was very filling and delicious. For dessert we go the brownie bite which was also very good. Totally recommend this Applebees location. Nice staff and ambience.
Christian V.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,13,9,1.0,4/30/2017,"The worst Applebees in Brooklyn,, The atmosphere is not wrong, they have valet parking which is pretty good, but the waiter that took care of us HORRIBLE. Talk about being a racist KENNETH the waiter, so he gets to the table and just throws ( Literally throws)our appetizer plates on the table does not bring any napkins does not say hello just walks right past us. To a table that got there After us takes their order greets them and then he comes to our table not friendly at all takes our orders in a hurry might I add,, and keeps it moving comes back 5 minutes later brings our drinks   Wrong and doesn't even bring my son's juice,, when we complain he brings back the wrong drink again and does not bring my son's drink still at this point me and my sister are aggravated as hell !! We decide to speak to the manager which was very nice and we decided we wanted another server but after waiting 10 minutes,, we decided to just get up and leave we just couldn't enjoy our meal after getting treated that way.  We decided to go to fridays on Harkness Ave excellent experience try it you wont regret and way better waterfront view!!"
Mei L.,"Brooklyn, NY",40,218,119,1.0,7/18/2016,The food was overly salty. Almost everything tasted like it was a heated frozen dinner. Steak was overcooked. Drinks and salad were okay.
Lewis Z.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",25,2,,1.0,6/22/2017,"I am extremely dissatisfied with the service that I received yesterday at Applebee's. I have been coming here for years and always had a great experience at this restaurant. Yesterday, I arrived with a party of 4 and was seated right away all the way back in the booth by the door on the other side of the restaurant. The table was not clean at all and I got salt on my arms from the damn table. We waited for about 15 minutes and had to flag down a waitress and asked for a server and she responded "" I will get you one, just give him a few minutes"". Another 15 minutes go by and I flag down the same waitress again and asks whats the holdup ? Then she says that the server is coming shortly and I said you said that last time. After a half hour sitting and not being acknowledged, we got up and stormed out of the restaurant. The worst part about this whole fiasco, it was not busy AT ALL. You lost a loyal customer Applebee's. Never coming back EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Alla D.,"Brooklyn, NY",85,8,2,1.0,10/25/2016,"Never eating here again! A week ago I placed an online order to go, I came in and was told it'll only be a few more minutes and to wait at the bar. Twenty minutes later the bartender told me they're packing my food up. Ten minutes later the manager came out to tell me they don't have what I ordered and he apologizes for having me wait 30 minutes. He tells me he'll pay for my dish and will make me anything else I want. He then tells me he'll have it out in four minutes. I ended up waiting another twenty minutes. Having spent almost an hour waiting no one even offered me water. The manager gave me a card for a free meal next time. My boyfriend and I went last night and I have never been more disgusted. The hostess didn't acknowledge us because she was too busy with her head down looking at her phone. I had to interrupt her from whatever else was so important. After we placed our order the appetizer came out great, but our two burgers took over 40 minutes. To make matters worse my side was wrong, and as I started to eat my burger several bites into it I couldn't eat anymore. The burger was Raw. They hadn't cooked it properly and I was completely disgusted. Thanks for making me sick! The restaurant and the team sucks. Because as we were trying to pay I handed my card to the waitress and she came back without it. Luckily she found it, and I understand long night nothing on her BUT worst experience ever!"
Chloe M.,"Gerritson Beach, Brooklyn, NY",19,12,,5.0,10/12/2016,The food was delicious! The servers are very kind and friendly. Always checked back on us to see if we needed anything. Great business and a great location. I would defiantly be back!
Mariclaire N.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,16,3,2.0,9/7/2016,"I come to this Applebee's enough to say that I was  very disappointed in this dining experience. It's like they were trying to be a Japanese restaurant where it would be okay to serve raw fish. Also hate being a pest and asking the waitress to tell the cook to recook the food, when I originally asked for it to be extra well cooked(which was grilled shrimp) and when it came back like the first time it still was undercooked. They only grilled one side of the shrimp and it was still raw. I ended up not eating any shrimp in my dish. Gratefully other then not eating my meal the chocolate lava cake and ice cream was great."
Sally T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,22,8,5.0,8/13/2016,Never can go wrong with this spot! I love sitting in the bar and having Lauren wait on me she's the best! The food is always good and I have never had bad service!
Ju C.,"Brooklyn, NY",219,45,169,3.0,6/7/2016,Got seated outside since the indoor seating area was full. Waited more than half an hour to get served. They only had 1 waitress outside doing the work for serving about 10 tables. This is not the service i was expecting. I've experienced a better service prior to today. Portions are big and filling. They have great deals for entree and appetizer. 2 for $20 and 2 for $27 and 2 sides each for the entree. Definitely filling. Taste is good. My complaint is how they're understaffed and slow service.
Rondell R.,"Staten Island, NY",35,15,4,1.0,7/23/2016,Service was horrible. Took an hour to get wings. the server never checked on us. The food came out cold. Very bad dining experience and I will never dine at this particular applebees again and I will not recommend it to anyone I know.
Katie S.,"Brooklyn, NY",84,15,8,5.0,10/9/2016,"I laugh at all the negative reviews where people complain about the food here, this is Applebees not the Alinea !! Yes your food will be reheated frozen food, this is a sit down fast food type restaurant with a bar. Actually most people come here to eat bar food, drink, and watch games!! Your not going to get filet mignon when you order steak here. But seriously what do you expect when you pay $20 for 2 people? You get what you pay for. Food is good for the type of establishment this is, I've had worse at bars, and the drinks are always strong and yummy! Service is also fast and good! Also their beer battered pretzels are the bomb!!"
Tihia G.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",151,94,76,1.0,10/17/2016,"After a long day at work I came for a bite to eat with my husband and asked if they were playing the Jets game before sitting.  They said yes so we ask  where we can watch the Jets game and order a bite to eat.  Five minutes later the bartender name Rose  came over and change the TVs we are watching to soccer.  I nicely asked my waiter if you could switch our TV back to football and put all of the other televisions on to soccer.  When he walked over to the bartender she made it her business to scream loud enough that she was standing right next to us while she change the channel and we didn't say anything.  Unfortunately we were too busy into the Jets game, however even if I did notice a change in the television I would've waited for my server and politely asked him to put the TV back onto the channel we were watching.  After she screamed aloud so loud her comment I asked for the manager. Whom came over. I left the issue alone.  Continue to try to watch the Jets game but not  even five minutes later she is screaming to her customers using  curse words and constantly using the word retarded. Well I don't have to say any more. Other then I was not even sitting at the bar and this is what I heard. Omg gross."
Dave K.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,31,41,1.0,3/12/2016,A well trained vet could bring the bacon back to life. Everything was over cooked except for the bacon. Pricing is ridiculous. I predict they will cancel breakfast soon.
Danny I.,"Edison, NJ",4,17,15,4.0,8/14/2015,Good service good food. Great place to come watch sporting events with your buddies. Had the chicken fajita can't complain portions are not bad ether for the prices.
Angie W.,"Brooklyn, NY",249,6,16,4.0,4/30/2016,"Came here with my family on a Saturday night. We enjoy Applebee's. This one didn't specifically stick out to us, but it is a go to spot because it is convenient, close by, and it's right by the bay. The wait was not too bad for a Saturday night, it was about 30 minutes long. The food was decent. We got 2 sets of the 2 for $27 dinner and 1 set of the 2 for $20 dinner. For appetizers we got the spinach dip with chips, onion rings, and the hot boneless wings. The onion rings were a little too burnt for our tasting, but the two other appetizers were really good. We got a total of 5 steaks (3 were 8 oz. medium rare, and 2 were 6 oz. medium rare). All of our steaks were cooked to perfection, except my brother's. His was a little too over cooked. We also got the bourbon chicken and shrimp to share. That was tasty. Overall the whole meal was decent. The service was decent. If you ask me, there is nothing that particularly sticks out about this Applebees but it was a overall decent and enjoyable dinner. This is one of our go to spots for celebrations or those once in a while eat-out spots."
Marc G.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,22,13,4.0,4/21/2016,"Food was great scenery was nice, came here late one night with my friends and family and we enjoyed in very much we were seated immediately upon entering and were given awesome full service, I personally felt like eating something hot (I'm not a rapper though). So as we seated we were given our ""books"" and I say books because there were multiple menus and insert and in general it was way too crowded to look at everything all at once, that takes a point away. Simply put it, you can't have an over complicated menu, while it wasn't complicated it was just all over the place especially when you have a few members in your party, Applebee's go fix that! I already finished school I'm not trying to go back just to read everything on there and figure the puzzle of which page or book belongs to which. Thanks.  Now as you finally figure out what you want to eat, you'll come across the awesome chicken poppers, knockers however they may call them, they are hot buffalo wings with the choice to get extra hot so you can burn the flavor right off your tongue. Luckily I saved myself the trouble and went with Mild. Next time... I then ordered the ribs with fries and holy Pigsus (Pig + jesus = no? Okay). These were damn good extremely tender and I love bbq sauce so they had a tangy flover along with a smoke cooked taste to them, they fell right off the bone, I ordered a full rack because I figured it was worth the money. It was..  Pineapple juice all day! Go try this place out it's a nice quick bite right before or after you're about to get f*****d up. Hidden Finder recommends ;) I'm out!"
