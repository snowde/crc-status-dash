Dawn Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,25,7,1.0,1/30/2016,"THERE WAS GLASS IN MY SALAD.  It was part of the green plates all Applebee's have. The manager said they are going to take care of the bill.... The glass was the size of my thumb nail and it cut my tongue, my tongue was bleeding. The server saw the bloody tissue. She quickly took the glass and told the manager to come... But they charged me for the dessert. I didn't get another salad. I wasn't interested in a free meal. But the fact that I could of easily have swallowed the glass, they didn't couldn't take care of the dessert.  Never coming here again and I'd advise everyone the same.  GLASS IN THE FOOD."
Annie N.,"Brooklyn, NY",146,244,674,2.0,11/10/2015,"This is my review for their online take out service, i had ordered the lunch special and it sounded like a great deal 2 for $10 but when i went to pick up my unch i had plain watered down mac and cheese without the chicken tenders so i had to call them up and ask what was going on, the manager said it was an issue with their online system and for some reason it doesn't show up on their system as mac and cheese with the chicken tenders.. hes like we get this issue alot with our customers. HELLO? you get this issue alot and you didn't bother calling to confirm if i wanted the chicken tenders which i paid extra for to be included in my mac and cheese? I had to ask him if he can have the chicken tenders ready for me to be picked up again and waste another 5 minutes walking and 5 minutes waiting for four peices of chicken tender... get your act together! if you are familiar with your lunch specials and you KNOW for the price i paid it comes with it, you should automatically include it instead of wasting my time and yours."
Ricardo F.,"Brooklyn, NY",107,15,4,1.0,4/10/2016,"My 1 star rating is solely based on my most recent experience. Came here to have an early dinner with a party of 5 and oh my god the service was so bad. The waitress is definitely not a person I would ever recommend to anyone I know. As a matter of fact if I ever go back to Applebees I'm not sitting at any table she's servicing.  Her attention span was horrible. Once we placed our order she didn't come back to our table for 20mins..that's crazy. Anyway, when it was check time guess what..... Yup she charged us for things we didn't even order lol.. What a disaster.."
Joshua R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,,1.0,7/15/2016,"I witnessed a worker go in the stall, finish up, NOT wash his hands, and then go in the kitchen. Absolutely disgusting. Avoid this place if possible. I will be calling the Department of Health ASAP."
marina m.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,99,25,1.0,11/7/2015,"Garbage. Go to Roll n' Roaster up the block instead. Food quality is terrible, service is slow and almost non existent, and the prices are not appropriate for this level of crappy food. The lot this sh-t hole is on would make a great condo to improve the neighborhood."
Freddy V.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,267,137,2.0,2/5/2014,Food doesn't taste very good at Applebee's.  If I'm ever in a mood for glorified fast food I will go straight to Roll N Roaster which is straight up the block.  The last time I came to Applebee's the waiter forgot to give me my credit card back.  I had to come back the next day to pick it up.  It also feels a bit dirty here and don't think I will come back.
William L.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,14,,1.0,8/17/2014,"Never again.  Been coming here after work on Fridays for a long time. Been through good managers, stephen and Eddie.  They were adults.  The youngsters calling themselves managers these days are in way over their heads. Wing appetizers - raw. Green Goddes salad delivered without the green goddess and chicken was uncooked again.  Offered free entree.  Chose a burger. 35 minutes later bar tender sent it back because she was unaware the manager placed the order.  Kitchen semed to be in a state of confusion as we witnessed many other unhappy customers calling over the manager.   Sad.  This is close to home and convenient plax e to settle in on a Friday after a long week.  Been in decline for awhile now but finally hit bottom."
Jessica I.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,11,4,5.0,2/22/2016,"I come here often with my family. The food is always great. I love happy hour,  the drinks are delish. This is my go to place; haven't been disappointed during any visit. Sometimes there is a wait but not too long. A++ from me & my family."
Lucia C.,"Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, NY",57,196,14,2.0,6/27/2015,"Applebee's has never been a favorite of mine but this location is strange. They have a lot, but it's valet only. It's an over crowded restaurant and the tables are smushed in to fit more customer I assume. This next part has nothing to do with the location but the food is sub par and I had a stomach ache for the rest of the day. I felt so gross after eating here I won't be back to any Applebee's locations. It's overly processed food, McDonald's is better."
Rob S.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,22,13,2.0,7/29/2015,"Service was great , but the food really sucked . I don't' know if it was because it was busy  but the kitchen really half-assed it , I asked for a medium & I got a rare , I sent it back & I had to wait longer maybe because the chef probably had to kill a new cow & slice the meat from scratch , I don't know . but she stopped by every few minutes to apologize for the wait , she was great unfortunately I lost the receipt before I got the chance to revise this draft & I forgot her name . actually , I had blocked this whole experience from my memory until it was time for me to publish this post  .well,  i'm not going back there anytime soon ."
Salam S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,30,17,2.0,1/18/2016,"Wack !not a fan and never will be, came here more times than i like, i don't know why, service was good but food wasn't really good, I ordered a steak once and it was like a hockey puck and could have gotten a better burger at any other near by restaurant"
Rock L.,"New York, NY",1,11,3,1.0,8/19/2015,There are plenty of other restaurants in a close proximity you should go to. Their French onion soup is terrible and their new attempts at reinventing a hamburger are pathetic. The sign a restaurant is run right is if the bathroom is taken care of as well. The Men's bathroom looked like a bomb had exploded in it. Toilet paper and piss everywhere plus the second stall has zero room and the door does not shut properly. The unsweetened iced tea also tasted weird. The only positive was their mozzarella sticks.
Kai M.,"Brooklyn, NY",77,75,99,1.0,6/12/2015,"The service here is a hit or miss. You may be lucky to get a good waiter or waitress and then there are nights such as tonight where our waitress neglected our table. She failed to remove the used plates, never refilled our drinks and only came around with the check.....really? This is why I dislike this location because of poor service such as this. And let's not talk about the food smh it's fast food and that simply explains the disgusting servings and reheated taste. The lemonade was filled with sugar and utterly disgusting and if not for great company, I would have left!!!! Yeah, I'm not rushing to come back"
Crystine W.,"New York, NY",753,1201,281,1.0,7/8/2012,"This was by far the worst Applebee's I have ever visited and I am shocked that it is still in business.  I should've read the reviews prior to coming here because that would've saved me a lot of trouble.   They offer painfully slow service.  We sat outdoors and there were 2 other tables seated there (although one was leaving).  It took 15 minutes for someone to come over and acknowledge us after we had been seated and then an additional 45 minutes for the server to begin bringing the food out.  If they were busy and I was at a high-end restaurant, I can understand it taking a long time for my food to be prepared.  At Applebee's, these foods are mostly deep-fried, thrown on a plate and then served ... it also didn't help that on my way to the bathroom, I passed a table of at least 10 servers just yapping it up about some DUI one of them recently got.  Our particular server was also careless and gave us the wrong information, first telling us that we wouldn't be charged for something and then later telling us that it would be an additional $8 charge.  We were very thankful to leave as soon as we finished our meal, which also tasted really bland and dry (chicken and potatoes). You won't see any return trips from me."
Ebony C.,"Brooklyn, NY",321,486,86,3.0,3/18/2013,What can you say about a chain that hasn't already been said... Same food and same drinks like any other Applebee's.  What wasn't the same was the service.... super super slow! It took over 20mins for our order to be taken and we were already on a time crunch. We asked for the bill when we got our food and didn't get it until one of us had to go chase down our waiter after our table was cleared.  The sad part is ...there was crowd.. just 2 other tables in her section... lol lol I will only come here again when co workers get together.
Ann W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,12,,1.0,7/15/2015,"Wasn't even going to bother with a review.  I got a gift certificate and went last Saturday for lunch and all three of us ordered a basic cheeseburger deluxe.  The burger was decent enough but the McDonald type fries were less than 20 on the plate.  Definitely not worth $12.50  The wait staff was okay  Gift card was not used because husband paid the tab.  Three burgers, three sodas just about $60.   Went back this evening still to use the gift card and got two sets of the 2 for $20.  Appetizer consisted of four mozzarella sticks, definitely not enough for 2.  Husband said talipia was dry and overcooked. Son said the steak was just as small as expected so no surprise there.   Well the gift card is now gone and so am I.  Definitely will not be going back."
Dennis K.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,1,,1.0,4/22/2014,Lets talk about this bar: Bartenders scoop ice with glasses. What happens if a glass breaks or nips?  Unwanted beer is stored in a cooler in the original glass mug and is served to an unsuspecting customer later on.  Glasses are not clean. Sticky all around.  Beer is not served on a napkins or glass coaster.
Jacqueline K.,"Brooklyn, NY",160,5,,1.0,7/21/2016,"Two days ago, my mother, my 90 year old grandmother, my 8 month old son and I went to this Applebees location for lunch around 12:30 pm.  Upon arriving with my family & my baby stroller with my dozing off infant, the hostess began to seat us.  We were escorted to the back left area of the restaurant where the Air Conditioner was pumping.  There was a young girl and her mother seated next to where we were going to sit, holding her arms and complaining of the cold.  My grandmother said she would be unable to sit and enjoy a meal in that temperature.  The hostess did not offer to turn down the AC but rolled her eyes and escorted us through the restaurant to another area saying that now she doesn't think she has anywhere else for us to sit because of my stroller.  Mind you, OVER HALF of the restaurant was EMPTY!  She brought us to one table and wanted me to remove my baby and put him in the booth sitting beside me, offering to put my stroller outside of the restaurant.  She rudely stated this is the only other option we had besides the cold area in the back.  This experience was unaccommodating & discriminatory.  Having went to the restaurant with a friend of mine about 2 months ago, with my baby in the stroller as well, I know we could have been accommodated in this situation.  We ended up leaving and going to another restaurant that afternoon."
Melinda B.,"Brooklyn, NY",120,82,48,1.0,3/10/2015,"I never thought I would see the day that I would no longer want to come to Applebee's but that day has come.  We came in with our son excited to try the new apps they have been advertising. Of course our son wanted a cheeseburger and fries, so that was his meal. We came in during happy hour so some of the apps are half priced. We knew we wanted to try two of the new ones so we ordered the pot stickers and spin dip from the happy hour menu and from the 2 for $11.99 menu we ordered the brisket sliders and double crunch wings. Now having been here plenty of times before we were figuring between the two of us that would be plenty of food with some left over. Wow were we wrong. All the appetizers are half the size of what they used to be. And the 2 for $11.99 came out and it was two of the smallest plates I've ever seen. We actually thought they brought us the wrong food. So we waited till the waitress came back with the rest of the food and asked her if those were actually the 2 for $11.99 and the full size apps and she said ""Yes, the appetizers are smaller now."" Umm, That's an understatement, miss. I definitely don't see myself coming here for any reason but for a few beers during happy hour cause any meal that will fill you up, they raised the price on and anything cheap will leave you still hungry. Later Applebee's, it was good while it lasted."
Jaclyn C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1087,701,1047,2.0,6/26/2014,"Applebee's - why does this location SUCK so much??? The service ALWAYS sucks. The food never comes out all at once. You ask to lower the AC that is coming out like snow from the vents, and you're ignored. The taste?  SALTY Nothing compares to how this chain used to be in the 90's when it was actually cool to eat here, but you can tell only people with low class come here to drink like there's no tomorrow.  Seriously, it's 2PM; I hope you have a job. I'd maybe think about coming here if I got a coupon or a gift certificate, otherwise, there's PLENTY of better, healthier options to choose from in the area."
