Irina K.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,20,19,5.0,8/25/2015,This place has outside sitting. They are one floor restaurant  They have a small bar area at the entrance. I love getting the shrimp sriracha. Kid Freindly.
Nemesio R.,"Bronx, NY",4,36,8,5.0,8/29/2015,"Love Applebee's.... I had the best burger i have ever had.   It's called the brunch burger.   Burger with eggs,  hash browns, bacon, cheese and it was delicious!  There tap beer is at a perfect temp with the beautiful foam crown and great service"
Darren R.,"Huntington, NY",0,16,,4.0,5/26/2014,"Great place for family and kids. The bar makes a great environment for watching sports and dining alone.  The staff smile often, and are respectable and fun.  The sirloin is my usual order and for 11$ u get an app and desert. They offer a wide array of pretty tropical drinks.   Very sociable with a great view of sheepshead bay."
Kevin G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,13,,1.0,6/16/2016,"Use to be a regular, but over time it change. I went there last night, and my god the place got worst, Seems as if the drinks (RUM) were water down, The draft beer was warm and The food preparation were horrible. Living in the neighborhood and having this location as a convenience. I think I will continue to drive out to Queens and go to Miller's Ale House."
John B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,,1.0,5/28/2016,the foods good service is good but if their is the vallet service turn away or lock everything up and take the key ...
Crystal R.,"Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, NY",1,2,1,5.0,8/29/2015,I am having the all day brunch burger and I have to say it is the best burger I've ever had! Super happy right now! Date night with hubby rocks.
Shahzoda Z.,"Kensington, Brooklyn, NY",20,2,,5.0,10/10/2015,"Love this place! Good service, delicious food, delicious desserts, awsome place. Wanna go back there again and I will soon"
Monsieur A.,"Rocky Point, NY",0,21,1,2.0,10/22/2015,"Okay, this place was horrendous.  We waited for about 40 minutes for our food!  When I finally got my steak it was not the way I ordered it.  I told the server and she came back with it... it STILL was under-cooked.  Not wanting to wait for them any longer, (or get a side of spit with my order) I decided to just smile and nod.   The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of the one it deserves, is because the at least tried to make amends with a small appetizer."
Jim S.,"New York, NY",0,7,,3.0,6/4/2016,Sometimes service is slow but take out is fast. Riblets 2 for 20 is a good deal. I think they have good riblets. Location near the bay is a plus  when waiting.
Janice F.,"Manhattan, NY",575,503,401,3.0,1/3/2014,"Like any other Applebee's, it takes forever. I have nothing really to say about this place other than it's like any other Applebee's. The location is nice though, right across the bay so it's great for dinner and then a walk by the bay during the summer. But honestly, why would you come to a chain restaurant here when there are a ton of local restaurants who I'm sure buy their seafood from the early morning fishermen right across the street? Even it you don't like seafood, roll n roaster which serves fast food, is so much better. Only gave it three stars 'cause I guess I kinda like Applebee's.  But if you're in this neighborhood with this random Applebee's that you can find anywhere else, why would you come here?!"
Bonnie T.,"Manhattan, NY",516,339,355,3.0,6/29/2012,Had a party of 17-18 and was seated within 10-15 mins. Our waiter was friendly and was constantly recommending us appetizers and etc. The portions were fairly big or maybe it was just my dish. I ordered the blackened steak penne which was amazing!  Highly recommended if you were to come to this Applebee's! Con: The bathroom was extremely dirty and the hand soap smelled disgusting! And I asked for a medium steak. My steak came out well-done. Was super dry!
Karen W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,16,4,1.0,7/16/2015,"Two bad encounters in one week! 1st one  My family went on Sunday evening and we were so disappointed.  We order two sodas and she brought one, told my husband she would be right back and after 20 minutes (the first time she resurfaced) he asked where the other soda was.  No sorry, no nothing, just ""oh yeah, right"".  When my daughter's food (kids meal) arrived the it was wrong.  They had given her a different side dish.  They did fix it immediately but to add onto the soda issue, her father was not happy.  We ordered from the 2 for $20.00 menu.  Chicken fingers baskets & Steak.  My food was fine but small but at least there was on food on my plate.  My daughter got more food on her kids meal plate than her father did.  The both had chicken tenders, he had 3 she got 4 with very little fries.   After all of that that when she handed the bill to us, she had drawn a heart over the requested 18% & 20 % gratuity recommendations. Paid and when she returned with the receipt she once again had drawn a heart over the recommended gratuity.  I understand they are kids and are working for the tips but how do you screw up not one but two things and still push for a higher tip. 2nd one  Then last night went to the car pickup and door and it was locked.  Rang the bell 3x's and waited 15 minutes.  When they did open the door the rug would only allow for the door to open enough to put your head and hand in.  For some reason food was at the bar... had to wait again. When she returned with the food, she had to go get a total...had to wait.  Then when I handed her the payment she had to go enter it...had to wait again.  Seems like a lot of waiting.  Wasted an extra 25 minutes because I wanted to have a quick easy dinner for my family.   Somebody should help them get their act together."
Jangkhentsang D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,14,5,3.0,10/16/2013,"I went there with no expectations, and I was not disappointed.  Food as usual is mostly frozen, but fills you up. I get into this mood of having this kind of all American food. Food was huge size with no flavor. Thanks to the Tabasco. It narrowed down the gap. Service was super casual. Staff literally doesn't care but are friendly. I will definitely return because I'm not fussy diner."
Akash P.,"New York, NY",7,25,2,1.0,12/20/2013,I wish I could give this plave a 0. I saw bartenders spitting in the sink. I am indian and I was treated like crap. Not accommodating at all. Food was cold. Steak was raw. Shrimp smelled like pee. Place is a mess. Go there to drink only but watch out for bartenders spitting. I am definitely spreading the word about this place. I never write bad reviewa. I try to only write when a place is amazing but this place is ridiculous. Table has snotty tissue also. See pic
Ery A.,"South Ozone Park, NY",0,2,,2.0,7/12/2015,"We decided on trying breakfast from this establishmen t. Food was good, but service was aweful. Very few tables, not sure why our server was so absent. I ordered a Mexican omlette, but was given a vegetable omlette instead. I ended up eating the omlette I did not order because my server was absent for so long that I couldn't wait any longer, after all I was there to eat because I was hungry. Mistakes happen, I understand however, we finished our meal stacked up our plates and had our server walk passed us at least 10 times and not once did she attempt to clear our table. To my surprise there was a manager on the premises according to the hostess (very pleasant). Never saw him or her and I would assume this manager doesn't frequent the dining area as there was a huge hair ball on the carpet staring at me as I ate. Small details go a long way."
Lauren B.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,20,,4.0,9/24/2015,"Best location.. Been coming here for years, staff is always on top of things, even when they're overly busy."
Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",31,25,11,3.0,10/4/2014,"The thing I like best is the happy hour that goes on for more than an hour, where the appetizers and draft beers are all half price. Its a spot to hang out for a quick bite to eat and a few drinks/ beers."
Joseph T.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,19,8,3.0,2/1/2014,"I love the chicken fiesta salad, great portion snd yhe jalapeño sauce complements the dish."
kathy k.,"Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, NY",60,54,13,4.0,1/14/2015,"Whoa, 20 bucks for two meals plus an appetizer! And the steak is cooked perfectly, comes out hot and seasoned..fries are plentiful..go for the sweet potatoes fries! Broccoli warning, they love this stuff here..but veggies are nicely cooked, even if you hate broccoli! Drinks are measured shots as with most chains, so don't expect great overpours or any comps..but they make sure your glass is full, bring condiments if you sit at the bar..you really can't beat the specials or happy hour here. Great for a cheap lunch out, or happy hour with apps. The staff is friiendly and remember you."
