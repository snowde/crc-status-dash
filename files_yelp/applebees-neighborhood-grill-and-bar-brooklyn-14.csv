Nachi C.,"Brooklyn, NY",408,2,,5.0,10/15/2017,I walked into this place a simple version of myself... and left a new man.
Yvonne B.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,12,4,1.0,12/29/2017,"Apathetic, bad attitudes, awful customer service, SLOW, understaffed, overall POORLY MANAGED.  Once the host finally seated us in the mostly empty restaurant he left us with no menus the ENTIRE time or the high chairs we requested for 2 of our 5 children. I went up to him to ask then he said he would bring them. Then after 10 more mins of no one acknowledging us my husband got up, went to the hostess booth and got them himself.  In the host's defense, he clearly was overworked as a host, server and bus boy assigned to multiple sections. Meanwhile there were literally about 3 female servers who Im hoping were all on break at the same time cause they had NO shame about standing around talkin and laughing.  The booth he sat us in still had the clean-up rag on the table, a dirty saucer and the ketchup rack was on the seat. I ended up moving all of this to a table that had serving trays with half eaten dishes on it.  The waitress who we figured was assigned to that area NEVER once came over to us to.acknowledge us, give us water, or.apologize about the delay. She looked at us several times almost as if our presence annoyed her because she now had more work.  Needless to say after about nearly 20 mins of literally not one person acknowledging us we packed up our 5 kids and left. Not one server who we passed on our way out attempted to ask us what the issue was. So I pulled one to the  .express my discontent. Although she apologized and seemed sincere we felt our complaints fell on deaf ears.  THE WORST!"
Xenia M.,"Brooklyn, NY",130,242,468,1.0,10/8/2017,"You know that feeling when you should listen to all the bad Yelp reviews, and don't go to a restaurant. Listen folks, the reviews for this Applebee's are spot on...take your money elsewhere.  I typically tend not to eat at chain restaurants. However, I couldn't help myself when I saw that Applebee's was doing a promotion for $1 margaritas for the month of October! Boy were my dreams crushed when I found out that this location isn't participating in the $1 margaritas specials.  After waiting 20 minutes, we decided to just eat there anyway. The service was awful. Literally, a bunch of different servers passed us and didn't even take our order for 10 minutes. The manager also has a horrible attitude. Beware people....beware"
Elba A.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,1,1.0,1/2/2018,The shrimp was raw and extremely small. And on top of that it was greasy and not even crunchy like it was supposed to be. It was soggy. I only ate one and I immediately had a stomach ache afterwards. Our waiter was not much better either. This place definitely needs to be shut down.
Steven Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",80,18,98,1.0,12/14/2017,"Ordered delivery from amazon. This location ruined my good memories with Applebee's. When I live in Michigan I used to go to Applebee's for dinner. And it was amazing. But here nah, good luck with who ever owns this location."
Farrah B.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,292,688,4.0,2/27/2017,"I thought I left a review before since I've frequented this location for so many years.  If you are looking for a quiet, g rated, or romantic night out.... this might not be your place.  This is more of a sports bar for locals than anything else, the crowd can be loud sometimes.  After work and happy hour crowds rule the roost, for sure.  This is a fun time place  Days are much calmer, Sundays are filled with the church people hungry after services.  Waitstaff can vary, but most are relaxed and polite.  Food is standard 'bees, consistently good.  Management is cool and the bartenders ROCK!!!!!  Try it out now you know what to expect"
Ibrahim R.,"Vista, San Diego, CA",41,3,,1.0,12/16/2017,"Very fun atmosphere, Terrible service after I ordered it took 30-45 min to get one plate. After I got my plate I finished and waited 30 minutes for my waiter to return which she would of never done if the manager asked if I needed something. Drinks are not great just sodas. When she brought back my change she did not give back the the .65 cents just the 65 dollars. I was scared to ask for something else because I would of waited longer."
Jasmyn F.,"Freeport, NY",1,1,,1.0,12/29/2017,"Unsatisfied with the customer service and attitude of the bartender I dealt with. Came for the enjoyable, chill atmosphere that I receive at other applebees near where I live (Long Island). It is clear the management needs some work."
Dee F.,"Seattle, WA",20,6,6,5.0,9/23/2017,Manager Ken is the great! Everything came perfectly timed! Hungry family of five content!
Skyler L.,"Granada Hills, CA",54,10,6,1.0,6/17/2017,"I'm just going to go ahead and say it: every person working at this Applebee's needs to be fired. Don't even bother retraining the staff, start from scratch and rehire all of the positions. It might even be a better idea just to start a fire and let the building burn to the ground. Living in the neighborhood I've walked past this location multiple times, and I'll admit, every time I go by the place is always popping.  So when I finally went, naturally I assumed the popularity would make sense. Once we walked in, the woman at the front walked by multiple times but didn't seem to notice us or care. We stood waiting for five minutes to even be acknowledged. When we sat down, they didn't have any silverware rolled, and we were instead given silverware in a plastic glass of hot water. ??? I wouldn't even care about such shoddy innovation if everything else wasn't ALSO poor quality. I ordered the Caprese Mozzarella Burger because the photo online made it look very good. However, just as McDonald's flaunts photos of burgers that appear-not just at a standard that meets the term 'edible,' but 'good' dare I say... the food I was given was less than expected on multiple levels. My biggest issue with this is that everyone knows McDonald's advertises burgers but SERVES gray sludge painted to look like food, but with Applebee's? Really? This was by far the most flavorless burger I have ever had the displeasure of eating. I'm certain my napkin would have had a better flavor profile than what I was served. Ever heard of seasoning, Applebee's? For fuck's sake this is a black neighborhood and I'm left wondering who's white ass grandpa you've got chained to the grill back there working for pennies. On top of all of this, I asked for jalapeños to spice up what I expected to be a somewhat mild burger in terms of flavor due to the mild cheese they put on it. That last paragraph was just about the meat. Don't get it twisted, I knew what I was doing ordering a MOZZARELLA BURGER. I digress, the jalapeños took a long time to get to our table, which I asked for upon ordering, and we weren't updated about from our waiter... so I end up sitting there staring at this burger I had taken one bite out of that tasted like the flavorless liquid laxative you get from Walgreen's... watching it cool on my plate. Eventually the jalapeños arrived, RAW, which was disappointing since raw jalapeños also don't have much of a flavor profile as they are simply heat in your mouth, so way to go Applebee's. Then I ask for hot sauce and the only thing they have stocked is TOBASCO. Which, out of all the hot sauces out there, is the worst one. It should just be rebranded as a terrible vinegar. But at this point, I'm starving for both food, and any sort of flavor that my meal could provide. So naturally I drench the burger in tobasco and litter it with the raw jalapeños and start eating. At this point I'm starting to suffer a bit, the jalapeños being very spicy but adding nothing else of value to the meal, and it was too late to do anything other than cringe and recoil at my mistaken liberal use of that tobasco. So I'm downing my water, and where's the waiter to check on us? Probably down in the basement where this Applebee's forces their employees to do trivial laborious tasks during all down time. At least, that's my best assumption based on the vacant mental absence plastered on most of the employees faces. Eventually, I caught our waiter's attention, got more water, and then we had to catch him again later to get the check.  Lastly, the overall prices at Applebee's does not reflect the value you get in service, or food. This entire experience has left me shook. 1/5 would not recommend. But if you must go, I suggest wearing a ridiculous outfit so perhaps the staff will actually pay attention to you. Oh, and bring your own hot sauce."
Brooklyn B.,"Downtown Brooklyn, NY",306,4,1,5.0,10/4/2017,I absolutely love this place! Our server Tamara was UNBELIEVABLE she knew the menu like the back of her hand. She was speedy and always courteous .  She is definitely an asset to that location . I appreciated the smile she wore and her politeness .
Stephen E.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",20,3,,1.0,9/22/2017,"Believe me I wish there was a half star option. Food looked like something drained the energy out of it. No better than a typical Delhi or McDonald's at best. Prices especially were rediculous and presentation/portions looked nothing like the very misleading menu. I would hate to blame an entire franchise for my experience at one spot but the customer service didn't help either. Try Applebee's if you want, just don't go to that branch. Yikes !"
J A.,"Brooklyn, NY",54,55,22,4.0,10/14/2017,"It's been a few years since I last came to this restaurant. Last visit before this was I was extremely disappointed with the food and service. Hence I kept my distance for a spell until the family wanted to go here for dinner. Getting there immediately I noticed a difference. It may not have been really busy but folks were actually working and not slacking off like I've seen previous visits. Hostess was very cordial and our server was very up point on the menu and drinks. Food was a lot better and flavorful and while the original drinks we wanted were sold out, his drink suggestions to compensate kept us going good. Glad to see the workers treat their job with respect and not like a clubhouse. Keep up the good work."
Denisia C.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,9,21,5.0,7/8/2017,"I like to stop buy here after work with co workers, or go sometimes with family. The workers are really  nice; I usually sit by the bar to avoid the wait. I usually try to come on a tuesday b.c pasta night is . The mucho l.i.t that comes with it isn't strong at all though so I end up getting the perfect magarita/pàtron (you can't go wrong with that) ."
Michelle B.,"Brooklyn, NY",14,11,3,1.0,9/17/2017,"Please do not patronize this particular Applebees. GHETTO, . I go in here and had to ask for a menu after sitting twenty minutes. Then I waited about 5 more minutes no server comes over. I asked the young lady the server coming , she says yes walks away. No server another five minutes. There waa only four people in there. Two people walked out along with me and said the service sucks. I walked in and said good morning , no response. The man was standing in the corner doing nothing., but on his phone and talking to a coworker.The mugs were not clean properly . Had stains on them. I really don't even want to give them one star. So very sad. If you are going to have young people working  in your establishment train them better. All Applebees should provide quality service ,not just certain ones.  No matter what neigborhood you are in."
Anne W.,"Brooklyn, NY",148,180,138,2.0,9/22/2016,"This is the worst airport dinner I've ever had and I wasn't even at the airport.  I pass this Applebee's on the way to the grocery store, and recently jokingly suggested to my fiance that we eat here instead of cooking. He agreed. Alright, then.  We were seated in the bar area so that we could take advantage of the all night happy hour specials, which include discounted drinks and half off select appetizers.  He had a $4 Stella and I had a $4 glass of wine that tasted exactly like $4 wine.  We ended up doing the $27 special that came with 1 app and 2 entrees plus another app from the happy hour menu.  Appetizers: The spinach artichoke dip was great, but I've never had bad spinach artichoke dip.  The wonton chicken tacos were also super good. A little sweet from the teriyaki but the slaw on top was really nice.   Entrees: Butcher's Meat and Potatoes -- the meat was overcooked. Like, over over over cooked. The onion rings were extremely greasy. I did enjoy the mashed potatoes and the tomatoes, though.  Sirloin Stir Fry -- once again, the meat was so overcooked. No moisture left, hard to cut. Major disappointment. The rest of the dish tasted like a microwave meal that you settle for because you said you'd start bringing your lunch to work to save money but didn't feel like actually cooking.  The Service: This was actually probably the worst part of the meal. We never received water, it took over half an hour to order, and we received one of our apps after our entrees were half done. They have tablets on the table that allow you to request your server, but our requesrt was ignored for well over 10 minutes."
Alexis M.,"Brooklyn, NY",50,222,3887,4.0,4/17/2016,"In 2016, Applebee's at this specific location provided me and my co-worker with great ambiance, food and drinks during happy hour. We had 5 dollar drinks and half-priced appetizers that hit the spot! In 2017, I have decided to eat a bit healthier and to make more conscious eating choices. Last month, I went to this Applebee's to get some lunch during my work day. The hostess/server was polite, pleasant and helpful as she explained healthy additions to their menu. She was infomed by me that I have to alter my diet and inquiries were made about simply prepared foods. After her carefully explaining and assuring me that I would get my order prepared in a healthy manner, I decided to order Grilled Chicken and Grilled Salmon (1 piece of each) without any sauce or extra seasoning with sides of vegetables. The food was delicious! I thanked her for ensuring that I had such a great and healthy meal option for lunch. I will be back to eat this meal and to also try other healthy lunch and dinners."
Isis A.,"Brooklyn, NY",65,25,1,1.0,5/17/2017,"This was absolutely the WORST service I have EVER EXPERIENCED!!!! From the greeting, the wait to be seated, the wait staff being super slow and forgetful, our food and our cold, children didn't get drinks until close to end of meal, the silverware was brought to the table in a mug of hot water, just crazy! I will never never ever go back there again.  I only gave one star because I had to in order to write review smh!"
P P.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,11,2,1.0,7/29/2016,"Applebee's BedStuy... The service was extremely poor. We waited 45 min for our drinks. When they arrived they were half full, full of ice and not tasty.  We ordered chicken fingers and they came out almost an hour later with just 3 tenders and a child sized portion of fries which were cold.  But it costs $15. The manager was called because the waitress was of no help and she apologized and brought us out another dime sized portion of fries to supplement the 12 we had on our plate. You would think that it was packed to capacity. It was a Saturday afternoon and maybe 12 people were in the whole spot.  We were initially sitting outside but it began to rain and we asked to be moved inside. Again there were maybe 12 people in the whole spot. I'm rounding UP. We still needed to WAIT to find a place to sit. We eventually sat ourselves, and the hostess eventually said we could stay even though that was the section our waitress was working.  The duration of our stay at the restaurant was a hot mess. After repeatedly sending back drinks and food, the manager said she would fix the bill and we still had all the items on the check. Their lack of attention to detail at that spot was extremely poor.  Here's a tip: DO BETTER!"
Darcy L.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,3,,3.0,11/23/2017,My favorite part is the half off appetizers. My friends know we can always come here for a good time and not burn a hole in our wallet
Annalee F.,"New York, NY",112,10,2,3.0,11/30/2016,"This place is decent, the food was mediocre but its a restaurant chain so I didn't expect a five-star meal. The server was very nice and accomodating. . Calorie wise you will absolutely exceed your daily calorie intake with just one meal here, so if you're hungry.. famished and raging for sustinance.. stop by. It's not too far from the A/C train at Nostrand ave."
Genie M.,"Brooklyn, NY",67,290,881,4.0,1/18/2016,"The 4 stars are for the bartender, Messiah.  Went to watch the NFL playoffs. The bar was crowded but he was professional and personable for the four plus hours we were there. The boneless wings and chicken quesadilla were good. My sister ordered a medium steak that was cooked to perfection.. The double fried shrimp were just fried bread crumbs. This item needs to be removed from the menu.  or just call it breaded fried bread-double fried...not a hint of shrimp or they can call it fried shrimp tails...Other than that Happy Hour during the game was happy.  Messiah did a great job. He deserves a bonus, because all the people at the bar were smiling."
Jannu B.,"Brooklyn, NY",182,67,122,3.0,11/8/2015,"Today's my brother 10th year birthday!  It's Applebee's so the first thing that I thought about is, it should be great because it's more of an family dinner restaurant. The food is amazing!!  I had to wait 1 hour for my food! I was getting so upset that I was going to walk right out. unfortunately, I wanted patiently. few minutes the Manager came and gave us all of our items, and apologized for the wait limit. It was really sweet of her.  Food - Great !  Customer service - not so good.  Time - depends on the day."
Julie A.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",173,1,,5.0,7/23/2017,"The service at this restaurant was amazing!! Paris was actually the best waitress that I've had in a long time. She was so sweet & constantly checking on us. The food was great, as typical as most Applebee's, but Paris made our experience so much better!!!"
Monique K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,1.0,9/30/2017,"GHETTO!!!!! I went there with my mom and daughter and we waited almost an hour for someone to come over and take our order. The girls that work there are all ghetto and have nasty attitudes!! I don't live to far from this place but I'll rather go to the one downtown or Flatbush Brooklyn.. the people at those locations are much nicer and when they bring your food out to you they don't have screw faces and your food don't look like they just threw it on your plate. HOW DO THEY EVEN HAVE JOBS AT THE FULTON LOCATION... MORE THAN 1 STAR???.. Issa no for me.. whoever the CEO is, I THINK THEY NEED TO BE ON AN EPISODE OF UNDERCOVER BOSS!!"
Stephenie H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,22,4,1.0,9/13/2017,"Let me start off by saying I don't frequent this location, even though it's in my neighborhood, but decided to stop in to avoid a trip downtown or to gateway. A friend convinced me against my better judgement and man were we sorry. The 1st table we were seated at had a huge rip in the seat, so we moved to the next booth...same thing. I informed the waitress and she moved us to another, which had food on the seat. At this point I'm annoyed and hungry, so I  wipe down the seat myself.  We place our orders and were talking and enjoying ourselves when it dawns on me that we've been waiting for at least 15-20 mins and our appetizer hasn't even come out yet. *there are abt 5 customers, including us, in the place** I'm looking around for the waitress and see a roach!  I go to the hostess station and inform the 3 young ladies gathered there and they seem unfazed. I asked for the manager and Romeo comes from the back and starts telling me about the weekly exterminator visit  No apology, no concern for the roach that's now making his way up the wall, and TMI! I couldn't believe this guy's audacity!  We left...stomachs growling and all. We ended up eating at a popular Chinese restaurant on Myrtle Ave. Get it together Applebees, Bed Stuy deserves better than that!"
Eleanor M.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,17,1,3.0,4/28/2017,"This is probably the first time I was disappointed. I ordered a mango/strawberry daiquiri and it taste like a reg. strawberry daiquiri.My grill steak was good not great but,it was passable. One of my guest ordered a steak with baked potatoe,it seems that they have  run out of baked potatoes Waiting was ridiculous b cuz there were so many tables available but,no one to cover. On a Friday nite this place is usually pack but,not tonite. Idk Applebees it's not looking your best tonite"
Delilah M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",22,7,10,1.0,3/11/2017,"This apple bees was horrible, waitresses were horrible, seating was horrible, When especially you go with a baby sat us by the bar i ask what was on the menu for my son to snack on they took 15 min and then told me they didnt even have.It so we took our family of five home.And ordered Halsey Street Grill and it was Awesome"
Jon Scott L.,"Brooklyn, NY",198,48,4,1.0,5/25/2016,"Probably the worst service I have encountered in a while (I'm sitting here as I write this). The server has yet to come check on us, no drink refills and our appetizer was less than acceptable. Not a happy customer today. Avoid yourself the frustration and don't go here."
Jasmine W.,"New York, NY",138,109,900,3.0,12/4/2015,"Believe it or not, steak lunch for $10!! Not the best but edible. The drinks were pretty weak but I really don't expect much from Applebee's. Highly recommended for cheap eatery and good happy hour(4 to 7). The service is friendly.  Overall : 2.5"
Alania A.,"Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, NY",125,53,24,2.0,1/7/2017,"This Applebee's have got to be the worst. We were seated fast. It took us about 30 minutes to get a waiter. When we did get Alexa or Alexia her customer service was horrible. She didn't leave any napkins. We had to ask other waiters to find her. She didn't come check on us to see if we were okay or if we needed anything. When we finally received our food the order was wrong and the food was cold. When we received our drinks, they came in beer mugs, she said there were no more glasses, and the drinks were horrible. Before we left I ordered another drink and it took about 30 minutes to get. The waiter said to us, imma bartender but I have to be a waiter one day outta the week. Her customer service was horrible. I would rather drive to Gateway Mall instead of walking up the block to this Applebee's. The bathroom was horrible also."
Devonequa N.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",74,3,,1.0,3/10/2017,"The customer service is HORRIBLE!! It took 25 minutes after I was seated for a waiter to come over. My order was taken quickly without compassion. The waiter also had no suggestions on what to drink and seemed to have an attitude when I asked. Once my food came, it was cold and the order was incorrect. The waiter came and took the food back and I waited another 30 minutes for food. I left before it could come. I will never be returning to this applebees."
Vickeisy A.,"South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY",25,32,15,1.0,1/29/2017,"Waited 10 minutes for a table when the restaurant was HALF empty. Whoever is in that kitchen has no idea what the heck a medium steak is... sent it back, waited 20 mins for it to come back to table. Still not medium. At that point I knew the incompetence was real so didn't even bother. It had some pink so i ate the middle half. This place is horrid. Avoid at all costs. Never again."
Francheska C.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,4,,1.0,3/6/2017,Unprofessional . I stood for 30 mins to try to get seated . I stood in front of the guy that takes the names for the table . He was on the phone and didn't have the decency to put the phone call on hold in order to take my name down. I left without putting my name down or being seated . Worse customer service
Monique B.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,29,8,1.0,1/19/2017,I'm so  disappointed. My friends and i have been making this applebees or Wednesday  night hang out for about 6 months now. The bartender Nadeshka was awesome. She was friendly and always made the hell out of our long island iced teas and margaritas. When we got there last night we were told that she transferred to a different  location. The new girl is not so good. She tried  but her drinks were watered down. She was slow. And it took FOREVER to get our food and twice as long to get the check when we where ready to leave.  This transition  was poorly executed. Good luck to the new girl but we have to find a new hang out spot.
Jaael H.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",54,1,1,1.0,3/30/2017,"First and last time at this location. I was looking to having a quick dinner date with my daughter , what I got was the complete opposite. After ordering and drinks, appetizer and entree all at the same time . 15 mins later the drinks came out. 45mins after that our entrees came out ( all that was ordered was burger/fries and chicken fingers/fries ) I asked about the appetizer I had order I was assured it would come out in 5mins . After my daughter and I had finished our our entrees , our waiter was nowhere in sight , no one had approached us to ask us if we were alright, nothing. I stood up and he saw me from far away and says "" sorry, your appetizer will be right out it's going to be super fresh "" i asked for the check , paid and the food still wasn't out . It wasn't till we got restless waiting and decided to forget about the appetizer and just leave that he had come miraculously out of nowhere with the appetizer and didn't say anything about just handed it over as if it was an "" OK"" thing. One look at the appetizer itself I was disgusted and just left it there. Fresh my ass! Terrible time !!"
Jana P.,"Brooklyn, NY",322,221,196,2.0,1/8/2016,"I'm not here to talk about the deals because come on it's a chain restaurant we already know what we're expected to pay. But... This is by far the DUT-TEE-EST (dirtiest) applebee's I've ever been to. I only say that because of the bathroom. I walked in and then I walked out because I thought I was at a dive bar. Also, it took our waitress 15 minutes to come to our table. Granted, once she arrived she was a bit more consistent with her service and the food came out piping hot and delicious. My problem though was mainly with the hostess. It's your job to seat us and let us know that we can indeed order from the table. Once we expressed to our waitress that we were waiting quite some time for her to come over, she seemed quite irritated and told us we could've ordered appetizers and drinks from the tablet on the table. A lot of attitude in the air that I wasn't in the mood to inhale and the service needs work. I can't lie to you though the food was good."
Gigi C.,"East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY",37,79,227,2.0,1/31/2015,"I love Applebee's, I love Long Island locations better because they have superior customer service skills, unlike Brooklyn locations. I came here a year ago and had the worse service ever so I decided to never return. My daughter turned 13 today so she asked if we could drop in and due to frigid temperatures and not having a babysitter, I agreed to come here to give them a second chance.  We were seated quickly, we ordered quickly and our server was ok. He wasn't great because he never checked on us for a refill or to see how we were doing. Now the prices here are jacked up sky high. I was literally in Applebee's 3 weeks ago, ordered the same stuff but paid more at this location $25 more at that.  Our food came out missing sauce for the quesadilla and missing sour cream. My daughters chicken tenders didn't come with a dipping sauce either but we were unbothered by that. We ate our food and they sang Happy Birthday to my daughter which was nice. They charged us $1 for the Birthday Sundae, all other Applebee's give it for free. Clearly this location has no hospitality for their Birthday guest but it's whatever.  As we finished our food, we were given the bill and we weren't finished. Just like any franchise or establishment we visit, we get our full course meal. We had not ordered dessert for my daughters and myself. I told our waiter who did apologize and ripped the bill up and took down our dessert orders and left. He came back 10 mins later with it and it was good. We finished and we were happy, the bill was very high compared to other locations but the service was better this time around. They also make up this menu on their own as they do sell ""Jerk chicken"" at this location only. I can only assume that their prices are jacked up by management and not the franchise in its location alone! Better than our first time here but I won't be coming here again due to the prices on their menu and the changes they have on the menu unlike other Applebee's."
Brandon Z.,"New York, NY",0,12,14,1.0,6/23/2017,"I'm not one to write bad reviews but the service at this Applebee's is horrendous. I walked in the restaurant and waited 20 mins in front for a hostess because no one was at the counter. After waiting 20 mins I got annoyed and asked a server where is the hostess. He said ""she's coming back just hold on a sec"". I continued to wait this is after 20 mins already went by. Then she comes and totally ignores the people waiting. She proceeded to answer the phone and turn her back towards us. The server makes her aware people are behind her where she asks for the name of the party. I tell her the name and she's just staring at me. I was waiting for a buzzer or something like ""please step aside sir we will call you up"". Instead I had to ask her um how do I know when my table is ready. She responded I'll call you when your party is ready. So I'm thinking hey I'm get a table in a few minutes because tables were being clean off and there was empty seating. Instead they had multiple parties wait for 10-20 mins for a table that never had anyone there since we entered the restaurant. At this point I was getting aggravated that there was seating available but they were not utilizing them. I'm not one of those people who think when I entered a restaurant everything needs to be catered to me but this was ridiculous. There was empty seating and no one was being seated. Instead we waited for a booth that was open since I arrived there. The server was okay. His service at first sucked because I told him we don't know what we want to eat yet and he walked away. So I stopped him and said I know what I want for drinks. I ordered a orange soda which was like water. The server later became very prompt on asking if everything was okay and if he could get us anything but by then I just wanted to pay the bill to get out of there. I ordered the lemon chicken with raisin rice. The food definitely wasn't worth it. I took about two bites because the food tasted like a frozen TV dinner. It had no taste what so ever.  I will say this won't be my last time going to Applebee's but definitely my last time going to this specific one."

Thank god the food came out hot or I really woulda been pissed. I had a mango long island ice tea. I feel no buzz. The employees are really nice. They put in work for the tip, so dont forget to tip them. Overall not a terrible experience..........oh shit a fight just broke out 1 star"
