Becky L.,"Brooklyn, NY",103,14,,1.0,9/19/2010,"terrible food, overcooked, cold, soggy lettuce, etc. it's obvious they don't have standards for proper food prep...gross gross gross upside they have a great bartender who has nice tattoos  & oustanding customer service skills...she was the only pleasant part of this establishment."
Debbie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,17,1,1.0,4/29/2010,"This Applebee's is gross, I'm surprised the company or the board of health hasn't shut it down. First my party waited 15 minutes for menus, then waited 20 minutes for the server to take our orders. Was it busy? Yes, if you count loudly talking to your coworkers. After the food was delivered, my friend bit into a chicken finger and noticed it was pink and cool inside- ew. After asking for a new order the waitress returned 15 minutes later with a new bunch of chicken fingers and fries. At least we though it was new until she saw the bite mark she left before..."
Lionel G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,1,2.0,4/26/2011,"No to get rid of the ENTIRE staff except Waiter Name HORACE! He is the friendliest, fast pace working person that ever worked in dat building! He's better than the managers! He needs a seat in corporate!!!"
Jonathan W.,"San Francisco, CA",136,97,1,1.0,1/10/2009,"This Applebee's is around the block and by far the worst. I've ordered takeout and the food was meh.  I always order the same thing:  Fiesta Lime Chicken.  I love that mexi-ranch and bed of tort strips. One day I went with my roommate and her family and was disgusted by how dirty the restaurant was.  All of the tables around us were covered in dirty dishes from previous guests, and most remained that way for over an hour while we were there.  Our waitress wasn't rude, more like apathetic.  They take forever to acknowledge you're there, walking by several times. The food was typical Applebee's.  I'd always defended the food at this restaurant, as I am the only person out of my friends who considers this chain somewhat desirable.  That's changed now. If what Koku below says is still true, half priced apps and drinks, I'll probably go back for that reason only."
Anubis K.,"Brooklyn, NY",75,149,138,1.0,8/17/2011,"Well what can I say about this place, the service is terrible, long waits for something very simple as a burger, they conveniently sat us down at the bar just so we'd buy drinks but luckily I've worked in the restaurant industry before so I know all about these laughable tactics, of course I did not buy anything to drink so from what I observed none of these people even knows the meaning of being a mixologist, there was quite a lot of flies, the bar area was very dirty and sticky, all of the girls were wearing very revealing clothing but yet I could see anyone that was even remotely cute or at least half passable, they were all out of shape with their excess belly fat hanging over their extremely tight pants, waited 45 minutes for my food to arrive, when their is a standard knowledge that if a person is not staying their food has to be expedited and given preference over seated guest ho are buying drinks but yet for odd reason they choose to do it a bit different here, hosted obviously told the kitchen to hold food as a for of punishment, but not surprisingly just as I was about leave she rushes in the back gets the food comes back smiling and saying see I went all the way in to get it just for you, I said well that's great but do not for a minute assume that you are getting any tip, boy did she get really angry :) the burger was very cold and not enjoyable at all since the bun was already hardened only ate because of hunger and feeling lazy to get in the kitchen today as far as i am concerned everyone here needs to be fired should have never been hired to begin with in the first place they're all very lazy and disgusting does not seem they've been anything about wasting your hands after using the toilet the one bartender was changing from her work attire and shows all the while she was busy serving over filled beer a number people had to shout and yell in order to get some service the other bartender was scratching her ass and brushing her hair as well as chewing on gum right over the shot she was making for another lady then they have these two security guards men that quite in my opinion really do not serve any purpose as they are not armed with any sort of weaponry so if they are trying to deter an armed robbery they've failed in that task some the staff became very angry because my cousin was laughing about the poor level of service or I should say lack of service but they quickly realized that there was absolutely nothing at all that they could do about it :)"

John E. S.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,23,2,1.0,10/2/2011,"You know, I'm not a big Applebees fan, but my gf and I decided what the hell, lets try it. We're new to the neighborhood, its a chain, tons of black folk like it, we couldn't go that wrong right? Wrong,when we walked in we were greeted by the most inhospitable host of all time, he barely even said hi to us. When he sat us he put us in the first booth, which was fine until we were ignored by our server for the remainder of our time there. We sat for a total of ten minutes without water or even a hello from our server. She tended to every table but ours. The best part was that the machine where you put in food orders was right next to our table, so its not like it was a stretch for her to get to us. To her credit, when she saw us looking around, she said she'd be right with us and continued to tend to other tables in crazily slow manner, almost slothlike. We finally got up after the manager had walked by three times to drop off food to other tables. Not to sound like a bigot or a closeminded jerk but if we were another black family picking up lunch on a saturday we would have at least been given glasses of water. This was probably the worst and rudest experience i've ever had anywhere, i'm never going back, not even for takeout. I'll probably recommed the same for my friends. Bad job Crapplebees of Bed Stuy, I thought u were bigger than that."
Aislinn H.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,56,,3.0,6/9/2009,"It's an Applebee's people not the Taj Mahal.  Applebee's is a big hangover staple at my apartment and as the only place around that definitely accepts cards(lets face it, we spent all our cash on booze) it's a pretty good option.  Fried food, big platters, ginormous glasses of soda.  Sure, the service is crap and the food quality isn't great, but when I need a gallon of coke and a plate of fried goodness to cure my hangover, it does the trick."
Joshua U.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",62,27,3,3.0,12/29/2009,"Slowest service ever. But the food was fine. I mean, it's Applebees. I got exactly what I expected, although I got it really slowly."
Gary S.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,21,3,2.0,2/3/2011,"I went here on a Wednesday around 5 -6 PM was seated at the Bar ,but choose a booth instead because I was with my two brother,Jerome and Aqiyl  a casual night with Brothers only to get a bite to eat, wings and check out the single ladies after-work crowd. The service was prompt the wings good (but not fully cooked I see why they have Dim lights to masquerade the rush on food being not fully done.) at one point we actually had to summons a waiter to find our host who been gone a good hour. The Bar crowd was pretty rowdy and loud but we understood their excitement ,because we was of the same kind before, guys night out no hold bar Next time I'm gonna request extra  crispy but not burnt to get the wings the way I like them. I visit other places in my food travel that stick a thermometer in the cooked chicken and actually cut one open to make sure  that they are done fully before serving to the public. The very last being that I know the business do I must ask for a drink with no Ice, to don't get a drink saturated with Ice to keep the cost down..........."
Koku K.,"Brooklyn, NY",103,219,91,4.0,11/20/2007,"I love this Applebee's!  It's on the corner of Fulton and New York in the Restoration Plaza, and they have a great happy hour special! Monday-Friday from 4-7pm there are half priced appetizers & drink specials, and Monday-Thursday from 10pm - close they have the same specials as the happy hour.  You can't beat sitting at the bar here.  Some days are more crowded than others, but as of late it's been pretty low key.  I'm a hardcore regular lol.  It's hard to stay away from the mozzarella sticks. ;)"
swamee p.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,,2.0,2/16/2011,very tacky service -- Also they're happy hour is inferior to those in white neighborhoods. the food is cold and the wait for service is long...better to cook at home!
