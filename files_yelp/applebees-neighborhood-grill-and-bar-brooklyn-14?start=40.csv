Amber V.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,3,,1.0,6/2/2016,"Horrible experience. Came here for a graduation dinner and waited 20 minutes for water, 40 for appetizers, and over an hour for food. Our appetizers didn't arrive until we were getting ready to walk out and we didnt even get everything we ordered. Never again. I understand there's a basketball game going on, but you cant ignore an entire section of reataurant. Update: It took ridiculously long for us to get our check."
Ashley W.,"Brooklyn, NY",65,42,15,1.0,7/28/2015,"This place is a joke! The service is ridiculously slow and the servers do not take their job seriously. The bar was out of everything.... What?!,?, how could you be out of three of your signature cocktails. All the customers were complaining. It took 30 mins to get our waters.... Another 10 for chips and salsa.  The hostess and melted brownie were amazing I must say.... I know I know a bipolar post..."
Shanice P.,"New York, NY",0,3,,1.0,7/18/2017,"My daughters, cousin, and I stopped in this location for a bite to eat following a festival this weekend. There were several issues here regarding our menu choices that we required the manager to resolve. Because she was so standoffish, and RUDE, all of the issues didn't get addressed. I was able to explain one of our biggest issues, however, to which she reluctantly agreed to give us ""a little off"" of the bill (her words, not mine). This wasn't offered, but had to be requested by us after a detailed explanation of what was wrong. Upon receiving the bill and seeing what ""a little off"" was, we asked for her again to inquire as to if we could just have the entire newly ordered entree removed (it was 15.99, and we were given $10 off). We were all taken aback by a discourteous, reluctant and unfriendly ""ok, I'll take off the $5.99"" before she walked off without another word. The waiter Jabari, was friendly, and tried his best in spite of him being new, and still grasping onto everything. The manager, could have been more approachable in her demeanor, especially knowing that she had a new waiter on the floor who may have required a bit more assistance in making certain that the customer service was sufficiently fulfilled. She was the worst, and made the experience one none of my party will soon forget.  No more Fulton street Applebee's for us!"
Tissy R.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,36,24,4.0,7/29/2015,Haven't  been here in years and on A hot Day like today where i just wanted a good meal and a drink but did not feling like getting on the train why not applebees.

My BF and I got a two for 20 and our waitress was reallly cool and sweet. Deff gotta make it a weekday spot more often especiall for those $6 drinks lol.
Avril G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,1.0,12/22/2016,This establishment is horrible. Their customer service is terrible and the food was a waste. I sat here for 2 hours and didn't get served. Never again.
Nicole R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,,1.0,7/2/2016,"Stay awAy from this location! Horrible service, horrible , HORRIBLE food. Everything was over fried, rubbery, & over cooked. I understand that this is a fast food restaurant, but If I wanted to taste overcooked 99cent TV dinner, I would have purchased one from the local grocery store. If you're not going there for a glass of wine and water, stay away!!"
Scott S.,"Bedford-Stuyvesant, NY",1,14,2,1.0,5/4/2015,"Haha well... 40+ reviews aren't wrong. I'm sitting here now and on average it takes one period of hockey to get a beer and maybe 45 minutes for an appetizer. The waits are very long, and it doesn't make sense because there's plenty of staff walking around. I do see a few tables with food but generally we're all in the same struggle. Dare we order entrees? No... No no no. I always tip... And I don't think it's really reasonable at this point. I could buy a microwave and the grocery store version of the app, set it up, and eat faster than this kitchen serves food. The only reason to come is getting free food, because you certainly can argue that you shouldn't have to pay for this."
Wanda W.,"Brooklyn, NY",291,263,705,5.0,5/27/2015,"Came here to celebrate the start of summer hours at work last Friday  with some Berry Sangria . Lisa was the bartender on duty and she was great, she made sure the entire bar area received their food and had a great energy. Also she made a meannnnnnn Berry Sangria! Best I had from Applebee's. It was a great time and I will definitely go back to the bar."
T W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,,2.0,7/19/2016,"Worst Applebee's ever!! First, it almost always empty so you wonder why the service takes so long. Once we were seated and it took nearly 20 minutes just get drink orders put in. Then another 30 minutes to get our order to us. And they're always out of something - nacho chips, chicken, etc. And don't think about calling for take out. They will put you on hold and forget about you. Go a few more stops to the one at Atlantic Center. The Fulton St location is a joke!"
Marie Annick M.,"Paterson, NJ",146,254,201,1.0,1/17/2015,Just totally hate this place now . Made me sick! Literally. There was no tissue paper in any of the bathroom stalls. The waiter took long to do things..... This location is so crappy . I don't even like chain food and this made me hate it even more .
Giselle R.,"Mott Haven, Bronx, NY",0,8,11,1.0,12/25/2015,"Just came out of this place and let me just say it's way nicer on the outside then on the inside. The bathroom was so disgusting that I just held it in instead, but what was most upsetting was the fact that our waiter christel wasn't attentive to us but as soon as a group of other people came she was very attentive to them, I felt discriminated because I wasn't the same race as them so I wasn't getting the same treatment. I will not be returning to this location."
Youtrish-sha G.,"Brooklyn, NY",43,52,45,2.0,8/24/2014,"If your going to use cash to pay for your meal that would be the smartest decision everrrrrrrr!  Went here for a quick meal with some family members, we had a male server who took forever to return to us after we gave him a credit card to use to pay for the meals. He came back finally looking suspect. Couple hours  later money went missing from the bank account. Best thing to do is use cash if you go there because he still works there. In additional the appetizers took forever to come and the food . . .I was so close of thinking to cancel the whole order. If your hungry eat something first b4 you go there"
Laana B.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,3,,1.0,11/14/2015,painfully slow service.  just to get drinks took at least 20 minutes after ordering (and the place was empty) my chicken was undercooked. I cut into it and blood came out and the meat was raw which was amazing since the food took so long to arrive.  just. plain bad.  the servers are nice.
Kristia B.,"Brooklyn, NY",209,502,139,2.0,1/30/2014,"Thanks to a $25 gift certificate, I decided to grab dinner with a friend. We ordered from the 2 for $20 menu. My meal was DISGUSTING and BLAND.  Here's a description of the meal I ordered...Our juicy grilled chicken breast with creamy au gratin Parmesan sauce. Served with steamed spinach and mushroom & onion rice pilaf. The parmesan cheese which covered the chicken looked as if it was sitting under a hot lamp for too long. The white onion rice pilaf and spinach...major disappointment. It was a healthy meal endorsed by Weight Watchers, but that doesn't mean it should lack seasoning. Two thumbs down... Service was ok, though it took a while before we could receive our utensils. Great atmosphere, seemed to be a busy Thursday night given the growing line of hungry diners at the door."
Olivette L.,"Queens, NY",0,2,,1.0,9/11/2016,"The service sucks, the server is having side conversations so I have to repeat my order. They don't even have the food that is on the menu & after waiting 20 mins then I found out they didn't have my meal. Would never return & would definitely not recommend."
Chunsoon L.,"Brooklyn, NY",566,32,11,2.0,2/15/2015,"Unbelievably slow service, even on a slow Sunday night.  My four year old loves this place, so I have to come here to appease her little appetite. And I do like the food too, or at least the 1-2 things I can order as a vegetarian.  The service is so, so slow. Four waiters just walked by in the time I've typed this, looking for something to do it seems? Still, I must come here for my daughter, grin and grit my teeth without her noticing. Can't ruin her fun!"
Rajeeyah S.,"Brooklyn, NY",60,99,95,1.0,6/22/2014,"This place is superbly disappointing , even for an Applebee's. I've ordered a brownie dessert here for take out, get there on time and still have to wait. Here are my biggest complaints with this location 1. Inconsistent customer service  2. Often slow, long waits as it can get packed during the nights and weekends 3. Food, even for Applebee's is on the lower rung"
Jessie A.,"Union City, NJ",0,3,,2.0,7/12/2015,Asked for the Chicken Fajita listed on the 2 for $20 menu and chicken was the least it had. Almost a tortilla with cheese only. The wait was too long. Chicken tenders tasted like pure oil. Baked potato needed to be cut with a machete. Wasted time and money.
Paola H.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,6,,1.0,10/17/2015,"I always come here with my family but today was just terrible, we decided we are not coming back. It took over 40 minutes to see our appetizer and first set of drinks(soda not even a mixed drink) then when we got the entrée the wrap bread was burned, my husbands burger wasn't well done as he requested and we didn't send it back cause we didn't want to wait until forever to get it back. Overall terrible."
Michelle L.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,8,2,1.0,1/15/2016,"I came here for drinks and appetizers. Granted we miss happy hour We still stayed. I ordered the sampler for $18.99. When it came in an plate half the size I remembered it being and there was an idem missing.When I asked my waiter is this it "" he said ""Yes, there are smaller portions now"". Our drinks where watered down and full of ice. The manger on duty last was bullied and removing everything off the people bill that was sitting behind us. And to top it off there was NO SOAP in the females bathroom. If you're not coming for happy hour and sitting at bar or friend with the manager on duty don't waste your time coming here..."
