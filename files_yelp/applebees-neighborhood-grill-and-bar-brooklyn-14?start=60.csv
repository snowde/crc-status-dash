Tracy P.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,213,292,3.0,5/31/2015,"First time at this location. The staff were mostly friendly and attentive. Kendra was our server and helped me choose a new dish on the menu. The Four Cheese Mac and cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken tenders, with bacon. It was really good, sorry no picture I was that hungry. Things seemed slow but the weight time was not that long. I would return again if I'm in the area."
Maylin S.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,136,154,2.0,6/27/2015,They are slow as hell but the salad if the chef is in a good mood will be on point. The drinks are up and down like their personalities.
Rene N.,"Orange, CA",6,152,52,3.0,6/23/2013,"3 stars for the good drinks & awesome service from Rafael at the bar. 2 star deduction for Nioka, the other bartender with the ugly Winnie the Pooh tattoo on her shoulder to match her ugly attitude. I get it, you're a New Yorker and all but fkn smile, acknowledge your customers and respect your elders. If a 70 yr old woman asks you KINDLY to turn down the music don't be a b*tch abt it. We won't be returning, sadly. I'd rather spend my money elsewhere than face these rude people again. Again this does NOT apply to Rafael, he was the only reason i left a tip. Ps.... Food was good, no complaints. None the less, i'd still suggest going to a ma & pop place over this chain. You'd probably get treated a lot better and spend a lot less!"
Joe R.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,38,,2.0,7/25/2015,This spot has okay food but you have to wait too long for the food.  The wait staff is nice and pleasant.  Skip this place if possible however because there are many other new places nearby that are better.
Anthony G.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,30,25,2.0,6/15/2013,"My advice: skip this one and go to the one downtown, the food here was not good, the wait time was ridiculous, oh and the food wasn't any good."
Demi M.,"New Lots, Brooklyn, NY",4,6,6,1.0,4/26/2015,The hostess have the best customer service. Wait 25 min before I can get a waiter to our table. They are unorganized and take extremely long to bring out just an appetizer
Elaine g.,"Manhattan, NY",8,7,2,1.0,12/7/2015,"I HAD THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE YESTERDAY THANKS TO THIS PLACE.  We waited 15 min for diet Pepsi, Pepsi, and chocolate milk. Waited another 5 min for our entrees. The kids meal for our 5 year old? Not ready yet. (What establishment does not go out of their way to serve the kid first)? After our totally bland entrees have been at the table for 5  minutes, our appetizer came. The server said, ""Oh, the entrees came already?"" in shock. I got a steak, OMG, Hungry-Man from the grocery store would have been better. The baked potato was still hard. After ""dinner"" I took my daughter to the bathroom just as a woman was coming out that looked green. She had just thrown up. I whisked my kid out of there and complained to the hostess that I needed a clean bathroom to go to. The woman just looked at me. For 5 min no one went into the bathroom. Enough is enough, gotta go. I have been turned off Applebee's forever."
Tanya R.,"Brooklyn, NY",378,318,101,4.0,7/3/2014,"This is the smoothest, coziest, most swagnificent Applebee's anywhere. The food is average but the good vibes, and warmth of the staff is exceptional. Best times to dine here are on weekdays during the afternoon hours. Groove to Gladys Knight and Stevie while eating jerk chicken wings (only available at this location), steaks and knocking back a few handcrafted signature drinks. Really cool Brooklyn/Bed-Stuy pics and memorabilia covers the walls. The bar area is a great spot to mix and mingle for the blue collar, after work crowd."
Mandy D.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,3,,1.0,6/28/2014,"1360 Fulton St.                                                                                                                                                   Waitress: Crystal  R                                                                                                                                           06/24/14                                                                                                                                                      Check#9979-280362 I've been a dedicated patron at this particular venue since the opening of it on Fulton St. I was so happy when your franchise decided to open in the middle/low income neighborhood. I felt it was a good step in the direction of better neighborhood. My son graduation was Tuesday June 24th at 9 am. My family and I decided to have a celebratory lunch at this restaurant. Unfortunately this wasn't a good experience for us. Upon entering the building we were met with a foul smell when asked the hostess about it she stated it was chicken but I wouldn't smell it when I'm seated. The smell was so strong as if you were in a meat department. Never the less we continue to be seated due to the fact of pleasant experience I've always had. We were seated at 11:03 but we didn't have our complete party therefore we only ordered Appetizer and beverages. The rest of my party arrived at 11:33 then we proceeded to order our entrees. At 12:27 we still have not received our food. We expressed our concern to the waitress and she said it was coming. After about 10 minutes we asked for a manager. We also asked two other staff members for a manger as well the manger still didn't come out. When I stopped one of the workers his immediate response was your food was coming. At that present moment I felt uncomfortable to consume any food. After 10 minutes and several request for the manger she finally graced us with her presence. We explained the situation and she immediately said you didn't order as soon as you were seated. I answered that was correct but we did order at 11:30 am it is now 12:27 p.m. we should've had our food by now. Then she (Manager) said that the kitchen was backed up. Her whole attitude verbally and her body language was disturbing. She didn't show any type of professionalism at all and I thank God that I wasn't ignorant because it could've gotten very ugly. She wasn't apologetic at all and didn't show any concerned towards the situation. I did request for the food to be bagged up at this time it was 12:45 now. It took another 10 minutes for the food to come out. I did tell the waitress I didn't want the food but yet they bought any way.  The waitress and the manger bought the food out and when I told them we didn't want it the manger sucked her teeth and swung herself around. We had to wait another 10 minutes for the receipt. When we walked out my son notice that the manger gave me a nasty look I mean really. The manger needs to learn better customer service skills. I was disappointed, frustrated and hungry. What a bad way to end my son's graduation. This experience deters me from entering 1360 Fulton St. Applebees as long as she's a manager. I love your food, drinks and came across very nice waitresses and mangers throughout the many years I've been supporting this venue Thank you in Advance  Madeline D. Mother of the graduate"
Gina L.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,17,3,1.0,4/1/2016,"On March 26th, 2016 I made the mistake of having lunch in this God Awful establishment.  I could barely tell the hostess I was dining in because the music was blaring.  The music is entirely too loud and makes for a jarring experience.  Our server was a young lady named Christelle.  She was inattentive and took forever just to bring us water.  I ordered the steak and told her to have it cooked medium.  She returned with our orders 45 minutes later with a steak that could've been a leather shoe.  When we asked her  to take it back she hesitated and told us she was unsure the cook would redo my order.  She then told us to place the steak on a separate plate because of an Applebee's policy.  Christelle told us she could not take my overcooked steak back to the kitchen unless I put it on a separate plate for her. We ignored her and called for a manager instead.  The manger apologized profusely and took the steak back to the kitchen. When we tried to pay for our awful meal and experience Christelle did not know how to ring us up with the automated machine that is attached to each table in the restaurant.   She made several mistakes with our bill and gave herself a 20 percent tip. She didn't know how to fix the bill and started to ask us questions on how to pay the bill.  We had to remind Christelle that WE did not work for Applebee's and WE could not fix the bill.  Again, we had to contact the manager who had to fix our bill. I will never eat at this place ever again.  The food was trash, the service is deplorable, and the music is louder than a club on a Friday night. Don't eat here and if your server is Christelle... LEAVE.  She's slow, inappropriate, and will tip herself very well."
Heresia H.,"New York, NY",0,7,,1.0,9/1/2015,"I ordered the Chicken Tender basket at $15.49 plus tax. The total came out to be $16.86. I ordered it To-Go but it took more than 30 mins and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. I waited patiently for burnt and stale French fries and nuggets. The chicken tenders wasn't even chicken tenders, it was like boneless wings. I also counted my French fries with the total coming out to be 11   I was so disappointed that I wasted my money. They should have charged me for a kid meal. Since restaurants spit in people food  I didn't want to send it back or order something else. Instead, I let the bartender know that I wasn't pleased and still thank her for her service."
Teresa C.,"New York, NY",141,441,1428,1.0,9/9/2010,Horrible!!! Do not come here! First time I have ever tried Applebee's and I am never going into one again. I would rather go to Red Lobster instead - so much better. PROS: -Deal for 2 entrees plus 1 appetizer for $26 - Honey Buffalo Wings (appetizer) was the only decent thing ate from here. CONS: - received an UNCLEAN menu with sticky sauce all over the front page and my hand accidentally grazed - disgusting. They should at least clean the menus before giving it to the customers. - tried their new SIZZLING ASIAN SHRIMP (spicy). NOT GOOD. basically everything was boiled and they dumped the spicy sauce in the middle with a some crunchy pieces on the top. SO not worth the MONEY. I was basically full from drinking water most of the time. - slow service. (took forever for them to give us the food and give us our bills) - We had to pay 17% gratuity for 7 people - that's a lot considering the service they presented us with. I would have never came here if we just couldn't decide where to eat.
Lynette S.,"Boulder, CO",89,7,,1.0,6/3/2014,"My boyfriend and I came here for a cheap meal. Waitress ended up getting his order wrong, his steak was way overdone and tough. Service was all-around awful, the waitress only checked on us twice the whole time and would not even wait for us to answer after she asked, ""How is everything?"" she would just walk away! We waited over half an hour for the check after asking for it TWICE. I know it's Applebee's and because of that my expectations weren't high, but they couldn't even meet my low expectations. Won't ever be back."
Shari S.,"Brooklyn, NY",101,117,66,3.0,8/15/2013,"2 stars for food - typical shitty but cheap food fix (too salty artichoke dip, vinegary wings and i cannot recall the rest) 4 star for service - it would've been 5 if the first hostess we encountered wasn't so incompetent"
Dorace W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,,1.0,6/14/2014,"The service is horrible,  I'm not sure how they stay in business. Don't waist your time!!"
Yansa Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,10,,1.0,4/5/2012,"Horrible service.  Horrible.  Like everyone else, I was seated haphazardly, left to wait interminally, and eventually left without ordering after complaining to a nearby waiter and having another come over - not to take my order - but to tell me that the person who was supposed to take my order was ""coming"".  Well that's nice, but since you clearly do the same job, is there any reasons you geniuses didn't think a better idea was to have YOU just take my order??? No?   :/ And I'm sorry - but I MUST comment on the obnoxious and presumptuous contribution of the reviewer below me.  In case you live under a rock and aren't aware - comments like this: It is like being at an Applebee's where the staff and the customers are from Crown Heights and Bed Stuy.  are extremely rude and stereotypical.  And please don't think that because you were attempting to be vague, that your point didn't come across loud and clear.   I'd venture a guess that you are rarely in bedstuy or crown heights, or recently moved there with all the rest of the new ""entitled"" neighbors I've been encountering more recently.  You don't belong in Bed Stuy.  You certainly don't belong there making judgments about the quality of service based on your personal perception of what the usual residents of the area are capable of in terms of providing a decent service.  There are many restaurants in Bed Stuy, run not by a corporation, but by individuals who actually live in, work in, and care about the community, that offer wonderful service and are made up of all the same ""staff and customers...from Bed Stuy and Crown Heights.""   So watch your mouth, Becky.  If you have criticisms of the neighborhood there's always Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights conveniently priced for people like you.  Bon Voyage!"
Stephanie W.,"Brooklyn, NY",342,156,41,1.0,4/18/2012,"I tried going here one night - the door was locked 35 minutes before their actual closing time. Annoying. Finally ended up going. Service was horrendous. Instead of our waiter telling us all of the wines/liquers they had run out of, we waited about 10 minutes in between each drink, and each time he returned with another reason the bar couldn't make our drinks.  Also, he FORGOT someone's dinner. We ended up sharing our food with our friend because our waiter never put his meal in - and his response was ""Oh, I forgot."" We ended up getting a ""discount"" - but I think my friend would've rather had his food. Needless to say, I may come here for a beer at the bar during a game... but definitely not for food. Ever. Again."
Celina M.,"Dallas, TX",18,67,19,4.0,9/2/2014,"yeah thats right. AppleBees. IN BED-STUY. You wanna get a slice of real Bed-Stuy come through on a Thursday after work about 6ish. its LIVE. Come here to watch a game, soak up come AC with a cheap happy hour + apps. Best spot to hang out in BK for real. Club AppleBee's forever."
Joshua L.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,13,,1.0,10/24/2015,Good is great but service is super slow for not being busy. Won't come back. It is best to find somewhere else
Leonard P.,"Brooklyn, NY",177,189,310,1.0,3/10/2012,"Despite my horrible experience at the Applebee's located in the Atlantic Mall, and oath to never frequent the franchise again, in some quixotic, Groundhog Day-esque fugue, I wound up at another Applebee's. Though admittedly it was not my fault, someone I know in Bed-Stuy wanted me to work on their computer and wanted to eat someplace close first. The other person arrived first and had ordered appetizers. When I arrived 15 minutes later, the appetizers had not arrived. We ordered beers, which took 10 minutes to come - mind you, we were seated right near the bar. I could have brewed the beer faster. Our server gave the excuse that the bartender had to take time to prepare the drinks, How hard is it to pour a beer? The rest of the evening was a disaster: the food took forever to come, with only a lame apology by the manager, with no compensation given due to the problem. The quality of the food was marginal at best. My order for a second beer was never delivered. This restaurant is such an embarrassment to a neighborhood that is being revitalized and finally getting the unique variety of businesses that used to shun this area of Brooklyn. I am forced to at least give one star for my review - which this restaurant does not even earn that..."
