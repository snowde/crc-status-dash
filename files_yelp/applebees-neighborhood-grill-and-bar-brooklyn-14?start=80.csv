Michelle J.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,25,,4.0,8/9/2014,I am so shocked to give this Applebee's 4 stars. I gave lived here 3 years and the service had always been horrible.  Ms. Sabrina provided service that was well beyond my expectations. I may consider coming back. Nicer job
Vana C.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,74,22,1.0,11/10/2011,"Years ago I frequented this location weekly, it WAS the perfect spot to unwind, have a good drink and a decent meal.  I went so often I was on the first name basis with most of the staff. My how things have changed and not for the better.  Since they've been under new management I've had some of the worst dining experiences: I. Went in for lunch and they had NO RUNNING WATER.  Applebees, why are you open and serving people?  How is your staff washing dishes or their hands for that matter? Let's not even think about what's going on in the restroom . . . Completely unsanitary. -exit stage left- II. On a different occasion I was seated by the hostess but waited for my waiter for close to 25 mins without so much as a greeting or acknowledgement. I was so annoyed I left and haven't been back until . . .  III. My visit last week -sighs-  -  The food came before my drink, (that shouldn't happen, ever!) -  My appetizer was burnt. -  I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea and got what can only be described as some sort of overly sweetened carbonated lemon lime soda? -blank stare . . . blinks-  Immediately I call the waiter over and she tells me she cannot exchange my drink but instead she can offer me a shot, for $2. If the LI was short on alcohol I still wouldn't have obliged, the drink was just BAD-- there isn't a shot on this earth that could have saved it. I asked to speak to the manger, explained how horrid the drink was, and he exchanged it as he should have. Honestly I'm pretty much over Applebees in general (I caught a waiter drinking my drink at the Flatbush Ext. location. Then he served it to me. That pretty much turned me off from there as well. . . but that's another review). I try time & time again to support local businesses but I'm done wasting my hard earned money on consistently bad experiences and subpar service."
Kaia Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",88,35,2,2.0,2/21/2014,"Just like it reflects with my two star rating: meh I've had better applebee's. This location by far is the worst of them. I didn't even want to come to this location but my friend insisted.  It was not the spot to be. The service was HORRIBLE!  Our waiter tried and he was so nice, but the service! During happy hour we had to wait for long periods of time before he would come back and ask us if we wanted another round. I only ended up having two long island iced tea's. I couldn't do it anymore. I wanted to get out of there so fast. Didn't care for the crowd either, some were very vulgar and foul mouthed. I would not come here for a date with anyone. This place is very lacking and the manager paid more attention to holding side convos with people instead of making sure everyone was doing ok. This place sucks!"
Kristen F.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,3,,4.0,11/15/2013,"The following is an excerpt from a gchat with my friend Stuart about an experience at Applebee's on 1360 Fulton St. Me: helloooo Stuart: yoooooo sup Me: sorry I didn't make it to out last night. did you guys have fun? Stuart: hahah you'll never guess who we saw there Me: whooo? Stuart: keanu reeves Me: hahahah whaattt Me: Keanu Reeves was eating at an applebee's in crown heights?? Stuart: haha yeah technically i think that area is bed stuy, but yeah Stuart: keanu reeves was eating at applebees in bed stuy, lol Me: did you talk to him? Stuart: noo.. that would be weird. like what would i say Me: What was he eating? Stuart: buffalo chicken wings and mozarella sticks Me: hahaha Me: What did you and Aaron get? Stuart: i got the spicy shrimp diavolo pasta and aaron got a southwest jalapeno burger   Me: Was it good? Stuart: ya it was good. Me: brb... Stuart: k Me: Ok back Stuart: it was weird with keanu reeves there. like the waitress i feel was trying really hard to not recognize it was keanu reeves, to just to treat him like anyone else but the result was it was not at all natural, the way she was acting. Me: You can't act normal if you're trying to act normal. Me: That kind of stuff must happen to celebrities all the time. Stuart: i don't think most people noticed he was there though, like most people were just genuinely interested in their own applebees food or like, thought it was just a guy dining who look liked keanu Me: That's probably what I would think. Stuart: it was def keanu though. the only diners to notice him were these couple of teen boys who walked by and yelled, ""NEOOO! YOU ARE THE ONE!!"""" and he just kind of like grimly nodded at them. Me: Oh man. who was he there with? Stuart: nobody, lol so weird. Me: Awwww. Did he look like Sad Keanu? Stuart: yeah i mean i guess he looked sad Me: no it's like a meme Stuart: oh i've never seen it Me: hahah look it up Stuart: yeah I guess he looked like that. Stuart: the weirdest thing is i looked him up on the internet when i got home to see if he was filming a movie in bedstuy or something, and he isn't. but i also found out on wikipedia that last night was his birthday Me: what Me: Keanu Reeves was eating at Applebee's alone on his birthday. Stuart: yup Me: #bleak Me: Do you think Keanu Reeves is at Applebee's right now? Stuart: i dunno haha he's prolly not at applebees again, do people go two days in a row? Me: Maybe he finds it comforting to eat in the same place over and over again. I feel that way sometimes. Stuart: cooool Me:Do you think he would have felt happier if he'd ordered the spicy shrimp diavolo pasta? Stuart: i dunno, i mean wings and mozzarella sticks are a good choice Me: Good point Me: Do you think Keanu Reeves is at Applebee's right now? Stuart: i dunno lol why do you keep saying that. Stuart: gotta go, lunch timeee Me: Do you think Keanu Reeves is at Applebee's right now? Stuart: no! lol byeee Me: Do you think Keanu Reeves is at Applebee's right now? Stuart is offline.

Messages you send will be delivered when Stuart comes online. Me: What does Applebee's even mean? Me: Like when I think real hard of the word Applebee's, I picture a shiny wax apple with bees hanging out next to the apple, but they would never be bees that sting me, only smile like cute cartoon bees and provide sweet tasting honey.

Messages you send will be delivered when Stuart comes online. Me: I do. I think Keanu Reeves is at Applebee's right now. Go there now. You'll see him. Keanu has unlimited mozarella sticks to share with you and he's going to be so generous with them. He's there waiting for you."
Rodney S.,"Brooklyn, NY",82,3,3,1.0,9/9/2011,"This evening I finally spoke to the manager of this Applebee's.  I gave him the time period at which I had eaten so he could determine which bartenders served me. He offered a sincere apology.  He did not make any promises about the establishment's improvement the next time that I decided to eat there.  He did say that he appreciated the feedback because it would allow him to work with the current staff to mold them or replace them if necessary. He called in response to my feedback so I was returning the courtesy.  Will things change?  Probably not, but at least my voice was heard."
Franchesca G.,"Brooklyn, NY",189,59,10,4.0,10/14/2013,I have been numerous times and this Applebee's has great bartenders and servers. It's near home and easily accessible. Great drinks and food.
Elizabeth B.,"Brooklyn, NY",429,641,144,3.0,1/24/2012,"This is an Applebee's on the border of Crown Heights and Bed Stuy. Coming here is not like being magically transformed to someplace completely different. It is like being at an Applebee's where the staff and the customers are from Crown Heights and Bed Stuy. Tonight, the customers at the bar were having a really good time watching the basketball game and the bartenders were super nice and reasonably attentive. I've had a few notably dreadful experiences here, been treated like my decision to eat at a table at this restaurant is a statement somewhat less drastic than but in the vein of a sit-in at Woolworth's in 1960, but tonight the drinks were strong, the service was good-hearted and a fun time was had by all. Did I have a sticky menu? Well, yes. It's not the Palm. And the food is exactly like food at Applebee's."
Jack F.,"Manhattan, NY",15,4,3,1.0,7/27/2013,"Worst service iv ever had at a restaurant. No alcohol in my long island, and messed up my order. On top of that they were extremely rude about their own mistakes and took it out on me and my friends. Even for an Applebees it had horrible staff."
Janen G.,"Brooklyn, NY",48,71,6,2.0,4/2/2013,"Applebee's is what it is. I went Saturday afternoon for a quick lunch since I had a gift certificate. At first service was great. As the restaurant filled up I saw my server less and less. It took me forever to get my check. This isn't a frequent stop in my neighborhood and once the certificate is gone, I won't be back. There's too many other great restaurants in the area to frequent this basic American fare."
R'Netta V. T. L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,37,,1.0,6/14/2013,"Apple Bee's restaurant Bed-Stuy Fulton street.  Sunday  After 4:25 pm. The takeout service was ok about 15 minutes. Mostly I eat in rarely  takeout.I ordered the Grilled Jalapeno-Lime Shrimp without the rice, red potatoes instead. The description says a generous portion. I peeked inside the bag but did not fully inspect  the food before leaving. I really felt the portion was very scanty, but I did not want to complain in front of a lot of people sitting around. I was very disappointed when l got home & put this childs portion on a small plate. Why put such a small portion in such a huge container. The meal was $16 & change. I gave a tip at the waiting area. I saw no rolls or breadsticks which were not  included. I purchased 4. I will not go back to this location. Downtown Brooklyn gives more for your money. The 1 star is a plus. I was still hungry I'm a person who does not eat a lot in a huge plate anymore. This meal was listed as spicy. I felt it was very bland & missing taste. The shrimps used were medium size reduced to small after being cooked. I was so hungry when I got home. I found some leftovers and was very satisfied.""  Thanks Applebee's"" !!"
Deprina G.,"Bay Shore, NY",403,235,450,3.0,3/24/2011,"i'll make this short and sweet.  I like my hood spots and good food. but his place had people who were waiting for TOGO ordered sitting at tables... while people where standing at the door waitng to be seated.. How about you make a separate waiting are because of this. Our waitress didn't come to our table for a long time because she though we were waiting for take-OUT.  I got my Plate, had a Hair on my carrot.. Katrina was so nice about it and replaced it because I was 2seconds from going off only because.. while she was taking my order some lady and all her kids and aunties ..yelled OUT...KATRINA"" can you come here..  Like really lady you got to be that Loud and rude that makes no sense. I told My boyfriend clearly this is why we Never come to this one in Bed sty.. we always go to atlantic center or BWW's. I wont be back here... Like I always say.. Unless its for DRINKS ONLY!!!"
Laura L.,"Seattle, WA",112,19,9,1.0,3/7/2013,"Just terrible. Waitress complained about having to serve us right in front of us. Handed us off to another waitress (who was sweet but clueless), didn't bring us our appetizer and gave us the wrong drinks...  Didn't complain because it seemed like she had her hands full, avoid if possible!!!"
Joanie K.,"Brooklyn, NY",163,823,27,1.0,11/23/2009,"there are SO many restaurants to choose from in NYC and in this area.. WHY applebees?!  my review is a bit biased bc i was peer pressured into dining here.. so a little disgruntled. it was def a good deal with the 2 entrees for 26.99$ BUUUTTT there are lots of other great deals like 2 pho for 10$. just saying.. My firepit burger was all right. It was a little dry but def packing in sodium. Not sure if it was worth all 1200 calories and an extra hr of yoga. Fries were tasty. Service was lackluster. Example: When we first sat down, I asked if they could re-wipe the table again bc it was sticky. The waitress said ""I've said this three times now. It's the solution we use."" 1. That's def. the first time I've heard you say that 2. WHAT SOLUTION IS THIS?! Sticky = not clean"
Kai-Michelle C.,"Brooklyn, NY",206,84,40,2.0,7/27/2012,Needless to say I really wanted to give this place a great review and this is not my first time eating here. Our waitress was nice and pretty on a positive note. However; I hate it when a picture is displayed on the menu for the dish you order and your meal looks nothing like what the picture suggests.  I was highly disappointed. I also ordered a drink and was skeptical there was any pomegranate flavor added. I am sad to say this will be my last time at this particular Applebee's location.
J G.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,19,,3.0,2/16/2013,I want to support businesses in the community. I have gone here several times. the food's ok. the drinks & the mini dessert shooters are better. I have experienced polite staff & others that did not have a clue about customer service.  The majority of my experiences were plesant. A few years ago on a Mother's day I waited over 35 mins for a salad when other people in my party that ordered hot food got their orders first!  They actually forgot about my order so I cancelled it. Something is wrong with that picture.  I had tea & an appetizer only that trip. The manager. & staff have chsnged a few tines since it opened. I think things are getting a littke better.
Winter H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,,4.0,1/29/2014,"Maybe, i'm the odd ball reading some of the other reviews, but I like Applebee's. I enjoy the food, the prices are decent. As for the servers, can't say I've ever had a problem with attitude or service. And I've gone many times.  Yes, there have been times when a server may have forgotten to bring silverware or forgot what I asked for, but you know something...it's not such an easier job being a server.  I wouldn't want to do it.  I've never encountered a negative attitude.  For the dissatisfied customers, there is always Juniors or IHOP."
Kareemah M.,"Brooklyn, NY",222,2,,2.0,8/28/2012,"my daughter just left Apple bees and she threw up everything in her entire system. She ordered the shrimp basket . So its probably the shrimps. Who knows how long they keep that food back there. I called to let them know, and they said to take her to the hospital!!!! WOW..Like we dont know what to do....!!!! Thanks alot and please dont sell any more shrimps APPLE BEES."
Gisselle H.,"Brooklyn, NY",147,114,57,3.0,4/20/2009,"I was a bit dissapointed in the service of this applebee's...But what more could you expect?Appleebee's is the worst chain restaurant in new york...Forgive me for the word but it's GHETTO..probaly as low as it gets. At least it wasn't as bad as the one in 42nd st,which was a total nightmare... I went here during the day so we did not have to wait long periods of time for a table,the service was horrible.The food was delivered,yet I had no fork or knife.I ordered the steak and it was   I recommend that if you go here,stick to chain type food like buffalo wings and burgers. The drinks were pretty good but everything else was pretty dull."
Melinda W.,"Brooklyn, NY",96,26,16,2.0,1/25/2009,"I really, REALLY want to like this place - it's close to where I live, I totally appreciate Restoration and all that it stands for and I love giving local businesses cash. But, every time I've been here, my experiences were subpar - the food too salty, the drinks weak, the wait staff clueless.  The best thing is to sit at the bar, order standard apps and check out guys who live in the area."
michelle j.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,,4.0,4/24/2010,"Each time i have been there the service is fine, although you might have to seat yourself as the hostess is too busy talking to the servers to bother with you.  After all this is Fulton street, not 5th ave. The food is regular Applebee's, but the ribs were surprisingly good, like falling off the bone tasty... I know, this seems weird, but its true!  also there is a margarita here thats is only 100 calories!!!  This is the sole reason of the 4 star review."
