C.J. N.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",152,8,9,3.0,12/27/2017,"I had two Coronas and my lady had two sangrias but she said they were watered down. I ordered steak with French fries and mashed potatoes. The fries were on point and the mashed was really good. The steak though could have been better. My lady ordered the same except she had broccoli and mashed and she devoured her food, as she always does and even had some of my fries! Overall great place to have drinks and a nice conversation. Food is okay."
Mali H.,"Arlington, VA",15,29,7,2.0,11/10/2017,"Only giving 2 stars because the waitress was extremely nice. Was seated pretty quickly, the hostess was pleasant.  Ordered ""Cedar lemon Grill Chicken"" not only was the food portion small but it was also  very tasteless. I took one bite and couldn't finish my meal. My cousin had blackened Tilapia and that was just as bad. Applebees will never see my face again."
Melanie M.,"Brooklyn, NY",172,286,1175,2.0,9/21/2017,"This place is pretty much as bad as it gets... yet some how I still end up here. Each time I swear it off because my past experience was worst than the last one when I swore it off I still somehow end up here!  This Applebee's is reminiscent of that bad relationship you know you need to get out of but for whatever reason you keep coming back!  I've figured that no matter how much I'm ignored for countless minutes on end, no matter how much the food truly sucks... no matter how truly the waitress and waiters here suck at customer service...  When I'm done with a grueling class or just crazy day... there's no where better to drown my sorrows in cheap liquor and five dollar mozzarella sticks... I know it's pathetic but it's true and I don't need your judgement."
Diane D.,"Brooklyn, NY",230,141,1234,2.0,12/17/2017,"This is just your typical Applebee's. Honestly nothing special about it. It's only not to far for me so I guess it's a plus. There isn't that many bars near that area either. Just a few bars, but have a lot of more competition for places to go get lunch or dinner. Just to save the headache I will go else where unless there is a specific reason, I'm coming here."
Jeremy R.,"Brooklyn, NY",102,4,,3.0,11/11/2017,The appetizers were good prices were good friendly staff fast service.. Nice Ambiance clean surroundings
Joubert P.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,2,,1.0,12/15/2017,So... i asked for steak with shrimp with no mashed potatoes and parmesan cheese and then they gave it to me. Yall need to improve your service cause thats why i gave u 1 star
Andie L.,"New York, NY",32,38,80,2.0,3/10/2017,"I've been here a bit too often for my tastes. The few times, were always in the company of my family. It's a more kid friendly atmosphere than whatever restaurants are in the area. I truly have heavily mixed feelings about this particular location. It's a hit or miss regularly. The first time I came in with my husband and kids, the service was steady. The second time, a darn MESS. The waitress we had was either new (I'd rather have my mind settled and assume she was new) or had given up on working altogether.   The only thing that happened without flaws, were being seated. Afterwards, we were napkin-less with two toddlers. Drinks served-no straws, 45 minutes later, food served -no utensils.  I thought she was joking when she quickly came by are table to ask if the food was fine. At which point I replied that, we were unable to try it. Complete mess. Third occasion, upon entry to a near empty restaurant, my group, my self and a few other patrons were made to wait for a table, even though it was obvious and in plain sight, they had tables. I'm guessing by the slow service, they did not have enough staff to cover the tables. I can't fathom that type of management, but perhaps I'm the crazy one. Applebees is fine, but just don't go with any high hopes of good or bad service from this location."
Saasha G.,"Brooklyn, NY",91,117,352,2.0,5/11/2017,"Mediocre service with good food! I'm always skeptical of going to Applebee's since they are known for bad service yet on a lazy Sunday I took the kids out for lunch. I got a 2/20 for myself and the kids ordered off the kids menu. Either there wasn't enough staff or the chef was slow because the kids got there food first , ate and I still wasn't served. My waitress tried her best to accommodate since she saw I was annoyed and even called the manager who did not bother with anything I was saying. I still left the waitress her proper tip because I could see she tried her best to accommodate me and always kept the lines of communication open on what was happening internally. I will be doing takeout from now on, however"
Elethia M.,"New York, NY",143,180,590,1.0,6/30/2016,"This will be short because we didn't even eat here... we arrived and stood there plainly visibke waiting for the hostess to acknowledge us... but know, she was too busy talking it up with one of the floor managers and never acknowledged use once... so I got tired of waiting and went up to I assume the floor manager because her shirt was different than the hostess, and ask her if they're seating people ... and she simply said we're waiting for a table to clear so we can seat you...  Please note, that no one really likes this applebees because the service has been bad since its opened but it was the only restaurant at the junction at the time so you make due... however, it was a Sunday on Father's Day, there were plenty of tables open but I guess a paying customer isnt worth much I mean in comparison to the riveting conversation they were having at the main entrance... and even if you were waiting for a table was it thar much extra work for you to greet me and tell me you're waiting for a tavke rather than me having to go and oull it out of you... So we get seated and not only is the table wet but the seats are wet... Really!??!!? I waited for this???... and after I go to the bar to get some napkins and wipe down everything we sat for 10 mins with no waiter that came by to help us or even other us a drink... so we got up and walked out, passing the same two employees on the way out and I bet you they didnt miss a beat in that gossip... that place can be someone else's headache... And they have the nerve to post the two years they actually got an award for their service in their front windows... they must've have either made the posters themselves or paid someone off for the award because not even good service exists there!"
Miss C.,"Flatlands, Brooklyn, NY",102,39,27,1.0,10/15/2017,If I could give them no stars I would. This is one of the worst Applebees in all of NYS. The hostesses are RUDE. They seated us and then left us there. Mind you there is not much going on in there. The bar guy tells me we sat ourselves so that's why no one has served us. Ok so now I'm a liar. Ok sweetheart. Unacceptable. So no one served us. I decided to walk out as the same one who sat us told us our waitress was coming. Ridiculous. Don't bother. They change management a lot as well. It doesn't get better.
Eric G.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,13,,1.0,10/31/2017,"This place is the pits. The service is awful. My friend ordered a club soda and vodka, and the server brought him vodka in a shot glass along with club soda separate but without ice. She also had no idea what beers were on tap."
Delano R.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,19,1,1.0,6/27/2017,"If I could leave zero stars I would.  Seating was pretty quick.   However once we sat down the shit started.  Ordered three separate drinks from the bar in successsion...none of them were made.  No mint, no ginger, can't make the other drink for some other reason.  Ordered the fourth and they say well we can make the mule for you.  Worst drink ever.  Super sour.  Bitter gross.   Appetizers were hands down the best thing to happen to me all day!   Just before we finished the last two wings, the server asked us to grab the last couple of wings off the plate so he could clear it.   As for the meals....we were a party of seven....not one meal was edible.  We all got our food around the same time....but that's is when the disappointment rained down on our table...with a might vengance.  Server brought the manager over to swap out my plate....no apology, waited another 25 min and the original server brought out my replacement meal.  No check from manager....just a drop of the food.  I don't blame the server.  Wesley did his best...but I completely blame the manager."
Kevin C.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",32,117,159,3.0,4/27/2017,Im not the biggest fan of apple bees. I came for a quick lunch meal. I was at work. I came with somebody from work who i take care of. He really enjoyed the food. The customer service was great. I came with someone in a wheel chair and they gave us the perfect seating.the food was ok It was made fresh. Im just not into apple bees like that anymore. However my experience here was better than previous times.
K. Supreme C.,"Queens, NY",2,13,20,1.0,1/2/2017,"This place is dirty, slow service and long wait for a table, even when empty. Very disappointed."
Tee G.,"Brooklyn, NY",58,17,,1.0,5/21/2017,Walked in. Table for one. Sat there for 22 minutes with no acknowledgement. Not a glass of water or utensils. Guess they didnt want my money. So i left.
Sha'velle D.,"Queens, NY",383,19,72,1.0,10/14/2017,"Let's talk about false advertisements I came here this evening with my expectations with a party of 6 including myself. What do we expect from Nostrand avenues Applebee's. Let me begin with the false advertisement of the $1 margaritas  after we googled this location and it was stated on Applebee's website that this location specifically had that special. We are told that only Coney Island and upstate new york are offering that. I asked to speak to a manager about this and no one ever came. We decided after such a long drive we might as well just eat anyway. After ordering our meals my friend and I had the 2 for $20 in which we order spinach dip as a appetizer, I had the blackened salmon with mash potatoes and broccoli and she had the chicken tenders with fries. We also ordered a two additional chicken tender orders one for a child and one an adult. The adults were shorted of their chicken tenders by one as if we wouldn't notice. We received all of our appetizers after we nearly completed our entrees. The service was definitely lacking in the effort to satisfy us the customers. I don't think we'll ever return to this location again."
Julie F.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,15,,2.0,10/8/2016,"The food at this place is decent, I suppose the same as at any other Applebee's, but the service, my god, the service. I don't know if they don't have enough employees or what (but then, like... why??), but everything with these people takes half an hour. After you are seated, you have to wait half an hour before someone actually takes your order. After they bring your order they don't check on you, even if it's been a while and you are finished eating.  I was there once on a date, and our waitress passed our table several times without making eye contact - we had to flag her down to ask her to take the dirty dishes away. Another time I was there by myself, I needed to ask my waitress for something, and she just kept walking as I was talking to her! I mean, she turned her head to listen to me, but she didn't stop, and I had to rush the words. Really, are these people trained in customer service AT ALL?? And I suppose basic common sense is not a strong suit with the people who work there, either... Then you have to wait half an hour for your check, then they take half an hour to come back and take your credit card - you get the picture. Once I was paying with cash, and no one even came back to check if I needed change - once again, I had to flag someone down to ask for it. At least twice that I was at that Applebee's I or my date only tipped 10% because the service was just so unsatisfactory. Unfortunately there are very few restaurants within walking distance of my house, and that's the only reason I ever go there in the first place. P.S.: by the way, I once called them to inquire if they have a Sunday brunch menu. The girl who answered the phone did not know what ""brunch"" was. This was an English-speaking young woman. I was astonished that someone in the food industry could be unfamiliar with the concept of brunch, but I guess given the level of service there it's par for the course."
Mike J.,"New York, NY",0,10,,1.0,5/7/2017,"Omg idk what to really say, the food takes forever to come out that's one and the place is really dirty and the menus are really dirty they meet to be washed with hot water or need to to be wiped down"
Issac L.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",12,61,21,4.0,5/7/2017,"Ate here only once back in 2012, I got the food to go but while waiting i ordered a few drinks ... I enjoyed the food once I got home and the alcohilic drinks were surprisingly strong and not watered down garbage like most places. It seems to draw a continuous crowd so it must be a go to place for people looking to dine in."
Marie Ernande J.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,1,,1.0,6/18/2017,"My friend and I walked into Applebee's and we were told the wait is 20 minutes. We said we were ok with the wait.  The wait was 35 minutes long. We were escorted to a table; the booth was wet with water. I wiped it out because I didn't want it to take another 35 minutes. The waiter came to our table to take the order. We gave our order and 10 minutes later he came to ask us what was our drinks. We gave him the order again. He brought the drinks and the drinks had no taste. Our entree came 20 minutes later with no knives uto cut the steak and chicken breast we ordered. When I asked the waiter about our appetizer, he said he didn't know what happened to the appetizer but he's still waiting for the mash potatoes. I was extremely disappointed with the service and the drinks."
Devin W.,"Brooklyn, NY",49,3,8,1.0,8/28/2016,The waiter came to take our order and just walked away. Then my steak was under done after I asked for well done and my guest steak was over done after she asked for well done .. The food was salty and the food presentation was unbelievable ugly .. I will not be back...
Nancy S.,"New York, NY",0,4,1,1.0,5/8/2017,"Went in for breakfast and I was disappointed!!! I've had breakfast at Applebee's in Manhattan and it wasn't bad so while in the neighborhood I though I would give it a try and boy was I disappointed. Service was slow, the coffee tasted like jet fuel. It was so bitter and the sausages were nasty!!!! Not eating good in the neighborhood."
Bob T.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",1,3,,1.0,5/7/2017,The peach iced tea and fire cracker was so good they forgot to make the firecracker and they forgot to make the peach iced tea taste good your restutant needs a upgrade
Nadia M.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,177,598,2.0,8/28/2016,"Went here for a quick bite before dropping a friend to the airport. It wasn't packed, but they were apparently short staff on a Saturday. We weren't seated right away because we were told we would have a long wait with the server. So this defeated my purpose of something quick to eat. We were a group of 4; 3 adults and 1 child. The host picks up 2 kid menus and 2 adult menus. My brother said there is only 1 child he says ""o, when I see someone smaller than myslef I think they are a child."" Not sure if I should take that as a compliment. We ordered margaritas that all taste like virgins. Definitely didn't taste like patron. Drinks took a while to come out some well as the food. I had the double crunch shrimp with fries and the artichoke spinach dip. Chips were stale, and rarely saw my server. Should have just ordered in."
Melissa P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,1,5.0,8/9/2016,"Being a vegan, I am very reluctant to go to some chain restaurants because its hard to accommodate my dietary needs. But I was truly blown away by the patience and attentiveness that I was given today. Donnie, our server, went through the menu carefully and let me know what would be safe for me to eat and when he wasn't sure, he asked his manager Carl. They took their time and also brought out the book of ingredients for each food. After they reviewed it, they let me know my black bean burger wrap will be fine. When I had to burger, it was prepared well and I really enjoyed it. They both then came to check on my mother and I to make sure our meal was going well.  I find such great service is rare and had to take the time to let everyone know what a great experience my lunch t Applebee's was.  Thank you again Donnie and Carl!"
Dwayne P.,"Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",185,54,103,4.0,5/3/2016,"Great food and drinks. Good service, game is on and Heats are playing. Overall good.  One thing I did like. When I came in the staff was friendly and always smiling."
Inka N.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,11,1,1.0,5/25/2016,"Since I have to give a star let the star be for the food that actually tasted good. Service was simply put - a disaster. We came on a Wednesday evening, the place was half empty, we were seated and patiently waited for the waitress. Our patience ran out when the wait hit the 40 minutearl and everybody but was being helped. I finally flagged down a waitress and she was very quick to blame her co-worker for forgetting about us but took our order. The manager came to apologize offer a 10% discount and tell us it was after all the original waitress who forgot. We got our food fairly quick.  Waiting for a waitress to acknowledge us wanting to pay another long wait. When we finally got our check. Not only was there no discount, there were extra stuff added. At that point I started to just laugh because it was past my comprehension."
renje g.,"Brooklyn, NY",250,874,2,3.0,6/7/2015,2 x (cinnamon liquor shot + pint of cider) = crunk city Ask about it
Matthew M.,"New York, NY",88,62,209,4.0,7/11/2016,"Being my neighborhood Applebee's and the go to spot on a slow night, I have to stand by this location. The happy hour is a no brainier with so many apps and drink options at half off. $5 Margaritas, $4 well drinks where? Here!!!! I don't know what all the other reviews are talking about, my friends and I always get great service when we visit. All in all its Applebee's not Tavern on the green. You come, eat,  drink and enjoy company of good people. Folks that leave horrible reviews are probably the ones coming here to order perfect manhattans and 6 month old cured steak cooked to a perfect rare."
Amber A.,"Brooklyn, NY",137,170,59,3.0,3/1/2016,"It's Applebees y'all lol. I come to the bar here in between classes, since school is literally on the next block, to grab an appetizer and a drink (oop) with my classmate. The appetizers are big so I buy them instead of full-blown meals plus it's way cheaper. My issue is that once I bought an order of nachos and the cheese wasn't melted....WAYMENT. Otherwise, I will still be coming here until I graduate haha."
Carlos S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,,1.0,4/16/2017,Service at the place is horrible. Sat at my table for 2o minutes before the came to our table. The restaurant was not crowded and no excuse for us to wait that long to place our order. Management in this place need to improve to work force or the franchise needs to replace management.
Christina H.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,4,20,1.0,4/10/2017,On 4/9/17 I visited my mom. The service was terrible. The food was absolutely disgusting. I told the waiter the French fries were cold and he touched my fries with his hands and took them back. Not sure if they were going to retry them YUCCKKK.. the fried shrimps were given to me oily. NEVER EVER RETURNING.
Frank A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,21,2,1.0,11/23/2016,"Ok, two years later and I have to say, it's not getting any better at this place.  In fact, it's gotten much worse.  Service is stretched to a crawl and remember I said the place was noisy?  Well to avoid the noise and the wait, this time I decided to do take-out. Called ahead so I could just walk in and walk out, but it still took them 15 min to bring out my order (even though I called head and waited the 20min they said when it would be ready.   I brought it back to the theatre and had dinner in the projection booth -- nice and quiet indeed!  BUT then I opened the food.  The steak was as tuff as rubber, worse even, because rubber wouldn't get stuck in your teeth -- I swear, grizzle lodged between every tooth.  The tilapia was OK...broke apart nicely with a fork so that means it was fresh and it was seasoned nicely, although a bit too salty for my taste.  But then come the magic union rings -- they were rings alright, but EMPTY...no onions inside the over cooked-on-the-verge of being burnt -- HOLLOW rings of batter -- no onions. The spinach dip was slimy and had enough salt to make your lips get all puckered...salty raisin lips.  And then there was the tomato basil soup.  Tasty soup indeed, but unfortunately the container was 1/4 full.  I checked the bag...perhaps the top opened in transit and soup spilled out -- but no, not a drop.  While I was looking in the bag, I also checked to see if, hey, maybe somehow the onions fell out of the batter rings (I still can't figure out how you can make hollow rings with no onions inside). While I was pissed at not getting any onions,, I admit I was fascinated on how they did it...like when you are amazed at how a magician does a magic trick!  How they did the quarter cup of soup was not magic...just sloppiness. Aside from this particular take-out, I had gone back for sit-down meal and everything everyone has been saying here on Yelp unfortunately is true -- everything that has to happen once you walk in the door takes a half hour -- to get a waiter, half hour; to get your drinks, half hour; to get your food, half hour; and gawdforbid you need to get something extra, like butter or water...half hour.  Need to get a check so you can get your butt out of there....could even be MORE than a half hour.  I kid you not. That said, I must add that the waiters and waitresses, spread thin as they are, are usually pretty friendly, and that is saying a lot because given how pissed people must get with the long wait times, they probably get more nastiness thrown their way than they deserve.  Complain to management, not the poor put-upon lower level workers.   Yah, so downgraded to one star...like so many other reviews here.  PS...still picking grizzle out of my teeth.  ""And how would you like your steak, sir?""  ""Without the grizzle please."""
Brianna D.,"Flatlands, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,,1.0,7/8/2016,"Okay, I ate here today with my mother, and I regret this decision. We did not have a good waitress. She was not welcoming very welcoming, she messed up our appetizers, drinks, and even the check at the end. If you choose to come here, I would strongly suggest that you ask not to be served by Kethwanes. Seriously, not worth it. She was nice, but not the best server and did not seem to understand when trying to correct her. Most likely won't come back for a long time."
Jess E.,"Manhattan, NY",37,14,11,1.0,8/10/2016,"What a horrid experience. Our food was burnt, the manager never came to speak with us, and we got charged for replacement food (and I promise we only took one or two bites - this was not a ""eat 3/4 of the meal and refuse to pay"" kind of thing). Unbelievable. Never again."
Anabel S.,"Brooklyn, NY",41,1,,1.0,1/14/2017,"Went to the destination on Nostrand and avenue I, the service was the worst,  young lady cleaned the table in front of me and my wife and kids before seating us and the place was empty, guess trying to hook up the server I don't know,  once seated gladly asked for my drinks and a soup immediately once speaking with the server, kids as well as wife asked for appetizers after placing our drink orders, absolutely nothing came, not even water for literally twenty five  minutes, got fed up, rose up with the family and went to BBQ's across the street, where the service was fast. But upon leaving the waitress didn't ask why we were leaving she simply said,  five more minutes sir it will be right out, seriously could have made the drinks.  I will never go back and been turned off to Applebee's completely."
Theresa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,44,10,1.0,9/25/2015,"I came here for the last year about seven times...  I can't any more, the service here is in imaginable !  Whole place is empty but they seat is in the way back ... Waiting and waiting to order . You have to get up find waitress and request whatever you want or else you won't get anything you need.... Boxes, beverages, food, ketchup, anything ... Like what's next should I cook the food too?  Yeah I should cause the most typical items don't even taste like they should or how they taste at different locations... very bland ! ...I'm never returning ... I'll go to Dallas bbq or some other place around here... No one goes out to eat 50$ not even enjoy the food and the service is the worst I've experienced ..."
Y S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,21,,2.0,3/5/2017,"This is I think the worst  applebees in brooklyn.I ordered buffalo wings and the celery that came out with it looked as if it came straight from the ground there's no way that it was washed.The main course was overcooked,dry and not flavorful.I also failed to mention that it took quite awhile to be seated even though the lication was empty and the staff socializing amongst themselves seem to have taken preference to attending the customers . Needless to say I will not be rushing to return here."
Christian V.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,108,,3.0,1/11/2016,"Living in a food city like New York, one can easily become quite snobbish when it comes to chain restaurants - I know I can.  But, is it snobby when you know you can find superior food for the same amount or less elsewhere?  That's what I've never understood about those who rush to chains in this fine city; there are so many great joints where an awesome meal can be had on the cheap.  By the way, I feel the same about many overpriced ""fancy"" joints that really feed the elitists.   Applebee's is always conveniently located near a shopping hub, and typically lures you in because you've neglected to eat; feeling a rumble in your tummy, you survey the land, and\ Voila!, there's an Applebee's.  Each time I've eaten here, I've vowed never to return.  The food often has a not-so-fresh taste, and cleanliness is not a priority for many of the locations.  Needless to say, I never plan on eating at an Applebee's, but it happens, either from aforementioned hunger attacks, or after simply having too many beers at the bar. True to form, after a few hours shopping at the junction, I find myself here, because there really aren't an abundance of places to dine in the area.  Believe it or not, I would consider returning here just because....just because I enjoy it.  It is, in my opinion, definitely the best location in Brooklyn, with the most comfortable (read sensible) bar I've encountered at an Applebee's.  The food, while not the best, at least emerges from the kitchen on clean plates; no scraping of crud before chowing down."
Christelle L.,"Flatlands, NY",18,17,10,1.0,11/2/2016,"So, I usually go to this Applebee's after my classes  or practices end at Brooklyn college, it's decent for a quick happy hour down time. But I went there on a Sunday afternoon with my bf to grab a bite, it was the worst decision I've ever made. Frost they asked us to move from where we were seated, because they needed to make space for a party of 12, which was fine by me and to make it to us the manager even over us free dessert, so I was totally up for it. When we reminded her to let our server know she moved us, she stated that the section we're in isn't the server's section, someone else will take care of us. By the time we moved our server had already gotten our order, so the new girl didn't want to serve us. Something about not stepping over the other server's toe. Totally understandable I used to work in commission. So our server come give us our food. I had shrimp with steamed broccoli and my bf had medium rare steak. Nothing special about the scrimp dish but the steak was not our my bf wanted it, he was like whatever let it go. The whole time we were there no one came to check on us and ask whether or not we needed anything else. None of the servers came back to our tables we couldn't even get a refill on our glasses of water.  I was over it, so I called a random server told her if we could have our check please. 30 min went and gone and no one check, no one, zero customer service. I was so mad that I thought about walking out of there without paying. But as a regular happy hour college student customer I added up our meals n drink together and left the cash on the table. No one even stopped us. I really wished i didn't pay for that meal . I'm only going there for the happy hour drink as usual. Nothing more."
