Yolanda B.,"Brooklyn, NY",166,84,494,5.0,4/2/2013,"I love the fact that this Applebee's is walking distance from my house. It's not real big but if your in the Brooklyn College area and you want to have some drinks,food etc. I would recommend this place. I never received bad service from here."
Crystal T.,"Kensington, Brooklyn, NY",5,16,26,1.0,5/19/2013,"I don't know if I should even give this ONE STAR. First off, the service was poor. It took 20 minutes just for the waiter to come to us. I think we packed ourselves in a table too small consider they never even bothered giving us bigger tables. When our food came, it was just thrown there and OMG my friend had a cup of water. In there was some green plant thing. I don't know about you but, they need to properly clean their cups."
Ana X.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,17,16,3.0,8/3/2012,"I believe service has improved over the years. I remember once when a group of 4 went to dine in and the appetizers (quesidillas and buffalo wings) took 20 minutes to come. In that time our drinks didn't arrive yet. After eating the appetizers and still no sight of drinks we called the manager who told us she was sorry and when we asked to be compensated she told us that wouldn't be necessary as the drinks are coming now. The drinks didnt arrive until our meal did another 20 mins after. I stopped going for a while but recently started night classes at Brooklyn College. So the after class hang out spot was none other than Applebees. We come almost every Tuesday and Thursday. We request happy hour where a select few drinks are 5$. The appetizers are half price which makes it about 4-6$ for each item. Everything else is regularly priced. Food:  The food is hit and miss. With going so often I try many different dishes. Today its great, next week not so much. Sizzling dishes are always a MISS. It's ALWAYS burnt. When I asked the waiter if there's anything the chef can do to prevent burning (after having 3 burnt meals with rubbery rice) he said no. Its a hot plate blah blah blah the chef doesnt set the temp blah blah blah. Apparently some people like the burn. I do not. Service: Some waiters are great and since we go so often we are known by face by a few. There's one in particular that always has a scowl and a nasty attitude. My friend once requested hot water to place her utensils in and his response was ""People who do that are stupid. Hot water wont clean it anymore than it already is. Theres no soap, theres no scrubbing. Do you still want it?"" Seriously!?? She proceeded to curse him out. And where the tip line is on the receipt wrote ""word of the day: tact"" We now avoid him wheneever we go. Wait time is only long if you request happy hour and theres some kind of game for the night. Crowd: You can never control who comes to your establishment but often times I wonder what were these people thinking. Ive now seen a girl at the bar drink so much she projectile vomitted all over the place. Luckily we were done with our meal and left immediately after. People around her stayed put and just avoided the vomit. YUCK!!!! Ive seen girls with their nasty behinds sitting on the bar counter. Ive seen females so drunk and loud ready to throw down at anyone who even glance their way Females being escorted out by friends because they are so drunk A female so out of it after being escorted out she was outside banging on the  glass wall Funny Ive yet to see an out of control male patrton. Ladies get it together!!! Seriously people. Even though there's happy hour its not a lounge or club. Its still a restaurant."
Tenika H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,1.0,4/14/2012,"I'm so fed up with this place giving me bad food. This is my second time getting less than what I paid for. First I ordered shrimp to go, when I got home the shrimp was burnt. Second time  I ordered a fajita roll up all they put inside was lettuce. No pico de galo as it came with on the menu. I had enough with Applebee's sloppy chef I am definitely not spending my money here no more."
Tatesha C.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,24,,3.0,6/2/2012,"The location by Brooklyn College at the Junction. Service was decent. Drinks were good, LOTS of folks, luckily I was a member of a two-person party, so our wait was at a minimum. Nothing to write home about, but it is what it is."
David F.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,5,,1.0,10/29/2009,"We like to go to Applebee's as a treat during particularly hard work weeks. The service, once again, was awful.  Our waitress was very polite, but does it really take twenty minutes to get drinks and take an order? I understand that it's lunchtime and the restaurant is busy, but is that really an excuse for such poor service? The fact that they have a mandatory gratuity for parties of six or more is just insulting given the level of service provided. If that was the extent of the poor service, I am not sure I'd be complaining.  But it continued. We waited over an hour for our food, which is pretty awful because we only get an hour for lunch. People at the tables around us came and left. When our food finally came out, some of the orders were mixed up. We couldn't even start eating together because our food didn't come out at the same time. Each time she brought a dish, the waitress scurried away before even asking if we needed anything else or if everything was satisfactory. I had to flag her down so I could get a little mustard for my burger. A member of our party asked for a refill on his Pepsi; she took his glass and disappeared for another ten minutes. After flagging her down and politely asking about it, she huffily replied that she was ""getting to it"".  But we didn't complain until she messed up the checks. We asked for separate checks and with each one the initial check she brought out differed from the credit card receipt--in one case the credit card receipt had a balance that was ten dollars more than the initial check. It's really hard to believe that Applebee's was voted ""Best Franchisee(sic)"""
Emma M.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,60,18,1.0,1/21/2011,Unfortunately this is one of the only places to eat near Brooklyn college. The service is laughably bad for a not busy restaurant. The food is simply revolting and overpriced. I hope I never have to eat here again.
Alexander A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,1.0,3/30/2013,"Waiter forgot about my table after seating us, then served us the wrong order."
Vana W.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,44,14,1.0,7/10/2013,"At 1 star, I am being generous. The good is not tasty at all. I know it's not a 5 star restaurant but seriously? Seasoning, anyone? Whatever you do, don't by the steak (or should I say the steak-like substance). They need to step it up here. The location in Valley Stream has MUCH BETTER TASTING FOOD, as well as AMAZING DRINKS. Go there instead, well worth the drive."
Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",761,2185,1699,2.0,6/2/2009,Nice big open space right next to the subway. Prices are good but for some reason the standard Applebee's food just doesn't seem nearly as good as a suburban small town Applebee's. The service was pretty horrible and it felt a slightly weird being the only white people in the whole place.
Jonathan A.,"East New York, NY",1,12,,2.0,1/3/2013,"This place is a regular for me because I know people who use to work there, however I'm writing a review based on my latest experience there... plane and simply, You have to have the right waiter...  I in particular had a new waiter named ""Shane"".  If you have Her as your waiter, request a new one or leave.    She was slow at EVERYTHING and will forget about you but will run for your order when she sees you looking around for her to ask her what's taking so long....    Other than that, this place is usually alright."
Sharlene B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,26,,1.0,9/25/2011,"today was my mom birthday so we took her to applebees,big mistake we ordered the 2 meals for $26 my dad had the shrimp basket my mom had the 7oz steak. the appetizer was bone less wigs. the  appitizer cam out quick,but we sat there for 40 min. we were geting fed up,finally a manager came and he said that they did not expect the place to be that crowded and that they only had two chefs back there working. please,thats a lie  i was told by somebody who works there that they are always busy on a sunday. finally the food came,my bacon cheesburger was pink inside, all that time and i get a half cooked burger, COME ON NOW,DO BETTER APPLEBEES. the waiter had the nerve to come outside after us when we left to ask for a tip cause we left no tip. COME ON A TIP AND WE HAD AWFUL sERVICE,,I AM NEVER GOING TO SIT DOWN IN APPLEBEES AGAIN, I AM SAFER ORDERING TO GO. THAT IS MUCH QUICKER."
Sarah K.,"Manhattan, NY",103,282,27,1.0,1/18/2009,"I have been to this Applebee's 3 times since it opened up in December.  The first time was for birthday drinks after class, since it's right next to school.  I got the tiniest whiskey and coke for about $9 and the martini my friend got was equally as tiny for a similar price.  I know we're in NYC, but we're in Flatbush, and I'm sure the rent here is not as expensive as Midtown. The second time I had lunch with a classmate and was hungry enough and desiring a beer enough to let him convince me to go to Applebee's.  Our waiter was very nice, but he was obviously very new to waiting tables.  I ordered American cheese on my burger but when it arrived, it had cheddar.  I was surprised it was incorrect because our waiter seemed to triple-check everything.  Not that I detest cheddar cheese or anything, but it just looks unappetizing when it's melted to me. We asked our waiter after we were done if there was a happy hour, because I thought I heard they sort-of had one from 10pm till closing.  He then told us, oh well it's going on right now, but you have to sit by the bar.  It's half price for certain beers only, 3-6pm and 10pm-close.  I think that's it.  The Applebee's I lived near a few years ago in Boston had half-price appetizers and drinks every night after 9.  I think that's a way better deal. The third time I went with a friend who wanted to try it out, and again I was persuaded to join because I had been at school working for a little too long and was starving.  We ordered off the lunch menu - it is a 'pick a pair' setup.  The restaurant was almost empty.  Our waiter seemed to be the only person waiting tables, however, and it took quite some time for our drinks and our food to come.  I had decided to get soup and the grilled cheese BLT, which comes with chipotle mayo and I asked for it on the side so I wouldn't have like a pound of mayo on my sandwich.  When it arrived, my sandwich consisted of 3 slices of bread, 2 on the bottom one on top, and a regular BLT.  I didn't notice this till after the waiter disappeared and we didn't have the time for me to flag someone down and ask for my food to be redone.  Afterward I explained to the waiter that my GRILLED CHEESE BLT didn't have any cheese on it, and the side of mayo that I got wasn't the Chipotle mayo that it came with.  That was the deciding factor in me choosing that sandwich so I was a bit disappointed.  He then said the cook didn't quite understand him when he put in the order.  I just don't understand how a cook can forget the cheese on a grilled cheese sandwich.  We finally got our bill and had to run out of there, so we didn't make a fuss, but it would've been nice to have the bill reflect that I didn't get what I ordered.  I guess next time I'm in a restaurant I'll have to make sure to get someone's attention right away if my order is wrong rather than just eating what I'm given to save time.   I won't be back at this Applebee's.  It's let me down 3 times.  I know it's new, but 3 strikes and you're out I guess.  I really wanted to like it too, because it's practically on campus.  Well now that I don't want to go back, I'll probably save some $$ by just going to the Halal cart on Campus Rd instead when I need a quick lunch."
K K.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,5,,1.0,5/25/2012,"This place is convenient because I live right across the street. I went there on the 23rd of may 2012, had the Cajun shrimp pasta and went home only to run to the bathroom sick like and dog. All night my stomach was hurting, only to find out that now I have food poisoning, I called Applebee's to speak to the managers to let them know what happened, and today is the 25th of may, and they are still serving that Cajan dish to folks. I won't be back. Good thing my three year old is picky, he only had bottled chocolate milk. He's smart. Thank God"
Lisa C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,,1.0,10/23/2010,"Terrible service!!!!  A large group came in after us and got seated before us.  They were always forgetting something for our table and always had an excuse.  If it was a drink that was missing, it was the bar's fault.  If a dish was missing, it was another waiter that took the dish and served it to a different table.  It took us 40 min. to get a pasta dish with only 5 pieces of ravioli!  It was ridiculous!!!  DO NOT GO THERE!!!"
