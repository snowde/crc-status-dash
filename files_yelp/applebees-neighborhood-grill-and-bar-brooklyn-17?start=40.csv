Lee R.,"Manhattan, NY",29,61,82,5.0,8/26/2015,"Took my kids for an evening out to dinner before shopping. The restaurant was spacious, nice and clean. Our waitress was very pleasant, she kept checking in on us which was appreciated. My kids got the chicken finger kid's meal. They loved them. I think it's great that you can add an additional side for .99.  The waitress suggested that I try the brunch burger which consisted of bacon, onion, fried egg, crispy hashbrowns, American cheese and ketchup. It was delicious. My drink of choice was a frozen strawberry lemade. I can't wait to go back."
Ariel S.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,153,20,4.0,7/31/2015,"Im actually surprised at the low rating for this Applebees, have ya'll  been to the one downtown Brooklyn? That one deserves zero stars. This place does have hits and misses. Sometimes the food sucks, sometimes you get apathetic staff but for the Happy Hour special ALONE, how clean the place looks and the fact that the drinks ACTUALLY have liquor in them makes me quite happy. I like to come with a friend to be quickly seated and make it rain all over their Happy Hour menu and I leave inebriated and quite stuffed like a BOSS!"
Terrie S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,15,,3.0,7/27/2016,"I haven't eaten here and other locations in a couple of years for a variety of different reasons; poor service, salty and or burnt food, long waiting times. But today I actually enjoyed myself even though the salad (Thai shrimp salad) that ordered for my main course was flat. Flat but delicious and fulfilling. I even had some of my sisters artichoke dip which I love. My waitress was attentive, friendly and speedy. I can't say I'll be coming back in the near future but if I have to I know what to get."
Alice L.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,188,873,1.0,4/4/2015,"Came here on a very hungry afternoon with a friend for lunch. The service was extremely slow. There was one waiter who was running from table to table while another one was casually strolling from one table to the next.  My friend and I both ordered the steak sirloin and shrimp. We waited a really long time there from waiting for someone to take our order to us receiving the food, took almost an hour. When the food came, the meat was tough. The vegetables were dull and very bland. The whole plate were drenched in liquid."
Alice C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,6,1.0,5/13/2016,"This Applebee's was probably the worst service I ever had.  My co-workers decided that during spring break we would try to treat ourselves to a nice lunch because we rarely get the chance to do so, especially since we have a very short lunch break.  There were only 8-9 of us, there was barely anyone in the restaurant when we arrived and we ordered fairly quickly...I'd say within 10 minutes of arriving. We expected good food for the amount of time we waited, but that was not the case.  Usually a restaurant would serve you water or drinks right away, at least a good restaurant would.  Some of us ordered soda, I ordered a strawberry lemonade and another co-worker ordered a peach green tea..or some,other kind of mixed drink with no alcohol.  We waited a while, we were talking and the sodas came, but there was no water, strawberry lemonade or peach green tea.  We asked maybe 20 minutes after we ordered the waitress went to check on it.  She said that the bartender had to make it and they were waiting on her.  We waited another 15 minutes and I approached another waiter about the drinks...10 more minutes later, I canceled my strawberry lemonade and the peach green tea.  I don't see any manager on site, so  I called corporate and I kid you not, once they heard me calling corporate, we received water and a pepsi, I canceled my drink and told them to just give me a pepsi if that would make things go faster. The representative from corporate was nice and tried to help, but I'm sorry that did,t do much.  He contacted the manager and the manager came to the table.  I told the manager about our issue and that it was not okay for a restaurant to take 45 minutes to bring a drink. And that we still had not received any food, meanwhile other customers were already receiving their food even though they arrived to the restaurant and ordered later than we did.  The food came about 15 minutes later and the manager said he would figure out the check later.  The bonelss bbq wings that my colleagues ordered were cold.  Another colleague's chicken salad was cold.  My colleague and I ordered steak with broccoli and Mac and cheese.  I said I wanted the same exact sides as in the picture.  We got peppers instead of broccoli and the steak was over done.  My colleague's steak was probably almost double the size of mine and the waitress didn't even ask me how I wanted my steak.  They gave us a side of broccoli, but it tastes like it came from a bag.  Another colleague ordered a cheeseburger with fries, and the cheese want even melted.  I'm not sure whether she asked for no lettuce and tomatoes or not....but there was nothing to dress the burger up. I've never heard of a restaurant just serving a cheeseburger and fries with no lettuce or tomatoes...maybe no pickle and coleslaw, but no lettuce or tomatoes?  Another colleague had to wait an extra 15 minutes for her salmon dish.  She said it was good, but if you just saw what we ordered you'd be repulsed that this Applebee's is even still opened.  The manager wasn't even helpful at all.  He kept mentioning that our group was a big group and saying that the waitress was New.  We argued that if we're such a big party, why would they send us a new waitress to serve our group.  He then said that we should call ahead of time,next time,so he could prepare. It didn't make sense either way.  He even tried to get more business from us By asking if we wanted to have any graduation party since we're from a school.  I was shocked at how he seemed to believe the fault was not with him.  We asked for the check and that took another 10-15 minutes...maybe even more.  Then after we were finally given the check, they only gave us 50% off...the order was not even correct on the receipt, so no wonder the order was wrong. The total came to about $75....we quickly got our money together and no one came to collect the bill...it was probably another 10 minutes or so and then I just got up and gave him the $80.  We should have honestly just got up and left, because that was not even close to a $75 meal. I told him that we should not even have been charged for the sodas and he just nodded his head.  This Applebees should be stripped of their title as a restaurant or needs to be put under new management, because it doesn't seem like the manager cares about their service."
Miri J.,"Scarsdale, NY",2,18,6,3.0,12/23/2015,"I'm surprised that people who know Applebee's are so surprised by it.  The service: it was OK. I mean in a good way comparing to all the reviews i am riding here. I have been eating here for years, and I am used to them, but even comparing it to other restaurants, the service was ok.  They have respectable size of portions, and the food is good (although my friend got food which was a little cold. I had the chicken ceasere salad, and it was good, and got it in reasonable amount of time.  Not 5 stars, but definitely not 1 star. I think that OK is the best way to describe it."
Ana C.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,23,6,1.0,6/18/2015,Terrible service. Terrible tasting food. Completely brainless waitress  My gin tonic was plain gin - zero tonic and I mean zero  My well done steak came out bloody and my mashed potatoes were served as fries. This was the one time I considered not tipping but decided to be the bigger person since it was me after all that decided to go to a crappy place in a terrible Neighbour inside a mall... Never again
Marie Annick M.,"Paterson, NJ",146,254,201,2.0,4/13/2015,"The two stars is because my drink (gin and tonic) which is nearly impossible to mess up, was very good and cheap $7.80 . Which I didn't pay for since I had redeemed a birthday offer . The service was so slow . Imagine my appetizer came after my meal because the staff obviously messed up, and the manager overlooked them doing this . It is so slow , she brought one glass of water to a table of two? Who does that? It took a total of 30 minutes after we ordered to get water , 10 minutes after water for her to return to my table and 6 minutes after that to get the drink I ordered in the beginning . The calculation gives me a headache . It was just so slow . These places are fast food and there is no need to be slow ."
Nadia A.,"Brooklyn, NY",142,222,23,2.0,2/1/2014,"Literally, with no exaggeration 2 dayum stars... A hot mess.... From food being cold to not enjoying a simple burger lol! There is no reason why a chain restaurant cant get it right. However the desert was awesome............... LOL!"
Jorge Q.,"Georgetown, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,,2.0,3/21/2015,Consistently understaffed..  Every busy weekend you will wait 30+ minutes for a table when there's plenty of empty tables around. Staff appears unhappy and stressed. Service of course is severely lacking. Food isn't horrible.. If u can bare the wait.
Shevonne D.,"Metuchen, NJ",13,15,46,3.0,4/21/2015,"Happy Hour service is great! Kudos to the Bartenders Marley and Kevin! Kevin took over once Marley left and he didn't disappoint. Kevin did his job well, as he should. The Margarita was good, too much ice so before you know it your drinking a 'Watered-Down' Margarita. The boneless wings were good as well as as the spinach dip! I'll definitely revisit due to the convenient location!"
Genenne H.,"East Flatbush, Brooklyn, NY",15,9,,1.0,4/14/2016,"Horrible horrible service. Had to call for a waitress entirely too many times. Today is my sons birthday and we requested that they sing to him. Well, that never happened. They forgot to come back to the table and sing and he walked out crying. Imagine an 11 year old so heartbroken because the service was horrible. This may be around the corner from me but I will never spend a dime in there again!"
Alyssa P.,"Brooklyn, NY",614,1079,2515,2.0,9/9/2013,"So here is the problem with Applebees @ the Junction... there is absolutely no sense of urgency in the entire place.  Waitstaff/kitchen is sooooooo slow.   I've been there 3 times now.... being the optimistic gal I am I thought maybe, just maybe it wouldn't be so bad this time around. I was wrong. The most recent occasion took place last Saturday night.  It wouldn't have been my first choice but my guests had been traveling all day and were just in need of food- any food.  So Applebees it is! We arrived around 6pm on a Saturday evening and found a crowded restaurant (as to be expected) and were told our wait would be 20 minutes (ok..) so we headed to the bar and waited it out.  The service we received at the bar was the highlight of the night.  I don't remember our bartenders name but he was just lovely.  He acknowledged us immediately, placed napkins down, and offered up a couple specials.  It only took him a couple minutes to deliver our drinks.  Mine, a jumbo peach sangria, was delish.  We should have just stayed at the bar...  Not long after we finished our drinks one of the hosts came by to seat us.  He led us around the restaurant to a booth and sat us.  But didn't give us any menus.  Hmm, ok.  Fast forward another 10 minutes... we still don't have menus or a waitress.  We so should have stayed at the bar...  Waitress finally arrived, took our drink order, apologized for the lack of menus, delivered menus and disappeared.  After what seemed like a lifetime our food made its way our of the kitchen.  Appetizers up first.  They took a while to arrive but both were good.  The fried green beans are strange but really good.  The boneless buffalo wings were  served on a plate (don't they usually come in a basket?) and I counted 7.  Call me crazy but I'm almost positive that any other time I've visited an Applebees I've gotten at least 10 wings.  I bet the bartender would have given me 10. Our table ordered 3 meals- steak, talapia, and a salad.   The Lemon & Pepper Steak was cooked correctly and was decent in size.   The Oriental Chicken salad came with a good size piece of teriyaki chicken and wayyyy too many almonds - like a whole bag of almonds (overcompensating for something Applebees?)   The Blackened Talapia was forgotten.   So we wait.  and wait. and wait.  The waitress was no where to be found.  When she did surface again she went and sat in the booth behind us for a little visit.   Hmmm ok.  Meanwhile we're still missing a meal.  The whole operation took nearly 2 hours.  No one seemed to care that we didn't have menus.  Waitress was terrible at refilling drinks and was more interested in socializing than serving.   And then our table received their meals in 2 different batches about 20 minutes apart.  So frustrating! My favorite part- when we received the bill my friend looks it over and finds out that the cocktail he ordered was made with Grey Goose.  At no point did he ever tell the waitress he wanted Grey Goose.  Unless specified the bartenders would make a drink w/ the house liquor, right?   So waitress thought she'd be smooth and order up Grey Goose.  Awesome. $18 and 2 drinks later... we left Applebees.   Next time I'll just stay at the bar... or skip Applebees all together and go for pizza."
Charlene G.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,13,1,2.0,3/17/2015,Where do I start ... The check in was quick at the door and not busy evening when it st Patricks day. The waitress took wayyyyyyyyy to long to come to my table and when she did she was looking like she ran a marathon in a green st Patrick day outfit  The young lady took my choice of beverage slap it on the table with syrup dripping from the glass and ran off . She took so long my sis drank her beverage and was eating ice cubes smh finally I stated I just want an appetizer and I going leave.  Yes I waiting 20 mins more finally my food arrives looking like it just came out the microwave  I ate I pay and I left
michael f.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,21,4,1.0,3/26/2016,"poor service. We didn't get waters, only received 3 place settings for 4 people, none of our plates were cleared after each course.. Had to ask the waitress for water refills.. Ordered a coffee but didn't get a spoon to stir.. How much of a tip would you give? Come on Applebee's, where's the quality control?"
Christian G.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,4,13,1.0,7/25/2015,Very bad service ordered with all my friend's did not recieve any for the entire time yet they did.The person serving name was Anjelca.waited like 40 minutes to be exact.never coming back here.
Jamie S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,,1.0,4/14/2016,"Possibly the worst restaurant in America. Bad food, awful service... if you can even get service. Go there on a Saturday night and there's nobody serving food or drink!! What is that? It is absolutely mind boggling. They are the only bar for miles...literally, and they can't serve drinks. There's no bartender!! Unbelievable. Nowhere else in America can this happen. Why does Brooklyn get always get 4th rate crap from these chains?"
Cynthia L.,"Manhattan, NY",186,746,1300,4.0,3/22/2015,"The service is great - the waitress was very patient and kind, allowing my friend and i more time to think about what we wanted to order. She came back several times to check up on us too. However, the wait for food was longer than expected (probably 30 minutes for 2 entrees and 1 appetizer to come out).  My friend and I had the 2 for $26 deal + one appetizer. They're a bit scant when it comes to appetizers. We got the mozzarella sticks and our dish had 4 pieces; I really enjoyed eating it and wished they had more.. :( don't rely on the online applebees menu or pictures. I saw 8 mozzarella sticks, and we only got 4. Pictures are deceiving! I ordered the fiesta chicken something (forgot the name) and my friend had the shrimp and fries. My order came with a woven basket thing under my plate. It felt very authentic and I loved it. The plate was beautifully executed with colorful edible chips, rice, a variety of cheeses on my chicken and a slice of lemon to top it off. My meal tasted absolutely divine - everything complimented each other quite well. The chicken was cooked to perfection - juicy and tender.  My friend's order had fried shrimp, French fries, a small portion of cole saw and a super tiny ketchup dip (which didn't matter because all tables are provided with a big ketchup bottle, so you could add as much ketchup as you'd like). The fried shrimp was good, however the French fries were very stale and dry. It was hard to swallow and digest without chugging down water after each fry. We ended up abandoning more than half of the fries. The restaurant is pretty clean. The plates and utensils are spot on perfect. The booth that we sat in was in new condition and the restaurant itself was on it's A game. They also have a bar for you drinkers out there!  Overall, my experience here was great, I will definitely be coming back!"
Cat M.,"Brooklyn, NY",116,85,185,3.0,10/7/2014,"Service is not bad ! Coming here my friend told me that the service was extremely slow. Majority of the reviews on yelp were negative. But two stars? For a chain restaurant? It can't be that bad, so I tried it out. I came on a friday afternoon and was seated quicky. There was a good crowd. The waiter brought our food out faster then I anticipated. I gave my friend a big AHAH because I proved him wrong. I think they improved since all the negative reviews piled up. Nothing wrong with the food. Liked the seasonal decorations, made it cozy.  A-ok cause it's Applebees. Moral of the story :Try different restaurants despite their star reviews, restaurants change and people have different experiences. Woop Woop :)"
Amy s.,"New York, NY",27,35,4,2.0,10/13/2015,"Hostness was great! She seated me right away and even changed the channel on the TV for a game my friend wanted to watch. However, I waited more than 20 mins and the waitress never asked to take my order. I really just wanted a drink at the bar but all the seats were full. End of the story, the waitress never asked for my order and I left."
