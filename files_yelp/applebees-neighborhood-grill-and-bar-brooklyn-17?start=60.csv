Mel L.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,44,90,5.0,11/10/2014,"Great food tonight. Came here w/ the family, we all ordered steak medium. All 3 steaks came out perfect. Just the way we ordered them. We also tried the chicken wontons which were pretty good..  Chicken wings & mozzeralla sticks were great as usual."
Latoya D.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,29,7,3.0,12/30/2015,"It's Applebee's so I'm sure you know what to expect in regard to food. If you're sitting down to eat the service is better in my opinion than other Applebee's in Brooklyn. Servers tend to be very attentive and friendly. If you're interested in sitting at the bar, ehhhhhh its okay."
Tina D.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,32,6,5.0,1/23/2016,Every Time I come here I leave happy always good service food and drinks I will definitely be returning
Axel A.,"Fort Dix, NJ",3,20,31,1.0,6/16/2015,Horrible service.  I waited 20 minutes for water. I have to say i will not return..... I was going to walk out but was hungry.  HORRIBLE!
Jenn M.,"Milwaukee, WI",128,420,1070,4.0,5/18/2013,"Because our server did a great job very attentive and nice. I took a friend of the family there with her sister for MOTHER'S DAY being that it's close to her and she can't walk very far.  OVERALL the food was not good, I've had better at other applebees. Which sucks because it's convenient"
Joel M.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,5,,1.0,6/15/2016,"If i can give them a 0 star i would. For starters my girlfriend and i used the new technology they have on the table to order our apps. When the server kay came we asked her to check on the apps just in case our order didn't go through, she never returned and another server brought out our apps. So when the apps arrive my girlfriend didn't have dressing on her caesar salad when we put that we wanted dressing. Kay the server comes we tell her can we get some dressing for the caesar and her response was what kind of dressing you want. The servers there are not knowledgeable of the menu. We ordered out entrees and my girlfriends chicken dish came out before my medium rare burger idk how when a medium rare burger takes 8 minutes to cook. I waited 20 minutes for my food when she was already half done with her food. When my burger arrives the cheese was dry as if it was sitting under the hot lamp. This is unacceptable and i will never return there to eat, and I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there."
Chris R.,"Prospect Park South, Brooklyn, NY",252,9,2,3.0,3/17/2014,Service is lacking at times. Happy hour is from 4pm till close mon-Thursday!' Food is decent. Wait staff could be rude at times.
Nicole B.,"Brooklyn, NY",189,278,22,2.0,8/13/2012,"This is a chain restaurant so I don't except much...however, this one compared to the other applebees is the better one.  The food is still hit or miss and sit down service is all about how your server feels that day....which I tip accordingly for:) However, Happy Hour and bartending service is good to me.  I will seat at the bar before a table at this applesbee location.  Also the carry-out service is easy, fast and has been accurate:) Overall if your just starving call for carry-out if you want to seat down go to the bar."
Summer A.,"Manhattan, NY",55,77,89,2.0,4/12/2016,food was cool service could definitely use improvement. they need to designate an area for their patrons who are picking up food to go i literally had a girl hanging over the edge of our booth talking loudly to her friend on the phone about why she was waiting for her food for so long and it was quite annoying my husband and i left shortly after.
Sherry O.,"Glen Oaks, NY",3,2,,5.0,8/18/2015,"Portion sizes are on point and waiter/waitress attends to you quite promptly and are very kind, patient, and understanding. Great service and even better food"
Latoya W.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,30,2,2.0,3/3/2014,"1) It took 35 mins for my food to come, 2) The food wasnt savory, 3) The appetizer had the ""fresh out of the microwave"" taste. 4) it was awful."
Michelle D.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,61,,1.0,9/3/2015,"Please dont go here.  Table was dirty and sticky. Waiting 20 minutes for a starting drink. Bug in our food. They brought us a new order waaaaay too fast which means they just re-plated the same food... (cause we waited the first time for about 25 mins)  Sandwich was ABSOLUTELY disgusting. I couldnt eat it cause it tasted like dirty feet.  The staff talk between each other/communicate super ghetto. ANYWAYS, please avoid going here at all costs. Only positive thing is that the manager was nice. But thats about it."
Gwen B.,"Brooklyn, NY",50,12,16,1.0,1/25/2014,"This place never disappoints to disappoint!  Tepid grilled cheese sandwich. 10 quid for a tepid grilled cheese sandwich?  Terrible margarita. 11 quid for a subpar margarita. My man said his burger was 3 stars out of 10. The best value tonight was the water! We have very few sit down restaurants in this area, Applebee's should be a welcome addition, But they just throw the food together! It's like the owner of this franchise just doesn't care about the clientele that frequent their establishment. But I think what is worse, the clientele continue to keep them in business, this restaurant is rarely empty. I'm confused, by this fact. I have not been here since 2012 and I will not come back anytime soon. And the ""happy birthday song"" is a bunch of yelling!!! I.cannot.understand.the.words. I will say, my server Anthony, was spectacular. Even if he called me ma'am! :-) good job keep up that southern hospitality."
Chirae G.,"Brooklyn, NY",137,17,13,3.0,10/9/2014,"So I came in here a after being bombarded with the commercials all night.  Lol. I was seated within 2 mins and about 5 mins later my server Ribecka came to greet me.  Very nice young lady.  She took my drink order and gave me time to select my meal.  I chose to do the lunch combo. I initially ordered the Thai  Shrimp salad and the Turkey, bacon & avocado sandwich.  Food came out quickly. However,  they put a a almonds in their salad and of course I'm allergic . So I get the shrimp scampi linguine instead.  I wanted another salad, but most have almonds.  Smh. So I go to eat the sandwich. Yea, no avocado in my turkey bacon avocado sandwich.  I let Ribecka  know and she went to the kitchen.  They didn't ţell her. I never would have ordered  the sandwich had I known. I talked with the manager Andre about this. Not to complain about Ribecka  but lack of communication from the kitchen. He thanked me for input and they had a shipment  of avocados but they were all hard so he sent someone out and should be back soon. We'll about 10 mins later I received a side plate of diced avocado to put on my sandwich.  Would have been nice if it were  sliced and not diced so I could enjoy my sandwich and also if they were a bit softer.  But honestly at this point I just let it be. So my lunch wasn't as enjoyable as I hoped or envisioned.  May be the last time I'm swayed by the late night commercial soothsayer monster.   Thanks Ribecka  for being very kind and patient."
Indira Q.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,1,2.0,3/5/2016,My mom and I waited about 40 minutes for our food. The only plus side to this experience that our waitress was very nice.
Hank K.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,81,757,2.0,12/26/2010,"I have been to this applebees three times now.   It is always superbusy and i don't know why.  The food is overpriced for the quality they serve.   I've had steak, chicken and burgers here and  all were pretty mediocre.           The staff is on point though.   They really cater to the customers and try very hard to please them.   They just seem overwelmed at times from all the patrons that come through here.  the proximity to Brooklyn college probabley brings out the huge crowd everytime there is a special event there.        as another reviewer noted, I've had much better food at many different Applebees located Upstate.   I wonder why?"
Dagmara B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,1,1.0,3/1/2016,nasty microwaved food.. if you think the plate is hot because the food is fresh it is not..the plate is hot because the food just came out of the microwave.. do not waste your time here.. had tilapia and potatoes and chicken fingers..the chicken fingers are a dark brown because the oil has not been changed in a long time. the potatoes have no seasoning and any flavor remaining has been lost in the microwave its obvious the potaoes have been microwaved because if you buy frozen potaotes and put them in the microwave you will taste exactly what the applebees potatoes taste like. the tilapia was ok one star for that.. the drinks suck compared to bbqs but drinking will make you eat the nasty food
Ian E.,"Long Beach, CA",125,48,129,3.0,2/16/2015,Food was good but the service was a little sketchy...took me about 20 minutes to get a glass of water.  The waiter was heavily distracted...cool guy but he couldn't focus.  Over the experience was average but what else can you expect from a chain franchise.  Not bad but not great average.
Mike K.,"Rochelle Park, NJ",28,2,,1.0,2/10/2016,"Worst Applebee's I've ever been to in my life.  Was told lunch is not served until 12, so I ordered a Mexican omelette at 11:15, arrived at 11:50, tasted bad, ate half and left.  Meanwhile everyone else was getting served lunch while I waited.  Real cool Applebee's, real cool."
k w.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,52,,3.0,2/7/2016,"Everybody's knows what Applebee's is. Maybe not the best place ever especially if you are vegetarian. If you are vegan forget it. But it's the only place for miles around in this family oriented, Kosher and Middle Eastern neighborhood where you can get alcohol. Yes, I go to the Applebee's to drink. And I actually like kind of weak, foofy cocktails. You can people watch from the big windows that open on the Junction foot traffic and the staff is nice enough. Dallas BBQ around the corner is the same sort of deal but the atmosphere is too rowdy for me to relax with a drink there.  Why am I writing a review to say what people already know: If you live around here and are desperately searching for a bar walk a few extra blocks towards the Q train and go to OxCart Tavern. It's the mellow, slightly hipstery bar with the ample seating and onion rings you desire . In the meantime, if I don't feel like walking, I'm not to proud to drink at Applebee's."
