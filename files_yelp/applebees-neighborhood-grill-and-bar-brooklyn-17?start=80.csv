Cesar P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,1.0,9/12/2014,I have been here for plenty of happy hours but my experience today has led me to go elsewhere for happy hour.I ordered two mango margaritas and a raspberry margarita.They arrived quickly but they tasted like sweet and sour juice.I explained this to Stephen our server and he tried to resolve the problem.When he couldn't however he said I should speak to the manager.Kenny the manager insisted that each drink contained 2ounces of alcohol.I tried to explain that 2ounces of alcohol in a very tall glass is misleading to the customer.He said that is how they serve the margaritas at Applebees.He offered some kind of shot as a courtesy but at that point I said thanks but no thanks and just left.I am choosing to spend my money elsewhere.
Andy Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,9,,1.0,7/16/2014,Service is terrible went in after work with friends to get something to drink and lite bite however it took 1 hr for is to get a drink and we got food 15 mins after that my suggestion they need a change in management and to set clear expectations of what good service looks like cause they have no idea at this location.
Sergine E.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,3,1,3.0,8/23/2013,This place serve its purpose for it local and convenient and The happy hour. Other then That it is not a bad place not a huge fan of Applebee's . For the students from Brooklyn college to relax from school. There are good attractions such as the deals thy have throughout the years not bad but not great. The waitress that works their well you have to have patience with them because they c
Djinou J.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,54,20,1.0,7/23/2012,"I agree with the rest of the reviewers that this Applebees SUCKS. I live only a few blocks away but I will be starving and bored on a Friday night and I still won't go here. I've been here numerous times and each time it's half assed service and half assed food. Now I understand this is Applebees AKA a fancier version of McDonald's, but there is no reason for it to be this bad. This establishment is just ghetto in terms of service. I do disagree with the other review that you'll need a bulletproof vest; thats a bit of an exaggeration , its def not that crazy or dangerous over there. Most Applebees in nyc are terrible and i dont know why. When i lived in upstate NY, the Applebees was so good you would think they were a completely different chain than the ones in the city. The appetizers are literally half of what I'm used to gettig at my upstate location. We ordered the boneless wings and got 4 pieces that barely had sauce on them. The mozzerella sticks come cold. The burgers canbe good but the meat is always cooked wrongly.  I order medium-well and I receive well done. Dont you dare order well done or you will get it a rock on a bun. Maybe I should order medium-rare next time and they'll get it right? Idk. Servers usually disappear after dropping off your food and never check back in. Everytime I eat here I feel like I should have saved myself the wasted expectation of okay service and just eaten McDonald's or some other crap, at least I know what to expect with them. It's not worth the wait time. The one in sheepshead bay is way more decent. Just get on the B44 and go there instead."
Amira A.,"Brooklyn, NY",353,707,388,3.0,12/26/2012,Chile ghetto... but it's close to home and they make the drinks a lot less stronger than the one at Dekalb. It's way more chill too. It's some characters walking through this piece though...
Kenny L.,"New York, NY",126,298,292,4.0,8/30/2011,"I was deterred with all these reviews, but I guess I lucked out. Got seated very quickly and Gina, the waitress, was quick to get us water and stopped a few times to get our order. (She got a bit annoyed by the 3rd time - but we had our orders set). Wonton tacos is ok. Comes in 4 - quite salty. Basic wonton skin fried with cole slaw and chicken. Apple Reuben with fries is very salty. Meaty but very salty and with heavy butter (there was this orange sauce). This sandwich is good, again, I had low expectations so it ended up as a good sandwich. Crispy Shrimp tasted funky. I assume it was the batter because there is this slight ""bitter"" taste, can't put my finger on it. Gina was quick to clear the table and got our bill. Okay total price for the food and service. Not sure if I should test my luck again, but I liked this experience."
Josh V.,"Bellerose, NY",16,143,189,3.0,11/11/2012,Was pretty standard Applebees experience. Service was just fine as was the food.
Danielle S.,"Manhattan, NY",161,224,230,4.0,10/25/2012,1st time there and I think I was lucky. The service was fast and the food was good. We had the deal that was 2 for $20 plus Appetizers. My BF had the chicken ceasars salad and i had the Homemade Serloin with Mashed potatoes and Brocolli. I have to say that I was pretty satisfied and it is a place that I would come back.
Fadda M.,"Brooklyn, NY",252,169,34,1.0,8/5/2011,"Wow - !  It is hard to make food this bad.  DO NOT ORDER NY STRIP STEAK ! I think I am the first person to every order here in the 1-2 years they have been open here, and that's about how old it was.  SCARIEST PIECE OF MEAT EVER ! I think it could have started something like Steven King's ""The Stand"" had I actually eaten it.  Food is REALLY overpriced and, after several visits and different menu items, ALL REALLY BAD !  That all being said, the bar was busy, and the people at the bar seemed to be having a good time.  Being that I was there w/ a 3-year old, though, unfortunately, that was not an option.  I think they make big ""TGI Friday's""-style drinks.  I imagine that if you drink enough of them (watered down sugary mixers and all), that you will either have a bad headache, or you won't notice how bad the food is or how expensive it is for the quality and service. On top of all this, not only was I not comped anything after waiting forever for poison 2 year old meat, but when they got the sides wrong for the replacement dish, they charged me EXTRA to bring the correct ones. They are out of their minds.  I cannot believe it is as busy as it is."
Adrienne H.,"Manhattan, NY",5,9,8,1.0,3/25/2011,"Eek! Methinks not!! Sooooooooooo true!! I ate at Applebee's last night. The food was normal for an Applebee's food chain. I ordered a sandwich with a spicy coleslaw and my friend ordered hotwings. We sat with empty margarita glasses and NO water as the fire burned a steady hole into both of our tounges and our waitress was MIA. We asked a manager to help us get new drinks, but he disappeared and never returned. Is it too much to ask for a glass of water? Well, yes, at Applebees. We also ordered a dessert and waited waited waited...the waitress came back stating, ""would you like to order dessert?"" I said, ""we did"" she ran to the kitchen and brought us a plate of melted icecream. WOW -- as bon qui qui would say, ""RUDE!"" Joking aside, the service was terrible. boooo hiss"
Tom M.,"Newark, NJ",376,609,342,3.0,9/28/2013,I stopped in for breakfast while in the area. I did not know Applebee's served breakfast. It was actually pretty good and reasonably priced. The had an assortment of omelettes and unlimited coffee refills. Nice service.......attentive.....but it was pretty empty while we were in there.
Quincy T.,"Brooklyn, NY",307,323,487,2.0,8/14/2011,"They really need to step it up if this place is to survive. I've had one okay experience here and I think it was because there was about 15 of us so the guy was guaranteed a big tip. The other times I waited to the point that now I know the managers name....and he isn't very helpful.  Be sure to check your order twice if youre ordering to go, be sure to know what your drink is supposed to taste like if youre at the bar, and be sure to check the receipt for errors......these guys are famous for ""honest mistakes"" as they call it. *cash and credit*"
Cherron B.,"Bronx, NY",94,124,51,2.0,12/13/2010,Waitress was evidently pms-ing.  The manager didnt want to even taste my sam adams when i told him it tasted like coors light. So rude of him. The security guard ignored me when I asked him a question.  Took like 40 minutes to be seated when clearly there was nothing but dirty tables that needed to be cleaned.  The tv's were playing nick jr in the background.  My margarita came with no salt... Seriously. And I payed the 106 dollars.
Amanda B.,"Brooklyn, NY",76,153,24,1.0,6/21/2013,"The buffalo wings looked like they were a week old. They were dry and looked like prunes i dont even know why my friend even ate it...She began to feel sick and the server offered to ask the chef to cook a fresh batch. I really had to ask him, if you are agreeing with me that it looks old... then why would you bring it out to us in the first place? never again"
James F.,"Brooklyn, NY",292,295,280,4.0,12/30/2008,"3.5 stars Nothing more hated than chain restaurants; that is unless you live in East Flatbush, an area dominated by fast food, chinese and west indian takeout. It's seen as a triumph, as if the neighborhood has reached some level of desirability if a major chain opens around here. When I was considering moving back to the area one of my mom's arguments for it was that there was a Starbuck's and Duane Reade within walking distance :). This Applebee's is probably going to be successful whether it's good or not. It has no competition and it's located near Brooklyn College, several bus stops and the last stop on 2 train. Having said that so far it's a pretty good addition to the neighborhood. The service was great. Approaching the bar, the bartender put out her hand, so I instinctively reached for my wallet to give her my ID. Turns out she was trying to shake my hand and introduce herself. Courtesy like this is, unfortunately, not that common in this area. Additionally she directed me to a lunch special which was similar to but cheaper than what I initially intended to order. I ordered a french onion soup with 2 bacon cheeseburger sliders. I have no complaints, the food was satisfying. Actually it was quite good, tasty bar food. I can see myself eating here again. The price of lunch special was $7.99. Hard to complain about that."
Jason A.,"Florissant, MO",0,21,84,1.0,3/23/2015,"The only good thing about this restaurant is the front desk, who will open the door for you. The food here was not good at all, service was poor too. Would not recommend to anyone."
Edgar S.,"Bronx, NY",98,556,145,3.0,5/19/2011,"Hood...Very HOOD. Typical Applebees located in the 'hood. At the height of lunch hour, with plenty of empty tables, we waited 15 minutes to get our waitress to get our attention and another 45 minutes to get our food. WHY? The food was fine but the service seriously blows.  If you do decide to wait for the waitress to take your order and wait for your food, make sure you pack your bulletproof. You'll need it."
Eddie M.,"San Diego, CA",41,21,14,4.0,6/16/2011,"BAR EXPERIENCE: I've always loved the extended weekday applebee's happy hour, and this particular Applebee's does not disappoint. I suggest coming a bit after 8 pm, unless you want to deal with the very busy bar from 4-7. The bar tenders are really overwhelmed a good amount of the time, but they're very friendly and quick to get what you order. Often enough I get charged for less drinks than I ordered, especially if you're patient and courteous.  All in all, I've only been here for happy hour times and it's been great each time, a good place to relax."
Deeana H.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,17,1,1.0,5/20/2010,"Live right near here but as Applebee's is synonymous in my mind to ""overpriced mediocre food and bad service"" I've only eaten from here twice.  Well, almost twice. The first time was when my parents were visiting and they ordered take out before I even came home from work.  The food was fine for what it was but I can't speak for the service because I wasn't involved. The second time I wasn't actually succesful in eating at the place.  I decided to pop in during lunch on a day off, thinking maybe an appetizer or a salad would be a good decision.  The host sat me fairly quickly at a booth three booths away from the host stand/entrance.  The place was pretty dead, I'd say maybe 15% to capacity as it was pretty late for lunch.  I sat at this booth for nearly 15 minutes without anyone saying so much as one word to me.  To add insult to injury, they were playing some sort of gospel music quite loudly over the sound system and without the din of people speaking to distract me, it was painful.  I mean, I'm all for religious music if that's what you like, but only in the privacy of your home/car/office.  Not in a chain restaurant. Toward the end of my wait, they seated an older woman in the booth in front of mine.  Within two minutes, the host was over there asking her if she wanted anything to drink while she waited!  By the time he made it to my table a minute later, I was in the process of standing up to leave.   ""Would you care for something to-"" ""Yeah, no.  I'm just gonna go."" ""Too long a wait?"" ""Yeah.  Thanks anyway!"" I mean seriously?!? If you know why I'm pissed, why did you let me sit there waiting for so long?!   I didn't want to tip whatever neglectful ass that would've been waiting on me for food I'm not even that fond of then, and I doubt I'll go back anytime soon for the same reason."
Co H.,"Far Rockaway, NY",64,15,,3.0,12/27/2010,"Not a fan of chain restaurants...but its 6 blocks away from my grandmothers house why not? Btw my grandmother is like VIP she knows the bartender pretty well (we dont get free food or anything). Service is good here and is probably the emptiest Applebees I ever been too. P.S. The restaurant is technically in East Flatbush considering it sits on the ""junction""."
