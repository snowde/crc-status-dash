Silvershark C.,"Faribault, MN",3,12,2,5.0,11/13/2017,"Great service, Food was served hot and correct, it tasted great !"
Mickensie B.,"Burnsville, MN",47,11,2,1.0,1/2/2018,"Walked in here and the place wasn't even busy at all about 5pm, we waited for about 7 minutes and no hostess or anyone to even seat us, very odd... waved to a server, but they didn't do anything to acknowledge us. Probably will not return to this Applebee's location, and ended up visiting the Savage one instead which was decent."
Nicole B.,"Saint Paul, MN",29,6,,1.0,11/26/2017,"Wait time was horrible and it wasn't busy. Took 12 minutes for server to greet, another 15! Minutes passes till waters and drink comes. We were ready to walk out and should have. No refills and no check back. Won't go back."
Granny C.,"Waterloo, IA",0,16,,1.0,6/12/2017,"I WAS such a fan of Applebees as their food used to be affordable and plentiful. Went for lunch today as I wanted to treat myself.      First of all, it ended up costing over $25 for a strawberry lemonade, salad with steak on it and the spinach artichoke dip.     1. I had to ask for a refill on the drink and turned it down as they would charge me another $3.25. Seems like they are gouging to make a quick buck but hey, they can so they do.     2. The salad had a ton of white, thin sour dressing and the steak had an unpleasant sour sort of green sauce and pepper. However, the steak was very tender. Wish I could have tasted it.     3. I was really disappointed that they have reduced the serving portion of the spinach and artichoke dip to half of what they used to serve for the same amount of money. But hey, like I said, they can so they do, but I won't in the future!"
Aryan B.,"Burnsville, MN",0,2,,5.0,9/9/2017,This was the best experience of a spontaneous idea the workers were really nice and very helpful and it's overall a nice place to eat
Michael P.,"Burnsville, MN",103,4,,2.0,1/1/2017,"First and foremost, some disclaimers.  I came in on New Year's Day within an hour or closing for a take out order.  Thing is, the service aspects of the location were just fine, everyone was pleasant, they were not understaffed, and in every measurable personnel issue there are no complaints.  However, 5hen there was the food, its quality (including price), and the cumulative experience. The food was decent, there weren't any smoking bullets for damnation, but I can also say the food was not nothing to write home about.  Sure, sure, it's a chain and this is plug and play, but something g was missing.  Right off the bat though, the glaring issue was the portion size in relation to quality; you don't mind paying a certain price so long as the quality is amazing or the portion size is big, in this case neither objective was reached.  Packaging was off too, it was a paper bag that wasn5 sturdy, not all of the food was in sealed containers, no napkins or utinsils were included, just a number of items that ought to be there. Anyways, you basically get fast food quality but fine food portions at fine food prices.  For the one burger I purschssed that was smaller than a quarter pounder or whopper, I was charged more money than what I could have psi for 6 double cheese burgers at mcdonalds."
T R.,"Burnsville, MN",0,2,,3.0,8/4/2017,I was very excited to try the Jim Beam manhattan but mine did not have apples like picture and it tasted like there was only liquor and bitters. I had to ask my server for coke to make my own drink. Service was amazing and the food was amazing. I tried another drink from the bar and decided to go with the House Long Island. I could see the bar tender making it and I saw how watered down the ice was once he put it in the glass. My drink was very watered down. Overall I give this location 3 stars because the service and food was great but the most expensive thing on my bill (alcohol) I was not satisfied with.
Traci H.,"Lakeville, MN",2,44,2,1.0,5/13/2017,"Food has really gone downhill.  There were three of us and all three meals were almost tasteless and just overall not very good.   Also had an overly chatty waitress who loved to talk about herself and her birthday.   We may give Applebees another chance, but not at this location."
Anna G.,"Blooming Prairie, MN",0,19,3,1.0,3/16/2017,Waitress was unfriendly and harsh. Fries were ridiculously salty. I couldn't even eat them.
Heather G.,"Minneapolis, MN",763,400,205,4.0,8/22/2014,"While I am a fan of the Applebee's chain, my only complaint would be that they Need faster service for lunch. I have waited too long to place an order and have a meal delivered. Which is ironic because Applebee's touts the Express lunch items and that is exactly what I end up ordering.  The half salad is always a full size portion. So save yourself a dollar and get a half portion. You will still be satisfied. Their happy hour prices should not be ignored. They serve decent drinks and half price appetizers that will cure any craving. The bartenders are so cheerful that you might find yourself wanting whatever concoction they are sipping on. But in the end they make for great entertainment while you are socializing.  I actually find myself at this location because its never crowded. I have scheduled large meetings and social events at this location and have never had the need to call in advance to give them a heads up.  They are located in the Burnsville Center closest to the Sears entrance, near Panera Bread. Parking is plentiful."
Karl W.,"Burnsville, MN",211,194,6042,3.0,3/21/2013,"Applebottoms is everyday average for the most part, but they do a good job introducing new ideas on appetizers and lunch combos which is refreshing.   Riblet basket is a safe way to go as is the Chicken wontons on the appetizer menu.  I also enjoy the Asian salad which is similar to the wontons but in salad form.   Hey, I live in Burnsville so I only have so many options on where to eat."
Jim J.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,27,6,4.0,1/21/2016,"The last few times I've eaten at an Applebee's, I've been pleasantly surprised so it seems they are making a comeback. At this location, the food was very good, but  a bit slow to arrive even though they weren't busy. Service was OK. One odd thing is that both servers handed the food to us, they didn't set it down on the tables, even when they could have easily done so. It's not exactly a destination eatery, but I will stop here again if already trapped at the mall."
Lakshmi R.,"Minneapolis, MN",73,112,10,4.0,8/11/2014,Nice place. We are party of 8 went to this place. Our server was little bit confused with our order but he fixed it finally. Server is friendly and recommended some stuff which is good. We had a nice sangria and lot of appetizers instead of main course. And the thing is they have happy hour pricing at 12 am in the night which is awesome. Definitely come back to place if we need food at midnight.
Chimeren P.,"London, United Kingdom",80,194,358,3.0,10/15/2012,This chain is inside the mall.  Service was good but waitress was so overly friendly it seemed really fake but can't be upset that she was too friendly...what kind of mean person would I be. Got the mini burgers and fries and they were fine but nothing I'd be craving again.  Food came quickly and price was reasonable which is what you would expect from a chain.  I don't love to go to places like this but when your hungry and nothing else is around at least you can go here and know that you'll get nice service and decent food.
Joe B.,"Rosemount, MN",0,9,,4.0,3/22/2015,Stopped in for brunch today. The quality of the food is much improved as of late. The staff was friendly and the environment was nice. Will try this establishment again soon.
J B.,"Port Washington, WI",1,17,,2.0,8/13/2013,"Spent lunch there today, decided to have the ""choose 2"" from the lunch menu, so went with their classic and had the Tomato bisque and spicy chicken wrap. Not much of a lunch as the size of the cup that contained the ranch dressing for the wrap was the same size as the wrap. The soup was pretty good- kinda hard to mess up though.  Although a first for me, I had to ask for ice to be brought out for my water???  So she did just that - not a new water just a cup of ice for me to pour my water in..."
R S.,"Green Cove Springs, FL",0,115,,4.0,10/4/2013,"Not as good as the Southtown Bee, but not bad. Service was good, lunch we had was very good, fresh and served hot. We really like the Bee, all around the country, the food is consistent and poor servers are almost nonexistent."
