Julie D.,"Oxnard, CA",145,318,1209,4.0,1/8/2018,"I always end up here by accident. And each time, it becomes a happy accident.  Dropped by yesterday for lunch. It was very enjoyable and we all walked out wanting to come back ASAP.  Got there just at the peak of lunch rush. We were seated right away though. Amy came over right away and got our drinks order.  There were some new stuff on the menu which we opted for. One of us got the unlimited chicken tenders. I got the 3 appetizer special which was a steal at $12.99.  All the food we got hit the spot. My personal favorite was the chicken tacos. I cleared that plate for sure. The steak enchilada was also good. By the time the sriracha shrimp came out, I was spent. I had two and I couldn't go on like Celine. My heart could not go on.  The service was great. Thanks again to Amy for being awesome. Shoutout to everyone we interacted with. Super dope crew. To the red head who walked by - RAIDER NATION BABY."
Fiona G.,"Honolulu, HI",205,468,3433,3.0,10/2/2017,"Great late night happy hour and apparently the only place open in Camarillo past 9 on a weekday that serves alcohol lol our bartender was really nice and the happy hour prices are great! I would go again, just for the drinks!"
Maynard R.,"Oxnard, CA",42,72,3,4.0,6/25/2017,"My family and I decided to eat here for dinner just a few days ago, and I'm happy to say it was a pleasant experience.  My mom is on a wheelchair since she can no longer walk. So with her being in the wheelchair, I tried to get a table away from where most of other patrons are so weren't in the way of anybody. The host led us to a part of the restaurant where nobody was sitting, and it turned out, there was no server assigned to where we wanted to sit. But our host assured us that it wasn't a problem, and a couple minutes later, our waitress arrived.  The food tasted great, and was served hot and fresh. During our time there, our waitress was always checking up on us; refilling our drinks, bringing napkins, and periodically asking how were.  I seriously appreciated how this Applebee's accommodated my family's special needs.  A great atmosphere, good food at fair prices, and a staff intent on taking care of you. My family and I will definitely be eating here again."
Sarah B.,"Ventura, CA",17,6,14,2.0,12/16/2017,"Food was decent, what made me give two stars is the fact they let a woman bring in her dog in a fucking stroller. No service dog is ever I'm a stroller. Apparently this Applebees likes to violate health and food safety rules and regulations. On top of that our server waa not knowledgeable about the menu on basic questions like can the item hold the onions. And she liked to talk to staff more than assist her guests. Sucks this is the only Applebees in the area. If I have my way I won't be coming back."
Jay C.,"Los Angeles, CA",360,6,,5.0,12/15/2017,Our server Brenda was such a great server! Really appreciated her positive attitude and kept checking up on us. Made our experience great !
J-Money F.,"Camarillo, CA",1,48,18,4.0,10/21/2017,"applebee's is one of our old standbys.  They change up the menu often, and sometimes it's a hit or a miss.  Right now, it seems to be a hit as the new menu options are rather interesting.  They are running a lot of drink specials these days so that's always good. I've had some interesting drinks here.  Hit and miss.  Our last adventure they were giving out $1 margaritas, and let me tell you that you do not want one.  What do you expect for a dollar?  They have something now called Dracula Juice that the wife was quite fond of. I ended up getting one of the new chicken dishes (sorry I can't remember the name), but it was really good.  The wife got some sort of pasta dish that was yummy as well.  the boneless chicken tenders on the 2 for $20 menu are good as well."
Dawna B.,"Quartz Hill, CA",50,77,227,3.0,5/13/2017,"Typical Applebees. We arrived for lunch and was greeted pleasantly. We were seated immediately.  They staff is very attentive. The brought our waters right away as we waited for our handcrafted drinks. We chose the Blue Hawaiian Long Island. Very tasty!  My husband ordered the Double Bacon Chicken Sandwich. He said it was very moist and flavorful. His word ""awesome""! He chose the side salad with blue cheese instead of fries. Salad just right size with sandwich. Sandwich was served in Ciabatta bread. He would definitely order again. I ordered the BBQ Brisket Tacos. Good moist brisket in a flour shell with southwest sauce and fries onions. Good got something different."
Takahiro W.,"Laguna Hills, CA",22,10,,5.0,11/15/2017,"My fiancé and I dined there last night and ordered the 8oz USDA choice top sirloin with tavern mushrooms and onion topper (she got the butter sauce topper. We were completely blown away!! It was honest the best steak perfectly cooked we've had in a long time. We were literally looking across the table from each other wide-eyed. We were not expecting anything exceptional when we visited, but we were pleasantly surprised. Kudos to the chef that night!"
Kimmer S.,"Ventura, CA",8,158,47,2.0,9/19/2016,"I'm blaming the ESPN app for the commercials I've seen lately and hold them personally responsible for a less than great meal. I was interested in the smokey wood fire grilled food advertised lately and came to Applebee's with high hopes that whatever I chose would be flavorful, hot, and filling. It was none of those things which is really too bad because it looked delicious. My bad that I have no photos but I was not dining with fellow Yelpers and non-Yelpers look at me stranger than normal when photographing my entrees.  Went with the wood fired salmon, the wood fire roasted veggies, and cheese&bacon potatoes. And then we waited and waited and waited some more. Thirty minutes later our entrees arrived and one of them was wrong but the rest of us went ahead and started eating. I cut the delicious looking squash and it was not only smoke flavored but the equivalent of chewing what I can only imagine a charcoal briquette must taste like...okay that was going to take some getting used to! The salmon was lukewarm and my sad little potatoes with some sadder looking cheese and tiny brown things that could be bacon...or not. Applebee's gets two stars-one for the water that tasted clean and one for food that looks delicious. I'll spend my dining out dollars elsewhere."
Ben D.,"Camarillo, CA",0,1,9,4.0,4/29/2017,Favorite spot after a long week! The fiesta lime chicken is so yummy and the drinks are always so refreshing too. Can't go wrong with the 2 for $20 and desert after. Minus 1 star though for all the ice in the margaritas/cocktails. Did I order a cup of ice or an alcohol beverage?! Service is always friendly and attentive.
stephanie c.,"San Diego, CA",5,19,,3.0,4/8/2017,"Stopped here on our way home to San Diego for dinner. Service was good, prices are decent and quality of food was very good. But I'm giving it only three stars for these reasons:   1. my husband's dinner came before we got the appetizer and our other two dinners didn't come for 20 minutes. So he ate alone and was done before we even got our meals. 2. I ordered the salmon and got a piece about half the size pictured in the menu. 3. They provide a recommended tip at increments of 15, 18, and 20% - however these tips were based on the total bill including the tax. 4. We talked to the manager about the above and although she listened attentively and commiserated she offered us nothing to compensate for our concerns.   We were a bit surprised that she didn't offer us at least a discount for our meal or a future one--less than stellar customer service.  I felt like they were really glad to see us leave. We like Applebee's and will probably eat at other locations but not go back to this one."
Kevin A.,"Oxnard, CA",28,31,25,3.0,12/30/2016,"Good service pretty  good on the refills but every time I Order something from this place I'm always disappointed with the food, something not tasting good to messing up my order , and having my steak hard as a rock. This place only gets 3 stars because service was at least good but the quesadilla burger is the best and they never mess that up lol. Urgh this place is to be good but now idk. Might come back again and see if anything changes but till then."
Cat P.,"Oxnard, CA",21,11,54,4.0,4/8/2017,"I haven't been here in awhile. The $20 meal deal was affordable. Was sad to find out onw of the items listed on the website was not offered at this location. I was a little with the rice not being cooked. (Not enough water? Very hard and chewy) They sauces were full of flavor.  Needed steak knife to cut chicken. The burgers were on point as always. Tried the frozen lemonade and loved it but was sad their was not free/small charge for refills. Wish they had bigger to go boxes. Bathrooms were clean and employees were using proper hand washing/cleanliness skills which I found refreshing. My server Chad, was very attentive and helpful and explain a lot to me when I had questions. Was surprised that so many servers came to check on us."
Trindy V.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,8,9,3.0,4/4/2017,First time at Applebees and tha food was good (could use a lil more seasoning). The service was decent and the food actually looks like the pic! lol
Mariela B.,"Oxnard, CA",5,21,19,2.0,1/9/2017,"Took about 45 min. to get our food, Was not even that busy and did not order anything that you think would be a long time... a burger and 4 cheese mac & chicken that i dont want to get into details with flavor (not what I expected) cherry pepsi was good though.. our server was very polite and kept comming back to see if we needed a refill... price is fair considering the portions they serve,  place was clean... only need to work on that serving time... I think i would go back as a last option on sports bar..."
Brittany M.,"Camarillo, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/6/2017,"Good food bad service, I ordered at 6:10 (via phone) they said food will be ready in 20 min I get to take out parking at 6:25 and waiting until 7:02 I get my food and when I get home at 7:10 my food is cold and I'm missing my buffalo chicken wings..smh.. and that's why I'm giving it a 1 star.."
Leah A.,"Oxnard, CA",321,10,4,1.0,6/26/2016,"My boyfriend and I ate here last night.  We saw it only had 2 n a half stars but decided to give it a chance. First off our server was very awkward , never smiled and talked way to softly which made it even more awkward. 2nd I noticed as I was looking at the menu there was very little variety and the prices seemed a bit high. I got the mac n cheese for $13.00 that had 2 small chicken strips on top plus it wasn't even cheesy it was a bit soupy with no cheese. My boyfriend got a burger and it was just a patty with bacon crumbs and cheese. No lettuce tomato nothing. We will most likely never go back."
Melissa L.,"Camarillo, CA",254,366,380,4.0,5/21/2015,"In my mind all Applebee's are about the same. However I've been coming to this location over the past 3 years and I think it's fair to say they've earned an honest review. I can easily give them 4 stars based in food, drinks, service, and atmosphere.  Atmosphere: 3.5-4 stars. ITS APPLEBEES, Like how much do you really expect from a chain? It's clean, plenty of seating, sports on the tvs always, and this location personalized it's decor to the city so I think that's great. Also the bar crowd isn't bad, very good vibes all around. Food: 4 stars. Obviously you get what you pay for but with that being said I always leave feeling like I had a good meal for about $10 a person, you really can't beat it. Extensive menu and the 2 for $20 is always my groups go too. My foods been correct and tastes good so no problems there. Service: 4 stars. Not many misses. This location is good with staffing and bringing your food out ASAP. Like I've said I've been coming here for about 3 years, I one point I'd come to the bar here about once a week so I feel like I have a fair say in knowing the service. For people giving low reviews about service id say they had a bad night because for how long I've been coming here it's always been pretty good. Bar area: 5 stars! Drinks are hit or miss you really just need to find what you like. Once you do though you'll be a happy camper! Great selection of beers, liquor, and plenty plenty of mixed drinks! Mojitos, long islands, margaritas! They've all been great. Plus their happy menu is out of this world, most of these drinks range between $3.50-6 you can't beat that!!! Also love their seasonal cocktails, the ones at halloween are the best ;)"
Donna S.,"Ventura, CA",45,33,29,1.0,9/11/2016,"Came in to have lunch. Sat at the bar so we could enjoy a beverage and meal, while watching Nascar. All the televisions were on football.  We asked the bar tender  to put one of them on Nascar and hid immediate response was no I won't do that. He said it is football day. We'll enjoy your football day Applebee's I'll not be back. FYI we are normally regulars here. Will be going next door to Luer's Just one more note The review I wrote on Friday belong to Red Robin in the collection. I guess after having my spectacular massage at Massage Envy and a half a glass of wine I mistakenly gave Applebee's a five star five stars the truth is I was at Red Robin in the collection. They were the ones who should have got the five stars."
Kelly F.,"Camarillo, CA",284,235,762,4.0,2/6/2016,"I like Applebee's as a go to, know what your getting, typical chain restaurant type meal. Whether it's lunch, happy hour or dinner you can safely choose a menu item and satisfy your hunger. The food at this location is exactly that, good. It's not spectacular or anything you wonder how was it made, or asking for the recipe, but it does the trick. It's a good atmosphere and has a variety of options, deals, and combo meals. The service and staff at this location is good as well. They are quick to get you seated and attentive thru your meal. Our servers have always been good, and knowledgeable of the menu. The happy hour specials are great for both drinks and appetizers. The management is also very good, and have always made it a point to stop by the table. Applebee's is always a good go to spot for good food."
Jessica M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,3,3,5.0,4/15/2017,Great service. Great atmosphere. Fantastic food. And good company. Made this a night to remember. Thank you Applebees. We will be seeing each other again.
Tad C.,"Ventura, CA",7,8,,5.0,5/25/2017,"I went to this restaurant only once, the interiors were nice, the service was bit slow due to weekend it was crowded  but by considering everything I will definitely go again."
Angelina L.,"Ventura, CA",2,27,7,2.0,5/13/2017,"Service was terrible, food was not tasty it was grease and no flavor it took a long time just to get drinks and then our appetizers arrived with our meal...just bad over all... the food is not good or the service rude to..not even present staff they disappear,and seem like they rush u to leave ..not worth going just spend the extra cash and go somewhere else"
Charles R.,"Sylmar, CA",49,224,43,5.0,11/21/2016,"I've been frequenting this location lately with friends after 11:00PM for light snacks and/or drinks. We believe the service, food and drinks have been consistently good. Restaurant is always uncrowded at the times we arrive. And the servers/bartenders have always been pleasant."
Alkeya B.,"Ventura, CA",0,13,3,5.0,3/21/2017,They know how to make my perfect special request Long Island. I'm just a girl from Long Island that loves a Long Island
Hailey Marie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",360,3,,1.0,5/1/2017,"Horrible service, I would give them zero stars if I could. I came in so excited for my birthday lunch and our server Sophia H was rude and unaccommodating and wouldn't let me order what I had wanted and completely ruined my birthday lunch and we left because of how awful this experience was. She completely ruined my day and my birthday and I am astounded by how terrible a person could be. I used to love applebees but sadly we are never going to an Applebee's-much less to celebrate my birthday-ever again."
Veronica N.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",3,11,4,5.0,4/23/2017,"This is our second time here and is been consistent with service and  great food, this time I order Cedar lemon chicken and is amazing & healthy. The waitress was very attentive as well as the manager.   The manager was working along side of the wait staff, what a great restaurant team.  That made our whole dining experience amazing."
Alison H.,"Camarillo, CA",37,11,1,1.0,5/11/2016,I was very disappointed in the service my family and I received during dinner the other night. Not one out our three dishes came back remotely edible or made how we had ordered and the wait time to receive our food was over 45 mins. We never were asked for a refill on our drinks even. The table next to us ended up leaving and canceling their order due to the wait time as well.  The prices were high for the quality. I asked for my burger to be well done and it came out mooing.. My daughters pasta was cold and slimy and my husbands chicken was very dry.  Definitely NOT going back!
Destany S.,"Spring Valley, CA",17,123,74,1.0,12/1/2016,So we walk in and get seated. Our server Priscilla came and got our drink order then walked away. We had no menus so we couldn't even see what food we wanted. So I finally asked and got a menu. Next I ordered a side salad. Our server brings the salads to the table and walks away. We have no silverware. Am I supposed to eat with my hands ? I had to walk to another table and take silverware. Terrible service applebees. Disappointing.
Amanda M.,"Port Hueneme, CA",1,10,14,5.0,9/8/2016,"I love this Applebee's. Staff is always courteous and takes good care of you. The food is excellent. Prices are good too. There is plenty of seating and they do great with large parties.  The absolute best dessert is a blondie. If you haven't had one, do yourself a favor and try it. You will come back time and time again for one."
Samantha G.,"Camarillo, CA",56,2,,1.0,1/17/2017,The food tastes like it's warmed up in a microwave my fries came out half cold already. Not even crispy. Their fried shrimp was burned and had an awful aftertaste. I really hate this place but after today I'll never be back
Alissa E.,"Oxnard, CA",506,28,236,1.0,7/30/2015,"I came here the day they were showcasing their new appetizers for free. Our waiter spoke to us condescendingly throughout the duration of our time there. Not to mention she also brought the wrong orders THREE times and failed to apologize for doing so.  The food itself was okay and she gave us a discount at the end for all of her mistakes, but I will definitely not return here."
Michael S.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",2,41,53,4.0,5/29/2016,"Surprisingly the food was served warm enough and tasty. The problem was the very long wait after ordering. It took 20 minutes for the appetizer sampler platter to arrive. No chips or bread so when we waited 7:00 pm on a Sunday night even the fake flappy bird fame was not satisfying.  The server was pleasant; it's a family friendly bar atmosphere.  The regular hamburger is good. The beer with onion squashed in the patty was good, they forgot the sauce on the side, oh well. The Cesar salad with ""easy dressing"" was not easy, again, oh well.  The two top sirloin steaks were better than I expected. The green beans good, a little garlic I think on then, but good macaroni was ok, but like baked crusty macaroni.  I think they need one more server there, but the guy was nice.  The men's restroom's air conditioning was like a meat locker.  Id go again, but only if the Fish Lure next door had a 30 minute wait the Fish Lure is classy, tasty and has great servers. Probably because they are making money."
Stephanie L.,"Oxnard, CA",0,14,,3.0,2/1/2017,We stopped in during happy hour to grab a bite to eat and ordered the 4 Cheese Mac n Cheese with honey pepper chicken tenders and it was awful. It was really sweet and runny  and the chicken was overcooked and burnt and not sliced up like it showed. I really would like to only give 2 stars but the service was great and that means a lot.
Gloria P.,"Ventura County, CA",457,297,2549,3.0,2/21/2015,"Decent food. Fair prices. Good lunch and dinner specials. Service was good. There is a tablet on each table that can be used to order and pay for your meal. We did not use it to order but did use it to pay. Kinda cool. There are also games available for a fee.  I had a Bloody Mary it was good and spicy. For my meal I went with the bourbon chicken and shrimp which came with roasted potatoes. I was satisfied with my meal. My boyfriend had the double crunch shrimp which he enjoyed. I stole a couple of his fries and I wanted more. What I like here is their menu with a variety of foods and deals. 2 for $20 deals and lunch specials. There is something for everyone. Soups, salads, appetizers, sandwiches, steak, chicken, fish, pasta etc etc. a large drink menu too. Car side to go service available and online ordering."
CM Y.,"Ventura, CA",33,2,1,1.0,3/31/2017,"GLASS IN MY ARTICHOKE DIP!! --- Me and my girlfriend went here to have dinner for my birthday. We ordered the 2 for $25 dollar meal that came with a free appetizer. We ordered the artichoke and chips. As i was eating that, all of a sudden, i felt a pain coming from my mouth. It felt like i had bitten into a rock. I pulled it out of my mouth and looked at it. It was a piece of glass!! I told the waitress and she told her manager. He came up to me and said, ""sorry"" and walked away. I guess, he thought since i wasnt making a scene he had gotten away with it. I asked for the bill and the waitress asked me how my meal was. They were going to try to pretend that it was not a big deal. Finally, after giving them multiple opportunities to make it right, i realized, they were not going to do it unless i made them. I said, it should go without saying, i am not going to pay full price for something that i could not eat because there was broken glass in it ... the manager gave me $10 off the bill ..."
Joshua P.,"Fowler, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/16/2017,The service here was amazing!! We ate in the bar area and our waiter was a man named AJ. He was great! He was super friendly and he did an amazing job! He always made sure we were ok and he was great to talk to. We are from Fresno and this Apple Bee's is the best one I've been to by far! I would definitely recommend this place. Couldn't ask for a better dinner experience! Thank you! I hope the next time I come back I will have the same experience.
Sonja M.,"Simi Valley, CA",1,5,,2.0,6/10/2017,"I have not been here in years but thought let's give it a go. When we ordered we asked if our fries could be hot...well we got our burger not hot and fries later..anyhow the food was just mediocre and we will not go back..when paying almost 50.00 for a meal come on folks it should be enjoyable...Our server Richard, did not ever once smile or come back to see if everything was OK until we were done..what happened to service?  I was a waitress for years, people are going to a restaurant to have a nice experience not feel as though we r doing them a favor by coming to their restaurant..I'm getting so tired of spending my hard earned money at these glorified fast food restaurants."
Angelina M.,"Ventura, CA",0,7,1,1.0,4/13/2017,"Only reason I come here is because there is not another Applebee's near by for me to get Won-ton Tacos... but every time I am here the service is extremely bad... wait staff doesn't attend the tables equally, they seem to only go to particular tables more and forget about the rest. Food half the time comes out room temperature or not at all and you have to remind them and remind them about getting your drink refilled after it's been sitting empty at the side of the table for the past 10 minutes. Please get your staff to pay attention to the patrons and be sure the food is fresh. Nobody likes their hot food cold."
Mark M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",66,14,,1.0,6/27/2016,"Went for lunch ordered my food asked for a steak well done. Got my food and when I cut into it, it basically bleed all over my plate. Asked the server if they could get me a steak that was cooked. Manager came over and apologized said he asked them to make me a steak that was well done. After about 10 mins I got a plate that had different sides and a steak that was partially eaten and even a piece that was obviously chewed up and spit back out on the plate. Manager apologized and said he didn't know what happened. Last time I go to this Applebee's."
