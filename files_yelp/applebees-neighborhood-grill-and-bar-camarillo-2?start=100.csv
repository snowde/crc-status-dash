Arianne S.,"Camarillo, CA",28,116,51,4.0,11/18/2014,"They make great drinks and I have yet to have an entree that I don't like. My favorite is the chicken penne pasta! The only reason I'm writing a 4 star review is because the booths can use more cleaning. I know that doesn't seem like such a huge deal but it happens every time we visit that the booths, chairs, and the ground is dirty with left over French fries or napkins and such."
David C.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,4,1,5.0,4/27/2015,"Best Applebees that I've gone to, great service and great food. Like coming here on the weekends when I visit Oxnard or the camarillo outlets when I come from LA. Every once in a while I stop here and eat some lunch."
Hang L.,"CA, CA",2,21,1,2.0,12/28/2015,"It took a bit long to get seated even though there were plenty of open tables. The bartender and servers did not appear to be busy but did not greet or seat us for at least 10 minutes. It was an awkwardly long time to be stared at and not have anyone acknowledge your presence. It took so long to be seated that we were debating about alternative restaurants to go to. Service was okay. We had the baby back ribs and the mac and cheese, which were okay but not something I would keep coming back for especially if we are treated this way."
Kathy J.,"Valencia, CA",0,4,2,2.0,1/18/2016,"Food was okay but customer service was poor. They have a tablet on the table where you can order your food and neither the hostess nor the server bothered to explain or tell us about it. My son messed with the tablet and played a game and before we knew it, there was an extra charge on my check for the game. If the staff would have told us about the tablet, I would have had my son stick to his own iPad. obviously, customer satisfaction wasn't their goal but to make $ so beware!"
Kim B.,"Ventura, CA",9,21,15,4.0,2/7/2013,"January 26, 2013 We were greeted and seated promptly when we arrived @ 11. Our server for today was Giselle, she kept our drinks full and the service was fast and friendly. We opted to get the 2 for $20 deal. For our appetizer we chose the Potato Twisters. They are always good and that cheese sauce is so yummy! My Partner in Crime (PIC) thought the twisters should be seasoned. Being that I need to stay away from as much sodium as possible, I thought they were good plain. I mean you have that amazing cheese dip to slather them in. I was undecided on which entre' to choose. But ended up getting the Riblett Basket with the southern bbq sauce. The ribs were moist, the sauce was kinda bland, will try a different flavor next time, but definitely good. The fries were seasoned just right and were crispy on the outside and just right in the inside, u know not to dry and bountiful. My PIC got the Chicken Tenders Platter which included cole slaw and french fries. reported the slaw was crisp and fresh tasting and was on the mild side meaning it was not overwhelming. We both had the same opinion on the fries. Chicken tenders had the right amount of breading they were moist and tasty and the ranch put it over the top."
Mikey M.,"Ventura, CA",26,26,18,1.0,10/22/2015,"With a  common decor similar to red robin, this particular Applebee's will be making one leave with the feeling of regret and disappointment. Custom to the normal means of hospitality, this restaurant is far below the par level.  As my patrons and I sat diligently we noticed both larger and smaller groups were seated after ourselves as they only have waited for five to ten minutes while we have sat patiently for thirty. In addition, its apparent that the bar seating area's rules can change at a moments notice with the discretion of particular servers, thusly makes the idea of ""patients is a virtue"" simply obsolete. The food has came lukewarm in multiple visits with a few entrees either cold, warm  or one actually at serving temperature. The level of customer service is a serious issue that a majority of servers must be accustomed to learn once again. The restrooms are probably cleaner than the interior and exterior of the restaurant. The only positive aspect of this location is that it is located right off the freeway. Do yourself a  favor and choose any other restaurant within the same vicinity."
holliday a.,"Somerset, NJ",0,9,2,1.0,1/27/2016,"Beware of the ""Kobe Beef meatballs"".... it's not all beef....it contains Pork...!!! and it does not state this on the menu.... if you have dietary restrictions, be careful of this item."
Max G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,62,2,4.0,8/3/2014,The food has always been consistent and good. They need to hire more waiters...always a few empty tables and a usually a wait list.
Cindy K.,"Camarillo, CA",4,31,,1.0,5/28/2013,"My husband and just recently ate at Applebee's , and thought that maybe the service would improve from our last visit last year! Well, it didn't. Our waitress was a complete phony! When she brought us our food, it wasn't that good. My husband had ordered a shrimp salad with extra shrimp. Guess what? No extra shrimp, and half of it was cold!! The only thing that was decent was the iced tea and the perfect margarita! Once again, Camarillo's Applebee's is seriously slacking in the food and service department. That's how they probably closed the first time! Get it together, or you'll be closing your doors again, and won't be welcomed back!!"
Karlee D.,"Camarillo, CA",31,55,5,1.0,3/15/2014,Had a party of 12 last night for my sons birthday. Our server had our party and 2 other tables of 2 people. It was the WORST service I have ever had there. We got seated at 6:30 and left at 8:45pm and only because that's how long it took to be served. Our chips and salsa took 30 minutes!! It took 20 minutes to get an ice tea refill!!  We were missing food after we waited 45 minutes for it! The worst part was the server wasn't far away he was talking to a table with clearly his friends and just ignoring us. I can't even say management cares because at the end I spoke with a manager and she said let me comp u. As someone who use to work in the restaurant business that means a gift card or free meal. But I guess to her that meant a coupon for a free kids meal with adult entree purchase. Wow thanks but no thanks!!
Raul A.,"Oxnard, CA",95,20,25,4.0,11/16/2013,My mom and I decided to get the 2/$20 deal here. We settled on the Mozzarella sticks as our appetizer. Delicious! ..... waiting on our entrees.
Paul P.,"Round Rock, TX",166,178,9,4.0,7/26/2012,"Applebee's or Chili's is one of those places you can go if you're in a big group and can't agree on what you want to eat. That was particularly our case so here we were. I think when we came they had a 2 for $20 type of thing. The food is traditional American and it's really hard to mess that up. The service was good, and everything came like it should. So I know that if we were hungry and didn't know where to go, this would definitely be an option for us."
Tim R.,"Camarillo, CA",6,19,11,1.0,3/12/2012,"I will NEVER eat there again. This place has quickly become what it was before.  A suck ass place serving suck ass food. I went here a month ago and waited 15 minutes for a table along with 20 other people when there were at least 10 empty booths. This last time I went there with my daughter and ordered the 3 cheese chicken penne pasta for diner. It was served to me in a BOWL! DOGS eat out of BOWLS. Peasants,serfs ,servants and slaves were once served their food in BOWLS. Only the gentry folk were allowed to eat on plates. That is how much inconsideration this place has for paying customers.  How the heck are you expected to cut your food when it is crammed in to a BOWL!  The bread stick was just thrown on top like an after thought. What I thought ,hoped would be a nice dinner became a moment of infuriation that I can not explain. I was so pissed I ate my BOWL full of  tasteless  over cooked gruel and paid and left. Then 20 minutes later realize  I had left my wallet and had to return still pissed to retrieve it. Never again though. I will not eat there ever again. ""F"" this place."
Al K.,"Camarillo, CA",0,3,,5.0,11/22/2015,"Good food at a reasonable price. Cedar plank salmon included a large serving of salmon, and was very tasty. Had very good and friendly service from a waitress with the first name of Kirsten. Good family restaurant. We had an excellent server, couldn't have asked for more !"
Shane B.,"Newbury Park, CA",4,79,1,3.0,8/9/2014,Food was ok! They have 805 on tap so beer review is 5/5! Staff was friendly and helpful! Was a little expensive for what we got! Had TVs but all had same game on! Experience was great but that because of staff and beer!
Stacey D.,"Camarillo, CA",0,27,,2.0,9/18/2011,"Let me start by saying that I typically stay away from Applebee's because of a story I was told by a worker on things that happen ""behind the scenes"" there (this was a different location but you have to wonder).  Perhaps it's not fair of me to generalize from one story, but that's just how many of us can get when we hear something that we don't like. Anyways, I decided to give the newly-reopened Applebee's here in Camarillo a shot.  Went there on a Thursday night.  First impressions was that it looked fairly clean (but it's new afterall) and the hostess was friendly and seated us quickly.  There was just two of us and she placed us in a quieter section of the restaurant which was very thoughtful. Admittedly, service was pretty decent, but not stellar.  They were friendly and attentive.  Food didn't take long.  My son ordered a hamburger with no onion (but they still included the onion), and I got one of their 550-under entrees.  Both were pretty good. Here's what's so bad.  My plate arrived looking as though it hadn't been washed!!  UGH!!  Smears all around the food, multiple fingerprints, spots that I couldn't recognize.  It looked disgusting.  The manager said it was ""hard water spots.""  Are you serious?  I know what hard water spots look like and servers are not supposed to grip plates all over like that.  My son's plate looked better but far from spotless.  What a shame.  Decent service and food but sorry...  You bring me a plate like that and then try to run some BS by me.  Serious down grade.  Not going back.  Now I remember why don't like going to Applebee's.  Thanks for the reminder."
Derek C.,"Camarillo, CA",41,88,7,5.0,4/23/2014,Applebees..the new applebees is great. Food is very good and bartenders are so nice.  A plus is they are open laaaaaaattttte.  In Camarillo this is huge.
Blake C.,"West Hollywood, CA",31,77,15,1.0,8/27/2011,"This was my first time to an Applebees in years, and I couldn't remember for the life of me why I had waited so long to go back.  Well... the good people at this Applebees were kind enough to remind me. For starters, we received no welcome.  The hostess grabbed three menus and showed us to a table in the back.  Our waitress showed up 5 minutes later and we ordered a sampler appetizer.  It took nearly 20 minutes for it to come out (and mind you, there were maybe 5 other parties in the restaurant).  Our chicken wings were cold, the spinach dip seemed to be 10 parts cream to 1 part spinach, the mozzarella in the mozzarella sticks was hard and chewy, and finally the quesadillas... actually, they weren't too bad!  The queso cheese and crispy tortillas made for a tasty simple quesadilla. For our meals, we ordered turkey club sandwiches and burger sliders, all with a side of onion rings.  My friend who ordered the sliders got through 1 before she said it had such a odd taste she couldn't keep that one burger down.  My other friend and I both got the club sandwiches.  She finished hers reluctantly because we hadn't eaten all day and it was 3pm in the afternoon.  I could barely eat half of my sandwich because it was a tasteless pile of mush.  It was so drenched in sauces and slimey cold cuts you couldn't taste a thing.  And lastly, the onion rings had such an odd taste to them as well, as if they had been fried in stale oil.  Needless to say we also only received a handful of onion rings (literally, we each received 5). This will undoubtedly be my last time at an Applebees.  EVER."
C B.,"Camarillo, CA",14,13,,1.0,5/5/2013,Hit or miss service. Only had a good experience TWO times. Thanks to Crystal & Sean. Everyone else has no sense of urgency. There's been more than one time I've sat there over 10-15 minutes waiting to be greeted. I've walked out twice and wont be back!!!!!! Don't go here unless you have all the time in the world
Carlos M.,"Santa Paula, CA",0,4,1,5.0,7/6/2014,"Was are 1st time, at this location, service was great, and the food was great. John are waiter was great,  very busy place. Will be back, since the one in Ventura is gone, for some reason. Love it."
