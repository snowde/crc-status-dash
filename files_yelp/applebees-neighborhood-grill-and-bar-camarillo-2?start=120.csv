Camren B.,"Camarillo, CA",209,24,11,1.0,7/13/2011,"Thanks for bringing back the SUCK and FAIL of Applebee's to Camarillo.  I totally understand why it closed before. Here's the good: The Hostess, The Beer, The Food Runner, The Manager. The Bad: Service was stupid slow.  It should not take 2.5-hours to eat at Applebee's. It took us 15-minutes to get the check, which was wrong and another 15-minutes to take off the two things we never ordered.  Having one bartender behind the bar is not enough to serve the bar and restaurant.  Drinks took forever.  Waitress disappeared multiple times and then she asked, ""Is something wrong?"" at the very end of our meal.  Not to mention my medium-rare (how I ordered it) steak was as chewy as taffy.  Bad grade meat (no matter what the menu says).   Needless to say, I will not be back. p.s. - Poor music choice for the restaurant"
Rawan A.,"Ojai, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/29/2013,"I got the lunch special a sandwich and a salad, well when I was eating my sandwich & I found 2 moldy spots on the bread. The manger came out , which was named Brian, didn't even say sorry & tried to tell me it wasn't mold. He was very Unprofessional & didn't take care of the Situation Correctly! I'm never going there again after getting attacked by a so called manger"
Sabarish P.,"Irvine, CA",1,17,2,5.0,6/8/2014,I went to this applebees on 2 consecutive Saturdays for dinner with my girlfriend. We were warmly welcomed. No issues in getting seated. The waitress was friendly in taking orders. Our orders came in at pretty good time. The food also tasted good and fresh. Overall it was a good experience. Nothing bad to tell about.
Erica G.,"Simi Valley, CA",72,133,55,5.0,7/11/2011,"So far so good, re-opened Applebees! We've been back three times and each dish has been really great - except my chicken sandwich was a little dry on one of the times. Ask your servers not to hard-sell the desserts. Survey or not, I'm Ok with just what I ordered. If I want more, I'll let you know!"
Freddi G.,"Camarillo, CA",153,40,,1.0,2/23/2014,"I'm actually not surprised about the low rating of this place. I hope they take notice. On Valentine's day we came by for dinner and we ordered a good amount of food between my wife, my kids and a friend. We wanted to sit and enjoy our conversation and sober up, but our waiter asked us, not if we wanted dessert, but asked if we were done...like ""are you guys done"", which took us all by surprise. We did not over stay our visit and we definitely ordered a decent amount of food and did not expect to be treated that way. The words ""trying to kick is out"" was at the tip of my tongue but we decided to express our distaste by tipping appropriately. I don't like doing this and normally a 20% tipper but he had it coming. Although the food has improved since they reopened, the service has not."
Lori R.,"Camarillo, CA",5,12,5,2.0,5/21/2014,Ewww...I should've listened to the previous reviews before deciding to have dinner here. The steak was like chewing on an eraser and the fish & chips were soggy. I gave them 2 stars only because the service was OK. I wont be returning.
Kate F.,"Camarillo, CA",63,12,,3.0,6/27/2011,"The day my two boys have been waiting for is here...the Camarillo Applebee's has reopened under new ownership.  The outside of the building has been spruced up with new paint and new signage.  The interior has also been greatly improved with new decor that is updated, but still relevant to the community.  Where the previous owners used collages of local photos and memorabilia, the new owners have chosen photos of local landmarks and activities.  Tasteful, bright, and clean.  There are also a dozen or so well-spaced flat-screen monitors playing various sporting events. Although I'm not sure when they reopened exactly, it's clear that the restaurant is still in the infancy stages.  There were 3 times as many employees on-hand today as necessary and many of them seemed to simply be observing.  (A bit of a shame, because they could have been a shade quicker with refills, but it wasn't a big deal.)   Good news first - The kids meals were perfect. My 8-yr-old reports his chicken tenders were tasty, and not scorching hot, and only wishes restaurants wouldn't serve applesauce with an adult-sized soup spoon (but that's certainly not unique to this place). My 4-yr-old loved his corndog and fries (big surprise there), also not scorching hot. I tasted a few of his fries, and I have to agree that they were quite good. Not so good news - The ""Paradise Chicken Salad"" was a bust. The grilled chicken was tasty, but the rest of the dish was just not great. Now, I know it's supposed to be a Weight Watchers dish and to stay under 350 calories is tough, but the lack of flavor was disappointing. The bulk of the salad was romaine lettuce and shredded cabbage. There were some carrot shreds and even fewer microscopic bits of pineapple and tomato tossed in along with 4-5 mandarin orange slices, and about 5 small chunks of green apple around the edge of the plate. The menu claimed that it was tossed in a ""cool balsamic vinaigrette"" but it must have been only a few drops. The concept has potential, but not at the current ratio of ingredients. A couple last peeves - While I understand not bringing place settings for the kids, whose meals don't require silverware, at least bring a few extra napkins. And no, beverage napkins that have been catching condensation from the kids' lemonade cups aren't enough. Also, our waitress lacked some basic social skills. Speak up, look at me when you speak, and use complete sentences. (OMG - I sound like my mother!) All in all, we had  a good lunch.  The kids LOVE this place, and as any parent knows, happy kids tend to lead to more peaceful meals.  We look forward to the staff getting adjusted to serving ""real"" customers.  Lord knows we'll be back."
Natalie W.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",0,115,8,2.0,8/28/2013,"Had to stop here w my chillies, we were hungry and I figured easy menu for the kids. The service was wonderful, but my steak was raunchy, off brown and chewy like rubber. I sent it back and it came back ok, the wait time was about 35 mins for our meals..... Not easy with two kids. Manager came over and said sorry about the steak, it was weird because the women next to our table also had a long wait time and were brought ""complimentary sundaes""..... I'm sitting there w two kids, my sons nearing a nervous break down. Throw some comp fries at us or something. Overall just blah.  Def won't be back, I'll head next door to lure and have amazing food."
Ted U.,"Camarillo, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/23/2012,"Don't order a steak, unless you like the taste of suck. The only thing that stinks worse than their steaks are their managers faces, because their heads are so far up their asses. The only thing you can look forward to at this place is getting drunk... that is if you come in on a day when some new and under trained bar tender isn't working.  There where two cool bartenders, one of which quit and it's always someone new and terrible. Haven't the managers ever heard of bartending school? Guess you don't have to finish college to manage one of these places."
Don N.,"Port Hueneme, CA",0,28,,5.0,7/1/2011,"I have never been to an Applebee's before, this was my first time and I was really impressed. They recently reopened after being closed for a while, I guess. They had many employees training which made the service excellent.We had a appetizer sampler that was really tasty. It had quesadillas, wings, Spinach dip with chips and mozzarella sticks. All hot, fresh and good. We ordered the provo stuffed meatballs and a trio with pork won ton tacos, more spinach dip(It was really good)and quesadilla towers. The menu is extensive, the margaritas are great the atmosphere great. I will defiantly return."
Olga Z.,"Covina, CA",25,54,22,1.0,5/28/2013,"I am truly surprised to read the reviews as I experienced the strangely unwelcoming service from the moment I entered. I am 42 and well showing at least 35 ( no false modesty).We tried to come in for happy hour and were declined drinks due to my expired CA ID which I just carry to accompany my Interim drivers license. After the bar tender ""suspiciously"" checked mine and my bfs license she proceeded to show the manager my ca license and DMV papers as if they were phony... So insulting! Honestly! Will I fake a CA DL to have drinks at Applebee's? just so rude! After reading reviews I guess we were done a favor... Sorry... This is upsetting!"
Joel G.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,12,,1.0,1/19/2015,"Five of us went to Applebee's last night and had a horrible experience,  First, my dad's coffee came out cold, and they reheated it.  Then two of the dinners came out cold, and they undoubtedly stuck them in a microwave (one was a chicken dish, which made the chicken tough) to reheat those, rather than make new entrees.  My wife's salad had mold in it.  They took the salad off of the bill, then asked if she'd like soup instead, then charged for the soup.  The waitress never returned to the table to find out if anything was all right.  After the meal, we spoke to the manager who, at first, simply said, ""Sorry.""  It wasn't until we raised a stink that he actually offered to compensate us in any way for the TERRIBLE service and food.  He then comped the entire bill, so I can now say the meal was worth every penny we paid-nothing. What a dump."
Sandy M.,"Camarillo, CA",0,21,,2.0,4/3/2012,"Sadness fills my pallette!!!  I was pretty excited to hear that I was going to be able to get the Asian Chicken Salad again once Applebee's reopened the doors.  I ordered this salad and was soooooo disappointed.... I don't know if they used old oil to fry the chicken strips but I would say NO GO on the crispy chicken!  So I thought, well, I really need to be healthier so I will order the grilled chicken. NOPE, not better at all! Ok, I'll give em another chance. This time I ordered the Steak with garlic sauce! The sauce was pretty good but the steak must have been beat to death and then marrinated for weeks. NOT GOOD! Should I try this place again? Well, I'm not in too much of a hurry."
Christine K.,"Lawndale, CA",0,18,,4.0,6/24/2013,"My husband and I are regulars here (we eat here several times a week). We generally are very happy with the service and the food. Our favorites tend to be: Appetizers: Wonton Tacos - The BEST! Very flavorful and unique. Brew pub pretzels - my hubby loves these. The cheese sauce has a great beer flavor, and the pretzels are always crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. wings - tasty potato twisters - a bit hit and miss for me. It seems extremely hard for them to get these cooked so that they're crispy but not overdone. Generally, they're dark with a slightly scorched flavor, which my husband is happy with. I prefer golden brown, but it appears that if they don't overcook them, they turn up soggy in spots where they're bunched together. If they got rid of the crazy cut of the potatoes and just made them flat chips, it would cook more evenly. The cheese sticks and quesadillas are also pretty good. I find the bread for the sliders to be a little too mushy. Entrees: I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Bourbon Street Steak. It's always tender and juicy and comes with a great sauce on top (ask for extra). I've tried several of their other steaks and prefer this one. The Bourbon Street chicken and shrimp was good the one time I had it, but I definitely prefer the steak. The garlic herb salmon, three cheese chicken penne, cup of tortilla soup, creamy parmesan chicken, oriental chicken salad, and riblets are all pretty good. Desserts: Brownie bite, a small brownie wedge and small scoop of ice cream with hot fudge hits the spot without too much guilt (either for the waistline or pocketbook at $1.49). The butter pecan blondie is super rich and deadly. (Though not as good as a pizookie from BJ's, it's still pretty darn good.) Hubby tried the chocolate mousse shooter last night and enjoyed it. Drinks: A little hit and miss. They do seem to hold back a little on the alcohol during happy hours. I like the fruity ones like the white peach sangria, and some of the fruity martinis. Hubby likes the house margarita and corona-rita. Check for their specials during different times and on different days. If you come often, be sure to pick up the $50 gift card that comes with a free $10 gift card (offered during limited periods of time). It saves you the amount for tips."
Wes S.,"Ventura, CA",1351,866,624,3.0,2/6/2008,"Another 3.5 star review. Applebee's is my favorite when the one thing in their menu is ""all-you-stuff-your-silly-face-with"" - the riblets. The riblets are basically the rib tips/ends slowly cooked in (their?) bar-b-que sauce This is another establishment pre-Yelp that I used to rave about. Well, my tastes have somewhat matured. So, this place is just ""OK"" now. They also have a fairly good sampler platter that you can munch on while watching a game or two on the numerous tvs around the restaurant.  If you're coming for a game with your buddies, it's best to ask for a table around the bar as that's where most of the tvs are. Food is OK for the price you pay, not gourmet, but nothing too bad either. If it's better quality bar-b-que you're looking for and you're in the area, head over to Bandit's or Wood Ranch just down the freeway."
Karene O.,"Oxnard, CA",0,15,4,5.0,11/19/2014,"My husband and I recently dined at this establishment. When we arrived, we were greeted by a very nice gentleman who showed us to our table. When our waitress arrived, she was very sweet and full of suggestions. Our food was delicious and the over all experience was very pleasant. We will definitely be returning soon!"
Christina O.,"Camarillo, CA",10,6,,5.0,9/3/2012,Yesterday had lunch and our waiter Justin K. was one of the best waiters we have ever had - he was a very pleasant lunch because of him and because of him I give this restaurant - 5 stars  the food is always the same good.
Sara A.,"Camarillo, CA",1,6,,1.0,1/26/2012,"I'd like to give this place a 1/2 star, if possible (I'm new on Yelp)                           First things first, we did not receive a welcome to Applebee's upon entering the restaurant. I had been wondering why I hadn't been to this Applebee's before they closed and after they had opened. Now I know why. The service is shoddy, as it took awhile to be greeted at our table. Restaurant wasn't even that busy, so I didn't understand why our server didn't greet us right away. Everyone at my table had received their drinks in a timely manner, but it took about 20 minutes to receive the water that I ordered. We had to remind the server/waiter to bring my water. As a vegetarian, there aren't that many options for one to order, especially not for the '2 for $20' deal they brag about.              Anyway, I ordered pasta from the 2 for 20 deal and asked if I could get the pasta without chicken and the server brings the food. Once he brought the food and after taking a few bites, I noticed that the pasta had bits of bacon minced into the alfredo sauce. When he brought the food, and maybe he was trying to be funny, he stated that my pasta was the way I ordered it, 'chicken and all'. Hahaha, very funny, but I didn't appreciate the sarcasm considering the fact that I was already fuming after the poor excuse for a greeting we received at the door and how long it took to be waited on and receive my water.                 After our meal, the manager came up to the table and asked how everything was and if there was anything he could do and that he had already deducted a whopping $8 from our bill. The shadiest thing is that he said we wouldn't see the deduction on the bill, we would just know that he deducted $8. Then when we received our bill, we noticed the itemized $8 deduction..Where is the consistency in his gesture? I understand he was being kind in mediating the situation, but his honesty was shady (for lack of a better word). When he asked how everything was..I stated that things were mediocre at best and the waiter should have known that there was bacon in the pasta sauce.  The server did not ask us how we were doing during our meal or if we needed anything, we had to flag him down. Meanwhile, the table next to us was receiving stellar customer service from Neil P., who knows why or how this was justified.                  Also, when Neil came around to take my picked-at salad, he didn't ask if I was done with it, he just took it without asking if I wanted a box or if I was done with my meal. At this point, I just wanted to get out of this place and go home. By the way, the waiter/server's name was Neil P. and the manager Frank Navarro was not too concerned with my overall opinion of the service (as he quickly received my answer and moved on to a different area of the restaurant) or the fact that they messed up my food order AND charged us for the salad at first, then upon noticing that I didn't eat my salad they took the charge off for the salad (nice gesture, but a little late with the customer service).                             My husband and I, plus the rest of the individuals we inform of this wondrous place are never going to return! I hope this place closes again as their food is bland, service is poor and integrity has been blown to bits. My patience was really tested in this place and I would like to think of myself as a patient and sensible individual. But.. I should have known better as this is a corporate chain which should have stayed closed! What was I thinking? Just say 'No' to Camarillo Applebee's and maybe even the other ones.."
walt h.,"Camarillo, CA",3,121,,3.0,10/6/2012,"3 stars: A-OK What exactly is a riblet?  What part of a pig does a riblet come from?  I have a sneaking suspicion it is some chemically & mechanically processed form of pork like a McRib, but I'm afraid to ask.  This location was probably better before the re-open. Not sure if it's the new menu/logo/corporate identity, but it's just not the same.  Since it's an Applebee's it's pretty consistent with any other Applebee's on the planet.  Nothing special, but nothing glaringly bad.  I always want to harass the servers about not wearing enough pieces of flair, or some other nonsense, but I'm a little too old for that, and they're a little too young to understand what I am talking about."
Scott D.,"Camarillo, CA",9,14,,1.0,12/4/2013,"This is the third time I took the family there.  We were crammed into a booth to small all three times.  The problem with a chair on the end of the table is that there is not enough room for everyone to eat comfortably, besides aren't there fire codes regarding blocking an isle?  All THREE steaks were cooked wrong.  The cook obviously has no idea what rare is.  This is what they do for a living.  Why can't they get it right?"
