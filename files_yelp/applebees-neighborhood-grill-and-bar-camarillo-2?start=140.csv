Steven L.,"Camarillo, CA",57,65,36,1.0,7/4/2012,"I don't expect a lot from big chain restaurants anymore. However, I do expect my order to be right. Not once but twice did we have to send back the food because it was wrong. There is simply no excuse for making the same mistake twice. All that management was willing to do was give it to me for free. Wait a second I have been waiting for over an hour and now all they wanted to do was to take it off my bill??  Somethings not quite right with this. Poor service, poor manager, the only thing good was the company I was with."
Wayne M.,"Camarillo, CA",0,10,,5.0,11/11/2013,Went to Applebees based on an ad that veterans' entrees were free today.  My wife and I went to see a large crowd waiting outside. Wait was about 30 minutes (45-60 minutes were estimated by the hostess) and service was fast and courteous.  Veteran's menu had good selections.  I chose the chicken pasta and my wife enjoyed the salmon on the regular menu.  We shared the triple chocolate cake dessert which was excellent.  First free meal I ever had as a veteran after 28 years of service.  Well done Applebees for thanking our vets and families!
C W.,"Camarillo, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/20/2011,"My family is happy that Applebee's in Camarillo is back and open. Haven't eaten there yet, so this is future review, but will soon. Hours are 11am to midnight or later. So this is great for you guys who are looking for something late since most restaurants in Camarillo close early."
Lynn N.,"Camarillo, CA",209,91,35,2.0,8/17/2011,"I heard Applebee's reopened and went there because I was planning to go to Souplantation but forgot my coupons. Now I remember why I didn't go to Applebee's much before it closed. I just don't like their food. Most of the menu doesn't appeal to me. I got some BBQ pork sliders today that were so dry and salty, it was like eating not yummy beef jerky in-between bread. The fries it came with were old and kinda stale, getting cold, and also extremely salty. I drank 2 glasses of water but was still thirsty. However the server was nice."
Dan M.,"Santa Barbara, CA",206,8,5,1.0,8/9/2012,Great is honestly Just OK.... Garlic chicken pasta is REALLY BLAN. Not a good choice on menu. I will probably pass on coming back to Applebee's
Wes E.,"Camarillo, CA",12,75,7,4.0,3/9/2012,There staff is very friendly and energetic. I enjoyed there 3 apps and as always the best thing is there towers mm-mm. I will be back soon.
Andrew M.,"San Diego, CA",1683,346,600,4.0,7/13/2012,"The food is alright, on the same line of Chili's...the bartenders were very nice and the drinks were made well, plus each night at the bar they have different special, such as industry night, ladies night, margarita nights n the such! This is a relatively new location, and only one of two still open."
WM P.,"Camarillo, CA",6,11,,1.0,3/14/2014,Don't even want to give it one star. We tried so many times to have a decent meal there. Not once did we get one. Awful.
John K.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,39,18,2.0,1/17/2009,"The economic downturn is doing a serious number on franchisees in Camarillo and perhaps in the rest of Ventura County.  Now we're saying good-bye to Applebees which announced closures of their four VC restaurants including this one in Camarillo. Haven't been a fan of Applebees, but it's disturbing to see the trend as Coco's and Sizzlers have also decided to pull out of the area."
Alicia M.,"Lompoc, CA",1,9,2,1.0,7/4/2012,"Worst customer service iv ever experienced! Our waitress was missing half the time (she was so rude) and when I went to get a drink from the bar the bar tender asked where our waitress was and said ""I guess I can help you!""  We will not be going back!"
Barbara W.,"Vacaville, CA",7,36,,1.0,9/19/2013,"Average food. Burger/ fries were cold. Service was extremely slow,  under staffed."
R N.,"Camarillo, CA",0,15,,1.0,7/17/2011,"We received a gift card for Applebees and decided to try the reopened Applebees here in Camarillo, CA.   I am giving it a 1 due to the poor service provided by our waitress and the food tasted like it was a pre-frozen dinner reheated, like the dinners you find in the freezer section of any grocery store.   My husband's Fiesta Chicken was barely warm, and my stuffed meatballs in marinara suace was so spicy and acidic I wasn't able to eat it.  The waitress never asked if we want more tea and even though she saw my plate had been barely touched she didn't ask if there was a problem.  Her attitude was she really didn't want to be there.   The waitress that delivered our desserts was awesome and the shooter  desserts were yummy.  My forecast is they won't be open long by the standards I saw on 7/16/11."
Arnold W.,"Irvine, CA",710,1580,989,3.0,9/22/2008,"Should I be yelping ""chain"" restaurants? We came here because the wait at Wood Ranch was over 45 minutes (maybe I should've waited). The service here was horrendous. Even though the waiter was busy, it was still unacceptable. They didn't give us the soup/salads at the same time, and they forgot and screwed up my mom's order. Enough about service, I yelp primarily for the food. The steak was surprisingly cooked VERY WELL, nearly PERFECT!! If the quality of the meat was Morton's/steakhouse quality, it would've been 5++ stars for the way it was cook. Props to the chef! S/he deserves a raise!!"
Eric V.,"San Diego, CA",11,31,,5.0,7/23/2008,"Overall, I had a great time. The waitress, Taylor, was really nice. She was very good about keeping our sodas and waters full and catering to our many requests. For an appetizer, I ordered boneless wings with orange-teriyaki sauce. They were pretty good. Luckily, I shared them, or else I would have gotten full from that. For the entree, I had the Double Crunch Shrimp and french fries. Justin C. didn't order that because, in his experience, restaurants short you on the shrimp. I had the same feeling, but I ordered them anyways. The amount of shrimp I received was abundant. I even took some home, partly because of the appetizers. The best part of the meal was the strawberry-mango frozen margarita. It's tasted so good, kind of like a Jamba Juice. I have to learn how to make those. I'm sad that we only gave her 15% tip. Applebee's has always had a special place in my heart. My last couple of Applebee's visits in San Diego have been just satisfactory. I am glad that this visit has rekindled my love for Applebee's."
Dave G.,"Oxnard, CA",0,11,,2.0,4/10/2012,Do these guys serve only reheated frozen food. I think so. this is generic American mediocre restaurant food at its finest.
Diego V.,"Long Beach, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/2/2013,"I must say that I've been a fan of Applebee's for a while, service is always good but this last time I really had a bad experience, I ordered steak and it was way over cooked, Sheela (our server) quickly put a new order, a manager named Tim (supposedly a manager) took the steak to the table with some sort of apology, when I had my steak at my table another girl showed up with another steak, I was already fine with my ready to start eating and all the sudden without even asking this guy Tim took me steak and took BOTH back to the kitchen to make sure it was the right steak...are you serious?!! Anyways when he got back he had the nerve to ask me if everything was okay, I said that it was fine just for the fact that I was going to eat by myself and he said...""well at least they cooked it again for you""...I swear a couldn't believe it, I told the waitress the story in a funny way and later when I was done he came back again to ask me if I wanted to take the leftovers home...there was NOTHING to take other than pieces of grease on the plate, that's when I thought he was just making fun of us and I decided to take the time and write this for people know and hopefully management of this restaurant know how stupid this guy is."
Marisela A.,"ASTORIA, NY",72,45,1,4.0,7/11/2011,"We decided to stay in Camarillo and have a little summer beach weekend so when it came to dinner time we wanted to eat somewhere we knew would be a safe bet and decided to check out the local Applebee's.  We definitely made the right choice.  This location has recently reopened and the restuarant looks nice from the outside and the inside.  There's a very friendly staff and our server was great about refills and kept the beer flowing.  I ordered Margherita Chicken which came with piping hot garlic mashed potatoes and mixed veggies.  My boyfriend ordered the Asiago Peppercorn Steak and was prepared just right with plenty of spicy peppercorns for that extra kick.  We also indulged a tiny bit with the Triple Chocolate Meltdown and it was everything we had hoped a rich chocolate dessert to be.  We even saw a cute little bunny in the grass when we walked out to our car.  What else can you ask for in a restaurant?  It was a great experience and it really hit the spot.  Next time you're on the 101 and you're looking for a good place to refuel that's also open late, you won't be disappointed at this Applebee's. =D"
