Mike T.,"Camarillo, CA",32,14,2,1.0,10/15/2015,I've been to this Applebee's multiple times. The quality of food has gone down hill horribly. My wife and I had one alcoholic drink each and a main course for dinner. It was a $60 bill. Paying $60 you would expect at least decent food with decent presentation.  The food was absolutely horrible. We both had to replace our initial order because it was terrible. The second choice we ordered was also terrible.  The service was totally fine. The staff has always been welcoming and the manager was welcoming the customers. The cooks at this location need to be replaced.  My wife and I will not being going back and will not recommend this restaurant.
Tiffani H.,"Camarillo, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/19/2016,"Horribleeee service would be an understatement for tonight. To start... My server barely introduced herself, or even said hi for that matter.  No personality, no smile, just a server who came across very rude right off the bat. After we waited about 30 minutes to order, she brought me a refill of the wrong drink). Didn't check on us once during the appetizer. Once we got our food (which was served in a decent amount of time, by a different server) she didn't check on us once! Oh, and she forget part of my meal too.  Anyways, during the entire meal and not once did she think to ask us how the food was or if she could get us anything. And she walked by us numerous times!!!  Towards the end, I had to ask the manager for a take out box, because again she was no where to be found. When the bill came, I told her I had a gift card, and asked her what to do and she said she didn't know. I asked her ""well.. Can you ask a manager?"" And she rudely walked away.  She dropped the check off at the table after she figured out how to pay the damn bill, and didn't say thank you, have a good night. Nothing.  Now, I usually am not one to complain but as soon as I left I asked to speak to the manager and told him about my horrible dining experience (on my son's birthday, mind you) and he didn't apologize for the behavior or anything. He did say thank you for letting him know but that's as far as that went.  Very rude and very unprofessional.   I have been to this location a few different occasions, because I love the food, but unfortunately I always have pretty shitty service. Tonight topping it all.  But, this was my last time. Thank you Applebees for ruining my dinner experience with my kids, on my son's birthday! Word of advice for Applebees.... Hire better servers.  Word of advice for future diners.... McDonald's would give you better service than here."

Lynn C.,"Port Hueneme, CA",26,60,44,3.0,10/13/2015,Dinner was a little cold and meat a little over cooked.   Asked for red potatoes and got mashed.  Still good.
Cheryl L.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/2/2016,"Food was less than average, surprised as I had eaten here a few years ago, I had the Chinese Chicken Salad, the dressing was definately off, my hubby had a hamburger, it was extremely dry. The worst part of the entire meals was one of the waitresses proceeded to VACUUM the floors as we were waiting for our food, I had to get up and explain to her that yes we were offended by the heavy dust in the air. Took 20 mins to get a warm up/refill of my coffee, WE WON'T BE BACK!!"
James S.,"Oxnard, CA",140,21,4,2.0,7/28/2016,"I must start out by saying that my server, Casey, was incredibly professional and sweet. That's where the good experiences stopped. I ordered an iced tea and it tasted like there was dirty dishwater in it. I didn't notice anything in the smell but the flavor definitely had something foul in it. I asked my server to exchange it comma which she did thankfully. I ordered a chicken dish on a plate that burnt my hand. I believe it was the manager that brought it out to me and he did warn me that the plate was hot comma but I didn't realize that it would be scolding hot, and fresh out of the microwave. What I really don't understand is how nice slab of gelatinous chicken, which most likely comes in Frozen, could have been pink on the inside. I ate around it, and inspected every piece I ate to make sure that it was fully cooked. The mash potatoes and the onion strings as well as the chicken all had a very bad chemically aftertaste. I was originally planning on ordering and dessert with my dinner, but I didn't want to risk getting yet another bad day. I'm very thankful that they were open so late at night since I work late, but at this point McDonald's taste better. I would even go as far as saying that shriveled up 7-Eleven hot dog would have been a more tasty and satisfying meal."
Michael M.,"Port Hueneme, CA",1,12,2,5.0,8/29/2016,Always treats us good. We usually come in with a large group after our church service and they always take care of us even though it's getting close to closing time for them.
Jonathan H.,"Oxnard, CA",3,4,1,4.0,9/27/2015,"We haven't been to Apple Bee's in a while; primarily because their menu was very limited and the food felt overpriced for what you actually ate.  But kudos to Apple Bee's for upgrading their food AND drink menu. We went during rush hour 5PM. And we got great service from Brandy! She was on point and delivered fast service as she knew we were on dinner break from work.  She recommended the Sangria (with Jack Daniel's blends) and its probably the best Sangria I have ever had. It wasn't too strong nor too weak, it was perfect. But it does creep up on you so be careful! But it's a must!!  Not only did they upgrade their food styles, but their staff is much nicer and happier. Their bartenders are just skilled in what they do! Great job guys! Cheerios!   PS. The bartenders are plain handsome!  Food Dined during visit: Savory Cedar Salmon Jack Daniel's Sangria Chips & Salsa"
Chelsea R.,"Camarillo, CA",1,31,32,1.0,12/29/2016,Been here multiple times and have yet to have a pleasant experience. The wait staff could use a bit more training. Not very welcoming. The food is ok.
Dee V.,"Ventura, CA",0,21,3,4.0,1/28/2017,"Love the food & drinks , wasn't to happy with the waitress she only asked us once if everything was okay half ways done with our food .wasnt to happy about that"
Youri Y.,"Oxnard, CA",734,529,863,3.0,1/26/2013,"First time at Applebee's last night and it could possibly or possibly not be my last lol My friends and I came for their happy hour at 5:30pm but to our dismay, we found out that their happy hour ends at 6pm haha. We still stayed and just ordered a lot of food during that half hour interval. I've always wanted to try their margarita drank with the upside down corona because it looks like a good way to start a fun night lol It was tasty and not too strong which I liked :) Potato spirals were delish especially with their dipping sauce and sliders were beefy. The french fries were okay and the nachos were meh.  One of my friend's boyfriend ordered a steak plate and his proportions came out really small. However, he said the steak tasted pretty good so I guess that made up for it? Applebee's knows how to cook their steaks then lol Well I just want to go for their dranks next time :)"
Benjamin D.,"Camarillo, CA",72,21,6,4.0,10/26/2015,"My wife and I usually come here after 9pm for the half-price apps and happy hour. Service has always been great. The servers are all very friendly, even late in the evenings. My wife always points out the bartender/server who looks like Liam Hemsworth from the Hunger Games! I've only taken a way one star because they've changed their happy hour pricing this year for smaller portions and slightly higher prices."
Ricky D.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,18,29,1.0,4/8/2016,Where do  I begin. Ordered a Steak and got a rubber  alien phetus with plastic wrap indentations. All that as some hoochie mamas ordered baby champagne  cocktails while thier single mom kids were baby sat by the wierd uncle.  This is America on a stick. My kids ate veveeta colon blocking cheese macaroni.  Last time in this life time will I eat these food experiments.
amy l.,"Camarillo, CA",0,24,44,4.0,11/10/2015,I always enjoy to eat in here!! The combination is really big deal!! Always happy with services;)
Robin F.,"Camarillo, CA",95,21,3,2.0,12/24/2015,"Coming in two hours before closing on Christmas Eve is a recipe for disaster, and this meal was just that. My friend and I ordered classic cheeseburgers with fries. The burgers came, and I was stunned by how small they were. Then I noticed that there was nothing but the meat and cheese. The waiter must've caught my look, because she asked if we wanted the lettuce, pickle, tomato, and onion that was supposed to be on the burgers! We told her yes!   When the lettuce and stuff came, we asked her to please bring mayo and mustard as by then we had noticed the burgers had no dressing of any kind. She seemed surprised we requested it, but she eventually got it to us.  All the while, country Christmas music blared from the speakers. Super annoying.  The food was actually good. The fries were crispy, and the burger, though minuscule, was tasty.  The service wasn't horrible. The waiter was nice, she just seemed out of it. Everything was just a little off, a little weird. More like the night before Halloween than Christmas."
Juliana J.,"Venice, FL",1081,164,688,3.0,8/24/2015,Their service is not very good and they have messed up my order a few times but the reverse happy hour which starts at 9pm is totally worth going to. The wonton tacos with some Tabasco are really good and the spinach dip is also very good. I also recommend the quesadilla. I went for the reverse happy hour and spent $35 on 5 people and we gorged! Great deal! The low cal food is also good and reasonably priced. Definitely not a bad way to go for low cal dining. Check out their desserts also very good. It surprised me too I didn't expect Applebee's to be this good especially since I didn't think it was good when I went years ago. If the service was better I probably would have given four stars.
Jennifer M.,"Camarillo, CA",12,13,,1.0,9/6/2015,"I am not even sure how the food, and I do use that word very loosely, can even be served!  I don't think they do any cooking on the premises, exceot maybe for salads.  I pictured all the frozen food coming from a central kitchen in ahh..Hoboken and then reheated in Applebees all across America.  I had some sort of mystery riblets which were old and dry like when you forget about the take out box of ribs in the back of the fridge. This is a good example of why the USA gets such a bad wrap about food.  This is shameful stuff!"
Lorri M.,"Oxnard, CA",1,56,2,1.0,9/2/2015,"I work close by, had a gift card and thought i would give the restaurant a chance. I haven't been here since  they reopened but overheard a customer at my workplace comment how good his burger and fries were. Ordered two burgers for hubby and I and the waitress/bartender was nice enough to point out about a free appetizer special. Yay! Greasy, nasty mozzarella sticks!TGIF has good ones. Unedible plastic cheese. Burgers arrived, looked good, but after a few bites, rare inside after ordering them well done( no pink). They too were not good at all along with the tasteless fries and over battered onion rings.  Told waitress and mgr Tony came by to apologize. We didn't want new food but maybe a discount or a free beer would have been nice.  The only thing good was our server and the beer. A complete waste of money!"
Martinez Family M.,"Ventura, CA",0,29,15,4.0,11/24/2016,This is a well organized restaurant great customer service the food is delicious  and the vibe is fun great family restaurant
Keycee D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",444,524,2877,3.0,9/5/2012,"I decided to take my cousin here a month ago after shopping at the Camarillo Premium Outlet since she mentioned that she's never been to Applebee's before.  I've been to the one in Alhambra just for drinks and appetizers a few years ago and thought the place was okay. We walked in and got seated right away. My cousin saw their 2 for $20 deal which came with 2 entrees and an appetizer which was a good deal (at least i think so!). We got the mozerella sticks for appetizers; it was pretty good, I mean it's mozerella sticks! Cousin got the 3 Cheese Chicken Penne which was pretty good. I ended up getting the 7 oz Sirloin steak, which was shockingly not that bad. *Service was just okay."
