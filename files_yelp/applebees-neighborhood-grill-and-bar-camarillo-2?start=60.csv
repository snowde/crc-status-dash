Jesus S.,"Ventura, CA",11,21,11,2.0,8/16/2015,It's been roughly 8 years since I have stepped into a Applebee's. The menu was different and unique. I Ordered there Triple Hog Sandwich And I was blown away by how tasty the sandwich was. The food was really good everyone in my party enjoyed it & there drinks.  The problem is the service. Servers going through the whole process like a bunch of robots. They can't smile and or show any facial expression as if they were enjoying any part of helping you. In the future I can see servers be replaced with the mobile pos they have a tables. I will probably stay away for a while. The food was excellent but the service makes is going to make it really hard to come back.  I almost got up land left yesterday. There was 4 tables in whole restaurant and it took our server 4 minutes to come to table and greet us from the time we got sat down. I counted 9 different employees that were working at time.
nicolas m.,"Oxnard, CA",6,26,9,1.0,5/27/2016,"Bad service, we waited way too long when there was MANY open booths and tables available,we ended up leaving because it took so long and nobody said a word even though waiters clearly saw us leaving. Very disappointing, if I could give them a worse review I would. -100/10"
Charlene F.,"Camarillo, CA",86,103,37,1.0,3/8/2015,"Nothing good about this experience. The waitress was rushing us to order. She kept asking if we were ready while we were clearly reading our menus & again while I was answering an important  phone call  & clearly talking on the phone.  Food was awful. We ordered several appetizers & they were not good. Spinach dip was decent, wontons were cold, chicken tenders were tough and the ""ranch dressing"" it was served with was sour & tasted rotten. The snores dessert had uncooked marshmallows on top, not even warm. The churro was tough. Tried to order a kids side of fries, they won't do that. Must order a basket. Shes barely 4, she can't eat a basket.  Got a table full of appetizers & the waitress seemed put off by us asking for plates, I know, what a pain.  The restaurant looks nicer but the service & food quality were awful. I don't recommend wasting your time or money."
James L.,"Camarillo, CA",64,21,10,3.0,1/15/2015,"Went to lunch with a friend and ordered our food, drinks and appetizer. The drinks came. She ordered a virgin pina colada. It wasnt blended thoroughly...shouldnt have to chew on ice pieces.  Appetizer we ordered was the spinach dip. It wasnt very good. It tasted as if it was reheated...very bland. Next our food order comes to the table by a different server and our server Sophia M. dropped off our bill as soon as the food was brought to us. We didnt even take our first bite yet. My friend finally was able to tell her that her virgin drink wasnt done right and didnt want it. It was taken off our bill. The food was decent minus the appetizer and drink. Next time we wont go in the afternoon if we can help it.  Will have our friends serve us that we already know will give us better service. Over all we rate the experience 3 stars."
Jessica S.,"Camarillo, CA",129,117,45,4.0,3/15/2015,"Food was absolutely delicious. wings with bones were 5 stars! I asked Tyler to ""sell"" me on getting the French onion soup. He just said it's good with cheese and bread.  I got it because I would've thought about it the whole time. My husband says 3 stars overall 2 on his wings. Drinks and final check could come faster. But I left very happy."
Dana B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,1,2.0,11/28/2014,"Left there about 10-15 minutes ago, very disappointed.  Restaurant was near empty yet the waitress was never brought a drink that was ordered when we first sat down  The first timr we reminded her she just smiled and said ""oh ya...""...but no drink ever appeared. The next time she was reminded;  she siad that she was waiting on the bartender.  Guess she didn't realize that we had been watching bartender, who wasnt even close to being busy. The waitress just screwed this one, and couldn't even take responsibility for it. This is one restaurant that we will not be returning to."
Cameron E.,"Camarillo, CA",2,11,,5.0,4/6/2016,"Great food, great ambience. Line's are pretty much out the door all the time, but that's for every Applebee's.  Ask for Justin, he's the Best in the West as far as servers go. He's so down to earth and legitimately cares about you. He's also a very successful chef so he knows exactly how to describe flavors, medium/medium well, etc."
Esmeralda P.,"Inglewood, CA",2,1,,4.0,3/7/2015,"Went there last night and it took a while to even get noticed by the hosts, we didn't get greeted at all. We started off at the bar top, I didn't catch this bartenders name but she had long blonde hair and I don't know if she had a bad night but she came off with an attitude and I felt like she didn't want us there. I'm a server and even on my worst nights I'm polite and do my job professionally.  Anywho we stayed and got served by I believe this lady named Veronica she had darker hair, and let me tell you she was great! The only reason I gave this place four stars. Despite being incredible busy she was super polite and just an overall great server! Thanks for making our night better. You rock :) If I ever would come back it would be for her service."
Matthew S.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",0,16,,2.0,3/25/2016,"Well It had been a while since going to an Applebee's and we had a gift card so what the heck. I wish I would have regifted the card. Starting with the hostess, didn't talk to us at all, just expected us to follow. We got a few appetizers and one was ok, the cheese burger egg rolls, pretzels were not good, and green been were fried in old oil. The fries were super greasy. My wife had some weird chicken dish that looked like it was a nice blend of ingredients but came out as a half cooked weird dish. The only reason they got 2 stars was the mixed drink my wife ordered was perfect and very strong, but I guess that's on purpose..."
Xavier L.,"Oxnard, CA",0,5,,5.0,3/13/2016,"Naomi is the best.. so kind, so attentive and so caring. Love her, go see her. Service was great"
Dianna K.,"Calabasas, CA",13,153,91,4.0,11/24/2014,"Had the thai shrimp salad and turkey sandwich combo. Very tasty. Server was attentive and kept our water glasses filled. Many new menu items. Salted Carmel pretzel bites for dessert, yum."
Ash I.,"Camarillo, CA",3,48,12,1.0,5/11/2013,"So my family went to dinner here and unfortunately I couldn't make it. My mother ordered me a cheesecake because I was stuck at work and was craving some. She asked the waiter if they had cheesecake, they only had cherry cheesecake and she asked if they could make it plain for me since I wouldn't be home til later. Waiter was nice and said they could just not add the cherries. That was fine.  Until she actually got the to-go box. It came in a round container that you get at Asian restaurants for your to-go rice. Inside, it was much worse. It was a clump of cheesecake mushed together. The lid didn't have anything on it, so obviously they just squished it into the container or something. I guess she didn't look at it until she got home.  She warned me it probably wouldn't taste good by the looks of it. Being the person I am, I wouldn't let cheesecake go to waste and just toss it. I ate the most I could of what was inside, maybe a bite or two with the spoon they gave us in the bag. I have chunks remaining and I honestly am afraid to eat the rest. Usually Applebee's is a great place, but I have no idea what they were thinking when they gave my mom this. I have uploaded pictures for people to see."
Kioni H.,"Oak View, CA",3,10,8,3.0,1/30/2016,"Second time here, started a weekly trend coming every Friday or Saturday since it's just a few miles up the road from my job with coworkers. Service is great and we never wait long for our order. Food is also great! The first time I had a chicken salad and shrimp pasta which is one of my faves! This time I ordered their ""All Day Burger"" which has hash towns and a fried egg which is pretty good BUT I gave them 4 stars because although it was okay it was very bland..moist but bland..like literally had no seasoning, no taste at all.... AND I ordered onion rings instead of fries and they literally gave me 5 onion rings and I'm not talking about the huge onion rings that restaurants can get away with giving 5. No their onion rings are small and to top it off have like no onion in them and were very hard, didn't taste fresh at all but they have pretty good cocktails. Last time I ordered a blackberry sangria which was pretty tasty and this time I ordered a sunset margarita which is now one of my faves and AppleBee go to's for now on. So my only complaint would be ..I wouldn't go to Apple Bees and order a burger anymore and they could be a little more satisfying with their portions although it's enough to fill me up I didn't pay for a meal for 5 small hard onion rings. This trip a little disappointed but overall it's pretty good with great service."
Yvonne L.,"Oxnard, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/29/2015,"While the waitress was pleasant that is all that was good about the experience. The food took forever and was substandard. We ended up leaving without eating our entrees, and we were really hungry. Thankfully they did not charge us."
Stefanie E.,"Camarillo, CA",0,9,1,2.0,9/4/2015,This use to be one of our favorite family restaurants to go with out kids. But recently the services just hasn't been great like it use to. Seems like it takes forever for orders to be taken or filled anymore. Unfortunately we don't go in very often anymore.
Beth H.,"Camarillo, CA",9,22,8,3.0,12/5/2015,What can I say about a chain location. You definitely need to try the new menu!! Great server hence the three stars! Ask for Amy if she is available!!!
Geraldine C.,"Avondale, AZ",43,33,9,1.0,4/22/2014,"First time at a Applebee's out here in Oxnard and can I just say that it will definitely be my last. I thought it was convenient since it was right across the street from the outlets, but boy was I wrong.  First off my husband and I had to wait to get seated when there were clearly seats available. Finally after 15 minutes of waiting and bringing it to the hosts attention that there were seats available, we got seated.  Not to mention that when we got seated we had to flag down a waiter to finally get drinks ordered but by that time we already knew what we wanted. I ordered their classic cheeseburger and fries and my husband ordered their chicken strips.  We got our plates rather quickly and once we started eating we knew why. My burger was very pink in the middle and both my husbands and I's fries were cold and unseasoned.  We tried to address the waiter but he kept saying to give him a minute and that he would be back. After a few minutes and seeing him take care of a few other tables before us, we decided it was time to go. We let the host know what had happened and he let his manager know and the manager kept saying we had to pay the bill before leaving. The manager clearly didn't want anything to do with the situation and clearly just wanted to get payed. After arguing with the manager for 10 minutes my husband and I got half off our bill and we left. Very hungry and very mad.   This place is the worst. We will not be coming back. Bad service, unfriendly staff and even worst food."
Peter C.,"Pasadena, CA",4,131,105,4.0,9/26/2012,"Didn't think I end up posting a review of a chain restaurant but, I wanted to put in a good word because we got really good service. One personin our party is in a wheelchair and they took the extra time to put two tables together and get it all setup right before seating us. The manager came by a couple times to check on us two.  The food was good too. My wife and my dad just ordered the Chicken won ton tacos that were just the right size for them as they weren't too hungry. They were very tasty and quite clever. My mom liked her steak, my brother-in-law liked his blackened tilapia and I finished my chicken fried chicken. My sister and I both ordered the dessert shooters were are a great idea for when you want a small dessert.  This is a great choice if you are with a group of people and want a variety of things to choose from. A good choice for anyone visiting the outlet and want something with more variety than the food court."
Erin M.,"Camarillo, CA",99,117,24,4.0,3/19/2013,I find i really enjoy my time here! The lighting is nice. Their 2 for $20 is beyond a great deal....Service is a hit or miss though. **Once got one server who went above and beyond and added chocolate sauce to our coffees! It was his suggestion. And awesome. ^-^ Downside is they don't have many coupons offered here which would be needed when ordering from the regular menu.
Laurie B.,"Camarillo, CA",12,7,3,2.0,4/20/2014,"I am so embarrassed. I recommended Applebee's in Camarillo to two friends from out of town. They gave me a terrible review of the service on Friday, April 18, 2014 at around 5pm.  There were so many servers yet they were so busy chatting and laughing at the Hostess station as well as by the bar that they didn't have time to give a menu nor acknowledge when obvious eye contact was made by my friends.  Throughout the whole meal they were not treated guests but as an inconvenience. They had to ask for water three times as an example.  They did report the drinks and meal were good but the service ruined the experience.  Sad thing is, they left an 18% tip. How will these servers learn the business?  I would've left a dollar (a penny in the old days) under an overturned glass of water, but I would've felt bad for the buss boy."
