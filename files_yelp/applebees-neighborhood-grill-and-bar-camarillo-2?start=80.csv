Freddy H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,4,,2.0,1/17/2016,Overall great customer service but horrible food. Pretty cookie cutter flavor with no real effort into it. The waiters were great but the quality of the food just diminished the place. Would never go back there again
Daisy A.,"Oxnard, CA",1,18,23,1.0,5/9/2015,"My boyfriend and I went to this location today it wasen't busy. We sat on a booth our waitress was horrible she rushed us to order and then when we were really ready she never came back. She would check all the other tables except ours. Really rude waitress. We order the appetizers 3 for $12.50. When we got them besides the fact that we waited like 35 min to get them they nasty. The artichoke was salty, yuck the chips were stale and the chicken wings were hard and chewy. Horrible experience worse time there. We even had a harder time trying to leave cuz she never checked on us to get our check to pay. When she did she was over charging us and we confronted her and she said ""oops gave u the wrong check"". I will never go back there. Ever!!!"
Marissa O.,"Camarillo, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/10/2016,worst experience I've ever had in my life. Sat and Waited for over 25 minutes before getting greeted by a server to get ignored for another 10 before we got drinks And when another server dropped off food and could clearly see that our glasses were empty she didn't do anything to help out. Team work!
Skyler P.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,26,20,4.0,9/7/2014,Love happy hour  also the chicken won tacos are awesome  other then that some drinks n salad are all I always end up getting here!
Zach P.,"Camarillo, CA",1,12,,1.0,3/25/2015,"I feel dumb when bothering with a large scale restaurant. But this place is horrible. Once I got the complete wrong order, usually wait over an hour for food. They served me my burger with the cheese paper in it. The server was clueless.... Actually asked me if I wanted "" my steak pink or not not that pink "" when I said well.... She had to spend 15 minutes finding out what that was....I could keep going.... Just horrible...... But there is one great best bar tender ,I wish I knew his name.... He was amazing"
Tanya R.,"Camarillo, CA",50,6,4,1.0,11/21/2014,"I am writing this review as I sit here in Applebee's  Camarillo right now and let me tell I'm very disappointed in the service. They had us waiting for 15 minutes, before my server showed up .The customer service is bad ."
Anna L.,"Los Angeles, CA",60,20,38,5.0,3/26/2015,"Me and my boyfriend came in exactly a week ago. It was late and we were coming from the beach. And we felt like having apple bees. We had snacks already and we didn't want much. So we were definitely looking towards appetizers! Lol we couldn't decide so our waiter suggest alil but of wat we agreed on which was wings, chicken tacos, and ribs! We absolutely loved it all!! I had also ordered myself a martini and a sangria!"
Jingli J.,"Heywood, Australia",0,8,,4.0,8/14/2014,"Great service and friendly banter. Loved the spicy Asian buffalo wings, chicken wontons and beef sliders. Sangria and margaritas are great and a fun start to dinner. Very clean."
Monica E.,"Oxnard, CA",0,7,1,1.0,2/14/2014,"I went in today with my husband for valentines. We have never been there before and decided to try it out. I asked for the strongest drink, which the server Tylere suggested Long Island, it tasted good but not strong at all. Such a disappointment. We had the 2 for $20. I had the pasta and my husband the sirloin steak, with boneless wings. The wings were good and crispy but the food was the worst I have ever tasted. Plus when I asked for parmesan cheese and red chili pepper, the server came back with black pepper and some ugly grated cheese. My husband didn't like his steak with the veggies and rice. Never coming back again."
Candace B.,"PANORAMA CITY, CA",195,279,2578,2.0,12/14/2014,"Wow, this was a disappointing visit. So we spent the morning shopping at the outlet and recalled all the commercials we've been seeing advertising the burger, I mean who doesn't want a good burger. So we popped in to check it out. It was pretty packed but we were seated quickly because we didn't mind sitting in the high chairs near the bar area. The waitress came right away, Sophia, pretty, nice and super sweet. She explained that appetizers and drinks were half price (football season). We ordered the burgers straight away along with drinks. The drinks came right away but 45 minutes later came cold fries and burgers with no condiments (dry). We immediately called over the server to feel the food, my boyfriend was playing with the fries lol and she called over the manager who personally took the food back to the kitchen and they both apologized. After about fifteen or so more minutes my man was like forget it. The people next to us, who were there before us, still hadn't received their food either, so we decided to leave. He walked out and I called over the server to pay for the drinks. Soon after the manager came and told me they were comping the food, packing it up and she apologized again for the wait and the service. The two stars are for the manager and the server. I'm glad we didn't pay for the food, it wasn't good. The sweet potato fries were hot but half cooked so yuck. The burgers were bland, needed some taste. And who doesn't put mayo or mustard on a standard burger. There was no lettuce tomatoe nothing. Like I said, I'm glad we didn't have to pay for it. Should have known with a two star rating. That was my third and last time giving this place a try."
Dow L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,36,,1.0,1/27/2015,"This is by far the WORST Applebee's. My sister and I went there for lunch and both hers and my dish were so salty. Our food took so long to get to our table. I ordered a strawberry lemonade and that tasted bland. Avoid this location, you will be disappointed."
Rosemarie R.,"Agoura Hills, CA",7,22,19,1.0,8/3/2013,"Do NOT ever GO to APPLE BEE'S  Worst food ever . I would rather go to McDonalds a million times over then ever step foot into another AppleBees .  Horrible customer service !  Horrible food! I ordered salad w ranch and croutons . - SENT that back . Ranch tasted like it was out of hidden valley bottle from store. Croutons nasty as s$*# .  Then ordered lemon Parmesan shrimp with rice under their healthy menu items . Took one bite of shrimp and sent it back immediately . It tasted like frozen rubber bands.  So I sat there and ate my baby's French fries . To top it off , it wasnt cheap !!!! Rip off for poop It was honestly the worst restaurant experience I've ever had ! I'm sorry to be such a. B I T C H.  But honestly it was worse then hospital cafeteria food . ( I actually like hospital food) lol at least it's healthy !!!!!!"
Karmina R.,"Ventura, CA",3,28,1,2.0,11/2/2014,"Awful! I will NEVER recommend! We waited about 20 minutes to be seated even though there were at least 4 visible tables ready. We were seated near the bar which was fine but the bar tenders who were our servers were the most inattentive and rude servers I think I've ever had. When we sat down there was a couple complaining to the manager about the service so I guess I should have taken it as a hint that the evening wasn't going to get any better. And our food-well we were better off going to a drive through. When the check finally came that's when the server was nice only because he wanted the tip, I'm sure. Needless to say I will not be returning. Thank goodness we had a gift card and didn't actually pay. I couldn't wait to get out of this place! The only reason I give 2 stars is cause I didn't see cockroaches!"
Lindsey L.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,3,1,5.0,4/22/2015,My boyfriend and I come weekly for the awesome service and spinach artichoke dip! Thank you Tyler.
Jack F.,"Ventura, CA",130,481,1084,3.0,2/17/2009,"I was not a fan of giving my hard earned dollars to Applebee's because of less-than-stellar food & service, but that doesn't mean that they should go & shut their doors. Yelp HQ advised of closure."
Jonathan S.,"Camarillo, CA",3,7,2,1.0,10/22/2014,"So many things went wrong. I arrived at 5:45 I was instantly seated which was good but we were waiting on one other person so we ordered the drinks and waited for our last guest but happy hour was about to end and we told or server to put our appetizers in. Now when she said that ""if you don't want us to put the order in right now for the appetizers you can wait until your last guest arrives and the will still be charged at happy hour price"". Ok that's great but when our guest came we put the order in and we wanted to add one more appetizer for them, the server then said that we would be charged full price. So I asked to speak to a manager which he understood quickly and that matter was resolved. When our food had came we ordered our dinner, at about 6:00, and as the other appetizers came out at about 6:15 I was thinking ok 15 minutes for our appetizers. That's ok because it's busy. Within the next forty five minutes the server came by twice both times to refill our drinks which had been empty for five minutes each time. At 6:45 we asked for the check and to just asked for the food to go because it was taking too long. I asked to speak to the manager a second time and I told him we had bee sitting down for an hour and haven't even gotten the food that we order 40 minutes ago he apologized but did nothing about it. Didn't take off a drink or the birthday dessert for my two year old she didn't get sung to or enjoy her ice cream or her corn dog. We received the food at 7:00 and the manager tried to give me a 10% off coupon but I told him I wouldn't use it because I would not be coming back. We got home and our food was cold and packed to go very half ass-like because food was just thrown into the containers. Overall satisfaction with my visit is about a    .3/10"
Bill L.,"Camarillo, CA",0,4,,2.0,3/13/2015,My wife and I we nt to Applebee's last night and ordered some food.  I ordered  the half salsa Verde shredded brisket nachos that did not have shredded but cube meat.  They arise after my wife order and they were cold.  The waitress named Paige  Just Threw Her Orders On The VAR QND The almost Slide Off The bar.  Also she sat at the end of the bar and played with her phone.  I would not order the nachos again.
Kent T.,"Ventura, CA",1,4,,1.0,12/12/2012,"No.  No.  No.  If you're thinking about coming here, just DON'T!  Not sure how I got wrangled into having dinner but I'm going to be honest - it was one of the worst meals I've ever had. I was hoping to avoid a sodium/fat overload so I went with the simple grilled steak and veggies. Steak had definitely been frozen at some point and was tougher than an old boot. Again, the veggies seemed like they were frozen and dethawed. They all tasted the same and not like the vegetable they were supposed to...  We had a dessert - the triple chocolate meltdown. I had one bite and thought I was going to be sick. It was an undercooked, goopy sugar blast that ultimately ruined the rest of my night.  Avoid at all costs!"
Noelani M.,"Camarillo, CA",6,139,140,2.0,11/28/2014,After a day of shopping Applebee's sounded like the perfect place to relax and enjoy a meal. That being said the food was awful!!The chips from our appetizer tasted like bug spray. The same bitter after taste from our entrees. Our sever apologized and indicated that it may have been the oil. In addition the manager came over to address our concerns and waived our appetizer. I can definitively appreciate his concern. Two stars for service and ambiance. Both of which I appreciate but great service and lighting does not make up for a lack of quality and taste. This place makes In N Out look like a five star dining experience.
Jessica A.,"Oxnard, CA",1,9,1,5.0,1/23/2015,"My husband and I went for lunch. With the not so great reviews, we were expecting bad service. Honestly we had some of the best service we could've gotten. Our waiter was very attentive. He even  brought us our refills when our drinks were low. Before we asked for a refill."
