Tim W.,"Papillion, NE",19,9,2,4.0,11/20/2017,"We decided to try this location again after about a year. The last time we tried it I had a bad experience with my meal. I should have taken a picture at the time and shared it. After seeing the latest commercial featuring steaks, I figured it was time to see if things had improved. Service and food quality were way better! The quantity for the price is my only complaint. I ordered the 6 oz sirloin and it looked like 3 oz. It did taste great so I'm giving 4 stars."
Aaron T.,"Newark, DE",34,21,2,1.0,9/29/2017,"This was a horrible experience. Everything was well in the beginning. 30 mins later our party of 6 got 5 meals (one guest still missing their meal). Add ten more minutes (40 minutes later) and one person in our party still hasn't received their meal. They only got a house salad. A burger, mozz sticks and two orders of boneless chicken wings came out before a HOUSE SALAD. This is absurd. A salad is easy. The waitress barely attended to us. I asked for honey mustard and it took 20 minutes. The manager didn't seem to care at all. She said she will comp the salad. Whoopee, because our guest never ate it. Our party should have gotten more of a disclunt because we waited patiently to eat until all of the food was at the table. All of our food got cold waiting for a salad that never came.  Applebee's has gone down hill and it has been like that since the past 6 years. The chain is over. Time to review the game plan. The service is horrible and you aren't treated with respect. After I got the honey mustard the waitress threw the plate of honey mustard on the table. The waitress' name is Cieara. Its ridiculous how horrible the service is. Something needs to change here. Management or corporate needs to step up. Applebee's is falling fast. Every Applebee's I have been to has been a disappointing experience.  Our waitress said she was busy when there were only two other tables she was working on. And, it took 20 minutes to receive water when our waitress said she was going to get it for our party guest. Please pardon the brevity. Sent from phone."
Max G.,"Dover, DE",13,30,24,2.0,1/1/2018,"There's nothing particularly wrong with this place except it's a chain. I'm very very biased because I hate chains. They buy food frozen in bulk open up a bag throw it in the oven and charge you 14.95. The server was really nice. We had a gift certificate, and so we really didn't pay for our meal so we tipped him 20 bucks. He tried to return it, but said something about him and his character. We had to explain that it was his tip. I always figured that if I got a free meal I might as will tip the server really well. There was a sensation that we were slightly rushed, and I'm sure that's because the servers have to flip tables really quickly to make any money.  The bartender did not know how to make basic drinks."
Sammi M.,"Camden Wyoming, Camden Wyoming, DE",28,2,,1.0,11/6/2017,"Just sat with my family of 5 for 10 mins waiting for a server to greet our table. 10 mins. In that 10 mins everyone that worked in the front of the house walked by our table, including the manager. We decided not to waste our time or money on a place that can not greet you in 10 mins. The place wasn't busy at all. We watched 3 servers sit at the bar fixing their hair. Really, come on people."
Jennifer I.,"Felton, DE",0,34,1,5.0,9/17/2017,"Second time we have been in 2 weeks and had the best/same waiter as before. Our waiter Deric is awesome, highly recommended! Always asked if we needed anything, even when are drinks were low constantly filled them without question. Food was great too, but service was even better!"

Jose O.,"Felton, DE",134,6,1,1.0,9/5/2016,"Good evening, I went to have dinner at your Camden Delaware location because it is the most convenient accompanied by my family.  We asked for our food that included a two for $25 meals that were a 6oz. and 8oz. steaks.  Both steaks were overdone and cold although we had asked for them to be cooked medium-well.   My daughter asked for boneless wings with barbecue sauce.  This food was also cold.  My other daughter ordered a super kids meals with shrimp.  Her shrimp appeared over cooked as well.  I complained to the waitress and she discussed it with the shift manager who asked if I had eaten the steak and she did not even bother to visit our table.   They offered to give a $10.00 discount.  However, I did not eat the meal.  Therefore, it should have been removed from my ticket.  I will not recommend this restaurant due to the lack of service and ill prepared food.  All the while, there were only about 25 guests in the entire restaurant. !!! Don't GO There !!!"
Jesse A.,"North East, MD",17,219,75,3.0,2/1/2017,Just so-so on everything. Not much to tell really since Applebee's food and service isn't the greatest.
David C.,"Dover, DE",0,4,,3.0,7/10/2016,"Wife and I went there for lunch today. Both had the 6 oz. steaks. Both medium rare. Her's was beautiful, mine looked like it had been frozen first.  Good taste but grey. One so so meal in 3 years is not so bad. The staff, as always, was terrific.  Clean and bright atmosphere."
Brenda B.,"Magnolia, DE",37,47,61,4.0,7/22/2016,"Love their french onion soup.   Burgers are awesome,  especially with a fried egg on top.  Pair this with an Arnold Palmer and I am good to go."
Brielle Z.,"Clayton, DE",102,1,,2.0,8/28/2015,"Although the food didn't suck completely, my friends & I will not be going back. Service was horrible. And the restaurant was nearly empty. There had to have been at most 6 tables that had people at them and yet it still took 45 minutes for our waitress to put in our food order and bring us our check after asking for it. Not to mention her not checking on us at all. What if I needed another drink? She would've never known if I didn't pull her aside from standing there talking to her friends."
