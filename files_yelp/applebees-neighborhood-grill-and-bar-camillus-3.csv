April S.,"Syracuse, NY",8,44,2,2.0,2/25/2016,Went today with a friend for lunch.   We got the new cheeseburger egg rolls which were so hot we both severely burned our mouths.   I like hot food but they were scalding.   I asked for a no pink burger and it came out almost raw.   My friend took some Mac and cheese home for her husband and it was completely greasy and separated.   The only thing that was decent was the service.   Our server was very nice and attentive.
Karla L.,"Saint Augustine, FL",0,2,4,1.0,7/7/2016,"Been sitting in entry for 5 mins.  Not a soul came to greet or seat me...a female employee showed up. ...never spoke to me...greet me say hello, are you waiting for someone. ...no eye contact smile or ANYTHING.  I AM WAITING FOR SOMEONE BUT, I WOULD SIT, HAVE A COCKTAIL. ...REALLY? There is a restaurant on every corner. ..? ? ?"
Carlos L.,"North Providence, RI",0,12,8,2.0,4/4/2015,The steak was rubbery and the shrimp was bland. The veggies were bone dry. The only thing that was good was the mozzarella sticks and Long Island ice tea
Cindy R.,"Syracuse, NY",2,6,,2.0,10/1/2016,"My husband and I went there last night. We tried a couple of other places first, but the waits were long (it was a Friday night in Syracuse; good luck finding a table anywhere) and we were starving.  Applebees was our last resort, and there was absolutely no wait, in fact it was pretty dead in there. We were seated right away, the service was fine, but the food not so much. We ordered the nachos for an appetizer, my husband had the philly steak sandwich with fries, and I ordered the south west steak salad. The beef on the nachos wasn't seasoned at all. My husband's sandwich was extremely small, as was the portion of fries for what we paid.  The salad I ordered might as well have been just tortilla strips with dressing on them, because that's basically all it was- super heavy on the tortilla str. It was also supposed to be a mixed greens salad, but consisted of mostly ice burg lettuce. The steak was marinated okay, but extremely gristly. I feel like we got hosed; the price we paid for the food was outrageous versus what was served to us. I guess for a chain restaurant, I shouldn't have expected any more. Their new and improved menu, isn't so improved. We won't be going back anytime soon."
Steve L.,"Syracuse, NY",33,276,28,1.0,1/4/2014,The worst of the worst. The battered fish was all batter and most of that was oil. The service was appalling. This is a complete waste of time and money. Avoid like the plague
Emmy T.,"Webster, NY",72,38,15,4.0,2/6/2011,"I go here often and the service is normally really good. The manager, a gentlemen, really goes out of his way for customers and is always very friendly whenever I go. The red apple sangria is awesome and decently priced as is everything else. Clean restaurant, friendly waiters. I will definitely continue to be a repeat customer."
Chris K.,"Syracuse, NY",0,11,,1.0,8/30/2012,"Been there 4 times and won't go back.  You get your food......it may be a correct order or not and once you get your food, get ready to hear the waitress ask you every 10 minutes if you need anything or is things are fine.  Very,very irritating, it only made me leave early and they will not get my business again."
