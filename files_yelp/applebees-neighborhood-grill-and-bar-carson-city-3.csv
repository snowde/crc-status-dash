Nicole M.,"Fresno, CA",3,30,10,5.0,11/9/2017,"Good service, accommodated our large party of 12 within 15 mins on a busy Friday night. Server was excellent. Had the Southwestern Steak salad and it was delicious!"
Michelle F.,"Reno, NV",30,123,356,3.0,11/9/2016,"Under whelmed with the visit. Evey Applebee's is identical inside...somehow didn't bring a sense of comfort. I must admit we stopped by.on our drive just for something light. Hubby and i shared the fish and chips. Delicious fish, sadly over salted fries and delicious coleslaw. My son had a combo for $9.....chose black bean soup and the cheeseburger egg rolls. Just okay and the soup was solid with no liquid.?? Now i suspect we should have tried their 2 for $20 special....think that was a mistake on our part. The price for the food we received seemed too high.  Not sure we would go back."
Kristy R.,"Carson City, NV",20,73,257,4.0,2/11/2017,"Always down for Applebee's! I love the brew pub pretzels with beer cheese dip as an appetizer and the Thai shrimp salad is awesome! I like their two for 20$$ , you get an app or salad and two meals! It is clean and friendly service!"
Kelly E.,"Reno, NV",28,95,12,3.0,8/22/2016,I mean...its Applebee's.  The food is generally good and the service is average.  The only reason I come here occasionally is for the 2 for $20 deal and their lunch combos are a good deal.  But definitely not a vegetarian's first choice of restaurant lol!  Try the Thai Shrimp Salad- it's fantastic!
Shere B.,"Seattle, WA",91,67,96,1.0,8/15/2017,"Oh Applebee's. I'm so disappointed in you. The experience this even has been horrible.  To the point that I'm physically sick. First, as I'm walking to the bathroom, I almost slipped and fell. I literally was waiting to fall backwards flailing my arms around and smack! My head hits the tile floor.   Luckily I have great balancing skills which allowed me to stay on my feet. Lol! Second, as my partner is opening up her menu, she starts to get this odd look on her face. She opens up the menu and (no joke) there were nose (?) hairs/clippings. There were so many. We called our server and she was even grossed out by it. So the manger came over to check on the tables and we informed him of what happened. He said he was sorry and explained that the servers clean the dessert menu thoroughly but not the main menus. He did comp the dinner, which was very nice. However, we will not be returning which sucks because they have great drinks and good food."
Anastasia B.,"Palm Desert, CA",2,7,2,5.0,11/2/2017,"Stopped by for a beer on a lazy Thursday afternoon after a morning filled with errands and housework, it was 3 and happy hour!! I got the coldest modelo especial ever!! The bartender Jacob was super entertaining, he should be on a stage somewhere doing stand up!! I had the beer pub pretzel appetizer with yummy cheese dip!! Totally enjoyed my beer and appetizer! So I am going to order another coldest beer ever and stay awhile longer!! Well done!"
Andrew S.,"Santa Barbara, CA",5,4,3,2.0,11/16/2016,"Beer was cold so that was good. Mozzarella sticks were more ooie then gooie but hey let's not forget what I am here for. The salt and pepper grinders.  Brand: McCormicks. Same grinder style that one could pick up at your local Kroger brand store :)   NSF approved? I think not. In a world where everyone is so conscious of political correctness it's nice to see something against the grain. Applebees taking a risk and doing what they want how they want not giving a shoot. Service is about what you expect, adequate, been here for 30 min and still waiting for a smile. Our waitress I formed us that they have gift cards. (A promotion Applebee's implied: if there is a failure to suggest a gift card you get free ooie mozzarella sticks) she said if she didn't say something she would lose her job. What a thrill. Tomato Basil soup and and Fajita roll up. Chicken Fajita roll up excuse me. It's what's for dinner. First sip of soup, the kind of warm of soup you would serve your grandmother. Your grandmother who has ms and can't hold onto her spoon so well so you only make it semi warm so if she spills on herself it won't burn her. By the last bite my soup was cold. Salad croutons, I would say, classy touch. Check arrived, assuming I didn't want another beer to wash down my feelings of regret. (Check was wrong btw) Chicken fajita time. Uhh where is the sizzle? Why does it taste like Taco Bell? Why does it come with authentic thousand island dipping sauce? And why have I not gotten a new napkin yet?  Turns out I ordered the wrap which comes pre wrapped so... no sizzle. I wonder if I'll have to visit the bathroom the same way in 25 min as I do when I I eat a beefy 5 layer. Thousand island is a traditional dipping sauce south of the Reo Grand turns out. Got my napkin after I asked, thank goodness. Paid my check via automated  Table tablet FlaCarte. Server told me to use it... she is a busy woman.  All in all... great American dining experience. 2 starts."
Claudy H.,"Carson City, NV",156,394,5247,4.0,5/23/2015,"We have had lunch here a couple of times and I forgot to write a review, so here we are.  For appetizer we ordered boneless chicken wings with sweet Thai chili sauce. It was good sauce but not spicy at all or maybe not spicy for me as my husband says that I can drink fire lol The chicken cooked perfect, tender and the battered not too thick. I ordered a chicken lime, it came with rice and colorful tortilla strips. The chicken was perfect, seasoned nicely & the top with melted cheese. The rice was a bit bland but it was good if you put Cholula My husband ordered grilled chicken penne and again the chicken was perfect & the penne was good too plus the cream was creamy. Plus it was under 600 calories h The dessert was a strawberry cheesecake shooter and sprinkle with graham crackers & whipped cream, it was so delicious.  Service was nice & friendly."
Michelle S.,"Carson City, NV",0,7,,4.0,4/10/2017,"Always very good. Got car side to go and the cooks had forgotten to make baked potatoes that day, they gave us free desserts and apologized for the inconvenience and for the wait, which really didn't seem that long. Sweet potatoes are amazing!"
Rick L.,"Carson City, NV",39,152,218,4.0,9/26/2015,Came for lunch with my wife and daughter. We had appetizers and shared a burger. It was very good. Server was very nice. Place was clean and comfortable. One thing I like is when they refill your iced tea. They bring you a new glass. I prefer that over server taking your glass away and getting it mixed up with another person's drink.  I come here for lunch sometimes for business. It is always good and a safe bet for what you will get. They have a wide variety of menu items. For everyone.  Monday's they have burgers for 6.99 not a bad deal.
Thera M.,"Minden, NV",0,13,,1.0,7/28/2016,"This place is a joke. They don't deserve any stars. Went with my family. We left because our food never came...waited for about 45 mins then said laters... They weren't even busy. So I'm not sure what was taking them so long.  Ugggh I couldn't post, I had to give a star....."
The Patriot 1.,"CA, CA",0,57,3,2.0,8/20/2016,"Food is pretty generic, and not really remarkable.  I eaten there several times, and have been unimpressed.  Service is ok, but that really doesn't matter since their food is pretty forgettable.  Prices are fair considering the generic food. You'd probably be better off going to taco bell, so long as you're close to a toilet after you're done eating it."
Kelly B.,"Wellington, NV",105,97,105,1.0,9/20/2016,"Oh my gosh . What a comedy of errors.  Horrible service, horrible food, my friend sent salad back , gristle steak.    My steak was over cooked, fries were cold.  Will never eat here again.   Cook takes no pride in their food.   Disgusting.  What a joke.  Took 90 minutes for staff to finish. You can't go there in your lunch hour for sure.   Avoid this place."
Darla D.,"San Dimas, CA",166,885,685,1.0,8/16/2016,"Now that I have a few minutes to add to my original review I hope this helps when deciding to come here. It was nice and quiet when we walked inside. We were seated right away. Then of course it all happened No excuse for that type of rudeness and conduct! You can read on my original review. It is such a shame because it seemed to be a decent applebee's and now it just changed my opinion on the restaurant chain itself. I know we all have bad days but what happened to the saying, Leave your drama at home. Oh well!"
Diana H.,"Zephyr Cove, NV",312,132,428,4.0,11/11/2015,"This place was incredibly busy today. Despite them being slammed, service was fast and flawless. 4 stars for the food. It was exactly the fare you would expect from a neighborhood restaurant.  Place was clean and well maintained. They accommodated my dietary requests which is a big plus when I eat out. Overall 4 stars experience for a quick bite between lunch and dinner.,"
Ryan K.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,,5.0,10/16/2016,"Very good folks working here Phone broke while traveling and I needed general derections to Vegas Even though I wasn't buying anything all the staff was very helpful, Araceli even went to the computer and printed directions for me off google maps, which was more than I asked for or expected.  Great staff, wish I could have stayed for dinner as I'm sure their service is on par! Thanks again"
Kam M.,"Gardnerville, NV",2,121,41,3.0,12/2/2015,"Tonight we went for their new $10 menu.  We had the loaded beef brisket enchiladas and they were delicious, so I would definitely order that again.  We also had the Grilled Onion Sirloin in stout gravy and I definitely would NOT order this again.  The steak had no flavor at all, zilch.  I had to load it up with A1 just to enjoy it.  The potatoes were good though.  In the past, we've gone during the 2-for-1 appetizers timeframe and you can't beat that deal.  Good service, mostly good food."
Mike L.,"Reno, NV",0,9,2,2.0,5/13/2016,"Should have checked reviews before parking. 20 minutes for drinks and 45 minutes for food after ordered. Steak probably cooked that entire time, we had ordered medium.... Manager took off $10 for the over cooked steak even though it was a $20 plate. Waitress had a million excuses why our experience was far from great. Our kid wanted a steak cooked medium too but his came out well done and more gristle than chewable meat."
Chris C.,"Milford, OH",3,398,35,3.0,9/14/2014,"The waiter was very good.  He communicated with us often and well, letting us know the status of our orders.  I wish I remembered his name, it could be Jacob.  He gets 4 stars and the food gets 2 stars. The food was OK.  I tried the ""new"" salad:  Arugula and romaine lettuces are tossed with sliced strawberries and zesty chili lime vinaigrette, then layered with slices of grilled chicken breast and chunks of creamy avocado. There were a few tiny bits of strawberry and a few chunks of avocado.  The lettuces seemed fresh. The piece of chicken was grilled nicely but wasn't very big either.  I'd prefer a raspberry vinaigrette if I ordered this again, but I probably won't."
Bar J.,"Carson City, NV",24,29,7,5.0,6/1/2016,"Ate at the bar last night. Bartender was Elisebeth. Great bartender, great service. Tried the new menu. Amazing! Will be back!"
Ray L.,"Carson City, NV",132,43,75,5.0,8/3/2015,Thank you Marcie and Sara for going above and beyond here at Applebee's another wonderful meal the steak was cooked perfectly and the oriental salad was great thanks again!!
E L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,155,278,2.0,8/19/2015,"This Applebee's needs to pick up the pace and serve food at an acceptable temperature.  The service was ridiculously slow and everyone at our table was served COLD food!  From the time we entered this restaurant to the time we left, the whole ordeal took well over an hour.  All I ordered was a cup of soup and when it was served to me, it was cold!  Tasted like someone had microwaved it and allowed it to sit for 15 minutes.  It wasn't even lukewarm.  COLD!!!!!  Someone else at our table ordered a steak with a side of mashed potatoes and vegetables and their entire meal was also COLD!  We also ordered the churro smore's and that was also COLD!  Is it really that hard to serve warm food?!?!"
Lindsey M.,"Sparks, NV",0,20,,1.0,3/13/2016,"Food was Horrible, expensive, rubbery noodles, runny Alfredo, cold meat, cold shredded cheese on a cold potato with no butter or sour cream, I could go on. Service was slow and the place was not busy. Manager took off the meal I sent back and was nice about it. We will not be back. Avoid."
Mike D.,"Tonopah, NV",3,10,,1.0,3/21/2016,"They have a small amount of room in this Resteraunt, yet the young lady doing the seating puts everyone next to each other. It lets you enjoy everyone else's conversation along with your own. I realize if it's crowded you have to do this, but, when it's not, a quiet meal can be very nice. Service and food were very good, only the ambiance lacked at this meal"
Tim A.,"Pollock Pines, CA",0,21,,2.0,3/13/2016,I ordered the brisket enchiladas for dinner and literally looked and tasted like a TV dinner.  Rice was almost rubbery like it was leftovers and nuked.  Guess I should have sticked with a simple burger!   Service was good so I put the two stars.
Renee S.,"Carson City, NV",2,117,,2.0,8/15/2015,"It is what it is. Service was good though. Went there for fish and chips. Menu says hand dipped white fish deep fried, served with fries and coleslaw.  Ok, hand dipped by some food distributor , ie Syco , or American Foods, frozen fries and at least the cole slaw was fresh.  Not worth it. The redeeming factor is the service and cleanliness of the place."
Sybil B.,"Damascus, OR",0,2,,2.0,3/12/2016,When we arrived we were told there was a 10 minute wait even though there were at least a dozen empty tables.  The hostess explained they were letting the kitchen catch up.  I had to ask to be seated and spend the ten minutes in a booth rather than the entrance.  Bad form
Gidget C.,"Camarillo, CA",0,3,,5.0,2/26/2017,we love Applebee's fish-n-chips.  everyone's wonderful.  our waitress Clare was so much fun.  took great care of us and was fun to laugh with.  thank you.
Grace H.,"San Francisco, CA",3,24,,3.0,6/19/2015,"Our waitress, Chelsea, provided great service. It was also dog friendly at the beer garden area which was the most important criteria because it was so hot on our way to Tahoe and we couldn't leave them in the car."
Wayne D.,"Carson City, NV",0,717,163,2.0,1/31/2013,"I'm writing an update because we had lunch here instead of dinner, and Applebee's has unveiled a new electronic device which is destined to change forever the restaurant landscape. Yes, my friends, I'm talking about the Ziosk Electronic Waiter Replacer and Dining Experience Enhancer.  With this little baby, you can order any item on the menu by merely choosing them on the touch screen. You can even pay your bill. There's no reason to even HAVE a waitress unless it's to actually bring you your food, and I'm sure there's a drone they're working on for that. The Ziosk doesn't ask you if you want water fifteen times, (""Really? No water? C'mon!"") and it doesn't continually touch you when it talks to you, which is more than I can say for the waitress. It doesn't seem to screw up your order either.  Unfortunately, it doesn't do any of the cooking. But, you know, they whip it out pretty fast. Mediocre but adaquate food, served quickly-- thanks to the Ziosk D.E.E."
Sierra R.,"Silver Springs, NV",14,42,,1.0,1/18/2016,"VERY disappointed. Me and my boyfriend took my dad out last night for a sobriety dinner and the place was pretty busy. We were seated right away, and that was basically it. We didn't notice that however, the waitress hadn't even asked us about drinks. :/ The family that had just come in behind us was already getting their orders taken and had drinks on their table. My dad instantly stood up and went and complained to the first employee he saw, and finally a waitress came to our table and made a hasty apology and took our orders. We definitely did not leave a tip. On top of that, my dad ordered the All-In burger, which came out to be the size of a mcdonalds burger. With the fries being a not so generous helping either. Same with my boyfriend's meal was very small. The food also wasn't very good, I'd say pretty basic. Definitely will not return."
Neuy D.,"Chicago, IL",36,403,3,5.0,3/19/2012,"I've grown defensive of chains lately and find myself going to more just so I don't feel pretentious. I used to look down on them until I moved to Reno and started to miss all my chains back home. Just because I only wander into them a couple times a year doesn't mean they don't have their place.   Overall,this revisiting of chains has been a pleasant surprise. The service tends to  be better than in a lot of local places which for me is big part of my dining experience.    There is a reason there thousands of Applebee's. It's consistently good food  for cheap. There is the 2 for twenty deal. An appetizer and entree for 2 for 20. Also after 9PM, appetizers are half off.  The highlight,  they are open late. If you want dinner after 9PM and don't feel like wandering into a smoke filled casino, Applebees is your best bet.  We both ordered pasta dishes (I know right in an Applebees?) but were surprised. They were better than many of the Italian places in town.  Next week I'm going to Olive garden."
Jessica B.,"Dayton, NV",0,11,,1.0,10/3/2014,"Horrible food! We went and my husband ordered shrimp and steak with some kind of sauce on the steak (as the menu stated) it came out and was the worst looking food ever the white sauce mixed with some tomatoes to make a disgusting looking mixture and then the steak was under cooked.  When we asked for the manager she did not apologize simply said it was made right and saw nothing wrong with it.  I wish I had taken pictures so you could see it.   Will not return here,  used to love this place but after the managers comments and the quality of all our food do not want to give them another chance.  Dennys has better steaks."
Kodi N Ash H.,"Dayton, NV",41,33,1,4.0,9/9/2015,Been here probably 100 times in the last 10 years. Food is almost always good as is the staff. Wait times are not very long. Restaurant is very clean. I will complain however they are constantly changing the menu and have the most odd bread choices on sandwiches. Otherwise 5 star.
Becki O.,"Carson City, NV",83,9,,4.0,6/22/2015,"The waitress, Janine, was friendly and efficient.  She kept our water glasses full and brought our food quickly.  They had a new menu since the last time I was here with a bunch of new items.  I got the cedar grilled lemon chicken which was very good and just the right size portion.  My mom got the Napa chicken portobello and she thought it was good.  She enjoyed it and liked that she had the calorie count of it."
Colleen K.,"Carson City, NV",141,20,1,2.0,1/10/2016,My husband and I came here for dinner and we tried the new pub diet menu items. I got the cedar grilled salmon and he got the hot shot chicken. The pictures in the menu show a generous portion but when we got our meals I barely had a 4 ounce sliver of salmon with a few green and potatoes for $15.49 and my husband's plate had a dollop of mashed potatoes with a child size piece of chicken for $9.99. I also had a coupon for a birthday dessert so that was the only reason we came here and the picture in the email advertised a Browne bite with ice cream but what we got was a little scoop of ice cream with fudge. We felt like all the items we got was false advertising and left hungry for $49. The manager did give us a brownie bite and 10% off our check but not sure we will be coming back. If I wanted to pay top dollar for food it won't be Applebee's food.
Ed B.,"Susanville, CA",32,55,9,4.0,4/28/2014,"Great service Jacob. Food was good and hot, beer was nice and cold  :) Great place to go when in Carson City"
Baker H.,"Santa Clara, CA",33,5,,5.0,12/28/2013,"At first, I was scared to visit this restaurant since it had 2 star rating only. But we still gave it a shot and I am glad we did. The food was very good. We tried the 2 for $20. For appetizer, we got wings with sweet and spicy sauce, BBQ sauce on the side. For entries, we ordered 7oz Steak (Fries and Mash Potatoes) and Chicken/Shrimp basket.  Our server was one of the best servers we ever had. We even called the manager and told her how great our experience was. The place was very relaxing, and they had nice music (not very loud). They had cool tablets on the table so our friend's kid was busy playing which made our meal far more enjoyable.  I highly recommend trying this restaurant. You won't regret it."
Tim A.,"Minden, NV",1,30,10,4.0,2/8/2014,"Just had dinner tonight and it was a very pleasant dining experience. Our food was served hot and fresh. Our server Leanna R was great as she was very friendly and attentive. My only negative remark would be that the grandkids grilled cheese sandwich's were a bit dry, but other than that, the food was really good and the service was excellent. We will be back!"
Grace J.,"Dayton, NV",5,2,,1.0,1/28/2015,"Ordered the Shrimp Parm Steak a couple years ago- melted in your mouth delicious. Had one about a year ago- it was tough. We ordered three of these last night and they were again an uneatable chunk of grizzle!  I wouldn't feed that steak to my dog! The waitress didn't even ask why I didn't eat it. We should have sent them back but didn't want to embarrass anyone. Not that the restaurant was crowded, I wonder why? They lost another four customers."
