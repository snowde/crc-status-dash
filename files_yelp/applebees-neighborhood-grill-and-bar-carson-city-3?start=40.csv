Thomas E M.,"Gardnerville, NV",214,430,2302,4.0,12/13/2010,"For what it is, this is not a bad stop.  The food was good. My wife and I were both able to select items that were advertised at being less than 550 calories. I had a sirloin steak, with shrimp and a semi-spicy sauce. I had them hold the potatoes and requested extra veggies. They did this, and I enjoyed the flavors. My wife had a chicken dish prepared much the same way, and she enjoyed it.  Don't get me wrong, this is not fine dining. It was a Sunday night, after he prime dinner hour, and we were hungry.  We had a great server. Her name was Joyce, and she was very pleasant and easy to work with. The manager even came by at one point during our meal to see how everything was going.  We would probably come back, and that's the bottom line. A relatively healthy dinner for two at about $24.00"
Alexys S.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",49,16,29,1.0,4/18/2014,I'm giving this place a single start because I have to or I would give this place a negative two stars food was good server was supper rude her name is Debbie she was making rude comments as she would walk away from our table when she delivered our food she told us she had forgotten what we had ordered and then I asked her to cancel the chips and salas and as she walked away she said they are FREE anyways loud enough for me to hear her a few tables distance . Then I ordered a scoop of ice-cream and she was being loud about me ordering a scoop on the handheld computer out our table #14. While I was still having my ribs she came over and said need a box and asked to take my plate away while i was having dinner. I will never come back to this place our hostess was really professional and polite. There's nothing or almost anything this place to get me to come back unless Debbie isn't around.
Alex R.,"Reno, NV",8,10,1,5.0,11/20/2014,Go to Applebee's for late dinners - one of the few restaurants in Carson City which open late. Food is OK. Clean and friendly. I would recommend this place for a nice quiet family dinner.
Donna W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,164,121,2.0,10/1/2012,"We hit this Applebees coming and going on our trip. The first time we went we were oh so tired after a long day driving. Honestly it was not our first choice but Olive Garden had 60+ minute wait, so Applebees got our vote. We had a lovely server, but unfortunately several things we ordered they had ""run out of"", including baked potatos.    The food was adequate and our server was pleasant. Sooooo on our return trip, rather then look for somewhere else to eat after another long day driving we went back. We had what was a new server.  Honestly after a long days drive I am not wanting to train their new employees.  I asked for a veggie burger, to which she promptly told me they did not have them.  Really.  I said how about you go ask  (since they say they have them in little print on the menu) imagine her surprise when she told me they did have them. I ordered a dinner salad as well, you know something that should come before your meal. Whoops she forgot it when she brought all the food.  Whoops she messed up my order also.   I will say the manager did come by and she did take my salad off the check- oh wait I never got it-  and then my veggie burger.  I would have rather had a hassle free dinner and paid my $7. At least this time they were not out of everything."
Bobby P.,"Boulder City, NV",0,10,2,5.0,9/14/2015,"Great place to eat! Applebee's 2 for $20 menu is always filling! Marcy was our waitress, super friendly. She gave me a birthday dessert which was actually pretty tasty."
Brook M.,"Carson City, NV",0,34,,2.0,7/31/2012,"This place to me is comparable with Chilis, except I would probably say Applebees isn't as good as Chili's. It has the same goofy atmosphere and the service is so/so. The food isn't that great but I wouldn't say its terrible.  *Don't order the tomato soup it tasted like weird spaghetti sauce in a cup."
Katy E.,"Carson City, NV",3,103,1,1.0,6/3/2011,"I don't have a ""three strike rule"", only two.  I moved to Carson four years ago and tried this Applebee's twice since then - and I'm NEVER going back. Both time there were rocks in my mashed potatoes.  I don't even remember how any other part of either meal was other than the ROCKS IN MY MASHED POTATOES!!!  I'm not talking gritty, unclean potatoes.  I mean rocks, over a millimeter each.  Gravel might be a more descriptive word, to give you an idea. The first time I went, I pointed it out and my meal was free.  Okay, that works I guess but I really wanted mashed potatoes.   The second time I went, I figured that one time was a fluke and I'd try again.  NOPE!  Same thing - rocks in my mashed potatoes!!  It had been well over a year between my Applebee's attempts and THE SAME ISSUE!  When I pointed it our to the waitress, she actually stuck her finger in my mashed potatoes, stirred it around and said 'Oh yeah, huh!'.  She didn't offer me another plate or anything - not that this was my wish but COME ON! I haven't been back and won't.  If a restaurant has employees willing to dig around in my food for ROCKS, I certainly can't expect them to handle my dental bills when I crack my teeth. DISGUSTING!!"
Dick G.,"Dayton, NV",11,85,,1.0,10/5/2011,"The drinks, wine and fancy margaritas were too expensive. Waiter suggested them...no mention of price. Soup was cold, salad was tasteless. Meals were too long in coming. Waiter stressed. Fish was mushy, steak overcooked. Not coming here again."
Ytangel R.,"Carson City, NV",0,29,28,3.0,1/15/2015,"Really good food usually. Tried the tortilla soup. I've had much better, but not bad. More like goulash. Would not recommend it. On the other hand the place is very comfortable as I was alone and did not feel uncomfortable."
Jessica H.,"Carson City, NV",3,4,1,1.0,9/13/2012,"This place is awful!  Went here tonight with my boyfriend his little brother and his girlfriend. We were sat right away. Then downhill from there. My boyfriend ordered a beer the waitress checked his ID then sent the bartender over to recheck it because she didn't know if it was okay to give him a beer or not. Next we sat there for an hour and a half waiting for our food. (It wasn't even busy) Finally after the food arrived by a different waitress everybody was starving. I ordered the fish and chips. One piece of fish was hot while the others were cold and the ""chips"" were cold as if they had been sitting under a heat lamp for the last hour. My boyfriends steak was bleeding all over his plate. His little brothers girlfriends food was completely cold all the way around. His little brother ordered the steak fajitas which was the only hot food but considering it comes on a ""sizzling platter"" it was nearly impossible for it to be cold.  When informing the waitress that the fries were cold as well as the whole other dish she took one dish back while the fries were cooked then brought it back. The whole dish looked as if it was put in the microwave while it waited for the fries to come out.  After finishing what we could of the disgusting food we sat for another 25 minutes waiting for a waitress to come into sight so we could ask for the check. The waitress stopped at the table asked if we wanted dessert after telling her ""no thank you"" she proceeded to walk away having to ask her for the check as she walked off she turns around and says ""Ya I'm getting it"" in the rudest tone ever.  10 minutes later we receive the check 74.06 for awful food and horrible service. Definitely will NOT be returning to this establishment and will NEVER recommend this place to anybody.  I'd much rather go to Chilli's. At least the food is better and the service is MUCH nicer."
Valerie G.,"Reno, NV",3,42,,1.0,3/21/2012,"So if you order a sandwich and it says MELT...dont ya think that would come with cheese? Melted cheese to be exact. Well...apparenty NOT here! The waitress brings my lunch, when I mention wheres the cheese she says oh,...no cheese. Like whatever lady. She takes it in the back where they slap a piece of cheese on and return it to me. Really? Wow...I go to the AppleBees in Reno ALL the time and it rocks. This was kinda sucky!"
Michele K.,"Carson City, NV",37,20,,1.0,5/24/2012,The menu is not health conscious by any means. When asked to make a substitution for a healthier choice I was denied. The waitress was rude as well.
Diana G.,"Susanville, CA",0,20,3,2.0,7/26/2014,Really mediocre meal.  Had the sirloin steak.  Requested medium rare. It was cut unevenly and one side was rare and other side was well done.  But steak had absolutely no flavor.  My husband had some sort of Asian shrimp salad.  It was tasty enough but came in a huge bowl but hardly any salad.  Come on lettuce is cheap.  We won't be coming back here.  I hate it when restaurants don't put prices on menu for drinks.  Of course the waitress didn't know the prices.
Linda B.,"Placerville, CA",0,15,,1.0,11/8/2012,Will not go back. Waitress was good but silverware was dirty and the food was terrible. Ask for a salad and they bring out 2 mins. later bring out the meal.
Mike K.,"Carson City, NV",0,28,,1.0,6/21/2013,"My family I visited applebees tonight for dinner (6-21-13) and didn't have a great time. My kids ordered the ribs and the ribs where like jurkey and hardly any meat on the bone, then we told our server ( 15 min to flag her down) and she got them more ribs and they where just as bad! My husband ordered the sirloin and it was dry and chewy. Our server was hard to find and never refilled our drinks. The manager never came over to see why we where unhappy. Our bill was over $45 so not worth it! We will never go back to this applebees again!"
S L.,"Carson City, NV",8,363,74,3.0,6/26/2011,"The food is decent, not expensive by any means. We had a problem with a salad and the manager comped our salad. Service is good. One thing that bugs us: the servers seemed to be forced to offer constant recommendations....about 5-6 per meal. These include: would you like an appetizer, a Corona, a side salad, etc. The funny thing is that our server asked us if we wanted a side salad with our larger salad."
Gary M.,"Carson City, NV",5,210,238,3.0,6/9/2012,"had the 2 for $24 dinners, not bad had to send one back as it was the wrong plate, which the bartender seen and stopped the waitress!!  the bartender? well he could use a bit of spirit , I have been to other Applebee's in which the Bartender IS the ONE  who makes the party start!!  He was just wanting to get out early or something otherwise he was just nice.  overall the Manager gave us free desert for the extra wait on the plate that got sent back, and we left happy."
Kory F.,"Gardnerville, NV",0,2,,2.0,7/9/2010,"Although the food is good, the service is AWFUL!! We gave it another shot today because we received a gift card. There were almost as many servers as customers, yet we sat for almost 10 minutes before they took our drink order. It was another 10 minutes to get a refill. The food took FOREVER!!! She gave us our bill when she brought our food (which I hate) and when we were done eating it took ANOTHER 10 minutes for her to pick up the bill and card. Our ""quick lunch"" took over an hour... Not fun with a 10 month old."
Mary D.,"Carson City, NV",9,17,,1.0,5/5/2011,What is with the infestation of ants everytime I go! They have a booth that my family and I have been sat at a particular booth the last two times and it has ants!! The second time we went was months later! Who cares how the food is when there are bugs!
