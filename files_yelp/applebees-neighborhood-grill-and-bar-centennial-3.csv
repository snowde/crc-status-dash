Jordin N.,"Ontario, CA",62,59,8,5.0,10/27/2017,Excellent service and tasty food! I'm allergic to fish & mushroom- (two of the most common menu items) and they were so accommodating to my needs and my meal tasted wonderful. The manager even came over to ensure my steak was being cooked on a different surface and all! Everything was delicious and the waitress was incredibly sweet. Will definitely be back to this location again!!
Leigh A.,"Englewood, CO",233,7,,2.0,12/23/2017,I used to love Applebee's as a whole but tonight was a disappointment all around.  First they said they couldn't sit us at a booth as they didn't have enough waitresses.  Then it took forever to get our food.  Then we saw our waitress talking to everyone as we waited about 10-15 minutes for our bill.  As i type this review we still haven't received the bill.  I don't plan on coming back to this location anytime soon.
Alice Q.,"Denver, CO",2578,1627,6800,4.0,10/19/2017,"Honestly, I wouldn't think of going to Applebee's for anything, but the ladies in the front were incredibly kind and made my night. They completely offered me some free dessert after they messed up on an order and they were angels. The Applebee's isn't the worst, far from that officially. I enjoyed the quick and prompt service."
Rogermuhle R.,"Aurora, CO",0,1,,5.0,12/4/2017,Visited this Applebee's again tonight. Had their two for 20 special. Enjoyed both choices we selected. Our waiter was excellent he did everything possible to make our visit enjoyable. Thank you for the nice evening.
Rowena B.,"Centennial, CO",79,501,1131,3.0,4/17/2016,"We've never been to an Applebee's before tonight and I can confidently say we probably won't ever come back. It's just not really worth the money or the calories.  It's a typical American restaurant where most of the meals come with potato and onion as the veg, there's no other side with veg to choose and all the side salads are covered with bacon and cheese.  The food we had was cooked well, for the most part, nothing was dry or overcooked.  My meal was meant to have mushrooms with the onions but I was lucky to see more than two. But the whole experience just wasn't enjoyable.  There's no drink prices on the menu, we just ordered water till we had time to look at the drinks menu and after bringing out water our waitress (names was something like Casey or Carly) didn't ask if we wanted anything else to drink. She was a bit rough round the edges too, not very professional or anything.  It felt like she didn't really want us there, we'd already explained that we'd never been there before and would need a minute with the menu, so she checked on us 4 times before we were ready to order. We hadn't finished our apps when the mains came out, and while I'm still eating my meal she is standing there asking if we want dessert! I just looked at her and said ""I'm not sure yet"" pointing at my half eaten plate. How rude!! I think she got the point after that because she didn't come back. We just paid and left."
Ender W.,"Littleton, CO",0,27,2,2.0,3/5/2017,"Applebee's used to be my favourite place. That was 10 years ago. Today I stopped by with my wife. We tried the 2 for 20 and couple drinks. She picked Fiesta Lime chicken and I opted for a american burger. We got the chicken for appetizer.  Sauce on the side.  The burgers come in seared. That means you will not see neither onion or pickles on your burger. That was my experience. It was a medium sized bun with a burger and american cheese on top.  I ate whoppers and they taste a lot better with lettuce,onions and tomatoes. That was a serious fail. I do not think I want to eat a burger at Applebee's as long as they sear in my onion and pickle with the burger. Did I mention my burger was burnt? I guess I should not have said no pink. I think I saw a piece of pickle in my meat on my last bite.  My wife's chicken was good but there was too much rice compared to the Chicken. Finally the drinks are good but then other than serving,  I am not sure what else can be said. Wish the Chili's across the road did not burn down."
Cait L.,"Littleton, CO",16,113,36,4.0,2/20/2016,"4 stars because the food is always delicious, especially the Brunch Burger and shrimp salad. Tonight I got the cedar smoked salmon and it was very flavorful. Sue is the waitress we seem to get on a regular basis, and she is amazing. Very attentive, quick, and friendly.  However, the resturant floor was exceptionally dirty this evening, and I'm sure they weren't clocked in or were on break, but it's disheartening when you see employees standing/sitting around when half a meal's worth of food is smashed into the carpet around you. The manager came around to check on us during our meal, which I appreciated. Overall, we really like this Applebee's and the food options are all very tasty."
Sherrie N.,"Denver, CO",4,61,6,2.0,8/5/2017,"This review is for service only, I am not reviewing the food!!  The biggest reason I chose Applebee's was due to the curbside option.  We ordered online, gave the time we would be there and showed up a few minutes beforehand. 5 minutes after the time we were told it would be done, we have to get out of the car to go in and get it ourself (the bartender wasn't even ready with it or even aware as he had to go in back to prepare it)...This wouldn't be a big deal had we not chose the curbside option...the whole point of the curbside is to be able to get food to go in your jammies...isn't it?  I do not recommend the curbside option.."
Nick F.,"Portland, OR",90,14,3,4.0,1/11/2017,"OK, our server was basically the lower talker from Seinfeld... except a man.  I was blown away at how quietly he was able to do everything.  We could barely hear anything.  It was actually so funny that we didn't even mind.  We just waited until after he left the table to imitate him.  If it weren't so funny this would probably be a 3 star review for the service. Besides that, way to go Applebee's.  I was pretty impressed with my meal.  I got a crispy chicken salad and it was huge!  The homemade croutons were great too - kind of a soft crunch.  We split a blondie for desert.  Get the blondie."
Ray K.,"Lone Tree, CO",5,209,414,3.0,6/7/2016,Always a consistent quality of food. I am a fan of Applebee's. The 20$ deal for two is always a good choice. I tried the 6oz sirloin with some veggies today and the steak was not as good as I remember them to be. Will order other dishes next time like their salad dishes are usually good.
Luke R.,"Littleton, CO",0,16,6,5.0,1/28/2017,This Applebees was well kept ( plus the bus boys didn't do one of my pet peeves which is wiping the seats before the table.)  I ordered the appetizer sampler for $14 which came with 4 mozzarella sticks 4 wings of your choice spinach dip and chicken quesadilla. They were all pretty good but i wish the mozzarella sticks came with some sort of marinara and the wings came with more of a blu cheesier blu cheese because it was lacking. The service was ok for how busy it was buy other them that it was overall a good experience .
Mathew G.,"Denver, CO",294,6,,5.0,10/5/2016,"I have to say, holly was a phenomenal server. She constantly refilled our drinks, she made sure the food came out after our appetizers, and she made all of this happen while attending multiple other tables with a smile on her face.  If you go, I recommend you ask for Holly the waitress!"
Rufus K.,"West Richland, WA",0,26,7,2.0,8/27/2017,"I've eaten probably a dozen times total at now 4 different Applebees in 3 different states. I'd actually give this one a 2.5 if that was possible. Got sick of my own cooking in my suite type hotel room so I decided to order ""real dinner"". Ordered the 8oz sirloin med rare. It is, and it is edible, cuts well, not much flavor. Brocolli was fine, gave it all to my dog and she as usual loves it. Maple sweet potato mash is it's usuall yummy self. Parking lot pretty empty so I figure the restaurant inside was too. At the 9 minute mark after the promised Curb to Go delivery time, I actually had phone in hand and was dialing to ask where my order was when the kid ran out with it. The big problem was - no napkins, no silverwear, no nothing. You'd think they would throw something in since it is a TO GO order. Luckily my hotel room comes with a great kitchenette.  Learned my lesson and will cook in room again the next 2 nights."
James H.,"Denver, CO",0,34,,3.0,5/18/2017,"Barring some peculiarity of location, I feel it can be almost a waste of time to review a place like Applebee's, a national chain, because, let's face it, you've made up your mind already. If you want to go there, reading this won't stop you, and if you don't, I doubt my powers of persuasion are sufficient to induce a volte-face. But! Since you're here, and since you asked, and since you're still reading this, here're my two cents... This Applebee's is fine. Went here with my wife a few days ago, a Monday night, for dinner, and we both got burgers, which is a good deal Monday night. Any burger for $6.99. And some of them get a little spendy, up to $11.99 or $12.99 normally. So not bad. We both got the classic burger. I thought it was pretty good. Prepared as requested. My wife thought hers was too ""burgery"". She said the meat really could have used some seasoning or something - it just tasted like ground beef smells when it's cooking. No real problem, just personal preference. The only issue was it took a tad too long to get our food. Also, service was fair. I like a quality check partway through the meal (e.g., ""Everything taste okay, folks?""). Call me old-fashioned."
William H.,"Littleton, CO",0,3,2,1.0,4/12/2017,"I have been going to Applebee's for several years and this was the worst experience I've ever had. I sat at the bar waiting for my order. The bartender only had two customers, he only wanted to watch TV all the time I was there and the bar was filthy.     Food and used silverware was sitting on the bar in front of me, not on a plate just on the bar. probably won't be back. We had a carry out order, chicken strips. The chicken was Ok however there was no dipping sauce in the bag. It easy for them to o I'm sorry about the issues.  Maybe they need a health inspector to give them a visit."
Jafey A.,"Parker, CO",6,397,,2.0,12/17/2016,"We were one of 2 parties there for most of our lunch which is fine with us for a nice quick lunch, but it didn't translate to quick service.  Our server was fine (she didn't seem to be a fan of us just doing the buy one get one free with waters because I hate Pepsi) but she didn't do anything wrong, but for some reason it took a half hour for us to get our two basic meals.  The food was okay (not great like Applebees was 10 years ago) but not worth the wait.  It will be a couple years before we try again."
Ash E.,"Sarasota, FL",36,4,,1.0,2/1/2017,"There is no excuse for how bad this Apple Bees service was. There was nobody in the restaurant and yet, our food came so slow, the order was incorrect, and the server forgot our to go order and then lied about it. Do not go to this restaurant it's awful. We ended up having to wait an extra 25 to 30 minutes for our to go order because of his incompetence. And there was no one in the restaurant. Absolutely no excuse."
Richard S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",10,11,1,1.0,8/17/2016,Very very slow... I waited for 45 minutes for my food and it was sub par at best. The server maybe said 10 words to me.  Just not the best experience.  I wish I would have gone to another place.
P S.,"Littleton, CO",0,7,,4.0,8/20/2016,Generally good service host staff is very kind. Bar tenders have consistently produced very strong drinks that were lacking some in the taste department. New food selections are great the steak grill smells up the whole university intersection it is there.
Randy J.,"Littleton, CO",20,294,45,3.0,8/6/2015,"The service is good at this location and the food is your typical corporate menu.  It is also prepared in a typical corporate store manner, but they will customize it if you ask them to do it.  The prices are pretty decent and its a good place to take the family as the menu is dynamic for all.  If you are looking for a decent spot and want to save money then I would go to this spot."
Michael W M.,"Crestone, CO",1,29,18,1.0,7/5/2015,"Service was terrible. Waitress forgot our waters. Then forgot our libations. I spoke to the manager. He apologized but then my salad never materialized, then missing breadsticks. Our wait staff call button blinked the entire meal on that electronic gizmo that is supposed to let you call your staff. The best the manager could do for us was take $9 off. Pretty bad experience. This Taco is NOT for you... !"
Steven M.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,39,17,1.0,12/13/2015,"I received a gift card from a friend so I decided to go here tonight with my wife. We walked in and were greeted quickly. The greeter asked how many in our party and I replied 2. He began walking us toward a table and I started hearing the sound of a screaming baby from the other side of the restaurant. He kept walking towards the sound and eventually tried to sit us as close as possible to this screaming baby. I looked at him and said, ""Nope"". He didn't seem to understand why but I requested a table on the other side of the restaurant and he said, ""no problem"". I realize it wasn't his fault that parents take their annoying babies to restaurants and then ignore them when they start screaming but he should have had the sense to not sit me next to it while it was in the middle of a fit. We eventually wound up at a table on the other side of the restaurant. We sat there for about 5 minutes looking at the menu and hadn't had anyone acknowledge us. I decided that we would leave in 2 more minutes if no one came to the table. We had 3 waitstaff casually walk past our table in that time and none of them even looked at us. Not sure who dropped the ball, greeter or waitstaff, but I didn't feel like dealing with it. So my wife and I left and went to the grocery store down the road.  Normally with this type of service I'd just ignore the establishment for the next year or so but because we had a gift card we needed to use, we decided to call in a ""Carside To Go"" order. My wife called as soon as we got to the grocery store. They asked her the standard questions and then asked what kind of car we would be driving so they could bring us our order when we pulled into the ""Carside To Go"" parking section. We did our shopping and went straight back to Applebee's. That took about 15 minutes which was exactly the time they said it would take to have our order ready. I pulled into the parking lot which I wouldn't call empty or packed. There was only one ""Carside To Go"" parking spot left. On the left of it was a handicapped spot and on the right was a person who is bad at parking their Ford F250. The spot they chose was also a ""Carside To Go"" parking spot but they weren't in the truck. Why don't they stop people from parking in those spots if they aren't getting a ""Carside To Go"" order? I don't think it would be difficult since they are supposed to come outside when someone pulls into one of these parking spaces. It turns out that they don't watch the spaces at all. We sat there for quite a while and nothing happened. We had never used this service before so I asked my wife if we were supposed to call or go in when we arrived but she didn't know. Wouldn't really make sense since they ask you about the car you are driving to pick up your order. After about 2-3 more minutes my wife said she would just go in and get the order. She walked in and came out 2 minutes later. The order was ready and waiting when she arrived.  We got home and ate our wings. 1 order of boneless and 1 order of classic bone-in. After eating we both acknowledged that Applebee's isn't really worth eating at anymore. The sub-mediocre food is very overpriced which goes well with the service they provide. If you are in this area and looking for a decent ""chain restaurant"" to eat at, I would suggest the Chili's that is kitty corner to this Applebee's. I've found that they are far more consistent with service and food quality."
Cyndi C.,"Littleton, CO",11,44,14,4.0,3/23/2015,"We love the 1/2 priced apps. ...sadly took away one star since the new app menu and changes to the discounts that used to be a staple. Hate the new apps: meatballs,  brisket nachos  (taste like a really bad pot roast), tasty potstickers are super tiny but taste good, Kobe ""style"" mini hamburgers that are just okay. Hubs loves the riblets. Service is hit or miss. Never really minded."
Caitlyn W.,"Littleton, CO",1,9,,1.0,3/2/2016,Been here several times and every time service is terrible and food is awful. Never again. Not even other locations.
Brooke L.,"Denver, CO",8,34,2,1.0,10/28/2015,I left my card there and called to pick it up the next day and they made it very difficult to get back. Nobody took that much caution and security when running my card to pay for food but to pick it up was a struggle and a half!
David L.,"Littleton, CO",0,6,,2.0,7/7/2016,"I am a big fan of Applebee's.  I especially like their burgers.  However, twice my family has had absolutely terrible burgers at this location.  As in the worst we have had pretty much anywhere terrible.  We recently visited and had decent food off of the 2 for 20 menu which is why I gave them 2 stars.  We too have found the waitstaff lacking at this location.  We will avoid this particular Applebee's in the future."
Shawn S.,"Denver, CO",16,80,,1.0,7/20/2015,Got the car to go and our order was wrong. The waitress ran inside before we could do anything.
Jordan B.,"Littleton, CO",0,9,,4.0,5/27/2016,Always a good time when Chelsea is working. Have been frequenting this location for over ten years and never had a bad time.
Jimmy J.,"Houston, TX",7,556,100,3.0,4/1/2015,"The service was good enough overall.  Ordered the 2 for $25 special and my caesar salad was alright, but very basic (came with four croutons) and we had to hunt down our own silverware since the waitress dropped off the salads sans silverware, then left.  My (ersatz) old fashioned for $6.99 was fairly strong, so I forgave it for not tasting like a proper old fashioned.  The steak was decent, but was salty.  It came with plain tasting vegetables and mashed potatoes, which were average tasting.  Overall, the meal was what I expected it'd be, considering Applebee's is a corporate chain and not a ""mom-and-pop"" place.   I'd probably go back, but the food is hardly worth going out of my way to go back to."
Denise R.,"Aurora, CO",650,491,905,5.0,10/11/2014,t to start out the service is very good here nice wait staff  food came out very well prepared
Chris T.,"Centennial, CO",0,31,1,5.0,6/14/2014,"Came for happy hour at the bar and was served by Holly, Had an fantastic lunch and a few drinks at the bar. Not a big fan of Applebee's but was impressed with how juicy and fresh all of the food was. Will be returning to this location again to grab a bite and and a brew."
Vanessa R.,"Denver, CO",12,44,12,2.0,6/8/2014,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff,  crappy steak. It didn't even taste like steak and was not worth the 13.99 price tag.  Probably won't be back."
John C.,"Southwest, Denver, CO",121,3,,1.0,10/13/2013,"Stopped in today, sat at the bar since I was by myself. This was the worst Applebee's experience ever. First my app came out undercooked. After that was corrected I sat with an empty beer for 5 mins thirsty while my bartender sat across the restaurant chilling with the other servers.  When the bartender came back to finally refill my drink she got me another beer in the same glass.  Applebee's is known for its neighborhood feel. This one had none. The managers were just hanging out as well no interaction with the guest at all."
Melissa C.,"South Jordan, UT",0,8,,1.0,5/23/2015,"Went to Applebee's and was disappointed to find out they stopped serving regular wings, ""New"" bone in wings are breaded!!! Sadly they could not have left well enough alone. My family and I will not be eating at Applebee's."
Ashley H.,"Denver, CO",26,265,8,2.0,6/29/2011,"My food was alright but my waitress wasn't.  We were sat quickly but the waitress took a few mins to take our order, was slow, and every time she checked on us it was whenever the conversation she was having with the table next to us got boring. That and when she did decide to come check on us she talked to us like we were inconveniencing her. [I hate to break it to her but it's your job to check on us from time to time and be somewhat nice] The food was slow to come to us which I'm not going to blame on the kitchen staff. Our drinks took a little while to get to us and the shake we ordered took almost 10 mins to get to my friend after I was served my drink. Our food was good. My steak was perfectly cooked and nothing was missed or messed up. My friend shrimp were cooked right too and everything seemed alright aside from some ranch missing. By the time we finished I was a little hesitant to pay cash because I had a feeling the waitress would pocket the extra $10 as a tip and not bring me change. It took her awhile to get back with the change but I was happy she did. Over all The food here is alright but I wouldn't want to sit down in this place. Get it to go."
Jed W.,"Littleton, CO",28,61,,4.0,10/1/2010,"This Applebee's has always been a good place to eat.  The food is always of good quality, the servers have always been polite and good, and the atmosphere is nice (not too loud, not cramped, ample lighting). I have had lunch with friends and dinner with the family and always leave happy. The current 2 for $20 is a really good deal and compared to Chili's similar deal definitely better. (I marked price as a 2, but with this deal and if you don't buy a drink it is a 1) 12/17/2010 update : I'm changing this to four stars and here's why. The quality is always consistent, they still have the 2 for $20 and on Wednesday's kids for each for $2."
Anita Y.,"Berthoud, CO",57,311,13,2.0,4/21/2011,"I always wonder if a restaurant can ever recover from a bad review by me.   Is the bad taste (I made a funny!) left in my mouth is just too much? Here we were, back again and on a tight schedule. Sat in the bar, 6:10 pm, we got our food in time, got the drinks (waters all around, it's on us!) got out on schedule, but this place still gets only 2 stars from me. Wonton tacos? topped in coleslaw? No balance of flavor, and I couldn't tell the chicken from the pig. Spinach Artichoke Dip was basically flavorless, and the warmed corn chips had lost their crunch.  My personal taste calls for toasted bread with artichoke dip. Nothing wrong with our server.  She got it all on the table in time for us to wolf it down and run. And she even got my annoying request of ""no ice"" in my drink, it's surprising how many people forget that one short order.... And even though I didn't need or use the knife, I'm going to complain that it was dirty. Applebee's, I don't think you'll ever come out on top with me. If you want 3 or 4 stars, I'd consider it with this: Those who strive to be mediocre are always at their best!"
Mike M.,"Littleton, CO",8,21,,1.0,4/11/2011,"Typical Applebees food. What's not so typical is the bad service. The waitstaff has been pretty bad here every time we go there. If you want mediocre food and bad service this is the place to go.  Our last and I actually me last trip here, the waitress was training a new hire. This was actually the worst service to date. Our waitress passed our table by many time to talk to the sloshed older ladies behind us. I'm guessing she was chasing what she thought was gonna be a better tip. The girl she was training didn't come to the table not once. The kitchen staff brought out our food and got us more drinks. This is not the first time we have gotten bad service here. to be honest its pretty much the typical attitude there.  We have sworn off this Applebees. We now go across the street to chili's. The service is far better and they actually appreciate their customers."
S. J. C.,"Littleton, CO",0,60,,1.0,6/27/2012,"We had dinner at this Applebee's a couple of weeks ago after not having been there in several years. The waitress specifically asked if I wanted my burger cooked through or with a little pink, the inference being that it would be cooked to order. I requested my burger pink. It arrived overcooked, dried out, and had clearly been cooked several hours earlier. I mentioned thiis to the manager. He looked me right in the eye and said, ""Oh, no. We don't ever cook our hamburgers in advance.""  Yeah, right. We stupidly gave the place another chance this evening. Same song and dance from the waitress; same request for medium-rare; same dried out, overdone burger that was probably left over from lunch. I guess they think you're going to load it up with mustard and mayo and won't even notice, but I don't put any of that stuff on my burger so it's pretty easy to tell when it's cooked to order and when it's been cooked hours in advance. It was also about 80 degrees in there. Maybe they hadn't paid the electric bill.  There won't be a third time at this place. Bottom line: If the food at this Applebee's is any indicator, it's pretty easy to see why a number of them have gone out of business."
Steven £.,"Grand Junction, CO",5,97,5,5.0,6/26/2012,This was my first time at this Applebee's and I have to say that it was one of my best experiences at one of these restaurants. The server was friendly and took care of our drinks before we finished them. The food was great and the atmosphere was pleasant. I will definitely return here in the future!
