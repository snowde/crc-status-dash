Sandra L.,"Littleton, CO",60,29,90,3.0,5/26/2013,"I come here only for the Oriental salad. I have tried other things and was never happy. Today my husband and I went for my salad. I saw on the menu they had a new Seasonal Berry & Spinach Salad, Sounded good to me. I ordered it and when it got to the table i looked for the fruit and It had one slice of rotten strawberry and a few skimpy blueberry's. It looked nothing like the picture. It didn't even have bluecheese like it said it has. My husband took it up to the manager on duty and she looked through it like we were lying. The best part of our dinner was my husband ordered the chicken wings bone in and every drumette had the missing leg. My husband brought it to the managers attention and she said I don't know what happened to that one. He showed her it was wrong with every single one. She never apologized or even asked if we wanted dessert on Applebees. Her kitchen was not doing good letting food go out that way! At least my Oriental Salad was good and our service was excelant as always."
Rene O.,"Littleton, CO",6,6,,4.0,2/24/2012,"The food is okay, though we do love the spinach/artichoke dip.  The happy Hour is also good, very reasonable prices.  The reason we keep going back is the servers.  I do not recall ever getting a bad one.  They check on your often, are there quickly when you first sit down, and keep you refilled on drinks.  The few times they were overly busy, and things took longer than usual, they were quick to give us free appetizers and dessert for our wait, we did not even have to ask.  We have been very happy with their customer service."
M F.,"Centennial, CO",0,42,3,2.0,5/22/2011,"This location is consistently worse than average, they way normal Applebee's locations goes.  The management there must turn over too much and I've had too many bad meals here.  I've wondered if they train cooks here, to be honest.  Because it's convenient I wind up there now and then, and most of the time I wished I had gone to Chili's, across County Line Road.  I hate to pay for below-average!"
Jimmy C.,"Denver, CO",6,142,,1.0,8/27/2009,"Wow, visiting friends in south suburbia, it's getting late and want a bite to eat, not so many options so we go around the corner to Applebee's, and, my goodness, what c***!! I knew it wasn't likely to be good, and I've been to Chili's and TGIFs, and so had low expectations, but this was the first time I've been to an Applebee's and, dang America, how has this become a successful nationwide chain? Every last bit of food tasted like it had been prepackaged as a frozen dinner, nuked, and then whisked to our table. Food drained of flavor, and yet packed with fat, it seemed 3/4s of the menu items were fried, I just can't get over what junk it is. Honestly amazed, and yet somehow it draws peeps in and stays in business. Well, too funny, I now know the baseline for restaurants...."
Monica W.,"Lone Tree, CO",0,8,,4.0,6/18/2011,"Great place for early, 3-6 and late, after 9 PM, happy hour, 1/2 priced drinks and apps!  Been there twice, late night, and we have all been pleasantly surprised by great service, good food, and remarkable prices.   Also, a good bar for watching sports."
