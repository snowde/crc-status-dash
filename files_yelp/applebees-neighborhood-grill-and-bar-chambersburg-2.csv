Paul S.,"Madison, VA",8,32,53,3.0,9/8/2017,"A quick bite with my daughter,  but I had my phone on mute.   She'll get back to me... Still, it's a clean friendly place.  I'm going to try her recommendation of Steak and Salad."
Zamfield ..,"Inwood, WV",0,6,7,2.0,11/15/2017,"Jason was a good bar tender... Shame the kitchen let him and the place down. First, ordered 8oz Top Sirloin... Ridiculous! It certainly wasn't sirloin by any stretch of the imagination. Very fatty... Try Chuck steak. Mash potatoe (garlic allegedly!) would have fitted on a table spoon! A lot of mushrooms however. Garlic? Green beans were obviously flash fried. Chewy, cold and didn't taste of garlic! Took it away and ordered the Bourbon Chicken. Better, but still bland. Overall, disappointed with the food. Service was A1 Good atmosphere Clean Change the chef and you'll have a winner."
Paige T.,"Woodstock, GA",0,1,,1.0,11/25/2017,"I want to start my review off by stating the fact that me and my family drove a long and exhausting 7 hours before dining at this Applebee's. All we were hoping for was a nice, relaxing meal to end our night and instead we were given the worst dining experience of our lives.  When we first entered this establishment we were overwhelmed by how loud the music was. It was so loud that we had to be moved to a table in the corner to even hear each other.  Not only was the sound of past ""billboard top 100s"" blasting enough to change our mood, but the constant banging of a waitress sweeping for 30 minuets was added to the unpleasant atmosphere. Lastly the food. I ordered the Caesar Salad (or should I say wilted lettuce with a pound of dressing and two croutons) and French onion soup (aka 1/3 broth 1/3 soggy sliced bread and 1/3 deli style unmelted Swiss cheese).  Overall, this Applebee's was a poor attempt of a restaurant and will not be seeing me tomorrow."
Kevin B.,"Chambersburg, PA",0,1,,1.0,11/23/2017,holy Mollie what a trip probably some of the worst service we ever seen what a joke can't even explain it was almost comical I really think the manager was on either smack or pills for sure but the bartender was cool and the food was not terrible but just ok definitely a last resort
Alesia C.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",0,2,,1.0,10/21/2017,"Customers beware of deceptive drink specials. I met a group of friends at this restaurant the evening of October 20, 2017. We were told that they were running a $1. special on Margaritas. When our server came over,  I wanted to make sure we were given correct information, so I asked her ""what are the specials?"" She mentioned the Margaritas and gave us a $3 special menu. When she gave us our checks. We all ordered the specials. When we got our checks, one of our friends was charged $31.96 for 4 drinks. She showed the error to the server. She responded  ""your Margaritas were flavored so they were $7.99"" My friends told her she never told us that before we ordered. We asked to see the manager. My friends explained what happened and the manager only respond ""the flavored ones take more time to make""  My friend said, but she never bothered to mention that or she would not have ordered four. The manager could have discounted the drinks or offered her something to make it right. She did absolutely nothing. So good time out ended on a very sour note."
J. Keith K.,"East Northport, NY",0,17,6,4.0,9/10/2016,"Stopped in on my road trip home from NC.  Didn't want fast food so have it a go. Amanda the bartender was great food as much much better than fast food. Good choice to stop here. I'm not usually big on corporate restaurants like this, but this was very good.  Thanks Amanda"
Mike B.,"Shippensburg, PA",0,41,,4.0,4/22/2017,"April 22nd, 2017. I stopped in for early lunch. Sam graciously served a Corona Light, the Fiesta Lime Chicken with Rice and Tortilla Strips. As the Germans in Heidelberg say, ""Mittagessen war koestlich!' Lunch was delicious! I will be back."
Chloe S.,"Chambersburg, PA",0,3,,1.0,2/22/2016,"Always dissatisfied with this place!  Years ago, it was a great place to eat...not anymore!  We went here a few months ago, dined in and had terrible service, not to mention the food. We decided to try again tonight with their carside. Food was on time and hot, awesome, BUT they charged my card 2 times for the food.  I sent my husband in to get it taken care of, but they ""couldn't do anything"" until they closed out their registers. Fine. On our way home, they charged my card a third time. We called to let them know that we would need our money back. A ""2 for $20"" deal ended up costing me $60...the manager said there was nothing he could do until they closed the register. Understandable.  I opened a French onion soup I had ordered, took two bites and got a long black hair. Disgusting, but, (again) understandable. Let it slide, but my husband called in again- just to let them know, maybe someone wasn't wearing a hair net.  I then bit into my burger (which I had ordered ""no pink"") ...and it was no pink, because it was red! The burger was literally browned on the outside and RAW on the inside.   We drove back to the store, talked to the manager and $25 was put back on my card... Will be taking this higher up. Very disappointed, not even deserving of this one star!  Ps, we went to The Cottage and got, essentially, the same meal for about $6 less, more food included and none of this bull!"
Al B.,"Chambersburg, PA",31,31,10,4.0,10/16/2014,"Curbside service. Love it!! I get my food without the headaches of slow service, or unfilled drinks. They have done well getting my order right, and it is fresh and still warm when I get home. My inside eating experience is mixed. My food is consitantly good, but service can be good or bad, and long waits for food. As a note to this particuliar restaurant, please have your servers refill empty drinks, there is nothing more frustrating than eating dinner with no drink and watching your server flirt at the bar, chat with her friends, and do all she can to avoid your eye until it is tip time. Your ratings just might improve...the food is good. To patrons: go curbside for good service"
James S.,"Chambersburg, PA",3,15,38,4.0,10/11/2013,I dunno why this place gets talked about so badly. Both occasions i've been there have been met with great service and outstanding food. Check out this newly remodeled location and see for yourself!
Timothy O.,"Greencastle, PA",0,3,3,1.0,4/2/2015,"The most disgusting meal I have had all year. The service was just as horrible. Several people ordered soup but only one bowl was served. An order of meatballs looked like they had been sitting all night and they tasted worse if you could get past the hardened exterior shell. You know how salmon is supposed to be pink - well not at Applebees, they do their salmon ash colored - super yummy - NOT!!!!!  The server must've been aware of the awful food she was serving because we only saw her when she came to collect payment, normally they bug you every five minutes. Highly recommend you go somewhere else for a decent meal."
Becky M.,"Chambersburg, PA",1,9,,1.0,1/1/2015,Food was terrible. Not worth the price. The boneless wings we had as an appetizer barely had any sauce on it. My chicken wrap was soggy and my boyfriend's burger was bland topped with wilting lettuce. Also the service was really slow even though there were only about 6 people in the place at the time. Now I know why. The only saving grace was our server who was very nice and attentive. She was the only reason that we didn't walk out. Really wish we had gone to Denny's down the road instead.
Elizabeth W.,"Des Plaines, IL",276,332,179,1.0,4/21/2012,"Why is this place so busy?!? On my recent visit, there was a wait. It was not an unusually long wait, but since I could see open tables and the waiting area is small and crowded, it was frustrating. I waddled in miserably pregnant, and the host wanted to seat us at the bar. Luckily, another employee intervened and got us a booth so I didn't have to balance my wide, aching backside on a tiny stool. Once we were seated, we were served by a waiter who didn't know the menu, wasn't on top of refills, and didn't seem to care that he brought our appetizer with the meal. He also brought us only half the appetizer, told us they burned the other half and were remaking it, and then brought us the other half when we were almost done eating--still burned. The broccoli in my stir fry? Burned. My husband's burger? Burned (but luckily he likes it that way). The ""garlic bread"" was stale and did not taste like garlic at all. The sauces are too salty. My mashed potatoes were thin like cream of wheat and tasted like they had accidentally mixed a little Duncan Hines cake mix into them. I know that sounds oddly specific, but that's how it tasted. We were also really annoyed by the loudness here. Somebody kept turning up the volume on random songs, so that every third song or so, the baby sitting behind us would get startled by the sudden blast of music and start crying. The poor mother would have to take the baby outside and walk her around a bit, then come in and try to finish eating, only to have her baby startled again a little bit later. Some of the patrons here thought it was karaoke night, so unfortunately, a screaming infant was not the worst sound I heard during my meal. Nobody on the staff seemed to care or feel like they should do anything about the noise level and the patrons who didn't appreciate it (by my estimate, about half the restaurant). Considering the plethora of dining options around here, I can't see myself returning on future visits to Chambersburg. I keep looking for a reason to give this place a second star since it's not like I got salmonella or found a bug in my water or anything, but they really just fell short in every regard."
Kerri M.,"Johnstown, PA",3,146,,4.0,4/27/2013,"Our wait at this Applebees on a Friday night was 15 minutes.  We sat down and were waited on soon after.  The drinks and food came promptly.  We had the shrimp combo, chicken tenders, bourbon sizzler, and steak and nobody had complaints.  The server provided good service and was accommodating."
Paul B.,"Chambersburg, PA",0,17,1,3.0,2/1/2014,"After being stranded in my car a couple nights ago in an once storm the experience at Applebee's was not as bad.  It's your basic small town Applebee's but with karaoke on Thursday nights.  The drinks were fine and the service was good even though the place was packed.  The singing was hit or miss, kind of like the food.  I ordered the chucked fajitas which had good flavored chicken (was steaming hot), good peppers and onions but the rice was godawful.  I would have rather had that 12 year old sing Lady Antebellum all night and better rice.  The tortillas were also too cold.  There was a pretty good crowd and some girl was having her 21st birthday which added to the excitement.  All in all it's probably a little bit better than what you expect form the chain, but nothing to write home about."
Jim M.,"Chambersburg, PA",18,6,1,1.0,2/12/2009,"I'm not sure how applebees is 1) still in business, especially in Chambersburg and  2) still always busy? Wait times are always horrible, service staff is hit or miss every time, food is always dissapointing, and it's for sure NOT eating good in the neighborhood. I got a steak and shrimp there about seven months back, had to send it back twice because gristle/over cooked, and the third time I just asked for something else. As said before, why waste too much money on mediocre food when you can get the same quality or better at McDonalds for cheaper."
Edward C.,"Chambersburg, PA",0,17,,2.0,1/31/2014,my wife and I where seated promptly there was only two of us waitress analyses was very nice through and tried hard to make us happy both are meals soup chi ken tortilla chicken burnt bad flavor meals were both chicken both meals burnt just had a bad burnt flavor other than that ok
Diana P.,"Reisterstown, MD",21,154,14,2.0,8/26/2007,"Read my review of the Applebee's in Waynesboro and add the fact that the entrance to this restaurant was not designed with efficiency in mind.  There is barely room for two people in the entry-way and it has been crowded every time we've tried it.  You have to jostle and side-step... it isn't fun.  Food wasn't good, neither was the service.  Again, we won't be back.  There are too many decent places around to waste time and money on mediocrity."
