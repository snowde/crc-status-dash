Danielle W.,"Charlotte, NC",23,115,285,4.0,8/15/2017,"Apple Bees is not what it used to be,  because of that, that's the  reason why Don't  eat there a lot. Yes they had deals BUT some the food is not that cheap.The have the 2 for $20 (one app and 2 meals). I had the  shrimp wu tag stir fry, it was $10.99 they shrimp was cooked prefect and not over cooked. It had really good flavor."
Michael C.,"Charlotte, NC",0,1,,1.0,1/6/2018,The service is terrible. They said there was a 15-20 minute wait with over half the tables empty. As we waited another customer had to yell across the restaurant for service so she could pay her bill. We finally left after 10 minutes of waiting on nothing. Will never return to this location and maybe the whole franchise.
JuDarian S.,"Charlotte, NC",233,3,3,1.0,10/17/2017,"What's wrong Charlotte, this horrible service at Applebees made feel like they're struggling to keep business. Family and I went to see what the $1 margaritas were about. We spent more time (almost an hour) waiting on drinks and appetizers then actually consuming the items. When the food got there it wasn't everything together, while waiting my kids meal to get to him when I arrive I just so happen to tap the hard burnt bun turned the bun over and saw the burger was covered in hard burnt cheese. I was livid, I asked to speak to a manager and her apologies wasn't sympathetic enough for my comfort and all was done was a comp of a $2 meal. Weither you're under staffed Applebees with 2-3 Working at dinner time is ridiculous I will not come back to this location. Fix your business!"
Kyle B.,"Charlotte, NC",9,55,94,1.0,11/13/2017,"Went to this location on a Sunday afternoon. Noticed it wasn't too many cars in the parking lot and there were many open tables from what we could see through the window, which was very odd for a Sunday. But when entering the establishment we could easily see that they had a Sanitation Rating of 92.5. IMMEDIATELY my wife said we will not be eating here, though I was willing to go for it. We ended up making a U-turn and leaving before getting to the hostess. But after now seeing the Yelp reviews for this location, I am very happy we did not eat there."
Gene A.,"Charlotte, NC",171,4,,1.0,10/24/2017,Terrible service. Came in to pick up an order that was placed 45 minutes in advance had to wait an hour. Clearly the servers did not want to be there and gathered together and complained about the tables they had. Terrible overall experience will never eat from this location again
Raya C.,"Charlotte, NC",142,4,5,1.0,10/13/2017,"HORRIBLE service! I went in today and waited at the  host stand for almost 5 minutes while employees watched me wait and no one came to seat me. I then proceeded to sit at the bar and the bartender said she would be with me shortly. I waited and 10 minutes later, I didn't have a menu nor did she ask for my drink order. I then watched her sit the next group that came in at the host stand and she still hadn't came back to check on me or bring anything....something similar happened the last time I visited this location so I WILL NOT be back. It wasn't even busy so There wasn't an excuse for the poor service"
Jennifer B.,"Decatur, GA",0,69,,1.0,9/13/2017,"Didn't even order.  The booth seats were torn to shreds, the floor filthy, ceiling leaking into buckets by the bathrooms, bathrooms filthy.  No thank you !  Whoever runs this place should be ashamed of themselves, where is your pride?  I walked out, no, ran out, quickly!!"
Rho G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,26,6,1.0,3/8/2017,"Me and my girl went here 2 days ago! The worst service I've had in a good while.  When we first arrived there was no one at the podium to greet like all other Applebee's do. We stood there for approximately 5 minutes before anyone came and seated us. After the guy seated us, 5 minutes went by, 10 minutes went by, 15 minutes went by. NO ONE ELSE CAME!!! Finally I got up and went to the bar to ask the bartender for two glasses of water with lemon. The bartender states: no one came to help to you guys yet? I said: no but can I have two glasses of water until they come? Bartender: let me go get them Me: waiting for my water..... no water. He dismiss me and said they will come. By this time I'm furious!! Finally a waiter came and asked the craziest thing have we been helped! I said no!! He is apoplectic and ect... but I don't care. Saying how they are short handed and stuff. My thing is communication! The first guy who sat us knew they were short could have said something! communicate to your customers . So I asked to speak to the manager. Manager never came! And we never got out water. So we left and gave our business across the street to Friday's!!!"
Tamara A.,"Highland Creek, Charlotte, NC",95,18,19,1.0,9/17/2016,"Seriously I came here a couple of nights ago and was surprised at the good service as well as the green goddess wedge salad. The dressing was amazing!!! Fast forward to today, I placed an order online for the salad and a soup while at the gym. I plugged in for it 12:00pm pick up. I arrived around 11:45 and had no problem waking until 12. 12:10 nothing...12:15 he comes out with the receipt to sign and will bring the food out when it's ready. Really? It's soup and a wedge salad. Literally a hunk of lettuce. 12:30 and this is the salad they bring out. No bacon and barely any toppings. I knew my one experience Wednesday night was too good to be true. Update 9/16- tried again. Again a fail on the curbside to go. Ordered the green goddess wedge and southwest steak and black bean soup. This time when the server brought it out it had only bacon on it. I asked about the bleu cheese and pecans and he asked like I was asking for something that doesn't go on the salad. When I get home I realize the salad has ranch. I called and the manager said I could bring it back or have a gift card mailed. I said I would bring it back but decided to suck it up and eat it. Fast forward to midnight and I'm ready to eat my southwest steak and black bean soup but I notice the steak tastes a lot like chicken. Wait a minute it is chicken and it's not southwest black bean anything. More like some kind of chicken tortilla with rice. I'll be making a trip to Applebee's tomorrow.  If I could take away my one star I would."
Ashley W.,"Charlotte, NC",1,6,,1.0,6/11/2017,"This place needs to be shut down. Point blank period. The health department needs to be called...someone..I've never eaten at any Applebee's before but my aunt got me a gift card so I figured I'd use it. The bar was full of dirty dishes. The managers walked around with drinks in their own hands and no one would help me after multiple attempts. The place was dirty the carpet was sticky and the restaurant looked contaminated. I should've left the food there, hopefully I won't get sick. I'll definitely be calling their corporate office to beg them to bulldoze the place.  I'd really like to take the one star I gave back...but if I can't it's only because they have a place to park your car. That's about the only thing this place has going for it."
Demetria B.,"Charlotte, NC",100,3,,1.0,8/18/2017,"The Applebee's on J.W. Clay in Charlotte, NC is the most ghetto Applebee's I've ever visited. This morning, the staff and manager allowed a customer to sit at the bar and play his Pandora playlist from his phone on full volume. After several comments to our waiter, the self identified DJ wasn't address nor did his music stop. My group was very disappointed in the lack of leadership displayed in addressing an activity that was impacting the entire restaurant. He played his playlist like a hired DJ and not one employee said anything. It wasn't until I asked whom the manager on duty was that the waiter seemed concerned. It was an hour and 20 minutes too late. I will not be  returning to Applebee's... Friday's is a cross the street."
Surbhi P.,"Charlotte, NC",4,5,1,1.0,3/30/2017,"The worst experience I ever had at a restaurant. My 2 friends who were US Marines came to visit from NY, and we all decided to go to Applebees. We had the worse experience at Applebee's, the server did not sit us down. The restaurant was not busy at all and many of the servers were talking while one could simply have taken the time to get our order or drinks. After the server showed, I asked if there were any vegetarian options she replies ""i don't know, look on the menu"". Despite of her rude behavior we had kindly ordered our food. She did not come by once to ask us if we were good, took at least 30 minutes to bring in water and food was taking even longer. As the boys were getting restless they decided to just leave. I hope that Applebees takes it into consideration on how they treat their customers and provide a better service to other customers in future."
Dylan S.,"University City North, Charlotte, NC",61,1,,1.0,10/15/2017,"So, first off. Not only did it take an hour to get ONLY our appetizers but when we finally got our drinks, the sweet tea wasn't sweet at all. Second, the waitress was very rude and seemed like she did not care much to serve us as she would go walk around the restaurant instead of putting our orders in. Third, it took 45 minutes to come back and tell us they didn't have pasta for one of our meals, NEVER come to this Applebee's!"
Veronica W.,"Dumfries, VA",0,2,,1.0,6/7/2017,"Let me start by saying I am HUGEEEEEE on customer service!!! Being a local business owner I know that customers will always come first! My family and I (2 adults, 2 kids) decided to go to applebees tonight. We walk in, NOBODY greets us!! We wait for a good 10 minutes before someone even decides to come and seat us. There was maybe 7 cars in the parking lot. Nobody was sitting at the bar...NOT EVEN THE BARTENDER, and on a scale of 1-10, id say it was a 3 as far as how busy they were. A waitress came to a table close to the door TWICE before she turned around and sat us at our table. She came back and dropped our silverware off and left again. Nobody took our drink order or anything! After 20 minutes of just sitting there. My family and I got up and left!!!! As we walked out. We walked past two employees that were just standing gossipping at the bar and 1 employee who was on her way to another table. My family and I are new to the Charotte area and we will NEVER go back to this establishment. Every employee on the shift of June 7th at 7:50PM needs to be FIRED!!!!! Point blank period. They were NOT busy at all and SEVERAL employees were literally just standing around gossipping. NEVER AGAIN!"
Kelvin S.,"Kannapolis, NC",0,4,,1.0,3/25/2017,Service was slow our waitress never came back after food was served had to get the manager to pay the bill it's all good tho just probably won't go back there smh crazy cause back in the day that was the spot ...it's lost its luster
Jamie N.,"Eastland, Charlotte, NC",144,36,87,1.0,11/13/2016,"We waited so long for our appetizer, the people next to us, who came in after us, were eatting their meal. 3 people stopped by our table to ask if our app came out yet. Our food was good but had to wait 4 minutes for silverware after we got food. We had to get up and get our own napkins off of another table. No drink refills. When we were done eatting we waited so long for our check and boxes I called the store (yes, on my phone from a table) to tell them our table was still waiting for the check. I have never been to this Applebee's and you better believe I will Never be back.... way too many restaurants in the area to deal with mediocre food and horrible service."
Tyler G.,"Charlotte, NC",0,3,,1.0,6/28/2017,"This place was very dirty. There were small bugs in the martini. Took forever to get our food. Couldn't order a beer because taps were messed up and took 20 minutes to get a beer, by the time it came I was over drinking the beer. Gross dirty place and no one cares. Won't be back"
Lori R.,"Cleveland, OH",78,25,7,1.0,10/29/2016,"I wish there was a zero!!! Unfortunately, my teenage daughter, who has experienced far nicer establishments, likes Applebees and this is the closest one... they are slow, you have to ask for basics like water and silverware, the food is sub par even for their own brand, bathroom is filthy and it's the same every time we come!!! I promise I will go to a different one next time she asks!!!"
Melanee D.,"Charlotte, NC",141,72,40,3.0,5/27/2016,"I must confess that after reading the reviews I had my fingers poised to add my disgust and disappointment in the place too.  However,  reluctantly (yes,  I admit it) I must confess that it wasn't all that bad.  Our server wasn't the best,  she looked like she couldn't be more bothered.  But I guess after she sensed we were ok peeps she let her guard down a bit.  Our food came at a reasonable time and my salad was pretty dang on good!  Was it my favorite place?  Nah,  but I can't say I'd never go back.  The Maple Brownie makes all the pain go away every time..."
Bharath R.,"Bloomington, IL",4,3,,1.0,4/1/2017,Alright.. i went to this restaurant with my friends and they took a very very long time to get our order. Finally we got a food after long wait and guess what... food is worst. This was my first applebees where the food tasted very very worst.. and couple of my friends just left the food on the table after tasting the food. Not expecting this from applebees at all...
Ary R.,"Charlotte, NC",39,37,151,4.0,6/10/2016,"Fantastic service and food. We ordered appetizers, entrees, dessert and coffee and it was all great.  Tracey, our waitress, was very friendly and attentive."
Joseph L.,"Spencer, MA",0,1,,1.0,7/30/2017,"Ate dinner here on Sunday night, place looked empty. ordered the Southwest Steak + Black Bean Soup. Noticed when it arrived there were no beans and the meat looked like chicken. When the receipt arrived it said Chicken Tortilla Soup, when asked that I did not order the Chicken Tortilla Soup, was told that that is how the Southwest Steak + Black Bean Soup looks on the receipt. I also ordered a coffee, when it arrived looked like a cup of motor oil and then she informed me that they were out of creamer. Ate the soup (the wrong soup) when she came back with the receipt I told her that the coffee was burnt and could she make a fresh pot and again asked if they had creamer, she then said no and that they had been out of creamer all day. Had to ask for a spoon and she took her time getting one, waiting on some other customers on her way to the kitchen. When we left we were so upset that we vowed never to go to an Applebee's again. But I know that there are a lot good Applebee's out there because I have eaten at them. After reading all these bad reviews I am very surprised that management at this Applebee's has done nothing to try to correct their bad reputation."
Chapin S.,"Huntersville, NC",0,16,3,1.0,6/20/2017,"There is a reason this place has bad reviews. I would not come here ever much less ever bring my kids here!!! My family member was assaulted last night and no one who worked there did anything.  The women who dragged her around by her hair and made her fall out her chair at the bar had been there for FOUR HOURS DRINKING. the bar tender was laughing and did nothing!! This makes me believe this lady is a regular.  Management did nothing last night!! I called this morning and the manager on duty said ""I wasn't working so this has nothing to do with me"". Excuse me but if you have a manager title it has something to do with you whether you were working or not!! I am contacting ALE and have already contacted applebees customer care. I worked in a bar for years and having heard about this the women shouldn't have been served anymore. Many other patrons said she was overly intoxicated and becoming mouthy. I would not spend a penny here!!!"
Brian B.,"Fenton, MO",27,7,3,1.0,5/5/2016,Never ever eat here!!! Worst service I have ever had. When we said something there was one excuse after another!
Brandon L.,"Merrimack, NH",0,41,,1.0,4/11/2016,"Utterly un-shocked that this place has such a bad yelp review. Simply put...customer service matters. No one goes to Applebees because they want outstanding food. They go because its upscale fast food, they can sit and have a beer, and there are TVs. Appetizers are good anywhere you go, and grabbing a quick burger and fries is all any Applebees is ever really good for. Walked into the smallest waiting area I've ever seen in a sit-down establishment. 4 couples ahead of me and my wife...wait time is 10-15 minutes. Not bad right? 10 minutes go by and none of the couples before us have been seated. 3 couples have come in behind us in the meantime, and guess what their wait time is? 10-15 minutes according to the seasoned champion they had working as a Hostess. I start looking around and see an ample amount of tables empty...I start wondering, why the hell am I still waiting to be seated? The second hand strikes 12 as we entered minute 15, and a gaggle (real word...look it up) of employees decide to stop their entire evening to go do a birthday song...at Applebees. With a lobby full of customers waiting to be seated... It's 2016, isn't it common knowledge by now that no one has a birthday at Applebees? They just tell their waitress that as a joke to publicly embarrass the people they are with. Needless to say, we walked out. What a joke! This place has permanently lost my patronage."
Kaleena S.,"Charlotte, NC",0,10,7,1.0,8/20/2016,"Disgusting! Sat down to eat dinner and shortly after eating we noticed a group of ants. They started to crawl towards our table. We immediately notified the staff. We changed seats but absolutely nothing was said but ""I'm sorry"" we still received a full price bill. We did not get to enjoy our food due to being grossed out and I was sadly disappointed I was NOT compensated."
Ricky H.,"Harrisburg, NC",37,9,,1.0,5/1/2016,"First off the management here sucks ass!! The kitchen was so far behind that we sat there for 35 mins and still didn't get our appetizer! The server did all that she could but damn! This place has no team work at all and like I said, MANAGEMENT HERE IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN! Fire the sorry asses that work May 1st 2016!!!"
Maggie V.,"Charlotte, NC",105,93,343,2.0,9/29/2015,"I'm  not a fan or a regular customer of Applebee's due to a previous visit to another location. This time my daughter wanted to go so we went. I'm giving only 2 stars because I saw the same attitude of the employees. They don't care who walks in the door. The manager was talking out loud at the bar to some employee about checking their schedule. Very inappropriate to do in front of customers out loud in an open space. Very unprofessional. The food improved but still lacking consistency with the seasoning. Chicken was not seasoned and potatoes were bland no flavor. Abryana, our server was good, but nothing exceptional."
Robert C.,"Cross Hill, SC",4,23,7,1.0,2/21/2016,"We traveled all day and wanted to grab a quick bite before checking into our hotel so we chose this place. Been to Applebee's before and honestly they have not been great, but this was by far the worst ever. Should have checked Yelp first!  We were seated by the hostess quickly , good start right? Wrong. We sat for over 15 minutes with many servers passing us including the one assigned to our table. Another server we had not seen stopped by and asked if we had been helped. He took our drink order and was extremely pleasant. Waitress delivered our water and drinks then nothing further for about ten minutes. Ordered and received our food my wife ordered the Asian salad and started eating and when she got to the bottom of the bowl a hair was at the bottom. Called manager and he came over. Not very customer service oriented. My wife had to ask if the salad would be compensated after he asked if she would like something else to which he responded, sure apologized and left. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy."
Louisa F.,"Peachtree City, GA",8,59,545,4.0,1/26/2015,"This location seems recently remodeled.  Very pleased with the abundance of local and regional microbrews displayed unusually attractively for an Applebee;s.  They had glasses provided by the brewers, and the televisions for watching sports were set up wonderfully.  An unexpected nice Applebee's experience."
Na S.,"Jamaica, NY",1,22,,1.0,7/2/2015,"I gave one star because that is the lowest amount of stars you can give. This restaurant does not realize that there are too many restaurants in the immediate area for both the food and service to be subpar. The restaurant was fairly empty (approximately 7 occupied tables), however, the server was not attentive and slow to serve. She barely came to the table to check on us. She never once refilled our waters. And, she never cleared the table of the appetizer plates; we were eating our entrees and she never came back to clear the table of those plates. It was a crowded mess. Speaking of entrees- the sizzle plates that come with grilled orders were dirty. Dried cheese and muck from another diner were stuck to these plates. We advised the manager. His response was, ""well, the plates are supposed to get washed- there are two piles in the back, one clean and one dirty....sorry, you did not get clean ones."" And, that was it. He did not offer to take the meals off the bill, or anything else. He said, ""thanks for the feedback,"" then he left. The food itself was eh. The spinach artichoke dip, which we would normally get, must be a new recipe. It was bad. We ordered two caesar salads, and she brought two house salads. Sure, she changed them- after we clicked that mechanism on the table that flashes, and then waiting another five minutes for her to reappear from some where and us vigorously flagging her down. The bread that came with an entree was like a brick- one bite was enough to determine that you could break your teeth on it. And the chicken that I ordered, had a funny taste. Needless to say, if you want a decent meal with at least decent service, DO NOT come to this restaurant."
Shanelle M.,"Charlotte, NC",0,34,3,1.0,3/27/2016,We walked into the restaurant about 9:30 pm the hostess sat us after about standing in the foyer for about two minutes. We sat down while 3 or 4 different waiters/waitresses walked past our table not acknowledging us at all. We waited for 12 minutes still nothing we got up and walked out but before we walked out the hostess that sat us had the nerve to tell us have a nice night. What? As if you don't remember just seating us. This will be our last time going to this applebees.
Brandon A.,"Charlotte, NC",47,5,2,5.0,10/8/2014,"I come here at least once a week. Shocked to read the reviews, my visits are great. Well I guess you can't really mess up wings & drinks."
Shay J.,"Charlotte, NC",121,19,11,1.0,2/24/2016,"I recently moved to the Charlotte area and my family and I decided to order out one night. I did a fairly large order online on a weeknight and went to pick it up at the restaurant. When I arrived there were several servers standing around the bar area talking, I'm assuming because it was a slow night. I told the bartender that I was there to pickup an order and she decided that her conversation with her coworker was more important than serving a customer. I waited for about 10 minutes ( my requested pickup time at the time was about 15 minutes prior to this) and my food came out. I checked my order, and saw that I was missing a dessert (maple blondie to be exact) I told the bartender what I was missing, she whispered to who coworker who then decided to come over and take a look in my bag as if I wasn't telling the truth. I had to wait for another 10-15 minutes for them to prepare what I requested. I didn't receive an apology, or a thank you; I was just handed another bag. The food was subpar to say the least. I highly doubt we will be returning to this restaurant."
Andrew P.,"Harrisburg, NC",106,117,34,2.0,10/5/2013,"Went to this Applebee's location two times. The first time was a few years back, and the bartender had terrible customer service (I'm not sure if she still works there, but I think it's worth noting). The second time I went, my girlfriend specifically asked for no onions on her sliders, and they came out with onions anyway. Also, my second round of sangria tasted like the bartender poured half a bottle of what ever they use to sweeten it, and barely any wine. I'll stick to the location by concord mills mall"
Andonus P.,"Charlotte, NC",5,36,,1.0,3/26/2013,"I've visited this location many times in the past and the only thing that I have to say is ""This place has really fallen off."" One of the first things that you'll notice when you walk in on a weekend, is that the overall atmosphere of the place seems to be gloomy.  You just get the feeling that the people eating there aren't really enjoying themselves. The food is really bad.  The riblets that I had during my last visit tasted like they were a few days old and had been microwaved, even the bones were dry and there was an odd freezer burned like taste.  My mother had a steak and after cutting into it and taking a bite, she swore that it had been microwaved.  We both had salads which seemed to be extremely small and were made with ingredients that were close to their expiration date (limp lettuce, slimy tomatoes, and old cheese).  I should also mention that the salads were served warm along with lukewarm dressing. The overall service was nothing to really write home about (as the old saying goes).  Given the ratio of waitresses to customers, one would expect the service to be more prompt, but it wasn't.  The food also seemed to take a really long time to come out, about 45 mins for a steak with fries and riblets with fries, it may have actually been closer to an hour. If you're in the area and in a bind to find something to eat, I recommend that you either find somewhere else to go or just save your money and hit one of the local grocery stores.  Since Applebee's is a chain, I don't think Kitchen Nightmares will be coming to save them :)"
Tatyana W.,"Charlotte, NC",0,6,,1.0,6/2/2015,"I am vegetarian and I asked the waiter about menu options for me and she told me they weren't vegetarian friendly and then proceeded to ask me if i ate CHICKEN. They took my drink for a refill and never returned it, after 20 min I had to ask for it. we got our food separate,  never got queso i repeatedly asked for. received nachos with meat, we hate running our server but after a period of time we gave up.  Had Never received the ""free refill of fries"" which does not phase me but still. I felt that it was a waste of money and I will never return. Time and money WASTED."
Lanette W.,"Charlotte, NC",0,12,5,1.0,7/10/2016,"Arrived at 7:55 on a Sunday, if the fact that we had to wait 5 minutes for a hostess to greet us although the restaurant was half empty wasn't the key for us to run we ignored the signs. After waiting 20 minutes we observed several already seated parties leaving and complaining of the wait. We still stayed because I insisted on Applebee's. After waiting another 20 minutes for our server to take a drink order and waiting another 25 mins for the appetizer to arrive cold. We still hung in and received cheese less 4 cheese Mac and cheese, a well done steak instead of a medium, no ketchup for burgers, sour yogurt for the kids and no apologies for the poor service. A server quit, the manager seemed to have little to no idea of how to get the ball back rolling.  To sum it up: grossly understaffed, horrible service, cold appetizers and tasteless food. Don't waste your time. It's 9:28 and we're walking out now."
Joe Joe J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,12,1,1.0,1/2/2015,Only came here to use a gift card. Worst service ever from the manager on down. Nothing more I can say.
John H.,"Charlotte, NC",265,1283,685,3.0,12/21/2010,"Went here for lunch today.  Got in at 12:30 and the place was a little dead... made me a little leery, but my friend and I were armed with serious appetites.  Let me preface by saying that I haven't been to an Applebee's in ages so the menu had been changed (probably several times) since I had last seen it and it was cool to see some new options on there.  Once we decided, the food came out pretty quickly. We went with the 2 entrées and an app for $20... pretty decent deal for the portion sizes.  We split a spicy queso dip with chips and I got the new Florentine ravioli with chicken.    Overall good experience... the waitress was a little on the slow side (for the restaurant being dead).  It did pick up toward the end so maybe she got a little frazzled."
