Kevin B.,"Concord, NC",0,8,,1.0,1/13/2016,"Stopped in for lunch. Seated quickly wait staff, not sure which was our server, walked by multiple times without even looking our way. Place wasn't busy at all. Left and went across the street to another restaurant which was very busy but seated us a took our order within a couple of minutes.  If you are looking for a quick lunch don't go here."
Nicole A.,"Peoria, AZ",218,10,5,1.0,9/19/2014,"Took 30 minutes to get our drinks and still had to wait another 10 additional minutes for our waters.  When we asked for a lemon for a drink, the the waiter came back with a whole bowl of lemons to be rude. When they finally came out with waters and the bus boy asked if we wanted straws, someone replied yes, he threw 10 straws on the table.  Customer service has been awful and I would not return."
Tyler S.,"Fort Mill, SC",51,4,4,1.0,2/2/2014,Very bad service. Also my girlfriend got very sick after eating here. Also notice that the chicken she had ate was undercooked. DO NOT GO TO THIS APPLEBEE's

Cheyenne A.,"Charlotte, NC",0,19,5,1.0,3/24/2016,"If I could give this particular Applebee's 0 stars I would. We've been there several times and each time we left disappointed. The last time we visited this place it was so bad, we vowed NEVER to go back there again. We had to wait at least 30 minutes for a table but that wasn't our main complaint. It was a weekend, Saturday night to be exact, so we expected a wait. Once we were seated, we realized we were seated across from a family with a few unruly kids. No biggie because it happens from time to time. What really angered us was our scatter-brained waitress. She was totally inept. She couldn't even get our drink order right. That was our first sign that we weren't going to have a good meal. We ordered flavored lemonades. I asked to have mine with no ice. She returned with the drinks and I had gotten the wrong flavor and it had ice in it. I pointed out the mistake and she apologized and took it back. When she arrived for the second time, she had the flavor right but there was ice in it again. I decided to just let it slide. We ordered our dinners waited, and waited, and waited. It must have been 30 - 35 minutes before it came. She set our plates down and scurried off. She never even gave us silverware or napkins. We managed to flag down another waitress and asked for silverware and napkins. She went to go get them and never returned. After about 10 minutes a man came around checking on each table. I assumed he was a manager. We told him about the silverware and napkins and he apologized and brought them right away. At this time the bungling waitress comes over to ask if we needed anything. At that point we didn't. She went over to the next table and they complained about something and we heard her apologizing. She went to another table and they complained and we heard her apologizing again. Apparently she was screwing up orders at every table. We finished the meal, paid, and left without tipping. Be aware of this particular Applebee's because they always seem to have issues."
M.dayanara F.,"Charlotte, NC",19,26,89,1.0,12/20/2011,"my husband & i, went here for lunch. it took then forever to get to us. Our Waiter took our drink order & didn't even bother to offer an appetizer. he came back with our drink, did not give us a straw & quickly turn around and came back 15 mts later.  the menu was alot different than the last time we was at Applebees.] everything look really good.  So we finally got to order (we were starving by this time) I order half rack baby back ribs plate,(witch i had before) they had always been yummy,but not this time. let me tell you it was just a plate with dry ribs, hard ( some rotten like)french fries and no slaw i had to ask for it (it came w/plate),15 minutes pass before a got my slaw. my hubby got a combination Cajun steak with shrimp, rice and beans; the rice and beans were hard and dry, so he end up eating the steak  and 3 shrimp only. oh if i had to mention the appetizer ,,I mean terrible, a spicy queso dip with chips were grease and not very well done.  we was disappointed of the food and service. bad service & terrible food, don't recommend."
Erica N.,"Kennett Square, PA",0,12,3,2.0,10/26/2013,"Sitting here at the car side to go spot and I called in to let them know I am here and couldn't imagine a more disrespectful person picking up the phone, she cut me off when I was trying to speak to her, and then she hung up on me mid sentence. When she came out to my car she was nothing but impolite. It was the customer service tonight that may have deterred me from ever coming back to Applebees.   The food was great, but food isn't the only part of the experience. Despite the good food the customer service has turned me away from this restaurant."
Amber S.,"Red Cross, NC",1,1,,1.0,7/24/2011,Salad had wilted lettuce.  Sanitation grade 90.5.  Don't recommend.
