Brandon B.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",23,116,8,4.0,1/3/2018,Came here for lunch on a Wednesday to watch some Premier League football. It was a great time! Waiters were friendly and the food was very good. They just came out with AYCE riblets and it's delicious! So worth a try if you ever come here hungrier than usual.
Thom P.,"Los Angeles, CA",132,361,18,3.0,1/9/2018,"The lady L.A. Charger fan next to me sounded like Large Marge and smelled like a wet ashtray...but thats the clientele you get. I got a grilled chicken with vegetables at the bar. It was crowded and hard to hear anyone, but...that's the chain game. It's probably more pleasant in a booth or something, or if I dug up some date but if you go alone ona weekend, expext elbows to nudge you out. The grilled chicken was dry and overcooked. But..again...this is most likely NOT the norm. Ill revisit and review again."
Mel E.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,181,180,5.0,12/16/2017,"Ever catch yourself staring at the bottom of your empty glass at a bar? Nope! not here at Applebee's.  My review will consist of my many visits to the bar. I am proud to announce that my very two favorite bartenders here at Angela & Suzy. They are very attentive and more than welcoming in engaging in a very friendly conversation while they multi-task. They are never too busy when it comes to provide good quality service. Especially when the L.I.T. drinks are keeping the night LIT! These two bartenders go together like Dr.Dre & Snoop, Bert & Ernie, Beavis and Butthead, Spongebob & Patrick, well, you get the picture. Great service all around! I started coming recently not to long ago and noticed that they got rid of the Dodgers and Lakers wall paper near the bar area. What was that about? the replacement decor is giving it a yardhouse feel too it. Any who, come by and have a drink or two, or too many. Have a great time and if you see me across the bar, buy me a drink!!"
Penny J.,"San Fernando, Los Angeles, CA",3,10,62,2.0,12/25/2017,"Although the food here is not too bad, I have to give this restaurant 2 stars because of the costumer service. I ordered a 6oz stake and my date ordered a 8oz stake. When we received the plates, my date's stake looked like a 4oz stake :O It was so tiny! He told the waitress there was a mistake on the stake size and she didn't even look at the stake, she just said ""I imputed 8oz stake in the tablet"" like wtf!! Lady look at the damn stake!! She was rude so won't be returning here! #NoTip"
Jacquline B.,"Los Angeles, CA",264,11,5,3.0,12/16/2017,This is a good family place to eat.. BUT!!! The young employees just stand around takes them way to long to clean a table for customers. I went yo the restroom and noticed 3 tables that were just sitting with dirty dishes and when I came from the restroom they were still sitting there plus it was 4 familys waiting to be seated. The food is good no problem there.
Cynthia D.,"Sylmar, CA",266,129,403,2.0,12/6/2017,"About a week ago before going to watch Coco in Spanish at the nearby Pacific theatre, I met up with friends here for food and drinks. We thought it was awesome that they had a wide variety of options for Happy Hour at decent prices. It was 4 of us and 2 of us got there before and ordered drinks right before our friends arrived but they ordered almost right after us. The reason for the 2 was that the service was extremely slow. Maybe they were short staffed or something but there is no excuse on my friends waiting for their drinks for a really long time and they would probably be still waiting for them if I hadn't called our server over. We ordered some food and it was ok, not bad but not spectacular either. I was really hungry, so anything would taste good to me. We ended up ordering another round of drinks and again they took a really long time. The thing that bothered us the most was that we had a clear view of the bar and the bartender took forever to get to making our drinks. It was not busy at all and instead she was talking to another customer at the bar, instead of making our drinks. Overall, not the best experience and don't think I'll be back anytime soon."
Micah R.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",91,123,64,5.0,4/2/2017,"I'm not a plain chain guy but the happy hour here is awesome. 3-6 and 9-midnight DAILY is pretty awesome for 50% off appetizers and great drink deals.  We got every option of appetizers(5), a premium rum drink and a well margarita for $26 total! The well margarita was $3! Beats a dive bar. That's a great deal for a night out while you feel like you're splurging. The chicken wonton tacos were amazing, crispy wonton shell and flavorful teriyaki fillings and slaw. Cheese and artichoke dip is a classic.  With the 50% off most apps are $3-5!!! Can't beat that."
Christine L.,"NORTHRIDGE, CA",20,4,5,1.0,12/30/2017,"Not a good place to go to if you or your friend is a true vegetarian. My friend does not eat meat including fish. As a vegetarian there was very little to choose from the menu. Other than the spinach dip  and chips and some salads, there was not much if a selection.  Applebees  really needs to update their menu. As for the service, at this particular location it could be better. Our waiter completely  forgot our appetizer and she brought our main dish out instead. We ended up having our appetizers  after the entree."
Tony M.,"Porter Ranch, CA",66,100,222,2.0,9/4/2017,Options limited and not appetizing. Food is mediocre. It is cheap but just not what I would choose when eating out. If you like cheap below average for come here. Service is ok.  My father in law loves it if that makes any difference.
Brian D.,"Woodland Hills, CA",1,27,1,2.0,10/27/2017,"The service is horrible. The worst part is that they had plenty of staff on hand but they weren't doing much. We sat ourselves at the bar area tables and waited about 10 minutes with nobody coming around to give us a menu. I went to the hostess and asked how we get menus. She asked where we were seated so she could send someone over. Seems like a normal question except there were only a few other tables occupied in the bar area and she saw exactly where I was sitting. Anyways, I pointed to where she saw me get up and she said she would send a waitress over. About 5 more minutes go by and a waitress comes up to us and says ""we don't usually go to tables if they don't have a menu"". What? How are we supposed to get the menu? We order an appetizer and a margarita (no salt on it even though there was supposed to be, which is not a big deal at all but it just goes to show how lazy the staff is) and say we need  a second before we know what food we want. About 5-10 minutes go by and she hasn't checked to see what food we want yet. She only had one other table. At this point we have been at a table for probably 20 minutes and still haven't ordered our dinner, so we decide we can't take it anymore and we went to BJ's and had a great dinner. Friendly note to whoever runs this place because I would like for this to be a good place- It seems like you have plenty of staff, but they are very lazy. Go to TGI Fridays (similar scale restaurant) to see how their staff works. Hire and properly train new staff and this place could be good."
Michelle M.,"Pasadena, CA",0,5,,2.0,12/24/2017,Food was mediocre. This place is not clean at all... there was a mountain of fries on the floor under our table that I kept stepping on. But the service really sucked. Our waitress didn't stop by our table to make sure everything was okay and refill our drinks. We had to track her down. She wasn't welcoming at all and was actually kinda rude. Won't be coming back here anytime soon.
Suzy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,18,7,1.0,12/22/2017,"I had come in a couple months ago to set up a date for a pancake fundraiser, the male manager was suppose to add it to their calendar. I called to confirm and he completely forgot and acted like he had no idea what I was talking about on top of being rude. I had to go in a second time to set up a date and waited 20 minutes to speak to the female manager because she was ""too busy"" to speak to me. The worst management team ever with the worst customer service."
Yuliana P.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,51,10,1.0,10/6/2017,"Horrible horrible horrible. Got an email where they advertised $1 margaritas. Figured we'd go check it out. Waited about 40 minutes to be seated. Didn't expect much from a dollar margarita.  Sat down finally. Asked for our dollar margaritas With salt.  Briana (waitress) made it a point to tell me they ALL came with salt. Great!!!  Wrong. No salt. Whatever, no biggie. She later walks over to us with some shot glasses full of salt.  Uhhh??? Why would I want a shot glass full of salt?!  The margaritas sucked. But again u get what u pay for right.  That's exactly what we got. Ok. No problem. We ordered appetizers.  They were COLD. Cheese in cheese sticks was still frozen. Really??!!!  We ordered beers. Waited another 20 minutes. No beers.  Asked for the check. Waitress sent the manager to bring our check and they seemed confused as to why we cancelled our beers.  Decided to get up pay our bill and leave. Went to a bar down the street instead.  This place doesn't care about their reputation much less about their customers.  I used to like this place. But it's definitely not worth the time not money.  We will not be coming back."
Steve B.,"Panorama City, Los Angeles, CA",13,9,10,5.0,1/1/2018,LOVE THIS RESTAURANT MY FAMILY AND I ARE ALWAYS HERE. Joseph the General Manager is One of A kind great attitude and better work ethic. We Love coming here also because Maritza is the best Manager possibly you can put in charge while Joseph is out. Best Restaurant in the whole San Fernando Valley for food plus Happy Hour. Always enjoy watching my NFL GAMES HERE IS A MUST TRY.
Steven B.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",1,80,21,4.0,12/21/2017,"Excellent Service.  Overall Good Food for the Price.  Our Host by the name of Nicholas, was kind, attentive  and made us feel welcome.  Our Waitress by the name of Genesis, was friendly and Professional."
Stephanie May L.,"Granada Hills, CA",230,114,249,4.0,6/4/2017,Big fan of the food and service. After the remodel everything took a step up. I haven't had any food I haven't liked since. Last visit I ordered the steak with mashed potatoes and a baked potato. Didn't think it would be too much potatoes until I saw how big the baked potato was. It was delicious nonetheless. The medium rare steak was cooked just how I liked it. I also enjoyed the mango iced tea.  Parking is found in the plaza.
Carissa A.,"San Fernando, CA",68,149,9,2.0,10/4/2017,"Why is yelp now telling me how to yelp? Anyway, The service was horrible years ago and remains horrible today. It took exactly one hour from when we sat down to get our complete order (We were ready within five minutes to order.) My mom and sister's drinks should have been served immediately as the bartender was standing around doing nothing. Our waitress didn't even serve us, it was the manager, who was extremely polite and accomodating. She gave us replacement appetizers and cut the bill down, so they did make up for it. It's kind of hard to shit on them after that, but it's the truth. Applebee's needs to step up their service. The food was okay."
Michael B.,"Los Angeles, CA",110,23,,1.0,10/13/2017,"The service and wait times are so poor here, came here last weekend and spent an hour waiting for a table (okay, not horrible). It took nearly 20 mins for me and my three fellow guests to be greeted and an additional 15 to get waters and our first round of drinks.  After 45 mins of sitting at our booth our server finally came back to take food orders (we tried ordering on the little tabletop computer but it was dead, surprise surprise).  Every single table around us, including those who came well after us and ordered after us, received their food before us. This is probably at an hour and a half into us sitting. We ordered another round of drinks, opting for the holiday specials which were nothing but sugar and the presentation wasn't even good. Clearly the bartender didn't give a shit and the waitress either too busy or too nonchalant didn't care to get them made the right way. Two of our three plates were cold, like the chicken was ICE F**CKING COLD. They wanted to remake and I let them know I wasn't interested in waiting another 50+ mins for food. They took it off. No tableside manager visit, no discount for the inconvenience of waiting an eternity or having crap food or bad service. Nothing.  Either way, definitely one of those experiences that makes you reconsider EVER EVER EVER going back to this joke of a restaurant.  And with all the new menu and deco changes, what even are you anymore Applebee's? Except not doing well in 2017 and clearly putting effort into the wrong areas of what it should be improving on!"
Ruchika P.,"Woodland Hills, CA",160,68,1290,3.0,6/5/2017,If you're looking for a quick bite to eat and an alcoholic beverage swing by the Applebee's in Chatsworth. It's a good spot to visit either before or after watching a movie at the Winnetka AMC Theater in the same Shopping Plaza.
Tracy T.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,6,5,4.0,10/6/2017,"For the entire month of October, Applebee's is offering $1 margarita's!! And just when you didn't think it could get any better, it does...why?...because it's ALL DAY LONG ((not just at happy hour))!!! Talk about customer appreciation!!!  The margaritas have the right amount of tequila and won't have you saying ""no wonder why they were $1"". I enjoyed 4 of them my first visit, and it set me right where I needed to be. Even though they use their ""house"" tequila ((I believe its called Torada)), i didn't feel hungover or sluggish at all. They only offer 1 flavor which would be the cadillac margarita. I also enjoyed a few of their appetizers,  I have to say that my favorite is the chicken wonton tacos (you have the choice of steak as well), and the spinach artichoke dip. I also ordered the mozarella sticks which had the right amount of crisp, and cheese. I will definately be paying them a visit again, but with a dinner platter in mind along with my margaritas!"
Trina T.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,126,1,4.0,9/8/2017,Haven't been here in a long time. They have redone everything and it's nice a clean. Really welcoming. My husband ordered a steak and he said it was very good. I had the classic burger with sweet potato fries. My only compliant is that they didn't have 1000 island dressing for the burger. The service was excellent. Mario was our server and he was great!!
Eric W.,"Canoga Park, CA",166,672,148,4.0,1/22/2017,"Can't say I'd actively seek out Applebee's or its competitors normally. But we had tickets to a movie and wanted to enjoy a grown-up beverage and some appetizers. The location in the parking lot of the Winnetka movie theater makes this a great choice. There was a wait for a table before 6pm and by the time we left about an hour later, the wait had covered the lobby area and included the outdoor benches. This place is really popular on a Saturday night! The restaurant was packed for an early dinner. We sat at the bar and ordered happy hour beverages and both the mozzarella sticks and artichoke spinach dip. Everything was delicious and reasonably priced.  Service was really good too and the women tending the bar were extremely busy but friendly. I can't say I'd go here for dinner but it's hard not to want to return for a similar activity -- happy hour and a movie."
Sonia V.,"Reseda, Los Angeles, CA",20,31,8,1.0,7/1/2017,Best part about this place is the water.  Service terribly slow and the food is meh. Not coming back for sure.
Gina M.,"North Hills, Los Angeles, CA",33,1,,5.0,12/1/2017,"I love this place ! Everyone was super sweet and kind and wonderful, me and my husband love this place ! The Manager was super nice and cares for his Customers a lot !so if you have any problem with anything he will take care it and Treat you very nice and calm about it , his very Professional :) I can't Waite to come back and have a good time !  So please try this place when you get a chance they are having Long Island's for a dollar for December !! If you are 21 and over ,they are the best ."
Myrtle P.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",195,146,97,4.0,8/11/2017,I really enjoyed Applebee's! Greeted by the hostess and got seated quickly. The chicken wonton tacos was unique and really tasty. Their fiesta line chicken was probably the best dish we got. I also enjoyed the sirloin stir fry. Don't forget to try their triple chocolate meltdown! It's actually comparable to Macaroni Grill's chocolate cake! We enjoyed our first time at Applebee's and would most likely be back!
Anish S.,"San Francisco, CA",8,2,,1.0,9/21/2017,"I ""used"" to love Applebee's.  Can you believe, there was no one @ reception...even after waiting for 5 to 10mins this night."
Zoom H.,"Santa Clarita, CA",24,4,40,1.0,5/26/2017,They have really bad service notice on food and an order actor remind them I order for Mac pasta and they only give me three McChicken piece on the foster order...  they have really bad service....
Krista K.,"Los Angeles, CA",220,124,374,5.0,11/25/2016,Greeted as soon as I walk in.. Always... Food is better then ever! Susy was an amazing bartender and waiter. She really picks up the slack during training and overwhelming hours. Heard they have new sandwiches coming soon! Hope it's not just a rumor. Diana slicing oranges in front of me made my experience tropical. Richard mixed a perfect lemon drop shaken fabulously. Will be back!
Divina G.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,16,2,2.0,11/12/2017,"The food and the dining could be good if only our server Angela A. did not forgot to bring me my drink, Raspberry Ice Team. We called another server to tell her to cancel my drink order, Angela A. then came to our table & offered me the drink to go. I told her I'm supposed to be drinking it while eating, since I came for a sit down dinner & did not order food to go. Lousy service."
Aris P.,"Canoga Park, CA",17,32,27,5.0,8/12/2017,"We have the 2 for 20 it is awesome,taste sooo good and the secret is the chocolate molten lava ""IT IS THE BEST """
Samuel A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,2,3.0,8/25/2017,"The appetizers are ok, but the burgers are terrible, it tastes like select ground beef. Josh did enjoy his caprese mozzarella sandwich. The staff was nice and attentive."
Jose P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,61,4,5.0,9/11/2017,"Good staff, good food, many TV's to follow sports games. Family friendly, I highly recommend BBQ Ribs & mashed potatoes!!"
Amantur S.,"Los Angeles, CA",62,86,168,5.0,5/17/2017,I love Applebee's. I always like to bring my cheap dates here or just with the guys and have a good time get a couple drinks at the bar. The cocktails here are very delicious and I love them when they're in me lol The 2 for 20 deal is very affordable so I usually get two entrées just for myself. The steak and the fish and the chickens are all cooked very well here and anything is always good. The ribs are also very good as well.
Carlos F.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,39,5,5.0,10/18/2017,This location has friendly bar tenders excellent service Richard  all staff are great
Cindi P.,"Chatsworth, CA",10,57,12,2.0,10/10/2017,"We have eaten here before and i Don't remember it ever being this bad. Had the 2 for 20 deal. Appetizer of chips and artichoke dip was good. Meal of chicken and shrimp skillet with potatoes was very dry. The $1.00 margaritas were the worst I have ever had, and I've had a lot if margaritas in my 67 years. I've had other drinks here and they weren't bad. These were like half water.  Don't let the $1 margarita suck you in. Service was good"
Pas I.,"Inglewood, CA",104,39,43,1.0,2/25/2017,"What can I say. It's Applebee's. Chain, American, mass market, casual dining. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.  I will say that the staff is great. No complaints there. We sat in the bar for happy hour and were served promptly and courteously.  I'm giving this place 1 star because the food is just bad. I mean really bad. Just poor quality food. Anyway... Where's the check? I have a movie to get to."
Robert M.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,9,3,5.0,4/29/2017,"The service was great. Our server Nancy was on top of all our needs, frequently refilling drinks and our order of chips. Food took a little longer than expected , however the restaurant was pretty full. Food tasted great. Manager Joseph, greeted my family and shook all of our hands. Very nice gentleman. We had a brownie bite to share for desert because we were all so full and just wanted a little something. Brownie bite was so good! All in all, a great meal in a great environment."
Eddie E.,"Simi Valley, CA",60,2,,1.0,10/11/2017,"I was there on Monday around 7PM.  there where only 3 servers on a night that had dodgers playoff game and Monday night football.  The margaritas where watered down, and the beer was flat.  It took forever to even get a refill.  We had to ask for both ranch and mayonnaise 3 separate times, to 2 different people.  The cooks seemed to be afraid of salt to put on the food. Needles to say im never going back there again."
C B.,"Sylmar, CA",1,33,28,5.0,4/11/2017,Surprisingly good food and great service. Had the fried shrimp and spinach dip.  Will return
Narine G.,"Chatsworth, CA",99,182,112,2.0,2/5/2017,"Food is bland. Service is average. With everything else within the Pacific Theaters plaza, this would definitely not be a first option. However, it does have a homey feel in being the neighborhood bar as it pays tribute to local schools and sports. Deals are pretty good, hence the quality is sub par."
