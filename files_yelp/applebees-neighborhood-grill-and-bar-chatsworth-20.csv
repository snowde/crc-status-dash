Jim S.,"Burbank, CA",1,73,,4.0,10/10/2014,"If anyone in your group is vegetarian, don't come here.  The selections are extremely limited.   Other than that, it was a good experience.  Servers were friendly, if a bit rushed.  Food was what you would expect at a place of this type."
Andy L.,"Pacoima, CA",283,220,6,2.0,6/5/2014,"First time at Applebee's was here. Went here with cousins after watching Xmen in the same plaza. It was alright, nothing special really.  Food: There were three of us, so we got the 2 for $20 deal and another dish. We ended up with boneless sweet and sour wings, cowboy burger, oriental chicken salad, and 4 cheese mac with honey pepper chicken. In total with drinks it was about $40, pretty good deal. Food comes out quick even though the restaurant was pretty crowded (Sunday dinner time).  The boneless wings were too salty, way to salty and tasted nothing like sweet and sour. Pretty sure it was classic buffalo sauce but they said it wasn't. Cowboy burger was actually the best thing we got. Thick patty with bacon, onion strings and bbq sauce; what's not to like about that. Comes with a small amount of bland tasting fries. We got crispy chicken with the oriental salad, good choice since it added texture to the salad that it needed. Was expecting a more vinaigrette like dressing but it was a thicker creamier dressing and it wasn't so good. The mac and cheese was pretty bland to, pretty sure there wasn't 4 cheeses in there, only saving grace with that one was the chicken, I can probably eat a bucket of that.   Service: There was a line when we got there but the wait was only 15 mins. Asked for a table of three and they only brought 2 menus and 2 utensil pack things. Server seemed out of it and not caring. I understand it being a little late and the dinner crowd but at least show some effort. I'd rather you try and fail instead of not trying at all. If service was better the experience would have been better. The person that brought the food out was really nice though. Drink order was messed up and lagged a little in getting it corrected. Tipped accordingly.  Location: Nice location really. On the outside of the Pacific Winnetka Theatre plaza. Right next to Habit and a Japanese Restaurant. Parking is plentiful and plenty of lighting. I think there is security riding around but not sure. Free parking as well if you were wondering."
Erin G.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,93,4,3.0,1/4/2013,"Food was ok.. kids loved it.. Server was GREAT!! I believe his name was Noah... I always like when a server is polite to the children. I didn't hate it, didn't love it.. I am dieting so liked the reduced calorie menu..  I would go back.."
Vanessa S.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,102,9,1.0,6/1/2015,"Went to celebrate my sisters bday with my mom, sisters and brother. Overall the service was ok. Slow but ok. After we finished we went home just to rush to the rest rooms because everyone got sick. The food made everyone sick. We had gotten chicken, ribs and steak. Worst experience ever. Don't ever plan on returning. We called the manager and he didn't show any care."
Bella C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",10,13,,4.0,8/6/2014,"I would have given this place 5 stars, but because... the drinks are so terrible I can't, and I have given this place the benefit of the doubt, trying all kinds of different drinks, margaritas, sangria etc...... the bartenders, are not real bartenders, sorry they suck!!!!    Oh.....  but the steak is to die for, seriously, it's delicious, the best steak I ever had, so soft it melts in your mouth, so juicy, it really is delicious, I have tried many up sacle places and the steak is good I wont say it isn't, but, for some reason, Applebee's OMG!! I kid you not!! it's delicious, plus the price is right, the hostess are very nice, and so are the people waiting on you. I do recommend the food here, I had other dishes of course, and everything I had, so far, pretty good :)"
Beretta F.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,81,20,1.0,7/18/2011,"Husband and I recently moved to the suburbs. When we said we wanted to move to the Valley (to afford a house with a yard), our friend Eric mocked us, saying ""Hope you like Applebee's!""  For months now, we've been saying ""Stupid Eric. What's wrong with Applebee's?""  Sunday, we found out. Nothing at Applebee's looks like their photos or commercials, and it's pretty much inedible.  We ordered the 2/$20 deal.  Dessert was also not included in the $20 Deal, yet they show you desserts to choose from on the menu page, which I felt was misleading to the Unfortunates who will actually eat here and order dessert. ""Boneless Wings"" are actually ""Greasy Globs of Deep - Fried Flour and BBQ Sauce, Covering about 1/8"" Shreds of 'Chicken'"". ""Fiesta Shrimp Pasta"" should be renamed ""A Bunch of Shrimp That Died Face Down in a Plate Of Slimy Egg Noodles and Chunks of Canned Peppers."" The ""7 Oz Sirloin Steak"" ordered Medium -Rare was actually ""A Burnt 3 Oz  Strip of Overly-Salty Beef Jerky, Offset By A Beached Whale - Shaped Lump of Hardened, Boxed Mashed Potatoes."" To be fair, the waitstaff was super-nice though they were obviously told to up-sell us every chance they got.  We left our meals virtually untouched and got sushi across the street. Stupid Eric for being right."
Cindy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",75,214,274,3.0,2/13/2012,"I have mixed emotions about this place! It stresses me out when I get stuck between ""A-ok"" and ""yay I'm a fan"" gggrrrrrr! I don't find this place to be unique or should I say nothing about it makes it stand out (IN MY EYES) the service isn't the greatest and even the ambiance in the place is not all that excitiing. The food has been good/ OK nothing horrible which saves them from a 1 star or NO STARS. This last time though the fries and the spinach artichoke dip were excellent. Like I said I'm just not there yet! not to the point where I can say I'm a fan there is something missing! They do have TV'S and a bar area but It just doesn't do it for me. I will visit the place but occasionally not regularly. I'll be back to EDIT my review if I get WOWED! on any visit (:"
Doug P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",246,8,1,4.0,8/12/2015,My girlfriend recommended coming to this place for a nice dinner and I was not disappointed! Good service and a well cooked meal.  Will definitely come back soon.
Mark V.,"Kennewick, WA",0,14,,4.0,1/4/2014,"I was very surprised by Applebee's today. We had eaten many times at the neighboring places, but today we had a gift card, so in we went. The decor is somewhat dated, and the table wasn't clean. My friend thought the coffee cup was not clean, and mine was cracked inside. Three stars for that. But the staff were very friendly and we give the service five stars. The surprise was the food quality, which is again five stars. I had a Cowboy Burger, and my friend had the Salmon with a salad. Both meals were outstanding. Unlike most restaurants, the coffee was drinkable also.  The best burger I've had in years was only ten bucks, with a baked potato. It was cooked in a reasonable time, served with a bright smile, and so generous I had to leave a little potato behind.  We will return."
Nick M.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,17,,1.0,6/7/2014,"Food is not great, manager is rude. service is average. Will not go there again. There are other places with better food and better treatment."
Habacuc H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/25/2015,My server cristian was amazing! Was very helpful and made me feel very comfortable! Definitely coming back. Will ask for him again next time I come
Patrick B.,"Chatsworth, CA",20,17,4,3.0,7/24/2014,I'm really torn on how to review this resturant. Because for desert I absolutely love them. But for dinner I am not a fan. So start with desert. If that's why you are coming here. All the deserts are great. I am a chocolate a holic so the tripoli chocolate meltdown is to die for. Mixture of triple chocolate and ice cream. Oh god it's good.  Now dinner or lunch. The food is ok to good. Nothing is great. I can't think of a singleness I'm excited to have.  Last service . Service is slow. Which is a problem for me. It's fine for desert cause the can handle that easy but not dinner.
Al T.,"Los Angeles, CA",226,577,29,3.0,3/7/2015,"Very average.  For lack of a better comparison, Applebees reminds me of room service food.  Every time I eat there, I just think ""this is about what I'd get if I ordered a room service meal in my hotel room.""  Last night I got the ciabbata chicken sandwich. It had bacon and jack cheese and tomatoes in it, and some interesting mayo-type spread on the bread.  It was fine but not worth the 12 bucks they charged for it.  I swapped the fries for a house salad that had way too much bacon bits.  The others I dined with got salmon and they said it was good.  For dessert, we had a brownie sundae (split between us) and that was pretty good.  They now have mini computers at their table from which all appetizers and desserts can be ordered.  So, we used that...although the touch screen was sticky and somehow the order never got placed, but the very nice waitress made sure we got it.  The computer also displayed our final bill and we swiped the card and even included tip on there (reminds me of the new technology they have in many cabs nowadays!)  All in all, a good dining experience.  Friday night, zero wait, and we were starving...you can't go wrong at Applebees."
Martin F.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,186,89,2.0,4/10/2014,"No complaints about their food. The service though is not good. Slow and unpredictable. When your server takes your orders good luck seeing him/her again. Different people will come serve your food each time and when you need a drink refill and you ask another server to do it since your original server is AWOL, you get this face from them like ""that's your server's job not mine"". I have been to this location three times and the service was subpar each time. No improvements. Sorry but that's what it really is. They really need to step it up with the customer service here!"
Stephanie V.,"Van Nuys, CA",246,88,3,4.0,6/7/2012,"I had never been to this place, let alone heard of it. I watched a movie called ""Couples Retreat"" where one of the lines they say is "" you dont want to end up alone at Applebees"" well ever since ive been wanting to eat at this place but hadnt had the chance. So finally one of my closest friends birthdays came along and he happens to LOVE this place. So we went to dinner here.  Let me tell you i wansnt dissapointed at all. 1. there drinks are AMAZING and best part we got there 15 min before happy hour but our waitress gave it to us as happy hour and didnt make us wait.  2. i had this penne pasta OMG!!!!! Best plate i could have asked for it was really good.  I would def. come back to this place. there was no waiting time. We were well taken care of. They were super nice. The only reason i gave them 4 stars is because they have this older lady who fills your cups with drinks, but if you ask for what you originally had and she doesnt have it she has a big fit!!! hahaha its like really its your JOB! But overall great place!! :)"
Logan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,31,,5.0,4/28/2013,Just moved out to the area recently and haven't been to an Applebee's in a long time. Came in twice and on both occasions the waiter was extremely courteous and prompt to take care of us-- including my girlfriend's incessant necessity of Ranch dressing to garnish every dish. Food came out great and we will be frequenting this restaurant more and more. :)
Jeremy B.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,45,166,3.0,1/24/2012,"Moderately good. I had the Three-Cheese Penne. It was bland, but ok. My fiancé had the Oriental Chicken Salad, and that actually was better. Service was pretty good. Server was always on time to ask for anything.  Three stars because I don't know if their food will be better than most 3 stars, but the service was definitely a key factor. It makes a visit better every time."
Sabrina A.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,53,26,1.0,1/12/2014,"The food was okay, nothing spectacular. I had the sampler platter the chips were all broken how was I going to scoop up my spinach dip. The wings were tasty and the quesadilla was greasy. My husband had the cowboy burger he said it was okay too. The service was forgetful. Meaning Iasked my waitress five times for a spoon  how was I going to eat my yogurt. I ordered french fries, never got them, after asking three times, I was told okay I got it. Whatever for that alone I will not come back here again, Applebee's you lost my money"
Christine D.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,5,,1.0,1/18/2015,"This was my first time at an Applebee's. When I first walked in, I thought things were going to be great with the whole integration of the tablets to order your food and play games, but that was just the initial impression. We were a group of five, and we all got our food, but half-way through my friend found something wrong with his plate but was just so hungry he just ate the rest of it. Needless to say I lost my appetite of an already bland tasting and small portioned plate."
Jennie B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,3/6/2016,"I came here tonight with my boyfriend and his sister. We ordered the wong ton chicken tacos for appetizer,my boyfriend got the fiesta lime chicken, his sister got the chicken fajita rollup and i got a half rack(6 ribs) baby back ribs. The appetizer was honestly the best part of courses. My boyfriend chicken lime had the saddest looking tortilla sticks that were really soggy in oil and just plain sad to look at. His sisters chicken rollup could have been sumed up as a veggie wrap with just a dash of a strip or chicken. And then my baby back ribs were so small i would have thought they were only 4 and had so little meat on them while it was engrossed in the sauce it was more sauce than actual meat. Sad to say it was such a disappointing dinner that we shall not be returning ever again. Which is sad to say considering that the waitress danielle was very sweet and attentive but the food was so disappointing."
