Michael U.,"Los Angeles, CA",84,15,1,3.0,6/6/2017,3rd time I've been here and they've been out of the brewhouse crispy chicken plate I was hoping for. Good service. Waiters and waitress are always friendly. They never seem to be able to keep the good beersxon tap either. Still it's good for a quick bite.
Alejandra F.,"Los Angeles, CA",154,1,,1.0,12/20/2016,"I was very unsatisfied with the service. I came in with a big group of friends and we didn't come last minute but we came an hour before closing and it was obvious that our server didn't want us there. She took a long time getting drinks and the food took about an hour. Many of my friends and I didn't leave a tip cause she was very rude and didn't even give us our change back. On top of that i left my card there and even after giving them the last four digits and my full name they said they had to shred the card, which Is illegal to do, because they couldn't verify it was me. Plus they kept changing the story when I called the second time and  I don't plan on coming back here. That was my first time going and the food wasn't all that great either. I'm usually an easy person and I don't complain a lot but honestly I wouldn't come back here and if I could I'd give it 0 stars"
Matthew L.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/5/2016,The worst service I've ever experienced at a restaurant. I would recommend eating at the worst McDonald's than this place. The waitress who served us chatted with her friends and random customers without giving us any attention. The food quality has dropped tremendously. If I was stuck on a deserted island with only this restaurant I would rather cut off and eat my own limbs.
Mike C.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",1,26,,2.0,11/30/2015,I went in looking for a change from my usual eateries.  I eat out often but my wife won't let us go here.  I should have listened to her.  The menu seems to revolve around the bar crowd.  I settled for a plain burger with fries.  The burger was fatty and the fries were cooked in old oil.  I complained about the fries and they said the oil was changed right after my order.  New fries came out but I lost my appetite. Not returning.
Irene E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,46,5,1.0,1/12/2017,"Worst food ever!!! Worst ""manager"" ever!!! I went to tell the ""manager"" how horrible the food was and he took my information and told me that he would NOT do anything because anyone could say their food was disgusting. What??? What kind of a ""manager"" says that??? I wouldn't even eat it for leftovers and I NEVER waste food!!! Not even suitable for a dog!!! This is not even worth 1 star...it should be NEGATIVE 5 Stars!!!"
Julia M.,"Chatsworth, CA",15,8,1,1.0,6/24/2016,"This place is the worst on a Friday to come there short staff!!! Waitress are rude , the wait is way to long!! Come on people when you tell a customer it's going to be a few minutes ! That doesn't mean your wait is 20 minutes .. I won't be coming here any time soon again"
Raquel W.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,49,37,4.0,6/3/2016,They get the stars for the food our waitress must of been new or I d k I don't want to be mean but she did not give her 100% it's like we got no  utensil and appetizer did not come with serving plates ? We little ally had to ask some one else for refills on a drink that we asked for the refill to two did rent people !!! Applebee's your food is good but your service sucks ! It was like a bit rude for them to forget is when your place was not full and you had a full staff
Elaine T.,"Canyon Country, CA",193,54,76,1.0,5/17/2016,"I decided to try this place out a second time for my coworkers birthday after remembering their food not being good the first time I had it. Well lets just say the second time around confirmed my decision to not eat at Applebee's ever again.  It was a whole of group of us that came on a Friday afternoon around 1pm and the place did not look as busy as I thought it would be. Our server was nice however I don't think she did a good job keeping up with our big group. First off she forgot to bring me a glass of water after I had to remind her a couple times and it wasn't until we got our food after a good 45 minute wait that she finally gave me my glass of water. We all pretty much ordered the 2 for $20 deal that included an appetizer, entree, and two sides. I ordered the artichoke and spinach dip with chips for my appetizer which was good. However, I wish they would of at least brought out our appetizers to munch on while we waited for the rest of our food. For my entree I ordered a medium well steak which ended up tasting dry and hard to chew. I had to put a lot of A-1 sauce just to get some flavor and moistness to the steak. My sides included garlic and butter green beans and sweet potato fries. I was disappointed with the green beans because only a section of green beans had garlic and butter sauce and was not properly coated on all the green beans on my plate. Overall I felt our food felt rushed and was put together in a hurry. Food quality was low and service was poor. I walked out of this place not ever looking back."
anthony c.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",21,39,2,1.0,11/17/2016,Well here we go. Service very slow and not very good . But the big problem was the food. I had what they called a steak. I think it was an old   was tough enough. Don't bother. Run don't walk to most anywhere else.
Christina S.,"Canyon Country, CA",10,20,1,4.0,8/14/2016,"Food was good though, it was all pretty buttery. The picture showed more mushrooms with the Bourbon Chicken but Melissa (our server) went and got me tons of mushrooms that they even grilled for me. She was very helpful and nice. The price of the meal was a bargain at 2 for 25 bucks. That gives you one appetizer and two entrees. How awesome is that?"
Tim S.,"Studio City, CA",7,81,18,1.0,8/17/2015,"Besides the looks of the place everything else is bad! Very slow service. Bartender and waitress were very rude and took forever to get what we ordered. Drinks were not that cold like I expected and they don't give you lime or orange on the drink unless you ask several times, seriously?  ...talk about cutting costs.  So after 45 min we finally got our food yeyy!! Oh wait the mashed potatoes are cold and taste quality isn't  all there.  Maybe if our waitress wasn't socializing with her Co worker's she would pick up the food on time before it gets cold. We were late for our movie thanks to this slow snail of a waitress and I will not be returning here, ever!"
Justine M.,"Canyon Country, CA",111,4,,1.0,11/18/2016,My boyfriend and I decided to try this applebees out since we haven't had it in years because the one near us was closed. Let's just say it was closed for a reason. The food was horrible! Our waitress was very nice tho but I give the food a big F
Bob S.,"Chatsworth, CA",1,13,,1.0,4/23/2016,"I wouldn't go back there on a bet. My wife ordered a pulled pork sandwich that was so bad they took it off the bill. I ordered fish and chips. I was hard pressed to find the fish. Should be renamed to Batter and Chips! Service was great.. Food sucked! Parking is also a joke. Even though there are ample spaces, Applebee's door is on the East side of the bldg, but parking is on the Southwest side. Being handicapped it's a long walk up there ."
Estela R.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,49,27,3.0,9/13/2015,"My experience here was between fair and good.  A+ for the customer service,  food was eh. It wasn't bad,  but it definitely didn't leave me wanting more. I wasn't disappointed though because that's exactly what I expected. Portions were pretty big,  and pricing was reasonable, but I guess basic, lackluster American fare is not my thing, but if it yours, then Applebee's is the place!"
Jordan L.,"Sebastopol, CA",339,6,,5.0,9/4/2016,Five stars for LAURA! She was so sweet and a wonderful server. She made sure our orders were correct and offered us great advice for deciding on a meal. Thank you Laura!
Pete T.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",134,86,185,5.0,3/21/2016,"Ok, call me crazy, but I love one item on this menu, lol.  It's the full order of the crispy Oriental Chicken Salad.......the dressing is the best.  I'm not really an Applebee's fan any longer, but I do go occasionally for this one item & they consistently make it perfectly.  It's a good place to go have a meal with the family & I really like the curbside parking spots they've designated for carry out orders, that's really cool!"
Brianne P.,"El Mirage, AZ",6,33,9,2.0,7/25/2016,Food is decent service is usually great but it's not my go to. Sometimes the food is bland or very small portions. We usually only go for only happy hour prices.
Nurse L.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,22,9,4.0,6/27/2016,"First time here with Sam Hook . The bartenders were nice and friendly. We played the games on the the touchscreen provided at the bar. It was happy hour so with that, We Had a good time here at Applebee's. Will come back one day.."
Tina G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,2,5.0,5/9/2016,Stopped in before the movie's. Had a quick meal. We love the $20 special.  Shelby was very efficient and helpful and made sure we got our meal before the movie started. We will be back!
Daisy C.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",6,45,6,5.0,4/11/2016,Ive been to this location twice. The employees are very nice and attentive. The first time i visit apple bees the lady was so nice and even recommended a few drink. Two weeks ago i visit this location again the food is good not great but edible. Although we had a difficult person in my party the employee didn't hesistate in helping us out and provided us with good customer service .
