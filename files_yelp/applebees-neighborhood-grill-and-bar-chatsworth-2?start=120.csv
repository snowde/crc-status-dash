Stevie B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,,1.0,2/18/2016,I've been coming to this specific restaurant for year's. But recently these past months they have move manager's around that's fine. But why make the  biggest mistake by making a ex BAR waitress a manager. I believe her name is Sandra or Samantha who cares she is extremely rude to my wife and I. Then she acted like she was the owner and couldn't be touch LOL. Talk about letting your position go to your head. I still go because I love the food but when I go she knows we dislike her extremely.  Beware of her everyone....
Lon M.,"Canoga Park, CA",1,62,3,2.0,1/6/2017,"Starting on a good note my wife seems to love the food here. Me not so much. First I don't like the service at this location and never really have. You'd think after all the many bad reviews on the service at this location they would have cared to do something about it by now but they don't care here. Nor does the upper management for Applebee's chain either. This place is service with all young adults mostly that don't seem to care much or provide all that great of service. This is a yuppie joint for young people. A bar basically surrounded by a restaurant just like the garbage Red Robin chains.  They seem to change their menu too often. They use to have this pretty good chips and dip on the menu, then it was just taken off. All the other appetizers at Applebees is mediocre nothing special. The pretzel thing with beer dip whatever is not all that great after a few bites. The steaks here are nothing better than  you could get at any Sizzler. Too much money for what you get imo. Not worth it. They have a bit better steaks at Chili's for around the same price. Really the only item on Applebbe's entire menu that I like is the fish & chips. I'm glad I found something I like to eat there at least seeing my wife likes this place so much. I get annoyed coming here. I don't like the crowd and noise and the servers here are too busy to give a rats about the service for any particular table. Been here numerous of times and it's always that way. You need anything, usually you have to stop someone to ask because the waiter can't be found. Another of many joints who take your order and then have somebody else bring out your food. Then you hardly ever see the waiter or waitress again to get drink refills or whatever you might want. Has happened on most every visit I can remember.  Also, after being here A FEW TIMES THE RESTROOM SHOULD BE KEPT CLEAN AND IT IS NOT! On 2-3 visits the men's bathroom is out of towels and the bathroom a bit filthy and you can tell it hasn't been cleaned properly. I mean after 2-3 visits and the same thing? Come on! Management here doesn't care. Notice by all the replies the management has left on the reviews here? LOL.  The Food: Besides the fish, the rest of the food I've ever ordered here (steaks, burgers, appetizers) is all just blah boring food and nothing special. Not even worth the money they ask imo.  Got to agree with another reviewer on here about the parking. The lot at this location sucks, is not handicap friendly at all because the entrance is way out on the street instead of the parking lot and if there is a long wait at this place I instantly want to leave because it's very uncomfortable with no room to sit hardly at all. Not even worth a 10min wait here. Loud inside and not a place to have a nice quiet diner at all. Or good service. And the background music they play is Taylor Swift and annoying yuppie new techno music.  If it wasn't for my wife liking this place I would never eat here.  And this is one of the very few restaurants that doesn't have Clam Chowder soup on Fridays? Wth? lol"
Artemis D.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",3,34,1,5.0,2/26/2016,"If you have any questions/concerns, ask for Jeff the manager. He's great. Kind, patient, willing to do whatever he can to help. The food quality is great. The salmon is about half of what is shown in the menu picture, but other than that, portions are as expected. Delicious food. Fast service - I only had to wait 10 minutes for an order to go."
Meli N.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",703,225,1807,3.0,11/17/2013,"My friend from out of town was craving French onion soup & she's use to having it from her local Applebee's. I guess it was alright, but I wouldn't be rushing back. I ordered the boneless wings with the spiciest buffalo sauce. Very salty and the ranch dip wasn't helping.  Service was good & the place was busy, but we only had to wait 15 mins."
Jessie S.,"West Hills, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/6/2016,"I am really pleased with the ownership at Applebee's and their commitment to this community and its families. I was contacted by the owner shortly after our fundraiser experience. He was extremely sorry for the way that everything played out that day. He was not aware of what had happened that day but as soon as he was, he took immediate action to contact me and was more than happy to issue us a refund for the difference. I also received a letter in the mail again apologizing for the whole incident and his willingness to work with us in the future. This is the kind of ownership needed in our community :)"
Angel M.,"North Hills, CA",88,58,175,4.0,5/11/2014,"Their menu has improved with a bit more healthy options which is a good reason to stop by.  It convenient to grab a bite before or after watching a movie.  But, the reason why it's boost to four stars is because of their late happy hour.  The service can be a little slow, but in their defense they try."
Patrick R.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,8,,5.0,5/18/2016,My wife and I ate at this restaurant on a Friday afternoon our waitress was a young lady named Jessica she was very nice and very knowledgeable her service was outstanding.  The good was properly cooked and very tasty.  We also had a drink from the bar and we found those to be very well prepared.  The entire dining experience was very enjoyable.
Andy A.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",176,11,2,5.0,3/17/2016,"Walked in because other nearby restaurants were busy for saints Patrick's day . Ruby was excellent, not to mention her mom, mom was absolutely nothing but the gave us the best customer service. Really changed my mood from being annoyed of the wait from all other places . I will defiantly come back because of the moms service . One thing I do regret is not getting her name, thank you mom and ruby!!! Food was good..."
Melinda M.,"Canyon Country, CA",2,38,,3.0,10/17/2015,The bathrooms were very gross. The women's room and the men's room (My husband told me).   It was also so cold there.  I felt like I was in a refrigerator while trying to eat.
Gregory W.,"Van Nuys, CA",18,140,6,5.0,1/17/2016,"I'm giving 5 stars based on my low expectation.  Any time I eat at a chain like Chili's or Friday's, I'm shocked at how bad it is.  We went to Applebee's before a movie for a drink and a quick bite fully expecting it to be aweful.  I was pleasantly surprised to be served very decent food and drinks for a very fair price.  I just know if I go back it will be aweful so I'll hang on to this feeling for a while."
Ally L.,"Los Angeles, CA",95,8,4,1.0,11/15/2015,"Horrible service , very rude employees I honestly expected more from apple bees I was excited because of all of the commercials I have seen but very disappointing , I do not suggest going if you are close by I do suggest going to The Habit instead"
Luna W.,"Reseda, CA",13,102,,4.0,11/29/2015,"I like Applebee's. I like the vibe, it makes me feel comfortable. My cousin and I like going here to chat and catch up. We like ordering from the 2 for $20 menu. He went for the chicken tenders and I went for the Chicken Penne pasta. That pasta dish is my favorite at Applebee's, it is absolutely delicious. The 2 for $20 also comes with an appetizer (we got mozzarella sticks). Everything was yummy and we'll most likely come back here to catch up again another time."
Anthony E.,"Woodland Hills, CA",734,107,57,4.0,8/31/2015,"This Applebee's gets saved once again by a wonderful server.   I wish I caught her name, but I did not notice a name tag.   She is light complected with red hair thin build with an amazing sense of concern for her customers.    While the restaurant was decently busy, the wait was not too long.  The server was prompt to greet and take our orders... It definitely appeared that she was a bit overwhelmed carrying the load of her coworkers, although this did not phase her one bit.  Unfortunately, there were several mistakes in regards to our order and request due to the fact that she was delegating the request onto others who were failing miserably.  I can see how hard she was working and appreciated her follow up with us to make sure the task she assigned to others were completed with success.  She seemed more upset than us that her fellow staff members were dropping the ball over and over again.  Every error she discovered was quickly corrected and she seemed to be genuinely apologetic so we never felt angry or frustrated that our meal was being compromised.   She even went as far as getting her manager involved and removing the appetizer from our bill and offering a 10% discount on the remaining bill.  This was not expected since we did not request or complain about any of the mistakes.  That's just how observant and caring our server was!!! Overall the meal was still very good and the taste of everything was to our expectations.  The experience as a whole could have been a disaster if it were not for our passionate server and her keen eye.   I can't express how much we appreciate this type of service!! You see we are all human and everyone makes mistakes... It's how you go about correcting those mistakes that makes all the difference in the World!!!"
Anali C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",3,50,,5.0,9/10/2015,"I'm writing to let you fellow Yelpers know that as far as Happy Hour goes, Applebee's can't be beat. I mean, maybe you could argue that but anyone that has been to Happy Hour here can tell you that it is a pretty good deal.  Most of the drinks (even the normally expensive ones) are $5 or less. My premium vodka is $5.50 and the Long Island Iced Teas are $3.75. Some shots are $3! And when you drink, some of the appetizers are 50% off. We tried all of them and the wings are good, the mozerella sticks and the chicken wonton tacos are great!! Honestly, I can't really vouch for the food other than the appetizers.  I love the appetizers and the prices of the alcohol. If you're looking for a cheap night out with friends and you're looking to drink, give this place's Happy Hour a try and I promise you - you won't be disappointed.  P.S. The service has always been good when I've visited. No complaints there either!"
Jonathan H.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",12,56,2,2.0,10/18/2015,This is the second time I've been to this location in the last year. I gave it a second chance after the first time I was there it was nothing special. I went with my family there for lunch today. I got a two for 20 special which consisted of a garden salad and smoked honey riblets. The meat was awful. I'm not quite sure what it tasted like. It's kind of hard to explain. The meat was overcooked and a little grizzly. It did not taste like a real rib. The sauce was okay. I drowned the Riblet and enough sauce to make it somewhat palatable. My wife just had chicken strips. I guess how can you mess that up. The Diet Pepsi that came was flat and I was trying to make out what exactly it tasted like. The thing that surprised me was how packed the place was. I'm not quite sure why. We had a gift card. We will not be coming back. Ever.
Forevermemorable F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",16,496,1497,2.0,9/14/2015,"I had a little difficultly at first with the hostesses.  I was there on Monday for happy hour and there was a advertisement on the table that said happy hour was during any time that the football game was being televised (which it was on every single TV in the restaurant...at least a dozen TVs).  I asked about getting happy hour and the hostess said that it was not going on.  I than mentioned the ad and the hostess said that she did not know what I was talking about and that it still was not going on.  So, I grab the ad and showed her and she said that she had to talk to her manager.  What is there to talk to her manager about...its Applebee's ad that is put on every table in the bar.  Its called common sense! Okay, so manager told hostess that the ad is good...obviously.  Service was slow!  The table next to us wanted to get out of there for some time, but they did not have their check.  I ordered a drink, but it took about 7 minutes to actually receive that drink...almost received at the same time as the food.  In all reality, the waitress seemed to occupied and too busy.  A runner brought out our food, but one burger was missing the bacon stripes, another burger was missing the dressing...the manager came back with the missing items.  Our water glasses were never refilled once and it was pulling teeth to get a refill on my beverage.  I more felt rushed by my server, probably due to the fact that she seemed super busy and a tad stressed.  Maybe they were short that night and she had extra tables...I am not sure, but this truly was our first visit to Applebees and probably our last.  In fact, my family was here celebrating my birthday...not a very pleasurable experience!"
Jonell H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,1,1.0,6/10/2016,So I wouldn't normally write a bad review for average service but I'm currently seated and thought I'd share my thoughts so far. The establishment is clean and they are prompt on cleaning and prepping the tables. The person taking care of us is very polite and well mannered but the service is below average. Placed our order at 9:15 for our meals. It's currently 10:15 and we haven't received our food yet.  No one has checked on us or even refilled our water. It is not too crowded with people either. Overall unhappy about the service and I probably would not come back again. Or maybe Friday nights just aren't the best nights to come.
Laura C.,"Hollywood, CA",190,163,253,4.0,7/19/2013,First time here last night and I'm surprise the food is good but nothing special.  Service is great..waitresses are really friendly. Great location. The restaurant is nicely decorated.  I came here during happy hour and the specials are really good. Id come here again but during happy hour to take advantage of the drink specials. For appetizer I tried the artichoke dip and that was delicious.  I got the Cajun shrimp pasta and it was ok.
Lauren P.,"Pasadena, CA",173,737,663,3.0,4/12/2013,"Location Great location, right next to the movie theaters and just down the street from the mall.  Staff/Service Each time I've gone here the service has been good, maybe a bit slow but more than accommodating. Normally, I stop by here for happy hour which is typically served at the bar but since they didn't have any booths available they sat us somewhere else but still honored the happy hour prices. Another notable factor when it came to service is that they are always willing to split the bill which is awesome because some people carry cash and others only have their card; it just makes things easier. Food Typical American food, hamburgers, pastas, sandwiches, ribs, blah, blah, blah . . . The food is okay, not bad, and it gets the job done. I wouldn't go here just because I was dying to get my hands on some of their food. Overall Foods okay, great specials, convenient location, and just an a-ok place. Recommendation $5 Sangria Saturdays"
Everett C.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",6,9,,2.0,7/18/2015,Very disappointed. The service was great. The waitress and host were very polite and attentive. The food is another story. Very salty and it did not seem like any care or attention was given to the food. Looked like it was just theown on the plate. My beef was supposed to be medium and it cane well done. My sons mini cheeseburger was burned and he did not want anything to do with it. This was the worst Applebee's i have been to.
