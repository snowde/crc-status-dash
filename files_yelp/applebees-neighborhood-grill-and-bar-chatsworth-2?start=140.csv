Christopher M.,"Clarksville, TN",118,9,19,5.0,7/30/2014,Celebrating my birthday a day late at my favorite neighborhood grill. Yummy. I always love Applebees... It is like a little slice of home
Emily A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,32,4,5.0,9/22/2015,Friends and I love coming here for happy hour! We've been attended the most frequently by Rafa and Pamela they are really quick and and friendly.
Aleksandra V.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,16,3,5.0,12/27/2015,"Although they made us wait a long time, the manager  compensated my family with our whole order being on the house. I always come here and I'm never disappointed. I like the service and the food is great. This experience just made it better!"
Bianca F.,"Sylmar, CA",0,6,,2.0,5/1/2016,I would initially give this place 5 stars for great food and great service but today my husband and i walked into a not so busy day and we were sat right away however our waitress Shelby was not so polite after it took her over 10 minutes to even give us the time of day after taking our order she had attitude and was snooty.
Sailgirl S.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",59,53,10,2.0,7/19/2015,"Dinner last night with friends before the movie. I don't think we'll patronize this AppleBees again. We were seated promptly. My husband who Never complains prompted management to the men's bathroom for an undisclosed reason. We were waited on by a curt watress who could have used a bit of politeness.  We all ordered, didn't have to wait long and out popped our dinners. my cup of soup was lukewarm warm and smeared on the outside with bbq sauce which I found out as the waitress handed it to me. My husband and friends ribs were fair, mashed potatoes were good. The ribletts (whaaat?) my friend ordered looked gross and we're served in an ""Orange is the New Black"" prison style metal tray. Her iced tea was luke warm. I poured my Husbands water into mine for my refill, thanks! Sooo, next dinner and a movie night we will eat elsewhere."
Marcin W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,12,,1.0,8/7/2014,"Wow. Are you serious? First of all the waitress seemed like he didn't want to work there. Secondly, instead of diet coke she brought regular coke (which is kind of a big deal when you're diabetes) after being told specifically why we need DIET coke Thirdly, grilled chicken wasn't grilled. It was roasted. Maybe... Also steak should have been medium, not medium rare. And it should be at least warm... And I won't even say how long we waited I'm sorry but if something will not change, I will never go there again"
Amber C.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,12,2,5.0,12/18/2015,"I go here on lunch sometimes. Every meal has been excellent, and the customer service is great (as others have said on here as well). Love the food! Get the sweet potato fries with one of their sandwiches... trust me. It's amazing."
Clotee A.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",381,40,259,4.0,4/16/2014,"My husband wanted to come here again and I was not disappointed. I had the succulent Cowboy Burger with smashed potatoes. it was packed with big slices of bacon!!  The smashed potaotes costs $2.50 extra but well worth the price. We ordered potato twisters but to be honest, I've had better. The first order of twisters had twisted too long in the oil, giving them a dark tan. We sent them back and got a better colored batch. The manager was a very polite gentleman who offered us a free dessert. He didn't have to say that but ONCE! We ordered the bundt chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream to go. Everyone in the place looked happy and full so we will definitely be back."
Angela A.,"Chatsworth, CA",1,22,2,3.0,1/12/2016,"Came here once with my family, not impressed. The place is ok, just ok nothing more. Food was not very fresh and we never got a waitress back to check on us, or ask if we needed a refill or extra napkin. Will not visit  them again. I figure if you spend money eating out - you have to enjoy it."
Tony H.,"Chatsworth, CA",332,278,1761,2.0,1/30/2011,"The food is either ok for the price or just flat out gross. If you care for your taste buds at all stay away from the riblets they're just terrible, it looks like the took the McRib & stuck shark teeth in them so it seems to come off a bone. The buffalo wing are dry & barley have any sause on them. The deals on the drinks are pretty good though, if you're coming to grab a drink before or after watching a movie at the pacific theater over there then this place isn't bad but other than that you're better off at Denny's."
William S.,"North Hills, Los Angeles, CA",1,6,35,4.0,5/10/2014,"We went for Mother's Day and it was a good experience. Excellent service.The drinks were good plus an appetizer to start. Then we order shrimp n Parmesan sirloin. Really good. Though it looked a little small, it fill us enough that we barely had space for desert. We love the desert. Try the butter pecan blondie. Really recommended. Will be back soon. Oh for the drink, try strawberry quencher lemonade. You would want to get another one!"
Kearstin E.,"Denver, CO",598,442,368,3.0,1/21/2013,"2.75 Stars... It was  'meh'/ok.  The game was on but not on all TVs, the service- well the waitress we had was really sweet and on-top of our refills so that was great.  The food was ok. We did the 2 for $24 deal and usually that's great- you get lots of variety and good food- well at other places that offer it.  from what we ordered: -fried green beans-  they were ok-  the sauces that come with 'em are pretty gross though and not very fitting -boneless wings- a bit too much batter and fat on them, good as an appetizer since you're starving but too much after a good 3- you're over them -alfredo penne w/ chicken-  VERY BLAND-  they just put a tiny amount of alfredo sauce- so it was very dry, no flavor, and the tomatoes on it makes it strange and adds an overbearing taste.  -fiesta fettuccini-  (something like that)  also VERY BLAND AND DRY.  I wasn't very pleased with the food here, it's like low-budget frozen meals  the atmosphere also- well the type of people that were in there were less than casual, and not the kind you want to dine around.  I know that the bar area is cool for evening happy hours, but the food is just too bland. I get the 2 for $25 deals at Fridays and Chillis- and the food never lets me down at those places.   Not much selection here on that option either.  Maybe other menu items are better-  I wouldn't go for pasta ever again."
Abel B.,"San Fernando, Los Angeles, CA",8,74,16,4.0,6/30/2015,"Came here for a quick meal with my friends on June 20th after a jethawks. We're served by Dallas, he took very good care of us. Dallas was very attentive and made sure we were okay and never needed anything our drinks we constantly filled. Food was great. Thanks Dallas for top notch sevice!!"
Danny V.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,36,14,5.0,7/28/2014,"Take two Applebee's...And action ! Well my girlfriend and I were in the area and we decided to visit Applebee's... The first thing my girlfriend said that she was so delighted to see our favorite waitress Kierstan. She truly made her experience everlasting. But we found a new waitress named Bernice who was just as awesome as Kierstan and to top it off Kierstan was working as well and was like the ultimate dining experience to have the best customer service in the Valley.  Thank you Applebee's staff and management you really have an exceptional team. Oh and I forgot the darn food... Well, the ribs are a must and according to Bernice to get them with the honey glaze sauce is the best way to go!!!! Which she was right... Oh my girlfriend had the double whiskey sirloin... Wooow is all she said as she did her ""The Food is Bomb"" dance in her seat... And for all the foodies out who hasn't tried the butter pecan blondie you are missing out on one of the best kept secrets!!! Yummy... Until next time.. Thumbs up!"
Sara W.,"Northridge, CA",129,352,8,3.0,3/4/2012,"OK, let's be honest. The food here is not very good. What is good is the happy hour. After 9pm, the drinks are cheap! $3.50 for my standard drink is no joke. And my glass was filled to the rim. I think it's $3.50 for wells, $4.50 for premiums and it ranges between the two for margs and long islands. Not bad at all. It's a chain with crappy food. However, the boneless wings are actually pretty good. The reason to come here is for the cheap liquor. The drinks do make the food taste better..."
Gabriella L.,"WINNETKA, CA",31,38,12,1.0,9/22/2013,"I'm totally grossed out with my last two visits. My last visit here I ordered a side of fries and at the bottom of the pile, there was ketchup that I DID NOT put there! Are they reusing fries?! That's so gross!!!  Today, I ordered another meal that came with fries and this time there was hair in there! Ew. After I complained, they took forever to get a new batch! Everyone with me was done with their meal by the time my new order came out. THEN!! Rather than any sincere apology, I got a compliment on my good eye! A normal server and/or manager would usually be concerned with what I just found. On top of everything, I still was charged for the horrible meal and service. I'm done with this place."
Arthur R.,"North Attleborough, MA",68,27,10,2.0,6/3/2015,Wings were cold and I have  never had liquid  spinach artichoke dip. Haven't  been here in a while. The food was not this bad a few months ago. I don't think I'll be coming  back even their  drinks are pre mixed.
Katherine A.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,4,,3.0,10/6/2015,Went in for Monday night football and dinner. Asked the hostess to seat us where we can watch the game she seemed confused and tried to seat us in the worst possible place to watch football. Burgers were actually real good but don't try to substitute a small salad for the fries without being charged an extra $2. I mean really?
Cherry M.,"Van Nuys, CA",110,84,50,2.0,5/11/2015,"This used to be a great spot to sit, relax, and enjoy some yummy food! The last couple of times I came here I wasn't all that impressed! One of the times I ordered the chicken lime plate that comes with rice and my rice was burned and crunchy (rice is not supposed to be crunchy). The waitress kindly gave me some more rice and stated that it was a new batch but sadly that one was burned as well. The last time I went I got the chicken penne pasta and they forgot my garlic bread so I had to ask for it. The pasta itself tasted like it had just come out of the microwave because it was cooked 2 days ago. Overall the place has gone down in my book. Maybe I'll give it one more try, or maybe not!"
A. P.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,82,16,5.0,4/2/2014,"First off, I like this place. It's not a restaurant you would go to and have ""wow! amazing!"" type food, but it's good! My boyfriend and I like to come here because the staff is always friendly, and they have a happy hour 7 days a week after 9pm. Which in my opinion is great, when we want to go out but can't spend an arm and a leg. There are plenty of good food options on the menu, and the 2 for 20$ deal is always a steal. 2 dinners and an appetizer for $20, can't beat it! If you come here during the late nite happy hour the appetizers are also 50% off."
