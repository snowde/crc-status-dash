Yvette B.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,23,17,3.0,7/11/2015,Was disappointed this trip. I got the chicken with Mac N Cheese. The chicken was ok but the Mac n Cheese was not cheesy. It was in the dry side and really flavorless. My friend ordered shrimp n steak and said it was just ok. They need to make the menu more flavorful again.
Mike A.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,18,16,1.0,6/7/2015,Greasy hamburgers waitress is nice won't come here again salad were good they have great fried green beans
Kelliann G.,"Avalon, CA",2,128,1,4.0,10/19/2013,"After reading some of the reviews on here, I'm not exactly sure what people were expecting out of Applebees... It's not a fine dining restaurant, guys. Come on! I went on a Thursday right before 6:00pm. We were seated right away, and our waitress told us about all of the happy hour drink specials ($3.75 for Long Islands and Margaritas?!). She brought us water first because the drinks were taking a while at the bar which was perfect. She explained anything we had questions on from the menu, and we ended up doing the 2 for $24, spinach artichoke dip, mac n cheese with chicken strips, and a half rack of ribs. Spinach artichoke dip was good! The serving size was pretty hefty as well, so you could definitely split it more than 2 ways. My hubby was satisfied with his ribs, but I can't say more on that. The mac and cheese was good! I'm not a bacon fan, but that's my fault for not looking at the full description. Oops. :P The chicken on top also had an awesome sauce on it, so I was happy! (: Service was amazing. The food was good, but make sure you know what to expect. Don't expect to pay $24 for a really high end meal for two. Come on, guys. It's Applebees! We'll definitely be back another time for happy hour! :)"
Dana G.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,9,5,4.0,7/4/2015,Great happy hour food and drinks. if you come and it's not happy hour they still have great prices. we love to eat and drink then go see a movie :) Applebee's is our place of choice! Staff is always pleasant and friendly at the bar too.
Anonymous A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,5.0,4/25/2016,"I came here to grab a quick bite to eat before the movie. The service is amazing. Food is delicious. And Matt our waiter was super friendly, he recomended the luna azul margarita which im completely inlove with. It wasnt a long wait for our food. It was a great overall experience. Great staff"
Antonio S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,8,2,5.0,8/1/2014,"I really enjoy this place, atmosphere is always great and food it's delicious, they are always adding new items which is awesome and service is always great.!!"
Ana H.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,58,24,2.0,5/26/2015,"My Husband and I went Monday, Nice girl took our order. once the food got to the table we did not get the soup we ordered. when we asked about it she said it was our fault that we did not question it when she said our order back to us. she was very rude to blame us and she was bring us other peoples things and forgot to bring us what we asked for. so we left a two dollar tip with a sad face on the receipt to maybe the manager will ask why. Yes we can go elsewhere and maybe we should only time will tell if they step up to get better or not. for this time is was bad"
Kathy P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,4.0,7/2/2015,"I like this Applebees, usually come for lunch or early dinner.  Our food has always been good and service great. Where's the beef? Last night around 6pm we had dinner and I ordered the full size appetizer Salsa Verde Nachos with Brisket.  I really enjoyed the nachos, but there wasn't much brisket.  I ate 1/2 of the nachos at the restaurant and hoped I just hadn't gotten to the brisket yet.  I checked  the other half when I got home and just a couple of small shreds of brisket.  While I wasn't expecting a side of beef, 5 or 6 very small pieces of brisket(not even bite size) left me disappointed.  I won't order this again unless they start to put in more brisket. My husband's scampi dish and my son's steak were very good."
Kathy M.,"Reseda, Los Angeles, CA",0,25,,4.0,4/5/2015,"It's been awhile since I've been here last. I had ordered a 7 oz steak medium. Food was good. Service was good. However, my steak turned out to be well done but I didn't quibble. I was hungry. The server did stop and asked how was everything and I did mention (after I ate half of the steak) about my steak being well done instead of medium which he did take notice to. So the server told me I didn't have to pay for the steak.  Good deal!  That knocked $10 off the tab.  Overall the food was good.  Thank you Applebee's."
Cinthia G.,"Calabasas, CA",0,9,,1.0,12/1/2015,Food was good and service was okay until we didn't tip the guy and he came outside and yelled at us for not leaving a tip. Will not be returning.
Marilyn S.,"Reseda, Los Angeles, CA",188,165,570,4.0,12/27/2013,This is a cool spot to eat at very causally with family or friends. They have a bar with certain discounts during the week and a happy hour. They have prices that are definitely bearable and they even have it to order in pairs. They have appetizer with two entrees for $20 or $25 and they have a good set of things to order from.  I like who when you go in they make you feel apart of your community. They have memorabilia up from local schools and they even have representation from CSUN. Pictures and team encouragement! The food is good and so is the service.
Patil K.,"Granada Hills, CA",2,16,8,3.0,2/16/2015,Great service by our waiter Andrew. When our food came out it didn't look too bad but after taking a bite I realized I won't be coming back. The steak looked grey and tasted extremely salty. We got 2 appetizers and an entree I could say the best thing were the Mozerella sticks. Everything else was way too salty.
Nathalie R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,5,5.0,5/9/2015,"Drinks were good and the appetizers were surprisingly delicious! My waiter was Ryan and he was very attentive. I understand that people make minor mistakes and I'm not going to rate a 1/5 stars because the bartender forgot that I didn't want salt on my margarita: don't care, I could just easily wipe it off, A DRINK IS A DRINK. However, Ryan was very cautious of my dairy allergy and the manager was sweet and understanding towards my concern of whether or not there was Parmesan cheese on the Kobe Meatballs. Great experience, best place to go before seeing a movie!"
Greg S.,"West Hills, CA",14,19,17,3.0,3/1/2015,Sundays pleasant. Service good. Fresh coffee. Led entertainment. Menu access w/touch screen at tables for viewing menu and ordering.
Sam Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,2,5.0,2/20/2016,The food was not only good but the service was great! I came to eat with my family and we were served by a waiter named Scott. It was a really busy night but he had a great attitude and kept a great smile throughout. His attitude and service made the experience at apple bees 10x better.
Cynthia I.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,39,20,1.0,7/11/2014,"I've only been here once and I'm never going back. They have terrible customer service. First of all out waitress didn't even greet us and just showed us to our table. Second she never have us any cutlery. My boyfriend ordered a drink and placed it between us and she came back to tell us not to do that because it makes it look like I'm drinking too, but she didn't remember to give us our cutlery. Seriously, my food sucked I ordered a ciabatta chicken sand which. Bread was too hard to bite into. We were so mad about the service that we just left. There's a stonefire grill next door and other food places. Better service than Applebee's."
Danny S.,"Wilshire Center, Los Angeles, CA",3,29,,2.0,3/27/2015,"Food taste ok no complaints but the service here continues to be bad, really bad. On this occasion it is only half full if at that and they are so behind with everything. Half an hour has gone by and our burger has yet to come out. Might look to eat somewhere else when coming out this way"
Frank W.,"Valencia, CA",0,388,10,4.0,2/1/2016,"The food here is slightly higher than other causal restaurant chains, but the food taste more decent. Minus 1-star for the service, though the overall service was fine and the hostesses at the door were very friendly, but it seems like every staff members are unhappy."
Jim G.,"West Hills, Los Angeles, CA",502,587,69,1.0,10/1/2010,"What the hell am I eating?  I made fun of the riblets all the way over in the car so you know what I had to do...yes I got them.  The first lesson I learned is to stop listening to coworkers that feel Applebee's is ""pretty good."" I figure I have about 10,000 more meaningful meals on this earth, which still feels like a lot, but this was one I would like to have back!  As I said, I did the unthinkable and ordered the riblets. I will go straight to these scary little nubby things and ignore the other 100 reasons I won't eat here again. First off, what exactly is a riblet? Are they ribs off a small animal? Are they the meat that dog food companies reject?  Still an unknown, I bit into my first piece. After some time manipulating a bite in my my mouth a small bone came out, or was that a shark's tooth? Either way it was a scary small piece of bone. I'm shocked they haven't already been sued from someone choking! Bite after bite it became this game not to swallow these pieces of bone. In the end I was not only grossed out but exhausted.  I'm thinking of starting a website where we can vote on the riblets origin, but then you would have to try them which is not a smart idea. I guess the riblet must continue to be an enigma, challenging the next generation to solve the riddle."
Treci M.,"Northridge, CA",99,67,52,1.0,5/9/2014,Just could not get it right  Steak was fatty and so salty it literally turned my stomach  Second order arrived with ham for his sage I asked for a turkey sandwich  Finally I left and went to piquito mas where I ate without my family as they stayed behind to finish thier meal
