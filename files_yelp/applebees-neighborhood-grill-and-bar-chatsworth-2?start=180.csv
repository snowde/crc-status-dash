Brenda R.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",0,2,1,5.0,4/8/2015,"I never thought that I would write a review about Applebee's but not only was my shrimp parmesan sirloin amazing, the triple chocolate meltdown was a 10,  plus the cute waiter told us about this crazy margarita that had a beer upside down in it with a shot of Grand Mariner on the sideYUM! Our waiter, Michael was; did I mention cute? He was funny and we loved everything that he suggested. He taught us how to play with the computer on the table, we had a blast, checked on us often and I told him that I was going to Yelp him! So Michael, thank you for a great time at Applebee's!"
Mary H.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",17,134,309,1.0,5/7/2013,"From 5 starts to 1. I honestly wish i could give it a 0. It was Friday night and we decided to go to Applebee's. We've never really have been disappointed in the past, didn't really want to wait for long dinner so Applesbees it was. Wait time was like 5 mins, waitress came took our order. We ordered appetizers and entrees. 20 mins goes by & no appetizers? We're baffled, why is appetizers taking soo long? We had gotten sliders and basket of fries.. Another 5 mins & by this time we're starving!!! note that the waitress hadn't even come over once to check in the 25 mins were waiting. Finally some guy comes out and has our entrees... Umm what happened to my appetizers? He's like uhhh I don't know, they just told me to bring this out. I'm like ok. I ask for a manager. Manager comes over and is like I heard you're missing something. I'm like yes, we got our entrees but not our appetizer, we wanted to eat the appetizer first. Shes like do you still want them? I'm like no not really, isnt the point of  appetizers to come before the entrees? She's like depends how you order them? (Basically telling me that I'm wrong) I'm like we'll I ordered appetizers and also entrees so that means I wanted them first. She's like well I can take it off your bill & give it to you to go. I'm like great thanks. So the entire time we're eating we feel ""blah"" and not enjoying our dinner because of that. To sum it up, we won't be going there anymore!  Side note: we asked one of the walking y waitress if one if the tv's could be changed to basketball (both were hockey) she said let me check. Never returned and the tv never changed."
Jonathan D.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,16,10,5.0,4/4/2015,I had the fish and chips which was excellent. Definitely try their shakes. AMAZING! They were super nice and the food came out quickly. Great experience.
B H.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,14,29,3.0,1/8/2014,"I used to frequent this particular Applebee's, yes used to. My last visit sucked from the service to management.  let's see one of our meals did not make to our table that's the biggest let down. The server didn't even notice she was too busy (I'm not sure doing what bc it was not busy) all management did was take the meal off the bill and said sorry with a lame excuse that a runner mess up. I used to sit at the bar and had ok service. Where was Lauren the past time ? She was a great very attentive. This other chick not at all  she let my beer sit there. Apps came out before the drinks. Didn't check on us after we got our food. Three stars bc the food is good. Defiantly I'm not coming back after this past time."
Monica S.,"Sepulveda, CA",6,8,6,1.0,7/12/2014,Odered hamburger and french fries at dinner time.  They gave me the burger but the French fries was leftovers french fries about 15 little pieces.  I know I didn't come here at lunchtime.  This is probably why I haven't been here so long.
Lou S.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,60,401,3.0,10/17/2014,"Good service, clean restaurant...food was okay nothing special.. I just like the 2 fir $25 deal"
Geneva S.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",198,171,158,2.0,4/30/2013,"Sunday's service was just awful. The food was good (once it arrived) but the service was just really bad. We got there at 2:30 and really didn't leave until 4 p.m. All we ordered was 2 kids menu items and 2 adult menu items. Our server said the kitchen was really backed up, however, a couple that arrived after us received their meal before us and was done and gone before we were even served.  I've been to this location several times and both my husband and I were disappointed in the service. Plus our server kept saying ""That will cost 2.49 more, this will cost 1.49 more"". Perhaps we should cut her some slack. She may have been new and thats why our food was served so late. However, I was not impressed with our service on Sunday's visit."
Sadie T.,"Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, CA",80,172,206,1.0,10/23/2015,"Ok I don't know why I even went back to this place after my dinning experience prior was not good. This time was even worse. At least the last visit the service was good but the food not so much. This time it was bad all the way around. Let me just start of with saying that for years Applebee's was one of those places you could count on to get a decent meal. It was pretty consistent as far as service and food goes but I don't know what happened but this place is consistently bad. Ok it's not like your going to get a fine dinning experience at a chain restaurant and that was not what I was expecting. However you should be able to get decent food. Nope not here honestly my food tasted like cafeteria food, not good. I just have to say do not get the pasta it was over cooked and gummy twice. The sauce was bland so you can imagine a bland sauce onto of a sticky, gummy noodle. Yuk just had a food flash back. I sent it back and chose not to replace it with anything else as my husband and daughters food was also not good. On top of the bad food our server was bad. It was so dead in there and you would think it was packed with the slow inattentive service we received. Our server was not friendly and seemed to not get the basics. The one thing I can say was the manager was very nice. Came over to our table and apologized for everything. I felt like she was sincere but at that point i was over it. I will not go back again. I hate writing bad reviews but this was my second bad experience before I wrote one. Sorry Applebee's but something has to change over there. The standards have slipped way down!"
Shelby R.,"Los Angeles, CA",298,2,,5.0,12/23/2014,"The meal was great I got the bourbon Street chicken and shrimp soo good. The perfect sangria Rita was also delicious. Our server was so nice her name is Shaina H. She was so cheery and friendly, so close to the holidays usually people who have to work don't seem very happy to be working but she was so joyful and kind,  I really enjoyed the experience tonight. I go out to eat quite often and I don't think I've had a server with such a great personality and demeanour!"
Liz A.,"Woodland Hills, CA",1,27,,1.0,12/22/2015,"Went there for a late dinner and we were told the kitchen was closed, even though there was more than enough time before they closed and they were still serving alcohol and food to other customers."
Laura Z.,"Arleta, CA",502,277,718,3.0,5/2/2013,"The staff is super friendly here. I'm not a big fan of food chains like Applebee's, Chili's, TGIF. Came here as a last resort to watch some football. They have GREAT happy hour specials. The staff here is really friendly.  We got mozzarella stick and spinach dip as an appetizer. They weren't anything special. I tried the orange chicken plate. It was just okay not too thrilled to try anything else. I would come back only as a last resort lol sorry"
Anthony R.,"Canoga Park, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/11/2015,"I came in on Veterans Day, the busiest day of the entire year for this restaurant. The service was impeccable! Even though they were very busy and very crowded, they made me feel like I was very special. As a Vet, I am very appreciative and I will be back!"
Erickson E.,"WEST HILLS, CA",341,38,,3.0,9/27/2014,If you can't find a chillis around the area applebeas is a great alternative since they pretty much have almost the same entree. This location is great since its close to the mall and the theatre.
Steven O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,712,1,3.0,10/12/2015,"A lot smaller than I thought it would be.  Food, drinks, service and ambiance were all pretty average."
Leslie G.,"Riverside, CA",0,17,2,2.0,10/17/2013,"NOT FOR MY LARGE PARTY For the past 3 years I have gone to this Applebee's to celebrate my birthday with my family (party of 11 or more). We were told we would have to wait 20 minutes we actually waited an hour 1/2. It was cold so we squeezed inside only to find they had forgot us, saw one if the hostess say it to another, people that arrived after us went in ate and walked out.  Finally they set up 2 tables (each sit 4 we were 12) we didn't fit so they had to separate us to separate stations then the problem with the waitress started and she passed us on to the best waitress there. I'm bad with names wish I could mention her but I don't think I'll need it I'm not going to got back to this Applebee's. They need to have somebody that knows how to deal with large groups they should have a plan and be honest if u can't at least say so, we could have gone to another place."
Devon W.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",0,16,5,4.0,11/17/2014,I like their low calorie items on their menu.  And they have a bar area with good appetizers.
Cj M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",12,8,,5.0,11/11/2015,"My husband, a Vietnam Veteran and I went to Applebees in Chatsworth California tonight as they were honoring all Veterans with a free meal. We had never Done anything like this before. I must say the respect the management and staff showed each and every Veteran young and old was amazing!!!  We will support this resturant continually as they supported all the Veterans today. Again, thank you"
Kathleen M.,"Boston, MA",56,28,4,3.0,6/17/2013,"When it comes to chain restaurants, it takes a lot for me to be impressed. However! Alyssa, our server, was great. Her drink recommendations were spot on (strawberry mango margarita was DELICIOUS) and her service was prompt. My boyfriend and I never felt like we needed to look for her like we usually do for refills or at the end of our meal.  The host was also very upbeat and cheerful, don't remember his name though. The food however, was meh. Your typical fried food that had a little bit too much grease left on it. The spinach artichoke dip was tasty though. My salad was so unevenly dressed its as if they didnt even mix up the greens.  Overall it was a pleasant enough experience, basically what we expected, but with an awesome server!"
Tracy Y.,"Reseda, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,1,5.0,9/14/2013,Visited a few days ago. BEST meal I've had in a very long time. Service was great. Food  was perfectly cooked. Arrived in a timely manner and was VERY flavorful. Will be sure to visit again. SOON. :-)
Kristy L.,"West Hills, CA",12,221,6,4.0,5/22/2014,"I had the Thai Shrimp salad, it was alright, the shrimp was much to salty, but the salad and dressings were good.  My Grandma had a regular burger that she said was delicious, and she is picky about her burgers. Service was great."
