Michelle L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,8,8,5.0,11/8/2013,"Went there with my hun for anniversary dinner. We had a blast. I ordered the three cheese macaroni and tenders -it was good. He ordered some chicken thing, he didn't like it, I tasted it and it was good. The Margarita was barely alcoholic though...to me. He got a cheesecake in apple pie ....that was weird..he liked it...we sent it back a couple of times because as I said it looked like a hot pocket cut in half, when he got to the middle he got the cheese cake but the rest was apple pie... Odd..I know. That's why I didn't taste it.  :-) oh and it's located next to a movie theater so it's a good place to take ur loved ones. Place was clean too"
Mark H.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",33,88,2,5.0,8/19/2012,I like coming here and eating for lunch. They have a variety of delicious foods. The waiters are so professional and very polite. The prices are fair depending on what you get. I would definitely come back here.
Roxy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,92,281,5.0,6/21/2013,"Mmmmhhmmm soo delicious!!.. i had a great experience tonight , my server was Noah! He was super attentive and made my favorite dish that they stop ped making quite a while ago.. The Asian chicken wrap!..  Now, I've been there before and  servers have said that they don't make it  anymore.. But Noah,  ""made it  happen"" ..  Therefore i had an awesome dinner!!"
Hanhie D.,"San Francisco, CA",257,142,109,4.0,9/20/2010,"Decided to come here for happy hour and give it another shot after the remodel. The late night happy hour is from 9pm-CL.  Friday's $2 pint! They have bud light, coors, sam adams, blue moon, miller light, shock top and a few others on tap. Do I really need to say more?? Such a good deal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The usual happy hour is $3 long islands, margaritas, under$5 appetizers and some other stuff. Every day they have a different deal. Friday is $2 pints, Monday is happy hour from 3-CL, Saturday is $5 mucho drinks. They have one day that is $3 well drinks but I dont remember what day.  What I'm trying to say is they have some good deals for happy hour! EDIT EDIT! - So, they now charge +$1 for any premium beers. WHACK."
Bryan A.,"New York, NY",171,158,62,4.0,7/13/2010,"I'm a little hesitant to put this up, but what the hell... it's yelp! After a brief stint of bad reviews and bad service, this particular applebee's had the all-too-common hollywood makeover by corporate. It's shaped up, clean, and actually quite empty!  ...which is a good thing in the Valley sometimes. When you're over the overpacked TGIF and the scattered k-bars, and you just want a nice tall cold one to end your workday with, this is a good place to chill. After 9pm, of course. For the happy hour, of course. $3-5 for appetizers (had the boneless buffalo wings, spinach/artichoke dip, nachos, and the WONTON TACOS... yes, thats wonton tacos), $3 draft beers, and something special for you each day of the week. i even saw wii tournaments on wednesdays for the gamers. Pretty much your typical happy hour right? Haven't tried the real food yet, to be honest, but happy hour is good enough right there."
Kristin A.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",54,160,343,3.0,7/18/2011,"Writing for a chain and writing it for Applebee's may seem like a sin, but I had to because well, I went to this location and frankly, it was pretty decent. Who knew that the staff could be so friendly.  I know from other reviews that some had a terrible time, but I couldn't believe that the front door was opened for me and my mother three different times - and not just from the manager. And the menus?  They have them in spanish and english. The bathrooms?  Extremely clean. Wait staff, kind and patient. The food?  Eh.  Not the worst, not the best but I think it beats out TGIFs.  And they TRULY have ""healthy"" options.  They've got the weight watchers points system down pat and just in general, low cal, decent flavor goods.  I had a chipotle grilled chicken breast with a bean and corn coleslaw.   Good portion, chicken had some heat the coleslaw was crunchy. Mom had a dessert shooter that was just the right size with what she described as really good vanilla ice cream. Also, another tip, $5 martinis on Wednesdays AND THEY have lo-cal drink options.  I'm just sayin..."
Anton E.,"Los Angeles, CA",427,1153,670,2.0,5/27/2013,"so this is the first time in probably 10+ years i have been to an Applebee's, and now I know why I have not and will not come again! :) I could not decide between a pasta, burger or sandwich, so i figured the simplest that no one could screw up, would be the Clubhouse Sandwich..well low and behold, that was screwed up!  I asked for it with no mayo, and add avocado and a side of coleslaw..now just to be clear, the order was correct and the waitress was very nice, friendly, and submitted/retrieved the order with nothing wrong but the flavors and overall sandwich by the kitchen was just blah the bread was way, way too buttery...my hands were golden with butter the ham tasted like cheap oscar meyer bologne, and the turkey was dryer than  a burnt turkey at thanksgiving the bbq sauce was straight from a bottle, and a gross brand at that, the coleslaw was sitting in  a pool of mayo, and the avocado was so minimal in the sandwich, i was surprised to see a piece fall out as i ate but, what can you expect from an ""applebee's""?? no wonder the Valencia location closed, thank god well, another dissatisfying and disappointing chain i will be sure not to visit :)"
Lacy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",114,124,5,3.0,3/4/2011,"What to expect from a chain? honestly.  They had a pretty nice happy hour - which is the real reason why my friend & I even went.   We sat at the bar. The bartender we had was really friendly and upbeat, which I always like. We didn't really order much food. I just got the boneless chicken wings. Honestly, I think they buy them in bulk from Wendy's or something, because they weren't that great, but it was okay. for $4 bucks! I got a really nice martini for only 5 dollars - which..if you know Los Angeles, is super cheap for a martini - even at a chain restaurant. I'll probably be back, to try out their real food because I haven't been out to eat at an Applebees since I was 12 years old! haha."
Christopher G.,"North Hills, Los Angeles, CA",197,24,18,5.0,7/21/2013,"I usually come on Sundays with my father and get a few drinks from Nicole, Sarah or Jonathan at the bar. We always get great service from them. They are the reason that my dad and I are here almost every week. Great job guys! **PROST**"
Teddy S.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",45,39,17,5.0,3/23/2011,Quesadilla Burger is my fav here.  We finally have one here in the valley & I was so happy bout this. Staff are so nice & so far; there are doin a great job! Keep it up Guys!
Kait R.,"Houston, TX",0,356,138,4.0,1/3/2011,"This review is only for the bar. Who knew Applebee's could be fun? I sure didn't. We had 2 hours to kill before a movie across the way and decided to pop into Applebee's for some drinks. The place reminded me of a TGI Friday's but minus the rowdy crowd. The bar area had plenty of seating on a Monday (football) night. Our bartender was personable and on top of everything. Since it was football Monday, happy hour was extended and we ended up getting $3 beers and margaritas, which I thought was a great deal. The happy hour food menu also looked enticing, but since we already ate, we had to pass. I will definitely be back for another happy hour visit and try the boneless wings."
Anna G.,"Chatsworth, CA",388,464,253,4.0,4/5/2012,"It was my first time here. I could not really enjoy the food because I was on a strict diet of only protein and veggies. I got their NY steak with vegetables. The steak was good but those veggies were disgusting. Worse than frozen, they smelled bad too. I love broccoli and their broccoli tasted really bad! Our server was sweet so the veggies did not bug me too much I guess. I also ordered a side salad and that was huge! I want to go back to try more."
Jeanne K.,"PACOIMA, CA",22,88,11,3.0,1/14/2013,"Food is ok, not bad not great. Inexpensive. Staff is polite and atmosphere is nice"
Svetlana S.,"CHATSWORTH, CA",262,348,196,5.0,11/25/2012,"Absolute best thing about any applebee's is they have happy hour from 2-6 i believe and then from 9-12? I'm not too sure if this is including weekends tho. This includes half priced specific appetizers and lower priced drinks. The service at this particular location was AMAZING!! People that weren't even our servers were making an effort to make our dinning experience a great one without us even having to ask them. We got two orders of wings, which come in classic buffalo, sweet and spicy and a few other ones and we got crispy wonton tacos I believe, They were all really good and came out VERY quick. I'll definitely be coming back for happy hour more often. It's located in the same plaza as the Pacific Winnetka Theatres about a block away from the northridge mall."
Lynnette M.,"Houston, TX",0,11,,5.0,7/29/2011,"I agree with the consensus that people need to keep in mind the fact that this is a chain restaurant. You should have known beforehand that you weren't going to find homestyle cookin here. So lets look at it for what it really is. In comparison to Acapulco's & Chilis, I'd say Applebees wins it.  PEOPLE, THEY HAVE THE BEST HAPPY HOUR! $3 beers & Margaritas EVERYDAY from 3-6 and 9-close. Girls, I recommend the strawberry-kiwi blended Margaritas. You'll thank me. I think its awesome that they open the doors for you when you arrive & leave. Memo to the Managers: Play better music on the weekend nights. You'll get people to stay longer...unless you don't want the money...?"
Virginia M.,"Winnetka, Los Angeles, CA",22,65,28,1.0,11/15/2013,"Bad bad bad and bad... Very poor service,.. Tonight was the last straw . We where seated immediately.. Great the host said your server will be with you shortly... Took over 15mins to be even acknowledge... Then a guy comes over said that he's not the server but he guess he will take our order. What!!! I understand it's a Friday night but come on. We placed a order for the trio sampler... Boneless chicken wings,wonton chicken tacos,and steak quesadilla. The table next to us which where seated after us already got there appetizer. Well we waiting another 40 mins then we got the famous trio plate.. Food wasn't super hot like it had been sitting for a while waiting for a server to bring it to us. We didn't say anything. Next we asked if we could order the chocolate dessert we waited.. N waited the young lady came to pick up our plates from the sampler and said did they bring your dessert out yet? Nope so we waited another 10-15 mins wow she finally brought over our desert ... Ice cream was melted and the chocolate fudge cake was cold... I then told the young lady Berenice m about the situation if she could take it away n just get us our bill... She then went to the manager jeff to tell him about the situation... I guess he didn't care he never came to our table to apologies or ask he we wanted to new one. The young lady brought us our bill apologized over n over stating she had two stations and  was pissed that the manager didn't come over.. If you care jeff you lost us as a customer.. Maybe you should stop chit chatting and help out your staff!!! Berenice I'm sorry I was a little short with you.. Annoyed with the situation...."
A Perfect Me -.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",1,22,,1.0,5/12/2013,"I choose Applebee's for Mothers day, because i wanted ribs, plan and simple.  i was not impressed, and now realize why i don't like this restaurant, and have not been in probably 2 years.   we ordered off the 2 for 24 menu. I ordered Ribs and baked potato, my daughter order  deep fired strip.  they were both OVER COOKED.   while i ate 1/2 of my ribs, my daughter probably ate 5 pieces of shrimp.   the services was slow, our wait person was nice and all, but more than once i had to try to find her for water.   the manager was around chatting up most  eaters who were of the same nationality as himself, not the rest of us.    Guess i should have had CHILI'S baby back ribs."
stell m.,"Winnetka, CA",0,20,,4.0,4/4/2012,"Great happy hour food, especially their bufflo wings and mozzarell sticks! (For a dinner or lunch meal do not get their alfrado pasta VERY bland). Yummy drinks"
Bill C.,"Granada Hills, CA",79,95,19,3.0,8/21/2012,"Good food for a large chain. I usually don't go to chains and prefer mom and pop ethnic restaurants. This place closed for a year or more but is open again and doing a good business. I think they had franchise problems. They used to have REALLY good margaritas made with lime juice instead of sour mix, but they don't anymore. sniff. The thing I do like about this place is that they have a 2 for $20 and a 2 for $24 meal deal that is very affordable for couples to go out and not spend a fortune. The portions are decent and with the appetizer, you'll definitely be full when you leave. They also have a nice Weight Watchers menu for those of us trying to eat healthy. Keep up the good work."
Ender S.,"Chatsworth, CA",2,37,36,3.0,5/22/2012,OK so the only reason ive rated this as 3 is because lets face it... its applebees lol..... The food sucks the ambience was made fun of in the movie office space... and the people who come to this place look like street bums.... BUT I WILL SAY THIS... GINA the bartender (who also By coincidence is a instructor at my gym) Makes the best martini ive had in some time. Perfect pouring and just superb service. I find myself here after ive gone to the gym an after dinner for a night cap... Best Martini ive had in sometime... Thanks Applebees and thanks GINA..
