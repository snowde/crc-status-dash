Diana L.,"Chatsworth, CA",710,18,1,3.0,8/3/2011,"There's not a lot to do in the SFV after 9pm, but applebee's has a reverse happy hour from 9-midnight! So my girls and I went out for a couple drinks. Although my Long Beach seemed watered down, it was only $3, as was the Long Island and Margaritas. Their peach sangria was really light and sweet, with fruit cocktail in it as well. And the waiter tricked us into ordering jello shots by bringing over a bunch on a light up tray and offering them to us for only $1 each. haha lame I know, but I'm easily amused.  As for the food, the spinach artichoke dip came hot, slightly burned on the top, but in a good way. It also came with tortilla chips and salsa. My favorite however are the potato twisters, which are spiral shaped potato chips served with this cheesy pico de gallo sauce which has tomatoes, onions, and jalepenos all mixed in with the cheese! yummyy! We also had the mozzarella sticks which were okay, and for Taco Tuesday, they offer $1 wonton tacos (chicken or pork), but those were lacking flavor. Good deals and open late if you're looking for a place to go to grab a drink on a weekday night in the valley!"
Jim A.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,44,17,5.0,7/1/2012,Idk why this place has so little stars the atmosphere is great the workers are friendly food is amazing gosh the managers are here and socialize with the customers and even go to ur table and ask how's the food great place to come to receive nice attitude and good food:)
Anne H.,"Burbank, CA",102,30,116,5.0,9/11/2012,"Had a great waitress named Britni. It's too bad the people at the next table kept calling her over to waste her time asking her trivia about the Applebee's commercial! Really?? The answer was John Corbin, the voice behind the commercial. Thank you again Britni, for still giving us excellent service while you where trying to deal with an extremely rude and difficult table! The food and drinks were good as always."
Carl B.,"Calabasas, CA",0,3,,3.0,7/18/2014,"Not bad, food was ok, the atmosphere was nice,over all 3 stars might go back in the future. Ordered the ribs they were a little dry but what do you expect for a chain restaurant. Not bad"
Mitra K.,"Los Angeles, CA",187,764,25,3.0,1/27/2012,"I must say since they've re-opened the service certainly has gotten better.  I do have one gripe however, the service is SLOW and I think it's not the fault of the staff but the management who don't know how to schedule enough coverage on a saturday night.  The drinks are good and not too watered down and overall I think this place is a step up from TGI Friday's."
joy h.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,121,52,1.0,2/22/2012,The drinks are a total joke....you get a glass filled 3/4 of the way and have to pay full price?  Seriously!!!
Willie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",120,50,31,1.0,3/4/2012,Worst ever my first time and last it happen to be the only one open after we watch a movie in the same shopping center food is cold service is discounting I can't believe it . It was about 10 pm Saturday night place was busy no one smiling . I guess you get what you pay for .
Mike G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,1,1,4.0,9/24/2012,It's a great place friendly atmosphere great customer service food comes right to the order I come here every wednesday night for diner
Alex C.,"Las Vegas, NV",121,71,55,5.0,8/17/2011,I went 8/10/11 and got there just when their awesome happy hour started... Service was good and staff was nice. Only bad thing is no cell phone service but overall great!
Adriana E.,"San Fernando, CA",1,26,16,3.0,2/29/2012,"service was great and the servers were all very friendly.  Food was average, but always a comfortable setting."
K W.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,19,1,1.0,1/17/2014,Had one of my most disgusting experiences at this restaurant. Sent back a carafe of wine that was filthy on the inside and outside. My husband watched as the manager (Moses) poured the wine from dirty carafe to the clean carafe.  Then when I refused the glass of wine and called the manager over he proceeded to lie and blame the waitress!  If there was anyway I could give them negative stars... Eat here at your own risk!
Meredith E.,"Los Angeles, CA",267,267,175,1.0,6/6/2011,"Late night happy hour every day from 9pm-closing.  Sounds cool, especially in Chatsworth where everything else closes super early but the drinks, food and service were horrible.  The margaritas were watered down, the stale food took awhile to get to us, and the service was inattentive.  Stay home and call it an early night."
Sonny D.,"Los Angeles, CA",309,364,34,1.0,7/18/2008,"Went last night with my friends and yup what everyone says is true, the services in this place stinks. I even talked to server who use to work there and said how downhill it's gone.  It took the bartender 20 minutes to greet my friend and she had no personality."
Boomer K.,"NORTHRIDGE, CA",0,41,3,1.0,10/30/2013,"I ordered the parm serloin with shrimp.  the steak old and looked like a rubber eraser.  It was obvious it taken out of the freezer after days if storage.  ut was served in a soupy oily liquid.  when i told the waiter about it, jonathon c.,  he made bo.eye contact and always.looked away when i would speak to him.  avoid this dump. Youll ger ild frozed rubber food.  it should be called Gunkbees."
Marlene O.,"Lawai, HI",256,126,22,1.0,2/16/2011,I had not been here in over 2 years.  I use to love Applebee's but now the food just seems so tasteless and just not that great.  I disliked it so much I will never go back.
M K.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,63,1,4.0,6/14/2010,I went to this location after almost 2 years and wow- the service was so outstanding. Our server was so polite and seemed to genuinely care about how we were doing. He even went over the drinks menu to show us what's best for the buck! The food was pretty good too- there is an amazing 2 for $20 deal- and those portions are HUGE!  Maybe this is new but they have amazing drinks specials too (something different every night). I definitely want to go back!
Angelica M.,"ENCINO, CA",3,14,6,1.0,1/14/2013,"Staff is unprofessional, has no sense of good customer service, and racist. On January 11, 2013 at 11 pm three friends of mine and myself visited Applebee's in Chatsworth, Ca. To kickstart my birthday weekend Two of my friends ordered alcoholic beverages Jonathan Chambers the server asked for IDs walked off with one claiming his managers approval was needed the ID belonged to my friend who had came to visit from Washington for my birthday He came back and threw the ID on the table and said ""My Manager Isn't Going To Accept This"" Confused we asked what the problem was my friend handed him a 2nd form of id which was a Mexican ID that are issued to mexican americans when visiting the state as a form of identification He Grabbed the ID and with a smirk on his face said ""yeah we're definitely not accepting this"" As he threw the ID on the table again it was rude and un called for but most importantly racist so we asked to speak to the manger Umit Keskin general manager of the location,came to our table then told us he scanned her ID and it didn't match the system We couldn't understand how that was possible considering we've been to that Applebee's before and they never had a problem with her ID Neither has the DMV or any other restaurant we've visited and as far as im concerned restaurants dont even have a scanner to do that so he lied. it was obvious that he had to interest in listening to our complaints and he definitely had no intention of making us feel better about the situation it was then I asked for his name and the servers name and told him I'd be reporting the situation to their Corporate office as well as the bbb he again showed no care and told me to go ahead and do so. We right after went to tgifridays and ofcourse they had no problem with her ID. I personally have no intentions of ever bringing my business to this place ever again and am encouraging all my friends not to do so as well."
Bourch H.,"Reseda, CA",3,50,4,4.0,5/10/2011,"Overall I have to say I received great service from the moment I entered the establishment. I was seated in a timely fashion, they started serving me and whoever I was with right away. The few things I think would make the overall experience better is the waiters worked faster and better background music but then again the music is a taste thing. I will go back for more food since the food was good."
Alberto N.,"Northridge, CA",10,2,,1.0,4/21/2008,"What a horrible experience!  My sister was in town this past Winter (2007). She wanted to get some dinner before heading home. I said I'm down for anything so she suggested Applebee's. Considering I've never been there I said ""Sure."" ...What a HUGE mistake!  I don't know if anyone has heard of ""Chuck"" steak before because I hadn't. It was 2 bucks cheaper then the regular 8oz Sirloin steak. The Chuck steak had 10oz. I thought  ""Dude what an awesome deal!"" So as I ordered, I told the waiter ""Medium Rare.""  The order comes...and to my dismay was a friggin hamburger patty! I was like ""WHAT THE EFF is this???"" I had no idea ""Chuck"" steak meant ""Hamburger Patty."" I was terribly disappointed. My sister ordered that 8oz. Sirloin steak. She could not stop cracking up. It was difficult for her to eat! I tried her dish...and it was craptastic as well. In addition, the waiter was a douche. We ordered appetizers and he totally forgot about them. Not only that, but he never came to check on us! No tip for his ass!  I can confidently say that I will NEVER, EVER go back to this place."
Michelle D.,"West Covina, CA",81,16,,5.0,2/18/2011,"Both times I've been the service has been great, the sirlon w shrimp is delicious. Happy hour drinks are yummy and cheap ( $3 margaritas). This is way better then Fridays where the service and food has been lacking...as for the reviews if you dont like the ribs get something else, theres a lot of other choices. :-)"
