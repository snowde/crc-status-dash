Lily P.,"Spokane, WA",63,329,53,2.0,10/4/2007,"I got drug to Applebee's by Niece after attempting to eat at Mimi's Cafe but they had a full lot and what looked to be a wait outside.  I think she likes to come here because she used to go to one with her parents in NH but personally I think she just likes the name of the place.  Say it with me - applebee's - APPLEbees - appleBEEEEssss.  Anyway, came here once before and thought the food was beyond sub par, I'd really give them a 1, but this time it was decent so I'm going to give them 2 stars to average it out.   Last time I got some teriyaki steak and shrimp skewers with rice pilaf which was horrendous and some cheese dip appetizer which was also beyond grossly processed.  It totally wasn't cheese, it was cheese sauce (if you don't know what I mean, look up the definition of what American cheese is).  Sister would get some steak and shrimp with white sauce that she just adored but it looked very nasty to me - maybe I'm just a snob? This time Niece had chicken strips and fries, you really can't mess that up fries are really good here.  I got a chicken fajita rollup which was very flavorful, had a nice sauce.  It's hard for me to not eat this stuff and think it was frozen in the Midwest somewhere... Service was good though!"
Nancy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,161,25,5.0,5/14/2010,"Try the shrimp and parmesan sirloin, you will be surprised! Make sure its well done : o ) This is my fav. plate, its delicious! : ) I was there today, they recently opened up again!"
Adrienne D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1748,655,3621,2.0,12/4/2007,"I must be spoiled with all of my LA non-chain dining choices, because meals at Applebee's just aren't cutting it. But my friend likes Applebee's and we were starving and needed sustenance after another day of sewing clothes. So we headed over here and ordered. The waitress was very attentive and there was barely anyone in there, it was around 3 p.m. though. I ordered the fish and chips, with visions of Village Idiot-style ones...Yeah not happening. The fish was dry with some blah breadcrumb batter, the chips were just standard french fries. There wasn't enough tartar sauce! My friend's iced tea was really weak so she asked for a fresh one, which was also weak. I hope I don't have to go back, but their desserts did look good-- maybe they are doable? The $2.29 dessert shooters...Hmm we'll see."
Mark C.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,13,,1.0,7/31/2010,"We'd not visited Applebees in a few years, for two reasons. First, all of the stores closest to us in Ventura County were suddenly closed awhile back. Second, our last experience had been so poor that after complaining we were sent a $100 gift card from Applebees corporate. On this visit, at the recently opened store in Winnetka, we'd hoped to use up the gift card and have at least a passably decent experience. We were disappointed. First, we waited 20 minutes before a server finally came to our table. We timed it. 20 full minutes. Then, in his haste to make up for the gaffe, the manager ordered our appetizers and entrees all at once, and every plate arrived at the same time. We spent as much time trying to make room for the food as we did eating it. Third, the food was barely good enough to eat. The ribs were dry and almost meatless. The fajitas were bland. The spinach artichoke dip was virtually tasteless. The shrimp spinach salad was wet and droopy. Only the crunch shrimp appetizer had an appealing taste.  Needless to say, we've now written off Applebees. They give even chains a bad name. We'd be calling to complain, but what would be the point? We certainly don't want a gift card."
Mira G.,"Hidden Hills, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/4/2012,food is not good. they out of shrimps on sunday evening. very pricey for poor class restaurant. never come back to any applebees. yak! if you want to eat normal food for a good price- better go to Fridays. .
Joe W.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",113,35,10,4.0,6/11/2011,great place to watch the game and throw back a few beers.. and the servers are always great!
Pete R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,25,,5.0,5/18/2010,"THEY'VE REOPENED!!! Different mgmt company and franchise, so as they say, alls well that ends well. Great service and lots of awesome happy hour deals. Late night after 9pm is where its at."
Robert H.,"Fontana, CA",1,2,,5.0,5/19/2010,Great food and service. Restaurant was good before they closed the first time but is better now.
Katie P.,"Valencia, CA",294,310,1165,3.0,10/6/2008,"Alright... first off, its an Applebee's.... I knew what to expect before I went in. But the thing is, my friends and I were so hungry after a movie and this was the only place that was really open... so we decided to grin and bear it. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I would give the Oriental Chicken Salad I had 5 stars, if it werent for such slow and horrible service. I even knew some of the guys working there from high school.... awkwardddd. And there were tons of older drunk guys there trying to pick up older girls that were there for that very reason (can you say shitty dive bar?) that night. Everyone was happy with their food. It is kindof an upscale Denny's, but I was actually suprised at how good it was! We got the lunch specials (for dinner) and split them so we would each get appetizers and dinners and even desert for cheaper. And my god they gave me a HUGE portion of salad I could barely finish it all. And it was delicious. As well as their mozzeralla cheese sticks. Who doesn't love those?!"
Sally G.,"Canoga Park, CA",0,8,,2.0,6/6/2013,"So yesterday me and my best friend decided to go to apple bee's. we got a server called Noah. Great friendly guy we order the 2 for 20 I got the steak house with rice steamed veggies and a extra order of fries on the side. So everything was going good eat my buffalo wings. That's when the manager comes and bring us our food. I said oh I wanted fries. Then she says I could get u some. Then I said I had ordered some already (friendly) She starts shaking her head talking saying no as if I was stupid n didn't know what I ordered. Me and my friend looked at each other feeling the vibe. I don't know if it was because we look young ? I was so mad at her being a manager she should not be talking to guest with that attitude. I honestly don't know how she went up as manager? I was going to complain about the way she talked to me but she was the manager so she wouldn't have done nothing about it. I have been to this apple bees plenty of times always gone great. The server got our drink everything perfect that is why I give this place a 2 star it would of been a 0 because of the manager but the server was great. Basically the manager messed up the whole place. I am just shocked a great restaurant like this would hire such a women. If she was in a bad mood don't take out the food to customers with that attitude, makes u lose ur apatite !"
susana m.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/26/2013,If I could give this place a 0 I would!We went on a Wed.which Applebee's was not busy at   is where the problem starts are waitress as soon as she gets to our table gets there with an attitude.She doesn't even say hi and just ask us what we want to drink so we all place the drink order.We asked her if she could split our check she automatically says with an attitude that we could only split it if the table was split down the middle..so we say forget it just to leave the bill all together.she then ask us what we want to eat so we go ahead and place the order.Well once my brother orders his plate which includes a steak she then literally screams at my brother when she had to repeat something .My table did start laughing but it was only because we had never been treated  in such a rude manner.The whole time she was with her horrible attitude and basically threw are food plates at   the end we recieve our check and we notice she adds 15 percent tip which is what  where use to whenever we go anywhere with a large group it's was only 6 of us.If she would have been nice while she was helping it would have been fine we probably would have tipped her even more than the percentage required .But we felt that because of her messed up attitude we needed to talk to the manager .So I asked to speak to the manager he then comes over and instead of the waitress walking away she just stands there giving us all a weird   we explained everything that happened to the manager she then keeps on interrupting him and us and arguing that we were laughing at her and that all we want to do is not pay the tip.Which was not the case we were still going to tip her we just felt that because of her horrible service we had to speak to the manager.She kept on arguing with us saying that she can't believe that she has to help a large group and not even get tip..and telling us that we just had problem with tipping .Which as a hairstylist for me would not be the case I understand that  people should be tipped if they provide good service!!!I can't believe the manager a chubby Latino looking guy never told her to stop arguing .Once we leave we just hand her the money which at that point we where just ready to get out of there .She then follows us ton the parking lot to give us back 4 dollars that was leftover from what was paid ..the 4 dollars was in no way tip it was just leftover from the 100.We where still planning on leaving her the 15 we just wanted to talk the manager ...But the manager is useless moron that just waist his time helping the other white ladies that where complaining to.And the food had no flavor .no wonder this place had to be closed down and then reopened !
DG V.,"Granada Hills, CA",0,10,1,1.0,5/4/2011,"Hostess allows her friends to cut in line and be seated without full party.  Two were seated almost half an hour before the other four arrived.  Then four other parties who came after us went ahead of us.  Bad start.  Then we were seated at the dreaded booth benches which is like sitting on a rock.  After a forty minute wait for appetizers the entrees arrived one minute later so the appetizer was wasted.  Bad timing.  No apology.  No concern.  My order was wrong and got a quick correction but then my whole meal got cold waiting for the waitress to bring me some mustard -- 25 minutes later.  Again, bad timing.  No apology.  No concern.  We were offered only one drink refill.  The food is not outstanding in any way.  My burger was contaminated with the herb used on one of the shrimp dishes.  Disgusting.  Our waitress was a dimwit and was only prompt when it came time to give us the tab.  We used to be frequent and loyal customers and have had good service in the past but there is really no compelling reason to go back here and be treated like you don't matter when there are so many other places to choose from."
Carol Y.,"Long Beach, CA",3,24,4,3.0,5/7/2008,"I used to like applebees. Many times if I can't decide where to go for dinner, applebees was a safe choice. Although the food was mediocre, I didn't mind it...until they start changing their menu and to my dismay discontinued the BREAD PUDDING! I LOVE the bread pudding. If anyone knows where I can find a similar bread pudding, please please tell me!!!"
Carole D.,"Northridge, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/21/2010,"My friends and I walked to restaurant after the movie.  The service was terrible and I won't be going back if I can help it.  The waiter was unavailable.  We were served appetizers with no silverware, napkins, dishes and had to get up to find help.  Once the entrees arrived the steak was well done instead of medium rare and again the waiter was unavailable.  Too much hassle when there are so many other restaurants in the area."
Cynthia G.,"Glendale, CA",4,52,4,5.0,7/30/2011,"i love their 2 for $20, its amazing. also the under 500 calorie menu has great tasting food, it doesnt even taste like diet food."
Arn R.,"Granada Hills, CA",176,111,,2.0,10/27/2010,i tried applebees the first time it openned at the same location and i was disappointed. soooo when it reopenned a year or  few months later i thought i'd give them another shot. and my first instinct was right....food still sucks!
