Miguel G.,"Valley Glen, CA",49,88,32,5.0,3/29/2017,"I am giving it a five star because we were so pleasantly surprised. It's Applebee's not a 3 star Michelin restaurant.  Their dinner two for 25.00 was great. The steak was cooked perfectly, the French onion soup was better than I have had in some French restaurants and their Mac and Cheese and chicken was awesome.  We were only coming in for a drink but the bartender, Richard, made us change our mind. This man truly understands customer service and hospitality.  We will be back ."
M S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,5.0,10/7/2017,"I went to applebee's tonight for the $1.00 margaritas . We had to wait a while for a table because they were extremely busy, I guess we all want to have those $1  margaritas .  Anyway I have to say that I was very surprised that the margaritas were very tasty.  We order happy hour appetizers.  They were delicious too.  Mario our server was very friendly and efficient.  Even the manager came and talked to us to our table to make sure that we were doing ok.  She was also very nice and friendly.  thank you applebee's ."
Jessica R.,"Los Angeles, CA",317,9,18,5.0,3/22/2017,We went for a birthday dinner and received prompt service. Even though we brought our own cake they came out to sing happy bday which was pretty sweet.
Edmond R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/28/2017,My family and I went to this location this past Sunday night and we were seated by the friendly staff but the food was not good at all and it caused me to get ill. Also the booth's table was wobbly and needed to swept underneath. I will never go to this Applebee's location again
Belen G.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,12,1,5.0,9/22/2017,Came here on Wednesday around 3 with my husband and daughter. Both my husband and I are servers so we were not sure what to expect. My husband's standards are pretty high. We absolutely LOVED it! The 2 for $20 is an awesome deal. Everything was great from the service to the food and the drinks. I think our servers name was Amanda but can't remember. Definitely will be back thank you so much!
N G.,"Malibu, CA",0,5,,2.0,1/6/2017,"My boyfriend and I frequent this location at night  because it's convenient and the food is consistently good. We've had a blonde female sever twice who was fantastic, friendly, attentive, and prompt. If she had served us tonight, this would be a 5 star review. I wish I remembered her name because she deserves to be praised.  This particular visit was AWFUL. We waited over 10 minutes to be acknowledged and given a table. Needless to say, we gave up waiting and sat at the bar top for some drinks and appetizers. We realized it was nearing closing time so we planned on ordering our food to go while having a beer or 2 while waiting for our food.  (Trying to make it easier on them). The bartender grabs menus and we told her we already knew what food we wanted to order. We ordered our food and never saw her again. I mind you, WE WERE AT HER BAR TOP. She never offered us ANY drinks or EVEN water, at all. And when we called her over to order a beer, she completely ignored us. She was literally 2ft away from us behind the bar and still no reaction.  Fed up at this point, we look at the check and see that she charged us full price for our happy hour appetizers. I wanted to clarify with her if the reasoning was because we ordered our food to go, (which is understandable) but she wasnt available to speak to about it. We decided to cut out losses, pay the bil, and get the heck out of there.  I've spent many years in the service industry so I can be very sympathetic with servers and bartenders. But this was a case of complete disregard of our needs and overall disrespect and carelessness to us as customers. It's extremely hard and very rare for me to leave a tip less that 20%, but the occasion called for it. The food was consistently good (as always) and this has been my only bad experience so I may return and sit with an actual server."
Nasseem A.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,9,1,5.0,3/6/2017,"The food was OK I had the baby back ribs and they were a bit tough. My wife had the steak salad which was awesone..  We had the chicken wonton tacos which my wife almost bit my finger off when I tried to take one... they were that good..do fresh and flavorful... The best part was our server, Jonathan, he was quite possibly one of the best servers I have ever met.. he was attentive, efficient, and fast. He made great recommendations and knew the menu really well.  He has the kitchen dialed in, which was great because our food came out so quick..  Ask for Jonathan when you go. You will be very happy.."
Gieneve S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,1,4.0,12/3/2016,"I love this resto.. But they don't have toothpick so instead of ordering deserts after my butcher sirloin,..my husband and I just decided to leave so we can toothpick..."
Justin L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,1,2.0,9/22/2017,"Come to Applebee's where you get a free trip to hurricane harbor with your dinner. Waiter came by to fill my water, and in the process of doing so, spilled a decent amount on the table. Completely fine I totally understand that happens. But instead of wiping it up or even having the decency of apologizing he shrugs it off, and when I ask for a rag he rolls his eyes at me. At least the food was pretty good."
Denese V.,"West Hills, CA",15,70,203,3.0,7/30/2017,"If you are ordering online for pick-up, check your order and expect a 10 minute wait for your food even if you ordered well in advance. I've ordered 4 times now and there is either an item missing or I have to wait (which basically defeated the purpose of preordering). I go there on my lunch break which is why I've neglected to check the order before leaving. I typically wouldn't complain about the wait but when you're on lunch break, 10 minutes is a lot- hence, the PREORDER! As for the service, the staff is nice, but nothing to write home about. The food is good, but not worth the disappointment. Most recently, they couldn't find the order I placed 2 hours earlier, but the bartender found it immediately when he looked at the POS system (read my order aloud to me, still left out an item), so I'm not sure what happened there. I don't plan to go back anytime soon as there are a grip of restaurants in that center that are cheaper, taste better, have your food ready when you get there- all without messing up the order."
Victoria A.,"Canoga Park, CA",2,22,8,1.0,8/23/2017,Happy hour would be the only reason to come here the food is not good the pasta had no sauce while the chicken lime was drenched in sauce I don't think I'll be coming back
J K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,57,66,4.0,7/29/2016,"I've been here a few times before going to the movies. For me it's a perfect place to have a decent dinner and a few drinks before going to a movie. I have never had a bad experience sometimes you have to wait but the service is always great and you know what your going to get with Applebee's. The only thing is I wish they had better beer on draft! Sometimes we debate coming here because the draft beer choices. But they do have variety in the bottles and mixed drinks. Other than that the food is always good, the servers have always been nice. Please bring more beer on draft ! :)"
Melissa A.,"La Quinta, CA",56,140,79,4.0,1/5/2017,"Stopped in at Applebees because the food is consistently good. Henry was our waiter at the bar. He was a really good guy. He made sure we liked all our food and made sure we had everything we needed. I ordered the Caesar salad with French onion soup and it was deliciousMy son ordered the Caesar salad and steak quesidillla and his meal was very tasty, as well. Restaurant looked very clean and well taken care of. Applebee's will never be five stars but it's definitely a go to restaurant where you can get a quick meal that doesn't cost too much and is consistently good."
Lynne A.,"Tarzana, CA",771,841,896,3.0,4/30/2016,Came today to celebrate an 80th birthday for a couple of hours. Morgan was our waitress she was awesome! There were about 17 of us and she was great! Good sense of humor and constantly checking on us. I didn't eat anything but most of the food looked pretty decent. They were pretty busy today. The party seemed happy and everyone left with a smile. The bathrooms were filthy and no toilet paper at all on one of the stalls. Morgan gets 5 stars for sure!!!!
Rafael B.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,13,,2.0,5/8/2017,This place is eh! This last visit was one for the books... everything was hunky-dory until my food came and sat at the table with me just staring at it with no utensils to eat with. My wife had to get up and take them from a table that was unoccupied. As I was eating my food I ran out of water and had to Wait for the waiter that was nowhere to be found in a  basically  empty restaurant. I finally received  my water as we were paying our bill...
Jennie L.,"North Hollywood, CA",119,214,324,1.0,10/15/2017,"This place is the worse place to come to when  at night or they have a promotion going on . I came in with my husband for a date night . We didn't have alot of time in are hands because we had a babysitter only for four hours . So when we came in we checked in , it took 15 minutes for us to get a table . Then we where setting and talking for a while then we got bored of waiting so we order are 1 margarita drinks through the mobile device on the table . Then 10 minutes after are waiter comes and ask if we are ready to order we said we just place the drinks but we would order appetizers . So she place that in for us . In the mean time she brought us water . When are food came out , they brought my husband beer and and my drink the margarita .  The manager pass by and ask how is everything , we said we are still waiting on are drink . So 20 minutes later a different person brings out my drink . Then we placed other order of appetizers with the waiter and order two more margarita . I ask with a different favor and she said they only have lime . So when I ordered it before on the mobile device it charged all the drinks with add favor . So then are food came out 30 minutes later with no drinks again . So then the waiter went in to check on them . We saw all the other tables get the same drink with four to five orders of it . Then after complain in so much to are waiter she brought it out . Then we just ask for the check but this was the worst experience ever and bad service ever . We spend three hours here . When are plan was have dinner and a movie for are date night . I won't be coming back here ever ."
Diana N.,"Canoga Park, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/6/2017,"Service was a little slow but they were understaffed and it was fine we didn't mind. But then when another table left without paying they tried to add that tab on to our tab; onto our bill. Then when we corrected them, they started smirking. That is not cool! We are not coming back. fuck this place. watch out on your $1 margarita bills."
Kelly P.,"Studio City, CA",32,19,1,5.0,7/17/2017,Amazing service bar tender was able to accommodate to exactly what I wanted! Yummy yummy!!! Go Applebee's!!!
Robert W.,"Los Angeles, CA",169,8,,5.0,6/3/2017,Love this place good service good food good drinks and great ambiance and all for a great deal what's not to love! I can't wait to go back
Elisa K.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",1,27,4,5.0,6/12/2017,"I had the best lunch here! The chef was awesome! I had the grilled shrimp combo with 6oz steak,  broccoli and red potato with side of honey bbq .  It was so delicious.   The sirloin was so juicy without the high cost of a steak house.  I started with the nicest side salad with diced cucumber, croutons and bacon. It was so big and fresh! Adriana was such a great server! She was attentive and right on top of everything.   She made the experience really special.  Oh, the iced tea was so refreshing. They let me combine flavors so I had peach and raspberry and it was yummy!! I even had a table visit from the manager Maritza. What a great experience. It was my first time here.  It was so good I'm buying the $50 gift card and you get a bonus of $10. So worth it!!"
