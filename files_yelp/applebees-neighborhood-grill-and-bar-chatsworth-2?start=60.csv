Alexandra D.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,41,39,3.0,6/24/2017,"They really improved their menu the appetizers are good and the main entrees have really improved since last time I can about a year ago. The service here is pretty slow, it would be understandable if it was really busy but it's actually a calm Saturday evening for the service to be so slow. If you have patience you'd like this place."
Suzanne T.,"Woodland Hills, CA",183,9,13,1.0,10/14/2017,"NO EXCUSE!!!  There's NO excuse why there should be about 10 empty tables at dinner time on a Saturday night with so many people waiting.  People were strewn on the lawn in front, filling every bench in front of the restaurant, and every space at the entrance.  Dozens of people on their waiting list to be seated.  The hostess tells us that it's about a 30 minute wait, however a waiter that saw our disappointment gave us a more realistic wait time of about 45 minutes.  Still people who were ahead of us and waiting outside, were heard complaining that they had been given a wait time of 15-20 minutes at check in, and had already been waiting almost 45 minutes.  I finally went and asked the hostess why there were so many empty tables with so many people waiting to be seated.  She explained that ""the kitchen was backed up with orders"".  SERIOUSLY... there's NO EXCUSE for this on a busy Saturday night."
Liz G.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",0,46,28,2.0,7/24/2017,Went there after the TV commercial we saw. Hamburger was ok but too small with a poor portion of french fries. What made me angry is that they offer free french fries refill but it took them like 15 min to bring it (as well as the refills).!!  My caesar salad was very good but all the rest made this experience very average.  There are waitresses all over the place but the service was still verrry slow.  Disappointment. My spouse and I agreed not to visit this place again.
Cee Los T.,"Los Angeles, CA",541,31,28,5.0,4/6/2016,"Very good food very service highly recommended. .I've been here at least 5times haha.... every time it's chill..great vibes,clean place... good food...nice tvs lol Will come back for more trouble!"
Rachel M.,"Canyon Country, CA",15,25,8,3.0,10/15/2016,Just alright. Our server isn't very outgoing for her tip.. My food isn't very presentable for what I'm paying.
Sarah Y.,"Canoga Park, CA",77,117,3,3.0,10/20/2016,"I'm anxious to see how the service and food is. There website for ordering in advance is VERY frustrating. We start work at 5AM, so our lunch time is usually around 11:00 or so. The website says that the restaurant car side to go hours are from 11AM -9pm . So, I figured if I order a couple of hours ahead, the order should be ready to pick up  by 11:15  latest.  After I got everyone's order from the office picked, I went to the payment page and that's where my frustration began.  I found that the 11:15 AM was not an acceptable time when I went to submit the order; hence, all of the credit card information I put in was cleared. So, I used 11:30AM and pressed ""place order"" again. This time, an error came up saying that the credit card number was invalid. So, I fixed the number and hit ""place order"" again. Again, all the credit information was cleared and I had to re-type my credit card information again.  Whoo hoo, it finally went through. I hope they really get my order. I will call to confirm. After reading some of the Yelper's comments about bad customer service, I am a little worried. I will update! Ok, so the ONLY reason I am bumping this up to a 3 is because Fernando was sooooooooo helpful, empathetic to my ordeal with the website; plus we had a coupon, so the bill was very reasonable. Do not order the Chicken Cavatappi, unless you have at least salt and pepper. It is REALLY bland.  They need to maybe put some sun dried tomatoes, a little more basil and some parsley, a little seasoning salt and pepper. If the Sun dried tomatoes are too expensive then maybe some dill or rosemary? The house salad is actually pretty good. It has a lot of different kinds of stuff in it. I had my wn dressing at work, so I can't rate any of their dressing. But one order had the oriental chicken salad and the person swears the dressing is the best they have had. The 1/2 club sandwich that came with one of the grilled lunches was just OK.  The Two mini hamburgers with fries and a soda was ok.    If I have another coupon available, maybe I'l order something else on the menu. Otherwise, I wasn't too impressed."
Amit B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,20,,1.0,4/8/2017,"Spinach and artichoke was horrible, artichoke was full of cheese and tasted bad. Chicken wings was like rock and taste horrible. There are no IPA beers on tap, so beer selection is limited. Food isn't worth for the price. I'd never go here again and would not recommend it."
S. Alicia S.,"Burbank, CA",2046,670,3300,5.0,8/20/2016,"Applebee's added some new items to the menu. All great choices. My Bourbon St Chicken & Shrimp order was nicely served. It was lightly spiced and grilled. Enjoyable meal. I ate half and took half..... However, there was room for dessert. So, I ordered the bartender's suggested Triple Chocolate Meltdown. Complete deliciousness."
Anthony S.,"Simi Valley, CA",1105,486,2122,2.0,3/14/2015,"Well I guess its been awhile since my last visit,about 7 months ago.Well I was greeted right away and they even opened the door for me.I think this is there new introduction now.The Hostess continued to this. Once seated their server came over an introduced her self and began to take her my order. When my order came out,my pasta was room temperature,so I immediately asked for my server to come over and I told her my dish was room temperature.I mean really cold pasta.So she took my dish and they put my dish in a microwave and brought it back to me,instead  of making a new one.Unreal."
Manny Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,9,,5.0,10/1/2016,"The food was good and the service was great, the make you feel like your important the whole time your there till your ready to leave.   good job people at Applebee's"
Bobby F.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,24,1,1.0,7/24/2016,I am currently sitting in the booth.... I had to wait 20 mins to be seated when there was so many open seats...then my friend and I get seated and wait another 20 for our food...the people behind us were sat 10 mins after us and got their appetizers before us which was the same thing!!! Makes things worst...we both asked for well done steaks...very pink steaks... So they took $10 off...so we both paid $8 for mashed potatoes....WTF.... The service here is terrible......TERRIBLE TIME TO COME DURING YOUR LUNCH BREAK!!!!!
Natalie I.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,4,1,1.0,3/4/2017,So this place had the worst service ever. They had the slowest impolite service. I came on a Friday at 12 and no one wanted to help serve us except the bartender.
Jimmy M.,"North Hollywood, CA",2,7,,1.0,10/1/2017,"Wow! The worse service ever! I don't like doing bad reviews but this was horrible service. We got there and actually seated pretty fast so It started well. Exactly 17 minutes later I asked a busboy if they knew who our waitress/waiter was. She said ""I'll go get her now"" 5 min later she comes by and we had everything ready. What kind of drinks, appetizers, main dishes. She took our order and left. 10 min later she comes back with 3 of the 4 drinks and says she's still waiting on one more. Our appetizers show up but no 4th drink? We ask and she said ""it's coming out now"". She brings last drink and we wait for our food. 25 min later food arrives and it's somewhat cold, I didn't feel like saying anything because I have had it already. We finish eating and as I'm waiting to pay my waitress is nowhere to be found. I try paying on the tablet and it says ""$0 balance"" so I couldn't pay there. 15 min later I walk up to host and ask if I could pay there and they said they would get my waitress. I wait about 5 min and she walks by me and I think"" great I can pay and leave"" she then says ""thanks have a great day"" All I'm thinking is ""I haven't paid!!!"" I tell the host what happened and she says we will bring tab out. I go and sit in the waiting area and she finally comes back with tablet and says ""sorry the tab was put on the wrong table"" hands me the tablet and walks away. I filled out the survey letting management know my experience. This is my first time here, but will definitely be my LAST!"
Christian E.,"Canyon Country, CA",118,25,2,5.0,3/19/2017,"Went to dinner with my family yesterday and everything was just great! Our server Toni was so sweet and attentive to us, we couldn't have asked for anything better. Would definitely recommend this place. Been a long time since I ate an Applebees, good then, still good now. Thanks again to Toni for your service!"
Connie B.,"Cerritos, CA",25,40,27,1.0,1/20/2017,"I usually go to the Alhambra restaurant but decided to try this one out, I regret it.  The server forgot half of our order and then when we spoke to the manager about it Management didn't understand the issue that we were missing food.  To top it all off the server came by and was confrontational I had to ask him to let me speak to the manager.  Run while you can...."
M H.,"Downtown, Glendale, CA",0,14,7,5.0,9/18/2017,Came in 4 a late nite dinner 4 dinner. The very pleasant jonathan greeted us at the table and very attentive at all times.
stephanie c.,"Panorama City, CA",3,28,3,2.0,7/13/2016,"Came here on a late evening. We were immediately notified that the fryers weren't working which is fine. But some of our dishes required fryers for smaller items like tortilla strips so some substations were offered but not for all the dishes. This was the beginning of the inconstancy.  Our waitress was nice but her performance became dull. We ordered two drinks from the bar (we were seated at a booth next to the bar). Took about 20 mins to get our drinks because the waitress  said the bartender was busy with another guest. (Which we could see was clearly not the issue as the bartender was singing and dancing around her station). I saw when she made both cocktails it probably took less that 5 minutes to make both. I had an Adios MF which was so weak and diluted because about 20% of the drink was ice (I could barely move my straw).  Order came out wrong after taking forever to serve, even though it was only us and a few other tables as well as majority of the food we ordered didn't required fryers and they weren't making substitutes for the little part of the dish that did need it. Also, apparently you can't order roasted potatoes when the fryers are down? (They are supposed to be ""roasted"") Don't understand why they took a lifetime. We didn't complain but we didn't appreciate that our waitress didn't take any responsibility that we annoyed how long everything took and that one top that it was lackluster. Probably won't come back."
Kevin P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",11,221,76,2.0,12/9/2016,"As far as Applebee's go this place is a big let down, the food is always off the quality that it should be. Customer service is not great because they appear to be understaffed as the hostess was also our server who was also the bartender on a Friday night. Will never come back to this Applebee's."
Regina O.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1409,673,1940,2.0,9/21/2014,"We came a a little over an hour before closing for late night happy hour and received very poor service.  Our server never came to get drink orders... instead someone walking by got them for us.  How did we know that he wasn't our server?  He told us that he wasnt our server but he'd go ahead and start us off and that our server would be with us shortly.  Our supposed server hardly ever came to check up on us and we just sat around waiting for our check for the longest time.   Good thing we were able to order appetizers off the ipad because that would've taken forever as well.  Food came out promptly.  We ordered mozzarella cheesesticks and chips with spinach/artichoke dip.  The cheesesticks were warm and very cheesy....however it lacked presentation.  It came out all line up with a huge empty space in the middle of the plate.  The spinach/artichoke dip looked... very unappetizing.  The top looked like it was sitting out for awhile and that they just simply reheated it up.  We had to mix it together for it to look a little bit better. If you're here for happy hour drinks, I recommend the White Peach Sangria!  It comes in a giant cup!  Probably the best drink on the happy hour menu.  (:  They have good nachos too!"
Elba G.,"Reseda, Los Angeles, CA",62,11,2,5.0,5/10/2016,"This review is for Sarah the manager, came in this evening with my mom and we must have waited about 15-20 mins tops before anyone came to ask us if we had been helped already, mind you it was not too busy at the time we were there. I wouldn't have gotten so upset about waiting but a family of 4 got seated next to us 10 mins after us and got their food orders in about 5 mins after being seated. (While mom and I were still sitting there with no one coming to us) After helping the other family the waitress came to us asking if we had been helped?! Umm no! I assume she noticed we were a bit bothered at the fact 15 mins had passed by and no one had come get our order so she apologized.......Sarah then came to apologize and got on top of the situation and made sure we were helped right away, cannot thank her more for what she did. She was very professional and kind about the whole situation.  I am a manager myself and know how important customer satisfaction is. She made sure my mother and I left very happy and satisfied.! Thank you so much Sarah!!! My family and I will def keep coming here, it's our go to spot!"
