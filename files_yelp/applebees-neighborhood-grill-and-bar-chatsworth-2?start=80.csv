Breenauhh C.,"Jacksonville, FL",256,7,1,1.0,6/18/2017,"Joe is the most unprofessional, inhospitable general manager I have ever encountered in my entire life at any establishment!! Rude! Disrespectful! And distasteful! I have been frequented Applebee's all over the country for many years and have had amazing experiences, but unfortunately Joe has left an awful taste in my mouth beyond the point of no return. I have never been treated so unfairly in my life. I don't know if he is racist or just a grumpy Gus. Nonetheless I pray that he changes his evil ways, before he turns away more loyal customers. Ask for other manager, so your experience will not be ruined as mine was!"
Josh Z.,"San Jose, CA",30,122,16,2.0,10/28/2016,The service was terrible. I overheard the assistant manager bad mouthing the general manager to an applicant. Service was slow. Took 10 minutes for ketchup and ranch to come to my table after the food arrived. By that point I finished most of my meal. Sad thing was the restaurant was dead.
Danielle G.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,11,1,5.0,12/16/2016,So the manager came over with a dessert & asked if it was ours & we said no because it didn't have a candle & it was my friends bday. When she left (Sarah) she rolled her eyes & walked away. When I ask my waitress if she was a manager because she was dressed casual she said yes & I was so surprised because she was rude!!  Im still in shocked because managers are supposed to be the friendliest ones. They need to promote Morgan & Toni!! Those two are the definition of a manager! But I'm giving 5 stars because Morgan & Toni deserve it!!
Yasmeen G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,2,5.0,6/18/2017,"Food is good , service was even better our server(Jonathan) with the braces was great ! Oh and also they let my service dog in no questions asked."
William V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,1,5.0,11/24/2016,"The food is delicious and service is good, I've enjoyed the atmosphere and meals. Very convenient to pay and place an order, so I'll be back to the restaurant for sure!"
Miss April D.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,11,1,1.0,4/4/2016,"My family and I went to AppleBees a couple of weeks ago (sorry for the late review), and I have to say this was my FIRST time eating there...and my last. The only reason I went was because I had a $50 gift card from Christmas. Now who can say no to that? Well, I prob sky should have.  When we initially walked in, it was nothing how I expected. To give you an idea - bright, busy...I guess like the commercials- haha. Instead it was dark and dingy. We were placed at our table immediately. No silverware, or napkins were placed. We received that after asking (when our food arrived). The waitress was nice but inattentive. I think everyone else waited on us except her. There were many people standing around, including the 4 managers on the floor??? Go figure. Any way, the food wasn't the best. My kids had cheese burgers, I had ribs and the husband had enchiladas (don't ever try Latin food there). Overall it was clean, restrooms were clean.  It just needs Jon Taffer's ""Bar Rescue"" touch and it will be good to go!"
Cassandra Y.,"Burbank, CA",5000,1338,8950,3.0,4/21/2014,"The Service: Our server, Katherine, is awesome! Great sense of humor and super friendly. She is very personal and make us feeling very welcomed. She is very attentive. She checks on us all the time.  The Food: Food is served quickly.  2 for $20 deal Cesar Salad & House Garden Salad are both good portion for starters.  Chicken & Shrimp Tequila Tango - Chicken is tender but rice taste hard.... either under-cooked or not fresh.  Chocolate Mousse Dessert Shooter - It is okay size for $2.5. Oreo cookies as base then top with chocolate  mousse and light whipped cream. Individual size... definitely not for sharing.  The Parking: Private Lot (FREE)"
Nadia S.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,22,35,4.0,7/25/2016,"Butcher meat and potatoes was really yummy, could have been a little bigger maybe. Lots of menu choices. Liked the Sauza blue margarita as well, refreshing, nice price."
Joe S.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,5,1,2.0,9/2/2016,"Went in for a quick beer at lunch today, 15 minutes ago. Sat at the bar the bartender was cutting lemons. 2 minutes later still cutting lemons. I made eye contact with the manager several times. He finally walks over to lemon boy and I figure I'll be waited on. No, they take out money and start counting tips or something like that.  I guess they are making so much they don't need my money, I walked out. I never reward incompetence."
Jennifer L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,2,5.0,10/13/2016,One of the best restaurants to go to. delicious food awesome atmosphere great waiters and waitresses. They never disappoint! They have great lunch deals but my favorite is the dinner deals they have. Not bad for just casual dining!
Artin R.,"Glendale, CA",15,54,162,3.0,4/6/2016,"Not impressed at all. I walked in and the hostess slash waitress ignored us and walked away. We got margaritas for the table, they were horrible. All you taste is bitterness sweeter. I got a side salad with bunch of the ends of lettuce. My entree finally came, WRONG! OMG looks nothing like the picture. I got the sirloin and parmesan shrimp... wow.. lol... I will show you how it looks on the menu and my plate you be the judge."
Matt K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,1,1.0,3/11/2017,"Had THE WORST experience and service at a restaurant ever. My son and I were there last night for dinner for bonding time. From the moment we were seated, we were completely and willfully ignored by the wait staff. When I flagged one down, she said she would be right back then avoided coming by our table. I pressed the ""CALL SEVER"" button, which flashed for 30 minutes, that went ignored. I had to order our food using the electronic kiosk at the table myself because no one would come by to take our order. Our empty drink glasses sat there for 20 minutes but no one came by to get offer to refill them. It was fairly busy but there was enough wait staff to serve all the patrons. When I finally flagged down one waitress, she appeared annoyed and said ""What do you want?"" I just couldn't believe the lousy or lack of service and complete and willful ignorance of a customer. UNBELIEVABLE!!!"
Sheila A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,14,1.0,2/24/2017,my husband and i went to this place but it was an awful terrible service. the waitress and the manager is very i mean very unprofessional. they have a friend that visited thr place and we got there first but they served their friend first and they got thier order first before us. the manager even sat and talked to their friend didnt even ask us if everything is ok if our food is ok. very unprofessional. i ask for second cup of coffee never came waited for like 15 minutes . will never go to this place again ever.
Joe M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/27/2016,2nd badd experience in a row??.no utensils to begin with..ordered an appetizer..never delivered..and when I asked my server MCKENZIE  what the deal was his reply was for me to calm down???? many other complaints this nite from other patroms...we will never return...and you should train your employees to be more considerate towards customers..he also passed the responsibility of my complaints on to other employees..your our server and you should make sure we are taking care of...
Antonio H.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,17,1,3.0,11/17/2016,"This is a late post, last night I came with my family of 3. We were seated quickly. I am overall satisfied, I would come back for the service, Henry our server was great, very friendly! I didnt like the wait time on my food, if it wasnt for overdue conversation and gossip with my girl we would have realized that they were taking forever! The food was mediocre. The drinks were good but small. (Glasses that is). I felt like I payed more than the quality of my food. My experience was 50/50."
Debbie M.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,11,,5.0,9/14/2016,I want to take out the time to thank JOSEPH and his wonderful staff for helping us raise $1200.00 at a fundraiser breakfast buffet!  The food was great and everyone had such a good time!  Nobel middle school drama dept.. sends their appreciation for helping us achieve our fundraiser goals!  Joseph you are humble and a nice guy and I wish there were more restaurants willing to do a fundraiser in our community with the generosity that your Resturant gives!  We will be back soon!
Connie C.,"Canoga Park, CA",293,269,972,2.0,1/4/2016,"Yes, it's Applebee's what should I expect? I always seem to come back because the happy hour is pretty good but some of the servers are a hit or a miss.   This last visit on NYE, the restaurant wasn't extremely busy and I also wasn't greeted immediately by our server.  No worries, they have an automatic ordering system which I used but the the waiter seemed dumbfounded that I used their system & just stared with a blank look making it very awkward.  Also, I asked him to cancel something we ordered, he confirmed but it was still brought out anyway to which we still had to pay for.  I told him we didn't want the larger appetizer since we ordered the sample-tizer version instead yet...nothing happened, just anther blank stare.  If I come back, I think I'll go straight to the bar area where the staff is more competent and won't stare at you long enough where you want to ask ""wtf""."
Jerry L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,6,,2.0,1/19/2016,"My wife and I went to Applebees in Chatsworth for her birthday - per her request.   At the end of our meal, we ordered, as we have for years, one Blondie Desert with two spoons.  Yes, even at Applebees, we like to keep the romance alive.   I should mention that for dinner I ordered a Shrimp and Spinach Salad.  I know it sounds terrible, but In all the years I have eaten at Applebees, my order has never changed.  Even when Applebees took said salad off the menu, the chefs would still make it for me - talk about feeling special.   UNFORTUNATELY,  our most recent dining experience on January 10th, 2016 was not so special.   Three times we asked our waitress for glasses of water.  We never received them - not before, during, nor after our meal.    The Spinach and Shrimp Salad I ordered was about two-thirds (66%) it's normal size, AND the shrimp were lukewarm with a soft, (mushy), under-cooked texture,  Lastly, the extra cup of dressing I requested never arrived.  Of course with such a small salad, I wound up not needing more dressing. Our waitress was great, as always, but she was juggling a lot of customers.  My suggestions would be as follows:   1. Fire whoever/whomever has decided to cut salad portions.   2.  Schedule more staff on busy nights.   Again, our waitress had an excellent personality, and worked her tail off, but she was being pulled in so many directions, we didn't receive our usual great service - we don't blame her.  Perhaps my skimpy salad, with less-than-quality shrimp, was due to the kitchen being understaffed as well... Hello management.  Speaking of management - where was management?  Aren't they usually visiting tables and asking if the customers are enjoying their meal?  There was no management presence at all...  We haven't given up on Applebees, but next time we will call first to see how busy they are."
Cheryl S.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",2,7,1,5.0,8/23/2016,"I almost don't want to write this because I don't want this place to be crowded now, but I have to say I tested what other people wrote on here by not saying one word to any waitress or waiter that walked by us, and we were waiting on within four minutes. The waitress was very delightful, and the food was absolutely delicious! We did the two for 25 and had the shrimp and chicken grill with onions mushrooms and potatoes. This is going to be one of our go to restaurants"
Jim O.,"Palmdale, CA",17,25,35,5.0,8/19/2016,"Good food, great service and good value. I come here often and they change up the menus which is a good thing. Not too loud and a good atmosphere."
