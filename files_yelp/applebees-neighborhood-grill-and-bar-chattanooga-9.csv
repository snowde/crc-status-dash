Joan G.,"Saint Louis, MO",182,333,1457,3.0,7/25/2016,"This Applebee's is within walking distance of our motel when we are traveling through to South Carolina. It's a chain restaurant so enough said. If you've been to one, you've been to them all. As usual we sat at the bar.   We split the cheeseburger spring rolls with their signature sauce.  Nice and meaty and cheesy on the inside. They were very good and large enough to be a meal for someone.  Dinner consisted of sirloin steaks for each of us. His was a special that came with gravy, potatoes and tomatoes. He specified no tomatoes but apparently you could not get a substitute so his plate came out looking a little sparse. I got the regular sirloin with garlic green beans and garlic (you never know where vampires are) fries.  The steak was good as were the fries but I absolutely loved the green beans. Enough garlic on them to taste it and they were cooked the way I like them. For dessert we had some type of chocolate cake with ice cream that was quite tasty.  Would I come back here?  Whenever we are stopping in Chattanooga, I will."
Matthew S.,"Chattanooga, TN",24,67,261,2.0,10/30/2017,"This restaurant wants to be Chili's, and that ainT saying much. The dated contemporary atmosphere is bleh. The food seems to be thrown together for speed not quality. Coupons are rarely accepted so ask first. The staff look like they are receiving punishment instead of leadership. I gave it a two because management accommodates me whenbad experiences happen"
Jeanelle G.,"Arlington, TX",8,8,14,1.0,11/27/2016,"I can not comment on the food because I never got the chance to eat it. While I was waiting I saw one small roach run across my dinning table.  As soon as I decided to get up, my plate was served to me. I reviewed the plate and it had finger prints all on the rim of my plate. Only one that it was appetizing to was the second roach that ran across the table.  So in a nutshell, this place is filthy and not fit to serve.  On a positive note the waitress was very pleasant, kind, and understanding. I hate that I did not get her name. Maybe if I was not run out by roaches, I could have had time to get to know her."
Tracy P.,"Thomasville, GA",45,77,39,5.0,8/13/2016,We had the Thai shrimp salad and the BBQ flavored club sandwich. Both were very good. The service was good as well. It's been a very long time since I ate at an Applebee's.   The menu has really changed.  We walked over from the Hilton Garden Inn.
Kori P.,"South Bend, IN",151,9,1,1.0,2/24/2017,"This was by far the worst experience we have ever had at a restaurant and we have had a lot of bad experiences. The service was horrible for how slow they were. We sat in the bar waiting to get acknowledged for about 20 minutes. We decided to go sit at the bar ledge hoping to get served. Service at the bar was great, so thanks to her I wanted to rate 2 instead 1. Our orders were in for about 25 minutes before someone from the kitchen came out to say that they had to thaw a sauce for one of the meals we chose and it would take 25 more minutes. No thanks!! It is one of their most popular meals too so I don't know how that happens. My fiance's meal came out with 3 strips of grilled chicken (supposed to be crispy). It was more than terrible and there were tables all over this one servers area that were upset with getting no service. She spent more time at the computers than at any table. I know the manager got tons of bad complaints tonight due to this horrible service! I'd go elsewhere if you're looking for a dinner option!"
Nick C.,"Columbia, SC",67,79,29,3.0,2/11/2016,"Honestly I hate chain restaurants but this was the closest place to eat and I must say the service was excellent. I ordered a beer and a Togo steak and was in and out pretty quick and Russell the bartender was extremely nice. They do the best they can. The food quality is awful. If you are going to charge 16 bucks for a sirloin please make it a little more tasty. The meat was not tender and it shows that Applebee's is all about Nickel and diming you. If they up the good quality I would be happy to pay more and I would frequent more often. All the other chains have it figured out, but you guys are lacking."
Kirsten J.,"Wahiawā, HI",0,6,,1.0,4/5/2017,We went yesterday and didn't feel welcome at all. No smile from the host - she actually looked at us with a disgusted look on her face. Our server couldn't smile at us either. Food was okay. Portions very small for  adult men though. We will not go back to that location. We work hard for our money so spending it should be a good experience - which this wasn't.
David B.,"Maryville, TN",38,222,7,4.0,12/31/2015,"Pretty good. Waitress was really nice and courteous. Kept our drinks filled, plus some. Food was all cooked to perfection. I felt the price was a little high for what we purchased but it was still good food."
Jesse T.,"Columbia, TN",1,5,,3.0,5/22/2016,This is probably one of the worst Applebee's in the Chattanooga area. Service was not the best and the waiters hardly came to refill a drink. The worst part was I walked into the men's room and there was a spider just sitting there looking at me while I am using the restroom.
Brandon H.,"Atlanta, GA",3,29,,1.0,4/4/2016,"I need to stop visiting chain restaurants because they have become as awful as fast food. Arrived at around 8:45. Was seated quickly but waited almost 10 minutes before anyone came over to ask what we would like for our drink order. Waitress was nice but it was obvious she wanted to get off. Ordered a combo appetizer which was cheeseburger egg rolls (disgusting), spinach dip (was only half full, also disgusting, with chips that were obviously old), and boneless wings (which were cold and also disgusting). Had to ask the waitress for sour cream and blue cheese dressing (which we had requested initially). She came over and plopped them down on our table with a disdainful look on her face. The presentation of the dishes was embarrassing. The wings were plopped in the plate and sauce was all over the plate. Terrible service, terrible food, and a awful experience. Unquestionably, the worst Apple-bees I've ever been to.  I would have given it no stars but that's not an option. Honestly, I've been to several chain eateries recently and they are flat out just as bad as fast food at this point."
Anne S.,"Chattanooga, TN",1,3,,1.0,1/16/2017,"I have been to many Applebee's around the country and I usually enjoy eating at them. This particular one, however, was unsatisfactory. As someone who works in the customer service industry (often times in food service), I was appalled. When we first pulled up, we thought maybe they were closed since the outside lights were not on but they were indeed open so we went inside. After we were seated, it took a long time for someone to come over for our drink orders. They were not very busy but seemed short staffed and the staff that was there moved like snails. Our server was so quiet, I could barely understand him. We got our waters after a few minutes and decided to play a game on the game-player they have at all the tables. It charges .99 for unlimited use. We played about 10 mins and then it wouldn't allow us to play anymore. At this point, we had finished our waters and were hoping for a refill. We pressed a button on the game-player to get our server's attention, which he finally came over about 10mins after that. We still did not have our appetizers and he said ""no one brought your food yet?"" To which we told him no and that the game-player wasn't working. He told us we could try again and he wouldn't charge us twice but we didn't feel like playing anymore and were just hungry waiting for our food. We finally got out mozzarella sticks and ate them but he had still not refilled our waters. We waited a while longer and when 2 other tables got their plates (they had both arrived after us) we got fed up and sought out the manager. The bartender had to go retrieve her since we hadn't seen our server in a while. My husband explained that we had been waiting an hour and hadn't gotten our food yet and we wanted to leave. The manager sighed and said she guessed she could fix it. She didn't apologize or offer any explanation for the poor service. We got charged $8 for the mozzarella sticks, which we felt was a bit much but we paid and left as our food was coming out. It really didn't even look that appetizing and I'm glad we left. We ended up going to a Steak n Shake and got our food quickly and had a great time there instead."
Kevin S.,"Simi Valley, CA",1,4,,1.0,2/17/2016,Walked out! Sat down at bar for dinner and drinks. Others were there but no bartender. A dozen or more waitstaff walked by without saying anything. No manager came by. Left after 5 minutes of being ignored and took my money elsewhere. Terrible service means I'll never go back. Go elsewhere unless you like being ignored.
Desiree J.,"Knoxville, TN",0,1,,2.0,2/8/2015,"My husband, daughter and I walked in about 7:30 on a Saturday night. We were pleasantly surprised when the sweet looking lady at the hostess station said it would just be a minute to seat us.  We sat down and watched as within three minutes of talking to us, she sat a couple that walked in the door immediately. As she came back, she looked surprised to see us and immediately sat us at a table.  After a few minutes with the menu, we inquired if we could get chicken on a Cesar salad and the waitress said, ""Sure,"" and walked off.  At first we thought that was just a little odd, but after she'd been gone ten minutes, we realized that she went and putl in an order FOR ONE CESAR SALAD. I don't know if she thought we were going to share, but we had to flag down another waitress to take the rest of our order. Of course the salad arrived ten minutes before the other food. This place needs to train their staff more carefully."
Walter D.,"Grafton, OH",0,29,11,4.0,3/13/2015,Not bad food reasonable price .ask for server named Laith!!!! We stayed in motel across from it was easy walk to the restaurant. Great burger and fries . We liked the boneless wings appetizer .
Nikki D.,"Union City, GA",0,12,,1.0,5/9/2015,"Horrible. In town for a college graduation and decided to eat here for dinner. After waiting in a establishment with little to no patrons, we were POINTED to our table by the host. But to make matters worst, other guests were seated by this same person. After making a complaint, we never brought menus for the children and drink orders took about 20 minutes to be brought. The manager was notified and never came over to at least apologize. We ended up leaving. Will NEVER attend this Applebee's again. Downright horrible customer service. HORRIBLE."
Kris G.,"Lexington, KY",4,24,,1.0,11/27/2014,"Stopped at this exit on thanksgiving weekend enroute to Florida and were staying at a nearby hotel. Horrible service, had to get up twice to find my own napkins and silverware.  My husband ordered a salad with chicken on it and I ordered a sandwich.  40 minutes later it finally arrived.  His chicken was cold, my sandwich was overdone. Unfriendly service. Places like this should be consistent from one to the next. This was perfectly awful."
Ashley S.,"Shelby, MS",59,46,12,1.0,11/22/2011,"Not even worth a star. Was expecting a family restaurant, but so grateful our children missed this trip. Atmosphere trumped everything on this visit. It was too loud between the blaring music, singing staff and the drunks screaming, ""OMG YOU CAME IN YOUR PANTS!!!"" This looked to be a fun bar to hang out at, but that's really all. Food was poor, with the exception of the salad. Service was average, friendly, but most were overly so and kinda made me wonder if they were high on life or something else. We won't be back."
Jacob S.,"Scotts Hill, TN",32,2,1,2.0,12/21/2014,"The food was the standard Applebee's fare, and I enjoyed it, but the service we experienced was immensely lacking. Upon arrival, the hostess was nowhere to be seen, though they were slow. After a couple minutes, she showed up, said,""hey, how many,"" without a smile, and proceeded to wordlessly show us to our table. After seating, she said ""your server will be right with you,"" and left. Our server didn't make us feel any more welcomed, launching into drink orders after a brief,""hey,"" as well. She wasn't necessarily rude, but she most definitely didn't seem friendly or happy to be there. She gave a check back to the table after we had our food so I have to give credit on that, but after tipping her 20% (a tip that was unearned, but being a server myself I have a soft-spot, and I considered that maybe she had a bad day), she came back to the table and asked if we needed change to which I said,""no, thank you."" She merely said,""okay,"" and then just vanished. No goodbye. No thanks. It was rude enough that I considered finding her and asking for my change, but rather than make a small scene, I cut my losses and decided to just take all future business elsewhere."
Shawn W.,"Ringgold, GA",0,1,,1.0,1/18/2014,"Slow service, unclean bathrooms, and a under remodel.  Not sure we will be back here."
Aj C.,"Chattanooga, TN",0,1,,2.0,12/3/2013,I am normally a fan of Applebee's but I will not be visiting this particular one ever again. Don't get me wrong the food was great. (despite the steak being a bit over cooked)  where they went wrong is with the service. They young waiter seemed to not know exactly where he was and stood at the bar talking about sports. if you wanted a refill don't get your hopes up. Yes I understand there are two sides to every story but when there are 4-5 waiters and 6 tables for them to split it is unacceptable.  After a while the generous manager came and got us refills and later he had to bring us another refill. Seriously if you have to pick up your employes slack twice there is defiantly a problem.
Jim O.,"Newberry, FL",0,2,,5.0,5/19/2014,"The staff were friendly. I had the burbon street steak it came quickly & tasted good, I did have to ask for more potatoes as they only put 6 on the plate, they had no problem giving me more.  I enjoyed it and will go back again."
