Nate M.,"Puyallup, WA",0,3,1,5.0,11/21/2017,"After reading many of the negative reviews I was hesitant to stop here. Not sure what happened to make so many people dislike it so much, because my experience was great.  Stopped in about 9pm on a Tuesday. Place has several guests and several more while we were there. I had the Caesar salad to start and it was quite good. Foe an entree I had the bourbon street chicken and shrimp. Great flavor, juicy chicken, and served hot so I know it didn't sit around in back for a while. Also came with some red potatoes that were seasoned nicely.  Service was great as well. Erika served us and was right on time with an iced tea refill and when it was low again another server noticed and brought one without even asking.  All around a great experience and I will be back!"
helen b.,"Monroe, WA",33,151,925,1.0,7/30/2017,"Let's do the minimal, at least Front of House where no dirty plate is removed or refills made, but the bill comes!... amid a sea of dirty dishes. She ignores the unfilled ice tea glass. No water is brought. No question of refills or water, on a scorching midafternoon. Falesha T. server us , we were billed at 3:37 pm. Also, waited over 7 minutes for our Mimosa to arrive. Unknown when the order was placed but the bartenders was seen gabbing across the bar with another server? in purple shirt.  We got the sense that no one cares. Such lacklustre service... will not be returning!"
Clint W.,"Boise, ID",1,9,3,5.0,1/9/2018,"Ask for Mary as your server , she will change your life! She is a sweet, spunky and a lovely ""well refined"" lady!"
Suzanne C.,"Olympia, WA",12,7,,1.0,10/9/2017,"Went for appetizers and $1 Margaritas yesterday. Afterward We both had severe stomach cramps. After a post I just saw on Facebook about the dollaritas, I'm going to guess it was them. I did like the Spinach Artichhoke dip."
Jorge C.,"Everett, WA",40,12,,5.0,6/14/2017,My first time here and I had a great experience. Our server Mikey was amazing and she did excellent. Food was on time hot and delicious.  We order a couple of drinks and she did great. Excellent service. This place definitely deserves 5
Vivian C. S.,"Onalaska, WA",10,24,,1.0,6/28/2017,"Decided to get a late lunch here with my hubby. Unfortunately they have only gone further downhill. We ordered an appetizer of boneless chicken only to see that they aren't flavored...instead you dip them. That's just lazy Applebees!!! My burger was dry and my waitress was not attentive. The only thing going up here are the prices!!! We pay more to assemble our own food, really?? !!"
Thomas H.,"Empire, CA",138,681,241,2.0,9/11/2016,"Food was edible. Service was so-so, if not marginal.  In a half-full restaurant, my glass (and those of my friends) sat empty more than half an hour until I took them up to the bar for refills.  We were very well-behaved guests, not rude, demanding, or pushy.  But twice, we had to go up to the bar because our glasses had gone dry and remainder that way -- far too long. Our tip reflected the level of service."
McCartney H.,"Schenectady, NY",1,11,,4.0,8/9/2016,"Awesome food, awesome vibes, awesome service. Probably the best place to eat in Chehalis, although I do love Carl's Jr.'s crispy chicken sandwiches and Papa Pete's Pizza in Centrailia's Pepperoni Pizza. Desserts are great, love the churro smores. The burgers are amazing, I highly reccomend the Triple Bacon Burger. This establishment feels really nice to eat in and I love the atmosphere. The waiters / waitresses are always very nice to me and I think you should definetely dine here. Great food, great vibes and great service."
Sierra R.,"Ellensburg, WA",99,4,,1.0,12/4/2016,"Went here the other night while catching up with a friend. Our server Felicia, managed to make an appearance twice: once to start our drinks and then again to get our order. Never checked back, got refills or stopped by our table again. Wish I could have tipped the other staff that picked up her pace. And $6 for a well shot of vodka!!! Will not be returning to this location."
Jamieleigh W.,"Sandpoint, ID",165,469,742,3.0,4/22/2014,"The service is five stars for me, but the food... Not so much. I looked up the menu ahead of time and was really excited about this entree the creamy Parmesan chicken.  The cheese melted on top was tasty with the chicken but the sauce and rice mixture was awful! I couldn't stand the flavor. And the sauce is in between the chicken and the cheese. The spinach had no seasoning whatsoever - salt, pepper, anyone?  I was still hungry so I ordered dessert of the cheesecake apple chiri thing - that was delicious! Vanilla ice cream with caramel topping and a sugar and cinnamon coated tortilla lightly fried with cheesecake in the center.  Also their salads were good and generous portions. I'd try something else here - but prefer other places in town over this one - however, they were closed on Mondays so this was really the only option for us. And it was packed so some people must love it despite the reviews."
Patti Angeliz A.,"Winlock, WA",390,17,1,5.0,10/10/2016,"Ok, we've eaten at a least 10 different applebees here in WA and the one in chehalis is my fav. Jose, the manager,  is the best. He made sure my hubby and I had everything just perfect. He really  cares for his customers and keeps us coming back for more. Its where we stop everytime we travel from Seattle to Portalnd...Yes we can afford better, but why???? Thos place rocks and we like to enjoy a great donner at a reasonable price..... There isnt much to call good as far as eateries goes on Lewis Co., but applebees is our fave.    THANK YOU JOSE!"
Megan B.,"Centralia, WA",104,4,,5.0,10/15/2016,"This is my favorite place in town.  John was our server and he was incredible! we were out with the 3 year old for some quality daughter/ parent date night fun. she doesn't get a lot of that anymore with a new baby in the house, so it was a very social occasion, especially for her. John went above and beyond for our family. service was prompt, the food was incredible, and I got to try one of their Halloween specialty drinks, which was fruity and amazing. John continued to impress by singing to my daughter, drawing her a picture with her crayons, and even wrote her a note telling her she's lovely and to come back soon. he explained he is also a parent, and you can just tell by how he interacts with kids. he blew my mind and I just had to let everyone know about the best server in town!!"
bliss s.,"Antioch, CA",8,98,325,3.0,2/14/2015,The Good: 6.99 Lunch combo specials. Perfect amount of food to fill u up without slowing u down. Lots of choices. Ribs are SUPER! Amazing broccoli soup! Fantastic turkey Sandwich Good salads  Good shrimp & chicken baskets Great service  The Bad: Bar drinks. Just consistently terrible so save ur money The So-So: Music selection
Dennis S.,"Seattle, WA",8,154,1,3.0,9/1/2015,The biggest strength of Applebee's is that you can always get what you expect. My wife and I stop here most times on our way south from Seattle. The salads are good and the service is quick and friendly. The price is also reasonable. It's the perfect place to get a quick respite on a long drive to Portland.
Heather S.,"Centralia, WA",0,7,,1.0,7/15/2016,"Apparently now there is a waiting list to sit in the bar. When im out without my kids I just want to eat and drink where the adults are. Several tables in the bar were unoccupied and not cleared, the only people I saw waiting was a family with small kids. We sat at a table and was told we needed to be on the list. No thanks, if im going to wait to sit in the bar it definitely will NOT be at Applebee's. We left, found a better place."
Kenzie C.,"Portland, OR",130,11,,1.0,12/3/2016,"Horrible service, rude servers... slow and talked to us as if we were dumb. Super slow and they messed up my order. The told me I ordered wrong and didn't offer to fix it. Will never spend my money there again."
Marie M.,"Spanaway, WA",48,56,41,1.0,10/16/2015,"We have come here twice and both times have been a complete waste of money! My husband and I both got steaks and both were under seasoned and not cooked properly. We both couldn't taste anything but syrup and flavoring in our drinks and one of them was a Long island iced tea, so we payed $7 for a lemonade and simple syrup. My kids' food must have been pretty bad as well because they didn't like it all and usually any pizza is good with them. We definitely will not be returning."
Becky K.,"Rochester, WA",9,46,,2.0,2/13/2016,"Husband ordered mac & cheese with chicken something or another and loved it! However, I order fish & chips and got fiesta chicken something... By the time I got my fish & chips I ordered my husband was almost done with his meal. The manager tried offering salad or soup to make up for it but if I had wanted that to begin with I would have order it. They were nice enough to give a $8.00 discount but seriously they screwed up our order and then to top it off the fish & chips were not very good :/ we should have been given the meal for free- it's called good business - you screw up - you eat it. Don't plan on going back."
Brianna L.,"Tacoma, WA",1,13,60,1.0,4/9/2013,"I was driving down from Tacoma, WA to Portland, OR and wanted to grab a burger, but not a gross McDonald's one. So I stopped at this Applebee's and got the Curbside (since I had my daughter asleep in her carseat). They didn't include napkins and when I actually looked at my cowboy burger, I was pretty disappointed. (pictured)  The crispy onion straws were more like unbreaded, microwaved onions, and the burger was waaaay overcooked. Even the fries were bad, limp and not crispy. It's like someone cancelled their already-made-order so they put it in the window for an hour or two and then gave to the next idiot who did curbside.  $10 down the drain for a gross burger."
Melissa H.,"Chehalis, WA",0,15,14,4.0,3/14/2016,"I love half priced apps! My husband and I come here very often, sometimes 3 times a week just for the half priced appetizers. The wonton tacos are delicious and the Asian chili hot wings are so sweet and spicy! The staff is ok, we usually just use the automated screens at our table to place our orders which is awesome! If you want an actual entrée you have to ask your server but that's alright. Applebees is very affordable and the food is so flavorful, I only wish they had a larger menu since we come here so often we are getting a little burnt out on the same items."
E B.,"Centralia, WA",6,12,,5.0,2/25/2016,Edmundo is the most awesome server ever. If you stop here and he is working you definitely need to ask to be seated in his station. Their menu has new delicious offerings that tempt the palate. I loved the Beer Garden burger and it paired great with a Perfect Margarita funny enough. I don't know why this place only has 2.5 stars because I had a great experience and fantastic food.
Charlene L.,"Olympia, WA",2,19,2,4.0,8/5/2015,"Enjoyed the Happy Hour thing, cheap appetizers from 3 to 6.  Had a great Long Island Iced Tea.  My server Shawnda? was awesome and attentive!"
Rob H.,"Centralia, WA",1,211,28,4.0,8/23/2015,I really like Applebee's.  I have been coming  here for years and have never had a bed meal.   I like how their menu changes seasonally.  They also have a great bar with great drinks.  They have an awesome happy hour with 1/2 off apps.  The service is generally good.  I have never had a bad meal here.  Service can sometimes be slow but that is rare.
Gabby L.,"Shoreline, WA",17,16,4,2.0,9/8/2014,"Chehalis must have something better to offer than this. The dishes were dirty when they came out to us. We couldn't be seated at a booth even though several were empty... they were covered with more dirty dishes. Everyone in our party of four had complaints about their food. Oddly shaped ribs, soggy salad with rubbery chicken, and soggy fish with bland veggies. Not worth the 30 bucks I personally spent. The manager kept lingering at our table and frankly looked like he had nothing to do.  It's getting two stars because the server and host were very nice."
Chris O.,"Wilsonville, OR",1,28,,4.0,1/5/2016,"This has been a stopping point on my road trips to Seattle for the past three years. Enjoy and easy service, for a bit to eat and get the eyes a break from the road."
William C.,"Centralia, WA",64,6,,4.0,8/30/2015,Food was great except the coleslaw. Prawns ands cajun shrimp and chicken.  It had no sauce and was just dry cabbage.  The baby back ribs were outstanding.  The server Kristian J. Was friendly and kind and seemed to be the only employee that seemed to want to be there. If you eat here hope you get him.
Wendy S.,"Oregon City, OR",17,91,91,5.0,4/23/2016,"This place is always busy, but very attentive and the food is always great.  We sat at the bar tonight and Victoria (Tory) is the best.  She is always moving fast, makes sure you have everything, gets refills when needed without you having to ask.  She takes care of everyone and has a wonderful happy attitude.  We got the  for $25, he got steak, I got fiesta lime chicken.  We each got a salad, both were excellent, bacon, cucumber, tomato and cheese.  Both meal were perfect.  And the manager is on the floor checking with everyone, talking to them.  And what really made the night perfect was, Mike was joking with the manager, when asked if there was anything he could do, Mike said find someone else to pay, and was laughing.  We went to pay, and found the people sitting next to us, had paid our bill, wow, first time in our life, still cannot believe it.  Thank you, thank you, thank you."
Morgan L.,"Seattle, WA",198,587,835,1.0,5/3/2011,"Thank you ABs for offering to make it a double for just a $1 more on my appletini. For a dollar more, I got an almost real adult beverage.  P.S. Why do so many women work here? Hostess, waitress, bartender, busers- ALL WOMEN. We saw one guy: the manager.  Its creepy."
Crystal H.,"Bothell, WA",9,140,46,4.0,11/13/2014,"Great fresh food, super duper friendly & efficient staff.  Very clean, reasonably priced.  Great comfy lounge with lot's of TV's.    what more could you want ?   Even BREAKFAST at this particular Applebee's on saturday & sunday.  This is our go to place when in the area."
Kevan C.,"Winlock, WA",0,22,17,2.0,3/22/2013,"I gave it three times at bat, I'll not be going back.  The last time was the worst, I've never been served a COLD hamburger before, and it was soggy from over use of the sauce.  I simply could not eat it with my hands, I had to use a knife and fork on it The fries were not even hot.  My review on this place is like the food, cold."
Joshua Y.,"Seattle, WA",0,2,,1.0,9/8/2014,"I should start this review by stating I haven't always been a fan of Applebee's, but when a friend suggested we grab a quick bite to eat I couldn't say no. But how I wish I had said no.  The service here was not terrible and probably the best part of the whole experience. Our waitress was nice and helpful with anything we had questions about. Unfortunately, she was not around often and in place was the manager who was not very personable.  Now on to the worst part...the food. The spinach artichoke dip appetizer was cold and the chips were doused in grease which wasn't a good start. My main entree was the blackened tilapia which I thought would be easy enough to prepare and cook properly, but how I was wrong. The tilapia was flavorless and mushy, the vegetables were still raw in the middle, and the ""crispy"" red potatoes were not at all crispy. Overall, I was disappointed and it left a terrible taste in my mouth. As a side note, how can a Bud Light cost $4.75 at a happy hour anywhere? That to me was the cherry on the awful sundae.  This experience has finally made me say, ""I will never eat at an Applebee's again""."
DeAnna C.,"Tacoma, WA",7,38,8,2.0,1/24/2015,So I am convinced it is an Applebee's thing they can not cook a steak to save their life's.  The lady working the door was older than the hills I stood by her a good five minutes not wanting to say anything  so that I would not give her a heart attack.  I was also not sure she would hear me.  We were seated quickly. I have to say that restaurants are not spaced properly for plus sized people. We ordered and I got the Parmesan shorn and sirloin cooked medium. My kids dad ordered the Thai Seafood Salad which looked decent sized in the menu.  When we got the salad it was microscopic four ounces the manager said. $12 for a tiny side salad seems a bit much.  My steak was well done. I ordered medium. I told the manager he replaced it. This one was cooked right but just like warm the potatoes were powdery and cold. The veggies were cold not impressed. The bacon burgers kids dad got looked sad but he said it was good.  We had to ask the people to bring his onion rings cause they were not on the plate.  I ordered a chocolate mousse shorter dessert and the Oreos in it were stale and mushy.  I am not impressed the manager was apologetic but he only comped our 2.49 dessert and never rechecked back.  The server was super nice and efficient he apologized and told us he was new. I hope this guy moves on from here before he comes hardened into the Applebee's rudeness found at other location. The server is the reason I gave a two star.
Joel V.,"Chehalis, WA",1,20,,5.0,2/19/2016,"I'm a regular here. I can speak for my experience in the bar - fantastic. The staff is fun and attentive, happy hour is the best deal in the area, the the meals are pretty darn good for a chain. I'm very happy this came to Chehalis."
William M.,"Fernley, NV",53,18,1,2.0,7/13/2014,"I'm out here on a business trip, I useally stop at Applebee's while traveling. I like to ha e a cold beer and a quick snack. This is my second time in here., and maybe my last. Food was ok, but I think they skimped on the amount of boneless wings. My draft beer wasn't that cold, and I believe they are called bartenders because they are supposed to tend the bar not her friends. How long could my glass possibly stay empty? You guess is as good as mine, after 10 min I yelled for my ticket. Sorry Applebeee's but you have let me down this time."
David C.,"Shingle Springs, CA",0,9,10,1.0,12/29/2014,"Worst restaurant ever, I would rather starve, than eat there food with hairs in it served ten minutes late !  Hell on earth"
Jena L.,"Oregon City, OR",36,147,79,2.0,1/16/2012,"Usually when we're on a road trip, we try to stick to local, can't-get-this-at-home spots.  Sometimes though, the TV commercial you saw before you left the house looked pretty good, especially since it's already late and pretty much everything else is closed...and so we wound up at Applebee's on our way north. We had the sliders (they were pretty good), and one of their steak specials (meh), and an order of orange chicken (less than meh).  Service was way less than stellar.  My well vodka/pineapple juice was overpriced I thought. This is not a spot we will be stopping at again on our road trips."
Peter A.,"Centralia, WA",321,227,10,3.0,10/5/2011,All Applebees are the same! The only differences are the team jerseys on the wall.  The staff are great here. The beer is cold. The food is the same from Maine to Washington.
Ben C.,"Bellevue, KY",66,229,79,1.0,11/16/2010,This is one of the few applebees that really enforces a beverage purchase for EVERY happy hour menu item so it doesn't work out to be that great a deal if you just want food. Also this is the only restaurant in my life that I have have ever been charged for xtra pickles. The manager made a special visit to notify us that it would be an extra 50 cents. When we got our receipt he had charged 75 cents. I hope it was worth it for them. Ironically at the time the manager visited we still did not have our plates but he seemed more interested in the 50 cents.
Chris B.,"Centralia, WA",173,7,,1.0,10/22/2010,"Went to Chehalis Applebees for lunch around 1 p.m. on 10/22/10 with the girlfriend. Ordered chicken penne and tomato basil soup for a lunch special. The food came cold, the soup was semi-warm and the penne was watery and lacked any sort of consistency. Our server was generally pleasant but kept trying to push us to order more food, dessert, etc. repeatedly (one of my biggest turn-offs when going out to eat). I've heard bad things about the Chehalis Applebees before, but this was the first time I had food that looked AND tasted nasty. I know Applebees is on the lower tier of sit-in restaurants, but if I shell out around $11 for a lunch special and Mountain Dew, the MD shouldn't be the best part of the meal. Major thumbs down."
Scott R.,"Centralia, WA",37,25,12,2.0,4/10/2013,Came here with some gift cards we got for Christmas.. Worst sandwich experience at a restaurant it was disgusting.. the manager ended up offering me more sandwiches after my complaints but who would want more of the same disgusting food the fries were still partially frozen  and the  club was extremely sweet and mayonnaisey Would definitely not recommend!!!
