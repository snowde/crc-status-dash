Katie S.,"Fernley, NV",33,20,10,2.0,7/3/2012,"This is not one of the better Applebees that I've been to. When its busy the wait staff is moving too fast for you to catch them if you need something and your meal feels rushed. The smiles that you get once in a while are fake and wait staff comes off as insincere. The food quality is inconsistent and usually not very good, although sometimes you can get a really good meal. The quality is sub par and the price is high, I will not waste my time or money here again."
Road Warrio R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,103,6,3.0,12/13/2012,Applebee's is never my first choice but I was hungry and it was late.   This place was crowded so I sat at the bar.  I got my food pretty in a few minutes after I ordered.   The steak was cooked the way I liked it.  It wasn't the greatest cut of beef but it was tasty with my shrimp and vegetables.
R Z.,"Puyallup, WA",0,11,1,2.0,5/26/2013,"Had the Nachos, even half price wouldn't help. Taco Bell $1.99 nachos would be a better choice.  Applebee's uses low quality everything !!!"
Dave C.,"Bremerton, WA",0,4,,4.0,5/8/2011,"This location has attentive, friendly staff that treat like more than just another person walking through the door. Every time we've ordered, our food arrives in a fair amount of time and is hot/cold etc. The furniture looks better than many places, no tears or duct tape patches. Not sure why everyone else has had lousy results but in over 15 visits I've never had anything worth complaining about."
Joy G.,"Vancouver, WA",2,8,2,4.0,10/29/2010,"I have been many times always good, always slow. I did the curbside tonight pretty darn quick.  yes they do push more food and dessert but so does Starbucks and everyone else."
