Dom B.,"New Baltimore, MI",4,85,92,3.0,7/16/2017,"Just another average American styled restaurant in the local area. They have had some really good seasonal meals in recent years. Food is pretty average. Really great staff however. Lastly, prices are reasonable. Nothing to out of the ordinary."
Lynore W.,"New Baltimore, MI",21,2,,5.0,12/29/2017,Appetizers were great. The waitress was wonderful and didn't have any problems with us using our yelp accounts. Good atmosphere and good foos
Nancy B.,"New Baltimore, MI",3,11,1,1.0,12/19/2017,If I can do it 0 Stars  i would.. it was awful  my husband had a salad that had dirt on it that he didn't notice until after eating  some of it....also ordered dessert and had eggshells still in it....so nice that they didn't charge us....never will go back as quality is definitely an issue
Jay N.,"New Baltimore, MI",6,30,1,1.0,10/8/2017,"Chesterfield Applebee's leaves a lot to be desired. The last time I was there I ordered a quesadilla burger and ff. After waiting nearly 40 mins and having to flag down any server who would pay attention, I finally got my food. The burger looked like it was dropped on the floor then scraped back onto my plate, the ff were greasy limp and cold. Typical chain food garbage."
Deborah M.,"Chesterfield, MI",11,6,,2.0,11/11/2017,"The French onion soup tasted odd, the bone less wings were cold, the service was slow. Disappointing visit."
Delaney N.,"New Baltimore, MI",0,2,,1.0,9/15/2017,"The majority of the staff is extremely rude. There is a specific waitress, Kayyla R, who yelled at my friend and I and rolled her eyes at us when we added to our order."
Charles J.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",5,8,3,4.0,7/15/2017,Good food and service. I recommend boneless wings and pretzels. Burgers are very good and so are ribs. Half price appetizers later at night are a good deal. Obnoxious loud music.
Cristina B.,"Chesterfield, MI",260,136,64,4.0,8/19/2015,"Applebee's has changed a lot in recent times and it's all for the better! For starters -- their menu has been revamped and expanded. Gone are some of the old favorites (RIP Oriental Chicken Rollup and Southwest Salad) but hello, pretzels, sandwiches, and thai shrimp salad! Their burger list is also quite expansive if that's your forte. Always remember to check out their appetizers as well. I recommend the aforementioned pretzel sticks and onion rings. Seriously, the cheese for the pretzels is to die for! Served hot with plenty of flavor that isn't too much of a spicy kick. Don't want to spend the money on apps? They still offer half off appetizers at a certain time too. If you're looking into the 2 for $20 of 2 for $25 menu, you can also order an entree from either side and the waitress will be gladly split the bill for you. It should come out to $23 for so (apparently most don't realize this!)  Service has improved so much since my last review. Chesterfield may lack some good chain restaurants but at least I know I can count on Applebee's for quality food and good services. Only complaint is that it's sometimes chilly inside. Bring a jacket!"
Jinda B.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,4,1,4.0,4/13/2016,"Spent a night at the bar with my sis and tried the sangria, which was delightful, and some appetizers.  She had iced tea, which was what she expected. Had the sriacha shrimp and beer cheese with pretzel sticks.  Both winning choices and easy to share.  Bar staff was accommodating and very friendly."
Carey G.,"New Baltimore, MI",0,27,,3.0,4/8/2017,Its been 4 years since I have been to this restaurant. Last time I was here we walked out after sitting at our table for 20 minutes and never being acknowledged. This time service was better but still slow and the waiter did apologize for his absence. The food was good but the portion was on the small side in my opinion but I guess that's what you get for ordering off the 2 for 20.
Steven B.,"Macomb, MI",31,51,,5.0,7/26/2017,"We have never ever had a bad experience at Applebees! Great food, great staff and fair prices!"
Vanessa K.,"Macomb, MI",42,28,,3.0,3/16/2017,It was alright. Our waitress didn't check up on us often but really we were there to use gift cards.
Stephanie B.,"New Baltimore, MI",56,299,324,1.0,7/17/2014,My boyfriend and I debated where to go late Sunday evening and we decided on Applebees. We were seated immediately and ordered our drinks within seconds. Awesome. I was hoping the rest of the meal would be this quick. Wrong! We ordered our food. We were going to get the 2 for $20 meal. I ordered the oriental chicken salad with crispy chicken. The waitress informed us that they don't carry that salad anymore. So we had to find new items to get. I ordered the cheeseburger sliders with fries- no onions or special sauce and my boyfriend ordered the chili lime sirloin. We were informed that was also no longer on the menu and it was a seasonal item. Weird. That too was on the menu. He ordered a sirloin with veggies and redskins.  We also used the free Yelp offer for free pretzels and pub cheese. The waitress was clueless and thought I was lying just to get free food. There was also an advertisement on each table to show free offer when you check in. The appetizer came about 45 minutes after we ordered. Pretzel sticks were pretty well done and hard while the cheese was lukewarm- if that! Food came about 25 minutes after our appetizer. My sliders were over cooked and burnt- they looked worse that Steak N Shake burgers- and they also had onions and special sauce on them. Fries were hard as rocks. My boyfriends sirloin wasn't cooked the way he wanted and his veggies were still frozen while his redskins looked as though they were served to a few customers and reheated four different times. We didn't bother getting new food because we couldn't find our waitress and we were already so sick of waiting as it was. Before we even got our appetizer we seen the manager talk to 5 tables in our section. Doesn't sound like Applebees had a very good night.  Very poor service. We won't be back for awhile. I can't get the taste of burnt burger out of my mouth.  After we left we found articles online about an E Coli breakout in Iowa and Minnesota because of the oriental chicken salad. I wish the waitress would have just told us rather than beat around the bush. Perhaps the restaurant sound have had signs on the menus or door entrances.
Tiffany C.,"Macomb, MI",63,3,3,1.0,10/13/2016,"Food is always super greasy, only thing good about the play is the half off apps."
Catherine C.,"Saint Clair Shores, MI",25,22,29,5.0,2/23/2016,"Friendly staff, enjoyed the music , not too loud could still talk . Food was good. Took a while for my soup to come to the table , was not busy."
Gina K.,"Richmond, MI",0,19,1,5.0,7/7/2016,Anthony P. Was a great waiter! We did not have to ask for anything. We had appetizers and a dinner and did not have to ask for water or for napkins he was right right on top of things. Thank you Anthony for a great experience at Applebee's!
Todd J.,"New Baltimore, MI",47,52,91,2.0,11/18/2015,"Very disappointing for my fiancés bday lunch. Didn't know they no longer offer steak fajitas and we ordered new menu items. Both dishes contained the brisket, it was soooooo salty we couldn't eat it. It tasted as if it was a boil in the bag meal and reheated.  Everything was tasteless and dry.  Very sad but it sometimes happens. We did tell our server who was awesome, but it's not her fault. We strongly believe that the smaller local mom and pop restaurants are going to thrive based on these poor food chains not listening to thier customers."
Christopher O.,"Roseville, MI",0,2,,1.0,7/22/2016,So the universe must have been telling my something tonight. After a bad experience at a another establishment.  We thought to stop by here for a drink and some food.  I should have known better and went home.  Only good thing here is the drinks.  Food is bad still.  They have tried to change the menu but they should try changing the help.
Eddie A.,"Macomb, MI",11,75,19,5.0,7/23/2015,"All I can say is.... ""Buffalo Who???"" If you want Buffalo wings, don't waste your time going to the B W's, they have nothing on Applebee's. Not only does Applebee's have tasty wings that fit any budget, they have the Appetizers that make a meal there. Friendly service from the door to the table. Many Applebee's should take a hint from this location, they do it right."
Julie M.,"New Baltimore, MI",18,5,,2.0,5/9/2016,This place is dirty. Pop is always watered down and fried foods tastes like the grease needs to be changed.
Erin A.,"Fair Haven, MI",6,14,16,1.0,12/1/2014,"Ok, I give 0 stars.   My cousin and I decided to go here for lunch.  We were seated right away. It took 5 minutes for our server to get out drink order. No big deal. Then it took about 10 for her to come back with the drinks. Getting a little more frustrated.  Soon we get our order placed. I got a ""Chicken Caesar Salad""( (C. C. S.) going to abbreviate later)  with a ""classic turkey sandwich. "" 15-20 minutes later TAKING FOREVER!!! Then finally get our order.  I ""downed"" my turkey sandwich and move on to the C.C.S.  My cousin then says to me...  ""LOOK! You have a fly in your salad!"" I replied ""No I don't! ... Stop fooling around""  ""Take your fork and move your lettuce around!""  ""Ok.""  I then move my lettuce around (obviously), and let out a small scream or a shriek, saying quote, ""OMG!!! Ewwwwww!"", pushing my plate immediately away from me.  People who are nearby look at me and stare to see what is going on..... So, there were about 7 little bugs crawling around IN MY SALAD !!! The best I can describe what they looked like was MINI little, bee, looking things. We get a waitress to find our waitress over to our table. She then goes and gets the manager. He apologized and got me another turkey sandwich, which took a long time to get, and took my order off the bill. The manager said the lettuce must have not been washed. That is unacceptable at a type restaurant like this!  Needless to say I don't have good experiences at Applebee's. I will not be returning for a VERY long time. I can get better quality food for the same price, somewhere else...."
Jessica S.,"New Baltimore, MI",20,11,1,2.0,12/7/2014,"Need a place to go late night? Don't go here! Bourbon chicken and shrimp looked like slopped together garbage that they threw on a plate. Rubberized chicken and shrimp with about 7 potatoes. I also tried the chicken tortilla soup. Yuck! Everything was slightly warm and looked like crap. Our server although pleasant to speak to was to busy grabbing the cocky male host to flirt with the underage girls in the booth behind us. Making them place the guess my age game...finally they nailed it at 34.  Grand total for 2 drinks, 1 entree, soup, salad and a dessert. $43 for hot garbage. The only reason I even gave 2 stars was the drinks and desserts. But at the end of the day if you want a late night meal go to Taco Bell. You will save a shit ton of money on better tasting garbage."
Alex K.,"Auburn Hills, MI",227,397,378,2.0,10/26/2013,"Oh for Christ's sake, people. First of all, it wasn't my decision to come here. I was told, ""Oh! It's better than it was before! I promise!"" I constantly see hoards of sheep hurrying in here, and Applebee's is almost always packed to the rafters when I drive by. I wound up getting some sort of garlic shrimp and steak ""Under 550 Calories"" dish. It didn't suck, but it wasn't great. First, I asked for medium rare, but the steak was well-done. I didn't have them take it back because I was too damn hungry, and the steak wasn't overcooked to the point where it was dry or burnt or anything. It was edible. Also, the vegetables were only half-cooked (some places do that on purpose to give texture). It didn't taste bad at all, but it wound up costing about $16 for that and a bowl of the tomato basil soup, which also was alright, but luke warm. I didn't want to come here to begin with, and I'm sorry I did. I'd much sooner go to a place like Ruby Tuesday if I'm forced to go to some sort of chain restaurant nearby. Two stars because the steak was cooked too long, and the prices are waaay too high. If that's not enough, it seemed nearly as cold inside as it did outside on a 40 degree day. What, didn't pay your bill? Still not a fan of Applebee's, and I don't plan to go back. Don't waste your time (and especially money) coming here."
Gwendolyn F.,"New Baltimore, MI",15,14,,2.0,9/3/2016,Food not that good and skimpy on the take outs.  Not my cup of tea.  O.k. when you get tired of McDonalds.
Haley P.,"New Baltimore, MI",2,14,2,1.0,2/8/2016,"Literally, horrible service every single time I come here. I just wanted a quick bite after the Wings game and have been here over an hour. Asked for the check and it took forever. Never coming back, sick of this."
Kris F.,"St Clair County, MI",90,220,117,1.0,10/21/2013,"I usually enjoy Applebee's - however this location always disappoints! The service is always bad - the past two times they had excuses; what do you know but tonight was the same - their cook called and and they were short servers?! I should not know this - but it's how my server greeted us upon coming to take our drink order.  So this lack of staff apparently gave our server the freedom to ""gossip"" for 20 minutes - while my daughter had no ranch in her chicken strip basket-? Yes as a good mom I gave mine up. Empty pop cups, listening to crabby waitresses = 10 % tip! Yep, get what ya give!"
Jason H.,"Chicago, IL",104,361,3,3.0,7/7/2013,"Came here for lunch while visiting family.  The food was good, really liked the turkey bacon and avocado sandwich, which is huge. However, this place is sloooooooow.  It wasn't anywhere near capacity either.  As my sister said, ""would hate to see this place when they're busy."""
Scott M.,"Washington, MI",2,48,2,2.0,10/5/2014,"Stopped in for a beer and a burger. I have been to this Applebee's years ago when I lived closer. They redecorated, it's more contemporary , and the updated look was nice. I arrived at noon and sat at the bar, I was eating solo, so I thought this would give me the fastest service. There was nobody at the bar and a few tables were occupied in the bar area. The service was good. Ordered a draft beer and a burger. that's when it started to get funky!!! As the bar tender was filling my mug , Fruit flies everywhere!! This is a sure sign of a dirty back bar!! One of my pet peeves. I do have to say the burger and fries were good. The burger was juicy and had a nice flavor. I just had to wait a moment as the server  retrieved  some silverware for me. The manager stopped by to ask how everything was. I told him""good, however, you should look into the fruit fly problem"". He seemed to have knowledge of the problem and assured me that someone would be out the next day. I was going to give a one star , however the food was good and standard fare for the chain style restaurant. The dirtiness was a turn-off and I would never think about bringing friends or family here. I might stop in again if I was in the area and need a fast burger and brew."
Mark H.,"New Haven, MI",0,57,,5.0,9/4/2016,Good location. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Food seems to be better at this one. Will be coming back.
Anonymous D.,"Saint Clair Shores, MI",0,93,,2.0,1/3/2016,Basic bar menu. Not very tasty. Sports bar atmosphere. Needs renovation.
Brielle R.,"Wyoming, MI",110,4,,3.0,2/8/2016,"When I was in school, my friends and I would always go to Applebee's for half priced apps & drinks, but this time I decided to be an adult and order off of the menu! I had the Shrimp Wonton Stir Fry and it was very delicious, I was kind of weary about ordering an Asian dish from an American restaurant but it had great flavors, plenty of shrimp, and was a good price. I only wish there were more wontons, but otherwise, no complaints!"
A H.,"Harrison Township, MI",3,7,3,2.0,7/12/2014,Food is not good. Very bland.  Service was alright. It seemed like the waitress forgot about us a couple times.  One of my relatives got sick hours after eating here that night.  The prices wouldn't be so bad if the food tasted better.
Olivia W.,"Mount Clemens, MI",16,21,3,5.0,7/21/2015,Came here for an early dinner around 4pm & it was happy hour. Our server Ashley with a smiling face let us know that from 3-6 is happy hour! I ordered the bourbon steak with red skin potatoes & it was to die for! Beer was awesome & service was great. Ashley was quick and got us everything we needed. She made us laugh and definitely made it a nice enjoyable dinner experience.
Jaimie D.,"Roseville, MI",18,7,,4.0,11/4/2015,Friendly service and delicious food ...can't beat the two for twenty deal with an appetizer ...delicious spinach and artichoke dip ....I'd drive here before going to the Roseville location any day
Emina H.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",15,9,26,2.0,6/7/2014,"I regret taking my family here. I started feeling sick that same night and two other people in my group weren't feeling well either.  The service was decent, could have been better.  As for the food, nothing special really. The boneless wings were OK, the sliders tasted like a McDonald's burger, the spinach artichoke dip was lacking taste, and the others in my group thought their food was alright or a waste.  Their menu is overpriced for the quality of the food they serve.  What did I expect? It's a chain restaurant after all."
Linda M.,"New Baltimore, MI",30,22,10,5.0,4/2/2015,"Delicious , love the 2 for $20 dinner with appetizer special.  Three cheese chicken penne was great, and the spinach artichoke appetizer is a classic.  The shooter dessert is just the right size for a little sweet tooth.  Great waitress, and the manager even checked up on our satisfaction."
Tracee L.,"New Baltimore, MI",45,9,1,5.0,8/22/2015,"This place is awesome. Love the perfect ...and wait staff....well they are Fantastic! Make a mean drink, and are very entertaining."
Riley A.,"New Baltimore, MI",0,3,,3.0,4/20/2016,"Really good salads, and I love their French onion soup! As far as service goes, I've had good and bad, but the bad was pleasantly corrected by management. Overall, it's usually a good experience!"
Catrina D.,"New Baltimore, MI",16,2,,2.0,8/1/2015,"Giving them another try after bad service for the past 4 times. It started out great with a wonderful server named Frances taking our drink orders within a few minutes of seating. She came back with the drinks and took our order immediately.  It took about 15 minutes for some of our food to come out of the kitchen. It took an additional 20 minutes for the last of our order to come. Our wonderful server had to tell the kitchen to remake it since they let it sit.  While the server was great, the food just wasn't and some of it was cold. Overall, I wasn't impressed with the food but superb server. Frances is the best server I have ever had anywhere."
Michael S.,"Greer, SC",42,212,69,4.0,3/10/2012,"Food was good. We had the 2 for 20 deal. Potato Twisters, 7 oz steak cooked to perfection, and a Fried Chicken Salad. Only complaints is the place was cold, air cond was blowing cold, and what's up with the lights. They are bright, then dim, and bright and then dim again. The waitress explained that they are on a timer."
