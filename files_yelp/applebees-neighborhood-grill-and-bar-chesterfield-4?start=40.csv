Gerianne A.,"Fair Haven, MI",1,54,3,2.0,3/6/2015,"Not horrible.  But portion size is super small . Got the broccoli shrimp cavatappi pasta. Daughter's dinner was not as described in menu.  But, otherwise okay. Service is good the though."
Rachel A.,"Thompsonville, MI",1,9,2,2.0,2/17/2015,"Waiter was less than enthusiastic to be there,  never even cracked a smile. Ordered the appetizer trio, very small portion except for the beer cheese that came with pretzel breadsticks. Portion was huge and it was yummy, we saved to dip fries in. I ordered the Thai shrimp salad. There was almost no dressing, the chili sauce on it tastes more like BBQ sauce, I asked for more dressing, when he brought me pb sauce it tasted much better. Apparently they forgot to put it on. We only went because We were given a gift card. Probably won't. Go back, but I'm also not a fan of food chains."
Jacki B.,"Westerville, OH",0,9,6,4.0,7/5/2014,oriental chicken salad was great. Orange chicken salad was good. Nice and clean good atmosphere.   Hamburger was fine.
Moose D.,"Detroit, MI",0,24,20,1.0,8/16/2014,No silverware salad came steak was not good the only reason I came is cause I had a gift card. I have no idea how they are in business I would avoid at all cost
Samantha P.,"New Baltimore, MI",9,8,,1.0,11/29/2014,"Worst service by far I've had here. My boyfriend and I came back from Detroit hoping to watch the wings game and have a good time. The restaurant wasn't too busy. We were sat down in a booth on the far left side of the restaurant. No one served us for 10 minutes. We ended up getting up and sitting at the bar. We were immediately greeted by Randal and Crystal. It started off good until we waited forever for our cheese sticks. 20 minutes later, we got them with the littlest side of ranch. They said the Marinera will be on its way. The girl who brought us it out said she would bring us the Marinera. Her name was either Jessica or chelsea. She was bright blonde with a flower pulled up in her hair. She never went back to the kitchen once. She sat at the bar with some guy and had conversation with him for a whole hour while staring back at us. Not even acknowledging that she forgot. Then Randall came back and said you didn't want bruschetta on your pasta right? I said no. 15 minutes later it came back out and the girl said did you ask for the pasta with the side of bruschetta. I said no I didn't ask for it at all. Randall made a nasty comment saying well it's the same thing so yeah. I never got a breadstick with my meal either like you are suppose to. I asked for one and they never brought me it. After we got our food, they just sat around and were conversating with people at different tables sitting down and acting like it was a party. Waiters were texting, one was having a beer with another customer. Very unprofessional in my opinion. And it looked like the managers didn't give two cares in the world what was going on. Overall, I was not happy with the experience. I've had problems like this before here. Thumbs down. Get your act together."
Cheryl B.,"Fair Haven, MI",0,2,,4.0,3/20/2016,"OK, I like to be fair so will update my original review to reflect our most recent visit to this location.  I went to another location a month ago with my daughter in law (at her request) and it was basically / mostly terrible so won't go into that... amazingly, this time (2 days ago) at this location ~ was with my hubby (who said he would never return) but it was at our 5 year old granddaughter's request (he is putty in her hands.. ;0}.  We did not respond or contact Jasmine regarding her post (we just feel that it sometimes comes out that someone is trying to get something for nothing so we didn't do that).. anyway, my point is: they didn't have any reason to know who we were or anything like that on this visit.  Immediately, we weren't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised.  Our server Jon, was EXCEPTIONAL ~ he was attentive but not overly so, checked on us at basically all the right times, explained some of the dishes and knew the answers to the questions we asked (no, we did not mention our problems in the past).  We ordered quite a few different dishes and ALLLLL came out at the correct temperature for eating.  We did have a problem with some of the available sauces though... taste wise, we felt that we were more eating at somewhere like Chili's (which we enjoy but did not choose this time) than at what is supposed to be concerned traditional American... basically every sauce has some sort of spice or heat to it or is smoke flavored... Applebee's truly needs to add a sweet and sour, a honey BBQ, a thousand island type for onion rings... etc..... just one or two more that does not have some sort of heat to the bite.  We added on to our order in the middle of eating our first orders and he didn't make us feel like we were bothering him.  Everything was clean; including the bathrooms... We were 'checked' on my management at two different times .. first was after receiving our drinks by a woman (didn't catch her name), then by Ken while we were eating who was checking to make sure all was well with us.  One problem that we didn't like (and didn't mention) was we were up on the higher level second booth in and there was never less than 4 employees standing at the door chatting away.  Only one was seating customers and the 3 others never left while a few others came and went.  We heard ALLLL of their entire conversations;; nothing bad, mind you BUT we really don't need to know the lives of the young ladies working there and/or their complaints about working conditions/customers etc.... we were there between 4-6pm on a Friday so they were not empty and there MUST of been something for those ladies to do.  Truly just doesn't look good to have employees standing around in a group for soooooo long anyway (busy or not).  Anyway, to wrap this up; this visit was a vast improvement and we did tell Jon that we would write a review and mention his service (because he earned it).   More than likely, we would/will come back but because of family not the menu .. we just didn't feel like we were physically satisified when we left but our granddaughter Loved her 3 cheese chicken mac & cheese and strawberry yogurt meal and the chicken nuggets (but thank goodness I happened to have a pack of Chicken Shack BBQ in her bag or that would of been a flop  ~~ a good grandma ALWAYS has a bag of the kiddies faves ;0}"
Stacy B.,"Algonac, MI",48,42,6,1.0,5/22/2013,"I was very disappointed in my last visit to Applebee's. I ordered an appetizer of their hot spinach dip. When it got to our table, it was cold and runny. I was disgusted with the way it looked, and unfortunately it tasted worse. We requested a new appetizer, they brought out the same exact spinach dip that we had sent back, but this time it was hot.  I spoke to the wait staff, and she said she would take it off our bill- which didn't happen. Our overall experience was unpleasant, and we most likely won't be back for some time, if ever."
Yata W.,"New Baltimore, MI",1,10,5,5.0,7/28/2014,"I eat here all the time. The Bourbon Street chicken or steak with shrimp is great. The staff is always friendly and the food is always good. I only had a problem with my food one time and it was because the cook was new. The manager was made aware of my dissatisfaction (without me having to ask for the manger) and gave me a discount on my order. After that, I never had another problem."
J C.,"New Baltimore, MI",0,38,,1.0,10/29/2014,"Just a follow up to my review I did the Survey on the receipt explaining my bad experience. I was asked whether i would like to be contacted regarding my experience i said yes. To my surprise no one ever contacted me, just another example of how Applebees does not care about their customers. Shame on them!"
Mike K.,"New Haven, MI",1,4,,5.0,7/27/2011,Unlike the other reviews my family and I eat there often. Never had any problems with food or service.
Sandy S.,"Chesterfield, MO",0,3,,1.0,3/9/2013,"My family and I came in here the other night with high standards. The place was a zoo and we were on a wait. The hostess had a bunch of open tables and the manger wasn't helping to seat. We finally sat down, the food was okay, not the greatest. Some manager named Connie was so rude to us and the table, let's just say were not coming back here again."
G B.,"New Baltimore, MI",0,14,6,1.0,5/30/2011,Sloppy and soggy food with watered down drinks. No reason to ever repeat this awful experience.
Thomas D.,"New Baltimore, MI",0,16,,4.0,1/16/2014,"our go to restaurant for a nice family meal.  good food, nice atmosphere, have never had bad service here.  love the three cheese chicken penne."
