Richard W.,"Mammoth Lakes, CA",6,95,34,2.0,10/31/2017,"Ate here because of the location, not because of the 2-star reviews! Yes, it's a 2-star place. Next time, I'll choose a Krispy Kreme burger for dindin over this joint. Enjoy!!!"
Jonathan D.,"Chico, CA",9,22,1,1.0,8/6/2017,"Applebees was fun to go to for half priced appetizers....but then they took off half of the appetizers that qualify for the deal, and they added on a beverage purchase requirement.   That did it for us.  We went to Olive Garden instead.  Now we don't even want to go to Applebee's anymore   :("
Jacqueline S.,"Kapolei, HI",98,25,43,1.0,6/20/2017,"NEVER GOING BACK....... Showed up at 9pm, so I get it's later in the night. AC is broken. Fine. I accepted that it would be warm on this 104 degree day. After a long while Waitress took our drink orders. Then we sat there and watched a young gal get seated next to us. She took her order first. Ok? She eventually came back and took our order. We eventually got our drinks 20 mins later. Turns out the girl next to us either works there or is a friend or something, cause right after she took our order the gals food came out.  Keep in mind we ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer. 30 mins later I canceled the appetizer order because why bother after 30 mins?  Sooo, meanwhile, we are sitting there hot and hungry, no appetizer, and homie is enjoying her food and has pretty much completed her meal after two different employees sit to chat with her (including our waitress). Some of it bitching about fellow employees and some of it bitching about customers. 50 mins later the food finally comes out. No offer for refills by the way at any point while we sit there roasting. I had to go to the bar to get my son's drink refilled. Never got asked if we needed anything.  They set the plates down and my shrimp is raw except on the very tail ends where it's burnt. I immediately ask for a to go box because I'm done. I've lost my appetite and I'm just angry. This was the absolute worst service I have ever received in Chico.  My shrimp was raw, my husband says his steak was bland and flavorless. I'm glad I preserved my one glass of tea through that entire hour of waiting for our food because apparently that was all I was going to get.  I want to call the manager to tell him how awful this experience was, but there's no point, as there's nothing that can be done to rectify this situation. I'm never going back. No more chances. The last few times we have gone has not been good and this is the last straw. Goodbye forever Applebee's. Don't go there. Save your money."
Frank W.,"Chico, CA",3,24,5,1.0,4/1/2017,Burnt to a cerisp! My dinner is so burnt that everything on the plate taste like charcoal. Wtf are they doing in their kitchen to allow this.
Peggy B.,"Sioux Falls, SD",5,92,26,2.0,9/4/2017,"I gave it 2 stars because the service was good and friendly and efficient. My favorite salad , the oriental chicken salad was the worst. The lettuce was old, had a lot of brown and was limp. The rest of the veggies tasted old. You could taste the preservatives on them. The chicken was good. The chicken wings were excellent. Adam our server was excellent.  Too bad the kitchen is not."
Kelsey J.,"Paradise, CA",23,33,8,1.0,1/8/2017,"We are currently at the Applebees location in Chico and I wanted to share this with anyone and everyone who is planning on coming here. DO NOT BOTHER!  The first problem was that we both got the 4 Cheese Mac and Cheese and we both got nothing but raw bacon in it.  The second problem is that I asked for a refill from an inattentive waiter and he came up and replaced the straw in front of me and just stuck it in my cup, his fingers almost touching the beverage. That's disgusting.  The third problem is that there are 2 waitresses standing around gossiping when the tables are extremely sticky.  Do not bother with this Applebees at all, unless you want food poisoning."
Estevan L.,"Willows, CA",49,5,3,1.0,8/20/2017,"8/20/17 around 12:00-1:00pm and I orders half rack ribs and they were all dry and nasty, they only put BBQ sauce on the top of the ribs and not on the bottom, my biggest issue was that they were dry and tasted like they were Days old that sat in the fridge. The waitress was amazing her name was Kat she told the cook that I said he sucks at cooking and I guess he's not going to send out anymore dry ribs. She asked me if I wanted another plate but I declined just the fact that they were all going to be dry! That's Kat for helping out."
Daniel C.,"Redding, CA",88,3,,1.0,8/3/2017,"This is the worst Applebee's that me and my wife have ever been to.  We spent $ 50.00 dollars last night,  we don't go out much because money is real tight,  my wife's steak was soo small,  it was embarrassing it was the size of a silver dollar, my chicken was burnt and tasted horrible, the best part of the whole meal, was the 2 beers i had. Save your money and don't eat there,  we will never be back"
K M.,"Chico, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/25/2017,Horrible rude service! Especially when there were so few customers. Food tastes horrible! Waiting forever for basic things! Way to expensive for our service and how the food tasted!
Debbie R.,"GO, Italy",0,7,,1.0,10/28/2017,Very poor service; restaurant under staffed for its capacity. Waited over 30 minutes for just water. Another 30 before our order was taken. A two hour dining experience for mediocre food. Paying the bill was also a hassle. I will never go back.
Jessica H.,"Chico, CA",103,3,1,1.0,6/20/2017,"This place always takes FOREVER!  Our first server was working her ass off because she was the only one on the floor but when the other lady took her shift over she didnt come by at all except to bring our food.  We got there at 3:20 and were served at 4:30.  There was only 2 other tables with customers and 1 person at the bar, and we didnt ask for more time to order...idk...  I had to request boxes from the host and the waitress was rude when I told her I needed the check.  Almost 2 hours for a late lunch with no crowd and bad service is more than annoying."
Veronica B.,"Chico, CA",83,15,31,1.0,10/20/2017,Sat for 15-20 minutes no one came to check to see if we want something to drink or if we were ready to order. We got up and left.
Joe B.,"Chico, CA",0,69,5,1.0,7/6/2017,"This is an update to my last review 5 years ago. Decided to give it another try as I hoped the service would be better. Service was a little better than last time but they still forgot napkins and silverware twice. Food was just ok. What disgusted me the most was how filthy and booths and blinds are. The sun was shining in our eyes so I shut the blinds. I saw ketchup, mustard, boogers, and a dead bug on the window sill. Then I looked closer at the booth seats and there was greasy finger marks all over along with some more ketchup smeared on the back portion of the booth. A little cleaning would go a long way. I guess I'll try it again in another 5 years, but until then there are other places in town that offer a way better dining experience."
Crystal W.,"Chico, CA",40,5,1,1.0,7/4/2017,"If I could give them 0 stars I would! Our waiter never once stopped by to ask if we need anything, to refill our drinks. Or ask how things were going. He literally ignored us. The only two times we were served was from a female waitress from a different part of the floor. We received our food last after been the first in the section and only people in the section when we ordered might I add!! I will never be coming back. And I will tell everyone I know, how this place is basically a shit hole."
H. H.,"Chico, CA",1,115,4,1.0,9/23/2017,"I went here again for a meeting.. was totally scared as last times visit was bad. But I thought maybe I came on a bad day or they had improved. I will never eat here again, ever. Some food was cold and some scalding. Food had soooo much salt I only ate part because I was starving. A huge glob of garlic butter was put on top which added nothing, was just gross. Even the next day I could taste that gross garlic taste in my mouth, I felt sick. Patrons were angry, the place was filthy, and service was horrendous. Never even got a drink. Our waitress looked like her clothes were pulled out of hamper for the fifth day in a row and she was hung over. Horrible environment. Nasty. Never again!"
Michael S.,"Chico, CA",0,7,3,1.0,3/7/2017,"Less than McDonald's quality staff. It took longer than 20 minutes for our order to be taken, at which time I ordered a drink. 25 minutes later, when my food came I still hadn't gotten a drink. I figured it wouldn't be worth it because, I wouldn't get a refill at this point so, I told the waitress I hadn't received a drink and that I didn't want it anymore. The waitress told me it hadn't been added to my ticket and that she forgot. I digress. The food was alright, except for the fact that there was the base of a head of lettuce comprising an 8th of my salad. My lady's salad had the same addition. When we went to pay the bill on the ultra bright table tablet, distraction device, we couldn't help but notice the waitress is a LIAR AND A FATMOUTH! The drink was added to the bill! Not the end of the world but, still... We pressed the button on the ultra bright table tablet, distraction device, which is supposed to do part of the staff's job by being attentive. After a few more minutes of waiting, I see the end of this miserable experience, approaching to fix this bill issue. But alas, I was mistaken. At the last moment the waitress turned to ask another table about their experience and then, walked away, leaving me to sit and wait another 5 minutes until she came back out. After that was all said and done, I again, went to pay the bill. I laughed audibly as the ultra bright table tablet, distraction device suggested I leave a 20% tip, as if one was merited at all! I was sad to reach into my pocket and find it had no pennies. I wanted to leave her my ""two cents""."
Jim K.,"Borrego Springs, CA",1,22,1,2.0,6/4/2017,"Applebee restaurant  in Chico Ca.. 6/3/17,I ordered a top Sirloin steak was very chewy.  I will not order this steak again anywhere.  This cut of meat has always been this way. Hopping that Applebee's would change my thoughts. It didn't. The cook did a great job but that didn't help. I was sorry that was the only cut of steak they have.  The service was OK. Most reviews state the service was bad. Though it was slow, but I was patient.  I will be back, but not for a steak. And I hope the service will not be as reviewed by other reviewers. I was reimbursed by the manager for the bad steak."
BuzzElectric ..,"Chico, CA",0,18,5,5.0,9/22/2017,"Sorry to see you gone out of my repertoire.  I went to the online menu and realized you dropped your riblets.  Sorry again I won't be back. ////// Ok, so I've been told I'm wrong.  I've been told that Chico Applebees does have riblets and that I should call.  I just don't know how to order them online."
Lee N.,"Chico, CA",2,22,10,3.0,12/31/2016,My wife and i come here often but tonight was a bit disappointing we got the 2 for $20 deal. we both had the 3 cheese chicken cavatappi which came to us with 4 slices of chicken (we normally get 10 to 12 slices of chicken breast) and our chicken wonton tacos were cold.
Chris And April S.,"Chico, CA",0,57,13,1.0,1/10/2017,Ordered southwest steak salad and wonton tacos aswell as cheeseburger egg rolls ... the tacos had so little chicken it was unreal.  The steak salad was bland and five little tiny slices of steak  ... I asked if that was the correct amount of steak the waitress smiled as proudly said yes it is ...   the cheeseburger egg roll were the best part.  I won't be coming back.    No value.  Bad ....
Stephanie F.,"Bakersfield, CA",82,27,16,4.0,7/30/2016,"Came in with my family for the classic combo appetizer. The employees were nice and very attentive. The meal that we had was pretty good as well. Nothing was disappointing. The only downside was that the weather out side was about 107 degrees and the temperature inside the restaurant wasn't working very well so it was a little warm, but they did inform us of the situation and apologized for the inconvenience."
McKenzie B.,"Willows, CA",77,18,12,1.0,8/18/2017,"Worst place ever. I never usually picky when it comes to food but CLEANLINESS is a MUST! I came here with my boyfriend (we usually go to chilis but decided to give Applebee's a try). Big mistake. We were seated quickly and our food came out fast... but the plates and silverware were absolutely discussing. They looked as if they weren't even washed. I lifted my plate up to move it and it felt like there was grease all over the outside of the plate. Even felt what appeared to be someone's leftover food. At this point I lost my appetite. My boyfriend order was wrong. (Was corrected by the waitress). My Mac and cheese with chicken tasted bland. Mac and cheese from a box is better. Then when we were paying for our meal, $44 for 2 people 2 meals 2 drinks? I wouldn't  complain if my food was good and the plates and silverware were clean. Then when my boyfriend and I look at our receipt the order was completely different then what our order was. Sooooo my bf flags down the waitress, she said it's someone else's receipt and must have just been put on our table. But it was the same EXACT price as ours? For a completely different order. Mind you the receipt we originally got had multiple items. Ours 2 entree and 2 drinks. At this point I didn't care just wanted to leave. I spent $50 and my experience was terrible. I spend no more than $30 at chilis. Guess I will stick with Chilis :)"
Tricia C.,"Chico, CA",0,43,16,1.0,11/8/2016,"Hungry for a salad and it had been about 10 years since the last disappointing meal so decided to see if they've improved.  THEY HAVE NOT.  Service was just ok.  But the Asian salad was hardly edible.  If I haven't paid around $10 for it I'd have pushed it away.  Tasted like old, bagged salad mix you'd find at Winco.  Nope...won't be wasting our money here again.  Plus, there are lots of sketchy characters hanging around the street while I waited for my husband who was meeting me.    You'd get better food down at the Arco Station."
Cassondra C.,"Chico, CA",8,9,1,1.0,11/3/2016,If I could give 0 stars I would. For the price their food is mediocre and portion of the lunch combo is small for the price you pay. The service was poor and the guy that rang us up was incompetent. Never again will I go there.
ScottDeborah L.,"Roseville, CA",75,25,44,5.0,3/26/2016,"Stayed in Chico, CA overnight, looking for a restaurant that might be able to cook something soy free for me, as I have a severe soy allergy.  WoW... did we (husband and I) hit a home run with 'Patti' and her chef at the Chico Applebees.  They did everything they could to prepare a dinner for me that was totally Soy Free. They went out of their way to make sure that my husband and i had delicious meals.  Taking time out from all the regular orders they have to do for just 2 people who weren't even locals.  (((( That's dedication and compassion for their customers, and PRIDE in what they do. ))))"
Sam H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,16,,2.0,7/14/2017,"Came in on a Friday afternoon, not busy at all and still had the slowest bartender in the world. Nice guy but Jesus he is so slow we almost walked out."
Liv L.,"Redding, CA",0,11,4,1.0,10/29/2016,"Save yourself the headache and go to the Olive Garden or the in and out near by. I came in Saturday at 1015 for dinner with friends and waited about 5 minutes to be sat. After being seated our waitress promptly took our order and brought drinks. My complaint is not at all with our waitress who was busy but kind and attentive. My food came out with a curly blonde hair in it. Regardless of being comped the meal, the ick factor still overrides the hospitality. They offered to replace my dish but my appetite was DOA after the hair incident."
BART R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,28,,1.0,3/7/2016,"Complete garbage. From food (?) To service. Microwave food, probably prison rejected table scraps. I asked for some sarachi, bar man told the tween where to find it. She brings ""spicy lime mayo"" (:!  . Gross don't touch. Then bar man apologies(fine whatever). Asks if I want the sarachi I asked for...""but the tween said you where out?"" ...oh I get it she's a liar.(?)   Bill comes, just hand the guy my card...bills me 33$ for a shrimp salad and 1 beer. ""Whoa, bill my card back buddy, you brought the wrong tab.....thanks"".(gross ""food"") , not the end of the world. Then the bar man has to go to the manager. Miss Red Bluff 1964 stink eyes me, ""why the charge back!!?""  Because you not only sell me garbage you charge double for it and your ding dong lackies take the brunt.  I was nice and tipped. Can't wait to leave.  Do yourself a favor go and eat at the soup kitchen or the IHOP.  Cheaper and the staff won't lie to you, over charge you or act like they are doing you a Soilid by refunding the money you didn't spend."
Tami O.,"Manteca, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/29/2017,They treated us so rudely when we walked in. At our Applebees it is free seating in the bar area. We walked in and all the waiters and waitress were staring and talking about us. The waitress was so fake and rude. We left and she made a smartass comment.
Judy B.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/24/2016,"I'm actually not that picky about service. I had to ask for an iced-tea refill 3 times before it finally came. The rest of our order was a bit disorganized as well. But the best part was coming out to our car after lunch and seeing that another car had hit it and left without leaving a note. We were told by a neighboring business that this is fairly common in that Applebee's parking lot location, and they do not have video cameras, so its not a safe place to park. Over $5,000 in damage done in the middle of the day. Will never go back here again."
Tiffany L.,"Chico, CA",126,262,700,1.0,9/12/2015,"I have patronized this establishment  around 5-6 times by now. Before three days ago I would give 3 stars.  Husband and I came in on a Thursday evening. The hostess met us right away and was very nice. We sat in the bar area at a table. The waitress came by about 3-4 minutes later and took our drink order. Beers came quick and we drank them. Next time the waitress came by she took our order and we asked for 2 more beers. We effectively received the 2 beers. After that it's a mystery... we enjoyed our 2nd beers and thought our food would be coming soon... finished the beers and figured the food would be coming soon... no food. 45 minutes after our food order we had still not received any food and the husband had enough! We got up, went to the bartender, and paid for our beers. $25 for 4 beers, no food. The bartender profusely apologized but we just had to leave.  Moral of the story: don't come to Chico Applebees. The food is mediocre but the service sucks."
Denah G.,"Chico, CA",0,16,67,5.0,4/1/2016,"I've been here before..the 1st time was horrible, but in Feb I decided to give them another chance. I'm glad I did BC it was great! Today I stopped by again for lunch and had the same server as my previous visit. I fully enjoy the environment and welcome feeling I get while dining here. Garry makes this a great place to have lunch and watch a game on TV. Garry is very helpful and attentive to everyone. His charming attitude and smile makes for a great experience. I am definitely a future return customer!!!"
Dan B.,"Chico, CA",4,1,,1.0,2/17/2017,Love happy HR but food portions are small and just OK the service is fantastic the bartenders are real nice and good
Danielle N.,"Orland, CA",122,3,,1.0,8/16/2016,We were driving around late at night in Chico after I had gotten off a 12 hour shift at my Restaurant in Orland I had to come to Chico to get a few things and I was really hungry as I hadn't eaten all day my three-year-old daughter and my fiance were with me and we walked through the doors at 10:05 p.m. after Googling the fact that they were open till 11 p.m. and they turned us away 5 minutes after close not to mention there was a family of 5 before us that were pretty upset because they got shyed away too! Their food isn't even that hard to prepare and they could have budged in a couple people especially two families and made about a good almost $200 for their establishment. They're pretty inconsiderate and basically put their time before ours and that's not good business.
jeff M.,"Valencia, CA",9,61,17,1.0,8/8/2016,Service is non existent. You will be ignored and the food will be cold.  Really bad part of town where the chance of being mugged is high. Avoid at all cost
Bash d.,"Corning, CA",0,5,3,1.0,8/25/2015,I might ask ur self or better yet the customer If they want BACON on a salad Especially when they order FISH I had to throw the entire to go salad away because u ruined it Can I get a refund
Jillian R.,"Vacaville, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/14/2016,Well this would not be my pick of favorite Applebee's location!!!! I was very disappointed with how clean the restaurant was and how the food tasted. I don't eat the drive thru food but what was served tasted like something would have come in a bag.
Amanda E.,"Orland, CA",40,51,15,1.0,6/1/2016,If I could give 0 stars I would.. Worse customer service I have ever had in my life! We were there for an hour and 25 min and still haven't received our food.. But crazy that 3 tables around us that came after us got their food. We had to flag down a waitress to get drinks. Our one appetizer came after being there for an hour and was cold.. EVERY table around us had to ask for silverware after they got their food.. The manager was dressed horribly with holes in her clothes.. I will NEVER go back.. And to top it off it was for our daughters birthday!!
Kason S.,"Cottonwood, CA",22,10,,1.0,6/25/2016,"Waited an hour and a half from the time we ordered, food came and most of it wasn't hot. Waitress was nice and got us 5$ off our meals for waiting so long. But even then, the 6.50 I had to pay for semi warm 5 small chicken tenders and 6 onion rings still was not at all worth it."
Miranda S.,"Chico, CA",225,118,54,1.0,5/4/2015,"This is literally the closest thing you get to fast food with the ability to be served. My last experience was pretty good, the waitress was super perky and sweet. The food just sucks.  The servers are generally pretty fun people, which sucks because there's just no amount of good service that can make up for the just-out-of-the-freezer fatness that they pretend is edible ""food"". If you must order something other than beer, try the french onion soup. I'm sure every part of it is somehow frozen ten seconds before you eat it, but it's tasty and one of the only non-fried things on the menu.  For the record, the only acceptable times to go to Applebee's: when your 16 year old cousin first gets a job there, you're rude Uncle Bob gets you a gift card there (total dick move - consider selling GC online and cut your losses), your friends are so drunk they're too loud to be allowed on the street for more than five seconds, everywhere else in town is closed (not possible - Applebee's closes at.. what, 11?), or this is the last safe venue because even the zombies didn't want to dine there. Honestly.  TLDR: Go somewhere else."
