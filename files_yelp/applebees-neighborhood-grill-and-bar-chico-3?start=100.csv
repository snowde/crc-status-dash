Robert S.,"Shingletown, CA",97,31,28,1.0,6/20/2013,All the same. Eat at mom and pops venues. Better food.
Eric B.,"Chico, CA",5,5,,1.0,1/22/2013,"Over priced, small portions, mediocre food, overly nice and fake employees.  Thoroughly disappointed again! This place isnt even good when your drunk. Never again!"
Alisha R.,"Chico, CA",0,7,1,1.0,4/22/2014,Horrible food and service! My friend and I walked through the door and watched as 4 employees looked at us and walked right past. We stood and waited to be seated for 5 mins and they place had 5 booths occupied!! Do not waste ur time and go next door to another restaurant!
Opinionated O.,"Chico, CA",0,33,,2.0,11/29/2012,"Been there at different times and it's like the saying ""The difference between Night and Day""   The night time bartenders are friendly and nice place to go for some happy hour and half off appetizers specials when we have sat at the bar but when we want a full meal we prefer to sit in a booth.  Our waitress a month or so ago was very friendly but the food was a little slow to get to us although not to the point of having to make a complaint, although it was close. But it was $5 burger night and the place was pretty crowded.  The manager was very friendly asking how things were and to just let her know if there was anything she could get us just when we were about to say something our food arrived.  The manager seemed to be busy as she was going around asking other tables how they were doing so we passed on making a complaint to her.  And before we were done eating she came back by again asking how the meals were.  For the price of the burgers a good deal! During the day though the restaurant is almost a totally different experience.  Most recent visit about a week ago is what my rating is based on when the manager that day seemed to have ""Short Man Syndrome""  You know the type, full of attitude.  He was not very helpful when someone in our group had a problem with their meal and it was like we were BOTHERING HIM, but their food was undercooked from how it was ordered.  After the problem was fixed and the waitress brought the replacement meal (and she apologized) we expected the manager to come back by, but he never did.  He did stand by the bar glaring towards us talking to another guy for awhile so I'm sure he was bitching about us.   Day time, 2 Stars, max, due to the manager's piss-poor attitude.  Night time I'll give them 4 Stars, good food/drink deals.  Night time is the time for us from now on."
Amber D.,"Chico, CA",64,9,,2.0,1/7/2013,"Went for dinner and it was disappointing. Service was slow, the waitress was not interested in us, and focused all her attention on another table. My salad came after my food.... Food tasted good, but we were never offered additional drinks, or refills. When I asked for our check, she went to get it and 5 minutes later she was over singing happy birthday at another table. Another five goes by and she walked right past us then comes back and says Ohhhhh check. Then goes and gets it. Just wasn't my favorite night at applebees."
Mary M.,"Paradise, CA",0,9,2,1.0,1/2/2015,"Terrible service and so-so food.  The fries came out hard, cold and in edible.  Asked for new ones which the manger did bring.  Never got drink refills despite being charged 2.99 each soda.  Took over an hour and a half for a quick lunch.  Asked to speak with manager after getting charged a drink fir a kids meal and he was very defensive of their food and the waitress staying ""she's really busy"".  We will NEVER RETURN!!!"
Alice Z.,"San Francisco, CA",215,254,52,2.0,8/29/2010,"This Applebee's suck! And honestly, they need to hire more people because our waiter kept telling us that she was a ""one man person"" meaning she was running all these table by herself. Please hire more people if you can't perform good customer service! The food was pretty average. My friend's steak was ordered as medium rare and when it came, it was WELL DONE. And we had to complain and get it exchanged. Minus points! And I did NOT like how the food came. It was the 8 of us and the food came out between many different times. Like half our table got our food right away and then 30 minutes later the other half came, it was not good because by the time their food came out, we were already done with ours! BAD SERVICE! And they suck for not having the 2 for $20 deals on weekends. It doesn't even say that on the menu so wth!! This place was shitty and their service was bad! But regardless of that I should tell you guys that the artichoke dip from the sampler platter was pretty damn good, I was get that and it never disappoints me! But it was such a small serving that there were half the chips left over after the dip was gone, sad. The jalapeno burger was not that good. Didn't come with lettuce tomatoes or pickles. However the philly burger looked good too. The other food was not that great so not worth naming all of it, just know the good stuff !"
Timothy T.,"Chico, CA",11,66,18,2.0,7/2/2010,"Really not that impressive.   The staff is hit and miss.  Some of the staff is friendly,  but most seem like they could care less and your presence is bothersome.  Others dining there with me have picked up on that vibe as well.  Seems like a typical low wage/high turnover environment.   I often get food to go from this Applebee's and several times I have either received something other than what I ordered, or some of what I ordered was not even given to me.     I typically order the same thing and it is prepared differently every time.  I used to enjoy their wings but they changed something about them and they are no longer even edible.  Most portions are small for the money charged. Closes at 10 PM Sunday through Thursday???   It really is too bad that this Applebee's is so sucky.  I've been to many Applebee's that are more than acceptable.  My suggestion is to tear down this Applebee's and put in a TGIFridays."
Daniel M.,"Chico, CA",8,20,10,5.0,10/16/2012,I have been coming here for quite some time.  I read others reviews and I have not had a bad experience.  I usually go in the evening and the service is always great and the employees/bartenders are very attentative.  Definitely one of my favorite places to go with friends after work
Joe D.,"Anaheim, CA",0,12,2,5.0,3/4/2015,"Mark Sab, thank you for your help and providing exceptional service for our table."
Jessica M.,"Magalia, CA",26,7,,1.0,9/1/2012,"Went to this Applebee's on Aug. 30, 2012.  It was the second time we tried going to this place - the first time we went over a year ago, we stood there while the hostess and wait staff watched us stand there as they walked by, doing whatever they were doing.  After waiting 15 minutes to even get seated in a 3/4 empty restaurant, we left!  We should have never returned.  This time around, we got seated but it took them 10 minutes to even give us water.  Another 20 minutes later, we had a semi-decent appetizer but the food just went downhill from there.  It didn't even LOOK good.  There is something very wrong with the staff out front and the cooking staff in the back.  I will never go there again and will steer everyone I know away from ever going there.  Chico has way too many good restaurants to waste time, money and calories at this place!"
Mike B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,34,,2.0,9/23/2013,"This place is hit and miss. The food is not too pricey, but most times appetizers will be cold and entrees will be bland. The service is sometimes bad too. We once had a waitress completely ignore us and it ruined our night. I have not been here for a while and see no reason to go back."
Lo P.,"Chico, CA",9,55,40,1.0,8/20/2014,"The servers are nice, but service is always slow. The servers are consistently inattentive and they seem indifferent towards their customers and their customers needs. Food lacks flavor, and presentation of food is done poorly. You gotta wait so long for your food to come out, you'd think you were patiently waiting for a well-prepared and satisfying meal but you end up with nothing but a huge entree of disappointment and regret. You definitely don't get what you pay for at Applebee's. I seriously don't understand why they're so slow over here, it's not like you make your own cheese and other ingredients in house or slaughter the cow in store before it becomes a steak! I just don't get it!"
Mark D.,"Elk Grove, CA",4,20,,2.0,5/14/2012,Food was ok..... 4 out of 5 people's items were wrong. Waitress was nice. Manger was good but something happened with the cooks. The whole meal was comped.
Becca W.,"Marysville, CA",0,7,,2.0,9/8/2015,"I don't know if they were busier then usual or understaffed, but nothing seemed to go right with our dinner.  Our server was very nice, but I think she had too many table to be attentive to us.  Our salads came before the appetizer.  One was the wrong salad.  The other didn't get the dressing on the side as requested.  We had no silverware.  When the appetizer came, we were not given small plates with it, until we requested them, then it was almost gone by the time we received them.  We requested one of the 3 garnishes be left off one of the pasta dinners, but all 3 were left of.  The two pasta meals were barely warm, with some spots of cold pasta.  We didn't receive the bread with the 2 pasta orders.  When we received our bill, we were charged for an order of fries we never received and for an extra salad, both of which were taken off the menu when we brought it to their attention.  Then another table next to us ended up with our bill.  Just not the best experience, but like I said earlier, they did seem very busy so maybe this isn't how it usually is.  Don't think I'd go back though and take the chance."
Jake S.,"Chico, CA",13,9,4,2.0,9/14/2013,"We walked in and about half of the restaurant was open. One of the benefits if eating out at 5pm for a change.  We were sat promptly and then left at our table for what felt like an eternity.  I checked to make sure I put deodorant on and I had, thinking maybe the wait staff was avoiding us. My wife and I are full sized Americans so its not like we were invisible. Deciding on what to order was quite easy as we had time to memorize the entire menu. We also had time to test each other's knowledge, my wife got 100 percent,  I got a 98 percent because we were waiting so long I had time to forget some of the items. The manager was nice enough to say how's it going while jogging by and not making eye contact. Finally after 15 or so minutes, and three more tables were sat I decided to ask the hostess if there were any waiters in my section. A few minutes later a man briefly appeared to take our drink order and disappeared moments later. We've now placed our order and I imagine I will have enough time to proofread this, and crochet the words on a handkerchief.  Long story short. Poorly managed restaurant."
Lindsay M.,"Chico, CA",0,10,,1.0,7/16/2014,"I usually I love Applebee's, but lately they've been slacking.  The last few times I've been with friends, someone has had a hair in their food, or a bug or dirt in their glass.  The service is pretty slow when it comes to getting a refill or a side sauce.  I went the other night, and the poor manager stopped by to see how things were and my table unloaded a huge order or refills and sides they needed, that they had originally asked the server to get 15 min prior.  you can tell sometimes that the food has been sitting way to long in the hot window ready to be taken out.  All in all I used to love the environment and food, but I think I'd prefer to spend a couple dollars more and go to Chili's across the street."
M S.,"Paradise, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/1/2014,"The owners/manager need to please wake up and smell the roses!  I have always loved Applebee's, but today in Chico was my last.  First impression dead dried flower pots out front, flies around my table, dirty windows and sticky seats. Ordered Chicken Tacos just to be told they were out, ordered a burger instead.  What we got was a greasy bun and the tomatoes had the hard ugly core. Wake up guys."
Milan R.,"Chico, CA",107,89,23,1.0,4/21/2009,"Nasty. The once mighty ""neighborhood grill"" has fallen. These places used to be decent for grabbing a bite to eat with some friends. Packed all day long. Now, just a ghost of the past. Poor service, terrible food unless your conscious will allow you to eat all you can eat frozen chicken fingers. Celebrity chef Tyler Florance kills all he touches. The last time I was in the place smelled like it had been cleaned with urinal cakes."
Joe B.,"Chico, CA",80,12,,1.0,3/13/2011,"Don't bother wasting your time here. Have given it a fair chance and repeatedly had hair in my food, terrible service, over-cooked steak. I will not go back. Would give 0 stars if it was possible."
