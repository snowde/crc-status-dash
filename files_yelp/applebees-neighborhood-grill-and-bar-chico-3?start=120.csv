Jamie M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",226,11,,1.0,4/16/2014,"I have been here twice and both times I had awful service. I am not picking on this Applebee's alone, the others I have been to have been exactly the same and my mom has complained about Applebee's service as well. My boyfriend and I went last night because we had a coupon for $5 off $25. We were seated right away and they took our drink order right away. It took about 5 minutes to get our drinks because the waitress stood there talking to the bartender while she waited for him to open a beer. It took a very long time to open that beer. She then took our order and both of us ordered a salad as an app. She told us our salads would be out shortly and before our entrees. About 15 minutes later, a different waiter brought our entrees out. I told him that the waitress had said we would get our salads first and he looked very embarrassed and said, ""you should have gotten them first."" He was nice about it but I didn't get why he asked if we still wanted them unless he was planning on giving us a discount. So then we waited another 5 minutes for our salads. Finally we were able to eat our meal and I kept seeing our waitress walk by. Not once did she ask how our food is. She even brought my boyfriend a refill, placed it on the table as she walked by. She grunted when he said thank you as she kept walking. Finally, when we had finished our food, she came and asked how it was. It WAS good. Both times that my boyfriend and I have gone to this Applebee's we have sat in the same place, just two tables apart. Both times the long table next to us was covered in empty glasses, filthy plates, and fry baskets. And throughout our meal we watched our waitress take empty baskets and glasses from other people's tables and literally slam them on the long table. I saw the manager go and try to clean it up but that is not his job so he couldn't clean the whole thing. My boyfriend did not want to tip the waitress at all but I made him give her $3.50 because she was nice and quick at the beginning. All of this just makes me want to work at an Applebee's so that I can clean up the reputation."
Dave S.,"Oroville, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/20/2014,Our food was served at room temperature.  it seemed like they forgot the order was ready.Grrrr.
Chase W.,"Chico, CA",16,30,,1.0,4/1/2013,I 'LOL' that people still eat here...  I've gone a few times and the food has always tasted like it was frozen ten minutes ago and they just microwaved it.  Service is 'meh'.  Skip this place
Sabrina C.,"Butte, CA",20,60,3,1.0,3/14/2011,"Like other reviewers have said, this place is truly terrible. When you combine inedible food with bad service, you get a warranted one star. I wish I could give this Applebee's a no-star! I have tried to give this so many tries, and every dish I have ever ordered has been so terrible that I am upset that I wasted the money. The last time I gave them another chance, I got a salad (trying to play it safe after having so many burnt burgers sent back), but it was so terrible!!! A handful of browned iceberg lettuce with six cold, flavorless shrimp pieces with some striped burn marks. This salad could have been bearable had the dressing been decent. Applebee's salad dressing tastes like something that could be found at a Jesus Center. This meal cost me $12 with tip. EEeek. Applebee's has become the Chuck E Cheese's of seriously low-end food chains. At least Chuck E Cheese's has games. Avoid Applebee's like the plague!"
Christina S.,"Chico, CA",0,6,,2.0,12/1/2013,"My boyfriend and I had just finished watching a movie for a date and decided that since I had a $15 gift card that Applebees would be fun. I was wrong. The guy at the front placed us at a table seat and didn't ask if we wanted a booth or a table. A few minutes later, the same guy placed a family of eight directly next to us. My boyfriend and I wanted to move and we had to wait a while before we received our drinks and so that we could ask to move. When our waiter returned I told him that we were on a date and would like to move. He had no problem with that but once we moved we had to wait even longer for our drinks to get refilled. The place was not that busy for a Saturday night and there was no reason for us to wait. Eventually our food came but we had no silverware. The waiter kept saying out loud that he would bring it to us and kept forgetting. My boyfriend and I looked around to steal one at a table but there was none to be found. I had to ask the waiter again for silverware. By the time we got it our food was cold, or maybe it was cold already. My boyfriend and I really like Applebees because the food is good and the service usually is too. But, this time Applebees didn't plan a Saturday night very well with only have three waiters on staff. We won't be going back for a while because they need to get their act together. Oh and another thing,  I was unsure about how late Applebees is open so I called to ask the woman on the phone responded ""Midnight, like always."" If I was from another country or was visiting Chico, speaking to someone with that attitude would prevent me from dining there."
Jeff C.,"Chico, CA",0,35,2,1.0,8/7/2013,"This review is a few weeks over due.  I ordered a take out meal.  I backed in to the reserved parking and the server was headed out the door with my meal.  I paid cash and was on my way.  Once I got home I discovered that my order was incomplete.  Besides the missing salad my med-rare steak was indeed pink in the center.  However it was also pink all the way to one edge.  It had been seared on the surface in a stamp like manner (less than 1/32"" cooked) and appeared raw the the edge when cut.  Not a big deal unless you realize the importance of cooking meat to kill bacteria.  In the butchering process bacteria can and routinely does penetrate red meat, but it does not travel deep into the meat.  When cooking you want to make sure and flip your meat and cook from both sides.  So point being not only was my meal shorted, but i had to cook the steak if I wanted to eat it safely.  I called frustrated and complained, but I wasn't about to drive back over there to get my salad.  Given previous questionable service at this location I came to the conclusion they really just don't want my business.  It is a shame, because I like their menu when proper prepared and I live close by, but there are many choices in walking distance and not worth me taking a chance there again."
