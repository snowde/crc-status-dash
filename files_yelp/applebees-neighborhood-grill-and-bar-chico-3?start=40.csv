Carly P.,"Palo Cedro, CA",3,21,12,1.0,4/30/2016,"We had terrible service, our waiter left us sitting 45 min and forgot to put our order in.  While we were waiting a bummed walked in and management allowed him to announce he is mentally ill then proceed to walk around tables collect cash for the ""45 dollars he needed for a greyhound ticket.""  It was so awkward!  Not to mention the faint smell of sewer in the air and the hair in my husbands food.  Never again Applebee's, never again!!!"
Richard S.,"Oroville, CA",21,25,2,1.0,2/24/2016,"Bad night for Applebees in Chico.  We were offered a small table because of the assurance the service would be faster and it wasn't.  The food took a very long time to arrive and then it wasn't cooked enough at all.  The steak was raw and cold inside when I received it.  I sent it back asking them to cook it more.  It came back still raw.  I actually ate only my potatoes and veggies and left the steak.  I've like Applebees, at least in other areas, but the management here is horrible."
Stephanie T.,"Chico, CA",44,6,,1.0,5/22/2016,Food took forever and was such a small portion I left hungry. Server never came to check how things were or refill drinks. Things have really gone downhill. Won't be returning til there's a big change. I used to love Applebees.
Jan R.,"Chico, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/14/2015,"Warning against going here if you have an allergy! Really bad experience, son is allergic to peanuts, asked the server when we first walked in, seemed it was fine. After a 35 minute wait for food, his food was still not done, so I asked the server if the French fries were okay. The server then states she has a list of foods that may contain peanuts or may have come in contact with peanuts . Well basically the entire menu including the dish he had ordered was even on the list. Dangerous experience, would figure in this day an age of caloric content and ingredients being listed, it would have a trickle down effect too the manager and servers. Son wants he mentioned every dish on the kids menu is on the list."
Melody B.,"Chico, CA",0,6,1,2.0,5/9/2016,"Ive been going to Apple bees for years, and they've totally gone down hill, their menu was okay but not a big selection, the food was very bland and the bathroom had no soap or paper towels... Definitely wont go there again I gave it two stars because the wait staff was okay, nothing special though."
Paul A.,"Foresthill, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/28/2015,Only one star because I can't give zero Gross gross gross The filthiest  restaurant I have walked into in a long time. We were the 1st costumers in at 11am and the 1st thing you see is hand prints all over the glass as you enter look down and the door mat is dirty as we walk to our booth the carpet hasn't been vacuumed and has crap all over toothpicks paper etc look out the window it's dirty too. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup 10 min later it's cold open the silverware dirty we walked out.
Laura F.,"Chico, CA",9,17,,1.0,12/27/2014,"We came here for dinner on Christmas Eve.  Our server, Luke Skywalker (that's what his nametag said) was attentive and pleasant.   I ordered the Shrimp Broccoli Cavatappi; it was WAY over salted and over peppered.  I couldn't eat it and had to send it back.  The next thing I ordered was the Thai Shrimp Salad, but it tasted like the same over salted shrimp and I couldn't eat that, either. My husband ordered the Ribeye Steak.  He asked for medium rare, and it came out WELL DONE.  Not only that, it was hardly seasoned at all.  I told him it looked like it had been boiled.   Thank God we ordered the Pretzels and Beer Cheese Dip beforehand with Patron margaritas...those were awesome.   We won't go back to Applebees.  With the amazing choices for dining in Chico, why would we?"
Mia H.,"Chico, CA",0,11,1,1.0,4/19/2016,"Service here has been getting worst. However this time our service was good this time  the food was horrible!!! everything was cold! shrimp, fries, wings, my kids meals everything! and it took almost 45mins to get our food. we will definitely not be coming back!!"
Ron W.,"San Jose, CA",10,4,2,2.0,3/6/2016,"I can't believe how slow this place was tonight , it wasn't that they were over busy either , it seems they need more workers or something tables were not cleared off and cleaned quickly, food took forever to reach our table and then to get a refill of water took a very long long time . Don't know what has went wrong with this Chico Applebee's but I know the once great place to eat has slipped down to a maybe I'll give them another chance to get it together 6 months or more from now .Lastly I know of a few others that haven't been as  happy  either as of lately ,and I hope they get their acts together soon cause this used to be a great and fun place to eat with good prices and good food"
Austin V.,"Livermore, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/12/2015,"Writing this review as my party & I are sitting here waiting on our drinks its been over a half hour the place isn't even half full, asked a server to find ""Max"" who was waiting our table, he comes back to inform us we need to be patient as he is ""being seriously over worked and can't handle more than one task at a time forgets our silverware as well, attitude was crap acted like he was to cool to be here, complete douche will not be back because of him, still waiting for that pepsi..."
Jes X.,"Chico, CA",25,4,4,1.0,3/8/2016,"I've gone to Applebee's twice before this evening, but tonight was really horrible. The waitress was really nice and sincere, but we arrived and had to wait for 20 minutes till we got our drinks and nearly an hour for food. When the food came out it was not even warm for us to eat. The rice on the fiesta lime chicken was really hard and didn't even seemed cooked, while the 4-cheese Mac and cheese was cold and the oil had started to already get dry. After tonight, I don't think I will be going back to Applebee's for a while. It wasn't even that busy, even the ladies next to us were asking if we had gotten our food yet and it was over an hour already. Sorry Applebee's, but it was that bad."
Anjanette S.,"Chico, CA",82,88,305,5.0,12/17/2014,"Christmas shopping break...the wait staff was great & the place was packed but they didn't show any stress...Tyler, a Mgr on duty was very friendly our waiter Michael was very attentive as well. Food was great even though mine came out about 5 min after everyone else...but it was sizzling hot."
Sam S.,"Chico, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/12/2015,This is one of thee worst Applebee's I've ever been to. The service is good and the environment is good.. But the cooking and drinks are just plain bad. I got a margarita that tasted awful and the shrimp and spinach salad. The salad had so much pepper in it I could not eat half of it. My boyfriend got a very under cooked hamburger. Over all I'm just mad and still very hungry 30$ later.
Tim W.,"Chico, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/22/2016,"This place has gone down hill big time.  Tried to order my wife a vodka cranberry, after listing 3 different vodkas and being told they where all out. (Stoli, Titos, Grey Goose) Then asked for a Pinot Grigio and guess what, they where out of that as well.  We didn't need to ask any further, it was time to go."
Peter T.,"San Diego, CA",302,835,382,3.0,3/5/2013,"It is what it is. Its open late, there's plenty of seating, prices are fair. food tastes like good microwavable meals, but their appetizers and drinks pair well together."
Pam L.,"Chico, CA",5,6,8,1.0,3/19/2016,"Today we took our son out for his Birthday dinner.  Applebee's was his choice!  The really sad thing was the whole ordeal was horrific from start to end.  It was not busy at all. There were 5 of us, but no table available sat for a few were seated at a soaking wet table and seats yes we got wet pants.  Then they didn't bring our drinks we ordered and forgot what we ordered. Took our order messed it up.  Didn't bring our appetizers. After at least 30+ minutes here comes one salad. Still no appetizets?  Finally walked up to speak to manager no food no appetizers not busy?  Food finally came  crispy brewhouse chicken over cooked and rock hard, ribs rock hard cold and couldn't tear them apart with 2 hands. Nothing hot nothing even remotely tastey.  When we were getting up to leave.  They finally came with the birthday sunday to sing as we were leaving.  All I can say as a manager is way to drop the ball applebees if you continue this kind of horrible service and horrible food you may be closing your doors real soon or maybe not soon enough."
Rachael C.,"Chico, CA",6,64,12,1.0,5/17/2014,"No more chances Applebee's, This place does suck!! The waiter proceeded to give us about 5 minutes after sitting down to see if we were ready to order, which is no time at all! Then when I asked if we could order an appetizer he said, ""sure, we love when people order food around here"", the hell?  The food wasn't good at all so we just ate a little bit of it and brought it home. Later on my boyfriend and I went out and got pretty intoxicated and had the drunken munchies and decided to eat the leftovers, having nothing else to snack on.    Now I fully understand why they had offered us so much liquor the last time we went here and I reviewed them...because the food tasted sooo good, I couldn't believe it, but then I realized how drunk I was. Please don't give this establishment anymore business, not worth the money or time."
Andrea P.,"Susanville, CA",53,35,33,2.0,9/9/2014,"The food was alright, but it was warm by the time it got to us. There was just enough on the plate to fill up a sami-hungry individual. The waitress was attentive only because she was friends with a girl at our table. The drinks take so long to get to us, you're dying of thirst by the time they finally get to you."
Robby L.,"Lakewood, WA",7,3,,1.0,6/16/2015,"By far the worst Applebee's I've ever been to, slow service and they forget about their customers"
BigMike D.,"Chico, CA",147,5,,1.0,6/16/2015,"Very bad service.  Manager didn't know what was going on around him. Took forever to get a drink let alone our appetizers,  2nd bad experience in a row don't think I will come back,."
