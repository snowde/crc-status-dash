Vanessa S.,"Citrus Heights, CA",6,3,,1.0,3/20/2016,"Never have had a problem with this location before, but after tonight we won't be back. I ordered the sampler appetizer as my meal and my husband ordered a burger, no big deal. My French onion soup came with just bread and cheese in the bowl and no actual soup so there was send back number 1. My husband took a bite of his burger and out came a cheese wrapper that the cook conveniently forgot on the cheese while cooking..send back number 2. They remade the burger and we received it well after I was finished eating and the top bun was as hard as a hockey puck and black...send back number 3. We did not pay for the burger because by the time it was edible it was cold and I refused. There were tables around us that had just as many issues. Our waitress Monica V was very sweet and I feel embarrassed for her since she worked hard to keep us happy and the cooks continued to screw up orders. All I hope is that the manager seriously rethinks who she keeps as her kitchen staff after a night like tonight! The restaurant was filthy, bathrooms were disgusting, and service was very slow, I would be embarrassed if I was the manager there tonight."
Marcus A.,"Pleasanton, CA",33,39,8,4.0,6/5/2015,"Came with a big party, this is only for mine. Ordered the Thai shrimp salad it was good but had a bit to much dressing. Service was adequate as well!"
Lisa N.,"Vacaville, CA",42,33,45,5.0,7/8/2015,"After husband and his partner worked all day, walked across the street to enjoy dinner & a few beers.  We decided. We decided to sit at the bar...glad we did. Taylor was FANTASTIC,  very attentive & very friendly to all. When she saw that a table away from the bar was not being helped,  she went right over to take their order:)  I hope they realize what a very valuable employee they have in her! Thanks Taylor!"
Luis P.,"Temecula, CA",8,252,20,3.0,3/23/2016,"Applebee's in Chico, CA, was at best, average. What saved them in my opinion was the tacos they serve as appetizer, because the were crunchy yet soft, and they had a sophisticated taste with a hint of Asian cuisine. Our party of 4, two amazing ladies, one great 8 year old boy, and yours truly selected the 2 for $20, and the also available, 2 for $25. Also a Cookies and Cream milkshake for the kid, who as unlikely as it may seem, voiced his displeasure after the first sip, and was sent back, and replaced by favorite soda. The funny thing was that he loves that particular shake. Coffee for the other 3 was bland and lukewarm.  Food was average tasting, not terribly bad, not very good. Our server was a nice young lady, a little slow for appearances, but personable and courteous. It seems this franchise misses more times that hits the satisfaction target, not only in Chico, but in a lot of locations. 3 Stars."
Kim L.,"Chico, CA",112,13,2,2.0,9/26/2015,"I used to love Applebees but the last 3 or 4 times I came I haven't been impressed. The food has progressively gone down hill as has the service. A couple of weeks ago my mom, friend and myself went to Applebees for lunch and stood at the hostess desk for a couple of minutes before we saw her come out from the back and walk over to us. First off she just looked dirty, her clothes were sloppy and her hair looked unkept. Not to mention her little attitude. She informed us it would be a couple minutes for our table (even though there were maybe 5 other small groups in the whole place.) We all ended up looking at each other and decided to leave and eat somewhere else. Not sure I'll be back any time soon."
Riley L.,"Chico, CA",12,16,,1.0,12/18/2013,"Too bad you can't give some type of negative rating. I wasn't sure if I was just the only one experiencing bad customer service from here, but the entire first page of reviews are full of negative reviews. It's usually a friend's choice to dine at Applebee's. I hate going there because: 1) The servers are TERRIBLE. They do not check on your table and they are not very friendly. Most of them walk around with scowls on their faces and when you put in a special request for your food or tell them something is wrong with your food they get snappy. Sorry for making you do your job girls! Don't like it? Get out of food service. 2) There is ALWAYS something wrong with my food, not to mention it's a long wait just to get it. I waited 30 minutes just for an appetizer and soup. Lo and behold, my entree was out about 5 minutes later so my table was over crowded with food. My appetizer came out cold and I had to send it back. About 15 minutes later the waitress stops by and asks me if I have gotten my appetizer yet which is clearly not on the table. It comes back out COLD AGAIN.  I complained to the manager who handled the situation professionally and discounted my meal and offered a free dessert. I declined the dessert because I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes just for that to come out.  Next time a friend wants to go to Applebee's I'm going to have to respectfully decline. I'm so over the terrible service and the crappy food."
Devious H.,"Chico, CA",458,56,41,3.0,10/18/2015,Food tastes good. Just dont think about how they just microwaved half of it. I feel like i have had more wrong orders here than anywhere else over the years. To be fair I have eaten here atleast 40 times . Sometimes the service is good sometimes bad. Why do i go back? What else besides dennys is open this late? My broccoli looked brownish red on the ends last night. Nuked well done?.. yet i ate it anyways .. shocking?
Chester R.,"Chico, CA",0,6,,4.0,4/4/2015,"Good food, amazed by the Perfect Margaritas!! Service was okay, server forgot my water after asking twice. Not bad, it is applebess..."
Casey V.,"Chico, CA",0,17,21,1.0,3/25/2015,Medocure food at best and the waiting staff isn't very attentive. Had to ask another waitress for our sodas when our Appetizers came out because we still hadn't gotten them. Honestly if so go to chili's instead.
Katie M.,"Chico, CA",2,7,2,3.0,5/29/2015,"The service is usually pretty great but my food has been frozen in the middle, twice."
Danielle V.,"Chico, CA",16,72,27,4.0,3/14/2015,"My husband and I went in for happy hour tonight. We heard there was recently a change in management and you could really tell tonight (for the better). Jessica was our server and was very attentive and super friendly. She never forgot about us (as we experienced in past visits by other servers) and checked in regularly. Our ticket time was decent,  much better than previous visits. Drinks were good and the atmosphere was bubbly. Vast improvement from our previous 5 visits HANDS DOWN."
AdriannaRose R.,"Chico, CA",1,23,1,1.0,11/23/2014,If I could give this place zero stars I would. 15 minutes after being seated someone came to take our drink order. Another 15 minutes had passed and my fiancée corona still hadn't made it to the table. Finally our waiter comes to our table and acknowledges that my fiancé has ordered a corona and even after that it still did not arrive. This is a similar situation to what happened on our last visit except last time they lost our order and forgot about us for an hour. It's safe to say I'm done with Chico Applebee's..
Laura B.,"Roseville, CA",12,25,3,1.0,3/23/2015,"First off, we pulled in and could have lost a tire in the crater sized pot hole you have to drive around to get to the parking spaces. We walked in around lunchtime, it was dead. Our first sign to turn around and run away. We got seated and immediately noticed the table was sticky, but it's not a sticky that can be wiped away.... it was more of a permanent old sticky that only could be remedied by replacing the old table with a new one. My son ordered an apple juice and the server brought orange juice instead. As we sat there looking over the menus, we couldn't help but notice the stench of grease and lack of cleanliness. We told the server we were going to leave and go somewhere else. We walked out and will never ever return. Gross."
O S.,"Chico, CA",0,152,41,1.0,3/23/2015,"Just terrible. Came on a Sunday night late and still had terrible service. Waited over ten minutes just to have our waiter finally come n ask us what we wanna drink, then waited another ten or so minutes for him to bring our WATERS. Me and my mom ordered and waited another half hour for our food. When our food arrived we had to ask for napkins and silverware and the food was just thrown together and not appetizing. I had the oriental chicken roll up and that's always been my favorite here...this time I didn't even take my left overs. It was straight gross in every way and they did not get a tip I am not coming back n I've lived here for over 20 years so whatever Applebees get it together you use to actually be good."
Robert C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,61,33,1.0,3/14/2015,"Don't go. Zero rating because they are not doing anything to get up from two stars. Mostly empty store. Very slow kitchen. Server was fine! We cautioned we had diner with Peanut allergy. Ordered cheese pizzia. Sandwiches with fries.  When food arrived we asked if any peanut oil was used cooking. A list was produced. Seems everything on menu could be contaminated!? Asked for check. They took off the pizzia from the bill, added a salad that wasn't ordered or delivered. This store needs help. I do not know what happened here today. Won't be back. APPLEBEE'S BRAND is better than this. Does this indicate bankruptcy like Marie Calanders One wonders"
Meghan D.,"Oakley, CA",5,55,26,1.0,10/24/2014,"Food was really good but the reason I am giving a 1 star is because I was sitting at the bar tables & watch one of the waiters (big muscular guy with a beer belly, who flirted & harassed the other waitresses his entire time I was in) take a large shot of alcohol while he was working....that is never okay. You should be fired."
Jessica M.,"Chico, CA",20,12,,1.0,3/24/2015,I used to enjoy coming here for dinner with family but the service has gone down in the food is almost Not eatable!
Allison H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",170,2,,5.0,5/15/2015,"The food here is really typical of what you would expect from Applebee's, but one of the things that stuck out to me the most was the service. Our server's name was Catherine, and she was outgoing, friendly, sweet, and very attentive to our order. She paid attention to us, and made us feel like we were really valued as customers. If we finished a drink, she would give us a refill without us asking, and she was very attentive."
Joshua B.,"Morro Bay, CA",8,66,149,2.0,11/2/2014,"This location doesn't offer online ordering so I proceeded to try to call and the phone kept ringing for 20 minutes so decided to walk across the street from our hotel to order to go. They looked around at each other, no one to greet at the door like my local Applebee's and there was trashy tables and trash on the floors by the hostess stand (not appealing welcome). When I was finally directed to who I could order takeout, he seemed very helpful and apologetic. I was told it was 10-15 minutes. After that it was nice that as I sat and waited several people checked on me to see if I needed anything. Receipt said pickup time 405. At 410 a young an came and told me they were boxing up my food. At 420 I was told it was another minute. At 422 I finally got my food 32 minutes after I walked in and ordered it. People came into sit at the bar after I ordered my To-go order, and get their food prior to me even getting mine. The only saving grace was even for it being take out, it tastes good, was made exactly as my special requests and was good temperature. But very disorganized, dis shelved unappealing atmosphere, glad this isn't my local applebees otherwise I would stop coming."
A C.,"Chico, CA",65,20,7,1.0,11/26/2014,"I always have a problem with car-side togo. The order takers always seem to be very annoyed and hurried so they misunderstand what i am saying leading to their horrible tone. I called early this morning and asked if we can order the 1/2 off appetizers through carside. The girl who answered (nicely) was like ya sure we can do that. So i said i would call back at lunch. When I call some guy answered and hes talking so fast and mumbling not listening to me when I said i wanted to do 2 separate orders, and just going ok ok. So as i am reading off my first order and finish hes like oh i rang those all separately! I was like no that's one order and i have another but he never listened. Then I ask about the discount when he tells me my full price total and i explained how I called earlier. He replied i dont think so (rudely) and said he can grab a manager. When he gets back on the phone ""He said he would give you some sort of discount but not the half off"", ok then i can just go in and eat if its a big deal and he rudely replied so you dont want it? No ill just come in and eat, but you're still gonna get some kind of discount, but i reply no its ok well just go in and then again he goes so cancel it you're still getting a discount just not the 50%. So annoying, I already said never mind cancel once. Why would I not just go in and eat for the full 50%? I was just trying to make our lunch at work more convenient but he was so rude, annoying, and a horrible listener!  CAR-SIDE SUCKS!"
