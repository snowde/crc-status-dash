Maria A.,"Brownsburg, IN",3,285,72,2.0,9/6/2014,"Food was ok... Server (Tyler L.) was totally checked out.  No refills on our drinks.. Never saw her again after the food came. Guess, we should be glad we got our food before she disappeared."
Courtney I.,"Chico, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/23/2016,"If I could give no stars for tonight's experience I would.   My husband and I spent some trying to come up with a positive note for the evening and the most positive was...  The men's restroom had soap.  Yep btw it did not have hot water.   The food was awful, from our appetizer to our meals.   The Onion rings where so hard I could not bite threw them. When our meals arrived we had been there for over an hr.   The meat was overlooked and swimming in grease. The French fries where cold and hard our burgers where not as ordered.   Go someplace else.   You will have a better meal anywhere."
Carl Z.,"Chico, CA",15,54,,1.0,8/9/2015,"I have been going to this location for years, now that the all the good management staff is gone the place has really taken a dive. Food is bad, service isn't great unless you get one of the couple good wait staffers. Totally not worth wasting your hard earned money here..."
Erica G.,"Chico, CA",9,149,70,4.0,10/18/2014,"Their food is a lot better than it used to be. They had a menu overhaul, and now I can say the food earns a 4 star. They have great kids meals too."
Olin S.,"Northern, CA",300,639,311,4.0,9/3/2010,"The best thing about this applebees is the service. I have been here 7+ x's and the service has always been good. The food is typical applebee's food, 3 star. Their deserts i will say are just about 4 star."
Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",67,382,737,4.0,3/12/2013,"We have always had good service and good food here at this locations. My husband and I usally have a ""Date Night"" and sit at the bar where the Bartender (Jessie ) usally takes care of us. The new Manger- Micheal is doing a great job.. We had some wings that were not good and he made it right.. We dine here often and enjoy the service and staff.."
Blakeley B.,"Santa Barbara, CA",134,23,41,2.0,7/30/2014,"The waitress kept forgetting our drinks, well mine and was sure that my boyfriend had whatever he wanted. She brought two of the same but wrong drinks and was all o well no you have those also. The food was nothing special and super dried out. When we got the bill she charged us for the drinks we ordered plus the two others she messed up on. We left and figured her tip went to cover the drinks."
Trish B.,"Corning, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/8/2014,"My husband and I came here one night and had really bad service. They mixed up our order and forgot to get our drinks. Then have us the bill, still without getting our other drink. The manager took quit a bit of the bill and gave us 15% off to come back. After the races we came here for dinner. Once again worst service. At least they got our order right. And the food was good. The waiter brought us the bill and walked away. Not even asking if I would like a box to take the rest of my food home. She didn't check on us at all besides bringing the food and the check. Maybe look into waiters that aren't all about the two guys sitting three tables down."
Rosa S.,"Gridley, CA",0,22,11,1.0,10/4/2015,"I don't know why, but every time we come here the place is shit. Not necessarily the food, but the service. We go in and there is never a hostess at the door, so we wait, ""lost"", for about 5 minutes (I swear!) This time the waitress/hostess, whatever she was, called us over to a booth she was wiping down, and sits us there, on a wet booth. Like wtf?? I saved my attitude to bring this to Yelp of course. Having my son with me, he obviously looks 2, but we never get offered a high chair or booster seat. It's fine, I'm taking it all to Yelp... Food is ok and fast, our waiter was a nice young man. Attentive and friendly. But the women's bathroom were filthy, paper towels everywhere! Moral of the story, I'd fire your hostess."
Luis Y.,"Hayward, CA",86,13,6,4.0,4/14/2014,Sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive.  This place seems to have negative reviews but I had a good experience here.
Allison S.,"Chico, CA",10,29,5,1.0,5/26/2014,The server did not care about our needs at all. We had to walk up to the bar tender to get our own water and waited over 15 minutes for the waitress to take our check. Our spinach artichoke dip was only about a scoop. Not impressed at all with this Applebee's.
Linda R.,"Chester, CA",1,2,,1.0,9/7/2013,"Lunch at Applebee's today was a 2 1/2 hour waste of my time. Eight of us went for lunch and did not get served for 1 1/2 hours. When the food arrived the blackened shrimp could have come out of a can, the chicken breast was like shoe leather, and the four cheese macaroni was dry and tasteless.  The manager did take $15 off an 8 meal bill to try to accommodate us, however I used to like Applebee's very much but was very, very disappointed today with the kitchen service and food. It was one of those situations where I felt bad for the waitress because of poor performance from the kitchen."
Patricia H.,"Redding, CA",25,154,,2.0,8/14/2011,"I love Applebee's. I honestly think that the food is mostly good, and I enjoy going there. This particular location, however, has some issues. It's mostly the service. My husband and I go there about once every few months, and are always sad about how much we get ignored. Sometimes a creepy manager will come by and ask if everything is okay, but he is usually so busy that I don't think he would even register if we said anything back to him. I have had my drinks ""comp""ed a few times because of all the complaints I have given. I'd say, skip this place and if you are really desperate for Applebee's, just go to Oroville (*cringe*)."
Bianca G.,"Oceanside, CA",47,70,14,5.0,3/30/2014,I really like this place. Service is good and really good food! My favorite are the drinks :) and wings are so delicious. Atmosphere really nice. Its a family place.
Elena V.,"Chico, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/21/2015,"Gave applebees a second chance. But again another disappointment. Service is incredibly slow,  had to flag down a waiter to just get water. Food was also slow incoming out and other half of our order had sat and got cold. The positive they comped one dinner."
Karen W.,"Chico, CA",8,8,,2.0,10/31/2013,Every time I come here something is always off. Undercooked food or the service times are too long even though the place is far from being packed. If it wasn't for the 2 for $20 deal it would not be worth coming here.
Diane S.,"Houston, TX",306,948,153,3.0,5/17/2011,"The food here really isn't that good but they're happy hour is a pretty good deal. It starts at 3 pm ends at 6 or 7 pm at least m to f I always get the little chicken bites with buffalo sauce so freakin delicious! My friends like their spinach dip and chicken tenders. Everything on the appetizer menu is half off yay! Tons of parking. Located near all the Chico chain restaurants near the mall. I would only go here for happy hour, otherwise only an okay in my book and I would skip it"
Robert L.,"Chico, CA",66,28,13,5.0,2/1/2014,We had the boneless skinless appetizer for lunch and it was great. Every time we drive by my kids ask to go there and have the same platter of boneless chicken strips with barbaque sauce.
Smith J.,"Chico, CA",0,6,,1.0,3/27/2015,"The worst Applebee's ever I tried many different times to go and give another chance but they always fail me. First time I went my food was cold so I told them and they just put it in the microwave because the plate was just hot and the food was luke warm. The second time I ordered a cowboy burger and they forgot the onion string which makes the ""cowboy burger"" it was to go so it was a hassle to call. Third time I ordered a 13.00 salad and It was so small a little kid would still want more food, good thing it was a gift card because I would not want to ever spend my hard working money here ever again."
Lisa X.,"Fresno, CA",0,24,23,1.0,3/19/2015,"35 minutes for three small appetizers is ridiculous! It wasn't even busy! Tables who came way after got their appetizers and we were still waiting...finally we were fed up and left and that's when the appetizers came out. On our way out the manager said we could eat the food for free, but we were so fed up we paid for the soda and stormed out. it doesn't make up for the slow crappy service. My soda wasn't refilled either and the waitress walked by a bunch of times. Save your money  35 minutes--go to in and out burger!"
