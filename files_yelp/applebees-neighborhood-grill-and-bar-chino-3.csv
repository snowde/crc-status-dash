Latte B.,"Ontario, CA",31,83,6,5.0,10/28/2017,The food was great.  Love the French onion oil and wonton tacos!  Michelle was the friendliest and most helpful server!!
Saul C.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,5,5.0,1/1/2018,Miguel did excellent!!! He was on top of everything. Food came out hot and everything was correct. Never had to ask for a refill on drinks. Phenomenal service. The greeter was really nice but I didn't get her name. I know it sucks to work on New Years guys but Thank you.
Greg F.,"Chino, CA",3216,370,3524,4.0,1/6/2017,"Welcome to the Neighborhood!  We got turned back on to Applebee's during the football special because of their happy hour and burger specials. Some of our favorite happy hour specials included the Grilled Chicken Wontons, Steak Quesadillas, Spinach and Artichoke Dip, and the Boneless Wings. The presentation was very good, and the portions for the price during happy hour were excellent. In regards to the Any Burger Monday specials, I was surprised by the quality and presentation of the meal. It resembled a burger you might get a specialty pub. The meat was perfectly cooked, and the garnish was excellent. During the football season, you can order any burger for $6.99.  You can't beat it.  Try the American Burger or the All Day Brunch Burger if you're craving a taste of breakfast, lunch, and dinner.    Several beers and drinks are also included on the happy hour menu. They had the standard and most popular light beers, Mexican beers, and a few IPAs. I went with a few on-tap beers, and my wife chose the ""Perfect Margarita."" The Perfect Margarita has Grand Mariner, it is was in fact perfect. We sat at the bar, and the staff was excellent.  Try visiting Applebee's, and give their sporting atmosphere and happy hour specials a try. You might be surprised like we were!"
Bonnie Y.,"Chino, CA",125,741,3648,1.0,1/18/2017,Worst meal I've had for a long time... I shouldn't expect much but still!  The only thing OK here are the drinks and some of the appetizers. We wouldn't have come if we didn't have gift cards.  Don't waste your appetite and go to Islands across instead.
Cole F.,"Chino Hills, CA",65,11,1,5.0,12/15/2017,This Applebee's has been around since I was a kid. My family and I used to eat here all the time especially after Church on Sundays. The only food I really have when I go here is chicken tenders with ranch dressing and fries. Their fries are probably my top five favorite fries of all time. I love going back to this place to have a bite to eat always delicious meals.
Jimmy G.,"Chino, CA",4,86,8,5.0,11/11/2017,Thank you for  remembering veterans and giving us dinner on the house. My family and I went in for dinner on Veterans Day and thanked me for serving. We had good service and dinner was great. Place was packed but some how they managed to keep things going. Thanks
Christie S.,"Chino, CA",0,4,4,1.0,7/23/2017,"Food was bland and over cooked. The server Amanda was nice but seemed overworked (understaffed?).  She forgot to put the in part of the order, we got silverware 5 minutes after food. Had to ask for mayo for our burger twice and the 2 caprese meals we ordered came with a tiny piece of basil. Too bad."
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,2.0,1/20/2017,"Nice to see new restaurants pop up in Chino, shame to see them all be huge chain restaurants. The service was lacking, rushed and just not into it. The food was horrible quality, not much better than microwavable meals at home. Everything is just overloaded with sodium and still has no flavor. Not a fan of the apps, salads or burgers we got here, even the dessert tasted very much storebought. Not worth the money, would not bother to return here."
Alli M.,"Chino, CA",3,35,11,5.0,11/12/2017,"The service was great, our waitress was really efficient. The food came out fast & it was delicious. Will definitely be back to this location."
Jordan S.,"Chino Hills, CA",35,1,,5.0,12/24/2017,"After intense workout at my gym I decided to eat Applebee's, I went around 11:45 Friday night, I had an issue with one of the employees there because he had bad customer service skills and I ended up speaking to the manager Jenna, wonderful lady with one of the best customer service I've received, my intentions was never to go back to that Applebee's in chino hills California but the way she displayed professionalism change my mind and I will now be going back, the bartender that serve me also the one to help me speak to the manager, she had a very unique name and sadly I don't know how she spell it but without her I would have never even speak to the manager and none of those would have happen and they would have lost frequent customer. I should have put a review on Friday night but I just got the chance to. Thank you Jenna!!"
Amanda C.,"San Diego, CA",121,29,15,1.0,6/9/2017,Ordered the sampler that came with boneless chicken wings and one of the chicken wings wasn't cooked all the way. I bit into it and noticed raw chicken cutlet on the inside. Disgusting
Carmen C.,"El Monte, CA",2,28,18,3.0,10/25/2017,"Came on my birthday, got a free sundae, got 3 margaritas drinks for myself, service was attentive and good, food was meh. I got the shrimp stir fry something, like it wasn't bad but I expected something more/different. I was a little disappointed, but even so the servers there are nice they just need to work on the food."
Jared D.,"Adelanto, CA",0,39,50,2.0,10/18/2017,The service was absolutely amazing however for the chefs and the food it was horrible. We all ordered pasta and the Alfredo sauce was extremely watery and cold. Not just cold but freezing cold
Ashley C.,"Riverside, CA",110,31,12,4.0,9/22/2017,"Attentive service, clean environment, great deals. Tons of options for food and what was ordered was delicious. We had chosen a two item appetizer and waitress came back to let us know it would be cheaper to buy individually off the happy hour menu! What a great service to customers since a happy hour menu wasn't included. Definitely will go back"
Josue F.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,19,29,1.0,9/18/2016,"You know when you go to Stater Bros. And walk by the deli line at night, right before closing. And you see the really dry, and burnt wings and Moyo fries... Yup!that's how my food was. Came by because they gave me a gift card last December. So we showed up. Wings were really salty, my potatoes were really burnt, and dry from the heat lamp. And to top it off, my GF got a butchers meat with potatoes,  which it looked amazing on the picture of coarse, but her onion rings were beyond burned. Really bad presentation. Idk why they would even send the plates like this.."
Robert V.,"Upland, CA",3,21,16,1.0,3/29/2017,"Just left this location. Came in about 10 min ago, sat at the bar and waited for the bartender to acknowledge us, she said hi to a friend of the workers that arrived at the same time. Looked over at us but didn't say anything, we weren't even given menus or even a simple smile. By the time she came up to us she asked for id's and walked away. We did not feel welcomed, we decided to drive 20 min out of our way to the Eastvale Applebee's instead of experiencing an even worse experience at this location. I understand you guys were closing an hour after we arrived but your bartender should make customers feel welcomed instead of us feeling like a burden. Very disappointing, the Montclair and Eastvale locations have never let us down before.  -Robert"
Priscilla C.,"Whittier, CA",106,58,90,1.0,1/15/2017,So my friends and I came here to eat and we ordered a steak well done then we sent it back for them to re cook it it was super pink and then they brought it back and again it was pink any way we just paid and left didn't finish it won't come again
Maggie D.,"Diamond Bar, CA",75,5,1,1.0,2/28/2017,"My husband, grand daughter and I  went for lunch on Sunday. The food had no flavor, I thought it was just my meal, but it was also my husbands. I will not go back. The waitress was great, the food not."
Lisa T.,"Ontario, CA",205,144,83,1.0,2/17/2017,"I want to start off by saying I felt scammed here. Only came here to use an Applebees gift card and Visa gift card my family received for Christmas. Asked our waitress (Debra C.) to ring up both cards before applying cash. Applebees gift card was $25 and Visa was $50. She only charged $41 on the Visa and never returned the card back to us. So we ended up having to apply more cash than we should have. Did she keep the $9 for herself. She continued to say ""that's all the card has on there is $41."" Then she said sometimes gift cards don't work right at restaurants. Then she said well maybe it automatically added tip. NOTHING made sense. We asked the manager to put the $50 back onto the Visa card so that we can just pay cash because you cannot scam asians! lol I've never had such a hard time using a Visa gift card in my life. Please check your bill before and after payment. The way they handle money here is sketchy. I don't know what she's pocketing or what is for the register. Anyways, as for the food...exactly what you expected. Terrible. Edible but nothing sort of amazing.  Sat next to these drunk couples...so annoying. No wonder why no one goes here anymore. Staff act like they hate their job which they probably do. Not friendly at all. Don't waste your money, you're better off at in n out across the street . So many other places to go to. Never coming back."
Angie F.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,51,1,5.0,7/2/2017,So tonight we came and the service was beyond amazing Brian our server was great. He actually asked us to cut our steaks to make sure that's how we wanted them I have never been asked that before. came to our table to make everything was alright more then once thanks Brian for defining what customer service really is
Trung N.,"Los Angeles, CA",493,660,2740,3.0,9/30/2015,"3 stars! Sunday football (they don't have the NFL ticket, FYI), air conditioning (Inland Empire heat is brutal man), and cheap food. I come here on Sundays sometimes. I sit in the bar area because there's generally no wait. I watch some football, eat very okay tasting appetizers, and bask, uninterrupted, in the glory of football season.  They offer all sorts of deals. My sister and I have been indulging in their appetizer deal where you can choose 2-3-4-5 of their appetizers (portions are much smaller, but good if you don't want to commit) for a low, low price. Winner? Wonton chicken tacos.  Applebee's is like eating fast food, except with TVs. And alcohol."
Leanne D.,"Chino Hills, CA",3,106,4,3.0,8/5/2017,"My husband and I wanted to go somewhere for dinner that was reasonably priced tonight and thought we would try Applebees since we haven't been there in a while. Applebees has a 2 for $20 deal that includes a shareable appetizer and two entrees. I ordered the cedar grilled lemon chicken which was very light and tasty. My husband ordered the American standard burger. We decided to order the two side salads for our appetizer. All in all the food and the service was very good. Outside of a fast food option, $20 for dinner is not too bad. We would actually rate our experience tonight 3 1/2 stars and would recommend Applebee's if you don't feel like cooking and don't feel like spending a whole lot of money."
Andrea L.,"Chino, CA",3,30,3,1.0,6/19/2017,"If I could give this 0 stars I would. Ordered the new fire grilled salad wrap .....i have to seriously ask what they were thinking serving me a wrap smothered in mayonnaise,  bacon, lettuce and cold chicken.....it was nasty...the item I ordered off the menu said lemon juice, fire roasted veggies, chicken and sirarcha ....here is a picture of what they gave me. Horrible."
Ashley A.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,19,3,2.0,6/2/2017,By the time me and my boyfriend took our first bites the food was already cold and really suggesting they have hot plate  at least with their steak  dinner
Coleen C.,"Bellflower, CA",1,20,8,5.0,5/29/2017,Portion of food was decent size but customer service was incredible. We were greeted and seated immediately per MIGUEL. He was also our awesome waiter! Good attitude from beginning to end. He was very enthusiastic and constantly checks how our group were doing but NOT to a point that he was bothering. He gave delicious suggestions and we were all satisfied with our orders.The rest of the staff were very helpful and friendly as well :)
Miguel S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",15,36,3,1.0,7/14/2017,"Seems like the manager is the only one that is trying to make this night service go good for us, unfortunately servers like mason is not on top of he's stuff. He is not nice and not even trying to provide good service... wow worst service, rude employee ever. Never again! Thank you manager Edgar for coming to our table many times to make our experience better!. More managers like this would make this store better, 4rth time here and every time service sucks. Reason why I keep coming cause is the only one near my home and hope each experience would be better.. NOT."
R L.,"Corona, CA",1,62,,5.0,3/22/2017,"We came in on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch and the restaurant wasn't busy so we immediately got a table. Brittney was very friendly, and was excellent in the way she treated us. The food was great and we did not wait long. Brittney continuously asked us if we were alright. Also, the lady manager was attentive to what her customers needed. I will definitely recommend Applebee's Chino. Good job!"
Lex L.,"Chino, CA",74,8,,1.0,10/5/2017,This location has the worst customer service. Our waiter came to our table once and didn't even ask if we needed anything else. Bye the time the rest of our food came the other food was cold. I get that it was a busy day but maybe hire more servers or don't seat people if you're going to have the wait 30 minutes just to order. Will not be returning to this location.
Jasmine C.,"Rialto, CA",0,9,,1.0,8/5/2017,I had a really Bad experience here and never again will I come back. No server was available or even bothered to ask to take our order it took them more than 20 minutes to take our drink order. I had to place my order through the machine provided on the table. I ordered Two appetizers they came to my table cold! I was so disappointed!!! Than I ordered two drinks! They come back so sour!!! Like just Horrible!!! I ordered a steak! With mashed potatoes! It comes to my table cold!!...I just gave up!!! Like why even bother!! Trying to get the proper meal! As it should be given to you! I mean! Come on you are paying for it! ...I was so upset! I just paid for the food and left! Never again will I come here ...maybe others will have a better experience. BUT I SURE AS HELL WONT COME BACK!! MAN!!! AND I WAS HUNGRY! ...the sad part about it is as I was walking out the Host asked how was everything I was honest about it ! Lmao! And all she said sorry about that! See you soon! LMAO??! WHAT THE HELL! I JUST HAD TO LEAVE! ...NEVER AGAIN! APPLEBEES!  SEE YA!
John W.,"Pomona, CA",0,4,,4.0,4/8/2017,"We tried the spinach/artichoke pasta with chicken. It was tasty but lacking.  The artichokes were finally minced and almost invisible. The corkscrew pasta was too heavy for the dish and it lacked garlic. However, the chicken was excellent.  It was nicely seasoned and greatly helped the fish.   The waiter, Charles B. was very nice and helpful."
Arline B.,"Ontario, CA",0,6,,5.0,7/9/2017,My first time at this Applebees location and let me tell y'all... shoutout to Charlene who was under pressure with people waiting for there to go orders. She kept composed & got the food out with a smile. That's what make a difference! Keep up the good work girl and thank you for service. Food was amazing as always can't go wrong with Applebee's
Liv L.,"Chino, CA",81,7,,1.0,10/5/2017,"worst service ever. The waiter did not come not once to see if we needed anything else. On top of that he got our order wrong and then never brought out our ranch, eaters, or margaritas that we ordered. I had to wait 30 minutes just to get the check from him. Didn't catch his name but apparently he was the manager. Not very good service for a manager. The whole experience was horrible I've never had a problem here before until today, I didn't even end up eating my food I was so irritated. Who wants to come to a restaurant when you're  starving just to have shitty ass service. ZERO STARS."
Karina M.,"Chino, CA",0,11,,5.0,5/7/2017,"This is my favorite location of applebees. The food is always great, we enjoy the honey bbq boneless wings, the mac and cheese, the all day breakfast burger. The servers are great,  feels like they can read my mind, they always know what I need before I even say it... weird and they are super nice. Restaurant is always clean. We enjoy going to this location and will return and recommend to others."
L B.,"Ontario, CA",0,3,,4.0,4/22/2017,Service was Awful. The food was good. We got out appetizers and sat there staring at them for about 5 minutes because we had no utensils. Over all it was good.
K H.,"Chino Hills, CA",2,33,9,5.0,8/24/2016,"After having an uneventful morning, I stopped by Applebee's for lunch. As soon as I walked in I was pleasantly greeted by the hostess and my server, Cinthia, was phenomenal! I was so indecisive and she patiently assisted me with my lunch selection. The presentation and the taste of the food was surprisingly outstanding. The manager also stopped by to see if my dining experience was going well. I have to give 5 stars to Applebee's for their wonderful service! This dining experience has truly made my day!!!"
Jasmine K.,"Pomona, CA",538,97,127,1.0,9/17/2015,"My experiences at Applebee's hasn't ever been amazing, yet I decided to come eat here once again last early Friday evening.  We started with the boneless brbq wings- I must say these were good, but honestly frying up some pieces of chicken and throwing some sauce on them isn't that difficult.  For my meal I decided to try the new brunch burger- hash browns, fried egg, cheese, bacon.  First bite, I could taste something very funky. Once I dissected the pieces of the burger, it was the meat that tasted horrendous. It was the worst tasting burger I have ever eaten. This 10 dollar burger has nothing on In n outs $3 double double.  My friend's steak and shrimp parmesan whatever, was super chewy and hardly seasoned. The vegetables were literally just thrown on the plate, unseasoned and all. You would think that one of the more expensive items on the menu would be put together with a little more dignity than that! It would be nice to see a place like Applebee's, that serves a variety of options, use good products in cooking their dishes. You can tell by the way the food is prepared and how it tastes on how much the management/owners don't care about what it's customers are consuming. I would rather go to a whole in the wall then come to this restaurant chain.  Come here to get drunk off happy hour and order apps. The rest of their menu is garbage."
Tia T.,"Covina, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/14/2017,What a great place!!! Service was perfect and the new menu was amazing! The staff was so helpful from the hosts to the manager and they were working as a team. The atmosphere was happy and upbeat. Our drinks were refreshing & the beer was ice cold. The machines at the table make everything so simple. Awesome place to have in the neighborhood! Definitely our all time favorite place to eat!!
Cathy K.,"Chino Hills, CA",1,13,,1.0,9/25/2016,"I went here to eat dinner on their patio and enjoy a warm evening.  They have installed extra lighting in the patio area.  The lighting is so bright that it is not relaxing at all infact it is irritating having the raw light in your eyes.    We moved to a booth inside.  After waiting over 10 minutes and watching countless waiters rush pass us, we left and ate at Islands across the street.  Better lighting, great service and food.  Too bad for Applebee's and their bright unwelcoming lighting."
S R.,"San Dimas, CA",58,9,4,5.0,2/14/2017,"Great location with excellent service. My wife and I went here for a Valentine's Day lunch. I've been to many Applebee's over the years, in CA and other states and this is the best location I've visited. The staff was pleasant and attentive. The service was prompt and the food was good and still hot when it arrived at the table. I would definitely go back to this location in the future."
Kirstie S.,"Ontario, CA",2,44,3,1.0,12/26/2016,This place is horrible do not go there the managers are terrible and the food is atrocious they completely messed up on every part of our meal literally go find any Applebee's you can beside this one
