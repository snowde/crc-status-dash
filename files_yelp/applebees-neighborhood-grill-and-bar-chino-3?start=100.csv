Aria F.,"Royal Oak, MI",28,285,21,4.0,12/1/2012,"We got the southwest shrimp fetuccini and the chicken. The chicken was great but the pasta was really heavy on the cheese and I could barely finish it. The chicken was great but the pasta was disappointingly heavy.  Our server, Andrew, was very helpful and patient with us since it was our first time there.  Overall, I will give 4 stars because of good food, great service and a fun sports bar atmosphere that was not fake.  Will come back again"
Maximiliano P.,"Chino, CA",1,5,,1.0,5/22/2016,this place sucks ass the food is terrible id rather eat my dogs food like wtf the ribs are so crusty the fries so nasty mashed potatoes more like wtf potatoes fuck this place  the only thing good about this place is the waitress's ass
Amir N.,"Arcadia, CA",1,17,,1.0,5/13/2016,"It's a Shame to have Applebee's franchise in this restaurant. Waited 30 minutes for a server to even greet us at the table where we were seated, but apparently the waiters were too busy assisting other guests when the place wasn't even half full. When we got up and about to leave, I decided to inform them, and nobody seemed to really care that we waited 30 minutes without even talking to a server. Don't waste your time there because luckily Right across the street there is IN-N-OUT ;)"
Luscious 1.,"Ontario, CA",0,15,,2.0,7/18/2015,"I usually come here when I can't decide where to go. On this visit I ordered a perfect margarita, It is a drink where I can get 3-4 martini cups depending on how much ice they use. Anyway they only give me one olive, I asked for extra olives (3). When it was time to pay I noticed they charged me $1.00 for the olives. It was not mentioned by the server. Anyhoooo... Margarita had more ice than tequila and I did not enjoy it much."
Alexis C.,"Westlake, Los Angeles, CA",53,45,10,2.0,7/12/2015,"Okay so my husband and I usually go to the one is Montclair (and they are fabulous) but today we were in chino so we went to this one! It looks brand new so our expectations were maybe a little higher! They know how to disappoint! We sat at the bar and the bartenders were horrible! If you were not a regular or there friend they barely gave you the time of day! Oh and one of the bartenders was clearly struggling on the well and kept saying fuck! (Not very professional) The only person who was somewhat helpful was the runner or the expo, she got refill for us, remove our dirty plates, ... smiled! She at least made an effort! Retrain your bartenders on customer service! If you could retain every guest that walks into your facility you would make more money!"
Monica L.,"Chino, CA",4,30,7,1.0,4/24/2015,"Service was crap. The server seemed impatient and was lousy at doing her job. She gave us the bill right when we got our food WHICH TOOK ONE HOUR! It wasn't even our waiter who gave us the food it was by two ladies who looked like they could be eating here not working here by their unprofessional apparel. Because it took so long for the food to come out I was expecting it to be delicious, oh was I wrong. It was a small portion and somewhat tasted like frozen food. And on top of that the soda was watered down. This place is terrible would not recommend."
Kirsten K.,"Lexington, KY",68,20,5,5.0,5/5/2015,"Went tonight (May 5, 2015) for my daughter's birthday.  Our server was Eric.  All I can say is incredible service, and great food!  My daughter really enjoyed herself!  Anyone who comes to this Applebee's, ask for Eric to be your server!"
Andy C.,"Chino, CA",4,85,31,3.0,10/17/2013,We are regulars here as you cannot beat the happy hour prices!  But sometimes we have noticed the service really lacks. Bartenders will only  pay attention to certain patrons while we have to wave them down to order.... Second guessing this location now.
Conor L.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,24,1,5.0,1/24/2015,"I went there again with my sister and cousins. The waiter had made a mistake and forgotten about an order of steak. He brought it out right away after I asked him to check on it, he apologized profusely but fixed the situation.  A few minutes later, manager comes and checks in and also apologizes for the steak. Waiter apologizes again. Besides the steak issue, everything was on point. Waters and iced tea refills, brought new chips after we were done.  Management and service are always on point. As usual, always impressed. Will come again."
Freddy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,16,30,2.0,1/16/2015,"Food was ok , service really bad . I ask the waitress to change the channel . I got a rude response . Food cold , and no flavor at all . I think this stir is not the Applebee's  I just to go to . Out of 10 . 2 . No joke ."
Bob D.,"Chino, CA",6,42,,3.0,1/15/2015,"We used to come here a lot, but the food is no longer as tasty as it used to be. I feel like they've cut down on the quality in order to make the meals less expensive.  The service is good but when I walk out, I feel like I'm just not satisfied and would prefer to go somewhere else next time.  The wifey still likes it and drags me here every once in a while as she just loves the appetizers."
Melanie M.,"Pomona, CA",38,9,2,5.0,6/7/2015,Love this place! The food is always great and the mixed drinks are the best!!! Iv'e ordered the baby back rips and garlic mashed potatoes are the bomb! Iv'e also had the Oriental chicken salad is great! and the staff are always great.
Trent S.,"Victorville, CA",20,32,23,1.0,9/2/2014,Was at this Applebees on 05/02/2014. At 8:00pm. My wife and I ordered strawberry lime aid. when we got the limeaids they came with crushed ice that was over the top of the glass. When i took all the ice out of my glass. there was only 1 quarter glass of drink. I paid 2.99 for a quarter glass of limeaid. redicules. i told the waitriss we wanted Icetea instead of limeaids. when i recived my bill she charged us for 2 limeaids   and 2 ice teas. When I questioned it she said well the limeaids do not come with refills. When i asked to speak to a manager our waitriss Janet W. said that the manager was busy. How convenant when i want to complain there is no manager avaible. We always eat at this Applebees. well that is untell today happened.
Phillip M.,"Ontario, CA",10,27,8,4.0,11/16/2013,"Well lets see, in my opinion for a restaurant chain the food is pretty good for the price. many different choices and a full bar is always a plus in my book. The service is usually okay, they are always so busy the servers are always moving. We have not really had a over the top server.  For all the different types of food offered they do good job and everything that I have ordered has been very tasty."
Janeth R.,"Montclair, CA",0,3,,2.0,3/12/2016,"I went to have lunch with my sister yesterday and must I say I like this Applebee's he location is great we are not first timers to this location either but yesterday sucked badly. First of let me tell you it wasn't busy at all what so ever for us to get BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. Our Server her name is ROXANNE. She literally didn't show up to our table what so ever, just twice maybe. She was MIA when we needed her& a someone else had to get our Drink refills. Honestly I hadn't experienced bad service their until yesterday. I know how it is I work in a restaurant myself so I would expect for places like that to have good service especially since it wasn't busy at all"
S P.,"Montclair, CA",28,25,25,1.0,8/8/2014,Just walked away due to horrible service from waitress on the patio & managers costumer service was lacking as well! Oh well I guess Islands gets our business now!
Diana N.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/17/2015,"I was so pleased with our server Roxanne and the food was fabulous however the General Manager Andrew was a pain in ass! He stood behind me at the table behind me and talked to the customers in such a loud voice that my ears are still ringing. I now know all about his parents courtship  and marriage, their life in Japan, the work he did for the military, that they have been married for over 40 years and all about his friends who got married before pregnancy and after finding out they were pregnant. I know his kids favorite movies and that he fell asleep  during both.  After all this I'm ready to write a book on how not to be a General Manager!"
Jeremy T.,"Chino Hills, CA",431,190,191,4.0,12/23/2013,"I had the club sandwich for a birthday dinner here. I usually come for the happy hour, which is bitchin', by the way.  Bottomline: great service, and our server gave me a bit of some ice cream with brownie for my birthday."
Maylein M.,"Ontario, CA",8,16,4,1.0,10/31/2014,Waited 20 minutes to be seated after calling in and being told there was no wait (with a party of 10 while i was 4 min away). Then waited an additional 45 min to get cold food on Halloween night. Never returning to this Applebee's
Lancelot C.,"Chino Hills, CA",332,8,3,2.0,2/10/2016,"I have always loved this Applebee's, but after tonight I don't think I could say that again. Long story short, I decided to order a to-go or take out tonight. I ordered our two burgers well done, with no pink. & guess what? One of the burgers was pink as the panther in the middle and slightly pink towards the edges of the burger. If it was my burger usually I probably would have just said ""fuck it!"" and ate it, but with it being my girlfriends I told her we could trade burgers. Usually she complains about the slightest pink in the burger so I figured it would be no big deal, but I didn't even bother eating it with how raw it still was. I mean all the manager did was replace the order and as I'm walking out says"" I put a brownie and ice cream in there.."" Like I don't want no fucking ice cream and a brownie. It would have been nice to be reimbursed and maybe an apology, but that didn't happen. Then the manager didn't want to let go of the container with the pink burger when I tried to split he burger open to show him. Gas might be cheap, but time isn't. The reason I ordered ""take out"" was so I could be at the comfort of my home after a shower and a long off day working, but that wasn't the case..."
