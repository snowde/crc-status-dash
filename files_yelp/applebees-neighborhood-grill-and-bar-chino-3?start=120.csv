Pd S.,"Chino, CA",0,45,12,4.0,5/2/2015,"Good hamburgers.   Typical sports bar atmosphere.  Clean, tasty, yeah it works."
Matt M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,4,5.0,9/6/2014,I've been here a lot of times that now they changed the menu and they add more to their happy hour which me and my girlfriend come for. I've also been going here for a while and Amanda is the best server in the place always makes you feel welcomed and cares about her customers. If I were you ask for amanda!
Megan R.,"Riverside, CA",69,83,7,5.0,7/27/2014,The servers here are always so sweet! They are very accommodating and I just love the atmosphere and prices.
Andre B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,13,,3.0,1/31/2014,"Not my first choice. The food wasn't great. My girlfriend and I had the two for 25 deal. The spinach and artichoke was good, but a little chunky for my taste. The steak was a little too salty, and the chicken mushroom was mediocre.  The food was not great, but the service was excellent. Waitress was very helpful."
Stephanie H.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,9,,1.0,9/20/2015,"We had not been to Applebee's in a couple of years due to the decline in food quality. (Un)fortunately we had a gift card so we decided to give it a shot. BIG MISTAKE. We ordered drinks and an appetizer at the same time. We received our appetizer but no plates, had to ask another waitress since our waiter was no where to be seen. He finally came around about 25 mins later to take our meal order (2 burgers). 30 mins later we got our burgers, I asked for 2 sides of ranch for each meal-we were almost done with our food before he brought ONE side of ranch out. We ordered our burgers well done and the patties were on the rare side. The fries were left on the plate since they tasted as if the lid fell off of the salt shaker. All the tables that this waiter was ""serving"" had dissatisfied faces. we will not be returned, Chilis is definitely our go to place for a quick and satisfying meal."
Leanne J.,"Chino, CA",13,10,,4.0,7/27/2014,"I love this Applebee's! Joe the manager is so awesome. Great customer service and great food, can't be beat! A plus, great classic rock always playing. I like your style, Joe.."
Leidy G.,"Ontario, CA",2,26,,5.0,1/13/2015,"The service here is amazing!! The manager the waiters, they just have this charm. Love it... They have us laughing all night :)"
Marie F.,"Chino, CA",14,15,1,5.0,4/14/2014,"My husband and I frequent this place regularly. Service is always excellent, fast, and friendly. Today's server was Robin and she was wonderful. Our regular bartender Jessica is also amazing. Happy Hour specials and great food make this a place worth stopping by."
Jessie S.,"Chino Hills, CA",6,16,22,3.0,3/31/2014,The bartender oscar was super nice and very helpful w my sisters drink. He made her his specialty.
Julie O.,"Ontario, CA",8,1,,3.0,4/2/2014,"Came to this location on Sunday 3/30 and usually the waiters are friendly, but this visit was different. We could tell our waiter was not very happy to serve us. He forgot our silverware, only came around a few times, and seemed bothered by our requests; that alone made the experience quite unpleasant. Other than that it was good! I would come here again as long as he is. It the one serving us."
Matthew F.,"Irvine, CA",346,189,57,3.0,3/24/2012,"The food here is ""ehh"" the happy hours are pretty cool, every day of the week has a different drink special. i.e tequila tuesday and margarita monday. I wouldn't come to eat for lunch or dinner, only for happy hour drinks and bar snacks."
Ruben S.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/14/2015,"Was surprisingly enjoyable. Me and my wife received a gift card for Christmas and decided it was about time to use it. The server was really nice and came by every often to check on us. The atmosphere was great! It was game day so they had a football game going. Even so, everyone was in a good mood. The food was good as well. We will definitely be coming to this location again!"
Melanie C.,"Pomona, CA",112,74,43,5.0,11/25/2013,Good place to chill at:) friendly staff. Good typical american food! Just came here to drink! Our server oscar was super nice! And kept joking around with us. Would come back! He was quick and attentitive!
Marina V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,5.0,5/16/2015,"Loved it! Our server was Tatiana G. She was very attentive and professional. I've been to other locations and this one was by far the best. Clean, friendly, fast, and the food was perfect."
Kristi E.,"Chino, CA",0,9,1,4.0,9/7/2012,"I've only been to Applebee's two times in my life. I know shocker, since I've lived near one my whole life. I want to start by saying its one of my favorite places to go now with my husband. We did the 2 for 20 meal deal. It also comes with an appetizer. We got the wings with honey...amazing, loved them. I got the steak both times which is my favorite. My husband got the chicken/shrimp which he was a fan of.  Last time we went was on Tuesday for my husbands birthday. I wanted to recognize, I believe his name was Austin. He was the host/busser. He opened the door when we first arrived, he sat us, and He continued to smile and help out all the tables. He even made sure we were okay. The first time we went here we waited 10 minutes for our server. That's why I gave four stars. However, the past time our server was excellent! I believe his name was Robert?  I recommend the food and this location. Can't wait to go back."
Chunk C.,"Los Angeles, CA",114,107,58,4.0,9/2/2013,I hadn't dined at apples bees in a while so my bf n I decided to drop by since we were in the area. It was a Sunday so it was pretty busy but no wait time which was nice. We were sat in Thomas' section and he was delightful! He was Very attentive and nice I am glad he was our server. As for the food we got the 2 for $22 (one entree choice from the 2 for $20 and one entree from 2 for $24). My bf got the chicken fingers n upgraded to the platter which gave him a few extra pieces of chicken. I got the shrimp with fries and I was surprised how many shrimp that were on the plate (good portion). We had a nice lunch thanks to Thomas and we will be back again!
Zelda H.,"Chino, CA",113,26,14,4.0,10/20/2011,Pros: I like going here once in a while.  The 500 cal menu is great for those watching the waist line. The happy hour is nice good beer selection. Always friendly servers. My one con: I just wish they would cut down on the salt on the regular menu.
Tammi J.,"Chino Hills, CA",12,2,,5.0,2/9/2014,"I love the staff, Joe has been there for years and always has it down. Waitress's are great, but always request Alisha since when we started going there she was a seated greeter! The weight watchers menu is plenty for me, the drinks are the bomb and the Blondie for dessert is the BEST! We go back all the time! Worth waiting if they are busy. Was concerned they would loose some business when the restaurant went in across the street but that place is just crazy! Won't be going there especially with any kids!"
Michele G.,"Chino Hills, CA",156,20,2,5.0,7/6/2014,I've been meaning to leave a review for a long time for this Applebee's. The service is always the best and the manager is always there making sure everyone is getting the best service. The atmosphere is always nice because it's never overly crowded or loud so I can enjoy a few drinks and appetizers with friends after a long day at work.
Joshua W.,"Henderson, NV",224,387,524,3.0,5/14/2009,"The best thing about Applebee's is their Sampler Platter! Their wings taste just like Hooters and they're boneless! Woo-hoo! The other favorite of mine is their Shrimp Parmesan Steak! If you're in need of saving some cash, Applebee's currently has a two-for-$20 deal that gives you two full plates of food! This location has been remodeled to a more contemporary style, but they removed their infamous wooden bar nooks that used to hang over the counter of the bar. Either way works for me, but I did like their old style as well. A few years back, when the Angels were in the playoffs, I spent the afternoon at Applebee's for dinner and started watching the game and asked one of the waiters to turn on the volume (since all TVs were on the same channel and everyone was there to watch the game). A few minutes later, the manager started walking around muting all the TVs. When I asked what the deal was, she explained that they're not able to have the TV volume turned on at any Applebee's restaurants. I really thought she was joking, but she was serious. Needless to say, we took off and finished watching the game at home."
