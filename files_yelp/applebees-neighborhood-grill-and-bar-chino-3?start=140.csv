Kelley L.,"Long Beach, CA",24,430,463,3.0,7/24/2010,"After a number of disappointing visits in the past, this Applebee's has definitely turned things around. The food tastes a lot better, and you get your money's worth, especially during the awesome Happy Hour and the two-for-$20 meals. My favourite: sirloin steak, which was cooked pretty well. The service has also improved, but it could be better if there was an employee ready to seat guests."
Ozwald C.,"Chino, CA",6,27,34,2.0,3/25/2013,"Disappointed. I sat at the bar for lunch and the bartender was all sour faced for some reason. I still smiled and place my order. As I got my food I noticed she left to sit down and eat without bothering to mention anything. Tacky. After I finished my food which was good btw, she said she was on her way to go take her break. No "" thank you"" or "" have a nice day"". Sheesh. Food was better then I expected, but service was sorry for being one of three people sitting at the bar. I won't be back."
Chandra H.,"Chino, CA",57,17,25,4.0,4/21/2012,The chicken wonton tacos are a great appetizer.  The staff are friendly. Good location but a crowd parking lot. Usually parking is in the adjacent lot.
Kathy I.,"Chino, CA",0,4,4,1.0,4/18/2015,"Stayed in chino for my company's event got hungry and decided to order Applebee's to go. I should have used my better judgement and went elsewhere. Got to the restaurant ""to go"" parking spots were taken. I walk in and look for the to go section hostess tells me to go to the bar and they will help me. I'm literally standing there for 10 minutes and nothing 2 bartenders are to busy talking and helping alcoholics needs. Finally I get helped by someone else out of the bar he says to ask bartender to ring me up he never does. Other guy comes with my food and finally rings me up and tells me Johnny is going to go thru my order to make sure everything is correct. The ignoramus moron never did, by now I'm just disappointed and walk out without silverware. My food was gross and cold but then again what can I expect from a restaurant that will let themselves be embodied with such poorly customer service."
Ann C.,"Chino Hills, CA",715,545,480,4.0,10/19/2009,"After several disappointing visits to the Applebee's in Walnut I nervous about dining at this Chino location.... THIS ONE'S A WINNER!!! Did you know that the Applebee's are all different franchised own?!  That explains why the Walnut one is ghetto and gross and this one is the complete opposite! Judging by the decor alone this Applebee's stands out from the rest.  The bar setup is above par- with booths inside the bar area instead of the uncomfortable high chair table tops.  There are TONS of big plasmas set up to watch both football and baseball games. Food was better too. Overall, I think I found my new Applebee's to watch games at.   Order:  Oriental Chicken Salad & Riblets YUMMY! Ps.  Remember they used to serve ""Onion Peel"" appetizers!?!  With the horseradish sauce!?  Those were SOOO GOOD!!!  What can I do to bring them back!?! BTW that philly win SUCKED- c'mon Dodgers!!  MAN UP!!!"
Mike S.,"Chino Hills, CA",4,51,2,3.0,11/1/2012,"It's Applebees.  Decent food at good prices.  Service was good and attentive on this visit. As  for the bar, Applebees is more of a beer place.  I don't see many cocktails getting mixed nor can anyone see the liquor selection.  All in the name of keeping family friendly."
Jonathan K.,"Pomona, CA",79,142,2,4.0,8/18/2010,Everytime me and my friends go here we have a good time  The food is good and service is great Overall a great experience
Rachel G.,"Chino Hills, CA",411,124,118,4.0,10/13/2013,"Its been a while since I last came to Applebee's. Their food just didn't interest me compared to its competitors in the Chino Hills area such as Red Robin, Yard House or even Chili's! I came on a Friday night particularly for the butter pecan blondie! My cousin and I used to be in loooooove with this dessert and my tummy was def craving this yummy goodness that night! After ordering my dessert, I realized that menu had changed quite a bit since my last visit! They had new options such as the honey peppered chicken or shrimp! It all sounded very tempting! Sadly, my tummy just couldn't do anything more besides dessert and drinks! I love their drink selection at Applebee's! They have margaritas, sangria, beer, mixed drinks,  wine.. you name it! They even have Halloween drinks for the upcoming holiday! Hahha so cute! I ordered the berry sangria and my oh my! That drink was delishhhh! So refreshing, sweet, and just what I was looking for! I underestimated this place! We'll see my reaction after trying some of their new food.. I'll keep you posted, yelpers! (:"
S And L B.,"Pomona, CA",0,17,,5.0,8/23/2014,"Good food, fast service  I go there about once a mouth for the 2 for 20 menu  , I only thing is the times I go it's always bizzy but lunch time is a better time for this location"
Yong L.,"Pasadena, CA",70,256,94,5.0,7/16/2010,"The food here is pretty good. Standard, really, as Applebee's chains go. The prices aren't cheap, but they do have a 2 for $20 special - 2 full meals and an appetizer for $20. It's a good deal, and the selection has some delicious choices. Their chicken penne was pretty great, as is their spinach/artichoke chips and dip.  They have something called realburgers, which is supposed to be a higher quality burger with more of everything. I tried the A-1 peppercorn realburger, and was not disappointed. It was juicy and delicious. But more than the food, what really stuck out to me was the outstanding service. Not only did our waitress check up on us more than once to see if we needed anything, so did the hostess - AND the busboy! I was impressed. They have plenty of tvs here both around the restaurant and the bar for sporting events and such. Great place to eat, I've been here a few times and have never been disappointed."
Jena O.,"Ontario, CA",13,18,,5.0,2/20/2012,"I basically only go here for happy hour and it is the best! Unlike other Applebees, this location has happy hour EVERY night from 9PM to closing. Selected appetizers are half off and beers are a steal. I'm not exactly sure about the prices, but domestic beers are around $3 a glass (large glasses) and imported are around $5. There are nightly specials on well drinks and margaritas too. My friends and I go here a lot. The service is good, vibe is nice, lots of TVs, and great prices for beers/appetizers!"
Marisa P.,"Portland, OR",175,31,7,2.0,12/26/2011,"Food was not good. BF had the cheese and spinach ravioli which was tasty but swimming in grease. They have a garlic toast bread basket on the menu but got gross cold bread sticks with this weird lumpy stuff spread on top, kinda tasted like garlic/pesto. Waiter was just off...but what do you expect from Applebee's? We did have a giftcard so I guess it was worth $10."
Roselle E.,"Chino, CA",91,238,7,3.0,10/13/2008,"There really isn't anything at Applebee's that I can write home about, but the riblets and the blondie for dessert.   Who can say no to AYCE riblets, slaw, and steak fries for $10?  Not me!  If you're on a budget and in dire need of some bbq goodness, I recommend coming here.   And don't forget to finish off your meal with the blondie - oh that delicious maple brownie, topped with vanilla ice-cream, white chocolate and walnuts.... so heavenly."
April P.,"Chino Hills, CA",42,4,,2.0,6/21/2012,"I've been here twice and will probably travel to find another Applebee's. On my first visit, when my food got to me, it was luke warm. Not hot like food is supposed to be, my fries and burger were almost cold as if it was sitting for a while before being delivered to my table. I didn't eat it, neither did my friends who experienced the same. We left. I decided to give it another chance for happy hour. The waitress was friendly but she only came to our table TWICE the hour and half we were there. We had ordered dessert with our drinks but only got our drinks. After finishing them we waited 20 minutes and she was still nowhere to be seen. We had to physically get up to ask a waitor to give us our check. Our waitress finally came over and asked ""You don't want the dessert you ordered?"" Um. Not after waiting all night for it."
D F.,"Laguna Hills, CA",2,63,2,1.0,1/19/2011,"Kitchen repeatedly botched order. When manager brought replacement, burger was raw -- blood from patty was soaked through the bun. Do not eat here, they will give you food poisoning."
John G.,"Ontario, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/6/2013,Great Buffalo Wings!!  Love the 2for20 deals!!  Awesome for my budget!!!!
Erin T.,"Mesa, AZ",0,30,6,2.0,9/23/2013,"The food took quite a long time and was much dryer than at other Applebees. Unfortunately, the slow service didn't make up for it either. I wouldnt go back."
Drew M.,"Ontario, CA",9,20,,4.0,3/28/2009,"Can you really go wrong with Applebees?! This restaurant has been remodeled to meet the new Applebee standards.  Looks clean and has a contemporary flare to it. The food is good, and the services has always been exceptional.  I've been here on several occasions and always seem to get an eager waiter/waitress that gets the job done. The two for $20 deal that is going on right now is great.  Comes with more food than a normal person should eat.  Happy hour deals are great and thank goodness for nice and cold beer. If you're hungry, and don't feel like risking a poor dining experience, this place is as solid as it gets."
Andy O.,"Pomona, CA",118,46,19,4.0,3/16/2013,"i've come here twice and both time my waiter has been real friendly and have given me some sort discount and would come back every 5 mins to see if i needed a refill or anything, thats the kind of service i like."
Steve M.,"Chino, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/19/2013,"Worst lunch j ever had !!!!!!! They are ripping-off the people.They advertise a sandwich for lunch and give you half!!!!!!!!!!!! The salad was smaller then a kid's meal. Who-ever goes there,make sure you see the food before you pay!!!!!!!!!!!  I would never go back to applebee's"
