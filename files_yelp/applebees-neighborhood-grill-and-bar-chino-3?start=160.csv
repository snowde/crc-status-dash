Misty T.,"Upland, CA",62,130,74,5.0,1/21/2011,I never have a problem when I go there. Everyone is real nice. food comes out fast. I get seated fast even when they are busy... which is all the time. I usually order take out and everything comes out tasting great.

Beeh N.,"Pomona, CA",9,41,34,3.0,2/9/2011,"Awesome happy hours, but the big screen t.v. needs to get update, when viewing sporting events its very distorted with awful quality for the main screen at the bar.  Bartenders are very attentive and are geniwully nice."
Corina S.,"Orange County, CA",249,369,118,4.0,9/20/2010,"We stopped here to wait for our friends to head to the fair.  Service was fast and friendly!! Our waiter was a new guy that was in training, it was irritating that his ""trainer"" kept making it a point that he was new, he did awesome.  The appetizer's were yummy, beer was cold.  Perfect waiting spot!  I haven't been to Applebee's in forever, it seems like they have expanded their menu which was great.  My friend ordered ""The perfect margarita"", she would give that 5 stars alone!  My opinion has changed about Applebee's."

Rachel C.,"San Jacinto, CA",0,11,,3.0,6/3/2013,I went here one with a few friends and it was pretty late at night. We ordered an appetizer sampler or something and it came with chips. There were a few good ones on top and the the rest was just crumbs. You'd think they'd notice before giving it to you. Also our waitress hardly ever came to our table and we saw her off to the side on her phone for most of our visit.
Dawn K.,"Diamond Bar, CA",3,170,80,3.0,8/23/2010,"t is a typical Applebees. Food consistancy is an issue. Once we has fish and chips that you could have played hockey with. They have a nice patio for the summertime and the restaurant is a good size. Service is so-so, but if you are eating the queso dip you barely notice . . ."
Jerry W.,"Carson, CA",0,4,,3.0,1/3/2011,"Decent food but drinks are bad. Hardly any alcohol and overpriced. I think I""m gonna try Outback next time. 3 stars, tops"
Gina Q.,"Whittier, CA",17,705,136,3.0,11/27/2007,"So what do you do after you go to the swap meet and you're hungry? You go out to lunch. :) Applebee's became the choice after seeing a massive line at Mimi's next door. But that's okay, because we weren't a picky group. We just wanted food. I ordered a salad here. I should have ordered the whole salad instead of a half size, because when it came I was highly disappointed. The amount of chicken I got was plentiful, but the amount of lettuce in the salad was minimal. I thought there would have been more lettuce in my salad. I left lunch feeling quite hungry. The salad was tasty. It was the Santa Fe Chicken salad. The chicken was grilled. There was cheese and pico de gallo sauce along with guacamole and sour cream. The salad was a bit soggy from the dressing and pico de gallo. I don't know if I'd get this salad again. If I do, I might ask for the dressing on the side so that the lettuce stays more crisp and fresh. It was a less than stellar lunch and I usually like Applebees."
Kaitlin J.,"San Diego, CA",497,235,88,5.0,11/8/2009,"love this Applebees :)  the food was amazing and in large portions. the Sampler platter alone was enough for two and once our main meal came we were getting full haha. i went here on my way to knotts berry farm and didnt have my id with me the girl trusted me and i got some amazing drinks!  yumm! she had the same name as me too!  i like this cute location, lots of shops and registrants."
