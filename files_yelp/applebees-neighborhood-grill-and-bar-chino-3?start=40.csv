Jeannette G.,"Chino, CA",0,6,,5.0,2/7/2017,I really enjoy apple bees in chino. The food has always been good . The servers are friendly . When it came time to pay the bill and leave a tip the waitress brought it to my attention that the tip was way above my normal tip and she questioned me and yes I made a mistake and gave a fifty instead of a twenty .
Maricelle R.,"West Covina, CA",0,28,9,4.0,3/24/2017,A well run Applebee's. The manager was so great. She hustled made sure all the guests where taken care of. Great leader by example. Wait time was not bad considering it was so busy. Staff were very accommodating to our requests.
Stephanie G.,"Chino, CA",20,36,7,2.0,6/3/2016,"First off, our server was wonderful.  She did a great job with what she was given.  The two stars belong to her for being really nice and working hard all while pregnant.   I am not a fan of Applebee's but had a gift card so decided to try it again. We ordered drinks and were told they didn't have the ingredients. After changing our drink order they came back and said they had the ingredients after all. Ordered steaks cooked medium. They were well done.  Kitchen left off added mushrooms and onions.  My kids got their food a good five minutes after the adult orders came out.  The manager was kind and offered desserts on the house and removed the mushrooms and onions from our bill. Just not a great experience.   Repeatedly disappointed with visits to Applebee's."
Maria R.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/25/2017,"We went to this Applebee's for dinner. I order the classic bone-in wings. I asked for all drums.  Initially, our waitress, Ashley, said I couldn't have all drums. So I said fine. Then she came back and said that they can do it. So I though great. We my order came, I got the honey BBQ sauce instead of the classic buffalo sauce. She made it sound like it's my fault. Even if it was, she didn't have to make it like it was my fault I ordered it wrong.  She should have just said that she will exchange it for what I wanted.  So I was already upset at that point.  Then when I finally got  up order again, it had no drums, AT ALL.  Every piece was the part of the wings that I didn't want in the first place and asked not to get, initially.  What upset me even more is that she didn't even tell me that they were going to do this so I can say that I don't want it. I had them take it back and ended up not eating anything. Another employee came by and offered to get me what I wanted, but at that point, I was done and who knows if they are going to spit in my food after rejecting the order twice."
Pauline T.,"Pomona, CA",139,162,181,3.0,7/26/2015,"Quality of the food is okay. I had the Triple Hog Dare Ya ($10.99) that comes with free refills on fries. I wasn't a huge fan. The BBQ sauce was pretty standard. The fries were also normal cut fries (pretty standard), however, the free refills was a nice bonus. I like that they have that. I think it's for the handheld sandwiches/burgers though. Maybe 6-8 to choose from. Nothing aaaaa-mazing. Service was fair, nothing outstanding there either."
Mena C.,"Chino, CA",4,55,179,4.0,7/1/2015,"Server is alway not the best here but their food make up for it.  Space is great for group and family, but their atmosphere is always smell like sautéed onion to me lol. Price is affordable and just to let you ppl know their refill fries comes with ONLY hand held food(sandwiches or burgers) only.  Every time (like once every 2 months) we visits, we have to ask our server to refill our drinks and if I get water, servers never put waged of lemon for me(I have to ask for a pc) 4 stars for good food, affordable and clean place and really yummy desserts."
Lene G.,"Chino, CA",1,15,4,5.0,7/29/2016,"My family & I always come to this Applebee's I love me a perfect margarita but hey when it's happy hour I can do a house margarita as well. Today we had a server name Lupita one very nice respectful lady!! She was filled with so much happiness.. She was one great server always came to check on us, we didn't have to wait or call her for refills she was on top of her game. If we had a question or wanted to add on to our order she was quick! Thank you Lupita for your awesome customer service you are doing great, & we appreciate your time."
Genesis A.,"Suisun City, CA",139,189,703,5.0,1/3/2015,"I was actually plesantly surprised :-) The waitress was on point. Refill at the right time, food just on time. Just the right amount of attention. I ordered and arnold palmer I have to say it was the best I've ever tasted 3 times in a row. Then I got a french onion soup, just the right amount of cheese and bread it was pretty close to perfect. Finally I got my thai shrimp salad. First they did not skimp of the shrimp HUGE plus. Then it was the right amount if EVERYTHING.  I am completely satisfied with my meal and the service  :-) would come back again and could eat this again"
Yamil L.,"Venice, CA",0,10,5,1.0,8/14/2016,Horrible!!! 5 beans on my Fiesta Chopped Salad 6 on my Wife's. I should it have check but since Apple Bees has never disappointed before I didnt check
Ben E.,"Chino, CA",1,24,1,5.0,6/4/2017,I have been dinning at Applebee's about 14 Years. I have been very pleased with the food and the service from the staff.
Ronaly R.,"Pomona, CA",0,5,,5.0,10/15/2016,"The food was delicious I got the steak and shrimp, the pitcher of Bacardi lemonade had an amazing flavor. The server was really nice Ellery attended us well."
Karla S.,"Alhambra, CA",0,5,,2.0,5/11/2017,"The employees were nice....but the food wasn't that great. We ordered off the 2 for 27$ meal. The spinach artichoke dip was burnt, the mac n cheese with chicken and bacon pasta tastes like it was a day old, mashed potatoes looked as if they were burned in the microwave, and the cole slaw was awful. The boyfriend didn't enjoy his meal at all (mac n cheese pasta) and the only thing I enjoyed eating was my steak. We probably won't ever come back here again."
Jeanette S.,"Chino, CA",2,38,1,2.0,12/4/2015,"So last week was my nephews birthday so me and my family decided to go out for dinner, and I must say this Apple bee's location sucked greatly! first off, the waiter sucked so bad, he took forever and was quite rude and rushed us into everything when taking our orders. He also refused to sing happy birthday to my little nephew who had turned 8,  when just a few minutes before a near by family was just paraded by a happy birthday singing session, which pissed me off.  I really felt like this location was very judgmental as well, lets just say that although there were diverse ethnicity , ours was the most ignored, or rudely answered, which really made me question their service! The food was also very sloppy."
Sandra G.,"Chino, CA",0,17,5,4.0,10/5/2016,My boyfriend loves coming here for the steak! Service is always great and food is tasty - just for the right price.
Rafael A.,"Upland, CA",316,567,492,4.0,11/16/2014,"My business partner and I have been coming to this Applebee's (off and on) for the better part of four years now.  We definitely prefer this one to all the others in the area (spanning La Puente to Rancho Cucamonga).  They have a great happy hour too! We always sit at the bar and love when either Jessica or Jason are working.  Those two are professionals who are friendly and engage customers with conversation.  They both know how to tend the bar and when they are working the bar together, there is never an empty glass around that area. Looking forward to our next visit (and the visits after that)."
Conner L.,"Yorba Linda, CA",47,8,,5.0,6/7/2016,I had a bartender named Miguel and it was far and above any service I've received from a bartender. He was courteous and was very informative and made great conversation. He treated me like a buddy from the moment I walked in and not just a customer.
Max M.,"Chino, CA",668,66,329,5.0,10/21/2014,"Probably the best Applebees around.  The main manager is such a nice guy. He's always there to make sure the customers are happy and will even help serve when the restaurant gets busy.  They have good happy hour deals. Plus, you can't go wrong with the 2 for $20 deal. Appetizer plus 2 entrees to share (or not if you have a big appetite like me) I've never had an issue with any of my food/drinks so I gotta give this place 5 stars."
Hugo M.,"Chino, CA",204,116,95,1.0,8/3/2015,"I've never had a bad experience here, but tonight was just bad. My girlfriend and I wanted to grab a quick bite before a movie. Well, first of all, I order their Lagunitas ""IPA"" and my girlfriend orders an ice tea. The serve drops off the drinks, we say ""thank you"", you would expect a ""you're welcome."" Nothing. We let it go.  We move on to our food. We decide to get simple stuff since we are in a hurry. I get their new pulled pork sandwich with fries and my girlfriend orders the Chicken Portobello with mashed potatoes. Simple right? Again, server just seems in a bad mood.  I then ask what type of Lagunitas the beer was, server tells me it's an IPA. My girlfriend, that is not a big fan of beer,  said that wasn't an IPA, it was a lager. I let it go since I had a couple sips of it and didn't want to waste time.  15 mins in, no food. 20 minutes in, no food. 30 mins in, no food. At this point we just want to go. We are about to miss our movie and our plans just got ruined. 35 minutes in, finally the food comes out. My girlfriends Chicken, does not come with mashed potatoes she asked for.  We finally talk to the manager. We just didn't want the food anymore. It wasn't worth the wait and for our plans to be ruined just made it worse. The manager was nice enough to remove the food from our checks. We did pay for the drinks since we did drink them. The manager told me that it was a different IPA, it was a lighter one. Never heard of that. Trust me, I know my IPAs. It was a lager.  One of the biggest reasons why I am writing this, it's because of our server, DEBRA C. This is not the first time we've got sat in her section. She just seems very angry and moody all the time. Is never polite and seems to do things in a bad mood. If I do come back, I will specifically ask NOT to be sat in her section. Some people may think I'm tough on her or just this whole experience, but it is what it is."
Jennifer E.,"San Dimas, CA",59,10,5,1.0,11/23/2016,"We came to this Applebee's because we don't really have an Applebee's close to us and haven't been able to go in a while. Well, the experience here was disappointing. First of all while coming back from the bathroom and walking back to my table a waitress that was serving a nearby table ran into me with the tray and the dishes she was holding and barely muttered sorry. She actually ran to me with the dishes. I thought it was kind of rude but I still tried to give them a chance. Another thing is they lie about the promotion they have about giving you a free dessert if they failed to mention having a holiday drink and mentioning about gift cards. Don't think that you will actually get a free dessert if your waitress or waiter does not mention these things. Are waitress mention the drink but did not mention the gift cards and my entire table was positive of this but when we asked her about our desserts and she did not mention buying a gift card, she totally lied and said that she had mentioned it when we are positive she didn't. At the end of the day I really could care less about the desert, it's just the principle of the entire matter. Don't offer something if you are not prepared to be honest in giving it away. Overall really disappointing experience and I would avoid this Applebee's"
Sam S.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,19,2,1.0,7/7/2016,Great location Great staff! Love their food this place is so underrated!
