Rob F.,"Chino, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/26/2016,"This was a horrible experience! I was in yesterday for dinner , we had a horrible server named Bri she was so busy talking with other co workers about gossip i had to get up and get my own drink from bar. Also food was dry and nasty! We will never visit this place again!"
Troy G.,"Cleveland, TN",0,3,,5.0,7/30/2016,"Came in for a typical late night drink and was presented with great service. Cheyne not only hooked me up with my needs from the bar, but he was very friendly and held a pleasant conversation. Thanks Applebee's!"

Jarrod M.,"Montclair, CA",127,192,342,3.0,3/27/2014,"Another restaurant that has been around for years. I like this place for two reasons.  Outdoor heated seating and great Happy Hours.  I do not regularly review food quality.  Everyone has different needs when it comes to flavors and spices.  Since I am all over the map pending on the time of day and mood, it will not help you the reader for me to give my impression. This place sells reheated frozen food.  I ordered a artichoke dip appetizer to compliment my beer.  While eating I found a nice chunk of artichoke heart.  I was excited.  It was like getting that single curly fry when you order regular fries.  It is an unexpected and pleasant surprise.   This chunk was not pleasant.  I expect that most readers have had a piece of food that had spent too much time in the freezer.  When thawed and cooked it has a slight flavor of the coolant used in refrigeration.  This chunk flooded my nostrils with freezer fumes.  Worse yet, the aroma lingered.  It killed my appetite for more.   This place still gets three stars.  The Manager, Joe? is a pleasant man who routinely checks on his guests.  The staff checked on me when they saw my class only had a 1/3 left of my beverage.  I was the only one on the patio and they did not forget about me.  I appreciate the attentiveness.   Go to an Applebee's for their Happy Hours.  They have two of them.  3-6pm and another from 9-12pm."
Erika L.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,61,296,5.0,7/10/2015,Great service and a great server Lupita she was great very attentive to us and recommended drinks and food  she was on it when the drinks were low she was ready to take our drink order   Nice staff and management went around to see if everything was fine with all customers
Jessy J.,"Chino, CA",0,19,2,1.0,5/29/2016,"I now understand why some people call you ""CRAPplebees"".. The most unsatisfying meal I ever had. My food was cold when I got it and my boyfriends ribs were burnt on the bottom and he was barely able to cut through them. Saw our waitress twice the whole visit. I've been a server before and I understand if your busy but the restaurant was empty.. I'm so glad I had a gift card and didn't actually have to pay for that trash. Ohhh maybe some advice promote the little blonde hostess because she's the only thing you have going your establishment."
Wendy Q.,"Phillips Ranch, CA",37,240,170,2.0,2/20/2015,"Craving French Onion Soup so we head to Applebee's. Waitress had 2 (maybe 3)tables and a bite your tongue attitude. I was friendly as always. Asked for lemon twice - no biggie. Soup regular price is $3.49. I asked to replace the potatoes with soup and she said it will be just $3.49 more.  hmmm, well now you want to keep my potatoes and charge me full price for soup. Nevermind. I said no thanks. Ordered 2 for $25 and upgraded to loaded mash that the menu says is $1.99 and the waitress said is $1.99. Was charged $2.49 and pointed out to waitress who said ""oh, umm, that must be the new price."" I said ""the menu shows $1.99."" I didn't even mention that SHE told me $1.99. She fixed it and returned saying ""the manager fixed it, but that's gonna be the new price the menu just doesn't  have the new prices yet."" Really? Come on man, yes, I know I'm finagling over 50 cents but don't come back and tell me I'm wrong, just so that you're right. I know we all have bad days but when you're working for a tip, don't tell the customer they're wrong. There went your tip as well as my return visit."
Sandra M.,"Chino, CA",54,6,,4.0,6/29/2016,"We come here often, and have pretty much tried most of thr menu. The good is good, tho it does depend who's cooking. I really love their salad, and they a good choice for sides now. Their sponach dip and wanton tacos are on point. I love the staff here, we always get super friendly waitress. There's not a lot of other places open late so this is a good option, and even when they start getting ready to close they dont rush you."
Patricia W.,"Chino Hills, CA",9,10,15,1.0,5/9/2016,"Looking for a different place to get a decent mixed drink...sadly this was not it.  Ordered a gin gimlet, horrible taste and served (gasp) on the rocks.  Tried a cosmo thinking I couldn't go wrong with that...weak and cloudy?  Boneless wings were glorified chicken nuggets with spicy gravy.  Not sure what that was about.   Spinach and artichoke dip was very heavy on the spinach.   On the up side,  our server Victoria provided excellent service.  She was attentive, polite and professional.  The gimlets were credited and we got coupons for a future visit.  Not sure we'll be back any time soon, although if you do come here,  Victoria is the server to ask for!"
Pedro F.,"Ontario, CA",40,297,176,4.0,6/30/2015,"I'll admit that I've never really given Applebee's a chance. But I saw some good menu options and said why not.  So glad that I did, my favorite is the All American Burger. It is so freaking good, almost rivals In n Out. Yeah, it's that good.  Service was good, no complaints."
Mary Anne V.,"Klamath Falls, OR",98,94,18,2.0,1/12/2016,My hubby ordered the salmon and asked for no sauce on top... Came out with sauce so he sent it back and they brought it back scraped off and flipped over... Waitress and manager took it off the bill. Can the cook get ANY more lazy or think we are stupid.. Sure made the restaurant look bad.
Lindsay D.,"Ontario, CA",33,29,17,3.0,1/19/2016,"Service was great! Food was mediocre. Ryan was our server, he made sure we got our food quickly. My dad's steak was messed up and he brought our a new one super fast. He even told us the score of the game, we could see the tvs just fine but none of us could see the score! Thanks Ryan!!"
Billie A.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,9,,1.0,4/23/2016,"Went to Applebee's tonight about 11:00 p.m. on Saturday, April 23, 2016. No hostess to greet us. A server came by and didn't even acknowledge us. Finally, after standing for a few minutes the hostess came and sat us down. Sat there for 5 minutes and the waiter finally came and said he would be right with us. Sat there for another 5 minutes and we finally got up and walked out. We went to Applebee's in Diamond a Bar  and was greeted and seated immediately. It's sad that we had to leave the city that we live in to get good customer service."
P S.,"Chino Hills, CA",1,10,4,5.0,10/8/2016,Friendly staff that greeted us promptly and gave us a realistic estimate for wait.  They meet all expectations.  Waitress was friendly and responded quickly to our needs.  Food was tasty and hot!  Completely enjoyed the experience!
Mario M.,"Chino, CA",0,5,,4.0,10/31/2016,"Me and my son went over there for dinner,we had an appetizer and two meals for 35 bucks,the service was great."
Veronica P.,"Chino, CA",0,18,5,4.0,3/18/2016,"My boyfriend and I celebrated St. Patrick's Day here, and we really enjoyed it. It wasn't too packed which was nice. We got seated within 5 minutes and enjoyed our dinner and drinks. I have a corona margarita which I loved, my boyfriend had one of their St. Patrick's Day drinks and he said it was ok."
Rynn D.,"Long Beach, CA",11,6,6,1.0,3/10/2016,"Waited 5 minutes for a host to get seated, during that time 5 servers looked over at me and my wife and two daughters without even asking or calling host to have us seated. We decided to leave and eat next door at Island which was a much better contrast in customer service."
Fabian M.,"Chino, CA",6,14,6,5.0,10/1/2014,"2 for $20 all day, everyday.  I would get the 2 for $20 for myself if I could.  Oh, and their wings are better than Buffalo Wild Wings, Wingstop, Hooters, etc. Not even kidding."
Lester P.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,14,11,5.0,8/30/2016,"I came on 8/30/2016, and if you are unique like me, you want the secret menu, so I asked  bartender Cheyne about it and he gave me Cheyne fries, no regrets ""period""."
