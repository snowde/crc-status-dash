Roehl A.,"Chino Hills, CA",282,315,1353,4.0,7/29/2011,"This is by far the best Applebees I'm California.  I could be biased because it's our local joint but they make the best Perfect Margarita. We usually go after 9PM when drinks are $5 instead of $9. We also love the Sam Adams on tap, twisted potato twisters with queso blanco, veggie patch pizza, and the sizzling Asian shrimp. Yum!"
Ale A.,"Pomona, CA",85,22,6,2.0,6/1/2016,"First of all, let me start by saying that we walked in and there was no greeter, so we waited. After seeing Noone, we sat ourselves. (Group of 7). Our waiter, a Caucasian older fellow, had to go be called, because there was no waiter around. We had no menus at our table. Waiter comes back with them... Afterwords, we ordered our drinks, dude came back with our drinks wrong, he left, came back, drinks were wrong again!. Anyway, we order our food, appetizer, dude comes back but guess what? We have no forks no spoons no napkins we had to ask twice for them he took a while and I noticed he was one of the only waiters. That, is bad managing why so limited waiters? We had just started eating and he comes with our total! That came quick!  Like what the hell? We just started cause you just came back with forks! We're huge foodies, we loved the food but really bad managing and customer service. We're debating returning."
Salvador Z.,"Pomona, CA",0,7,1,1.0,2/14/2016,"Nastiest steaks ever. First they're cooked, then grilled to deceive people that they just came out of the grill. Applebee's go to BJ's kitchen to learn how to properly grill a steak!"
Juan V.,"Chino, CA",38,2,1,1.0,2/12/2016,Poor excuses for my food not being ready. They told me the fryer was down when I ordered a salad !!!clearly the manager uses that excuse for every occasion won't come here again .. Manager didn't even try resolve my problem .. If the fryer was down than why were other ppl getting their food first .. Visit 2-12-16 apple bees in chino ca of grand ave
Rochelle P.,"Chino, CA",32,9,,5.0,5/15/2015,Always eat at this place. Great selection for the two for twenty.  Sitting at the bar we get pretty great service but every time we are at a table the we have to keep asking for refills and it take forever. Other then that the food is great.  Managers come to check up on tables. Would recommend
Adrian T.,"Walnut, CA",16,17,3,1.0,5/29/2016,"We have been coming to Applebee's for the past three years and everything has been good so far. But this night was different, it was not even busy. My girlfriend is diabetic and pregnant, so she has to count everything and be careful what she eats. She ordered the Caesar side salad without croutons and salad dressing on the side and her steak well done. The salad first came with croutons and covered in Caesar dressing, then it was taken back, then it had returned with the croutons removed but still drenched in dressing, finally on the 3rd try it had come back correctly. Now when the steak came it was medium rare, we asked them to cook it a little more, then when it came back it was still medium rare, again on the 3rd try it had come back finally correct. We do not think it was the servers fault because she correctly repeated it in the beginning. This was not just about service, this was about my girlfriend and my unborn child's health."
Melody C.,"Chino, CA",0,11,,2.0,2/5/2016,We came here for my mothers birthday and usually they are good but not today. Our food was awful and dry. They never gave us refills on our drinks so we were all done eating and super thirsty. We also told our waitress to do a birthday dessert and by the time it got here we were ready to leave. Please get it together guys. My mothers birthday could've been way better.
Mrs. A.,"Ontario, CA",0,114,25,4.0,10/26/2015,Service was great.  Monday night $6.99 burgers were delicious.  Incredibly cheap date night!
Hannah T.,"Ventura, CA",0,3,,5.0,2/23/2016,"I went into this Applebee's with my mom. It was pretty busy and they had one server serving. So the guy from the bar came and took our order and got our drinks. He was so kind and very professional. He was running all around the restaurant taking orders and getting refills, but every time he came to a table he was so polite and very professional. The food was good as well. But why I gave it a 5star was because of Miguel the bar tender. Very friendly."
Mike D.,"Chino, CA",2,15,7,5.0,8/21/2014,"Well, I've been coming here for years, on and off. I have to say the management and staff are first class. Brian the bartender is a real kick and really loves people and sports. The food is really good, for this type of food chain, I like the way they keep changing items to make it even better. HH is always a good time."
Bob F.,"Chino, CA",52,3,1,5.0,8/29/2014,Service and food was great as always.  GM Andrew has this place running on all cylinders and you can't go wrong here!
Patricia J.,"Chino Hills, CA",185,5,1,1.0,8/5/2015,They really need to do something about all those flies flying around while you're eating your food!!
Karla O.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,31,4,1.0,11/28/2015,"Worst service ever! Don't come here unless u like beers that consist of half foam and fat waiters that make excuses for everything. He wouldn't honor hPpy hour prices because we ordered a couple of minutes before 3 and when we complained about our beers he said that's the standard way to pour. Really fat old guy with glasses?! I was a bartender and I would have never poured half a pint of foam, ever!!! No such standard and a poor excuse on your part - we didn't order food and left didn't want to continue this experience ! Avoid this place at all costs - headed to Tahoe joes now :)"
E G.,"Chino Hills, CA",6,48,17,4.0,3/1/2016,"This is another perfect example of a place that is not getting the credit it deserves. Hear me out, I'll tell you why I think this is true.  In all honesty, Applebee's franchise as a whole is pretty alright. It's not gonna wow you, but for what it is, it's pretty decent. I came back a couple times recently these past few weeks and again today. Prior to that I came here years ago, and in that time gap, they improved on their previous flaws. Like 3 to 4 stars inproved. How? The menu from what I remember has been simplified I believe, correct me if I'm wrong. There seems to be less stuff, granted there is still a lot of stuff to choose from, but i remember there being more. But what sacrificed for quantity, they made up for quality. The steak was actually cooked somewhat to my liking, I asked for medium rare, and it was medium/medium rare ish. Compared to last time and other franchises that serve steak you ask medium and it's well done. So props for Applebee's on that.  French onion soup had decent flavor, veggies tasted good, and the service is still really good. The waiters and waitresses are still nice and attentive.  Ok now the part that bugs me, and what I think is wrong with media, this site, and how are culture is today. I've seen other people's reviews on this place, like many others, I see there 1 star reviews... ok why. In the reviews I see positive things and people say ""good food,"" ""great service,"" ""overall good expeience,"" etc... then I see a 1 star review.... I see the flaws also and I can agree with them, but don't give places like that a 1 star. 1 stars are like worst of the worst, no redeeming quality whatsoever. Nothing good. Hense 1. If there are some redeeming or good things, fine give it a 2 or even a 3 stars. So it's fair. That's the problem, it just takes 1 mistake and ""yup, 1 star."" People today complain about the smallest things that I feel like they'll find anything to complain about even if it's something so small. Guys, be fair, if there is some good quality for it, then show it. Otherwise you'll be like me, reading other reviews and be like, ""ok if this place has good food and decent ambiance, why did it get a 1?"" That's like a teacher saying, ""oh your report on this subject matter was entertaining and I found it interesting.... F."" Wth?  If you don't like it here, fine you don't have to, it's fine.  But don't say some things are good and all of a sudden the end result is the worst grade ever. If that's the case, don't say anything nice at all if you're gonna give a place a 1 star. 2 or 3 fine, that means there's  ""some"" redeeming quality somewhere. But for me, my experiences have been good, if anything improved. 4 stars."
Chrisi F.,"Ontario, CA",0,19,14,3.0,8/30/2014,Yummy wonton chicken tacos.  All you can eat cross cut ribs not so yummy.  Service on Patio horrible I had to finally get up and ask of we had a server and the hostess down us at a dirty table then proceeded to wipe it off with us sitting down kinda creepy.  Usually the food is amazing but today we were disappointed.  Good place for kids.. the radio was so loud outside we were the only ones out there
Marisa G.,"Riverside, CA",87,18,3,5.0,12/4/2015,Had a fabulous time like always Scott our server was a doll very kind n fast..the host was also very nice opened the door for my friend and i like a gentlemen
Gary O.,"Port Hueneme, CA",12,32,18,5.0,3/26/2015,"I had a very pleasant experience at Applebee,s. I hadn't been back in 10 years, but after today's meal, and service, I would definitely come back. The service was great, from the guy that greeted me at the door, to the girl that served us. Had a cool, touch screen monitor at table that can be used to order. And the food was perfect. Definitely, would recommend the pepper crusted sirloin meal. Great price, service, and amazing food. Thumbs up."
Dwigt J.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,8,,4.0,7/3/2016,"Had not been to Applebee's in forever, but decided to give it a shot today.   First of all the service was AWESOME!!! Everyone  from the host to the server were super friendly and that doesn't come easy on a busy afternoon.  We had our pup and they made sure she had water and very friendly as well to her.  The food was pretty good too and we will definitely come back to this location in the near future.  THANK YOU!!"
John H.,"Chino, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/26/2015,"The food here is very good!  My wife and I enjoy the Two-for Twenty specials as well. My chief complaint is about the ambience -- which I rate as being extremely poor. It is also easy to fix, but the management there simply refuses to address the issue.  This is the problem: We go there to enjoy an affordable meal and to talk with each other...we can't enjoy a conversation  because  1) THE BACKGROUND MUSIC IS EXCESSIVELY LOUD! We, sitting across the table from each other, are forced to compete with the loud speakers placed in the ceiling every 10 feet or so. Secondly, 2) POOR PLAYLIST SELECTION!  Instead of playing mostly instrumental music (i.e., classical, smooth jazz) which would be pleasant, pleasing, and conducive to conversation, they always play HARD ROCK stuff with lots of annoying lyrics!  You can barely hear yourself think with that crap going at high volume in the background. Never is there any quieter instrumental music being played.  I have spoken with the manager in the past (2-3 years) concerning this, but nothing has changed. He gives some bs-line about how the corporation sets the background music selection and volume...and he's not allowed to modify it. I think that's a real cop-out!   The good news is this: I don't have to spend my meal times there!"
Theresa B.,"Chino, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/29/2016,amazing customer service our server was very sweet and cheerfull and checked on us often to make sure all was well its not often my husband and i get time to ourselves and lunch here was definately worth it thankyou foer the amazing service
