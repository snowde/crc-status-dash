Christopher S.,"Dunedin, FL",219,518,839,4.0,9/5/2017,"Reluctantly, I agreed to meet Gig & Mommy here for lunch. I was so worried I wouldn't find anything to eat that was under 1000+ calories. Truly, their menu is way over healthy options BUT I was able to get a great Chicken Tortilla Soup @ 180cal and a Caesar Salad for 230cal. Happy Boy! My BOC was an unsweetened tea Arnold Palmer! We sat near the bar and the Bartender/server was polite, friendly, and impressed Gigi. She usually tells me to tip good or bad! Everything was good. Gigi loved her Three-Cheese Chicken Cavatappi! Thank goodness she only ate half of that 1280cal dish!  Bottom line is I would go back for a soup and salad or their Lighter Fare which ranges from Thai Shrimp Salad @390cal to a 700cal Caprese Mozzarella Chicken. I've already decided to try their Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken @580cal . So, Applebee's, you're trying and I appreciate that! See ya soon. ;-)"
Rebecca F.,"Waterford Township, MI",45,38,7,1.0,11/13/2017,Alas $1 Margaritas and bahama mamas an't save Applebees.  After having written off Applebees after so many disappointing or downright awful dinners when my boyfriend asked me where I wanted to go to dinner last night I said Applebees.  Good grief why would I want to go to Appplebees when there are many other much better places to eat? Dollaritas. After a long week of working overtime everynight I wanted to relax with some margaritas. Ordered the 2 for $20 with spinach dip and we both ordered the new whisky bbq burgers. The waitress suggested that we order the sauce on the side because some people think it tastes like cement...the waitress said that. Uh Ok...we ordered the sauce on the side.  The spinach dip app came out and it was laughably tiny. The dip was in a small condiment sized cup and there were about as many chips as comes in a lunch box size bag of lays. In the past it was served with a small cup of salsa but not this time. Then the burgers came out with no sauce like we ordered but also with zero toppings. Per the picture of the burger on the menu it was supposed to have onion straws on it and the usual burger toppings. So we were served plain burgers. We waited for the sauce to come...and waited...and waited. The waitress came over to us 3 times and said that she had asked the kitchen for the sauce but they hadnt given it her.  Finally 10 mins after our plain burgers arrived with no sauce and no topping my boyfriend just starts eating his. I was still waiting and after 15 minutes I gave up on on the meal. I ak the waitress to please send the manager over who said the burgers shouldnt have beem served to us like that and took off my portion of the 2 of $20. But still good grief Applebees...
Kathy J.,"Clearwater, FL",8,37,12,5.0,12/31/2017,"We have ate here many times and it has always been great! All these negative reviews are because many people expect it to be the cheese cake factory or something. It's Applebees folks! Bathroom is always clean, food is alright and price is just right!"
Sarah B.,"Spokane, WA",1,46,25,1.0,12/1/2017,"First off, Tanner was a fun and friendly server during our visit, and our food was all delicious. I give both of those 5 stars. However we had a clear view of the bar and it was not good. We had been ordering the Dollar LITs, but stopped after we noticed the bartender, who I don't want to name drop, but I have her name (long brunette ponytail), was dipping used mugs in the cleaning solution under the counter and immediately repouring drinks in them. Now, it's been awhile since I worked in food service, but it's absolutely unacceptable to simply dip any food or drink container in solution for 2-3 seconds and reuse it. It's not nearly enough time for sanitization and skips a few procedures, not to mention the glass not even having a chance to dry."
Joshua C M.,"Tampa, FL",131,79,28,2.0,6/22/2017,"Two stars because the service was good and I liked the option to ""swipe"" your card right at your table. This was a we've been moving furniture all day and we need food stat stop...food is just as awful as I remember and decor didn't appear to change at all and I think it's been at least 3/4 years since I set foot in a Applebee's"
David B.,"Palm Harbor, FL",2,192,6,4.0,6/17/2017,"We have come here many times, this time we came in around 1pm & the place was packed. I think they were a little under staffed. There was no hostess when we got there because she was to busy cleaning. Olivia was our server & had just transferred from another store but did pretty good. We had mozz sticks, boneless (all you can eat) special & a margarita. All was ok,     We have never really experienced a problem here & it is close to home."
Hollie D.,"Rooseveltown, NY",0,4,,2.0,7/23/2017,"We don't go to Applebee's that often, but last night was the second time we've been seated where the floor was covered with food, broken crackers, etc.  I don't care how busy a restaurant might be, why would you seat customers before quickly running the carpet sweeper  - it only takes a minute.  We don't eat under those conditions at home so why would we pay to eat out that way? We ordered the 2 dinners for $25 which came with a choice of appetizer.  We chose tortillas with spinach/artichoke dip.  It was delicious but the amount of dip was half what you would need to accommodate all the chips & we were trying to use it sparingly but still ran out so I asked our server if we could have ""alittle"" more.  She said sure but we never got it until after our meals arrived so she said she'd wrap it up to go.  I guess I should have said no thanks since we had wanted it before our meals, not after  - didn't think about it. Dinners were good but when we got the bill & my husband saw they had charged us an extra $8 for the dip, he wasn't happy.  All we wanted was a small amount more to finish our chips with  - we wanted it before our dinners . . . also, the server could have & we felt she ""should have"" told us we would have to pay $8 more to get additional dip.  She basically said we should have known we'd be charged extra . . . should we have known?   Since they didn't give us enough for the amount of chips we had, maybe they should cut back on the portion of chips.  AND if a customer requests more dip, maybe it would be nice to let him know of the additional charge.  Isn't  $8 alittle much besides & if she couldn't get it to us before our dinners, she could have said that might happen as our dinners would be out soon. So a very long story short about ""alittle dip"", we won't be going back right away."
Angela B.,"Clearwater, FL",37,41,186,3.0,10/14/2016,"Average, you may get a super bubbly server from time to time.... I think their food quality is improving as well. What can I say they are open late, have a little bit of everything, and reasonably priced."
Duane D.,"Clearwater, FL",77,554,211,3.0,2/1/2016,What can you say?  Typical Applebees that seemed to be well-run and had friendly staff.  Food is consistent and predictable. The Tuesday night burger deal is a good one -- any burger on their menu for $6.99.
Jason B.,"Holiday, FL",31,109,71,1.0,5/26/2016,"So let's start off by saying this was the WORST AppleBee's experience from here to Seattle we've ever had, maybe even one of the worst restaurant experience's ever. I usually try not to give one star reviews, but this one needs mention.   We arrive and were seated promptly. Our server Chelsea shows up few minutes later, and takes our order, and gives us her best fake smile the few times she stops by throughout the next hour we were there.    I ordered Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp with garlic mash, and a steak quesadilla app. The steak was very little, dry, and not good. My chicken arrived with half of a burnt mushroom and a lot of grilled onions. I asked Chelsea if this was supposed to have mushrooms like the picture, and she said yes, and gave me a fake smile. She returned 15 minutes later with a small plate of six mushroom slices which weren't cooked all the way. By this time my chicken was totally dried out and my garlic mash was cold when it arrived, so the whole meal was a disaster. I asked for extra shrimp on top of my chicken when I first ordered it, and I got a total of 7 shrimp, which I was charged $4.49 for the ""extra shrimp"".    My fiance ordered the new Cedar Grilled Salmon and Chicken Won Ton Tacos app. The chicken was burnt little cubes inside a taco shell, and the Salmon was dry as could be. After Chelsea collected our plates she asked my fiance ""the Salmon wasn't good was it?"" and gave another fake smile as she walked away. So much for the e-mail I received from Applebee's today, asking me to try their ""NEW WOOD GRILLED MENU"", what a joke.   Usually we have a manager stop by our table at the other locations, but I didn't even see one once while we were here. While Chelsea collected my plate and silverware as she dropped the check off, she dropped my knife onto my leg at the table. We usually stop by the New Port Richey location, but thought we'd try this location since it was closer, what a mistake this was. I popped an e-mail to corporate when I got home. $47.17 for garbage!"
Nevik N.,"Palm Harbor, FL",7,51,39,4.0,4/6/2016,"Service here is always pretty good. Most of them will do what they can to make sure you're satisfied.  Food here is honestly a hit or miss situation. At times it could be finger licking good, or a ""wtf is this"" moment."
Peter B.,"Palm Harbor, FL",89,172,120,2.0,1/10/2015,"We have been going to this restaurant for years.  Lately, we've noticed the salads are not cold and the lettuce is wilted. Wife and I ate it anyway.  Big mistake! When we got home, our stomachs were rumbling.  Needless to say, we did not keep our meal.       Service here is always good.  But this experience just knocked Applebee's off our food radar."
Judi N.,"Buford, GA",0,6,,1.0,8/20/2016,"This Applebee's is not well run.  We never saw a manager...i would have told him/her about getting a green butt end of an inedible tomato on my burger; the sweet potato fries for which I paid extra came out so overdone I could snap them in half.  I got a new order after my meal was over.  Gee, I wonder why the manager never stopped by.  They have lost me and my friends as customers."
Dianna B.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",847,2344,2388,3.0,6/18/2014,"I usually REALLY like Applebee's. But this time, the resturant fell flat.  Mom and I came here for lunch before going to Joanne's fabric and crafts.  We ordered an appetizer of the beercheese bread sticks before our mains.  When it came to the table, I noticed that the cheese was unmelted, so I tried to stir it into the gloop and see if that made any difference. Sadly it did not. The sauce was cold.. like someone didn't even TRY to heat it up. Mom and I both ate a bread stick while I tried my darnedest to flag down my server, but the server was handling so many different tables. When she finally came to me to see what was going on, I pointed it out and she took it away, letting me know she was going to make it right. Shortly, our mains came out and those were ok.  A few minutes later the Manager came over and apologized - he said that the appetizer was on him. At least this time the cheeze was crusted and piping hot, even if we didn't get to eat it because our food was with us now.  Over all, it wasn't a great experience, but they made it right."
Pernell S.,"St. Petersburg, FL",23,2,,2.0,6/2/2016,Came here to celebrate my nephew graduation.  However the piss poor service and lethargic oh hum attitude displayed by the staff  oddly reminiscent of Denny's.  Avoid this establishment like the plague.
Ashley S.,"Tampa, FL",45,23,5,5.0,8/31/2015,Good as always with Matt working the bar!! Thanks for the great food and service! I'll be back again
Mark H.,"Elfers, FL",61,1531,5405,5.0,6/2/2013,"Hat's off to this location!  We stopped in at the Oldsmar (Tampa Rd.) location last night, and were given the cold shoulder.  The bartender, not only ignored us, but immediately greeted and handed a beer to new-comer at the bar before even making eye contact with us.  So when he finally did acknowledge us, we just told him he was inattentive and we left.  About 10 minutes later, we landed at this location in Palm Harbor.  These people were on the ball.  They greeted us, took our order and had the food out in the time it took just to get a ""how are you?"" from the Oldsmar location.  Totally different experience!  In fact, we told the bartender about what happened in Oldsmar, and her and the manager offered us a free desert for the trouble.  We kindly declined the offer, but the gesture was awesome.  Hands down, the best Applebee's experience on record for us, and we eat at them all the time. Bonus customer delight was that each eating area, even at the bar, has a point of sale terminal where you can visually see your order, pay and tip right on the screen.  Ingenious."
Gigi S.,"New Port Richey, Tampa Bay, FL",271,654,1073,4.0,6/19/2013,"I'm absolutely convinced that Applebees is underrated because people are ""doing it wrong"". If this cool, clean, location with kick ass service isn't enough to convince you, then you have got to order the food correctly. I'd suggest going during half off app times, sitting at the bar where the service is attentive, up in the managers face and can't possibly go wrong. (unlike the Oldsmar location) Order off the menu apps..like the VEGGIE PATCH PIZZA which isn't listed, but is their best app. Not a vegetarian? That's ok, I'm a confirmed carnivore and I swear by this pizza. For example: The potato twisters look great, BUT it's scientifically impossible for them to turn out like ribbon fries from the fair, and that's a well-tested fact. Stick to the delectable sliders and fries, the saucy wings, and don't complain about taste if you ordered a weight watchers meal. Thems is the ropes, kid."
Genie M.,"Palm Harbor, FL",1,30,1,4.0,3/24/2016,"Stopped in for quick cocktails with some friends after a workout... (I know, doesn't make sense, right), and had good service at the bar area. 2 for 1 drinks, not too bad. Server was quiet at first but then she warmed up to us."
Dan G.,"Tampa, FL",601,64,39,3.0,1/8/2016,The Bourbon Street chicken was good. Too much oil though. The worse part of the entire evening was the French Onion soup. I mention to the manager that it should be called French soup since there weren't any onions in it. He offer me another bowl. Another bowl of the same crappy soup. The service was OK. I don't expect much from Applebees since it is a bar. The manager just came by and took off the French Onion soup off the bill. I may stop by here again and I will have the French Onion soup again and if its any better I will revise my review.
Barry B.,"Clearwater, FL",0,3,,1.0,9/11/2016,"We stopped here on Saturday Sept. 10 th around 3: 30, so the restaurant was not especially busy. The server was terrible , after our food was delivered she was no where in site in the dinning area, did not come to ask us how our food came out nor did she ever offer refills on our drinks. Ordered the 6 oz sirloin , bake potato, and fire grilled veggies . The only thing edible was the bake potato. Was not offered a steak knife the butter knife could not cut the steak as it was so hard! The veggie was a hunk of zucchini about 2.5 inches thick as well as a hunk of squash about the same thickness, neither one was cooked enough to eat. When looking for our server, nowhere to be found, asked another server to ask ours to come over, did not happen, asked another server if the manager was available, he came over, but found later he was not the manger when another gentleman did come by and said he was the manager, told him the problem he offered to have another meal done by that time I was truly disgusted with that place, said no thanks, I would rather stop at subway for a sandwich ,keep in mind all this time my server no where to be found, when she did show up I asked her where have. You been, her answer in the back.guess once they take your order they are done with you. Never back there again!! Besides all that cleanliness was not a top priority there."
Dana S.,"Tampa, FL",5,8,,1.0,8/26/2015,I've been to many Applebees restaurants and decided to order to go from this location. BIG mistake. My food was not prepared by the time I arrived to pick it up. I don't even mind waiting a few minutes for some delicious food but when I arrived home and inspected the order I was thoroughly disappointed! They gave me 1/2 an entree while I had paid full price for it..12.99 for half the food.. The worst part was that all of my food was cold. ALL of it. Not just a little warm (cooling down) due to the 10 minute drive home--COLD! The beer cheese dip for the appetizer felt like it was thawing out from being in the freezer! I've never been so unhappy about spending my money on poor service. Ordering to go should not alter the quality of the meal because it didn't alter the price. I will never go back to this location.
Jesse C.,"Palm Harbor, FL",9,25,10,5.0,9/7/2015,Michelle was fab!  Our curbside was ready hot and waiting!  Sorry for all the bad reviews for this location but my experience was perfect !
Jimmy B.,"Clearwater, FL",39,62,5,5.0,8/8/2015,"This Applebee's is the best one of its franchise! Great customer service, great food,great ambience! One of my favorites in Clearwater area!"
Pete M.,"Tampa, FL",5,4,1,2.0,9/4/2015,Slammed on a Friday night. Looked like maybe 4 waiters covering the whole place. Waited 15 mins for drinks and 20 for appetizers. Food was decent.
Patti R.,"New Port Richey, FL",15,13,4,4.0,9/16/2014,Alicia the server and Mark the manager are very friendly  My friend and I did the 2 for $20 We started out with chicken wonton She had bourbon shrimp and chicken  I had  chicken penne We both rate our food as 10 's!!! We will be back !!
Amanda D.,"Palm Harbor, FL",63,49,36,3.0,4/26/2014,"Very good service late night.  Food is standard American fare, lots of fried and prepackaged and super salty stuff.  I don't go here often because of that, but it's good for late night and I'll eat just about anything with their mexi-ranch sauce.   Had the quesadilla burger for the first time tonight.  The tortilla had a nice crisp crunch to it, burger was nicely pink, tasty cheese, tomato and sauce toppings.  I was impressed that the tortilla was not greasy or soggy.  Management was good.  Checked on us when we walked in and then a couple times during our meal.  I've been here for late lunch during the week and haven't gotten nearly the same service though.   So, all in all, I give them an average rating for the type of restaurant it is."
Phil P.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",19,17,,1.0,9/7/2015,"Bad service overpriced beer and mediocre food.. A real Trifecta!! Then a manger comes over and says "" sorry got kind of crazy in here"" there was no rush, as in large group coming in, matter-of-fact I believe there was even fewer people in there then when I got there. So... Where is the crazy? Somebody break a glass?"
Evelynn P.,"Clearwater, FL",1,10,11,5.0,9/29/2015,Always had great friendly service at this location. They have karaoke and live dj Wednesday nights. Food is good never had a problem there. Can't beat half off appetizers after 10! Usually there's a manager making rounds asking if you're happy and satisfied. Can get really busy some nights. Popular location.
Dalton S.,"Orlando, FL",11,7,,2.0,10/19/2014,"The service was fine and friendly. However the caesar salad I ordered was very wet, the dressing was the consistency of water. As my entree I ordered the Bourbon St. steak medium rare. Upon slicing the steak open it was cooked well done. The waitress took it away to be remade, as she did she said ""you know the skillet usually cooks it all the way"". I know she had good intentions but it left me feeling like I didn't have the right to be disappointed about my steak not being properly cooked, as if to say it were my fault."
Kim B.,"Clearwater, FL",0,1,,4.0,9/10/2015,Went here last week with my family. Wonderful. Had a great meal all around even had dessert!! I would def.go here again.
Tracey M.,"Oakland, FL",198,157,302,3.0,10/17/2011,"I didn't want to go to Applebees when we decided to meet up there with another family. Normally I hate these types of chain restaurants. I was surprised with how decent it was.  Maybe it was the 2 for 1 beers (Octoberfest) and the fajita's were not bad. All in all, for the money we  had a decent meal with a good atmosphere to hang out and the kids were happy too."
Lane R.,"Dunedin, FL",53,118,4,2.0,1/8/2013,"I supposed I should preface by saying I don't make a habit of going to Applebee's but for some reason people keep giving us gift cards here.  On this trip our food was decent, but the establishment continues to go downhill in my book. We had a gift card for over a year and needed a quick bite to eat so we headed on over to Applebee's. I am continually unimpressed with their mixed drinks so I stuck with water this time. We did order the new pretzel sticks and while they were good they didn't taste like pretzels. They were fried with a cheese dipping sauce. Not exactly what I was imagining when I ordered them. My husband and I each ordered a burger. I wish they had more burgers on the menu because they are actually pretty good. I don't like that you can only order them pink or no pink though... umm what does that even mean? I'm scared to order no pink because I don't want it burned to a crisp. The fries would be decent, but holy salt. They were so salty. Our meals did take a while to come out so I'm glad we ordered that pretzel appetizer. Our service was strange, we had one server when we arrived and then another one randomly showed up at our table to take our order with no explanation. Then our other server came back after food was delivered to check on us and refill our drinks. I extremely dislike the new monitors they have placed on the table. You are able to order and pay on them, also play games and other things. Are they going to get rid of servers next?  The best part of our visit though was the show, half way through our dinner someone at a table nearby threw a drink on their dining partner... I'm not even joking folks apparently this doesn't just happen in the movies. Stay classy Applebee's. Thankfully we have used up our gift cards and hopefully given hints that we don't want anymore. Overall quite the interesting experience..."
Barbara C.,"New Port Richey, FL",26,2,,1.0,1/6/2014,"Came here for a nice lunch, the hostess was to busy chatting up her BF to acknowledge anyone and after ordering from the gluten free menu the manger informs us they have nothing on the gluten free menu. What a nightmare this Applebee's is the only and I stress only good thing about this place was our server Brandy who tried so hard to make the experience a good one.....Hey Applebee's maybe you could employ managers who understand and enforce great customer service. Not ever coming back Chili's will be my go to place from now on!"
Justin A.,"Palm Harbor, FL",38,8,,4.0,12/30/2014,Food was great took a bit to get to the table but was amazing great customer service great environment didn't feel pressured to leave
Laura F.,"Oldsmar, FL",16,56,9,3.0,11/21/2012,"We typically go to the Oldsmar Applebees, and this one only as a second option. We came with a group of friends after my husband's softball game and they all wanted to go to this location. Unfortunately we found out that this Applebees only offers 1/2 off appetizers after 10pm, where our Oldsmar location has them after 9pm. Too bad we found this out at 9:15pm after we had already ordered drinks. My sister and I both prefer to just drink water when we eat, not because we don't want to pay for drinks, but because that's what we prefer. This Applebees location isn't very accommodating when it comes to purchasing half off appetizers with a water to drink - they require you to buy an actual drink. I can understand this rule, but they get a little crazy about it. On a previous visit, I ordered water and my husband ordered a Pepsi, and I was told that I couldn't get half off appetizers, even though my husband and I were on the same check - so I had to order a drink that I didn't even touch. When it came around to my sister and her boyfriend ordering, my sister just said she wasn't getting anything, and her boyfriend (who had ordered a soda) ordered both of their half off appetizers - and this was okay. I just don't think that's very customer friendly to push it so far, especially when one person on our check was getting a drink and could have ordered both of our appetizers.  I come from a customer service job, and I know what it takes to keep our customers happy and coming back - and this Applebees pushes it too far. In the future, I don't plan on coming back to this location since I've had two bad experiences and no help making my visits better by the service."
nicoletta m.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",9,17,4,1.0,4/4/2011,"Went to dinner with my Mom and sister after an exhausting shopping trip at countryside mall, we were seated pretty quickly, but took 15 minutes for a drink, then another 15 to place an order. I'm familiar with the restaurant business , worked in one for years, so i know about service. My mom and i ordered two different shrimp plates, she had pineapple glazed and i had the burbon street, hers came out cold , mine came out tasting like nothing. my sister ordered a salad with salmon on top, her salmon was raw, we eat sushi but this was horrible. I understand it's not our servers fault, but she didnt come back soon enough . Luckily for her im always a 20% tipper, she didn't cook the food, can;t hold it against her, but it's a shame , used to go there for drinks on a regular basis and now i dont think id be going back"
Bob H.,"St. Petersburg, FL",15,19,7,2.0,4/17/2014,"Went here with a group of 10 at around 8:30 pm on a Wednesday. They did not deliver the food together, one of our party didn't receive their food until 10 minutes after. I would avoid this Applebee's of you want good service"
Jule B.,"Palm Harbor, FL",0,1,,5.0,12/17/2012,"Ate here this evening about 7, with my wife and granddaughter (10) . I had the Grilled Jalapeno Lime Shrimp plate, my wife and my granddaughter had the 2 for $20 sirloin steaks and mozzarella sticks.  It was all great.  It's a Monday night, not crowded, and we were seated immediately. Waitress (I think it was Krystin) was super, gave just excellent service.  I was impressed with the new small monitor on the table that you could swipe your credit card on, order food, play games, and pay your bill with.  Really made it quick. Can't wait to go back on a Friday night when it's crowded and use it.  The receipt is emailed to you if you want.  First restaurant I've seen with this."
Mic V.,"Tampa, FL",0,3,,2.0,1/11/2014,I love applebees ...been going for years to a couple locations   where I just recently  moved up from now living in west chase Tampa I go frequently to the one on Sheldon & linebaugh and recently now to this location (palm harbor) where it is  conveniently close to work so after work I can pop in to unwine but the last couple times I was bothered by management to where I was parking for different reasons but notice it was OK for applebees employees to park in the same spot. I will continue going if they allow me after this review lol because its so convient and bar service is great especially shavonne ....don't think I'll be going today after work because I was bothered first thing in.the morning and this is why im even writing a negative review which I never do ....so bottom line I will still be patron just not as much but I wont park in that spot anymore so your employees can ....
