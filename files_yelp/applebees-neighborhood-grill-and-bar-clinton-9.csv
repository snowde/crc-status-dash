Johnny P.,"Osawatomie, KS",0,16,27,3.0,11/5/2017,Typical Applebees. Nothing special here. Food is good. Service is ok.  Just location to hotel makes it an easy choice when getting something late for dinner.
Vic J.,"West Des Moines, IA",3,68,33,1.0,10/24/2017,Terrible service. Waited 15 minutes after being seating without anyone coming over.  What a difference from the great service I received yesterday.
Kenneth L.,"Livingston, NJ",12,13,1,3.0,10/16/2017,"I travel a lot and for the past four years have eaten at the Applebee's in Clinton Iowa two - four times a month. The food is good and typical of what you would expect. Customer service is fine. Of late I've  noticed this trend to speed feed you. I understand the need to turn tables but tonight 10/16 was ridiculous. When I arrived at 5 pm I was the only the second customer in the restaurant. I ordered soup, salad, and a burger. All three came out simultaneously. Not wanting the soup and burger to get cold I ate them first.  The word for this visit was indigestion. I was literally done at 5:20. Too fast.  This is now the second time I've been speed fed.  Come on guys. Slow down."
Brandon P.,"Omaha, NE",0,9,,4.0,8/2/2017,"This is your typical Applebee's I normally roll through this restaurant on business trips and the service is average. Their credit card machine was down this evening and they were having to run everything manually, which was a pain and slowed service down. My beer didn't come until after my food came."
Ron A.,"Clinton, IA",0,3,,3.0,5/29/2017,"Order the chicken strip platter and onion rings for an appetizer. They all came out looking like the oil had not been changed, very dark and not very good flavor. This is not what I would expect from here."
Melinda J.,"Clinton, IA",3,8,,5.0,2/2/2016,Great place to spend time with your honey on a date or bring the kids. Awesome service. Good prices. This restaurant has had a face-lift too. Nice new fresh look.
Rita F.,"Princeton, IA",40,18,,3.0,6/27/2015,"My six year old granddaughter and I were in Clinton, and we ate lunch at Applebee's.  They benefit greatly because they are the only sit-down restaurant in this part of town.  Everything else is fast food. I have never bothered to review a chain restaurant, but Applebee's is trying to position themselves as the ""local joint""...that neighborhood place where everybody knows your name.  And they're doing a decent job of it. The decor included large photo canvases of Clinton, Iowa.  The Lumberkings, the Showboat, the Sawmill Museum.   There is music playing in the background, which surprised me.   The band FUN, some Katy Perry, Adele.  I was surprised, but enjoyed listening.   They've revamped their menu, (the Two for $20 option is a great value).  The riblets were excellent.  The french fries were hot, and the portion was generous -- but they were almost too salty to eat, and I was surprised that I couldn't buy cheese dipping sauce.  The Children's Menu was interesting.  My Granddaughter chose the Macaroni and Cheese with grilled chicken, and Mozarella sticks as her side.  Our service was excellent.  Our waitress was friendly and delivered our food hot. If I was just scoring the food, it would be a strong four stars...  BUT.  Applebees has digital screens sitting on every table. Their screen allows (even encourages) a child to  push a button to play a game -- and $.99 will be automatically added to your bill (I narrowly escaped the charge).  I am one of the lunatics who is sick to death of CHILDREN ADDICTED TO SCREENS.   So -- because of their screens -- we'll be eating at Burger King."
Purplized E.,"Greenfield, WI",2,16,16,2.0,7/15/2014,"Food is horrible if you try to eat here late at night. Chicken was blackened/very dry and actually tasted more like turkey for some reason. The good news is that they are open late unlike many local restaurants. The better news is that they have a great friendly staff, especially the nice female bartender. Only recommendable if you are in town late at night with nothing else open, otherwise, keep on driving. ;)"
Caitlin S.,"Davenport, IA",129,2,,2.0,11/13/2015,"Not nothing super special, 9 times out of 10 the food is never the way you had it before, wonton tacos, sometimes hot, sometimes cold, sometimes a shit ton of the extras sometimes very minimal to none...  Aside from that drinks are week and overpriced unless your there for the night crowd... hope you like 20 year Olds"
Jeff C.,"Gallatin, TN",349,90,64,4.0,8/21/2014,"I'm not normally a fan of Applebee's or the other chain style family restaurants, but I was in Clinton on business and stopped here.  The servers were pleasant, and while they didn't have the Sam Adams they were advertising, I really enjoyed the tomato basil soup and the Tai Shrimp salad, which was fabulous.  Later in the evening we waited about 15 minutes for a round of drinks but the waitress fixed that problem by comping us, which is the right thing to do, but out of the norm for this kind of place.  I'm impressed!"
Jim H.,"Shalimar, FL",43,71,1,3.0,5/18/2014,Had the Fiesta Chicken Salad.  Very nice with a bit of a spicy kick.  The service here is great!
