Eric D.,"Fresno, United States",133,54,230,2.0,10/4/2016,The experience was so so. When I got there it was a 25 minute wait even though there was 8 open table's.finale seated I got a male server which was a first for me at this   was the best service I received here the food came out in a timely manner and tasted good with exception of a few under cooked   hopefully this is a sign of improvement.I guess time will tell.
Erin N.,"Visalia, United States",0,2,,1.0,4/11/2017,"Placed a pick up order online, when we went to pick it up the staff assured us multiple times everything we had ordered was in the bag and apologized for not having one of the items we ordered. Got home, everything was definitely not in the bag. Annoying."
Jimmy E.,"Oceano, United States",30,5,,4.0,12/8/2017,Great prices and great food I really enjoyed this place. I like the service however I would've given five stars if the wait wasn't longer than 20 minutes. This is one of my go to spots. Fast service once your seated.
Kim L.,"Fresno, United States",0,15,,5.0,20/7/2017,Really enjoyed my food. I've been here on several occasions and there were two times in particular where the waiters were exceptional.
Liz C.,"Modesto, United States",39,2,,1.0,10/10/2017,"Omg don't come here, tonight several tables complained about food plates (pasta) was ice cold.  Talked to manager (Raul Perez) didn't seem to be very trained in customer service.  Finally took them about 45 minutes just to give me my tab and he honestly made not not want to come back.  Besides that I think I'll go on Facebook and tell a thousand of my closest friends to never go there."
Tia Y.,"Fresno, United States",0,15,6,1.0,21/9/2017,"Customer service sucks here. On top of that, you can't have happy hour deal if you sit in dining area... well, we have a large group and that's where they placed us..."
Isaac B.,"Modesto, United States",0,1,,1.0,10/10/2017,Worst service and worst food I have ever had I recommend if you are considering going here to look the opposite direction and continue walking me and my family when in to Apple bees and took approximately 15 minutes to place our order we waited about 45 minutes for our food as well our server seemed not to know what was going on with our food after waiting nicely me and my family received our food cool all of it WOW really we spoke to the manager he truly didn't know what he was doing this is super unprofessional wait another 30 minutes just for the receipt will never go back to an Apple bees ever again!!!
Alexis W.,"Fresno, United States",0,9,3,5.0,11/5/2017,"Had lunch today with my family today. Excellent service, Tamara was such a pleasure, very kind and sweet. Food was delicious except my fathers bourbon chicken sauce wasn't what he expected .. it's more of a herb butter than a bourbon sauce but everything else including the drinks was delicious. The manager even came to our table and asked how our service was. Great restaurant"
Ed P.,"Tualatin, United States",47,335,115,4.0,27/7/2016,"We had a family dinner here on July 7th, 2016, to celebrate a birthday and a graduation. Twelve of us arrived, and a genuine effort was made to accommodate us, to seat us together at an extended table. To further complicate it (for the server), the billing was divided to three checks. A situation like this requires an organized individual, and our server, Isaac, was a wizard.  I was seated beneath a speaker, and the music's volume made it impossible to participate in the conversation, so I asked that the volume be turned down. My request was accommodated, and I appreciated that.  Isaac added to the occasion with his energy, good humor and attentive service. Our orders were hastily, tastily prepared and we enjoyed our time. Isaac overheard the birthday wishes, and some of the staff sang a ""Happy Birthday"" to one member of our party, and Isaac has an amazing voice!   Our visit was fun, the food was properly prepared (consistent with other properly managed Applebee Restaurants) and that rates at least 3 starts. The quality of service we experienced, Isaac's patience, organization and humor, added significantly to a great evening. That rates a 4th star! The events of the day, and the dinner, were memorable."
Christian L.,"Fresno, United States",1,22,,4.0,31/8/2017,"My boyfriend and I dined in here on Tuesday night and I wasn't disappointed at all! We came in at 11:30 (yes, we were those hungry and annoying last minute customers, hoping for good food and service.) We ordered their Brutus Modelo and Stella Artois since their Happy Hour specials are from 9pm-12pm (awesome)! We then ordered the 2 for $27 and got matching salad appetizers. The salads were presented so pretty from past times that I've been to Applebees. I really appreciated the presentation of my garden salad lol. Next our steaks came out, cooked perfectly and well presented again! Good for you Applebees!!!! Especially since the 2 for $27 had went up $2 since we'd last dined in! The only thing I wasn't crazy about was my mixed veggies... I was given 3 pieces of grilled zucchini, squash and red bell pepper. I told my boyfriend that maybe this was what they had left since we were one of the last customers...I sure hope so!!!! We nervously ordered a side of fries at about 12:45, on their super convenient table tablets and they came out shortly, crispy and perfect! Our waiter Paul was then nice enough to ask us politely if we'd like our brownie bites (delicious!!!!) boxed to-go. Of course we said yes since it was about 12 now. They came with a side of vanilla ice cream and we enjoyed them both when we got home! Shout out to Jess and Paul for being great waiters/waitresses/bartenders and just nice people in general!"
Deanna D.,"Angels Camp, United States",0,10,4,1.0,6/9/2016,"Just turn this place into a bar and be done with it.  The restaurant side is not good at all.  Long wait, undercooked meals. Raw bloody hamburger, undercooked cold rubbery steaks & to top this off it took one hour to get this mess out On a bright note the waitress was very nice apologetic & tried her best to get food to us.  Sweet lady. I hope she finds a better place to work."
Alyssa S.,"Clovis, United States",0,6,,1.0,24/3/2017,"My boyfriend and I come to this location frequently with very realistic expectations. I mean it's Applebee's. But the last two times we have gotten car side to go orders they have let us sit in our car for a good 15-20 minutes before one of us walks inside to check on the order, which basically defeats the purpose of car side to go. They used to come to the car and at least take care of payment so if the food is not ready we at least knew they were aware we were there. But waiting that long we begin to feel like they don't know we are there and don't care. Then tonight's food was awful. We both got burgers that were cooked beyond a crisp, burnt buns, and cold fries when we were told it was the fries that was holding up our order."
Stormy H.,"Merced, United States",8,7,,1.0,29/1/2017,"Worst experience EVER.  Drinks took forever and when I got mine, it was wrong.  Took forever for our food and it was cold when we got it.  Sent it back and it took them 30 minutes to microwave our food and the manager said they remade the food but that was a lie because I cut my steak a certain way and it came back to me cut the same.  My potatoes had raw bits in them.  I practically had to mug my server for a drink refill and she wasn't gracious about serving us.  Never going back there again."
Christy P.,"Fresno, United States",0,13,20,1.0,5/10/2017,"Haven't been to Applebee's in a while. Decided to pop in on a Thursday for their October Margarita special. Walked in, no one in the front. So we sat down waiting for someone to come in the front & a group of 4 came in right behind us. It was like no one noticed that ""customers"" walked in. A waitress was at the front desk & organizing the menus but she doesn't say anything, no greet whatsoever. The group after us got up & puts their name down & then I walked up, and a group of 5 just walked in, & got their name written down, then my name next. She said ""there was an hour wait"" which turned out to be like 10 mins really. I don't drink margaritas, but can't pass up on $1 drinks so I really don't know there were different versions of their margarita special. My first order of margarita was the non-special price but the waiter was able to switch it the $1 ones. It would been a little helpful, if they mention the margarita special when they asked for drinks earlier so I wouldn't have been confused on my part. I don't like that happy hour is only in the bar, the bar gets too packed and crowded & I prefer a table to eat my food. I've been to other locations where I can sit in the dining area & happy hour is applicable. The food for the most part taste average, just simple."
Lori P.,"Clovis, United States",1,27,7,5.0,8/1/2017,"We have recently moved to Clovis.  So many changes and differences.  On Friday night we went to Applebee's.  We waited to be seated less than 15 minutes.  Our hostess was great and our server Danny, was wonderful.  He saw that it that all our food was delicious and done correctly.  We wanted to tell their manager of our great experience.  We will go to Applebee's again and will, happily, recommend."
Tyler A.,"Fresno, United States",106,3,,2.0,10/12/2016,This location is a joke.  After 20 minutes I asked what was taking so long with my cocktail and the waitress told me there were out of Jameson (she served my table 3 other drinks during this time).  I ordered a medium well steak and it came rare.  I ordered the bacon cheddar potatoes as a side and they were delivered cold.  Overall the food quality and service was awful.  I will not be returning here.  If your craving Applebee's save yourself and go to another location.
Don S.,"Clovis, United States",12,2,,1.0,1/12/2016,Slow service  10 minutes between bringing out my  and my wife's  bourbon steak was 2 small globs of gristle and fat with onions and 5 slices of mushroom  couldn't cut it with a Bowie knife really gone downhill  very disappointing won't be back
Roger W.,"Fresno, United States",0,14,,1.0,3/1/2017,All around bad experience.  We were a party of 11.  4 of were served then about 10 minutes later the remaining 7 were served - WAY too large of gap.  The food was average at best.  Later that night my son began vomiting - lasted a few hours and then subsided - sure sounds like a food issue (he did not eat anything besides Applebee's ). Service was sketchy (nice people but ...) I would not go back - not worth it.
Junior M.,"Modesto, United States",106,2,,1.0,17/9/2016,Horrible service!!! We waited over 45 minutes to get our food when it was something so simple. Our waitress was named Amber and she was horrible! She didn't come to check on us and didn't give us any refills! We spoke to the manager who was no help at all and still charged us for our drinks. I will NEVER be returning to this Applebees.
Oscar V.,"Fresno, United States",0,7,,1.0,1/8/2016,"WORST SERVICE EVER. Service is horrible. Burgers were all burnt, the waiter was arguing with me because she misheard my order. Never come to this applebees."
