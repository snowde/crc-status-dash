Raquel B.,"Fresno, United States",34,12,1,1.0,26/12/2015,No one came to our table for 15 minutes!!! We finally asked the seater who our server was and he said he didn't know but would try to find someone to come to our table. Wow!
Ken L.,"Fresno, United States",0,9,,1.0,25/5/2014,"This Applebee's has the worst customer service I have seen. I won't be back. First, they treat like you're bothering them for ordering food, then give you a snotty attitude. That's your damn job, if you don't like it, quit. They don't even acknowledge you when you walk in, I'm sorry, am I disturbing your little hang out? At least 10 employees standing around, but not one of you could help me? Quit acting like you're a hot shot, do your damn job. I work in a restaurant as well, and those employees are completely embarrassing."
Anonymous A.,"Fresno, United States",1,20,,1.0,28/4/2014,Crystal was suppose to be our waitress but every other employee working was able to bring us drinks and our food while she was MIA the whole hour and thirty minutes I was there. Waited over 30 minutes for our food.  Not a pleasent experience at all.
Marigold C.,"Fresno, United States",37,64,28,2.0,8/8/2015,Service isnt so great. Food was so-so. They messed up my order and but didn't forget to charge it on my tab. Ridonkulous. But whatevv. Nvr going back
Ronnie M.,"Fresno, United States",240,8,9,4.0,23/10/2012,Food's awesome when you have the best waitor! And happy hour?! The prices are unbelievable!
Sabrina O.,"Clovis, United States",0,10,,2.0,28/1/2012,"This location has horrible service. So incredibly slow and the waitresses/waitors ignore you.  The food is the usual so its good, gotta love the 2 for 20$. But there is no such thing as a quick lunch date. its a hour minimum even if you just get an appetizer."
Sadai L.,"Fresno, United States",17,17,2,1.0,31/5/2015,This place is such a sad dissapointment....it took 1.5 hour for the staff to bring out my kid's dinner when I initially complained about the service and the long wait. When the waitress brought out my nephew's dinner and it was just a slider without the steamed broccoli  which was a side dish. Waitress stated that we had to wait for the other food.....I didn't know that it took 1.5 hours to steam broccoli....when I looked at my kid's food...her salad was just had pieces of lettus with crotons....no dressing....and that was just the salt to add to my wound....I got up and grab the kids and left. What a waste of time and energy.....if I could I would rate it zero!!!!
Nick F.,"Fresno, United States",1,24,2,2.0,31/7/2015,"Went to eat here for the first time at this location with my dad yesterday. We were seated relatively fast due to the emptiness of the dining room. The waitress that served is was very nice and kept our drinks full during our duration of our stay and she was on top of her service. I ordered a sandwich which had turkey, ham, cheese and bacon in it. When our food arrived we began to eat. I notice that I was chewing on something that wasn't breaking down like food normally should so I pulled it out of my mouth to inspect what it was. I found it was a waxy paper like material. When I examined my sandwich I noticed that whoever prepared my sandwich forgot to remove the wax paper that separates the cheese slices. This left me without an appetite. I don't know if someone got lazy or what but there's no excuse for that. I highly recommend you check your food before you eat it here or save the trouble and eat somewhere else."
MoFries A.,"Fresno, United States",1,2,,1.0,7/11/2013,"This particular location is terrible.  I've been here 3 Times and twice the service was extremely slow. I did appreciate that the manager apologized for the slow service, but I will not be going back to this location again."
Edgar M.,"Clovis, United States",97,13,21,1.0,2/3/2015,"Let me start by saying no one goes to applebee's expecting 5 star service, however I do expect some level of service! We sat at the bar and immediatly remembered why we NEVER come here! The bartender Victor made us feel like we were bothering him just by sitting there. It was yesterday (a sunday) not busy at all, we waited for menus and for him to take our drink order for at least 5 min. He saw us sit down and continued to ignore us. When we finally got menus I ordered my drink and a water as well as my friend. 15 min later he asked us for our food order. He never asked to refill our drinks or check on us at all. The manager went behind the bar and ignored our empty glasses as well! Being in the service industry I still tipped but will NEVER go back"
Victoria B.,"Clovis, United States",4,4,1,4.0,24/7/2014,Came in the afternoon and took a while to get seated after that the sever was really good. Appetizers were out fast and only thing i disliked was the server didn't pay attention time when I asked for my beer to come when I got my food. Which I received a couple minutes later. But food was good and overall service was good.
Alan H.,"Chandler, United States",11,119,61,1.0,21/11/2013,Food was a disappointment! Service was great. I suggest anytime you have a bad experience speak to management at any establishment.
J P.,"Fresno, United States",6,24,1,1.0,16/11/2013,"I wish the option of 0 stars was available. The service here is awful. If you want to wait 30 minutes for your drink and another 45 for your other round, then by all means come here. The manager was not the sharpest tool in the shed and it felt like I was having an adult conversation with a second grader."
Patrici J.,"Fresno, United States",52,2,,5.0,24/8/2015,"The wait was not too long , but the waiter was amazing! He made sure we had all we needed, apologized if he was running around even joked around with us which made for a comfortable atmosphere . Definitely will be going back!"
Tayor B.,"Clovis, United States",0,2,,1.0,2/8/2015,"My boyfriend and I went here for lunch a couple weeks ago and we won't be going back. We ordered two appetizers and two entrees and every dish was awful. The food was flavorless, cold, and tasted like it had just been heated in a microwave. My boyfriend ordered shrimp and broccoli cavatappi and it was horrible. It tasted like cold pasta, shrimp, and broccoli that was just mixed together. No taste whatsoever. The servers were nice but because it was slow we had FOUR different people coming over every 5 minutes to check on us which was incredibly annoying. They try way too hard on service and not enough on food quality. I'm not a picky person but this was pretty bad."
John C.,"Fresno, United States",44,6,,1.0,7/10/2014,"Worst applebee's I have ever been to, absolutely was not busy we sat at the window booth. We were seated and waited 20 minutes to get our drinks they brought them 10 minutes later. We ordered appetizers and our dinner meals which were the same. We received our appetizer which was a salad and some artichoke dip, the salad was terrible and warm the artichoke dip was cold, we sent it back and all they did was microwave it. Then they brought our dinner at the same time, by the time we got it we were just fed up. Dont go here, go to a mcdonalds or some other fast food restaurant. Its not worth the wait or agrivation."
Amy P.,"Clovis, United States",0,2,,1.0,9/11/2014,HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE SERVICE!! TOOK 15 minutes for anyone to even greet us and another 10 minutes to be sat at a table. You suck applebees!!
BK D.,"Pleasanton, United States",12,27,,5.0,29/10/2013,"I was in town on business and my mother wanted to treat me to dinner at Applebee's. The food was great and our food server Lance was polite, prompt, and very accommodating, but not over the top. The manager was professional and courteous, bringing out our meals and insisting that my mom cut her steak and to ensure it was cooked to satisfaction. I highly recommend this location and would eat here again. For those who criticize ""chain restaurants"" may I suggest you eat somewhere else..."
Jenny S.,"Kingsburg, United States",43,127,39,3.0,6/5/2011,"This is one of the better Applebee's I've been to. Now, this is not my favorite place to eat, not by a long shot, but I always go when others want to, which was the case last night. I met up with some friends for dinner. Being that it was Cinco de Mayo, I expected it to be busy. It was, but we were seated within a few minutes of getting there. We sat in the bar, which I don't really like, but it was nice to be seated right away. Our waitress was super nice and helpful. She brought us our water right away. Our bar drinks took a bit longer but that was to be expected. She apologized for the wait but it certainly wasn't her fault, and we didn't mind. When I noticed my appletini didn't have a cherry (come on, the alcohol-soaked cherry at the bottom is the BEST part!) she immediately brought me out three, on a sword, for my drink!  Our food was good, typical Applebee's fare. My tortilla chips were so greasy that they actually were soggy, which wasn't the best. I'm sure the waitress would have replaced them had I asked, but I was so hungry that I didn't care. Anyway, we had a good time. The next time everyone wants to go eat at Applebee's I would definitely come back to this one."
Sweet O.,"Fresno, United States",2,30,16,4.0,22/7/2013,Ordered dinner to go and the service was pretty fast! They gave me extra toppings for my loaded mashed potatoes so that was sweet :) the only thing they forgot to put in our bags were utensils and napkins but other than that it was a nice experience
