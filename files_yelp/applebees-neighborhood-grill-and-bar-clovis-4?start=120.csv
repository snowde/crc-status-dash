Weston P.,"Sanger, United States",406,192,103,4.0,26/7/2013,"I was very impressed with the service at 11:40 PM and the strawberry, Blueberry, chicken salad was very fresh and had excellent flavor. This visit had really made me rethink my feelings towards this chain."
Eddie V.,"Alameda, United States",4,30,21,4.0,28/12/2011,We had a great server and the food was prompt to arrive.  I had the Chicken Sizzlin' Platter and let me tell you it was delicious.  Add the cheesy corn and swap the potatoes for a great plate!
Eddie And Michelle R.,"Sanger, United States",0,6,1,4.0,29/6/2013,"Food was great as usual. The only problem was slow service. The server was new,  only his 2nd week working. And still hadn't gotten it down. he looked lost. we asked for cocktail sauce and he brought us marinara. We ordered our drinks and they sat at the bar for like 10 min, so we got them ourselves. It was a Friday evening. So it was pretty crowed. But not so much that we had to wait to be seated. Stiil.. We'll definitely be going back."
Colton C.,"Clovis, United States",46,10,6,1.0,7/4/2013,Service can be extremely slow. Went 3 different occasions and had a problem every time. Last time ordered steak medium rare and it came out well done.
Marc R.,"Pinole, United States",79,94,82,1.0,14/8/2012,"Curbside Cleanup much needed. I placed my order over the phone @7:12 to be told ""pick up in 15 minutes"" LMAO. I left my house after the 15 Min and arrived  25min after placing my order. It is 100 degrees outside and  I do not want to sit with the air running too long. I was greeted by my curbside host telling me I will be right back with your bill. That was the only thing that was prompt.He returned with the bill and the next cars food. I paid by C.C.and tipped him. He took it and said he will come  right back  he will be packing up my order."" Next I see him right back only to help the car next to me. Who just replaced the car that got their order. He went in came back out helped someone else and told me he would be right back again. Then after 10 more minutes and 45 min after I placed my Curbside convienence I went into the resturaunt to find my guy standing around. I said ""oh you must be still packing my order?"" His reply was a smirk and let me get my manager. This must happen alot she offered"" the free salad or desert"". I replied,"" I just want my order how about that why add to my suffering wait time by offering more time to my order."" I went back to my car waited 5 more minutes only to have the guy come out and give the car next to me their order. Yes I left!! with no food. They have now been added to my Jimmy John list of places I would not go if the food was Free. The manager called and apoligized and offered me free food I declined DONE."
Harinder S.,"Clovis, United States",0,1,,1.0,10/6/2014,Here for 30 mins and still not even a water. Waiter stopped by once 20 mins ago and said will bring the drinks. Comes by and has only 1 glass of water.  She has a big private party to attend to so there should be more help for her.
Cheelee Y.,"Fresno, United States",5,62,104,3.0,30/10/2014,Only been here once with a couple friends. It wasn't bad but felt like every other restaurant. The service was okay too.
Dustin B.,"San Diego, United States",25,20,14,1.0,8/6/2012,"Service was outstanding. Our server was prompt, polite, and very patient with my grumpy 2 yr old. But this is where the positives end. The food was very sub par. My steak was cooked well done, despite my ordering it medium. The ""steamed"" vegetables were extremely under cooked and disgusting. The ""Mac and Cheese"" was nothing more than a serving of Kraft from the box, for $5.50. I was very disappointed with the quality of the food served. Lastly, the food took almost 1 hour to hit our table. Leaving all of us very hungry and a bit edgy. I will not return to this particular Applebee's again."
Joseph E.,"Clovis, United States",41,93,51,1.0,17/1/2013,"Worst service elsie and I both ordered a soup of course they're both cold my burger was cold, the fries were cold as well we had to wait for about 20 minuets before the soup was brought to us, the waitress left bowls, cups at the edge of the table, forsure not coming back!"
Tracie T.,"Fresno, United States",13,15,21,2.0,18/2/2012,Use to love this place. Not so much anymore. My fav bartender isn't there anymore so the drinks aren't as good as before. The servers are real nice except one girl who is overly nice. She flirts with my guy and completely ignores me every time we go in. She wont even refill MY drink. Which is fine cause her tip will always be ZERO. One star for the food. One star for the rest of the servers. Everything else pretty much sucks here.
Jason E.,"Paradise, United States",178,38,87,4.0,26/2/2010,Great food!!! Burger was great!!! Got the $20 deal with a friend. Got the side salad deal with a free dessert slider!!! Yummy I'm stuffed!! Service was good... I would go back anytime!!!
Tom S.,"Fresno, United States",13,13,4,1.0,19/1/2012,"Not sure what was going on at this location, as I've never had a bad experience at other Applebee's locations in Fresno. My wife and I entered the restaurant and were promptly seated at a table. We patiently waited for, get this, 15 minutes, and no one ever came by to even ask for our drink order. We looked around the restaurant and noticed that people only had their drinks at many other tables and there were almost no waiters to be found. I would never go back to this location. We walked out after realizing that if it took 15 minutes and we still hadn't even seen a waiter, it would be hours before we'd ever get drinks or our food."
Jessica B.,"Sacramento, United States",17,10,2,2.0,9/10/2012,"Went for lunch around 1:30. This must be the time of the day they're training new hires. Service was slow, information was incorrect (he got the soups of the day wrong, another girl had to correct him and apologize). It shouldn't take 40 min for coffee and a chicken Caesar salad."
Johnny P.,"Fresno, United States",0,5,,5.0,28/9/2015,"I will go ahead and give this a 5 because the food is profound. The happy hours here work well with the average budget. My favorite is the boneless wings--every new city I visit I always like to check out the wing joints they have $5.00 for 10-12 boneless wings during happy hour. Good environment for dating and usually there are competitions  which keep it fun for friend hangouts. The only downside is to get food on happy hour prices you are required to dine in-- this isn't good if you have older family at home or people who don't like to go out to dine to enjoy the quality food of Applebees and the convenience of happy hour prices. Many times I've taken trips here trying to get management to bend on this rule because my mom really wants to try their food but doesnt make alot of money and she doesnt like to dine out. I go to the business for a quick wing fix, eat them, and go.. I don't see why more profit is gained from sitting there as opposed to taking your food to go, you'll still be back for more. But besides this one disappointment the Clovis Applebees has a great vibe, fast service, and friendly staff."
Groggy G.,"Clovis, United States",8,15,11,3.0,7/9/2012,"The food is good, they are just understaffed. I know they're trying to guess what the demand is going to be but I was there @ 11:45 on a Friday and it still took 30 minutes to for the two of us to get our meal."
Desi E.,"Fresno, United States",1,14,,4.0,1/2/2012,"This is my favorite happy hour spot. I always sit at the bar. Anywhere else will take a lot longer because it's usually pretty busy. The bartenders are all really nice. Try to stay away on beer pong nights. There's usually a lot of young kids & it's hard to get a beer, even at the bar."
Amada M.,"Clovis, United States",228,9,9,3.0,21/8/2011,"My Co workers had a long day serving and needed a relax place to go for some beer and food.  We started off with their cheese and bean dip which was actually quiet good.  For my main course I had a Buffalo chicken Burger.  Although the food was great, I could not help but to eventually notice the poor service we were given.  We hardly saw our waiter, and when we needed drinks it was difficult to find them or even a Bartender.  I should probably also mention that we were part of the very few who were in there. Over all, the food matched up to my expectations but the service did not."
Rakayla M.,"Madera, United States",1,58,4,4.0,15/6/2010,Perfect if you go for lunch with someone else because they have a 2 for 20 meal. The steak and mashed potatoes were really good
Michelle I.,"Fresno, United States",25,37,103,3.0,5/9/2011,"ate here a few times already. the 2 for 20 deal is great. the portions of food they give you is Awesome. I have a family of 4 and we order the 2 for 20 all the time, and the 4 of us share. we usually order the oriental chicken salad and the three cheese chicken penne, with mozzarella sticks as an appetizer. The Service is wonderful, very nice people."
Cameron L.,"Los Angeles, United States",0,6,,1.0,2/4/2011,"This Applebee's WAS my family's goto when it came to a casual dinner out, but not anymore.  I had a few bad experience leading up to this one and was going to ignore it, but this one put me over the edge. I ordered the chicken finger basket and my meal was room temperature, unacceptable.  Then I noticed that my fries appeared to be RECYCLED FROM A PREVIOUS ORDER!  Are you kidding me?!  Some of the fries were ripped in half and a couple had what appeared to be ketchup that had been wiped off!  When I asked the waiter about it he got super defensive and seemed super put out by getting me another order of fries.  I did not stand for it and left."
