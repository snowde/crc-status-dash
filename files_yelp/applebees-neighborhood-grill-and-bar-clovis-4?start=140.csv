Sheng V.,"Clovis, United States",22,67,,2.0,19/12/2010,"This is by far the worst Applebee's in Fresno and it's located in Clovis!  Everytime I come here, someone is always asking their waiter to go get the manager.  After they make their complaint (usually about the horrible service of their waiter or something to do with their food), the manager just seems to listen and do nothing about it.  The people usually leave grumpy.  On one occasion here when our order came out wrong and our waitress forgetful and was never found for anything whether it be your refills or the long wait for your check, my bf and I were about to make a complaint to the manager when the table behind us beat us to it!  They asked a random waiter walking by to get the manager and when the manager arrived, the couple was complaining that their waitress had only brought out one of their two meals they had ordered and left them their check twenty minutes later being charged for both meals when they had only received one!  Weirdest predicament ever!  The manager simply said he was going to take the other meal off their tab and left to do so, no apologies, no ""I'll go talk to your waitress,"" or ""did you still want your other meal?"".  The couple was so outraged, they just left before the manager  came back.  On another occasion here, I ordered steak with seasonal vegetables and mashed potatoes.  Needless to say, I can tell you one hundred percent that they microwaved my whole meal.  My steak which I ordered medium was well done with no pinkness to it anywhere and had some bites that were cold and others hot.  My broccoli was all soggy and salted to the point of gagging but worst, my mashed potatoes was a WATERY mess.  And they served it to me that way.  For some reason, I keep going back on late nights when I'm hungry thinking the experience will be different"
Lucio O.,"Clovis, United States",11,69,61,3.0,27/2/2009,Applebees is another one of those chain restaurants. The food here is good. My favorite is the Oriental Chicken Roll Up made with Oriental sauce instead of Teriaki sauce. The only problem here is that the service is a little slow especially on a busy night.
