Marc O.,"Clovis, United States",2,12,4,1.0,10/12/2016,"ALL OF THE FOOD WAS COLD. This place is terrible, would rather have a Mc.Double from Mc.Donald's."
Shannon C.,"Fresno, United States",31,132,52,5.0,5/8/2015,"I LOVE Applebee's.  Going at 3pm, happy hour on appetizers is a great deal!  Their wanton tacos are AMAZING!!!  Also their chicken quesadillas and artichoke dip... All their food is pretty good and there are some great deals ... Eating out with someone they regularly change up their 2 for $20 deals. This visit in particular was our best visit.  Our waitress was awesome! Super friendly and attentive but gave us space too... She was like a ninja swooping in to refill our glasses and making sure we had everything they need!!!     So back to the tacos... I will give Applebee's a one star the day they take them off the menu!!! I LOVED them that much!!!!! ;) the quesadilla I got couldn't compare!"
Sandy V.,"Fowler, United States",0,20,,1.0,30/11/2016,"I did not enjoy my beer or food. Terrible service at the bar, we sat at the bar and the bartender already looked upset. He didn't greet us or anything instead he said do you guys have your IDs?! Well geez hi, how are you too? Goodness no customer service at all. Usually every time we sit at any bar the bartender is usually happy & at the most say hi to new customers. The service was slow and they were not busy at all this was a Wednesday. Don't come here unless you're okay with slow and bad service. Also if you want to be ignore this is the perfect place."
Romeo M.,"Clovis, United States",86,4,1,1.0,3/2/2016,"Walked in and sat down at 4:45 pm and was looking forward to some happy hour. 5:00 and not even waters or a greeting from a server. I don't know if they were short staffed or what. At least offer waters and a little explanation of why the service might be a bit slower. But nothing and that is just unacceptable. You have lost a customer. UPDATE: After going through the reviews, it appears that this establish is just TERRIBLE overall. Long wait times for service and bad food. New management is needed or something."
Fonzy C.,"Fresno, United States",114,2,,1.0,28/7/2016,"Never again!!!! Dont come here!!! Service is horrible, place is a mess.... Applebees District Manager listen here.... Get new managers at this location. Ive been here multiple times and still same dirty slow crapy service!"
Teresa L.,"Brentwood, United States",31,8,4,2.0,15/4/2017,Food was ok. The rice tastes dry and like it was made out of a box. The chicken on my pasta wasn't cooked all the way. The advertisement on TV said 2 meals for $20  but the only beef selection is a hamburger. All the good meals are on a 2 meals for $26. Which wasn't advertised! We would of been better of eating at Wendy's or In & Out. The service was good except I had to ask for extra napkins 3 times. I was offered something else but I didn't like any other stuff on their 2 for $20 menu.
Chris E.,"Selma, United States",0,3,,1.0,12/4/2017,"Bad service. Wait time. Really awful and uncaring manager (taller larger white male with glasses). Jessica c horrible. Servers talking crap about other guests right near me while I'm waiting 20 minutes for ice cream!!! Host bussing tables with same rag that she kept in the host stand, never sanitized. I go here once a year only hoping that it gets better. It hasn't."
C P.,"Clovis, United States",0,7,,1.0,19/3/2017,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible.........nachos were covered in watered down cheese, fries were probably from the day before, fried shrimp probably wasn't shrimp at all.    Needless to say we all got sick that night.   The restaurant was not full but we had to wait for a table of 6.   Awful place.  DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!"
Nae A.,"San Jose, United States",37,63,34,1.0,2/7/2016,"Walked in and we were immediately seated. We received menus in Spanish. We asked our server for English ones because we don't read in Spanish and he looked at us and said ""it's a damn shame you guys don't speak or read Spanish. That's your heritage!!!"" Umm, excuse me Hector?? First of all, RUDE! Totally uncalled for. Secondly, just because we look like we would speak it doesn't mean it's a ""damn shame"" that we don't."
Holly R.,"San Diego, United States",49,111,31,3.0,21/7/2014,"I came here this past Thursday 7/17/2014 with a gift card I got for my birthday. First off when I entered the music here was SO loud. What? It's not even a college hangout, it was just blasting. Kailey was my server; she was really friendly and even listened to our complaint about the music and had it immediately turned down for us. I don't know how the seats in the booth are built. The guy sitting behind me sat down with a loud PLOP that I actually jerked forward. Our food came, I ordered the Chicken Freshcado and it was perfect. I really love how Applebees offers a low calorie menu. We were waiting on a refill for our Cola and we were surprised Kailey never offered us a refill;  she was a sweet server. We got the attention of an older male with black glasses to refill it for us - he was very quiet and didn't really say anything but he did it for us anyways. Not the best Applebees I've been to but I enjoyed it here since I had a goft card from my birthday. So 3 out of 5 stars It is. (BTW who is it that keeps rating all my reviews on Yelp as ""Funny""?)"
Samantha O.,"Fresno, United States",0,8,,1.0,28/7/2016,"Why do i continue to give this place multiple chances? Why?! Service is cr@p, they need to new management or something. Their are always tables that sit around not cleaned, the bar always has a piles of dirty glasses and know that for a hands down FACT, you won't get food until you've been here for over an hour from the moment you sit down. Change it up Applebee's and quick!"
Steve E.,"San Diego, United States",1,25,9,1.0,12/6/2016,"Worst Service ever! Came in went to the Bar a new person with minimal support. Tried to get drinks but she didn't know pricing although had in book and showed. Went with water and ordered our food, the order process took 45min. She kept fulfilling other waiters drink and request telling hold on. An hour into ordering just as we should of walked out manager came to help with the order and in a sly way up sold my order. Seriously just wanted to eat. Got the wrong order and she took my plate away, food was burnt, just wanted to leave. 3hrs there with everything messed up thought I was on a TV show. Worst service right before I shipped out for the military thanks"
Jamie F.,"Clovis, United States",107,10,1,1.0,13/5/2015,"So far the service hasn't been that great. I asked our waitress for a custom order and she said right away ""we can't do that"". Well my cousin who also works at Applebee's was with and informed her that it is possible to customize the order how I wanted it. She could've tried a little harder to accommodate to my needs. Not impressed still waiting for the food let's see how it is. Other than that the drinks are good!   After we got ur food which they messed up every single plate. We called the manager to have him fix it and he does. He bring back our new plates ad low and behold the Boneless wings were COMPLETELY RAW!!!! worst experience ever!!!!! Don't come here go anywhere else! The Indian food restaurant across the street I'm sure would be better than this and I've never even ate Indian food. If I could give negative stars I would!"
Joanna M.,"Fresno, United States",37,243,9,4.0,11/8/2015,"I've had there quesadilla burger, Pepper Crusted Sirloin & Whole Grains, meatballs, chicken wings and siracha shrimp. For the sirloin being $14 after taxes it was not worth it. All the other food was good. The appetizers taste better when they are half off!"
M. M.,"Fresno, United States",7,54,27,1.0,7/5/2016,I love the apps here but service is HORRIBLE! I ordered my food before going to Carside to pick up I was told 15-20min wait. I end up waiting 40 minutes and had to call to see if someone was going to come out to take money and give me my food. what is the point of Carside services of I have to go in. I have 2 small babies and it would be completely hard to drag them in and try to pay and grab food at the same time. ratings don't lie on services it really sux. too bad this has to be the only Applebee's in clovis
Kim C.,"Fresno, United States",26,98,92,1.0,18/4/2015,"Came here late on a Thursday night. We were seated in a dine in area due to the fact we had a few kids in our party. Waitress was friendly. I wish I had good stuff to say but sadly, I do not.  Pros:  1. Love the late night 1/2 off selected apps. Portion sizes were good and hard to go wrong with mozzarella sticks, boneless wings and chicken quesadillas.  2. There is a tablet type thing on each table that helps keep the kids occupied (this will also be mentioned as a con below). Apparently, it allows customers to reorder items and make requests.  Cons:  1. Waitress didn't come by often to offer refills. We were there about 1.5h and she came by 3 times. Once to take initial order, then to take actual order and then to bring bill. The other times we flagged down other staff for assistance. 2. The great tablet thing I mentioned, well come to find out, it costs $1 (per game! but apparently they just changed it to a flat fee or something. Not too sure according to manager who was also unaware/surprised that NO ONE told us about a surcharge and a little confused about the updates). Would be nice if the machine or the waitress gave us a heads up with a ""btw, if you want to play games, they will be yada yada yada"".  3. My friend saw a staff member use the restroom and left without washing his hands. *GROSSSSSSS*! Ok, yes, the team member was no longer on the clock as after he walked out of restroom, he walked to parking lot and left. We mentioned this to manager and she was trying to tell us that ""oh he's off the clock and I understand your concern."" Ok, yes, I agree he was off the clock. But people are creatures of habit. Im sure he didn't just not wash his hands this one time cause he's clocked out. Usually if someone doesn't wash their hands, its cause they normally don't. Luckily, we had already eaten and paid for our meal, otherwise I would have got up and left. I'm sorry manager, even if he was off, that is UNACCEPTABLE. We will not be coming back to this establishment and wouldn't recommend it either. Maybe at another location but not here where hand hygiene and public/consumer safety doesn't matter once someone is ""Off the clock""."
Connie A.,"Fresno, United States",27,2,1,1.0,30/8/2016,"While out with my husband and daughter this last Sunday we decided to stop at Applebee's in Clovis for a nice late lunch and drinks. The place was empty so we expected to be seated quickly and be eating soon. That was not the case. While about 6 servers stood over no one was being seated. After about 10 minutes we were shown to our booth I ordered a mixed drink that took another 10 minutes to receive. The restaurant wasnt even full so we couldn't understand the delay. Another family of four was also irritated as their own food hadn't come after over an hours wait. Finally they got up and went to pay for their drinks and leave and the waitress finally came out with their food but they had obviously had enough. Our meal came out 10 minutes later and they dropped my steak. So didn't get my meal but I was offered the food the other people left lol like seriously you think I didn't know that was someone else's order. The service sucked, the food was cold, and everything about the situation sucked! I will not be going back again. I don't recommend to anyone."
Ron W.,"Clovis, United States",0,18,3,4.0,15/7/2016,"Enjoyed dinner there AFTER I found the place.  The Yelp map is incorrect.  The business is located farther east, past the light at Minnewawa."
Lilian H.,"Fresno, United States",0,15,2,4.0,2/6/2017,"I am very happy that my boyfriend and I chose to come here tonight. We've been here many times before and I'd say tonight was our very best experience. The host, Dani, immediately greeted us and made sure to update us on available seats at the tables even if I asked for a booth. She checked in on us while we were outside twice and it's good to know we weren't forgotten. She was extremely friendly and had great customer service. Our server, Ricky, also did a great job. He greeted us and asked what we'd like to drink immediately and brought us our drinks soon after. He didn't leave us sitting there for twenty minutes even on a busy night. Our food came out quickly and Ricky made sure to check in for refills or anything else we needed. Our food was great as well. I definitely recommend the siracha shrimp appetizer. The chicken cavatappi was okay but my boyfriends American burger was great. I'm glad we came here."
Shawn H.,"El Cajon, United States",59,13,10,1.0,28/5/2016,Absolutely the worst service I have ever had any were we got ignored because a large group was more important we never got half of what we ordered and we got 2 of 4 drinks
