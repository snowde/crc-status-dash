Claudio U.,"Fresno, United States",1,15,,4.0,21/6/2016,"I remember coming to this place a while back and it was not too impressive...I recently went bowling at the AMF next door, with some friends and then ended up at Applebee's...I have to admit I was impressed with there food this time around...I have been back since then, keep it up!.. :)"
Josh F.,"Clovis, United States",5,34,2,1.0,9/4/2016,"Every time I come here it 15-20 minute wait and there is more then 10 open tables? Don't know if it is a management problem or what. The other Applebee's in town are great, just this one that has this problem. Next time I will remember to go elsewhere."
Alexander Z.,"Livermore, United States",35,9,3,1.0,17/4/2016,Most horrible place I've ever eaten in my life slow Service never checked on us didn't care about anybody's orders or refills or food brought out our food with no plates Etc never come here
Yvonne S.,"Fresno, United States",0,7,3,1.0,24/5/2016,"I went to Applebee's for celebration of completion of my finals. My party and I were seated in a prompt   timely manner. However, once our server came to take our drinks he quickly asked what we wanted and left. This was pretty much his approach to serving us the entire dinner service. My food was the first and only plate to came out along w my moms salad, which the croutons were burnt and when she asked him to take it back and please give her croutons that weren't burnt he got annoyed and w o an apology reluctantly took her plate. His whole service was like this (very short, annoyed and mad) all directed towards us. A few other servers brought out different plates to our table four different times during our stay.. My boyfriend never got his meal, and my moms salad finally came out, but her shrimp was very overdone.. After this experience here I will never come back to this Applebee's again or recommend to anyone."
Anthony S.,"Fresno, United States",0,2,,1.0,23/10/2016,"This apple bees used to have very fast service, but the last two times I've went (both on slow evenings) food took almost 45 mins to come out. Just seems like this apple bees has gone down hill over the years and I won't be coming back"
A L.,"Clovis, United States",180,89,17,1.0,5/3/2016,"The only saving grace here is the manager Ashley. Our main dish came out with our appetizers, our sides were cold, we didn't get any utensils for quite a long time and my salmon portion was pathetic. Ashley came over and got us some new food and utensils. She is a great manager....just need to implement some new staff"
Ashley L.,"Clovis, United States",2,9,3,2.0,18/9/2016,"I don't know what happened to this location but I used to come here all the time. The service is horrible now and wait time for food typically ranges from two to three hours. We had a party of six on a night that wasn't too busy and we ended up staying over three hours due to the fact that our waitress ""forgot"" to serve our food. I'm pretty patient when it comes to these types of situations so I only assumed that she was new or that something was going on in the kitchen BUT time after time I would see her socializing, standing in one spot, and laughing with her coworkers. Even then, I still wasn't too frustrated but the thing that set me off was that by the end of the night, she mixed up our checks twice and didn't even bother fixing them a third time even though from the very beginning we told her how we wanted it split. Anyways, she specifically told us, ""They're all around the same amount so... whatever."" and proceeded to walk away. SAY WHAT? Also, no apologies whatsoever. Oooo girl. Of course, we still gave her a small tip because hey, she could be going through a rough time... but man oh man I'm not coming back here nor would I recommend anyone going here. Sorry Applebee's! Y'all suck."
Jessica B.,"Fresno, United States",46,2,,1.0,21/4/2016,Service was ok but but food and drink size was poor. And the card reader was broken. Bad bad bad. We will NOT be back.
Whit L.,"Fresno, United States",0,5,5,4.0,20/12/2015,"My husband and I eat at this location quite a bit we have always had great service Service: today our servers name was Zack, super nice, and attentive to our needs. Food: we got a 2 for 25 both with the 7oz sirloin mash potato and veggies, the meat was delicious cooked just how we liked it! Veggies were soft and mash potatoes amazing as usual. Experience: great!  music was not to loud we were able to talk and restaurant was pretty clean. Good job guys."
Charlie V.,"Clovis, United States",1,15,63,1.0,9/4/2016,Well this place used to be the best but ever since new ownership and management this place sucks big time. Do your self a favor and go the the others in Fresno. Piss poor service. Unknowledgeable management and servers. I have watched this place go down hill in the last year bad. This will be the last time I come here. Seven Bar and Grill a way better place across the street. 8.75 for a 805 at the bee 4.00 across the street at seven. Asta la vista Applebee's on shaw and minniwawa.
Eden Y.,"Fresno, United States",4,12,2,2.0,25/2/2016,Service was meh. Our server/bartender sucked bad! It wasn't even busy. He got my bf and his buddy their drinks but never even got mine. Didn't even get my drink until our food came out. And my drink was just a strawberry lemonade drink! Just upset I didn't get my strawberry lemonade
Ariel S.,"Clovis, United States",0,6,3,2.0,27/6/2015,"I've been to this Applebee's location several times and I definitely experienced better service than the last time I went. For Father's Day 2015, we went to this restaurant in the early evening, it wasn't packed yet. Waiting time was short to be seated (about 10 minutes).  The problem began when we were assigned a waitress. Man, that girl was hardly friendly. Come to think of it, the waiters at the other tables weren't happy looking either. Our waitress was impatient when asking what we wanted to drink; acted like it was so much trouble repeating what sodas they have. I asked if they had Dr. Pepper and she said ""nope."" Uhhhh... Just one word, really? Didn't even give suggestions. When my father was ordering, she didn't explain the 2 for $25(?) deal thing properly so it left him confused thinking he was ordering right. Later on in the service she realized her mistake and tried to fix it. While taking our menus away, she dropped one on the table, and didn't seem to care that it bothered us. ""Oh sorry about that."" Her apology barely seemed believable.  We didn't have silverware at our table. Guess it wasn't common sense that a family of three needs extra napkins instead of the just one that is wrapped around the eating utensils.  The waitress wasn't serving food to a lot of tables, sooooo I don't know what her excuse was for forgetting what my table ordered. When she brought the food out, she said the name of the dish in a questioning manner as to ask who the plate was for. That's the job of the waiter to remember.  If it was up to me, she would have gotten zero tips, but my parents tipped her anyway.  Moving on from the waiter area....the food was good. Double Crunch Shrimp is a little hard to bite through, but that's because it's....double the crunch as the name implies. French fries good. Classic boneless buffalo chicken was good."
Sharon I.,"Clovis, United States",27,1,,1.0,27/9/2016,"What happened to this place?  We had a birthday dinner here tonight and the service was terrible.  It took 20 minutes for someone to even come to the table and acknowledge that we were there.  Once the order was taken it was just mistake after mistake.  I ordered a salad (which I had to pay extra for) to go with my steak and the salad was forgotten and was delivered after the steak had arrived.  Another item was not delivered and had to be taken off our bill.  The server kept apologizing but really when I go out for a special meal I want great service.  The meal must have sat around for awhile prior to being served because it was not hot but I was hungry and did not bother to send it back.  The loaded potato came with about a thimble-full of ""load"" so I had to ask for more and by the time it arrived I was ready to go home so just asked for a box.  Wow, I used to like this place and am wondering if it is under new management or something.  Something isn't working."
Hnuhli V.,"Fresno, United States",0,6,,3.0,28/3/2016,i give them a 3 star because the food is good. other then that the workers are not welcoming at all! they have really rude hostesses!
Gregg P.,"Manhattan Beach, United States",2,17,,1.0,6/7/2016,"This should be a 1/2 star. Waited 15 minutes to get a server to take our order. Waited another 30 minutes to get our meal. Asked for the manager, she came right away. Told her what was going on. Her response was I just started work and will check it out. Never saw her again. Did not offer to comp our meal. I will never go to this restaurant again. Save your self some money- don't go."
Tina A.,"Santa Rosa, United States",55,44,1,1.0,1/11/2015,"This place sucked! Everyone's food was bad or not what we ordered. No dressing on the salad, seriously? I was not impressed at all. Service was good and the place is clean but I won't be back."
Thelma P.,"Fresno, United States",66,24,21,5.0,28/5/2016,"Ate here for the first time tonight and it was surprisingly delicious. We were seated quickly,  and the host was friendly. We ordered soft pretzels with a beer cheese sauce thing for an app and I couldn't believe how good the sauce was!  They have a little game system on the table that my son played with,  it had a few ""Frozen"" games with Olaf so he was in heaven. Our waitress was Rachel and she was very sweet!  She had a lot of recommendations/suggestions which was helpful because I hadn't been to any applebees in over 5 years.  My dinner was  3 cheese macaroni with chicken strips, and it was really flavorful.  My wife had a turkey club sandwich and said the turkey tasted like thanksgiving turkey instead of regular lunch meat turkey.  While we were eating the store manager stopped by our table to ask us how our food was,  and I saw him going up to the other tables to check on them too. His name was ""Trucker"" which I thought was a joke but I guess is his real name!  Anyway,  I'm surprised at all of the bad reviews on here because we genuinely had a good experience and will definitely be back!"
Elizabeth H.,"San Francisco, United States",0,1,,1.0,21/1/2017,"I am a regular guest at this Applebee's, however my experience tonight was infuriating. I ordered a Coronarita and our waitress was already having attitude. She comes with my drink and there are black stuff floating in my drink. It looked like black pepper flakes but appeared slightly larger in size. I asked for a new drink, the waitress appeared to be irritated, she did not apologize and then stormed off with my drink. She comes back with the new drink two minutes later, and there are still black shit in my drink. I tell her once again that there are stuff floating in my drink so she takes it back and once again did not apologize for her shitty attitude and service. The waitress then comes back to my table and tries to explain that some blueberries fell into their ice, and that the floating black stuff were from the blueberries. First off, Applebee's has an ice machine in their kitchen, so if blueberries fell in your ice then toss that shit and get new ice. Also the people at my table got drinks as well and their cups had nothing floating in it. I'm guessing they don't wash their cups and that explains the black stuff floating in my drink. This waitress was giving me a pathetic explanation that she obviously pulled out from her ass."
Mark M.,"Louisville, United States",44,35,19,1.0,11/11/2015,"Horrible, Tuesday 11.10.15 @10:30pm. Sat ourselves at bar, bar was filthy not cleaned from previous patrons, bartender took out order have us out drinks without even wiping down area still dirty from the previous customers. Ordered wonton tacos told 10 min later they were sold out.. What this is a corporate company even a franchise I don't care I expect a small mom pop place to be sold out not a chain restaurant. So opted for boneless wings even asked if I could have bbq wings. Wings served buffalo when brought to bartender attention he threw down the platter and said keep these I'll put in the bow for you. Ok no,problem but did u have to throw it down, really.. So when bow wings show up there is hair on them. Yea I paid and left screw this place not worth me to even try and complain. Use to love this place what happened"
Isaac L.,"Clovis, United States",10,10,30,5.0,30/7/2014,this place has been very inviting on all of my visits. Haven't had any issues or complaints about this place so far.  Been here more times than my check-ins.  Everyone has been tentative thus far.
