Samantha M.,"Fresno, United States",0,21,,1.0,13/7/2015,It's been years since I've ordered food from this location and nothing's changed. I ordered to go. I ordered the fiesta chicken I got some horrible bland chicken penne with tough bread sticks. I also ordered buffalo boneless wings and it tasted like they took the bbq ones (probably all they had ready made) tossed them lightly in some buffalo sauce and called it a day. My husband got the Riblet platter and that was a sick sad joke. Order was scheduled for 10:40 he didn't get it till 11. Just all kinds of wrong. If I hadn't have paid with a gift card I would have been livid. Luckily someone else paid for this hot mess. Won't be giving them a 3rd chance that's for true.
Robert K.,"Clovis, United States",0,4,,1.0,26/12/2015,"Saturday 12-26-15 at 1:30 pm Slow and very poor service  Haven't been here in 6 months, now I remember why. Wish I would have gone to Olive Garden or red robin just down the street. Food quality was poor spinach dip was small amount filled half way and cold. Salad had very little chicken in it. Looks like there cutting back on food cost at the customers expense.  What a sad experience we had.... Waisted our money  I won't be back"
Joe N.,"Fresno, United States",14,19,,2.0,17/7/2015,This Apple Bee's has the worst service at the bar. They hardly ever check on you. Everyone just waits for their order and has to constantly ask for service. One time the couple next to us were frustrated because they had been waiting an hour. I suggest you do not come to this Apple Bee's for drinks/happy hour.
Sam S.,"Fresno, United States",171,70,49,1.0,19/5/2015,BEWARE RAW CHICKEN WINGS  !!!There was a long list of terrible things that happened through out the night with the server and especially the MANAGER! but I want to focus on the fact that I was served RAW CHICKEN- as I was going to snap a picture of the the manager comes and snatches off the table- not paying attention I took a big bite of RAW CHICKEN and had the RUNS the next day!!! THANKS ALOT APPLEBEES!!
Michelle L.,"Clovis, United States",86,4,,4.0,13/4/2016,"You know, this place isn't so bad. We've been here in the past and have had bad experiences, but today was good. We were greeted kindly at the door, the wait was maybe 10 minutes. Busy for a Wednesday, I imagine. Once we were seated our server Christy was very kind and cordial. She was on top of our drinks and our pending order. Our good came out in a timely manner and it was good. I mean, it is Applebee's, like any other chain type restaurant but really the food was good. The reason I deducted a star was for a seemingly lack of tidy-ness. There were tortilla chip crumbs and bits all over the restaurant floor. Overall a good experience, the service was better than we've ever received at this place."
George T.,"Thousand Oaks, United States",132,26,8,1.0,27/4/2016,Burnt burger. Terrible food and service. Won't be back.don't bother. Drive on by. You'd be better off at the quickie mart.
Ryan S.,"Clovis, United States",0,3,,1.0,10/5/2016,The host doesn't watch the door and is oblivious to who is next even if youve been waiting behind  people.I ordered three steaks med rare with grilled vegetables and loaded baked potatoes. The waitress was friendly but came out twenty minutes later saying they were out of baked potatoes and grilled vegatables. She offered to load some mash potatoes and give us steamed vegetables.  The food came out without steak knives and missing one of the sour cream. Two steaks were over cooked and not flavored or buttered at all. Young staff and are not trained or care. Lots of smiling though. I got the check without a breakdown of the bill and seemed too much especially after all the mistakes should been reduced. They also  put tablets in front of your kids that cost money to use.  This restaurant spent money to overhaul decor but needs to spend money training it's staff.
Noelle N.,"Clovis, United States",0,30,2,3.0,12/6/2015,I used to get the 2 for 20$ which included an appetizer and I would get the sirloin and the honey bbq chicken. They always cook my steak properly.  They have since taken the sirloin off the 2 for 20 menu which is disappointing but I realize they have to keep costs down and that is a lot of food for 20 bucks. Now I just get the sirloin by itself and it is still only $12.99 and includes baked potato and veggies. The honey barbeque chicken is to die for.
Daira Y.,"Fresno, United States",1,3,,1.0,14/12/2015,"Started off with the waitress talking about drinking alcohol to my 13 year old...  Order dinner, waited an hour, received completely cold food for all 3 of us.  When they called the manager we told him the food was cold and he said ok.  That's it.  No I'm sorry, no explanation or excuse, no offer to make it right.  We then suggested he give us the bill for our drinks and followed him to pay.  He didn't have change in the drawer so he very rudely passed us off to the waitress.  Disappointed (since we tried to take my daughter out to congratulate her on her choir performance) we ended up at fast food but at least it was hot!"
Lyssa R.,"Sanger, United States",0,8,4,1.0,28/12/2014,"Atmosphere was good. Drinks came out fast. Server took forever to bring out apitizers plus additional drinks. Never brough sauces that we asked for, had to ask another server. Food took an hour had to ask server to cancel she said they would be right out. Got food and it was cold. Really? After an hour and it still came out cold.  Will never go again. Worst experiwnce ever. Manager shelia took care of issues."
Kathleen A.,"Fresno, United States",15,6,3,1.0,10/12/2013,"1. 25 min wait with 10 tables open. 2. While waiting the couple next to us sees a roach walking on counter.  3. Right after that a family is talking to manager,manager leaves the husband turns to us and says ""SERVICE SUCKS LEAVE!!!!!""  So we did.  Only reason for star is cause we had to."
Auggie Y.,"Fresno, United States",1,2,,1.0,14/12/2015,First of all 1 star is even to much the waitress ask for our drinks the wife and I had a beer my daughter a Pepsi then she proceeds to talk to my daughter about alcohol mind you she's 13 got the appetizers in decent time had to hunt down some saucers for the boneless wings then 30 min later asked about the food and the waitress said I haven't been back there let me go check on it when she brings our plates everything was cold so she got the manager his reply OK no sorry didn't offer a discount nothing just you want me to make you another one so I said no I'll pay for my drinks and go elsewhere guy should have scratch the tab all together don't wast your money your better off going to Taco Bell up shaw and Armstrong were their food is always hot and fresh props to Taco Bell.
Katherine S.,"Fresno, United States",83,23,8,1.0,13/9/2014,"Got my food 40 mins late. On top of that my food came out cold. On top of that, other people in my table got their food late. They sang ""happy birthday"" poorly. Like the girl that sang the song started laughing in the middle of the song and blamed the others for why they sucked. If we asked for extras like extra sauce, the waitress would forget and never bring it out. Everything was horrible."
Stacy C.,"Clovis, United States",0,6,,2.0,24/3/2016,"We had to wait over a half an hour for a table even though there were empty tables. Mashed potatoes were cold, and the Chipotle sauce on the chicken fajita wrap was non-existent.   And the sorry excuse for a side of fries consisted of about half the fries you would find in a small bag of Mikey D's fries."

Jaeson H.,"Sanger, United States",87,11,8,1.0,23/8/2014,"In simple terms I'm going to loose my mind from the incredibly poor service. The only redeeming quality was how nice the hostess was. Food was cold, waitress was clueless the manager took no action to resolve the situation. All in all a horrible experience."
Kue X.,"Fresno, United States",0,6,,1.0,6/3/2016,"Applebee's have horrible service, we sat down for 20 mins without greetings and our drinks, hate the service, food is ok, one star only because of the food. Don't recommend this place."
Victoria D.,"Fresno, United States",1,3,,1.0,7/10/2014,This place sucks. We got here 45 minutes ago and the waitress finally brought my appetizer guess what... It was COLD now were still waiting for our food plus appetizer. I wont be coming back
Champaigne M.,"Fresno, United States",24,105,621,1.0,3/11/2015,"to all the people that is considering this location. do not come here!! unless u want to experience  bad service. homegirl ""hostess"" on this night date and 9p.m time clearly needs to learn some customer service etiquette. dats rite!! i said it.  once we walked in there was a dry ass greeting of ""hi"". and that was it. didn't take our name down to be seated. so i sat my ass down along with rest people that was there before us. she then called us up by table for 2. girl who is u talking to...  there were other table for 2 waiting. dunno name of our waiter but she did take our order. before that she mentioned that if we weren't ready to order that she was going to move on to a party table first and come back to us. when we got our food up and served to us by another individual he gave us our food n walked away. we didn't get no forks spoon napkin. we thought he was going to get it.. but after 10-15 min of waiting and staring at each other and our food.  i didn't want to start eating my nachos with out napkin. but anyways  i took upon myself to wonder with my eyes  for damn employees our way but then  saw a tub of napkin rolled up with steak knife and fork at hostess station.. so i jus had to get up n get my damn self.. we ate damn food n waited good 15-20 min just so home girl waiter here pass by to give us our check. lord jesus all bad.   we had no steak sauce either.  this place have such bad service, management needs improvement for real. not to mention i saw the bartender serving up food to people that weren't even at the bar.  it shows how ridiculously this location need to get it together.  n no we didn't tip shit. my tip. stay outta dark alleys. smh on this place"
Meng V.,"Clovis, United States",0,1,,1.0,1/8/2014,Thursday night didn't look so busy. Our waitress was nice but it seemed under staffed.  Waited a long time for my drink because they ran out of cups?! Forgot another drink. Took forever for our tab. Always happen to have bad service when I come once in a blue moon. Bartenders were sloppy and slow.
