Natalia B.,"Austin, TX",104,585,96,3.0,9/28/2016,"So tonight my daughter and I were passing through and decided to stop. Randomly when we entered, a woman was set up doing face painting for kids...for free. Applebee's must've hired her as a perk. My kid liked it, so thumbs up to that even though it was a little weird.  The service was great. We were seated promptly and our server was attentive   The food was good and out quickly. We didn't have to wait on the bill.  Wait. Oh the bill. I had two Stella's while I was there. Do you know how much they cost? $6.49 apiece! I could've nearly bought two 6 packs for that price. So that's why I dropped it one star.  The other star I took away simply because I will never give a chain 5 stars."
Demnis M.,"Hawley, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/28/2017,"Service sucked. The bartender was more concerned with flirting with the waitress. What appears to be the manager has no control or no desire to try and take control. As I write this two waitresses are painting their fingernails at the bar station. (True story). There are a total of five tables occupied and someone had to get up and ask for the check. The employees seem to have their own table that they eat and congregate at, and yes this includes the manager. Don't waste your time or money.  I'm sure there must be a Taco Bell around here somewhere."
Ethan J.,"Clovis, NM",0,11,,1.0,10/29/2017,"It's already a pretty low point when I have to eat at Applebee's, but this place brings it down every further. The food here is absolutely trash and the service is slow. The servers certainly uphold the golden standard for Clovis, by being some of the worst in the state. I'll never eat here again."
Loni F.,"Midlothian, VA",47,25,31,5.0,11/11/2016,Came for vets day meal and everyone was friendly and food was great. They've improved greatly since the last time I have eaten here.
Chris P.,"Clovis, NM",5,15,,1.0,5/9/2017,We went out to eat with another couple to give Applebee's one more chance  the other couple ordered the onion soup and told the waitress to please make sure it's hot and for the third time it came not even close to hot. There won't be a fourth time.  The food was just ok.  The waitress was really nice.  But the four of us are not going back.
Brendon J.,"Clovis, NM",29,2,,2.0,11/26/2016,"The food was good, but the silverware was disgusting! Check your silverware, they brought us out more and they where nasty too. No apologies or anything, worst Applebee's I've been too!"
Ben L.,"Denver, CO",0,12,,1.0,9/5/2015,"Dirty silverware - really takes me back to the ol' bachelor days.  Give it a wipe and a rinse and good to go.  In a restaurant chain... Not so much.   Main complaint: horrid mixed drinks.  Takes 10 mins to deliver a potion brewed of corn syrup and watered down Tequila.  Mr Applebee is turning in his grave at this very moment.   My time at the Clovis Applebee's can be described much the same as my overall visit to Clovis - equal parts disgust, boredom, and impotent rage."
Mila P.,"Carson City, NV",0,12,5,1.0,4/6/2016,"when we get in there only 4 tables used for customer and ahead of us have 2 people waiting the waitress come to them,waitress try yo keep busy their self which is no customer! after 10mins 1 waitress coming ang give us a menu and leave then come back in 12mins! we ordered and another 15mins serve the salad! and the 4 waitress they ate on the otherside table eating and talking like a customer! the waitress she even join them talking and the next table to us  they need to clean up and they dont even care! Owner of this restuarant need to change all the people working here,they got exact  salary from the owner but restaurant no income!  Food arrived finally!! in 46mins! poor service!!!"
Candace J.,"Shreveport, LA",41,3,,1.0,3/19/2016,"Cold food.  Waited 10-15 minutes or longer for a drink.  Friendly waiter, but cook did not do an acceptable job nor did the bar tender.  I hope they get their act together."
Amy C.,"Palma Ceia, FL",0,6,,1.0,3/12/2016,"We sat so long, our seats were warmer than the food that came out.  Waitress forgot our appetizer...even though it was the first thing she wrote down.   By the time we got our check, we were hungry again.  Too bad there's no negative stars."
Jessie T.,"Clovis, NM",78,63,34,1.0,12/23/2014,"I would avoid at all costs.  Not kidding.  May I tell you the plight of this place? For one, sanitation. I would know. The dish machine has cockroaches stuck inside the panels. The ice machine has never been cleaned. The cooks rarely wear gloves. I've witnessed cooks grabbing their crotches and touching raw food. They use tongs to touch raw chicken and then use it to touch cooked food.  When a product expires managers are informed to print a new ""use by date"" and replace the old one. Most products are held at improper temperatures. Food is often dropped on the floor and placed back on the grill/flat top. This is just the beginning...BTW don't eat the pico, chicken or steaks!  The bar: Beer lines are never cleaned. Those lovely shots? Mostly short poured. Ice bins dirty. Wine out of date. Often if you order a premium you will get well instead. Regulars may drink as much as possible but if the bartenders, curly haired female manager, large blonde haired manager or old blonde large manager doesn't like you be prepared to be cut off and treated poorly. Often staff will eat those fries off your plate before you receive your plate. If you send something back the staff will eat it right next to food going out. People have had ""relations"" in the bathrooms and on tables. I could say a lot more but do yourself a favor and do NOT eat here."
Christian M.,"Aromas, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/17/2016,"I was skeptical to eat here due to all of the negative reviews it had but to my surprise the whole experience was great. Our waitress was Santana and she was very nice &a helpful and quick with refills and our appetizers & food were brought out in a timely fashion. Overall, great service & food. Will come back soon"
Thomas N.,"Albuquerque, NM",142,16,,3.0,10/19/2015,"I ordered a steak medium rare delivered well, second steak medium rare to rare the server did not seem to care, had to request manager. Manager addressed issue. Could not connect to the internet with Windows 10, so I could not complete work while enjoying a beer."
Sean H.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,2,,1.0,2/19/2016,Waited 15 minutes to be seated at a table that was empty the whole time.  Salad had frozen lettuce. Service mediocre at best.   My daughter's ribbs were barely warm.  I'll never visit this place again.
Michael D.,"Phoenix, AZ",90,5,,1.0,1/19/2016,"Trash....clovis in a nut shell. I only gave this place 1 star because it exists, and for Clovis that means alot.  Applebee's is usually an ok place to go for drinks and food but Clovis, NM  and its imbreds really have a huge impact on this place.  The servers I experienced where one day away from relapsing on meth, the food was overcooked and rubbery, the beer was mediocre at best, and my friends girlfriends drink tasted of corn syrup and ice with a drop of shitty tequila.  My water glass had lipstick stains on it, which is scary because girls in Clovis do not know what makeup or lipstick is.  Stay away from this shit hole...hell stay away from clovis."
Omar H.,"San Diego, CA",114,30,,3.0,11/3/2015,"The service was good, the waitress was a total sweetheart. If I remember right her name was Estrella R. She consistently checked on us to make sure we were all okay.  The food was okay, could have been better and it took awhile but the fact that we were traveling all day and starving, it hit the spot."
Erica S.,"Raleigh, NC",387,193,922,2.0,3/6/2014,"Got a Caesar salad and my lettuce was frozen. My friend ordered a steak with a side of green beans and the green beans were not cooked. Service is slow, food is decent if cooked right. I would highly recommend just ordering car side to go to avoid the experience.  Drinks are good! I love their sangrias"
Jorge L.,"Portales, NM",76,1,,1.0,7/14/2015,"Ordered steak and I got chicken, also I didn't know appetizers were served after the main dish"
Jennifer R.,"San Antonio, TX",22,18,1,1.0,9/18/2014,"Gnat in my drink, rude cooks, no type of customer service skills. The list literally could go on forever. I was reminded today why I haven't eaten at this Applebee's in a year. Terrible is not even a strong enough word to describe this place. Avoid this place at all costs."
Daniel C.,"Pasadena, CA",6,4,,3.0,7/2/2014,"Decent place. Again like Red Lobster, overall management has changed the style from a ""dive"" to a decent eatery over the past few years. Food is good, price is a bit high for what we got and the service was decent."
Dan N.,"Chandler, AZ",10,4,2,1.0,12/2/2013,Unbelievable slow service...my coworker ordered a grilled cheese and it came out cold. No melted cheese. When he sent it back they brought it back a minute later. Apparently microwaves heat soup but don't do much for grilled cheese. He had to send it back a second time. Avoid this place!
Ryan V.,"Clovis, NM",1,8,,4.0,1/13/2014,"I ate here with the wife and kids on a Friday night. The service was just okay. The food was served hot and was cooked as ordered. I had steak fajitas medium well. Note for next time, order medium because the hot skillet it is served on will cook the steak past medium well before it can be totally eaten. The wife and kids liked their food. They have an excellent selection of menu items. I have to recommend their blondie for dessert. One of my all time favorite restaurant chain desserts. It is a lot of sweet but it works for this dish. The ice tea was good. This will more than likely be a go-to place for meals here in Clovis."
Chet S.,"Clovis, NM",2,2,,2.0,11/25/2014,"Continuing to go down hill. Last two visits have been very disappointing. Very skimpy on fries both times, about 15 each time. New burger was tasty but small and charged $9.99. Will be a while before I go back ."
