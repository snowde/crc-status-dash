Melissa R.,"Gilford, NH",28,115,404,4.0,4/8/2015,"Hadn't  been to this Applebee's for quite a while, so figured I'd  give it a try again.  It was early for lunch so the restaurant was pretty empty upon arrival. The greeter at the door was very friendly and welcoming. It was a very cold day and it was nice and toasty inside along with being very clean and nicely decorated. Applebee's has quite an extensive menu and it was hard to choose. Everything sounded so good! I decided to go with the mushroom cheeseburger and it was a great choice. The burger was cooked to perfection and the roll was nicely toasted. Fries were fresh and hot and more than plentiful.  The waiter was very pleasant and attentive, but not overly so. He knew just when to appear! The restaurant became quite busy and it was nice to observe the waitstaff continue to smile and be attentive to their patrons. Definitely a place I'll return to!"
Tyler T.,"Chichester, NH",1,7,1,5.0,6/3/2017,"Decent food, had a awesome server(bill) if you choose to stop by ask for him! Very friendly and always finds a way to spark up conversation. A nice personal touch.."
David L.,"Concord, NH",15,93,1,1.0,2/21/2016,"My wife ordered the shrimp salad. Got the worst food poisoning of her life. Hives,  red rash, diarrhea, stomach pain, prickly skin, headache, etc. Only thing she ate yesterday so we know where it came from. Watch out because they use tainted food."
Joel H.,"Boca Raton, FL",27,12,11,4.0,3/29/2016,"Went to Applebee's recently for the first time in at least a year, and was pleasantly surprised. Still a pretty run-of-the-mill chain restaurant, but the menu had changed a lot since I'd last been in. Friendly service and the food was pretty good, not a bad spot for lunch. Definitely less crowded than 99. The 4-cheese Mac and Cheese with honey-pepper chicken tenders is yummy"
Matt G.,"Londonderry, NH",0,2,,1.0,7/4/2016,"I'm writing my first Yelp review because this was epically bad...  Came here for a late dinner after a day of bbqing poolside. Literally all we were looking for was any sort of food and unfortunately for us Applebees was the only thing open. As we walked in we actually laughed about this being a poor life decision... Our party of 3 was seated by Aaron in the bar area even though there were empty booths throughout the restaurant. Aaron turned out to be our waiter also and it took way too long to get three waters for us with lemons. Water came, we told him we were ready to order and he informed us he'll be right back. So a few more minutes pass and we placed our order. After 20 minutes, Aaron came back to the table with a menu. He literally said, ""we can't make it for you"" and handed me a menu. I chose the easiest thing on the menu, a club sandwich (at this point we just want food.) 15 more minutes our food arrived much to our dismay. My club sandwich wasn't a club sandwich, it was a somewhat grilled cheese with partially melted cheese. The shrimp stir fry featured partially cooked shrimp. (See a common theme?) And the fajita rollup had an astounding 4 pieces of spongy chicken, cheese, and lettuce. We also ordered a side of ""wood-grilled"" vegetables that came out after Aaron asked us how the food was. Again partially cooked, with just the slightest of grill marks on them.  All in all, Applebees has made it to the list of restaurants I will NEVER eat at again. I'm praying none of us get the food poisoning that wad mentioned in another post. AWFUL!"
Cheryl J.,"Warner, NH",0,21,,5.0,4/8/2016,"""Eric the Bartender!""  The food was good, nothing over the top, but it didn't have to be. Eric, the bartender, well that is what gets this place five stars! Why? Anybody can make a drink. But, sadly, not everybody can make the experience that goes along with a drink. Eric has a great vibe and positive tone. He was busy with many regulars and had a smile on his face the entire time I was there. Thanks Eric for a wonderful, albeit, short afternoon!"
milly f.,"Manchester, NH",0,11,,4.0,4/1/2016,Haven't  been to this Applebee's before. Fish and chips was delicious. Cole slaw fresh and tasty. Enough for 2 to share.  My friend had Mac and cheese  with honey crusted chicken tenders. Mac had 4 cheeses but  still not heavy tasting. William B our server  was attentive and lunch was delivered quickly. Definitely recommend and would go back when I m in the area. Also plates were warm which was a nice touch.
Jim O.,"Suncook, NH",0,3,,1.0,7/26/2014,Just came from there and the food was awful. I should have pick up on the manager at people's table  complaining and offering there money back. Don't waste your money.
skot s.,"Miami, FL",0,56,,4.0,10/30/2015,"Finally I can write a super great review !  Yes Applebee's in Concord NH made our dinner evening from going down hill, to thanks from Mgr. Ben Kirkwood made all the poor service and wrong food orders from kitchen work out just perfect.   He noticed we were having problems with lousy service, finally food arrives uncooked, with No clean forks left for us to use.  Yes that is true, this location had a shortage of plastic water & soda glasses to no forks available for us.  Mr. Kirkwood, came right over to make all this wrong right, and make our dinner just perfect.  Desert was on the house, and Yes we will return again.   Hard to find anyone who could do anything right sometimes, but Mr. Kirkwood made it all fly right.  Woohoo to Applebee's."
Scott L.,"Dover, NH",10,6,,4.0,3/12/2014,Always a great experience here. Appetizers and food is always prepared to our liking and fast to be served. Service is great and servers are personal and not robotic. Pretty great for a chain restaurant!
Sarah S.,"Plymouth, NH",10,47,136,3.0,1/17/2013,Long wait but the quesadilla burger and spinach artichoke dip was so worth it.....yummy yum yum.
Carey F.,"Honolulu, HI",45,43,14,5.0,9/8/2010,"I'm from Hawaii. There is NO Applebee's in Hawaii, but we get your commercials all the time! I had to go!  It was WONDERFUL! Its open and comfortable, the server was engaging and attentive, and didn't ask how we were when our mouths were full ;)  The Manager came by and said hello to every table, which was very very friendly, and the food!  OMG the food was really good. The chicken was perfect, and most places over cook it; the vegetables were not too raw and not too soggy the potatos were not to plain and not too salty. My only complaint is that there is NO APPLEBEES'S IN HAWAII!!! WHY???"
Bryan M.,"Concord, NH",5,35,,2.0,10/26/2012,"Went back into this location to do a follow-up review on since the last experience wasn't pleasurable at all. Follow-up:  I was greeted with a smile by a server named Bill who sat me in the lounge area which was appropriate since I was by myself. It took the server 2 minutes to come over and greet my table even though she was standing next to the bar. When the server came over she didn't even mention her name to me or greet me with a smile. I asked  her what was in the slaw in the chicken wonton. She wasn't sure and started giving random answers to try and satisfy me then she just walked away came back and didn't give me an answer she was sure of.  She could've said ""I'm not sure but Ill go find out for you, i'll+ be right back""   The manager was on phone at the bar the for pretty much  the whole time with his back facing the guests. The bartender isn't professional at all and told the same set of guest 3 times what her name was because she couldn't remember if she remembered to tell them and then tells the guests she isn't used to telling people and she only did because her manager was right there.   Once the food came out the pan for steak was not sizzling, loaded mashed potatoes didn't really have any cheese or bacon on it, the fries were cold like they were sitting for a while.  I asked Jane the shift leader who just happen to be standing at the host stand right behind me if I could have some hotter fries, and she was extremely happy to assist me and apologetic about the situation. Great guest recovery skills. The decor is very nice the concord wall wrap It would be nice if they would've highlighted maybe political history instead of all the beer light up neon signs. As this does no justice as a family environment  This store seems to be designed around the bar versus being a restaurant."
Scott B.,"Boscawen, NH",0,12,,2.0,3/14/2013,Took forever to get drinks and appetizer. Ordered artichoke spinach dip and it was stone cold. Sent back and told it happens sometimes.  They clearly just microwaved it to warm it up. The bowl was extremely hot but the dip barely warm. Oriental chicken salad was good but wife ordered one of their steaks and asked for it rare. It came well done yet Sautéed onions were raw.  Waitress was slow and obnoxious.
Robert A.,"Manchester, NH",215,48,55,2.0,6/15/2010,"The food is your typical  Applebee's food, the service was a little on the slow side, I think our waitress was a little overwhelmed with all her tables. it's the old style Applebee's décor... Overall not bad."
