Madelene P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,21,3,3.0,6/28/2010,"In the past, the only reason why I've been here was because my family had a gift card for it...not really because we wanted to. Â The spinach and artichoke dip is pretty great though. I'm a fan of artichoke, it's a great vegetable but to have cheese baked in with it, makes it delectable. So you should choose that as an appetizer. The burgers? Hm, I'm not sure. I never had them. I wished they had a vegetarian burger but they dont. So that's pretty disappointing. Overrall, the place is pretty great. The food is all american but it's nothing to brag about. The staff that works here are friendly and welcoming. This is a good choice for lunch if you don't want to drive far and just stay in Conyers."

They claimed they were busy but the resturant was not even full. they had plenty of open tables, then my waitor was rude and took forever. the food was alright but i was not a happy camper at this place.."
