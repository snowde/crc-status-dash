Michelle H.,"Dickinson, TX",0,47,57,5.0,5/30/2017,"Had a great dinner. Unfortunately I didn't realize that the dinner came with a side in addition to the red potatoes. So I choose a side of loaded potatoes....and shamefully, I ate them both .  Everything was well prepared & tasted delicious."
Ansel A.,"Dallas, TX",737,97,13,3.0,7/23/2017,"Waitress was good, very friendly and checked on us often but forgot shit all the time, like 2 sweet teas one unsweet.  Then was like yall can just use sugar. Didn't make the two 80 + yr Olds in my party happy.  They had 2 for 20. Fried mozz,  came out quick but underdone and tasted like maybe they had been frying ahead.  Chicken tenders of my moms, ok, again not hot. Some kind of grilled chicken on rice pilaf, he really liked. Cranberries nice in rice.  Mine chicken fajita wrap, not much chicken, and sloppily put together. Steak and bbean soup, good flavor but beans not cooked thoroughly and hard. Replacement French onion was fine.  Not Dallas standards but fine in the country."
Whitney V.,"Pearland, TX",38,160,277,3.0,5/22/2016,"Our visit started out by a waitress trying to bring us someone else's appetizers. After another few minutes, another waitress asked if we had been greeted. When she asked how long we had been waiting, I said four or five minutes and she made a face like she didn't believe me and said, ""It hasn't really been that long, has it?"" I tried to stay polite and said we had had enough time to make it through the menu to decide what we wanted and had been waiting several minutes while at least two waitresses waited on the tables all around us. She apologized and took our order. If she wasn't supposed to be our waitress, which she acted like was the case, I'm not sure who it was supposed to be because no one else ever visited our table. However, one waitress waited on tables on both sides of us but never stopped by ours. Our food came out relatively quickly, like perhaps they had rushed our orders for us, which was nice. Everything tasted well and was as we expected so our visit was good the rest of the time. However, the table behind us was shorted two sides with their dishes and had to wait for the sides to come out while they ate the rest of their meals. And a couple across the aisle had to send back their steak because it wasn't cooked as much as she had requested. I'm not sure if it's a staff training issue or mostly a kitchen issue, but this Applebee's is struggling. As a major thoroughfare from Dallas to Houston, I hope they improve their service quality for as many customers as they probably get from travelers."
Butch V.,"Streetman, TX",0,21,,3.0,11/2/2017,Went for lunch - staff was friendly but seems like the prices are kinda high for the amount served. Right off interstate 45 near a few other restaurants we will try
Bob M.,"Aspen, CO",0,3,,4.0,3/6/2017,"We stop here quite often typically for drinks and appetizers and occasionally for a late lunch when traveling from Dallas to home. We are usually here in the late afternoon and have always had a pleasant experience largely due to our excellent server, Mike, who is always attentive. For appetizers we especially enjoy the Sriracha Shrimp and the Grilled Chicken Wonton Tacos."
Kaeleigh J.,"Spring, TX",142,3,,5.0,5/16/2016,"Never been to an Applebee's, I stopped here yesterday and was very impressed with the cheeseburger/fries, service and clean atmosphere that I came here again today on way home to Houston. Will be back when I head North in the future!"
Jennifer H.,"Waxahachie, TX",3,20,4,4.0,7/9/2015,Struggling with consistency in food prep and service. Usually good. Not great. They do not make a drinkable Long Island ice tea.
Randi S.,"Plano, TX",47,15,4,3.0,12/24/2015,"Nothing special... Typical chain food. However, waitress never offered to refill hubby's water. Guess she figured since it was Christmas Eve she could slack on service and still receive 20%. Bummer."
Kim N.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,2.0,7/22/2016,Food is definitely not the best. Do not order the pasta if you actually like chicken on it. Barely any on there and I had to order more. Manager wasn't that helpful either. Brandon was great though.
Heather F.,"Morgan Hill, CA",42,13,,4.0,10/29/2015,"I actually love this place. My friends and I always go here. The food isn't the best. We go for the great appetizers, the expensive drinks, the awesome staff and  the good conversation we provide. I've been here several times either with my friends, by myself or on a date. I always get treated with respect and the staff is always friendly to me. Plus, they have Wi-Fi and I'm all about that Wi-Fi. The entrées aren't necessarily the best, thus only 4 stars instead of 5, but the appetizers rock. I had to give them a good review after reading some bad ones. This is one of my favorite places in Corsicana."
Katherine P.,"Omaha, NE",20,28,36,2.0,3/1/2015,"The service was uncomfortable in the bar area but the good was really good. I was having lunch with a friend and her daughter, Nya, who loves to play the jukebox. Nya had chosen a few Rhianna songs and the manager rushed over to her and told her she better start keeping it family friendly with her music choice. In any establishment, there is a choice as to what music you would like installed on the jukebox. The manager, Crystal, acted as though Nya was playing vulgar rap music. If you think Rhianna is vulgar, then maybe you should choose which music YOU think is "" family friendly "" in a neighborhood bar & grill so people don't come there to waste money on songs that will be skipped. We will not be returning to this location."
Bobby A.,"La Grange, TX",0,46,4,4.0,11/18/2013,"Came in on a Monday night. Not too many people. Greeted and seated fast. Calvin took care of me. Nice guy, checked on me often - but not too often. Had the BLT and the chicken wonton tacos. All of it was good. Wonton had just enough heat to make it great.  Ask for Calvin if you come in. He'll take good care of you."
Pappa C.,"Chatfield, TX",20,124,113,1.0,10/9/2014,"Have not found any food there that was to my liking, frozen never fresh, service is fine,fast seating, better places down town and down 7th ave for fresh food. till glad that corsicana is starting to some more places to eat just want better than this."
Ben W.,"La Porte, TX",0,10,8,4.0,11/18/2014,Good service decently prepared food. The drinks where good and strong. Location is somewhat convent off I-45. $20 for 2 meals offers a good value. I would return when traveling through the area
K. B.,"Monterey, CA",3,116,,2.0,2/9/2014,"Service was fine even though they were busy. The food was terrible. Apps were cold burgers came out wrong there was a hair in the fries, some crazy thick black burnt chip in the bottom of our basket, and a frozen fry. Just not a fan. We shoulda known from the reviews."
John H.,"Corsicana, TX",3,33,28,3.0,8/21/2013,"service is ok the food is great ,,, but some times I have had to wait an hour for my food ,, we have spoken to the management ,,,,, but its still a gamble ,,, every thing is good to eat here,,,, others that been here have walked out from the long wait too,,,  if you eat here a lot you will find out for your self,,,,,,,,"
