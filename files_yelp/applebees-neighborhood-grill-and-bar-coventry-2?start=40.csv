Kristi L.,"Concord, CA",60,227,13,3.0,3/17/2013,"Love my neighborhood Applebee's. This location is clean and recently remodeled. Staff is always friendly, and my order is always accurate when using the carside to go."
Geoff R.,"East Hampton, CT",62,121,174,2.0,10/23/2012,I was reminded why I don't go to Applebee's the food is simply fast food with a full bar and flat screens.
Lincoln P.,"Exeter, RI",0,4,1,1.0,8/1/2014,Just ordered carside to go and wanted to remove an item from my order and substitute another item. (This is something that I have done for years and never had a problem.) The lady on the phone said that she will have to ask the manager. Then came back with that I couldn't do that because they couldn't account for the food.... So if I wanted fries with my order instead of mashed potatos Â I guess you can't do that either right? What ever happened to customer satisfaction? Is applebees under some new (poor) management?
