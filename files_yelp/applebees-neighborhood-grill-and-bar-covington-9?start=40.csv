Paul H.,"Kent, WA",0,2,,5.0,3/24/2015,great place eat there a lot. try the triple chocolate cake and ice cream. prices are reasonable
Kirk M.,"Prosser, WA",0,25,,2.0,2/21/2012,"Staff is usually good and the food is usually bad. They don't seem to buy their food locally, it rarely tastes fresh.  Last time I was there, I had one of the 600 calorie dishes - Lime chicken fiasco...er, fiesta?  It tasted like a frozen Jenny Craig dish from the microwave, and for $10. Salads are fine, and sometimes the 2 for $20 are good. I eat at Applebee's on business trips in other towns.  All of them rate better than this one."
M G.,"Kent, WA",18,23,1,2.0,7/3/2012,It's applebees. You are getting ok service and pre prepared food. Simple. Family friendly. Nothing special.
Anthony A.,"Black Diamond, WA",90,11,1,4.0,3/9/2013,"I've been coming here for years and have rarely gotten anything less than great service. The wings are my new addiction, definitely try them out"
Jennifer M.,"Snoqualmie, WA",23,40,18,4.0,8/19/2012,"We come here quite a bit! The chicken wings, chinese chicken salad and weight watcher meals are my faves. Service is always friendly. Good place to pop in with the family, relax and enjoy a meal anytime."
Amber B.,"Federal Way, WA",90,141,19,4.0,5/21/2012,"This Applebee's saved us.  We had planned to go to The Rock WFP down the street with ~35 people for a club volleyball team party on Friday, May 18th.  They had told us over the phone that they did not take reservations but that they could accommodate us if we showed up 30 minutes early - no problem.  Long story short, that was not the case when we showed up (full review on The Rock WFP Covington Yelp  ).  Luckily, Applebee's down the street could accommodate all 35 of us in the same area at a moments notice. It was a bit awkward because we were not separate from the rest of the restaurant, but the servers did great. The girls (U15 vball club) moved around quite a bit so they often brought food out to a table that no longer had the people who ordered it sitting at it. They were all great sports and I hope they all got tipped well.  The food came out quickly considering how busy they were and everyone left happy.  We will definitely think of them before the Rock from now on."
Honest R.,"Snohomish, WA",0,78,6,2.0,1/4/2011,"Food mediocre.   Hostess was horrible seating us.  We could not sit were she wanted us because the tables were too close together.  I asked her if we can move to a Booth.  She said the Booth next to us is taken.   I told her that I could not sit because the tables were too close together.  She was not accommodating at all.  I had to sit in the isle were everyone walks until I talked to our waiter.  The hostess was a young call who could not care any less.  I got no apology from her or the manager.  We noticed a lot of immaturity amongst all the waiters except ours.  One waiter yells out "" tables clean!  ""  she waved her hand up and was very loud.  I am giving 2 stars and not 1 because our waiter was nice and professional."
McKenna A.,"Renton, WA",2,63,,3.0,6/14/2011,"Hit or miss.  Some visits have been great, others have been not-so-great.  I guess it depends on your waiter/waitress.  Food is great as long as they bring it out when its still hot.  They could be a little better at keeping soda's refilled.  What's the point in paying $4 on a bottomless lemonade if they never refill it??"
Rich H.,"Kent, WA",8,14,3,4.0,1/22/2009,"This was our first visit to any Applebee's, ever.  I must say it was a very pleasant experience.  As usual, we went early, around 4 PM on a Thursday.  The restaurant wasn't busy. Our server was Cherie and since things were rather quiet she was able to attend to us easily but not too often, so her timing was just right. We went to Applebee's to try out their Weight Watchers menu items.  By the way, you might think that the portions would be unusually small but that was not the case.  However, if you are eager for a 16oz steak than my dinner was under weight.   We started out with Onion Soup au Gratin.  This was very good.  It rated a 4 out of 5. As main courses, we had the Garlic Herb Chicken and the Steak with Portobellos.  I am the portobello fan, so that was my entree.  Here is where the steak size mattered, it was only 4 ounces. It was cooked exactly as requested and surprisingly was more than enough after the onion soup.  The garlic herb chicken was a larger portion and my wife was not able to finish her entire entree. Both entrees came with ample portions of steamed broccoli and herbed potatoes.  Each entree gets 4 out of 5. They dropped down 1 because the chicken could have been a bit more ""herby"" and the sauce on the steak could have been a little less salty.  We consider these very minor issues. We finished off the meal with coffee and the chocolate raspberry layer cake.  The cake had been taken off the main menu, but our waitress discovered that it was still available.  Speaking of our waitress, she was very, very good.  As mentioned earlier she attended to our needs and several moments reminded us of Roy's in Hawaii, where she came by and cleared away empty sweetener packets, filled glasses, etc. with the stealth of an experienced server.  Earning positive points with each visit to our table.  She gets a 5 out of 5. The atmosphere was quiet and the decor is sports themed.  The seating area surrounds the bar and each are open to the other, so that if the bar was crowded, the noise level might be an issue.  However, it was not a problem with our visit.  There is sports memorabilia literally everywhere along with numerous TVs strategically placed so that everyone has a clear view.  This isn't important to us and they were not distracting. Cost was very reasonable and we will definitely return. Update:  I forgot to mention that the music at this Applebee's was just right for us, a mix of new and old.   For folks using Weight Watchers, Applebee's listed all the nutritional values for their menu items.  This makes it easy to make good choices and be a bit more adventurous when reaching the dreaded dessert menu."
Jenny D.,"Kent, WA",52,13,,2.0,11/17/2010,"I unfortunately keep giving Applebees a chance every couple years or so and get disappointed each time. Their food continues to taste like something that has been previously frozen and is bland. No more chances, I'm done!"
Amanda S.,"Black Diamond, WA",0,20,,4.0,12/27/2012,Sangrias are tasty! Food is meh. Do love coming here to drink tho :)
Kay S.,"Kent, WA",3,22,9,2.0,5/2/2012,"Tried this place for the first time.  I ordered pasta and got a huge bite of cold sauce!  I had to spit it back onto my plate.  The chicken on my pasta was extremely dry. The staff did correct my meal and brought me dessert.  So, I'm glad that they tried to fix it."
Treye H.,"Covington, WA",114,15,1,4.0,3/14/2011,"Great meeting place and the ""go to"" place for drinks with associates after a long day at work.  Gotta get a salad!"
Mark S.,"Seattle, WA",170,37,13,4.0,4/20/2010,This place is awesome! waiters are very nice and good food too. If you want some late night experience and in low budget this is the place to go to.
Dave K.,"Auburn, WA",1,80,2,4.0,8/4/2010,"Dropped in after golf. Quickly seated, very polite and helpful wait staff,and good food - we had the 3-appetizer (both of us) plates. I recommend the Won Ton Tacos - they're great! A little slow coming out, but worth the wait!"
Carolyn H.,"Kent, WA",0,21,1,4.0,5/18/2010,"Applebees is pretty consistent with their food and with their staff.  They are always courteous and the food comes within a decent amount of time.  With a 3 year old and a newborn, this place is pretty family friendly.  We usually go for their breakfast which is served on Saturday and Sunday mornings (but they don't open till 10 so if you are an early riser this may not work for you.)"
Burger T.,"Auburn, WA",5,28,,2.0,8/20/2009,"This is a review of their A-1 Burger, it was part of their 2 for 20 deal and I thought I would give it a try. Lack of Bacon was disappointing, but I knew going in that it would be missing unless I paid extra, steak sauce, barely saw it or tasted it. Onion straws? It was a few pieces of grilled onion. The burger and bun were fine, even good, but the experienced billed wasn't what I got, just stick with a more basic burger if you go."
