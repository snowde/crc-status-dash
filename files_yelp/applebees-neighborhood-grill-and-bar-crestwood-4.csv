Renayle F.,"Willowbrook, IL",44,19,8,4.0,1/6/2018,"A little packed for Saturday night but we got a table quickly. Our waitress was nice and attentive. The food was good, but in our party of 4, me and another person got the bourbon chicken and shrimp and we didn't get any mushrooms. The waitress and manager apologized and said we'd get mushrooms, but then we found out later they ran out. It is a little crowded with the tables being close together. Maybe try to go here when it's not too crowded. Otherwise it's all right."
Dan O.,"Evergreen Park, IL",0,3,,1.0,1/3/2018,"Service was poor, food not much better. We were never asked for refills on drinks from our server. Ordered 3 appetizer meal with salad. One app came right away, others 10 mins later with salad. Kids cheeseburgers came without cheese and got yogurt side instead of fries. Took both back and cheeseburgers just had two cold slices of cheese on top when they came back. Truly an awful experience. Avoid this Applebee's."
Hazem A.,"Chicago, IL",16,5,,3.0,12/16/2017,"The food was really good. The server was very nice and attentive to our needs. The reason for the three stars is the atomesphere. The tables were so close to each other, the bar takes most of the space. Otherwise , I had a great time."
Dave D.,"Palos Heights, IL",0,29,1,1.0,10/15/2017,"Not a good restaraunt. Food was sent back twice for being extremly overcooked (steak ordered rare was very well done) , and other items came out raw (shrimp skewers were cold, almost fron on the inside). Service was below average. Could not seem to even get a ""free refill"" without having to ask several times over 30 minutes. With all of the problems we had, manager apologized and gave us 8.00 off the bill. Kinda sad for 25.00 worth of food i wasnt able to eat. (Actually 50.00+ worth of food since they couldnt get it right twice). The other meals at the table were ok, but not really freshest tasting."
Angela G.,"Markham, IL",31,3,1,5.0,11/21/2017,"Went for dinner here with family on a busy Friday night a few weeks ago.  Upon our departure, we mistakingly left a bank envelope with cash at the table. After searching for a few days, called Applebees and our wonderful waitress turned it in! So grateful for her and wanted all to know there are still honest people in this world, on top of great food/service. I dont want to post her name without her permission but did ask her manager to pass on a small reward we left for her."
Jenny T.,"Chicago, IL",61,3,,1.0,11/5/2017,I absolutely love Applebees food but I will NEVER return... the service at this location is by far the worst I have ever had.  The servers just stand there and stare at you instead of taking orders... it's very dirty in there as well. I work in the food industry ad I'm aware of how things work...... nobody WORKS there.
Mike O.,"Chicago, IL",7,214,,3.0,4/22/2017,"On our quest to try new different places at least twice a month, we were driving by this location and stopped in for dinner.  We were greeted at the outer door by the hostess and seated right away, which is always nice.  Was not really impressed with the menu selections, decided on a burger. I can't recall exactly the kind of burger I ordered, but what the menu described was not what I got.  Not willing to make a stink of a burger, I just kept it.  But I did order it medium well and it was a little more pink inside than I prefer.  Our server did come by a couple of times to check on us and made sure we were taken care of during the meal. The good, the restaurant is clean and free of any strange odors and the staff seemed to do their jobs.  The bad, a bit pricy for a burger meal and portions were on the small side."
Ash H.,"Hometown, IL",8,22,,4.0,9/4/2017,I haven't had Applebee's in so many year but I think they really stepped up their game with their food creations. The steak fajitas are very authentic tasting!
Douglas K.,"Tinley Park, IL",13,195,47,3.0,8/21/2016,This location is a typical Applebee's store.  Recently Applebees has moved some things around to make for a newer menu.   One gripe would be the service.  Our waitress was great and understood the process.  But the other day we observed employees complaining in the dining area about getting called in.  There were 2-3 employees complaining and not giving any regard to folks dining. Not the best experiences but what is expected from this chain.
Shawn G.,"La Grange, IL",0,6,1,1.0,9/3/2017,"Absolutely applorible service! We had Deja as our server...well I think we did since she introduced her self got a drink order and then didn't come back. The manager delivered drinks and took our order, and someone from the kitchen ended up delivering the food. Our ghost waitress Deja came back as it was delivered stopped 5 feet away said ""nah y'all good"" and walked away. Never saw her again. Couldn't take left overs since we never saw another employee and had to pay the bill electronic from the table. Shame on you applebees!"
Jenna R.,"Oak Lawn, IL",39,15,1,5.0,5/8/2017,"The fact that they weren't out of the three cheese mac & cheese was amazing! Roberto was so attentive and awesome, most personable server yet! Thank you for the great service!"
Marc D.,"Chicago, IL",2,187,148,4.0,3/14/2016,Good food I enjoyed my entrees but my date felt the food tasted bland. The place was empty and I was a little disappointed that it seemed like they had a problem getting me a seat. I think it had something to do with them cleaning up early. I usually tip well but I was just a little disappointed with the service.
Michelle S.,"Oak Forest, IL",40,14,28,5.0,6/3/2016,"Went to Applebee's  tonight had a GREAT experience,  from the hostess, Kayla, to the server Chris, to the food & dessert! My daughter, Madicyn  brought her sketch book, and the hostess wanted Madi to draw her a picture so she drew earth girl and melto man and the hostest in turn drew Madicyn her version of earth  girl and melto man and gave it to her. Madi HAD to have this picture framed  and hung up as soon as we got home! She is super happy about it! Thank you for a great experience tonight!"
Eric P.,"Midlothian, IL",0,3,,5.0,11/11/2017,"Today is Veteran's Day. We had server Jessica F. She was Awesome! She made me feel great for serving my country the moment I sat down at the table and also accomodated my family with a good seat since we have a newborn baby. She greeted me an offered to buy me a Bud Light. My favorite! She showed me a menu for veterans and let me know my meal was free for serving in the U.S. Air Force. The entire time there she was on point with having drinks refilled and was very friendly and took the time to thank me for my time in the Air Force. We spoke to her manager Sabrina who also was amazing to talk to regarding the wonderful experience and she gave me a $5 off coupon on my next visit. The service I received tonight by Jessica, Sabrina. and the rest of the staff of Applebees in Crestwood, IL has now made me a life long customer of this location. I will also now make it a tradition for myself and my family to come here on dinner nights out and for every Veteran's Day. Thank you for making my Veteran's Day meal very special."
Michelley M.,"Chicago, IL",19,108,18,1.0,5/1/2017,"This place is absolutely disgusting.  I went here on Sunday for lunch with my husband and 2 year old daughter and the place is filthy.  The floors were horrendously dirty, the table was sticky and gross.  We ordered the chips and salsa, stale chips and a salsa dish that was the size of a teaspoon.  Our meals were not good.  Clearly sitting around and cold food.  The only reason we went here was we had a couple gift cards.  I should have known better.  The service was terrible.  We waited 5 minutes after we got our food to be able to even ask for silverware because all the servers were MIA.  The place also has a funky smell.  I wish we never went.  I had a nasty taste in my mouth after we left from the disgusting food.  I am sorry but this place needs an overhaul.  Bad service, bad food, and disgusting conditions.  I still have thirty dollars left on one gift card but I definitely will never be back."
Gina C.,"Blue Island, IL",0,13,,1.0,5/27/2016,"The ""NEW"" menu brought me here try not only a new firewood grill..... But, new items as well.  I ordered the 6oz sirloin with the new garlicky greens beans and the SUPPOSEDLY bacon cheddar potatoes that tasted like they were made early this morning and given without being heated!Well, steak was the HARDEST steak I've ever eaten! Worse is that it was only medium cooked! Which it turn should be softer! But no! Aaaaaand the bacon cheesy potatoes was more like couple pieces of bacon and sour cream instead of cheese!!! NOPE!!!!! Don't be fooled people!!"
Frank S.,"Glendale Heights, IL",0,8,,3.0,12/27/2016,"Average, first time I came here 3 years ago before the last menu change the way it used to be was great went back about a year ago after the new menu was introduced didn't feel the same Applebee's vibe want super impressed by the portions/price however props to them trying something new they are still in my opinion better than Chili's. Never had a problem with the staff both times I visited which was also a plus"
Josh L.,"Alsip, IL",0,8,,1.0,3/24/2016,"Usually im not the one to write a bad review... But holy crap. This place is horrible and it takes a lot for me to say that. Uhm we can start by the fact that the food was brought to my table but no silverware... I gave the waitress about 5 min but nothing, i had to get up and ask for my entire table. But that was the least, i ordered a side of vegetables to fill me up and they never came... The only thing the waitress did was say how embarrassed she was at the fact that she forgot to put it in. Well at this point i was not even enjoying my food because of this. As far as the food goes, it was decent. The chicken and shrimp was alright, i had to drench it in sauce for it to go down. Like i said, im not one to write a bad review but something major needs to be done to this establishment but until then, i will not be returning.   Ps it took everything i had in me to leave a tip"
Ricardo D.,"Chicago, IL",0,13,,3.0,6/5/2016,"This breaks my heart, because the staff at this Applebee's always tries very hard to please.  At least that has been my experience.   Usually I stop in after work and get something to go, and since the big shake up of a few years back, when the staff changed almost overnight, the food has been on a downward slide.  The last time I ordered their ""Two for Twenty"" the food portions were tiny and the selections bland and just tossed in the to-go containers.  Then I popped in just to have a beer and notice a pile of logs in the entrance.  New menu, new choices, etc.!  Okay.  Fine.  Came back with a friend not long ago.  I ordered the 8oz Sirloin with roated veggies and a baked potato.  My friend ordered the salmon with grilled veggies and rice.  The bartender asked me if it was okay to bring my potato out after the entree was service, as I guess it was being baked.  We weren't in a hurry, so I said to just bring it all out when the spud was ready.  The entrees came out. My stead was okay.  Juicy but, honestly, not as good as their old, old choices of steak, like the Cajun steak.  The salmon had the texture of cardboard and no taste.  And... my potato was still pretty solid and uncooked.  I didn't feel like sending it back, so I just left half of it.  My friend ate some of her salmon and a bit of the rice, which she said tasted bland.  Here is the real problem.  It is Saturday night and the tappers are broken.  Yes!  There was not an ounce of tap beer to be had, and we like tap better than bottles, but since we were already there, we stayed and drank bottled, which was fresh.  The bar itself was empty, and the lack of drought beer may have been one of the reasons.  The place itself was fairly crowded.  Applebee's can't find it's niche.  It wanted to be the neighbood bar, and was offering specials on appetizers after nine, trying to attract a later night crowd, but everything about it screams ""family"".   It used to be that Applebee's had about the best food. I would choose it over a Friday's or a Chili's or even an Outback, especially on the road for work, where I just wanted somthing that wasn't going to kill me.  Now the food is questionable, and the many menus and inserts, like so many places, leave you confused as to what it is that your ordering, and price.  You have to look at the big pictures on the menu inserts and then hunt for it on the regular menu.  Many of these chain places seem to do this.  Anyway, I heard Applebee's is suffering from lack of biz, and if they don't straighten out their food and service (no tappers on a Saturday, C'mon!) they will end up closing the rest of their outlets in Illinois.  The entire chain seems to need ""Restaurant AND Bar"" Rescue.   And that's too bad."
M D.,"Oak Forest, IL",0,17,5,1.0,7/16/2017,"Bring your own utensils just in case. Applebee's used to be a reliable chain that had decent food, prompt service and ok prices. Well times have changed a bit. My soon to be wife and I went there and was first greeted by......... nobody. We were looking for a hostess and after a while one came, then left us standing there then came back and seated us. We were seated I guess at a clean table. They must have been using special soap that makes part of the table sticky. No flatware and the hostess said we ran out of silverware we need to ask the waitress. The waitress came we asked for silverware and our drinks came, then appetizer, then we asked again and were told they did not have any that were clean. They were being washed now. So eventually we did get some. I had the French onion soup, was a bit bland, and no depth of flavor. Still slightly better than gaston's in orland park but that is not saying a lot. We both had the American burger. It was a disappointment. The meat was bland, and just plain greasy. I was surprised at how bad they were. They couldn't get no onions correct on one of the burgers, I think it had extra onions on it. I don't know if the lack in quality is now the standard for the chain, or if it's just this restaurant's lackadaisical attitude toward quality."
Perla A.,"Orland Park, IL",21,5,,5.0,11/9/2016,I love this place the food the drinks the service everything is perfect here in this place I forgot the name of my Waiters but she is phenomenal I love this young lady
Claire M.,"Forest Park, IL",145,353,392,3.0,12/24/2014,"I met up here with a friend from Indiana for ""a drink"" as it seemed to be a place conveniently equidistant betwixt us.  I hadn't been to an Applebees in years but I had no better suggestions and wasn't at all familiar with the area, so this was what was decided on.  It was easily accessible off of I-294 for both of us. So I ordered a glass of Chardonnay and was informed that a glass cost $8 while the entire bottle cost $10.  Simple math told me that getting the bottle was obviously the way better deal BUT I didn't really want to have to drink an entire bottle of wine myself yet that is totally (and somewhat unsurprisingly) what happened. I should have asked if they would've re-corked the bottle for me so I could have taken the remains of the wine home rather than feel like I had to drink it all.  I'm thinking that they probably don't do that, but I could be wrong. I decided that I should probably eat something since I had to drive 35 miles back home. I quickly perused the menu and discovered a grilled cheese sandwich that came with tomato basil soup.  Awesome.  I ordered it, and it was decent.  It was one of those four cheese deals, the ""fancy"" kind.  I also sampled one little piece of my friend's pretzel sticks with beer cheese.  That was also rather sinfully tasty. Our waittress was sweet.  She said it was her first night out of training and that as of midnight, it would also be her birthday."
Mary B.,"Oak Lawn, IL",30,113,75,3.0,5/4/2016,"Just your average Apple Bees. Good options of reasonably priced food that tastes good. I came here with a friend to catch up and our waiter was a little too friendly, would stick around and ""chat"" with us, telling us about his day and how busy he was. We tried to be polite but we came to talk to each other, not our waiter."
Jack B.,"Whiting, IN",1,1,,1.0,3/1/2015,The good thing at this Applebee's  It has parking for a veteran  That's the only good thing Service just get worst and worst Food not even close to looking what they put in the Pictures Took for ever to get a drink And the server was like  He didn't want to be here at all Very unfriendly  All the Applebee's seam to gone down the drains  I really didn't want to come here But my mom - 90 in 3 weeks  Wanted to !! Not no more
Kris T.,"Worth, IL",0,5,,5.0,2/20/2016,"I'm suprised by all the negative reviews! I personally had 2 great experiences, I went with my child both times and the services was good and prompt and the food we got was good. I loved the Sirracha shrimp!"
Pedro S.,"Blue Island, IL",1,5,,5.0,5/4/2016,"Let's start off once we entered, the young man opened the door for me and my wife. He was very polite and on top of that the waitress was nice and kept checking up on what we needed. The food was also good and fresh! Hope I get the same service like this next time."
Lashanda L.,"Dolton, IL",4,2,,1.0,7/11/2016,I went to this Applebee's location on yesterday with my sisters and friends the food was OK the waiter we had could of been better. Also everybody paid there bill and we were leaving we saw all this police trucks/ white / cops but supposedly they called the Crestwood police on us because apparently we were loud but if so why!!!!! Did the Manager or any employee didn't come over to our table and say hey can you guys quiet down we thought they were there to look for someone but no that was not the case never never again are we to come back to this location I never thought it was because of the color of your skin and the fact that they were looking at our table for a good while it's sad sad..
Kristen J.,"Chicago, IL",10,17,31,1.0,8/29/2015,"So far, the free chips and slasa are not good. Watered down salsa and cold chips.   No water upon being seated. Chicken and pasta was dry. Riblets were all bone. I could go on but I won't. The only reason I came here is because TGI Fridays was too crowded, and I must say disappointment is etched all over my face."
Linda R.,"Oak Lawn, IL",1,13,2,1.0,11/15/2014,"If i could give this 0 star rating i would!  But of course it won't let me!  This place has gone down the drain!  Bartender is very obnoxious,  music they play is not suitable for this family oriented restaurant.  You can't really distinguish a worker from a customer because they apparently don't care about uniform or appearances for that matter. All the music is R&B with slurred language that kept being cut off due to the obscenity. Food has lost its taste,  everything about this place is completely terrible,  what use to be my favorite restaurant has been destroyed in my eyes.  Shame shame SHAME!"
Gwendolyn B.,"Midlothian, IL",42,30,,1.0,8/17/2015,"Sadly, this location has fallen under terrible management. Over the past year, we gave it three tries. One was late night after a theater performance and we were all starving. We ended up sitting at our table waiting for our server for 20 minutes. He kept coming by our table telling us how busy he was and would be right back. We were patient, but terribly thirsty. The worst part was that the manager walked by our table twice and never acknowledged us; the first time was forgivable, but the second time, you think she would have helped the server out. The next two visits were just as bad but on the last visit, the food was terrible (burnt bacon on Wedge Salad, crappy hamburger for my husband). At the time, I was in the busy season for school theater productions so I did not follow up with a survey with the company but it does not matter, we're not going back."
Liz M.,"Midlothian, IL",0,1,1,1.0,7/14/2015,"Had a pretty disgusting experience at this Applebee's today. I took my mom out and we both ordered the shared appetizer and two entrees. For the appetizer we ordered the Buffalo wings. They were salty, soggy and I decided to cut one of them in half and it was completely raw. I ate a few so i hope I do not get sick tomorrow because this is completely unacceptable! My entree the Mac and cheese and tenders looked so appetizing in the pictures but ended up looking and tasting like a sweet and sour soup. The breadstick was hard as a rock and the juice from the tenders filled up half the plate. The server took forever to come to our table so all I wanted to do was leave. We paid our bill and walked out. Left our food in plain view so they can see what they served us and that was it. I do not recommend this place at all. Maybe other things on the menu may be good but not those."
Aaron H.,"Crestwood, IL",85,2,,5.0,1/17/2016,"I go here regularly. Love the wings, beer is reasonably priced, and bar tender Anese is the best bar tender in IL."
Jasmine G.,"Orland Park, IL",20,9,7,1.0,8/15/2015,"Never come here on lunch! They had us first sitting here for about 5 min before anyone even came here to ask what we wanted to drink. I told them I had to be back at work in 45 min when I walked in the host said he would tell the server well they took forever to even ask for our order, even longer to give me my food. Then longer to give me my check. I give one star because the food was good."
C K.,"Chicago, IL",16,34,9,1.0,11/27/2014,"Wow I can't believe how this place took a nose dive, this cannot be a corporate owned  Resturant I have Never seen Applebee's employees and management sitting at the bar drinking and actually noisier  then the customers, I have 4 kids all under 12 they we loader then my kids   The food was tasted like it was heated up in a microwave, the pop was flat and when you ask for No onions on the hamburgers that means No onions took 40 min to get our order just for burgers fries  We will never come here again they went from 5 star to 0 in just a few years"
Kenneth T.,"Chicago, IL",13,8,1,1.0,5/10/2015,"Just left a ""Mother's Day"" dinner for my wife. I got to sit next to my wife while she ate her dinner. Not one to complain but I ordered the same thing as my wife, just different sides. It took almost 30 min after my wife was done to get my to go box. Management was very helpful, but still doesn't make up for the ruined experience. I'm also sorry that the young lady got in trouble, but maybe next time she will be on top of her game if it was her fault."
Peanut-Gallery K.,"Alsip, IL",0,9,,1.0,2/12/2014,"Run far, far, far away from this place. Worst customer service in the industry. My girlfriend and I stopped by this Applebee's location for a few drinks and appetizers before heading to the movies theatres. I should try tried to. When walked in we were greeted and sat very quickly. There were a total of 7 tables seated in the place and no one at the bar. After sitting at are table for 15 mins we were finally greeted by are rude server. ""What you want to drink?"" With attitude.  No hi my name is, sorry for the wait, welcome to Applebee's. So we ordered 2 brewtus of bud lights.  We sat for another aggravating 10 mins and the server came back asking are you ready to order with out bringing my delicious beer. I asked her if we could get are beers. She said sorry about that the bartender is busy. Horrible excuse since the bar was 20 feet from me and there was one person sitting at the bar. I looked over to the bar and are beers were sitting there as the bartender was cleaning his area. She left the table to go grab are beers and on her way back decided to have a few minutes conversation with another server.  When she finally made it to the table we decided we were done with it. Told her we don't want your beer after sitting for 35 minutes. She walked away. After we put are jackets on a manager came over and said a beer would be comped if we still wanted to stay. I told him to learn to have better service. We walked out no beer no food."
Alisha B.,"Palos Hills, IL",10,62,,2.0,12/11/2015,"Yeah no thank you. For $20, my 5yr old got the wrong order, I got a nasty nasty fajita wrap and salad combo....aaaaaand a way, waaaaay over priced coffee ($2.50 for a thick, syrupy sludge???).  No thanks. The kid ordered grilled chicken tenders and got fried chicken nugget instead. She didn't complain - - so ok, whatever. I got a wrap and a house salad. The salad was 10% browned lettuce greens, and 90% toppings of diced tomato, cucumber, cheese, and some token bacon. The toppings would be great if there was actually some SALAD to go with them.  The wrap was a SouthWestern Fajita type deal. Basically it was ""Red Onions Smothered in Cheddar"". Nasty. Truly. I boxed it up and took it home to the hubby to eat. Bleh.  We happened to have a lot of errands in the neighboring strip mall and thought we'd get a nice lunch while we were there. Instead I ate a few bites of salad, my 5yr old at a few fried nuggets, and I payed waaay more than I would have for a comparable meal at the local fast food place - that would have tasted just as good :(  We got home, I made myself a PBJ (Because I couldn't eat the onion-wrap) and the kiddo asked for some fried eggs (because the three nuggets weren't very filling).  Yup. What was it I paid for again???? Cause I could have just waited the half hour and had the same outcome..plus kept that extra twenty!"
Touya L.,"Markham, IL",0,2,,1.0,1/22/2015,"This place is horrible, I went on a date and we decided to go to Applebee's to eat after going to the movies. It was approximately around eight thirty when we got there. We sat down and started a conversation and the next thing I know one of the waitresses started vacuuming the floor. I thought that was very rude, and then she started sweeping and dust was flying everywhere. I will never go there again, ever."
Dark S.,"Blue Island, IL",0,19,,2.0,11/17/2013,"I go hear often with mom, we have a little fun and a good meal..... BUT sadly weds 11-13-14 I had the worse experience of my life....no fun and not a good meal. it was not busy even tho we went at lunch time..... we were seated quickly, took nearly 5 minutes for server to reach table...she was quick to ask what we wanted to drink and rushed away....serveral minutes later we got the coffee and glass of water ordered...as she was about to rush away again, I stoped her said we were ready to order....shes like oh...ok. she did not write anything down....but ok, order was pretty easy..... spinach artichoke dip, 2 broccoli soups, 1 cheese burger with grilled onions and mayo on the side, 1 cowboy burger with the onion strings, bacon, cheddar and bbq sauce.... took a while to get soups and then were cold, dip was cold and watery, sent soups back, they came back to us lukewarm....dip we just ate even tho it was chilled an thin.... the server was slow, didn't come back for a while, mom barely got a 2nd cup of coffee and I think a different server was kind enough to do this for her, ( oh yea it was a different server who took the cold soups back for us to the kitchen ) when burgers arrived at table, we got a cheese burger and a quasadia burger ( WroNG) far cry from the cowboy burger orderd it appeard to be a paper thin patty on chopped tomatoe an whatever on a grilled toritilla shell....not happy...got the manager...blah blah blah..finaly got the right burger...oh and the grilled onions on cheese burger not that grilled and did you know it cost $1.29 for them? never knew to be charged for grilled onions before but ...whatever now...... ended just boxing burger because I was aggravated.....rest of food....to justgo ohh yes I almost forgot when I placed order I also placed order to go...with all this chaos on a NON busy day I said screw it and cancel it..... bill arrived, I was still charged for what I cancelled, and the $1.29 for non grilled/grilled onions.....and cold food.... finally getting the cancelled order off check, I was offered an apology and one of those itty mini desert shooters to go...woohoo..how kewl is that? paid my money and got the hell out of there.
