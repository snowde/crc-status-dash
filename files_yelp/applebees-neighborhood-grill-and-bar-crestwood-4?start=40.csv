Jennifer H.,"Park Ridge, IL",103,31,2,1.0,7/15/2012,"I tried to order the Curbside to Go Service the other night for dinner.  It was a simple request: a salad with chicken in it and a chicken wings appetizer. I was put on hold and jockeyed between employees 3 times before anyone even took my order.  Then, I finally placed the order and said that I'd like to delay it a bit so that I could finish my work--pick it up in 30 minutes instead of 15.  I was told that the entry system was unreliable when it came to delaying orders like that.  Chances are that someone would still make the food and it would just sit there. WTF? Even if this is the truth, how is it good business to TELL people that?  So I asked, ""Just to clarify, you are telling me that I need to call back to accommodate your system?""  The reply? ""If you want your food to be hot, yes."" I will never eat there again, and that's a shame because I hate to cook and find myself eating out quite frequently."
Jennie R.,"Oak Lawn, IL",56,21,5,1.0,1/6/2014,"I've been here only a couple of times but last night was really bad. As everyone knows there was a nice snow storm so we thought we would grab something to eat while we were already out. We were seated right away. Our server was over to us in just a couple seconds to see what we wanted to drink. My boyfriend asked if they had dr. Pepper and she said no but we have cherry Pepsi. That is no where close to being dr pepper! It took at least 10 minutes for us to get our drinks. So we were looking through the menu and there weren't that many choices for the 2 for 20 or 2 for 24 which is what we went there for. So we settled on spinach and artichoke dip with 2 entrees of their Mac and cheese.  It took another 10 minutes or so to bring out the appetizer. The chips were super oily but other than that nothing to complain about.  So I was really looking forward to this Mac and cheese and boy was I disappointed. The chicken tenders that came on top were okay, but the noodles tasted nothing like Mac and cheese. They had a barbecue/honey mustard taste and I didn't eat one bite of it. I'm a huge bread fan too so I thought I would at least enjoy the bread stick, but nope. It was dry and the seasoning that they put on top was just terrible. And with all of this happening, our waitress never stopped by us to see how everything was. They were all too busy trying to close early rather than take care of the customers they had in there. I wish we took the opportunity to just get up and leave when they were all hiding in the back. Definitely not worth $30. My other experiences were okay but this one really made me not want to come back ever.  I probably won't go back to any Applebee's. They're supposed to be known for awesome service, a fun atmosphere, and great food, but I never received any of that."
Easter L.,"Chicago, IL",50,12,1,1.0,9/25/2014,Myself and my boyfriend always eat there after the show and the last few times it has been horrible. I order the trio and always the sliders are hard and the chicken taste like they soaked them in water ( they had no taste) then they put them in the microwave. I wouldn't recommend anyone there. I guess IHOP it will be from now on
Walter M.,"Alsip, IL",7,16,2,1.0,7/10/2014,A horse dump would be better than this suck hole. Waited 30 min for a server who never came back after we ordered our food. It was the end of her shift so she left and no one picked up out table. After 30 min of waiting I just pushed my water onto the floor which finally attracted the attention of the manger. One the manager heard our story we were offered a free appetizer. In reply I pushed my wife's water onto the floor soaking the managers feet. Needless to say we left after that.
Kevin V.,"Arlington Heights, IL",0,6,2,5.0,8/31/2015,"I had one of their new burgers. Man, one of the best I've had. Bun was a brioche type, meat was cooked perfect and tasted great. It had crispy hashbrowns on it with a fried egg. I loved the fact when the yolk cracked I had egg flowing out. The burger wasn't greasy at all. The fries tasted great and were hot. Service was very fast and friendly. I highly recommend. On a separate trip, I had a couple late night apps. The pot stickers tasted good, though a bit small. I'd prefer a few less and bigger. The boneless wings on the other hand, best I've had. Juicy white meat, hot and not greasy. Good size too. Better than Hooters and BWW's. I'll be back."
William H.,"Burbank, IL",3,24,6,3.0,12/9/2011,I've been going here for years and the service is either a hit or miss. There is typically a wait but this is often because some fat single mother comes in with her seven loud kids. Can restaurants add in a kids only section like how we used to have smoking and non smoking sections?  I rarely had a bad waiter and a manager does come around to check on you and they have been known to comp you of the drinks have been watered down or the bar tender made the drink wrong.  I've had my best service sitting at the bar. No kids around you or anything and fast service obviously. Menu is decent but the portions seems to be getting smaller.
Eileen P.,"Flossmoor, IL",27,90,25,5.0,2/22/2014,I have been to this location many times. I have always had good service from my server and the food is good and reasonably priced. I can't say that I have ever had a bad experience at this Applebee's. I also love that on Veterans Day they give free meals to Veterans. I go every year and have a steak.
Judith M.,"Park Forest, IL",3,171,,2.0,7/24/2011,"I recently had a late dinner at the Applebee's in Crestwood, IL with five friends.  It was in the middle of a heat wave; unfortunately part of their seating was unavailable as the air conditioning did not work.  Thus, we had to wait for a table for our group which we were told would take 10-15 minutes, but it was more like five minutes.  The air conditioning where our table was located was okay.  I think that the Applebee's corporation needs to renovate this restaurant in the future.   The service by the waitress was fine, no complaints, and she came by often to make sure we had what we needed.   I've never been a fan of Applebee's at I any location as I think the food and beverages are a bit overpriced.  However, my food was fine, no complaints."
Concerned C.,"Oak Forest, IL",0,4,,1.0,2/10/2015,"Ordered a chicken breast which was served burnt. It was redone and still black.Per waiter, the manager refused to substitute another menu item. Last time I patronize this establishment!"
Don I.,"Midlothian, IL",0,58,,1.0,1/26/2015,"My wife and I dined here on Saturday 1/24/15 shortly after 4 p.m. My hamburger was under cooked. The server named Nick was very new. And he probably did not receive enough training. But being a waiter at a restaurant does not take that much training, but you have to want to do it. He obviously didn't. He got our order wrong, with the endless fries. When we asked for more fries, then he remembered what we ordered in the first place. For some reason, the lights above our table and two others were not lit. When I asked why they all of a sudden came on. This place is nothing like the TV commercial! The only reason why we ate here is because we received a gift card for Christmas. Don't even bother coming to this restaurant! Go to Hog Wild in Midlothian instead! And the one star above is for the TV sets."
Pam M.,"Worth, IL",24,4,,1.0,4/29/2015,"What happened Applebees????? We used to like you!  Not anymore! Since November 2014 we have visited 3 times and each time it got worse.  Steaks were tasteless and dry. The last straw was Easter Sunday. We decided to take our daughter-in-law and 3 grandkids out since our son was working. Applebees advertised free kids meals for Easter. The kids meals (pizza, chicken strips and a burger) were ok I guess because the kids finished their food. Either that or they were very hungry!  Dtr-in-law got a pasta and shrimp salad which was tasteless so she doctored it up with salt and pepper. My hubby and I ordered the ribs. Big mistake. They were so tough and dry that you couldn't get the meat off the bone. And very watery garlic mashed potatoes. The only thing we semi-enjoyed were the mozzarella sticks ordered as an appetizer (obviously pre-made frozen).  Needless to say, we walked out of there very hungry. Oh, and when the check was brought to us we were charged for the kids meals!  We had to dispute this with the manager. Finally corrected check came to $63.27.  A lot of money for such unappetizing food. Happy Easter Applebees!  Oh, and email to corporate has yet to be answered."
Glynis W.,"Chicago, IL",15,21,,3.0,3/9/2013,"Applebee's is good for making a quick stop to grab a bite to eat!  I've been a patron for years!  The service and the food is a bit sketchy and hit or miss but, most of the time you're there with friends and family and the conversation and time spent with them at the restaurant outweighs everything else!"
Melissa B.,"Blue Island, IL",56,2,,1.0,7/11/2014,"Definitely unhappy with management, they like to lock the doors on the restaurant more than an hour before they're Are supposed to close! We got there at 11:45pm and they are supposed to be open until 1am! The person at the door played dumb and wild not unlock the door, what kind of service is that!? And finally when the manager came to the door he said ""oh , I guess you can come in"" seriously?! Why advertise ""open late"" then! I wonder if the company knows they are turning down BUSINESS!!"
Dominique J.,"La Grange, IL",29,6,3,1.0,3/16/2014,"Absolutely TERRIBLE I will never go back to this location. I'm usually not in this area but was out with a friend so we decided to stop in for a bite to eat. We honestly would have been better off going to Sonic's across the way. We were seated promptly but that's the only highlight. Once seated it took almost 15 minutes for us to get water. I had to ask the hostess for the waitress. The waitress finally showed up and and nonchalantly apologized for the wait. We ordered our (water) drinks and waited another 10 minutes before getting them. After that we placed our order, which included an appetizer, it took awhile for the appetizer to make it to our table. Needless to say our entrées came out very late and the waitress blamed that on the new cooks in the back.  I wanted to speak with the manager however that didn't go any better than the terribly slow service and so-so food. The manager had a very nonchalant attitude and didn't offer any apologies or compensation for her staffs mediocre performance. Yep, defiantly won't be back to this Applebee's location, what a waste of money, time and effort."
David N.,"Willowbrook, IL",167,532,1860,4.0,1/14/2012,"Not a big fan of rating food chains, but our recent visit prompted a good post of the lovely Yelp! I've stopped here plenty of times in the past, and we've always had decent food and not much to complain about. My recent visit was one of the best I've had here. No wait whatsoever for a table. Our service was excellent. Chips & Salsa app was a nice break from your typical greasy, oily, freshly fried tortilla chips at the local taqueria. The chips were hot, crisp, with close to no trace of oil, and plenty of salt. The salsa was good too. Tried the Sizzling Asian Shrimp with Vegetables and was definitely pleased. Tons of sizzzle, flavor, the right of amount of everything. Definitely a must for anyone trying to fit back into their skinny jeans after the holidays. My wife's  steak with bruschetta was pretty good, and her $1.00 Brownie Bite was the perfect size after a filling meal. Didn't believe it when I saw the price, but for $1, you get a good size piece of brownie, chocolate sauce, and a nice scoop of ice cream. Definitely worth checking out. Thanks for dinner tonight Applebee's!"
Ryan M.,"Gardner, IL",46,110,24,4.0,5/2/2011,Chicken tasted bad told the bartender and ordered something else. Great service from the bartender the waitress that took the drink order was a little bitchy!
Don M.,"Mokena, IL",382,460,23,2.0,4/20/2011,"OK, its a chain and there's a link missing. Went for lunch and its was fairly crowded. No one at the door to great us and as we waited she finally came up and asked how many follow me. As we followed she was looking all over and finally put us in a booth. Next as we sit and wait for 10 minutes our waitress finally makes an appearance. Are you ready to order, um yes. What would you like, then poof shes gone. Food is brought after a wait but not by our waitress. Finally she did reappear and ask if we were ok and get refills on drinks. We ask for the check and off she goes. We set the credit card on table and she comes with check and sets it by the card. We say wait take it, to slow, poof she gone again. Finally shes back takes check. So the food was ok, I had a Chicken Cesar salad. Service was pitiful."
Deb R.,"Oak Lawn, IL",0,9,,1.0,12/28/2014,"If I could give less than one star, I would. Went in on Sunday morning, shortly after they opened for the day. It wasn't very crowded. My friend and I each ordered a specialty burger. It took them Twenty five minutes to bring our food. When they did, it wasn't right. We both asked for  ""Medium Well"", a little pink inside. They were both well done. Hers came with some kind of BBQ Ranch sauce, which she asked for on the side because she didn't know if she'd like it. They put it on the burger. The menu said ""Lettuce, Tomato and pickles available upon request."" I specifically said no lettuce, but definitely pickles. I got lettuce, but no pickles. I ordered  a mushroom/swiss burger. I expected to get mushrooms on top of the meat. They claim they mix them in with the meat. No they don't. At least I didn't find them. the burgers had absolutely no taste. I might as well have ordered wall paper paste. It would have tasted the same, and cost less. This was my first time at Applebees. I went because I got a gift card for Christmas. It will be my last time. I'd have been better off trading in the gift card for Store  credit at Walmart. At least then I'd have gotten something of value."
Mimi S.,"Atlanta, GA",75,205,28,1.0,12/19/2010,"I must say that I absolutely HATE this chain, but we were REALLY hungry and hide time to kill...We were greeting at the door by a nice enough girl and seated immediately to a dirty booth.  Since there was a dish towel near by, I asked for it and cleaned out our seats properly. Our waitress walked by us at least 4 times, NO EXAGGERATION! She checked on the people seated both in the booth in front of us.  Apparently brown skin is invisible because we were NEVER acknowledged! Needless to say, we got the hell out of there fast, but not without informing the manager who kindly offered us free dessert...Are you freaking SERIOUS??? No thank you!"
Lauren O.,"Chicago, IL",32,19,25,1.0,12/30/2008,"Our Applebee's experience here was pretty bad. If you're going to settle for a generic chain restaurant with generic chain food, you'd at least expect great service with a comfortable atmosphere. Not the case here. We went on a freezing cold day in December between Christmas shopping and did not take our coats off the entire time. Everyone in the restaurant had their coats on, including the staff. We even mentioned it was cold and not until halfway through our meal did they turn the heat up. As for the service, they not only served the wrong sauces/dressings that were requested, but it took them forever to come and check on us so we could ask for something else. We were probably there a good 15 minutes longer then we needed to be because of it. Everyone seemed nice there, but it was obvious they were not attentive to their customers."
