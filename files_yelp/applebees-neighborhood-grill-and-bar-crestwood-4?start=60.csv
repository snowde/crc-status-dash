Jordan I.,"Chicago, IL",5,53,,3.0,10/23/2009,"Came here a couple of days ago with my friend and sat at the bar for service. There was noone at the door to greet or seat us. Which was fine because we planned on sitting at the bar anyways. But if we weren't I'm sure this would be pretty aggrivating. After we sat at the bar, the bartender was pretty timely in his greeting and drink order. After we got our drinks I witnessed that there were about 7-10 tables sat and only one waitress. I found that a little disconcerting as well. I worked at a chain ""waiting"" style restaurant before and remember the largest section that we would have would be about 4 tables, so I don't know what the problem was here. Maybe they were short staffed because I saw the manager running food out. But after about 20 minutes I saw another waiter come out of the woodwork. But he had no tables except for the one that was sat 3 minutes before I saw him. So basically what I'm saying is sit at the bar, I think you will have better service. Now for my meal it was average, which is what ""shenanigans"" type restaurants strive for. Other than that the bartender that was serving us was pretty cool. I was telling him that me and my friend were on our way to see Paranormal Activity, and he proceeded to get into a conversation of the movie without ruining it. Which was cool because I was getting second thoughts on seeing the movie and he convinced me to, to which I was not diappointed. Anyways, he put a rush on our orders to make sure that we got to the movie theatre in time. We proceeded to talk about how awesomely hot his manager was and had a nice conversation about that. Which I almost considered applying for a job just because she (the manager) was so hot. Blonde, nice body, nice ummmm.... I digress. So if you come here expect probably semi-sub-par service if you sit at the tables. Sit at the bar have a drink, talk with the bartender, and check out the manager/ waitresses. It's mass produced generic food which is expected. I honestly thought I was at chili's until we left and I saw the sign."
