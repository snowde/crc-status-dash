LaPeshaa C.,"Austin, TX",113,284,458,5.0,12/11/2017,"The food was fresh and good. Everything came as it looked and was described on the menu. I really enjoyed my chicken tenders over creamy mac! I can't remember the name of the actual dish. The waitress was prompt and friendly. She stayed checking on us and our drinks stayed full.  I mean it's Applebee's. Eat, enjoy dollar beers, and be happy!"
Kimberly M.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,1.0,1/9/2018,"Ok, let me first start off by saying that I have NEVER written a bad review.. but with my last three experiences here being bad (with the first 2 only being mediocre) I feel the need to write a review to warn people. The first couple of times the food was great....that was a few years ago...but over the last 3 years the service and food at this location have been the WORST I HAVE EXPERIENCED AT ANY  RESTAURANT EVER!  My first bad experience started with dirty plates and super slow service...We had to find our own silverware, ketchup, etc., 2nd bad experience..again..dirty plates, dirty table, menu was gross and had food all over it from previous customers...ordered food and it came out super slow...when we cut into the boneless chicken wings they were completely raw...sent them back...they brought them out AFTER our entrees,  so we ended up taking them home! The entrees weren't even very good, my  grilled chicken breast tasted odd so I ended up only eating the side items. 3rd experience..I had gotten a gift card so I decided to try and give them ONE LAST CHANCE (since I was sick and didn't feel like driving or cooking)....we all ordered steak dinners. Went to pick them up at the curbside to go...Went inside..no one was around...finally heard a girl at the bar say ""I can help u over here."" I walked over and she immediately walked off and started talking to a man at the bar,  like I wasn't even there...I waited a few min, saw my order sitting beside me (without a ticket), searched through the bag, grabbed it and started to walk off.. I  said ""ok, thanks!"" ..heard her yell at me..""Umm, well, ok whatever!"".  I get our food home and it SUCKS!!! Our steaks are so tough we have to saw them with a knife (I can't say much since it is applebees and not a steak restaurant..but seriously this is REALLY BAD!) I will say that they cooked it accurately ...so there is that. However, the steak tasted like it had been fried  instead of grilled and it was beyond tough with a lot of gristle. The ""fresh"" garlic green beans were soggy like they were overcooked, fries were great, and the garlic mashed potatoes were great!  The spinach artichoke dip, that we had for an appetizer,...the dip was great , the chips were stale with over half of the largest chips being the size of a quarter!! Horrible service, horrible food quality....Don't waste your money or time going to this location."
Jasmine E.,"Plano, TX",163,124,113,2.0,12/13/2017,Just came here for $1 and of course i wanted to try something different as i feel like the drinks were watered down. I'm assuming because they were $1 they didn't have as much liquor. So i ordered a strawberry and lime margarita & the frozen machine was down which i was really upset about because i only drink frozen margaritas. I tried one on the rocks and it tasted like juice so she made me another one but it tasted the same... maybe they ran out of liquor for the night lol (didn't ordered any food)
Bridget T.,"Carrollton, TX",45,103,64,3.0,8/12/2017,"I've never been a big fan of Applebee's but every now and then I have to take one for the team. This location has an good bartender named Shelby and she makes the best Bahama Mamma ever. I could go on and on about the drinks and the bar but I won't! This location has pretty good service but I've never really liked their food. I played along and ordered the 6 oz. sirloin with a loaded baked potato and steamed broccoli. I was very impressed with this new cut of steak it was cooked perfectly medium as I requested it, the broccoli was steamed just how I like it and the potato was just a potato. The only complaint I have is that when cleaning a booth make sure to sweep the cracks of the actual seat. Overall I could eat this meal again if I had to. Way to go Applebee's keep up the good work."
Bj E.,"Plano, TX",261,16,30,2.0,12/11/2017,"From the start we revived bad service our waiter was super un attentive took like 30 min to bring out our appetizers, had to take his ticket back twice once for ringing up too many drinks the other for not respecting happy hour . The music was good the atmosphere great food mediocre service terrible"
Cedric J.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,5.0,1/2/2018,"Okay. We came here for cheap appetizers and $1 beers. We got everything we ordered and the waitress put up with our shit. If I didn't give 5 stars for that, then I should question my humanity. And also sweetheart, if you only drink frozen margaritas that cost $1, then a Yelp review is not necessary. Cheers."
Raquel W.,"Clinton, MS",2,2,,5.0,11/19/2017,Marcus is the best server ever!!! Come check out Applebee's!!! Food was decent. Cook made the steak perfect
Za S.,"Frisco, TX",8,53,8,1.0,8/26/2017,Went here because it was the only place open that I was able to sit down at. Ordered the cheese sticks. Those were okay. Never really had a bad cheese stick anywhere tho. I ordered the grilled chicken ceased salad and the other ordered the steak with green beans and mashed potatoes. I couldn't even stomach to eat the salad. It was just a hell no. Over saturated and the chicken just didn't taste grilled or real. The steak was okay nothing spectacular and the sides were Idk reheated and served it seems. I haven't been to Applebee's in years and you would think it would be better by now. Maybe it was the location and cooks. The servers were friendly at least and helpful. But 40+ for food that I didn't really eat was extremely too much out of my pocket.
mary w.,"Dallas, TX",16,48,10,1.0,8/28/2017,"Server Lisa is rude. I'm sure she is a lovely person, nevertheless, If you are a guy,  or older female she will converse with you. She openly complains about personal problems. Applebees needs to send her to a customer service training course."
Leah D.,"Carrollton, TX",0,25,47,5.0,12/7/2016,"I give this rating a 5 and the reason why is because our waiter Geo was awesome, he was very attentive and had such a great attitude and made me and hubby's night very enjoyable.  The food we ordered was on the 2 for $20 deal. I got the Fiesta lemon chicken that comes with tortilla strips and rice. Very tasty dish and would recommend. Hubby got a 3 cheese pasta which was a good size bowl and was very yummy and we also got the spinach artichoke dip that came with some chips and a small cup of salsa. For dessert we got the triple chocolate molten cake with vanilla ice cream & whipped cream...yummm!!!All really enjoyable The drinks were okay not strong at all. I ordered the strawberry margarita and we also got a fireball whiskey which tasted good but again not strong. I would give it a 3 out of 10.  Overall experience - good, just wouldn't order drinks here if you are looking for a buzz. Other than that had a great time and would for sure visit again!!i"
Lucy M.,"Dallas, TX",55,4,,5.0,5/14/2017,"This one is for our bartender Brent! Absolutely LOVE this guy. My husbando and I come up here every weekend after work to relax and drink and we have officially deemed Brent our main man! He's hilarious, personable, charismatic, and recognizes people who value him. If he ever leaves here, we'll be tagging along :D  Thanks for being amazing Brent!"
Lexiis P.,"Cityplace, Dallas, TX",139,1,,1.0,11/26/2017,This place fuckin sucks! Every time I come I have terrible service. The food is hit or miss with place. Dead asf and the service was still ridiculously slow. Place is a joke
Aaron I.,"Dyess Air Force Base, TX",4,14,39,3.0,5/4/2017,"Not great, not bad your run-of-the-mill Applebee's. Happy hour was ok drinks were very affordable but a little bit on the weak side, two Long Island's no buzz. Great customer service excellent happy hour food prices if you get there before 4 o'clock. Overall OK experience might come back."
Jacqueline M.,"Plano, TX",8,48,3,1.0,2/11/2017,"This is a review of my most recent visit and will contain information about previous equally terrible visits.  We have 3 little ones. That being said there is a lot of take out. The places we do dine in at are very family friendly. Ie. Joe's Crab Shack in Lewisville with the playground, Sneaky Petes outdoor seating with the pool.   This was our 3rd time to get Applebee's takeout. Our order isn't correct. 1 meal was completely left out. I know mistakes happen. As usually, when I called to ask about it I was given an apathetic response.  No sincerity at all. Basically come back or we will give you something g next time. That's fair. But at least sound like you want to male it right. I've never spoken with anyone there that sounds happy to be there. No smiles through the phone. In December we decided to stop in for a cocktail before we met for a concert. It was 6 PM on a Thursday. The bar had maybe 8 people. No bartenders in sight. One of the ladies had a little dog IN HER LAP AT THE BAR. 15 minutes later a bartender walks in, takes our orders. Then the others orders...and serves us LAST. We immediately get the check, pay and their terminals are down. No credit cards. So we pay cash leave a tip and tell our group how shocking he visit was. October we got take put and they sent no condiments or silverware for a meal we provided for a school choir. But they did give us plenty across the street from the school at a different restaurant. So I feel comfortable with the 1. While the food and drinks can be 3+, the poor attitude and lack of pride in the establishment is seething through its employees."
Brian S.,"Dallas, TX",1,35,,1.0,8/29/2017,"Employees spraying water on one another Employees throwing another employees keys across the room Excessively loud rap music Employee talking bad about the kitchen staff, saying they ""suck on Tuesday"" loud enough for the whole bar to hear. Worst of all, the manager was not only right there the whole time but was in the middle of it all completely un-phased The place is an absolute zoo. I sat down and less than half way done  with my beer I was so fed up with the place. I wish i could give 0 stars. Please stay away!!!"
Anthony O.,"Carrollton, TX",91,7,,2.0,8/17/2017,Walked in sat at in the bar section. Go our menus from the host and never met our waiter. Walked out after waiting 20 minutes.
Hassan C.,"Kingsville, TX",29,58,98,4.0,2/16/2017,Good food good service great beer selection .. love to go here after a movie .. love that they started doing more healthier options ..   Music and the atmosphere is very hip and laid back will return like always.  Still waiting to win my game tickets!!!
Trish M.,"Far North Dallas, Dallas, TX",1,1,,1.0,7/27/2017,"Extremely poor service with an attitude.  I am handicapped and walking is very difficult for me so only order at restaurants with a pickup window or car service.  I ordered car side from the Frankford .  Called when arrived to let them know I was there.  After 20 minutes called again and was told ""they did not have the personnel"" to do carside and I would have to come inside. I explained that was not possible...employee coped an attitude.  After another 10 minutes my food was brought to me.  Of course it was cold and WRONG!  Should not advertise carside to go if the service is not provided"
Dan H.,"Carrollton, TX",0,38,,1.0,7/21/2017,"First, the music was terrible.  Rap is all that they play and gangster rap at that. Second, the food is mediocre.  Third the wait staff is pitiful.  Fourth, the drinks are watered down.  Lastly, the management is not very responsive.   If you want a quiet, reasonably priced  good food kind of place try somewhere else.  I live close by and I will never eat here again."
Jonathan F.,"Carrollton, TX",0,8,,1.0,10/23/2016,It's 8pm and all the lights are off outside. Was seated at a dirty table. Menu was dirty... more food on menu than pictures inside menu. Waiter was really slow. 15 mins wait from time we got drinks to ordering food... less than 20 people eating. After getting food... there was 2 hairs on my plate.
Katherine C.,"Escondido, CA",0,7,5,1.0,9/15/2017,"We recently moved into the area within the last year and were excited to be near an Applebee's since we enjoy the 2 for $20 deal. Oh how times have changed! This is hands down the worst Applebee's we've ever ate at, and we've lived in multiple places across the country. After giving it multiple tries to see if it will get any better, we no longer will be going back. Each time has been a weird/frustrating eating experience, and we are the LAST people to ever complain when going out to eat. Every time there is super loud music blasting from the bar, which was annoying but not the worst. The tables have never been clean upon sitting down, last time we went the booth had a ton of rips where we sat. Crayon all over the wall, salt all over the table, just yuck. Our waitress tried taking our order without writing it down, and totally brought out a separate dish from what I ordered. My boyfriend ate his dinner, while I just asked for mine to go so we can leave as soon as he's done. Meanwhile the whole staff is gathered around the hostess table yelling and joking around. Once again, we never complain at restaurants or send food back, but this was so bad and disappointing to say the least! Save your money, go somewhere else."
Brandon S.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,3.0,10/13/2017,"This location is okay. Cheap drinks- came for their Dollaritas and had some half off appetizers after 9pm M-Th. The Bourbon Street chicken wasnt amazing, and like the pasta, the flavors didnt absorb deep into the food- but then again this is just Applebees. The Frisco location was less crowded and the food was cooked better based on my one time experience. May come back again next time Dollaritas are back."
Hakan A.,"Irving, TX",1,44,4,2.0,9/1/2017,"Portions are very stingy and the service was lackluster.  It is definitely NOT a kid friendly place, the high chairs were nasty dirty.  One of them didn't have a safety belt so I had to take one of my kids out and try to hold her. I think I am going skip coming this location even though we are close to it.  I don't recommend..."
Taylor R.,"Keller, TX",19,15,17,2.0,12/30/2015,"The customer service was Awesome!!!!!!!! Alaina was my server OMG she was so sweet and attentive.  However, I ordered chips and salsa and the salsa was small with a bag of chips!!!! Additional salsa was to come with an ADDITIONAL price!!!! I can't do places or things that's all about the $$$ dollar.  I need a great customer experience from my server to my pocket book!"
Jasmine T.,"Dallas, TX",97,151,56,2.0,2/26/2017,"This location is ok. The drinks are super weak which is disappointing. I had an 8oz steak with double garlic mash both times I visited. Unfortunately, my steak was super dry but the mash was awesome. I'll try again for the drinks, hopefully better, and the music they play during late nights."
Amanda P.,"Mesquite, TX",8,18,17,3.0,9/17/2016,"The boneless wings are not that great. They were really hard which made it not that easy to chew on. They do have a happy hour on drinks and food past a certain time which includes a $1 margaritas special, but other than that the food is not that great. This may be a good place for drinks but if you're wanting some good food I'd go else where."
Rich H.,"Carrollton, TX",69,10,,5.0,3/10/2017,"I was waited on by a really nice girl named Jess and come back here again because of the way she treated me.   She was kind, attentive, and funny."
Kenny W.,"Irving, TX",0,7,1,1.0,11/5/2016,"Went in on a Saturday night at 12 midnight. We sat in the bar area looking for a drink and some appetizers. We were ignored and not even waited on for close to 30 mins. The single waitress kept visiting her ""special"" tables and ignored us. I got ver bad service last time we were here but didn't review. I will NEVER return."
Justin A.,"Dallas, TX",2,3,,1.0,2/27/2017,I won't ever eat at this place again. Management needs better training and staff need professional help in customer sevice. Don't waste your money at this place
James R.,"Carrollton, TX",19,34,28,3.0,1/2/2017,Waiters good but seems confused. Steaks a little tough but good garlic mashed potatoes are good salad with mustard dressing is delicious
K D.,"Dallas, TX",6,11,38,1.0,3/18/2016,The manager was eating the alcohol condiments on the bar right in front of everyone !! he didn't even wash his hands No refill on drinks the whole two hours I was here Very slow service. Horrible waiters !!  The waiter even took our debit card and HE HAD OUR CARD IN HIS BACK POCKET!!!!!!!!! These place needs help because it sucks!!
Kevin K.,"Dallas, TX",8,9,1,1.0,3/31/2016,"DO NOT STEP FOOT IN THIS RESTAURANT!! This location/franchise is the worst! I usually don't invest my time in posting reviews but the General Manager here, Carlos Morales, is a liar and allows his waiters to fraudulently charge credit cards. In December a waiter kept my card and ran almost $100 in charges the next day - I spoke with Carlos who confirmed the fact and the waiter that did it. Apologies, comped our next meal...promised to fire the employee...etc Fast forward- I went in again last night and guess who we see...he doesn't recognize us and when I ask him when he came back to work here, it was clear that he was never even spoken to about the fraudulent charges and was never fired. I am in disbelief that the GM knew my CC had been charged and really didn't care. I'm sure he knew the bank would cover the loss and I would eventually get things straightened out with a new card. DO NOT STEP FOOT IN THIS RESTAURANT!!"
Jen P.,"Lewisville, TX",30,3,,1.0,6/8/2017,"I wish I could give ZERO stars.  We walked in to this Applebees for lunch today.   We stood there for a couple of minutes while several employees looked at us from the back.  Their conversations must have been more important than customer service.  We ended up nearly seating ourselves when a server walked up and said ""are you going to play hostess for me while mine is back their talking"".  Well ya, I guess so.  The bartender had also screamed ""FRONT DOOR"" during our wait to be seated.  As we were escorted to a booth, there were 4 employees leaning on counters and walls as if they were in no hurry to actually work.  A waitress took our drink order but then chose to take her time bringing them to.  Being on our lunch break, we just didn't have time to bother with the laziness of this restaurant.  We have to go back to work and actually work to earn our paychecks. We've given this location a chance more than once and today was the final straw.  We won't be dining at this place ever again."
Addie H.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,4,3,1.0,9/28/2016,Made an order online that was confirmed. Arrived at restaurant to pick it up. Initially the 2 employees I encountered bad attitudes and pawned me off on someone else when they couldnt find record of my order. Then the last too acted too busy for me. They said they didnt have my order so I proceeded to leave. As Im walking out the door they offer to put it in and make it. Didnt want the food anymore and definitely didnt want anywhere servicing me. Won't go back ever again.
Larry C.,"Dallas, TX",0,4,,2.0,1/27/2017,I have a lot of mixed feeling about this visit to Applebee's. The place was not busy so we were seated promptly however there was only one server taking care of 8 to 10 tables. we waited a few minutes before they took our drink order. Then a several more mi nutes before they took our food order.  The appetizer took so long that we were worried the would bring out our entries first. But the appetizer finally arrived and was hot and delishous. The entries arrived at the perfect time just as we finished. My wife loved her Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp. I ordered the Butcher's Meats and Potato's but was rather disappointed. The potato's were flavorless. The large chunks of tomato overpowered everything and the grissle in the meat was inedible. I won't be ordering this entre again but Applebee's does have a lot of items I like.
Samantha H.,"Sparks, NV",0,3,,1.0,10/8/2017,"First time I went there I used the car side service and ordered the sirloin steak and shrimp. It was brought out in ten minutes and was delicious. The 2nd time I ordered two of the same. Waited ten minutes - had to call - waited 30 minutes and finally got the order. The two sirloins were 2ozs instead of six - looked like they cut an inch off the sides - was overdone and everything was cold! The last time I ordered a 8 oz sirloin and shrimp Parmesan on the side with green beans and mashed potatoes. I went inside. My feet stuck to the floor and the smell was horrible. The counter tops were also sticky. When I. Thought my order home, they gave me broccoli instead of potatoes and the steak was gristley and they up the shrimp in top of the steak.  I threw up. I will recommend the State inspect their facility for disease bearing bacteria. Oh - I did call the manager first and he just said I should come back to get the order right. He didn't seem to realize how dirty it was."
Donnell S.,"Dallas, TX",33,31,28,4.0,4/6/2016,"Don't miss out on the Cedar Salmon with steamed veggies & red potatoes on top of steamed spinach leaves. It's low-cal, heart friendly, yet tastes like a deluxe meal. Cooked to perfection on this Wednesday afternoon."
L R.,"Carrollton, TX",0,6,,2.0,9/19/2016,"This location has had a change in bartender.   She is not as gracious as Shelby.  I was served the same order that I always order except it was too hot.  The bartender didn't wait for me to rearrange my eating area and on the fly said the plate was hot, it was way hotter than I've ever been served. I tried to rearrange my glasses and tablet(we had been enjoying our time with a tablet) I had to move the hot plate myself and burned(blistered) my fingers.  The owners idea to fix things was to put mustard on the blisters that were forming on my fingers.  We paid and left."
Nicole C.,"Dallas, TX",777,226,2837,1.0,12/13/2015,"This was the first time I went to this Applebee's location, let me say it will be my last.  First my service was terrible and my food was very mediocre.  I ordered a burger but I noticed that they had a special that I did not see at first.  I tried to change my order which was probably just placed about 5 minutes prior to me asking for the change, I was told no by the waitress.  I asked for a medium well burger and I got a rare one.  It was bleeding all over the plate.  When I told the waitress she cut me off and told me that is how the restaurant makes their medium well burgers.  Which I know is a lie because the burger was bleeding and pretty much raw in the middle.  I got anther burger which was still not cooked right but I attempted to eat it.  NO apologies was given it was almost like I was the one that made a mistake.  Nonetheless save your time and money with this place."
Steve S.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,30,1,1.0,9/18/2014,"I love Applebee's! This was my first time at this location, and the staff seemed so BOTHERED that I was even here. It was 10pm when we arrived. Applebee's is known to be late night eats... So why was the host and wait staffed so annoyed that we were here? Today is Thursday. The menu on the table said Throwback Thursday with drink specials on it. I asked the host what was in them because they sounded fun. He immediately cut me off and said, THATS ONLY THE LAST THURSDAY OF THE MONTH. I asked him what was in them. He said he didn't know. No where on the menu does it say Last Thursday.  At all.  When my server came I asked him what was in them.  He said he honestly had no clue. Applebee's- do better. Train your staff, and if you are going to market specials, have them be specific, because the way it comes across is that your staff is lying to me."
