Leslie C.,"Dallas, TX",102,32,10,1.0,2/25/2012,"I wish I could rate this 0 stars, but I can't! After this whole fiasco of a horrible lunch I get cussed out by their trailer trash bartender for voicing my opinion of this Applebees from hell! So go here if you want to be disrespected and cussed out after you spent your hard earned money! Go here if you don't mind waiting 45 minutes for a shrimp & spinach salad (that they forgot to put the shrimp on!!) and a cup of soup. This place is so unorganized that it took them 15 minutes to bring me out the shrimp for the salad that took 30 min, another 15 minutes for a second salad, plus another 5 minutes for the last and final of the endless salads which again they messed up by drenching it in dressing (they bring them out on this tiny kidney shaped saucer pan which I don't understand why they changed up the lunch when they would bring you a full plate?) Towards the end of our meal, I wanted to give the waiter a tip even though he had been somewhat unattentive the whole time.. Â So waited for him to pick up the bill so he could bring me change, but he never did! I waited for 5-7min more & then decided I would simply go up to the bar to get some change so I could go, but before I could the bartender said something I didn't catch, told me to hold on, then ran out the front door...?? I was left standing there like what is going on with this place, tried to wait once again to see if she was coming back but now its like 1 hour in---for some lunch!?! Thinking everyone who works here must be on something I just shook my head then left and said forget it~ But this is when it gets really good: Outside as I walk to my car I say out loud ""This place is so unorganized!"" & the bartender hears me so she takes offense, gets all Gun-ho in my face & says ""What you're calling me unorganized my customer ran off with my slip?!! If you think I'm unorganized why don't you go tell my manager, then"" I was beyond words at that point I saw red! Words were definitely exchanged! But my point is you don't argue with a customer, ever, and she didn't even know why I had said that!! It was my opinion and I have every right to it!! This place is shot to hell! Don't waste your time like I did!"
