Jessica R.,"The Colony, TX",109,22,9,5.0,1/28/2016,I don't know why this only has 2 stars? I had the brunch burger and it was amazing!!! We had Bahamas mama drinks for super cheap .. That is cray.. I thought it was better than chilis and cheesecake factories burger.. See Brianna for bomb customer service.. She was the bomb.. Amazing customer service .. All of these reviews must be BS
Whitney F.,"Carrollton, TX",53,2,,2.0,6/27/2015,"Having been a server for 10+ years, I'm pretty lenient when it comes to my wait staff. I'll notice little things most others won't while dining out, and take that into consideration when it comes to my server. Having said that, I absolutely hate the service at this location. I wish I would have read the reviews before coming in, because I would have saved myself the trouble. The food was good! That's the only saving grace about this establishment. My family and I came in around 4 and sat in the bar, and things went downhill from there. My parents split 3 different appetizers, while I got one sampler with 3 appetizers. My mother and I both reminded the waitress that my parents wanted the larger size, while I wanted the sampler. Food took a little while, no biggy, we were having fun! When the food did come out, we noticed my parents got the small sizes indicating a sampler, not what we ordered. We were given no appetizer plates, no extra napkins, and it took a while to flag down our waitress and ask if we were given the wrong sizes. She apologized, in which case my dad informed her since they were so small that he would like to order another appetizer since we were all kind of sharing it. We also asked for napkins and appetizer plates, which we never received. It was the last time we saw our waitress. I myself am 8 months pregnant, and had to nurse my water almost the whole meal. My mother eventually went up to the bar and asked for a refill of my drink. We had to sit and wait, again, to get our check to leave. During this time, I noticed serveral managers talking to each other, in front of customers, but not once did any of them check on the state of their restaurant or see how their customers were doing. The point of a manager being on the floor is to touch tables, engage with customers and make sure people leave happy. We did not! The 2 waitresses/bartenders that were taking care of us were doing their cut work so they could leave, almost completely ignoring their guests. They were so busy with trying to get out that their customer service was seriously lacking! A single gentleman in a booth beside us had his food dropped off and by the time we left not a single person had checked on him, though he was donel with his food and his beer and had been for some time. Not to mention my father was charged for the quesadillas he ordered. Again, being a server when our food came out wrong I would have gone up to a manager, told them the situation and had one of them check on the table. Since it was my fault, I would have seen if there was any that I could take something off the check or offer them a free desert.  I'm amazed that this location has received so many negative reviews and it appears the restaurant and corporate don't seem to care because nothing has been done to change it! They'd rather have their employees sitting down, managers standing around and everyone generally ignoring their customers than offering a pleasant dining experience. Message received Applebee's! I won't be coming back to this establishment."
Heather T.,"Dallas, TX",33,7,,1.0,6/3/2015,"I am a pretty tolerant person.  I understand and forgive a lot of things.  Rarely do I ever say anything negative about anyone.  My standard tip for anyone waiting on or serving me is 15% and it only goes up from there because I feel people should be rewarded for hard work.  Especially if it is exemplary. I say those things to let you know just how much I was disappointed in this location.  If I could give this location 0 stars, I would.  I have ventured in to this black hole two times in the past 6 months.  Both times with one other person.  Both times with a ton of empty tables and booths available. Both times intentionally at less busy times of the day. ( around 3:00 and then 2:30) The first time we were starving so after 6 minutes and no greeting, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try and we sat ourselves at a dirty table.  All of the tables and booths in the bar were dirty. We flagged a hostess down because there were no wait staff to be found. We asked for drinks (A Corona and an iced tea).  She rolled her eyes and said she would do it.  After waiting for 10 minutes, we got up and left.   No one even noticed.  I took my Mom last week and we stood there waiting and watching some of the staff sit at a booth and watch us for 5 minutes, we left. No one noticed us or said a single word.  I love, love, love Applebee's.  However, I will never set foot in this location ever again.  Even though it is 5 minutes from my house."
Erin M.,"Dallas, TX",13,52,46,1.0,9/19/2015,"Stopped in for take out. Thankfully had a manager take my order after watching the curbside associate get an attitude with a customer over an extra dressing (which the customer was willing to pay for).  The manager took my order, made suggestions, and got the bartender to pour me a beer right away. Wasn't too busy at the bar at 650pm but a rowdy bunch were watching tv. Still a good ambience for chilling after work. My experience turned from average to plain bad about twenty minutes later. My food still hadn't been brought out (I'd been told by the manager that they would bring me my food in an estimated 13 minutes).  I saw the to go cashier walk by and asked her if my food was ready. She didn't even answer just gestured for me to follow. And there was my food sitting in the curbside to go room waiting for me (and already cold). It had probably been done at least 10 minutes. I was livid. I saw the manager come up and talk to the cashier as I left. I should have asked for a refund. This is absurd."
Tina D.,"Dallas, TX",39,2,,1.0,3/31/2016,This place deserves no stars. Its only getting 1 because the food was okay. The service was terrible. Had to go to the bar to get refills on drinks and all I had   was water. Oh and did I say the service was terrible. Maybe you will have some luck at a different location but definitely not this one.
Ebony N.,"Columbus, OH",31,8,,1.0,3/14/2016,Please do not patronage the Applebee's on Frankford and Marsh Ln. clearly they support/hire racist people to manage their lawn care. they also allow the son of the owner to get extremely drunk and spew words of hatred! Calling one of the waiters his favorite black person. he also requested he be referred to as Mr. Caucasian. mind you majority of people eating in the restaurant were people of color. I will never be back to that location. I hope you will not give that company your hard earned dollars. Where employees are forced to put on a smile when being belittled!
Brian H.,"Dallas, TX",0,4,,5.0,12/30/2016,The food and drinks are terrific. Great value. My car died in the parking lot and the manager came out to help give me a jump. He was extremely friendly and helpful. Above and beyond service. I will definitely be back.
Eric K.,"Peyton, CO",1,39,,1.0,10/10/2016,"Tonight the place was almost empty and the service sucked.    The bathroom smelled like the zoo,out of paper towels and no soap.   Try somewhere else."
Deanna Y.,"Plano, TX",1,21,,1.0,8/29/2016,I ordered a steak and it was awful! I ordered it medium well and it was cooked medium well but it was way to chewy and it still had a cold feeling to it. It was not a good steak at all and the sad thing is I got it to go so I didn't have a chance to send it back. The Cesar salad I had was pitiful looking and tasting the best thing about my meal was the potatoes with bacon. The shrimp that were on top of the steak were flavorless and nothing special my $24 meal was not worth it!!
Tony S.,"Carrollton, TX",3,43,1,1.0,5/13/2017,"I went to Applebee's wanting to have a nice lunch.. I was seated and the electronic device (kiosk) was filthy and there were straw wrappers stuffed behind it. The menu was filthy. Food all over it.  The table wasn't very clean. If the Front of House is this dirty,I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like where our food is prepared. After 10 minutes, no one had come to greet me or take my order. They weren't busy at all.  I got up and left. I called the Manager when I got home, and I could barely understand him with his thick accent. I don't think he is a very good Manager allowing the dining room to look that way. I honestly believe he doesn't have a full understanding on how important how clean things should be.  All that is a reflection on the management. I know, I used to manage a restaurant. If they don't care about the dining room, I would venture to say, they don't care about anything else.  First Impressions, you know!"
Jason A.,"Dallas, TX",0,2,,1.0,9/30/2016,Tonight my wife and I went here for dinner and it was the worst experience we have ever had at any Applebee's we have ever been to. First the service poor it seemed like our waiter was to busy with something other then waiting on his tables. Second my wife ordered a steak cooked medium and it came out like a hockey puck the first time so we sent it back. After 20 or so minutes later the waiter finally came over and told us they messed up the steak again and was making her another one. Finally the manager brought her a steak that was ok but not great. We had to flag out waiter down just to get our drinks refilled and to get the check. We paid and left him a 9 dollar tip on a 40 dollar dinner when we shouldn't have left him anything. We will not be back anytime soon if ever.
David A.,"Carrollton, TX",23,53,3,1.0,2/21/2015,This place sucks don't waste ur time R money  Filthy place and the music was blasting is there a manager / owner of this place needs to take a look around I will say our waitress Lauren was really good and on top of it...props Lauren
Rhonda T.,"Carrollton, TX",29,4,,1.0,10/29/2016,"Went to Applebee's for my son's 16th birthday as it was his choice to go but was the most disappointing visit to a restaurant we have had as of late and a flop of a birthday dinner.  We will not be returning to this location or not too any Applebee's for that matter....they should take a place such as Cheddars as something to emulate as at Cheddars and places like it you get what you pay for in portion sizes and presentation. First off I ordered a Ginger Ale to drink and was told that there was no refills on that particular soda while there are refills on other sodas. I ordered the Chicken Tortilla soup and it was very subpar in what my idea of what Chicken Tortilla soup should be and corn seem to be the filler in this soup as there was way too much corn in relation to other parts of the soup. I asked for some crackers to have with the soup and they were extremely stale. As an appetizer ordered the chips and salsa and the size of that platter was even jaw dropping and the chips were way too greasy. My husband loves the Wonton Tacos BUT he ordered the two appetizer special and was disappointed to be told by the waiter that on the special you don't get the four wonton tacos but instead only three...so this is really no special deal at all, and the French Onion Soup was even smaller than the portion it should be....BEWARE!!! The specials are deceiving and are not really specials at all.  Being my son's birthday they said he could have a birthday dessert....it was the biggest joke I have ever seen as it was smaller than what a small kid's size portion would be....we are talking about a 230 lb 6'4 foot guy who ate it basically in one bite. My daughter ordered the brownie bite as well and the brownies in it were so hard I thought she may crack a tooth.....the portion size was so small that she even laughed. The presentation to these desserts are very unappealing in the way they come in the bowl as well. I am very disappointed in Applebee's and will not be returning as it was a real turn off and a huge disappointment. Spending $65.00 on a subpar meal was pretty disheartening as well. Corporate should be ashamed of themselves in the way they run their restaurant at the expense of their customers....only seeming to care more about turning tables than creating a wonderful food experience for the patron. I only wish that we had have made  a different choice as it was our son's 16th birthday and it was a very subpar experience to say the least........Oh and the bathroom could use some attention as my sandals stuck to the floor when trying to walk, toilet areas a mess and soap canisters broken, dirty sink and the list could go on....BAD BAD EXPERIENCE!!! APPLEBEE'S IS RAISING THEIR PRICES AND LOWERING THEIR PORTIONS. CORPORATE MAY THINK THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE IDIOTS BUT THEY ARE NOT AND CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH IT...YOU MIGHT THINK TWICE AS YOUR STAR RATING SAYS IT ALL.....SHAME ON YOU!!!"
Thomas H.,"Dallas, TX",67,60,22,1.0,1/20/2015,"This store: GHETTO CROWD  GHETTO MUSIC AT NIGHT TERRIBLE DECOR TERRIBLE BATHROOMS The tables literally had engraved graffiti on them ie initials etc. Hands down worst chain establishment I have ever been to in the USA/World.  Will not go back or recommend. If anyone ever asks about it I will forbid them going there. If you are debating the real severity of this place and might just go anyway,  you will absolutely regret it."
Nick S.,"Dallas, TX",195,8,1,5.0,2/16/2016,Bar staff is always amazing. Caster and Shelby always make sure to take great care of you. This is my new hangout for sure!
David B.,"Dallas, TX",103,76,5,1.0,8/15/2015,"I'm never going to come to this place again. I've been three times, since I live in the area, and each time it has been worse. This last time the waiter didn't go over any specials pertaining to the drinks or appetizers as it was after 11pm when my fiance and I went. I filled out the survey on the back of the receipt to receive not a call, text, email--nothing. Obviously they don't care about their customers so I will spend my money elsewhere."
Frankie S.,"Dallas, TX",181,69,8,3.0,9/20/2014,"It's everything you're expecting Applebee's to be. The food is VERY VERY SALTY and is just okay. I ordered the pasta, which was good. Nick had so burger like thing but instead of bums there was tortillas. He didn't like it at all.  We went expecting good drink specials but happy hour doesn't start till 10."
Emily R.,"Carrollton, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/6/2015,Service was fine but the food crap! Had the steak and right as I was walking out started to feel like crap. My boyfriend had wings and felt the same. It was so gross...
Kerem K.,"Dallas, TX",0,5,,1.0,7/10/2016,"We went to dinner on 7/8/2016. I bought appetizers plate. I felt nauseated,The morning after I had bloody diarrhea . I had to use antibiotics. Don`t eat there if you dont want to be sick.!!!!Never again"
Bethany D.,"Austin, TX",12,5,,5.0,1/28/2016,We enjoyed great food and great service tonight.. Brianna was great! The prices and the food was bomb! Check this place out.. They have awesome specials late at night and the sweet potato fries are super crispy!
