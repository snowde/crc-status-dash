Han S.,"Addison, TX",0,9,5,4.0,7/22/2016,"Great steaks. Was very impressed. We've gone several times and only had a small problem once, but it wasn't anything major. Our server was a bit aloof. Again, just that one time"
Emily I.,"Dallas, TX",22,2,,1.0,2/24/2014,"I have been to this Applebees a few times. Always getting the same thing as normal. But this time they switched the menu around & added some stuff & took away some. My boyfriend always gets the ribs & could add a full rack for so many more dollars. They had taken that option away. Our server however was going to let him order the whole ribs as long as he paid a $4 fee which would be like a side of chicken but just substituted for a half rack of ribs. 10-15 min. later we hear the manager say he needs to talk to our waiter in the back room (the manager was being very loud & swearing in front of the customers & you could tell he was not happy at all.) A few min later our waiter comes out & tells us he just got yelled at for doing that & we would have to order something else or pay for each thing separately. He askes if we would like to talk to the manager & we say no. After our waiter leaves to go get us another menu his manager comes rushing out of the back & PUSHES one of his employees out of his way. He said our waiter told him we wanted to talk to him, the waiter didn't even go back to talk to him, we watched him the whole time. & while he would walk away from our table he would just stare.  Needless to say this isn't the 1st time we have had a problem with him.& there was two other people who also had problems. Every time we go even our waiter/waitress/host/hostess has nothing but horrible things to say about him when he was there. I would rather travel further for good service than go somewhere where nobody seems to be having a good time with their co-workers."
Chris C.,"Dallas, TX",0,13,5,2.0,8/8/2015,"Haven't been to Apple Bees in atleast 5 years or more.  It was bad then and it's bad now.  The bread was stale on my sandwich.  So much so you could knock on it. My wife's french onion soup was nothing but a glob of bread and cheese.  The wait staff was very nice and helpful,  restaurant was clean,  food is just terrible."
Emily H.,"Carrollton, TX",6,64,9,1.0,5/1/2016,Crap hole. Service is so awful. Food is always pretty good for the cheap price but the service is just so bad it's not worth the time.
Donnie A.,"Carrollton, TX",4,9,,1.0,8/19/2016,"First and last time!!!!, server disappeared took about 30 mins just to place my order, when he would pass by I would try to talk to him to ask to place my order he would stick his finger rudely up in the air in a one min sign,it wasn't busy. after finally being permitted to place my order, the food came out about 45-50 mins later, cold, mind you it wasn't busy. By the way did i mention that I ordered steak not chicken, at this point I was exhausted and scared to send the food back for fear something unsavory may happen to my food so I ate the damn tasteless nasty greasy chicken. The funny thing is when it came time for me to pay suddenly the server decided he was going to move quickly and kinda rush me along to get payment and his tip, there has been several complaints of credit card fraud from this location, personally watched 2 different tables have issues with credit card charges during my visit, I WOULD NOT USE A CREDIT CARD AT THIS LOCATION. I have been to other Applebee's locations this specific location should just be closed down if they expect to uphold any dignity."
Larry W.,"Dallas, TX",147,30,62,5.0,10/5/2015,"Wow!!!! I recently had an issue with a visit to this location, so bad in fact had it been my first time, I would not have returned... But I know this location to typically be very good because we visit here often. Anyway, I called and spoke with Carlos to share our experience and he was EXTREMELY kind and accommodating. He spoke to me vey frankly and respectfully, made no excuses, took his time with me, and offered a satisfactory accommodation. I was very impressed with his customer service and way of handling this situation... He truly made me feel that he cared and wanted to make the situation right. This guy is a rockstar."
Angela N.,"Carrollton, Dallas, TX",36,54,149,3.0,9/5/2015,"Waitress was super sweet! It's clean....but the food is very salty and over spiced! Sean was ""hungry as hell"" and has never ever offered up ""a taste"" of his food, yet I've counted 4 times he had offered me a taste of his ribs. (Ribs at that)!!"
Justin O'Keith H.,"Dallas, TX",427,114,61,3.0,1/15/2015,Things most definitely could be better. Every time I go in here it leaves me wanting more. It's okay but I've been to many Applebee's where it's been awesome. We go usually for the late night specials. The spinach dip is a huge no go! Avoid. Very watery. The staff seems like they don't want to be there and truly affects the experience.
Daniel M.,"Nashville, TN",3,35,6,1.0,6/6/2015,"Completely utterly terrible service! Stay away! Filthy matted carpets, sticky tables and poor service, customers are an inconvenience to the waitstaff, DONT order anything from the bar, it's a waste of money, well that is if you enjoyed being ripped off on your drinks. Food was 1/10 and that's being generous. Avoid this place. Gross factor is high here..."
Brian G.,"Dallas, TX",4,4,,1.0,1/8/2016,"The service was terrible here. It seems this is an ongoing problem after reading all the Yelp reviews. Our waiter basically took our order and that was it. We orders chips and salsa as an appetizer. We waited and waited and waited. It seems the waitstaff was too busy dealing with regulars, larger parties than the two of us and birthdays. They sang the birthday song three times in the hour and a half that we were there. Finally our waiter stopped and asked if we had gotten our chips and salsa yet.  We replied with a no and he went and got them. Then about 5 minutes later our food was out. Is it wrong to enjoy an appetizer BEFORE your food arrives? The food looked alright. I ordered the smaller chicken fingers, fries and Honey Dijon. My partner ordered the Buffalo Wings and Blue Cheese dressing. Yet, none of the dipping sauces we ordered showed up. I noticed and i was turning around to get the girls attention who brought out the other (and this wasnt our waiter) and she turned away and left before I could. I guess she couldnt hear me over the birthday song being sung nearby. So again, we waited and waited. The food we had that was hot was now cold. We had to finally have another waiter get the manager for us. After waiting another amount of time, the manager finally comes over. We explain the situation to her. She was friendly to us, but seemed like she wasnt able to do much for us. All she could offer was a free dessert. We told her thank you but it wasnt enough. We paid the check and left.So i cant recommend this place at all."
Jean Pierre H.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",145,56,17,1.0,5/10/2013,"I don't like to complain a lot and often don't mind if the service is marginal because lets face it this is an Applebee's. The service was horribly slow, our waitress would disappear for long periods of time and I had an empty drink for most of my visit. I normally would have ordered a desert but I didn't want to risk having to sleep in the booth and have it for breakfast considering how long everything seemed to be taking. The manager while actively engaging anyone foolish enough to make eye contact with her as she made her rounds offered little assistance. She was the kind of person that exuded inability, the kind of person you see the wheels turning and then quickly realize the hamster is dead.  I don't know if I should blame the staff or the management, either way I don't care I just simply won't be back. I came in expecting nothing and yet somehow still feel disappointed. If you're reading this, go else where its just not worth the 25 dollars or so you're probably about to spend."
Marv H.,"Carrollton, Dallas, TX",9,25,3,1.0,8/17/2013,"And then I remembered why I stopped eating at Applebee's years ago :( A friend and I decided to go to Applebee's while our husbands watched some preseason football. The atmosphere was pretty laid back considering the football games that were on that night but I noticed the sports and bar area was closed off from the rest of the restaurant. Thumbs up for Applebee's! Our server Casey was really nice and helpful. We both ordered the Parmesan Sirloin and Shrimp and my friend enjoyed the mess out of it! (She's pregnant) I not so much. :( The steak was HORRIBLE! And that's putting it mildly. Omg it was so rubbery! Rubbery to the point of being almost artificial. The garlic mashed potatoes were ok. I figured my best bet would be to finish just the broccoli and call it quits. I ordered dessert which was some sort of chocolate meltdown cake. It was ok, really nothing to brag about.  Overall, the service was great but this place needs a major facelift. I'll avoid Applebee's at all costs."
Char R.,"Uptown, Dallas, TX",0,2,,1.0,9/1/2014,"We had a server named Nancy who forced us to smile at her before taking our order. Ordered wings and Quesadillas. While she sat around, the hostess brought our food. Had to ask for Nancy repeatedly for xtra napkins for the wings. My husband ordered a vodka and coke with his meal. He is 31 and I am 29. She brought our check before we were done and when my husband tried to order another drink she sent her manager over to our table where he proceeded to tell us she saw me drinking his vodka and coke. I am 8 months pregnant! I didn't touch his drink. After being accused of drinking (even tho I am of age and pregnant anyway) she refused to bring our check, apologize or even say goodbye. Needless to say we will NEVER go back again. If you happen to find yourself at this Applebee's please be sure to request ANYONE but Nancy!"
Amy B.,"Dallas, TX",322,672,474,3.0,4/21/2012,"A decent place to get cheap food (half price apps) and drunk (drink specials) at night. +10 for being 2 blocks away from my apartment. Chris is an awesome waiter! We were seated at a booth at first since the place was packed, but he quickly cleared off a set of tables for my group of 7. Great guy! FYI, tequila shots have 8 lbs of salt on them and some IN it. I'd ask for salt on the side :P"
April A.,"Dallas, TX",0,22,5,1.0,9/11/2014,"There's nothing like the feeling you get waiting for a member of the wait staff to acknowledge your presence. Thank you so much for walking past my table, looking me directly in the eyes, and ignoring my existence FOUR TIMES IN 10 MINUTES. This franchise location is terrible. Not only is the service awful but they regularly substitute mountain dew for red bull in a jagerbomb...really? Don't waste your time or money"
Jay K.,"Fort Worth, TX",384,148,24,2.0,10/23/2012,"I was here about a week ago. Service was decent when we came, but the food takes it all the way down to two stars for me. The appetitizer was large and greasy to fill you and the main dish was small to save themselves some money. When the dessert came out, it was a cookie with two lumps of ice cream. It was terribly made as if a 6 year old attempted and failed. My dollars were wasted here. Only reason I came was to accomadate distance for a friend and she knew there was an applebees here. I highly recommend Duke's in addison if you want American fare from a chain. Their food and service is great compared to this horsedung. If you don't want noise, avoid the crowds and the days when bikers show up."
O K.,"Dallas, TX",0,4,1,2.0,2/15/2016,"I went here late a few times to get to go orders. The crowd is a little ghetto & trailer park trashy. But it looks like everyone was having fun & singing along to the music. Seemed like everyone was able just to walk wherever they wanted , even slightly behind the bar? I don't know just wasn't my scene and drunk guys tried to talk to me. Haven't been back since then."
Mello X.,"Abilene, TX",0,6,1,1.0,9/4/2013,Went to AppleBee...this past Sunday.. My boyfriend got the steak and it was blue (raw) and i got riblets that the sauce smelled so bad that i could not eat it....talk about the worst food Ever!!!
Kim N.,"Rowlett, TX",15,3,1,1.0,4/15/2014,"We've been to a few Applebee's before. This one is not really up to the standard of others. It took forever to get the waitress to take our drink order. Then she got my son's order wrong. While we were waiting for our food, she massaged another employee shoulder. She touched another customer a few times. She leaned on me a few times. This really creeps me out. Maybe she is really friendly, but I don't think it's professional. I don't think we will be back to this location again."
Doug A.,"Carrollton, TX",0,1,,1.0,2/21/2015,"I would comment on the food but since we never met your server after 15 minutes,  I can't.  Avoid this location."
