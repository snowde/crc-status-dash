Stephen L.,"Dallas, TX",31,21,1,1.0,11/23/2013,This place is slow when it comes to service and there was a dirty diaper smell throughout the restaurant really disappointed with this location
Reba G.,"Dallas, TX",567,688,556,1.0,11/10/2011,"If I could rate this place 0 stars, I totally would.  I didn't expect to wait an hour and a half to get our food served for a party of 8.  One girl's steak came out with cold cheese on top of her steak.  I love that they offer healthier options and happy hours all day, but the 2 hour service does not make it worth it at all.  Please keep staff training up to par."
Tyler R.,"North Dallas, Dallas, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/29/2013,Worst service ever. The girl at the bar was my waitress and only checked up on me probably twice when my food was served and didn t come back to see if I wanted a refill on my drink. I ordered baby back ribs and needed more sauce. I asked for more sauce but never got it. Thanks Applebee s
RA R.,"Dallas, TX",0,2,,2.0,1/12/2015,"I hadn't been here in a while so I was looking forward to it. It's right around the corner and we always have a pleasant time.  When we walked in, the little foyer area had music blaring so loud we had to have the host repeat himself. We sat in the bar to see the sports updates and still I might as well have been in a nightclub, the jukebox was soo loud!   I saw the waitstaff at the jukebox just as often as they were at the computer next to it. We've watched games there before and yelling was not necessary in the past.  It wasn't where we were sitting because it looked like no one in the bar area was talking without yelling at people right next to them.  Our server was not very attentive. It seemed that she was taking care of tables all over the restaurant and had to be asked for water, straws for the water and then refills of the water. We even got to the point where we were asking other servers to give us what we lacked and then even had to ask someone else for the check.  As for the food, it was as good as I remembered. I love their parmesan steak and shrimp.  I'd overlook all of it if I didn't have to yell to talk to my friend and yell for everything else too.  I'll give it another year before I go back."
Gina D.,"Saint Louis, MO",1,11,,1.0,7/3/2015,"My sister, my nephew, and I decided to go the the Frankford location (as we have a couple times a week since moving to TX a few weeks ago.) This particular time the waitress wasn't the best and messed our order up so I decided I no longer wanted my order as it was incorrect and just wanted to pay for my husband's to go order. She told me it would be better to get two orders of the bar size wings than one regular order so I listened to what she recommended. She must have forgotten she told me that and brought out 1 4 piece order. I told her that I wanted the 2 orders she suggested then asked if i could get them at once since it would be weird to eat 4 now and 4 in 15 minutes. She told me no she could not so i didnt want anything. The waitress decided to get the manager who came over and threw my order on the table with an attitude and walked away. I looked at the bill after he did this and asked our waitress get the manager to come back. He started to lie and say it was not possible to have 2 orders of wings as the waitress talked me into getting so she would have to bring them out separately. We were still calm and he just kept going with his disgusting attitude towards us. At this point I explained to him I haven't be rude to him and didn't appreciate the way he spoke to us. After he still said I could not take my meal off that had not been eaten/touched I told him that's all I was paying for when I got my cash out. We have never been treated so bad at a restaurant before And were beyond embarrassed  Our waitress Maddie and The manager Paul were horrible. I could understand his attitude of we were rude to him but to treat us like that and embarrass us by causing such a scene was more than uncalled for! Do not go here unless you like bad service (maybe its just at night as all other visits were during the day). The bad attitudes started from when we entered but brushed it off and continued when we couldnt track our waitress down when i wanted to order a drink so another waitress got an attitude when we asked if wmshe knew which waitress was for our area because we couldnt remember who she was since she only came to our table once."
Don H.,"Plano, TX",1,16,,3.0,1/6/2012,"For dinner Wednesday evening, I ordered the Fish&Chips. The menu specifically states the meal comes with fries and slaw. It did not come with slaw. NP. I finally got my waitress' attention. She informed they do not include slaw unless a person specifically asks for it. So I did. Boy was it bad. I think they instituted this policy because they saw nobody eats it. The policy they need to impement is teaching their cooks to make coleslaw. Then, people would eat it. Anyway, the wife ordered a cajun shrimp pasta which she hated. So we swapped dinners. She doesn't like slaw and the fish suited her fine. I thought the cajun pasta dish was very good. The restaurant is very nice, and there are PLENTY of TVs, so we caught all the sports we wanted. The service was a bit lacking, which I do not understand because it was not busy. Our waitress didn't appear to be focused on attending our needs. But she was not rude nor insulting, so I'm guessing she just had a bad night. We would most definitely come back. But we would not order the coleslaw."
Jackie L.,"Dallas, TX",2,2,,2.0,2/16/2015,Went out to eat with the family last night. Nothing here to write home about! Not good or totally bad just so so.
Andrea G.,"Carrollton, TX",9,5,,1.0,8/21/2014,"The only reason I go to Applebee's is because I like one item on the menu a lot and they have good potato twisters and sangria. I ordered a pitcher of sangria and watched as the bartender dipped his straw in and pull some out put the end of the straw into his mouth, and then put the straw he just had in his mouth back into the pitcher to take yet another drink. Then I ordered an oriental chicken salad. The only thing that I've ordered there (and only reason I come) for well over 10 years. He asked if I wanted it how it came in the menu and I replied yes, and to have crispy chicken. He brought out grilled chicken on the salad. I asked if I could have crispy instead and he let me know for further reference that grilled chicken is what comes on the salad, even though everytime I've ordered this meal it has never ever come with grilled chicken. I decided to look online at the menu to check to see if something had changed, and it did in fact say crispy fried chicken on top. So if you're going to correct your customers, at least be correct. Will probably make the drive to frisco or lewisville instead"
John M.,"Dallas, TX",0,6,,1.0,10/11/2013,"Did a follow up visit to good ole Applebee's.   Instead of dining in I called and ordered a steak with garlic shrimp for pick up.  I was advised to just pull up and they would bring the food out to the curb.   I arrived on time and waited 5 minutes without anyone coming out to the curb.  I walked in and waited another 4 minutes while the cashier could finish taking another order.  I realized that my steak had been sitting behind the cashier the whole time. I paid and tipped and returned home.   The steak was okay, but the shrimp had a spoiled smell.  So I avoided the shrimp and ate the steak.  Trust me after an evening in the restroom, I will never go back to a Applebee's again.  They can keep that Neighborhood Restaurant spirit to themselves.  I prefer to sleep in my bed and not in my bathroom."
Maddison A.,"Denton, TX",257,3,1,1.0,9/24/2013,Some of the worst bar service I've ever had. everyone at the bar started looking at each other wondering if we needed to serve ourselves....I work in this industry. Uncalled for.
Taylor N.,"Dallas, TX",1,9,,1.0,9/30/2014,"Let me just  start by saying me and  my  fiance  both  work  in the  restaurant /customer  service  business. Our  experience  was  absolutely atrocious. First, it  was  a monday night  (slow  night)  and  there  was  2 couples waiting  on  the  host  when  we  walked  in. I should  have  walked  out  then. Secondly, the  waitress (who  didnt  tell us  her  name) was  completely  rude. Her  first  question  was, ""any  dessert  tonight? "" uhhh?! Then she  didnt  write anything  down (not  impressive)  gave my  fiance the  wrong order, my  wings  came  out  10 mins  after  the  ribs and  they  looked  sloppy. She  also  rolled  her  eyes  a couple  times  and  didnt let  me  or  him  finish  our  orders before  she  walked  away. I will never  go  back  here, now  i know  why  theres a now  hiring  sign  outside, get  rid  of  bad waitresses  and  get  some  people  who  actually enjoy  people  and  helping  them."
Johnny C.,"Carrollton, TX",1,90,21,2.0,11/11/2012,Service was good but food was horrible. I order the ribs but there was more sauce than meat. My wife had the 9 oz sirloin and it taste pretty bad. It did not taste fresh at all. I will not go back any time soon.
Jennifer C.,"Portland, OR",21,76,,1.0,4/21/2012,"Applebee's in general sucks but this is the worst one I've ever been to.  It's never clean and service is slow.  I haven't gotten food poisoning here but that's the best thing I can say about the food.  Any restaurant in a five mile radius is better than this one.  I was going there for ladies nights on Weds. as they have $3 martinis but one of the bartenders there, Trish, is pretty unfriendly and rude.  I'll gladly take my money elsewhere and not wake up hating myself for having frequented there."
Roni B.,"Euless, TX",337,552,242,4.0,6/20/2013,you can't go wrong w/ ballin on a budget drinks....love love love the spider bite shots...they're greatness!! our waiter (reggie) wasn't too friendly or attentive...but that decreased his tip & kept my wallet a little on the happy side lol
J J.,"Carrollton, TX",91,131,15,2.0,6/2/2012,The upside?  It's edible.  You can get full. The downside?  Just about everything else.  Crummy food.  Crummy service.  Crummy crummy.  Keep your money.
Stacie F.,"Carrollton, TX",42,50,1,1.0,7/31/2013,"In the past I would be here at least 2 times a week, but last night was horrible so I will be finding a new dinner spot. The ribs were a very small portion. The coleslaw was two bites in a little cup. We waited 10 minutes for our cokes and 25 for our chips and dip. Then 5 minutes later our food came out. The manager came around later without a name tag and asked how everything was for the night. It was not worth our time to explain it to him."
John H.,"Dallas, TX",0,11,,3.0,1/25/2014,"We seem to always pick the wrong time to visit.  Its either bad weather outside, or late hours.   I say that because the service is always short staffed.  One particular time, the greeter was clueless.  She had a hard time keeping the names and number of people in the party straight.  She was probably brand new, but, we never did see her later.   Overall, it is an ok place to go to, when nothing else is open and you like the applebee specials."
Travis H.,"Dallas, TX",79,3,,4.0,5/9/2012,A lot of bad reviews here. I get great service at the bar with Tricia and Roger! Food can be iffy but you're at applebees. Get what you pay for. Some times it's great. I love it. Shots!
Bob M.,"Carrollton, TX",1141,201,156,2.0,7/21/2010,"We end up going to this Applebees about once a quarter and we also say afterwards that we won't do it again.  Tonight proved it again.  Salads were delivered after the meal, staff was inattentive, drinks were left empty for 10 minutes while the waitress was talking to the bartender.  The manager did come by and apologized for the salads and took them off our bill but even she didn't see the two obviously empty glasses on the table.  This time we mean it.  We won't be back."
Bryan S.,"Dallas, TX",139,285,101,3.0,10/20/2010,"Half price appetizers after 11:00pm and 2 for $20 deals you on a select menu the deals at this establishment comes pretty decent for sit in diner. I give it a 4 star simply because as an consumer who comes in regularly, most of the staff give you the special treatment as you were family or close friends and that is hard to come by  nowadays in the restaurant business, especially with the economy downturn."
