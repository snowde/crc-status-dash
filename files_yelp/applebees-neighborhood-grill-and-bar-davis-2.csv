Gene B.,"East Bay, CA",251,648,993,3.0,10/18/2017,"Had dinner at Applebee's due to the fact we were lodging next door. We had a few rounds of Patron Perfect Margaritas, appetizers, and a hot skillet plate. I was quite impress how our bartender waited on us while she worked the bar. It's obvious they are understaffed, but it did not significantly impact the quality of our service. Not a spot to be picky, but definitely a place for drinks."
Tara V.,"Sacramento, CA",80,23,19,2.0,12/18/2017,"I am bummed! The management will not allow me, (or you), to use the YELP! Check-in offer...sad. But I'm enjoying a $1 LIT while my phone charges! That's good, right? Maybe I'll try food when I'm hungry."
Luke C.,"Davis, CA",288,229,1034,3.0,6/26/2017,"Applebee's can be a really mixed bag. I've been here and have had a very satisfactory meal that I enjoyed quite a bit, and at other times it has been a total failure. But overall my experience has been positive. When the meal isn't very good, it's because the food is too salty when done incorrectly.  If you're going to Applebee's, I'd recommend the two for $20 or two for $25 deal. It's a great deal! You get an appetizer and two entrees. The appetizer is full size and is a great way to start a meal. The selection that you can get is nice. I usually get either the boneless wings or spinach & artichoke dip and chips. (Hint: You can refill the chips, just ask!) As for the entrees, I really enjoy the ribs and mini ribs. They have a variety of flavors to choose from, and this is what they are known for. Some dishes, like the hamburger, come with way less food and will feel like a rip off. Don't go that route! One good thing just about every visit to Applebee's is the service. I don't think there was a time when the waitress wasn't very good. Tonight we had a server named Heaven. She was as good as her namesake. I think Applebee's is worth the visit if you order the right things. It's definitely not the best, but it can be a nice place to go every so often!"
Amrutha C.,"Dublin, CA",60,21,37,5.0,3/4/2017,"I have been coming to this Applebee's since 2014 on and off. I have moved to bay area now and whenever I'm crossing over Davis, I make it a point to eat here.  The feel is good. They are open till late. The servers are always nice and the food doesn't let you down. I enjoy eating here vs. other Applebee's locations.  I will be coming back in the future too!"
Joe L.,"Fairfield, CA",0,9,8,1.0,10/21/2017,Quite possibly the worst service and meal I have ever gotten!  Stay away from this dump.  Waited 15 mins to be seated then waited 15 mins to get water.  Got boneless chicken wings and the chicken was raw!  Grossed me out.  Absolutely horrible!
Blue B.,"Glenhaven, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/17/2017,"Walked into this Applebee's and it was fairly quiet, so we assumed the service would be good and fast. However our waitress (Jessica I believe but she had no name tag) was not the nicest, and we watched the other waitress working serve food to other people and get them out the door quicker than our waitress could even bring us our drinks. Our waitress was not the most hospitable person, and when asking for more chips replied with ""you can finish those before I bring you more"", after that comment our attitude changed to not being as bright. When we did receive the food it was all cold, all three steaks, the sides and the burger order. We sent our food back and the manager came back and took care of us. Our steaks were bigger but still the same temp. Everything else was good. Our waitress never came back to check on us, and she took so long so we paid over the automated pay system. Very happy to have the manager come and resolve the food issue with a better attitude however, still disappointed in the disrespectful waitress. Will not be coming back on my way through. Don't even want to give one star!"
Jessica l.,"Newark, CA",0,35,4,5.0,8/25/2017,"WHAT 2.5 STARS? Those yelpers must have never had Katie as a bartender. She is very kind and can make a great long island for me. Ever since the new menu, Applebees has been using a weak premix but she can make it like the goodness it was before."
Brens S.,"Winters, CA",6,42,24,1.0,12/21/2016,"Bought a $5 ""bowl"" of chicken tortilla soup and barely received enough to fill a measuring cup. Was hoping the flavor would make up for the poor serving size but it's really nothing to write home about. The same soup from Safeway had more flavor and the price was much better. Sorry Applebee's, I tried. The curb side dude was really nice though so he gets the star."
Cindy C.,"San Mateo, CA",410,450,3439,3.0,3/14/2016,"Came here once for a friend's birthday. Food was good. Staff was nice. Very accommodating for our huge party. Drinks were decent and came out fairly quick. Food took forever though... Plenty of parking which is always nice. All in all, not bad."
Ellie R.,"Santa Monica, CA",458,10,,4.0,2/27/2017,I always enjoy going to Applebee's. It is never too busy and the staff is very attentive. The prices are great for the quality of food
E T.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,47,8,4.0,6/18/2017,Great service and good food. Would recommend this facility. Delicious desserts! Would return.
Jane R.,"San Andreas, CA",0,9,1,4.0,2/27/2017,"We attempted to eat brunch at the Applebee's in Davis yesterday.  This was a surprisingly good experience.  We were greeted and seated by Megan, who advised us of the specials, and informed us that --alas--Applebee's does not serve breakfast, and then proceeded to provide suggestions on all the brunch alternatives (including a brunch burger) so we decided to stay and have lunch instead.  Good decision.  We opted for the Two-for-twenty deal.  The food was very good--though we did have to send the burger back for a little more heat--but everyone was gracious and the service was good.  If you are looking for a fast, well-prepared meal served by nice, attentive servers, this is the place.   Thanks Megan!"
Jessie P.,"Reno, NV",112,1,,5.0,2/27/2017,This place is pretty good normally but this time around is was amazing frm the beginning to the end! We got greeted by such a warm and friendly host her name was Megan! She opened the door and instantly her smile and amazing attitude turned my day around! Thanks Megan wish there was more people like u out there in the food service industry makes going out with it!
Corine C.,"Benicia, CA",211,202,2162,3.0,1/20/2016,"Nice and pleasant vibe on a Friday night.  Our server, Meghan, was friendly and attentive.  She made sure we had everything we needed.   Dishes were ok.  Plenty of chicken entrees, a few steaks, hardly any fish or seafood.  Don't expect a variety of Ben with bar food. Our steaks were a bit tough and done even when we asked medium rare.  Sides were fine."
M D.,"Davis, CA",41,15,,3.0,5/26/2017,"Slowest service I have ever received in my life. The server did not have many tables and proceeded to help new tables while we were still waiting for Togo boxes and our check and what not. A total of 2 and a half hours there, majority of it waiting. Drinks took forever as well. 3 stars because I like coming here after work but seriously, servers need to step it up and move a little faster."
Justin G.,"Davis, CA",4,42,8,1.0,1/30/2017,"Why are you reading reviews of Applebees on Yelp?  Are you really thinking of going here?  This location is super inconvenient and totally dead and the employees are of the stand-around-bullshitting-louder-than-the-terrible-pop-music type.  The ingredients are equivalent to prison food, no matter what arrangement they put them in or what HFCS syrup sauce they smother over everything."
Javier G.,"Davis, CA",77,3,,5.0,8/11/2017,"We love coming to this location. There aren't long waits like other Applebee's and its a relaxing environment with fewer people. The waiters and bartenders are the friendliest ones ever. We always get the 2 for $20/25 and the steak is pretty delcious and good. We love getting their boneless buffalo wings, they're always dripping with sauce! Good place to go from the usual crowded, overrated spots in Davis."
Susan J.,"Yreka, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/3/2017,"Great burgers and fries....had the classic burger with Swiss...had a drink.called ""coconut breeze"".. Very tasty...within walking distance of my hotel and because of where I am staying and asked the deskclerk where he recommended, I got a free dessert."
Aiyanajv ..,"Roosevelt, Fresno, CA",1,3,,1.0,5/15/2017,"Went in for my daughter's 7th birthday. It was eerily quiet and dead for a Saturday night...  Sat down anyway, the service was OK, wait time for drinks was slow considering there were very few people in there. Food came at a decent time though. We told the waitress it was my daughter's birthday and she said OK..  We were expecting a little song or some sort of happy birthday rendition. But instead, the waitress came and nonchalantly threw the ice cream in front of my daughter, and monotoneously said ""happy birthday,"" turned and left.  We were a little surprised, since every restaurant we've ever been to at least sang something, clapped something, or at least made the birthday person feel a little special. I highly recommend people visit the Fresno Applebees on Shaw near Clovis Ave on their birthday!  So enthusiastic, loud, and even made my little girl blush because it gets the whole restaurants attention.  Our whole section began to clap along with the singers. Even the manager was there clapping along with all the servers! So yes, if you want a quiet night with below average service come to the Davis Applebees,  but do not come to celebrate any sort of special occasion.."
Dani R.,"Davis, CA",13,12,11,2.0,2/19/2017,"Pretty bad.  I had the classic combo appetizer and the quesadillas and spinach dip were bland and tasteless. Gotta at the very least salt your food, Applebee's."
Jeanne C.,"San Francisco, CA",49,107,133,5.0,10/5/2016,"Why the bad reviews? I received great service on a Tuesday night, it was fast and friendly. Sucks that I forgot the server's name though. I had the crispy brewhouse chicken, which was average but filling. Also, my friends and I shared the 2/$9.99 appetizers which were awesome. The portions were really generous considering the price and it being sample sized. This particular Applebee's is the best Applebee's that I've ever been to."
Megan C.,"Marysville, CA",60,11,10,5.0,2/18/2017,Graet service and wonderful food! Got a cheeseburger and is was perfectly cooked! Fries were hot and pepsi was cold and crisp! Thanks Applebee's! We will be back!
Riki S.,"Ewa Beach, HI",43,10,6,1.0,1/3/2017,Got their best steak a 12 ounce it says its the grade A stake nope it was a grade D asked for med rare got mid welldone garlic mashed potatoes not really garlicky also got the garlic string beans you're very rubbery my friend ordered a salad we said we sat and watched it for 30 minutes on the line and still didn't get it till the end we canceled it and as apologies for bad service they gave us $5 off the next time we come and very bad customer service  the only thing right was some other waitresses kept bring water and his ice tea
Michelle M.,"Davis, CA",790,37,75,2.0,8/24/2015,"Applebee's is the definition of ""meh"" because it's seriously whatever... I feel like I come here just to get a change of scenery whenever I hang out with friends and we just want something to eat or drink.  I shared an entree with my friend last night and it was seriously the saddest looking plate I've ever seen! I think the reason why it was so upsetting was because it was $10 and if I had known it was going to look so sad I would've just stuck to a burger or something.  I usually share a 2 for $20 which usually never fails me because you can't go wrong with the spinach dip or mozzarella sticks and the chick penne pasta, but those are no brainers that any restaurant could make if they really wanted to. They have happy hour specials depending on which day you go to so it's cool if you want to get a cheap drink.  I like their personal paying machine that they have at each table because it makes paying for groups less complicated. I will say service is a little lack luster and it varies on each visit. I guess I'm rating it 2 stars because even though this is a chain restaurant there should at least be more effort from their staff and food. I'm probably gonna come here again some random day just because.. Meh."
Keith R.,"Davis, CA",21,712,2,2.0,6/2/2016,"HAVE AGAIN: the spinach dip, salsa and chips was enjoyable and good. Good service. NOT HAVE AGAIN: the all-American burger with built-in bacon bits and American cheese was not very good."
Sherrell R.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/27/2017,"The experience we had today at the Davis Applebee's was awful. One of my fellow diners ordered one of their get two menu options - a cup of onion soup and a half-salad of some sort with chicken. She got her cup of soup, but then received a full-sized salad of the wrong type with steak instead of chicken and the wrong dressing. Their attempt to rectify the mistake was bring out some chicken for her to put on the wrong salad with the wrong dressing. She was charged for a full meal salad, a bowl of soup and a side salad. Another companion never got the side salad she ordered, even though she was charged for it. It took the manager 25 minutes to rectify the bill. Unbelievable."
Meghan H.,"Rio Linda, CA",97,9,1,1.0,8/25/2016,Currently waiting for my car side to go order that was supposed to be ready 18 min ago. Had to come inside to see what was going on. Don't have a pick up time if it won't be ready at that time. Horrible service.
Jonathan A.,"Vacaville, CA",660,67,162,2.0,8/23/2015,"Before the last visit, I would have given this place at least a 3. But the fact that they have such a thing on the menu that is literally a waste of my money, it costed this place a star. So let's start with the good... I really like their 2 for $20 deal, it's an easy college student kind of deal. I usually get full off of it. I recommend the burger, it's actually pretty good! I also recommend the 3-cheese penne. It's worth it! On top of it, you can also get an appetizer to split between the two of you. Anyways to the bad. The last time I came here, I decided to get something off the menu other than the 2 for $20 deal and ended up choosing the fiesta lime chicken. For $10.99 I expected to get full off of it. Instead, it was a skimpy plate of half a chicken breast and what was supposed to be quinoa was actually rice with like a tablespoon of quinoa sprinkled throughout... Such a rip off and false advertising! Meh. This should be your last resort restaurant to go to in Davis..."
Mike K.,"Auburn, CA",8,2,,4.0,7/5/2017,I was meeting a business associate there for lunch. When I pulled up I checked hours on Yelp and saw a very poor review. I must disagree with the poor review. The service was excellent and the manager stopped by twice to make sure we had everything we needed. Prices were fair and the food was good.
Destinee J.,"Bismarck, ND",91,2,,5.0,6/30/2016,French onion soup was really good. Steaks flavorful and cooked correctly. Maple pecan mashed sweet potatoes were actually pretty good. Our waitress was on top of it! One of the first really good Applebee locations I've tried!
Jenn S.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",15,56,14,1.0,2/11/2016,"Came here for lunch had chips and salsa (they served marinara sauce) and a Thai shrimp salad. The salad comes in a huge bowl, however the salad if you were to measure it out was about a cup worth.... For $12! I'm very disappointed!  When I asked for salsa the waiter seemed surprised... I said this is marinara.?!?! My total bill was $40 for 2 salads, and iced tea and chips and marinara. :-/  I won't be back. To an Applebee's. Ever."
Wayne S.,"Ellensburg, WA",24,3,,5.0,8/31/2016,The bourbon chicken and shrimp was exellent as well as the service. Our server Brennan was very attendive to our needs. He saw I was looking for a place to charge my phone and took care of it.
Brianna N.,"Davis, CA",23,1,,1.0,11/9/2016,"So my sister and I decided to go here for dinner tonight and we were greeted right away by the hostess and sat at the bar table which we requested. We sat there for 10 to 15 minutes and NOONE had come up to us, they weren't that busy. A couple who was seated in the booth behind us were already being served. I was pretty pissed at this point so I went ahead and ordered our drinks, appetizer and entrees on the monitor hoping that would alert someone's attention about 5 to 10 minutes later ""our server"" came over and asked if she could get us drinks and I told her I already ordered everything on the monitor. It took the bartender 15 mins to make my drink from the time I put it into the monitor. I looked over to see why she was taking so long. She was measuring all of the contents out for each drink she was making, do they not train bartenders to do counts here??? So our appetizer comes to our table, we got salsa Verde beef nachos with no jalapeños and it comes out with just cheese and meat so I had to send it back. 10 mins after we finish our nachos ""our server"" comes over and ask if we wanted anything else and we both were like we put in entrees and she says ""oh I didn't see that on the monitor"" leaves to go to the kitchen and comes out a few mins later with our food and it taste like it's been sitting under the heat lamps, my sister asked for no jalapeños on her burger and it had them on there, she mumbled under her breath about it and she heard her and asked if everything was okay, so my sister said well I asked for no jalapeños and the server argues with her saying the pico comes with jalapeño and asked if she wanted it taken back but we were already frustrated so she said no. Our server never came to check to see if our food was good, I was suprised to get a water refill after it had been sitting there. We ordered dessert from the MONITOR because our server was nowhere to be found and that suprisingly came out at a descent time. At the end she gives us our spit bill but I didn't bother to wait for her to come by and pick up our bill, so we payed on the monitor. I have never received service this bad. I've had some not so great service but nothing like this. I work in a restaurant as a server/bartender and I wouldn't have a job if this was the type of service I gave. Management here needs to retrain their crew because this is ridiculous. Also I would like to add to the fact that all the servers here tonight spent more time back in the kitchen than out on the floor attending to their customers. I won't be back here again"
B.J. K.,"Davis, CA",26,45,,2.0,8/24/2016,Service is worst then slow.  Employees are somewhat freindly.  I am actually surprised that this place is still open.
Miami R.,"West Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/13/2017,"Place had only a couple tables of people and after waiting awhile, we finally get seated, waited 15 mins with menus to recieve no service, so we walked out and going to find another place to eat. Our waiter with the ""mustache"" was too busy playing funky finger with the guy at the bar."
Mary H.,"West Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/13/2017,We waited 5 mins to get seated and sat around for another 20 mins for no service...waste of time..suckssss
Elizabeth E.,"Sacramento, CA",96,50,4,4.0,5/6/2015,"I don't know where all the bad reviews come from....I've been there 3 times now and I've gotten excellent service which is what my review is for.  The Fireball Whiskey Lemonade?  YUM! To be honest with you, the food at Applebee's has changed these last few years and I agree, it's not as great as the old menu used to be.  It wasn't broken, why change? However, I've had a few good meals here, I've learned to navigate the menu and get what I want.  My sons love it, and as I've said, this location has provided us great service.  I have a service dog and that sometimes presents a seating challenge, but never here. Maybe we've just gotten lucky, but we love this place.  :-)"
Lenny H.,"Lafayette, CA",68,91,,3.0,10/18/2015,"Always fun to go to Applebee's because all the servers are especially cute (Lysander is adorable, for example) and for the great atmosphere. Food is just OK.  Have gone twice and plan to go back."
Iheartwatches N.,"Esparto, CA",70,72,128,4.0,11/29/2014,"I've been here three times and all times my meals are tasty and hot with the tall $5.95 draft beers being cold. Two months ago the company promoted the all you can eat cross cut ribs deal. It was good and filling that I stopped after 2 servings.  Today I had the classic American burger with bottomless fries for $9.99. It was fine if you didn't mind NOT having lettuce, tomatoes, or red onions with your burger. The beef patty was well done and it was drenched with a worsheshire type sauce. It was not messy but like a tasty basic burger off the grill. In the three times I've eaten at this Applebees within 2 months it seems like most of the servers working the same shift will help one another by bringinng out food to tables. All servers I encountered were polite and not overwhelming with gift card purchase or dessert. Can't wait til next time so I can try out the happy hour specials."
Dan W.,"Roseville, CA",542,527,39,1.0,7/5/2014,"No, just............no Overpriced, oversalted food with the sole goal of having one spend more money on crappy overpriced drinks at the bar is their business model. As I am particuarly fond of neither (just give me a good shot of whiskey any day over anything sweet tasting from any bar), this is a waste of money for me. Put it this way....if you must go to a cruddy American-style food chain, save your money and head to Denny's ot McDonald's. Of all the chains to have moved into Davis to expand our food choices, we had to get IHOP and Applebee's??!!?!?!? Davis, at times, is severely lacking in the culinary delight department"
