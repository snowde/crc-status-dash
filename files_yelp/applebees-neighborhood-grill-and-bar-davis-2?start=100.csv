Rea C.,"San Jose, CA",2,24,1,2.0,5/10/2011,"Food is always somewhere between okay and good. Nothing that ""stands out"" I was going to give it 3 stars, but I decided to give it 2 because of a rude hostess. I came here with my friends and found out a big group of other friends (~20) decided to eat at AppleBees too. We were discussing amongst our group whether we wanted to eat with the big group or not. We were going to tell the hostess that we didn't care where we were seated, but she seated us at a table near the big group and gave us an grumpy attitude saying, ""NEXT TIME, figure out ahead of time how many people will be in your group BEFORE coming here.""  The next time I went to AppleBees, again we got the same hostess. I don't remember her doing anything too rude like the last time, but she was still rude. A message to AppleBees: Fire her and get a new hostess. I would prefer to start off my meals pleasantly, not with a rude b*tch."
Marlon T.,"Reno, NV",1083,2364,1516,2.0,1/8/2009,"Applebee's is overpriced. The inside is nice. The workers are usually nice but I've experienced some neglectful workers. The food is usually good too but not the best or anything I would come back for. I've came here more than once but only because someone chose it for their birthday or whatever. I don't know why they would choose Applebee's. The food is never bad. If you want to spend some money and eat decent food, come to Applebee's! I think I'd rather to go to IHOP down the street."
Vicky L.,"Fremont, CA",98,52,14,3.0,4/24/2011,"Like many others, we went for the happy hour appetizers and drinks. I wish I had gotten our waitress's name, because she was SUPER nice, THOUGHTFUL, and just a good waitress in general. I'm sure her name started with an S or something.  So why the 3 stars? Some of the appetizers were NOT worth even the $5 happy hour price: the Dynamite Shrimp and a beef mini burritos something or other. The alcohol being half off seemed to mean that you get half the alcohol. I tried a Raspberry Long Island Iced Tea for the first time and it literally just tasted like Raspberry Iced Tea. Sad. Anyway, if you go with a group and share a Spinach and Artichoke dip, it's really worth it. They just keep bringing chips and more salsa. It's great! Doesn't feel too good for your heart afterwards, but if you're really craving something late at night and don't want to spend too much money, go to Applebee's."
Rip off R.,"Sacramento, CA",0,10,,2.0,8/24/2013,Went in for dinner with family every thing was fine with service such.  My only complaint was that my brother and my self ordered the 7 oz sirloin blackened from the take two menu.   These steaks are pretty much inedible.  I tried to cut a bite and kept sawing and sawing on the meat.  There was so much gristle that some parts of the steak could not be cut.  This steak was ordered medium rare too.    When I finally found a small part that I could cut through I took a bite and wow it was just pure salt.   So much salt that I had to stop eating and give up on this.   I asked the server if they had made a error in the kitchen and she did not know but later stopped by and said that yes there is a lot of salt on these steaks.  Both my brother and my self left most of the steak on the plate and left very disappointed and hungry.
Melissa B.,"Davis, CA",40,108,34,3.0,2/19/2013,"Applebee's is great if you want a fast, pretty cheap meal with pretty cheap drinks. I especially like their happy hour deals with appetizer specials. The location in Davis has a friendly staff and there are events like bingo and trivia going on several nights each week."
Veronica S.,"Seattle, WA",272,1430,324,4.0,3/16/2008,"Typical Applebee's chain although if you sit at the bar I think the two guys that were managing it were far superior in service than the Applebee's in Vacaville. Good service, good junky American bar food, good location for Davis (next to the freeway)."
Chrissy G.,"Sacramento, CA",3,20,4,1.0,4/18/2013,"I have had better.  Ordered the steak and it was very tasty for the place.  But the waiter had no idea what came with it, so that was disappointing, it came with potato wedges and he thought it came with mash.   He didn't try to make up for it or offer a different side.  Once we were done, he gave us the bill.  We probably sat there for about 45 minutes after eating  and he never returned to offer more water or even desert.  Which we wanted to order.  The servers aren't too friendly, he never came to check if the food was to our liking. Never came back for water refills.... I used to be a server and I know what good service is.  they really need to educate the servers.  For this reason, I will not return.   Bad service in a not too busy restaurant.  makes you wonder."
Charla A.,"Sacramento, CA",564,240,92,3.0,9/28/2010,"Applebees, shmapplebees. I'd only come here for happy hour and during bingo night. Positives: - $1 jello shots, even though they're freakin liquidy once you get them. i  - the margarita's are delicious (i suggest kiwi) - spinach & artichoke dip. - MONDAY NIGHT BINGO!!! Negatives: - Out of the million times i've been here, i've only had one good waitress. come onnnn... - riblet basket is a ribBONE basket. can i get some meat with my bonez! s'aight."
Nick B.,"Davis, CA",1,19,1,2.0,3/22/2013,Food is average...but the service is horrible! Been in this town 15 years and I've only eaten here 4 times and am giving up.
Rachel L.,"Cupertino, CA",40,72,10,3.0,12/3/2010,"Applebee's is such a great place for groups to have a good time in Davis.  I usually come here for the half off appetizers and it's disappointing but the portions have gotten significantly smaller over the last two years.   My favorite appetizers have to be the boneless buffalo wings- great buffalo sauce, nice and spicy and pretty good portions for the half off price.  My other favorite are the nachos.  They used to be way bigger in the portions but it's still a pretty solid appetizer for sharing. The last time I came here was for dinner with a fairly large group.  The servers here are champs, considering our group has 60 people and we came all at once.  They were very patient and brought our food out in a very timely manner. We decided among six people to get the 2 for 20 meal which comes with 1 appetizer and two entrees- a super good deal.  The appetizers are definitely better than the entrees.  I ordered the ravioli and it was way too creamy and the insides of the ravioli seemed pretty bare.  The short ribs were really good and overall it was just a good deal- hard to pass up for a group of college students. Good memories at Applebees : )"
Hans W.,"Berlin, Germany",0,20,,2.0,4/5/2011,"Typically Diner. Nothing special.  They didn't ask me how I want my steak. I was glad it was medium, but usually you should get the decision.  The prices are not reasonable with the size of the dishes.  The service is alright."
Justin N.,"San Francisco, CA",537,161,3,2.0,9/15/2010,"this place is just a poor man's dive....and doesn't even have a wow factor. The only saving grace is the cheapness of appetizers late at night. i had the riblet basket and it was just decent. The meat wasn't fall off the bone, but it was tender. The fries were alrite i've had better and the ketchup bottle was near empty. Just a place to go when your hungry late at night in davis..no more no less"
Michele C.,"Millbrae, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/5/2013,"There was a tooth found on the windowsill and the manager refused to compensate any of our meal or give us a free dessert. Another member of our party found a hair in her food, again nothing from the manager. However, our waitress Jennifer was awesome,  given our large party n being a new hire."
Pat M.,"Davis, CA",6,2,,5.0,12/8/2012,"I love this restaurant.   The staff is ready to accommodate any dietary concern.  Gary and Zoe really make you feel at home as do the rest of the team members.   The food is very solid, lots of TV's to satisfy your sports addictions and the beer is really cold."
Ally S.,"Davis, CA",1,2,,1.0,12/2/2011,"So I went here tonight with my boyfriend and roommate. The place was packed so it took 2 hours to get our food. This would normally be fine, however the waiter did not seem to care at all. First,  He spilled an entire glass of water on my roommate. Then it took him over 20 minutes to get her a towel to wipe herself and the table off. Then the food came out overcooked and lacking in flavor. The waiter maybe stopped by our table once in the 2 hours to ask if we wanted anything. Then when we tried to talk to management, she said there was nothing she could do. FINALLY when we got home, we were best friends with the toilet for the rest of the night. Methinks not indeed."
Ping W.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,16,,2.0,7/21/2013,"good position, but it is soooo slow, we wait 1 hour for our food and the restaurant is not full at all. And all the stake are well done not medium  rare."
Richard P.,"San Jose, CA",3,250,,3.0,10/7/2011,"Richard Pro here with another review. I'm not the hugest fan of American restaurants, so let's get down to it. I've been to Applebee's twice, both times late at night when I was extremely hungry. Very memorable experiences both times because I was absolutely starving and had a very long day. I've discovered pasta is a safety at American restaurants--it's very hard to screw up. I enjoy the three cheese chicken penne here. Is it amazing? No. Portions are too small for me, and for $14 it's rather disappointing. The garlic bread is a disgrace--feels like it's slathered with a type of cantonese sauce called sa cha jiang. What other options are there besides pasta? Oh, the usual burgers, steak, fries, artichoke dip, etc. Appetizers are a rip off, but they're a rip off everywhere. How are your fries and steak and whatever? Typical. Very, very typical. Go for the pasta. However boring it is, it's decent pasta and I enjoy it more than I would a burger.  At American restaurants, service seems to be the priority over taste, so that's what I usually enjoy for the price I pay. By no means is this great food; however, the interior is nice, service is nice, lighting is nice, so it's okay. One of the better American restaurants of the thousands out there. I would never come here by choice or willingly though...the food just doesn't have that appeal. When I'm hungry, I want to eat. 3 stars, and I'm being nice here. If I were to be mean I'd give this place 1 star because it's not worth it and it doesnt give me a happy food feeling. When you want to eat something that makes you relax and makes your tiring day go away, you want to go to your special 5 star restaurant, and Applebee's isn't it for me."
Mansfield K.,"San Carlos, CA",414,24,3,4.0,8/2/2012,"I've heard from many people that enjoy Applebee's food, but, now, I can personally vouch for them. We ordered the sampler platter and tortilla soup at a stop at the restaurant on our way to Tahoe for a week, and the food was great.  Compared the boneless hotwings to the ones I ate the Texas Road house in Union City, Applebee's are better, though, I enjoy TRH as well. You should definitely stop here to eat."
Evelyn J.,"Davis, CA",3,30,33,5.0,6/23/2012,"We were so happy with the service here at Davis Applebees.  We were greeted, seated, served, tended to so wonderfully by the staff.  All this great service on a Friday and Grad night  at that.  Our server Natalie (if I'm wrong I apologise) . Well the young lady who patiently took our orders was amazing! She saw to it that our hungry party was taken care of. The food came quickly and just perfect. Appetizers were awesome tasty and half off!!!  Ordered 2 of the sampler platter. Very tasty.  I'm salivating just thinking about it. Our main course came timely and everyone enjoyed the food. We will definitely come back, soon! Thank you guys at Applebees for making my daughter's grad night dinner a wonderful experience."
Marin C.,"Traverse City, MI",71,1159,175,3.0,2/8/2012,"Enjoyed the yummy maple blondie for dessert this evening!  Delicious!  Too many calories, I really shouldn't have looked, alas.  But, long as it isn't too often, whatever. Life is short, eat dessert first...at least I think that is how the saying goes!"
