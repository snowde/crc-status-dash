Archie G.,"San Jose, CA",1116,1026,42,1.0,1/13/2009,"When it comes to chains, Applebee's is about as bad as it gets. The first time I ever tried it was in Davis, where my meal tasted as if it just came out of the microwave. I was dragged here many times by friends, but each time, no matter what I ordered, the food was uninspired, not fresh, and overpriced. Basura!"
Ans T.,"Sacramento, CA",43,12,3,3.0,5/9/2012,Stopped by here...while waiting for my car to be done next door. Grabbed a quick bite to eat nothing to exciting. The food was okay... I was at the bar and the bartender was engaging. It was pretty much dead while i was there. I would stop by if I was in the area if nothing else was open...
Lorna L.,"Brush Prairie, WA",0,14,,1.0,5/1/2015,"Unfortunately, I have been less than impressed with Applebees the last couple of times I have eaten at this chain - and the Davis location was no exception.  At this point, I would only eat there if there was no other choice.  The food tastes like it came out of a can and they are very skimpy on their ingredients.  I ordered the tomato basil soup (which tasted like it came straight out of a Progresso can) and the shrimp linguine - there was very few shrimp or vegetables in the linguine and it was very salty.  It seems that they are trying to cut corners to save money...and it shows.  Totally disappointing...  Unfortunately, I don't think the mediocrity is specific to this particular location.  I was here on business and asked the waitress for an itemized receipt - I got one but only discovered later that it was just the credit card receipt - which is useless for getting reimbursed by most companies.  Just one more hassle to deal with..."
Brian C.,"Cupertino, CA",287,157,21,4.0,11/17/2008,"Haha, even though the food is alrighttt...(I'd give it 3 stars, for food) AppleBee's you've given me too many memories. Come here after 9 for half off appetizers (except for the sample platter). I won't describe too much but here's the choices: Nachos: Big big plate of nachos, for 2-3 people (japalenos, sour cream, that taco beef, refried beens, and a little bit of tomatoes) Buffalo Wings and Barbeque Wings: Yes, good stuff...we all know what this tastes like.  They are usually good on seating, even with a huge party, you can ask to dine at their patio. Service is not a tad too bad either. So if nobody can make decisions, and you don't want to eat luxurious, but instead want something simple, come here!"
Razza M.,"Sacramento, CA",47,241,6,1.0,7/25/2011,"Service hah, I cant tell you how sad it is to see your server mooching over single guys while you wait for service. I dont need this."
Ana C.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,,3.0,4/7/2011,"I like Apple Bees, but I have to say the service here was very slow.  I asked for a Nutritional Guide and the servers looked at me like I had asked for them to produce an alien. One server asked another and then another, before they came back to inform me they did not have one. (which I think they are required to have now upon request)  The restaurant was very empty but still had about 4 servers, a host and a bartender yet, getting a refill or boxes at the end was almost impossible. Other than the slow service we received the restaurant was clean and the food was hot."
Debbie R.,"Davis, CA",33,4,,3.0,2/9/2013,Applebee's really needs to examine it's menu to add more VEGETARIAN choices.  I have money to spend on eating out and Applebee's is really missing the boat by not offering healthy vegetarian dishes.
Anna T.,"Stockton, CA",25,5,,1.0,10/10/2010,"Came here last night after the huge corn maze in Dixon. Came to Applebees because In N Out was way to packed and we were too hungry to drive back to Stockton. I actually wish we drove back to Stockton because we would have had way better service than here! The Good - 2 for $20 deals, $6 pitchers, $4 Mucho Margaritas. That's about it. The Bad - Horrible service!!! The worst I've ever had. Our drink order was taken very fast and arrived in a timely order, but then maybe half way down my Mucho Margarita we finally got someone to take our food order (after many waitresses passed us and the manager). The food probably took another good 45 minutes to an hour. Plus my steak was not medium WELL, it was medium RARE, but I decided not to argue, I'll eat it anyway. My Financee's riblet basket was cold to touch. My brother's and his gf's food looked decent. After we were done we asked for boxes to go then had to wait again for our waitress to give us our tab. A good 30 minutes passed by for us to flag down our waitress to pay by debit card. We were seriously thinking that we shouldn't have paid at all! Plus to make the night even worse was that there was this creepy older man who was fairly drunk going around and acting like he worked there and talking to everybody! Never again Davis!"
Mo K.,"Walnut Creek, CA",3,36,10,3.0,8/4/2011,I came here because I won a gift card at a company event and figured I'd grab a quick bite.  Ordered the Sizzling Asian Shrimp and a Long Island.  The shrimp was way too greasy and the drink was really watered down.  Service was great and I'll probably go back (few bucks left on the card) but I think I'll just stick to the artichoke dip next time.
Adam D.,"Sacramento, CA",17,148,12,4.0,2/5/2009,"Excellent happy hour from 9 pm till close.   $3.25 giant beers (Miller/Bud/Coors)  VERY COLD!!!. Neil, the Bartender, seems to have been there for years and provides excellent service."
Tim M.,"Merced, CA",92,111,2,2.0,2/6/2011,Calories now listed. Don't eat here if you don't wish for a quick 5 lbs.  Food tasted like pure salt.  I love salt so that says something.  Convenient to freeway and inn's
Steff L.,"Sacramento, CA",31,158,17,3.0,4/13/2007,"You know what's torture.  Going to Applebee's on a Friday night, during Lent, and everyone around you is ordering steak.  Why people??  The curse of being a Catholic.  I'm never going to go there on a Friday night again. Place is like any other Applebee's.  Food is mediocre, and the crowd is eh.  I'll go when it's not busy.  Last time we went, there was a group of 25 asians waiting to be seated.  Must be the new hot spot in town with that many people."
Gigi T.,"San Pablo, CA",88,375,288,3.0,6/28/2008,"I frequently visited Applebee's when I used to go to Davis.  I mean, you can't beat the college-affordable grilled sirloin!  Portion is pretty decent too.  They tend to be a bit slow with their service when you eat there. I like to order by phone and pick up.  They have these sections for pick-up with cameras, so when you drive up there, the waiter would bring out your order and you can do all the transaction in the car.  What a cool idea they came up with!"
Mrs. Random S.,"Vacaville, CA",17,5,,1.0,3/15/2012,"I had a horrible experience here with my co-workers this week! It was after the lunch rush for the day so it wasnt busy. The waiter didn't write down our order so when he came back with our food 45 minutes later!!  it was completely wrong. I ordered a half salad and was charged for the full thing, my friend ordered thai tacos and was given a burrito and another ordered Tuscan navy bean soup with no cheese and received tomato soup covered with cheese! When we spoke to the manager about all the mistakes he only offered to give us each 10% off of our individual bills which they taxed us on! So it was a whopping total of  30 cents off! WTF?? Then we said I think you can do better and the manager came back and gave one of us a free drink? Thats it. Overall this place sucks."
Jacques L.,"Davis, CA",22,90,488,4.0,2/2/2013,"Our Friday norm again. Our normal waitress was there and had our drinks ready within several minutes. When I left, she even brought me a water to go with a lemon. Giving 4 stars for the service; even with the prior 3 stars for food."
Jeff I.,"San Pablo, CA",2,66,,3.0,8/7/2007,"I like Applebees, but for some reason going here makes me sad in a bit. I always feel like either I'm rushed or slowed down a lot by the wait staff. Granted when I go here it's during dinner when it's crowded or lunchtime. Food is good, though if you go a lot, you have little to select from. Otherwise overall this place is solid really. Maybe next time I'll just do curbside to go!"
Cody J.,"Davis, CA",0,20,,1.0,1/12/2014,"We really want to see businesses succeed in Davis, most come and go and we were happy to see this Applebees locate in Davis.  However, we've had dinner 3 times and each time has been a poor experience and we won't be wasting our time/money any more.  The service is painfully slow.  Tonight we entered the door and waited, and waited, and finally sat ourselves in a booth.  Most of the booths had not been cleaned but we found one that was.  The restaurant was not busy (we now know why!) so there wasn't any excuse for the poor reception.  We finally had a waiter come to our table and took our drink order and then waited, and waited, and finally went to the bartender to try and get a couple cups of coffee.  when we finally got coffee it was barely warm (we gave up on the coffee).  My wife had the Asian chicken salad and I (based on past experience) passed on the entrees and just ordered  a dessert.  We waited and waited and waited and finally got the items and to make a long story short my wife ate the chicken from the salad and left the rest and I ate the ice cream and left the rest of the dessert.  So with poor service and poor food there's not much to say that's good about this store.  It's a shame because we need the variety here in town.  I doubt this store will be open very much longer."
Alison N.,"San Francisco, CA",250,245,15,4.0,3/13/2008,"I liked it. Cute restaurant. Went with one friend while visiting her at school...wait wasn't long at all, probably would have been if we had more people though... I got the cajun seasoned?? steak with caesar salad and mashed potatoes. The seasonings on the steak tasted interesting. Mushrooms were good, but the flavoring was like hints of something odd. REALLLY small salad with too many croutons. The mashed potatoes OMGGG soo good, excelllent!!  For dessert, I had this chocolate cake thing with ice cream? REALLY good, but the cake was too chocolaty...too bad. I really wanted a pazookie-like thing, but ughhh. Better try next time, Applebee's."
Hoa Q.,"Santa Clara, CA",47,404,,3.0,7/10/2007,"This is not the place to go on your one-hour lunch break.  It takes forever to get your originally frozen food, twice forever to get your waitress's attention for the bill, and another forever to get the bill.  My one-hour lunch turned into two-hours with most of it waiting for the dang bill to come.  This wasn't the first time, either.  Among the other times, my table was ignored because we weren't as hot as the ""cute"" girls a couple tables down.  Ugh.  I'd give this place less stars, but the food is actually yummy most of the times. Should you end up here, appetizers are half off after 9PM."
linda c.,"Davis, CA",1,65,4,2.0,3/16/2008,"03/23/08 edit. Service wasn't the greatest. Our waitress was not attentive at all. Drinks were wrong. No plates were given for the apps. The chicken was burnt dry. The blue cheese wasn't put on the side (but gave an extra side of cheese! is that some kind of joke)...and the steak did not come with the grilled onions that were asked. It was a second disappointing experience. _______________ The tables were dirty but once seated the host promised it to be cleaned.  The service was friendly but slowwww! It took some time to order, the drinks to get to the table, and the food. The food overall was okay for an Applebee's."
