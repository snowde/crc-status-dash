Olivia L.,"San Francisco, CA",56,3,,1.0,3/6/2011,"I've been here twice. Both times, they overcooked my steak and the food was just too salty. I ordered medium rare and rare for my steak and they gave me well done! I also ordered a parmesan shrimp topping because I thought the steak wouldn't have any flavor, but it was SO SALTY even without the topping. The veggies were not fresh and were extremely salty too. It's so sad that I learned my lesson after two bad experiences here...The waiters were nice though, I guess that's the only reason i give them a 1 star. I mean..since I can't give them zero stars."
Ang B.,"Berkeley, CA",7,67,6,2.0,5/3/2010,"I used to frequent here, when I lived across the street.It has nostalgic value for me. I also like the fact that they have a Weight Watchers menu, since I'm on that program. Last time I went, however, the service was slow, and there was a hair in my  food. I won't be going back for awhile."
Alice Z.,"San Francisco, CA",215,254,52,4.0,8/3/2009,"My sister took me here after she was done with her classes at UC Davis. I never had applebees so i thought why not? We went here for an early dinner like around 5pm. We had the 2 for $20 deal which is pretty cheap. There was a good variety of entree and appetizers to choose from.  So the deal is you get an appetizer to share and an entree for each person. I chose the Bacon Pit Cheeseburger or something. Don't remember the name exactly. And for appetizer, we chose the artichoke and spinach dip. It comes with chips and salsa. It was pretty filling! The only thing I regretted was probably getting onion rings instead of fries with my burger. There was only 5 onion rings, they were big but it looked so little compared to the fries my sister had! So tip, don't get onion rings as the side! Other than that, all good."
Kristi G.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,5,4,4.0,2/5/2012,"Went in for a 5:30 dinner with a group of 21 and the restaurant was pretty empty.  The staff was very friendly and quickly accomodated for our large party.  Orders were very smooth while preparation was about an hour wait from arrival to serving we were all served together and enjoyed good food.  Most of us shared the 2 for $20 meals and the waitress put all the meals on to separate tabs which was very nice, splitting the costs between 2 and 3 people.  Check out was quick.  The restaurant was clean and nice.  would definitely return"
Alexander T.,"San Diego, CA",11,48,1,2.0,6/18/2009,"Came here on a saturday night and was hungry for some ribs.  Sadly, we went to the wrong place.  I decided to try the riblets and was pretty disappointed.  They were pretty dry and kinda hard to chew.  The best part of the meal was getting a piece of steak from another person's plate.  I say try to look for a better place around the area."
DD K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,1,1.0,12/11/2010,"this place sucks!! slow service, rude staff.

Melanie I.,"Roseville, CA",212,264,6,2.0,8/17/2006,"Applebee's doesn't do it for me. I give it two stars for being clean and kid friendly, but the food is just allright. I don't know why they pack them in every night, except that people here in the burbs like chain restaurants............"
Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",241,979,112,4.0,3/7/2008,"Why such low ratings? The service wasn't bad and neither was the food. The food was pretty decent actually. I had some pretty good shrimp, and a delicious smoothie! Great for groups and this place isn't too crowded, so thats a plus on the wait."
Alice C.,"San Francisco, CA",331,151,142,2.0,12/29/2007,"They sat my boyfriend and me by the back door, even though there were some other tables open. This would've been fine had there not been a party using the outdoor patio that decided to keep the door open over 50% of the time we were there. The waitress we had was also taking care of that big party and ringing up each person with their credit card, so it took forever for management to catch on that they should take care of her other tables as well. 15-20 minutes after seating we finally got our order in. The food itself was fine - that's not where it was lacking. The service was what absolutely killed me, and the sad thing is it wasn't even our waitress' fault.  To me, it was the management who failed to see that she needed help.  We spoke to the manager after who pretty much brushed off our complaints with ""as long as the food was fine"". He tried to offer us free dessert which we turned down - who wanted to sit there in the cold and eat dessert??? And just in case you were curious, we were both wearing jackets and we were still super cold.  I mentioned that there were other tables open when we came in and the manager said ""had there been we would've seated you elsewhere"". I guess I must've been imagining things when I saw the empty tables... Honestly, Applebee's never failed me before when were looking for a place that had a good selection of appetizers and decent food.  This time, the response from the management was the last straw.  I hardly ever will go and complain to management because that's just not my thing - that's just how horrible it was.  The place is probably still fine to go to during their slower times, like some other reviewers have suggested."
Ryan D.,"Nipomo, CA",0,39,,3.0,7/27/2008,"Pretty typical Applebees. This one is no better or no worse than many of the other ones (with the exception of the one in the Arden area which is way worse than normal). The steaks are decent for the price and the boneless hot wings go down very well with a tall glass of beer.  Also, they do have a late night happy hour and are open somewhat late, which is more than what i can say about a lot of other places near my apartment."
D L.,"El Macero, CA",5,32,22,1.0,10/10/2009,"went here on a saturday for dinner, arrived at 6pm and server tried to seat us at bar, but wanted to sit in a booth, and promptly forgot about us. flagged him down to order and he said he'd get someone to take our order i guess he was ""busy"" seems like a lot of the servers and mgmt were ""busy"" here. to summarize took us 30min to get our order and when it came they brought appetizers and entrees all at the same time, really guys?  mgr tried to appease us by saying they'll take the entrees back and bring them back when we're finished with the appetizers. we were hungry and ate the appetizer and weren't impressed smallest driest sliders i ever had. didn't feel assured our entrees would come back unmolested cancelled them and said never again. better places in town you'll get better quality and service at McDonalds. skip it you'll thank me"
dixie a.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,19,,3.0,8/16/2008,I have been to our local Applebee's in Elk Grove several times. The service has been fairly slow but not bad. The employees have always been friendly. The food has been consistently good for the price. I would surely go there again. No complaints!
