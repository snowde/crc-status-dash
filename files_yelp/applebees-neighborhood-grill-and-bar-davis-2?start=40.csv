Jessica H.,"San Jose, CA",173,1,,5.0,10/23/2016,Came in last week for lunch and had Hannah as my server. Some of the best service I've had in a while. Will come back and request her! Food was also good!
Pipo O.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,6,1,1.0,4/18/2016,"Worse service ever. And I love Applebee's , always try to eat at one whenever I come upon it. But this location is the worse. Came in at Sunday afternoon for late lunch. Server took our drinks order. Entry came in before the drinks. And when it was time to refill, I had to go to the mgr to ask for service . And she grudgingly poured it for us. This Applebee's is gonna close for sure. I give it 6 mos."
Brian G.,"Davis, CA",306,184,113,5.0,9/21/2013,"There's a lot of mediocre reviews for this place, but it well exceeded my expectations. The waitress was friendly and well trained. The ambiance was pretty cozy, as there are plenty of booths and tv's to kick back and relax. Their bathrooms were very clean.  We ordered the appetizer platter and the mozzarella sticks & boneless buffalo wings were delicious. For entrees we had the ribs and fiesta chicken. Meat was tender and had a ton of flavor.  They forgot to bring us a salad so the manager gave us the salad free of charge! I would definitely recommend giving this place a try."
Maria M.,"Dublin, CA",28,19,,1.0,7/11/2016,"Yesterday 3 friends and myself went to Applebees in Davis Ca. When I arrived there was only one other person there as the place was just getting ready to open. The service was horrible. We were ignored as people around uswere being served and payng their bills and leavng. It took us 1 1/2 hours to get our order iin and that came out wrong. One of the ladies birtday is coming up so I called the  restaurant to verify I Could bring a cake and was told no problem. It was supposed to  be a surprise. That got screwed up, they don't sing happy birthday any longer (was not told that on hte phone), and the cake was cut in the back without my friend  seeing it. They cut a 8"" round decorated cake into 6 pieces like a pie causiing the cake to fall apart. We had allowed enough time to eat and then attend a play in Davis. I think it was a case of poor service due to the belief that older women in a group do not tip. BIG MISTAKE. We all have service industry backgrounds and my friends always give me grief because I overtip. Not yesterrday. What a disaster. It took over 45 minutes for one of our group to get a bloody maryand they told us that the bartender was slammed. Not one persn was behind the bar. So we were insulted and lied to. Our table was never cleared till we were ready to leave and one of my friends to go container was removed froom the talbe without even askiing. I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager, but am sure nothing was come of it.  You go Applebees!!!"
Alixandre S.,"Davis, CA",269,8,,5.0,5/11/2016,This place gets 5 stars because it has the coldest beer in town and u don't have to wait for it. Other places in Davis the beer is served in warm glasses and u often have to wait forever or go back in line. It is not the case here and to compliment ones demand for immediate thirst the price is fair during their happy hour.
Helen W.,"Davis, CA",7,57,59,1.0,5/7/2015,"Horrible food, bad and slow service.  We use to be regulars here at the davis applebee's.  now they have a new menu, serving size has shrinked dramatically, but price has increased.  Service is very slow, we've waited   over half a hour for our food on a Thursday night, they weren't  even that busy.  The waitress walked by our table a couple of times, but never took away the empty appetizer plate.  Our drinks were left empty, no spoons were bought out for the yogurt we ordered...just a overall bad experience!  We will not be returning."
T F.,"Long Beach, CA",7,42,5,2.0,11/23/2014,French onion soup and chicken strip Mac n cheese special for lunch. Was unimpressed. Totally overpriced for what you get.  They take 1/4 of a normal size chicken strip cut it up into several small pieces on top of some mediocre n cheese. Yuck. Not going to get that again.  French onion soup was just ok.
Jacinda H.,"Folsom, CA",12,8,2,2.0,9/24/2016,"I have to say that this is another horrible experience at Applebee's, we waited for almost half an hour for our food, ( it's 2 o'clock on a Saturday). There's no hardly anyone here... when we did get our food , the French fries were cold... we asked for specifics on the burgers and it wasn't the best, our waitress went outside 4 times while we were there playing on her phone, we didn't get refills on our drinks and they were empty until we were getting ready to leave.. our waitress Luci, looked like she crawled out of bed and put her dirty work clothes on. Her clothes were dirty and very wrinkled, here hair was just up, didn't look brushed.. I understand this is not a 5 star restaurant but even McDonald's employees look better, and I've given better reviews for mcds food.."
Lisa L.,"San Francisco, CA",384,153,457,1.0,7/16/2014,"I've always been a fan of their happy hour but things have definitely changed over the past 2 years for this establishment. It's a really great deal, half price appetizers and drinks which is great when you have a group of friends and share. I haven't been here for awhile and just so happened to be in the area and decided to come on tuesday for the all you can eat rib-let. First off, don't do it! it's not worth the $12 because you'll probably just get sick of one plate. Save your money and go to kettlemens $1 rib night.  They have definitely scaled back on their happy hour menu; the artichoke spinach dip is no longer half off. Boo! Something new to the restaurant; tablet available at each table so you can order. It seems to be convenient but failed in execution. Applebee's cut back on servers so we don't have much of customer service. From the time that we sat done to get our waters, to about 10 minutes. it was just water! The place wasn't packed on a tuesday afternoon, minus a couple of senior citizen probably there for the early bird special. Service was absolutely horrible! Why promote as a family restaurant when they can't even provide the bare minimum level of customer service. Our server never checked up on us. When we were ready to pay, you pay at your table via the tablet. We wanted a to-go box but could not find a single worker on the floor. No bartender, No hostess. No server. No manger on the floor. Was I in an episode of twilight? One of my friends even walked around the whole restaurant to look for someone and no one was to be found. We were contemplating on just leaving without paying because it was ridiculous. After about 20 minutes a manager is finally out on the floor and got us our server. It's funny how the tablet ask you to leave a 20% tip, I think not! OH! and if you tip less then 20%, don't print your receipt because your server will have to bring it to you and they'll see how ungenerous you are."
Yassmeen A.,"Davis, CA",21,6,5,1.0,8/24/2014,"So, if you're going to do take out, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE. I had work at 3 pm the other day, so I went on their website to schedule a to-go order around 2 pm. I chose the option of having them deliver to my car at 2:45, that way I'm not late for work. I get there, and park my car in the to-go spot. I wait for 5 minutes, and no one comes out, so I go inside to get my order. Apparently it's still not ready. So I wait. And wait. And wait. The waitress barely looks at me to let me know when my food will be ready. Every time I asked, she said it was almost done with a sense of annoyance in her tone.  I finally get my food, and it's 2:58 pm. I'm pretty peeved about this, considering now, I'll be late for work. I don't really know why they have a to-go service considering my experience was far from ""to-go."""
Yarid A.,"Davis, CA",2,12,,1.0,7/20/2014,"I used to love this place!!! They changed the look inside. They forgot to change the servers!!!! Plain and simple, bad servers kill restaurants!!!! I'm done with it. Tonight was the last straw.  The server took a long time bringing the food, didn't check on us, and forgot to bring part of the meal.  R.I.P Applebee's. : ("
Melissa M.,"Davis, CA",48,71,70,4.0,5/11/2014,"It's a common place I go to in Davis especially when I'm craving wings, after 9pm they have 1/2 price appetizers and drinks ! Went for a friends celebration on Friday night and the service was good at first but at the end our server kept getting our orders wrong. She charged us full price for an appetizer when it should have been half off, charged us for an extra item, and had trouble splitting up the orders correctly after we specified what went on what tab, so that was a bit frustrating . My food was great though ! Had mozzarella sticks , Spinach dip and chips and half buffalo and sweet and spicy wings"
Tiffany D.,"San Francisco, CA",2768,1929,6297,3.0,6/16/2012,I love their happy hours after 9pm for 1/2 off on appetizers!   Great place to go in groups for social events! Average service and typical ambiance from Applebee's.
Tiffany R.,"San Francisco, CA",1,8,49,1.0,4/25/2014,"Horrible experience here and I now hate Applebee's. My cousins and I were looking forward for a late night meal since we didn't have time to eat dinner since we had to go see a show.  We show up and half out party is already there. They were there for 30 minutes and were stilling waiting on their drinks. We had to wait 15 minutes until we were even brought menus.  The waitress/bar tender was extremely rude. When we told her that were were ready to order she snapped at us with, ""yea I know, everyone is ready to order."" Rude much. So after, we asked a different waiter if he could take our order and he was friendly and very helpful.  We finally ordered. I just got an Oreo milkshake because I wanted something sweet and fast. I was expecting it to come right away. But no. I waited 45 minutes for a milkshake. By the time I got it I wasn't even hungry. I just wanted to go to bed by then because it was around 11:30 at night.  I don't recommend coming here. You would probably have better service at carls jr which is right next door."
Leah H.,"Roseville, CA",52,6,1,1.0,6/9/2016,"Sitting next to a dirty table in a empty restaurant on Lonetree Blvd..our waiter has the personality of a dirt clod, doesn't know the menu and doesn't care...niiiice! Very disappointed ugh!!"
Demis C.,"Davis, CA",212,3,,1.0,9/9/2015,"I used to work at Applebee's before so my expectations for this restaurant would be the same any previous employee would have (I am also servsafe certified). I will start with the good which is the host who greeted in a professional manner and open the door for us. That was the only good part of this experience. The bad, which is the following: 1. Server putting on uniform in plain sight of the guests and using the tables where people eat at to place her clothes and using the chairs guests sit on to tie her shoes (which were not the required non slip shoes and clothes that are not appropriate for the work place in a restaurant) 2. Counted 4 servers who would get drinks from the back place them on a table that is designated for guests and would constantly go to the table to get sips from their drinks and to use their phones while they were on their shift and their sections (section of the restaurant designated to that specific server) would be waiting on their server to pass by and you can see this because everyone was looking around or right at them as they took their ""mini-breaks"" 3. Servers would leave their phones and other personal belonging at tables that are meant for guests and keep going back to these tables constantly (servers always had their nametags on even when taking 5-25min constant breaks in front of their customers)  4. Server empty out trash can at their station and came back to the table where her phone was in less than a minute which is not enough time to wash her hands, worst thing she came back with food to deliver to another table 5. Server took about 15 minutes to get our table water from the time we sat down (Restaurant was not on peak hours and had about a quarter of their tables filled) 6. The food was just ""OK"" and they didn't seem to hide the fact some of their food is refrigerated/frozen (cold in center) 7. Server never came with our check, 20 mins passed since we finished eating and decided to use the convenient and most friendly staff the restaurant had, the tablet gadget to pay our check I felt very disappointed with this visit, it is not the first time I noticed odd things at this specific restaurant and I keep giving them chances to redeem because I have a special connection since my first job was at an Applebee's but I think this is the last time I will go back to this location. 2 for 20 is just not worth it when you have a terrible experience"
Rebecca R.,"Santa Cruz, CA",6,21,1,1.0,4/6/2016,"Come on Applebee's,  we need at least one vegetarian entree!  I don't expect a big vegetarian menu at a place like Applebee's but I would appreciate at least the token pasta dish."
Dilys S.,"San Francisco, CA",181,279,420,4.0,6/20/2012,"A really decent restaurant in Davis actually! Davis is a small place and it is hard to find American comfort food, Applebee's saves the day. It is cozy, friendly, and lots of space for a couple or small group to enjoy. Love the BBQ sauce that comes with the onion rings, great happy hours makes appetizer really cheap, value menus (20 dollar for two giant courses)... very large portions that will feed poor davis students for days.  The drinks are generous and innovative, the corona-rita is literally a small corona (in its full bottle) combined with margarita in an enormous glass. Staff is young and friendly, full of energy, we had lots of requests and questions and they were answered by passionate waitresses. Four stars for great value, family cozy dinner and Romantic date. Really good find in Davis, you know it can't go wrong"
Polly B.,"Sunnyvale, CA",7,20,6,2.0,8/31/2013,"This Applebee's was one of the worst I've ever encountered. We were so excited to get out meal but it was definitely a let down. The steak was over cooked, the dishes that had honey had more than enough honey in them, the BBQ ribs were dry and barely had any meat. We got there pretty early so the place was pretty empty however our food took quite a while! We were full but very unsatisfied. Service was good but we will not be coming back."
Lydia H.,"Dixon, CA",135,316,352,5.0,5/13/2012,"This is a great Applebee's, one of the better locations. Sometimes when they are really busy things can get a little slow but for the most part they have great service and great food and drinks.  The happy hour specials are great too. $3.49 marguaritas and half price appitizers... awesome! This is a great place for a casual dining experience."
