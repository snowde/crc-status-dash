Star D.,"Fullerton, CA",36,122,53,1.0,4/12/2015,Horrible service!! They weren't even busy..that's when service should be its best. Waitress was eating at the bar..our drinks were left empty. Never checked on us. The food..potato cheese soup tasted canned. Burger under cooked..just an all around bad experience. Daughters going to UC Davis..we will mark this place off the list!!
Hanne J.,"San Francisco, CA",1,10,,1.0,8/3/2015,"The restaurant spent a lot of money on their menu folders, with photos that make the meals look large and appetizing. This unfortunately does not translate to the meals themselves, which were unrecognizable. Philly steak with breaded vegetables, onion rings in a thick paste that left a bitter taste, limp Caesar salad from the bitter outer leaves of Romaine, covered in store bought croutons, and a special lunch meal sandwich on white bread that had been toasted long before the meal so it had gone mushy. The worst meal in years. We chose Applebee's because of their advertising but what does that help, if the customer never will be back?"
Zeya X.,"Davis, CA",74,5,1,4.0,11/24/2014,I like their 2 for 25$ combo. The 4 cheese mac& cheese is my favorite tho sooo much calories
Moozhan T.,"Davis, CA",103,198,152,2.0,8/24/2013,"We arrived at around 8:45, we were seated immediately.  we ordered a bogle merlot, which also arrived promptly. So far so good.  for appetizer, by chance, both parties ordered wings as appetizers.  So I got to taste two different wings: the regular with spicy buffalo sauce and blue cheese, and boneless wings mild.  If you like really spicy, then the spicy buffalo isn't spicy enough! the boneless wings were too spicy, and the ranch sauce that came with it didn't really help either.  we had two steaks: medium and medium well, and the quesadilla burger.  the medium steak was under seasoned, the fries were under seasoned, the  medium well was extra dead well-done, and even with a lot of A1 sauce, I still tasted the rubbery awful taste of overdone meat.  And the quesadilla burger... well to be honest, that one looked like it wasn't going to be my thing so I totally chickened out and didn't taste that one."
Mary J.,"Castro Valley, CA",408,243,5290,4.0,4/18/2011,"I tell ya I had a wonderful Applebee's experience here in Davis (in comparison to past disappointments to the one in Alameda). SERVICE: I'm use to host/hostess @ Chili's opening the doors for guests as they enter & leave, but this location warmly greats its patrons by opening the doors also. Party of 3 (w/ elderly disabled pops included) seated immediately on a Sunday evening. Place wasn't jam packed, but definitely had patrons. Our Waitress Megan was excellent! Great personality & friendly enough to carry on a conversation w/ an old buzzard like my pops. Friendly & efficient service all around. Keep up the great work team! BITES: Pops had the House Salad while sis & I had their Caesar Salad. Decently sized plates; salads were just ok. $3.49 House Salad  $3.49 Caesar Salad  Between the 3 of us, we soooo burgered out with fries ^_^ Sis had the Southwest Burger that she said was quite spicy, but really good. Pops had the Bacon Cheddar Burger, that I wasn't sure he was gona be able to handle, but he sure did manage to put it away. We let him eat ""bad"" very minimally so he very much appreciated his meal & savored each delicious bite. Now me, my fav is their Quesadilla Burger *tee-hee*. I really should've just ate half & stopped, but it was so good & I'm not crazy about left over sandwiches...I put the WHOLE THING AWAY! Did I hurt afterwards...I can't lie, I did =( That's what happens when ur eyes are bigger than ur stomach. $8.99 Southwest Burger  $8.99 Bacon Cheddar Burger  $8.99 Quesadilla Burger  $3.99 Side of (overpriced) Fries  FINAL TAB: For party of 3, final bill came to $45.08. As we were getting ready to leave, they let us leave at a closer exit door by our table while my sis brough the car around for pops & I. I tell ya, I really do appreciate family oriented & disabled friendly restaurants that provide good food & great service. Thank you Applebee's in Davis! ADDT'L FYI: They have free Wi-Fi"
Jess s.,"San Francisco, CA",231,309,436,3.0,5/12/2011,"It was Sunday night and we were all too lazy to cook, so we decided to go out to Applebee's for some drinks and food- since the food shown on the tv commercials looks good.  Applebee's has this happy hour promo - from 9pm until closing their house margarita, house long island ice tea and whatever beer they have on tap is around $3 each( with the option to add in a flavor for an extra 50cents) and all appetizers are $5 with a purchase of a drink. Granted the happy hour menu wasn't that big (drink wise) but  I was there for margaritas anyways so it all worked out. I opted for a few margaritas. But my favorite combination is mango and strawberry blended margarita. Omfg. That shit was so good!! I had a couple.  We also ordered a mango ice tea that tasted like sewer water. It was super gross tasting and was not sweetened at all (worse $3 ever spent!). And took advantaged of their 2 for $20 deal and got ourselves the buffalo wings, Cajun shrimp pasta , and riblet.  The wings were perfect ! Not too spicy and not too greasy. The pasta was a little too spicy for my liking but the shrimp was done perfectly! As for the riblets, they were AMAZING!!! Each piece of meat literally fell off the bone and did not taste dry! Yay!!"
Amanda S.,"Cottonwood, CA",0,4,1,2.0,3/15/2016,"thai shrimp salad arrived first without greens in the salad, returned. then arrived without shrimp, returned. Basically I got wontons and edamame with salad dressing. No silverware provided. Weird experience."
Steven H.,"West Sacramento, CA",61,23,74,3.0,2/27/2015,"This place is what it is. But their boneless wings are pretty darn good. Come for happy hour. Also, they're having a beer  week special on special brews from Sam Adams.... Mmmm beer"
Rusty S.,"West Sacramento, CA",60,13,6,2.0,4/17/2015,This place needs to stop tryn to save a buck and serv better portions the high price would then be justified other then that service is good
Charlie P.,"Sacramento, CA",6,281,,2.0,2/18/2013,"Worst experience we have ever had at an Applebee's.   We waited over ten minutes for a server to come by and I eventually had to go to the front desk and request someone to help us with an order.  Another 5 mins passed before anybody showed up.  The restaurant was only half full so I can't blame it in being crowded.   The manager was more concerned with changing a sign in the bar than making sure customers were being attended to.  Once we finally got our order placed, the waitress went onto take the orders of three other tables before entering our order into the computer system.  Another 15 mins later, 2 of our drinks showed up and we had to wait another 5 mins to get the last one.   Other people who ordered after us received their food first and we were forced to watch them eating while we were growing older waiting for our food.  To add insult to injury, we witnessed the Manager check on a table right next to ours and walked right by us as if we were not even there.  What a lack of customer service!!! We go to the Gold River location every week, so we know what a good Applebee's is like.  We will not be returning to the Davis location as being treated as valuable customers is important to us.  Please beware of this location...they are blowing it and need help."
Erin V.,"Alameda, CA",8,19,6,1.0,2/8/2015,"There should be an option for -'s!! Lol Our server was decent, polite, although we had to ask him several times for napkins! I got half way through Chicken Portebello, fund hair in my food! When my boyfriends food got to the table his ribs were also already cold. So, basically we were starving on our way home from circus circus & Applebee's is my daughters favorite place, right off the freeway also..guess we will stick to the one in Alameda!!!!"
Theodore S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",41,255,88,4.0,11/22/2013,"Huge fan of the evening happy hour! The prices are great and for under $20 you can have quite a few drinks and some food to share with friends. The bartender is always nice, no matter who it is. They are not very busy at night, which is the main reason I prefer to come here. I'm not a huge fan of hanging around all of the college kids in downtown, so this is a good escape to meet good people and tip a few back.  They also have free wi-fi which is a huge boom for those of us who hate the 4G speeds in Davis."
Gaby B.,"Sacramento, CA",3,23,,3.0,10/14/2014,"i actually kinda like this place, i dont know why so many negative reviews, i had really good customer service. The waitress name was Jessica, she was super nice!! Had a good time. Just wish the food was better, my burger tasted plain."
Andy S.,"Davis, CA",0,8,1,2.0,8/11/2014,"I do not suggest going here. I just went here on aug 11 at 10pm and ordered the 3 cheese chicken penne and was incredibly disappointed. The chicken was pathetic, just little crispy strings of meat half the size of french fries. The alfredo sauce was watery and on top of everything the food was cold. Also, the bread stick I got with it was barely seasoned and stil had flour all over the bottom! I mean, how do you screw up a breadstick?? Overall it was simply pathetic and it definitely wasnt worth $11.99. However, im giving it two stars because my girlfriends salad was good. I definitely won't be eating here again."
Edward W.,"New York, NY",318,1091,1912,3.0,7/26/2011,"I had the 2 for 20 deal. The boneless buffalo wings were definitely good since they had no bones and were tender, juicy, easy to chew. The riblet basket was pretty much just unmarinated meat coated with a lot of bbq sauce; definitely not a good entree. The cajun shrimp pasta would have been a better choice.  TL;DR; Boneless buffalo is great. The riblet basket is horrible."
Review W.,"Seattle, WA",0,102,,3.0,3/18/2015,"First of all, I appreciated that a manager greeted us when we came in and came around to check on our table while we were eating. I don't think this has happened before at any other Applebee's so it was a nice touch.  We did have an issue, however, when it came to our check. One of us ordered a burger with a substitute of a salad instead of fries. When doing this in the past at other Applebee's, we've only been charged $1 for the substitution. When we got the bill, there was a $4+ charge for a salad. I believe this is the price of a separate side salad. I told the waitress this was incorrect, and she came back with a bill with a charge of $3.99, which I assume is the price of adding a salad to a meal, rather than substituting it for something else. I would not have minded this charge if I in fact ADDED the salad, and still got fries, but this was not the case. We unfortunately did not have time to sit there and hassle with the bill and teach the waitress how to do her job, so we paid the bill in full and instead took the amount we feel we were overcharged out of her tip.  Aside from this incident, we had a nice time and the food was very good."
Cindy K.,"Folsom, CA",208,1066,517,1.0,9/20/2010,"The food here gives me nightmares! It may look good in the commercial but the food is really crap. This is the one place in Davis that I do not ever want to go to.  The service is good though, but I'm not here for just service. I want good food! Rawr!"
Lauren D.,"San Francisco, CA",379,154,3,2.0,7/16/2013,"I was so looking forward to this experience, but got HORRIBLE food poisoning from the Quesadilla Burger. Our waitress was great for the beginning half of our meal, but then a group of about 7 of her friends showed up and started ordering a ton of drinks, and she basically stopped paying attention to the rest of her tables. The couple in the booth behind us were getting really pissed off because they were in a hurry to leave.  Definitely recommend avoiding this spot."
Claire C.,"Woodland, CA",5,80,,3.0,7/8/2014,The only place in Davis where you can get a piña colada. Not the only place in Davis where you can get caught in the rain or make love at midnight.
Lorrie M.,"San Jose, CA",3761,2986,262,3.0,4/7/2010,"I had a friend who worked here as a waitress for some time so maybe it's slightly bias of me but I really think that this is a nice Applebees! The interior is clean, the bathrooms are well kept and although it's in an area that's not so populated, it gets pretty crowded on a weekend night. Overall, I enjoy Applebee's especially for their burgers and baby back riblets. I haven't found this type of appetizer anywhere else nor the taste at even the most awesome BBQ places I have been to. Not to say that it is better than those places but it's got something to offer that no one else has.  You also can't really complain much about the price since the whole ordeal is more or less well priced for two especially now that they have those crazy meal deals. Good place to catch a weekday bite if you're in Davis!"
