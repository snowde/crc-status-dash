Cynthia B.,"Fremont, CA",234,159,69,3.0,3/26/2013,"I'm usually never impressed by Applebee's but this one in Davis is pretty decent. It has the same layout as any other and the customer service is decent. I came here twice for Finals week because I really needed an excuse to not study and well a person's gotta eat right?! The first round, I came for the happy  hour and got the buffalo wings for half off. I got the sweet and spicy flavored ones and they did get pretty spicy after a couple of pieces. I love that the portions are so big just for the appetizers. I couldn't even finish all my wings and had to ask my friend to help eat the rest. I would always recommend the buffalo wings because it comes in an abundant of supply and is delicious.  For my second return, I ordered the Lemon Shrimp Fettucine. It was pretty good itself but it came out with rice instead of pasta so I was really confused! However, I did not care much because I like rice anyway. The portion seemed smaller than the pasta dish that I got on one of my other visits. Or it could be that I was just starving that night. But that does not matter either, because I was filled up by the time I left Applebee's.  Overall, the place is a pretty good place to go especially for their happy hour!"
Janet H.,"San Francisco, CA",821,1087,218,3.0,5/8/2010,"It's kinda sad that I pretty much only come here for happy hour... I just can't resist the $4 appetizers (omg, burger sliders & fries for only $4?! Yes, please!) and the $3 Margaritas. Yum. Unfortunately, there's nothing else that spectacular about Applebee's. It's just a good place to have profound conversations with friends and pig out on the appetizers during happy hour. I've had their 2 for $20 meals a few times with friends, but the food was just mediocre. I'd say if you come to applebees, just go for the appetizers and margaritas."
Daniel S.,"San Francisco, CA",698,104,397,2.0,5/30/2012,I usually just come during their happy hour for 1/2 off appetizers and drink specials. My favorites are their boneless buffalo wings and their artichoke dip.  I also went on a Tuesday night and it was trivia night! It was pretty amusing to say the least.  I've had other things on their menu like their steak and pasta and it was NOT GOOD.
Cynthia V.,"Rio Vista, CA",58,1,,5.0,11/16/2015,Really enjoyed our last two visits here. The manager is super nice as well as the staff. Obviously the food is what you pay for but I love their burgers. They always have some sort of special which is a plus. Oh and they are military friendly... Love that.
Derald S.,"San Rafael, CA",7,17,,1.0,2/3/2014,"I was planning to drive through Davis at about dinner time on Super Bowl Sunday, so I called in the morning to ask about specials for the game and whatnot.  I was told on the phone that there would be quite a few specials including half priced appetizers, and that they would continue as long as the game was on.  We have kids, so I thought it would be fun to just order a bunch of appetizers, catch the end of the game, and go home. First, the waitress seemed irritated that we were even there from the beginning  Then, we were told that the appetizer specials ended at 6pm, we got there at 615, but the drink specials were still going.  So, we ordered some kids meals (On special for $199, yay!) for the kids, 2 for 20 for us and a margarita.   Once we received our food, we didn't see our waitress again until I had to follow her nearly into the kitchen to ask for our check.  We were overcharged for (literally) every thing on our menu except the 2 for 20.  Idk how much 12oz margaritas usually are, but $7 for a well margarita seems steep, even NOT during happy hour.   The whole experience nearly from the time we walked in, to the time we walked out was negative.  Save yourself the trouble, push on to Sac or Vacaville, or just go somewhere else.   Boo  :("
Mary H.,"Alameda, CA",1,18,,1.0,4/26/2015,"OMG, where do I start?  We went for a Sunday lunch, the restaurant was slow.  Our greeter was very pleasant, showed us to our table and said our server would be with us shortly.  When the server didn't show for 15+minutes, the greeter came back and said that our server was busy, but he (the greeter) could get our beverage order.  He delivers our beverages in a few short minutes.  About 5 minutes later, our server arrives in a hurry and asks if he can get our beverage order, not realizing that it has already been taken care of.  We order.  When the food arrived, I discover that the medium well burger that I ordered was almost raw!  I knew it wasn't someone else's order because I had asked for my BBQ sauce on the side and no onions and this was done.  For the next 10+ minutes, I try to locate my server/any server to send back my burger for a little more cooking.  No one could be found and no one responded to the red light on their little table-side computer.  Finally, I see the greeter ushering in another party.  I ask him to come over--and he ignores me!  At this point, the two others in my party are nearly finished with their meals.  I pick up my plate and locate another server on the floor.  (Mine is nowhere to be found.)  This server apologizes profusely and says he'll replace my order.  About 10 minutes later (now my friends are finished with their meals), my order comes back with a complimentary second order of fries.  The burger, although now done the way I had requested, is dripping in grease.  The complimentary fries taste like stale fish.  I couldn't eat this meal!  So, we decide to check out--I couldn't see keeping my friends any longer and we needed to get on the road.  So I use the check-out table-side system only to find that they charged me twice for the icky burger.  I was almost tempted to pay for the extra burger just to get out of Dodge.  But, no that didn't seem right, either. I try the red light again and this time my server is there within a few minutes.  When I explained what happened he was very apologetic and admitted that the restaurant was having a ""really, really bad day"" (his words).  I actually felt terribly for the young guy.  I did tip him for his efforts, although he never came back to ask us if we need a beverage refresh. We won't go back.  My friends' food was not very tasty and expensive for the portions offered.  It just isn't worth going back!"
LaMaruja M.,"Sacramento, CA",1,167,1,1.0,11/23/2015,"Horrible experience. This applebees just needs to call it quits and close down. We came in and waited for 10 minutes with this ipad device on our table. The waitress finally came by and said ""did you guys already order?"" We were like....ummm no. She said ""ok, ill get your drinks and you can order on the app"" WTF? Is this a real restaurant or a food delivery service. We wait wait wait wait. A table of elderly couples left because no one was serving them. We should have followed their lead but unfortunately we stayed. My friends food came out without any of the specifications. He is allergic to tomato and there was a giant tomato slice, it seemed almost hostile. I ordered a pasta bowl without chicken and it was completely flavorless, microwaved pasta with no texture. We quickly asked for the check and she kept trying to convince us to pay with the app. We gave her our credit card and she was gone for another 8 minutes. The stupid ridiculous apps supposed big selling point is that you can play games while you wait for your food....exvept that the games cost money and are added to your bill! And why is there even a slot on the bill for a tip if they have computers at every table to do the job of the waitress. Will never be back! And the restaurant was completely empty so i take many other people refuse to come here to. We spent an hour there and i left having to go to another restaurant to eat, and interact with actual people. They had a sign saying ""if we dont offer you a gift card, you get a free mozerella on your next visit"". They didnt offer us a gift card, but even if they tried to lure us in with free food we wouldnt go back."
Kristie F.,"Sacramento, CA",349,211,359,3.0,9/4/2012,One of my top visited places as a undergrad S. Davis resident. Happy hour starts from 9 til they close! drinks and margaritas for ~$3-4 and it comes in all kinds of flavors!  Some select appetizers are also on sale.   I recommend the ARTICHOKE DIP (can definitely never go wrong with artichoke dip!!) I will remember applebees as my go-to place to get together with friends for good eats and drinks =)
Shannon S.,"Davis, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/6/2015,I found the management to be extremely rude. The food was okay. But the staff needs to get their act together and not be do rude to their customers.
Violet W.,"San Francisco, CA",262,217,577,3.0,9/27/2011,"During my last quarter as an undergrad, my friends and I would come here almost every Tuesday night for Trivia night and for happy hour.   The food was alright...drinks were good!  Love boneless buffalo...and the 2 for $20 deal.  Our servers were almost always awesome...don't have any complaints!"
Jenny T.,"San Francisco, CA",59,128,101,3.0,8/23/2012,"2 for $20! My boyfriend and I always order the 2 for $20, which is 1 appetizer + 2 entrees. My recommendations: - Boneless wings: I recommend ordering the wings with honey BBQ. But if you want more spiciness, there are other flavors. - Blackened Chicken Penne: I love this dish because it comes with chicken, spinach, and tomatoes. - Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp: I love the taste of bourbon, so that's why I like this dish. - Riblet Basket: Easy to eat ribs. - 7 oz. House Sirloin: This dish is okay. The service is mediocre. The most recent times I've dined here, the service was not as great and attentive as back then."
Claire W.,"Miami, FL",164,339,1593,2.0,4/10/2012,"I USED TO LOVE APPLEBEE'S, BUT THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW. This place is like a BAD HABIT I can't break.  I give it 2 stars because I like the food but for a little while now, it's been not so bueno. SHORT VERSION: Slow service (will never use their to-go!), food is on the decline LONG VERSION: So, I called in a to-go order for an Oriental Chicken Salad ($9.99) and loaded mashed potatoes ($1.99), the guy on the phone said it would be around $12.  I drive there, park in the To-Go Parking...where they are supposed to spot your car and bring your food out.  Wellll, after 5 mins of waiting (in 97 degree weather mind you) I get out of the car and decide to walk in the restaurant to get the show on the road.  I walk through the patio and past 2 cashiers who don't bother asking me if I need help.  I tell them that I called in an order and one guy tells me to sit down then he disappears into the kitchen.  I see a to-go bag on the table across from me and wonder if it's mine.  Two minutes later, another guy walks to where I am, picks up the bag of food and proceeds to walk out the door.  He's going to my car and as he gives me the food, the bill is $2+ more than what they said on the phone (the potatoes are $3+).  I tell the waiter this and he goes back inside the restaurant to talk to the manager...I wait in the car with the AC on full blast.  He comes back out with my change...INCORRECT change might I add.  (I gave him $20.31 for a $14.31 bill and he comes back with $5 and change...DUH!)  By this point, I don't want to argue about the fact that they charged me more than what they said because frankly I am too freakin' hot and sweaty from waiting for them to give me my food.  And to top it off, my salad didn't come with enough dressing!  Usually when I eat it in the restaurant I have too much and now too little!! My go-to dish here were the RIBLETS; but they must have changed the way they cook it because it started tasting REALLY lousy...too CHEWY.  I usually order the oriental chicken salad and I really like the loaded mashed potatoes.  Their MANGO LEMONADE is also pretty good.   The service is so-so...depends on who you get.  The guy that looks like Horatio from SNL was pretty rude when I went with a party of 10.  He looked like he hated his job. BOTTOM LINE: I wish I could say I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN...but I don't know...just...tooo...yummy. I would go here again...if only my friends liked the place..haha."
Sandy T.,"San Francisco, CA",479,133,1008,4.0,7/26/2009,"The food wasn't bad at all. I ordered chop steak which was sooo good. You don't even need A1 sauce since it's very flavorful already. I had mines with mash potato.  When my boyfriend and I first walked in, we were literally waiting at the door for a few minutes, thinking if we should just sit somewhere or wait. There wasn't any sign to direct us to sit, so we were just staring around, hoping someone will get to us. I swear a few servers saw us but they were too ""busy"" with the few tables they were waiting on. Anyways, someone finally greets us and sat us down. He was pretty nice and was attentive. Later on there was this girl who looks like either the manager that asked us how our food was and if we needed anything.  Anyways, it isn't as bad. The waiting part in the beginning knocked a star down"
Hyunee C.,"Davis, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/9/2013,"7yr old boy said, ""POOR SERVICE, I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN!"" My family waited nearly 1 hour after ordering beverages and dinner,  Food was not served, ended up leaving 'will without food', hungry 7PM headed to Crapeville."
Monica L.,"Davis, CA",0,4,,4.0,7/24/2014,"Usually I don't like Applebees, but this one is great, wonderful service, no waiting time. :)"
Karen Y.,"Woodland, CA",1,17,,5.0,7/23/2014,"Clean, friendly servers, food was good and hot, server was attentive, not a long wait, food was perfect!"
Nathan Y.,"Carmichael, CA",175,308,72,1.0,11/24/2009,"I came with a friend and ordered the Three-Cheese Chicken Penne and 7oz House Sirloin from the ""2 for $20 menu"" The chicken was edible. The 7oz House Sirloin wasn't. I asked for it to be cooked medium-rare, but received it burnt-crisp. It tasted like rubber. How could any restaurant fail so badly at cooking (i.e. microwaving)? I complained about it, and they didn't offer a refund. They just asked whether I wanted to order another item. Yes, order ... not freely-replace for their soot-covered meat. I know the economy is bad, but it doesn't mean that they can hand you a lump of charcoal and claim that it's steak."
Cindy L.,"San Leandro, CA",51,171,165,2.0,3/30/2011,"Eh, only go here during the happy hour for some wings. The artichoke spinach dip is always yum.  However, the service is annoying. They really needa work on their service. Our server made a mistake in our order and didn't own up to it. He clearly mixed us up with another table and when I asked for my order to be corrected- he said, ""thats what you ordered, I remembered."" Really now? Oh, and the service is pretty darn slow too."
Cynthia W.,"Davis, CA",0,6,,3.0,1/15/2014,"Overall rating: 3 stars Service: 2 stars Food: 3 stars Value: 3 stars I was very happy when this Applebee's opened in Davis, as it's one of the only places in Davis where you can get general American cuisine, and still is. I use to be a regular here and ended up knowing most of the staff and management at one time. Yes, you read that right, past tense. Over the years the service has gone from great to just fair, and I've seen this place lose a lot of repeat business because of it, which is quite depressing because I'd like the place to stick around. When you do get service, in my experience, it's usually friendly, but more often than not you're going to have longer than average wait times. You definitely don't want to come here if you are on any kind of time schedule! If you're here just to chill and relax and have nowhere to go, it can be ok. The staff do seem to be more interested in talking with each other and doing small tasks like rolling up silverware than really paying attention to their customers, and this hurts business. While I understand certain tasks need to be done, customers should really come first, and it's irritating when, as a customer, you suddenly need something like a drink refill, extra napkins, etc and you can't get the attention of your waiter/waitress who is over in the corner rolling up silverware and chatting with their coworkers - no matter how slow business might be. Sitting at the bar helps eliminate some of these problems, but you shouldn't have to sit at the bar to have a decent meal with service. I've also had a few (though rare) experiences where they've been completely out of something basic - for example, tonight they had no ice cream. So much for ordering any dessert :( This place does have some good things going for it though. For starters, they are open late - usually until at least midnight. They also have free WiFi, clean restrooms, and when I've come in the place is always kept pretty clean in general. They have some decent happy hour specials, including late night happy hour (after 9PM Mon-Thur) where a number of appetizers are half price (but full size) - my favorites for this are the boneless honey BBQ wings (nearly a meal in itself), and the fried mozzarella sticks. There's the 2-for-$20 deal which is worthwhile if you like the offerings there (my husband and I usually choose this) - you get 2 entrees and a free appetizer. You save a couple of bucks off the normal price of each entree and get a free (full size) appetizer to boot. I've sometimes even ordered the 2-for-$20 for myself and just have the second entree and half the appetizer boxed up to take home for lunch/dinner the next day. Rare is the time I've had a bad meal (food-wise) here, but the food is also typical Applebee's, so it's not going to wow you in any way. Tip: Order to go, or don't be under any time schedule when you come here. Also, take advantage of their specials."
Jennifer W.,"Milpitas, CA",329,223,214,2.0,8/8/2010,"I came here for a friend's birthday dinner last night.  they always have good deals on their appetizers and combos.   My friend and I shared Appetizer Sampler - $12.95.  it has mozzarella sticks, spinach & artichoke dip, cheese quesadilla grande with bacon (but we ordered it without bacon),  and boneless buffalo wings. I love their spinach & artichoke dip, but this time..it wasn't as satisfying as the other times i had it.  The dip came out lukewarm and the cheese didn't stick onto the chip.  I was very disappointed. =\ Cheese quesadilla was good! i like how the tortilla was crunchy.  however, i didn't like the tomatoes in it.  it tasted kinda weird. the boneless buffalo wings were DISGUSTING! it was VERY VERY SALTY!  The service was bleh.  Our waiter kept rushing us to order even though our whole party wasn't there yet.  Our food came out at different times.  My 2 friends ordered an appetizer and their main course and it came out before everybody's.  -_- the sad part was when the 4 people who ordered the appetizer samplers, it came out last! so it was lukewarm!! no good!"
