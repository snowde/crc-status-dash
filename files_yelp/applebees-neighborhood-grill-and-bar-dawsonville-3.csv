Gary B.,"Dawsonville, GA",2,34,,5.0,12/9/2013,"We decided to go there a few weeks ago.   The place was clean, the staff was very helpful and the food was great. the food didn't give me the squirts and that's a good thing.  I've always liked Applebees, it's a safe place to go and get a good meal."
Debra F.,"Panama City Beach, FL",7,3,1,1.0,10/15/2017,Terrible service. 2 for 25? Do not get the beef sirloin. Wait service to busy chatting. Not once did they check on us ..WE had to ask..needless to say only 10% and should not have done that. I worked in the food service putting myself thru school..and you have to give great service....and the cooks have to deliver great food ..management here is questionable at best.
J W.,"Gainesville, GA",0,3,,1.0,6/16/2017,My pregnant fiancé ordered the nachos Togo so she started eating them on the way home and as she started getting to the bottom of a corner where most of the cheese was and she turned to me and asked me to try it and see if it tasted like chemicals or was it just her. It was certainly not just her the cheese tasted like straight chemicals I spit it out as fast as I put it in my mouth. So we turn around go back and I take it inside and tell a server that something was wrong that my pregnant fiancé was eating her food that had got chemicals in it somehow so she goes in the back tells the manager and he pretty much acted like it wasn't a big deal and just voided it off my card no apology nothing. He obviously didn't care that somehow or someone was getting chemicals in the food. Will never go back. And if my pregnant fiancé and unborn child gets sick from this there will be a lawsuit.
Justin S.,"Atlanta, GA",691,7,5,1.0,5/10/2016,"This is the second time I've been to this location and I figured I would give it another shot before leaving a review. Unfortunately, both times the service has not been the quality I've grown to expect from Applebee's. I've had Shannon as a server both times and I have just been let down by her poor attitude, lack of enthusiasm, and rude demeanor. During the first visit, the service was so poor, a friend had to contact the franchise owner to rectify the situation. The second time around was not any better. She did not make the promotional offer at the beginning of service nor acknowledge the fact that we are entitled to a free lemonade for her neglect to do so. It is my highest hope that this location opts to retrain their waitstaff as my experiences unfortunately have me looking elsewhere for dinner."
Ozge Y.,"Atlanta, GA",0,1,,5.0,3/22/2017,"They re great,our server is Sevennah. She is so understanding,so sweet. Try berry sangria,you ll love it!"
Matt J.,"Gainesville, GA",0,4,,3.0,9/4/2016,"Did the carside to go, I got there 5 mins after my good was estimated to be done and then say there for an extra 5 mins before I called into the store to see why no one was coming out then I was put on hold 1 min later the guy came out and served me my at least 11 min old food the I handed him cash and proceeds to tell me that he doesn't have a til. I told him to just keep the change cause I didn't want to wait another 5 mins for him to come back but then he asks me what kind of condiments I would like, well I waited anyways for those 5 mins before I got them delivered to me by someone else. Never a great experience when I go to this location unless it's lunch time on weekdays"
Amy W.,"Atlanta, GA",29,134,200,1.0,5/28/2016,"For a chain restaurant I actually use to like Applebee's food. However the service here is terrible and unprofessional. Drinks are bad too. I guess Dawsonville doesn't have any decent servers to hire, because both times I went to this one, the service was ridiculously bad."
Erica G.,"Peachtree City, GA",229,171,592,2.0,8/20/2015,"We ate at this location on a Thursday around 5pm. I can't remember the exact names, but we ordered a chicken skillet, steak skillet, chicken fingers, asian salad, broccoli, and potatoes. The chicken was really dry and didn't taste good at all. The broccoli was gross. I don't know what was on it. We ordered the steak medium, but it came out well. The potatoes were good and it's difficult to mess up a salad or fried chicken fingers. I was going to politely mention the errors to our waiter, but my friend who works in the restaurant industry wouldn't allow it. Just for reference, our waiter was very nice."
Donna B.,"Cumming, GA",0,8,,1.0,9/15/2016,"On Sat, September 10, 2016, at 6:15 pm, my husband and I met two of our friends at the Applebee's located on Highway 400 in Dawsonville. When we arrived we were told that there would be a 10 minute wait (even though there were 10 to 12 booths/tables open). The people coming in just after us were being told that it would be a 13 minute wait. We asked why we couldn't sit at one of the open tables. We were told that the kitchen was not ready. Again, we asked if we could sit at one of the tables in the bar area so we could order a drink while we waited. We were told that we could sit at the bar, but not at one of the tables. We walked over to the bar where the bartender and manager were talking, and expressed our total unbelief as to what was happening. They both said that  something must be wrong, so they went up to the front desk. After talking with the staff they told us we would have to wait because the waiters were not ready. We told them that was the most bazaar thing we had ever witnessed, and that we would just go to another restaurant for dinner...which we did!! And, as a result of that issue we will never again go back to Applebee's. They lost four very good customers...a bad, bad call by Applebee's Staff!!"
Steven G.,"Dahlonega, GA",15,27,7,4.0,2/9/2016,"I  am very picky about food, and Applebee's is a middle of the road place, not great, not bad. Always reliable, in my experience. But I must say that every time I stop at this location the service is excellent. Servers seem knowledgeable and very friendly. Jamie, Bree, and heather are excellent servers. SUPER friendly. Remember my wife's and my drink order every time. Very good experience with them. They do a great job!!"
Jenn T.,"Dawsonville, GA",3,1,,1.0,9/13/2016,"It was terrible... First...  Our waitress... She was rude... And seemed to not know what her job was about... They finally brought our food out, or so I thought they were,after waiting for 30 mins,  but they went to the table text to us, and say the good down... Turns out it was our food because it wasn't that tables... They were complaining too... So even tho they didn't touch the plates they had to take then back and remake them,which that I understand.. then after waiting another 30 mins our food came out... It was cold... And not very good... The waitress only filled our waters once... But she walked by our table several times only to ignore us and the other table that was trying to get her attention... I waited tables for 10 years of my life and I would not have expected a tip had I  been as stude as she was.. yet still she got a $5 blessing .... Maybe train her again... And be a little more humble .. I do understand it can be stressful but she only had 4 tables... I hope everything works out for her... SMH"
Bradlee M.,"Chattanooga, TN",5,1,,2.0,5/10/2016,"I went out to celebrate with a friend. This is the second time I've been to this establishment, and I was just as disappointed as the first time. As soon as I walked in the door the waitstaff was attentive, but it seemed as if they hated their jobs. My waitress had a very poor attitude, Shannon. I've worked in the restaurant industry for a while, and I understand how when it comes close to closing time moral is a little low. However, customers shouldn't see that. The waitress was very rude until my friend revealed where they worked. Suddenly, she perked up as soon as she knew that could be a sell. As well, the waitress didn't offer us the drinks she was supposed to when she sat the table.  I feel that the experience would have been better if the waitstaff would have been a little more attentive and friendly. It definitely put a damper on the celebratory vibe we were going for. I would definitely consider a different Applebee's in the area that has a little friendlier service before this one."
Lisa K.,"Cumming, GA",8,9,8,4.0,7/5/2013,"Our family is pretty picky high taste eaters and my salad was great, hubby said his sirloin was good and cooked correctly and son had a kids cheeseburger, cheapest kids meal for a sit down restaurant. We will be back."
Brett S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,142,,3.0,6/12/2011,"They have redone this location and the food and service is much improved! Today for lunch we had the Shrimp and spinach salad which was very good. My only complaint was the salad dressing had over 300 calories and was loaded with bacon bits. Tasty, but so unnecessary! My wife had the Club sandwich which was delicious, but a bit too much Mayonnaise. Our server kept our drinks full and was attentive. For us o give them more stars they need to Jake their offerings a bit more healthy."
Alex G.,"Dahlonega, GA",0,3,,1.0,7/28/2012,"Wow, I just wanna say I'm not a big fan of the chain restaurants, simply because of the food and service I got here. The waiter wasn't this nicest guy. His attitude changed when my friend confronted him about the small uncooked amount of french fries on his plate. His fiancés vegetable were terribly undercooked,as we're my mashed potatoes. And if you like your salt with your sirloin then you will love this place."
Eric S.,"Cumming, GA",0,11,,1.0,4/18/2013,"My wife and I live a short drive from this location.  Since relocating to the area over a year ago, we have frequented the restaurant on impulse.  The waitstaff knows us by sight and many know our names.  Typically, our dining excursions take us south to Alpharetta or closer to the perimter.  After our latest experience at this location, we will always drive farther for a meal.  The protion size and quality have shrunk over the last year.  Normally, my expectations are lowered for a franchise restaurant location.  The food no longer meets even my minimum expectaions."
Jim S.,"Melbourne, FL",1,10,,2.0,7/29/2010,"I had the riblet basket. Not much meat, a little fat, and bone chips. These should not be served in a basket. You end up punching holes in the paper that lines the basket.  However I do like all of their chicken dishes, bowls etc. But this was disappointing tonight. It is a cozy place and the $2 brutus miller light drafts were great."
