Sarah M.,"East Lansing, MI",176,2,,5.0,8/6/2017,"Had a performance in town and called them the day before to tell them 60 people were coming at a really late hour. The staff was incredibly accommodating! Great service, great food, great times. We all wanted a round of shots and even though it's not on their menu so they didn't have shot glasses they made it work for us."
Steph J.,"Ocean Springs, MS",4,23,,1.0,2/25/2017,"While the waitstaff is quick, courteous and responsive, the food is absolutely disgusting. I ordered the French onion soup and honey chicken tenders with fries. I would have been better off going to Hy-Vee and buying them on my own. The soup has so much bread and cheese that it seemed like there was virtually no soup in it - I tried to eat it and it was so congealed and chewy that I ended up having to peel it off with my knife. It had obviously been premade and reheated, which is just...gross, because I believe that if the halved the bread and cheese and made it fresh, it would have been good. The chicken tenders were fatty, covered in this sickly sweet sauce that was difficult to stomach. But one decent thing: their fry game is okay. I wish I could review food and service separately - because I would give 5 for the waitstaff, and 1 (none, really) for the food. Special thanks to James, my server, for putting on Bayern Munich v Arsenal for me. I very much appreciated that."
BJ J.,"DeKalb, IL",0,1,,1.0,8/8/2017,"Went here for lunch with a friend and was sorely disappointed. We arrived five minutes after they opened and we were the only table there, so you'd think service would be quick.  After waiting 12 minutes for our appetizer salad to come out, it came out on a frozen plate and half way through the ice chunks that were cemented to the plate started melting so our salad became filled with water in the bottom of the plate and became inedible.  Our food came after another 15 minutes and it was okay. I got a toasted sandwich and the bottom piece of bread was completely soaked through and mushy, I'm guessing because the lettuce wasn't drained. When the girl (not our server) dropped off our food, we asked for refills on our drinks. Never came. Never got checked on for food or drinks again until the end of the meal when everything was finished. We were then offered the refills. We said yes to them and were forgotten about again. Once the refills arrived, while we were waiting for the check, the beverages were wrong. Not even what we ordered. Our server didn't write anything down.  There were two or three managers, four or five wait staff, and one really sweet hostess. Why we weren't taken care of and things were wrong? No idea."
Jen S.,"Tinley Park, IL",76,14,7,1.0,7/21/2017,"Terrible service. I would have called to complain to the manager instead of posting this .. but ... Manager was sitting right by us ... had a staff meeting while we sat, ignored by our server, restaurant was not busy .. no reason for us to be waiting to be greeted and served. Will not be returning."
Tom K.,"Hanover Park, IL",123,1,,1.0,7/19/2017,"Our server was great, I believe his name was Justin. But the quality of food, at best, was subpar. The burger I ordered came out almost cold, while what my girlfriend ordered didn't taste that great either (it was something with chicken that sat on top of mashed potatoes with way too much red onion), and the flavor on both dishes would be something gourmet for your dog (almost flat and bland). I wasn't satisfied with the presentation on everything, including the appetizer, which was the only thing that came out scorching hot (mozzarella sticks). I wouldn't recommend coming here for anyone. Luckily there's a Chili's opening up a new location down the street."
Caitlin J.,"DeKalb, IL",123,7,,3.0,4/2/2017,"First off, I would like to point out that our server, Marissa, was super sweet and great. Food was pretty decent for the price. But I don't understand why you can't get the caprese burger without onions seared in to it. Our server went back and asked about it and was told it wasn't possible. I'm assuming it's because it's frozen and pre-made, but still... a little disappointing."
Mary K.,"Warrenville, IL",3,22,3,2.0,3/24/2017,I came here with my husband and three children tonight for dinner. The food was really good! Nobody had a complaint about the food. However you do not get enough food for what you pay. After eating dinner all of us have left hungry. The service was awful. The lady that was our server did not come to our table and check on us. When we asked for something we had to ask a few times. And she had to apologize more times than I can remember. Even though the food was good we will not be back. There are much better places in the area to spend that amount of money.
Keah D.,"Plymouth, MN",0,1,,1.0,8/11/2017,"Currently sitting at the bar here: We ordered nachos (without the beef) and the pub pretzels with the beer cheese...when we got the nachos they had barely any toppings or cheese, which is a huge bummer considering we already got them without an ingredient (steak) plus they forgot the sour cream! So the food was sub par but the bartender was friendly and made good drinks, and we know that mistakes happen, so we didn't complain! He was changing shifts, but didn't ask us to close out our tab...we offered so we could tip him out (we realize it's not easy being a bartender/server and would want the same if we were in his position)...little did we know we should've left when he did! After that, the manager plus TWO bartenders were in the bar area working...and while we got a lot of looks from all of them...they (one bartender) only offered us drinks ONCE in an hours time, even after we had told the main bartender that we wanted another round when we finished our current drinks! I can get past a night of shitty food...but no service or drinks while the MANAGER is right there and part of the problem, is completely unacceptable!"
Jacqueline C.,"Kirkland, IL",83,2,,1.0,3/15/2017,"Went in to celebrate my birthday, couldn't stand to stay until dessert. We sat at the bar, attempting to avoid children running around. It was nice until one of the servers sat a group of cackling little girls and their moms down behind us. My husband and I love eating the pretzels with beer cheese, this time however, they were undercooked and doughy. We attempted to explain this to the manager and bartending, the problem wasn't resolved. Our entrees came out, the mashed potatoes had bits of undercooked potato that were still crunchy. My husband ordered a shrimp skewer, it was also undercooked. Tonight was a huge disappointment for us. I don't see myself stopping into this location again. The staff seemed to be rushing everything. I don't expect to pay for food that I can prepare better myself."
Kevin T.,"Rochelle, IL",4,6,,1.0,8/5/2016,"Wife and I try Applebee's about once a year to see if we will be disappointed again. Once again they don't fail to underachieve. If I am paying $12 for a burger I hope to get a 1/2 lb patty or at least a 1/4 lb patty, this was even smaller.  It was just larger than a happy meal patty.  The burger was also supposed to have pulled pork on it, the single slice of cheese outmatched the pulled pork. A side of fries was on the plate, about 14 cold fries not able to cover their side of the small rectangular plate, as though someone had already eaten half. The server was nice, attentive, and personable. We tipped her well, what comes from the kitchen isn't her fault. My wife's meal was passable, mine was not. I believe I am done giving Applebee's second chances."
Marcus G.,"Dallas, TX",127,7,,1.0,2/11/2017,"DO NOT go here if you are Black. I went here with my girlfriend, and we experienced discrimination on two separate occasions. However, I'm going to reflect on the more prominent experience. I went to this Applebee's in DeKalb, IL on a Friday night around 7pm, and they were fairly busy. There was a 15 minute wait to be seated. My girlfriend and I were eventually seated about 3 minutes before the two parties consisting of all White people were seated after us, one was a party of two white people who were seated adjacent to us and the other was a group of three White people who were seated directly behind them. Both of these other parties were greeted by their waiter/waitress almost immediately as we just sat there looking puzzled. The party across from us had the same waiter as us, and the group of three had another. However, they both were acknowledged and received service at least 6 minutes before we did. I got more and more upset as we sat there and waited  to place our order. We watched our waiter, Dalton, pace up and down the aisle at least four times without acknowledging us. It gets worse, I didn't realize that the couple next to us didn't actaully place their order when Dalton initially greeted them. Dalton finally made it over to us about 6 minutes after speaking with them even though we were seated first. We placed our order immediately. Dalton then went over to the couple next to us 2 minutes after taking our order to take theirs. I expected my girlfriend and me  to get our food before both of the other groups not because we were seated first but becasue we had a simple order and the group next to us placed their order after us and the group behind them ordered three dishes. In conclusion, we got our food 12 minutes after both groups. Hence, why he received no tip. I pride myself on being extremely nice to everyone in the restaurants I go to and leaving great tips for great service. So I know it could not have been something I did to warrant such poor service. And to top it all off, the food wasn't even good, and we've had the same dishes before when they were busy and the dishes were good then. Thank you Dalton and Applebees for such a terrible heart-wrenching experience! I guess things will never change."
Jon B.,"Sycamore, IL",0,11,,5.0,9/16/2016,Wanted to thank Zabdiel (spelling) for going above and beyond for me tonight.  Wife just had a baby and is in the hospital yet and was craving an oriental chicken salad.  He was more than accommodating taking a to go order for me on a very busy evening.  THANK you!
Danica L.,"DeKalb, IL",45,17,13,2.0,3/27/2016,We were enjoying the food and atmosphere until a family sat down behind us and started playing games on Applebee's new table top video devices. I could have stayed home to hear video games. Will not be back.
Nathan J.,"Saint Charles, IL",188,118,137,3.0,3/1/2016,"You get what you pay for - $12 sandwich that compares to a TGI Fridays. Very kind waitress, checked on us multiple times to make sure we were all set. I'd go back, but nothing to bring the in-laws to."
Alison L.,"Denver, CO",414,104,57,5.0,1/3/2016,"People. It's Applebee's. If you didn't want the experience one gets at an Applebee's, why on earth did you choose to go to Applebee's?"
Luke H.,"Genoa, IL",0,9,,5.0,4/30/2016,"This AppleBees has great food, great service and good menu choices. It is definitely worth every dollar.  People who complain about prices should be mindful that there's quality in their food. So if you can't afford an extra $1.50 on a sandwich or steak, then you should not eat at AppleBees at all. AppleBees also have been making menu changes so the quality of everything has improved. I like the staff there, all of them trained in their jobs and highly recommend this location for any lunch or dinner needs!"
Dave T.,"Bartlett, IL",11,24,,3.0,8/25/2015,"Decent tasting food but way overpriced. Service was good, but not exceptional. Supposed to be unlimited fries with hamburger that cost around $11.00, never ask if I would like more. Hamburger and fries at the most would cost $7.00 elsewhere. I would not go back."
Norah C.,"West Chicago, IL",1,3,,1.0,6/2/2014,"I would give this zero stars if I could. The waitress didn't give us the time of day and when we did catch her, she was not friendly at all. She never cleared our dirty plates from our table even when it was to the point that we were stacking our empty plates and shoving them toward the edge so she would take them. Looking at nearby tables, the same thing was happening in our whole section. I ordered a margarita and I'm positive they didn't put any alcohol in it. It tasted like I was drinking kool aid with extra sugar. I did not get carded twice by people with bad attitudes just so I could not get a shot of tequila in my margarita. The worst part was the food. My boyfriend and I got the 2 for $20 deal. The spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer was watery and may or may not have actually contained artichokes. That would have been no big deal but the next part really threw the whole meal off. I ordered the steak. It came out grey. I cut into it and it was strangely undercooked on the inside while too chewy on the outside. The meat itself didn't look at all like steak. Imagine a meat the texture of tuna, the color of a street, which tastes like a block of salt. This is what I was served. I was concerned that the piece of meat had perhaps gone bad and finally complained to the waitress about it. She took my plate and said they would fix it. (Later we theorized that it had actually been ground beef- or maybe a mixture of ground meats- that got formed into a steak-like shape and thrown onto a George Foreman grill.) I don't send back food often but the few times I have in the past, the restaurant has completely replaced it. Not last night. They took my same ""steak"" and reheated it. I honestly think they put the whole plate in the microwave because it was super hot and the mashed potatoes that had almost cooled to an edible temperature were now back up to molten lava. The manager brought my plate back without saying anything except to ask me to cut into it. He didn't apologize for the mishap. He didn't offer to comp anything. He didn't even smile, ask if we needed refills of water (we did), or really do anything a person concerned with customer service would do.  In the midst of this, my friend used the restroom. When she returned, she said the floor was so sticky it started pulling off her shoes from her feet. When we got the bill, it somehow ended up more expensive than it should have been. We paid the bill as quickly as we could and got out of there. I felt queasy all night and as I am writing this I have a stomach ache, no doubt from the mystery meat I ate (not even half of) last night. Honestly, they need a new staff, some testing done on their meat, and a visit from the health inspector."
Lisa A.,"DeKalb, IL",0,16,,1.0,2/16/2016,"Terrible service at lunch and way too expensive.  Rather than seating us at a table that was already cleaned, the hostess went and cleaned a table (at ultra slow speed) before seating us. Gave up and sat at the bar.   Ordered a burger (no fries), side wedge salad, and 2 cokes - bill was over $20.  Salad came out with the wrong dressing.  Had to wait a long time to get the bill, which was wrong.  People sitting next to us got the wrong soup; they asked for the manager to bring a frequent lunch card - they waited for about 15 minutes and gave up and left."
Shannon R.,"Huntley, IL",38,83,34,2.0,6/13/2015,"Clean atmosphere and our waiter was new but fabulous/sweet.   We were seated near the bar at a table (location was fine).  The manager who greeted us was pleasant but allowed the bartender to be obnoxious to waitresses as well as to him.  That single person alone made the experience negative.   His loud arrogance and attitude made it very clear he was the one in charge... bluntly he was an ass. He talked down to the other employees and when the manager asked him a question the jag actually put his finger up to shush him and said,  ""I get to you in a minute"". The manager walked off. Seriously?! It was not a relaxing experience by any means."
Marie S.,"Sycamore, IL",2,13,5,3.0,5/8/2014,After not going to applebees for about 2years becausy boyfriend and son hated it. I am very pleased by the new menu. My bf has joined me twice here after trying it. There new menu has a great number of yummy choices and their new manager is doing an excelent job. The service is fast and friendly!
Dave Y.,"Sycamore, IL",223,191,50,4.0,12/24/2013,"The food in Applebees tends to be very consistent from location to location, which means we are never disappointed. The staff at this location is exceptionally friendly and the wait times are limited. Food is served quickly and prepared properly. If I had any complaints, it would be for some reason this locations seems to occasionally attract some rather boisterous groups, which can make for an unpleasant experience for everyone, however not much can be done  unless they severely cross the line. I would recommend."
Dan L.,"Rochelle, IL",0,20,6,2.0,2/25/2015,New Owners decided to change their chips and salsa to a mini cake pan with green and red salsa cups that resembles a thimble. Chips come out pre-crushed so they fit into the thimble. They will get you a refill upon request but management really needs to rethink their decision.
Nadine K.,"Rochelle, IL",0,1,,2.0,2/21/2015,The food was delicious but the poor waitress was running around like a crazy person.  I'm guessing because of understaffing. But serious I waited longer to get a box for my food then to actually get  my food. This is ridiculous.  Plus the crappy watered down drinks doesn't help.
Matthew K.,"DeKalb, IL",2,50,,2.0,4/2/2012,"Applebee's pretty much wrote the book on mediocre food, and the DeKalb location is a model for this mediocrity. You come to Applebee's because you want to get waited on, but you don't want to spend the money to go to a real restaurant.  When you discover the quality of the food in proportion to how much you spent, you realize you've been ripped off. In addition, the DeKalb location has serious service issues.  The last five times I've been there, there have been major issues with the service: orders forgetting to be placed, drink orders not delivered but still charged for, neglecting the table, chatting and joking with friends; the list goes on. The only possible reason to go to Applebee's is to watch sports at the bar, have a few drinks, and eat some pub grub.  It has a nicer atmosphere for this than, say, Buffalo Wild Wings where it is simply to loud."
Danielle T.,"Cortland, IL",0,1,,1.0,3/29/2014,"A few weeks ago they messed up my pick up order - twice! The same order - twice! Having to drive back and forth twice to this location was frustrating enough...I was given 4 -$5 off cards for my next purchase. My husband and I tried it again tonight and the cook apparently still can't get an order right. Manager called her cook lazy...you don't say that to a customer. You apologize and that's it. You don't demean your team. Needless to say, I am done with Applebee's."
Sadie P.,"DeKalb, IL",0,24,2,3.0,1/6/2014,This place is good because you know what to expect when you eat there. I never used to like Applebee's but their new menu gave me some better options and I was pleased with my meal!
Jeanna G.,"Neenah, WI",21,21,1,2.0,6/25/2012,"My husband and I have been here a few times since the beginning of 2012.  The food has been alright, and actually the fajitas are better than ever... but my complaint is directed more towards the service and the attitude of the staff. Our server (Mike, I think?) was okay, but he spoke way, WAY too fast for me to even understand him. I had to ask him to repeat himself several times. It was very hard to understand anything he was saying. We came to this location in the early dinner hours last Saturday night, and our order took well over 30-45 minutes to get to our table. It wasn't busy. I really didn't see the reason for the delay. While we waited, I noticed a couple sitting behind my husband complaining about their food.  One person ordered the fajitas and even took it back, because ""it was too spicy"".  So when I saw others having problems with their order (same server), that was a red flag. Also, I should add that I saw this same couple on our way home, and at a stop light, the lady actually got out of the car, and gave the driver behind them their food they didn't eat, from here! But anyway, I digress. Our food was okay. We both got burgers.  While we were eating, I noticed one of the hosts complaining, quite loudly. He complained about how bored and tired he was, and just wanted to go home.  He looked like he could care less about seating people.  (I believe attitude is everything, and if you're the first person a customer sees, show that you actually care, or at least fake it until you make it... don't complain within earshot. ) So, with  the extremely long wait and the weird vibe I got from our server (and his inability to speak slowly/clearly for customers to understand), I don't think we'll be coming back to this Applebee's. My husband even got sick after eating the bacon cheeseburger. If we want to go out to eat at a sit-down place we'll make the drive to Geneva or Lombard."
Frank D.,"St. Charles, IL",0,3,,2.0,3/14/2013,"Been here a couple of times, I don't know whats with this applebees, its just not up to par with the other ones i've been too. Service seems ok, however the food just does not seem as good."
Jenna C.,"DeKalb, IL",61,5,,2.0,1/24/2015,Everyone encountered here had a bad attitude. Bad customer service and mediocre food. Will not return.
Johanna J.,"Sycamore, IL",7,12,7,3.0,4/29/2011,Just tried the new Cajun pasta. Nothing to write home about. Wasn't bad but nothing special. I tried the won ton taco. Now that was good.
Pat E.,"Winfield, IL",91,739,71,3.0,4/15/2010,"Just an average place. Out waiter was very nice, I don't really like chains, but I got shrimp and rice, which was very good, but then again, it is pretty tough to mess up."
John L.,"Chicago, IL",221,322,50,1.0,5/11/2009,"I can't think of why anyone would eat at Applebee's, unless you don't have other choices.  The food is extremely bland, which I guess many people like bland food because there are over 1,500 of these abominations. I have eaten at Applebee's.  I had wings and some sort of pasta dish that was more boring than going on a date with a rake, more tedious to eat than mud, and almost as bland as plain rice cakes. I don't eat mud, but can imagine it being tedious."
Jesus F.,"El Paso, TX",0,23,,1.0,10/6/2011,"Food consistent as with any Applebee's, but the service was sub par, the hostess looked like she would rather be breastfeeding Tasmanian devils instead of having to be there. Then she gave me the worst seat in the place (which was almost empty), and I had to move to another table as I felt I was put on time out. Food came in, and the waiter brought two glasses of sierra mist, I guess he didn't want to be bothered either. Not going again."
Rachel S.,"DeKalb, IL",0,12,,4.0,2/22/2014,"Great Applebee's, friendly staff.  Enjoy the food assortment...they even accommodated us and made something off the old menu! Thank you!"
Brian K.,"Sycamore, IL",0,22,1,1.0,11/24/2012,"This place is flat-out LOUSY. The wife and I went back after they revised their menu and re-decorated. The place looks nice, I just wish they would actually make their food vs microwaving everything. If any of you think there is any kind of cook, you are very mistaken. The fries are so salty and ""seasoned"" they were not edible. I had the Ruben, and it was really nothing special. We will never go back. Go spend your money at the small mom and pop places. Big chains don't need your money."
Kevin P.,"Chicago, IL",2,16,,4.0,7/19/2009,"Most of the food i've had there is good, prices are a little high for the quality of food though. Wait staff has been attentive and our orders always come out quick, hot, and correct."
Andrea H.,"Sycamore, IL",37,3,,3.0,1/23/2011,"love applebees the people there are nice and friendly and have always served us well......just one thing, late night ordering is sooo not recommended, its like they get tired of being there n dont care so much bout the food at that time from the one experience i had....it was just not a good, but any other time its bin great :)"
Nicholas S.,"Chicago, IL",0,15,,4.0,11/6/2009,"Had a wonderful dinner here. Seating was comfortable. The appearance of the place was standard Applebee's, and clean. I had the smothered chicken and some shrimp -- it was delicious."
