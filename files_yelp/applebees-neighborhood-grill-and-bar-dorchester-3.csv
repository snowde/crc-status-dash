Allison J.,"Hollis, NH",248,12,5,4.0,10/6/2017,"Honestly do not understand the hate here. I am enjoying such a special birthday dinner with two of my closest girls. The 1 dollar margarita tastes like I'm in Cabo. The atmosphere feels like I'm at Disney. Don't ask me why, it just does. They made my friends birthday feel like the presidential inauguration. This is awesome. I highly suggest the you pick 3 appetizer option. See you soon, Abees."
Roshunda S.,"Edmond, OK",18,14,23,1.0,10/15/2017,We have the worst experience every time we go to this Applebee's! Horrible won't ever go back there!
Felicia C.,"Braintree, MA",24,3,,1.0,11/4/2017,Bad service- waitress should have stayed home because she was not feeling well. I didn't know this until I saw her feeling her head and talking with other staff. Sad that the manager would allow them to come to work and spread germs. I am so done with Applebee's.
Bella C.,"Dorchester, Boston, MA",0,2,,2.0,9/10/2017,"the one thing I'm going to say is stop bringing my damn food with your disgusting finger in my plate. I couldn't even eat my food after I saw the waitress' thumb in the plate almost touching my food. I get it's hard to carry a bunch of plates in your hands but seriously I would prefer you either bring them out one by one or at least get a f*cking cart to bring the food out. It's disgusting like seriously you guys need to train your stupid staff to carry the food with their hands UNDER the plate. I don't know where your fingers have been, I don't know if you even washed your hands, it's just disgusting. Do better. *EDIT I also forgot to add that the utensils are DISGUSTING. I understand it may be a pain in the ass to stand there and wash alllllll those dishes but when I picked up my spoon I noticed it had stains on it. It looks like they just water the utensils down and then put them back out. If you need to hire 10 people to wash and scrub dishes THEN DO IT. I don't want to eat my food with a fork or spoon that has stains on it from previous people using it. Literally made me want to puke. I ended up asking the waitress if they just had plastic utensils (the ones that come in the little bags). Ugh so disgusted."
Elva L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/17/2017,"Had a new definition of ""suck service"". My husband and I had a long day of moving to Boston, and this place is the nearest restaurant we could find. The waiter, male, around 50years old with glasses, was impatient to take our order, and it took him quite a long time to bring the food. What's worse, since the restaurant use an tablet-like screen on each table for customers to pay by themselves, I accidently hit 14% instead of 15% for the tips, which I didn't even realize that. When we about to leave, the waiter THROW the receipt on our table with a huge hand-draw CIRCLE of the suggested tips. When he passed by us, I heard him whisper ""F**K"" to us. I was so pissed off, but too tired to talk to his manager. But, it really hurt my first impression on Boston.  Never would come to this place again!!!!!!"
Ellen H.,"Beverly, MA",402,406,21,1.0,7/17/2016,"Why did I do this to myself? Well, actually I know exactly why. It's because I didn't feel like spending 2 hours in traffic when I could kill one having dinner and still make it home at the same time. I don't remember Applebee's sucking so hard. Maybe I've only ever had fried options so I was ill-prepared. I don't know. What I do know is I would have been better off at Olive Garden. Or the Pizza Hut Express in Target... Seriously. First of all, LOL at the sticky tables because according to my experience and prior reviews, these things have been sticky for years. Apparently same with the service: came in, empty lobby, went to bar area where one server said ""sit anywhere"", so I chose a 2-Top. Then the hostess came over and said ""Oh did you just walk in (like I wasn't supposed to). Sorry I was in the bathroom do you want a menu?"" .... Yes that sounds delightfully appetizing, thanks .... Best part of the experience was Howard, my server. Best manners I've ever encountered from a server or probably otherwise. He was just a nice guy and I always appreciate politeness, so thanks, Howard! Unfortunately, the food was laughable. My $11 salad was smaller than appetizer size. It was a single layer of lettuce on a plate, with cubed chicken (like the kind in a tub at Subway or something!), lackluster ingredients, and zero appeal. I ate it slowly while reading reviews of this place and it was still gone in 5 minutes and I'm still hungry, but refuse to shell out another penny for that quality of food. Blech. So, I obviously won't be coming back -- completely based on portions and food quality. ** Note: after I finished this review, I went to the bathroom, where one server was on her cellphone texting, clearly hiding from her manager. Meanwhile the bathroom was a hot mess. Went outside to leave and two more servers were standing right outside the building smoking and using less-than professional language. I'm not a Sensitive Sally, but talk like that either far away from the entrance, or on your own time! Dropped to 1 star!"
Jim K.,"ROSLINDALE, MA",105,10,3,2.0,9/3/2017,Our meals were tasty and a good value but service was very inattentive. Will return nonetheless but hope for a better server.
Julie D.,"Lynn, MA",87,6,,2.0,9/20/2017,"I used to love Applebee's, until my last visit, I might never go back. Our waitress, I forgot her name and I don't want to sound insensitive but she has a big tooth in the front  (I'm so sorry ) was very forgetful and our drinks took pretty long. She doesn't seem to know enough about the menu because she seemed lost and didn't know the answer to some of our questions. She bought over the wrong foods and tried to tell US that they were and that we ordered this even though we didn't. Plus the food was pretty basic. It was bland and nothing special like it usually is. It was not worth the price. This really turned me off from Applebee's, I used to love you guys so much but, it's time to say goodbye. And I'm not one to write bad reviews but after this experience...I had to."
Aly I.,"Johnston, RI",4,20,6,1.0,3/11/2017,"Called in a 2 for $20 meal at 10:30, arrived at 11pm, and they were dead.  I sat at the pick up area, nobody saw or spoke to me for about 15 minutes.  Finally got up and spoke to someone to hurry things along.  Got food stacked up in two ripped bags -- asked ""could I have another bag, are these sturdy?"", they replied yes.  I got two steps out of the building, artichoke dip is all over everything after a bag splits.  I go back in, ask for bags, saying my bag broke.  No real apology, no offer to rebag things for me.  Was an overall horrible experience.  Get back to the hotel, everything is ice cold, and one entrees is wrong. This place was horrible, do not go here."
Michael R.,"Natick, MA",5,22,5,3.0,1/12/2017,Went there for lunch after having been there last about two years ago. I think it will be another two years before I go back. Service was friendly but slowwww. It was not crowded so I can't blame it on that. The burger and fries were ok but nothing special. Tasted like a standard frozen patty that is frozen with an odd shape to make it look like it was fresh. Fries heavily salted but satisfactory. In the end one of my biggest complaints was the electronic tablet menu/bill device. As far as my friend and I could tell there was no option to pay the bill in cash. We waited about five minutes for the server to return but they seemed to busy talking to members of the opposite sex. We ended up paying by card just to get out of there.
Joshua S.,"Boston, MA",0,5,,1.0,12/21/2016,"If good service is important to you, don't bother coming to this location. Literally wasted an hour just now.  Sat down, our server got us our drinks and appetizer within the first 10 minutes. Then, she never stopped by our table again for the next 50 minutes, even when we pushed for the ""call server"" button after 20 minutes of waiting.  Our server literally walked around the divider in the middle of the restaurant instead of walking past our table. After she dropped off our appetizer she ran away like we had ahe plague (and we aren't even sick!). There were about 3 other servers who walked by our table and no one thought to ask if we were doing okay or went to get our server. After an hour we just paid and left.  Is it really THAT hard to just get our order? It takes like, less than a minute.. We went in being nothing but nice.  The pretzel and beer cheese appetizer was good though, but our server cost this location anything higher than a 1 star. The pretzels (and yelp, by mainly yelp) saved this location from getting no stars at all.  I will be taking this place off my ""I'm starving and just want cheap fat food, but not to the extent of McDonald's and Co."" list."
Louisa M.,"Methuen, MA",0,46,,3.0,6/8/2017,"What a disappointment. We picked Applebee's over Olive Garden. Huge mistake! The place was just about empty yesterday afternoon.  If u do not use the computer like way of ordering u do not get waited on. I ordered onion soup, bowl, and salad. Salad was ok however my bowl of soup was half full and small. While everyone was nice but that did not make up for skimpy soup and ok salad. Had to get someone to get our waitress twice. Once when we were first seated. No one came. Had to get someone to find our waitress. Got a drink but had to flag her down again for another drink. To bad as they have what it takes but just seems as if the wait staff could care less about service. U will still be hungry when u leave. My sisters meal was ok. Way to much to go through for not enough food and disappearing wait staff. Oh well it is not like the Applebee's up my way."
Sasha M.,"Somerville, MA",148,140,216,2.0,1/5/2016,"Ok...so first off, I never liked Applebee's at all but I decided to come here with my sister last night on a whim because it was convenient. My sister wanted to sit at the lounge side instead of the restaurant and at most places we go to, you get to grab any seat or 2-top and the bar/lounge server will be there to service you.... My sister and I grabbed a 2-top and as I was putting my bag down, this man (server) told us to go back to the front and someone will seat us. Alright, so I was thinking, ""new policy? new thing? I never heard of it"" And as my sister and I were walking out to the front, the woman said, ""No, you can go back in and sit down wherever...you don't need us to seat you"" RED FLAG there for me...already I was getting bad vibes.  While we were waiting for a server, we saw that gentleman half ass walking toward us and then flagging down the other server to grab our table. I THINK that they don't do sections for bar areas, but I could be mistaken. He wasn't particularly friendly to us but was busy flirting with a hightop nearby most of the time we were there.  ANYWAY, I digress....our server was named Maria, she was the sweetest! I was so happy that she was our server instead of the man from before. I ordered a burger & fries which came out quickly and was very tasty. For drinks, I ordered a Gin Martini. I definitely should have thought twice on it because it was terrible to swallow but I forced myself to drink it. Maria asked me how it was and looked so worried so I told her it was fine because she was just so nice. I had to order a Sprite to chase my martini with.  Overall........Maria is the only reason why I even gave any stars to this place. I will NEVER come back here again...I'll take my chances ANYWHERE else."
Amress B.,"Boston, MA",2,36,37,2.0,10/17/2016,Fries tasted like cardboard . They were so gross .   The waitress was nice but seemed really stressed out and It was making us uncomfortable .  She didn't know the beer prices when my bf asked . If she offered to go check he would have gotten a beer but he ended up not getting one .  The mozz sticks and chicken tenders were a 6out of 10..
Nijkah M.,"Boston, MA",196,1,,1.0,6/3/2017,"Me and my coworker came into Applebee's at 9:05. We were seated & forgotten about. It took them until 9:35 just to come and ask us if we needed drinks. They took 15 mins to bring 2 sodas & a margarita , which was watered down! A whole passed and still no food has been brought to us. .. it sucks here! & servers wonder why they never get tips!"
Roscoe G.,"Boston, MA",90,1,3,1.0,10/26/2016,I came to Applebee's tonight to have a drink dinner and watch the  game but as I was sitting at  the I noticed  rodents running around above my head my night ended with taking my meal.
Jeffrey C.,"Dorchester Center, Boston, MA",0,1,,1.0,4/25/2017,"This place sucks , food was cold and after being seated it takes the waitress 20 minutes too take you're order and the place is empty."
Brittany H.,"Mashpee, MA",0,2,1,1.0,3/25/2017,"Found a piece of CHEWED gum in my French fries. The manager refused to give me a refund over the phone unless I came in, I live out of town so I offered to email a copy but they refused. Horrendous don't go here"
Spiro G.,"Dorchester Center, Boston, MA",0,5,1,5.0,2/22/2017,"This is my place. When I'm having a tough week, I can always rely on a good time--food and staff. The staff is always friendly and consistently gives great suggestions! The food is fantastic... if you haven't tried cheeseburger egg rolls, you need to now!"
Joe R.,"Quincy, MA",16,20,7,2.0,7/27/2016,"I would avoid this restaurant. I went in with my mother for a simple lunch. It took a few minutes for someone to greet us at the door and seat us. Then several minutes for our server to show up. We then waited approximately 30 minutes just to receive our drinks. When the food came (well, most of it), they brought the wrong food and forgot the soup. I had ordered a lunch combo and they didn't put it in as a combo. They gave me the mac an cheese but didn't put the chicken with it as I requested. My mom ordered the onion soup as did I. She got her soup right away, but mine didn't come until we were done with everything else. I should note that the place wasn't too busy and the server didn't seem too concerned with the speed of everything. I was hoping this place would be good since it's so close to my house, but I won't be returning."
Richard R.,"Lynn, MA",0,6,,2.0,2/4/2017,As I'm here with my friend waiting for our main entrees. There's a young female employees screaming and cussing at another employee.   So loudly that the whole restaurant got quiet and turned around to see the commotion   We are also waiting for a while for our food.   I have to say that though the food is really good.
Peter Y.,"Greenfield, IN",4,203,88,2.0,4/9/2016,"Not recommended. I ordered ribs and they were burnt and the side were horrible, especially the fries, they are completely soft. In addition, the price is unexpectedly high. Even though they barely have any service here. They recommend you pay 20% tip. Hilarious."
Tee T.,"Hyde Park, Hyde Park, MA",0,3,,1.0,7/1/2017,My chicken wantons was not crispy to much Sauce. The bartender Wendy is very judgmental listen to the way she rips apart customers the bartender my wantons was so soggy.
Gerald N.,"Boston, MA",151,419,244,4.0,6/4/2015,"Pretty nice applebees conveniently located in the strip mall. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is nice. There's electronic pay stations at each table which surprised me. Got the spinach dip and it came out hot and the chips weren't salty at all. Also got the riblets and they are good for a snack. Hot and juicy!  Overall, I'd come back for a late night snack."
CHACHI M.,"Boston, MA",98,8,10,2.0,9/26/2016,"Came for drinks and apps. The calm chowder cost $5 and they didn't even fill it to the brim..it had half of what it was supposed to. And it wasn't  appetising.  Iasked for a beer and was brought out  obviously dirty glasses on 2 separate occasions after asking for a clean one. We asked for a combo plate and they ran out of mozerella sticks..it's only 8pm.. I'll only be back for drinks in a bottle,no drafts..nothing else..in other words this place is a No"
Anthony D.,"Boston, MA",2,9,,1.0,9/11/2016,"Two words, ""don't go"" longest service ever for microwaved food. I thought this place was getting better."
Alisson D.,"Boston, MA",35,11,24,3.0,12/17/2014,For a chain restaurant food was not bad. Our server Chantel was very nice to us!!! Perfect Margarita was good. They bring a shaker to keep that cool.
Trung B.,"Boston, MA",0,46,2,1.0,2/27/2017,"This place is poorly ran by mgmt and I can tell staff hate to work there, but have to make their ends meet. Sat down with my family with young kids quite fast this time. Waitress Kimberley  F. served us and was quite nice and pleasant. I can see the hostess is being pushy ordering her around to clear the tables, but hello, she is serving us at the moment. She took our order and then told us that many items on the menu were out of the food, such as shrimp, kids chicken tenders, and a few entrees. Also, they were out of apple juice, which my two kids wanted. Ordered and substituted on the food selections as my kids were hungry. Food came at quite a good pace, but a little slower than what I have experienced at the Quincy Applebees. My food was dried as sh!t and I had to request gravy or some sauce just to moist my food (ordered the steak tips with mash potatoes and onion rings on top). The onion rings were not crunchy and were soaked in grease. The guests on the other table waited for more than an hour to be seated and for food to come out and they were heated and the table behind me had their orders mixed up with other patrons. First, I think mgmt needs to be retrained on how to manage a restaurant and how the kitchen functions, as when foods comes out,the servers are all taking random dishes and serving their customers. It was chaotic and unorganized restaurant/establishment. Pretty much the kitchen is hurting the servers on their performances and obviously they will be tipped less due to the unorganized kitchen. How on Earth a franchise be out of foods and not tell the servers ahead of time before customers order? This branch should be shut down due to lack of menu selections, poor kitchen quality foods, and unmanageable environment. It was one of the worst dinner I had with my family in my life!"
Beth R.,"Boston, MA",158,393,111,3.0,12/26/2015,"Surprisingly, I like this Applebee's. I'm usually not too fond of the chain, but this location wasn't bad. The service was average & attentive when needed and the atmosphere was comfortable. Obviously, the menu is the same everywhere, but the drinks were right on. I love their Coronaritas."
Neese P.,"Boston, MA",122,2,1,1.0,8/26/2016,The worst restaurant I've ever been to. Employees were unorganized and took forever to seat us when the restaurant wasn't busy at all. It took over 20 minutes just for a waitress to take our order for drinks!!!! I counted over 20 employees and half of them were slacking off doing nothing. I will never come here again I'm so disappointed I didnt even stay for food!!
Ann H.,"Boston, MA",6,42,25,4.0,5/6/2016,"The service was great, waitress was super fast. Food mostly turned out great. The resturant is a bit sticky but... it's fine. This is my to go place ."
Maggie S.,"Boston, MA",0,8,,2.0,8/26/2016,"Eh. Id come here to get a beer/glass of wine and belly up to the bar but not much else.  I walked in and sat at the bar and ordered a house margarita. The bartender Kellee was incredibly nice and service was quick. She kept the bar clean and did a great job. That being said - the margarita was terrible. Not her fault but I couldn't even finish it. I ordered a tall glass of wine instead and got a great pour.  Ordered a few apps and was pretty disappointed in the size, presentation and taste of the food. The pretzels were falling off the plate, only got 5 tiny shrimp tossed haphazardly on the plate and just didn't taste all that great. I really wanted to enjoy this because the bartender was so good. I wish they'd fix the food because they have the potential. I'll be back for Kellee and a glass of wine but not much else."
Erin O.,"Boston, MA",46,7,,2.0,12/27/2016,"My parents and I got takeout dinner here on Christmas Eve because it was the only place open near the hotel. I had the brunch burger and my parents shared the Southwestern Salad. We both ordered medium rare, but everything ended up pretty well done. We had emphasized that we wanted medium rare to the guy manning the takeout counter, and he definitely put it down, I guess the kitchen just doesn't know how to cook it. The burger was good otherwise, nothing special. The steak on the southwestern salad was so extremely tough though, you had to chew for a solid minute before you could swallow it. I don't think I've ever had such a tough steak. I also got an raspberry iced tea, which I thought was regular iced tea with a flavored syrup but tasted more like the cheap Brisk tea. My father and I had a cocktail each while waiting for the takeout, he had a Myers & Tonic and I had the raspberry cosmo. He said his was good, but I couldn't taste the alcohol in mine at all. For some people that's a good thing, but I like to know that I actually have alcohol in my drink if I'm paying $9 for it. Both the bartender and takeout guy were super nice and really accommodating, but the food/drink is ehh overall."
dajian x.,"North Andover, MA",6,140,1,1.0,8/18/2016,"I made a mistake on reading a hand written sign.  I asked the waiter who called a manager and corrected me.  The waiter disappeared.  I waited and waited.  Finally, I went to the bar and asked for a waitperson. I waited and ordered with my son.  For an appetizer, we ordered chicken wings.  The waitperson disappeared.  After over 1/2 an hour we left. On the way out my son told me the manager said to take their time serving me, Hearing this I would give this place minus 10."
Errieana T.,"Boston, MA",42,32,4,3.0,7/27/2016,"I went in and had a great dinner with my friend and our waiter Rafi was awesome and very observant. although the food was rushed and slightly warm. That is the only thing you guys have to work on the food,sauce and appetizers, the drinks are fine and desserts."
Taryn S.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",1,31,,5.0,1/21/2016,"A few years ago I went to Applebee's for a normal meal. The food I got was a hamburger, macaroni and cheese, and fruit. For the people who are vegetarians, there are lots of salads and they are a big hit! I would give this restaurant 5 stars because the food comes quickly. The service is good because the people there treat you very well. It's quite a lot of money but they make it up to you by giving you the best food in Boston.  - Written by Ms.Taryn's third grade student, Iyla L."
Josie G.,"Boston, MA",349,216,20,3.0,4/16/2015,"Exactly what it says, this place is A-OK. I've been here a few times since my last post in 2010 (!!!) - usually after I pick up stuff at Target or Old Navy.  The bartenders have been attentive, and beers are cheap.   The food isn't anything special.  It all tastes quite similar to something that you'd buy in the frozen section and re-heat, but what do you expect?  It's a chain! It's what you think it would be."
Kethlaine M.,"Boston, MA",228,33,16,2.0,4/19/2016,I've been here numerous times with my boyfriend and we've had phenomenal service. But the last 2 times that I've popped in with my best friend and my family it hasn't been the greatest. Maybe sticking with the bar service would be more ideal seeing that's where I tend to receive the best service (food and beverage)
Vel S.,"Randolph, MA",0,27,,1.0,5/6/2016,"Went to this Restaurant on Wednesday. Service was terrible, food was cold and there appeared to be a pair of used sneakers on the sink at the Bar.  I complained to the Manager and he appeared to be unconcerned and suggested I contact the General Manger. The General Manger also showed a lack of concern for the condition and poor service.  From all the negative reviews maybe they will be joining the Braintree and the Chestnut Hill Restaurants soon."
Michelle B.,"Nashville, TN",157,26,1,5.0,12/10/2014,"Stellar! From the moment we walked in & the host held the door open (especially appreciated in this rain!) & he was so polite & friendly. You could tell he was genuine with his ""how are you?"". Our waitress Ashlee was great too, very kind & attentive & our food came out in decent time & was delicious. Manager was walking around checking in on customers as well, which I always give kudos for. All four of us in my party felt it was a great experience & while at the table we said ""we have to yelp this!"" Kudos Applebees! :)"
