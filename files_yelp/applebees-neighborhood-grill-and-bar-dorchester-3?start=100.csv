Irina G.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,34,4,3.0,3/24/2008,"As a lover of fine dining and someone who works in the restaurant business, I'm kind of embaressed to say that Applebee's has been one of my better dining experiences in Boston so far. But it's true! I've been to this location several times (I prefer it to the Quincy location), and I have yet to be disappointment. (Of course, my expectations are never very high to begin with.)  The waitstaff is always polite and prompt. Burgers are always good. I've had the appetizer trio thingy, with mozzarella sticks, steak fajita tower things, and the spinach and artichoke dip, which was very filling and delicious. So whenever I feel like some good old fashioned greasy fried cheesy yummy food, and a fun, casual dining experience, I go to Applebee's."
Rachael D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,,3.0,6/13/2012,"We came here because there was a wait at Olive Garden, and there was no wait at Applebee's. Now, I'd rather be at Cracker Barrel, but without one around... To start off, the host seemed surly, or maybe just mysterious. He is probably just a nice guy, but hates working at Applebee's. Who can blame him. The quick seating gave it an initial 4 stars. The atmosphere is very nice, with colourful warm tones and carpets. It is generally friendly, and we were seated in an enormous booth, with a great view of the. Olive Garden. Although the booth could have easily sat 30, we were comfortable. However, seated next to us was a loud woman. Applebee's is responsible for my broken eardrums. Onward to the meal. The boneless buffalo wings were adequately boneless. However, we ordered mild, and what we got was nothing short of fire. I survived. We ordered many things, including the Orange Crispy Chicken. The chicken was fair to good, but was sitting on a swamp of rice. I was confused, and think it must have been a mistake. The gorgonzola pecan/walnut salad was great, but a little cheese heavy. That's probably not what Olive Garden would do. The fajitas, which seemed to be the only vegetarian meal, was way oversalted. Overall, the experience was not terrible. My grandma had a shrimp dish which she said was very nice. Anyways, the dessert shooters made up for everything. My one last complaint: where are the after dinner mints like at Olive Garden?"
Carol P.,"Boston, MA",0,1,,1.0,4/19/2012,"I stopped by with my boyfriend and two other friends today and we experienced the worse customer service ever. We were seated by the host and about 20 minutes later, the waitress (I think her name was Dana) decided to come over for our orders. At this point my patience was running really low and was so close just to get up and leave. Anyways, when she came over, my boyfriend had asked her to start us up with drinks. She answered, ""I already saw you guys with drinks."" WTHeck?? Are you serious?? Did she just expected us to stick with our coffee and not to order drinks?? So I let it slide and I ordered a Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp meal with extra onions. My boyfriend and friends ordered their salad and soup without cheese. We waited another excruciating 30 minutes or more for our food. We had came around noon time. The restaurant was not even busy so this was unacceptable. I wanted to ask HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE 3 SALADS AND A MEAL ON A SHIZZLING PLATE?? So my meal came out first and I did not touch it because I wanted to wait for my friend's meals to come out too. A few moment later our waitress came back and apologize to me. She said that the meal in front of me was not suppose to be mine and wanted it back. I let her take it back to see what she would do with it. She then bought this plate that was on my table to another table for another person. DISGUSTING. I can not help but wonder if this is what the employees at applebees are trained to do.. Seriously, how can you do that to your customers? Never coming back. I rather spend a couple more bucks on Olive Garden next door. If I can give this place no stars then I would!"
Julian M.,"Redwood City, CA",55,35,6,3.0,10/20/2007,"It's an Applebee's. I just wanted to add it since Yelp doesn't seem to have it yet. Since it's new the interior is pretty clean, with the usual bar space and whatnot. This one tends to run out of popular menu items."
Jenn G.,"Brooklyn, NY",150,69,2,5.0,10/24/2007,"I am giving this totally standard Applebee's 5 stars because I spent who knows how many months waiting for it to open. I remember the original hope that maybe it would be a Fridays, and a friend telling me it was going to be an IHop. Then, finally, an Applebee's. Living a few blocks away there was nowhere to eat. Staff was nice enough, food was what was to be expected. This place was packed all the time.  I have since moved to Chicago, can someone please tell me what opened next door? My guess was on Olive Garden."
MR ..,"Boston, MA",1,55,,2.0,11/4/2007,was there for a light dinner recently with a good friend  - we did not order an app but for entree we had a chicken dish and a seafood salad. the chicken was ok  it was loaded with cheese - the seafood salad was ok as well  - it was not filling  and was very light. The service was pretty quick and the place was very busy including the bar area. We did not wait for a seat as well (olive garden next door had a 45 min wait)
Tracie M.,"Dorchester, MA",3,15,,2.0,11/28/2008,french onion soup was gross. mashed potatoes were OK. sangria was watered down. service sucked and they knew it and they were friendly about knocking the price down.
Alexis M.,"Hyde Park, Boston, MA",13,25,,1.0,1/8/2012,"Maybe it was just ""one of those days"" for both the kitchen and front of the house staff but.......service was BAD.  My husbands steak ordered mid rare was overcooked, I ordered mine rare and it came to me medium (I'm a line cook at a fine dining establishment on Newbury street, so believe me....I KNOW my proper temps for meat!).  We finished our first rounds of beers and left the empty bottles sitting on the edge of the table to catch the waitress's attention for a re-up and she walked by several times and didn't even look our way.  Had to nearly jump out of my seat and literally grab her to get her attention.  Our apps were forgotten about and didn't even come to the table until 3/4 way through our MAIN COURSE and the order of the app trio was still wrong after reminding her twice about which trio we ordered.  FOH management kept walking through the dining room asking people if they were satisfied (minus US for some reason!)  which is the first sign they are having trouble (that day only???) with service here in the ghetto of South Bay.  Bad time there for the second time though, so I have no hopes for the future here.  Bad location."
David C.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,56,,1.0,5/13/2009,This place is... ridiculously dirty. I wanted at least mediocre service but didn't find it here.
April M.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,35,4,1.0,12/21/2009,"First of all the hostess had a sloppy appearance,  she was not warm or welcoming and her behavior was erratic.  Got to our table our waitress comes out looking like she had one too many drinks!  Glassy eyed and was way too close into my personal space when taking my order she nearly sat in my lap!!! After ordering we waited and waited and waited. . .our waitress had gone MIA.  Finally when the guests who came in after us got there food before we did I finally had to get up and talk to a manager.  None of the other waitresses knew where ours was. The manager came back to our table to find out what the issue was then suddenly our waitress reappears along with some other nasty looking guy from the kitchen with black painted fingernails.  Bottom line I complained about the poor service and the manager apologized and give us a discount on the bill.  I will never go back there.  I get the feeling that they are hiring women who are in drug recovery and if that is the case , along with that comes their ex-dealers and ex-boyfriends coming in for a free ""hookup"" meal etc. . .the whole atmosphere is sooo unprofessional.  HORRIBLE restaurant.  If you must have Applebee's go to the Brighton or Walpole, MA locations."
Dean B.,"Hyde Park, Boston, MA",0,8,,1.0,10/2/2010,"It took me a while to write this review. It took two years for me to write it. I went to Applebee's with a couple of friends on a Monday night. This was our former hangout on Monday nights. We went in at around 5PM. The attendant brought us to our tables. A little later, the waitress came. She asked us what drinks we wanted. I said I wanted a ""Fizzler,"" or something along those lines. She did not know what that was. So I had to show her. She must have been a new waitress. Anyway, 15 minutes went by and we still did not receive our drinks. We spent most of the time waiting. It was almost hilarious at how bad the service was. At one time, she sat down next to us, and said, ""you are not in a hurry are you?"" I could not believe it. It happened that there was a leak in the kitchen, however, they did not have the sense to let us know that, and instead we were waiting. I don't know why we did not have the sense to get up and leave like others did, as this waitress kept on coming back another 10 minutes later as if nothing was wrong. In fact the way we found out about the leak is that we overheard them speaking. It was not until 7PM that we left, and my friends and I decided that we would never go to that Applebee's again."
Kristen k.,"Boston, MA",0,5,1,1.0,3/16/2009,"DISSAPPOINTING. I am almost positive that my steak was microwaved. The service was absolutely terrible. The waitress sat around a table with her friends pretty much the whole time not to mention she looked completely doped out. The environment sucked. Bill came to $40 for me & my boyfriend..terrible mistake, wasnt even worth it. go nextdoor to olive garden if you want a good meal."
John Paul N.,"Boston, MA",16,78,,1.0,3/1/2009,"I didn't want to do a review of Applebees, ashamed that we actually dined here last Thursday night, but our experience was so bad that we had to let the public know. As far as chains goes, Applebees is probably my least favorite.  I have Red Robin and Chili's well ahead it.  Let me also preface this review by saying we only went to Applebees because we had a plan to go to South Bay to pick up some DVDs that just came out and go to Stop and Shop for some groceries to make dinner, but I had to work late so by the time we got to South Bay, both of us were starving and we decided to settle for Applebees. We've been to this Applebees once before and it was a horrible experience.  Fool me once, shame on you... So we sit at the bar area at some hightops and it takes us forever to make up our minds on what we want.  That's our own fault.  Finally I decided on the 9 oz steak with topped off baked potato, with instructions for the steak to be medium rare and the potato to not have sour cream.  Abby got some herb chicken thing.  And so we waited...and waited...and waited.  Finally the waiter comes by and tells us that our meal is coming out shortly.  This is a tactic I don't understand at all.  If our food is coming out shortly, then just bring it out, don't tell us in advanced.  I mean, is that suppose to make us feel better?  All I know is we waited another 10 minutes and no food.  Our waiter did come out to tell us that our dinner was being plated right now and should be out soon.  I really wished he didn't tell me that, because it took nearly another 10 minutes before our food was being brought out.  The gave me time to think that my steak was probably getting overcooked by sitting under the heatlamp.  Sure enough, our food comes out and there's sour cream on my potato.  (Oh yeah, the waiter didn't write down our order either, he was one of those ""I'll remember it all"" types.)  I mention this and the runner said she can take it back.  I'm so hungry, I really don't care.  That's when I decided to check my steak, and sure enough, tougher than a boot's sole and well overdone.  I tell her I ordered medium-rare and she said she'll have them refire a steak.  Fine, I can live with that.   Again, we wait for what seems like forever.  A 9oz steak cooked at medium-rare should take 8 minutes top.  After 20 or so minutes, and two different people assuring me that my food was coming out soon, we decided we had enough and that we wanted to speak to the manager.  He comes out and says that the steak is almost ready, but I tell him we just want to pay for Abby's meal and to leave.  He tells me the steak will be free and we can take it to go, but I really don't want it.  I tell him no and that we just want our check and want to  leave.  He says to not worry about the bill but if I wanted to leave a tip for the waiter that would be great.  Normally I wouldn't leave squat, but I felt this time it wasn't the waiter's fault and leave him a couple of bucks. Fool me twice, shame on me.  It was our own fault to go to Applebees.  We know their food suck and their service is just as bad.  However, it shouldn't take an hour to get a medium rare steak out to a customer, not once, but twice.  I give Applebees at South Bay a 0 out of 5.  (I gave it a one, but it's really a 0.)"
