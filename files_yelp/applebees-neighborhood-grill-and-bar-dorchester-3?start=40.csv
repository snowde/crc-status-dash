Eddaliz D.,"Boston, MA",15,19,4,1.0,3/25/2016,Never again ! order for pickup - when i got back to work that i opened the plate i guess they added the water from the vegetables all over my loaded potatoes. my steak was frozen in the middle. i asked for it well done and payed extra for caramelized onions which were never added. the vegetables were stale and no taste. over it !
Carly S.,"Milford, CT",130,11,,1.0,3/21/2016,"Horrible service. Drinks, appetizers, and food took too long to come out. My server was hardly ever at our table, or passing by it to call her over. The portions of the steak were so small. Saw two women get into a fight with each other in the restaurant, then saw a man and a woman get into a fight. Not the best experience. Would not come back."
Nguyen S.,"Dorchester, Boston, MA",12,4,6,1.0,11/28/2014,"I and my friend came on Monday. The host seated us. We waited for 15 minutes and no one greeted or offered water. The waitress who was serving the table next to us kept passing by, looking at us and never care to offer water. I am sure we seated in her section. All of her tables had food.  We waited for 15 mins and still didn't get any water or even know who is our server.  We then decided to leave. We told the host that we waited for too long and she did not apologize.  She only looked at us and did not say anything.  This is the most terrible experience I've ever had."
Ansia F.,"Boston, MA",17,63,39,2.0,4/17/2014,"I really hate to give this place 2 stars; the food is great and I love coming here after wok with my best friend to stuff our faces, drink and chat. But this rating is based solely on my experience at the bar. My best friend and I came in around 2 PM and headed straight to the bar. It wasn't really busy I'd say there were 3 other people ahead of us ordering drinks which was fine we had some catching up to do anyway. About 10 minutes into our wait my friend ask the young bartender when could we give her our orders. She rolled her eyes and said, ""Give me a few.""  my friend and I exchanged glances but decided to let it roll off our backs and wait a little while longer.  10 more minutes go by. Okay. Now I'm really getting annoyed. The two young bartenders were cracking jokes and flirting with one of the customers. They seemed to ignore the attempt of my friend and I trying to grab their attention. By the time one of them mosey her ass on over I was over it. Got up from the stool and left out. Never been back and it's really unfortunate because up until then I'd never had a problem. But I'd rather spend my money at a bar that has quality customer service."
Scott N.,"Boston, MA",1,3,,2.0,11/17/2015,Crappy. Have to head out of town tomorrow stopped for a bite between errands. No point giving a blow-by-blow of the experience.  Servers were rude and the food was bad.  All you need to know. Two stars because at least the manager got involved twice without my asking (it was that bad) so that's something.
J R.,"Boston, MA",10,59,17,4.0,7/26/2014,"Four stars Applebee's because of our server Patrice and the host Chris. Both were accommodating, customer friendly and pleasant. Chris went out of his way to make sure we had the seat that we wanted. While our sever Patrice took the extra step and had the bar make a drink that wasn't on the menu. She was hovering, checked in when appropriate and was very likable.  Most importantly she got our order correct! Food pretty good. Love the 2 for $20/$25 deal.  Thanks Applebee's!"
Emily C.,"Boston, MA",23,28,4,1.0,1/29/2014,"This place is the pits. Sat at the bar and the bartender was drinking on the job - classy. Pouring booze into her iced coffee. Contacted corporate and told them the whole story. The GM of the restaurant called me and basically said, ""Oh... sorry"" and said he would send a gift card for the inconvenience. Yea, that never happened.  Avoid at all costs!"
Jess D.,"Salem, MA",0,5,1,5.0,5/29/2016,"Great food, great service. Food arrived fast, appetizers were great. Piña coladas were great. There was not wait, surprised for memorial weekend. Wendy was our server, she was great and sweet."
Addie M.,"North Chelmsford, MA",114,221,107,4.0,6/9/2014,"So, I'm not typically a huge fan of bar food and restaurant chains such as this one (or chili's, or anything in the genre) Buttt.. apple bees serves food late, and that can be a super convenience.  My fiancé and I travel to Boston/dorchester area on Wednesdays, and around 9/10 pm this is where we stop! Food is quick and that's a good thing sometimes. I just have to say, PHIL IS AWESOME! Honestly, the entire staff rocks our socks. we always come in with 10-20 people, and they always accommodate us, with a smile, no hesitation and an eager jump to serve us. I hope they don't think we come in and try to take over or ""run anything"". We really do just come in, tired, hungry and looking for a good time with our friends! I don't think we've ever had an issue. Maybe minor things here and there, but never anything that ruins our experience.  It would just be nice if the new manager didn't mope around- the other manager used to approach us with a smile and ask us how are meal was. I give the waitstaff 5 stars, and you 2 stars. Step up the par! your team rocks and we come for them. Thank you for letting 20 of us come in late on wednesday nights. We hope the tip is always worth it!"
Nicole M.,"Boston, MA",1,20,11,3.0,5/6/2015,"Since this review, service has been a bit better. We ended up going back 2 times within the past 7 days to put it to the test. New and more management staff on hand. Lots of new faces, some still the same. I believe its new management at night too, which is greatly appreciated. The only complaint I have now is that our waitress had been arguing with another waitress in front of guests....pretty unprofessional.....We ended up tipping both. The one who started the argument recieved a bit less than the one who wasn't trying to argue......Besides that, I can say we have had pretty okay experiences....so hopefully it lasts."
Mandy D.,"Everett, MA",2,7,1,5.0,7/31/2015,"Great customer service, great food, love the margarita. The combo 2 meals and 2 side salads for $25 is a great price. One of my favorites of all times."
Dj M.,"ROXBURY CROSSING, MA",195,14,3,3.0,9/2/2015,Cool bartenders  but not so much liqour selections and beer on tap  needs to be updated to beers that's not at every other bar . Wait Staff needs training on when not to swear in front of guest and be more inviting . Food is decent salmon is overrated salad are drenched with salad dressing too much .
Natassha D.,"Boston, MA",30,128,96,5.0,4/26/2014,"Love this place Amazing staff and management! Was eating with my cousin from out of town here the waiter accidentally dropped our food let's just say because we had to wait for them to re due our order for a longer time  "" On The House!!!"" I loved that!! I still gave him a handsome tip for his work"
Vik E.,"Boston, MA",6,2,,4.0,12/19/2013,I have been here twice and this is the best Apple Bee's near by. The waitress was cute and ambiance was excellent. We had a great time though we felt appetizers were little expensive. After some drinks we missed out on main course. They have pretty thin menu for main course. On the whole its a great place to visit with friends
Tim O.,"Quincy, MA",16,28,9,4.0,10/30/2013,"The free Wi-Fi here is a nice bonus. I imagine this Applebee's location has such a low rating because people only think to review it if it's bad.  That's the curse of the ""chain restaurant"" I think.   Honestly, this place is not as bad as the reviews suggest.  I'll start by saying that it's Applebee's... you should know what to expect (1. a large menu with all types of food, 2. decent beer/drink selection, 3. pretty cheap prices).  I've been here three times now, and each time the food was what I was expecting, well prepared, and tasty.  Service each time was attentive but not overbearing. You're not going to have your mind blown here by some Mario Batali cuisine, but it is good for what you pay for.   This is a great place to stop for a cheap beer and a bite to eat after shopping at the stores at South Bay."
Steve L.,"Providence, RI",352,535,104,2.0,4/30/2012,"Generic Americana, done cheaply.  At least the beer's local. Most Applebees go out of their way to turn their local franchise into a tribute to the little town they occupy.  Take the franchise in my hometown of Yuba City, CA, for example, which features display cases of yearbook photos, Yuba City High School jerseys, and other elements of local charm.  Kitschy? Yes, but probably aimed at the appropriate target audience. This Applebee's fails even that, with wall decorations featuring rapidly obsolete scenes of Red Sox and Celtics glory, but nothing in particular celebrating Dorchester, or the expansive strip mall this franchise occupies. Food is the same old mediocre Applebee's.  Steaks taste (and probably are) brined, with sirloin cuts evoking the same mouthfeel and taste of mass market Chinese beef stir fry.  I bet the beef is sourced from the same place. Overall, I felt sadness after leaving the restaurant.  I couldn't help but feel bad that a trip to Applebee's is considered a treat in many parts of this country.  I suppose that makes me a snob."
Ashley G.,"Boston, MA",38,55,2,2.0,6/11/2013,"Today was my first time at this location and I honestly don't think I will go there again. Our waiter was not attentive at all. He heard my boyfriend's order but not mine. I had a feeling he didn't get my order in, so I had to tell a waitress that I saw walking by put my order in - which ended up not being the right meal. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip for an appetiser which wasn't hot when brought to our table. It was probably already made and put in the microwave for a minute or so. To be honest, the food didn't taste bad, the service experience was the big let down here."
Terry W.,"Dublin, CA",1,6,,3.0,3/21/2016,"My family of 4 had lunch there and it was not busy so we sat down right away. I enjoyed the Boston theme atmosphere. Service was good as we were undecided. The food came out fine. My wife had the Oriental chicken salad and I had the lemon chicken. No issue as it came out promptly. The kids had the chicken tenders and the steak. Again, everything was fine. After the food was served, service got a bit spotty. Refills on drinks were almost non-existant. No follow up on how we were doing. Not familiar with paying at the table's machine, it made made more sense. Servers could see that there was no need to follow though the meal any more because they don't even bring out a check. It made the whole meal experience from pretty good to so-so. A bit disappointed in getting the service that we all expect from a sit down meal."
Jake K.,"Boston, MA",35,53,17,1.0,5/26/2013,"Absolutely disgusting... Terrible service, dirty plates and beer glass, just a NO and NEVER again! I got there, got seated at a dirty table, even though there were many other, cleaner tables available! The waiter realized what he did and re-seated me after I intentionally started wiping my table while other guests were around. I ordered the appetizer plate and it was not more than ok, everything very very salty, the salt almost burning my mouth! All dishes were made with frozen products... reheated, served to a disgusting experience... While in the middle of my appetizer, another waitress came with my 2nd course - I said that I don't want it and how am I supposed to eat it while still trying to 'enjoy' my appetizer? She said ""yhmmmm"" gave me a ""wtf"" look and walked away. of course she re-circulated back with the same dish, the plate was sizzling hot, the food medium warm - fries dried out, disgusting.  I always thought you would never be able to f*ck up chicken tenders, but here we go... dry, SALTY, with a disgusting SALTY honey dijon dip on the side. I think their fries were rolled in salt after frying... and the best, my beer glass came dirty - I will never go back to that place. I wanted to enjoy my Sunday lunch, but I wasted $35. if there was a 0 star option here, I would have totally went for it."
Alejandro G.,"Boston, MA",5,11,1,4.0,8/3/2013,"Yes... i'm a fan! Friendly service, nice ambience and good food. One think i really like was that my order came just like the picture in the menu, JUST LIKE THE PICTURE!!! no joke. Our waitress was really helpful all the time and friendly, also there's this old guy that serve there too but i noticed that he starts a conversation with anybody, that's nice. He came to us when he saw our baby and started talking about his grandson. He wasn't intrusive he did it while he was bringing more drinks. We had a great time there, and we saw the have specials on wednesdays and monday i think."
