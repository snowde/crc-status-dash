Sarah T.,"Boston, MA",80,2,,2.0,2/24/2016,"I didn't want to take to Yelp, but felt compelled to share our now 3 in a row negative South Bay Plaza Applebee's experiences.  I'm fully aware that Applebee's is not The Ritz, but my comments will have nothing to do with atmosphere or the food.  This restaurant is clean, spacious, and the food is good!  Prices are great.  The service and staff are what's bringing this Applebee's down.  My husband and I live in the area and Applebee's was our savior last winter during all the bad snowstorms.  We had a routine of digging out the car and heading over to Applebee's to enjoy the drink specials (how can you go wrong with a $4 house margarita/$3 Coors?) and tasty appetizers- we really had a good thing going for its convenience and price.  Consistent good food, clean, nice atmosphere.  Something must have changed over the course of the year (Staffing?  Management?) because our last 3 experiences have been frustrating.  I'd like to first share the night before Thanksgiving 2015- not a crowded night at Applebee's, plenty of staff on hand, we were quickly seated in the dining room.  After waiting at least 15 minutes for a server to come over to take our drink request, we put in an appetizer and then ordered our entrees to avoid another wait- we thought we were doing the server a favor.  Appetizer came out and my entree immediately followed, drinks brought over, though, we both asked twice for waters and never got them, but oh well.  The kicker is that my husband's entree never made it.  We both watched the server write it down and it never even came.  We waited, we drank, seeing if it would come--nope, just the check.  We weren't charged for it, so that was fine, we moved on and were over it and ready to leave. Because it's a convenient, clean restaurant for a cheap tasty meal, we went back.  Seated in the bar area this time and had the nicest, most attentive server ever.  I wish I could remember her name so I could give her a shotout for doing her job and doing it wonderfully.  Things were fine.  Put our drinks in, got plenty of water, and ordered an appetizer and entrees.  Everything came out fine, except my husband got the wrong entree.  No problem, our server totally made up for it with her awesome customer service.  What really sealed the deal for us, was a recent night at Applebee's this February.  We waited about 20 minutes for a table, which was fine, it was Friday night after all, and were seated in the dining room.  Waited at least 20 minutes to be acknowledged by a server, put our drinks and appetizer in.  My husband's drink came over and was in a pint glass with red lipstick on it.  Not the server's fault, but come on.  Gross.  We waited so long for those drinks!  Luckily, another one quickly made it over.  Got our appetizer, put our entrees in, and were hoping for more drinks.  But our server was nowhere to be found.  By the time he came back around, we were both over it and ready to go home, so just asked for to go boxes because we had fully digested in the amount of time it took him to come back over to us- never apologizing for the wait or even asking if we needed anything else.  The to-go boxes never made it and the server disappeared again.  When I was about to get up and ask a hostess for boxes, he conveniently came back, so we grabbed the boxes and got out of there.  I just can't take the lack of customer service here--it kills me, because we really liked this Applebee's location.  If it's understaffed on a Friday night, then that needs to be addressed by Management.  People go out to eat because they want a night off from the usual routine.  They want to relax, have drinks and food with friends/family--it's a shame to see this Applebee's go under because of the poor service.  Is it a training issue?  Why are the servers so poorly trained and inattentive?  I will also add, we always left the servers 20% tips despite their sub-par service- people have off days and I know it's a living, but we just can't take it anymore and won't be coming back.  We haven't escalated our issues to Management because by the time our servers come to our attention, we just want to leave and go home without causing a fuss.  I get it, this industry can be overwhelming, but customer service is a fundamental principal of any occupation.  End rant. Get it together, Applebee's, you can be so much better!"
Francilia J.,"Dorchester Center, MA",0,2,,1.0,4/2/2015,This place sucks.  Food was disgusting and management had an attitude taking care of it. Everything is mispriced. Customer service was great ( Ebony is AMAZING) Dont come here on a late night unless youre drunk and everything will be good.
Michelle L.,"Boston, MA",0,5,,1.0,11/16/2012,"No. Just no.  In a moment of insanity I suggested Applebee's for lunch this past week. It'd been years since I'd been so I almost forgot how tasteless everything comes out. I had the french onion soup which had WAYYY too much greasy tasteless cheese and the oriental salad which was really nothing to write home about. My husband had tomato soup and lemon shrimp fettuccine which he felt was mediocre at best. Service was painfully slow despite being a quiet afternoon. The table next to us waited quite a while for someone to even come get their drink orders so they went and found the waitress themselves. Also, the bathroom had a broken stall and a stall smeared with boogers (lovely!). No thank you!"
Derek L.,"Boston, MA",2,18,,2.0,2/22/2015,Got the carside to go 10.95 lemon garlic chicken and rice and got skimped with the food when I grabbed the box of food to go I immediately knew this was a skimp. I took the food to the car and ate hoping I would be pleasantly surprised and not have to request a refund of sorts. I did and after 45 secs and 7 or 8 bites it was gone. I went back inside and instead of giving me a refund he was able to give me another order of the chicken that's why I gave a 2 star and not a 1.
Bumble B.,"Oakland, CA",78,71,152,4.0,8/16/2014,I liked this Applebee's a lot but something sad was I got this specialty summer margarita and it was huge and yummy and icy but it had like no alcoholic content to it... I wish they would have mentioned that first because I was trying to get sauced n ended up having to order four shots n using the drink as a chaser -- still we had fun an the lunch apps are a good deal
Michael F.,"Holly Springs, NC",11,11,5,2.0,6/5/2012,"No one was at the hostess stand after waiting for a few minutes, just found a seat at the bar table. Though it took a little while at first, the waitress did come and greet me at my table. Overall service was friendly but slow. The Food was hot and prepared about as well as it can be at an Applebee's but took forever to arrive.  If you are in a hurry, I would stay away."
Anonymus N.,"Dorchester, MA",0,15,1,5.0,12/31/2014,"The service here is much better than Olive Garden which is right next door, I cam bet you that. I have came to Applebee's a few times and I absolutely love it. Wonderful staffs and all, very well coordinated and organized. There was never a problem within  eating here at all."
Jowanna G.,"Boston, MA",3,37,71,1.0,8/5/2014,"As much as I enjoy an inexpensive and convenient location for a restaurant, this place will not see my hard earned money anytime soon. The waitress was polite and on top of her job with serving customers, the perfect margaritas was delicious, BUT what came from the kitchen to our table was inedible for human consumption. We had the napa chicken, the chicken was burned beyond belief and the chef tried to hide this by smothering the dish with onions. We also had the 4oz sirloin cooked medium paired with shrimp scampi, the steak was so well done that it was chewy and dry and the shrimps on the scampi was raw, yes raw! The manager and waitress was apologetic and removed all the food from the bill. A tip to the chef, if you wouldn't eat it don't serve it."
Ivan M.,"Somerville, MA",8,15,12,2.0,6/13/2012,"I had heard that Applebee's restaurant was good, so I was in south bay shopping center and decided to try their food but not a good experience .!!!! First I ordered a drink .! The waitress asked me for my ID, when she saw I just have a mass ID  and no driver's license she told me I can't get any drink If I don't have a driver's license Or a passport .!! I don't drive, I don't like to, wtf I'm already 25 years old..!!!..!! Uta madre .!!! ..!!! Food was not that good as I expected ..!!!! Wowwww I was just waiting for my waitress to ask for the bill when an other girl just passed by and asked me with her Spanish ""que te pasa .."""" she is so stupid .!!!

How they treat customers like that cuz she kept telling me more things that I prefer to to write them here ..!! I just though Wth .!!! What's was wrong with her .!!! Never going back .!! That was enough .!!! Thanks .!!  My waitress was nice and friendly but the other was a bit****..!!"
Danielle E.,"Boston, MA",14,23,6,1.0,3/5/2015,"We came in-- a group of 3 adults and two children around 230 pm.  We were seated next to the bathroom-- although there were multiple booths that were available. We sat for 15 minutes without a server nor a staff person acknowledging our presence, when a waitress finally stopped she let us know that she would be with us shortly. Although she apologized-- we still waited another 5 minutes before she came back JUST for our drink order. When the waitress returned we were able to put in an appetizer order-- Once  we got our drinks we still waited another 20 minutes for our waitress to come back to the table to take our order for the actual entree. We waited 30 minutes for our food(which was barely hot-- go figure!!) which means that at this point it had been about an hour of just waiting around.. while waiting though we asked the TV's which was on a snoop Dog documentary channel. We asked multiple staff members who told us they would change the channel and didn't. We finally asked for the restaurant manager-- he came by-- refused to give direct eye contact, was dismissive of our request-- and told us he needed to speak to the bartender he wasn't sure if they were able to change the channel--  he never checked back in with us-- but 10 minutes later all of the TVs in the entire restaurant portion-- not the bar were changed to NASCAR.... When i expressed my complaint to our waitress about the mangers lack of follow through she stated ""oh he's just like that""... Although we had super slow service and our food was poor, our waitress was friendly-- they were understaffed-- so I don't blame her.. but the restaurant not being clean! and being seated by the bathroom! unacceptable. I will never be returning to this location."
Sameer S.,"Cambridge, MA",22,15,23,2.0,6/24/2014,First time @ this location. They bombed it. Waitress was polite but not attentive. They messed up our drinks & food. Appetizers never made it to the table... Straight to Entrees. The first dish that hit the table was entrees. Manager apologized & offered free desert. I've been to better Apple Bees.
Jackie S.,"Teaneck, NJ",83,98,,4.0,9/7/2012,"I suppose I am not surprised that Applebee's has 2 stars but I was quite pleased with my time here. The waitress was so cute and friendly. Very helpful and when I told her that she admitted it was only her second day! Good job girl! The food was actually great. I tried the chicken wonton tacos (with no cilantro) and it was very filling and very cheap. Most appetizers are half price from 9-12pm so we got chicken quesadillas, boneless wings, and spinach and artichoke dip all half off. All were good and filling. Plus, who can go wrong with a $4 margarita! We had a great time and I usually don't go to chain restaurants, but this Applebee's did a good job!"
Nathan C.,"Ellijay, GA",0,5,12,2.0,10/5/2015,"Excited to try one of their new burgers. Well, went with portobello Swiss with sweet potato fries. Fries were pretty decent. Burger was not great. Hardee's has a better burger. Also, the bun seemed old with hard spots that were attempted to be covered by buttering and cooking."
Bob K.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",126,249,8,3.0,12/6/2011,"So just recently, the head guy at this Applebee's had called me to find out what the problem was and I had told him about the issue I had with his restaurant. Well, he was gracious enough to apologize and send me a gift card to coax me into trying out Applebee's out my way. I thought that was nice of him and I will try one in our area one more time. Hopefully, we won't get the same treatment like we did in South Boston. So...I give him 3 stars because of his concern and understanding."
David B.,"Boston, MA",302,9,,1.0,5/31/2014,"First let me start this by saying Applebees....just not this location. This place is a joke and makes me look terrible, as I always suggest Applebees to my girlfriend. I am jewish so I appreciate a cheap bite to eat. I have been to over ten Applebees in my career and this place is by far the worst. I keep giving it a try because it is so close but this last time might have done it for me. I stood in the lobby waiting to be seated for 12 MINUTES as THREE seperate staff walked by me without saying anything. WEAK. You are a joke."
Thomas S.,"Boston, MA",0,22,3,1.0,5/31/2015,I did like Applebee's I had good service before and I posted good things. This time I can't and I won't infact I wouldn't eat in there for free again. Was there last Thursday the place had not many people . We sat and waited for the waitress we ordered drinks and salad and fingers and fries and I got a burger. We waited 45 min for the salad that was wilted and old looking I asked the waitress what's taking so long she left us for 25 min at a time after a hour and a half we got our food . I think she was chillin with the kitchen staff or something . I asked her why it take so long she said the kitchen was backed up ..no way I took a bite of my burger it was so hot I spit it out .it was microwaved .then they left a huge mess beside us at a different table she walked past it and didn't care I had to move a high chair so someone can get by in a wheel chair they just looked at me even the waitress didn't care so sad. I say our waitress was nice but LAZY .
Emily D.,"Quincy, MA",251,394,942,2.0,4/14/2011,"What in the hellzzzz was I even thinking coming to Applebee's. No, wait. I blame my husband.. he suggested it. We both had a momentary lapse of judgment.  We order our food. We decided to choose off the 2 for $20 menu. Honestly, the food is not worth more than $20.  We had the boneless BBQ wings for app. - overly breaded chicken smothered in tangy BBQ sauce. My question is.. where's the chicken? It was mostly all breading and it wasn't even hot. It was room temperature.  For our entree- I ordered the chicken and shrimp and substituted the potatoes for veggies. They brought out a skillet with chicken and 4 tiny shrimps soaking in oil with onions and mushrooms and a huge broccoli stalk sitting in the oil as well. Really, I prefer not to have my veggies soaked in oil.. thanks. I couldn't finish my food. The chicken was ok, but I was feeling icky from all the oil. I ate all the mushrooms and broccoli.  The hubby had the riblets and fries. He enjoyed his riblets but the fries were cold and rubbery.  Honestly, applebee's is really only good for their drinks and maybe desserts. They have tons of different cocktail options and even low cal cocktails like the skinny margarita.  Waitress was friendly and sweet, I can't blame her for the crappy food. REGRET REGRET REGRET."
Eric S.,"Boston, MA",20,286,26,2.0,3/28/2011,"Why does this place have an aversion to hot food? This place gets two stars based on the service, not so much the food.  If rated on the food alone, it would get one star. After leaving Boston Bowl with a group of coworkers, we decided to go to Olive Garden.  It was 9PM, Olive Garden closed at 11, and we were told that it would be at least an hour until we were seated.  We said screw it, let's go to Applebee's. We walked in with our group of 11.   The guy at the door said that it will be at least 20 minutes.  10 minutes later, we were told that a group came in before us and had just been seated so it will take even longer.  A woman came out from the bar area and said that there were three booths available if we didn't mind splitting up. So, we split up into three booths and ordered drinks.  The mango iced tea is amazing! Then, we ordered our food.  I ordered an appetizer sampler, a bowl of chowder, and a fried chicken salad. The bowl of chowder came first.  Unfortunately, Applebee's had underestimated how much experience that I've had with a microwave.  The chowder was warm on top, and cool in the middle and bottom.  Definitely microwaved. Then, the appetizer sampler came.  None of it was hot except for the spinach and cheese dip.  The mozzarella sticks were cold, the bacon and cheese quesadilla was cold, and the boneless wings were deliciously microwaved quality. Then, the salad arrived.  Half of the veggies were wilted.  Come on!  Even Mcdonalds can make a better salad at half the price!"
Hank A.,"Boston, MA",0,14,,4.0,4/23/2015,"Great customer service staff is professional, attentive and friendly. Surpassed my expectations"
Sagine G.,"Randolph, MA",37,2,,1.0,12/5/2014,"Worst experience ever! Me and my friend decided to try this place after work. The second we entered we should have done a 180. Even the greeting from the hosts were half-assed. Our waiter was adorable and awesome and it was clear she had a lot of tables to wait but she was patient and helpful. We ordered the strawberry mango sangria which was the only upside of our experience. We ordered two pasta dishes which, unfortunately, were not delivered by our waiter, but by a rude chick who literally threw our plates on the table, didn't tell us which dish was which, and walked away without even giving us any utensil to eat with. My friend was fed up. When our sweet waiter came back, my friend asked for our check. The manager came out to apologize on her staff's behalf and told us to take the entrees home as compliments but we weren't having it. She charged us for just the drinks and we tipped our waitress and hauled the heck out and went to Panera, which was a few steps away."
