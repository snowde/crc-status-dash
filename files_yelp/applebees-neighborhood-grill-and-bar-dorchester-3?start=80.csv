Taja M.,"Attleboro, MA",116,25,,4.0,9/26/2011,"Bruschetta Chicken This dish, had a great combination of flavors. Everything worked together and complimented one another. I enjoyed my garlic breadsticks, they were warm, flavorful (a little too much flavor) and hit the spot until our meals came. My own beef with this dish. Please ask for extra scampi sauce or bruschetta cuz after a while the potatoes starting getting dry and so were the onions. Overall, I will be eating this dish again. I strongly recommend it"
Tim B.,"Hatfield, MA",0,3,,1.0,3/12/2015,I won't even give this place 1 star. It's more like negative stars. THE lamest overpriced salad I have ever had. First I wasn't saved even though multiple wait staff walked by and totally ignored me. HD to ask to be helped. When my salad came it looked like the cook had literally grabbed a handful of lettuce and threw it on the plate. And where the heck Re the crispy buys. Not there. I ate a soggy unfulfilling meal. I will never go back to this hole again! Don't waste tor time going here!
Bobby B.,"READVILLE, MA",0,22,,5.0,1/7/2014,"had dinner there on Monday, January 6th.  Outstanding food and the service was even better. Highly recommended."
Julie C.,"Boston, MA",0,13,,5.0,2/28/2014,"I never thought I'd be giving an Applebee's five stars on yelp... that was before I experienced Kim's awesome service. She was so friendly and informative as well as super attentive. She upsold my boyfriend and I on just about everything we got and I'm not complaining, it was amazing. The food is what it is when you go to chains like this. You're not expecting gourmet, sometimes you just want some honey barbeque chicken fingers and a cheap margarita. Five stars for Kim though!"
Amy R.,"Boston, MA",156,144,202,1.0,1/22/2011,"I'm usually not picky about where to eat. I can find something that I would enjoy on any menu. However, this Applebee's location is the worst chain restaurant ever. My ravioli was DEFINITELY microwaved. The cheese inside was burning hot, tasted like plastic, and the edges of the ravioli was dried. The cream sauce was hot on one side of my plate and cold on the other. The best part of my meal was my soda. Enough said, I will never waste my money here again."
Joe K.,"South Boston, Boston, MA",28,36,8,1.0,7/27/2012,The worst restaurant experience I have ever had! Thanks Applebee's you're tops at something.
Krystal S.,"Boston, MA",27,109,118,4.0,10/22/2012,"So we've been coming for awhile but this is my first review. Soooooooo, I'll honestly say this time ""wasn't such a bad experience"". It was a bit empty so service was definietly faster than the other times. Our food was good, hot and served on time. All on all we had a good experience. But if I have a choice, I would have to choose the Quincy location."
Eli B.,"Hessen, Germany",23,135,8,1.0,4/30/2012,"No vegetarian menu, sat us in a corner away from everyone else, typical service that follows. Ice in a margarita I wanted no ice in. That is all."
Reneé R.,"Boston, MA",33,39,6,2.0,6/29/2010,"Applebees, one of the top chain restaurants in the United States. Promising delectable dishes at cheap prices. Too bad when my mom and I walked into this one and decided to have dinner, the latter rang true and only that.  Before I get to how insanely awful our food was, I would like to mention  the overall decorative design of the place. Attempting to have a conversation with my mom over what to order, I found myself being distracted and disgusted by the 1980s poster of New Kids On The Block. There's just nothing appealing about looking at Marky Marc's chest hair when deciding between chicken fingers and a burger. The other posters of local celebrities weren't as disturbing. They just need to update the place and consider their customer's sensitive stomachs.  The wait for our food, didn't take too long. I figured out why, my mom's order was completey wrong in every way possible and my chicken tenders tasted like they were leftovers that they  heated up in an easy bake oven for 10 minutes. The fries were confusing, some were crispy while others were saggy.  My public high school cafeteria had better fries than this. We got through a few minutes of our meals, toughing through, not wanting our money to go to waste and we finally decided to ask for the check. The two stars for the restaurant is for the waiter. He was very nice and made me feel guilty about not taking my leftovers home.  I know that there are certain expectations of chain restaurants and I shouldn't have such high hopes, but  this Applebee's didn't even live up to the minimum expectations. Applebee's needs to be redmodeled and the food should match it's waiters."
Brian D.,"Kansas City, MO",192,503,21,3.0,2/18/2010,"I really have nothing to say about this place that is either good or bad. Let me just share a little story with you. Picture if you will..... Man and woman running crappy errands after work head to South Bay shopping center. After dealing with atrocious grocery shopping both man and woman decide that 1. they need to pee and 2. they could go for a beer. Man and woman decide against all better judgment to go to the silly Applebee's that happens to be right where their car is parked. How bad could it be? GUYSSSSS!!! GUYSSSSSS!! They have karaoke at this Applebee's on Wednesday nights. OMG. You have no idea. I'm pretty sure that if you imagine this phrase in a very seasoned Boston accent you will get what I mean ""Sully, fahkin A they got that fahkin Ground Control to Major Tom song!"".  Yeah."
Chris C.,"South End, Boston, MA",137,119,,1.0,12/18/2010,"Closing out the holiday season with a change of pace. Tonight, by request of a friend, I review a chain restaurant in my surrounding neighborhood-Applebee's. Located in the South Bay Shopping Center in Dorchester, Applebee's is one of the available places to eat in the nearby area. There is also an Olive Garden right next to it, and along Massachusetts Avenue, there is Victoria's Diner, Hen House, McDonald's and other places to eat (cannot remember them all at this time). Most people come in the area to shop at one of the big name stores such as Best Buy, Target, Home Depot, Famous Footwear, or even do grocery shopping at Stop & Shop. The atmosphere is very casual. Families, friends, co-workers and others can come and eat or relax and enjoy the game on the TV. At this location, there is various local memorabilia along the wall, such as the Red Sox, New Kids on the Block, and New Edition. Our server's name was Brittany. She was fairly attentive, quick, and polite in serving us tonight. Applebee's menu is pretty wide in terms of selection. I wouldn't know how to describe what their menu is overall or compare it to other chain restaurants, but there are plenty of choices to choose from. They also have multiple specials where you can mix and match entrees, so that's a plus. I chose the 2 for $20 deal, which is an appetizer and your choice of 2 entrees from a section for $20. From that, I had the Boneless Wings, Fettucine with Provolone-Stuffed Meatballs, and Riblet Basket (Ribs with your choice of sauce and fries) The confusing or bad part of the review starts here though. The boneless wings were spicy but warm in terms of temperature. The fettucine had good taste and wasn't too thin or overly thick in its sauce, but the top layer was warm. Only the center was even close to being hot. Some of the noodles were also stuck together as if they were frozen. The same goes for the meatballs. The riblets were overcooked (one could tell from the dried appearance of the meat) as well as the fries. I ended up packing all the food for take-out to 1) not waste it and 2) to perhaps salvage it in my house by recooking.  Overall, there's better options for food. Even going to the supermarkets next door and preparing something at home would be more fulfilling and cheaper than eating at this dining establishment. If you're looking for a place to relax and have a good time with friends and others, Applebees is the place to go. Otherwise, save your dollars for shopping."
Michael M.,"Taunton, MA",298,366,92,1.0,12/20/2011,"This place was gross! As soon as we stepped inside this place we knew that it was going to be such a waste of time and it was! We were hungry and outside of the hotel we didn't have much of a selection, but after this meal I would've rather of had starved to death."
Kevin G.,"North Las Vegas, NV",63,19,19,1.0,3/10/2012,"Horrible, horrible, horrible did I mention horrible place.The staff and service is despicable. I can't believe I stayed, but girlfriend was pregnant and hungry.Took like ten minutes for waiter to see us. Drinks came ten minutes later minus straws. Straws took another ten. I almost didn't even wasn't to leave a tip which should been a penny."
Ben J.,"Boston, MA",83,73,4,2.0,3/14/2010,"I went there on Saturday before I decided to go shopping in the South Bay complex. When we arrived, we were seated at a rather dilapidated booth. We asked to switch seats and were seated in a more suitable booth. The service was a bit slow needless to say, however the food was prepared quickly. Their food was well prepared and the waitress was frequently refilling my iced tea once the food was brought out.  Overall, the food was good however the appearances can be improved significantly."
Hansel T.,"Boston, MA",2,1,,5.0,6/17/2014,"Love this place, employees are really helpful and always taking well care of you, highly recommended"
Mary G.,"Boston, MA",0,3,,1.0,11/2/2012,Horrible service.!.  The food was very little. For like a child. The boneless chicken were horribly dry with almost NO sauce. The pasta was hard uncooked properly. The fries were burned.!  Horrible experience. I was better off going to Chilis.  Im highly upset. I will never come again.  And the chipotle sauce was like a cheese mix!  Discusting
Jason B.,"Sandwich, MA",286,560,36,2.0,1/22/2009,"Yuck. If you don't have Hep C already, plan on getting it from a visit to the men's room at this Applebee's.  The bartender couldn't have given a shit. They don't stock cocktail onions and don't plan to. So when I asked for a martini instead, it showed up in a rocks glass with ice. When I said cancel that yo, she effin charged me for a second one.  Make no mistake, this is an Applebee's in the parking lot of the South Shitbag Center. You get what you expect here.  I used to think I could deal with any bar as long as they pitched booze. Guess I got old."
Julie M.,"Dorchester, MA",5,30,,2.0,2/28/2010,"Not that great today, I was really disappointed. I feel like the portions are shrinking because I had a total of 12  fries on my plate next to my ""meh"" burger. My boyfriend orders a Cowboy burger and halfway through eating it he realizes it's missing the BBQ sauce and the Bacon, wtf?!?!  You can also order Onion rings instead of fries for 1.69 more, which normally wouldn't be so bad but there was exactly 5 of them on the plate. Again, wtf ?!?!   At least the waitress was pleasant."
Irene R.,"Memphis, TN",214,559,90,2.0,1/18/2009,the food is usually adequate.   I like their smaller portion of chicken fingers. However every time we go the service sucks.  It doesn't matter how busy or empty it is.  We usually end up waiting by the door for someone to come from the back and seat us...and then our waiter/waitress isn't attentive enough.
Eric S.,"Boston, MA",51,131,1,3.0,4/3/2011,"Revisited with a few friendsPlace was packed and very noisy and good place to watch people,,I had the cajun shrimp pasta plenty of shrimp and it was Delicious with the bread stick similiar to olive gardens breadsticks but with garlic butter on them absoluetly Delicious ,No matter what anyone says Applebees is still a good place to go eat ...."
