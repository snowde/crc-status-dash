Megan L.,"Saugus, MA",0,23,,3.0,10/22/2017,"Server was very friendly, but unfortunately I got my oriental salad and had no utensils. Had to wait a solid 5-7 minutes waiting for someone to come by that would make eye contact in order to ask for some while the salad got cold. My server came back and was super apologetic. Oops!  Had a hard time connecting to WiFi when I got here, but everyone, including the manager, was very helpful with having me move to another side of the restaurant. Probably should look into this? I didn't really want to sit in the bar area, but, okay.  I always get the oriental salad-this is literally the only reason I still avidly go to Applebee's. At this particular location there was a great amount of chicken provided compared to others. But sooooo many dry noodles! This seems to be a thing lately."
Buju D.,"Portsmouth, NH",22,67,177,3.0,9/11/2017,"First I ordered the tea that is supposed to be blackberry honey tea...the cup was presented to me with nothing but water with syrup at the bottom. This is suppose to be a quencher, made with real fruit, the menu said?!  I decided to get a little brave and ordered the grilled baby back ribs...well...the ribs were as described in the menu. The meat literally fell off the bone! Impressive."
Jonathan B.,"Burlington, MA",63,33,,4.0,6/20/2017,"You know what can I say I don't believe people when they say they do not like chain restaurants especially ones with quick car side to go options. Food is always good and consistent, never had an issue. No matter what Applebee's you go to they never change service and consistency wise. Beer selection could be better."
Mike D.,"Acton, ME",18,8,1,5.0,4/13/2017,"I am someone who frequents Applebees pretty frequently, however usually not this location. The food was very good, prices really reasonable, and the waitress we got was very accommodating to all of our requests. Would definitely recommend!"
Joan C.,"Rochester, NH",12,2,,1.0,5/14/2017,"We had What should have been a wonderful mother's day lunch filled yummy blue hawian drinks which turn out to be the best part, we ordered chips and salsa, side salad and soup to start also ordered kids mac-n-cheese, BBQ birskit tacos with sweet potato fries and a bacon burger well done with fries. Waited about 45 mins for the starters to arrive we were starving. Another round of.drinks and we've hit anhour and fifteen  waitress tells us there was issue with our order and the kitchen has started remaking it about another 15 mins pass and they bring out our meals. Cut into the burger to find it very pink inside as well as regural fries instead of sweet potato fries. Flag done waitress she apologized and went to immediately fix issues only then do I try the tacos to realize the are cold get waitress again she is very apologetic Again. Manager  stops by table and gave mozzarella sticks and apologizes for the issues  and tells us the are remaking it all now.about 15 mins later we have what looks and smells to be exactly what we are looking for another round of drinks and we start eating to realize we've filled up on starters and drinks we get a box for the half of burger and the 2 of the 3 tacos the meal came with.we pay our bill waitress apologizes again and we tell her we understand things happen and go about our after noon.a couple hours later was ready to enjoy the rest of my tacos I get Half way thru the first taco I took home and bite in to something hard I spit it onto a napkin and realized to my disgust it was a finger nail. Absolutely disgusted I called to speak with the manager which is honestly something I never do but I felt and still do that it was placed deliberately placed in the food the manage tells me that's impossible and it must have been in the prepackaged meat used for the tacos as he had made them himself. I will never be returning to one of my favorite places to enjoy delicious drinks."
R R.,"Newmarket, NH",7,11,7,2.0,10/23/2015,"Mediocre for a chain. Most of the time they're pretty good, but tonight was certainly an off night that left us disappointed.  We went for my boyfriend's birthday because we wanted something low key. We (three of us) all ordered burgers, when they came out they were all wrong: ones that were supposed to be no pink were pink inside, and pinks come out well done. My boyfriend's burger that was supposed to be well done came out so raw he had to send it back. The rest of us just ate our meals as is despite being disappointed, but that meant by the time his food came back, we were done eating. He ended up bringing his mostly home. We didn't even order dessert because we were all kind of over the situation at that point. Right after the burger incident, my boyfriend asked for a glass of Pepsi with no ice and it came with ice, which we let go but clearly was a miss for attention to detail by the staff. Very glad the manager came out to fix the situation, and they did give us the Pepsi on the house and half off of his burger. However, they probably should have made his burger free for all the trouble. Very disappointing birthday dinner."
Sally M.,"Dover, NH",0,20,1,1.0,5/7/2016,"I will never return. I went on my lunch break with a friend for a quick lunch. We both ordered soups and salads. Crowd was rather small- half the tables were empty. Waitress was nice enough. After waiting 20 minutes for the soup, we inquired. Our waitress was surprised we didn't have it already. She said she'd be back with it in seconds. We waited another 10 minutes (I don't know why!), trying to catch our waitress. At the 30 minute mark, we excused ourselves. If we had to wait 30 minutes for soup, we figured the salads would probably take a couple of hours..."
Chris C.,"Dover, NH",10,24,9,1.0,8/8/2015,"Absolutely vile. They weren't this bad a couple years ago, but now it appears they've just given up and gone full corporate. Lame, limited beer menu. I asked for a vegetarian menu and got a blank stare. There are exactly 2 menu items a junk- food vegan like me would eat. Chips and salsa, or a garden salad. Brutal and they could give a fuck I got the impression, judging from all the obese diabetics happily dining there.   So I ordered for my kids from the kids menu and when their small plastic meals arrived even they looked disappointed, just awful. In lieu of a beer I ordered a margarita....it was the worst I've EVER had. If you took a 5lb bag of sugar, waved a lime over it and splashed cheap tequila on it it would have been better than this! If wal-mart made a margarita, this would be it. After I sent it back after a sip and refused to pay for it a ""manager"" managed to wander over and ask why. They did not seem at all surprised after I told them and deducted it from my bill. When I got home I made my kids ravioli and garlic bread because they were ""still hungry"" and ate a ton.  Such a useless scam. Even my 7&9 year old boys figured it out!"
Rose L.,"Rochester, NH",3,9,4,1.0,7/7/2014,"Where do I start?The waitresses was unattentive to us, the food was absolutely terrible, and overpriced. Also the food was too greasy and icky.Bottom line I don't recommend this."
Lydia W.,"Nashville, TN",2,38,70,2.0,12/19/2014,I go to Applebee's all the time and regularly use their Curbside service. Upset that I sat I'm my car for 10 minutes. I finally went in and was told I had to pick up my food at the bar. The bartender was nice and gave me the food without a receipt. Shrimp pasta dish was good but only had 2 pieces of zucchini but tons of shrimp.
suzanne h.,"Rochester, NH",41,19,,1.0,1/28/2013,"The hostess here was very good. She looked sharp, was aware and helpful.  That ends my compliments of employees encountered during this visit. Our server was rushing us to order, not in any horrible way, just in an annoying way which lends the impression that your patronage is a burden instead of being grateful for the ability to earn a wage. This is my day off, I work in a fast paced restaurant and I do not want to be rushed on my day off, not even in a corporate chain like Applebees where expectations are generally not very high. If I'm spending money, I expect value for dollar. I can't say I would recommend Applebees food or service as value for dollar.  Our food was brought out by someone not our server. She would have just dumped the food and ran but we bloody needed drinks! So we asked for them, which seemed to be another burden!!! We're the damn customers here! We're earning your wages, try to act like you give a crap for crying out loud.   I do not buy into the premise that one must tip well regardless of service. I tip according to service and my service expectations while I do have standards are very reasonable. Basically, if you are actually trying to do a good job and not skate by on entitlements, you're good. If you actually care about the fact that the humans you are serving food to are contributing to your livlihood, that's a great start to doing a good job. Our server did not seem to exactly relish the fact that she had gainful employment. As service goes, she was greatly lacking in being concerned and attentive to our very basic dining needs. Our dinner plates were left on our table as she dropped our check off before our desserts came out. It wasn't until I stacked the plates 2 feet high on the edge of the table that it occured to her to take them away, nor to any of the other servers who walked by our table. So much for teamwork. The food sucked, my onion soup bowl was a sparse portion, the cheese barely even melted, pathetically anemic looking, no bubbling golden goodness as shown in the thoughtfully provided visual aids in the menu. God forbid the cooks take 30 extra seconds to try and make it look pleasing! The salad was quite literally thrown on the plate in a very messy fashion along side my anemic soup, 3 croutons was apparently all that was alloted for my caeser salad. Plus a smattering of carelessly plopped parmesan cheese. C'mon, can  you not TRY to make things look nice???? Really, if you don't wish to cook, for god sake, don't be a cook!!! A nasty, gummy breadstick which should have been left off entirely was also present. It's just soup and salad people, really not rocket freaking science. My husband ordered a grilled chicken dish with a red wine sauce, veg and roast potatoes off their reasonably healthy meals menu. Chicken was moist albiet simply permeated with that magical enhancement solution that makes every meat taste like nothing but salt. But by golly, it's going to stay moist even if the chicken breat hits 190 degrees!!!  Sauce was very bland, just an open and heat jobbie I imagine. Veg and pots were merely ok. As the trend continues, nothing looks like it's visual menu counterpart. They seem to make more effort to describe the food so you imagine it to taste good, and when you actually eat it, you are either swayed by the power of persuasion to think it actually does taste good, or you convince yourself through internal rationalization that it has to taste good or you're wasting money!  My oldest son had a burger and fries. Fries again, anemic like my soup cheese.  He was asked if he wanted his burger pinkish or not. He replied he would like it medium. Apparently training a cook how to use a thremometer is not an option for this corporate chain. Burger was what it was..., it's a frozen defrosted patty on a frozen defrosted bun with crappy soggy lettuce and a grainy fall aparty tomato.  My youngest son had completley congealed, very stodgy kraft ""mac and cheese"" A little more liquid next time guys, the mac had properly seized into one solid mass by the time it got to the table. It was ridiculous. Numerous employees in this restaurant clearly have very little concern with quality of work. This visit was a waste of money not to be repeated. There are so many other local, non chain restaurants who actually WANT to do a nice job for you, and give a crap that you're spending your hard earned cash in their establishment!!! Go find em!!"
Jim R.,"Rochester, NH",0,13,2,3.0,8/23/2011,"My wife and I love this place because of the bartenders and wait staff. The food is ok, but the people are awseome. Usually a great time on thursday nights when alot of regulars are at the bar! very entertaining. Jenna, Nicole, Carrie, and Danielle....you are the best!!!"
Roni E.,"Waltham, MA",702,565,507,3.0,11/6/2008,"Apparently, the only option for dinner around these neck of the woods are corporate chains. And so we ended up at Applebee's.  Although, our server forgot our silverware when our apps came, he was still a great server nonetheless.  I enjoyed the Southern Punch, which was new on their menu, and guess what it had in it? SoCo!!! What sold me was when our server, told me that this had more alcohol in it than the Jamaican Freeze. Give me more al-keee-halll!!!  I ordered the 7 oz. sirloin, cooked medium-rare, with asparagus & garlic mashed potatoes. I was actually kinda upset that they didn't have any other veggie options other than starches, but I only had a few bites of it and was good about it. The steak definitely came out over cooked. It was more on the medium-well side. But that didn't stop me from eating it.  We shared an appetizer plate with shrimp (which I didn't eat - cause I don't eat shrimp), boneless buffalo wings w. ranch, and spinach and artichoke dip. For $11.99, this was actually a pretty good serving size to split between 4 people.  My dining companions OTOH each had burgers and really weren't impressed with them at all. Again, those who asked for medium or medium-rare, got their burgers cooked way more than they wanted. Although, our server did tell us that they really only cook the burgers one way but would see what the kitchen could do. What kinda restaurant only cooks burgers one way? Even in a corporate chain, this should be cooked to order and the way a customer would like it."
Jessica B.,"Londonderry, NH",177,15,2,4.0,9/7/2011,"This place is good. I'm a regular there, so I'm getting a little sick of their menu, but that's not their fault. Let me start by saying the service is GREAT. Extremely accommodating. I'm pregnant so I'm very particular and they ace my order everytime. One time I didn't like my order and The manager took it off the bill. They also always remind us about special deals and ways to save money when we visit. Drinks are awesome. Alcoholic, and not. And the food is very good. I don't think I've ever had a bad experience there. I know a friend who works there, and I know for a fact they greatly underpay their cooks, but as far as going there to eat goes, I'd recommend it. I love the bacon burger. They always cook it just the way I want. And the fries are good quality as well."
