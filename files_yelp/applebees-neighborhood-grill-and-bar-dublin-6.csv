Candice F.,"San Francisco, CA",6,104,192,3.0,10/13/2017,"Food - meh, pretty good in its class at a good value.   Service - don't expect much more than one water refill.   If you're coming to Applebee's,  expect your typical chain restaurant offering the standard American fare in a packed environment and sub-par service.  We stumbled into the restaurant shortly before the evening rush on a Friday night.   We were quickly greeted and seated.  While we were given traditional paper menus, we found that Applebee's has fully leveraged an electronic tableside ordering system via a tablet.   And hence the waitstaff has probably been cut by at least 50% as everything from food orders to payment to hailing down help from the staff is dependent on the tablet.  Applebee's has certainly done well in implementing the technology, but there is still a desire to have human interaction behind a friendly smile.   Once our food order was placed through the tablet, it did not take long before the food arrived. Aside from a minor oversight from the kitchen, everything was prepared hot and as stated in the menu.    There are no complaints as far as flavors and serving sizes as everything was prepared satisfactorily.  For the price paid (especially the 2 for $20 meal deal with one shareable appetizer and two entrees), one can't really expect too much.   All in all, Applebee's deserves a solid 2.5 stars (rounded up) middle of the road rating.   It couldn't be too bad judging by a packed restaurant and full waiting area of eager diners as we exited at the end of our meal."
Leo M.,"Livermore, CA",0,37,,1.0,11/25/2017,Had to wait for a while because someone messed up in assigning us our server. Spinach dip - chips were old. Had it replaced but chips were still not good. Kids had Mac and Cheese. They finished their meals.  Rack was not tender. Stir sirloin was not good either. Our waitress was friendly.
Ray K.,"San Leandro, CA",198,133,237,1.0,12/17/2017,Horrible experience tonight for Sunday night. The waitress took our drink order and then never came back. I had to get a manager to take my order then he left for the night and I had to get another manager to refill our drinks.  We actually never had a real server tonight. It was busy because of Raiders Sunday night football but that's not an excuse to just totally forget about us. Worse experience ever at Applebees
Artika K.,"Hayward, CA",235,14,,2.0,11/17/2017,"I came here the other night I ordered the new pasta with shrimp that was on the menu, right when I got my other I was mixing up everything together and there a was a hair in my plate which was all around the pasta and the fork. They took it back and gave me another place which I was happy about but usually something like that happens there a dessert or something on the house but I was fully charged. I love this place but the costumer service needs work."
Jayson B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/8/2017,The service ruined the steak that I received. Worst service I have ever had. Gonna drive this location out of business. I guess they don't really care because I see a lot of these reviews on here.
Camylle R.,"Dublin, CA",0,27,,1.0,11/5/2017,Food is ok but the wait for the food is LONG. We waited 30 minutes for our food and were only a party of 2. Our server apologized several times and we came close to walking out. We only went here because my friend gave me a gift card
Janira E.,"Oakland, CA",50,13,150,1.0,3/14/2017,"I love living in the Dublin/Pleasanton area now but holy sh*t this Applebees is the worst I've ever been to. The waitress Jennifer didn't understand the menu and ranted about having 3 jobs.. ok trust me I get it! But once I asked to see if she could find out, the manager came out and I never saw her again! No refills from her and the service was crazy slow for only 4 other tables being occupied.  I finally found Jennifer and she was sitting having some deep conversation for 20 minutes with a customer as we waiting for our boxes and bill?! Horrible Service!! She must have gotten offended that she didn't know her stuff when we asked? Like ol girl, find another job if you're not good with people!! Never coming here again."
D Y.,"San Jose, CA",46,1039,190,3.0,6/30/2017,Classic burger w/ cheese and fries - pretty good.  Service - ok.
Michael F.,"Tracy, CA",0,11,,1.0,10/6/2017,My first time being to this location of Applebee's and I have to say it is the worst one I have ever been to. The service at this location is terrible and really poor. Can't believe anyone would even come to this Applebee's at all. The food here is ok do not get me wrong but if you get a man named Jorge as your waiter immediately ask for someone else because he is very disrespectful and mean. I do not know if it was just this certain day or not but he was really being mean and very dry with me and my friends. If you ask me to rate his service I would straight up tell you it sucked.
Naima-Natalia C.,"Bay Area, CA",28,34,11,1.0,5/5/2017,"I went with my family to Applebee's to have dinner before our movie. Being a vegetarian I found nothing on the menu to accommodate me but the pasta. The pasta comes with bacon and chicken so I asked the waiter to please take the chicken and bacon away. So when my food comes the chicken is gone but there is EXTRA bacon.  There is zero sympathy atApplebees for those who do not want to eat meat. Very upset! UPDATE:  After posting this review, I was sent a harassing note from an employee. Telling me they don't have to accommodate to my diet and to go somewhere else. Thanks Applebee's!"
Victoria J.,"San Leandro, CA",5,47,68,2.0,4/3/2017,"Oh my goodness I do not know where to even begin! Please beware of this restaurant solely due to their customer service! It's pretty sad and pathetic!  So my husband and I come in on a Monday afternoon, and it was pretty slow. So there was no one at the host station which was fine and made sense since it seemed slow. Then a sweet waitress with her hands full sees us and immediately puts her plates down and seats, and she was super kind and had excellent customer service skills!  However it was our wack waiter, he was arrogant and stuck up! I felt like we were getting punk' or something...it was very clear he didn't want to be there and our presence annoyed him!  First of all he didn't make eye contact with us at all and he seemed irritated he had to serve us. When he brings us our drinks, I told him we would like to order an appetizer, and he just stared at me and I was like ookkk, can I please have chips and dip please. He just wrote it down and walked away! It was so weird! I never meant a waiter where I felt like I was talking to myself and basically asking myself questions! So when he finally brought the dip it was horribly too salty and the salsa was blank and gross!  However, I would like to add our main entrees were pretty decent because my steak and shrimp were pretty darn good! But My husband ordered the quesadilla burger and it was sadly soggy. Finally we ordered the brownie bites and that was pretty good too.  Also I was considering speaking to the manager about the lack of customer service our waiter had, but when I saw her dancing to the music and signing and hanging out with her employees I figured what the point was if the standard seemed low and she didn't seem to care since it was her hangout time in front of the customers!  Lastly, he brought us our check and didn't even offer us if we wanted something else like dessert?! When he came and brought us our dessert he sort of threw it on the table. My husband was real irritated with this guy and so was I! Like what's the point of you working here and trying to serve us?! This place seriously needs a reality check and is not just some random bar that is a hangout spot!  Sorry this is the last time we will be coming back here and everyone else should run too! Not unless your desperately hungry and there is no other choice! Trust me people this is a last resort! We definitely will not be coming back here and that's a fact!"
Matthew A.,"Livermore, CA",18,14,4,2.0,11/4/2016,Really nice server and a overall friendly environment... but portion sizes for what you pay for isn't really worth it... very over priced for only mediocre food. Bland generic food. Over priced fast food in disguise as a sit down restaurant.
Tramy V.,"San Leandro, CA",250,431,1092,4.0,2/23/2017,"Great combinations for their lunch specials! Good quality food, well priced, nice staff! Plenty of seating! We'll be back!"
Joshua T.,"Dublin, CA",104,191,246,2.0,4/13/2017,"Service is ok, most of the food is typical.  The only thing that brings me back here time and again is the double-crunch fried shrimp...fantastic.  Tasty, def crunchy, and a good amount for an order.  Don't hate..give it a try and you'll come back to Applebee's like I do."
April G.,"Walnut Creek, CA",90,6,4,1.0,12/31/2016,Waited a hour before we got our meal hardly what i expect seeing as the place was dead biggest problem with this was my wattriss as well as other staff were all gossiping i had to walk up ask for a refill of my water just disappointed
Dexter D.,"San Leandro, CA",32,450,1304,4.0,12/20/2015,"Before two recent visits, I hadn't been to an Applebee's in nearly 10 years. I'm generally not a fan of chain restaurants. Formulary food and scripted service don't excite us.  My two visits have been on Thursday evenings around 9pm. Our group has been 4 and 8 diners, all with separate checks. The servers have always been friendly, accommodating and never complained about the separate checks.  The food has been decent. No, not gourmet, but not slophouse either. Always hot, flavorful and as advertised.  No, I still won't go out of my way to hit up a chain restaurant, but this Applebee works for a late after meeting dinner."
Joyce T.,"Hayward, CA",17,129,36,2.0,7/10/2017,"I should have read reviews before we went there.  VERY disappointed in the food for $100.  We ordered three 8 oz steaks and all tasted like they had been frozen.  Very hard to cut and hard to even put the fork into once we cut them.  I never use A1 Sauce, but needed it on these.  Salads were just ok for $4.75 ea.  Beans and broccoli were good, everything else not.  Ordered the mac and cheese for my granddaughter and it was super salty and hard. My fries were good.  Overall a very disappointing meal.  Waitress was nice.  Will not be going here again, ever.  Kids had eaten in Applebee's down south and said it was great....well, not here unfortunately."
George F.,"San Ramon, CA",3627,1078,6006,2.0,4/20/2015,It's Friday night 10:15 pm and late night food choices in the Tri-Valley is very limited.  Option (1) speak into a speaker box and drive up to the second window and get your dinner wrapped in paper or in a box. Option (2) Get insulted by the Naan Nazi's at Shalimar Option (3) Go to Dublin and choose from Lazy Dog Restaurant 40 min wait Option (4) Go to Applebee's no wait open till 1 am across the shopping center from Lazy Dog Restaurant. Wound up with option 4. It was the Pre-Yelp for me since the last time I had set foot into Applebee's and it was as if time stopped and it was eerily familiar. We were seated right away even though the place was relatively busy. (must be the millions well spent on advertisements). We were given two menus each along with the drink menu and the dessert menus as well a electronic tablet on the table. The tablet was on the blink until our server changed the battery pack.  We looked at the drink options and ordered the mango lemonade and the Corona Rita with a Tequila Casedores Reposado upgrade option for $1 more. The drinks were excellent and the highlight of the meal. plus stars Food choices for the night were : Chips and Salsa Shredded Pork Nachos Crosscut BBQ ribs Chicken tortilla soup.  All off the pub menu choice of three items smaller plates $12.95.  All were equaling BAD! The Chicken Tortilla Soup which per the server was newly made but came last was terrible. The Cross Cut Ribs still had cuts of bone and grissle from the band saw used to cross cut the rib.  Minus stars Service was good. And with the new tablet you can pay and get out fast. Plenty of parking.
Chad B.,"Bakersfield, CA",426,11,,5.0,7/6/2017,"We had such an awesome experience. We were there on Independence Day and it wasn't busy (luckily for us). We were seated promptly, and our awesome server came to get drinks super fast after we sat down! She was super nice and very attentive for the whole meal -which was DELICIOUS! Will definitely be back sometime again"
Ahmad H.,"Concord, CA",115,9,,1.0,3/6/2017,"Walked in on a slow Sunday night with still a couple hours left till they closed. The hostess named Rachel walked up and just looked at us. Literally just looked at us until it was too awkward for us not to say something even though she didn't greet us at all. We asked for a table for four and she walked us over. First thing she does after we sit is ask the waiter if he ""wants us"". He said something along the lines of this table being somebody else's responsible. It was made very clear we weren't a priority and that we weren't wanted. If it was just before close I would understand but it was still early and we were being treated as if we weren't even there. Terrible, never going back to this location."
Arvaks F.,"Coos Bay, OR",0,1,,1.0,7/20/2017,I went here they didn't bring my son's food and my burger that was supposed to have tomato pickles ect. All I got was burnt burger with cheese mt wife got burnt chicken and over cooked mashed potatoes for lunch. Honestly this place needs new management and better cooks
Jeff Y.,"Oakley, CA",0,42,,4.0,10/6/2017,"Went for Happy Hour on Friday night about 5:00.  Fairly busy.   I think our server was also the bartender.  So service was non-existent as to be expected when your server is the bartender on a Friday during Happy Hour.  Food was good.  No complaints except the burger was a bit greasy.  The boneless wings, mozzarella sticks, and steak quesadilla were delicious.  Drinks were good."
Nathan H.,"Glendora, CA",113,88,7,2.0,5/19/2017,"I'm actually embarrassed writing about an Applebees because ... well everybody knows what Applebee's is all about.  :-)  However, I travel quite a bit to the Bay Area and often get stuck at a hotel near this shopping center, and the only reason I eat at Applebee is because I'm too lazy to go anywhere else after work.  This place is actually a solid 1 food wise.....I honestly don't know how this chain with bland unimaginative airplane tasting food stays in business period.  I do, however, want to give a shout out to the bartending staff that works here.  They always go above and beyond the call of duty to keep their ""regulars"" happy."
Traci A.,"San Leandro, CA",0,10,2,5.0,6/24/2017,"I always love coming here because the wait is usually not long. I get the sirloin with broccoli, it's very good and reasonably priced! Our waiter Jesse was pleasant and helpful when looking for a store nearby. We didn't have to wait long for our food or our check which made my meal even more enjoyable."
Ale S.,"Pleasanton, CA",162,2,,1.0,6/21/2017,Went there with a friend and sat for 30 minutes with no one talking to us. No waiter came to even give us water. There weren't even many people there. When a waiter finally came to our table it was to ask us to move and we did only sit down and be ignored again. I dont mind moving it was the fact that we were totally ignored so we got up and left and went to chilis for a better menu within the same price range.
Sharon G.,"Dublin, CA",0,6,,5.0,8/12/2016,"If you get the opportunity to go to Applebee's at Hacienda Crossing in Dublin ask for Benjamin's section.  He was quick, efficient, friendly and helpful with the menu. He made recommendations that gave us more food for less money.   My husband and I appreciated the service we received tonight, it's rare nowadays that you get get good customer service with a smile."
Kaytey P.,"Dayton, NV",432,3,,2.0,5/31/2017,"Tonight I wanted to try something different so my boyfriend & I chose Applebee's. We walked in sat at the bar had an amazing bartender. She was so polite & wonderful. We ordered the appetizer platter I ordered a couple things & boneless chicken wings with buffalo sauce. The part that got me, they looked worse than McDonald's nuggets & the buffalo sauce looked so fake. Tried one & all of the chicken and as so COLD I had to send them back plus send another item I chose back that had chicken in it! I will not go back to eat food ever!"
Sheila C.,"Fremont, CA",35,88,22,4.0,9/5/2016,"Although, it's the usual Applebee's menu, our server Katheryn S., was amazing. She even gave me soda water with mango flavor. I normally do not like sparkling water but my fetus does and I guess I'm an enabler. ;) The steamed brocolli wasn't too salty and my kid loved the Mac n cheese."
Verna V.,"Union City, CA",94,24,39,1.0,12/18/2016,"I came in here for a quick bite with the family, and will probably never come here again. The service was terrible, meals came late and cold. I literally had to ask the servers for everything .  I could barely stand it and just wanted to leave. Thanks Applebee's in the hacienda crossings for disappointing my life.  Zero stars . BYE."
Chris L.,"Stockton, CA",146,15,3,1.0,2/26/2017,Have to say worst service ever. Hostess was more worried about the party for her 21st birthday the night before than the guest and the way ahe talked was not normal. Waitress was slow on getting orders. She brought out our salads but it took another 5 minutes and having to get her to have something to eat it with. Finally got the food and my chicken was burnt but wasn't going to wait even longer. And to pay for the food.... We never saw our server again even after waiting 10 minutes to pay. Good thing we were paying cash or I think we would have just walked out on it. Will never return.
Laci L.,"Camarillo, CA",0,19,4,1.0,7/19/2017,I love Applebee's. Unfortunately the reviews on yelp are accurate. The service was not great. If we needed anything such as napkins and to go boxes it would take long for her to bring it back because she was chitchatting with her coworkers on the other side of the restaurant. The fries were stale and cold and the taco was cold as well. I will not come back to this specific applebees.
Candice P.,"New Haven, CT",80,83,570,4.0,6/15/2016,Great service and food! Mike and I came here for dinner on a Wednesday night and our service was on pointe. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.
Justin B.,"San Francisco, CA",3,10,6,1.0,3/27/2016,"Easter Sunday, haven't been to an Applebee's in a long time thought we would give it a shot - walked in pretty empty and hostess right away didn't seem to want to even seat us she hardly spoke. Then we sat down our waiter didn't seem to happy about starting us off with waters (we always start with water, I also barely put my purse down when he asked so no time to decide anything anyways) then when he came to order our food I asked if I could try the green goddess dressing to see if I liked it and he sarcastically says ""is just ranch and avocado"" so I politely asked if I could still see if I liked it - it was extremely uncomfortable and uninviting so our family decided to walk out at that point. It wasn't worth having a bad meal so we went elsewhere for lunch  We won't be coming back to this location unless a complete overall of staff"
max s.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,83,8,1.0,1/16/2017,The host Ligg was horrible rude took ppl after me the bar tender refused to serve the table and there no server in bar horrible place!
Melissa V.,"Petaluma, CA",70,9,2,1.0,12/28/2016,There was a full waiting area with 9 empty tables one hostess and a crazy long wait. Terrible service.
Maya M.,"Dublin, CA",0,7,2,1.0,12/9/2016,Worst Applebee's I have ever been to... Our shrimp was raw  on our steak they didn't add strawberry to the strawberry lemonade like seriously how does that even happen very lazy no effort for providing good customer service let alone quality food
Nancy B.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,12,,1.0,12/23/2016,"APPLE BEES - DUBLIN Sloppy service, Irresponsible n rude managers Managers have no time to address the concerns of customer. Lets avoid going to this place till they learn to treat customers right."
Amanda B.,"Goshen, NY",242,3,,1.0,4/23/2017,I work as a server myself and I have to say that my experience today was just god awful. My husband and I stopped in real quick for just some appetizers and it took almost an hour from start to finish. I understand if the kitchen is backed up it might take a little while but the place was hardly busy. Our server seemed to be in his own world wandering around the place aimlessly. He actually forgot to bring us water! I made eye contact with him and that seemed to remind him. Than another 10 minutes for a cherry limeade that not only had a gnat floating on top but was half melted leading me to believe that it was sitting around for a little while before he brought it over to us. Food finally came out and my salad had cheese even though I asked for none. Too hungry to wait for a new one so ate it anyways. Asked for more sour cream and had to remind him two more times before actually receiving it. He actually walked over to us midway through our meal with a burger asking if that was ours. Were his customers! How does he not know that we didn't order a burger!? Every table of his seemed irritated and I certainly don't blame them. Never in my life have I left a 10% tip and even that felt like too much. Definitely never going back.
Theresa C.,"Dublin, CA",0,41,,1.0,7/11/2017,"We stopped eating here years ago and thought we'd give them another chance. Ordered online to go. Big mistake. My husband's chicken salad was Ok enough but I ordered fish & chips. The fish was frozen and tasted like it could have come from Costco. I asked for chips (fries) and paid extra to substitute grilled veggies for the coleslaw. So that must have been too difficult since I received nasty tasteless coleslaw and mushy veggies. I couldn't eat either. At least we got $5 off with their online coupon, but we are done with them."
Duke Vespa P200E D.,"East Bay, CA",0,66,,5.0,6/12/2016,"Wow - great service and food! Was nervous after reading the negative posts.  Family dinner Sat evening.  Great attentive service, food came out fast, tasty and great deal on 2 for $25/$20.   The waiter and the rest of the staff were friendly and courteous contrary to what others experienced.  Maybe the management listened and focusing on service? So give it a try!"
