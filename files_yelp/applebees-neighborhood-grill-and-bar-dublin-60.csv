Kevin L.,"Mountain View, CA",2,48,,1.0,4/16/2011,"It wasn't my choice to come here, but someone in our group wanted to, so no prob, I'll check it out. Got the 2 entree for $20 deal. The food sounded pretty good from the menu, but it was really quite disappointing when it arrived. Sometimes meat on a skillet being a little burnt is a good thing, but my dish was overly burnt. Even though it wasn't very busy, service wasn't quite fast enough either."
Mandy J.,"San Jose, CA",58,95,80,3.0,8/25/2009,"I've eaten here several times now, some visits are better than others, but we keep coming back. I give Applebee's 3-stars overall, only because I don't particularly care for most of the dishes on the menu.  I've only had less-than-desirable service on maybe one or two occasions out of maybe a few dozen visits. I recommend this place mostly for lunch and happy-hour times.  Dinner they seem to get a bit busy and the service quality declines a bit."
Rich Cha K.,"San Jose, CA",2,78,,2.0,3/3/2012,"I have an idea that this food is just not fresh.  I maybe wrong but I think everything here is just microwave dinners.  All in all I avoid AppleBee's, Chili's, TGI's and places like it but every couple of years I have to go back because someone at work wants to go there.  It just reconfirms my hatred for the the awful food they serve.  I do a lot of cooking myself so I know what real food tastes like. They trick people by loading their food with Salt,  Sugar  and Fat and Carbs.  I would never take my kids her in fear of them wanting to go here again since they are using the worst tricks to get people to eat this nutritionally worthless food."
Sean P.,"Pleasanton, CA",88,28,,3.0,2/29/2012,I hate this place but it's cheap.. so I cant really complain.. believe it or not I dont think this place is worth 2 stars or whatever.. i think it is at least 3.5.... that food was better than last visit I had here.. and the happy hour makes this place so much cheaper... 2 for 20.. my goodness.. its a bargain.. i guess.. what mmore yhou gon expect when you pay 20 bucks.. for the price its a bargain.. it does alright..
Lexi T.,"Marina, CA",36,9,,5.0,7/8/2012,"Went here with my boyfriend a few weeks ago on a week night and it was really empty.  Our food was pretty good but I gave it five stars because when I requested something they didn't carry, the waiter went to a neighboring place just to get it for me since it was slow. Best service I've ever had.  Decent prices and I also love how easily available the nutrition info is."
Diana L.,"Fresno, CA",421,142,20,3.0,11/27/2011,"Inexpensive place for food and drinks.  The food is not the best, but I do like the hot wings!  And their $20 deal is pretty good too."
Matt D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,7,4,1.0,12/20/2010,This is probably the worst Applebees I will ever visit in my lifetime. My med-rare steak was cooked via microwave GG
Lisa F.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/2/2011,"Wow!! As a family we choose to go to Applebee's  for tea, what a mistake! We sat waiting for 15 min before being asked if we would like drinks, after we eventually ordered food ( starter and main ) the starter arrived, and about 5 min later our main meal arrived, we had barely eaten the starter, so the guy just piled up the table a little bit more. We said we hadn't expected the main so soon after the starter arrived, we were told well it's here and ready!! Not even half way through out main and were were given menus and asked if we wanted desert?? Errrrm no thanks we are still eating!! It's not even like they were busy, so we couldn't understand the rush at all. So all in all a not so nice visit to Applebee's don't think we will be going back tbh! The guy was very short and seemed like he really didn't want to be there."
P L.,"Dublin, CA",0,7,1,1.0,4/26/2013,Came here last nite with my fiance for the first time. The service was decent but the food tasted horrible. The steak seriously had the texture of chicken and the pasta had congealed grease and butter. To make things worse we both had diarrhea all nite. I don't know if we're just sensitive but i'm pretty sure it was the food here is just bad.
A. L.,"Dublin, CA",42,78,14,4.0,11/14/2011,"I'm sad to see this location get so many bad reviews. everytime we go, we have great service...but thats because we always have the same waiters. Mercedes, the bartender. We've been there other times and our servers in the booths aren't that great..but Mercedes always gives us awesome service and remembers us each time we go in. The happy hour prices for their drinks and appetizers is great! And when I go with the girls...$1 jello shots! They also have a BUNCH of TV's in the bar to watch the sports games. Definitely recommend this place if you're sitting at the bar and she's your server."
Cammi S.,"Livermore, CA",142,101,7,1.0,1/3/2011,"3 Strikes for you Applebee's! You're totally out! I HATE the Livermore Applebee's because of the poor service they always present, and that was why I stick to ordering curbside, so I don't waste my money tipping at a place where management obviously does NOT care about their staff performance! This was my first choice for dinner on 12/30/10 as a last night staying at the Hyatt Place for my birthday getaway. We had a 20 minute wait, to begin with, and I don't mind that at all. I've waited an hour and a half at Outback Steakhouse plenty of times before. When we finally got sat, no one greeted us for like 13 minutes, and when our server Shasta finally arrived, she took the drink orders, and she looked absolutely lost, and then told me how cute my phone case was. I was still pretty patient at this time, even though I've seen her walk past our table within that 13 minute radius without any kind of acknowledgement.  I am not known to flag people down, because as a server, I know how that feels. But 13 minutes?!  We ordered a diet Coke, and water, and was still deciding on the menu. Shasta did not come back with our drinks even after 7 minutes have gone by, and then when she finally had the chance to stop for a second, she said she was coming back to take our order. I was starving and I told her that we weren't going to stay, because I didn't know when she was actuallyr eally coming back. We got up to leave, and I am just too drained to talk to a useless manager at an Applebee's, so I told the hostess that we were leaving due to poor, slow service. I work at an even busier place with even more demanding people than this, and not once do I not at least initially greet them. I  am done, Applebee's of NorCal. Your boneless buffalo wings is really not worth the horrible dining experience we keep getting every time we give you a chance. Should try taking examples at the Applebee's in the East Coast. Might learn a thing or two about customer service."
Tori Y.,"Danville, CA",21,16,,2.0,6/10/2013,The food and the deals are good but the service is SO SLOW. It wasn't even that busy and it took the waitress forever to get us our needs and I kept having to bug the hostess (who was very helpful). Also the waitress barely checked on us and didn't check if our drinks needed to be refilled. Shameful! Me and my friend refused to tip her.
Ramki K.,"San Ramon, CA",5,25,,1.0,12/19/2012,"Should have read reviews before going....Service is horrible. It was a party of two and we were seated after a wait of 5 minutes. yayy! that was the best part and then went downhill from there..Nobody came to take our order, the Hostess came and took my drink order after 15 minutes. The waiter came to the table to check on what my drink order was after another 5 minutes. She took our order and then she took orders from 2 more tables before putting that in the computer. and I finally got my drink 30 minutes after we were seated and that too a wrong one. It took them over 50 minutes to bring out our appetizer-trio. we asked for small plates which never came. then the food came in another 10 minutes after that. The portions were small for the prices. I would rather go to Black Angus and pay extra for the service and portions. I'm giving them a star for their ok food! I'm never going back to this Applebees ever again"
Brian H.,"Idaho Falls, ID",115,12,1,3.0,2/2/2009,"I've eaten here several times now, some visits are better than others, but we keep coming back. Jorge was our waiter last time, and he was excellent. I'm not a big fan of most of the food there, however there are a few dishes that I enjoy very much.  The Crispy Orange Chicken Bowl is usually pretty good, as is the Fiesta Lime Chicken.  Boneless Buffalo Wings are off the hook, and their sliders are to die for!  You also gotta try the loaded mashed potatoes - they're awesome.  Not to mention the desserts are really good as well. I give Applebee's 3-stars overall, only because I don't particularly care for most of the dishes on the menu.  I've only had less-than-desirable service on maybe one or two occasions out of maybe a few dozen visits. I recommend this place mostly for lunch and happy-hour times.  Dinner they seem to get a bit busy and the service quality declines a bit."
Tony X.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/9/2010,"This is one of the worst chain-restaurant experience I've ever had.   - Waiter's service was bad.  She was cold (no greeting), slow and had a ""I'm just doing my job"" attitude; - We ordered $20 entree + 2 main dish package.  The entree never arrived, even after we FINISHED the main dishes; - We asked several waiters about checking on the entree - nobody cared.  Even the waiter that was suppose to service our table never came and explained what happened; - We called the manager, the manager said she was the one who delivered the entree, to the WRONG table.  But she didn't show that was the service at fault.  Her tone sounded like it was not a big deal and she wouldn't care. I was very frustrated with the experience.  With competitions from Chili's, TGI Friday, Red Robins, and so many more, price is not the only thing that lure people to your place - Service Matters! Applebee Dublin will be on my blacklist for a while.  I also definitely will consider an alternative before choosing to dine at another Applebee again."
Chris H.,"Union City, CA",59,38,30,3.0,7/4/2012,"food isn't the best, customer service isn't the best, but happy hour prices are amazing. only reason I keep coming back"
Frances A.,"Dixon, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/14/2014,"Visited the restaurant 01/06/14 with my mother and sister.  Arrived before 300pm, and ordered drinks.  We called the waitress to our table to take advantage of the ""lunch"" menu prices.  When she came, we told her we were ordering from the lunch menu, and she said we were too late because it was after 300pm.  We all pulled out our cell phones (she pulled out her phone too), and told her it was only 257pm.  Looking at the clock on the wall, she said they went by their clock's time (which was five minutes fast), so we were out of luck. My sister told her the menu didn't say anything about the restaurant's clock, so she grudgingly took our order.  I failed to mention that when we walked into the restaurant, an elderly couple also walked in with us and there was only one other couple eating in the entire restaurant. After 20 minutes, we hadn't been served our soups or salad even though the elderly couple had finished their appetizer and were now eating their lunches.  We looked around and our waitress was sitting at the bar socializing with some male customers.  Quite angry, got up to leave and asked for the manager.  After explaining the waitress' bad attitude and poor service, her comment to us was, ""What do you want me to do?""  Yikes! A savvy manager would have tried to salvage this situation by saying, ""I'm sorry about your experience with us; let me make it up by doing this .....""  Needless to say, we're never going back to this restaurant. To top it all off, after I described our bad experience to an acquaintance and a cousin, they both said they heard nothing but negative comments about this particular Applebee's and it's bad reputation was widely known in this area.  Maybe we should gotten the clue when we walked in and saw there was only one other customer sitting at a table!"
Loving J.,"Pleasanton, CA",4,21,,2.0,5/27/2008,"I was kinda disappointed in this place. We went over on a late Saturday night and there was not wait. Ordered the Shrimp salad and it came out really good. My brother wasn't really impressed with the service. The waiter didn't ask if we wanted water or desert. We wanted both and we left with none. It also took our food forever to come. My brothers GF ordered another drink and the waiter argued with my brother about how she couldnt make the drink any stronger which irritated him even more.   The boneless buffalo wings left my brother and partner with a stomach ache the next day.: Sorry to say, we left without tipping and I usually don't do that."
Sandeep R.,"Burlingame, CA",252,117,1,4.0,3/4/2011,"I don't know why this place has such a low rating but my experience here was actually pretty pleasant. Maybe I caught it after the storm lol. The service was good, the girl who was serving us did an exceptionally good job at serving us. I tried an entree from the 550 Calorie menu and it tasted pretty good. wasn't smothered in oil or garnished with melting cheese, it was good to taste and I had  a good dinner. Thats all I really care about."
jessie c.,"Albany, CA",0,11,,1.0,12/15/2012,"Terrible. I came in for lunch and it takes forever to get my food. 30min after ordering and still waiting. Going to miss my movie time. And the place is half empty, what takes them so long?! As I'm typing the food is here, and the shrimp is cold. What a joke"
