Honey H.,"Fremont, CA",20,78,8,4.0,8/5/2014,"We ordered the 2/$20 entrees and the blacken chicken Penn tastes great! The drink is a bit expensive ($3.95 for a lemonade) but other than that, the 2/$20 is a great deal!"
Kassy A.,"San Ramon, CA",14,80,23,1.0,3/8/2015,"GO TO THE SAN RAMON location! My bf and I decided to switch it up and try this location last night. Horrific experience. Once we were seated we had to wait a good 10 minutes just for our waiter to come by, her name was Teresa. Before she came to our table she spent 10 minutes bussing two tables and chatting it up with the hostess on how to be a good server. Completely ironic that she was being a completely poor one by not attending to us before bussing a table and chatting it up. She was so close to us (literally the booth behind us) and no one else was in her section so it was clear that we were waiting. I would have fired this waitress on the spot if I was the manager. Never coming back."
Juanita N.,"Ceres, CA",3,115,21,2.0,7/11/2015,Good service.  Horrible food.  I thought a franchise meant all food tasted the same.  Well not at this location.  Not recommended.
Michelle P.,"Fairfield, CA",135,225,174,2.0,4/7/2014,"This is one of our go-to places for dinner.... and every time... the service is usually mediocre! Fortunately for them, they have dishes that are affordable and please the family so we end up coming back despite their shortfalls in service."
Lauren C.,"Orange, CA",83,17,,2.0,12/31/2013,"I don't know what the heck I was expecting from Applebees, but whatever. My friends made me go here because we had just gotten out of a movie. First of all, the restaurant was basically empty and yet we still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. Our waitress seemed genuinely miserable to be serving us. We ordered the 2 for 20 deal, which came with a lot of food, which was good for the price we paid. The problem is, the mac and cheese that my friend ordered had bacon in it (he can't eat bacon because of his religion). There was no information on the menu that said that the meal would come with bacon, they just put it on without asking. I found that to be pretty insensitive, the waitress should have asked first instead of making assumptions. When my friend explained that he couldn't eat bacon, the waitress told him to order something different on the menu. I kept asking why he couldn't just have the same mac and cheese, only without the bacon sprinkled on. She explained that she couldn't do that because ""it just came with bacon""... I literally don't think she comprehended a word I was saying. Anyways, my friend ended up ordering some food that he didn't even want. Luckily the manager was excellent and took the meals we didn't want off our tab. She worked very hard to redeem the situation, and was very friendly, which is why I'm giving this review 2 stars instead of 1. I never wanted to come here but now that I've been, I guarantee I will never go back."
Krishna Y.,"Pleasanton, CA",2,81,20,4.0,6/26/2015,I have stopped by a few times before the movie for some wings and beer. The price are not expensive and the food tastes good as well and the folk make pretty good drinks as well.  Now the layout does not look ultra modern nor is it worn down completely.  They give many coupons as you join their apple bees club as well. Service was timely the few times I had been here.
Carmel S.,"Elk Grove, CA",103,87,49,1.0,8/13/2013,"4/7/13: Where do I begin? It started out OK, the hostess was nice, she sat us near the tv we wanted to be by. The server came promptly, but here's where it went down hill. Mind you, when you are working in the restaurant business, customer service is everything. NO ""Hello."" Not once did he check up on us.  We order the following:  * Chicken Won Ton Tacos (bland) * Beef Sliders (dry, looked like it was slapped together cause the cheese was not even melted all the way) * Fried Green Beans (madd salty! You could literally see the grains of excess salt on the plate!) *Cherry Limeade *Strawberry Limeade (I've had better) The food was horrible! Definitely not worth the price we paid. But we were so famished and tired from being on the road all day we succumbed to just scarfing it.    Drinks took almost 10 minutes. Food took about another 15.  Someone else brought our food. I wanted to see how long it would before he noticed we were done, cause he sure was making sure everyone around us was accommodated to their liking (the entire restaurant was slow, as in not busy.) We waited patiently for 15 minutes for the check. Our server never came out. I had to literaly had to get off my chair and flag him down. When he finally got the check, these were his exact words, ""Here ya go"" and walked off. NO ""Thank You"" or ""How was everything?""  For the record we are very generous tippers. I could deal with the bad food, but bad service is just un-acceptable!! Our server got what he deserved: a whole bunch of nothing! Gave exact change and left.  It's ironic that my review is from 4/17/13.. yet reading the last 3 recent reviews (8/1/13) the rating is 1 star and the horrible service is the only thing that seems to be consistent. I sincerely hope the Management at this Applebee's reads these reviews and takes this as constructive criticism. Serious changes need to be made."
Christine M.,"Merced, CA",7,14,20,1.0,6/27/2015,"Negative 3 stars!!!  Horrible service, or no service actually. Walked into a filthy unattended hostess station. Waited 7 minutes to be greeted. After being seated and perusing the menu, we sat and watched 6 servers and the manager walk by with no acknowledgement. After waiting 15 minutes, we got up and spoke to the 3 servers and manager at the hostess station (doing nothing) and expressed my displeasure with their lack of customer service, before walking out the door. My hard earned money deserves better..."
Margarita A.,"Modesto, CA",3,55,30,1.0,2/15/2015,If I  could give minus stars i would!! Dirty place look at the benches  they have food on them and the menus are  filthy ! I got food poising from the Mac and cheese. Waiters shirts are un clean. Really sad Cuz I loved this place before
M J.,"Dublin, CA",1,32,9,1.0,11/12/2014,Just stay away... ate here on 11/11/14 and food is either overcooked or undercooked.  Dirty and a food safety nightmare waiting to happen.  Thanks for a horrible meal.  Never again.
Steve H.,"Riverbank, CA",1,21,10,1.0,5/18/2015,"Worst Applebees I think I've ever had the displeasure of stopping at. horrible service,  the manager had to take our order at the bar and couldn't even work the register, the order wasn't made correctly. The bartender was obnoxious made us feel like we were bothering him, restaurant wasn't even half full."
Jericho L.,"Dublin, CA",131,5,,2.0,10/24/2013,"Let us start off with the fact that I never liked Applebee's to begin with, but with this experience...yeah i still don't like them.  When I had my experience there it was at night and it was a slow night too so there should be no reason that they took so long with our order, seating, and even following up on us. It may have been understaffed and it may have not. But all I know is, if you got at least 2 hours to spare then dine in. Yet don't expect the food to be extravagant either. I rather have gone a few miles down to the nearest chillis."
Monica H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",13,15,2,3.0,8/23/2013,"Came here tonight with my daughters (4 and 7). When we arrived the hostess was talking (a foot away from the podium) to another employee and there were two other guys at the hostess podium. No one greeted us. After a few minutes I finally asked if we could get added to the list to be seated (there were TONS of open tables). We got seated by a woman named Tia. Service was ok, but food was awful.  My steak was disgusting, covered in more pepper than any human should ever consume; but I am giving this a three rating only because of Tia.  She kept checking in on us, even though she wasn't our server. She engaged my kids and was an overall delight. Great job Tia!!"
Brittany B.,"Hercules, CA",189,35,2,1.0,5/16/2013,"I love Applebee's. I used to go about once a week back home before we moved to CA.  That being said, this location was a much different experience. It was a few minutes before the hostess greeted us, but she was kind enough to apologize. Our waiter spoke to us three times in the hour we were there. Once to get our order, once to set our food down, and once to give us our check. That is it. It was about 9PM on a week night, so it was not very busy. He seemed to be in the back the whole time, and after talking with some acquaintances we saw leaving as we were coming in, they confirmed that they had experienced the same lack of service but with a different waiter.  The wait staff needs to know the products, check on dining guests, and remember to bring out drinks when they are ordered. We will probably try a different location next time."
Jack W.,"Dublin, CA",0,6,19,5.0,3/19/2014,Great 3 course meal for a great price! Really good food and value. The service is always satisfactory. The place is always kept clean. The food is great and we have yet to find anything wrong with it. We love the discount kids meals on Wednesday. Family friendly and lives up to the standards of a neighborhood grill.
Samuel N.,"San Jose, CA",3,14,3,3.0,4/11/2015,"Had a late lunch here on Tuesday, I got the half turkey, bacon, avocado and tortilla soup. The food was good however the service was really slow. It was rather empty at the time and plenty of employees which is the reason for the 3 stars."
Bill M.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,12,1,1.0,4/10/2015,"Okay. I know this Applebee's, but this experience reminded me why I don't go here anymore. The menu has been ""simplified"" and it took me 15 minutes to find something I wanted to eat. Ordered a 3 item sampler and got all 3 items at different times. Server left a stack of cups from another table on our table and never cleared them. Ordered a coffee with desert, when server brought desert he said he'd go get coffee. That never came. Two words ""never again."" This lovely meal for 2 cost a whopping $55."
Leana L.,"San Francisco, CA",322,889,281,2.0,3/12/2011,"During my four years in college, Applebee's became a staple whenever my parents came to visit. So now, I cringe after hearing someone suggest going to Applebee's. However, we needed to grab a quick dinner in order to catch a movie at 8pm. We arrived at around 6:30pm, waited less than five minutes, and were seated at one of the high tables surrounding the bar area. After getting our menus, our waiter acknowledged us as he went to tend to a neighboring table.  Normally, I like their Grilled Shrimp 'N Spinach Salad (dressing on the side), but instead, I felt like mixing it up. After browsing the extensive menu (seriously took me at least five minutes to skim through it all), I decided to try the Grilled Dijon Chicken & Portobellos (without the cheese) off of their ""Under 550 Calories"" menu. Actually, they list the calorie content for all of their dishes! My parents ordered off of the ""2 for $20"" menu and got the Spinach & Artichoke dip with two orders of the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp. My sister also ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp, but just by itself. About 10-15 minutes later, we finally received the Spinach & Artichoke dip appetizer. Granted, they were getting busy, but that's a long time to wait to get an appetizer! I know someone who used to work at Applebee's and she even admitted that most of the food is prepackaged and just heated up before being served. On top of that, the dip wasn't even hot! It was just mildly warm. Served with a small side of salsa, the chips were clearly greasy because you could see a shine on them. The dip it self was okay. I enjoyed the salsa more so just because the kick it had was more flavorful than the dip. Another 10-15 minutes later, our entrees arrived... Well, most of our entrees. My parents go their Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp dishes and I got my Grilled Dijon Chicken & Portobellos. However, it was another solid 5 minutes before my sister got her Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp. There's no good excuse for such a delay except for the fact that they forgot it or someone took it for another table. Finally, my sister got her dish (without mushrooms, as requested). My dish was surprisingly tasty! I expected it to be nothing special, but there's something about that white Dijon sauce that nicely flavored the chicken. The peppers and mushrooms were also nicely grilled. The ""assorted vegetables"" it came with turned out to just be one giant piece of steamed broccoli. Also, the herb potatoes just appeared to be unseasoned steamed potatoes -- I tried a bite and decided it wasn't worth eating. My parent's dishes looked pretty good, but obviously covered in grease because everything was so shiny! They were served piping hot and you could hear the sizzle on the cast iron serving dish! I didn't get to try any of the shrimp or potatoes, but I did try a bite of the chicken. It was a little dry and not very flavorful, but everyone pretty much finished off their plates, so it must have been pretty good, or at least decent. It was about 7:15 by the time we finished up and requested the check -- just in time to grab our things and head out to the movie theater. Oh Applebee's, you've become a staple in my life for quick, decent food. No matter how many iffy or average experiences I have, I always find myself coming back every now and then. One of the things I do like about this place is the fact that they have low calorie options for those who don't want to consume a day's worth of calories in one meal."
Suzanne C.,"Castro Valley, CA",41,11,13,2.0,11/2/2014,The food was average. The service was disappointing. The entire staff seemed to be on downers. No motivation at all.
Cristina C.,"Discovery Bay, CA",86,12,3,1.0,7/14/2016,"All of the workers here are complete SNOBS! Came here a couple of months ago for my boyfriend's birthday with a couple of friends. As we got seated, I saw our waiter look at our table and roll his eyes. He probably thought we weren't going to tip him well, because we were a lot younger than the rest of the clientele. He literally acted like we just killed his dog, and he was now forced to serve us! It was bizarre! So my boyfriend asked for a Long Island, and was immediately carded. The waiter looked at his I.d. and laughed and told him he couldn't accept if because one corner was broken off. (All information was intact as well as the magnetic strip.) We asked him if he could ask a manager, being that it was my boyfriend's birthday. Again he rolled his eyes and stomped to the back like a two year old put in time-out. He came back 30 seconds later and told us that his manager wouldn't take it either, with an evil smirk. So my boyfriend just took his I.d. back and excused himself to use the restroom. One of our friends then tried to order a drink, and asked POLITELY what brands of whiskey they offered there. The waiter ROLLED HIS EYES and tapped his pen on his pad and responded, ""*SIGH* Well, what are you looking for?"" At this point, I was shaking and was about to smack a grown man in the face. Instead, I just calmly asked another waiter if I could speak to the manager. Literally a full 5 minutes goes by and not one ""manager"" came to our table. So we just ended up leaving, because we didn't want to create a scene. I just want to say that I find it crazy that people are still so prejudiced!! AVOID THIS PLACE IF YOU PREFER TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT!"
