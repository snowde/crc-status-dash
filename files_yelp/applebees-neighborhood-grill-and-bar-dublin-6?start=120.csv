Jason C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,2,1.0,11/22/2015,"Wish I could make this review a 0 star, but this will do. Poor service, rude staff, and tainted food."
Jim R.,"Castro Valley, CA",1,118,2,1.0,12/3/2014,"Food was salty and came out really slow.  They were busy.  Before sitting down we told both the Server and Host we were going the movies, and asked it there was enough time.  They assured us there was.  By the time our food arrived we had less than 15 minutes to eat."
J R.,"Manteca, CA",2,11,8,3.0,3/14/2015,So our server is Jason. Super sweet let me tell you he is very sweet and patient. Although there is a guy named Benjamin here... rude as hell. There is a way to get things done that does not include being rude to the customer's. Now I generally like this place I've been here a few times but dam Ben really?! No jason big kudos from our party. If you see this we're the ones that had to move tables. Lol
Mani B.,"Campbell, CA",34,23,6,2.0,7/17/2014,Went here recently with my brother only because we thought it was a TGI Friday's. We got to the parking lot and were greatly disappointed but decided to go anyways. The service was okay but the food sucked and it was realllly slow to come out. I guess I should have checked the Yelp first!
Nora S.,"San Francisco, CA",6,95,,3.0,1/9/2016,"Ordered the ribs with salad and fries.  Ribs, salad and fries.  None of it was very good.  My friend was not too happy with her meal either and thought her vegetables were very soft.  The service was good and the portions were plentiful.  I would not go back."
Delna R.,"San Ramon, CA",0,13,,1.0,9/26/2011,"I do believe I just found the remnants of a cockroach in yesterday's leftovers from Applebee's (Dublin). I'm mortified!  Sick, sick, sick!!   I called the restaurant to let them know what happened and the manager was less than sympathetic.  She said she would have the General Manager call me when he is available IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. Wow.   I also remembered that last night there was a couple sitting in the booth behind my husband and I.  I overheard the woman explaining to their waitress that her companion was still in the bathroom vomiting.  The waitress said she would take his meal off the tab.  Ya think???!   I usually don't post negative reviews, but I'm disgusted and I hope this review will prevent others from having the same experience.  This is unacceptable.  I shudder to think what else might be found in that kitchen."
Linda D.,"San Jose, CA",1211,448,1494,4.0,11/3/2011,Every applebees is the same to me! My friends and I just came here after going to the pirates of Emerson haunted houses. I forgot our waitress' name but she was really nice and she split the bill in different parties beforehand without us even saying which was very convenient.  Only downside the blue moon comes in a bottle! I don't know why it didn't come in a tall glass but whateverrrr
Kim H.,"Dublin, CA",59,12,,5.0,1/25/2015,Great experience! Tried black angus first and they turned us away because we were a party of 11. The staff greeted us nicely and entertained the children while we waited. Good service and happy bellies!
Stormtrooper N.,"Daly City, CA",0,89,23,1.0,6/22/2014,"I had the worst experience here. It started when I walked in and the host told us it would be a 25 min wait. But then a lady came and said the host was ""smoking something"" and it should only be a few minutes. I later found out that she was the manager.  Then it took about 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order but we ordered as well just in case he didn't come back for another 15 minutes.  After we ordered it took over 40-45 minutes for our food to come. We asked him to check a while before but it still took a while. I told out server to at least bring out some free appetizers or something since it was taking so long. He never brought anything out.  After being served it took another 30 minutes for him to even check in on us. So I just asked for the check because I wanted to get the hell outta there. While we were waiting for our check, the lady manager was walking around chatting with the customers. She was talking loudly about what she posts on her Facebook page. Oh my."
June B.,"Castro Valley, CA",66,18,,1.0,1/28/2015,"Service was very slow despite only a dozen or so patrons in the restaurant at 12:30 pm. Our waiter was personable but slow. However, my food was less than satisfactory. I ordered the lunch combo of Thai shrimp salad and chicken tortilla soup. The shrimp appeared to be undercooked and the salad dressing had a metallic taste. The tortilla soup was bland. The manager deducted $6 from our bill when I mentioned the shrimp was undercooked. Nevertheless, I won't be returning to any Applebees"
Charles D.,"San Francisco, CA",1,132,8,1.0,9/2/2012,Took forever and service was ridiculous.    I came in when it was relatively slow and it took a good 35 min to get a to go order together.   They gave me the food with no plastic ware or napkins  I'll go somewhere else
Jeremy B.,"Tracy, CA",0,4,3,2.0,9/14/2014,They need to improve their service otherwise this location will probably shut down.two stars are for the bartender.
Ann W.,"San Ramon, CA",1,9,,1.0,1/15/2016,"Rudest hostess ever. Asked to speak to manager after we were seated to inform her, and she didn't really seem to care or apologize. Staff seemed slow and lazy. NO customer service. Isn't this the time for many places to focus on service ?  My chicken salad was still good and that is the only reason to come here. Order take out."
Katie R.,"San Ramon, CA",2,5,,1.0,9/2/2014,"All you can eat ribs..... What a joke! 5 small ribs to kick off (apparently 1lb of ribs - get the weighing scales tested), followed by a 15 minute wait before 4 more, equally small ribs, were brought out. If you advertise as all-you-can eat,  the portion should be more than just an appetiser."
Daryl K.,"Benicia, CA",119,85,22,1.0,3/29/2014,This place is so slow it's ridiculous. On top of that they didn't get my order right! There was no utensils at all and the other waitresses just sat around and talked. The food quality was sub par I will not be back again.
Ann V.,"Lathrop, CA",50,45,4,1.0,5/16/2012,I have never had worse service then the service i had here! I've been here twice and both times the server was extremely rude and orders incorrect. I went here recently on mothers day my order was wrong and the servers response was that there was nothing she could do because they were busy due to mothers day!  I asked to speak to a manager. The manager was very nice and very apologetic for how his employee acted. I hope the manager gets a hold on his employees so he doesn't lose anymore business.
Rae C.,"Stockton, CA",0,5,1,1.0,1/11/2015,"Sucks! Do not waste your money. The baby back ribs were like rubber, the steak was dry, the hamburger and bacon was over cooked, and the waiter kept forgetting what we asked for (silverware, straw, beverage....). To top the night off,  we were told that the manager was on the telephone and could not come and talk  to us. Wow! Such crap customer service. Try one of the other resturant in the area....this one is terrible."
Ashley N.,"Dublin, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/10/2015,"I just had quick and great service. Teresa was my server and Brianna was my hostess. Both of them were wonderful. My burgers were nice and hot and the fries were fresh. My daughter ordered the quesadilla and it was crispy and melty cheese. Thank you, Applebees, for that great customer service. :)"
Mychael H.,"Hayward, CA",528,48,3072,5.0,5/14/2014,Happy Hour time at Applebee's with my friend.  And I like they new menu special. They always comes out with new foods.
Sara B.,"Dublin, CA",4,13,10,1.0,1/11/2014,"The worst place for your food and money  Please do your self a favor and go somewhere else, slow service and bad testing food"
