Julie L.,"Sacramento, CA",493,259,140,3.0,3/19/2012,"Recently came here on a Friday evening with a girl pal...  I had a gift card I could use so I said to my friend ""drinks on me"" ... I had personally never been here on a busy weekend evening so I can't fault the servers for that. place was packed. I actually never realized that applebee's is like ""a night out on the town"" for some people... for me its either fast food or fine dining... anyway! Server 'Colleen' was less than attentive. when we were first seated she didn't greet us warmly. just a shrug and ""Get you anything?"" we said...""water would be nice!"" .... 'kay, she walks off... Next time 'round we order are food/drinks... a moment later she appears with the margaritas. ""OK who had the one on the rocks?"" Neither. We both ordered frozen 'ritas (1) raspberry (1) strawberry. She goes ""U sure?"" UMM.... YEAH... My friend: ""Me too"" ...okay, well let me see if the bartender screwed up.  (Really, its the bartender's fault?) also no apology. Just a shrug. Comes back 'bout 10 minutes later and has to ask us again to taste test 'cause she's not sure which is which 'cause ""they look kinda similar"" REALLY?! You're the server. Before I make this review into a short e-book... service was terrible. She would forget something about every other request. I want a side of blue cheese (check) my friend wants side of ranch (forgot)... her expression stayed the same the whole time!!! NO SMILE..   Great poker face baby, but this ain't Vegas... In the end we asked her to split our check ""Sure! BRB"" ... couldn't even get that right. My friend has both the 'ritas on her bill...which actually should have been mine. We didn't tip very well as expected...and as I say here on Yelp, I am a service over product girl. No excuse for bad service.  I could've at least gotten a smile.......  I'm giving this 3 stars because the food is still above Dennys standards & it was a bad experience mostly for her service- or lack of."
Sushanth B.,"Dublin, CA",3,13,,1.0,3/28/2014,"The fa* Mexican guy at the bar is rude....  The service is bad ,it takes ages for them to get the ordered food.... Go to some other apples bees I would suggest"
Samuel L.,"Livermore, CA",130,27,1,2.0,10/21/2012,"The local Applebees we used to occasionally but now seldom dine at for lunch or dinner.  The reason is because of the poor service.  The food, overall, is okay.  I don't think anyone comes here for anything over  6/10.  Its at a convenient location but with the new BJ's around the corner... I don't know if this is typical in all Applebees but this location does not have a hostess waiting for you at the entrance.  We come in, wait for the hostess to see us from the bar area and then are seated.  It's typical to have 3-4 groups come in and wait for the hostess alone.  This holds true, even when it's not busy.  Good luck getting your drinks refilled. Service is slow and at a snail's pace. I think we'll just head over to BJ's from now on."
Isaac H.,"San Francisco, CA",45,523,459,5.0,6/10/2014,This apple bees rocks. It is big. Don't come here Friday nights and Saturday nights. This location is pack on those days. I love Applebee's good food and good service.
Jojo C.,"San Francisco, CA",106,160,1355,4.0,1/7/2013,"First off let me start this review by saying these guys or (just our server) did a great job on our 1st experience to the Dublin Applebees. I may not be able to relate to the other poor reviews but maybe it was just our lucky day there :) We 1st enter and get seated asap. We do the happy hour special after 9, plenty of booth seating, nice family atmosphere, clean and looks good. We then see a bartender who took care of us immediately ask us for any drinks to start of with, we order to mango margs that our server ""he"" made came out delicious and I'm a bartender that makes these drinks all day long. We get the sliders and mozzarella sticks which came out nice with great presenation. Burgers cooked perfectly then again they make em at all applebees good, my fav. We then ask for another round of mango margs, we get it back, no salt, no lime, and ...no alchohal! Big no for me. I had to take off a star for that. The server quickly recovered and he made it right. The 2nd round was from a lady at the bar talking a customers ear off, not really attending the others, she may have known the guy or something.  Anyways our server, I forgot his name, but stocky guy, has a stiff dry face, could crack a smile sometime, but he did a great job, attending us every 5 min, great timing, everything was right thanks to him. I wish i knew his name but excellent job my friend. And this is coming from a guy at the Country Club on the top of the hill. Right on!"
S R.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,4,,5.0,8/17/2013,Came here with my fam and the service was great! Kyle B was so funny and even interacted with my kids....a BIG deal to me! Food was great and we will def come back to this AppleBee's just because of Kyle B! :)  (Kids even thought he was great!)
Larry O.,"San Ramon, CA",0,19,2,1.0,9/3/2015,"They advertise endless fries, but if the server never comes back except to give you the Bill, which they have you pay on the tablet at the table, you never get more fries. Bate and switch. Don't wars your time."
Maureen P.,"Oakland, CA",228,106,573,2.0,11/4/2012,"Yes, what the other reviews say is true.. Service do kinda suck here. We had a party of ten on a sunday night, but luckily was seated right away because the place was pretty much dead. We ordered our food almost right away since we already knew what we wanted. It took them over 35 minutes to bring out our appetizers. They actually forgot our buffalo wings, so after bringing it to their attention, they brought it out after they brought out our entrees. I ordered the 9oz sirloin with loaded mash and fries. The portions were very generous compared to the other applebees I've been to. My steak was a bit on the salty side so I needed extra sauce with my meat. A couple of my friends did some substitutions for their side but didn't receive what they ordered, which I find weird. Didn't you write everything down? During our whole meal, no one stopped by to check if we needed anything or if everything was ok. We would have to flag them down while they rushed by to even get a refill. Overall, stars for my own food, mostly because of the portions. Negatives: service.. Don't think they like tips by the way they acted."
Truthful Shopper A.,"Modesto, CA",6,25,,1.0,8/28/2015,"Read the reviews after my lunch experience here at this Dublin location. Should have talked to the manager but didn't want to waste my breathe. Not sure if the management is aware of all these bad reviews on this location nonetheless if corporate is aware but my 1 star proves all these other bad reviews true. Arrived at about 3pm, 8/27/2015, and was empty. Well 1-2 people at the actual bar and 1 couple in the actual dinning room floor. Arrived my buddy and I for a quick lunch without thinking twice to spend more near the movie theatre area to try something new. Well, just say Applebee's is pretty much reached the bottom of the Fast food chain behind McDonald's. We sat in the bar section at the big round bar tables. Our experience was Slow paced service, food took unusually long for not being busy at all, and of course 3 girls standing in front of a computer near the bartender, all while the actual bartender serving us and the 2 people at the bar. Bartender who served us did an okay job. Not the best, but she managed to help a few people and maybe she could have asked the other girls for help. Waiting for our food, we knew it was ready after 20 mins upon receiving our wings, and the bartender was too busy to go back and check if our food was ready. Sure enough when we saw her go in the back to ""check,"" she brought our food. 1 min before we were about to get up, pay our $5 wings tab and leave. In the end, the young lady who waited tables to the right of the door did an excellent job, and  as we walked out, we told the lady who sat us down that we should have sat there and skipped the ""quick bar area."" Applebee's has  lost our usual $3-400 tab at the bar when it's guys night and don't think I'll eat at another Applebee's ever again."
Bill F.,"St George, UT",111,17,1,1.0,10/18/2013,The prior reviews were dead-on. Service was slow and food was poor. Drinks were not re-filled despite a slow night and many empty tables. Booth seats were ripped and patched with duct tape. I have been to many Applebees around the country. This was probably the worst.
don s.,"Buena Park, CA",14,36,5,1.0,10/18/2013,"Do not come here during lunch. Waited 10 minutes after we were seated just for drinks. Waited another 15 minutes for order to be taken. Waited an additional 20 minutes for the food to come out. Thats 45 minutes of an hour lunch time. And it wasn't even that busy! Drinks had a funky taste to them. At least, the food was good. Ive been here before during dinner and it was the se thing.  I should have learned my lesson."
Sam Q.,"Cameron Park, CA",6,16,,1.0,7/19/2013,Slowest service I have experienced at an Applebee's. We almost and should have left after being seated but no other acknowledgement for 30 minutes.  All I can say is that it went down hill from there.
Angelica M.,"San Ramon, CA",42,4,,1.0,5/27/2013,"This place is dirty, service is slow, and I can tell they just don't care. Will not visit again."
Kym S.,"Pleasanton, CA",7,20,5,1.0,6/27/2013,"Bad news... Ribs overcooked and  dry, French fries tasty but sparse and the fruit replacement for the coleslaw was ridiculous. They cut a small strawberry in half and put 3 small slices of orange on a plate. That was the fruit side dish.  No wonder they only have 2 stars...  Really?  Is that a good idea, general manager?"
Dylan K.,"Las Vegas, NV",145,24,10,2.0,7/27/2012,"Food is good and happy hour pricing is great. The service sucks. It takes forever to get our bill or service. Water was never filled up and we were barely checked on during our meal to see if we needed anything.   The other night thou, we had a great server Nicholas S. he was great about checking up on us and refilling our drinks!"
Chris P.,"Vacaville, CA",11,55,,1.0,5/26/2013,"yeah don't go here....go to Fuddruckers or maybe Guy Fieri's place (both within walking distance).  Went there for a beer and a bite after a long day at work.  Got a tall beer during happy hour, drank it, and watched the bartender ignore the empty glass I posted for her for about 25 minutes.  When she finally came round to get me another drink I was informed that happy hour was over, by 10 minutes, and the smaller beer I would now get cost more than the first one....nice customer service....when I was ready to split I paid my bill, but there was a delay due to the bartender needing to first wash some glasses and jaw-jack with another employee about something more important than her customers......this place reminded me of the movie ""Waiting..."" for some reason......go figure....."
Adrianna C.,"San Ramon, CA",7,65,12,1.0,5/26/2011,"Just came here last night for the late night happy hour, worst idea ever. Me and some friends were waiting to see the midnight showing of Hanger Part 2 (which was a semi fail).  Here were some of our issues. 1. We didn't know who our waiter was. 2. The manager walked away from us when we tried talking to her. 3. I asked for water twice and never got it. 4. Our food was cold. 5. The margarita I ordered, then canceled bc it was taking forever to get..then the waitress comes to the table with it saying ""it's on the house""..but it still ended on the bill? really? We just came here at the wronggggg time. blah."
Alexis K.,"Mountain House, CA",0,11,,2.0,11/11/2014,"I've been a regular here with my dad for many years. Over time food and service has dwindled down to mediocre quality. I used to love coming here but now the veggies are soggy, sirloins are obviously too small and don't even look healthy. They hired a new staff whom are which too comfortable on the floor. Waitresses gossip about other employees. I heard this 50 ish year old woman complain about the other waitress messing her up with the tables. This woman was rude and made a scene right in front of us. Poor waitresses didn't even know what to do. This place used to be so live. It's no wonder people don't come here anymore."
"Forest, Forest G.","Greensboro, AL",1,49,,1.0,8/4/2015,"Drove by on my way to a WAY better happy hour and the best artichokes for a 30 mile radius next door (at BA, if you can figure it out).  Without Regal Cinema located in the same mall this place would have more employees per day than customers and somebody would make better use of the land by turning back into a parking lot.  But it wouldn't matter to their staff as they spend 90% of their time standing around in groups so as to avoid any small interruption by a customer.  I strongly suggest that you limit your beverage choice to beer or wine as all of the alternatives are heavily watered down."
Jaime S.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,6,,2.0,11/9/2014,"Applebee's as a chain is alright... There's something for everyone, the Happy Hour is awesome, it's cheap, and they do have a few dishes I often find myself craving.  This particular Applebee's however, needs a lot of work. The service is SLOW.  I've been in there a few times over the last year and almost ever time I have been appalled by how painfully slow the service is.  (And I was a server for over 6 years so I am usually one to make excuses for slow service, knowing all the variables that can be the cause. ).  One time when I was in there we ordered. 2-for-20.  The way this works is that two people order one appetizer to share, and each order one entree, and share the $20 check.  (Amazing deal by the way!) usually the appetizer is quick and comes out within ten minutes and the entrees follow about 10-15 minutes after that.  On this particular night my boyfriend and I ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip for the app, he ordered a pasta dish with chicken, and I order the napa chicken dish (yum!).  Now, I know for a fact that the spinach and artichoke dip takes about 5 to 8 minutes to prepare (it's pre-portioned and microwaved/broiled once ordered.) When our dip didn't come after 15 minutes I figured ""ok maybe they had to defrost some frozen dip and fry some new tortilla chips."" (This at most would have taken 20 minutes.). We sat patiently and didn't even whine.  It was about 25 minutes before I finally had to call over our server and ask what the holdup was.  He said he wasn't sure and would check on it. (No apology.) A few minutes later he said ""the kitchen is working in it"" and walked away again. (Still no apology!) Ten more minutes pass (at this point it has been over 45 minutes since we ordered and not even our 5-minute app has arrived.) The server was about to take his 5th trip passed us without saying anything when I finally stopped him as said ""listen, even if our dip is still not ready, can you bring out entrees as soon as they are ready? We are pretty hungry.""  Sure enough he comes right out with our entrees! They were scorching hot and the sauce on my BF's pasta had started to harden.  The plates had clearly been sitting in the hot window for at least 15 minutes.  Finally I asked to talk with a manager.  The only excuse they had for the slow service was that ""all the cooks were on break.""  Sorry... But I've never heard of a restaurant that allows all of their line cooks to take their breaks at the same time in the middle of a dinner shift!  I didn't even put up a fight I was so over it.  Our dip came out eventually but there was literally no explanation for the wait other than the lack of cooks in the kitchen.  The manager didn't even offer to comp our app... Just offered a ""free"" desert Shooter (which only cost $3) Bad form Applebee's.   Anyway, the moral of the story is avoid this location if you can, and if you can't... Eat a snack before you come because you won't get fed quickly!"
