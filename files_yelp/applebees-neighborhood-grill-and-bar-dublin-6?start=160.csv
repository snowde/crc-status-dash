Roxana M.,"Newman, CA",0,40,,1.0,9/6/2013,"Place was empty at 330 pm on a Friday. Hostess was an older lady who was very low class. Our waitress was ok but food took a very long time to come! Place was being remodeled, all employees were just lounging at a table laughing out loud!  Very poor!!"
Zack B.,"San Ramon, CA",38,16,,1.0,5/12/2015,"My family and I wondered why the wait next door at Black Angus was over an hour and you could get right in at Applebee's with no wait.... its partially because the food is way worse but mostly because the service was awful. It always took so long to get the attention of the waitress who seemed irritated to even be there. I dont remember her name but she was in her 30s maybe early 40's, black hair pulled back in a ponytail. I cant speak for every server there but she needs to find a new gig. We got our food (ribs) and got the honey bbq ones. They were surprisingly spicy despite sounding like they would be sweet. After returning them for another item were explained that the rub used on all the ribs ""has some kick to it"". If this was the case it should be mentioned in the menu clearly. For arguments sake maybe we are just spicy food wimps and couldn't handle it. We certainly felt that way and felt even worse asking for another order but we simply couldn't eat it (we never like to be ""that guy""). The manager came out (a blonde girl) and she was nice. They almost got a save for this move despite the long wait for our food and lack of attention the whole time....Then I waited 30 mins between finishing my food and getting my check.... My dimwitted waitress up and disappeared and my 2 year old went berserk for 20 minutes. I'm surprised nobody helped us if for no other reason to get our screaming child out of the restaurant. I finally tracked down a random guy at the bar and handed him my credit card. Needless to say we wont be going back and will surely recommend elsewhere."
Brian B.,"Livermore, CA",588,1091,120,2.0,2/4/2009,"It sucks. All Applebees do but this one sucks extra hard. Even the faux local crap that they decorate with to pretend they're not the demon spawn of WalMart and Denny's is suckier than usual.  If George W Bush was a chain restaurant, he'd be an Applebees.  If Dick Cheney was an Applebees, he'd be this Applebees."
Ashwin S.,"San Jose, CA",121,32,8,1.0,2/16/2015,"Service is a real problem at this Applebee's. We went to the bar because there was a 20 min wait for our table. The Bartender Jorge did not look like he was in a good mood, didn't look like he was having the best day, we asked for an appetizer menu, he just threw the menu in front of us. we ordered some drinks and appetizer took a while for use to get them. someone in our party  accidentally knocked over a drink, and he was very annoyed that he had to clean it up. Finally our table was ready and we were seated, had to wait a good 10 mins until our waiter arrived, by far the most rude waiter I have experienced, we wanted to order another round of beers and there were still drinks that we carried over from the bar, so he asked us if he could see our ideas, we joked that we just got drinks at the bar, and he angrily told us ""well I didnt check your ideas here, so I need to see it"".  after that i knew this guy gonna be a pain, and then he took our orders and wanted to read the order back to us, he barked at us to quiet down so he could read it back to us. So unprofessional! The food came and it wasnt fantastic pasta was cold, steak was overcooked. Asking him to for more refills or Ranch or napkins, was such a task for him. Not sure if he should be in this industry. Finally our bill arrived after we asked for it about 6 times,  we wanted to split the check evenly with credit cards, when we told him he told us we made his job that much harder!  umm i'm sorry, maybe you shouldn't  be working here lol!  First and last time coming to this Applebee's should have read the reviews before we decided to come here yesterday! Hey Applebee's in Dublin get your shit together!"
Chris R.,"Honolulu, HI",19,1057,81,3.0,10/4/2013,"I like Applebees and this is a good location next to the theater.  However, the service is very slow here."
Zahara K.,"Tracy, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/3/2014,"Applebees is one of my favorite restaurants to eat at, but this Applebees is definitely not one that i would return to! Their customer service is horrible, waiter did not even explain the new favorites menu and we waited almost 15 minutes for our drinks order to be taken! On top of that, almost an hour wait for our food! Ridiculous! And what i really dont understand is that, the restaurant is not even busy! Where are all the servers?! Definitely never returning!"
Lerin B.,"Modesto, CA",14,1,,2.0,8/30/2013,"This particular Applebee's is not one we plan on returning to.  Our service was good, but our food was not.  The appetizer, buffalo wings, were cold and just not what they should have been.  The main course was also cold, each plate came out at the same time.  It wasn't super busy and we're not picky people.  Maybe there were circumstances in the back we were unaware of, but I know we won't be going back there any time soon."
Colton M.,"San Ramon, CA",58,5,,1.0,5/7/2013,This place f*******n sucks never coming here again manager is sitting talking to other customers and waiter is sitting at bar doing nothing never come here
Jeannie W.,"San Ramon, CA",8,73,165,1.0,11/28/2012,So right after leaving chilis without getting seated we drive by this place. Yay! We get seated right away but 20 minutes to get our wrong drinks another 30minutes to get our food. Thats the only patience we have. We left leaving a 20$ bill in the table (which i strongly regret) and hungry... maybe i am not just having my night... in n out we go ..
Abhishek P.,"Dublin, CA",2,17,,1.0,10/2/2012,My steak was somewhere between a black block and a chewing gum and tasteless.. The veggies were over boiled so they were softer than my mashed potatoes. Hated my food here and i am not going back here again
Cecilia T.,"Modesto, CA",38,43,,1.0,12/28/2014,"This was the worst Applebee's I have ever been to. I travel all around and have been to different Applebee's. The service here was the worst of all. We waited to have a take out order. And then the waiter that approached asked someone else to help us because he was almost off then that waiter said he was off and sent us to the bar. We then waited there for bartender to take our order. We told him not to heat up the dessert we were getting, he said better for him, it's quicker that way. As we waited for our to go, we saw people waiting to be seated  as we saw waiters standing in corner talking. We left no tip and even though it was to go, we always leave a tip. The customer service was awful. Will not be back here and don't recommend."
Captain E.,"Livermore, CA",8,46,3,2.0,12/13/2013,"Poorly cooked food...asked for burger done medium and ended up pink all the way through. Makes me wonder about food safety at this restraunt. Seats in booth were both worn out and torn.  Only gets two stars because wife's oriental salad ""tasted great""."
Lenore L.,"Pleasanton, CA",43,247,17,4.0,6/6/2011,If it's good enough for Ricky Bobby it's good enough for me! Love their oriental chicken salad and boneless buffalo wings
squishy b.,"San Ramon, CA",61,154,62,1.0,4/2/2010,"I went here after catching Avatar in 3D around 10 pm. It was the only place open and I had never been here so I though, why not? We were seated quickly and given the menu. I ordered the mini-hamburgers because I love anything mini and hamburgers. My friend got some pasta dish and a raspberry iced tea.  I liked the decor and our waiter was a nice guy. We noticed the 3 item bit on the menu after ordering and tried to flag our waiter down to change out order. He told us we were too late and he had already sent our order in. No biggie.  Our food came out quickly but man oh man was I disappointed. I ate two burgers and couldn't bear to leave the leftovers. Thinking my dog might like an unhealthy human snack I took it home. Neither of my dogs touched it. And in a few hours I knew why. Disgusting. Disgusting. Disgusting. This is the reason why I dislike chain restaurants! Poor quality food for a higher price."
Gabi M.,"Dublin, CA",36,261,51,3.0,6/8/2011,"for some reason my son wanted to come here for his bday dinner...so we brought the extended fam (8) here; I was not looking forward to this as I tend to avoid these chain places. But there I was. It was actually better than I expected, tho my sis-in-law told me about how they had recently messed up her order there before.  It's what you'd expect from a apple-chili-iFridays, but I have commend the staff as we got good service, instant drink refills, and lots of napkins, etc. Got the apps-sampler, and all was decent, I had the shrimp cajun pasta and that was pretty good; I even made sure they wouldn't use soy or corn oil on my oder & the manager brought out the list of ingredients! well done. Again, not my fav food, but I would go there for some apps & drinks or dessert (which we were too full for)."
Joe M.,"San Francisco, CA",3,37,2,4.0,6/19/2011,"Not too crowded at the time I went. (which helped perhaps) Good pasta dish (a little heavy on the pepper) and O-ring side. Friendly and knowledgeable waitress. Fast service...families everywhere but you expect that in a family restaurant, right? There are TVs in the bar area."
Wil G.,"Hayward, CA",98,308,95,3.0,3/26/2013,"I came here to check out their happy hour, starts at 9, I had some $4 wine (6 0z serving) and the wine selection was enormous *NOT* for happy hour you have two choices one white and one red, the appetizers were good at 4 bucks each as well. It was cool, nothing spectacular and nothing horrible I would still prefer Fridays over this place at least you'll have sports to watch.  Back in day when it wasn't a franchise type business Applebee's rocked! now its just A-OK"
Bernadette H.,"Fresno, CA",45,15,10,2.0,11/15/2012,"Unfortunately our server ""supposedly"" had his 1st day on the job the night we came in. We had a party of 11 & everything came late. Drinks late, appetizers were cold, & one of us in the group got his entree after EVERYONE was already done eating. Other than that, staff was friendly & food was fair."
Nick J.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/5/2014,"Where to start?  My wife and I waited 30 minutes and no service.  We told three different people that our order wasnt taken, but nothing was done.  I normally like Applebees, but this location is horrendous."
Mrs D.,"San Francisco, CA",1,37,7,5.0,6/27/2013,Just wanted to say thank you to Rakia and Andres for such GREAT service! Many thanks! Food was great too and fast! We will come again!
