Michele M.,"Los Angeles, CA",236,158,134,1.0,1/25/2010,"WOW, here I am ready to rant and rave about Applebee's super sucking and it looks as tho I'm not the only one.... GOOD I don't normally yelp a chain like Applebee's unless I have an extreme experience. In this case... EXTREMELY BAD. We were sat and the waitress promptly came over. She took our order (which she WROTE down) and our substitutions... sandwich sub tomato bisque soup instead of fries and french dip sliders sub chedder cheese instead of swiss. (Easy right?) To preface this, we were STARVING! Food comes out - my sand/soup, perfect. His french dip sliders, they have swiss cheese on them. He sends them back asking very nicely to have them put chedder like he asked initially. She does the whole ""OH NO, MY FAULT"" and takes them back. He waits, I rudely start eating. After (too much) time the sliders come back with chedder. Chedder looks BARELY melted. Fries - COLD. He picks up the slider... soggy bottom bun, but scalding f'n hot! WTF is going on here?? Sends back again and reorders a cheeseburger instead.  Now, one would think the manager would come over, or the waitress would bring some hot fries out to snack on since a burger will take awhile... nope nothing. The sliders were removed from our bill but still... Really the ONLY thing that I enjoyed is the fact they sell unrestricted movie tickets for only $7.50 when you were buying a meal. :-/ wooo hoo"
Lisa R.,"San Ramon, CA",0,5,,4.0,12/7/2014,I had the steak on the two for $20 menu. The food was good and the steak was cooked to order (med rear).  The waitress seemed a bit stressed (maybe because of the holidays).  Had the waitress been a bit more friendly and didn't make exasperated faces when she thought we weren't looking I would have given this place 5 stars.
Laurie S.,"Castro Valley, CA",116,277,2,3.0,12/8/2010,"This is the first time I'd been to this Applebees.....I always forget it's here, it's so far back from everything else in this strip mall. It was pretty quiet, since we got there for an early lunch, but didn't seem to pick up much while we were there. We were seated right away and the restaurant was very clean. Our server was mediocre. She was really nice, but slow like she had a gazzillion tables to serve.....and she didn't. I'm not sure she had any other tables besides ours....but it's possible.  It seemed like only about 20 tables were filled and we all had different servers. Food was standard and good! I usually don't comment on the bathroom situation, but I have to say this restroom was very clean! I was even impressed that the diaper changing table had the paper covers for it! Woot! LOL!"
Jessie L.,"San Francisco, CA",231,758,1096,2.0,7/3/2012,"had their signature sirloin (with shrimp), cooked medium rare. meat was really tough.. hard to cut and chew. my friend's bourbon steak was better cooked though. we also ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, which the waitress forgot about. but those were decent."
Kelly M.,"San Francisco, CA",5,29,9,2.0,5/15/2012,"I just ate here for the first time on Sunday and it will definitely be my last time! I had the fiesta lime chicken, but they were out of the rice that went with it. There was nothing lime about the dish, instead it had a gross dressing like sauce under the cheese and it was cold when I got it. My niece's Salmon was way over cooked and they didn't bring it back to the table until the rest of us were ready for the check.  The waiter was friendly, but the food was nothing close to good."
Hib.zi R.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2,39,,1.0,4/5/2014,Horrible experience. Barely half filled restaurant yet service was very slow. The high chair for my little one was filthy dirty. Food was late. Never again. Area has many many nicer places.
Sami S.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,3,3,1.0,8/17/2015,"Although I have been coming to this applebees for years and it is ABSOLUTELY worthy of countless bad reviews with the food quality, but more so the absolute terrible service that is always given. And considering there are always terrible non time sufficient servers I blame that entirely on the training process. However, considering this is taking time out of my day I never write reviews...but the lack of concern, care or worry has lead me to this. Last night for my to go order I was served RAW meat. Absolutely un edible. When I called to complain the first manager was less than concerned and told me to call the next day since it was close to closing. So I did just that and again spoke with a manager that could care less about the quality of their food let alone the actual preparation process for it. The only defense she gave was that they were frozen... lol that is possibly the worst response given so heads up to you all for ALL applebees... they do not serve fresh products either, that was information straight from management. I am appauled. TERRIBLE SERVICE, TERRIBLE UN COOKED FOOD AND A TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT TEAM."
Michael L.,"Hayward, CA",0,20,,1.0,2/24/2012,"Bad service, waitresses with an attitude. Too bad , because I have been to other branches that were a lot better. Drinks are watered down. I do not think I will be going there again"
Alex P.,"Castro Valley, CA",63,37,,1.0,6/10/2012,"went in one night for the appetizer specials; food is mediocre, the service was terrible the lady working the bar was waiting on all the tables in the bar. One thing I cant stand is when the waitress thinks she can take an order without writing any thing down no wonder the sliders came out without the cheese. We have found that all the applebee's have really gone down hill in the last few years.    CHILI'S HERE WE COME!!!!!!"
Ryan H.,"Pleasanton, CA",38,3,,1.0,3/22/2014,"Horrible, only came to this place because we had a gift certificate. Gross burger. Will never eat here again"
Hen A.,"San Mateo, CA",3007,3154,4803,3.0,9/26/2011,deep east bay and south...dublin and choices limited...just passing by for drinks...early happy hour 'til seven pm (late night happy hour from ten pm to closing)...$four select appetizers and half-off beers...quick drinks and honey bbq wings before dinner and a movie...all good in dublin....
Chuck N.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,23,122,4.0,3/10/2014,"I've been here dozens of times and have never had any complaint about the service or the food. It's a fun colorful atmosphere. Lots of TVs in the bar area, which includes tables for lunch or dinner. It's a franchise restaurant, so I don't know what the complainers expect to see or get here. There have been large servings for everything I've ordered, which includes dozens of visits."
Jenelle G.,"Ripon, CA",26,14,,1.0,8/12/2013,"Took my 83 year old Grandfather and my daughter to dinner here last week. Boy, Did I ever regret it. I ordered a water with lemon to drink which I normally order everywhere. The water tasted like dirt. Both my Grandfather and I ordered salads and both of us ended up with food poisoning. My daughter had mac and cheese and an Oreo shake and was the only one that didn't get sick.  I can't remember ever being so sick to my stomach in my life. When I found out the next morning Grandpa was sick too I decided I needed to call and let Applebee's know how ill I was and was still feeling. The Shift Manager that I spoke to was nice and said that she would look into it and make sure GM knew as well. Not sure if she passed it on., She did also offer me a free meal next time. The last thing somebody that has been ill for the last day and a half from eating at your restaurant wants to do is eat there ever again. Overall the place was dirty, service was mediocre, and the food was decent tasting but toxic. I hope that by me calling them and posting this that it will keep other people from feeling as ill from food poisoning as me and my Grandpa did. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Instead I am sharing my experience to keep others from getting sick. I am sure we were not the only ones ill that had salad that night."
Anji R.,"Hayward, CA",12,45,5,4.0,6/27/2012,I have always liked applebees food... Only this one time i ordered something out of those weight watchers choices... Which totally sucked! Other than that i have never been dissapointed with the food. Good price with good food. They have great martinis too. Recommended. Friendly staff too
Paul V.,"Los Angeles, CA",117,262,5,2.0,1/6/2010,"Went here to watch the Oregon vs Ohio State game on the way back from San Francisco. And I really regret watching it here. First, they wouldn't switch the sound on for the game, despite having a sign in the front that says ""watch your favorite games here!"" I guess they must've literally meant ""watch"" and not hear the game. Our request to have the subtitle turned on was rejected as well. The service was OK. We came in at 2:53 PM, seven minutes short of happy hour. Yes, I understand that it's not 3 PM yet, but to say ""sorry, we can't put in your order until 3PM"" seems a bit ludicrous seeing as I've had this done at other restaurants before. The food was pretty standard affair from what Applebee usually offers. The same dryish buffalo wings, fries (can't mess up there...) and spinach dip with OK tortilla chips.  DO NOT TRY THE MANGO LEMONADE. In theory, it should be tasty, but it isn't. Kiwi and strawberry lemonade were pretty tasty though."
Bob S.,"San Francisco, CA",282,234,545,2.0,12/28/2011,"Yeah, cheap beer during happy hour other than that not much to say about Applebee's anywhere."
Penny M.,"Hayward, CA",3,4,,1.0,10/10/2013,This Applebee's is horrible :( it smells strange like old carpet or wood. And the service is kind of rude. Well not really rude just not as kind or nice as you will receive in Hayward. It's worth the couple extra mins drive to go to Hayward. I wouldn't come here again.
Vichar S.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,8,,3.0,12/17/2012,We waited for a long time before somebody showed up to seat us.  However after that it was not bad. We were in no rush so perhaps did not notice the long waits that other reviewers were bothered by. Good for a nice quite lunch.
John Z.,"Dublin, CA",171,309,53,2.0,4/11/2009,"I really wanted to like this place because of the great location, praise I've heard from friends, and because they have the Dublin sports hall of fame inside. However, while Applebee's has all of these things, they also have extremely high prices ($10 for an overgrown chicken slider? $4 for a Perrier?), modest food portions, so-so dishes, and the charm of chancre sore. I'd give this restaurant one star if it weren't for the friendly service and Dublin sports hall of fame."
Marcel L.,"Livermore, CA",1,7,,1.0,12/7/2013,"This place doesn't deserve any stars. First of all, they are not organized. For being empty...we had to wait about 15 minutes. They were bad mouthing each other because some of their co-workers didn't show up on time so they made us wait along with 7 different parties. Each party was like 4 to 5 deep. Like I said this place was empty. They sat us down and we ordered our food. Out of the 3 orders that I ordered for my 2 sons and myself, they screw up my 4 year olds food. I ordered him 2 cheeseburger sliders and they brought him chicken strips. They apologized and said they will bring his order. 10 minutes later....they brought 1 chicken burger. I told them to take it back and bring me what I ordered. Another 10 minutes later they brought my sons food but. There was no apology and I got 4 different servers telling me that they will fix my receipt. Did they? HELL NO THEY DIDNT I paid and I had to leave because their service fucken sucks. It's no wonder I stopped coming to this place 2 years ago. I just wanted to see if they got better....I was wrong."
