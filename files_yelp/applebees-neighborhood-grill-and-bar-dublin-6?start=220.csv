David A.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/19/2014,"If I could, I would put zero stars. I did not think service could get any worse than the Livermore location. Party of six, real easy order. Four salads, a burger and a kids burger. Simple enough? Food comes out one salad short. The waiter and host do not even pay attention that one salad is missing. A couple minutes go by before our waitress comes by to check and make sure we are okay. I tell her my salad is missing and she proceeds to tell me I'll fix it. After a half hour of waiting for my salad ( I saw personally three salads that I ordered go passed to other tables) and everyone else finishing their meals I still did not have mine. Me and my wife ordered waters to go with our drinks, took three times of asking to finally get one. We ordered a mango lemonade for my daughter (age six, this comes into play in a minute) and my wife. The waitress brought out mango iced tea to both my wife and daughter. More went wrong but I think this gives you an idea. Probably not typical but was just ridiculous. After hearing ""we just had a cook walk out"" and ""yes it should of been put to the front of the line but it didn't"" I got frustrated. All I asked for politely was to cancel my salad and give me the check. I did not need to hear any sob stories or what can we do to make this up? Graciously the manager comped the meal, but all I wanted was to leave. Moral of the story is, be prepared but might not happen to you."
Deb D.,"Pleasanton, CA",1,11,,1.0,11/7/2010,"Went for dinner on a Sunday night (11/07/2010). The hostess was terrible and clueless about good customer service: didn't greet, walked away without speaking when we asked for a booth, returned with a towel and asked us to follow her. We sat down after she did a once over to the table with the towel. She gave us menus and walked away without speaking (no enjoy your meal, nothing). The food tasted like frozen food microwaved (shoulda gone to Safeway for a frozen meal and saved $40). The waiter Chris was just okay, though he could learn how to say, ""You're welcome"" instead of ""Yip"" I left him a small tip only because he did say, ""Enjoy your meal."" I will never, ever, ever, ever, return to any Applebees. This was a lousy evening due to the bad service.  Last but not least hostess (dark frizzy hair pulled back) kept sniffing and using her hand to wipe her nose throughout our meal. I could see her clearing off something from other tables. Watching her grossed me out!"
J M.,"San Leandro, CA",85,26,1,1.0,12/11/2009,"Can I give it ZERO stars?  Let me start? Walked into this place at 12:05, sat down right away because it was not that busy. Ordered drinks. At 12:30, drinks are no where to be seen. We kinda stood up, look at the bar area giving them hints that we are waiting for too long for our drinks and food. After 5 more minutes, walked up to our server and told her that we were leaving cuz it was taking too long. All she said was ""OK"". Not even apologetic. Walked past the hostess and she said ""Thanks for coming"". We said we're leaving cuz it took too long. She said ""i'm sorry"" , smiled and walked away. We called in to complain a few minutes later. The person said there was no manager, but there was a supervisor. It turns out the supervisor is also the bartender. What a joke of a place!! She didn't even attempt to assist us when we were there. Once we called and told her that we wanted to make a formal complaint, she told us to come back and that she'll ""hook us up"". Too late. To the bartender/supervisor: You should have attempted to help us knowing that we were about to leave. Don't tell us that you are going to ""Hook us up"" after we told you that we were going to make a formal complaint."
Jean H.,"Brentwood, CA",6,252,,1.0,11/6/2011,EH!    The server was great!   the coffee was good!    But the food was very disappointing; i had a fried chicken salad . . pitiful and had bad hard boiled egg on it. Of course it would help to go with someone who isn't a grump too.
Steve J.,"Fort Leavenworth, KS",25,123,52,2.0,3/14/2008,"Not too impressed with this Applebee's.  Just came back from there with some co-workers for lunch.  I noticed that the other two reviews on this place was from a year and a half ago.  Not too much apparently has changed, unfortunately.   My co-workers and I arrived here and were seated promptly.  Our waitress was 'Jacque' and she told us this when we were seated.  There seemed to be some confusion on their part as to who our server was because we never saw Jacque again until I asked for the bill (granted their manager checked in w/us and asked how we were doing once).  Jacque later apologized for the wait and confessed there was a confusion as to who was to wait our table - her or her supervisor?!?   It took a long time for us to find our server to ask for the check and when we finally got it, I asked whether a military discount was applied to our check (since we were in uniform - and a lot of these places usually automatically apply the discount w/out us asking).  She said that she was new there and she will have to look into it.  That took another 15 minutes.   -  We were seated promptly.   -  Our orders were taken and we were served in a reasonable amount of time.   -  My co-workers ordered a Shrimp Parmesan Steak ($15.99) and a Chicken Fajita ($12.99).  No complaints good or bad from either of them.  Portions seemed small for my co-workers' steak served with mashed potatoes and vegetables.  The chicken fajita appeared to be good.  I had a Chicken Caesar Salad ($9.29) plus ice tea ($2.49).   The salad was plain (not bad, but boring) and nothing really to write home about.  The romaine lettuce was drenched in the caesar dressing, some croutons, plain strips of chicken and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese.  It appeared that everything was spread out to cover the entire oval plate it was served on."
Joe C.,"Dublin, CA",46,305,1,3.0,12/25/2010,"My wife, brother and I had a very decent meal here recently. I am glad I did not read the other posts before stopping in here - we just happened along this place after a frenzied bit of x-mas shopping. Maybe management read the many posts and changed things up because we had fast and friendly service and all meals were prepared just fine. Our waitress stopped by immediately after we were seated and took our drink orders then delivered them within 5 minutes. We all ordered basic comfort food - pasta with meatballs, small steak and I had one of their signature chicken dishes. My wife and I are on a health kick now so we appreciate the fact that they post calories and fat content next to each item on the menu so that we can make the right choice on what to eat."
Ken C.,"New York, NY",48,639,2,1.0,10/15/2009,Not the same Applebee that I know at the East coast... too familized.
Jennifer F.,"Livermore, CA",47,367,322,2.0,5/15/2006,"Recently, we ordered to go...  The riblets I ordered didn't taste right... On another recent visit, we sat at our table for about 10 minutes before anyone greeted us.  We waited another 20 minutes JUST to get water and our drinks from the bar.  As the waiter was bringing our drinks to us, our dinner came at the same time.  Pretty bad.  They weren't even THAT busy. The salad was good though.  The mudslide I ordered was a bit better than the one I had at the Milpitas branch...  But still not worth $6. I think I'm banning Applebee's for a while from our list of places to eat!"
Jessica L.,"El Cerrito, CA",737,909,29,3.0,3/18/2010,With weight watchers and 500 calorie meals highlighted on the menu as well as a diverse nutritional guide available - this place isnt half bad. It is expensive for the fact that they are reheating everything though -- service was very fast at lunch time.
Tetsu N.,"Dublin, CA",452,391,25,3.0,7/10/2008,"I'd give Applebee's more stars, but they do some funky stuff with food that I often think has too much taste contrast. Their steaks are all right.  They use the Viking series of Grills, but with a customized size and no closing top, I think.  Can't remember, but I also think they added the infrared heaters for searing.  But I think the searing grill doesn't exceed 1200 degrees because I don't see the hard sear on any of the steaks, which sort of bums me out.  But they're not bad. I do like their steak and shrimp with cheese sauce combo.  I could never get that sauce right, so it's a real treat to be able to eat that dish. Where I have trouble is the salads.  The salads have just way too much taste contrast, and while that can work really well, it's a gamble.  When I read the ingredients on the menu, I think, huh, that's creative and sounds like it could be really good.  But then, when the food comes, it's just too strong a series of tastes and they don't go well together for my taste.  Some folks may like it. The desserts are my other problem.  They taste okay, though way too sweet most of the time.  But you can easily soften the taste with some tea or coffee.  The bigger problem for me is the sheer volume.  C'mooooon.  After a soup or salad, a steak with way too much fries or mashed potatoes, having a dessert like the ones they serve is clearly too much.   They have health foods, and carb light foods, but those don't sound too attractive when you're at a steak house, and it still doesn't resolve the dessert issue. What I'd really like to see are simple salads with just a touch of creativity but not overbearing, a good steak and some simple and low volume side dishes, and desserts that are reasonably sized. Yes yes, I can always leave the food.  But where i come from, you eat what you're served, and that habit is hard to break.  Besides, if you pay for it, you don't want it to go to waste.   Oh well, guess you can't have everything."
Jenn A.,"San Francisco, CA",79,194,,3.0,6/17/2008,"When I was growing up family road trips would be driving around visiting family members in different states, hitting the Presidential libraries along the way, and staying at Howard Johnson's.  Guaranteed food on the trip would be the cold pot of rice packed along with the cold pot of chicken adobo and having it in the back of the station wagon.   On occasion we would splurge and hit the ""fancy"" restaurants like Sizzlers.  I imagine if Applebee's was around in the 70's this would have been one of the ""fancy"" restaurants my dad would have taken us. Father's Day 2008.  Dad wants to go to Applebee's.  Black Angus was a close second but mom and dad wanted 'variety.' Service - fine, waitress was busy cause of the lunch rush but was attentive and checked in with us enough times that it wasn't irritating nor were we going, ""where the hell is she!"" Food -  Dad - bourbon steak - not so good, weird flavoring on the steak, he said it tasted like there were too many leaves on it and reminded him of Indian food.  Not what he wanted to taste while eating steak.   Mom - walnut salad - she loves this salad, especially cause they coat the walnuts with crack - actually toasted with sugar Sis - chicken lime salad - basically take a package of spinach you buy at the store, open it up, dump the entire contents on your plate, throw some carrots on and then layer on the chicken.  It was salad, nothing special. Me - Applebee riblets - bring on the meat!  Good, tender, and tasty, drowning in the secret sauce (c'mon isn't it just KC Masterpiece?)  Apparently for only an extra 50cents you could get unlimited riblets!  My mom said, I should have gotten it so we could take some home (she says as she swipes a couple packets of Sweet and Low and sticks 'em in her purse).  I abstained but managed to dole out a large portion of the meats to everyone in the family, especially to dad who was not feeling his steak.   Desert shooters - 1.99 deals served in a large shot glass type of container.  Chocolate mousse and the strawberry cheesecake was just enough to satiate the sweet teeth we had after our meal.   It's just like any other Applebee's and if this is how your suburban famiy rolls or used to roll, I think you'll do all right at this place."
Kristina W.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,20,3,1.0,3/8/2013,"It took forever for us (spouse, son + myself) to be asked for our drink order once we were seated, They were not that busy but the wait staff was busy talking. we have never been to this Applebee's or for that fact any in CA. Big disappointment. Our food was cold when it came to the table. My spouse and son ate their food, but I asked that my food be reheated. The waitress came back to the table and asked if I wanted it remade and my reply was ""we waited 45 minutes for our food to come out, if you remake it my family will be done with their food and I will just be getting mine...just please reheat it for me."" The was no apology before or after my comment. Sad customer service."
Sherilyn P.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/4/2013,"Went to Applebees last night, you have got to be kidding, right!!!!!  Theresa was the WORST waitress EVER.  Had to have someone else take our order because she was tooooo busy socializing with her friends at one of the tables.  We ordered appetizers and soup besides our dinner well, it all came at once, and the order was wrong!!!  Theresa was not professional AT ALL.  She needs a reality check about being a server.  I would advise you remove her from your place of employment.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE BECAUSE OF HER...  AND THE FOOD WAS GROSS-"
JD R.,"Pleasanton, CA",1,48,4,5.0,9/20/2012,"The food is just alright, but I'm giving this 5 stars for our server Jamie.  She was so friendly , knew the menu well and just gave excellent service.  Always had a smile on her face.  I will call ahead next time going there to make sure she is there."
Mark G.,"Fremont, CA",237,85,3,2.0,2/16/2009,"it is what it is....  Met a friend out that way and i was a little early..  they ask for how many i said 2 but my friend wasn't there yet so they made me wait.  Got the table and got a cup of coffee.  Got some pasta waited for the bread no bread OK...  So i asked and he said oh yeah, didn't offer refill on coffee...  Pasta was alright for what it was and friends steak came well done instead of medium.... Will try the other places around the next time we hook up..."
Jimmy H.,"Dublin, CA",29,47,85,2.0,4/11/2009,"We had a $25 gift card to use, so we decided to come here for lunch today, especially since we've never been to one.  I like the fact that they have healthful offerings on their menus and highlight them by listing their ""Weight Watcher"" points.  We both ordered the Italian Chicken & Portobello Sandwich and were disappointed by how small the sandwiches were.  I've never seen a $10 sandwich that small.  On top of the inadequate portion size, they forgot to put in the marinara sauce.  If it weren't for the excellent server who was both attentive and efficient, I would have given Applebee's one star.  First time, last time."
Gabriel B.,"San Francisco, CA",91,411,12,1.0,5/29/2009,"Good value, lots of food options, nice bar. Don't  do it unless you're curios or have low standards."
Andrew Y.,"San Francisco, CA",179,1352,,3.0,6/25/2006,"This location is in the back lot of near the Hacienda theatre. It is so windy over there. I hate it! Inside, a typical Applebees. There's a lot of local sports team news and other stories placed on the wall.  The beverages were good, but usually slow to come out."
JinAlbert L.,"Dublin, CA",0,23,,1.0,4/16/2009,"It would have been nice to have a good, easy place to pick up a quick dinner when we don't want to cook, but it's not going to be Applebee's.  We sat down for lunch about 1:00pm, put in our order.  45 minutes later, we had nothing on our table.  It took 25 minutes before we got drinks.  People need to train your staff better."
Chris G.,"Concord, CA",474,562,367,3.0,1/11/2010,"Went here to burn some time while waiting for to see Avatar in IMAX 3D. Our server was pretty quick and smiling, but bar layout for tvs was just soso. They have  tv in each corner which is fine if you are positioned that way, but for the most part you just have to turn in some direction frequently to get updates. The food was ok and the mudslide was pretty strong.  For a quick bite it was fine and the $2 domestic draft on Sundays didn't hurt either."
