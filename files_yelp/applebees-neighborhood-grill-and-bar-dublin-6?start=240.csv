Kelly W.,"Dublin, CA",124,8,,1.0,5/21/2011,"One of the worst dining experiences we have had. We walked in just expecting to order appetizers. We were told that to get the happy hour prices, you can only sit in the bar and that the bar is full. We could either wait, or sit in the restaurant but would not be able to get the happy hour prices.  We said that since the bar is full, we should be allowed to sit outside the bar but still get the prices. They said they couldn't do that. I work in the service industry, and if people are willing to spend money at your establishment, you should be treating them as if they are appreciated. And not just cause the economy sucks. So after about ten minutes of waiting, another waiter asks if we have been helped. We told him why we were waiting, he said he would go talk to a manager. He returned a few minutes later and said we could sit in the restaurant. He took our drink order (without writing it down) and literally 10 seconds later, repeated it back wrong. I corrected him. He brought out my partners drink and finally mine a few minutes later. Took our dinner order (again, without writing anything down), and then repeated it back wrong. We corrected him again by repeating the entire order back to him correctly. When our order arrived, we saw that instead of the boneless wings with southern BBQ, we got boneless wings with buffalo sauce. We brought this to his attention and with an exasperated voice he said ""sorry, that'll be another five minutes."" He brings out the new boneless wings about 5 minutes later. As we were eating them, we noticed that they were wrong again. We had received the regular BBQ instead of southern BBQ. Rather than complain again and have to wait even longer, we just ate them. If you cannot remember a fairly simple order, you should be writing it down. And to bring out the wrong order and give an unconvincing apology doesn't fly. Our last time at this applebees was just ok, so needless to say, we won't be coming back to this one. We will either find another applebees to go to that has better service, or we will simply forget about going there anymore."
Sammy T.,"Dublin, CA",107,9,,2.0,6/13/2010,"Not worth the price.  If I'm spending $14 on a steak, I'd like it to taste less like processed sausage and more like a lean, pure cut of beef.  The good thing about Applebee's is that it's consistent, even if consistently average.  Much to the nature of TGI Fridays, Applebee's is good if you want appetizers and perhaps some drinks.  For dinner or lunch, however, it's a bit like overpriced cafeteria food."
Leo S.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,104,2,1.0,1/8/2011,"I love Applebee's but this location is bad. On several occasions, meals are often being served in dirty dishes. The wait time from the time you being sit until meal arrives is about an hour. Meals often comes cold and uncooked. This is the last time I visited this place. Not recommending to anyone."
Vivian M.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,7,,2.0,6/6/2011,"Visited Applebee's in Dublin, CA for a quick , no big deal meal.  The restaurant was not at all crowded.  We were one of two tables with people and this was at 5:00 PM. We ordered our drinks, dinner and I regret not getting the name of the waitress or manager but nevertheless continued on with our dining experience.  We ordered the $20. dinner thing and added salad the order.  The waitress brought out the salad before the appetizer and we told her we needed the appetizer first and I quote her, ""oh, you want the appetizer first????""   She takes back the salads and brings the appetizer....maybe five minutes later (if that) she brings the salads again and says, ""I don't want to rush you but I need to bring these salads as your entree is ready.""  I ask to speak to a manager by this time we not only were rushed but annoyed.  This seemingly very young man came and it would be hard to imagine him being a manager but he stated that he was.  We told him our experience and I could not believe his response. He told us that we were in a ""casual dining experience"" and they could serve the meal in whatever courses they choose.  That there was no set order to how the courses should come out.   I could not even believe what I was hearing and I informed him that ""clearly, we are at the wrong restaurant"" and we left.  I thought about this for several days and told countless people of it.  We even left there and went to a different restaurant and ask the waitress there if she had ever heard of any such procedure.  No one has been able to believe that was our experience.  We enjoyed Applebee's in the past but we would not return there after this experience.  Overall, it is a problem when a restaurant rushes the courses which seems to be a common problem but to defend it in such a manner was unreal.   I have learned to order my meal in single courses as they don't seem to get it.  No one goes to a restaurant to be rushed and have cold food because there is no timing on the part of the cook.  Once the order goes in you better get to chomping because the food is going to be cold by the time you let it sit there on the table because you haven't even finished the salad yet.  I would never order appetizer in conjunction with a salad and entree again.  We are seasoned in restaurant experiences and this was the most unreal we have had in many years.  Would not go there again, ever!!!"
Alexis F.,"Brentwood, CA",124,25,3,1.0,11/5/2008,"HORRIBLE service. When we got to the door we JOKINGLY asked to be seated with a good server, and the woman was like, ""well, we only have 3 right now,"" which was basically implying that we were going to get bad service either way. The waitress ignored us, then complained to us that we were drinking too much soda and it kept making her have to come back. Ordered the Grilled Cheese BLT which is really good, but my mother's had an inch of bacon on it. Seriously, only an inch. My boyfriend felt sick after eating his quesidilla burger. I will never go back."
Phoebe B.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/29/2011,"What an unpleasant experience. I had to send my spinach salad with grilled prawns back because the prawns were practically raw. The second time I got them back they were still translucent. Yuk! I didn't want to wait for another meal because they had failed twice, the service was VERY slow and my friend was already finished. The manager told me I didn't have to pay for my salad. Gee, wasn't that great PR. He also told me one of their best cooks was cooking tonight. Really? He not only acted like their was something wrong with me for not trying a third time but after I told him they had ruined my meal and evening he followed us all the way out and kept saying ""hope you have a good evening."" I definitely think Applebees in Dublin needs more experienced cooks and a new manager. The whole experience was really awful."
S J.,"San Ramon, CA",1,99,15,2.0,1/25/2012,The one in Union City is way better.  The service at this Dublin location is not up to par.  Waitresses aren't on top of things and the food takes forever.
Mia D.,"San Francisco, CA",2,82,,2.0,6/26/2008,"We had lunch here a few weeks ago. Everything on the appetizer platter was really salty. The California shrimp salad was not too bad. However, I should have asked for less dressing because that's all I could taste. The service was decent, but the waitress was not too detail-oriented. I asked for a half-size salad and my husband requested extra tomatoes in his pasta. I got a full-size salad and there was no tomato in his pasta."
Rupert Y.,"Dublin, CA",1,140,,1.0,6/9/2009,Made the mistake of going to Applebee's twice.  Food just doesn't compare to Chili's or Friday's in my opinion.
Jags S.,"Oakland, CA",0,10,,3.0,7/5/2010,the food was alright salad was not  fresh service was good.
Candida M.,"Livermore, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/27/2009,I had a gift card that I needed to use and went there late one night for a salad and soup.  The soup tasted like it came from a package and the side salad I ordered had bacon on it. I didn't ask for bacon....it was disgusting!!  Who would think you could ruin a soup and salad!!!
