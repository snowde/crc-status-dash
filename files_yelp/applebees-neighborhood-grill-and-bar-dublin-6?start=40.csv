David H.,"San Bruno, CA",1,7,10,1.0,3/30/2017,"There's a reason why they have bad Yelp's first of all management is terrible amd isn't customer centered, secondly they have very poor service this is my last stop at this location."
Lauren S.,"Tracy, CA",0,2,1,1.0,4/6/2017,"This restaurant used to be pretty good. Mercedes behind the bar is our favorite. I'm giving this place a one star cause the MANAGER ROLLED HER EYES at me when I told her the plate she was dropping off was wrong! I've worked in the restaurant industry for ten years and that to me is just unacceptable! No apology or anything! I've asked around, I think her name is Susanne. She's short, with long blonde hair and wears it down btw. Tie that sh*t up."
Mathew H.,"San Ramon, CA",9,21,4,3.0,12/11/2016,Had their triple chocolate meltdown. It was just so delicious that I can't describe! The only thing I didn't like was their customer service. They didn't give us any napkins and water. Otherwise it was a good place for desert!
Dan S.,"Dublin, CA",102,146,7,3.0,8/8/2016,"Clean and friendly service.  Familiar with the food from other locations.  Nothing stood out but nothing really to complain about either...consistent.  Was not too busy so sat right away, which I appreciate.  Service was attentive and prompt and burgers and salads came out as they should.  Kids ordered a sampler plate, which they could not finish, but it was all greasy and yummy.  We like it!"
mengzi w.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,267,68,3.0,10/17/2016,"San Ramon Applebee's was the best one we've been to and the first one, and they had to be closed down, too bad the chef didn't come to work at this one for sure. Steaks - OK, still 3 stars but they took 8oz off even the $25 menu and now those two menus seem not that attractive. I take back what I said about Black Angus steak is only as good as Applebees now, that only compares to the San Ramon location. Chicken finger/boneless wings - my goodness, McDonalds nuggets are way better than this (McDy has good nuggets mind you), there is barely any chicken in the ""chicken"" finger/wings, really? 1 star.  Essentially bar food now, the draft beer was still quite good, but overall pretty disappointed after visiting several Applebees."
Mark N.,"Dublin, CA",0,63,19,1.0,5/7/2016,"It smelled funny when we walked in and since there's no check in area we found a sweaty busboy who pointed at a table and we took it. This was at dinner time on a Friday evening and there sure weren't enough servers around because our guy that came to us was taking care of 7 groups that apparently sat at the same time. The wonton tacos were good and we should've stopped there, everything else was just a tick below ok. Oh watch out for the little game thingy on the table, as soon as you touch it it adds $2 to your bill even if you don't do anything with it. I'm sure someone will end up suing at some point because you can hear throughout the restaurant people saying they got charged for touching it. To conclude, we should've waited the 45 minutes for a table at Black Angus."
J T.,"Dublin, CA",1,49,,2.0,1/30/2016,Ate at the Dublin location for dinner.  The food was ok. But.  The service needs training for customer listening and managing tables.   First issue was we asked for a seat not in the bar area because we have young kids so of course they seat us next to the bar.  A booth was available but was reserved. Then we see them seat a couple that had come in 10 mins after us.  I guess buddies of theirs.   Second the waitress disappears and we have to flag someone to get her to come back just so we can get drinks or even the bill.   The bill was even wrong charging us for an adult dessert when we ordered the kids sundae.   Don't think I'll be going back as there are better places to go to around the area that provide better customer service like the nearby Black angus or red robins.
Adriana L.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,18,3,1.0,10/9/2016,The worst food ever. The hamburgers has not flavor . The Cesar salad I ordered was miserable. I never came back.
Kathryn D.,"San Ramon, CA",13,13,,4.0,4/28/2017,"Enjoyed dinner last evening with friends; our waitress Tina was awesome, she was polite, she was professional and knowledgeable of the menu.  When we received our meal I felt that my steak was a little too rare, without question, without attitude she immediately took it back to the kitchen.  What I was really impressed with was within a few minutes of getting my steak returned the manager was at our table to see that all was favorable.  We love Applebee's!!!"
Duduaneane B.,"Honolulu, HI",37,5,9,2.0,9/5/2016,"Slow service, orders didn't come out all together, friends salmon was dry, another friends porkchop was dry, just an overall fail.."
Gregg N.,"Tracy, CA",123,26,59,2.0,8/26/2016,It seems as if the food quality at Applebee's overall is going down. There's less chips and dip with the Spinach & Artichoke Dip appetizer. The kids grilled cheese sandwiches could use more grill time. The cheese wasn't melted at all.
Abe G.,"Arden-Arcade, Sacramento, CA",2,43,13,2.0,9/3/2016,"The beer was cold that was number one. The bartender was just going through the motions. Nothing spectacular no conversation no small talk. Not friendly or unfriendly, just there. The music is horrible techno-pop for fourteen year old girls."
Lisa W.,"San Diego, CA",0,57,6,1.0,9/3/2016,"Riddled with ants on the tables, asked to be moved and the next table had ants too. Mentioned it to a staff member that was very flippant and said yes they are all over all tables!!!  Avoid this place"
William X.,"Fremont, CA",0,8,8,3.0,7/4/2015,"""+"" Clean tables everywhere. Food comes fast. Neat little touchscreen console on every table. Prices are decent. Waiters were nice and wanted to interact with their customers. ""-"" Food is extremely salty.. I ordered a Thai shrimp salad and it was so salty I had to refill my drink 3 times to make it half way. Waited 2 minutes before a waiter came to seat us down."
Jay T.,"Santa Clara, CA",56,113,2,2.0,11/16/2015,Yea Before i went in there i shouldve checked yelp  Because this place sucks my food was okay the worst drinks ever i ordered a henny and pepsi it was all pepsi I ordered long island it was all tea no liquor service was slow one bar tender working for the whole restaurant host in the front kept muggin at either me or my friend this place was not even busy worst place ever save ya time
April K.,"San Jose, CA",422,16,2,5.0,6/6/2016,"Mercedes is the sweetest! I came in for happy hour and made a joke to my brother about eating his celery (from his wings), which he declined. She must've overheard and brought out some celery for me! A little hospitality and good attitude goes a long way in my book! Thank you for your service and keep up the good work!"
Bevedine C.,"San Ramon, CA",68,14,12,5.0,8/8/2016,"Excellent service.  Jesse was our server, very prompt, friendly and pleasant.  Food was great. Thank you Jesse"
Rolando M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,5,,5.0,8/28/2016,I take my family there regularly with always been happy with the service the food is outstanding can't wait to get back there very reasonable price
Ryan A.,"Hayward, CA",2,51,,1.0,1/8/2017,Still terrible. We gave this place another shot and we got bacon on our mash which was not on the description and broccoli instead of macn cheese. This place is terrible.
Samantga G.,"San Leandro, CA",0,8,22,2.0,7/27/2016,Very bad service. Only 2 waiters in the restaurant and one of them was going back and forth between bar and floor. My food was cold due to understaff. Won't be coming here again.
