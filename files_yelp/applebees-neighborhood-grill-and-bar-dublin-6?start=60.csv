Olivia M.,"San Ramon, CA",97,132,280,4.0,4/28/2016,"I came here with my family on a Saturday night around 6:00pm, before our 7:30pm movie at the IMAX theater. We were seated at a booth right away and our waitress came by to take our drink orders. She was friendly and patient to make sure she got our orders correct. She gave us enough time to pick out our dinner options from the menu and when my mom and I picked out two dishes that were also on the 2 for $20 menu (that we were not aware of), she told us about that option and how we could order an appetizer along with it. We went with that and got the rest of our table's orders in too. The restaurant was picking up, so we waited a little bit longer than expected for our food to arrive, but it came out hot and perfect to how we ordered it. When we finished and realized we were in a bit of a rush to make our movie, we had to flag down our waitress after a few attempts and then headed out after paying. I had a good experience even though it was a busy Saturday night. I've grown up eating at different Applebee's in the Bay Area and still enjoy eating out there on occasion. :)"
Zuly G.,"Hayward, CA",15,3,,1.0,6/26/2016,This probably the worst place to eat in Dublin. Awful service and 1 hour later the food never came and my peach ice tea took 45 min.  Awful!!!!
Harmilan C.,"San Ramon, CA",17,11,25,1.0,12/5/2016,I went to try their desert with my friends. I asked the waitress if she could serve us water. Guest what? She rolled her eyes. How rude is that! She really needs to get over her attitude.disappointing!!!! I have never person working like that!!!
Amy W.,"Livermore, CA",55,2,,1.0,7/25/2016,Our waiter was very absent. He never came to check on us or bring us pur dips and plate for our appetizers. Didn't refill our drinks. Out of 3 waiters and one hostess with a nearly empty restaurant... No one checked on us. Only time we saw our waiter was when we received our food and ordered. Do not recommend this to any one. Worst service I've had in years.
Alfonso C.,"San Leandro, CA",36,13,3,1.0,5/22/2016,"This place is terrible. The service is slow and foul mouthed.  The waiter was slow, in more ways than one!  And, he only had one table.  The hostess called her co-worker a fuc#er in front of my 5 year old!!!   The hostess   complained to her co-workers during my entire visit about having to smile.  This place is a joke, but I'm not laughing. The ""waiter"" forgot the salad dressing.  He forgot the extra napkins.  He only had one table and couldn't bring the food out without help.  and, it was all cold.  We had to ask for refills, apparently one has to ask for each refill separately because the first refill wasn't enough of a hint."
Rachel N.,"San Lorenzo, CA",360,228,188,2.0,2/5/2015,"Serious service issues; they don't see you when you walk in and forget about you once you're seated. Even with the tablets providing a button to call your server you get no response.  Wait time for food was much longer than expected, food was just ok. Seemed chilly, as if it had been sitting waiting to be picked up. Mozzarella sticks were great, mashed potatoes were cold and hard, steaks are ridiculously small and all fat, upsetting. I don't know what was up but I'll avoid next time."
Janette P.,"Hercules, CA",64,13,12,5.0,6/10/2016,"Always a pleasant experience when we go! Very easy to get my elderly grandpa in and he always loves their margaritas and the brownie bites for less than $2 :) foods pretty decent, haven't had a bad meal there. Great service as well!"
Carol D.,"Escalon, CA",15,18,,5.0,11/19/2016,"After a long day at the Dickens Faire, we stopped in Pleasanton for dinner. Applebee's had no wait time so we went there. I had no expectations; we were all just tired and hungry. There were seven of us, including my 3 grandchildren.  The service there was so pleasant, positive, welcoming and non-judgmental that I cannot thank them enough.  Children were welcomed. The food was delicious (I had the grilled pork chop and bacon and cheddar friend potatoes with steamed broccoli).  The broccoli didn't sound good but it certainly was delicious!  We were so tired, especially the children, and it was just the pick me up we needed to make it home (one more hour).  Thank you Applebee's Pleasanton.  Your kindness and delicious food are much appreciated!!!!!"
Christine L.,"Danville, CA",46,2,,3.0,11/16/2015,Everything is what I expect at Applebee's however out 4 servers only one knows how to smile...it is like they don't want to be here...even hostess...so sad! I miss San Ramon!
Molly M.,"Livermore, CA",156,314,69,2.0,12/30/2014,"What can I say? It's Applebee's. This establishment has been around for years, but not nearly as long as the one in Livermore. This one is quite a bit newer than it's neighboring locations, and I think the service is also better as well. But that doesn't say much in comparison to Livermore. Our waitress actually forgot about us for a good 20 minutes. We didn't really mind because it gave us time to talk, but for those of you who are hungry and ready to eat, you might not want to sit in the bar area. Normally I don't come to corporate chain restaurants like these, but my friend and I were looking for a place with decent dessert at a relatively good price. We ordered the simple blondie brownie with ice cream. Not bad, but not great. We didn't eat it all, and just ended up talking there for hours lol. At least the seats are comfortable!"
Sandra R.,"Frisco, TX",8,14,,1.0,5/22/2017,"Went to Applebees for a late lunch on Saturday, probably around 2:00.  We were promptly seated and given menus.  At that point, we apparently became invisible.  The place was not crowded at all, and there were two waitresses it seemed like assigned to our area.  Both made a concentrated attempt to ignore us.  One bussed the booth in front of us, the other walked by our table at least 3 times without looking at us.  We had made our selections and put our menu aside so they would know we were ready, but no one offered to take a drink order, or our regular orders. When one walked by us close enough to touch and carefully averted her eyes so as not to make eye contact, we got up and left.  We are a fairly presentable older couple, and we tip well, but apparently we didn't look acceptable enough to serve. We sat there a good 15 minutes without even being acknowledged.  What has happened to Appkebees?"
Michelle M.,"San Jose, CA",2,167,5,1.0,2/16/2015,"Had a gift certificate, so we stopped for lunch on our way out of town. Food was predictable, but it took FOREVER."
Carrie Y.,"Fresno, CA",15,7,8,1.0,1/15/2016,"Worst service ever! Walked through the door, no greetings what so ever. Walked over to the bar, only a few customers and sat there for more than 5 minutes and not once did the two ladies ever looked at us or helped us. We left. Should've checked yelp! Don't go here people!! My dog greets me better lol"
Dre G.,"Tracy, CA",131,1,,5.0,4/26/2016,"While waiting for the 5 O'clock Traffic to die down, I come here on the daily for a Beer or 2.. The service is always good, I can't complain."
Jon B.,"Pleasanton, CA",37,19,3,1.0,5/1/2015,Called to order the 2 for 20 and you only have a few options. The lady said I could get one of the other burgers but then called back and said I couldn't. Pasta was way overcooked and the lime that came with the chicken was almost rotten. Instead of squeezing it and getting juice it just fell apart and no juice came out. I doubt I will be back and will not reffer and of my hotel patrons there. Very disappointing.
Cookie W.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/17/2016,"This is a yucky restaurant! Not worth your wait and money. We ordered steak which we said medium well, they got us well done, the 4 Mac and cheese was awful awful awful, no cheese at all, it's like smothered with honey and topped with a week old chicken tenders yayks!!! No Bueno!"
Imperial C.,"San Jose, CA",2,15,83,1.0,7/27/2014,"The only reason why I gave them one star was because my pregnant wife and I got a ""free"" meal out of it.  Let me begin when me and my PREGNANT wife drove all the way to pick up a baby crib to Costco from South San Jose because San Jose ran out and the only one available was on the Tri-Valley. My PREGNANT wife and I had not ate because we were trying to beat Costco closing time. In our way back we decided to stop at this Applebee's Biggest mistake of my life!!!!! . When me and my PREGNANT wife were seated the hostess took our drink order and got us our drink.. After 20mins seating down nobody had check on us and I asked the hostess if someone was going to take our order. She said that the waiter had probably forgot about us because they were super ""busy"" BUSY!!!!! that place was half empty!!!!! Then the Manager came took our order. Food took 40 mins to come out. Our food was cold and your should of seen my ""Steak"" it looked like a meatball.  The hostess were rude and lazy!!!! There was 3 hostess in the front just chit chatting!!!! If the waiter was so busy they should of helped him with orders instead of walking back and fourth just chit chatting!!!!! Then when we were eating nobody ever checked on us to see if we needed anything else. Hostess and waiter would just walk back and fourth. I would try to make eye contact to ask for help but once they would see me they would turned the other way!!!!! Once we finished eating I put  my debit card on the side of the table to pay and get the hell out of their. No bill was ever brought for another 15mins finally I called someone and told them to charge my card because I had to leave ASAP manager came out apologized and said meal was on them because we never saw a waiter. I guess they saw my pregnant wife and I were annoyed. I give the manager 5 stars for handling the situation right. But she needs to put her crew on check or trained them a bit better.  Also people behind us were annoyed. They went off on one of the hostess and some guy kept on chasing them around the restaurant for service.  Sorry Applebee's in Dublin I will never put foot again here. My business has been lost on this one. You guys should at least tried a little better service specially since my wife is 7months pregnant!!!!!!"
Al K.,"Fremont, CA",0,10,,1.0,8/21/2016,"Very poor service.  The food was average at best for the amount you pay.  Should have gone to another place.  On top all that the server tried to give us the meal we didn't order and then charge us for the meal we didn't order.  Then I pointed this out, he wanted to comp the bread to even out the check and not properly correct the bill.  This was the worst experience ever.  Guess I won't be back here again."
Chrissy M.,"Saratoga, CA",25,29,48,3.0,8/10/2014,On 8/8/14 we got there at 6:00 pm. We were seated right away.  We had seven people party.  It's ok but not my type of place.
Matthew A.,"Dublin, CA",118,266,641,1.0,2/6/2013,"Lunch...not worth it. Came here for lunch today with co-workers.  Not much to pick from on the Lunch menu - salads and soups.   The food came out...Presentation was nice.  However, the soup was at best warm, the bread stick was stale, and the salad portion was hella tiny.  After tip was factored into the bill we each paid like $9.00 each...Rip Off!!  Hmm...I'm still hungry..exactly. Lunch special?  Whatever...  The place looked clean, and the ladies were nice.  Not many people were coming in at this time.  I should have taken the hint. I won't be coming back here again...not for lunch anyways. Sorry...It didn't work for me."
