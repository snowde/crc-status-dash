Michael G.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",0,20,,1.0,11/8/2014,"The worst Applebee's I've ever been in. Poor food choices, poor food, poor service. Asked for 1000 Island dressing -- NO. Asked for water from two servers -- NEVER ARRIVED. My iced tea went dry three times, and when the server finally did come to the table I had to ask even then. The veggies were so overcooked that I couldn't lift them with a fork.  Another minute and they would have been soup. I think they were from a previous day. The House Sirloin was small, dry, overcooked and full of gristle.  I left more than half on the plate. The ""sauteed"" mushrooms were either raw or burnt, depending on the bite. I got only a fork with my salad but the lettuce was chopped so coarsely I couldn't fit it in my mouth. When the steak arrived, I only got a knife and had to rescue the salad fork to eat. Roundly ignored by all the wait staff when I wanted water, or utensils, or more tea,  I should have been more mindful of the empty parking lot. Obviously the locals have caught on. There were only seven people at tables when I arrived on a Friday evening -- and then I saw that three of the seven were actually waiters watching TV because there was nothing to do.  The wait staff out-numbered the clients while I was there. Again, this was a Friday evening. There's more, but I'll spare you.  The only plus was lots of available parking, if you know what I mean."
Filip B.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/29/2015,"WORST experiences EVER!!! I've given this place lots of chances of making it up to me. Fail after fail gives me no choice but to write this review. First of all, the service sucks. I get a better service at a McDonald's drive through. The manager is absolutely hopeless. She yells at people and is totally irresponsible for any of her actions. The older Mexican waitress is absolutely the worst waitress on earth. Not only does she take down your order on a napkin, she manages to get everything wrong!! Top of the iceberg, no one ever checks up on you, no one refills your drink, no one cares that you're even there - giving them business."
Cathy H.,"Tracy, CA",0,41,,2.0,8/12/2016,"Slow, slow, slow....get it organized. Good ok, but you usually can get quick service on take out. Took 15 min to get my change back. Counted 2 tables and two of us at the bar."
Starr B.,"Willow Glen, San Jose, CA",66,29,23,1.0,8/9/2014,"The service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress was nice but hooooorrible service. It took 30 MINUTES just to refills. We even put all 3 out of 4 cups in the middle of the table hoping they'd notice. The food runner and MANAGER brought us our food and literally passed it out and walked away, they didn't ask if we needed anything and didn't acknowledge our empty cups.  We started eating and about 15 MINUTES later our server finally made her way over to see if everything was OK. My mom had to point out that we needed refills. We were checked on TWICE but the second time was only to bring us our drinks. Then we were all done eating just waiting for the check and she dropped it off and walked away and didn't bother pre-bussing the table. We had the card out and ready cause we didn't have time to wait another 15-20 minutes for her to run the card since my brother had a game and has to be there an hour early. The $8 tip was only because my mom has a heart and couldn't leave just $5. I use to be a server and if I had paid $5 was all she would have gotten.  I took a picture of our table before we left, it looked like there were more than 4 people at our table."
Margarita V.,"Richmond, CA",340,180,490,3.0,6/21/2014,I can't complain because I got everything I wanted even if I didn't get what I wanted at first. I ordered the Bleu cheese burger and my server brought me the cowboy burger. .. I didn't touch it.  Sent it back and got my correct burger not so long after. The burger was DELICIOUS. It exceeded my expectations for an Applebee's burger... not sure what I was expecting.  Never ordered one before this night. I replaced my fries with a ceasar salad. No extra charge thank you. And even tho our waiter wasn't in the best mood (he looked really tired) he still did his job and he did it in a timely manner. People make mistakes. I'm not docking points for an incorrect order especially when it was deliciously fixed. Other than that the atmosphere was great. The hostesses that greeted and seated us were very outgoing so it helped put a good vibe on the meal to start. Good job!
Angela B.,"Castro Valley, CA",1,25,3,2.0,2/23/2016,Went in with my coworker on our lunch break and our bartender was real shitty. Very unfriendly and service was extremely slow. He was a small white guy with a crappy attitude. He kept walking by and ignoring us when we were trying to pay and we ended up being late back to work.
Joseph M.,"Dublin, CA",16,82,52,4.0,1/1/2016,This is a great spot for a decent price meal and lots of options. The service is great if you utilize the computer system. The waiters and staff are very friendly here and it's a nice good family environment. Many people forget about this location because it's a little far away from most other facilities and you have to drive toward it in order to run into it. So this offers a great spot with not a heavy load of traffic.
Joseph D.,"Dublin, CA",29,50,19,1.0,7/18/2014,"Tried to go here before a movie, but because it too so long for them to take our order and get us our food, we had to leave without eating.  When we complained about it, our waitress just walked to the register, rang up someone else's order, then came back five minutes later to argue about it.  No apology.  No trying to make it right.  No effort at customer service.  So we left.   We might have stayed and rushed to eat if they were even slightly accommodating or apologetic."
John W.,"Hayward, CA",156,265,192,5.0,8/12/2014,"I've read some of the negative reviews well after I had already been to this location. I must say I found this place both professional courteous and the service was fast. Not long after I was seated my sever came by I told her I wasn't ready to order yet. But I take a coke in the meantime, the soft drink was fine no funny after taste like some places. When she returned I order the 4 oz. Sirloin  Steak with Vidalia Onions medium rare accompanied with Shrimp Scampi Linguine.  A short wait and my food arrived, I even found myself looking for a reason not to like this meal! I loved it, the steak was tender n juicy the onion slice was large enough to slice a meat onion combo per fork full, and let me tell you about this Linguine it was rocking and rolling! Since it was the middle of the afternoon I considered this a light meal but filling. Would I come back yes, in a New York minute."
Diana W.,"Dublin, CA",3109,423,463,1.0,11/24/2012,"For the longest time I hated Applebee's would never go there at all. But I started dating a guy who absolutely loved the place, we go here a lot, but everytime I actually find a dish I love somewhere they seem to take it away! Me, and the bf went here recently just to find out they got rid of the one dish I like, the sizziling chili lime chicken! It was one of my aboslute favorite things to get anywhere! And when I tried to find something else on the menu nothing sounded good! I hate mushrooms, and there in the majority of there dishes! I don't like shrimp, and because of dietary restrictions I can't have cheese, so I'm basically screwed. The bf always seems to be happy with his 3 app trio dish he gets. With 2 sets of wonton tacos, and 1 set of boneless buffalo chicken wings. And on top of that there have been multiple times where we got service that was sub-par."
Sheri R.,"Livermore, CA",0,9,,1.0,8/2/2016,"Went to Applebee's last night, party of 7. Food was decent service was awful. Server brought a app to the table no napkins, silverware or plates, We waited and had to ask for them. She brought plates nothing else. Dinner is now served no silverware, had to ask for that The topper of this was we each had three drinks, not one of the dirty glasses were removed from the table. Now it's dessert time , we are celebrating a 9 yr. old Birthday. Dessert is served with 21 glasses, 7 dirty plates and other misc. left on the table. We  wanted to take a pic of the birthday girl but could not really with such a dirty table. This server really must hate her job, doesn't she know this is how we tip? I did tip her but only 10 % she could have got 20% on a 165.00 bill...I wanted to leave nothing but I just couldn't be that rude. This was the birthday girls pick....I will not return to this restaurant"
Tiffany Y.,"East Bay, CA",1970,821,1108,2.0,1/1/2013,"Came in on a Saturday night around 11 with my friends.  It was my first time ever at Applebees ( chain restaurants with names like Applebees or Mimi's or anything like that just never appealed to me )  We were seated pretty quickly, but it took them sooo long to take our order.  Half the time the waiters / waitresses were just sitting on the bar and talking to each other...  They didn't have very good communication with each other either, because they waitress would keep on saying I will get your server for you etc. etc. but then she would just end up taking our order.  I hate when people do that... if you are so unorganized try to at least hide this from your patrons.   We ordered the fried green beans, buffalo bites, and wonton chicken tacos.   The fried green beans are delicious !!! Too bad they only come with like 15. The sauces they came with ( a horseradish dip & a more vinaigrette type of dip) did not taste very good to me, but my friends liked them. The green beans were salty enough to me anyways that I didn't need dip.  Be forewarned this dish is 920 CALORIES. really? where do these calories come from.??  Buffalo bites were really vinagrey and not spicy at all even though we ordered spicy meh..  The wonton chicken tacos looked really good on the menu, but they looked so lonely and sad on the plate.  They are really small, and not really worth the price.  Best thing about this night was the $1 jello shots.  pineapple is delicious.  These shots barely have any alcohol in them though. I still want to come here again and try their regular food."
Alyssa P.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,15,1,1.0,4/27/2016,"This is by far the most unprofessional and unpleasant restaurant I have ever been to. I stopped coming to this Applebee's for almost a year due to numerous awful experiences, including the incredibly rude staff that just ignores you and the continual mistakes made with both my and my husband's orders. Unfortunately they closed both the Livermore and San Ramon locations, so last night I decided to give the Dublin Applebee's ONE last chance. And just as I thought, big mistake. The same older waitress that has been there for forever was there with her same rude, bitter attitude as always. That is not acceptable behavior for how you treat any customer. Months ago, the last time I was in, I left a note on the receipt about the poor service from our waitress Mercedes, and last night when we went in she didn't even apologize, but instead all she said was ""Wow I haven't seen you guys in awhile, thanks for your note last time"" and continuously kept glaring at us the entire time, acting extremely childish and immature. Not to mention, our food was not good and it was cold. So once again, I will absolutely NEVER return to the Dublin location again! This is the location they need to close."
Pamela S.,"San Ramon, CA",10,30,7,1.0,5/13/2015,"We've come here two different times. The first time we were seated in bar area, waitress never came or acknowledged us. We left after being ignored after 30 minutes.  Then we thought lets give this place another chance, we come in again, and sit in the dining area, again waitress ignores us for 30 minutes. We ended up staying and having our dinner, food took forever to come and service was so-so. We are never coming back to this location. I do not recommend it. (This is the Applebees in Dublin near the Hacienda Theatres)."
Jenny F.,"Concord, CA",1,19,2,1.0,4/6/2014,"Service was horrible. Walked in and waited 10 minutes to be seated (place was almost empty) then when we were seated we waited 10 minutes until we asked to speak to the manager. We informed her about our wait and she got someone to come help us, he didn't introduce himself, didn't even have a smile. We ordered and never saw him again. Food was good and that's they only reason why they even get a star. No one looked happy to be working here. I can honestly say people working at a funeral home are happier and filled with life.  Step your game up Applebee's or you'll keep getting 30 cents tip."
Jeff G.,"Walnut Creek, CA",70,6,,1.0,8/13/2015,"Look, no one expects too much from Applebee's. Just don't be a dick to your customers and at least microwave the food after you pull it from the freezer. Sadly, my low bar to satisfaction has not been met.  However, bonus tip- if you fill out the customer survey on your phone at the bar, and then ask the manager for her name midway through (it's Susan) she'll give you a couple bucks off."
Philip N.,"San Ramon, CA",0,7,,2.0,11/15/2015,The food and the wait staff are fine.. Just not a fan of the digital devices on the table that will automatically charge 2 dollars if the kids start playing on it. That's an unethical move on the part of Applebee's to not even warn before they start playing.. Why put a sticker on the device when it can be a quick pop-up warning to the kids about a purchase. Corporate Applebee's needs to take heed that this is unfriendly and unethical
Sean W.,"Concord, CA",3,123,,2.0,8/23/2015,Is not too much something special you can say about Applebees. it's the same type of restaurant everybody knows. the only thing I can speak about that was okay was the bar. bartender may be a good strong drink I appreciated it very much good job buddy
Mike S.,"Coopersburg, PA",7,35,17,5.0,6/27/2014,"I am giving 5 stars for a few reasons. First reason is to bring up the overall rating that almost sent me away. We had a party of 10 (not an easy group to satisfy). Second - The waitress was awesome (Rebecca) and the food was great. Thirdly - For ten people we ordered, were served and we finished our meals within 50 minutes. Finally - I LOVED my Fiesta Lime Chicken - for a chain - the dish was fantastic and the prices are very reasonable.  Regarding the service experience others had - I would only say we came when it was not very busy; 3:15 on a Friday afternoon. I recommend giving it a try. We were very happy."
Annie T.,"Fremont, CA",35,100,75,1.0,12/24/2013,"Believe the prior reviews!! Came here twice before both on off hours and my review is still not good. Today, was no different. Family came to eat at 9PM; it was pretty empty with about five other tables. Abby, our waitress, was probably the only redeeming thing about this place. Super friendly, fast, and ready to help out. Other than that, after she took our order, it all went downhill.  My white peach sangria and dad's golden margarita came 10mins after the food. The appetizer of potato twists, a cup of soup, and three sliders took 30mins. The sliders understandable, but 40mins for two drinks and three appetizers. No.  The entrees of riblets, fish&chips, and a steak came shortly after. The food, was of poor quality. No flavor. Everything bland. I had to add salt and ask for more sauce for everything. The drinks weren't even good either. I didn't even think an alcoholic drink could taste bland, but Applebee's somehow did it. Seriously, not impressed.  Will not recommend. Will not return. 0.5/5 for the semi decent service."
