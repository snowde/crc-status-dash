Ashbeezy B.,"Suwanee, GA",1584,375,6404,4.0,12/18/2017,"After a long day on the media circuit, it was was time to unwind. A colleague and I decided to meet up at Applebee's. I recently heard about their new Topped Steak & Twisted Potatoes Menu. Sounded interesting. Oh I was in for a big surprise.   Our usual hangout is the Applebee's on Pleasant Hill Rd. in Duluth, Ga. Its in a great proximity to the movies and popular shopping outlets. I grew up in this area so its always like coming home.   This unique menu features a 6 ounce or 8 ounce USDA choice top sirloin. Only the cream of the crop for their customers. The options for toppers are mouthwatering. Tavern mushroom & onion, Savory herb & butter sauce and lastly creamy horseradish & gravy. But wait. There is so much more.    Things get real creative when it comes to the potatoes. The classic favorite is the garlic mashed potatoes. Live a little on the wild side with Twisted tots and loaded potato casserole. In addition to this, you have an option for vegetables.    A mountain of food weighed our table down. Savory herb & butter sirloin dazzled on a plate with a hearty side of twisted tots and grilled veggies. The aroma was intoxicating. I didn't think Applebee's was known for its steak. And what an impressive display it was.   My colleague chose a sirloin topped with Tavern mushrooms & onion. It was garnished with fresh broccoli and that tasty potato casserole. Both steaks were cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor.    I was tempted to venture into dessert. I am absolutely in love with the triple chocolate meltdown. However, my stomach was well past capacity at the close of this evening. My friend was on the same page and was full too.   The price of these menu items is far lower than the value. Want more food for your bucks? Visit your neighborhood store for the Topped Steak & Twisted Potatoes! Kudos to Applebee's on an incredible promotion. We will be back!   #Applebees #ToppedSteaksandTwistedPotatoes #ashsaidit"
Christine T.,"Lawrenceville, GA",96,20,20,1.0,10/6/2017,Worse place to eat with the worst food. Our server Kachae C was a terrible a server. Well she wasn't even taking care of us.  Another server Courtney had to take care of us she was amazing. So we gave the cash tip to her. Kachae C had the nerve to ask me how old I was out of no where. Took my friends drink while cleaning the table when she wasn't even done !!  The food and service come on now.  Now I gotta go eat somewhere eles.
Adalys S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,2,,1.0,12/31/2017,If I could give this place no stars I would! My sister in laws purse went missing. She called Apple Bees to see if it was there they told her it wasn't. Later on in the day they called her saying her purse was found but without the wallet. Not to mention there was $300 in her wallet. So she called the police but conveniently her section was out of sight from the cameras. So since there is nothing we can do I'm going to write this review because what happened was shady and this establishment sucks. Don't waste your time and if you do keep your things close to you.
LaShonda H.,"Marietta, GA",201,301,939,1.0,4/14/2017,"I wish I could give this place -1 stars. I'll give them 1 star because the good was decent. The service here is TERRIBLE. Our server waited 15 minutes to come by the table and greet us. All the while he's checking on two other tables in our vicinity. How hard is it to take a drink order and check on your other two tables who are already eating?  He finally comes to the table and at that point my friend is pissed.  His whole demeanor was playful as if he thought we were all old pals. He cracked too many jokes for me. Can't you tell we're not in the mood for that? We quickly ordered food and drinks and the waiter  seemed to handle that fine. Our salads come out and he didn't check us on one time. Once our entrees came out he asked did we want to try the new grateful dead drink. I declined but my friend ordered one.  I had the cilantro lime chicken and switched the rice for fries. The chicken was seasoned well and was pretty juicy. I love the fries here. After my friend gave him the drink order, We watched him walk around and around the restaurant, chatting it up with all of his co-workers and other tables. Comes back 15 minutes later and asks how we're doing?! Ummm waiting on the drink! He says oh let me see what's taking so long. Dude you never put the order in!!! He comes back with the drink and tries to blame the bartender. I was so ready to go. Especially when he kept describing the drink as a grape popsicle. Smh. Applebees, the food waa decent but just wasn't worth the crappy service."
Robyn F.,"Norcross, GA",57,31,7,3.0,11/21/2017,Ordered the shrimp platter and it was ok the shrimp couldve been seasoned more properly.
Mrng R.,"Lithonia, GA",40,68,214,4.0,5/17/2017,"Update hadn't been back in almost a year. Much better this time, its on a Tuesday night around 9p still moderately busy. The  service was really good our waiters name was Damien or something like that and he was fast friendly and courteous. Also the food was really good that was actually the best part the presentation the color and the flavor of the food was really on point my son and I both ordered the grilled chicken and shrimp on a stick,, it was brought out by two neatly dressed people I'm not sure who they were but the way they brought the food out and presented it to us was impressive.  I can tell that Applebees is really trying to get better."
Lucinda Y.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,2,1,2.0,10/6/2017,"I went to eat here with my best friend and it took about 7 minutes for our server to come over. After we ordered it took about 10 minutes for us to get our lemonades. I'm not sure if our server had too many tables but she seemed too busy. When we finally received our food from another server, our original server finally came to check on us again. Overall I give 2 stars because our server was just not good and even asked my friend how old she was!"
Izzy P.,"Lawrenceville, GA",103,8,,1.0,10/7/2017,"The manger is CLUELESS. we called and spoke to Ron to ask for the wait time and he said 15 minutes. We get there and it's over an HOUR long. IRRESPONSIBLE, IGNORANT MANAGER"
Ryan T.,"Atlanta, GA",134,76,92,1.0,8/24/2016,The food was ok but the bathroom was disgusting.  The cheese sticks were cold. The chicken tenders were cold. My alcoholic beverage was weak.  I went to wash my hands and someone threw up in the sink and the floor was filthy.  Our waitress was very helpful and sweet though. ^_^ I won't be returning to Applebee's ever again. I'll stick to Friday's.
Mimi S.,"Marietta, GA",0,1,,2.0,11/26/2017,The wait here is terrible... it's been nearly an hour since we came and our food has yet to come out. I would understand if it were busy but there are hardly any people. Service is utter disappointment.
Gwen J.,"Buford, GA",38,26,10,4.0,9/16/2017,"I haven't been to Applebee's in a while. I really enjoyed the food, drinks and service. We were able to enjoy good music and several football games. This location is definitely better than some of the other locations I've gone to in the past."
Ziggy S.,"Atlanta, GA",7,81,,1.0,10/15/2016,"One of my guilty pleasures in life is to read reviews of Applebees restaurants. I highly recommend it! You can read reviews from Anchorage to Miami, and they're all the same; food is cold, service is incredibly slow, and managers are pricks. One of the mysteries of the ages is how this company stays in business. The other mystery is why people continue to eat there. Their new promotion has cost them tens of millions of dollars. Most of the restaurants now have wood-fired grills installed. It will simply add an extra step for the ex-Burger King chef to get that chicken breast a little bit smoky before it's slapped in the microwave and then sentenced to a slow death under the warming lamp while said high school chef heads outside to smoke a blunt."
Marie C.,"Buckhead, Atlanta, GA",0,12,,1.0,9/12/2017,I went there last weekend. There was a bug in my drink. I exchanged it for another. Then I asked for cheddar cheese in my burger. They brought the burger with a different cheese. I ask for my cheddar cheese. The server came back like 20 minutes later to tell me that American cheese is there only one they have in Applebee's. By then my food was cold. I was so mad. I literally always come here and get cheddar every time. To make matters worse there was a roach crawling across the ceiling. They did nothing about it. I was a regular because it was close by and closes late but not anymore. Very disappointed.
Alex B.,"Lawrenceville, GA",53,18,22,1.0,2/26/2017,By far a horrible restaurant. Shittiest staff i've ever met and I work at a pretty shitty restaurant. This place needs to invest in some new workers if it ever hopes to succeed
Q H.,"Marietta, GA",0,14,1,1.0,1/20/2017,"If half a star was available that's what I would rate this establishment. Not because of the food because we never made it that far! Stood at the door for about 8 min and was never greeted. One waitress/hostess made eye contact with me and smirked, turned around and walked away so we did the same. 1st impressions says they don't want me there so..."
Luisa M.,"Norcross, GA",0,7,3,2.0,2/12/2017,"Good prices, okay atmosphere. Found a hair in my food. There were flies everywhere. The floor was incredibly dirty. Ask for Gabe he forgets to charge you for drinks then asks for a tip as compensations for ""helping you out"". First and last time eating here."
Ricardo D.,"Downtown, Atlanta, GA",2,11,,4.0,7/22/2016,"I like the food, I like the ambiance. Waiting time for service is on the high end but it's not as terrible as people make it seem. Me and my friends usually choose music from the iTunes box whole waiting for our food. We usually get a burger or the baby back ribs and the food always tastes good. Servers are for the most part good and friendly. The only bad thing here is that you'll spend over an hour here, but if your purpose is to chill then it's nice."
Paul Y.,"Lawrenceville, GA",3,2,6,1.0,5/22/2016,I ate here tonight with my girl and I ordered the Philly I'll just say food was okay but the order took so long to come out and just by looking at the plate I was disgusted I honestly think that they should either clean them better or get new plates. The plate just dropped my appetite and made the food look even worse than it already was.
Kara M.,"Atlanta, GA",0,17,,1.0,12/13/2016,"Giving this place one star because that's the lowest I can go. Should have known it was going to be a problem when I saw the low health score. My friend and I stood there for more then five minutes at the hostess stand before anyone acknowledged us. Crazy thing is, it was a slow night. Literally just walked out and was so turned off we decided not to eat here. Don't waste your time at this location. Applebee's used to be a great place but it's going down hill."
Michelle F.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,5,,2.0,11/12/2016,"I gave this place two stars because of what it used to be. This review is not just based on this final visit but from the last two times that I visited this location hoping things would improve.  Maybe it's the time I visit but they always seem short staffed. The front is disorganized and unkempt. After waiting for five minutes and deciding to leave, the waitress came to our table. She was pleasant enough but seemed distracted. The food is not the quality it used to be. It seems as if the kitchen is taking a lot of short cuts. We had the 2 for 25.00 deal. I ordered the ribs with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The order came with an appetizer. The appetizer was brought out the same time as the food. The broccoli was overnuked and tasteless, the mashed potatoes tasted like dirt and the ribs were underwhelming.  Why the current manager of this once thriving restaurant would feel so complacent about poor reviews baffles me. Maybe he/she can ask the staff to clean the food stains off the blinds in the meantime while trying to figure out how to bring this restaurant back up to the standard it once was."
Mark A.,"Denton, TX",4,28,7,4.0,12/20/2016,"I arrived late evening after a long day of work. I stopped in for a few drinks and I was blown away. It was like a night club after 8pm. good music playing, nice ladies at the bar. and of course great food."
Sean R.,"Downtown, Atlanta, GA",154,1,1,1.0,4/30/2016,Absolute garbage for food and service is terrible. Avoid this place at all costs. Nasty white shit all over kids steamed broccoli. Couldn't cook a steak to save their lives. Hell they couldn't even get the chicken fingers right.
Kayla M.,"Atlanta, GA",0,5,1,2.0,11/20/2016,"This is by far the WORST experience I've had since coming here. We showed up at around 7:45, went to the hostess, she didn't look very happy that she had to do her job so she walked around to go find us a table and we got sat. Server came by and asked us what we'd like to drink, told him and didn't get our drinks till about 15 minutes later. We ordered our appetizer, and then our server came back 15 minutes later to ask us AGAIN what our appetizer was..like really?? So we give him our entree order, and then 10 minutes goes by and comes by our tables and asks us what we ordered??? ARE YOU JOKING!? I'm a waitress, and I would be SO appalled with myself if I was like this to my customers. I still stand by with my server family and I tipped my always 20% as always. But never should a waitress let their customers hang and keep waiting. I will be coming back, but not to have him serve me."
Rita B.,"Atlanta, GA",0,5,,1.0,5/18/2017,"I ordered the double crunch shrimp to go and when I got home I discovered the shrimp had absolutely no taste whatsoever. When I contacted the manager, instead of being concerned about my satisfaction, he told me the shrimp come in a box and they just fry them. He never offered me another meal or  refund. I will not patronize this restaurant again."
Jennifer A.,"Atlanta, GA",123,79,60,2.0,3/5/2016,"The ambience was horrible! It was quiet and boring. The bartender took forever to come! I wasn't happy about the service. The drinks were decent. I had the siracha shrimp with the chicken quesadillas. It was well seasoned. But, I would t come here again. It wasn't like your typical Applebee's."
Peter K.,"Atlanta, GA",47,412,125,1.0,7/19/2013,"FALSE ADVERTISING Group: ""We'd like to order from the half-off appetizer menu."" Waitress: ""Is it 11 PM?"" Group: ""It's 10 PM. And the sign says it's from 10 PM till close."" Waitress: ""Well, at this location it starts at 11 PM."" Group: ""Then why do you have these signs throughout the restaurant?"" Manager: ""Because it's valid for all other Atlanta locations, just not this one."" Group: ""If you advertise it, you're supposed to honor it."" Manager: ""If we honored it for you, then we'd have to honor it for everyone."" W O W . . . . . does service get worse than this? Actually, it does. And you can experience it here at Applebee's On top of this horrible awakening of restaurant service here at Applebee's  along with a 30 minute wait to get seated and another 30 minute wait to order our food, we finally got to place orders. SERVICE: 0 stars. Wait... Yelp only allows you to give 1-5 stars. Yeah, I'm giving it 0 stars. The wait time to get seated, the wait time to order, and not bringing out a salad along with taking another 20 minutes to take our method of payment after you bring us the checks. Awful. Oh, not to mention not honoring the Happy Hour Half Off deal. FOOD: 1 star. I ordered a 7 ounce sirloin steak medium rare, and it came out medium well. By the time I got my food, I was hungry enough that plastic probably would have tasted just as good. The onion rings had way too much breading (probably 60% of it was breading) and the broccoli and mashed potatoes were pretty normal. AMBIANCE: It's a small restaurant that's packed in way too tight. There are very few aisles where you can have two people walk down it so it's just awkward when a waitress/waiter tries to get around you while you're trying to walk into or out of the restaurant. Oh, beware of the multitude of smokers just outside of the restaurant. It's tough not smelling like it when you leave."
Elizabeth W.,"Lawrenceville, GA",609,14,,5.0,9/12/2016,"We had lunch at the Duluth, Ga Applebee's today and our server, Courtney, was delightfull! The food was good too. (I had a fried chicken salad). Thanks for the great smile, attitude and customer service!"
ChauPha N.,"Clarkston, GA",265,326,407,4.0,9/30/2014,"It has been a long time since i have eaten in an Applebees'. Mainly because the foods tasted like fast foods and the service was horrible. But my trip at this location and with Jessica, our waitress, made me rethinks about dining here more often in the future. Jessica was very helpful and patient and nice. She explain all my questions throughly and give me some great description of the dishes. This kind of service is usually rare at places like Applebee's, so this made me want to come back more in the future for sure! Since Applebee's been having their two for 20$ menu for the past couple of years, every time i stop by i usually order from this menu. Off this menu, I ordered the chicken freshcado and my friend orders the bourbon street chicken and shrimp. Out of the two dish, I enjoyed mine more. It tastes more healthy and fresh. the Bourbon street chicken was more on the salty side. But the chicken in both entree was cooked perfectly so that was good. We also split an appetizers of chips and artichoke dip.  Overall, I would deff. come back for the affordable menu and the great service!"
Chenice W.,"Snellville, GA",30,2,,3.0,5/6/2016,"Overall food was good, but the waitress kachae was a bit rude and very unprofessional. She didn't even wait for my bf to finish telling her his order before she just walked off..location was ok, kinda noisy but that was due to the large group at the bar."
ChrisAnne S.,"South Elgin, IL",10,40,26,1.0,2/18/2015,"I could NOT wait to get home to write this review, so I will cut right to the chase. I had not been to this location in a few years because of the less than stellar service, but I was excited about their new Pub Menu so we thought we would give it a try. Big mistake.  DO NOT GO HERE! I literally just left the restaurant and this is what we experienced. Keep in mind, the store was NOT busy, even at lunch time so that should tell you something.  1. We did get seated immediately, but it took the server about 10 minutes to get to us. Once she took our drink order and left, (and about 5 minutes later) another waitress comes over and asks to take our order. We indicated our waitress had already been there, and we were still waiting. She seemed confused because it was supposed to be her table. Once we finally got our water about 5 more minutes after that, we ordered. I ordered the new brisket nachos and French Onion Soup and she got the Cajun Shrimp and Chicken. I asked that the waitress bring the soup and nachos out as my entrée. I really will not quibble about the food coming out together because there were more serious issues at hand. The soup was really the only decent thing - it wasn't piping hot, but it had a good flavor - lots of cheese and a generous portion of croutons.  The brisket nachos looked REALLY good and I decided to order them for a change. ( I usually get the fiesta lime chicken)  The meat was DISGUSTING. I absolutely love beef brisket, but this was shredded beef that looked like it was boiled in water then slopped in liquid cheese.  The texture was mushy, not fork tender like you would expect. It was horrible. It did not taste like brisket either- I can't even describe it. The chips and standard toppings on it were fine, so there is 1 star.  About 10 minutes after I got served, they brought my daughter's entrée out. They served it on one of those fajita plates and was extremely hot, the plate that is. The grilled veggies (onions and mushrooms, and I believe peppers)  were charred, nearly burnt. The aroma was not pleasant. My daughter and I each took a piece of shrimp off the chicken and ate - OMG. It was mushy and nearly raw. We both nearly gagged. Within minutes we were both queasy.  Not one time did our waitress come check on us. We had to ask the hostess to please get the manager. When he came over and we explained our dissatisfaction with the meal, he said we were wrong because he checked the temperature, and then proceeded to pull a blue thermometer out of his pocket and said, ""see? I checked the temperature it was ok and fully cooked."" I looked at him like he was out of his mind. I also let him know about how the nachos weren't good at all.  This is what pissed me off the most. The fact that he would want to argue, and it was an argument, about how we felt our experience and food was and basically just minimize our complaints was beyond me. He said he would take the chicken/shrimp off (chicken was not even touched) but we were made to pay for the nachos. I wish I would have taken a picture so you can see that the nachos were barely touched.  My daughter and I did indicate that we were a bit queasy, but he kept on saying it wasn't his product. It was.  He brought us the check and waited for me to give him payment. I paid- but only making sure I had a survey on my receipt because I am getting with Corporate on this one. He has no business being a manager.  On a side note, two business men came in about 5 minutes after we did and were in seated in the next booth. They waited a hellava lot longer than we did to even get a waitress to order a glass of water. When she finally showed up the guy came right out and said - FINALLY, it took you long enough, we have been here a long time, so we are already starting out badly. She giggled as she said, ""oh sorry"". So to recap, service was slow, food was disgusting, and the manager should not be one.  As we left the building and walked on to the parking lot, my daughter says ""Mom, I don't feel...."" and then proceeded to throw up everywhere. I hope they were quick to clean that up, because no one would walk into that restaurant ever again if they saw that.  Have a nice day!  :)"
Melanie B.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,3,1,1.0,6/20/2016,"Visited on a Monday around 3pm. Floor was filthy. Had R&B music blasting so loud it gave me a headache. Food was greasy and cold. My server never returned to check on me, thankfully they have those presto tablets you can use to check out yourself. Worst Applebee's I've ever been to hands down."
Theresa S.,"Roswell, GA",13,24,8,1.0,5/6/2016,"We had an awful meal. The burger was over cooked as was the onion rings. Small portion of onion rings. The music was so loud it was hard to have a conversation. One song playing had lyrics about breaking womens' backs and about ""eating women like Oreo's"" . Very inappropriate for a family restaurant. The manager said ""it's in the jukebox so there is nothing I can do about it"". This was at 2:30 in the afternoon. I would never go back here or recommend it as a family restaurant. The ladies room was dirty too. Not a good experience!"
Spencer T.,"Stone Mountain, GA",4,9,,2.0,5/6/2016,"The place is fine for an Applebee's. The waitress needs to dress a lot more professional, yoga paints is not professional."
Tyrell L.,"Suwanee-Duluth, GA",5,4,1,1.0,3/27/2016,"Don't feel like writing a super detailed or very articulate review , but I will say this , the Thai salad should be removed from the menu , I ultimately felt like I had just a bowl of lettuce . My gf's burger was late and dry, her side was wrong , her burger came In pieces , everything was separate for no reason , all on the side. Long story short, horrible expierence. Waitress wasn't as good as she could've been, she tried though so I can't bash her too much . But this just might've killed Applebee's for us , we'll this location for sure."
Kundan S.,"Norcross, GA",21,61,28,5.0,3/1/2016,I went here for brunch maybe that's why the server gave us the best service because it wasn't packed. This place stays open late and must be famous for that. They always have great deals and combos. Our food tasted amazing and the environment was awesome and pleasant. Would def go back!!
Shannon P.,"Atlanta, GA",3,43,12,5.0,9/27/2015,"I really like this location for late night dining. We call it ""Club Applebee's"" because they play hip hop music at a louder volume and everyone in there is always having a good time and the bar is always full. The crowd is late 20's to early 40's... I suggest going there before going to a real club/bar - it's more fun and open late!"
Chris L.,"Atlanta, GA",82,47,,4.0,12/20/2014,"This is an Applebee's that's conveniently located off of I-85 Exit 104 (Pleasant Hill Road).  I came here for lunch with my dad and brother. My brother and I wound up getting the 2 for $20 deal. We each got two salads, which were generous portions, enough so that I couldn't finish it entirely before my main entrée came. We also split a sweet potato fries appetizer, which includes three unique and tasteful sauces.  I wound up getting the chicken fingers basket while the other two got a chicken penne pasta and a mushroom Swiss burger. Our food came out in a speedy manner, with all things considering, and our waitress was very attentive and filled our drinks without us waiting. The food was tasteful and enough so that my brother and I had to get small to-go boxes to bring the rest home. I would definitely come here again! A little slow in terms of getting the to-go boxes and too many screaming kids. I know that the second thing is something that Applebee's can't take care of, but then again, it does take away from the experience."
Veda W.,"Duluth, GA",383,57,236,3.0,11/1/2014,Stopped in for the drink specials only tonight. The house looked packed. No seats at the bar but we were seated right away. Our server Sewit was a sweetie. The House Margarita was weak but hey it's 2.99. For $1 more you can add a shot of tequila. I'll try that next time. If you like fruity drinks like myself then try the Zombie! Mmm..
Charity D.,"Tucker, GA",2,15,2,1.0,8/11/2016,I have to give 1 star but really want to give 0 stars.Um...bad service that's all I can say and food was  mediocre. As I was walking out I notice 82 was the food score wish I knew before I sat down ordered and ate... Should have just went to Waffle House... Bottom line never coming back. Waitress was not helpful and kept coming with excuses... It wasn't even that pack in there ...done!
D S.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,5,,1.0,11/3/2015,Last night a fight broke out with the wait staff in the middle. The manager here appears to have no control whatsoever of his people. The foul language and commotion was scary. Many of the servers appear to just come by to hang out but not work while shift employees are trying to serve customers. It was terrible and the people involved should not be allowed to return to this location. I certainly won't.
