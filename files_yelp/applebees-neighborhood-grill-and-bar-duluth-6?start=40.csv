Jennifer H.,"Atlanta, GA",216,89,572,1.0,10/14/2012,"Came here for a late lunch with someone else and we both ordered a chicken salad each as we wanted an easy dish before we started on our road trip. There weren't many people when we were at this location. However, we waited a very, very long time for our salads to come out. Gosh, were they trying to catch the chicken? Why make us wait 40 minutes for just our salads? We were so annoyed at the waiter who did not apologize for the long wait. Just as we were about to walk out the door, the waiter came out with our salads. We politely got back to our seats. I thought salads were pre-made and cut before hand. It is not that hard to put a salad together, guys. Applebee, please get it together and give me a break! Yelp 7/365"
Zulema G.,"Duluth, GA",3,32,2,1.0,10/15/2015,No stars if I could! Been here for an hour not one refill! My chicken wasn't even cooked through had to return it and watch my husband eat his dinner half hour later got my food! No apologies......I guess then
A R.,"Duluth, GA",0,2,,5.0,7/3/2016,"This location is the best Applebee's location, great customer service from Jessica and manager Russell .... they make sure our food is great and we are taken care of in best way. Best place for family lunch and dinner. Keep it up guys!"
Alan T.,"Atlanta, GA",32,19,11,1.0,2/13/2016,"Went there for the Super Bowl and was forced out at 9:30 pm by our rude server. (This place says it closes at 2?) My group and I were having a great time, but then our server ruins our entire experience. A few of us were still eating, but she came and started taking EVERYTHING off our table. She took all the plates, small plates, and then she took away everyone's water! Even the waters of the people STILL eating!! She wasn't giving refills because she put the utensils and trash into the cups. We didn't say we were even done or wanted our checks. She stood there at our table after giving out the checks and made us hurry up and give her our credit cards. My friend was eating and didn't notice that our server was eyeing her down and trying to make her pay so I decided to pay for my friend so the server would stop being so rude and leave. She then brings the checks and stands there waiting for us to tip her..... After we put the tips and signed the merchant copies, we gave her the copies and she left. Remember a couple of my friends aren't done eating. THEN she comes back with a broom and starts sweeping all around us. She then bangs the broom very hard and loudly on one of my friend's chair that is eating!!! After she hit my friend's chair with a broom, we left. This was the absolute worst experience we have ever had at a restaurant. We couldn't even finish watching the Super Bowl cause our server was trying to push us out of the restaurant. Also there was no line of people trying to get into the restaurant at the time. There were empty tables around so we didn't understand why we were being rushed. Oh and when we left, there were so many people still in the restaurant drinking their drinks and enjoying the Super Bowl. Never coming back here again."
Britni A.,"Lawrenceville, GA",1,7,,1.0,3/20/2015,"Best word to describe this place is, WAIT. Hope your not hungry or anything. And when you do get your food i hope everything you need is already there because surprise surprise be prepared to WAIT! So honestly before you get your food go ahead and get up, walk out that door, hop in the car and drive on down to the waffle house, its 5 lights down on your right. Atleast Â they can see that you cant eat because they forgot silverware and youve been waiting for 20 minutes AND atleast they would feel bad an apologize maybe even ""correct"" the check. Oh and just for laughs i wrote all of this while, you guessed it, WAITING! Lol seriously wait, wait... wait you know what dont even bother pulling in the lot. Hope you have a good breakfast/lunch/dinner! :)"
Thao T.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,1,,1.0,11/2/2015,"First of all, the service is horrible. The waiter didn't even came by and check on us. Second, i found a hair in my fries and they acted like it was nothing. I will never come back here again.."
Shaaray M.,"Amityville, NY",2,7,13,1.0,10/24/2015,Horrible. Orderd the Bourbon street chicken ans shrimp $15 and recieved one small peice of chicken and about 4 small shrimps and half of the plate was filled with potato's. I also asked for it without mushrooms and recieved mushrooms. We also ordered the 3 cheese penne and we asked for a side of extra sauce and did not recieve it. We were so fed up with the service a nd the presentation of the food that we decided to never go there again.
Monica U.,"Atlanta, GA",7,16,67,1.0,10/3/2016,"Absolutely terrible. We had a table of 7 called in to have a table ready, gladly got seated. Drinks were taken, and our server seemed a little off. Finally got our order in, waited 40 mins. Finally got it and during that wait we all had finished our beverages. Even after we got our food not once did he check on us nor did he fill up our drinks. (Ate our food without drinks) Also some of the foods were cold- not only that he can laugh and take his time with the other tables but with ours no? An extra 15 to get to go boxes and checks but most of us did the 2 for 20 or 25. He got the checks wrong- had to take more time to do that. My co worker went up to the cash register to ask him a question and he didn't respond to her face. While my other two co workers left and he had to go drinks in hand they kindly asked if they can take it and we would pay at the table cause they had to go. I watched and saw him shaking his head silently cursing to himself cause he was Ina bad mood. There's more to this but overall horrible and yet we still left decent tip. Server name Randy G. I understand the restaurant business I've worked in it before for a couple years I get it but this was honestly absurd."
Renee K.,"Acworth, GA",204,162,47,3.0,1/21/2014,"Giant restaurant chains like Applebee's, O'Charley's, Chili's, etc are pretty linear when it comes to food and service. This place gets a solid a-okay. I met an old friend from high school here last night around 7pm. First off, I almost missed my turn because I didn't see the Applebee's sign soon enough and two, the actual sign on the building wasn't on, so I just saw a dark exterior. Not a deal breaker if you can navigate the crazy traffic on Pleasant Hill. Our server was very friendly and we chatted him for a minute. Unfortunately he couldn't super-size my sangria, but he was kind enough to fill it to the brim. Bless him. My friend and I were so busy catching up that we kept forgetting to look at the menu, but our server never rushed us.  We ordered the chips and salsa ($2.99) to nibble on while we chatted. I haven't been to Applebee's in years, so I don't remember their tortilla chips very well, but these chips were pretty greasy. A napkin was required for these chips. Nonetheless, they were crispy and handled the salsa nicely. Functionality ftw! I ordered the grilled shrimp and spinach salad because I'm trying to be healthy and all that jazz. I honestly wasn't too keen on eating salad when I saw they had a special on burgers and drafts that night, but willpower! I'm glad I stuck with my decision because the salad was very good! Fresh baby spinach leaves and perfectly grilled shrimp came together like white on rice. Like Justin Timberlake and Jimmy Fallon rap battles. Like Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosting the Golden Globes. Like Chewy and Han in Star Wars. I somehow found the strength to save some for leftovers. I forgot what my friend ordered, but she picked at it all night. This place hasn't changed in years. The same booths, the same dim lighting, the same TVs and the pretty much the same food. This place has everything - steaks, burgers, salad, sandwiches, wraps, seafood, chicken dishes and pasta. They don't really have a ""signature"" item they're known for, so most of the food is mediocre and decent at best. Don't expect the food to knock your socks off. Word to the wise: There was a shooting at this location last year over a dispute about football, so be wary."
Lucy L.,"Lawrenceville, GA",2,23,4,2.0,11/3/2013,"I don't know why I keep coming here, so I guess that's why I didn't just give it a 1 star review.  This place has the worst service I have ever experienced, no exaggeration. I try going at times when it's not too busy and the food is still not tasty at all.  The service has been awful every time, but I specifically remember the time that the waitress forgot our drinks, silverware and napkins, and left for a long time until she finally rushed past and asked if everything was ok while she walked away. She never heard us say no."
William K.,"Duluth, GA",33,36,10,2.0,10/28/2013,Corporate bar fare in a late 70's themed restaurant chain that hasn't change the decor in years. The menu branding and images try to hide the the fact this is still pre processed food no better than the items in local grocery freezer. Service however was a over average and friendly in this location. Do be aware that this same location had a shooting recently after a NFL playoff game in the parking lot by an angry New Orleans Saints fanatic.
Laurie B.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,5,1,1.0,2/3/2015,"Walked in at 2:30pm I stood for 5 minutes at the host stand, no one came to greet nor sit me I only saw 1 server in the back of the restaurant. First and last time I walk into this Applebee's.. 1 star is too many"
Brandy N.,"Norcross, GA",0,4,,1.0,7/10/2015,this place use to be good about 15yr ago that is!! I took my daughter here waitress was rude and slow. when she brought our food it was cold. I had to flag another waitress if we can have utensil to get with. she took it off another table. anyway food is bad!! will not be coming back!!
Keyonna O.,"Duluth, GA",14,1,,1.0,12/9/2014,This was the worst experience I had coming here the mangers are rude and the waiters are rude and I will never come here again.
Phong T.,"Stone Mountain, GA",462,435,1806,2.0,9/7/2013,"Meh. Hit or miss on the service depending on who's working. Hit or miss on the food depending on how busy they are. When it's busy, the food's quality seems like a rush-cooked type meal.  This place gets PACKED. Probably because of its location, which is a good and a bad thing.  Bad because the wait is ridiculous. Yes, wait to be seated and wait for the food. Good for them because it's business."
Wen L.,"Duluth, GA",29,62,6,1.0,5/4/2014,Make sure you keep your receipt this place got thieves. I specifically wrote 0.00 for the tip and all of a sudden I check my statement I see a 10.00 increase to my posted transaction. Already reported the dispute to my bank. This is ridiculous.
Lance L.,"Duluth, GA",0,1,,2.0,7/23/2016,"Walked in the door at 10:30 pm. Keep in mind I've been starving waiting for friends. Ordered drinks and appetizers 10 mins shortly after. Drinks take 15 minutes, but it's a Saturday night so that's understandable. Appetizers not so much. Took 40 mins. I actually order a entree after 20min after my app. They came at the same time. While all this is happening I haven't heard anything from the server not a apology or anything. No manager came to they table. I was left in the dark the whole time. When the app. did come out it was cold as if it was sitting there the whole time. Â My burger thank god was cooked perfectly and was hot. That sums up all the bad. On a good not the sever next to ours was attentive with all his tables while running around to help us. His name was Nick thank you so much for you help. Also the host helped as well he talked to the manager early in our visit to help everything along the way, yet the manger never came. He actually spoke to the table next to us about there drink. I thought that was rude. Regardless it was my second time here and I won't be coming back for a while. I am a server at another restaurant, so I know how thing should be done even if some things can't be help you should never keep your guest in the dark."
Sharon E.,"Dacula, GA",37,147,144,2.0,6/15/2013,"My wife and I used to go to Applebees a lot back in California.. The one on Pacific commons, Fremont, California is still one of the best Applebees we have been too.. This one is worst.. the place was very crowded and really noisy, unlike any other of their locations.. The food quality was also bad... Would never go back here again... Service was also bad.. Not sure if they had too many waiters as we could see most of them standing around just watching people eat even in a crowded restaurant..  There are much better eat outs in Pleasant Hill..."
Duc L.,"Atlanta, GA",191,190,26,1.0,5/22/2012,"I hate to give establishments anything under 3 stars because I feel that if they try, then it should be so-so at best, but this place is just horrible.  I know better to stay away from Applebee's since my last visit which was over 2 years ago and never thought to come back but was over-ruled in a group of friends recently to dine here for a late dinner. The guys were really adamant on going here for half-off appetizers after 10pm.  We had a table of 7 which wait time was about what you would expect for a party that large. When we were sat, the waiter constantly forgot our drinks and failed to acknowledge a new member to the group who arrived a little late. We asked him for a drink twice for the new member, still no show after two attempts. Food arrived promptly after ordering which was one of the few positives I can say. When it came down to checks, we physically had to get our waiter to get our checks since he was in the corner talking to another coworker for about 15 minutes thinking he would notice all of us looking at him. The debacle with the credit cards, not getting it right, not printing out the signature slips with him was just a joke. We had to have a manager override his mistake to give us our signature slip for some reason.  Of course the guys who suggested to go here ordered appetizers all around which I've learned to stay clear from. So I ordered Â the cowboy burger, some pink. Burger came a little too close being done than my liking. But the thing that bothered me was that it wasn't hot. It came out just a tad warmer than warm.  My friends ordered everything from nachos to the ultimate trio and some had hot wings also. So with everyone's orders, anything that involved melted cheese (mozzarella sticks, nacho cheese, spinach dip, etc) became hard within about 5 minutes. Mozzarella sticks are good, but when it re hardens before you have a chance to eat it, it becomes gross. I don't know if it's just the quality of the cheese or what, but I wouldn't eat that. The wings were skinny and I think the only appetizer that wasn't critiqued to the floor was the nachos.  I told myself I would not visit this restaurant, so never again. If you're in this area, just go to chili' or steak and shake across the street. It'll save you some disappointment."
Zee Z.,"Gwinnett County, GA",38,78,65,1.0,10/19/2012,"Haven't been to Applebee's in over 3 years. My buddy persuaded me to go here with him to watch the game since the ""drinks are cheaper."" Went here Thursday night. This is not a place to watch football, since the TV's are so small and feel outdated. I asked for a manhattan from the table i was sitting at and saw the bartender pour crown royal and ice into a shaker, strain it and serve it in a large shot glass. Really?? no sweet vermouth or bitters or a cherry?? I wonder who the hell is hiring these bartenders...atleast serve it in the correct glassware you schmucks... i ordered some chili and chips and salsa...which weren't bad...but this experience reminded me why i don't go to Applebee's anymore. Oh and the inside didn't look very clean either. Definitely not fakking going here again."
