Samane K.,"Duluth, GA",0,5,1,1.0,2/22/2014,"Straight to the point, keep in mind wasn't busy at all at 12p.m. Was waiting to be seated for 15min, hostess was rude, didn't seem to like they wanted to work. Finally seated and another 20min later I finally get to order. When I was done had to wait roughly another 15min for my check. Keep in mind not busy at all maybe 10 to 14 customer. I could see the employees chitchat in the back not caring.  When I got my food, is was cold! Cold i say. I had the chicken and shrimp on top of a bed of rice. Sauce was dry, shrimp was overcooked,  rice was very dry and bland. I highly recommend not to come here."
Melissa B.,"Lilburn, GA",1,4,1,1.0,4/24/2015,"Oh my. This place is terrible. The service is awful and the management is rude. We have been here multiple times when we haven't been seated, walked out after waiting to long for a waiter to come to the table, or had our orders messed up. Skip this place and choose anything else! We end up hangry every time we go here"
Dion L.,"Tampa Bay, FL",24,259,111,1.0,8/5/2011,"Oh dear.  Stopping by Applebees is what happens on a Friday, you're on the road back from a business trip, and the other options in town are packed and this seems like the quickest option.  The food is horrendous. Had the under 500 calories filet topped with grilled shrimp and broccoli. It should have been called brown meat disc topped with rubber pink things and raw broccoli. Oh wait. Over salted brown meat disc with rubber shrimp and raw broccoli. Fail.  I will say this...after not eaten in 9 hours I was starving enough to stomach about a third of the dish.  The side salad was not fresh, some leaves were brown and slimy.  The only redeeming portion of this meal was the blondie skillet with maple butter sauce. I did not eat much of the maple butter, or too much blondie since I figured my cholesterol would go through the roof. A quick Google search proved me correct. 50+ grams of fat. It was also pretty cheap. But I would have taken my $21 and used it toward 21 99 cent burritos at Taco Bell. It would have been tastier and less salty."
Jason W.,"Buford, GA",0,1,,1.0,5/28/2013,"Club Applebee's - Ugh My wife and I went for a late lunch, but it is safe to say we will never be going back. Atmosphere - The music was LOUD. We had to yell at each other to have a conversation. The bass on their sound system was cranked so high that it was making our seats bump and our heads ache.  Food - I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and my wife had chicken penne. They were both terrible. The burger was a frozen disc that had no seasoning. It was overcooked and frankly, the Burger King next door do it better and for way cheaper. The chicken penne was cold and the chicken was chewy. Not a good combo for chicken!  Waiter - Our waiter was good. He deserves a tip of the cap for having to serve such terrible food constantly. He kept our drinks full at all times and kept checking on us at regular intervals.  Time for lunch - It was almost 50 minutes by the time we entered this establishment and the time we paid and gladly left.  When we were walking out I turned to look at the restaurant windows and signs. Nowhere did it designate that this is actually Club Applebee's. I was afraid I missed it."
Devon B.,"Duluth, GA",1,18,17,2.0,7/12/2014,"I came out to dinner with my wife, bro, and sister-in-law. We all ordered off the 2 for $11.99 menu. I ordered the steak and chicken, no one else ordered what I ordered, and the waitress wrote down our orders(or at least it appeared that she did...for all I know she could've been scribbling or drawing). After waiting a decent amount of time for our meals, she brought our orders out. No steak and chicken for me!! I got linguini and chicken. No harm no foul, everyone makes mistakes. She apologized, and took my plate back. 15 minutes later, she brings me the same order back. Wth!!!! After realizing she brought me the wrong order the second time, she offers to take it back and request the correct one. NO!!! Can I see your manager?? Manager comes, I inform him of what's going, and he offers to get the correct order in. Again...NO!! I've seen the movie ""Waiting"", I can only imagine. C'mon really?!?! I can understand the first time, but you brought me the wrong plate twice, no excuse for that. I don't need any gift certificates or extras, I just asked for my order to be removed from the ticket. Applebee's needs to do better."
Chris A.,"Atlanta, GA",3,12,9,3.0,3/21/2014,Nice clean. Nice older crowds later in evenings. Food wasn't so good upon one experience. Cake and ice cream for a dollar is amazing. Would def go back
Justin S.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,4,1,1.0,11/9/2012,I love apple bees. But not the one by Gwinnett place mall. Once me and my Girlfriend Got to Applebee's the hostess took us to our table we sat at a table Nobody greeted us and I timed it for about eight minutes At least. Multiple servers and even the manager walked by no one greeted  Or took our drink order. We got up and left and nobody even noticed. This was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had.
Elizabeth A.,"Norcross, GA",0,8,,1.0,7/17/2015,"This place has serious issues.  We visited on July 10, 2015, at about 1 p.m.  Service was indifferent at best and terrible at worst.  We were seated and got our beers pretty quickly, which was fine as we wanted to relax a while.  The server disappeared.  There was a group of them on the other side of the restaurant talking and laughing and generally having a great time instead of seeing to their customers.  I kept smelling something unpleasant and when I looked around there was an overflowing garbage can about 10 feet away just inside the entrance to the kitchen.  We got up and moved, which caused great confusion on the server's part because she had no clue what to do about that.  Another server finally took our orders.  My hamburger was dry and tasteless, the bun was stale and the fries were cold.  My companion's chicken was hard and dry.  We got the bill for the food but it took a long time to get the bill for our drinks.  Additionally, the bathroom was not clean.  I have had it with Applebee's and if they keep this up they won't be in business too much longer.  Get your act together, people!"
S B.,"Atlanta, GA",0,5,,2.0,12/13/2015,Food was amazing. Service was terrible. Waited quite a while for someone just to take our drink order. My appetizer came at the same time as the entree and our waitress was interesting to say the least. It seemed as though she may have been a little tipsy. We actually saw her sit (yes sit) twice and talk to a man for so long we had to tell the host that we were ready to order so she could get her for us. When she made it over we were treated to a very unsolicited conversation about previous customers from days before (this was what prompted us to think she was a little loosey goosey). We had already waited too long to put in the order now we had to sit even longer while she shared these random stories with us. When the food came out another waiter brought it to us and we only received one set of silverware (I was not able to wipe my hands at any point during the meal). Worse service I've ever had. I will likely not return to this location.
Sohee B.,"Alpharetta, GA",43,49,,2.0,9/18/2012,"My friends and I went to this location many times...over 10 years ago. The service became slow, food wasn't as good, sometimes came out cold or wrong. I went recently with my family, not my choice, and it still hasn't got better. Salad isn't fresh and the portions are so much smaller than they used to be."
Mebin J.,"Lawrenceville, GA",67,110,251,3.0,1/1/2013,Best Long Island in town . More kick guaranteed for few bucks. Highly recommend for Long Island lovers.
Iginah J.,"Lawrenceville, GA",48,7,,1.0,10/13/2014,"For some odd reason my kids love Applebees...I could care less for the restaurant, especially this location. Anyway, we go in and there is a family ahead of us..no biggie. We went in 10/13/14 at 2:40pm and walked out at 3:01pm because we weren't greeted, acknowledged, nor seated. I figured this was a decent time to go and well after lunch rush so we shouldve been seated, ordered, and sipping on drinks by this time. Nope!!!! Every time I come in this location its either one of the servers being extremely unprofessional or the hostess. It was really ridiculous that me and 3 kids had to stand at the door and wait for the hostess to say ""Hi, I'll be with you all in just a few minutes"" or ""Sorry for your wait I'll seat you in just a second"". But we got nothing. Even the family before us was waiting. My kids and I were hungry so we left and will NOT be returning. If I want to go to Applebees, which is very rare, I'll drive to Alpharetta. This restaurant is terrible. I live a mile away and find it convenient when my kids want to go but I will never step foot in there again. I wish I could rate this place zero stars. Every time we go in there its something. You people have definitely dropped the ball. NEVER AGAIN!"
mark c.,"San Antonio, TX",4,19,,1.0,3/27/2011,"Dropped in for a late lunch on a Wed afternoon.  I'm glad this was paid for via gift card (the only reason I went).  The so-called Reuben sandwich I ordered had no saurerkraut and no dressing.  It was just dry, salty, and overpriced. The service was inattentive."
Lauren T.,"Norcross, GA",1,5,,1.0,6/28/2013,"Well I went here last Friday for a quick and easy lunch with my husband and 2 kids. Well let me start off by saying this, I am a server and have been in the food industry for 8 years... with that being said this place was atrocious. First off our server Brittany was more worried about her cell phone and playing in the kitchen than to take the proper steps of service and make sure we were okay. I ordered my kids food with the app so that they didn't sit hungry. And what happened they sat, and sat, and sat. HORRIBLE! Once our app hit the table we were starving, but of course what did we find? a piece of fuzz in our food! We get Brittany's attention to tell her and she goes back to the kitchen and comes back and says that the kitchen staff said it was from the cleaning rags in the back! ARE U SERIOUS? so not only did you guys have a rag near my food but one you use to clean with that probably had product on it! Ehh! so of course our food comes out and about 10 mins after that the app hits the table. No management visit, no apologies, no nothing! then on top of that I have to flag the waitress down to get our check and they still had the app on the bill! Are you serious? This place SUCKS! I cannot believe that a corporate restaurant would have such low server standards as well as customer service!"
Yasiin H.,"Norcross, GA",0,21,3,3.0,2/8/2014,I recently went to this place its a pretty solid  experience.The food was good and the service was good.The one thing that didn't amuse me was that the menu didn't have much variety and the two for twenty deals don't amaze me.It is also very loud and not really spacious
Brian M.,"Buckhead, Atlanta, GA",1,55,1,4.0,11/14/2013,"Really good server,  food was good at afair price,  I thought the bar drinks were rather inexpensive."
Andrew A.,"Duluth, GA",0,19,,1.0,5/14/2014,"We went to this restaurant for dinner on a weekday.  The place is more bar than restaurant  and not family friendly.  A bartender (white female) on her break was sitting at a table off to one side of the building having a loud conversation with a black male employee about giving it to him the ""white girl way"".  My daughter heard this and said ""she's being inappropriate"".  And she was, loudly.  The waitress brought us drinks, held against her body, in one arm.  A roll of fat was over the lip of our cups.  Some of our drinks spilled on her sweaty tank top and she didn't notice or she didn't care.  Just plain nasty.  It took two trips to get straws, and even then we couldn't drink them.  The food was terrible, and took forever to get it.  I ordered a steak that came with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The steak was barely warm, the potatoes were cold and only the broccoli was warm, not hot.  My daughter got the kid's french bread pizza and she loves pizza.  She would not eat it.  The bread was barely toasted, and the cheese was nasty.  As we were trying to eat, the hostess starts moving tables next to ours and seats two parties of rowdy people that were there to party.  Not an environment for a family, and the hostess was clueless.  We couldn't get out of the fast enough.  As we tried to leave a woman was blocking one of the doors, standing with her arms on the door looking out.  The other door was blocked by some clueless patron making a phone call.  Once we got through that obstacle we figured out why the one woman was blocking the door.  There was a guy pressure washing the sidewalk at the entrance of the building.  Who does that kind of work during the dinner hour?  This is just a low class, poorly run restaurant.  A classic example of why businesses in the Gwinnett Place area are dying off.  There are no restaurants in that area that are worth going to anymore.  It gets one star because zero is not an option."
Kane M.,"Norcross, GA",39,14,19,1.0,2/21/2010,"dirty and noisey, I'd rather eat at the kids table at the next company picnic."
Anna A.,"Norcross, GA",88,14,1,5.0,1/2/2011,"i love this applebees. they are open till 2 am on saturdays, and they have $2.99 margaritas... its crowded when a games on, but its fun. friendly service, good cheap food, and awesome deserts!!!"
