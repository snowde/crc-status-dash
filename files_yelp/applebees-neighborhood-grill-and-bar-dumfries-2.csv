Marija P.,"Washington, DC",2,1,,2.0,11/21/2017,Came on a wednesday. Not busy. Waitress was very kind. Ordered barbeque brisket taco.....wheres the brisket? I best describe it as slop on a tortilla. Won't be back.
Ron L.,"Woodbridge, VA",22,49,,1.0,9/18/2017,"I see my last visit there was Jan.12, 2016 and vowed never to return...Well sinceI was in the company of 3 others and the couple with us was celebrating their 62nd anniversary, I went along silently... My previous review  just about sums up this latest visit except our wait for EVERYTHING was longer. First after being seated, most hosts ASK if you would like something to drink!!! Not this one, who scooted off to who knows where for 10 minutes before returning...I might note there was only 2 other tables occupied at approx. 1:45pm...we saw only 3 employees the whole time and one disappeared early on...When the hostess returned I quickly requested water and coffee and the standard reply was a NEW pot was being brewed...another 10min wait... With no new customers entering I continue to wonder what the employees are doing if not serving us...When our orders arrived, the food was good, but when you have to wait waaaaaay to long for it when the restaurant is practically empty, there is a serious problem somewhere...and in the back of my mind I believe it was empty  because of the SLOW service. How this location has managed to survive baffles me since speed in turning tables and selling alcohol is their lifeblood. If a restaurant ever needed a firm hand to guide it, this is the one... I must note I have frequented the Applebees on PW Pkwy at Minnieville Rd and continue to b e pleased with their operation and food....."
Juan D.,"Historic Core, Los Angeles, CA",218,1,,1.0,1/1/2018,"Eating here is worse than traffic on 95. Waiters are really good at hide-and-seek. Better off driving an hour more to Fredericksburg for food. It'll be quicker than waiting for your drinks. Games were mediocre at best. If you prefer olive oil, ""butter"" not go here. Oh and the water tastes funny. On behalf of all millennials, we say good riddance."
Raymond W.,"Woodbridge, VA",8,163,162,3.0,6/9/2017,"I come here every once in a while.  Nice atmosphere, friendly waitstaff, and the food is good enough.  It's a chain so don't look for exquisite cuisine.  Stick to burgers and appetizers and you're good.  I tried the steak wonton tacos and they're actually pretty good.  Crisp wonton taco shell with carne asada beef and some really good slaw.  4 to an order is more than enough.  I'll be back eventually."
Andrew P.,"Woodbridge, VA",51,250,60,1.0,2/5/2017,"Absolutely the worse Applebee's experience I've had. I literally sat across from the bar tender's register and she never checked up on me. I was desperately wanting to order food but was so frustrated I left my 90% filled beer and closed my tab.  I was sitting on the peripheral of the bar area and no one came and that's why I sat at the bar. While I was sitting at the bar, another couple sat at the outer tables and received prompt service, attention, and food order.   I invite this location's manager to reach out and discuss this situation."
Valerie W.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,2,,1.0,12/20/2017,"Absolutely worst experience ever. Went for dinner with my fiance and 1 year old. Seated promptly, but I had to get up and get my kids menu myself. It took about ten minutes to get drink orders and the waitress was out of it, kept asking me what I wanted I don't know how many times I have to say lemonade? Placed our appetizers (spinach dip and Wonton tacos) with our daughters mac and cheese. These came out 20 mins later and the wontons were missing one. mac and cheese another ten minutes later. Had to ask twice for silverware and napkins. The waitress took our orders another 20 minutes after the appetizers came, meanwhile as we were eating our dip a different server comes up as I'm eating it lifts it off the table and asks if we're done. Sure take what you just saw me eating? then waitress came and said they didn't have eggs to make my fiances burger.. Fine so he asked for a regular cheese burger. Food came out and the waitress just dropped it off didn't ask if we needed anything (which we did). We needed refills and his burger was wrong. It was just cheese burger and bun. Nothing else. The bill came 20 mins after asking for it. Was charged for the wrong burger, she went to fix it and I asked for a manager.  This is the best part. Manager walks up doesn't introduce herself acts annoyed (very unprofessional) says ""what's wrong I'm the manager"" I start off telling her how his burger was wrong and she wanted to cut me off and argue I said I'm not paying 12$ for a plain burger. She says ""okay"" after arguing with me about what's on a burger. Cool but nothing was on his burger! Didnt even get to mention the terrible service before she walked away. The server promptly brought us our new check that had $2 taken off for the burger. What a joke and slap to my face.  I paid the $45 bill and left no tip. (Which I never do because I have worked in the food service industry a long time.) My assumption they will discount that Bill more to get her a tip after we left.  Rude. Slow. Unprofessional. Not to mention it was not busy. You see a family with a kid I would think you'd be more courteous and a bit faster. Won't be back. And I am emailing corporate about this manager and experience."
DeeDee M.,"Woodbridge, VA",65,16,,1.0,10/7/2017,"Won't be going back here! Everyone knows of course Applebee's are having their $1 margaritas. Long story short after my friend had a second drink, he found a hair in his damn drink!!! Told the bar tender and she says, ""well it must have came from the dishwasher because I'm wearing a weave and I know it's not mine!"" Mind you she's wearing long black curly hair... that looked just like the piece of hair that was found in his drink!!!"
Ivory D.,"Woodbridge, VA",48,64,30,1.0,2/12/2017,"I was really disappointed with my experience here. The bartender, Hasani ( who wanted to make sure I spell his name the correct way) was exceptionally rude to my friend and I. Upon entering the restaurant went straight to the bar and before we were able to sit down completely Hasani, asked us for our id's ""can I see your ID, i want to make sure you all are old enough before you get comfortable"" While I understand making sure your bar patrons are old enough to have an adult beverage is the law, Hasani's demeanor was less than pleasant. If he paid half as much attention to the bar it would have would have made sure the bar, plates, and silverware were cleaned before ""we got comfortable"" as well. I tried to engage in regular bar conversation but he was extremely short. Hasani could invest in improving his people skills just a tad more. I had more conversation with another bar patron than I did my own bartender. Aside from Hasani's attitude he did make a delicious mango perfect patron margarita! For my meal I had the Spicy Verde Nachos which were great as well but I would ask for an extra side of meat as well as cooking my jalapeños. After Hasani overheard me expressing my feelings about my visit he insisted that I speak to the manager. The manager, Frank, did make his way over about ten minutes later. Frank did offer to pick up the tab h/e I expressed that my food and drink was good it was the rude attitude of the bartender that left my friend and I very disappointed."
J L.,"Dumfries, VA",1,151,82,1.0,8/18/2016,"We tried again due to receiving what we thought was a good deal in the post.  Disappointment BIG TIME! We showed up at 11:27am.  NO BARTENDER!!  None of the taps were ready, nothing.  A young man at the door ran in the back and a guy in a red chef coat came out and started to serve us.  The bartender then came out and finished our pour, but after wiping his face on his hands.  The store manager didn't even show up until NOON.  Haywood introduced himself, gave us our beer and menus; then went into back again.  A man sat down close to us.  Haywood came out and spent the next 20 MINUTES talking to HIM!  Never once checked on us.  The picture I posted showed his position with his back to US (yes I know I take crappy photos, sorry). Haywood and this guy spoke about him going to UCLA or Chicago University taking a degree in psychology and how to pay for it.  Ya know, I'm glad he wants to better himself, but this is a conversation you have on YOUR time OUTSIDE of work!  Not DURING you shift while people are waiting to order. I FINALLY had to ask if he ""can you take our order now?""  Placed our order 2 apps, shrimp & avocado salad and 8oz sirloin medium-rare w/4cheese & mac and broccoli.  Hubby was getting ticked off at this point about the lack of interest from Haywood. We didn't get any napkins or our dinnerware UNTIL food came out.  When it came out I had my salad to go because he was starving and waited all morning for lunch at Applebees. He almost walked out because 1) if that was 8 oz then I'm a natural blonde and 2) the steak came out WELL DONE, but we couldn't find Haywood to return it.  He was getting lightheaded because he hadn't eaten since 2am (works graveyard).  His mac & cheese were not cooked thoroughly and this picture in the menu showed bacon on it but it came bland.  It  comes out of the BOX better than what was on the plate.  PLUS there was still melted plastic on his broccoli! Haywood then disappeared AGAIN and I had to almost YELL to get his attention to pay our bill.   COMPLETE and utter HORRIBLE lunch.  He didn't want to leave a tip, he just wanted to pay and walk out.  I tipped, but I'll be dammed if I EVER go back and I'll tell EVERYONE at MY BAR to avoid this location.   In the 4 years we've lived in Dumfries, this is the 4th or 5th time we've tried this location; even after the mass firing and ""re-training"" that was supposedly done at this location shows they truly need retraining!   Haywood, there are OTHERS at the bar and a bartender needs to check on them several times NOT when the food comes out and when we have to ASK to ORDER AND PAY!"
Scott H.,"Woodbridge, VA",10,11,3,2.0,3/5/2017,My fiancé and I stopped by on Saturday for a quick dinner... The service was fine but I had a couple other issues... first they have these electronic devices on the table and we played trivia to kill the time and was charged... Went back and saw the vet small print regarding charges... I am sure they get many complaints on this... I did not as I chalked it up to my lack of attention. My fiancé ordered a salad that she stated was very tasty! I ordered the Bourbon Chicken n Shrimp... The chicken and shrimp was good but the potatoes and onions were burnt from sitting in the skillet way too long... Probably the last time we will eat at Applebee's unless we have no other choice!
Jeremy M.,"Dumfries, VA",284,6,1,5.0,6/8/2016,Amazing! Applebee's has stepped it up. The new menu has so much to offer and looks good!
The Foodie ..,"Washington, DC",0,76,26,1.0,4/11/2017,"Horrible service. Party came in close to 10pm and had to wait a super long time for food. By the time all the food came out, majority of us had already eaten and was ready to go. Finally, some of the food that was ordered earlier came out. But the waiter asked if they wanted it to go. It seemed that we were being pushed to take things to go Friends had to keep asking for refills, that basically came after two or three times of asking. Some of the food came out undercooked. Bathrooms were disgusting.  People were at the bar super loud and yelling profanities. We probably would've been better going to IHOP. This Applebee's needs serious attention. We should've been guided by the ratings before going there."
Steve F.,"Dumfries, VA",0,10,1,3.0,9/23/2017,Me and the wife came for a late night app and drinks. She had the chicken wonton tacos and I had the steak wonton tacos. The first round the meat for both were ice cold. The bartender returned them and they were good!!! The bartender was okay and fixed the problem quickly!!!
Review G.,"Washington, DC",2,105,38,1.0,7/18/2016,We ordered 2 steak salads and 2 beers. Check came out to $45 with tip. Place was cold. We waited 25 min for the salad and it's something a 3 year old could of made in 5 minutes. They also gave only 4 to 5 pieces of meat that looked like it was already chewed by a rat! I will not be going back to this chain of restaurants.
Bil G.,"Dale City, VA",5,325,,1.0,12/4/2016,"Extremely slow in everything.  Took forever for them to make my cherry limeade.  Very tough steak with a lot of gristle.  They screwed up my soup, French onion, and had to remake it and it took forever.  I told the waiter I wanted the soup ahead of the steak and of course he brought both at the same time.  But he said this happened because they had to remake the soup.  The waiter was nice though he was slow but maybe it was more the kitchen's fault than his fault.  Between the poor quality steak and the VERY slow everything I won't return to that Applebees.  Horrible experience.  Oh yes, all their sides were potatoes, baked potato, mashed potatoes, french fries and sweet potato.  The alternatives were beans and broccoli.  No coke to drink only Pepsi products which I detest.  Of course if you sell Pepsi then you are supporting Pepsi's Yum Foods Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC."
MsLa H.,"Dumfries, VA",15,15,41,5.0,6/24/2016,They are so much better than they were in the past! Late night 1/2 appetizers! Good service!  Jafar gave us the best customer service! Courteous and on point for bringing us what we needed when we needed it! We had a lovely evening!
Ana M.,"Woodbridge, VA",42,2,,4.0,10/6/2016,"My family & I enjoy this Applebee's so much, all the waiter are eager to help and very prompt. One of the waiters even recommended such a great drink last time we visited. The hostess are also very nice and very accommodating considering I have an 18 month old. The food is always just as delicious as the last time and overall it's just a great place"
Christine M.,"Stafford, VA",0,14,,1.0,6/5/2017,I was so disappointed with this Applebee's. Our server was absolutely horrible. It took him forever to bring water and about 15 minutes for him to bring the drink from the bar. The drink was extremely watered down so he said he would bring another one. After 20 minutes I had to ask for the drink because it was so watered down and he never brought the replacement. He also messed up the order. He blamed it on his other tables ordering the same exact thing. By this point I was ready to go. I asked him for the check. 15 minutes later and asking him a few more times for the check he finally brought it and charged me for the drink he was supposed to replace! The restaurant was a mess too. There were chairs in the middle of the walkway so you couldn't get around. Plus the bathroom was a mess. I don't think I'll be back to this one.
Hedda C.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,40,47,1.0,10/23/2016,"Lesson learned ,  Never again to leave  any restaurants or any place without the  receipt especially if you pay cash like what I did . I went to Applebee's restaurant  , Dumfries , Va.,  last night friday night and ordered their Sir loin  with 2 sides , one french fries and the other potatoe with cheddar cheese  and bacon for take out . Again the meat was  real hard and still red in the insides.   The 2 sides were placed in one container . Unfortunately, I was not able to take picture of the food. Called in and spoke to the manager and complained . I mentioned to her that I paid cash.  And no receipt was given to me . Manager told me they do not make a refund for cash. Told me to call the GM the following day.  Called in today and spoke to the GM . Same answer , no refund for cash, ofcourse because I was not given a receipt."
Lumi N.,"Lorton, VA",4,6,,1.0,7/21/2015,"Horrible and will never go there again.  Every time I have visited the location there is very poor customer service.  There is usually no one at the front to seat you, once you do get seated, sometimes it takes 10-20 mins to get any attention from the waitress.  Even if you get their attention, it can take just as long for them to get your drinks out, including if you asked for a mere glass of water. Today I placed an online order around 2pm to avoid the terrible on site experience.  My husband went to pick up the order at 2:30pm and they said the order was non existent.  My husband called me to tell me this and I told him that I would forward him the confirmation email for the order.  He approached them again with this information and this time they said that they no longer served one of the sandwiches that I had ordered.  Okay, if that was the case then how come I never got a phone call or email requesting for me to update my order before they could proceed?  I was lucky that I did not pay for the order online.  I told my husband to cancel it and that we would get food from elsewhere.   I just tried to submit my complaint on their website but the site gave me an error.  Fix your damn website and update the content.  If you're no longer serving certain items, then you need to remove them.  If you don't update your site, then you better make sure that your employees are able to follow up with customers about it.  If you won't allow customers to submit complaints directly, then take out that feature and  put a disclosure that blatantly says ""We don't care about you, we just want your money despite our bad service."" Good riddance Dumfries Applebee's."
Wanda W.,"Woodbridge, VA",4,10,,4.0,8/1/2016,Great 'American Standard Burger and 'Quesadilla Burger'!  Love the Mexi-Ranch sauce.
Vasheka O.,"Tacoma, WA",100,6,,1.0,2/11/2016,Please fix your food service time. Came into restaurant with nobody in there and still had to wait over 45 minuted to get our food. Been waiting about 20 minutes after the long wait to get to go boxes......very disappointing. We will not be coming back!
Renee R.,"San Diego, CA",30,70,43,2.0,7/31/2015,By far the worst service I have experienced! The food was great that is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1. Would NEVER come back to this Applebee's ever again. I had to go grab someone to even find out who our waiter was and to order drinks. We had to wait for ever for every little thing we ordered. I wish I would have read the Yelp reviews before hand. Very disappointed.
Rodney M.,"Vienna, VA",149,4,,1.0,6/11/2016,"Worst service ever sat at the bar order a drink told the guy I wanted food his name was jermey order my food waited 15 mins ask him how long he said he forgot to put it in, this place is the worst never ever I mean ever go here again they don't care about there customers"
Eric B.,"Norfolk, VA",24,7,,1.0,4/25/2017,"My expectations for Applebees generally aren't super high: I expect decent food and service. In particular, when traveling for work I will often take advantage of the outside pick up option so that I can pick up food on the way back to my hotel as I can't go inside in uniform. I ordered food online to be delivered via Car side To Go on April 25th, to be ready at 6:15. I arrived at 6:10, and continued some work related phone calls while waiting for my food. At 6:33, I called and was told that the 'to go' server wasn't working, but the gentleman who answered the phone had noticed me waiting outside. He said he would grab my food and bring it out. At 6:54, I called again and this time spoke to someone who very helpfully brought the food out. From the temperature, it was clear it had been waiting since 6:15. Travis, who brought my food out, was very apologetic and offered to have it remade, but after waiting for 40 minutes I decided to just take it. No discount was offered. I will not be returning. Ironically, I was contemplating just leaving, but felt guilty about them making food that I was going to leave behind. Clearly they didn't have a similar concern about me."
Holly D.,"Woodbridge, VA",67,13,1,2.0,3/2/2016,"My waiter was super nice, but service was super slow. And they weren't even busy!  The menu left much to be desired. Bummer."
Joyce P.,"Dumfries, VA",6,3,1,1.0,7/15/2016,"I haven't been at an Applebee's in years and last night's experience reminds me why. When we got into the restaurant it was slow especially for a Thursday night. First, the host took their time to get to us. The server got to our table in a reasonable time and got our drink order and got it to the table in a reasonable time. Once we gave our server our order it took a very long time to get it. It would be understandable if it was busy but they were pretty slow. I'm not going to blame the server completely for that because that's the kitchen staff but she never came to our table for a very long period of time. We got our food and it was okay but we kinda expected that and the really the only reason why we went there was because I had a gift card that I've had for a while. When we finally got our check I give them my gift card along with the credit card. They couldn't get the gift card to work for a long time. They came back to the table and said they can't use the gift card after messing with it for over 15 minutes. I called the phone number on the gift card to check the balance which took 2 minutes and got the balance on the card. I told the server that there is a balance on the card why can't they just call the number and deduct the amount that's on the card. Finally the manager comes to our table and tells us that I would have to call the corporate office and get a new card issued to me...really! We are thinking we don't want to come back here to just to use the gift card again. I have never received such horrible customer service. My son is a server and had comp customers before with no issues but they didn't even offer that or anything. We were very disappointed with the customer service at this Applebee's!"
Christopher C.,"Woodbridge, VA",11,18,3,1.0,12/24/2015,"When we sat down to a sticky table for lunch today I suddenly remembered why I stayed away from Applebee's in the first place. After 15+ minutes to get our drinks we ordered our food, fried chicken tenders so over cooked they could be used as weapons, onion rings in much the same fashion. Their blackberry lemonade consists of a glass of Country Time pink lemonade with a shot of black/blue syrup lurking at the bottom. Kids pizza was a sandwich half slathered in Prego like sauce and something that closely resembled cheese. 50 bucks later I'm feeling robbed at overpriced food, filthy restaurant and  food. If you don't care what you eat for exorbitant amounts of money, this hole is the place for you. I will be staying away."
Jorge P.,"Dumfries, VA",1,19,13,1.0,9/21/2015,"I have been to plenty of Applebees in many states and this is by far one of the slowest and worst customer service location's I have ever seen at any restaurants. My family came before the normal dinner rush 530 to be exact to where the staff out numbers the customers, and still it is very slow. We have put our drink orders with two different staff members to still be asked by a third what we would like to drink. Ultimately the manger is responsible and you can only blame the managers I have no clue how a manager will and can allow such slow service when it is this slow. Needless to say we will never return and would encourage families that are not from here to try there hardest to find another location if possible."
Jessica J.,"Fredericksburg, VA",62,18,1,4.0,3/9/2016,"Was just here last night (Tuesday) with my dad for dinner. We had a good time & were not disappointed by the food. We ordered non-alcoholic drinks, two entrees, and one dessert and our total bill was only $40 (not bad). The food was ready fast and the waiter was courteous. The best part were the unlimited table games that we could play for $1.99 on the mini-iPad looking device that was at each table. We were pleasantly surprised that this Applebees wasn't as bad as some of the other reviews made it seem."
Lizvette M.,"Eureka, CA",28,8,14,1.0,1/18/2016,"Really bad Service.  No body at the front when we get there, we wait till some one came to make us sit.  50 MINUTES TO SERVE OUR TABLE when the restaurant was almost empty, on a Monday at 3pm."
Robert S.,"Dumfries, VA",16,18,,1.0,7/31/2015,"We chose Applebee's for a family dinner, because it was the only place open late, and our out-of-town family arrived late. There were only a few customers. The service was absolutely horrible. The waiter told us there was only one fryer working, and several of us had ordered fried appetizers. We had to ask another waiter to find our waiter to find out what happened! After about 1/2 hour, the appetizers came out. They were not bad. Then, the entrees came in a timely fashion. We asked for more water, and eventually the waiter brought refills. When one of our guests went to take a second sip from her glass of water, she noticed what she thought was a lemon seed in the glass. Upon closer inspection, she discovered it was a cockroach! The manager on duty took 20% off the check, plus $10. She said that was all she was authorized to do."
Jessica G.,"Hamilton, Canada",0,3,,5.0,7/16/2016,Applebee's has really changed they have new servers and new management. I was there yesterday and the place was busy the bar was packed and the place is a Poke'mon GO stop!! the are offering 10% off when you come in with the app on Fridays. the price is right and the staff is warm and friendly. i have found a new hangout spot. if your looking for a cool place to chill and have some drinks this the place to go.
Kevin S.,"Huntsville, TX",74,5,,1.0,7/8/2015,"Absolutely horrible service. Especially for ordering take out from them. I called and was put on hold for 5 minutes so I hung up and called again. I was put on hold for another 5 minutes. Hung up and called again, put on hold once again...so I called one last time and said I just want to let yall know I will never be coming in here or ordering from yall again. She didn't even seem to care or try to convince me otherwise. Terrible wait staff and lazy management letting this go on. I called ruby Tuesday right next to it and they picked up the phone immediately and took my order immediately. It's a shame because I like Applebee's but this must be a bad location. This review isn't even deserving of a star but you have to give it something."
Heidi F.,"Dumfries, VA",0,24,4,1.0,3/28/2015,Poor service. Completely inattentive waiter and staff. Cold food and the food tastes terrible. Dirty silverware. Drinks took forever to come out and never received a follow-up for refills. All around terrible place to eat.
Robert W.,"Dumfries, VA",0,1,,2.0,6/14/2016,Sitting here right now. Been here for a half hour. Had one drink very slowly. Still waiting for my food. Not many customers in here.
Sarah E.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,3,,2.0,11/6/2015,"I just signed up for a Yelp account for this review and this one only. I am visiting from NY and went here the first two nights because it was familiar.. We waited over 40 minutes for a brownie bite. You know, the 2 1/2 inch brownies with a teaspoon of ice cream?? Yeah, those.  The service was so terrible the manager offered us coupons to come back. We came back a few nights later to even worse service. We were there for over 2 hours waiting for food and checks. The waitress told us she didn't know we were waiting on our to-go order and that it was ready and in the window. 20 minutes later it was still was no where to be found. Additionally, we had our cards out ready to pay and she came back later saying ""oh, I never took these?."" NO you didn't! Needless to say from start to finish the service at this restaurant was anything but pleasing. Slow and sloppy service all the way around...."
Maria M.,"Woodbridge, VA",28,16,6,1.0,1/31/2015,"NASTY! Went with family for dinner. I had to ask for a glass of water to clean off the appetizer plates. They looked like they weren't even washed. Then our salads came out. I was appalled! Not one but all the plates had residue of old crusted food on them. The plates were not clean at all. We will never go back. I cancelled our order, paid for what we did eat and left. STAY AWAY"
Kisore A.,"Arlington, VA",2,2,1,3.0,7/3/2015,"I have been to Applebee's many times in the past but this was by far the worst. The service was horrible. We order the Ultimate trio for appetizer and two entrees. It took them 25 minutes to serve the appetizer and they gave us the entrees right after the appetizer. The appetizer tasted okay. You cannot expect great taste from frozen food. However, the entrees were horrible. They did not have any taste at all which we ended up not eating. Thankfully, they did not charge us for the entrees."
Alyce P.,"Montclair, VA",0,37,3,2.0,6/12/2015,"Food would have been pretty good if it hadn't been sitting too long in the back.  Our waiter was very nice but spent a lot of time in the bar area.  Place has a tired look, needs to be renovated.  Everyone is nice but they just seem to want to socialize with each other more then take of customers.   This is a lack of  training and management recognizing they have a problem and making the effort to turn this place around.  Must be contagious because Ruby Tuesday across from them has the same oroblems."
