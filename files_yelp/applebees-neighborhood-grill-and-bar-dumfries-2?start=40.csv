Hannah C.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,7,20,2.0,1/20/2015,"I came here on a Sunday night with a few friends while visiting the area. Two of my friends are from the area so they are used to the service here, and as most of us might realize at some point or another, Applebee's is nothing too grand or special. The drinks were good and are not overpriced. We got drink specials because of the NFL playoff game that was on and got half-priced appetizers as well. The only bummer to the night was the service. The bartender was pretty slow and didn't seem too bothered to speed up the service. We weren't approached by a server until about ten minutes after sitting, and were then told that he didn't know who our server was but he would take us. Not the greatest customer service, but I was looking for anything too special that night anyways. I've experienced better, but food and drinks were cheap so I can deal with the service."
Eddie C.,"Stafford, VA",0,1,,5.0,8/9/2015,"I've made two visits to the Apple Bees in the Stafford Va area, each of those visits I left unsatisfied,  mainly due to poor communication among the staff. The corrections to our meal and bill were made, but with a party of five everyone enjoyed there meal separately instead of together. Now the customer service at the Dumfries location, no complaints what so ever. We were able to sit where we wanted, the appetizers came out fresh and hot, the sodas we ordered weren't flat,  I really appreciated that the manager delivered the food to our table, and before leaving our table he made sure the steak was to our satisfaction. We arrived closer to the closing hour, with my mind already  in set for a rotten meal.  We ordered the steak, and completely forgot to mention no mushrooms when we placed the order, when the server came back around ( 5-10 minute time frame ) we asked for the correction to be made, there were no eyeball rolls or hot steam from under the breath, a polite No problem was given.  Boneless chicken strips Xtra hot sauce please, best yet, no fuss was made for asking for the Xtra sauce.  Thank you for the hassle free service."
Mare K.,"Vienna, VA",0,3,,1.0,3/28/2016,"Three strikes you're out. We heard there were new menu items and different promotions going on everyday of the week and we figure we see what it was all about. Well they say curiosity killed the cat and we'll this was the last straw and it totally killed my vibe of Applebee's. Again our server was great, food was ok. Loved the new double crunch wings, however my steak was over cooked and the parmesean made it very greasy. But that wasn't even the issue. There was a promotion going on, which was $2 domestic pints and more after 4 pm. So instead of a Bahama mama  I got a pint. When the bill came out they were regular priced, notified the server he apologized and said he would talk to the manager. Our server came back and said that because they were ordered before 9 it was not part of the promo.  Although it said nothing of the sort on the flyer. ""I said that makes no sense and that we didn't get our drinks till after 9"" if they wanted to be sticklers. He came back after asking the manager again in our view and he seemed so beat about what he was gonna come back to tell us. He then said he misunderstood what the manager said and that since it was after 9 pm it was not part of the promo. I said "" well technically we ordered our beers around 8:40 ish, but didn't get them till after 9pm"" he said oh. I said ""nevermind I'll just pay the bill"",  by this time I was done and ready to leave. The manager then decided to come up to the table and explain the promo and how in Maryland that promo can go till close but in Virginia it stops at 9 pm. I said ""it still makes no sense and if you want to be technical, our beers were ordered before 9pm. Also from my experience in restaurant management for 5 years, you are to honor the promo if the lack of info is wrong on the restaurant's side."" But whatever I'm just the customer right. Good thing I wasn't a secret shopper that evening or when they had a live DJ who was playing music with cuss words as my family and I ate dinner around 8 pm. Yes I believe I'm totally done with Applebee's."
Joel P.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",2,14,,1.0,2/6/2016,"This is a place to AVOID don't come here expecting a good service or good food. When we got there the host was on their business talking took awhile to notices we where there. We got seated at the bar when we never asked to be, because we where never asked where would you like to be seated. Well we settle for the bar, after a few minutes the ""waitress"" with a a horrible attitude ask what would I like to drink. He ask for ice tea, while she went to get the drinks he look at the menus. They where sticky and dirty looks like nobody had Cleaned them for days. After a long time the ""waitress"" came saying she had to make fresh ice tea that's why she took so long. While she was taking our order she took her phone right in front of us and checked it !!!!!!!. In front of me I had to pause after she put her phone back in her bag. Food came out, we didn't had enough napkins. We asked for more napkins, when she got back she literally dump them on top of our food. While she was checking her phone. She notice after a few seconds later. She try to find a place to place them. I just took them of her hand. We started eating.... Well not really food was cold and not good at all. He Just had a few wing and we couldn't eat no more we left knowing that we would never ever going back to this place. This place is horrible"
Daniell D.,"Fairfax, VA",0,11,,1.0,5/5/2015,Great food but it was the slowest service I've ever had. I am a waitress myself so I'm usually pretty understanding and lenient but it was ridiculous to see our waitress gabbing with the other waiters long before she actually put our order in. Then she didn't check back with us until we had finished our meal. I only saw the manager once in the hour and a half we were there and he was delivering food. I definitely wouldn't recommend going to that location.
Ayishah B.,"Dallas, TX",29,8,1,2.0,11/9/2014,The food was good but the customer service was lacking. I don't know if they were short staffed or not.  The place was very empty it had just opened up. There was no more than 3 different group of people and it took the waitress over 10 minutes to come take my order. There was no greeter at the front.
Angie G.,"Dumfries, VA",19,52,2,1.0,4/8/2013,"Avoid!  Dirty!  Rude!  Food was disgusting and not fresh at all!!   There's a Ruby Tuesday's next door, maybe try that instead."
Ashley H.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,1,,5.0,2/16/2016,I love their services. I always ask for Andrew.  He is very friendly and makes sure I have everything I asked for. Favorite place to eat
Amy G.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,4,,1.0,2/14/2015,"The place so doesn't even deserve a star. My husband and myself are currently dining here (valentine's day) as I wirte this review. This place is herrible!! It's not even busy and we've yet to have our food brought to us and we've been here here for about 45-50 mins. Our waitress has done nothing but complained about how doesn't have help, again it's not even busy. She rolls her eyes alot! Ahh just don't waste your time/ money at this location!!"
Raven T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",2,3,,1.0,10/18/2015,"By far the one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.  The bartender had a horrible attitude.  My drink had hair in it, and when she mixed it, she finger fucked my the shit out of my straw.  We were literally the only people in the restaurant it was 11 on the dot and the wait to be helped was ridiculous.  They really need to get their act together."
Drew M.,"Woodbridge, VA",33,2,,1.0,5/2/2014,"Service was bad, waiter clearly didn't want to be there. Lied and told us they had finished serving drinks yet I watched the bartender serve several after the fact"
Orlando C.,"Kaneohe, HI",0,4,,1.0,10/18/2015,"This restaurant does not seem as if they were worried about providing quality customer service; definitely not the Apple Bees I know. As we got in they sat us down and that was that. After about 8 minutes and several waiters passed by without asking whether we want to water anything, we decided that our business was not of value to them, so we walked out and not one person said anything as we begin to leave. There were 3 host just sitting buy the bar talking about non work related things. I wish that undercover bosses would visit thiis placed to see how their place of business is being managed; truly unprofessional."
Corliss G.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,15,,4.0,7/10/2015,"Omg. CHRIS is a great bartender and has great customer service, even though I didn't get drinks. I walked in wanting specifically a blondie..and made in a particular way. He nailed the directions. ... on top of that, a really nice couple paid for my ticket. Awesome spirits at this Applebee's today..  Glad I stopped  through."
Ronnie H.,"Woodbridge, VA",46,7,1,1.0,7/13/2013,"horrible service...poor communication. ..last time we'll be coming to this one...We asked the server if it was 50% appetizers after 9pm and he said yes.  We ordered our food and about 30 seconds before the food came out, he said, ""Just so we're clear, appetizers are not 50% off on Friday/Saturdays.  Not being an avid Applebee's customer, we were unaware of this.  So what we thought was going to be a $25 meal turned out to be a $60 meal.  The server said he could give us 15% off.  We asked for the manager and he was less helpful then the server.  We explained the situation to him, he was very insincere and said, ""let me see what I can do.""  He came back and offered us $19 dollars off, mabye 25% off.  He was cold and rude and never apologized.  We'll be taking our business elsewhere."
Vianca S.,"Springfield, VA",0,1,,1.0,9/30/2014,If I could give this place negative stars I would. I made a yelp account solely to write a review to warn you guys to NEVER COME HERE. I am not being overdramatic. Ive given this place multiple chances but the service is constantly wretched. Every time I've been here it has taken AT LEAST 10 mins to get my drinks. I can see the bartender hanging out with some of her friends instead of making my drinks. It's just awful. AWFUL!!! Don't waste your time or money.
Eric J.,"Pearland, TX",26,84,27,2.0,9/12/2012,"So it's a chain and you get what you get...  but something about this spot just ain't right.  I've been here a couple of times and the service always sucks.  It's like the staff is busy doing anything but waiting on the cutsomers.  When you do get service, they are courteous, and get your order correct; but I debate with myself over leaving a customary 15%.  No way they're ever seeing 20% out of me.  The food taste like every other Applebee's I've been to, and I don't go often, but it's just something about this place I can't put my finger on."
Gretchen J.,"Woodbridge, VA",6,21,4,1.0,5/10/2015,"Applebee's is not known as a great restaurant, but this one was especially bad. I needed a high chair, which the host knew, but i stood, at the table, waiting holding my hungry one year old for 10 minutes before someone came, and then I had to specify why I was still standing. We stopped to grab a ""quick"" bite because we had 4 hungry kids. I usually wipe the table with disposable wipes because my baby eats off the table- the table was so disturbingly dirty - Absolutely filthy- If the traffic hadn't been so bad, we would have walked out. The floor is so greasy it's slippery.  This place needs to be shut down. We actually had a great waiter- Travis, I think. He needed better training (like don't put anything in front of a baby, especially not drinks), but was a great guy. This place is WAY beneath him. Food was marginal at best. I couldn't eat my dinner bc it was so greasy, but the kids stuff was normal Applebee's quality. We waited 10 min for high chair, 20 min for dinner and 20 minutes for a check. OMG. Never again. I'm not sure we'll ever attempt an Applebee's again. . ."
Guy B.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,26,,1.0,2/24/2015,"This is our third and last time at this restaurant. In all fairness our first two visits were actually pretty good.  We were seated quickly  and within two minutes our waitress came to the table.  We ordered drinks and an appetizer.  Drinks came pretty fast the appetizer arrived a little later.  20 minutes later the waitress reappeared and asked if we were ready to order dinner. We were ready for some  refills on the drinks that's for sure.  We ordered two steak dinners and a burger. We asked for the steaks to be rare and medium rare respectively.  Twenty minutes later the steaks came out. One was on a sizzling platter really hot well done. The other on a warm platter cold on top. When the food was delivered our drink glasses were empty. No offer of a refill, waitress gone. She came back about ten minutes later to check if the meal was ok, and we asked for refills. She brought us the drinks and about 15 minutes later came back to check on us. We order a couple of the small sundaes. By then I actually put the stop watch on her and it took 13 minutes and 45 seconds to bring the dessert. If the place had been packed that would have been one thing. If the food was slowed down by the kitchen that would have been understandable, but when my sundae was delivered the ice cream was already completely melted! It had been sitting waiting for pickup long enough to melt."
Charlie R.,"Dumfries, VA",48,7,,4.0,8/4/2011,Something special about this applebees! The crowd that hangs out at this Applebee's are pretty cool. I always have a good time when I go. The staff is very friendly and the bar area is alot of fun. People are normally in there talking about all kinds of stuff and they definitley have their characters. I am a regular at this bar and have made alot of friends here.
Cadet B.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,8,,1.0,6/1/2011,The service was horrible. Our server forgot my water. Messed up my daughters order and took forever to get our drinks. Right after we received our food he brought the check so we felt rushed to leave. It was my sons birthday and our server never gave us the opportunity to get dessert so we could sing happy birthday. I was very disappointed and won't be back to this location again.
