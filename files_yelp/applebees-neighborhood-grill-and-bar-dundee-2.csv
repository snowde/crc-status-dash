Stacy R.,"Adrian, MI",0,1,,5.0,9/23/2017,Applebees in Dundee is one of my favorite places to eat.  Katie is an amazing bartender
M K.,"Dundee, MI",0,19,,3.0,1/1/2018,Went New Years Eve but it wasn't crazy busy.  Can only give 3 stars and that is being generous.   The waitress was a little flighty but nice and did try to keep up.  The meal was less than satisfactory.  Cold and undercooked steak.  We were afraid to send back as we noticed lots of food going back to the kitchen for a redo and we heard the manager comping two tables by us.  Good cooks must be hard to find these days.   The bartender was on point though with our drinks.
Susan M.,"Troy, MI",188,351,611,4.0,4/6/2017,"I think I should start rating places based on how many times they refill my Coke. The guy was really slow. It took him 20 minutes to get my first refill at 9:30 pm when the place wasn't busy. Then a woman took over and gave me a third and fourth refill within 10 minutes of each other. Yes, I was very thirsty from being at the waterpark, but there was also a lot of ice in the cup.  I had three kids with me and we arrived at 9:00 pm. There is a checkin offer for a free app on the Yelp app but I didn't use it because the pretzels with beer cheese and other apps were half off after 9:00 pm. The four pretzels were piping hot, but the cheese was room temp. The stone ground honey mustard was really good.  Two kids ordered chicken Mac n cheese with apple/yogurt; one kid ordered corn dog with applesauce. There are only refills on the soda and not the tangerine juice box or chocolate milk.  The Mac n cheese was pretty tasty. The kids thought there was too much chicken and not enough pasta.   I ordered the Thai chicken salad which was very fresh and tasty.  A huge portion for $10.  I get the bill and it's $20...the kids meals were all 99 cents (!!) which was a total surprise.  Overall, one of the better Applebees experiences."
Beth P.,"Ann Arbor, MI",0,3,1,5.0,10/25/2017,"This is a great place to come after work for cocktails. The Bartender, Danielle was fantastic... Fast and friendly. She offered up some food ideas and also some different cocktails! A good time!"
Lisa C.,"Tecumseh, MI",6,6,,5.0,9/19/2017,Our favorite spot! Great food even better service!! Love the pretzels and cheese and the burgers are to die for. Our son loves their Parmesan shrimp steak!
Bob F.,"Adrian, MI",0,2,,5.0,11/12/2017,There is a reason that this place is so popular. The food is tasty and the wait staff is one of the best. I enjoy hanging out here.
Sarah W.,"Dundee, MI",0,1,,5.0,9/19/2017,Great food and service.  Love the happy hour two times a day on the weekdays and the 2 for 20!!!
Steve K.,"Dearborn Heights, MI",2,14,2,2.0,4/16/2017,"Service was good. Steak was bad. Dry, tough and lacked flavor. I ended up covering it with A1. My other complaint is the fact that they have one of those electronic menus on the table with video games. My daughter had it less than 20 seconds (i quickly grabbed it out of her hands). She somehow racked up $2 in charges. Not horrible, but super annoying."
Kate B.,"Monroe, MI",101,737,1207,4.0,12/24/2015,"Bryanna was our server and she was fast, friendly and efficient. We tried the new menu items and enjoyed the stout sirloin and the chicken. Since we checked in on Yelp, we scored a free s'mores churros. Yay!"
Andrew C.,"Dundee, MI",99,6,,4.0,3/4/2017,Friendly wait staff and good food. Took a little bit to get it but otherwise everything was fine.
Kellie L.,"New Albany, OH",2,3,1,3.0,2/18/2016,"Green bean are yummy. Sat at the bar, great service. Bahama mama's are delish. Food was typical but all in all, a decent meal for the price."
Jim I.,"Dundee, MI",16,235,2469,4.0,8/19/2013,"No reviews here, huh?  Well ...it's your average Applebee's. decent food and service with an occasional screwup on an order. The menus are all the same. They do well here.  There are other places in town for the creative traveler with a little time to explore if your tired of the same old stuff. Face it Applebee's is everywhere and is a good fall back if an area  lacks.  This area does not.  Explore  Mex place downtown. Awesome pizza joint downtown. Great bar in the east side that serves food so  good you'll forget you're in a bar.  Thirstys?  Yea."
Ani J.,"Plymouth, MI",0,304,,2.0,2/1/2017,"hubby got the hamburger and said he could get one better at one of the famous burger joints.  at half the price.  they couldn't even put a slice of tomato and a lettuce leaf on the skimpy thing. i got the crispy chicken salad.  really seems all chicken is more porkish these days.  it was OK but i have had better. melissa was a fantastic waitress, probably the best i have ever had.  she should be working some place that would appreciate her more. with their food collection, there is no reason to return."
Stewart J.,"Toledo, OH",3,19,2,2.0,10/22/2014,"Sat at the bar, it had to be cleaned before I could sit down.  Menu offered a lot, but nothing that looked appetizing.  The bartender, Alyssa, was prompt to help me.  She even suggested the Quesadilla Burger, which I had. Nothing bad, but nothing special.  They forgot silverware when they brought it to me.  In general, what I expected from an Applebee's, middle of the road fare. 5 minutes later: Couple came in, to find food, dishes, and glasses all over the bar.  In one of their words, ""What the hell happened here?"" (See my photo for the wreckage on the bar.)"
Jeanny M.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",70,589,271,4.0,6/2/2014,"Had a late dinner here with a friend. We sat at the bar and ordered off the appetizers. Turns out they were half off since it was happy hour, score! The waitress was kind of slow, but I don't suppose we were in any rush.  I ordered the cheeseburger sliders. Three come to an order along with fries. There is a tangy mayo-based sauce that I asked for on the side, which was good for dipping my fries into. The slider bun was good, sometimes slider buns fall apart but these were substantial. The patty had plenty of flavor and was moist. The sauteed chopped onions added an extra level of flavor and texture. My friend had the wonton tacos and she enjoyed them. We were only there to eat our food before heading out, but it served its purpose."
Doug S.,"Dundee, MI",0,35,,5.0,5/12/2016,"Since my last review we have visited here 4 times!  2 times we had Sarah as our server and WOW! Amazing girl with a happy attitude and beautiful smile! Really great service and food quality spot on ! She suggested an appetizer and dessert , we ordered both! Thank you and your team  Sarah ! Happy servers make very happy customers! You have brought our faith back in the Applebees brand!  Time before was Ashley and again great service and great food! Thank you! Then we had Jake, what a polite young man! Great server that cares about his customers and the Applebee's brand! You just don't get this kind of service from many male servers, way to stand above Jake! THANK YOU!!"
Jen ..,"Milan, MI",0,58,2,3.0,5/10/2015,"Clean place, good food. Servers seem nice but do not refill drinks and only try to serve you when you are about to pay until then it's pretty hard to find someone or get any help.  Food is great, portions get smaller every time I come back. The last two times my server even stated my portion was clearly smaller then normal.  Deserts are really overpriced but you can save a lot with the 2 for $20-$25 meals for two."
Emily M.,"Ann Arbor, MI",0,9,,2.0,3/1/2014,"I have come here many times and the only thing that keeps me going back is the half off appetizers at night.  The service is generally slow. Whether it is crowded or busy, it takes quite awhile. We were there recently and it was just dirty inside. On the floor under our table were a few straw wrappers and crayons. There appeared to be pieces of food on the floor by the table."
Alex M.,"Arlington Heights, IL",3,9,,5.0,8/22/2015,"Would come back just to see Alyssa! You are wonderful good luck with everything! Oh...,and the pretzels are the best I have had :)"
Rachel C.,"Oceanside, CA",37,37,5,2.0,9/1/2014,"We seated right away to a dirty table. There was food left from the ppl before. service was a lil slow. Our waitress was Nancy F. She spilled my bf's Pepsi all over him n the seat. She apologized n sorta cleaned it up. While my bf was cleaning up the seat she asked if he'd like another Pepsi n some more napkins.. he said yes. She went to the back while we waited for the napkins to finish cleaning up the pepsi. We look where she was n she's back there talking to other servers n laughing... meanwhile, we are waiting to finish cleaning up her mess. Food was good.. when we were leaving we noticed ice still all over the floor. She needs to learn better customer service. We understand accidents happen, but she should have cleaned up HER mess, not us. Then we shouldn't have had to wait for her to have conversations to clean up after her.. very dissatisfied w her!"
Mark A.,"Ann Arbor Charter Township, MI",15,34,,2.0,8/5/2013,"I came here with a party of six on Sunday, August 4. There was no one inside to greet us, and we waited about five minutes before someone showed up. There was noone in front of us, but there was a couple sitting on the benches in the waiting area. There were a lot of empty tables. When an employee finally came to greet us, he asked us if we minded waiting five minutes. We said fine, and sat down. After 10 minutes, we discovered that we weren't waiting because the table wasn't available, but because the kitchen was backed up. So, instead of sitting us at a table where we could be drinking our beverages and waiting comfortably, we were waiting on the benches in the waiting area, because the kitchen was backed up? That's the most ridiculous thing I'd ever heard. My pregnant wife, who was thirsty, asked if we could be seated so that she could order a drink. They finally sat us, and the wait staff was great after that."
Geri F.,"Beaver County, UT",14,6,,5.0,1/2/2015,"Excellent staff, excellent food. Such a relief after several awful experiences in the area!"
Gordon B.,"Petersburg, MI",0,37,,4.0,10/6/2015,Always a decent meal at this family friendly chain. Even got a discounted appetizer for checking in via Yelp.
Jennifer S.,"Cranberry, PA",0,14,10,4.0,7/5/2015,My family reports their meals were delicious. The kids' steak was super juicy and the side salad was good too. My husband's bbq club was good and I enjoyed my chicken and portobellos. The chips and salsa were small with no refills. Our waitress was attentive. Walked here from Holiday Inn.
Shaun H.,"Wyandotte, MI",1,4,,1.0,3/7/2015,"I'm not saying it was my worst experience but on a Saturday night you would think they had their better staff working.  Fire the cooks and start from scratch if I ran that place.  My medium rare steak was ""knock the horns off and bring it to be mooing"" type deal.  My girlfriends medium steak was forgotten about on the grill I'm guessing because it was well done to say the least lol.  I don't complain much but Christ man come on."
Shannon N.,"Ypsilanti Township, MI",0,7,1,2.0,9/29/2014,"The service was good. We had the fried green beans as an app and the dish was good. I had the lemon parm shrimp which was supposed to have blackened shrimp, but no spice at all. There was just a dab of the lemon sauce--none on the plain white rice. My hubby had the shrimp scampi pasta and it was about flavorless. If you don't like flavor, eat here."
Andrea S.,"Howell, MI",49,37,48,1.0,8/27/2013,"My friend and I stopped here after a jaunt at Cabela's. whatever mystery dish it was supposed to be that we ordered, was nothing more than reheated leftovers with a lot of burnt garlic thrown in to disguise the original flavor. Pure trashy food. Food was horrible, but my main complaint, and the reason for this review, is what happened when we beginning to eat. we were sitting at the high-top tables near the bar, when what turned out to be the replacement cook coming on to duty, clocking in at the bar register, to our UTTER HORROR and AMAZEMENT, lifted her shirt, exposing her bra, and proceeded to apply her roll-on antiperspirant to her armpits, there in the dining room, six feet from us, in plain view! Her clothes were soiled and filthy, with either mud or cow manure on them as if she just walked in off a farm! We summoned the waitress to bring forth the manager immediately. He approached, and we reported what we had seen. He told us he was sorry, but tried to excuse her piggish behavior by saying that she worked in the ""back of the house"" and was the cook coming onto duty! Apparently that must mean she had never been around actual human beings or knew of social etiquette! I would have thought he would have fired her on the spot or at least send her home. For all you Dundee Applebee-lovers, if the cook is brazen enuff to stand there and be an unsanitary pig in broad daylight, how is she handling your food in the kitchen with no eyes on her?? We didn't bother finishing, we just paid and left. We went to McDonalds instead, cuz at least we know what to expect there."
