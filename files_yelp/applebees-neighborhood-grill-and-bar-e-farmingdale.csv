Jim D.,"Queens, NY",352,420,7517,4.0,10/27/2017,"Well Hey there Friends! .. How is Everyone doing on this Beautiful Week ending Friday?   Applebee's is one of those chain joints, like Friday's & Buffalo Wild Wings and Outback. All are a bit similar, but offer different experiences. I do not recommend going with any of these establishments during busy times. At times of lighter traffic, however they can be in ideal choice. I was very pleased with my visit this evening at Farmingdale's Applebee's, went with my friend and we sat at the bar. Thursday Night Football and Hockey were the events of the evening. For dinner, we decided to try the Applebees 2 for $20. This turned out to be a very good choicefor us. This meal can be upgraded for $3 extra to include spare ribs, which I did. All together, with the onion ring appetizer mac and cheese and baked potato/ bacon. I had a heck of a meal for 13 bucks.  Service was very fast. I never go to places like this when it's busy. My beer was cold and crisp and a chilled Pilsner. My spare rib and mac and cheese dinner with baked potato arrived in about 10 minutes. First up however were the onion rings, they came to the table in less than 5 minutes. The beer battered rings hot and crisp, quite good. My friends chicken tenders with fries were the average meal nothing to Crow about, but it's what he liked.   Our barmaid was very friendly and engaging. I like the way that this Applebee's has a HomeTown flavor to it, the decorations and interior appointments were really interesting and fun to look at. The wall scenes were personalized and customized with photos of the local school teams and familiar attractions in the local area. It certainly makes it more like you're at home when you're surrounded with the sites that you grew up with. I found this Applebee's a very nice cozy place to relax and enjoy the game and time with friends I was very pleased before our visit here and certainly will return again. Budget-wise, it was a little less than I spend at some other places. I'll be sure to return. JIM D."
John D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,24,2,1.0,7/21/2017,"I walked in with a Party of 5. The host and 2 other employees were standing at the front of the restaurant just hanging out and talking. Didn't acknowledge us until a few minutes after.  Very unprofessional At the very least say ""Hi, I'll be right with you"""
John O.,"Manhattan, NY",208,271,386,3.0,12/17/2017,I'm not sure why people are reading this applebee's very low I will settings places very clean the servers are very polite and quick to flee drinks the food is very fresh and full of flavor and the price points can't be beat.
Andrew C.,"Melville, NY",61,426,1250,3.0,8/27/2017,"This was the second time I have ever gone to an Applebee's. The restaurant was somewhat busy and the service was very attentive. Once again, our young guest dove into corn dogs while we shared a chicken salad. What I found interesting was that the restaurant had local school pictures of either sporting events or general events such as Hofstra, Plainview and Amityville."
Danielle R.,"Massapequa Park, NY",29,7,,1.0,11/8/2017,"I wouldn't advise you to go to here but if you do keep track of your receipts..i came here on Halloween with my family (6 total) it was busy so i can understand long wait for food, or drinks, even the dirty silverware we received..but when 1 of the 6 meals failed to even come out of the kitchen and our waiter; Mannie or Manny however the unbelievable horrific waiter spells it, was no where to be seen, everyone else was almost done eating when we FINALLY flagged him done, the so very rude waiter turns and snaps at us saying well why did you wait so long??! Are you kidding me, he then as flamboyantly as possible turns and throws his hands up we then dealt with the manager Jillian who was  Apologetic and all and almost excused his bad behavior because ""they were slammed that night"". We as a group decided NO tip seemed appropriate since he failed to be our waiter, at best he took the order AND THATS it, and even that he didn't do that correctly my food came out wrong. My sister just received her cc statement and it seems as though the horrific waiter decided to change the receipt and tip himself..The police will be called on this thief. Diners beware!!!!"
Joe M.,"Brooklyn, NY",184,25,10,2.0,7/22/2017,This has nothing to do with the food because it's Applebees and you know what you are going to get. This is about their dinner and a movie offer for 9 dollars at the movie theater across the road. Apparently you have to eat at Applebee's first to buy the tickets. But if you want to reserve your seats like we did you buy your tickets to get the best seats available. I feel like we got ripped off here because we were trying to save our seats. They need a better system like refunding the difference. Not fair!!!!!
Mike A.,"Hicksville, NY",0,40,1,1.0,6/20/2016,"I ordered the whiskey chicken with mashed potatoes. It didn't come with the advertised gravy. The chicken was dry and bland. The mashed potatoes were okay, but the dish was a big disappointment. Why can't they make their food look reasonably close to the picture in the menu!"
Steph P.,"Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, NY",78,33,21,3.0,8/21/2016,"Only good for a quick bite. We ordered finger food and regular drinks on a Sunday afternoon.  Our server was Jen (JLo). She was nice and straight to the point while checking on our table of 3 regularly. Considering that business was slow, it came as no surprise when I saw all of the waiters and waitresses pretty lax. At least they were catering to the customers."
Evelyn I.,"Amityville, NY",47,9,,3.0,12/27/2016,I went here for my little sisters birthday since she loves Applebee's and we just wanted to do something special for her. It was a big party. It was a party of 15. Wait time was pretty long took about an hour to sit us down. But the people who sat us down i don't know what their problem was but they kept giving us nasty attitudes. So we got our table but the good thing was The waitress we had was really nice. She did really well with our kids. And with the older people too. She was and enjoyment and brought us our food pretty quickly. Food tasted really good. It was well made. Bathrooms were ok. Decently cleaned.
Kori A.,"Deer Park, NY",9,141,15,1.0,11/28/2015,"Went yesterday and half of their menu wasn't in Stock or so to speak. Waitress was clearly irritated and the food was mediocre at best. My french onion soup was burnt. Trash, never again. *Edited to fix grammar"
A Felice B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,41,1,5.0,4/30/2017,Never had a problem here. The food is always good and never had a problem with the service either. Recommend the BBQ ribs and garlic mash
Lucy J.,"Huntington Station, NY",0,1,,1.0,6/6/2016,"FOOD POISONED....My 16 year old son went to the Applebee's in Farmingdale, NY on Friday, June 3rd, 2016 with a few friends and got food poisoning. He ordered the boneless chicken wings and he bit into one that was ice cold. When he cut it open it was completely RAW.   He showed it to his server and he was told ...""So what the hell do you want me to do about it""  My son was in shock, that this is the way he was being treated. He never got the servers name but he was bald with a beard and on the shorter side.  A few hours after he got home, he became very ill and threw up for hours. He was sick with food poisoning.  Do yourselves a favor and BEWRE of eating at this location!"
Philip C.,"Massapequa Park, NY",27,25,8,5.0,2/14/2016,Nothing much to be expected from an Applebee's. Pretty my the same as all the others. Prices are fair and can be cheap by ordering the two for deals. The food is alright but for these type of chains aren't bad. For something fast and cheap and with a lot of people this is the place to be.
Marc'Violet P.,"Wyandanch, NY",0,9,5,5.0,11/20/2016,"Much better than the one near the mall. Food is always fresh. Service great. I had a problem with my food once, burger was dry, the waitress immediately took it back to the cook and brought out a fresh one. They were also packed so it was understandable."
Tashanna J.,"JAMAICA, NY",20,76,24,1.0,2/12/2015,"The service here was extremely slow, considering the fact that this establishment was very empty. Everyone at my table had a problem with their meal including myself, which was burnt nachos and being told by the waitress that they had to be burnt to get the cheese melted. REALLY? Never again."
Michelle L.,"Levittown, NY",0,2,,1.0,3/4/2017,"I went in to the Applebee's located in airport plaza tonight 3/4/17 after a movie at around ~10:20 pm. I am aware that it is half off apps and often hectic but, upon my arrivial I was greeted at the hostess stand by the manager, Starr, she was INCREDIBLY rude to me. After taking my name (with an attitude) she then proceeded to run over and yell at her waitresses in front of her waiting guests. I understand she may have been stressed however, she is the MANAGER not a hostess and one would think she knows the importance of keeping a calm demeanor in the presence of her guests. I then watched her yell to the other patrons in an unprofessional manner that their table was ready.  She is in the FRONT OF THE HOUSE position on a busy Saturday night when there are other various options all over RT 110 offering similar late night meal options. I will not return to this establishment and hope others will choose elsewhere as well."
Kelli S.,"West Babylon, NY",171,43,4,2.0,12/28/2015,"Went for my birthday with a small group of people. The food and drinks were good but the service was horrendous. Our waiter, nick, didn't come to check up on us at all. We found ourselves waiting for refills and more food but no waiter in sight (keep in mind it wasn't that busy). Then they told him it was my birthday when it turned midnight and ordered some churros. He did not say happy birthday and also didn't take it upon himself to gather the crew to come out and sing. We grabbed a different waiter, Shamus, who my brother asked to get people to sing and he promised they would come right out and he too failed to make it happen. Extremely rude thing to do on someone's birthday, no matter how much we all hate being sang to at a restaurant, it's part of the gig. I'll be going to other local Applebee's where they are more attentive."
Beena P.,"Roslyn, NY",1,31,13,2.0,7/1/2015,"I'm going to keep it pretty simple. What I hate about this applebees? Random pieces of meat where it shouldn't be, dirty silverware, attitude from the servers... The food always seems to be good but the overall environment is terrible.  Please avoid. Never again."
Jo B.,"Melville, NY",4,19,2,1.0,9/7/2015,"I went for a birthday dinner for my fiancé and his work friends in hopes we could have a few quick drinks and a bite to eat before swinging by Main Street to continue the festivities. Boy, was I wrong! I've been to this Applebees during the work week and we had prompt service. I guess that only applies to Monday-Friday for the lunch crowd. We checked in for a table for seven people and had to wait a few minutes for the table to cleared to eat. It was 9 pm at this point and the restaurant was pretty quiet so I wasn't really annoyed. As we waited for our party to join us, the server made a few passes to make refills of sugar packets and new ketchup. She seemed like she was impatient to get us started. As everyone showed up and people started deciding on their alcoholic beverage of choice, she seemed to nearly question whether someone of age was in the party. I ordered a margarita which came with an olive in the glass and was tinted green in color. I barely finished one glass but I was expecting something better than I was expecting. This particular waitress apparently had an issue handling a large table and gave us an attitude  before passing us off to another waitress who had way too many tables. I'm not blaming our second waitress as she was covering too much space to be effective. Our table wasn't cleared after dessert was brought out and it was littered with glasses and plates making it ineffective to eat off. At some point, the bartender had to bring our second round out because our waitress couldn't keep up. I ate so little because I was turned off by the service and wasn't sure if I was actually going to have any food. It took us 45 minutes to get the check split up and paid for and we had to give it to another server because she literally vanished. All in all, I didn't get to visit Main Street because a little over 2 hours for some apps, drinks and dessert was a little much. I'm not going to be coming back to this place after that."
Michael W.,"Lindenhurst, NY",0,9,,1.0,7/11/2016,Went with a colleague for lunch.  Walked through the door and it wasn't exceptionally busy.  Three separate employees looked at us from across the room but didn't greet us or seat us. Waited a little longer; nothing. Walked out.  Really bad.
Para N.,"Islip Terrace, NY",10,62,1,2.0,12/30/2014,"It is still Applebees. The salmon tasted like it was: Just defrosted and reheated. Greasy, slithering fries. The deserts, hey, not that bad. They were frozen ice cream type cakes, so what could go wrong? The staff serving really tries and is nice enough. Good tea. Again. What can go wrong? You go here to drink beer and other alcohol concoctions to the point where you don't care what you are eating. It is Applebees. What do you expect? Go here to meet groups of people for the convenience. That is about it. It is Applebees..."
January D.,"Long Island, NY",0,9,,1.0,6/2/2015,"Never again.  Worst burger ever.  They left the bacon & the pickles off & gave me charred, burned pieces of onion.  It sucked.  The other sandwich in the order was missing  pulled pork, which is basically the main meat of the sandwich. I called to speak to the manager & he had the audacity to laugh when I asked for a credit. He should've offered it.  What a disgusting experience. I will never go to this or probably any other Applebee's after this.  I think their days are numbered, if this is how they conduct business.  They suck!!"
Kenya F.,"Massapequa, NY",17,31,118,1.0,4/10/2015,"Came here tonight at 10 for half off apps. There was traffic by the greeter booth and a lot of noise, the greeter asked for my name and how many I told him Kenya and 2. As I'm sitting waiting I noticed people who came after me were already being seated. So I approached the greeter's booth and asked him if he had my name correctly, he said no there's no Kenya here and just shook his head after I waited 25 minutes. This is ridiculous.. you don't shake your head in agreement as if you got my name and everything is good but don't even have my name on the list. I told him I've been waiting for 25 minutes already and he said ""well you're going to have wait longer now, about another 15 minutes "" which is complete BS when five people who came after me were already seated. They honestly need to work on their customer service. I know it's cheap American food, but still there's no excuse."
Matthew R.,"Maspeth, Queens, NY",46,364,4,3.0,5/6/2014,"Your typical Applebee's. Place is kept clean, service was good, and the food was what you expected. One surprise was the portabello mushroom that came with the steak. It was great. I ordered the steak medium rare and that's what I got. The wedge salad could have had a bit more dressing on it. The strawberry in the frozen strawberry lemonade was a bit too artificial tasting. An acceptable experience overall."
Jay P.,"West Babylon, NY",1,17,18,1.0,1/19/2014,"This Applebee's maybe in a some what nice area sort of speak... This was my 2nd time coming here. The 1st time I had a bad experience food tasted old and the service wasn't pleasant. This time I decided to give it one more chance. The wings were over fried and black looking (felt like biting into pork rinds), the black n blue burger (was supposed to be well done) came back bloody, most the French fries were the hard over fried bottom of the fryer fries, the chicken tenders for my child were 90% extra hard breading and 10% chicken(so it felt like biting into an ice sculpture). FYI: I don't ever send my food back to the kitchen or complain in person, because they are still handling my food.  As of the service the girl was pretty fast   But when I asked for napkins being that I was there with my child she gives me 2 pieces of napkin as if they were coming out of her paycheck. I believe I gave it a fair chance and it's definitely not a good place to go eat. Every time my family and I choose to go to Applebee's on Sunday, the whole staff looks zombie'd out and un bath  from the night before.  That being said, don't  come here not even for a drink."
Eva P.,"Syosset, NY",0,10,2,1.0,2/18/2015,"If I could rate this no stars, I definitely would. When we got there the waitress asked us right away what we wanted,meanwhile, we had just sat at the table. The soda was disgusting and tasted flat as ever. So I got the 2 for $20 and we got a side of onion rings, which were way too greasy and tasted so fake, then I got a chicken tender platter. NEVER EVER get those. The cole slaw was disgusting, and the chicken tenders and fries tasted so fake even freezer fries and tenders taste better then that. So when this waitress gave us our check, she instantly added gratitude for 2 people as a ten dollar tip. As much as I wanted to yell at the girl so bad for that I felt so nauseous from their food I left. Thanks so much for the horrible experience. I used to love going to Applebee's, but after what the waitress did with the check and the nasty food, I'm never going there again."
Joseph S.,"Lindenhurst, NY",3,5,,2.0,12/27/2013,The service was very crappy and the food took forever and shit brother so man I would definitely not recommend going to this specific  establishment
Jennifer R.,"CORONA, NY",3,16,43,4.0,2/3/2015,"I frequently go to this particular applebees. The people are nice. The food always comes quickly. I never had any issues with the food, it's always cooked properly.  For half off apetizer it's usually busier but that's expected."
Sam O.,"New Hyde Park, NY",1,1,1,5.0,4/15/2015,"Been awhile haven't visit this Applebee（2BB unable seat in a public restaurant),we run in a perfect quiet afternoon break(around 3),service was nice.A pleasure meat with my wife n son(2 years old),exspecailly the new Kobe meat ball was fantastic!!spicy n heavy pepper herb flavor melted into ur mouth. 9oz Medium rare Sirloin was juicy  n tender,I bet they have a better preparing recipe or kitchen staff than 2years ago!! Thump up!!5 stars."
Mike B.,"West Babylon, NY",7,64,1,1.0,9/4/2014,Slowest service I've ever encountered at applebees.  This location can't handle getting crowded and can't function when it's busy.  Never going back here.
Andy S.,"Farmingdale, NY",1,9,1,3.0,2/24/2015,"What can I say, I love this place !!!  Food is usually good but the drinks are great."
Fae O.,"Bronx, NY",7,12,,5.0,10/18/2014,They were very fast at seating is even though there was a long line and our server justin was really awesome and super helpful!
Jenna E.,"Seattle, WA",46,92,109,3.0,9/4/2014,I never know whether I'm going to get good service or the slowest service at an Applebees.  This time it was on the slower side.  It took a while for my drink to even be brought out and even longer for my simple salad.  It was a late lunch so there weren't many people in there waiting to be served.  The new Fiesta Chopped Chicken Salad is pretty good though.
Robert Z.,"Farmingdale, NY",0,5,,3.0,2/18/2015,"My family have been here many times, good food selections and perfect for late dinner. The only thing that's bad is the waiting time, the shortest waiting time is 15-20 mins to get the table plus cooking time depending on length of food orders, otherwise it's ok."
Oscar Q.,"Garden City, NY",1,11,,2.0,11/8/2013,"I've never been overly impressed with Applebee's, but overall, it's okay for sandwiches and drinks.  On my last visit, I noticed a couple of things that annoyed me.   I was with a friend, and after I had taken one bite of my sandwich, our server came up to us and asked ""How is everything?""  Uh, I think it would make more sense to give us a little more time to form an opinion.  Exactly five minutes into our meal, the manager stopped by to check on us too.  Wow, they must really care.  But, seriously, two interruptions, minutes apart?   My friend finished with his meal first, and the server removed his plate.  I wasn't done quite yet.  A few minutes later, she returned, and as I put part of my sandwich down, she began to remove my plate.  Geez, were they in that much of a hurry to seat other customers?  I felt rushed and uncomfortable.  I politely told her that I wasn't done.   My recommendation to the servers and management is that they allow a little more time before checking up on customers, and that they use discretion when encouraging customers to finish up and leave."
Kay K.,"Atlanta, GA",2,12,3,2.0,1/18/2014,The waitress was nice But the lemon pepper shrimp or whatever the craps it is step like play doh .....the appetizers along with the brew pretzels taste good along with the boneless chicken. ..overall I WILL NOT COME BACK! !!!!
Lesley O.,"East Meadow, NY",1441,604,1483,1.0,2/2/2014,"I honestly can't believe how busy this place is considering how bad the food & service is!! Most definitely not my choice coming here but I went with it...ugh. I decided to get a burger because let's face it, how can you screw up a burger & fries? Well, the fries were way too salty & overly seasoned & worst of all, ice cold. Great. The burger, which I asked to be cooked at a medium temperature was well done & also very salty. I really hate when food is way too salty. The service was the worst. It took forever to be greeted, to be served the food & to be asked how everything is. I needed a drink for at least 10 minutes before I finally tracked down someone to get it for me. Finally, we had to wait for the check for what seemed like 15 minutes at least. Thankfully, as the server tried to walk away upon dropping the check, we stopped her & told her, ""No, take the payment now please!"" Thank God she ran the card quickly because we were itching to get the hell out of there!"
Michele A.,"Bellmore, NY",0,17,,2.0,9/6/2014,"When the hostess went to seat us, I asked for a gluten free menu for me and my husband. She said the server would bring it to us. When the server took our drink order I asked her for the menu. She said she would bring it. Ten minutour drinks arrived, no menu. I asked her again for the gf menu and she nastily said she knows. Five minutes later she dumps a binder in front of me. I had to flip through the sticky pages for the gf section. We finally ordered at least 20 minutes after we were seated. My husbands salad was extremely small and mine was spicy.  As we were leaving the server apologized."
Chelsea C.,"Syosset, NY",9,12,,2.0,6/21/2014,"I usually like applebees for a quick bite after I get out of work but I will never be coming to this one again.  We decided to go yesterday to get a bite and some drinks after I got out of work, and the place was PACKED. They said 20 minutes to seat two people but it turned out to be more than that.  Dinner was good, typical applebees food but the service was SLOW as anything. We asked three people and it took us over 40 minutes to get the check after we were done eating. It honestly seemed like the server was actively avoiding us.  I think this location has issues handling when it's packed."
Eve C.,"Oceanside, NY",90,58,7,1.0,12/5/2010,I want to start out by saying that I've eaten at other Applebees with positive outcomes so this review is only a  reflection of this location.  At first the service was good: pretty soon after we were seated the waitress came and took our drink orders and the drinks came pretty quickly. The food on the other hand seemed to take a bit longer than usual. But we didn't see the waitress at all until the food arrived.  2 out of the 3 steaks at our table were cooked improperly; mine wasn't even edible. I've never had worse cooked steak in my life. I think the waitress stopped by once while we were eating to check up on us and then took 20 min to get my soda refill after asking for it twice.  Needless to say I will never eat here again.
