Laura C.,"Farmingdale, NY",33,97,,3.0,10/21/2012,"Ah, Applebee's! We have all been there at one point or another, so why bother with a review?  Well, my local one deserves a shout -out because they run a tight ship there.  Service is generally good there and things run smoothly.  A current special worth mentioning is half-price appetizers on Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays after 8 pm during Football season.  Three delightful little sliders, with fries is one of those choices which is only $4.50 with this special.  Not too shabby! Big ol' basket of the boneless wings was I believe $ 5.  The only app not in this special was the sampler platter.  But no need to order that because you can go nuts with your pals and get a bunch of apps for that price! There are 2-fer drink specials as well.  Hey, sometimes you don't wanna watch the games at home, no?"
Jay M.,"New York, NY",34,192,99,3.0,8/12/2010,"I've been here a few times.  Let me start off by saying they are always crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, especially since the movie theater is right there.   They offer 1/2 price appetizers every night after 10pm, which is a good deal. Overall, the food here is decent for a chain restaurant.  The burgers and sandwhiches are good.  I wouldn't recommend getting the steak, it is usually cooked incorrectly and not a good quality steak either.  Also, I'm not a fan of the riblets, but I know of other people that do enjoy them, so to each his own.  Service is ok, usually better when it's not crowded."
Robert A.,"Syosset, NY",2,48,5,3.0,2/3/2013,"Went there own Saturday night around 6 pm. The joint was jumping. Rather than wait for a table, we opted to sit at the bar.  We were served right away. Let's face it, Applebee's is not gourmet food, but if you are looking for something quick and inexpensive, this is the place to go."

Larry B.,"Farmingdale, NY",113,325,9,1.0,7/29/2012,"no different than any other applebee's location - bland cookie cutter food that i could easily get from the frozen food section of stop & shop...on second thought that stuff might be better, and I certainly wouldn't have the nightmares this parking lot delivers"
Michelle S.,"San Diego, CA",44,119,1,2.0,1/20/2009,I went here tonight for the first time for half o appetizers. The service SUCKED.  We waited a while to get our drinks they finally came and you could tell the beer was sitting because all the foam was down.  My friend ordered a drink he never got.  Food took a while. The food was alright.  I don't know if it was worth the wait. It could have been a bad night.  I would have gone to a more local spot if I could have redone the night.
Dave N.,"Great Neck, NY",79,290,,3.0,2/7/2011,"If you've been to one Applebee's, you've been to them all. Good, but extremely unhealthy food, and just okay service. Boneless wings are great as are the new wonton pork tacos.  Twofers are a pretty sweet deal, but it feels like they don't have half the beers on the menu."
