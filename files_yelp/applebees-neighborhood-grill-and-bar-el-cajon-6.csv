Derrell D.,"San Diego, CA",47,34,139,5.0,12/9/2017,Great times. I need to come here more often. Great did & service. Good size portion of food. Friendly service with a great staff. I'll be coming back soon!!! Thanks Applebee's. Your awesome food & staff will keep me coming back!!
Katie G.,"El Cajon, San Diego, CA",453,291,773,3.0,9/20/2017,"Go here for the drinks and friendly service not the food .  We had the boneless buffalo wings and cheese sticks for appetizers . Those were good . But the chicken tenders and fries were pretty bad . The chicken tenders were over cooked making them hard . We also ordered the half rack of Bbq ribs and onion rings . The rings were good , but the ribs were so over cooked they were gross . I've never had ribs that bad .  This was not the first time the food was not satisfactory . I've dined here many times over the years .  All the drinks I've had here are always really good and a good price and the service is always good . I recommend drinks and apps only . Not the entrées."
April N.,"San Diego, CA",188,136,69,5.0,1/8/2018,I haven't been here YEARS! My mom and I just randomly picked this place for dinner last night and we were pretty pleased! My mom and I bought loved our food! We just did the 2 for $20 deal and it was perfect!!! Our waitress Vanessa was super friendly! We didn't wait long for our food! The brownie bite was thee perfect amount of dessert! I'm glad this place is still as great I remembered!
Julia V.,"La Mesa, CA",133,3,1,5.0,12/1/2017,"I was honestly thoroughly impressed with the pepper crusted sirloin & whole grains entitled with hearty grains, basaltic mushrooms, roasted grape tomatoes, onions and fresh sautéed spinach. I was really worried about coming to an Applebees which I haven't been in what seems like ages, because many of the options are hard to tailor to my diet and necessary portion size. I felt that this dish was spectacular in flavor, ingredients, texture, as well and the juiciness of the steak. I will definitely be coming back fin r this dish and I hope you do too"
Ashea M.,"San Diego, CA",231,47,185,5.0,10/7/2017,Our server Catlyin  was wonderful. It was busy for a Saturday night but they had a special for 1$ Margaritas. Food was hot and delicious no complaints really. I appreciate good service and flavorful food. I will be back to this location
David P.,"El Cajon, CA",9,73,75,5.0,2/23/2017,"Angela is amazing  , the manager it's amazing thank you Apple Bee it was awesome keep up the great work I love the customer service is the best the food was good the appetizer was the bomb"
Jeffrey C.,"La Mesa, CA",1,11,,3.0,11/23/2017,"We were immediately greeted and seated. Service was friendly and timely. As far as the food, it's on the level of a TV dinner. To it's credit, a better TV dinner like a Stouffers.  We had the 2 for 25 deal. The appetizer was the chicken strips. Portion: Decent. Taste: 5 1/2. Deep fried to a crisp. It came with ranch dressing that lacked flavor. It's obviously the cheap version. I had the 1/2 rack of ribs. It seemed overdone from the day before. Where do they get such small ribs? I know I can't find these in any supermarket this small. Must come from a small ranch. Portion: Small(est) Taste: 5 Sides: Fries and broccoli. Fries were average. The broccoli had good flavor. My guest had the chicken and 3-cheese Mac. The chicken came in strips that were deep fried. I know they stole them from the appetizer counter. As for the Mac, I swear they left off one or two of the three cheeses. Dryer side. Lacked any type of creaminess and flavor. No sides came with this dish. Taste: 4 Add ons: 2 bowls of French onion soup. First off, why are bowls the size of cups these days? Five bucks. Portion: Small. Taste: 4.5 Bill with tip: $41.00 Value: Poor. You will not leave here and say, ""Now that was a great meal!"". Unless you're a manager, employee, you got a comp so you lied, an investor, the landlord, or think that McDonalds is a family owned sit down restaurant.  Hey Applebees! Try eating your own food. Then hire a top rated chef to redo your recipes. Then you might stay in business for another year."
Charles T.,"El Cajon, CA",91,5,1,2.0,11/18/2017,We were a party of 10. The food was great for everyone. No complaints. There was a problem with the drinks we ordered and the final check.
Blanca T.,"Murrieta, CA",81,2,,1.0,10/5/2017,We waited 2 hours for food. Manager finally came with only half of our order. We told him that we wanted to leave and he quickly took back the food offered no apology and left. We asked our server for our receipt to pay for our drinks and appetizers. She didn't bother to offer any sort of compensation for the wait only a half-hearted apology. We paid our tab and left to Five Guys and only waited 5 minutes for our food.
Joe M.,"El Cajon, CA",28,61,,5.0,9/29/2017,"We were out of new places to go, or where we weren't tired of.  Sis suggested Applebees.  I had been there a month before but I thought my good food and service was part of a druncken buzz.  But we went again and the food was great!"
Frank F.,"El Cajon, CA",0,22,,4.0,10/24/2017,Good solid food menu and excellent deserts. Wait staff is attentive and the food comes in a reasonable time even when crowded.
Katrina A.,"San Diego, CA",261,77,241,4.0,11/22/2016,"Every time were in El Cajon We meet up with our friend and we eat dinner. That's our thing. That's what we do so we always think of somewhere to eat when we meet up. This time around we were near Parkway Plaza Mall so we yelped what's near here and brought us to Applebees.  It was super packed in the lobby on a Saturday night around 6pm, Duh what'd we expect? Although we got seated pretty quickly. 3 adults one booster seat and a highchair to put a baby in a baby seat in. We were comfortable.  There's plenty to choose in the menu and if you're like me you'll probably have about 3 options. Right now looking at the lighter side* I got the bourbon Chicken and Shrimp with mushrooms and caramelized onions. Delightful and satisfying! Chicken wasn't all dry or anything. My boy got a burger with fries and when he got his plate he goes ""That's all the fires I get"" I guess it was a small portion because he was still hungry by the time his plate was finished.  Our 4 year old friend got 3 mozzarella sticks and one hamburger and we picked at her mozzarella sticks because took her all of eternity to eat her hamburger.  Our friend Got the steak with broccoli and mashed potatoes and look do we have here a free side of macaroni and cheese with sprinkles of bacon bites because they got her order wrong.  My friends had food coma. Me? I was perfect."
Jason M.,"El Cajon, CA",62,1,18,4.0,10/5/2017,"We keep coming back to this place because of the service, excellent every time.... food is above average."
S. G.,"San Diego, CA",5,48,6,2.0,9/15/2017,"Our server was nice. The food was quick but somewhat flavorless. We bought the two for $20 and then spent $30 in alcohol (mixed drinks were somewhat watered down). The credit card machine went down and everyone was freaking out. I was over all of it and used the ATM outside across the parking lot. $5 dollar fee from the bank and probably more fees from my bank.  This credit card situation was completely managed incorrectly.  Even though my server was nice, we will not return. Too much drama for a date night without the kids. Wasted Night at Applebee's"
Kayla R.,"El Cajon, CA",1,8,4,3.0,9/17/2017,"Food is good. But we came here to watch the Seahawks game. We walked in and they only had 1 game on(LA Chargers). We asked the waitress if they would be putting the Seahawks game on at least 1 of there many tvs...but the answer was no. They advertise happy hour for football Sunday, to me that means all teams... won't be coming here again to watch football."
Kirby T.,"Irvine, CA",348,14,,2.0,8/29/2017,"I was here last night and the service was horrible. Our server Jennifer was awful. She took our order, checked on us once, and then never came back. I had to go find her to even get a box for our food. I wanted to order more drinks and food too, but decided not to because of the service. A+ to the bartender though because he made an awesome Long Island and he is the only reason for this even two start review."
Menas L.,"Bostonia, San Diego, CA",180,30,3,5.0,8/3/2017,Love coming to this place either with my wife or my family. They have great happy hour deals and their food is amazing. Customer service is also good. Great atmosphere also a great place to come and have some dinner also some brew. They also have great tasting cocktails especially the mojito.
Fedel K.,"El Cajon, CA",0,21,1,5.0,11/12/2017,"I came here with my family for my brothers birthday and everything was great! Our server, Corey was amazing he was very nice and helpful. He really made it an enjoyable experience. I highly recommend this place!"
Chrissy J.,"San Diego, CA",62,20,3,5.0,8/3/2017,My boyfriend and I came here and the food was very good. The best Applebee's in San Diego I've had.
Tweety B.,"Spring Valley, CA",20,84,6,1.0,1/13/2017,Sat us right away in the bar ordered appetizer which came 5 minutes before our waters did. Ordered a drink that came even longer. Went to order another drink at the bar since never saw our waiter which I guess ur not suppose to do cause someone came over to tell us ur suppose to reorder off there table machine .. No customer service at all!!!!
Jared O.,"La Mesa, San Diego, CA",0,5,1,1.0,7/31/2017,This review is mainly on the staff that Applebee's hires to answer the phones and take online orders. I always try and take advantage of online ordering after a busy day of work. But my last 2 experiences with this location is just enough. Every time I call multiple women who answer the phone never know the menu put me on hold sometimes I've had it to where I've got hung up on. The last 2 times I've ordered food and it was brought out to me it was wrong and not even close to what I ordered. It's just a waste of time for me and restaurant when people answering the phones have no clue on what they are doing. Bottom line is food has always tasted good here but service wise has been garbage and honestly I don't even feel like coming here anymore because of it.
George E.,"Chula Vista, CA",105,219,849,5.0,11/12/2016,"I came to this Applebee's for the free Veterans Day Dinner on the invitation of fellow Veterans. I must say It far exceeded my experience of the Applebee's on Palomar in Chula Vista.  It was a very busy night.We arrived at 8pm. We were seated promptly. Raylee was our server. She was very attentive. More so than any Applebee's server.  She was friendly and I could tell that she genuinely cared about us. She thanked us for our service  and she was sincere about it. Not a mere Thank you  because she happened to be scheduled on Veterens Day. They offered about a half dozen choices on a special Veteran's menu. I chose the Butchers Meat and Potatoes. What it lacked in quantity it made up in quality. I have to say that I was disappointed.  they should have placed it on a smaller plate for the visual effect.  It was a small piece of sirloin onions tomatoes and gravy on top a small bed of mashed potatoes. Carlos, the manager stopped by our table chatted a bit, and thanked us for our service. He surprised  us with desert a brownie with ice cream. A great end to our meal. I hadn't been to an Applebee's since July 21st as that experience was far less than desirable.  The El Cajon store restored my faith in Applebees. If you are at Office Depot  or Best Buy and all that shopping makes you hungry stop in at Applebee's."
Mia C.,"El Cajon, CA",0,6,,3.0,7/9/2017,"I've stopped here on several occasions to meet up with friends for lunch and dinner. We were seated promptly and our orders came out in due time. Twice now they have messed up my order. Food is average, nothing spectacular. I probably won't visit here again."
Cream D.,"La Mesa, CA",38,5,2,1.0,10/11/2017,NEVER HAD WORST SERVICE! Last Thursday my party and I waited over 20 min for a table (which was fine it was busy) we were finally sat at our table at 730pm as soon we sat down the waitress took our drink AND FOOD order (since I was with my 3 year old daughter and 6month old niece we made sure to look at the menu while we waited to be seated since anyone with kids knows their patience is short) First of all I drove from mission valley area to applebees for the $1 drinks they are promoting as soon we order them we were told they only have 1 flavor (not what is advertised) but whatever we order the 1 flavor. about 805 our apps came the cheese sticks where cold and cheese was hard like biting into an eraser you could tell they have been sitting. After waiting trying to give them benefit of doubt I finally asked to see a manger around 825. His name is NESS I believe. He came to the table and 1/2 a** apologized by saying the kitchen is backed up and WE COULD PAY FOR THE FOOD N DRINKS THAT HAD BEEN SERVED AND LEAVE...... No mention of comp. I have NO PROBLEM paying for my food my order was gonna be well over $40. So overall I completely wasted a night that was supposed to be full of good food and laughs with my dinner party instead I left very angry and still had to go buy food else where. I have also submitted my concerns to cooperate since dealing with the location management is just as bad as the service
Breanne M.,"San Diego, CA",133,254,316,5.0,4/9/2016,The service was great and the food was pretty delicious! Applebee's is always a go-to place if it's near exclamation point I had the Sriracha shrimp appetizer and a wedge salad and it was so good!
Megan A.,"El Cajon, CA",88,1,,2.0,12/8/2017,"This place is one of mine and my husbands favorite places to eat especially on Sunday's and Monday's when our favorite Bartendar Robert is working, he is always great. Tonight was the first time we've ordered take out and to be honest it was horrible. When I called in I was told our order would be ready in about 20min, I arrived in about 15min to find our food was ready, great! But before I left I figured out a side of mushroom toppers that I ordered wasn't in the bag so I let one of the workers know, I was asked by at least 4 different employees what I needed before one of the girls realized none of those 4 workers were going to check on the mushrooms. Already bad service, then I come to find I need to wait a little while.. Ok i asked how long they said 5min.. I waited at least 15min just for a side of sautéed mushrooms.. By the time I got home which is not even 5min away from the restaurant my food was cold and my husbands nachos were soggy. I've never had a bad experience here until tonight. Very disappointed, I won't ever order take out here again."
Miguel P.,"La Mesa, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/17/2017,Called and told them I had a party of 7 people and she got my name they said yes we have no wait time. We were 5 min away and when we got there they say they have a 15 mi. Wait time which wasn't a big deal but we waited 45 min to be seated.
Kris G.,"El Cajon, CA",0,20,,1.0,3/1/2017,Have been back here in awhile figured give another chance. Had to get moved from first table cuz it was dirty. Took 25 min to get 2 ice teas and 2 mt dews. Another 35 min for the food. And it was horrible. Don't think we'll be back here again. And giving a star is more then they should get
Gary S.,"La Mesa, CA",2,54,,5.0,3/29/2017,"Stopped in for some apps to go and a beer while I waited. Service was fantastic from Jenny. The beer was cold. Friendly, nice , clean. Everything was great."
Mike M.,"El Cajon, CA",97,106,,5.0,3/16/2017,"Still after a year Our favorite place to eat. GM has a great staff here, no such thing as it is not my job, every employee from host to GM cleans, expedites, serves and with great customers service  Our last two Visits we had KERRY E and TARA B as our servers and the were awesome but we have never in 5 years had bad service  Food is great  for a budget they have the 2 for 20.00 menu which is great but their new menu offers so low prices like grilled chicken breast and two sides for 9.99 Year since my last review and will not flood the compliments with names as YELP said it was suspicious last year and took me some time to get the compliment posted"
S R.,"El Cajon, CA",40,7,7,4.0,4/9/2017,The Spinach Artichoke Chicken Cavatappi was creamy and delicious. It was very flavorful. My Sprite had a sour flavor so I didn't drink it. The server Andy was  friendly and helpful. I like the atmosphere.
Loena Loeloeh L.,"San Diego, CA",7,278,209,3.0,7/15/2016,"we went there for early dinner, I got very salty tortilla soup. Gosh, my head still hold those salts. :). I ordered bourbon chicken steaks, and all my family member has their own choices. This restaurant located next to ramp freeway 8 and broadway, inside shopping center/parkway plaza mall and across to home depot."
Kristin Z.,"El Cajon, CA",0,7,,5.0,8/20/2017,"Applebees in Rancho San Diego is our families go to spot. We really enjoy the 2 for 20$ menu and it's perfect because it comes with an appetizer! They always give us great service, we never leave unhappy!"
Blong T.,"Clovis, CA",6,5,,1.0,1/17/2017,"Service was great but the food was terrible. Ordered the All American & Triple Bacon burger, 4 cheese honey chicken pasta, baby back ribs, chicken nuggets. The food was bland/no flavor/ribs were dry. My kids didn't even want finish their food. It's been at least 15 years since we've been to Applebee's and now I remember why we don't come here."
Vince E.,"La Mesa, CA",42,5,3,5.0,1/10/2017,If you enjoy your happy hour this is the place to be as far as price it's pretty darn good heading there today
Benetta P.,"Shreveport, LA",424,355,2836,3.0,7/5/2015,"The waiter was great. Very attentive and friendly. The steak was a tad too salty. The veggies and potato was good. The salad was excellent, especially the bacon vinegarette dressing. The blackened chicken shrimp and rice were tasty and flavorful. The chicken breast was a tad over cooked on the edges. The dessert, pretzels needed a lot more caramel sauce. They needed to be a bit warmer also. Nevertheless, we scarfed them down as they are delicious sauce or not. The fried string beans were delicious. My favorite appetizer."
Raul O.,"Lakeside, CA",11,26,28,2.0,11/18/2016,"It's been a while since I last visited this branch and my ""go to"" meal has been Bourbon Steak with garlic mashed potatoes. The server was very jovial and she made a promise that my drink was going to be free. The dinner was served. I was a bit disappointed with the steak cuts. Mashed potatoes not seasoned and I could not taste the garlic. Then check time arrived. The cashier put back the drink on the bill and asked me if I had another one. I was too tired to argue and I wanted to end the week without any trouble. I decided to take the high road and tipped her. Have a great weekend!"
Marie I.,"San Diego, CA",95,82,71,2.0,2/8/2016,"** Stars because our server was ok. It's so dark inside I needed a flashlight to read the menu. From 1st glance the establishment looks clean and tidy... Until you feel your feet in an ocean of debris around, and under your feet. We ordered some mixed drinks with some fruit in it. The drink was fine.. But don't eat the yucky fruit o.o We ordered rare steaks... It took forever :(  Our grand baby was crying because it took so long and she was hungry. Mashed potatoes were so dry, it could've been used to repair a hole in your wall. My baked potato was under cooked in the inside, over cooked on the outside... I didn't know it was even possible... Zucchini was over cooked... It disintegrated when your fork grazed it."
Erin E.,"Lakeside, CA",12,120,120,3.0,2/26/2016,"This place delivered the standard Applebee's fare and we had great service.  It was no better or worse than any other Applebee's I've been to... well, with one exception.  There was a large party of people who just let their children use the restaurant as their personal playground to play tag.  Now, I completely believe that's the parents' fault; however, I also believe the management could have said something to them about the safety of the kids and other patrons.  It's a fine line, so I am on either side of this fence, but it was pretty out of control."
Christopher B.,"La Mesa, CA",0,31,2,1.0,7/27/2016,"Came here for dinner after receiving a gift card. If you like your food extra salty, definitely eat here! The Pros:  - Our server was nice and polite - The staff were courteous and nice - The inside of the restaurant was clean (minus the bathrooms, see below) The Cons: - The food was so salty that my kid didn't want to finish it - The ribs had almost no meat on them, were burnt, and were super salty as well - The bowl that our mac and cheese and chicken came on still had old food crusted on it - The bathrooms were questionable, at best (maybe just the time we happened to be there?) We tipped our server well because of how polite he was, but we don't think we will be visiting this restaurant again. The food left a lot to be desired and again, was extremely salty. Having your food served on a dirty plate is also a little off-putting. How to improve: - Clean your bathrooms more often - Better quality control for food being served - Better quality control of the utensils and plates being given to guests"
