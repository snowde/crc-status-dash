Gianna P.,"San Diego, CA",69,19,39,3.0,4/20/2014,"The shrimp steak with veggies below 550 calories was really good. The fork and knife were spotty. A family members fork was filthy and so was the floor. I was afraid to place my purse on the floor. I was a bit disgusted, but at least the food was good and our server. In the future, I personally would order to go to keep my personal hygiene away from germs."
David T.,"El Cajon, CA",1,28,2,4.0,10/14/2013,"I came here for the Monday Night Football game after walking out on my dinner at the next door On the Border. (read that review...) They were very accommodating and gave me a booth. As usual, I let the waitress order for me. Got the bourbon steak with onions and mushrooms. it was FANTASTIC.  Now, I have had past bad experience at this very location and was very skeptical, but they delivered.  My wife had the shrimp and daughter had mini cheeseburgers. All was excellent.  I usually dont do this, but I asked to speak with the manager.  Told him he saved our evening and it would be reflected in the tip as well as here on Yelp. Very happy eater tonight."
Lynn V.,"El Cajon, CA",34,15,3,2.0,2/19/2015,"Well, the food was ok- up to usual Applebee's standards, but the Carside to Go service sucks. We placed our order, and drove up and parked in the Carside to Go marked spot, and waited. And waited. And waited. I could see the camera above us. But nobody came out. Finally, I sent my daughter in to get it, because I was in my jammies-- because I _thought_ I wasn't going to have to get out of my car! There went their tip...  Thanks for the cold food! Next time, I'm going to the one in Rancho San Diego. They are equidistant from my house, and at Rancho San Diego, they come running right out with my food all nice and hot. So I tip them well."
Maria W.,"El Cajon, CA",7,52,30,3.0,2/5/2015,this is more of a bar scene type of restaurant I wouldn't say it so much family oriented so if you're going with children are with your older parents I wouldn't recommend bringing them here considering there's people drunk at the bar and they're quite loud. I would definitely recommend the fish and chips because it's just really good.
Debbie D.,"Spring Valley, CA",23,18,1,1.0,2/2/2015,"Don't waste your time at this Applebees! I did the carside to go this evening, arrived a couple minutes before the time I asked to ready, and waited for 10 minutes with no one showing up. I called the restaurant and it took them an additional 10 minutes to bring me my food, and an item was missing. I then had to wait for that last item, so I ended up waiting almost a half an hour beyond the time but my order was supposed to be ready. So much for a service advertised as being designed for when you're  ""short on time"". NEVER GOING BACK--SAVE YOURSELF THE DISAPPOINTMENT AND DON'T GO EITHER!!!"
Samuel B.,"San Diego, CA",18,93,28,5.0,11/27/2013,An Applebee's like any other. Food was good and cheap. Drinks were heavy and my favorite the military discount.  It wasn't busy so our order was quick and war hot.  Great customer service so we are most likely to comeback whenever in the area!
Cat D.,"Lakeside, CA",114,3,,5.0,6/7/2015,Sever : nice Shelby  Food: amazing  The manger was so nice. He turned on the heat for me bcus he could tell I was cold and then came to the table to make sure I felt more comfortable. the computer was kewl to play with and made it super easy to pay :) I'll be back !!!
Sheryl S.,"El Cajon, CA",0,3,1,5.0,2/2/2016,"Today we decided to eat at the Applebee's in El Cajon, conveniently located in the malls parking lot. Our server, Dan, was exceptional! He made the dining experience quite enjoyable. Very friendly and attentive. We ordered the new Cesar Lime Chicken with quinoa. A great healthy option! We would come back to sit in his section for sure!"
Shane S.,"Lakeside, CA",10,80,2,4.0,1/25/2015,"Applebees is actually one of my fave restraunts, and i do have a lot! Pretty great, good prices and a huge variety of foods. I love the wings! and the burgers."
Tony M.,"Lakeside, CA",82,21,13,3.0,3/12/2011,"Came here to have a nice chill dinner with my wife on a late Saturday night. Our waiter was EXTREMELY nice and courteous and fast! We ordered the 2 for $20 meal that included the queso blanco appetizer ( a little thin for being a dip). We ordered the bourbon chicken and shrimp and the cajun shrimp pasta, which tasted ok, all very well seasoned and cooked adequately (spicy).  The atmosphere in that place was not so good. There were a couple of drunks acting like fools and some dude staring at me like a creeper. The service was wonderful and the food was good so I can see myself coming back another time."
Howard N.,"Alpine, CA",7,169,42,2.0,1/4/2015,Crap food over salted French fries would have been okay with less salt My wife's tortilla soup was so spice even I who likes spice could not eat it I ordered the all american burger got this thing with cooking oil all over the bun greasy meat pattie with cheese and something crunche in the meat  Pickle? I had less then half the burger and very little of the FF's befor we paid our tab on the little machine on the table. Also bacon was on top of the pattie  I put that to the side.  No tomatoes  or lettuce   The artichoke dip was okay infact that was the best part of our meal Coffee was good Services was four STAR  Felt bad for our server hope she can move on to a better place then Applebee's  Food two stars or less My wife was given a gift card for this place She still has about $13.00 on it should have given the whole amount to our server as I don't think we will be back Maybe for a drink and the dip? The dip was a very small amount still it was tasty Yes we did tip our server not her fault the food was greassy crap Update  Been home two hours my stomach is not doing well To much grease for me Thank You Applebee's El Cajon But then who at Applebee's gives a FIG from reading the other YELPS You will notice no replies from Applebee's to folks here on YELP  Sorry management
Jack H.,"Santee, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/5/2015,"The only reason they got any stars is because I have to give them one. Wish I could rate the food, but we never got to that point. My wife and I went in early on a Friday night and the place was less than half full. We were seated quickly and then we were completely ignored. At least half a dozen servers passed close by our table and a couple of different servers helped out the table next to us. Not a single one of them even acknowledged our presence. We even pressed the ""call server"" button on the stupid IPAD thingy on the table and set it so that anyone who looked in our general direction would have seen the flashing light on it. After more than 10 minutes had passed we decided to leave. As we were walking out the door the hostess asked us if we enjoyed hour dinner. We told her that we never got it and we weren't going to sit around any longer and be ignored. We walked out and went next door to ""On The Border"" were we had a great meal and fast service. Found out later from some of my friends and neighbors that they got the same treatment when they went there. I don't think I'll be going again. Ever."
Jeffrey W.,"Campo, CA",1,29,3,4.0,11/8/2014,Quick seating. Prompt Order delivery.  Good waitress.  I don't recommend the Macaroni and Cheese Pepper Chicken meal.
Jay E.,"El Cajon, CA",238,384,64,3.0,4/28/2011,"Remodeled interior makes it seem a lil weird awkward sittin at the bar... ...it's gonna take a while to get used to. Other than that, it's still the same ol Applebee's with a more modern atmosphere now."
Mimi S.,"Laguna Beach, CA",651,497,522,3.0,9/8/2012,"So this guy asked me on a date and I accepted.  He asked me where I wanted to go and I said Outback Steakhouse so he suggested Applebee's.  :[    Anyways, we came here friday night.  Not bad, they told us it would be a 15 min wait time but we ended up waiting 2 min.  I ordered Cajun Shrimp pasta and yea it was ok but the shrimp were slightly undercooked and unseasoned. The server was nice but she never came back to refill our drinks nor did she offer dessert.  Some manager came to pick up our plates so I asked him for a blondie.  I have been here before and it seems to be a hit or a miss.  Id go back."
Mary K.,"El Cajon, San Diego, CA",540,703,1410,5.0,3/31/2013,"I came here on Easter Sunday and I must say, amazing service! Our waitress was very polite and had a very nice attitude. I got the 7 oz sirloin with mashed potatoes and veggies. My steak was cooked perfectly, the mashed potatoes were nice and creamy, and the veggies were great! Everything was really clean and our waitress refilled our drinks and checked on us a lot. This was a great experience!"
Eda H.,"La Mesa, CA",54,83,105,4.0,1/12/2015,"Each time we go to this location, my husband and I sit at the bar to order our meals and have a drink. The bartender Robert is always very friendly and professional. He remembers how my husband likes his steak cooked and always make sure it's right, before bringing it out. Keep up the awesome job Robert!"
Aki K.,"Sydney, Australia",1,57,,1.0,10/22/2013,"This place sucks, the server was too busy flirting with another server she sat my food on the bar and just talked. Also when my friend asked for dessert she looked her up and down and said she didn't need it!  Food was cold and had things on it I had specifically asked to be left out. Would never go here again."
Jaycee T.,"Chula Vista, CA",191,128,153,1.0,2/6/2012,Never again! I thought all Applebee's were created equal but its not so! Unfortunately the best part of this meal was the chips and salsa.  The food was just gross. I had the peppercorn steak and my bf had some pasta. Unfortunately the service wasn't great either. The waitress wasn't rude but just completely uninterested.  I would recommend the Applebee's in Hazard center.
Claudiu P.,"El Cajon, CA",1,10,,4.0,10/24/2014,We are coming here every week after our soccer games...  Nice place... Tasty appetizers at only $3 on happy hour... The only minus from me is that you don't find too much diversity of beers...
