John J.,"Carmel Valley, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/22/2015,I felt dirty after I left.  Nachos were a joke. Tortilla soup was ok.  The waiters/staff?  I just don't think they were trained. ..so I dont blame them as much as I blame the company.   A cocktail napkin is not a napkin for dinner. And bringing a stack of 4 isnt any better.  They ought to enforce a basic dress code too.  Man.....you cant wear gym shorts and a wife beater t-shirt....and be 150 pounds overweight and expect other customers not to completely lose their appetite.   You shouldn't expect much from an Applebee's...and I didnt....but you should expect .....I dont know....cleanliness?  The place was funk city broadway.   Sorry to be mean.....but damn ----FIX IT!
Deshaun H.,"El Cajon, CA",0,7,3,1.0,2/26/2015,"Applebees in EL Cajon,CA at parkway plaza Mall sucks!! They not even busy in here and customer service trouble. Won't come back!  Order BBQ wings and cant even get more then 2 napkins! Not to mention all the other stuff that pissed me off! Waitress MIA smh"
Melissa L.,"Lake Forest, CA",129,30,52,1.0,11/2/2011,"Seriously... why is there no option for restaurants that suck more than ""Eek! Methinks not.""?! There should be a ""F*ck! NEVER again!!"" option. My fiance is my foodie partner so we're always down to try something new. I have never been to Applebee's before, but he compared it to Chili's which is okay in my book. We were sat immediately and I ripped open the menu excited to see what they have... yeah. Nothing special. I mean, I like to eat and seriously nothing jumped out at me. This was definitely an omen!  I ended up ordering the Southwest Jalapeno Burger (burger, pepper-jack cheese, candied jalapenos, chipotle mayo, lettuce, tomato, onions). Sounds good right? It was disgusting!! And for as long as it took to come out, I figured it would have looked and tasted amazing- wrongo. The burger was so greasy that the oils consumed the bun and I'm pretty sure it had been used in a game of hockey in the kitchen. Puke. Oh and lettuce and tomatoes? MIA. So picture in your head: a brownish, oily smooshed burger. The fries were horrible too. Definitely not fresh... especially after being under the heat lamps for so long (the plate my burger was on was beyond hot!). My fiance ordered the 12 oz. New York Strip, which comes with seasonal vegetable and your choice of garlic mashed potatoes or a baked potato. Because there are no available substitutions (lame) he went with the veggies and the garlic mashed potatoes. The state of his plate was ridiculous. His steak looked as fake as a McRib, he got a tablespoon of potatoes and maybe 6 tiny veggies. It looked like baby food on a serving platter- that's how sad the portions were. He cut into his steak and the texture inside was so weird... pretty much like pureed meat shaped into a steak. But they made sure to put 3 grill marks on it-yipee. He tried his potatoes and there was definitely no garlic in there, it was just powdery and tasteless fluff (someone at a geriatric home is missing their tatoes).  All in all, horrific experience. I was actually stunned when the waitress served the entrees and then asked if everything looked okay. Even Helen Keller would've flipped her off. Eff Applebee's! There's no place like Taco Bell!"
Deanna R.,"Port Huron, MI",0,7,,2.0,7/21/2015,"Bad food, even worse service. The wonton chicken tacos were decent, but my grandma couldn't even eat her lime chicken entree.  Will not be back"
Jeremy T.,"Santee, CA",53,138,30,3.0,7/15/2012,"My wife and I took the kids there yesterday on route to go see Madagscar 3. Which was pretty funny. Anyways, on topic! We really enjoy this location. With it being newly remodeled, it has really made it known that they are doing what they need to do to get better. The girls and their friend ordered off the kids menu, (2) orders of Chicken Tenders and a Chicken Breast sandwich. All three were very pleased with what they got. I must say, the Chicken breast sandwich looked pretty damn good. My wife ordered the Chicken Tender Platter which comes with 7 Tenders, Coleslaw, and french fries. The Chicken was cooked perfeclty, nice and crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. I know, I know, its just Chicken Tenders, But... I have had some rank ass Chinken Tenders before. These were good.  I ordered the Applebees Reuben. Honestly, not their best sandwich but it was do-able. The problem was not the contents of the sandwich, even though the meat seemed like it was straight out of a package of pastrami you can buy at the store, it was the soggy bottom. The bottom of the sandwich was so saturated with the contents from inside the sandwich it really seemed that it sat and waited under the heat lamp for the rest of the order to get done. Kind of disappointing.  Other than that, the service was good, the happy hour was descent, I mean, my wife had a Margarita that she said tasted like straight bottle mix, and I had a beer. I dont drink fizzy yellow beer often, but when I do. I prefer Dos Equis. Ha Ha Ha Ha, just being dumb. Really though, with the bar being remodeled also, I was really hoping to see more a of a selection tap wise. Its really pretty weak actually. Bud Light, Dos Equis, Coors Light, Blue Moon and Sam Adams Boston Lager. It would just be cool for them to consider throwing on a few more Micro brews. Carry some local guys on your taps. Manzanita, Stone, etc......"
Pam B.,"El Cajon, CA",5,169,27,4.0,6/5/2012,"We had a very nice waitress, who made some good suggestions when we asked. We both enjoyed our dinner.  I had a steak and my husband the fish and chips.  Both were tasty and cooked just right."
Paul S.,"Spring Valley, CA",127,414,2830,3.0,2/8/2010,"Okay, wife's out of town.  It's getting late.  My son and I are hungry.  Where do we go?  I don't know.  Where do you want to go eat?  I don't know.  Hmm....Let's drive around until we find something open. Hacienda closed.  O wait!  An Applebee's.  Okay, let's eat good in the neighborhood. Happy Hour?  Late at night?  Jackpot.  I can order some cocktails and half price appetizers.  The kid can drive me home.  I have always liked their margaritas.  Applebee's makes a decent blended margarita.  I loves the salt on the rim. It was good to kick it with my kid and talk and enjoy a decent meal.  Service that night was pretty good too.  Applebee's came through on a late night food hunt."
Jeff J.,"San Diego, CA",0,452,,2.0,1/27/2012,"This place is a 'no-big-deal' kinda place. Average food, service and the silverwear is usually dirty."
Ali r.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,9,1,1.0,6/27/2015,"We have been coming to the Applebee's for a few years most times it's a good experience and we were so upset tonight. Our server Jace had two tables and blatantly kept checking on the other table next to us without coming to see us. We used the table kiosk to ask for help and that was ignored for ten minutes. After we were all finished we waited 20 minutes, our plates were never taken away and his hands were empty every time he passed our table. A few other people kept walking by, nobody checked on us. A blonde hostess and bussed were talking at a table across from us for a few minutes about weekend plans. Then we saw our server standing next to the POS system leaning next to the wall talking to a girl. Eventually he did manage to find time to bring the check ""for our convenience"" and still took no plates plates from the table. I'm not sure what this guys problem was but we will definitely never work with him again. I was a server for many years and but this was just sad and pathetic service."
Tim S.,"Surprise, AZ",111,1122,1495,3.0,7/16/2011,"Applebees....nowhere near my favorite place but we had a couple gift cards so we decided to use them tonight.  We ordered the 2 for $20 deal which comes with 2 entrees and your choice of appetizer.  We went with the boneless buffalo wings for our appetizer.  For our entrees, I got the chicken strip basket and my wife went with the 3 cheese penne pasta. The boneless buffalo wings were pretty tasty and its one of the things Applebees does well.  We gobbled them up in no time.  Next out came our entrees.....my chicken strips were pretty tasty and they always have decent french fries at Applebees.  My wifes pasta dish on the other hand was absolutely horrible.  It tasted funky, was lukewarm and overall just sick.  She only ate a few bites of it.  Our server Mike (awesome dude and the only reason this review gets 3 stars) came to clear out our plates and noticed she didn't eat much of it.  He asked if we didn't like it and my wife told him yes.  He apologized and said he wished we would have told him earlier and he would have traded it out for something else.  All was good at that point.  My wife was still hungry though so she decided to order a side salad.  A few minutes later the manager came out with the salad and apologized again for the crappy pasta.  My wife finished that and when Mike came back with the bill, they actually took the pasta dish off the bill which was an awesome good faith gesture.  We paid the bill, I left Mike a fat tip and we were on our way.   Without the gift cards, I would never choose to come here because the food is always just average.  You never hear of someone telling stories about the ""awesome meal they had at Applebees"".  The service was on point though and Mike deserves some props.  He was constantly refilling our drinks without asking and checking on us throughout.   It was really nice that they removed the pasta from the bill too.  Most places would say, ""Too bad so sad....don't order it next time....lesson learned"".  Applebees made it right though and for that we are appreciative!"
J D.,"Lakeside, CA",0,8,2,1.0,8/16/2015,"Waited for ever to take our order... when we ordered the idiot told us the fryer was down and I couldn't get fries with my burger... what ever happened  to telling us before we make a choice? Flies flying around, two out of three forks had food still stuck on them and extra plate was dirty. Never again"
Mariam N.,"La Mesa, San Diego, CA",16,4,2,4.0,11/16/2013,"The only reason they didn't get five stars from us is because of the rude hostess (after her ""I'm sorry I guess I was rude earlier"" noooo you were rude and you just came because of your manager (who was really nice) In The beginning .. Anyways aside from her - The food the drinks and the atmosphere was excellent aside from that. Really appreciated the manager coming out and taking time to ask us about the issue we had .. If you come to this Applebee's make sure to ask for Angela's table excellent service on her part :)"
Patricia P.,"San Diego, CA",47,31,,1.0,1/5/2014,"Applebee's no longer prints alcohol drink prices in their menu and the servers are not equipped to provide the prices. We requested prices on several drinks and the server provided dollar ranges on some or said she would have to key it in the register to get the price.  She was short and impatient. It is ridiculous, embarrassing and our first experience like this with a nationwide chain.  The explanation was that the price of drinks vary throughout the country. We spoke to the manager named Danny. We suggested there be a drink menu at the table or a listing of prices the servers can keep in their pocket for reference. He said our comments would be shared and he would do some coaching with the server. The food was good but the service was unsatisfactory.  We are unlikely to be back."
Christa A.,"La Mesa, CA",2,24,50,2.0,3/20/2014,Food tasted good and good service but now I'm home sick from food poisoning after eating the oriental chicken salad =( so miserable
Bill J.,"San Diego, CA",36,57,5,3.0,7/8/2011,"Pretty good for family fare.  When I go out to a family chain like this or one of the many others, it's not like I'm expecting gourmet food; I don't order fish at these places.  Many times, however, I want to take the kids out somewhere that I don't have to force them to eat or apologize for their behavior.  This is one of those places. About the service.  I don't know how they do it, but I've never had a bad server at Applebee's.  We're not *that* demanding, but we do churn through several refills on drinks during a meal.  Our server has never yet failed to notice and have refills on the way.  Service is really the big difference between a lot of these chains, and I have no problem saying Applebee's seems to have a good training regimen, or just better hiring practices, from what I can see.  If I could add half a star for this, I would. Specific dishes?  I usually get the Riblets, as they're nicely slow-cooked, and they have a variety of sauces.. one of them even sufficiently spicy for my taste.  Their salads are standard... no surprises; I do wish they'd add a little local dressing fare like a jalapeno vinaigrette - just something different.  They pride themselves on their steaks, but this isn't really the place for good beef.   Pasta is pretty standard... I don't really have it, though my wife does and likes it (much like anything in a cream sauce). The bar is not bad; perfectly acceptable for this level of restaurant... maybe a little better.  One nice thing is they don't inundate the rest of the seating area with loud music just because a bar is in the place.  They also have nicely sized TVs for catching the game. All in all, I get exactly what I expect at a place like this, and unexpectedly good service.  It's cheap too!  2 adult meals plus app for $20 and one kids meal turns into a bargain night out."
Barbara B.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,1,4.0,5/22/2014,"I giving a 4 star only because the manager bent over backward to satisfy us after the mistake had happen. It was mothers day evening and i was aware that the stuff was exhausted after a busy day. But the waiter had us waiting about 20-25 minutes after putting our order in, he was waiting on the table behind us faithful without even letting us what was going on. Then finally I got up and spoke with the manager, the manager went in back to see what was going on, only to find out our ticket was lose. The waiter never even acknowledged us let along that the ticket was lose. So the manager took control and give us so me perks along with a great meal,on the house of course. So all was not lose, but I would take it out of that waiters pay if I was the manager for such rude behavior...Lol!!!!! Overall it was nice..."
Kellie C.,"San Diego, CA",54,98,155,2.0,12/2/2011,"I have had the pleasure (lol) of dinning here on occasion. My son loves the appetizers here. I thought it was an ok place. The best waitress was Tiffany.  So my son informs me that his school is having a fundraiser at this location on 11/29/11. Ok lets go. The was no line waiting to be seated, so far so good. I ask to be seated in Tiffany's area, but I was informed that she moved to a different store. Dang!  We were seated by some guy. I did not get his name. But while we were waiting for the apps and my soup we consumed our drinks. I started looking around and I found our server! He was chatting it up with the bartender,,,lol. Finally he returns with the apps for my son and a friend. Where's my soup? I wait patiently, I am offered a mozzarella stick to eat which was soooo yummy. Still waiting. Now I'm at the point that I have to go to the bathroom from the coffee I've had in place of my soup. On my way back to the table I don't see our server again, and don't see my soup on the table, so I see another server and inform her that my son has been done with his app and I still don't have my soup. I just said the cancel it.  Then our server comes out and brings my soup saying that he was sorry it took so long and that he took it off the bill. That was nice. Our food arrives. My son had that 2 for 20 deal. I'm not saying that I'm a food Whor*, but I had to laugh at the size of his food. I'd have to agree with another post that the steak was the size of a mc rib! lol My son is 15 so it kinda looked like a happy meal. they should rename the 2 for 20 ,,,,,half the size of normal meals. 15 minutes after we returned home my son was eating a cereal bar.  I had a very good steak. I ordered it med. rare because I know if I didn't it would have been dry. For some reason it must be cheaper to make mask potatoes vs. veggies. I had 2 huge scoops of the potatoes and a small amount of veggies that were not done. The were not hot and were rock hard.....they were raw. Towards the end of our meal our server came to give us our check. My son and I had a lively conversation about how much to tip him. I said the bare minimum. He wanted to give him a bit more. As we were talking about this where do you think the server was at?.........Yup the bar again talking to the cute bartender....lol My son sided with me. You get what you pay for here. I guess if they had outstanding customer services then people would over look the bland menu. Most of the stuff on the menu is about the same it's weird.  But with a bland menu, very small portions (with that 2 for 20 deal) and lacking customer service, makes hometown look great!"
Ivan V.,"Lakeside, CA",0,14,5,2.0,5/27/2012,"As  advertised dinner for two for 20.00 has our attention in this slow economy, as a family on a budget with kids you try to find deals that appeals to your wallet.  as we went for late lunch to early dinner on a tuesday around 3pm we had to wait 17 minutes to get a seat.  restaurant was near empty i counted 12 people at the very most but we had to wait and wait and wait.   food was ok no frills i had steak with baked potato that we had to send back twice since the butter didn't melt obvious it was cold no worries, riblett basket was awesome also the dessert cookies and vanilla ice cream. I gave it such a low score for poor service  horrible waitress management  was never seen."
Deb C.,"La Mesa, CA",24,49,9,2.0,4/29/2014,"The selection was listed as blackened shrimp with tomatoes and creamy rice with a lemon parmesan sauce....it was more mexican, no lemon taste what so ever and the rice was very bland and dry...except for a couple bunches that clumped together. I had started with the pretzel and beer cheese app. The pretzels were deep fried....totally ruined the pretzel experience. The cheese sauce was very bland and there was NO beer in it. The best thing was the honey mustard that came out on the plate with the cheese sauce. Haven't been there for years and definitely wont be going back anytime soon. The girl offered to comp a dessert but why bother with a free dessert that is most likely not going to taste good either. The margarita was good but nothing exceptional."
David H.,"Altadena, CA",2,19,,1.0,6/11/2013,"Have had a good experience at A's in the past a long time ago and at a different location but this was bad.  Was here three weeks ago and was not impressed but came again specifically to try the riblets.  Dinner brought to table with a friendly ""Can I get you anthying else?"".  ""Silverware"", my response.  Pathetic portion size on the riblets platter.  Riblets had a strange chemcally  taste like ammonia or cleaner.  Was so hungry after quickly eating that small platter that I asked for the menu to order another entree.  Yes, it was the platter and not the smaller basket.  No, I am not a binger.  Waitress took 40 minutes coming back to me because of her socializing at other tables so I ran out of time and had to leave hungry.  Even had to flag down another waitress to pay. Not going back to this or any other A's. Oh yeah...  Never got the glass of water I requested.  $7 for a glass of bad beer?!?  Their alcohol menu suspiciously does not include prices.  If it had, I would not have ordered it."
