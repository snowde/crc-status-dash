Justin B.,"Santee, CA",569,84,129,1.0,1/21/2011,"Ugh. Apparently the kid's mac n' cheese is about half a cup, our waitress was blissfully unaware that iced teas are refillable (I had to ask her three times just to see a single refill in 20 minutes), and didn't bother to let us know that the tomato basil soup my wife ordered as her main course wasn't available today until all our dishes came out, instead attempting to sub it with a side salad without even a word. Really, guys? So she has to order something else, a burger (more food and definitely more money than she planned or wanted, but the rest of the family has their food now, so leaving is hardly an option), and wait for it to come out long after the kids and I have finished our dinners. The manager pops by while we're waiting and asks how our food is... We tell her about the ""mix up"" and her response is a weak shrug. Much later, she comes by and asks if we want a molten gooey brownie explosion or somesuch. This, after I (diabetic) ordered the low-cal asiago steak and my wife (obviously not looking for a big meal) attempted to order a simple bowl of soup. No, we certainly were not interested in the 1500 calorie brownie. After we politely turn down the incomprehensible offer, we're treated with another half-hearted shrug and the manager's backside. The bill comes, no offer to compensate for a night of crummy service, and we're out.  I've always enjoyed Applebee's, but no matter how good the food is, if this is the service we can expect, I can't see us returning here!"
Gabe H.,"San Diego, CA",677,610,811,3.0,10/24/2010,"Typical Applebee's experience. Took forever to get a soda. We don't really frequent Applebee's locations, but we were in the area and were lazy so this is where we landed.  I expected it to be a little busier on a Saturday afternoon, but it was relatively slow and we were seated right away. I don't want to be overly critical because in all reality it was the people that were annoying and I know they have little control over that.  We split one of th $20 specials that came with one appetizer and two entrees.  It was a good deal for the money.   The waitress was friendly and the food came quickly.  The manager was doing some table touching and checked in on is.  My biggest beef was that I asked for a soda and it didn't come until about the end of my meal.  At that point I didn't really want it and barely drank any of it.  I know it's only a couple bucks, but in my opinion if you forget something until the end of the meal like that you shouldn't charge for it.  No biggie though. Like I said, typical Applebee's experience."
Berta O.,"El Cajon, CA",0,10,,1.0,5/23/2014,"El Cajon location is the worst ever!  We stopped going there about a year ago because the service was so bad And the staff was not really friendly..  So tonight I decided to give them a try again.  Our night started off with many waiters/waitresses walking right by us, finally a sever.  Ordered drinks and an appetizer.  My husbands drink came wrong..ok not bad.  Ordered dinner, not less then five minutes my husbands burger came... No way is that med well, yep cut it and it was raw!  Asked for manager and explained situation.  At this point my husband was not hungry we were still waiting for mine. Ten min later the waiter told us mine went to another table.  We're done, thanks but no thanks Applebee's. Nothing changed in over a year, oh ya there was another manager listening to the conversation but he was to busy flirting with girls at the next table."
Tamara S.,"Lancaster, CA",93,12,4,5.0,3/7/2011,"My husband and I had dinner there this evening - WONDERFUL atmosphere, great food and service We had the 2 for $20 - LOTS of food, we tried the Queso Blanco - it was a little spicy, but it was great. My hubby had the Ribletts - they tasted yummy. I had the Chicken and Shrimp - the chicken was tender, tasty and amazing. All in all a great meal - our waiter was ROBERT and he gave great suggestions and kept the food and service moving.   Ask for him the next time you dine here."
Jodie K.,"San Diego, CA",3,13,,5.0,12/1/2015,"I went here for lunch with my friend 3 months ago and everything was great....so we went there again today and our server Samantha remembered us and already knew what we wanted to drink and possibly eat.  The French Onion Soup is incredible!  Her service is over-the-top.  The staff seems to work like Clock-Work and they all respect each other, which shows that their Manager, Neza, is doing things right to promote teamwork.  My only negative is......the online survey to commend employees for their great work and positive feedback is 20 minutes long and at the end they say.....Sorry.....you did not win our online sweepstakes...!   Who cares.......I'm not here to win any money......I'm here to commend great service and great food!   It comes from the hostess, to the Chefs, the Manager, the front line employees like Samantha and the behind the scenes employees to make this restaurant successful."
Beverly C.,"El Cajon, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/26/2014,"I had friends from Santa Barbara come here for a weekend and we went to dinner Friday night, the food was horrible. I ordered chicken tenders and they were so dried and over cooked that even dipping them in sauce and ketcsup didn't help I only ate 2. Their food was also overcooked."
Marina M.,"La Mesa, CA",0,14,1,3.0,2/28/2014,"I haven't been to Applebee's for a few years, and I have to say-a lot changed. The food was still good and service was too, but it seems like they used to be more homey and casual now they trying to be more fancy from menu choices to the presentation. I guess it's a matter of choice, but I liked it better in the past."
Bob W.,"El Cajon, CA",4,99,9,1.0,6/15/2012,"It's Applebees so my culinary expectations weren't very high to start with.  But there are certain things I kind of expect when I eat out...COLD salad...COOKED food...a dish that somewhat resembles the picture in the menu.  Good grief.  My ceasar salad was warm.  I got the double whiskey steak sizzling platter (or whatever its called) and one of the two tiny steaks were blood red and the other was medium.  To top it off (no pun intended) the mushroom, onion, bell pepper topping didn't come CLOSE to the smothered steaks pictured in the menu.  There was maybe a spoonful that barely covered half of one of the tiny steaks.  Oh, and there was so much seasoning on it if it wasn't for the texture I wouldn't be able to tell it was meat or tofu because it had no other flavor.  Yeah, never going back again."
Leila F.,"Lakeside, CA",16,18,26,4.0,10/12/2012,"Great service! Food over all was 3stars. I don't know what they did but the French onion soup tasted like oil. The bread was so soggy (I know the bread in French onion soup will get some level of soggy but this was mush)any other place uses hard bread. (Sorry I don't know the names of the bread. I eat food, not cook it.LOL) all and all I say 4 stars for service, drinks and appetizers."
Lauren P.,"La Presa, San Diego, CA",7,34,15,1.0,1/12/2013,"WORST SERVICE EVER! I would give this place zero stars if I could. This is the worst service I have ever had. We've only been here three times and each time was worse than the last. The last time was the last straw.  We came to watch a football game, and a specific game at that. There was another playoff game going on right before and ended up going into overtime, overlapping with the game we came to see. We asked our server if they could change the channel of the tv right in from of our table to a different game, and first she told us the 49ers weren't playing that day. Knowing she wasn't the brightest we assured her they were, but she said they could not change the channel until the broncos game was over because everyone in the bar came to see that game. Not really understanding why they couldn't change one tv out of the 10 TVs in the whole place, we patiently waited for the game to end.  Having to get updates from ESPN on our phones, we asked one of the managers if he could change the channel to the game we came here to see, and were currently missing. He said the same thing, that everyone else there was watching it and they would change the channel when the game was over.  So we waited more, missing the more of the niners game. When the broncos game went to double overtime we began getting very upset because we shouldn't have to miss our game, I mean they have ten TVs for god sakes. We asked a second manager why we couldn't just change the channel on the tv in front of us since we appeared to be the only ones looking at it. He said the tv is connected to the main tv in the bar and they have to be on the same channel and they won't change the main tv until that game was over. Ok I can understand that. But instead of the manager coming up with a solution to keep his customers happy, we had to ask if we could be seated near a less main tv to change the channel of the tv. He said he would go look for a new table to move us to.  He was gone for about 10 min, serving food to several tables and avoiding us. The ravens ended up scoring, finally ending the game. We were happy to be able to finally watch the game we solely came here to watch. As we were waiting for the manager to return, or someone to change the channel whichever came first, the bartender changed the channel of the main tv at the bar.  Oddly enough the channel on our tv never changed. Which according to the manager they were connected so if you change one you change both. My boyfriend became enraged, understandably. When the manager finally returned we explained why we were so mad and asked why the manager lied to us. He had no answer. When further explaining that we wasted our time, were lied to and received horrible service he had nothing to say. No solution, no apology, nothing to try and continue our service here. He just blankly stared at us and walked away.  So we won't continue our service here. No one should.  In only three times they have lost our business. The management team here is a joke and give no effort at customer service whatsoever. Don't dine here, unless you want to be treated like dirt!"
Robert P.,"Spring Valley, CA",90,81,8,5.0,10/4/2013,I have since been back.  Things have changed!  I was served very well.  The guy at the front door was very friendly and everything was served on time.  Give them a 2nd try!!
Deb G.,"Crest, CA",73,339,3,3.0,8/6/2012,Eh it's corporate America and I really don't care for these type of places.  The only reason we went is our friend Kerri works there and she is an excellent bartender.  We did the 2 for $20 plus drinks we spent about $50.  The food is so so but the service is excellent.  Never a sad face or attitude when you come into Apple-bee's.  The only reason we would return is to see our friend.  If and when Kerri decides to leave this establishment we will probably not make many trips back.
Jolly J.,"Santee, CA",7,54,,4.0,7/14/2012,I'm surprised at all the low ratings. I have always had positive experiences here. The food is great and the staff is courteous.
Cory G.,"El Cajon, CA",8,9,15,3.0,1/18/2012,"Decent food, good service, not too expensive."
Juliet E.,"El Cajon, CA",0,1,,3.0,2/28/2013,"My overall experience at Applebees was a really wonderful experience. Amazing customer service, I was served quickly and every time I asked for something it came so fast. They have a good variety of food and it's always been tasty. I've been there with a couple of lovely friends, the first time I had a drink with my friends in America and it was really amazing to have a drink together in such place. I used to drink Pomegranate Perfect Margaritas, even I felt dizzy a little bit but I loved it. The quality was really good, the price also was cheap, but the atmosphere was little bit noisy. I would definitely recommend going there sometime."
Tyler R.,"Winter Gardens, San Diego, CA",11,9,1,4.0,8/14/2012,food is good service is good. Good place to go and justhang out for a little bit.
Nick T.,"San Diego, CA",629,1462,267,2.0,2/27/2011,"I'm from planet Earth and Ive been eating my entire life and Ive been here awhile now so I KNOW what good food should taste like. As a matter of fact, whenever my friends go out to eat they always call me for advice and no matter where I send them they'll like it because they know that I have better taste than they do, especially when it comes to corporate mandated recipes and cooking techniques, like this here Applebee's."
Nick G.,"Berkeley, CA",3,9,,1.0,4/28/2009,"I'm a skeptic of 1-star reviews but I think that this place warrants one, particularly when the 2-star review on Yelp is described as one to convey the sentiment of having had ""better experiences [elsewhere]"" which would be a grotesquely unfair assessment of this restaurant. I've had a better experience at every other dining location except for perhaps Applebee's neighbor, On the Border, which I would say is an equal failure. I'm going to try and give a brief summation as to not bore my fellow Yelpers but still be fair to those gastronomists who so eagerly read reviews of chain restaurants. The service was abysmal. The servers seemed annoyed, unhelpful and were very jerk-like for a lack of a nicer term throughout the entire evening, almost to the point where I didn't think they deserved any type of gratuity compensation. I would have much preferred to walk into the kitchen myself and get my plate in order to avoid such poisonous personalities. I was too tired to do that though, and I think it might be a health department violation to have customers in the kitchen (though I doubt highly that this in particular was their concern given the uncleanliness of the place).  Moving right along, I could have gotten better-tasting food at Costco at a much lower price. Now, to be fair, I'm not comparing Applebee's to Cirque 2000; in fact, I think the rule of measurement I'm utilizing here is Chilli's (which is ironically near the La Mesa Costco) which is far superior in every sense of the word superior and I think even slightly less expensive. Essentially, Applebee's food was over-seasoned, at room temperature and over-priced. Even their water was nasty (how can you fail at water?).  To top the wonderful evening off, exiting the fabulous gourmet experience that is Applebee's, I was confronted by a glaring sign on the exit doors that informed me that after my wonderful experience, I might be contracting some form of cancer because this particular location has ""chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects..."". This is ""eating good in the neighborhood""? I think only M. Night Shyamalan could come up with the proper antithesis."
Kiarah H.,"El Cajon, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/4/2012,"I will never eat here again!!! The waiter served me a diet Pepsi and than argued with me about it.. my salad was extremely small, the ribs had hardly any meet on them and my daughters mac and cheese looked as if it had been cooked in the microwave. To top it all off our check had what looked like a booger stuck to it.. they only get 1 star because I cannot leave it blank."
Melissa E.,"El Cajon, CA",14,8,,1.0,10/23/2012,"So, my friend had never been. Took her & my son. Ugh...the waitress was young & rude. It took almost 30 minutes to receive our boneless wings & artichoke dip. Chips were stale. Within 5 minutes out came our entrees & salads. So, we had to decide waste the appetizers or let our meals go cold. Then my steak was burned! Dry & flavorless. When I commented to the waitress, she basically rolled her eyes & walked away. I called & complained. Their mgr called back & offered a gift card if we came back. Good for him. Needless to say, I declined. Horrible first impression for my friend who has never returned either."
