Casey P.,"El Cajon, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/10/2015,"I agree the food is not that great it is a chain.  My kids like the food and it is predictable regardless of location.  The issue I have is this location is service.  I was in yesterday with my two kids.  We waited close to 10 minutes after being seated to even be acknowledged.  The waitress for the table next to us had been to that table twice.  My kids ordered chocolate milk they brought it out in the container as though it was McDonalds.  I am not expecting 5 star dining experience, but we are sitting down at a restaurant.  The We all wanted water.  We waited again saw the waitress next to us get to her tables.  Another walk by a couple times to get to her section. Then tried the touch screen at the table to call the waitress.  Finally just flagged someone down.  This is not the first issues we have had with customer service at this location.  My husband has even talked with the manager about it. I just hate when the kids mention the place after shopping.  Food know to expect, but service is even worse and they don't care."
Mai B.,"San Diego, CA",3,116,7,2.0,1/18/2009,"I've only been here once. I got a gift card for X-mas and decided to use it. I should have just given it to a homeless person because I ended up not eating my food. I got the 2 meals for $20. I ordered the riblet dinner and the riblet tasted like they defrosted it in the micowave and lightly splashed a bit of BBQ sauce on it. I took a bite and let my friend take it home. Suffice to say I ended up going to one of my favorite tacos shops in Lakeside. I gave it 2 stars 'cause my friend's steak dinner looked decent - nothing fancy, but he ate it and didn't complain so I thought that's worth at least an extra star.  BTW, service wasn't good. I hardly saw the waitress. I had to flag her down many times since she was busy getting massaged by a fellow co-worker at the bar."
Robyn M.,"El Cajon, CA",28,39,5,1.0,6/1/2011,Terrible service and our dessert was burnt and SO hot that it burnt my mouth - my tongue and taste buds were seared off! Dessert is hard to mess up yet they did it.
Keysha S.,"San Diego, CA",16,41,9,4.0,6/16/2011,"Yeah, I get it, this is Applebees and everyone knows the food is not good. I'm not here to write about the food. It does pretty much suck. And the drinks are watered down and overpriced. What I am a huge fan of, however, is their customer service. Especially the manager Chris. When I got a soggy tortilla he brought me a whole new plate of food out immediately, piping hot and fresh. It was great. Not only that but he seems to instill a sense of pride and ownership in his employees and the way each of the servers treat customers is truly outstanding from what I've experienced and seen in the restaurant business. Kudos to you, Neighborhood Grill & Bar!"
Samantha K.,"Ramona, CA",11,8,2,1.0,12/31/2013,"As a former server I'm very lenient when people make mistakes.  The staff here are horrible!!!!! It took ten minutes to get us seated and the place was empty, then our server was no where to be found 15 minutes after we had been sat. Another server came and took our food and drink order and brought our drink.... Still no sign of our server. He finally made an appearance when our appetizers came out. Then no where to be seen again once until our entrees came out. Then he left once again. I then found a long blonde hair in my ribs. Not mine seeing as I'm a brunette. Still he is gone and I can't say anything. I finally have to grab him to get him to fix my food. His first response was oh shit. Got a new plate. Half the portion and took 20 minutes. Sent back.  Service is bad. Food is crappy. Never coming back again. However the manager was extremely nice and comped our meal the only reason this deserves a star."
Simone R.,"El Cajon, CA",36,3,,1.0,8/18/2014,"I came to applebees for my 21'st birthday. I ordered my first legal drink of my life and it was served with a LIVING MOVING FLY in it. I told the manager and was told I would get a replacement. After literally 5 minutes and watching others get their drinks I contacted the manager Reggie again. I was told ""it was a mistake and he was replacing it"" I explained it had been 5 minutes, and that we had already been there an entire hour and we wanted to leave since nothing was being done. We ended up still paying for my husbands 8$ drink and leaving without our food order to go to Chili's instead. Last year on the same day for lunch I visited this restaurant as well and my order was served wrong. The manager then comped our food or at least half of it (I no longer have receipt), and really made up for it. I have no idea why more was not done for me on my birthday at this location. Applebees should have been honored to serve me my first legal alcoholic drink and instead I left with nothing but an 8$ loss for a drink we didn't even finish. I called Chris Sumner regional manager 11/12/13 and now on 11/14/13 still have not received a response to my voice-mail. Even Chili's said we should have walked out and not paid. We received a way better 2 for 35$ meal complete with 4 martini's, and desert which they comped because Applebees was so terrible. Can someone please contact me and at least apologize? I feel like I was robbed of my memory thanks to this establishment!"
Dan S.,"San Diego, CA",43,20,1,2.0,11/14/2009,"Went with my daughter (who warned me she didn't like Applebee's).  I got the 3 for $20 and my daughter got a pasta bowl.  The food took too long to arrive and when I looked at it I thought ""it shouldn't have taken This long for This food to prepare"".  Waitress was nice enough.  Food was ok.  The bill came out to just under $40 - more than I thought was acceptable for the food we got.   When we were leaving I went to use the restroom and after I almost walked into the kitchen I asked three employee's where the restroom was and they all ignored me.  That's an instant rating deduction.   On an upside, the beer I had was cold and wet."
Educated B.,"San Diego, CA",1,70,1,1.0,12/16/2010,"ALWAYS A BAD EXPERIENCE! I have been to this Applebees many times because I have been invited and always hope that I have a good experience (but never happens). Their food does not taste good, cooked badly, or they mess up the order. One time I ordered some ribs and they were so hard, dry, burned, and looked like they were sitting out for days. It was hard as a rock when I bit into it that I spit it out without even chewing and returned it to the kitchen. This was not something I normally do but in this case, it was a must.The waitress agreed that the ribs looked awful and was nice about it. I decided to order something else from then on because of that disaster. Another time I went for the 2 for $20 and noticed their selection was not great but I still tried it and the food came out bland. It later made my stomach sick so not sure if the food was properly cooked or if it was the oils they use. The only good thing were the drinks, appetizers, and desserts. Recently, my friend invited me for dinner and I told her the past horror stories of my bad experiences and she hoped we'd have a good one. This time we didn't even eat because I asked for a sangria and the waitress could not accept my ID that expired 2 weeks ago. I told her to give me a break cuz I'm over 30yrs old and it takes the DMV 4-6 weeks to send the new ID in the mail! I had my online renewal receipt in my wallet. The waitress said she would ask her manager and sure enough she came back and said the manager said no.  I thought it was very unprofessional that the manager did not come to the table. Instead the manager decided to not even show his face or deal with us in person. For all I know, she could've walked to the kitchen and back without even asking the manager. So I basicly just told her we will eat somewhere else and walked out. If they don't want to serve me a over priced drink then that's too bad cuz they lost out on our drinks, appetizers, and two crappy meals."
Joseph N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,8,4.0,12/1/2013,"i dont know why this place has such low rating. i mean it's not that bad, and the waiters are pretty friendly too. i love their 2 for $20 special deals."
Chris P.,"La Mesa, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/12/2015,"I've been to this place multiple times and have never had a problem with service. I guess my server this day was not interested in serving my boyfriend or I the day we came in. The server came to us to take our drink orders right away. After that, she never returned. I thought maybe she was at lunch after noticing she hadn't come back after about 10minutes. Eventually, a busser came to order our food while she catered to her other tables. Fair enough. I thought she would at least check in on our table but never did. We had to ask for forks and she served every other table but ours (there were about 3 other tables). The only time someone came to us was to order our food, drop off our food and give us the check. Not once did anyone say ""how is everything."" When we were getting up to leave, she walked by, looked at us and still said nothing. I can't make this up. That was the last time I ever went to this Applebee's and I highly recommend going anywhere but here!"
anne b.,"San Diego, CA",0,18,,1.0,1/21/2014,"Horrible food and service. I ordered a BLT and the ""bacon"" was not edible. I said something and he brought out more unedible bacon. I don't think it was even real bacon?? The server acted like he'd take care of it but went on break or clocked out but never saw him again. This was the first time I've never tipped :/ Never going there again. Thanks for the crappy LT Applebees"
V M.,"San Diego, CA",3,45,2,5.0,12/22/2013,"PIetro is the server you want to serve your table . He is amazing, fast, outstanding customer service ! Everytime I go there I ask for him, because he knows what it means to serve tables ;) you deserve it all + this applebee is extremely nice overall , especially better looking after the remodeling"
Eric A.,"San Diego, CA",1,16,1,1.0,8/7/2011,"We've been going here for years, food is excellent, servers are excellent, food always takes a long 27 minutes to arrive. We just stopped going here forever now because the freaking' music is so loud, we can't even hear each other. I love loud music but come on, this is a restaurant, not a night club! Late Sunday night with family and the stupid-a$$ manger is blaring loud rap inside and outside the restaurant. We asked the waitress to turn it down three different days, they never did. F. O. Applebees!"
Ross L.,"Lakeside, CA",6,50,,2.0,2/12/2012,"We went to Applebee's the other night for dinner.  My sister just started Weight Watchers and was interested in checking out their WW menu items.  We got seated in a reasonable amount of time (four of us) and then the server who brings us our drinks promptly tells us that she is going on break.  Oh great, you know what that means...our table has just landed in the restaurant equivalent of ""no man's land"".  And, as expected, from there the service went downhill.  The food was okay, but it was definitely a challenge getting a server to come back to our table for any reason.  They didn't waste any time, however bringing the check when they brought our main courses out.  We decided to order some desert and it literally took ten minutes to track down a server to order from and then another fifteen minutes to get ONE desert that we all shared.  We then waited another several minutes after finishing the desert for the updated bill to arrive.  Good thing we were not in a hurry...All in all, nothing to write home about, but something to write Yelp about."
J N.,"Alpine, CA",0,9,,3.0,2/9/2012,"I must admit, I have never really been a fan of Applebees or any other similar restaurant.  However, my daughter enjoys it, so on 2/6/12 we were in the area and went there for dinner.  We were greeted warmly at the door and seated immediately.  Our server, Kylie, was a little slow in arriving, but she was very nice.  I ordered a glass of wine.  My one complaint here is that they don't have the wine prices on the menu.  My daughter ordered the Chicken Broccoli Bowl and I ordered a salad and the Weight Watchers Cabernet Mushroom Steak.  I would have ordered the steak from the description alone, not just because it was less than 550 calories.  The salad was nothing special.  My daughter really enjoyed her pasta.  It was a huge portion.  The steak was wonderful.  I could not believe how good it was.  It was tender, cooked to perfection, and the sauce was awesome.  Both my daughter and I got doggie bags.  I was so impressed with the steak I was seriously looking for somebody to compliment when we left.   Kylie was very attentive.  She kept apologizing for delays, but I thought her service was fine and tipped her accordingly.    So why am I only giving them three stars?  I woke up on 2/7/12 with vomiting and diarrhea.  I am still sick 3 days later.  I know it may not be related, but I can't help wondering about food poisoning, especially after reading the other posts here.   Because of the steak, I will probably eat here again (though not as a first choice), but I don't think I'll order a salad.  (BTW, I have not been able to eat the leftovers and don't think I will.  However, I gave some to my cats.  Only one of them ate some, which is unusual, but she did eat it, so I'm sure it wasn't the steak if there was a food borne illness issue.) So, it's not fine dining, but it's not that bad, either."
nana s.,"El Cajon, CA",0,4,3,1.0,1/27/2010,"This was our first visit to Applebee's.  We both ordered the 550 calorie steak.  While the steak was tender and not fatty, the rest was so-so.   The whole place was so horrendously, unbelievably loud that we could not hear ourselves think, much less enjoy the dinner.   We decided not to ever go there again."
Cheeki G.,"San Diego, CA",9,112,10,2.0,12/2/2011,"The host was nice and seated us at a booth as requested.  Our server was attentive and very pleasant.  The boneless wings looked like small chicken balls not wings.  I wanted a summery salad.  I loved their California shrimp salad, but they got rid of it.  I don't get it, that was a such a great salad.  They probably got rid of it, because it was made with buttered lettuce which is way more expensive than romaine.  Down sizing sucks.  My boyfriend pointed out the mess under the table across from us and how a server seated people next to it instead of sweeping the floor.  The server suggested the Santa Fe Salad.  It looked lively with guacamole, salsa and multicolored tortilla strips, but it failed miserably.  My handsome boyfriend got the orange chicken bowl and he said it wasn't very good.  He lovingly gave me a bite and there was not much flavor to the orange chicken.  The food quality has gone downhill.  Wake up Applebee's!  Now that you remodeled your building, put all your effort into making your food taste better!"
Odie O.,"San Diego, CA",2,1003,63,3.0,9/13/2007,"When you're in El Cajon theres not alot of choices and when its late they used to have half price appetizers. The decor leaves a lot to be desired, somebody thinks we're still in the 80's in a sportsbar"
B R.,"El Cajon, CA",58,26,3,1.0,7/25/2011,"I used to really enjoy Applebee's but for some reason they just aren't good anymore.  Today my wife and I went there to enjoy some cool A/C while having lunch.  When we walked in, we were greeted by the aroma of old, stale beer which was so overwhelming we almost left.  But the host was nice so we figured we could stick around.  Our server greeted us and was prompt with cold drinks for us.  We ordered cheese stuffed meatballs for an appetizer and when they came out, they were cold.  Not cold like they had been left out too long but cold like they had been frozen and not reheated thoroughly!  So we asked our very apologetic server to replace them with cooked ones and she returned with another plate.  Again they were cold, just not as cold as before.  We moved on to our lunch entrees which included the cowboy burger and a chicken parmesean pasta.  The pasta was bland and the cowboy burger had more grilled onions than beef!  Again, the server was polite and if I could offer her any advice, I would suggest she find another restaurant to work for as this place is surely awful and should be put out of its misery soon!"
Bob D.,"Bellingham, WA",5,29,,2.0,1/8/2009,We've gone here many times over the years and it seems the quality of the food has gone a bit downhill. Service was pleasant but the food was just bland.
