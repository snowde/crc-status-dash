Jon B.,"La Mesa, CA",45,146,49,1.0,8/17/2011,"There's a reason this place is so poorly reviewed:  barely mediocre food and horrible service. A friend wanted to come, I hadn't been in years because I remembered their service. Disappointed to see that things hadn't changed....took a while to get  drinks and when we did my mango iced tea was regular iced tea, my chips for my appetizer were completely stale, and took them 10 minutes to bring me new ones(hardly any better). We asked for napkins twice and never got them, asked for silverware twice before getting it,  and then our server was apparently incompetent because when I broke down the bill to him between 2 cards in even amounts, he comes back baffled and having put random amounts on each that were NOT what I had just told him to do. then he has to take them back to fix it and we end up waiting 10 minutes for him to fix his mistake and after that he STILL gets it wrong. By this point my friends were over it and we decided wed reconcile it later but we just wanted to get out of there. Never going back as long as I can help it."

Roseann S.,"El Cajon, CA",84,81,6,1.0,7/29/2008,"we went here to enjoy a late night dinner with a friend who came in from out of town. we walked in with no problem, but the hostess and waitress were horrible. the hostess asked ""how many"" we reply 3 plus a stroller, and she goes, ""u need a high-chair"" we reply ""we just need a place with room"" and then she sits us where the table was clearly too high for even the baby to see us. we were seated before a family of 6 and they got served first with drinks and menus..how lame. then when we ordered a cup of milk, it never came. we decided to move so we can actually have a high chair, then we finally asked again, where's the milk? it took them 20 minutes. i was not impressed with the service at all. food was alright, wasn't in the mood after such a horrible experience with the first waitress and hostess."
