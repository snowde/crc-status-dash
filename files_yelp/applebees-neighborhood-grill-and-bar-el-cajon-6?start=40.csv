Crystal B.,"Kihei, HI",239,342,475,3.0,1/11/2015,"Just okay. Met up with the in laws last night for dinner. We had to wait 20 minutes so we went to the bar. We were served drinks right away and watched the Seahawks game. I was almost half way done with my drink and still no table. I saw an open booth at the bar area & asked mother if we should move there. She sent her husband over to remind them about us. We were sa right away haha, they must have forgot about us. We ordered the two for 25 which included an appetizer. We got mozeralla sticks and both ordered half ravk,. I got honey BBQ and he got chipotle.  In laws ordered two Cesar salads, grilled fish and riblets. She was disappointed at the size of the riblets and thought they were like the ones we ordered. They only liked the salads. Our meal was good, we both scarfed ours down. He even liked the chipotle sauce and trust me, he is hard to please!"
Valerie T.,"National City, CA",10,30,30,5.0,4/29/2016,"The food was good, as usual. We made a few mistakes with our order, but our server, Adrian, quickly and happily correct the problems.  After we left, I realized I forgot my credit card. I called Applebee's and talked to Adrian and he made sure the manager had my card.   I'm very happy for honest people."
K A A.,"La Mesa, CA",0,4,,2.0,10/8/2016,"The wait service is very good and welcoming  ... The corporate designed menu tasty --  BUT the kitchen execution is  v. poor --  this was my 3rd try for the grilled pork chops  -- an epic fail.... Overcooked AGAIN--   (Was comped by mgr. the 2nd time there so i thought to give it another try -- wrong)  Pork Chop chard on one side  --but better side presented ? How can u serve  burnt /over cooked  pork chop /food to ur customers ??  really ?  Someone is asleep at that grill !  Or is a  very untalented  cook  The chop was difficult to cut    (Table shook) Huh ?  Definitely not a good cook at the helm??   The broccoli was tasty but   n mash potatoes  tasty But were lumpy / pasty  The small brownie bite  dessert was  a  "" microwave brick "" and ice cream half melted when served.  What? --  servers pass that on to paying customers ? --obviously no quality control  in this place   --what a waste of my $$, time  & the food itself   !  Stick to salads  at this Applebees  --or drink a lot of cocktails  so u r oblivious us to ur meal  ?"
Jack M.,"San Diego, CA",5000,4064,27983,3.0,11/16/2014,"I was craving a grilled cheese and I heard Applebee's offered a four cheese grill offered with so basil tomato soup. I ordered that, and a bar bite size wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon.  The wedge arrived first and it was a very good size for a $5 bar bite ( ). This was a good deal and tasted quite good. The ice berg was fresh and crisp and the bacon crunchy and flavorful. Once I got through the top layer, it did need a little more blue cheese dressing, but it was not a big deal since you can get more on the side ( ). I would order this again, but I would suggest they offer fresh cracked black pepper with the salad.  The Four Cheese Grille was good, but it arrived as if it was sitting at the pass a little to long because the bread was lukewarm and the cheese had already started to congeal ( ). It tasted very good, especially all the four cheeses together, but I rather of eaten it piping hot with cheese actively slowly dripping out, not stationary ( ). Nevertheless, the grilled cheese was great for dipping in the thick and tasty tomato basil soup ( ). The cup of soup came with some good croutons and the soup was thicker than most and quite good ( ).  Sarah, my server was great. She was very friendly and appropriately attentive. She brought me more hot water for my tea and gave me some insight about their happy specials and such. This would easily been a four star review if that grilled cheese would of arrived at the right temp."
Allison M.,"El Cajon, CA",0,1,,2.0,5/18/2017,"We barely saw our waitress last night and it took about twenty five minutes to bring our drinks. Also about 30 minutes for our mozzarella sticks. Finally got our dinner probably an hour after we had arrived, and our fries were old. Definitely not coming back here! Only reason they get two stars is because the mozzarella sticks were tasty."
Bruce P.,"Santee, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/6/2017,Took my wife and daughters here. None of really liked our meals. Hamburger was over cooked. My wife's chicken seemed like it was frozen. Steak was over cooked. One of the meals had no flavor. Staff was cool.
Michele G.,"El Cajon, CA",30,5,,2.0,4/3/2017,We had the worst service tonight.  Waitress was almost non- existent.  15 minutes to get a drink and almost finished my meal before they brought the ranch I asked for.  The table next to us had to send their steak back.
Otis O.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/28/2017,"I stopped at Applebee's after a movie with my girlfriend,cousin and her husband on 2.26.17 . We arrived at 10 pm or so for some drinks and food. There must have been maybe  18 people inside. We ordered drinks and an apettaizer, when we decided to asked for some small plates, the top plate looked clean but the rest still had food on them from previous use. So, we decided not to use the plates and proceed to use the silverware and unfortunately the same thing happened. Then we just decide to finish up with our drinks and call it a night. Plates and silverware looked like the might have gone through a simple rinse, but definitely not washed. Was expecting for the waiter to maybe ask if everything was ok since we still had menu's at the table, that wasn't the case."
Mayzie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,29,6,5.0,7/28/2016,Whoa!! Food is absolutely delicious!!! And the bartender Jenny is awesome!! ;) I only wish I lived closer is come here more often!
Lupita L.,"San Diego, CA",0,12,3,5.0,8/12/2016,Jenny and Robert the bartenders are great.  We always have fun when we go. They alway help me find options on what I can eat since  I'm a vegetarian.
Allison B.,"Bridgeport, CT",132,8,2,5.0,7/29/2016,"Food and service were excellent. We were traveling and got take-out the first night and liked it so much we went back the next night to sit with the awesome bartender, Jenny, and enjoy another meal! Salmon, Bourbon chicken, and Mac n' Cheese with chicken tenders were !!"
Melissa M.,"Jamul, CA",20,6,3,1.0,3/31/2016,Should be zero stars . Was there on March 15 2016. With my daughter and it was her 10th bday. I asked Robert our server to have the staff sing happy bday to my daughter and he rolled his eyes and said okay. My steak was super salty. Taylor loved her shrimp which was good since it was her bday! Well Robert wasn't very friendly. He was much like a stick up woman. He never would have the crew come sing happy bday and not once did he refill or drinks. I thought about not tipping him but then I would be bringing myself down to his level so I gave him his 15 percent! Took my other daughter to black angus and had wonderful service and gave that waitress who was amazing a $50 for making my daughters bday rock! Thanks for nothing Robert. And just FYI you should try to be less stuck up!
Carole I.,"Santee, CA",123,13,,5.0,7/2/2016,"Had a late night dinner last night w my Bf. Came in around 10:30. Erika was our server. She was so attentive. When we were just getting to the end of our spinach artichoke appetizer and out of chips, I was thinking to myself, ""it would be nice to have a couple more chips to get the last of this dip out."" I had the munchies big time. Less than a minute later, she swoops by and asks if we want more chips. Wow...yeah!  She checked in on us all through the steps of our 2/$20 deal. We got a couple of Bloody Mary's too. They were pretty good. The food was very salty and seasoned, but that's the type of food these places offer. Didn't stop us from eating most of our entrees.  My guy and I did notice the weird stuff on the walls in there. It looks like blown up photos from events around town. We were sitting under a framed and spotlighted picture of 3 young girls at a game. No older than 10. One front and center screaming w her mouth wide open and 2 behind wincing. Just a weird choice for wall art! It wasn't a great picture or anything.  Anyway, Erika really exceeded our expectations of service. We left feeling satisfied and taken care of."
Andrew R.,"Riverside, CA",121,129,59,5.0,9/28/2015,I've cone here a lot and never am I disappointed. Applebee's has great food and even better drinks. Its family oriented but always has a pretty cool bar crowd.
Ron Ulysses Swanson S.,"Pine Valley, CA",2,45,,3.0,8/5/2015,"Eh it's Applebee's, it falls somewhere below great and above Chili's. The food is decent and they have good prices and the atmosphere is very corporate but they make sure to give it a local feel as well. I'm guessing they have cheap alcohol as the bar is usually kicking at 1pm on a weekday afternoon. Ron Swanson"
Gina R.,"Lakeside, CA",1,5,1,3.0,2/21/2016,The ribs were good but they could have been more  meaty  Price is good beer was good but the bathroom smells like apples so I guess that's a good thing. Waiter and he was nice
David D.,"Santee, CA",6,8,,5.0,7/9/2016,I ordered my food to go. It was ready in 15 min as was told when I ordered over the phone. I ordered the pork chops with apple chutney. It was absolutely yummy. It was cooked to perfection and the apple gave the meat a nice flavor. What is more the side dishes that I ordered were very good also. It was not that expensive $16.82 with taxes. The restaurant was packed with people so I was happy I ordered to go. I didn't have to wait any additional time despite all the people inside.
Freya F.,"El Cajon, CA",0,17,1,4.0,7/8/2016,I love Applebee's! They have a lot of good meals for under 600 cal. I use them for to go orders all the time.
Stacie S.,"San Diego, CA",11,43,3,3.0,8/5/2015,The temperature ( cold) and the extremely noisy loud rap music (dj screeching) playing overhead made it impossible to enjoy our dinner.  The new menu is enticing but I'm here for dinner not to dance.
C. I.,"Ontario, CA",2,50,57,1.0,4/11/2014,"Simply, stay away... Bland food, filthy oil, & vinegar bottles for the salad.... Just bad..... That's to bad, because i feel bad for giving this review, but Yelp is about honest reviews...... Employees only do what's allowed by their management, and they only do what district managers fail to point out.... sorry for this review....."
