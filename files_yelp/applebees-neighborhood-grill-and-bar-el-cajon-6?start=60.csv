Leslie P.,"Lakeside, CA",0,9,,1.0,1/3/2017,"For the price, this was utterly disappointing. To feed my family of 4, we spent $55.00 and the food quality was incredibly lacking. My husband's meal that was supposed to be 8 oz sirloin with mashed potatoes was basically 2 small steak medallions that were over cooked and very grisly. The ""mashed potatoes"" were really just potato flakes with lumps (maybe a mixture of real potatoes and fake?) My mac-n-cheese with honey pepper chicken meal was all-around gross and I couldn't even finish it - it's definitely not made with real, fresh cheese and the chicken was tough. My 11 year old son said his burger tasted OK, though. I don't understand why people continue to come back here with as bad as the food is, especially for the price. It's not fresh at all, and it's over-salted. Applebee's is just a glorified fast food chain. You're better off going to your neighborhood Jack-in-the-Box. We'll definitely stay clear of this place in the future."
Kerrie L.,"El Cajon, CA",28,25,,2.0,2/24/2016,"Our server was less than stellar.  Not able or willing to figure out how to remove jalepenos from our menu choice.  Did not ask how i wanted my steak cooked, put the check down and never asked if we wanted desert, took the check without noticing our empty glass.  Steak came very,  very overcooked and tough. (not her fault) Probably won't go back."
Jeremy R.,"San Diego, CA",0,31,3,1.0,11/19/2016,Horrible service. Our appetizer never came out. The chicken tenders were more like nuggets and the sodas were flat. NEVER AGAIN!
Chris B.,"Bonita, CA",2,10,,3.0,7/26/2015,"3 star for atmosphere . Ribs are dry dry..... Stay away. Not fresh can you believe it. You would think they made it fresh every day no. The steak keeps getting thiner an thinner each time I go. We are not going back. I will keep reading review , but if it keeps going like it is. I will not return. Drinks at the bar great, that's about it."
Jerry V.,"San Diego, CA",1,6,38,1.0,12/17/2015,"Horrible service, constantly asking for refills. Food came out cold, asked for a-1 sauce for my steak finished meal before receiving a-1 sauce. Never coming back"
James M.,"Florida City, FL",0,28,18,5.0,5/7/2016,"Here to celebrate a birthday. Boneless wings as an app., pass on this one, kinda bland tasting chicken with ranch/hot sauce on the side. Wedge salad was 1st rate, as good as I've ever tasted at any restaurant. The Burbon chicken shrimp was sizzling many minutes after it was delivered and did not disappoint! Very good flavor and texture throughout. Attention salmon lovers: my cedar plank salmon was again, one of the best I've ever tasted. Service was excellent as Andy did a great job and very accommodating. Hostess was also great in getting a booth for us and kept us updated every few minutes as to our status and seated us very quickly vs the 15-20 min wait originally quoted. Would recommend. Clean nice atmosphere with many tv screens and table game console."
Mrs W.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,29,20,1.0,5/4/2016,"Me and a friend sat at the bar ordered I drink, as soon as the drink came she put the tab on the bar? I mean can I get a appetizer? Another drink I mean you are trying to make money right?? Horrible customer service"
Anna M.,"El Cajon, CA",13,31,2,2.0,12/6/2015,I only gave it 2 stars because the server was good. The food was not good. My son and I ordered from the 2 for $20 and both him and I were very disappointed.
Christopher S.,"La Mesa, CA",32,91,5,2.0,2/2/2015,"Ummmmhmmm were to start. First let's start on the quality of the food. ho, the food was horrible. But for a chain restaurant you would expect some decency is their taste. There is no flavor in their food , just a lot of dirty oil that should proabaly be cleaned (if your food was deep fried).  Second the service was disgusting , the waiter would not smile . Every time he would come to our table it was as if he was upset to be working. It came to the point were we felt as if he was mad at the world and could be tainting the food. The only reason I gave them a two  star was the fact their manager was super nice and super sweet. But this is not enough to make me ever wanna come back to this establishment or any of their chain reasturant as well.  All in all I don't know how this location is still in business it should be closed, but I guess some people don't know what a standard of decent service is."
melissa g.,"Santee, CA",7,19,4,5.0,10/9/2015,"Currently sitting in Robert's section, we haven't even received our appetizers yet and I had to post this, my friend is a margarita snob and Robert has run back and forth to the bar three times to gather items to help create the perfect margarita for him. He is amazing and a great communicator, way to go Robert, now don't screw up our meal ;-)"
Dan P.,"San Diego, CA",25,43,11,4.0,2/3/2016,"While their appetizers were lacking, their burgers are pretty damn good! I was fairly impressed during my last visit both with the service and food quality."
Rick G.,"El Cajon, CA",192,5,,5.0,3/16/2016,Happy hour Power! The happy hour bartenders are awesome and always take care of us! Food is amazing and Mazshed Potatos are HEAVENLY!!!!
Dave T.,"Carlsbad, CA",31,18,2,5.0,1/15/2016,We have been here about 30 times. We try to get table #10. Our waiter today was Nick. He was great. He had good knowledge of the menu and took care of all our needs. We like the tabletop method to pay the bill. Makes it easy for everyone. We will be back again.
Phennie F.,"San Diego, CA",0,21,,2.0,1/10/2016,"I haven't gone to Applebee's in a few years, decided to give it a shot. The food didn't meet my expectations. The customer  service  Was  great"
Sally B.,"Escondido, CA",0,18,,1.0,4/10/2016,"Took my daughter here today. Ordered the 2 @ $25. Drinks came quickly. The spinach dip was good but the chips were stale. Our waitress (long blonde straight hair. Cant recall her name) didn't check back with us so when the food runner brought our entrees, we asked for fresh chips. They were stale as well. The fiesta lime chicken was not quite done and the rice was dry & tasteless. The place was not busy. Lots of empty tables. When we were done, the waitress finally came around & asked if we would like more to drink. Rather late on that. I have had this same dinner at the applebees in escondido and it was delicious and attentive service too. If you're in el cajon, try chili's. They have the 2 @ $20. Great food and great service at chili's."
Mo S.,"Santee, CA",38,101,36,4.0,6/11/2015,We came in on a whim one night with the kids. We were seated right away. We put in our orders and the food came out rather quick. My daughter started to eat her food and turns out she didn't really like it. The server noticed and was very kind and asked what else my daughter would like. She brought it as soon as she could. Now that's excellent service. The food was good but the service was superb. Not what I expected either. We will be back.
Mandy B.,"Johnson City, TN",2,48,14,4.0,7/18/2016,I love carside to go. It comes in handy when you don't want fast food and you have kids that want to go home. The app is great when it's working and the staff is always friendly. I'm giving this 4 stars because I don't always get silverware or napkins in my bag. The food is always on point for a decent price.
Julie C.,"Lakeside, CA",66,7,,1.0,8/17/2015,Went in on Saturday night they told us the fryer was broken that was fine it was slow so we expected the service would be fast and good since there were not a lot of tables.  Wrong the hostess had friends sitting at the bar socializing our waitress kept disappearing and when I ordered another drink I saw it sitting for 10 minutes at the bar another waitress picked it up I thought good she is bringing it nope she walked in the back with it and came back out with my waitress handed it her and was laughing.  Poor service with staff that doesn't care socializing is more important than guests the food was ok my sons Mac n cheese was over cooked and didn't seem fresh kinda sad when u mess up Mac n cheese with a broken fryer they should have plenty of time to make it fresh.. Will not go back sad used to be my favorite place sucks now
Vicki E.,"Brawley, CA",82,201,62,2.0,9/19/2015,"Typical chain restaurant fare. Took over 30 minutes to get out our lunch combos, which were soup and a sandwich and soup and pasta. Background music a tad too loud. Food was nice and hot once it was served, but won't be in a hurry to return."
Kandice L.,"Lakeside, CA",0,2,,4.0,7/23/2016,Having a great time bar staff is on point! Food is great even pleased a picky eater!!! Shelby and Jenny thankx so much for a fun night.
