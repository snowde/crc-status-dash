Alissa A.,"El Cajon, CA",49,18,9,3.0,12/4/2015,I like their drinks & deserts. Food often looks better than it tastes. Lots of good seating locations. Staff is Ok. Sports channel always on (@bar).
Linda J.,"San Diego, CA",738,911,4236,2.0,11/24/2012,"We started with drinks, a Mountain Dew and a water with lemon please? We asked from our waitress Savonne B. and the drinks were brought out promptly.  I want to start with telling you how awesome this waitress really was.  If I had to hire someone I would really hire her!  So, the first drink came with something that was a small black ball that was not really floating at the bottom of the soda glass.  I took a picture and posted it immediately.  When we told Savonne she apologized profusely promising to bring us another soda which arrived in a minimal amount of time.  The second Mountain Dew was presented and right when a sip was about to be taken we noticed a bug at the top of the glass.  Really? Again?  I could not believe this!  Savonne apologized again and then said she would have the manager come over and he did.  Jamie T. came over and announced who he was.  I was pretty shocked at him saying that we requested him to come over which we did not.  We told him the problem and he said he would check on that immediately and appreciated our feedback.  Sometimes things happen in restaurants right?  Meanwhile, our meals were brought out.  I ordered the Lemon Shrimp Fettuccine~Seared plump shrimp, ripe tomatoes, onions, sautéed fresh spinach and basil served over fettuccine noodles lightly tossed in a roasted garlic cream sauce and topped with artichokes, lemon zest and Parmesan.  My man ordered the Sizzling steak fajitas~Served with lettuce, sour cream, pico de gallo, rice, sautéed onions & red peppers, fire roasted poblanos and white cheddar. Steak and Chicken.  My dish looked wonderful.  My man's plate did not have the Chicken that was ordered and the rice that was served was burning on the hot plate.  So again, we had to find Savonne to let her know yet something else has gone wrong.  Jaime brought out the chicken about 5 minutes later.  As I was eating I also noticed that my silverware was really dirty but at this point I am so drained from complaining and it was almost time for our movie that I needed to order an Appletini.  I have never had one before and NOW seemed like a great time for one.  The drink was really fruity and had a nice taste to it and I can now say that I have had one.  I would never order it again but that is no fault to Applebee's.  The cool part about the drink was the carved out pieces of apple on a small sword~ I liked that.  The manager Jaime came back to advise us that they found the source of the bugs at the tap of the Mountain Dew spout and that it has now been resolved which was pretty cool.   Yes, we ate the food and it was actually really good considering the shortcomings that came previously.  Savonne came over to offer us a ""Sunday dessert shooter"" for the inconvience to which we decided to pass on.   If you read my reviews I am not very nice and will tell it like it is.  Long story made midsize, lol is that the food was great once they got it right.  The service was wonderful from both the waitress and the manager however I have never sat at home saying ""ooh I want to go and eat at blah blah because their service is great and the food is good but everything else is dirty except the bathrooms!""  I think that they may need to have Bar Rescue come in to explain how to not stack glasses so that they are not dirty at the rim of the glasses and how to keep the bugs out. PS: The bathrooms were really clean and they do have a diaper changing station in the ladies.  I also liked the fact that they sponser local sports teams and have their pictures all over the walls.  They have more than just sports stuff showing on the Tv's.  I had to give this a 2 star because of the filth and the wrong orders coming out.  Otherwise this could have been a 4 or 5!"
Mar C.,"El Cajon, CA",0,7,,2.0,7/16/2016,My chicken entree came out cold I had to send it back. My waiter was very good and apologized that's why I gave the two stars. The manager brought me my new chicken after the rest of my party was almost finished with their food. By that time I was done I took it home. No one offered a percentage off or a comp. I will not be going back to this establishment again.
Steve K.,"Santee, CA",0,14,,1.0,3/20/2016,"The perfect margarita is an $9 drink that is approx 9 oz. Do not buy one, go to Chilis and get the El Niño"
Robert N.,"El Cajon, CA",9,7,1,5.0,10/8/2015,"Thursday night football!!!!! Tnf  haha, great night to come out to applebees  and watch the game and get some great food and have fun, the bartender Jenny and manager Rebecca  made the night memorable!! Laughs non stop, drinks were on point,Food delicious.  They both made it feel like the neighborhood  came out to applebees  and  was here having a great time. Angela also was quick with the food and made great suggestions  for some drinks  also.  Definitely  a good spot to come out too on a Thursday  night!"
Laurie F.,"La Mesa, CA",23,14,2,5.0,10/5/2015,"I had the grilled sandwich and 4 cheese macaroni. It was delicious, rich, perfectly seasoned. Then I added a brownie bite for 1.49. Unbeatable lunch!! The service was good too. The waiter and managers work as a team."
Rose P.,"Downey, CA",0,33,,1.0,7/3/2015,Service is really bad. Waited 10 min for water refill. Brought our food but no utensils.  Servers are rude.  Came here for a weekend getaway. I'm happier at my Norwalk Applebees!! GRRRRRR! never come here again.
Jeneva C.,"San Diego, CA",10,134,85,1.0,5/21/2015,Went here for a late night last minute bite to eat with my husband. He wasnt hungry so only I ate. Cant mess up one dish right? Wrong! I ordered the most simple thing on the menu which is all I get any and everywhere. Chicken tenders! So we were there at around 830 so it wasn't too busy.  Seated fast and I ordered.  Got the plate of food in literally 5-7minutes. I was in shock. I even said Wow that was fast and the kid said yup thats applebees. I said yea but is it fresh. Anyways so the fries were hot and fresh so I figured wow maybe they are just fast. NO! My chicken yes was hot very hot but CHEWY!! like jerky. I told my waitress but figured ehhh ill just eat it bc I was hungry and it was late.  After trying each other piece I realized it was all 3 pieces. I told her I wanted to change it and she was nice but gave me rebuttles for everything I said. Even had the nerve to say well thats how tenders are cut so they're supposed to be chewy!!! Im sorry miss but I have had chicken strips at every place even down to red lobster and cheesecake factory. Not to mention my husband was a butcher for 10 yrs so yes I know how tenders are cut dear!!! I was beyond shocked that she was trying to even justify them... i said forget it ill eat them!! She sent the manager over for IDK what but he was more apologetic but again at that point I had eaten half the chewy chicken. I came to realize that maybe they tossed them back in the fryer which is why they were hot but probably why they were so overcooked and served so fast! I was craving what I went in for which was desert so I still ordered it. Thats the only reason this place is even getting any stars. I figured I wouldve been comped the nasty chicken or even a free soda sheesh but nope not a second look. Therefore the bad review. You're welcome Applebees!! No wonder your yelp score is so low... learn from it bc you'll lose alot of customers.
Blair C.,"San Diego, CA",151,61,130,2.0,4/2/2015,"Sad to actually go back and write another review after giving them 5 stars before. That first time we went there it was truly amazing, delicious and like no Applebee's we had ever had. We went back two more time and both times the food was below par. Don't know how it fell so far from what we had had that first time. The macaroni was gross and watery and the sandwich my boyfriend got was alright but my food was just gross. The service was great there and the waitresses are very sweet. Not to be a pain or try to just get something free, I let our server know how soft and watery my food was and that was the reason I didn't really eat much. I just told her to let her know so maybe they could tell the chef whatever he was doing it was not good. The manager was nice and offered a free desert but I had no appetite for anything else and neither did my boyfriend. So he took half off the pasta. Which is nice but honestly all I want is to let them know the quality of their food has sadly and drastically dropped. After those two times we went after my first review we really haven't gone back. It was so gross I would just rather spent my money elsewhere so it's a shame."
Bobby R.,"La Mesa, CA",1,26,,5.0,10/31/2015,"Came in on Halloween night and was taken care of by a great waitress named Melanie. She was friendly, funny, fast and just a pleasure to talk with. I also spoke to the manager, Reggie. Nice guy. Great restaurant, great food. We'll be back next time we visit San Diego."
Sarah M.,"Santee, CA",19,15,5,3.0,2/4/2016,"Took my two grown boys and their father there for his birthday on a Sunday afternoon.  The server was nice enough, but the food was not hot enough.  I don't know why they don't keep it warm for service.  It was as if mine was done first so parts of it were left to wait for the rest of the food to be made.  I had the riblets with chipotle and it had no flavor whatsoever, so I ordered regular bbq sauce, which I found to be too spicy.  The riblets were good, just enough meat for me.  We had the spinach dip appetizer, and it seems a lot smaller than it used to be, as the dip goes.  I didn't like how the server did not come back to check on our food within five minutes, I had to wait a while while my food got cold to ask for the sauce, and more water.  I do restaurant secret shopper reviews as a side job and this place really needs to employ such a service, if they do not already, and use it to make some improvements.  I understand it was a busy time of day but when we got there there was no one else waiting so it wasn't terribly busy.  I did like that the server didn't forget special requests that were made, and let us move to a larger table when one came available, as we were really cramped in a booth.  I would have given it 4 stars if the food had been warmer and the service more frequent.  Not bad for the price, overall."
Crystal K.,"Jamul, CA",18,61,15,2.0,1/12/2015,"I'm not even going to rate the food quality. Its a chain restaurant with discount specials and international commercials.  This is for the ridiculous pricing policy on their happy hour menu.  Not sure if its a corporate decision or a local management one.... Anyways, came in with a group of five. Was seated and noticed that Happy Hour included all NFL games. It was the 1st quarter of the Seattle/Carolina playoffs so we asked our server if we could get the HH prices on our drinks. He informed us it was for bar only but we could buy at the bar and bring them to our seats. Bartender said no have to drink them in the bar area but that the bar area included all the seated tables surrounding the bar and to just ask the server for HH pricing. So again ask the server for HH pricing and told our table wasn't in the bar... So the table 4 feet next to us is and our table isn't??? Yeap. So you want to double charge us because our seats are 4 feet away from the other table? Yeap. We ended up moving and then the hostess informs us that its not Happy Hour after all. We pointed out the menus that stated all NFL games included HH pricing and we couldn't help but notice the blaring playoff game showing from every corner. Oh sorry yeah we'll give you the correct price.  So all in all, you may be paying full price while the table next to yours is getting them half off.... And NO ONE there knows what the policy is."
Ken D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,4,1,2.0,8/13/2015,I've been sitting here 10 minutes already and no drinks the bartender just doesn't care to busy serving people that are ordering mixed drinks to worry about my diet coke I hope my food is good
Nicole N.,"El Cajon, CA",17,5,6,1.0,3/6/2015,"My fiancee and I came here for dinner tonight since we live in the neighborhood and got a gift card as a 'congrats on your new home' gift. 25 minute wait on a Friday night was expected. The menu had a fair amount of variety but nothing looked fabulous. We got the 2 for $20 steaks and cesar salads and decided to try the new brisket nachos. The cocktail I ordered never arrived, the nachos were just ok, the salad plates were covered in old food (quite literally my plate had what looked like ground beef all over it with my salad on top) and the server never came to check on us. We had to keep stopping people walking by for refills or utensils. The best part of our visit was the $5 discount we got because of the dirty plates."
Ashley N.,"San Diego, CA",8,44,7,5.0,4/12/2015,Love Applebee's new food selections. I was disappointed to find the Hazard Center ABs shutdown but happu to find a close one by my house. I received positive customer service here. I enjoyed my server. I can't wait to come back.
Michelle M.,"El Cajon, CA",46,140,16,1.0,8/25/2013,"Horrible experience last night.  Last time I went to Applebee's they had big juicy angus cheeseburgers that were full of flavor.  Tonight I get a small burger, no flavor, dry, the cheese tasted processed, the bun ended up soggy.  My cheeseburger in paradise dreams were dashed!  I've been craving a cheeseburger on my diet for so long and I can't believe I blew my diet for this!  Never to return.  The food got cold in a hurry too, they didn't give you that many fries either.  Not worth the price!  Even my iced tea was weak.  The service was very slow too.  Just a bummer all around.   PS. I stated I wanted a well done burger because I didn't want any pinkness inside and the waitress stated they are all well done.  She was wrong, there was pink in mine!"
Glenn C.,"El Cajon, CA",25,100,38,3.0,3/1/2012,"We have eaten here on a regular basis since we first heard of their Veteran's Day special two years ago. Free meal to all veteran's on Veteran's  We typically eat here for lunch, but sometimes dinner. The service has always been excellent. Wheneating at a chain such as this, we usually don' t go with expectations of a gourmet meal. We have always gotten a good meal at a good price....and will continue to patronize it."
Mike T.,"San Diego, CA",1,8,18,1.0,8/10/2015,"This is where I'm coming from. If I come to your establishment, move my schedule to eat with my family, you better make it worth my time. Your standards need to be high because I'm eating food that you are serving.  Before I even walk in, you need to convince me that your restaurant is worth the effort. It's all perception. As I read these 5 star reviews, I can't help but think the managers friends have been asked to review this restaurant. Maybe the locals at the bar have been asked to post a positive review, but I just didn't see it. I don't even want you to give me a refund of my money or a discount. Because of that point, it's too late. Just get it right the first time so you don't have to make excuses about how you screwed it up! The last time we were at this Applebee's was almost a year ago.  The reason why we had not returned was because of the service and substandard food.  I know that sometimes people have bad days, but you don't let it affect your work. We decided to give them a second try, maybe after year things have changed. Well, nothing has. We where made to wait when there where tables avalible. We were sat at tables we could have been seated in 15 minutes ago. They seem to have a lack of staff/servers, not my problem. Server appologised for entering other tables data first. I asked twice for the same drink order. Appetizers came out with no plates presented from manager There was minimal table maintenance, beverage refills, table cleanup etc. Server looked overwhelmed. No sence on ergency from the staff. No pacing of the meal. The gap between serving kids and serving the adults was 15 min.  Warmer than room temp ranch dressing, notified server, and no attenpt to fix it. Other tables near us had issues as well so this was not an isolated incident. Mac n cheese pasta was ok. not the sauce. This looks like a management issue. After being in food service and managing food service, this is mostly about training and standards. The Applebee's in Rancho San Diego is much better, much more efficient and just better at what they do. I will not be returning to this Applebee's"
CJ E.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,,1.0,1/13/2015,"Terrible food, got a steak and it was seasoned really poorly. Half of it was over salted and the other half was heavily peppered. It was uneatable.  Chicken was rubber and greasy. It was just super terrible! Never again"
Rosy F.,"El Cajon, CA",141,158,125,4.0,12/6/2013,"This place is pretty good . However last night I was told a lie! I ordered a mudslide and the waitress brought over a huge one! I told her I wanted a regular and she was taking in back and in half a second she turns an says this is a small. -.- tsk tsk whatever I wasn't in the mood , fast forward ...my receipt showed I was being charged for a mucho (big one) , I wasnt really upset just kinda shady in my opinion. The  waitress was good other than that."
