Shruthi P.,"Jersey City, NJ",23,10,,1.0,11/22/2014,"I wish I could rate 0. The pasta was under cooked, then they took it back for cooking but not even close to fully cooked.  Then they missed my husband's order of a beer. The worst experience!!"
D A.,"North Arlington, NJ",0,51,,1.0,5/29/2016,"Awful. Service was pathetic. Tables covered in garbage and trash on the floor, despite several employees standing around doing nothing. I think we saw our waitress once. Food was ice cold. Will never return."
Mark C.,"Staten Island, NY",93,51,1,1.0,2/2/2015,"Okay, I was there on a Sunday night. I don't know who our server was but it was Puerto Rican woman. I think she might be a lesbian. And if she's a lesbian, she definitely wears the pants in the relationship. Her sexual orientation isn't a problem obviously but I need to state this so you guys know who I'm talking about. I don't think that I should have to ask my server for utensils. It should just be there when the food arrives. And please don't take your time getting me utensils so I have to eat the food when it gets cold with the utensils you were ""forced"" to get me. Asshole.  And we needed refills. I should not have to go up to the bar and ask the bartender for refills because you want to sit down THE WHOLE TIME I'M FUCKING THERE AND PLAY PATTYCAKE WITH THE OTHER WORKERS. And please do come and ask, ""how is everything?"" instead of saying, ""yo, you guys good?"". Classless. I felt sick leaving a tip."
Jayson G.,"Keasbey, NJ",1,8,,1.0,4/16/2014,"Went here 2 weeks ago and I've been dying to write about how much this apple b's sucks.  Sat to have dinner with some friends and the waiter girl came and basically laid the whole front half of her body over the table which was weird. And then every 5 mins she would come and do the same thing and ask if we needed something else. We ordered a berry sangria pitcher, when she brought it to the table I was like whoaa yess That's a lot but, there was only enough in the whole pitcher for 2 small wine glasses and a half!  The whole thing was filled to the top with ice creating the illusion of it being filled with the actual drink. She kept asking if we wanted more which was kinda annoying too. In all this has to be the worst apple b's and, restaurant in general I've ever been to in my life, I wish I would've read the reviews before coming."
Jack W.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",13,15,1,1.0,7/21/2015,"Might be the worst bartenders I have ever experienced! Bad service, slow, nasty to customers, and just downright bad attitudes! Being part of a shopping mall and close to many hotels, one would think they would bend over backwards and welcome business in an area of New Jersey surrounded by shipping containers and industrial complexes! Not so here. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!"
Diamond Y.,"Elizabeth, NJ",37,5,1,1.0,6/16/2014,"THE WORST Applebee's experience EVER! We got here around 10:40 so it was about 10 people in there TOPS. The servers are standing near the bar dancing & talking about a beach trip tomorrow took 11 minutes until someone came & took our order. Asked my husband what he wanted didn't return the favor to me strike one. Brought him his drink took off again to clean a table without even asking if we were ready to order. We ordered a chocolate meltdown it was good, can't really mess that up BUT it took another 14 minutes to get the bill, another 5 for her to take the check then the cherry on too was not bringing us back all of our change. I will NEVER go to this Applebee's again. Ghetto Gardens."
Pami G.,"Paterson, NJ",1,1,,1.0,9/26/2014,This is the worst applebees ever!!!! Never again our waitress Britney was horrible we waited 40 minutes to not even get a second drink. The whole time we were there she didnt even come to our table I had to ask another waitress for a clean fork. Yet Britney was quick to give is the check but not check on us at least once. When I did get my food it was half cold. I will never be going back to this place
LI E.,"Long Island, NY",1,9,2,1.0,3/14/2013,"I don't expect much from a chain like this, but this was a Horrible Experience!  The staff was less than friendly and hardly helpful.  They almost seemed annoyed that I was there. The food was also undercooked. An all around bad experience."
Jill W.,"Honolulu, HI",10,10,4,1.0,12/15/2013,"If I could, I would give this place NEGATIVE stars. My boyfriend and I came here to give Applebee's a try since we don't have any in Hawaii. We were seated promptly. Six waitresses walked by us several times and they just looked at us and didn't ask if we needed anything. HORRIBLE customer service. We waited 20 minutes and weren't even served water so we walked out. The hostesses at the door didn't even notice us walk out. They were too busy on their phones. We walked by about 30 minutes later and the menus were still there. DON'T EVER EAT AT THIS LOCATION."
Veronica L.,"North Arlington, NJ",30,33,,3.0,8/27/2013,"Update:  I went back to this location only because I got a BOGO coupon for my birthday for a free entree.  Though there were still no windows on the wall facing the inside of the mall, the waiter this time was a LOT better than the one we had the time before.  The food was fine.  My steak had a little too much pepper for my taste, but it was cooked to the correct temperature. It took a long time for my drink order to get to me from the bar, but when it did come, the manager brought it and apologized for the wait (I hadn't even asked about the drink yet!). The waiter wasn't 100% on-point, because I asked for some extra chips after finishing with the ones in the Spinach and Artichoke Dip appetizer (to finish the dip), and we didn't GET the chips until after dinner AND me asking again.  I'm pretty sure it was the waiter who forgot because after I reminded him, they came out of the kitchen within 5 minutes. Definitely a better experience than my first visit here, but I'd still opt for an Applebee's that's a little farther away that has better service."
Alyssa M.,"New York, NY",232,246,78,3.0,1/5/2013,"I'm not a huge fan of Applebee's to start, but relatively speaking this isn't a bad spot. It's attached to the mall so I'm sure it gets super cray around dinner/lunch time but when we came around 11pm it was empty. All of our food and drinks came out on time and everything tasted fresh. They did seat us at the back of the restaurant considering we were a pretty big party and about 7 different waiters helped us for one thing or another (I guess because we were in such an inconvenient spot?). They also only asked my boyfriend and I for ID for drinks because ""You guys look too young"", which is embarrassing when they didn't ask anyone else. However, in general, it was a pretty good experience."
Zeh R.,"Bayonne, NJ",4,9,,1.0,5/29/2013,"We came here to eat on a Sunday night when it was decently busy. We didn't have to wait long which was a plus but our dinner ended up being over two hours due to the slow and rude service. Our waitress was less than happy to be there and acted as if we were an inconvience on her night. When I asked where our lemonades were in a polite manner, she responded by saying very harshly and an eye role saying that the bartender was still making them. Would have been nice to know during one of the three times she walked passed us. The food itself was bland and the night ended with the waitress giving us a chipper fairwell. I guess she expected a night of rudeness would be rewarded with a good tip. She also forgot to give me my debit card back and I had to go back to retrieve that which was annoying. Overall, avoid this location."
Utah F.,"Mapleton, UT",2,111,4,3.0,9/26/2013,"The 550 calorie parmesan lemon shrimp was tasty but i was not a fan that it was served over rice. The appetizer trio was gross, quesadilla towers were nasty, artichoke dip was tasteless and the boneless bbq chicken strips are not worth the calories."
Leslie H.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,4,2,1.0,2/26/2014,If I can I would give this place negative 0 stars! By far the worse service I've ever had in my life. Hostess was nice and quick. Our server didn't write down our order and she claimed she didn't cause she was good at her job. She didn't give us plates or napkins for our appetizer sampler. The patron margarita tasted like water. My sizzling fajita skillet was cold and not sizzling. My fried wanted fries and mashed pots with his honey chicken and shrimp and she didn't bring it out like that! Maybe if she would of wrote it down she wouldn't of forgot! She forgot my guacamole and my wraps. Kim also charged me for the guac after not recieving it! I had to eat it like that cause she took so long. She didn't bring us refills after being asked. She brought out our brownie with NO ice cream!! And no spoons. I'm a Applebee's employee but in another location and I expected better service then this !! She was very slow and forgot us and her other tables were also complaining about her. I love going out to eat but this place needs to retrain or hire new servers and cooks ASAP! Never coming here again and most definitely will let my colleagues know not to dine in such horrible atmosphere!
Claudiu S.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,6,,1.0,12/29/2013,"Awful service. Slow, waiter didn't bring utensils until the appetizers came and we asked, didn't bring honey mustard, other servers ignored me when I tried to signal them after our server didn't come by for a while. Food was pretty good though."
