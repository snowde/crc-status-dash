Toni A.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,8,,5.0,12/29/2017,false advertisement!!! no dollaritas!!!! I think Applebee's should be a bit more clear in their advertising. I came here under false pretenses and now I am sitting here without a dollarita.  Naomi is a fantastic waitress. She is very helpful and accommodating.  I take back everything I said.
Diego P.,"Queens, NY",40,220,362,3.0,11/1/2017,Came for lunch we ordered two sangrias which were pretty good the boneless bbq chicken wings kinda dry no real chicken flavor to it the main course was butcher meat and potatoes dish and the stir fry steak with garlic mash potatoes very hearty and filling good sauce to the dishes
Jason Z.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,4,,4.0,12/27/2017,So for a birthday I came here. Ordered wonton tacos - delicious and savory. The steak was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were amazing. Tea was watery. The service was great. Overall good place.
Kieran M.,"Carrick-On-Suir, Republic of Ireland",92,13,,5.0,12/16/2017,"Went to chow down on a feast of grub with a friend last night. Got a ton of stuff. Struggled to finish it all but we put a good dent in it. Eriel was our server and was lovely, everything was great. They had $1 Long Islands which I got to take advantage of a few just before they had to close. Happy campers all in all!"
Chris L.,"REGO PARK, NY",7,65,142,4.0,2/16/2017,"I went here for lunch based on the $9.99 All in lunch special.  For $9.99, you get a choice of one of their signature burgers, a side and a drink.  What can I say?  I'm a sucker for nationally advertised food campaigns.  You probably save $5 with the lunch special versus normal prices.  I ordered they the tablet on the table.  I preferred this method over a waitress because you can more readily see what you can add or take away on your sandwich or choose as a side.   I got the brunch burger which had a fried egg, hash browns and bacon with a side of fries.  The burger was good.  It was actually done medium as I requested.  The fries were over salted but otherwise okay.  When I was done with my meal I used the tablet to pay.  It was very convenient and got me out of there quicker than waiting for my check.  I was able to be in and out within 30 minutes without feeling rushed. I'm giving the food 3 stars, 4 stars for value and 4 stars for service."
Zahra S.,"Kew Gardens, NY",0,5,,1.0,12/16/2017,"My fiancé and I came here last night 12/15 at around 8:30-9pm after a long afternoon/evening of shopping. We were HUNGRY. We usually love Applebee's and their service but this time it was a miss due to a bad apple. We stepped inside and waited by the entrance behind 2 girls who were also waiting to be seated, about 5 minutes go by and the girls are escorted by a short hostess to their seats. We continue waiting another couple of minutes and a family enters and stands  behind us on line, the hostess returns and called over the family who just entered over to their table completely bypassing us as we were standing in FRONT of that family there is no way she could've missed us. And if she was unsure about who was next why not ask? We stood there dumbfounded waiting a few more minutes for her return and then my fiancé says to her - you know you skipped us. And, her response was ""well i don't know sir they said they were next"", which was a complete lie, we saw her call them over without asking any questions. She doesn't apologize but, we let it go while she's walking us over to a table, points to it and turns around and walks away and before we get to it or get a chance to sit she's gone. We look at the seats and it's dirty, open salt or sugar packets, straw wrappers and a tissue were on the seats. Fiancé refused to sit and he said we're leaving and I was disappointed and right behind him. Short hostess saw us walking out and didn't ask us any questions.  All of that waiting for nothing. It's safe to say i will not be returning if this is how staff treats guests."
David Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,1,1.0,12/6/2017,The services are ok but the food are horrible. The boneless wings are ridiculously salty and it look like it's leftover from last week. The butcher meat and potato the beef are dry and tasteless. And the firecracker shrimp cavatappi is just like a salty Mac and cheese with dry and over seasoned shrimps.
Saksham D.,"Queens, Queens, NY",88,13,,4.0,12/1/2017,"I have ate here few times. I love the burgers and my favorite spinach dip for appetizers. I haven't tried a lot of the menu but I do like the lime chicken with rice and the quesadillas. They do have great deals as well. It is a great place to eat when you quickly decide to go out. Go ahead and give it a try, their service is great! Plus you have the mall to hang around later."
Ronnie M.,"Queens, NY",40,55,106,3.0,8/28/2017,"Food is ok, took long time for food to come, and too expensive, I don't want to pay a lot of money for food that isn't worth that much money, but I have to say the food was tasty, chicken tenders, came here few days back, thought of posting this review."
Mike B.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",165,1413,141,2.0,8/4/2016,"I don't eat here, but to grab a beer or two with coworkers after softball (we play right across the street), it's convenient and serves that purpose. and I can walk home! bartenders are decent and the draft beer selection is pretty standard. being at an Applebee's in a shopping mall is a bit too ""Real America"" for me, I'm sorry."
She J.,"Jamaica, NY",0,14,17,4.0,5/13/2017,"Usually have a decent time here,  staff is pretty friendly. Food is usually ok but occasionally you'll get ur burger pretty much raw or ur spinach dip watery if they're really busy. Drinks are good. It's in the mall so most times there is a small wait time."
Maritza E.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,,5.0,7/19/2017,A breath of fresh airafter leaving Olive Garden and their unprofessional staff..From the moment my family and I entered it was pleasant vill town. Hostess was kind and all the time had a great smile. Brian (manager) seated us and was so pleasant and had small talk with us.. wanting to know how we where doingthe service is already great and I love how attentive they all are.. as I was going to write a review noticed that they were rated a 2.. I was surprised .. I can't even imagine a 2 I recommend Applebee's (Queens mall).. and ask for Brianhe is awesome... Loving my food right now
Teresa K.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,2,,1.0,10/13/2017,They advertise $1margaritas. Well that's not case in queens center applebees. They don't participate. Very annoyed because I came here purposely for it. Never again.
Cynthia B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",59,6,,5.0,6/26/2017,"Came for a weekday lunch and the staff was wonderful! They were so friendly and attentive to all customers. There was a woman there who clearly was a regular and I noticed that all the servers would stop and chat with her, one even taking the time to sit and with her for a minute. The smile on the woman's face was priceless. I would highly recommend this location."
Melody P.,"RIDGEWOOD, NY",1,25,1,1.0,2/12/2017,They seem to think white people don't eat mushrooms or onions. The waiter looked at me like a white girl is not gonna eat bourbon chicken.
Dimple K.,"Jackson Heights, NY",56,103,4,5.0,12/3/2015,"I'm a regular here! This location has NEVER disappointed me! The food always is fresh here, and there's always a big portion of food compared to other Applebees!  The service is great here too! But just don't come here late at night, because the waiters do get a bit rude, and start putting up their chairs and trying to get you to hurry. But, the food still makes up for it here! Big portions, and always great tasting here!"
Anthony D.,"FLUSHING, NY",26,5,19,4.0,5/8/2016,"Great place for casual dining in Queens. Good food, friendly service. Great price. A bit crowded with some waiting time."
Shirley S.,"Brooklyn, NY",104,105,428,4.0,2/8/2015,"I came here with my cousin around 11am-12pm so it was empty. Even though it was empty, they made us wait 15 minutes for a table. It didn't bother my cousin and I because she wanted to shop till she drops (literally) anyways. We came back and we got our seats right away. They kept their words!  Our waitress was so nice. She kept coming back every 3-5 minutes to check up on us. I don't remember her name but she made us felt welcomed and we had a great stay. I got bbq ribs and it was amazing! I would definitely recommend their ribs mmmm. I forgot what my cousin got but I remember it was fish. She didn't like it so she mainly ate the appetizers.  I really love the interior design of this apple bee's. Their wallpaper was the history of Newtown High School. Even though Newtown High School don't have a pleasant reputation, they made the school LOOKED like a great school back in the days.  I'm hoping I'll have time to come back here. I really had a great time. I miss their food! I recommend this place to large groups. :)"
Jason C.,"New York, NY",0,37,,3.0,5/10/2016,"It's an Applebee's so nothing should really be a surprise to anyone. The food is ok. I'd stay away from having steak here though. I ordered it medium and it looked like it was cooked to medium. But the texture of the meat was dry and chewy. Stick with having ribs here. The tablet that they put on every table is good and bad. If you have a child, be careful because it's very easy for them to get to the games which tacks on $2 to your bill. But what's great about it is that you can pay directly on it. No more waiting for your server to get you the bill, wait for them to take your credit card, and wait for them to return with your credit card. Just swipe, sign, and go."
Steven P.,"Katonah, NY",0,26,59,4.0,5/18/2015,"This server s great ! He knows how to handle his table, Experience and knowledge of foods, recommend us the apt and main course they are all so good, today is no wine since long drives be back to home but I love coming back queens and stop here from r buzz."
Jennifer R.,"Ozone Park, Queens, NY",8,13,,2.0,8/20/2016,"This Applebee's needs to be cleaner and needs to hire nicer staff/waiters without nasty attitudes. The food is mediocre, and other Applebee's are better. Oh and the waiters don't even check your ID when ordering alcohol, which is beyond awful."
Shirley T.,"Brooklyn, NY",163,327,1234,2.0,1/17/2013,"The waiter was pleasantly professional and nice. Rare when it comes to these chain restaurants.  We ordered off the 2fer deal. 2 ""full size"" entrees and 1 shared appetizer. (As per their menu) Um my entree was more like a kids meal portion. Heck even my niece got more fries than I did potatoes. I ordered the bourbon chicken and shrimp with roasted potatoes, the chicken and shrimp had good flavor but the potatoes were bland and very greasy. And again - a VERY small portion. Anyway, glad I tried it.. now I know. I go to this mall all the time, so I won't be back unless it's for drinks."
Raphael R.,"New York, NY",60,27,19,1.0,1/20/2016,"I've been a regular of this place and I loved going here until my last recent visit during a hangout with my friends. First of all, we been sitting there for 30 minutes with no acknowledgement at all. Then when we ordered, the food took awhile as well. Looking around for our server to get our drinks refilled took so long because she's nowhere to be found and by the time it came, it came with the dessert. I don't really complain how long the food takes when hanging out with friends  but the moment that I had to pay on their tablet and this woman went ahead to decide how much I'll put as her tip (in that case 20%) which she does not deserve and left right away while I'm stuck on signing the tablet with my signature. I wouldn't mind tipping her that much if she deserved it, but no. Then she had the nerve to put that much tip herself?"
Emily V.,"New York, NY",63,23,12,5.0,7/22/2016,"My friend and I had a very good experience with the QCM Apple bee. The waiter was so nice and she was constantly checking up on us to see if things are okay. I forgot her name but she was super nice and pleasant. The price was really good. We go the three appetizers for 18 bucks and got the 2 entree for $27 with one size appetizer. We though it the three appetizer was a sampler, so a little bit of everything. But it came out to be three full size appetizer. My friend and I were full just with the appetizer. Good food and good service"
Rio H.,"Denver, NY",22,9,1,1.0,8/6/2016,Long wait. Poor service. Poor food quality. Not a place to go if you expecting better than that
George S.,"Forest Hills, NY",0,20,49,3.0,1/19/2016,Good fast food type of restaurant. They have good and affordable food options. We got the 2 for  $26 included 2 entrees and an appetizer. The Fiesta lime chicken is delicious and artichoke dip.
Teresa C.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,107,7,1.0,6/17/2016,Waited who knows how long for someone to come acknowledge us. Could see it was pretty packed. Eventually someone came by. I could tell it be a long day. My daughters were annoyed. Practically falling asleep. After working since the morning this shouldn't have taken so long. Ordered from the 2 for 27 menu. I ordered a quesadilla. About 20 mins later the appetizer cane with my food. Then the girls food came. Really sad. We ate just wanted to go. The waitress asked how we were I was more in an annoyed state of mind. What do you expect. This was the longest meal ever. If you can't take care of the customers you have why keep sitting them down.
Aura B.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",211,503,3684,3.0,3/27/2014,"The menu looks promising,  like multiple visits are needed to try all the meal choices. I had the Taco soup and it was very good and tasty. Then, I was very satisfied with the Chicken Quesadilla Grande. It was REALLY good and tasty, more like excellent. You know when you are trying to find a new meal with a new flavor, this was IT. It was so good that I ordered 2 of the same thing. I Absolutely  have to come back and try everything in the menu. I tried the dish with the Steak and shrimps, it was good. I did not liked that the size of the steak was too small and the shrimps were extremely salty. I down graded to 3 stars. My 4th visit, I took a special friend here on her lunch hour. They were very late in serving the food, they were not that busy. The waiter had to be called a few times because he was chatting with his co-workers and not paying attention to the tables. The food took wait too long to come so my friend had to be late back to work."
Kathie M.,"Rego Park, Queens, NY",60,10,56,5.0,7/24/2014,Happy hour is from 4PM - Close! $5 Margaritas  1/2 off appetizers what more can you ask for?
Yadi C.,"Corona, NY",7,79,51,1.0,5/14/2016,Worst Applebee's ever...especially bar section took them about 10min to even make eye contact and then it took so long to be acknowldge by the waiter who we had to call over to give us menus. When we called her over she had a very bad attitude as if she was bithered that we called her over. I was so upset I didnt orser anything at all.
Kinga S.,"Forest Hills, NY",22,48,40,2.0,3/7/2015,"One of the worst Applebee's I have been to. Came here for drinks before at the bar and it was fine so that's why I'm giving 2 stars.  The restaurant had at least 8 free tables but there was still a 20 minute wait. Waitress was rude, forgot we ordered ice tea and never brought it. Forgot we ordered appraisers so it got to our table after we got our main course.   Ordered the 2 for $20 deal, I had the chicken tender,  the chicken tenders were the size of my finger length and width wise. Very small portion.   Waitress kept looking the other way every time I wanted to hand her the check."
April F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",277,149,291,1.0,9/19/2014,"Horrible service. Hostess was unfriendly and had a puss face. Then the waitress screwed up our drink orders. Then she screwed up my boyfriends dinner order and neglected to adjust the bill accordingly.  After wasting 2 hours of my life in that ghetto hell hole our bill was in excess of $80. And for what? 2 gross cocktails that tasted like water, a salad and a sandwich, That is absolutely freaking ridiculous and obscene. We could have gone to a real restaurant and spent the same and went home with at least a buzz and satisfied tummies. NEVER AGAIN!!!! This place is gross, ghetto, trashy, the service is awful and the drinks and food are disgusting and not worth a cent. Go somewhere else!!!!"
Amy K.,"South Ozone Park, NY",24,36,4,4.0,3/12/2016,"My little son Jonathan LOVES this place. Although the service is on the slower end,we enjoy the food. The food is basic American but very tasty. The steak is very good with vegetables as sides but I've tried mostly the whole menu. Jonathan and I always get the melting molten cake, sometimes we order and ear that cake before the food....it's delicious !"
Linda L.,"Brooklyn, NY",328,18,32,2.0,1/18/2016,It was pretty affordable except the food took forever to come and we were just eating chips and salsa until we were nearly full. even refilling out drinks took forever. They didn't even clear the appetizer once the main dish came nor they did check up on us. We did the two for $20. The spinach dip was great and the salad was alright. The ribs weren't that good.
Rita S.,"Wantagh, NY",0,9,,1.0,8/13/2016,"Doesn't even deserve one star. I'm not a fan of Applebee's anyway, but walked  in there for lunch at 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon due to a family member who insisted on eating there. I used the restroom before my meal came, and it took away my appetite. DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!  I assumed it hadn't been cleaned overnight because I couldn't for the life of me believe that it could get so gross before 1pm!!!  Don't eat here unless you are really desperate. If the bathroom looked like that, I don't even want to imagine what the kitchen looks like."
Samantha R.,"RICHMOND HILL, NY",0,6,1,2.0,9/14/2015,"TERRIBLE SERVICE. Only had one server that was ever really worthy of a great tip (Jasmine). All other servers seem lazy and unprofessional; rather be socializing amongst each other than waiting on guests as they should be. The food is typical Applebee's food, no complaints there. But overall the service is 1 star. I'd suggest avoiding this Applebee's and going to one of the many other chain restaurants in the area as they all have proved to be way more worth it."
Tiff C.,"Queens, NY",92,642,796,4.0,1/13/2013,"Wasn't too busy on a weekend afternoon, oddly enough. Got seated in a booth.  Yuuum, I liked their honey bbq boneless wings. I should have ordered more to go! But the portion was smaller than expected, because it was one of those promo prices/things.  Fried shrimp platter was crispy.  Good go-to food when you're hungry and know what you're getting-- not high end or exotic food here people."
Rashid M.,"New York, NY",1097,931,572,2.0,1/5/2013,Applebee's located at the Queens Mall shopping center.  I've been here a couple of times and service is always slow. Food is like any other Applebee's restaurant.
K. M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,1,1.0,8/21/2014,"Fire the staff in the back, if haven't already!!!!!! This is a late review but I still can't get it off my mind. I went there in June with my family for a little celebration. Normally, I would go for a bacon cheeseburger but that night I decided to change it up a little and ordered a ""well done"" steak. Upon arrival it looked good but once cut opened it was red and bleeding in the middle. -_-  I DIDN'T eat it.  Now,  I am not one to really complain or send back food & have my night ruined over an uncooked steak. So, I just pushed the steak to the side and ate the potatoes. Still, wishing that I would've stuck with getting my ""norm"",  I decided to ask my waitress (Who's the only reason why this place would even be given stars) for a bacon cheeseburger to go. Before walking out my TO-GO bag was given to me  and silly me didn't even bother in checking it until the next morning.  In my defense, I always order a bacon cheeseburger at other locations and it never changes.....BOY was I WRONG! When I opened my bag the next day to reheat the burger I was shocked to find UNCOOKED French Fries and GROUND BEEF (literally) slapped in between the bun. Never have I ever experienced this at any other AppleBee's location. I am always given a patty & cooked fries! Not straight up ground beef that looked like they just pulled out of  its package and grilled for two minutes on both sides!   -What was in that bag was disgusting and a violation. Frozen fries? Uncooked Ground Beef? Who's working in the kitchen? The Health Department needs to close this location down!!!"
Shane G.,"South Ozone Park, NY",13,4,1,2.0,5/9/2014,"I have never had a great experience in Applebee's. The food portions are so small and the service is consistently mediocre. For dinner the place definitely cannot compete with any respectable restaurant. The upside of Applebee's though is the pricing. Most of the dishes are very cheap. They have combo deals and many other deals tucked away in the menu. If you work near an Applebee's it is a great place to go for break or after work for drinks. You'll end up saving more money doing that as opposed to going to any other restaurant. I'd describe Applebee's as a low quality, but low price restaurant."
