Marie D.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",103,5,,1.0,12/11/2013,"They did it again. 9oz rare steak came back raw two times..really! . Looks like it was cooked in the microwave. No grill marks and looked grey. Served in the same plate,didn't even take steak off to cook it. I asked for mashed potatoes and got rice again.  Rice looked like rice pudding with cheese mixed in.Un appetizing to even look at. The third time I got the steak back it was well done.Still in the same plate with my original first slice mark Two strikes your out...oh the fried string beans were great. That's all I landed up eating.  Microwaving a steak it a huge NO!"
Seif E.,"Maspeth, NY",0,5,,3.0,4/29/2016,Service wasn't too bad. Kind of slow but the food was decent. Nice people. its ok overall
Bruce G.,"Woodside, NY",0,7,,4.0,3/22/2016,Very good restaurant.  I come here very often and it's always very good. I would say out of 50 times maybe they're was maybe one time that it was not up to expectation as far as being taken  care of. Overall can't judge for a one time thing. It's  big place good food and very respectful workers. Good job..
Maria J.,"Flushing, NY",0,2,,3.0,1/21/2015,Sat at the bar when I went. Got the frozen margarita for happy hour. Asked for a little more touching up on the drink because it tasted like ice. Food was good and the bartenders were helpful.
Jamlen F.,"Long Island, NY",68,152,29,3.0,11/20/2014,"If I crave a burger and absolutely can't wait and can't get to any other place because applebees is two blocks away from me - then you can find me here. I haven't tried their ""smash burgers"" (ingredients like onions, pickles, and bacon are ""smashed"" into the beef so it's all mixed in), but the classic one doesn't disappoint my craving. Chicken wontons are good too.  Other than those two items, I don't come here often because.. well... it's a chain restaurant and we're in NYC where there are soooo many other places to try."
Tashi B.,"Corona, NY",8,42,1,2.0,5/4/2013,"The food was okay but expensive for the little bit of food you get. The appetizers were good but you don't get much of it. The drinks sound good in your ear and pretty on the menu but it's very watered down and for a price tag for $14 I could go walk over to BBQ's for a texas size drink for $10 and walk out stumbling and singing lol. However I LOVE the fact that they do have TV's and you can watch the game there but I just wish the drinks were a little better. Every good game deserves a great appetizer and a dope drink :)  Do I recommend it? ""Yes""... BUT only to watch the game or just during the lunch time because  you get more bang for your buck."
DK N.,"New York, NY",12,71,96,4.0,11/20/2014,Good service today. Vanessa was bar tending and I guess last time we ran into bad ones. Her and Lauren did a great job. Thx girls.
Suanyl V.,"Woodside, NY",25,22,17,1.0,10/7/2012,"THIS IS A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT... AVOID THIS APPLEBEES. First off I think writing a review on Applebees is absolutely LAME, but I feel the need to do this! If I could give this Applebees a half star I would! Their service here is horrible. They brought the appetizers together with our food which came 1 & 1/2 later. The steak was raw and not well done.  Simply terrible."
Matthew E.,"New York, NY",9,1,,4.0,11/4/2014,"I love their boneless chicken with classic buffalo sauce. It is the only reason that i gave 4 stars. Server was fine. We had couple of old people and a baby in our group. Everybody was satisfied. Because, our expectation wasn't so high from a classical American diner. The only negative thing is that steaks was not cooked how we like."
Teresa S.,"Forest Hills, NY",276,1031,2511,4.0,4/5/2013,"I havent been to this Applebees in a while I used to live in here when I first moved to Queens but has since moved on to bigger and better. LOL Nah, its a clean restaurant and staff are okay. I went in for take out and sat at the bar for my food. There were a lot of people there for the happy hour specials and if I didnt have a lot bags I wouldve stayed for it too. I ordered my riblet and fries and walked home. Food was good as usual and I would always return."
Melody P.,"New York, NY",0,9,,3.0,2/28/2015,Good quick service. Female waitresses good.  Male waitress cold and unfriendly.  Food is good. Drinks are good. Atmosphere  relaxing. Nice Saturday or Sunday afternoon lunch.
Lee R.,"Corona, NY",0,2,4,2.0,4/21/2014,"The portion sizes are really small for the prices they are at. Service takes very long, stayed waiting for a while to just order the food."
Denise R.,"Jamaica, NY",0,3,,1.0,10/3/2015,The cook was horrible... I came here for my birthday with my kids and hubby.. I called on my way to bees to make sure after 10pm the appetizer was half price Jessica answered and said yes when I get there the waitress tells me no half price finished at 7pm.. The waitress was nice but she was covering this location for the night I paid $16 for some chicken fingers and fries for my daughter the chicken fingers were soooo small and looked like the chicken was sitting out and then deep fried b4 serving we asked for 3 well done burgers.. So I thought the burgers were bloody and disgusting.. When I told the Waiter what in the world was going on she brought out one little chicken finger which looked like a chicken nugget.. I will never go back to this place...
Renee W.,"Maywood, NJ",6,2,,1.0,12/17/2013,"Absolutely awful service. It began with the hostess making me uncomfortable with the fact that I arrived by myself. I received my food quickly, but I had to ask another server for silverware. Upon receiving my drink I had to find another server for a straw. Finally , I was sat in a small dark corner when more, well lit, seating was available."
Suriyati B.,"Queens, NY",38,254,9,3.0,3/23/2012,"Mom and I tried this place again after our annual beauty day. I guess the next time around was better for us. We were seated right away, our waitress was friendly and attentive, and the food was pretty good. Overall we had a good time. Not so bad."
Rich W.,"Queens, NY",825,990,4069,1.0,6/23/2009,"Applebee Elmhurst, NY (Queens Mall)- I usually go to the Applebee in Fresh Meadow on 188 St. but since I was at the Queens Mall we stop by this Applebee for a meal.  I guess my expectation of consistency of service and quality was wrong.  There were not a lot people in the place but it took the waitress a long time to come over. Then the flatware she gave us still had food pieces from the last customer and the second set was a little better but still not clean. The waitress was annoyed with us when we asked again for another set of flatware. The salad appears to have been seating around for a while and not as fresh the other Applebee I go to. We finished our meal and went back to shopping but I will probably skip this place the next time I am hungry."
Nadir H.,"Houston, TX",80,88,15,4.0,2/15/2012,Sat nite and the service was prompt. Loved the shakes we ordered. They are running a great combo deal as well. Lots of TV and you can see them from all the angles. I loved the service. There can be a wait some times for the table but if you are fine sitting at the bar then usually you will find space.
Kristina M.,"Boynton Beach, FL",91,79,2,3.0,10/8/2011,"Theres nothing spectacular about any other major chain restaurant but because of the location, I come here pretty often. Like 3 or 4 times a month.  I usually come here for the Happy Hour special, 1/2 off appetizers and $5 alcoholic drinks but when you buy many appetizers and get that many drinks, you're just missing out on a balanced meal and spending about the same price."
Stephanie R.,"Bronx, NY",8,31,112,3.0,1/5/2014,I come here all the time after a break from shopping at the mall. The service was quick and fast. The lady who served us was really nice. This apple bees I feel is smaller then the other ones I've been too but that's just because it's in a mall. The service was really good. My boyfriend told me he was about to order another drink( lemonade) and she walked by and put a lemonade drink on the table. We didn't even see that coming. I was like is she psychic and we laughed. I like that theres deals you can choose from. We tried the 2 for 20 the food tasted great. I had the steak but I couldn't finish it was too thick and my bf had the chicken and pasta. She gave me a little container to let me take my food home. I liked that. She was a very nice person and I could tell she was working very hard. She talked to us nicely and made our stay welcoming. We'll probably keep going there just because there's good service and good deals :3
Igor Y.,"New York, NY",55,14,1,2.0,6/30/2013,I came with my family it took forever to serve our table finally they took our order and still made a mistake I was disappointed because the previous menu was change for the new menu
