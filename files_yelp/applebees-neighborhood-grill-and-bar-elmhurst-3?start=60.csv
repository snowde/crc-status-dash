Rory V.,"Flushing Meadows, Queens, NY",12,18,17,1.0,9/14/2014,"Of all the chain restaurants Applebee's is one of the better ones but not this one. I've eaten at this one a few times since it happens to be in the Queens Center Mall and let me tell you the service here is horrible.  Every time I come here I get the feeling that I'm in some kind of popularity contest and if they like you, you might get good service. I know that might sound like a little bit of a stretch of the imagination but every time I've come here there has been some customer lodging a complaint about their service. Is that a coincidence? I think not! While were there this time we witnessed the table next to us being seated right around the time we received our appetizers and they still didn't receive anything but their plates when we had finished our entire meal and my son and I are slow eaters. That's pretty bad! I'm talking about a good half an hour of waiting just to place their order. That's ridiculous! I felt bad for them. At one point I was tempted to say something but I didn't for fear of being punished by our own server who was already giving me looks of destain for having asked for a glass of water. Seriously, the people in this place need to take a class in social etiquette. We didn't even receive so much as a ""good night or thank you for coming!"", instead I said it for them hoping that I might get some response but they just looked at me as if I had three heads and all of them were green. Dah!"
Denise V.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,16,1,1.0,11/19/2012,do not order the chicken wonton tacos!!!!! I was vomitting the whole next day. NO GOOD!.
JP H.,"Rego Park, NY",41,372,1,1.0,2/26/2013,They are a hit and miss IMO. I think the best part about them are their Appi's and happy hour. Their entrees are all pretty salty so that's a turn off for me. Service is what  it is. Unhappy employees make terrible waiters. With that said I believe they have potential  to be much better. Come on guys broken chairs and hip hop over the radio? You fail...
Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",761,2185,1699,4.0,7/22/2008,"I would probably say 3.5 stars but because the other reviews are killing the overall score I'll round up to help my old stand-by restaurant out. Applebee's is one of the best chain restaurants, way better than places like Chilis or Red Lobster. Applebees is a tight chain so even though I'm reviewing this location they're all the same and the workers here are the practically the same as anywhere else. Even though this location is located in the Queens Center Mall it's got its own entrance on the side of the mall and stays open even after the mall is closed.  Applebee's has some decent food like their french onion soup, boneless honey bbq wings, and most of the other items are done pretty well (amazingly well for a chain). Don't forget their 23oz Brewtus beers either. Applebee's is a good choice if you don't want to try and find a new place to go and want better food than a dive without spending too much. Although their desserts like the cheesecake or bread pudding are very tasty you can go to Baskin Robbins, Dunkin Donuts, or Cinnabon right next door if the mall is still open."
Luis H.,"Elmhurst, NY",1,7,,1.0,4/12/2013,"Terrible staff, slow and they don't bother paying attention to what you're ordering. Kinda rude too. Food is ehh. Cold when it arrived. CHANGE THE USELESS WAITERS AND WAITRESSES!"
Panagioti V.,"College Point, NY",6,62,25,1.0,12/28/2010,"Just ate here, If you like expencive junk food this one is the best:)"
Blanca M.,"Elmhurst, NY",6,67,4,1.0,2/8/2012,"Craptacular! Ordered  medium got well done. My drink was so watered down it was shameful. Two fingers up, just not the thumbs."
Maggie L.,"CORONA, NY",7,217,98,4.0,2/26/2013,Like other chain restaurants. Okay good. Food is good. Blah.
Evelyn V.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,3,1,1.0,3/27/2013,"Avoid this Applebees at all costs! I would not even give them One star! Yelp only lets you post reviews if you select a star - This Applebees at Queens Center Mall deserves a Zero!  Their service is slow and unprofessional. I was a party of 3 and we ordered the Cajun steak and shrimp, spinach dip app, and the sizzling chicken. The App took forever to arrive and there were only a couple of chips. The entrees were cold our steak was raw and chewy and the potatoes were raw. Plus they charge you twice for flavored lemonade, once for the drink the other for the flavoring. All in all our bill came out to $80! $80 dollars and the food was soo poor. I complained to the manager about the quality of the food and he just shrugged his shoulders and didn't even offer to comp us for the two lemonades!! This place is horrible, also dirty! Beware, if you are hungry at the Mall go somewhere else! This place is awful!!"
Miguel Omar B.,"LeFrak City, Queens, NY",8,2,1,4.0,6/4/2012,"Prompt service, especially since my wife and I went on a Sunday at 10 pm. The hostess and waitress were amazing and always had a smile on their faces. The food was excellent and hot!  We'll come back for sure!"
Sadri B.,"White Plains, NY",5000,1934,449,3.0,12/9/2014,"i was in area after seeing a buddy in queens and figured some end of the season college football. inside the queens center mall on queens blvd, and in main level, the place is nice size with the typical applebees decor. walked right in and told the hostess, i will sit at bar, then as i saw the crowd and not being a bar person, i just seated my self in a secluded booth with a nice size tv right in front of me ,great now get a server to notice me, cause it took a while for her to come, not her fault , i seated my self in a hidden corner, she finally came by the nice sweet girl and now time to get down( i mean ordering food and drinks). i am aware that( ab. ) has a rep of having salty food so i picked carefully, i went with the welfare deal 2 for 20 one app and 2 entrees( what a pig i am). not bad at all, mozzarella sticks was decent, no frozen after taste and oriental chicken salad and chicken tenders basket. both were good, not salty at all , but chicken tenders were a little to crunchy, no big deal ,only regret no room for dessert, i am stuffed. a nice applebees with friendly staff, decent food, and comfy booth, with clear view of tvs. the place has a casual sports bar restaurant feel which is just what people enjoy."
Christina T.,"Woodside, NY",5,24,,2.0,2/15/2012,"Orders: Nachos with Spinach and Artichoke, House Sirloin Steak, and Riblets. Loud music in the background. May be good for lazy days, but not for intimate dates. Service was ok. Food was so-so. Nothing surprising for my taste buds. Food tasted generic and commercial."
Valerie V.,"Queens, NY",149,220,448,3.0,12/12/2011,It's a bigger Applebee's than the one in Fresh Meadows and its great that its in the mall. The food was okay and the waitress was very friendly. Nothing spectacular ...
Jenny B.,"MASPETH, NY",0,1,,1.0,3/26/2012,"This place sucks. We had a coupon, and the manager said he honored it after looking it over for over ten minutes. He then took us to our seats. Within five minutes of ordering our food, he came back and told us he wasn't going to accept our coupon anymore. We had to sit there annoyed and frustrated that they couldn't have told us in the beginning to avoid any of our time being wasted. Service also sucked. Appetizers took forever to arrive. Even getting a glass of water took ten minutes. Will not be back here ever again."
Anthony E.,"Middle Village, Queens, NY",0,1,,2.0,4/20/2012,"Wow the service is horrible, there putting one course on top of the other and when you first sit down they rush you for your order but forget to bring your napkins or a plate to eat your first course over, very mis managed."
Inside S.,"Elmhurst, NY",25,103,,3.0,3/1/2009,"I'm been coming to this Applebees since it opened back in 2004. Personally, I never had any problems with this place before.  This applebee's has a full bar and it's a pretty decent social area. There are nice decorations all around and it's overallness is pretty decent. Nice sporty atmosphere.  Their food is above average for frozen food and their burgers are quite decent; it sure beats the crap MCD across the street from the mall and within the mall. To really test this restaurant's style, dont order something with cheese, cheddar, or any sauce. Sauce and Cheese tend to overwhelm the food's actual flavor. I tried the grilled chicken steak and i was satisfied. The chicken was moist and tender while it was chewy and delicate. They offered me garnish and sauce but i denied it because it would be a waste of my money putting it on flavor enhancers.   I would recommend this applebees to anyone. They have good staff, good food, but slow service, long wait for food and to get seated. You choose =) Brought to you by Inside Spoon =) Happy Eating!"
Brendan B.,"SOUTH OZONE PARK, NY",0,11,,3.0,6/7/2012,"It's Applebees, so it's unreasonable to expect gourmet food. The service was decent and the service was decent. I've been here several times, and there was never anything wrong with the food or the servicce. It's nothing exceptional, but is the best option if you want sit-down food while shopping at Queens Center Mall."
Tony C.,"Jackson Heights, NY",436,363,68,3.0,3/22/2008,"I had to go to Applebee's to try their 10oz Brewtus Steak Burger. A great name, and too enticing a description (10 ounces of chopped sirloin topped with cheese and bacon) to let this burger pass me by. The actual experience, however, was less than spectacular. In fact, I barely want to write (home) about it. Perhaps they really do use chopped sirloin, however it must be really lean sirloin, as the full 10oz patty has no juice to it what so ever. Part of the dryness could be due to the fact that they don't (as per company policy) cook medium-rare / rare burgers, so I ordered mine to medium doneness. What's the use of having a 10oz burger if it's dry? Applebee's Fries: The crunchiest fries evar! They keep their crunch even an hour after they're fried, amazing. Leaves me scratching my head, wondering what they do to achieve that extra crunch factor; maybe they use the double fry method? Anyhow, besides the crunch factor, there's also some flavor to these fries, and they are decent sized as well. I went in expecting some run-of-the-mill fries, and I left impressed by their offering. Revised from 2 stars to 3 stars on 5/7/08 on account of their kickass Honey BBQ wings. Read on... Honey BBQ Wings These wings are gooood. Get them. Savor them. It's not often I find myself chomping, sucking, and licking through my meal in such an uncouth demeanor. What can I say? It's the wings; they bring it out in me. The meat is that familiar juicy dark meat that we all love. The sauce is smoky sweet, and more importantly, just right. It's done so right that I find myself slathering more sauce (from the plate) onto the wings, gleefully licking my fingers dry. Dry! The wings are a good size as well. Not too small, not too big. ps: these wings are better than ""The Colonel's"" honey bbq wings. Citrus Terriyaki Wings Too salty for me. There's asian twang, tropical citrus flare, and, unfortunately, too much salt (i.e. soy sauce)."
Kent P.,"Astoria, NY",121,568,360,2.0,10/26/2007,"This Applebee's is crap.  I've been here a few times.  I once walked out after NO ONE came to our table after 9 minutes of sitting there.  No acknowledgement or anything. I've eaten here a few times and had a decent time.  The help is cold, but timely.  So...I'm cool with it."
Linda C.,"Queens, NY",15,636,,3.0,9/10/2010,I have no problems with this Applebees. the food is decent. the prices are reasonable. the service can be slow though.
