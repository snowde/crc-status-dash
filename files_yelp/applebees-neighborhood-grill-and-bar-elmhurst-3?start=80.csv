Ebony E.,"Queens, NY",74,171,12,2.0,2/7/2010,The only thing I like about this place is that it's never a wait to get seated ordered a large strawberry Margarita it came up 11 dollars I was like whoa will never order that there again other chain resturants serve the same drink for like 7.50
Sasha H.,"New York, NY",35,557,,3.0,3/3/2012,"Considering the odds, our experience wasn't half bad. I mean, it's what you would expect - strollers, teenagers, muffin tops, birthday singing, sticky menus, hard water stained silverware, and the list goes on.  But the worst part was probably the wait - both to get a seat, and for our food. We ordered from the $20 for 2 entrees and an appetizer, which we agreed was a great deal.  We had the spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer, and then the oriental chicken salad and chicken pasta. The dip was pretty good, a good amount of spinach, creamy, hot, with melted parmesan on top. Lots of homemade, thin crispy tortilla chips, and salsa. The dip came out right away, about 5-10 minutes after we ordered. But the food, took at least 30-45 minutes, which is not really acceptable considering how simple it was.  However, the salad and pasta were pretty great too.  The salad was not overdressed, and it wasn't too salty or fatty either, a pleasant surprise. The pasta was creamy and had great flavor. Our server was nice and attentive.  Overall, this was a great introduction to this chain restaurant."
Karen Y.,"College Point, Queens, NY",77,249,65,2.0,5/24/2009,"This AppleBees is situated right inside the Queens Center Mall and can be entered from the outside or from inside the mall. In the adjacent parking lot, they have signs for Applebees parking, but I'm not sure about pricing or whether or not it's validated. The first time I came here, service was okay for a weekday dinner. There was a while wait for dinner and servers are always running around because of the workload. It's not the typical Applebees restaurant that I'm used to with less attention from the servers and the rush from table to table, but they get the job done and I don't have a major problem with that--until now. Parking was plentiful at night near the mall so to avoid unjustified parking lot fees, my husband and I walked a block past the high school field to Applebees. There's this unwritten rule or a personal feeling I had when I went into this Applebees last week at the last hour at around 10PM (they close at 11pm.) I never try to go into restaurants near closing time because of the lack of service and who knows if the food is still fresh as everybody rushes to close. Unfortunately, I saw the Applebees commercial on TV featuring their realburgers and I couldn't stop the craving for one. As I went in with my husband, the hostess seated us right away and gave us the standard comment that our server will be right with us. Yeah, right. As I looked around, I saw a male server personally chatting up with some customers, taking his time, but his customers at least, had a drink on their table. Our female server, whom we presume is our server, since she was walking up and down our aisle, went to check how other customers are doing, but failed to pay us any attention. She could have at least said, ""I'll be right with you"" or ""would you like something to drink for now?"" but she ended up passing us, going to the table next to us and do some extra chatting. My husband said out loud that he was ready to order a few times. It seemed like ten minutes have past, but nobody paid us any attention. We were starving because we didn't eat much that day. My husband flagged down the hostess again and told her he was ready to order, but again, just like a robot, she told us that our server would be right with us. I know it's not her job, but at least she could flag down someone who can help us. I had questions about the menu too because they only applied a neon yellow realburger sticker on the menu with no prices or any information. I would have thought with all this TV promotion, Applebees could have promoted it better on a menu. On top of this, the chair next to me was a little ripped, contributing to my ripped seat phobia. This situation with nobody serving us made my husband angry and a minute later, we stood up, walked past our assumed server, walked past our hostess, and out the door. The hostess opened her mouth as if to say something, but didn't. I guess losing us as a customer isn't that big of a deal especially when it was almost time to close. I spent maybe less than twenty minutes there. I considered other Applebees locations, but it was already very late. I ended up going to Georgia Diner and having a good burger time."
Aaron K.,"Astoria, NY",45,366,,2.0,12/6/2008,"The service was slow, even for an Applebees. The kitchen was largely unwilling to accommodate dietary restrictions (which is disappointing for a chain, especially one that I've found to be pretty accommodating in other locations). Also, it was a weekend and everyone was wearing football jerseys. and maybe 3/4 of the staff was wearing Tom Brad jerseys. Maybe I'm missing something about Elmhurst- but I can't think that Brady jerseys in NY are good for business. anyway, if you're at the Queens Mall, you're already in the burbs, so there's not much better than this around- but objectively speaking, compared to the great food that is a short train ride away, Applebees is not worth more than 2."
Laurie c.,"New York, NY",3,161,7,4.0,3/14/2009,"I like my neighborhood Applebees!  Good service, spacious, and no crowds on a Saturday afternoon!"
isha p.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,,4.0,11/2/2010,"i have been visiting here once every two weeks at least for two years now. foods here always been top notch, but the quality of service keeps getting worse. the workers/servers never seem happy and are too eager to eager out of there (we always go late, due to work hours). also a down point of this place the amount of time one has to weight in-order to get food + waiting for seating, especially on weekends its terrible for a simple meal.  just avoid this place on weekends"
Markus G.,"Jamaica, NY",0,4,,5.0,1/20/2010,After a long day in QCM my family and I love to go Applebees. You will not be wasting you time here the food is great and the service is just as great as the food. They do tend to have a 15-20 min. wait but that because of the great food and services. BTW if you don't know what to get I would say steak&parm w/ shrimp and chocolate overload for desert
Affu J.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,11,8,1.0,9/29/2011,the appelbees is one place where i love to go and just have good food especially in the mall! the best part is that u shop and then you eat! i have been to applebees plenty of times before... the one in the mall is not bad.. i went couple of times but recently i went with my friend and i must say this is the worst experience ever! the staff was very rude! especially the women who helps you get to a table was very rude! did not look at us for atleast 5 minutes cause she was busy talking to her co worker! it took half an hour for appetizer to arrive and an even longer time for the entree to arrive! the waiter was mean! he did not apologize for the delay and just did not pay attention! he was also busy talking to some chick.. maybe his girlfriend!  they even forgot to get some dip for my appetizer! will not go again unless they change their very unfriendly staff! i rather walk and go the the one on 63rd drive! where the service is much much better!
