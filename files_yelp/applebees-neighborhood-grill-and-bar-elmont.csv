Brian P.,"Floral Park, NY",1,165,54,4.0,12/30/2017,"There is plenty of parking. The staff are all super nice people. We ordered some food for pickup and it was made quickly, cooked perfect, and served with a smile. Everything was delicious. Mozzarella sticks, chicken finger basket with fries, salad, rack of ribs, and mash potatoes. I Will be back.."
Chantel S.,"Queens Village, Queens Village, NY",0,16,8,3.0,12/28/2017,My to go to spot when I'm bored at home or a quick bite with my daughter. It's not a five star restaurant I don't expect how the pictures look lol
Diane Y.,"Elmont, NY",25,68,174,4.0,12/13/2017,"Applebee's is my favorite chain restaurant. 2 for $20, and late night drinks/apps just can't be beat.  I order both take-out and dine in frequently.  On the rare occasion that I did the Manager was on it immediately, but it was over the wait for my food.  The servers are always friendly and I've never had a problem/mix-up with an order since they opened some years ago. There's never a bad wait for a table, I've come in as much on weekdays as on weekends and have never waited more than 5min for a table.  Love that you can pay with the tablet, and while this location does not offer the half-price apps between 3pm-6pm, they do still do half-price drinks during that time.  I strategically come in on game days for extended promotions during football season, and my go to plate is the fiesta-lime chicken.  Guilty pleasure is the triple chocolate meltdown...if I didn't go crazy on the apps, I try to always leave some room for it."
Sally R.,"Manhattan, NY",92,21,4,1.0,12/23/2017,Horrible never again. Ordered shrimp Thai salad. The salad came without any shrimps. I told the waitress. She came back with the shrimps and hid the plate behind her while she asked me am I sure they're no shrimps. Um hello can't you see my salad has no shrimps in. Then she gave me the plate of shrimps for my salad. Ordered chicken wings. Looks like they emptied a jar of sauce all over. It was so full of sauce we had to wipe sauce off with napkins to eat the wings. My son ordered a sprite and it tasted like flat club soda. Overall it was horrible. Not worth the price we paid.
Mickel E.,"Great Neck, NY",174,86,453,3.0,12/10/2017,Place is good during weekdays.   The staff are 50/50.  Some are ugly and cranky AF.  The rest are just friendly and cute.  The manager is nice however.   I order the apps or the 2 for $20 deal usually.  Sometimes they arrive quick. Sometimes they arrive super late.  Just be ready to be annoyed at times.  Order food you don't want them to cook too long.  The shrimp apps are bomb.  Boomsauce!
Shana J.,"Queens Village, NY",136,76,353,3.0,2/8/2017,"The experiences that I have at this location are always different. On this visit it was Mommy & Son Date Night, so of course to lil man's favorite spot we went. Upon entering the hostess was missing but I presume she was seating a table. When she arrived we were greeted with a smile and walked over to our table. Our table had some sort sticky residue on it which was very strange and probably unsanitary. The first young man came introduced himself as the sub to our waitress and took my drink and sons food order. Not too long after that the waitress came to take our order but I told her he took our order.(guess there's some miscommunication on their end.... unfortunately for me this was the tone for the rest of the evening)  My son was now sucked into these little table games that should practically be part of their meal.#1. My drink arrives and is delivered to the wrong table. #2. My son's meal and my appetizer arrives and is delivered to the same wrong table. #3. The gentleman's sandwich arrives and is delivered to my table. #4 My dinner arrived again to the wrong table. Thank goodness my second drink came to me.  Post all the mix up I will say the young lady that waited on us was an angel. She was accommodating and served with a smile. As long as this is one of my son's favorite restaurants I will be back.  Oh yea the food was ok nothing to do back flips over."
Kiki B.,"Floral Park, NY",0,11,,1.0,11/14/2017,Absolutely horrible service here! After waiting at my table over twenty minutes..... The waiter acted as if he didn't see my table then when I approached the supervisor he had a look of guilt bc he knew what he had done ! I give this place not one single star.... damn I have to just to post! Horrible
Tamara B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",189,10,3,1.0,10/15/2017,This place is the worst .. I love applebees but this location has the worst quality food and workers w attitudes.. next time should of followed our firs and went to white kastles smh
Mj F.,"Jamaica, NY",29,55,186,3.0,7/13/2017,Visited on a Sunday evening and the wait was about 5 minutes. The waiter was patient with us because we couldn't decide what we wanted to eat. Our drinks were good and the siracha shrimp and chicken wonton tacos were as well. The number one reason I visit is because I like the sweet potato fries. Overall our experience was good.
Shannon H.,"Stewart Manor, NY",58,5,17,1.0,8/17/2016,"So this was my second time coming to this Applebee's location, and I have to say the service was TERRIBLE just like before. We were greeted faster than last time and seated a little quicker, however the table was wet when we were seated, the guy that seated us didn't tell us the signature drinks, took a while for the waitress to get to us and ask for our order.  She was nice but the service was terrible, we put our drinks and food in and we waited a little over 20 mins to get anything that we ordered! OUR FOOD CAME FIRST!! They brought out our app at the same time as our entrée. OUR DRINKS STILL WEREN'T HERE!!  I can not explain how terrible it was. THE PLACE WAS NOT EVEN BUSY AT ALL!!! The waitress was so hard to find, was no where to be found to be able to ask where our drinks where. A manger wasn't even able to be found.. How do you run a restaurant with waitress' and waiter's and managers for that matter not around? And if they are around how do you not see a table with people sitting for over 20 mins with nothing on the table?   Needless to say, I will NEVER come to this Applebee's regardless if it is closer to me..  I WILL BE GOING TO THE BALDWIN APPLEBEE'S FROM NOW ON!! They have the best service EVEN WHEN THEY ARE BUSY!!"
Allie B.,"Farmingdale, NY",111,2,,1.0,9/10/2017,This was not a very good experience. It took them a while to seat us and the waitress even longer to get to us & it wasn't busy at all. I came for football Sunday and the waitress didn't even know what beers were on tap.
Michael G.,"Floral Park, NY",507,551,133,4.0,4/6/2016,"Apparently those of you who gave this place anything less than four stars, have not met Dale. He is the bartender wIth charm and finesse. He also has the memory of an elephant! I watched him serve drinks to over 20 people and remember exactly what they want, from their last visit.  I stopped in here while my car was being serviced next-door and spent about two hours here in the company of many beautiful women and many more cold beers!  While I did not eat. I certainly drank my calories and was entertained the entire time!"
Meka S.,"Rosedale, NY",69,166,373,3.0,3/8/2016,"Came here on a Monday night . The service was okay . Our waiter was a nice girl . I really liked that there was a machine at every table where you can order appetizers / desserts and pay your bill on. That was great , we didn't have to wait for our waiter to come back to do any of those things .  For the appetizer we had the chicken quesadilla , it was very good . We didn't get any plates though. I don't know if that's the new thing but , we had to just eat it from the tray it was on . I didn't like that , and we were of course too hungry to wait until our waiter showed up again to ask for some .  For my entree I had the cheesy Mac and cheese with the honey tenders . It was okay . The honey sauce was delicious and the Mac and cheese was good but the chicken. The chicken had an awful bitter taste to it , kinda messed it up for me ."
Liz L.,"Brooklyn, NY",108,111,13,1.0,7/15/2016,"Walked in, the hostesses were too busy watching this ""cute guy"" (their words) to greet us or offer us a seat. My friend brought this up to them and they told us they thought we were sitting at the bar. We are seated... And the bug infestation starts. Ants crawling on the wall, on our table and on US. We call the manager, Alfredo, and show him the bugs crawling on the table! He proceeds to give us coupons for a free appetizer. Really? Horrible."
Jessa B.,"Elmont, NY",1,11,6,5.0,11/27/2016,I have been coming here since they opened. It has good nights and bad nights but for the most part it is a great place to eat. Can't expect perfection every time for as much as I am here so gonna give it a 5 star despite the issues from the past.
Ebony H.,"Rosedale, NY",467,208,511,4.0,10/5/2015,"Food was decent and the atmosphere was nice and calm not too loud. Our waitress was very weird but hey. We came for burgers and unlimited fries and I must say that the fries were really good, better than the burger. The manager came and asked us is everything ok which was great but came back less than five minutes to ask us the same question. Weird.... The drinks were 3 dollars since it was football season and a Monday night but my gosh did it taste like just syrup and flavor. Maybe the bartender was asleep or something. Other than that it was a good experience and I'd rather this apple bees than the ghetto green acres one."
Crystal I.,"Valley Stream, NY",50,123,19,1.0,4/16/2016,"I have been to this restaurant a few times, but the service today was deplorable. It took about 20 minutes for my table to figure out who our waitress was since numerous people were back and forth serving us. Drinks took about 20 minutes to come. And when they did come, my friend and I noticed her glass was filthy a sticky substance on the bottom of the glass. After complaining to our waitress, she then proceeded to tell us this was a waiter stain, which clearly it was not. After she brought back the second drink with the ""cleaner cup"", we then noticed the margarita salt which was rimmed around the glass had a pink stain which appeared to be lipstick on the glass!!! We complained to the manager who tried to offer us a coupon but we declined. I would never come back here again. If you want better service, go to the location in new Hyde park on Jericho Turnpike!"
William P.,"Queens Village, Queens Village, NY",58,1,,2.0,2/26/2017,"I've been going to this Applebee's since its opening. But I will not go there again. I was disrespected on two different occasions by the manager Pat. One occasion I complained of a regular customer who would cough a phlegm sounding cough continuously at the bar. I was told by Pat ""I should not sit near the bar and I was giving her a hard time."" 2nd situation was about 2 weeks ago Pat brought my order pretended as if she didn't see me as I reached out for the plate placed it on the fridge under the bar near the garbage and walked away . I cancelled my order and will not return. She was the head manager that day and never even came out to address my complaint. She's extremely moody and should be retrained as far as dealing with the public."
Donell T.,"Queens, NY",32,1,,1.0,2/20/2017,"Went there to for happy hour, was very disappointed with water down drinks. I ordered a long island ice tea & rum & coke. The rum & coke tasted like pure coke no rum. And the long island tasted like lipton ice tea. Very disappointed,  bartender needs to be reeducated on how to make drinks. No buzz what so ever and sad part I drank on a empty stomach. Not going there again."
Patrick Star F.,"Elmont, NY",110,16,2,1.0,7/8/2017,"I only came to this spot bc it was 5 min away from my house. Even on a regular night the food is okay but nothing special. On this one particular night I decided to come here with my girlfriend. First, the waitress took awhile to come to our table. Then, once she came she proceeded to have a hint of an attitude for no reason at all. Trying to not let it affect our night, we ignored it. Another waiter brings our food almost a half hour later and he proceeds to drop a whole tray of food on me. His response? ""Wow, I haven't done that in awhile."" Then proceeds to walk away to get someone else to clean it up. I laughed it off while my girlfriend was fuming. After receiving new plates of food that was mediocre at best, the waitress eventually brings our check after not checking on us or apologizing for what occurred. They had the nerve to charge twice for the meals! And she had the nerve to get angry when having to get the manager to take it off the bill because she didn't want to deal with it! We refused to pay for most of the stuff to which he took off AFTER lightly accusing me of spilling the food on myself. When my girl got her change which was about $1.25 the waitress had the audacity to ask if she really wanted it back because she wanted to keep it as tip. She got nothing. Worst Applebee's. Never going back. It deserves NO stars. Lucky I can't post this without starring it SOMETHING."
Shawn W.,"Burbank, CA",466,73,72,3.0,4/28/2016,I rarely come to Applebee's but when I do the food always tastes like the oil and it never fails. I try to give it another chance each and every time but nothing changes. The staff are cool and the location is perfect but I just wished my food didn't taste like the oil has been changed since the day before.
Alyssa V.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,4,,2.0,3/29/2017,"My favorite Applebee's ever! GREAT FOOD! BUT... THE MOST ATROCIOUS SERVICE I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED. They're lucky their cooks are so good, because otherwise I'd never go back! Half the time you can't even tell which waiter is yours and they talk to each other more than they do their own guests. Ridiculous!"
Thalia V.,"New Hyde Park, NY",98,3,,1.0,11/23/2016,Horrible service. Got seated and had to wait for about 15 mins to get helped. Food came out before the appetizer. How sad. Food was very poorly che. Order dessert again waited another 15 mins for a half of scoop of ice cream and cold brownie. Horrible! horrible! horrible!
Kashiro W.,"Valley Stream, NY",13,127,138,3.0,12/30/2015,"Always like this place.tonight was okay. We did something different and too our order to go. The cashier wasn't friendly and he didn't smile. Also as we waited a waiter rudely made a comment, if going make a rude comment you might as well keep it to ourself . However the young lady at the door the greet was pretty friendly. I still like coming here they are usually cool with the service and clean. Tonight it's very calm night. However the manager was nice I didn't realize something about the price and he fixed the price to an order that was pause out so I appreciate that. Thanks manager"
Jillian W.,"Glen Oaks, Queens, NY",2,11,8,1.0,7/5/2016,"Waitress is oblivious.. Food is horrible, stale chips for the artichoke dip. Most likely never coming back here again, should have went to the one in new Hyde park. So much better"
Bianca S.,"Elmont, NY",0,1,,5.0,3/25/2017,I'm gonna base this review on my latest experience there.  The food was delicious and the server was very nice and attentive.  The drink I ordered was really good too! Watermelon Sangria.  I'd recommend it.
Unknown U.,"New Rochelle, NY",1,5,4,5.0,10/6/2016,I cosign with Michael G apparently so. My server was Ms. Yolanda when I tell you she was phenomenal to my needs. She checked on me  constantly made sure I was good. One thing that I didnt expect was her hospitality in helping me save money on my order. She worked it out where I ended up paying less. For yall nosy people that is trying to figure what favor she did. I didnt look at the meal carefully was so focus on  quesadillas and wonton tacos that I were gonna pay full price for. She ended up showing me the bar menu which was chose any 2 for 10.29. I was happy
Rick M.,"Valley Stream, NY",1,12,,4.0,7/23/2016,"The service so far has always been great, I live in the area but I bring friends all the way from Brownsville Brooklyn to dine here because of the service. The only thing I would like is for Applebees to provide a greater variety of food."
Edmund C.,"Brooklyn, NY",82,3,,2.0,5/1/2016,"I put in effort to recover my long lost yelp account to review this horrible experience.  To start off, our appetizers arrived before we were even given our plates and utensils. They gave us temporary plastic utensils because apparently their dish washing machine was being fixed. Shouldn't we be aware of this situation before we get our food and realize we don't have anything to eat with?  Secondly, when the waiter asked how I would like my steak cooked, I asked her what my choices were. I specifically choose medium, the rawest option they offered. 20 minutes later, I received a dish of uncooked  onions and a well-done steak.  The dish was sent back and the manager appeared to handle the situation. I received a new dish 10 minutes later, better than the previous, but still just mediocre. On top of this, a few of the staff who looked like waitresses standing by the stack of menus, gave our table dirty stares while whispering to each other, which I found highly insulting and unnecessary.  Because of that, I also felt unsafe eating at this restaurant. Who knows what these unfriendly people do to our food?  The only reason why this was a 2-star instead of one was because the manager, I believe his name was Mr. Singh, as well as the waiter and waitress who served us, tried their best to handle the situation and make up for their rude and lacking co-workers.  PS: The restaurant was practically empty, there should be no excuse for this incomplete service.  We are paying customers, we should be treated that way."
Crystal G.,"Queens Village, NY",4,39,79,4.0,11/4/2015,"I stopped in after work in search of a good salad and burger. I wanted a spinach salad. The server was able to get me my salad without shrimp, which I am allergic to and it was tasty. The bacon burger was made of fresh ground beef and also was tasty. I tried the pretzel bites with cinnamon and cream cheese sauce, a sweet crunchy delight. Service was fast and everyone was pleasant. Very good dining experience. It was a Wednesday afternoon so there was no crowd and I did not feel rushed and could enjoy my meal."
J A.,"Elmont, NY",87,109,,3.0,5/30/2016,"I haven't reviewed many (or any?) chain restaurants because I think the food and experience are the same at them all. Therefore, this review is more reactive than proactive; I'm tired of outsiders treating entities in my hamlet as though they are infected boils, and I want to support the community. This Applebee's is fine; it's the same as every other one in areas with their pristine reputations. The food is Applebee's food, and the service isn't problematic; the location is quite clean, and the staff members are friendly. I'm awarding three stars because I just don't love Applebee's in general--though their new menu has made me consider accepting a neophyte position in the faith."
Anthony R.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,2,,1.0,11/23/2016,Worst service ever. Very slow and not attentive to customers. Server walked past many times didn't even ask if we needed anything. Appetizer came out after entrees. Dessert came out 15 MINUTES after it was ordered. Will not come to this location again. Wish I could give 0 stars.
Shanice D.,"Whippany, NJ",222,10,4,1.0,1/27/2016,"The food sucked, the waiter was ok. Poor management. I left my cellphone there I tracked it at 3am and it was still at the applebees. I know this because I went back and my phone connected to the Bluetooth in my car. When I called them at 8:30am they told me my phone was gone which mean the staff stole my phone. POOR SERVICE DO NOT EAT THERE SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!"
Natalie D.,"Rosedale, NY",104,29,20,3.0,11/5/2014,"i have gone to this apple bee's at least 3 times a month, not because i enjoy it that much but to get some cheap appetizers and 1/2 off drinks. The service is always hit or miss. Sometimes your food is hot and sometimes its ice cold. The drinks SUCK unless Karina is at the bar. One time i had a waitress take a selfie with the dessert before dropping the food to the table. Thankfully it wasn't my dessert, but who knows if she took a photo before i received my food... is that why it was cold?! probably so... nonetheless if your looking for a late night snack and you want to sit down and be served, then go right ahead. I literally go there for the wings and spinach dip only.  Enjoy:-)"
H K.,"Elmont, NY",1,22,63,3.0,2/6/2015,"Good service, decent food Bourbon marinated Sirloin with shrimp (4/5): tender, juicy and greasy with sautéed potatoes, onions and mushrooms. It's a decent size portion. A little too salty for my taste but that might just be a personal preference.  Service (5/5): very friendly and very helpful.  Atmosphere: its Applebee's, so everyone knows how it looks like but the place was neat and the bar TV wasn't annoying loud even though I was sitting in a table pretty close by.  Warning: don't leave valuables visible in your vehicle. My truck was vandalized. Too bad they don't have better cameras all around. Management needs to address theft if they expect their business to keep going. Took off a star!"
Kendra M.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,1,1,1.0,5/28/2015,"My first time going there today. I went in an order my food to go. When I got home it was as warm as I would like so I warmed it up on the stove.   I had about two bites  and then found a short jet black hair on a piece  of broccoli. Definitely  not my hair. I posted a picture of it.  I am throwing it away because  I'm  am completely  disgusted. I didn't call the restaurant  about it because I figured it would be pointless. If they offered me a gift card or something  I won't even use it.   I am still hungry so if anyone has any recommendations  of good restaurants that deliver and don't serve hair with there food,let  me know."
Philip C.,"Malverne, NY",0,1,,1.0,8/24/2016,Went and ordered a side of cheese fries with my meal. 2 fries show up on the plate with one string of cheese. Ask for extra sauce on the side and get the worst attitude from server. Embarrassment of an establishment
Zuheil B.,"Airmont, NY",103,11,4,2.0,2/7/2016,"Ordered over the phone dinner for my family.  I asked specifically for a BLT without Mayonesse nor tomatoes.. I repeated it twice to the lady and she said okay no problem... My husband went to pick it up, came home and everything was in the sandwich.  I was annoyed because I had to go out and have them correct the order.  The worst part was that when I walked in I told the lady in the front desk they got my order wrong. I need to get it corrected.. And her response was ""well go, what are you waiting for."" I looked at her like I haven't been here where am I going?,  but the manager seemed to have heard her and came to me and quickly assisted me.  Which I appreciate. However, the lady in the front tried to correct her tone of voice when the manager came and lied saying ""oh yes she was here earlier"" Which I wasn't.  My husband was.  I was so annoyed!"
L P.,"Elmont, NY",0,17,11,2.0,4/18/2014,We were welcomed by a waitress who opened the door and stared us down like wtf are you doing here... Boneless buffalo wings were dry and tasted freezer burnt Had to ask for refills ... Not the worst experience but don't plan on returning.
Richard A.,"New York, NY",2,2,2,1.0,10/23/2015,"Bad service. Sat, waited for an extensive amount of time. Seems as if there needs to be a better manager and all staff wiped out with employees who are there because they want to be. The servers all standing around gossiping. While we waiting 30 min without even placing our order or drinks."
