Cinthia S.,"Rosedale, NY",0,14,39,4.0,10/12/2015,"I love Applebee's cuz of BF and he thinks I'm sick lol... Ever since he took my here about 4 years ago I've been stuck on their appetizers.. I'm not a big fan of their entrees. However, I do love the fact that their appetizers are half off after 10 and drinks as well.. So we come here most of the time mostly Saturday nights for drinks and we always enjoy. Only bad experience was at the Applebee's in gateway plaza in Brooklyn.. Food was horrible, service was horrible & environment was just ghetto"
Yusuf A.,"Elmont, NY",0,3,,1.0,3/27/2016,"These is the worst Applebee's ever!!! I'm really concerned about the hygiene and manners of the female staffs,the male staffs are well behaved and professional,the female staffs don't greet or welcome you,the lady who brought our food had her fingers and fingernails dipped in the food while holding the plates,a waiter should hold the plate from underneath but she held hers with fingers in the food,how am I sure she that she washed her hands after using the bathroom or after changing her sanitary pads?the female manager needs to be fired ,she just nodded her head without saying anything when I complained to her about the situation,I WILL NEVER STEP MY FOOT ON THEIR DOOR OR RECOMMEND ANYONE TO THAT PLACE AGAIN,I won't spend my hard earned money on food poisoning."
Kenya L.,"New York, NY",18,40,45,2.0,6/24/2014,"No frills here! The initial greeting and seating was quick, nice and informative, as was the greeting from our waiter. I was offered a drink from their drink menu, of course, but declined and I decided to make a short order. For my child, she had 1/2 cheesy bread pizza with mozzarella sticks and the kids size lemonade. I wasn't very hungry, so I ordered a brownie sundae with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and a cheese quesadilla without bacon, to go, even though I was informed that the quesadilla that states that it contains bacon, did not have bacon included in the order, due to complaints. What was received was hard, crusty garlic bread covered in some kind of cheese and tomato paste and luke warm mozzarella sticks, and a half melted and messy brownie sundae. I also received the cheese quesadilla without the bacon BUT IT WAS PLATED. After I specified to the waitress that I did not want the plate and I wanted it to go, I recieved it, luke warm, approximately 20 minutes later. After I got too tired to deal, I asked for a check, gave the minimum 15% and left (oh and i never once recieved a napkin, not one).  The service here isn't entirely atrocious (I left my keys in the booth and the waiter came and brought them to me) but it isn't anything to write home about. I've come here several times and I always receive the same level of service on a consistent basis. I understand this is a fast food place with places to sit but they have to give their waitstaff more training. Will I be returning, not likely. I might order to-go and keep it on a in-and-out basis very occasionally, perhaps rarely, if the mediocre service extends to the to-go plateau."
Michael B.,"Rockville Centre, NY",81,6,,5.0,5/27/2016,"the service was great. I do not recall the young lady who assisted my fiancé and I, but she was marvelous. We ordered our food and it was served within 20 minutes. Would recommend this location to anyone who appreciates good service."
Deborah F.,"Elmont, NY",7,20,24,1.0,4/21/2015,"I've been to this AppleBees several times before and have had pretty pleasant experiences. I came late night with some girlfriends recently. All went well until most of the customers had left. My group was one of two patrons still in the restaurant. All of a sudden an outburst from the corner caught our attention. It was the server and manager ""playfully"" cursing eachother out, like it was OK. Highly unprofessional!!! Fast forward to a few days later, my cousin and I were both victims of fraudulent chargers on our credit cards (which were used that previous week at AppleBees to pay for dinner). More than coincidental. Patrons beware. I am in the process of filing an official complaint."
Josephine L.,"Floral Park, NY",30,33,38,3.0,6/7/2015,Chicken wonton tacos had really good flavor. I had the chicken bacon maple wrap that my husband had raved was so delicious. It was good though it I think my husband liked it more. Fries were okay but tasted a little greasy- more than usual fries. Had the raspberry lemonade and then mango lemonade. Good tasting but they were $2.79 and refills were $0.79. A little too pricey. Our meal in fact was $60+ with no dessert. That's expensive for a chain restaurant.
Baby R.,"Queens Village, NY",9,39,12,3.0,6/6/2015,Had a bad day to start...figure I'll have something small to eat. .....environment  was great. ..food n drink not bad....wht topped it off was my waiter Dale....had me smiley from the start. He was on point till the end. :)
Kalisha E.,"Queens, NY",87,266,224,5.0,7/24/2011,"1/2 off apps and 2 for 1 drinks after 10pm e'ry night sounds good to me! This is a new Applebee's thats been here about a month. Came here with the fam last night and our bill was a cool $85 for 5 people. With drinks!  I'm such a creature of habit that I know I'll be back because of my experience. The bud and bud lights were cool and crisp from draft. Piña colada and strawberry daiquiris are lightweight- order those if you like a fruity taste with not much alcohol. The Cabernet Sauvignon was watery, to me.  Two for twenty is a great deal- had the spinach app (yum) and mozzarella sticks (yum) were both great. My shrimp pasta dish had way too much black pepper though. Mom had the tilapia weight watchers meal which she loved. Applebee's is a chain I know but who cares. It's a great place to catch a bite and drinks without denting your pocket. Red Lobster was my last minute go-to for consistency and those amazing baked bread biscuits but now it's Applebee's for the price and drinks!"
Alicia C.,"Middle Village, Queens, NY",250,34,4,3.0,10/20/2013,"This is a decent Applebee's. It depends on the wait staff you get. Some waitresses are friendly and polite but more times than not throughout my experiences, some waitresses seem to have attitudes or just poorly trained when it comes to customer service.  Overall the food and the managers make up for some of the problems you run into"
Mal L.,"Elmont, NY",0,32,14,1.0,1/14/2015,"Worst Applebees around! Rude workers who stand around doing nothing, they seem to all be bothered when you ask them for something ( this is your job right?) . Food is normal for an Applebees but they need to hire professional staff unlike the people they have now."
Mary G.,"Saugerties, NY",0,4,,1.0,7/4/2015,Horrible service. Been to this Applebees many times and each time the service got worse to the point where we walked out and stopped going there.
Sharlene J.,"HOLLIS, NY",236,25,257,3.0,8/6/2014,"Went here last night around 11:30pm for 1/2 off appetizers and 1/2 off drinks. Basic apple bees food, drinks were weak. Sever was nice, attentive and had a good sense of humor"
Patricia C.,"West Hempstead, NY",14,39,58,4.0,1/3/2014,"I've been here several times and am unsure why there are so many negative reviews.  Hello people, it's Applebee's? I'm unsure what the expectation level is... Applebee's is sit-down fast food. With this in mind, this place is perfectly within the range of expectation.  This location is always accommodating. There are a lot of young people who work here. Maybe I've been lucky, I've had positive experiences each time I've been here, whether with friends or family (with small children). The place is very family friendly. It is not a first date spot - unless of course you are in high school and maybe even college.  Keep it in perspective..."
SunRunLove E.,"Floral Park, NY",0,29,10,4.0,4/15/2013,While I'm not a fast food chain restaurant kind of gal I've been taken here a few times by some family members. The staff is super friendly & customer service is spot on great! A manager always stops by to chit-chat & I think every company should be as nicely trained as this one. There was 1 sweet waitress named Priscilla that my mom & I had fun talking to. She was really nice & pretty & we told her. Wish we had a score card to give her boss! She deserved a raise! Since its a bar food kind of place my expectations were low but I can always find a decent dish thats not too fattening & they have the Weight Watchers point system dishes that are quite tasty! The decor is nice & they basically did an ode to local high school sports teams which added a nice warm touch!
Marchel C.,"Hewlett, NY",1,4,,1.0,11/18/2015,"HORRIBLE! I've never liked Applebees, but it was late and wanted a little something to munch on and chill with my long time friend. The food was cold and you can clearly taste that the food is microwaved. Had the nerve to be luke warm microwaved food!!! Yuck! My friend ordered beer, which was supposed to be unlimited in which our waitress was extremely slow to bring out. Btw, the beer was not cold! I finally decided since I wasn't able to enjoy my food, to go for broke and just get a dessert thinking this couldn't be such a hard task, after all, it's just cookie and ice cream right? Wrong! My dessert never made it out! I saw my waitress walk toward my table then double back like she forgot something twice!!! I finally had enough and my friend and I decided to leave. My friend went to pay the bill since our waitress was missing in action. As I was waiting by the door, my waitress finally comes up to me with the ice cream dessert asking me if I still wanted it! Lol ummm NO! That will be my last time at Applebees. As last night was the nail in the coffin for me!"
Thomas F.,"Farmingdale, NY",0,5,,1.0,1/10/2016,"Worst service ever. This place is ridiculous.  Ordered appetizer sampler.  Got just the boneless wings. Wife order a pinot noir. Got a glass of pinot grigio. No explanation,  no apologies. Food came out in intervals. Wide was done with entree before others came out. This place is a joke,  avoid at all costs. Have managed restraints for last 17 years. Would fire everyone in a second. Disgusted."
Jake J.,"Elmont, NY",8,173,80,1.0,8/1/2014,"Just when I thought the Applebee's on Jamaica ave was the worst, this place takes the cake. I've been here on multiple occasions and it's always the same experience.  Slow service, lack of customer attention by employees, my food is always cold or under cooked. I recommend avoiding this particular place..."
John K.,"New York, NY",0,22,41,1.0,5/13/2015,"Very unhappy with the service and atmosphere.  We wanted to watch the Rangers game so we requested seating closest to the TV which of course they were able to accommodate.  The turned on the volume for us and were enjoying our meal when another family came in and turned down the volume for them.   Once the other family's order was taken, we then asked them to turn it back up...the manager, Garfield had said they can't really turn on the volume***then why have TVs????  The family should have been seated elsewhere or seated us closer to the TV.  On top of this incident, the waitress Anastasia?? Was rushing us and  kept asking us if we wanted dessert while we were eating...mind you I had just started eating and there was still 95% of my meal on the plate.  At the end of the meal she gives us the bill with the suggested gratuity circled...What!??  Worst Applebee's franchise ever!!  We should've went to Green Turtle in Franklin Square, at least we could've enjoyed ourselves and our meals.  We will never go back to this Applebee's again!"
James O.,"Valley Stream, NY",11,5,,1.0,12/26/2013,"Service was horrible, drinks took way to long. Coming from a severs point a view this is horrible I understand they went down to only a few servers but they don't know how to keep on top of their stuff even the manager seems flustered I will  Never come back to this Applebee's again"
Brittany A.,"Queens Village, Queens, NY",623,371,398,4.0,1/5/2012,"This is a  new Applebee's and like many Applebees' the food has a consistent quality. There was nothing special about this particular spot's food BUT the service was lovely which can really make or break an Applebee's. I came in on a Tuesday night with my mom and baby sis (I'm still calling her baby and the brat is 7). It was freezing outside and the young lady at the door was super chipper and friendly and welcomed us in. There was no wait at all. And we sat in a cute little booth not too far from the door.  It was so warm inside. Perfect for a freezing winter night. It felt like a nice summer's evening inside there. Our waiter was busy by the bar but he glanced over at us and mouthed for us to give him just a moment and he'd be right over. He came right over after a few more seconds. A man of his word. I love that! He was polite and attentive and friendly. Stayed to chat with us for a while and was patient as my mom took forever to order. I had the fish and chips (for the first time). I will say the fish was a tad oily so we'll knock off a star...but still yummy nonetheless. The manager kept strolling around making sure everyone was having a good night. We asked him for some wing sauce and a refill and he sent our waiter right to us with it in like 45 seconds. I don't even know how he did that. We ordered, did the mad libs on the kids menu, and the food was right out! Not a long wait at all. We also got to watch a million different games that were on, considering they have all these televisions hanging up. It was a nice evening and of course everything was on the cheap. I loveeee this Applebee's and definitely will be coming back."
