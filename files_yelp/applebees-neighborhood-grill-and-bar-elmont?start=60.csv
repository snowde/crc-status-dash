Steffi R.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,32,1,2.0,9/16/2011,"I have to say that I am not the biggest fan of Applebees to begin with. However, this is right up the block from the bf's house and Applebees has a good variety so I decided to give it a try.  I went on a weeknight to get something to go and it was not too busy but for some reason it took the counter person a long time to even take my order. I ordered a salad and sliders.   When I got home I found that the salad was not at all what I had ordered but I thought it a bonus to have little pieces of breaded mozzarella show up in it. Turns out the sliders are not actually sliders. What Applebees  calls sliders is actually one hamburger cut up into smaller pieces and stuck on mini buns. No lettuce or tomato or sauce of any kind. They smelled like and had the aftertaste of White Castle burgers.  GROSS.  Oh, I also brought a cup of tomato soup home to the bf. Fail. One spoonful was enough to diagnose it as a cup of  ""souper"" thick tomato...crap.  I should have gone to Checkers..."

Elly F.,"Nassau County, NY",49,89,9,1.0,10/21/2012,"So I recently returned to this Applebee's and left without even eating.  While we were seated fairly quickly, our waiter/waitress never arrived at the table. After realizing no one was stopping at our table, and looking around wondering who was going to be waiting on us, I set my phone timer to five minutes because that was the most I was willing to continue to wait. At the two minute mark I hear a waiter telling the waitress, who was attentively attending the table next to us, ""you have this table, right?"", and pointing to us. She nods her head, and then he decides to tell us, ""she will be right with you.' At this point I am wondering why she never stopped by the table to acknowledge us when she passed by us multiple times. Another waiter had to remind you that you have us as a table? Really? And then you act annoyed because you knew this all along??  Well luckily for us there is another Applebee's not to far away, so we got up and left. Rather spend my money elsewhere."
Rhonda S.,"New York, NY",6,76,6,5.0,6/16/2014,"This location of Applebee's donated their oriental salad to the Belmont Stakes Blue Ribbon Run for Prostate Cancer on June 1.  They fed an army of runners, walkers and volunteers and it was delicious!  Any restaurant as philanthropic as this Applebee's gets Five stars from me!  Thank you Pat!"
J M.,"New York, NY",0,20,7,2.0,8/12/2014,"It's applebees..the food is microwaved..the drinks are weak..the server hates your guts but knows he is being watched by that guy who keeps walking around, introducing himself as the manager of this fine establishement, and asking how is everything going. Everything is microwaved to perfection my friend. I got 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and what I think is a desert for $20 bucks so I'm not going to complain....life is good!!!"
V R.,"Flushing, NY",0,11,,2.0,9/7/2013,Went to this Apple Bees on Friday night.  Had a decent crowd of people in the restaurant.  The waitress we had was not very friendly and got annoyed when I asked her questions.  She seemed to have no customer or serving skills.  She bought 2 appetizer plates and drops it one of top of each other without placing it on the sides of the table where we were seated.  A guy then brings us a glass of soda holding it by the rim (how unsanitary).  The waitress never came by to ask us if we needed anything else or if we enjoyed our meal.  The food was okay but my margarita was great.  Thank goodness after my experience I needed that drink.
S H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,,1.0,8/5/2012,"Party of four waited 30 minutes until the server arrived to the table to take our orders. The food took approx 15 minutes to arrive. I ordered the ultimate trio ( classic wings, boneless barbecue and wonton chicken tacos). I picked up one of the tree tacos preparing to place it in my mouth when I noticed a thick strand of brunette hair between the chicken. In disbelieve, I showed everyone at the table who all agreed that it was a piece of HAIR. The server came to the table to apologize despite my immediate request to speak with the manager who came shortly after. The manager apologize but somehow his apology did not appear to be genuine. The manager stated that trio would be on him. The food was replaced and needless to say, the wings were slighlty below warm and the boneless wings were overcooked and very hard. Once we were ready to leave, a request was made for a to go box. The server arrived with box and plastic bag which he tossed while apologizing for our experience. Again apology was not genuine. STAy FAR AWAY.....  BRW the manager's attire did not appear to be clean."
