Lance E.,"Eugene, OR",20,29,,2.0,2/6/2010,"Food was good, for a quick, greasy,comfort food meal. Service was AWESOME.The only pet peeve I had was the ASSHOLE MANAGER, who was busy talking on his stupid headset, while hosting. Pay attention to your customers while youre dealing with them.GET OFF THE HEADSET AND GIVE SOME CUSTOMER SERVICE!! YOURE THE MANAGER AND SHOULD KNOW THIS ALREADY!! GRRRRR.... I believe I felt more welcome and appreciated at Carls Jr"
Ed M.,"Veneta, OR",0,52,,4.0,3/4/2012,"Granted, this is not a small town burger joint, but they are pretty consistent.   Had lunch there today, 6 of us, and all of us enjoyed our meals.  Two of us had the Black and blue burger.  Pink in the middle, nicely done.  I must admit it was very good.  True I was hungry, but I really enjoyed it.  The kids liked your basic kiddo foods, one had the chicken strips, the other the corn dog, both with fries.  The server was very attentive, the food was hot.  I have no complaints regarding this location."
Annie E.,"Washougal, WA",54,92,33,3.0,3/9/2011,This was your standard Applebees. The ladies were even nice enough to give us HH prices 20 minutes early since we'd just driven 3.5 hours to get there only to have a STINKY hotel...
Craig B.,"Eugene, OR",27,46,4,3.0,4/8/2011,"You know what you are going to get, average food, average prices, good, but not great service.  The two for twenty is a fair bargain, and I like that they offer Ninkasi Total Domination on tap at this location."
ashley e.,"Eugene, OR",4,33,2,3.0,10/30/2010,"It's an Applebee's people - you get what you pay for and you get what you expect.  There's a lot of cheese and a lot of salt, so either smack your lips or don't come down."
Mike F.,"Eugene, OR",6,23,8,3.0,10/24/2010,"Been here many times, over the past year. Franchise food is franchise food. That's good and bad. At least you know what to expect. Food is hit and miss here. Definitely need some consistency in their cooks. Staff is friendly and efficient, for the most part. They have had a lot of turnovers in help lately and it shows. It seems to reflect on that ""neighborhood bar"" atmosphere, not in a good way. Parking it good, and prices are Applebee prices."
