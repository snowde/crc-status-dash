Evelyn V.,"San Jose, CA",34,6,,5.0,1/6/2018,Order the Steak and Shrimp Parmesan. The food was amazing! I didn't expect much but omg was it good! The steak was thick and juicy. We couldn't get enough! This will definitely cause a food coma! Lol
Steve C.,"Auburn, WA",10,105,182,2.0,12/24/2017,"We stopped at this Applebee's location for lunch on our way north bound on Hwy 101.  The French Onion soup I started with was very good with a rich flavor. The restaurant wasn't quite full, but the food did take some time to arrive.  My better half 's Fish and Cole slaw was done beautifully, with the fish fried golden brown and tender and moist. Compared to my sirloin steak which was rather chewy with gristle. The starch on the plate which was potato tots on a bed of mash potato didn't quite work well together.   Service was minimal. Our server passed our table a few times without stopping to check to see if things were alright.  At the end of our meal, with the credit card transaction, a 20% gratuity was suggested after the total amount which we did not quite agree with the service we received.The total bill comes up on the trivia game machine on the table. You swipe your credit card into this machine and a 20% tip is calculated for you.  If this is the business practice with Applebee restaurants in place, in a way it helps encourage a slack in service practice from their employees without providing their best to customers and just take things for granted! I do believe we are done with Applebees if this is their practice."
Jennifer H.,"Folsom, CA",30,88,45,1.0,12/11/2017,"Don't try ordering to go: 1). Ordered ribs with honey sauce. Got ribs with spicy sauce. 2). Ordered brownie bite. Got Blondie brownie. Green beans were over cooked mush. Potatoes were ok. Ribs were over cooked. Not a fan of the blondie ""brownie"" but that might just be me. They did get the ice water right. So one star."
Chris C.,"Imperial Beach, CA",55,18,2,2.0,1/2/2018,"I'm driving down the coast with my family and staying the night here in Eureka. I wanted slightly better than fast food but not expensive restaurant prices so I chose Applebee's. I knew what I expected to get. So I ordered food on the phone so I could pick up and go to the hotel room, sit in my pjs and relax. As we arrived we were jovially greeted by a waitress. She was quick and efficient. I sat there for about ten minutes (I showed up early so I expected to wait) and watched waitresses cycle out the door for their smoke break. Eventually we got our food, paid the fair price and drove home. Upon setting out our food to dig in and enjoy I was greeted by several surprises. My first surprise is I had not received what I ordered. I asked for a chicken club and got a chicken burger. I guess it's kinda the same right? I mean they both have chicken... and bread.... well trying to be laid back I figured it was no big deal. Then I got my Second surprise..... we got a chicken oriental salad. Apparently they thought I wanted it rare. Cause that's how they served the ""crispy chicken."" In all fairness it was crispy on the outside so they technically told the truth. But the chicken was completely raw in the middle. So all in all if you want a low priced meal in this town I would think about looking somewhere else. I added one star because, like I said, the waitresses were nice."
Jeff S.,"Willow Creek, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/6/2018,I ordered their endless riblets and when I got them they where cold not even luk warm and when they brought me out hot ones I ate a couple and they were really good but then I got to my third or fourth piece it tested like soap then I took the pic I took a bite out of and t even smell like soap over the sauce so i asked for a manger and i told him what had happened and all he said was we wont charge you for your meal and then walked away then came back and gave a bull shit sorry im going to call their corporate office tomorrow he didnt say he would look in to it or nothing
Meagan B.,"Chico, CA",0,8,3,2.0,12/29/2017,"We don't expect much from Applebee's except a consistent food experience (you know what you're going to get) and timeliness. We ordered takeout here and asked for extra dressing for the salad when we got inside. They said yes, walked to the back and grabbed our food and specifically said the extra dressing is in there with the salad. We should know better but we assumed we were safe, drove to our hotel only find there was no salad and, understandably at this point, no extra dressing. Seems petty to be upset, but it's frustrating to get back and not have food for one person of the group - especially after you paid for it and tipped on it."
Bill K.,"Lake Placid, FL",0,11,1,4.0,12/6/2017,Very personable server. April did an outstanding job!! She was very attentive to our needs. The food was typical Applebee's food
Venus Elisha E.,"Eureka, CA",89,19,9,5.0,1/20/2017,"Good old Applebee's. I tend to be seated in the section a former classmate waits on, everytime I come to the restaurant :) She always greets me by name. The table there are usually sticky, but it's the territory of steakhouse sauces and delicious deserts. Not to mention sweet cocktails! One of the items brought to me was a bit below temp, and they had no problem fixing this for me. I love this location and I will be coming back."
Sara H.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",0,14,3,1.0,8/18/2017,The service was okay but the food lacked a lot. I would recommend lowering your expectations to nothing if you choose to eat here
Rachael T.,"Eureka, CA",79,7,28,3.0,7/11/2017,"Our server was great. The food was not. The sirloin steak was pretty good and I really enjoyed the sweet potatoes. Our waitress forgot our sweet potato fries but that wasn't really a big issue and they were out and fresh fairly quickly. The whiskey bacon burger was a disappointment. There was hardly any flavor, just tasteless calories."
Philina B.,"Eureka, CA",0,3,,4.0,12/2/2017,The food was great but way too expensive. For two people the bill came to over $50.00 and when we paid they automatically deducted the tip from our credit card! Pretty Sneaky :(
Trina L.,"Pollock Pines, CA",0,20,,1.0,11/25/2017,The restaurant was dirty. Dirty restrooms. Bad food and service. Would not recommend or revisit
MaryAnn H.,"Eureka, CA",0,129,272,1.0,9/10/2016,"I came here hesitantly hoping that my last experience wouldn't be as bad. The appetizers weren't anything special. Took a very long time to arrive with our (party of 5) drinks. My soup came cold like the cheese wasn't melted, it was still in slices. So we asked for another one. It was still cold and clearly was just microwaved. The pasta was bland and idk everything tasted cold. Would not give another try or recommend."
Alexandra D.,"Modesto, CA",0,11,,1.0,10/15/2017,Pasta was cold and the shrimp was barely warm. Said they were going to comp my meal but they didn't.
Denise L.,"Temecula, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/11/2017,"This is by far the worst Applebee's I have ever been to. They took forever to get our drinks, the appetizer took forever and not to mention it was cold, and when we finally got our food it was cold! I feel embarrassed for them! How is it possible to have such sh*tty businesse?"
Tyler R.,"Eureka, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/23/2017,So far so terrible. Cold food delivered. Ignored and forgotten drinks. The ranch dressing was warmer than the food. On top of everything else she forgot another order. Worst service ever. Honestly we shouldn't even have to pay for this. Genuinely will be the last time we eat here.
Jasmin L.,"Whittier, CA",19,7,2,1.0,3/16/2017,The waitress did a terrible job. Our drinks took almost 10min to arrive & our appetizers took another 30+ minutes. The people in front of us who got here way after we did got their appetizers before we did & the waitress rarely asked us if we needed anything or let us know how much longer our food was going to be. she charged us for things we weren't aware of & just assumed we wanted an upsize on our food & then charged us for that. I wouldn't recommend.
Danielle G.,"Morro Bay, CA",30,96,435,2.0,5/30/2016,Service was a little on the slow side. The food... Well... Yeah not so great. I was quickly reminded of why I quit going to Applebee's a long time ago.
Food L.,"Eureka, CA",3,53,7,1.0,6/3/2016,"Our Server Kim barely paid any attention to us, it was like she was in her own little world. It was a slow Sunday night. Every time she came to the table she wouldn't acknowledge everybody when someone asked for something she would turn away before anyone else could ask for something and then she'd be gone a while. We had no napkins with our appetizers. We had to ask for utensils more then once. She never removed any dirty glasses off our table just kept bringing refills in new glasses. We had to start putting empty plates and glasses behind us on another table to make room. My girlfriend said she had this same server two times before and her service was poor then.  The overall service of the whole restaurant was poor. We sat in the middle of dirty tables for the two hours we were there. Our food was Luke warm, but we ate it as is because we knew we wouldn't see our server for a while. My mashed sweet potatoes ended up having a paper tag with a date on it in them that I found towards the end of the meal. The manager came over to apologize but I had to ask for a discount. Come on really? You wouldn't just discount it on your own or take it off the bill? Unfortunately we only left a 10% tip on a $160 bill and we almost didn't leave that.  I've eaten at the bar before and have good  service but this was the worst service I've had out in a while."
Nicole H.,"Santa Maria, CA",30,17,,4.0,12/16/2016,"I love going here. But I must note that sometimes are order of dessert don't make it out or one occasion a wrong order came out, slightly wrong, this happened only once and it was busy. Overall, the food is delicious and I love the desserts. Love the location by the mall. I think that as a tip servers be more attentive, other than that I'd recommend and do continue to keep going."
Carina M.,"Lamont, CA",1,9,,1.0,12/1/2016,I'm sure we waited an hour for our food! While our server was at the bar serving drinks! I got up twice to get us a refill on drinks!
Jolene L.,"Woodland, WA",67,2,,1.0,7/25/2016,"HORRIBLE SERVICE! HAD to ask for silverware, had to ask them to clean our table that was sticky, had to ask for sauce for steak, had to ask for water, etc.... waitress was never around  and was rude when she was there. Very disappointed in this establishment."
Chris W.,"Eureka, CA",4,4,,4.0,6/16/2016,"I'm suprised by the bad reviews. I went on a couple hours ago. The place was packed, but the waitress was polite and prompt. The food was delicious and the atmosphere friendly. As the son of a career waitress, I know how hard those people work."
Kris M.,"McKinleyville, CA",3,28,5,2.0,2/26/2017,"18 minutes before someone even asked us if we wanted anything to drink, another 10 minutes past that before we were asked if we were ready to order, an hour all together before food got to the table. The kids activity sheets are going to need to have a lot more activities on them if all three kids are going to stay occupied for an hour.  They complained after about 30 minutes because they were hungry, bored, and generally displeased with having to wait forever.  It was the longest meal I've ever been involved in.  This applebees experience sucked.  The food wasn't bad, (not fantastic though either) and our server (even tho she took forever) gave my daughter an ice cream because she overheard me talking to her about a birthday meal I would cook her because she didn't like the steak she ordered.  Glad she overheard me talking and was paying attention because it was the only thing that night that made my daughter smile."
Charise A.,"McKinleyville, CA",8,7,2,1.0,3/10/2017,"If I could give no stars I would. I went here with my boyfriend for a late lunch. Upon walking in, I noticed the place was extremely dirty. The floor looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years, the walls and blinds were covered in gunk and dirt and even food! Eeeek! I couldn't even keep an appetite. Made me wonder what the kitchen looked like. Regardless, we ordered, our server was nice. I got a four cheese mac and he got a club sandwich. They weren't very busy but the food took way too long. Once we got it, the food wasn't warm and my mac and cheese was more like soup and tasteless. His club sandwich was so soggy he couldn't eat it and it all fell apart. I felt bad for our server so I wanted to talk to the manager but she was interviewing a prospective employee in the lobby in front of guests. We barely ate and paid the check and left. I'm horrified. I will never eat there again. If it was just a busy day and their chef was not on his game that's one thing. But as a restaurant manager myself, the cleanliness was shocking. There has to be a health code violation for this place. I've always loved Applebee's but I will never go to this location again. Gross!"
Gemara J.,"Clovis, CA",5,1,,1.0,8/2/2016,Terrible service. Has to ask for refills on our drinks and condiments for my son's corndog. Asked several different servers for different things and apparently no one has the capacity to remember anything cuz we finally had to get up and get it ourself. Very disappointed.
Jason F.,"Grandview, MO",0,5,,4.0,8/10/2016,The servers were friendly and attentive. My Triple Bacon Burger was very juicy and quite delicious. The ranch dressing isn't spectacular but my wife's Mudslide was delivered quickly and quite delicious.
Graham S.,"Dublin, CA",0,17,1,5.0,8/15/2016,"Everything waa great! We came for Monday night burgers and they were divine. Taylor, our waitress, was quick, courteous, and attentive. All of the staff was very nice. We'll definitely be coming back!"
Heather M.,"Eureka, CA",101,6,,3.0,7/6/2016,"Awesome mixed drinks and appetizers!!! Nice vibe and atmosphere, liked it better with the local memorabilia, but I understand you must move with the times! Portions are fair... Love their Trippe Chocolate Meltdowns for dessert! A real warm, chocolately treat! I reccomend!"
Stephanie C.,"Eureka, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/25/2016,"Terrible food. Everything tastes pre-cooked, frozen, then re-heated. We stopped eating there after the second time I found glass in my food,then thought we'd give it another shot after the remodel. Somehow it was worse."
Danielle T.,"Willow Creek, CA",6,81,18,4.0,3/16/2016,"Had lunch with a good friend at Apple Bee's yesterday. We both shared the nachos for our appetizer, the nachos were soo good and very filling..they could be a meal, I recommend them. She got the three cheese macaroni and cheese (with chicken tenders and bacon...it's the bomb), and I got the club grille with sweet potatoe fries and a cosmopolitan during happy our (it surprisingly ran around $1.68)"
Danielle B.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,,4.0,3/31/2016,I complained about how the service was super SUPER slow and the manager called to give us free entrees and promised that our next time would be better and it was! Much faster service and happier-looking employees. I will go back.
Joel P.,"San Francisco, CA",1,16,,2.0,3/24/2016,The techno dance music was not relaxing and too loud.   Felt like I was eating a cheese burger at a rave party.   Which brings me to my second point; The Beer Garden burger sucks!!
Michael A.,"Eureka, CA",0,25,5,3.0,8/8/2014,"The food had good taste and the food service was good. For some reason the Bar Service at this restaurant is really slow. We were there about 3pm and it still took 20 minutes to get our drinks. The only other drawback was the portion size, see picture of the steak."
Bonnie P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",12,1,,2.0,1/25/2017,"The food here is usually pretty good but service is terrible.  Tonight, My boyfriend and I were told after standing in the lobby for 5 minutes that we would be seated after a table was wiped down. We watched them wipe it down then... 10 minutes later we were allowed to sit.  Another 10 minutes, and the manager finally came to our table to take our drink and app order.  I ordered a margarita with no salt.  It came with salt.  Our server didn't show up until our appetizer and drinks were on the table.  Food came out in a timely fashion and was delivered by a very young food runner.  We ordered 2 more drinks, both of those came without salt like I originally asked.  We finished our food and drinks and waited around for our server to notice that we wanted to leave.  By the time we got our bill I was pretty annoyed and only left a 10% tip.  Idk if they give their servers too many tables or too little training, but I can pretty much guarantee terrible service and ok food if you go here.  Don't go here on a date, the shit service will kill the mood."
Miguel G.,"Eureka, CA",207,16,26,5.0,6/5/2015,"These guys are doing a great job! It's not often you see a chain restaurant or any restaurant in this area where drinks are prepared to look great as well as food. And the staff was great as well. It could have been quicker but I'm sure the waitress was busy as a bee so I understand. Something that I thought was really great is that the gentleman waiting tables brought my food to my table. I really liked how they worked as a team, this shows how well managed this restaurant is. I respect the level of service these folks have provided me the past few visits. Kudos! Gracias!"
Shari C.,"Eureka, CA",0,18,5,1.0,1/8/2016,Both our sandwiches were burnt. They charged us for games at the table that never worked. Nothing was good but the ice water. We will NEVER waste our money here again!
Rebeccah C.,"Oakley, CA",106,47,13,5.0,4/3/2015,"I must've gotten lucky the 3 times I've come here. We just moved to the area and we like this applebees a lot. I've been to quite a few Applebees in the past, and this one is equally as good as the rest. All of our food came out quickly, and well prepared. The servers are SO NICE. Applebees isn't supposed to be fancy, it's basically a glorified bar. Cut them a break guys. Yeesh."
T B.,"Coos Bay, OR",0,105,56,4.0,3/14/2016,"Had two for $25.00 both had steak and sides . Food was fresh hot and good flavor and cooked correct . Waitress was fast ,friendly made suggestions . We were seated fast no waiting .Great meal Thanks ."
Sheila M.,"Eureka, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/13/2015,"My mom wanted to go to Applebee's again for lunch, as she loves the appetizers. Since I have the best mom in the world I took her there for lunch today. It was pleasant with exceptional service. We arrived and requested a particular waiter who has ALWAYS given exceptional service. We found out his name was Vic, if you go to Applebee's and want a pleasant experience request Vic's section!"
