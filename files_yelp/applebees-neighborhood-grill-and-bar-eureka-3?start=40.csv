Marissa A.,"Crescent City, CA",3,7,,5.0,10/3/2015,It was my birthday today and applebees not only made it very special but they went to every extent to make sure we were happy and going good. Such a good crew and amazing place I'll be coming back.
Kaytie K.,"Bend, OR",63,6,34,1.0,1/16/2015,"Service was mediocre, food was mediocre! By the time we got our food, 4 adults, 1 child, it was luke warm, on the fringe of cold.  Food tastes fine, but the fact that all of our dishes were almost cold, was very disappointing. Best part of the meal was the twisted fry appetizer! I will mostly only visit Applebee's for this!"
rob w.,"Eureka, CA",1,20,,3.0,10/24/2014,"I have mixed feelings on Applebees, and both sides of my emotional roller coaster come from the fact that it is corporate.  What do our corporate overlords provide: *Consistent food *Very tasty recipes that were undoubtedly focus group tested *Price competitiveness  *Some very good specials such as happy hour the gift card promotion *Forced humiliation of a birthday patron What our corporate overlords withhold:  *A workplace that keeps employees so when you develop a relationship with a server, you get to enjoy that server again and again. *A natural dialogue with staff that isn't scripted to the point of ridiculousness.  (note: we were once asked to do a survey, which essentially let us know that all the conversations we had been having with staff were mandated by training protocols, such as ""did the manager greet you during your meal?"" and ""were you told 'see you tomorrow?'"" while leaving, and ""where you presented with new menu options by your server?"") *Dignity for the servers that must humiliate the birthday patron So while I cannot say that I will not dine with the devil, I am also not in a hurry to go back anytime soon.  But bang for the buck still compels me to give a well earned three stars."
Roxanne R.,"McKinleyville, CA",46,239,8,1.0,3/3/2013,"It's Applebee's, so what should I be expecting besides dry, sat under a heat lamp for too long food. Also over priced, watered down with half the amount of alcohol in it that should be drinks.  I hate the high tables, they have no hooks underneath them, so if you're a normal woman who carries a purse you have to sit it up on the table, which can be difficult and take up a lot of room if there's more than one of you. It makes it worse that the tables are always sticky."
Paul S.,"Atascadero, CA",220,801,975,4.0,12/19/2012,"Get the Napa Chicken and Portobello Mushrooms dish and ask them to cook it a bit on the charred side. It is super tasty. The waitress who took our order was Britley and she was exceedingly friendly, checking in every so often to make sure all was well, and even snapped off a few family photos. The other waitresses serving the other tables seemed to be friendly as well, so props to the management for running a tight ship. Normally I'm not too crazy about chain restaurants like Denny's or Applebee's, but these guys earned four stars when I visited them."
Amber F.,"Vancouver, WA",6,16,5,5.0,7/12/2014,I don't know what these people rating 2 stars know about food and service but this place has always been amazing to me. Went for a date night and the service was attentive and delightful! I got the 9oz sirloin with red mashed potatoes and steamed veggies and it was all perfect! I wanted my steak medium rare and that's what I got to perfection!!! :) I will continue to go here again and again! :)
Gerardo M.,"Eureka, CA",0,3,4,1.0,3/27/2013,"We are traveling back from Mendocino to Corvallis, OR; about a 10 hour road trip. Our group of 7 ordered, nothing big or complicated, while there was only five other people in the restaurant.  We placed our order at 11:27am. It felt as if our food would be done quickly and we'd be on the road again by 12:00. After much delayed wait, the restaurant began to fill up for lunch hour. Our food did not arrive until 12:15. Almost a 50 minute wait for 3 burgers, two quesadillas, one salad, and a pasta bowl. This is a shame. I'd have lots of indignation if I was the manager and shame as a local. Do not stop here if you expect quick service or wish to not feel irritated about waiting time."
Matt N.,"Bayside, CA",49,59,27,2.0,4/17/2013,The only reason they are getting a second star is because of our waitress she was very nice. The kitchen staff is obviously brain dead tell them i cant have butter or mayo sure enough it came out dripping in butter and mayo the server documented it very well  now I'm sick to my stomach way to go Applebee's in case u cant tell that was sarcasm
Emma F.,"Eureka, CA",2,4,,3.0,8/16/2014,It's really a hit or miss one time my service and food was great and the next cold fries and the server completely ignored us.
Melvin B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,43,71,4.0,8/23/2014,Food was great. Just took too long for it to arrive. Came on a Saturday at 7pm. Maybe that had to do something with it.
Kim S.,"San Diego, CA",3,20,7,4.0,10/25/2014,"this place has definitely gotten better since i first went here. Every time my boyfriend and I come here now were greeted with a smile and the food is always delicious, the last few times i've went there I had the steak from the 2 for 20 menu and is was probably the most delicious steak i've ever had. So they have definitely upped their game. The service has definitely been upgraded too. The only thing I would complain about is the soda price, come on 3 dollars?! I guess thats corporations for you."
Kathy S.,"Nampa, ID",1,2,,2.0,10/17/2014,Utensils were dirty. Food took a long time to come out.  Went for lunch.  It was dark inside and the furniture needs to be replaced.
shelli s.,"Arcata, CA",5,22,3,3.0,1/28/2015,It really being the only local chain resturants it works for me every once in awhile. It is nice when the breweries are packed on game days to slip in there and watch a ballgame without a lot of noise.
Elizabeth C.,"Waddy, KY",20,260,585,3.0,11/12/2012,The food is always reliable... the service can be hit or miss.. and for some reason I always have to ask twice for appetizers and end up getting them after my entree.  They are slow on drink refills too...
Skeeter S.,"Victorville, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/29/2014,"I ordered the salad and received about half the normal portion size.  For an Applebee's, this location was not very good.  When I said something to the waitress she told me the dinner salad sized salad was the normal portion served for their full sized salads."
Thai D.,"Arden-Arcade, Sacramento, CA",7,2,,2.0,8/17/2015,"Service was cool, food is ok, but the cooks need to get they act together. Like cmon 2 and a half hour for my meal when i just ordered mac n cheese and it wasnt even busy. Smh! Get it together now people!"
Kelly M.,"Eureka, CA",2,11,,1.0,4/7/2015,"I used to really like applebees. Their food was decent and affordably priced. I don't eat out often, so after a lengthy absence from visiting this applebees, I returned with my parents in tow. When I arrived, I found that the place was being remodeled and was looking rather nice. So we sat down and I went to order one of my favorite appetizers, the green bean crispers with horse radish, only to be told that they don't have horse radish anymore. Ok, ok, so I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. We ordered drinks and a dinner each. Our dinner arrived before our appetizer, which we had to ask for because ""it was pushed off to one side and I forgot it."" Ok, so things happen. The food quality was awful. The best part of our meal was the cold appetizer. And the pricing was outrageous for the portions we received. For what we paid, we could have gone to the sea grill and been happier. Essentially, quality of food has been recently downgraded and the prices upgraded. Sorry, but I will never again be visiting this establishment."
Zia f.,"Sonoma, CA",0,12,,1.0,8/22/2015,We ordered 3 meals and kids meal and all came back bad. Poor service and poor food. My wife got sick afterwards. All four of us were very unhappy.
Trinity S.,"Fortuna, CA",2,37,22,5.0,6/11/2014,"I don't know if it's under new ownership or if they just hired all new staff but Applebee's has really stepped their game up.  The last two times we've been in have been great.  The hostess seats you within a minute, the waitresses are super friendly & check in on you pretty often.  The food has been excellent (try the Bourbon Black & Bleu Burger, it's delish!). The mojito's actually taste like a mojito instead of watered down Kool-Aid & they started carrying real beer like Total Domination (which made my fiancé very happy).  I'm not sure what they did but it's like a whole new place.  We will definitely be stopping here whenever we visit Eureka for now on.  Keep up the great service & food!  :)"
Henry B.,"Oakland, CA",14,25,,3.0,8/22/2013,"They have three-dollar margaritas during happy hour (3-6), which makes it totally worth it to go, but don't get the Bourbon Street Sirloin. It is the saltiest steak I have ever eaten, even after blotting the sauce off with a napkin. According to the site's nutrition facts, it has 1,050 mg of sodium. YIKES."
