Jay M.,"Eureka, CA",12,14,,3.0,3/23/2015,Food is always pretty decent. Service can be hit or miss. How i like to think about it is would i be bummed if this place closed down? Yes.
Jo N.,"Sonoma County, CA",37,424,69,2.0,7/29/2010,"Ok, yes it is the same chain food menu as everywhere else.  I'd like to address how dirty and shabby everything is at this particular location.  I felt nervous when we were walking in because of the poor condition of the exterior, but figured I was being too critical. Nope, the inside was also run down.  I wouldn't expect a chain to let their store go into disrepair such as this has.  Wonder what the kitchen looks like....kitchen nightmare?"
Kay A.,"Modesto, CA",168,130,39,3.0,6/2/2011,"I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants but my sister, and my cousin and her boyfriend wanted to eat here because it's a familiar restaurant in an unfamiliar place. The first thing that we noticed is that this placed was packed. The parking lot was busy and there were many groups patronizing the restaurant. We were seated quickly but service was slow. I don't think this is intentional, I just strongly believe that everything in Eureka is a little slower than in the Bay Area which can be nice when you just want to chill and unwind at the end of the day.  What makes this place unique is the atmosphere, as in the people, which is very different from what you'd get from the Bay Area... I don't know if you can tell but I'm having a bit of a culture shock. I just moved to Humboldt County and everything is.... different.  The waitstaff and the general friendly environment made the visit worth it. I'll come back again... albeit, with a full stomach (since the food is just OK) and an eagerness to drink some beer."
Michelle A.,"Seattle, WA",0,5,,1.0,12/21/2012,"I've been here a few times, it's nice to have a couple chains in Humboldt county to eat at when you're from a bigger city and feel homesick. But I've stopped going for good. The service has gone severely downhill, and last time I went we ordered all our food pretty quickly... which then took an hour and ten minutes to come out. No one refilled my water, I waved two waiters down twice to simply ask how much longer they might think... and they'd say they would check and never return. When we finally got our food, our waitress (who finally appeared after an hour and a half, seriously) gave us the check right away and didn't even say thanks. And the food tasted like it had been sitting out for 20 minutes... a little dry, a little room temperature, not acceptable. Just go to a local restaurant, they're better."
Paul S.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,50,15,1.0,5/16/2010,"Redneck central.  I sat at the bar and got just about the worst service I've ever had anywhere.  The bartender treated me like I just made off with his wife.  Won't look me in the eye, won't answer basic questions, such as ""what kind of beer is that with the XYZ tap handle?"".  Serves every step of the meal in complete silence.  I have to flag him down for everything. Yet, he turns right around and treats everybody else at the bar like they are his best friends forever.  Turns out, as I'm eating, I discover all 8 people at the bar (save for myself) are eureka applebees employees.   I've never seen such an uppety redneck with such an unbelievable chip on his shoulder for somebody who's major crime against the universe is not living in this lovely town.  Maybe someday I can move here, come in every single day, and earn mr. Mgraw's basic common courtesy as a food service professional.  Until then I will forever be the outsider made to feel uncomfortable in no uncertain terms, by lord yocal of redneckshire himself. Food - typical applebees.  Ok.  Except for the medium rare steak which came out well done.  Not worth arguing.  Have a nice life eureka applebees ""pm bartender"" who can't even wear a nametag or put your real name on the receipt.  I for one will not be back.  Hopefully your fellow employees will keep you in business."
Caitlin E.,"Eureka, CA",124,61,20,1.0,9/26/2014,"Frozen, processed, over priced food. But isn't that what people expect from Applebee's? If you have the drunk muchies, it's the perfect place."
Patti C.,"Fresno, CA",2,21,,4.0,9/12/2012,Great service and I love the chicken wings. Always consistent.
Emily J.,"Eureka, CA",60,13,,5.0,9/17/2013,"2 for 20 deal Ouuu yeah. I like there chips and artichoke dip appetizer and the boneless wings. The artichoke dip is so addicting. I didn't like it the first time I tried it, but second time around I was seriously chowing it down. Their steaks like the bourbon steak is okay also. Can't expect much since its so cheap for the deal. Its salty. Tell the waiter that you want no salt, butter , or seasoning, that's what I do and it comes out a lot better. They already marinate it with salt so why add more when its cooking."
Kevin C.,"Box Elder, SD",9,55,24,2.0,10/3/2011,"I would not recommend this if you are wanting fresh. My salad was full of brown lettuce and quite wilted. I had the club sandwich and it was ok, the beacon was cooked perfect but the bread wad so soggy it couldn't hold everything together. Ok for quick family chain restaurant style food."
K A.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",4,18,1,3.0,6/18/2014,We were seated very quickly but the service for drinks and food was a little slow. Food wasnt horrible for just the appetizers we had. Wait staff was friendly enough though.
Ryan H.,"Eureka, CA",3,34,11,5.0,2/7/2009,"Oh, come on now: Enough with these Bay Area prudes. Yeah, it's a chain (duh). And yes, the menus are laminated with pictures. The wait staff are young, eager and top-notch -- in a 50s-diner sort of way. Sure, the decor is cheesy and the drink menu is replete with dubious concoctions, but still, all the basics are covered. If what you're looking for is a huge cheeseburger, fries and a beer, and a cheerful server -- and want it quickly because you've got family who just flew in from the Midwest -- you can't go wrong. I've never been to the bar but, mysteriously, it keeps getting voted Best Bar (Times-Standard). Go figure."
Eric N.,"Eureka, CA",46,4,18,1.0,11/6/2014,"Wow...I went in to Applebee's for a quick lunch with my son.  We ordered a plain hamburger to split and I ordered a Sam Adams.  We had to wait 45 minutes for a simple burger when they weren't even busy, ticket comes and I realize that my bottle of Sam Adams was $5.85.  Six packs of Sam Adams are $4.50 at the corner liquor store.  I asked why it was so expensive and was met with extreme rudeness.  Why would a simple bottle of mass-produced beer be so expensive?  All in all our order was $25 including a split plate charge, and our burger didn't come split or with two plates, why the charge?  For one beer and a plain burger.  I left without tipping, obviously, and was chased into the parking lot by our server to ask me why I didn't tip her.  She was rude and overcharged us for simple food, why would I tip?  It's a gratuity, I don't have to tip, especially when the service is rude.  I'd be stupid to want to ever go back"
Daniel Y.,"Portland, OR",6,15,,1.0,12/28/2010,"We were on our way back to Portland from a trip to SF on Thanksgiving. We got in and felt that service was OK, if not somewhat detached and routinely. Ordered three dishes for the family. I can't really come up with words to accurately describe how uniquely bad they were. I guess I could say they were off beat. Pizza had no flavor but full of salt, the so-called orange chicken was hopelessly blend and had no character, and the pasta was simply overcooked and tasted exactly like ketchup. I felt really bad for all the locals who have nowhere else to go. And thankfully we will never have to go back there. This place needs a new chef, and they need one now."
Nancy D.,"Eureka, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/8/2013,"They should train the cooks not to burn food and send out for people to eat.  My friend and I received hamburgers burnt, order was not right, gave us wrong side orders.  Had to wait a long time for meal( taking a lot of time to burn burgers) Not going back, plenty of good places to eat....but not here...."
Chris O.,"Portland, OR",590,1676,261,4.0,6/16/2010,"It's still the same old crappy dairy, protein, carb, not a veggie in sight Applebee's style food. But the service was great and I love the area :)"
Chelsea H.,"Cutten, CA",10,66,11,3.0,1/8/2008,yeah its Applebee's just a fancy'er Denny's but the food here is actually pretty good as long as you are not looking for somthing like French Laundry.  But we are in Humboldt County and i cant seem to find anything that comes even close to that. And the other thing that they have here that Denny's does not is a bar and the bartender did make a really good top shelf cosmo. So it was pretty fun to drink cockel-tail during lunch while lookiing at all the crap on the walls.
Aaron c.,"Eureka, CA",0,16,,2.0,6/22/2011,"Rude service, the bartender looked like somebody who lives down in the palco marsh. The food was o.k."
AL S.,"San Diego, CA",206,579,218,2.0,1/22/2009,"I walked through the doors and was seated and as I was sitting there I thought to myself, I never imagined myself sitting at an applebees in Eureka. A poor choice on my part but was the only place that was open outside of arcata. This is one of those places that you think is inexpensive but when you really look at the prices its quite the opposite. I'm vegetarian so the only think I could get besides fries was their pizza. It was mediocre and definately not worth $8 dollars."
Daniel L.,"Beaver Dam, WI",0,3,,1.0,11/24/2010,"Wow! I usually like Applebee's. Not this one!  I walked in the door and waited to be seated.  Nobody helped me out.  I just found a place to sit by myself.  They were not busy at all.  I ordered a steak, garlic mashed potato's and steamed veggies.  It seemed like it took forever to get my meal (lunch).  When I did finally get it the mashed potato's were DEAD COLD.  Seemed like they took some out of the frig and plopped them on my plate.  The so called ""steamed"" veggies were one step in front of the potato's.  Almost dead cold.  The steak was not bad but not cooked to my order.  I had to ask the waitress for my check because they never came around to see how you were doing.  I will never be back at this place."
