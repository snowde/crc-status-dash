Elder Sarah S.,"Bothell, WA",33,23,8,4.0,10/9/2017,"I am not a Applebee's fan, but I was impressed by there burgers. Definitely there Monday deal.. any burger with fries for 8.99. I got the breakfast burger minus the egg.. great and tasty"
Reina D.,"Everett, WA",0,19,3,3.0,5/29/2017,"Ordered Thai shrimp salad.  Although supposed to be Thai the shrimp had a Cajun tasting seasoning and the veggie part of the salad was about a handful of premix romaine mainly and shredded carrots with some edamame.  Needs work!  At about $13 very disappointing.  Also had the fish and chips, fries were good fish was crunchy but heavy on the batter just ok.  They have many other dishes that we've tried that are actually very good like the chicken wonton tacos, bourbon street chicken and shrimp and surprisingly their steaks are more often than not quite good. The rating was more based on the service vs the food.  Everything was ok until she came to the table and said use the tabletop computer to pay.  She was nice and friendly about it but the expectation to do no more work since we were done eating.  I took that to mean I'm too lazy to bring you a check and process your payment.  I normally do utilize this to pay to make it easier on the server especially when they are busy.  She had one other table besides us and her goal seemed to be to chat with coworkers rather than service customers."
Jessica W.,"Everett, WA",2,2,,2.0,4/28/2017,The running joke with a number of our friends that the place should be called Crapplebees.  I had been given a $50 gift card so after avoiding the place for years we decided to give it another try.  The photos and descriptions in the menu looked promising but when the food was served we knew nothing has changed.  I would rather eat a burger from McDonalds than the burger they serve.  The other dishes my family ordered were no better.   I gave it two stars because the staff was great we just don't like the food.  Needless to say the server got a generous tip since I knew we wouldn't be back and just tipped the remainder of the gift card.
Randy C.,"Snohomish, WA",55,383,61,2.0,11/16/2016,"We end up going here because it's Sunday night and I'm lazy. The service in the bar is hit or miss depending on whether the server has friends at the bar. The food is OK, just OK. Nothing special or memorable. Yelp says I've checked in 10 times, probably more."
Lacey D.,"Snohomish, WA",71,7,5,1.0,10/21/2016,"I think this is the first negative review I have ever given. But we have had so many issues with this Applebees. I work down the road and we order out all the time. Although we won't be ordering from here anymore. We had bad/cold food the two other times we had gotten food from here, but I figured we could give it another chance. Two of us got sweet potato fries which consisted of about 10 cold fries in the bottom of the container. I posted a picture. It looks like the tossed someone's leftovers in there. I don't know who could look at that and think ""this will satisfy our customers"". And they got the burger orders wrong too. Strike 3 is enough to keep me from returning."
Janell U.,"Snohomish, WA",50,18,,1.0,3/29/2017,I am not sure what has happened to the food at Applebee's. But it truly is terrible now. Even my kids don't like it anymore. Room temperature french fries. Hard chicken tenders. Nothing about the food is good.
Karl K.,"Everett, WA",34,89,87,4.0,10/20/2015,"Well....It could have been a 1 or a 5.   Applebees is Applebees, you know what you are going to get each and every visit. We (My wife, her sister and I) went for Monday Night Football and 1/2 burgers. I ordered a Brunch Burger, the waitress asked if I want to add onion rings for $1 more, sure.  When it arrived, there were 4 rings on my plate.  Yes, 4 rings.  I commented to the server, he said that was normal, I made a comment about it being ridiculous.  Really, 4 rings on an upsell? I took a photo for this post. I asked that our waitress come by the table.  Before that could happen, the manager promptly delivered 4 more. They did the right thing, they fixed their ridiculous portion size.  The second mis-cue occurred.  My sister in law asked for her steak to be extremely rare, it arrived of course medium well.  The manager came by to see how we were doing, she pointed out her over-cooked steak.  The manager promptly returned with a  whole new steak dinner, very rare. very good.  Her entire meal was free (we did not ask). So, 2 out of 3 meals were delivered sub-par; however, the manager stepped up and did the right thing (we did need the steak for free) and made out meals right. We spent 3 hours in the bar eating, drinking and watching football.  Our original waitress was very friendly as was the entire staff. Yes, the brunch burger was great (however, not a heart healthy meal), the onions rings were great, and the second steak was perfect. Will I return? Sure, its in the neighborhood and we know what to expect.  1 star for all the failures, 5 stars for doing the right thing and a killer burger."
Eric G.,"Mill Creek, WA",65,6,,1.0,6/16/2016,"If you read most of the reviews here, the main reason people go is that it is close and really the only sit down restaurant in the area.    Food is just nothing short of gross.  I'm pretty sure diarrhea is coming in about an hour."
Martee S.,"Seal Beach, CA",1,6,,1.0,9/15/2016,"Horrific, we ordered some appetizers and a stir fry!! Soooo bad, nachos first served cheese not melted returned to us with vile fake cheese stuff! Meat was sooooo salty! Wonton tacos SOOO GREASY and sauce sugary and greasy fried! Stir Fry had sirloin, so tough you could not chew it , spit it out in a napkin! I had held off writing a poor review because I thought that the bad food was just one location, not so! I have had similar poor quality issues at at over three locations in two different states ( Sierra Vista, AZ and 2 locations in  Western WA! Crapple Bees need to take a look at the decline in quality and care of the food, it's terrible! On the up side servers were great in all locations!"
Kylie M.,"Snohomish, WA",0,18,,5.0,6/24/2017,Everything I tasted here tonight was divine. The service was fantastic too. Lovely night out - we'll be back!
Niklas A.,"Snohomish, WA",2,8,3,4.0,4/22/2017,Very friendly place. Good food in comparison to the price. Great environment. I enjoy it every time that I eat at this location. Highly recommend
Ryeder S.,"Bothell, WA",0,2,9,5.0,7/28/2016,I have no idea why every body hates on Applebees so much. This location has some of the nicest and most attentive staff you can find and the food is nothing short of fantastic for the price. The 2 for twenty meals are a great deal!
T. R.,"Bothell, WA",5,138,36,2.0,7/19/2016,"This place is unpredictable. One day you can get great service and food and the next, it is a total disaster. With the location being close to home and the cheap prices, it is a good place for a family to dine. Unfortunately the inconsistencies prevent me or my family from coming back."
Shawnti J.,"Mill Creek, WA",144,106,412,1.0,11/22/2015,"My husband an I came to this spot for a quick lunch date because its is near our neighborhood. We've see the commercials and thought that we would give it a try. Our server (Kianni) was wonderful. We were seated promptly and in a great spot. The place was pretty quiet for lunch time on a weekday and that should have been our first clue. My husband ordered the Fiesta Chicken Chopped Salad and I had the Lunch Combo: 4-Cheese Mac & Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders and the Clubhouse Grille. My food tasted like it had been cooked yesterday and warmed up the microwave to luke-warm. The flavor was awful. The salad would have been the better way to go, but even that was not tasty.  I can see that this place may be great to hang with friends on game day, when you've had some beers are only expecting bar-food standards. But, sad to say, we won't be going to this or any other Applebee's in the future for lunch or dinner."
Bill S.,"Everett, WA",0,3,,3.0,3/19/2016,"Well... what can I say  It's Applebee's. My family has been calling it Crapplebee's for years due to the usual poor service and ""meh""-quality food. There used be some really cool posters on the walls a few years back, but the new remodel, in my opinion, is a downgrade.     Anyway, me and my female friend went in for some late night food. We were expecting to be waiting for awhile to get our appetizers but they came out right away. Our food followed shortly after. We were shocked since the service has never been that good. Our server was attentive and outgoing. We had a great time as we overheard the drunks in the bar yammering. The food was good for an Applebee's and we left with our expectations exceeded. Applebee's, we see you  Keep improving and we will back for more very soon."
Cat P.,"Everett, WA",0,58,,2.0,1/15/2017,"Closest to home, by default have come pretty frequently. Sadly, we won't be coming back.  Too much inconsistency with food quality. Service usually okay, but have had nothing but trouble with curb side to go.  No trouble with other local Applebees tho."
Angie H.,"Bothell, WA",258,184,127,3.0,7/8/2014,"It's Applebee's - It isn't going to blow me away...and you are probably familiar with most of the food - So, I am going to tell you some things about Applebee's - things that maybe....just maybe you didn't know. :) 1.  Hey Mom?  They have a kick ass kids menu!!  (I posted pictures of the menu). 2.  Happy Hour is not just served ""in the bar"" - it is available at every table - I am not sure... but I believe Happy Hour is from 4-6 and 9-close.  Long Island Iced Teas are on the Happy Hour Menu...and like $5.  Perfect for HOT days 3.  Monday nights, all burgers are $5.99 and you can also order a pitcher of beer for $5.99!! So, if you are looking for something to satisfy the whole family, their food isn't WOW - but it is consistent. Wanna try it?  How about you grab the kids, go on Monday at 4:00, grab the jalapeno burger (for $5.99), and order a Long Island Iced Tea? It won't break the bank. :)"
Dave B.,"Everett, WA",3,29,3,2.0,7/2/2015,If you're in the mood for microwaved food... Servers pow-wow around a table within earshot of you and talk smack about each other and customers. Bourbon street steak will surprise you. Not bad.  The food isn't very good but...it'll make a tird
Wes W.,"Everett, WA",0,5,,5.0,7/26/2016,"Great food, but service can be subpar at times. I keep going back here often, so they must be doing something right."
James J.,"Bothell, WA",2,16,10,3.0,3/28/2016,"The service here is great, I love the staff. The food is 'ok' and I feel priced right for the quality. Monday night has great burger specials at $7. The beer selection is pretty lean, about 12 total. Just a good overall neighborhood bar and grill"
Jarrod J.,"Lynnwood, WA",13,5,,2.0,11/22/2015,"First Applebee's I went to after working as a dish wash for a branch out in the midwest for a few months a year ago. Food is your standard frozen food that's spiced up to look like fresh food. It was close, and I was hungry. New menu, or to me at least, isn't that appealing. The table tablet thing at the table made cringe. Anyways, the Dishwash on staff that night did a thorough job of cleaning the plates. No specks of previous food on the plate. No signs of mold residue, or anything sickly. Food is Applebee's quality. Took me at least 5 minutes to be seated in the desolate place. Server, Saul, didn't refill the drinks, or didn't bother to ask. Attempted to take my plate when he assumed I was done with it, again without asking. I wasn't in control of the payment, but that guy didn't deserve a tip. Overall, standard Applebee's experience minus the screaming child from across the restaurant."
Katie N.,"Long Beach, CA",63,33,24,4.0,2/25/2016,"I like this particular applebee's better than any other in the Everett area.  It is busy, but not crazy busy.  The wait staff is excellent and even more efficient than any other Applebee's in the area. And it is extremely clean on the inside, bathrooms and outside!"
Namtran V.,"Seattle, WA",200,85,123,3.0,12/7/2014,"New table tablets where you can order food, play games while waiting, and swipe your card at the table. Nice and convenient, I like! It costs .99 to unlock all the games if you're into that. We ordered food from our waitress and ordered another item from the tablet. The food from the tablet came out 10 minutes before the rest of our food since it sends the order straight to the kitchen. Interesting."
Doron Y.,"Everett, WA",11,18,5,1.0,12/28/2013,"Just finished eating at Applebee's. What can I say that other people have not said already?  We placed an order of sliders. How hard is it to cook? The cook was able to mess them up!! When they arrived they were raw inside!!!  We sent them back and waited a while for the new order to come out. When thy did, they were completely charred!! Service was not that great either. Our waiter made a once in a while appearance and was not detailed oriented. We asked for water with lemon and you guessed it the water arrived without the lemon! Since  there are so many other places in our area to eat, it will be a long time before we attempt to eat there again!! Look at the picture I posted."
Mirra M.,"Redmond, WA",16,48,,1.0,10/18/2015,"I've been to a few Applebee's in my day and they are always mediocre, as you'd expect. However, this one is just gross. My boyfriend and I have given them lots of chances as we live just down the street but never again. The steaks there have.... Arteries or something running through them and I couldn't cut, let alone chew it. I gave it to our dog. Seriously disgusting. Their burgers are small and taste frozen and cheap. I'd rather have a McDonald burger. Their apps also taste frozen and I'll just go to the grocery store and buy them much cheaper. This place has nasty food. Do NOT eat here. The teriyaki place right next door is good. Go there. Or subway. Or the dumpster."
Tiger K.,"Mill Creek, WA",21,75,13,5.0,2/6/2016,Always nice coming here. Rita always greet us well from entry and servers are always great.
Sarah R.,"Seattle, WA",0,27,6,3.0,3/17/2015,"This is really more of a bar, which serves food, than a restaurant with a bar. On the down side, there burgers are disgusting. I've had better at Denny's. They use American cheese and don't include the lettuce, tomato and pickle, unless you request it. The fries were so salty, I had to ask them to throw them out. (Be honest. It's pretty hard to mess up French fries.) On the upside, they have great happy hour specials and lots of tvs to watch the game. Their pub pretzels are also surprisingly tasty.  So, if you are looking for a place to go out with friends for drinks, this is the place. However, if you are on the hunt for delicious food, take my advice, and go elsewhere."
Vickerie W.,"Lynnwood, WA",2,40,32,4.0,6/16/2016,"We always find something the kids love -and we'll eat and so convenient. No it's not el gaucho but it really fits the bill for what it is. But I have to commend the staff. The staff is 5 stars. Every time I come in I think wow they're well trained. I hear someone complain, it's a seamless i'll take that off your bill and apologize profusely, My husband or I have random requests (csn my kid have the broccoli raw not steamed?) absolutely, no problem.  You would think you were at El Gaucho or the Met based on the outstanding customer service. Nice job to whoever manages that."
Trudy S.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",0,3,,4.0,8/24/2016,"A week ago, I took my adult granddaughters to this Applebee's  for lunch. I 've always had good meals and service as we did this time. My reason for writing this review is to bring Applebee's attention to customers that are vegan. One of my granddaughters is vegan and asked our waiter for some help. She asked for a baked potato but was told they only serve them at dinner time. How long would it have taken to nuke a potato for her? After some discussion and thought she was able to have them fix something for her. With more and more people going vegan, it would be helpful to have a place on your menu for those people who eat no meat and also may have allergies to dairy."
Robert W.,"Mill Creek, WA",91,49,12,1.0,9/10/2014,Evening is a disaster. First off who deep fries ribs?  One bite and was greasy.  Management tonight was a complete jerk. Do not patronise me. Keep saying how surprise he was I didn't like the ribs.   He replace my order with the bourbon steak. Order got lost. Again manager kept patronising me saying since they had to remake I had to wait longer.  Nope...will be following up with headquarters
Crystal W.,"Yucca Valley, CA",210,8,1,1.0,12/15/2015,"Wow, waited forever for the car side to go, then they tell me I can only use one gift card. I'm sure the food is going to taste just like the shitty service. I should of picked a different apple bees"
Brad H.,"Kirkland, WA",234,971,114,4.0,5/16/2012,"I wanted to update my review as the locations new general manager reached out to me in regards to an email I sent to the company. John, the manager, provided a sincere interest in learning more about the situation that occurred during my recent visit. John was kind, professional and agreeded that the service was not as it should have been. He offered to make the situation correct for me, which normally when I complain (which is very seldom), I dont accept; however, due to the situation the first time, I accepted. On my return visit, John personally thanked me for taking the time to let him know about the situation. My server this time, Cora, provided truly incredible service. She was personable, friendly, efficent and left a great impression of what five star service should be. Cora always had a smile on her face, built great rapport with other bar guests and had an upbeat ready to provide legendary service attitude. With the great leadership of John and outstanding service at the bar from Cora , I am know happy to return to this location. The food quality was also exceptionally better, the wings had at least three times the amount of sauce and tasted as fresh as possible. The strawberry cheesecake shooter dessert was of wonderful size and flavor, something I highly recommend, Thank you Applebees for taking the time and interest in correcting when something goes wrong and proving that this is a place I would be happy to take friends in the area in the future.  This would be a five star review, expect for the fact, I believe that because the first visit did occur, a star should be noted..."
Thomas N.,"Everett, WA",35,3,,1.0,11/23/2015,My wife and I came and the wait staff took a while to even notice that we were there. I didn't mind but service was pretty bad. Then we ordered the take 2 and both got the oriental ck salad. It was just horrible. The veggies were black and we mostly got the bread crumbs and very little salad. It made up probably around 90 percent of the dish. The sauce we not the regular size dish but the puny one and when we asked for more the waitress was giving us a look like really.
Randy K.,"Oakwood, OK",184,205,346,4.0,5/6/2014,This is our second best location for Applebee's. The service is good and the size is right. It is hit or miss as far as how busy it is.
Joslyn C.,"Bothell, WA",10,5,,2.0,5/17/2015,"Came here last night to have a drink and some shareables with my boyfriend.  We were seated promptly in the bar/lounge at a booth.  After looking over the small selection of drinks, I went with the red rita.  We ordered our drinks and began looking over the menu.  They have a minimal selection of bar foods so we went with the three apps for $12.50.  The bartender told me they were out of the red malibu for my drink so I had to substitute for something else.  They have tablets for your table for ordering and games which was cool.  Our food came out separately but close enough to be eaten together.  It was very salty and seemed comparable to a microwaveable appetizer.  Service was okay.  Definitely better places locally for drinks and apps."
Paul H.,"Mill Creek, WA",19,41,5,2.0,4/2/2015,"The atmosphere is bright and colorful, well I laid out and not to noisy. Good beer selection and the staff was attentive. The food however is terrible when compared to other restaurants in the area. First time visit for me and will be my last simply due to the use of fake cheese on their overpriced nachos. Gross!!"
Rachel H.,"Everett, WA",322,14,23,4.0,12/3/2014,"My fiancé and I live nearby and came here the other night and they had just put in little tablets to each table where you can notify a server, add an appetizer or dessert to your order, and pay for your meal afterwards which I thought was really neat!! I don't think I've ever had an awful experience here. Obviously, it's not the best food I've ever had, but I would be lying if I said that I didn't have late night cravings for Applebee's honey bbq wings......"
Shinwook P.,"Kirkland, WA",82,54,26,3.0,1/2/2014,"Service could've been better. But our server had been working like 12 hours, so I don't blame her haha.  Food is always good! Happy hour makes me happy."
Cham M.,"Smokey Point, WA",26,42,40,4.0,9/2/2013,"OH MY GOSH!!! It's actually the nicest Applebee's that I have ever been to. The ones in the south are old, dingy, dirty, and leaves you with the feeling that chicken wires should be put up for bands and bar fights.  My wife and I got the 2 for $20. Spinach dips, 7oz sirloin, chicken/shrimp plate. The waitress was on top of the drinks, service, and was super friendly. It was super clean and the atmosphere was nice. This store is definitely a mold breaker from other ones."
James M.,"Everett, WA",0,2,,3.0,4/3/2015,"I love coming here on Monday nights.  Five dollar burger night ($5.99 actually) is great, and after 9:00 $3.00 beers! T.V.s are great, service is great, good atmosphere.  The food is pretty good for bar food.  My big issue is always the wi-fi, which is always hit or miss. I've taken this up many times with the owners, please say something if you stop by here!  Otherwise, good experiences"
