Karla N.,"Snohomish, WA",11,23,2,3.0,1/13/2015,"The manager on duty tonight called and apologized for the crappy service, and is making it right."
Sheryl P.,"Snohomish, WA",1,5,,1.0,3/29/2015,Food is horrible! Last time I went was for a drink and that experience was even worse. Cocktail waitress was so rude with a smile on her face! I think her name was Crystal or something similar. Applebee's is so gross we tell our kids that they have RATS so they don't ask to go. It's to bad because we could walk there!
Laura V.,"Everett, WA",0,8,,2.0,1/19/2016,"My sisters and I came in on a Monday to get some dinner. We were quickly served because it was pretty empty. We all ordered burgers and a little later our server said if we needed anything else, ask the other servers because she was ending her shift soon. She was very nice and served us well, even constantly refilling our waters without us having to ask. We were feeling a bit hungry so we called a server using the tablet on the table, and it was flashing red. There were 2 or 3 servers not too far from us talking with each other, and they saw our tablet flashing. They ignored us and started talking to themselves once again. Our original server came back and served us right before she left, and I was extremely thankful for that. Food was mediocre, fries were cold, and burger buns were covered in oil. I would have given them 1 star if it wasn't for our server."
Justin D.,"Everett, WA",16,9,1,4.0,9/13/2014,"Applebee's is a great place to go for their happy hour. Good drink prices, and really great deals on appetizers. Last night my girlfriend and I went to use our coupon for a free appetizer and the waiter made sure the most expensive one was marked as the free one for us. Most places don't do things like that!"
Jill S.,"Lynnwood, WA",0,20,8,1.0,10/2/2014,This place has horrible service! Not the first time either hence my review- my husbands diabetic so we asked for soup to be brought out first thing. After 48 minutes and seeing 2 other tables receive their food I asked if he placed our order and could we please get my husbands soup. They brought Luke warm soup and when I asked if we could return it it was apparent we were annoying our server. Too many things to mention here but long story short: awful experience even worse service and mediocre food. Oh and they forgot our appetizer as well. Save your money and do not dine at this location. Our visit was mid day and had 5 tables if that inside at the time.
Cynthia G.,"Honolulu, HI",1,17,7,1.0,9/5/2014,I'm writing this review as I'm in here because I have the time. Came in here when it wasn't busy and they still took forever to bring me for my drink. Then it started to get PACKED a while after still took forever for my drink. Got so packed that the staff got overwhelmed and look like they don't know what they are doing. I asked the manager or what looked like the person in charge for ketchup and he gave me the ugliest look. I asked for a desert menu and it's taken up to 15 min for my waiter to come and ask me what I would like. Horrible!
Stephanie C.,"Lynnwood, WA",105,250,66,3.0,7/11/2011,"I'm not sure any Applebee's can do better then an a-ok 3 star rating. I come in knowing exactly what to expect, albeit the expectations are getting lower now-a-days. Came in with 3 kiddos and 4 adults for HH.... the waitress had a surreal level of energy at 10pm. We got wings and quesadillas... service was okay, food was okay. It's what's expected. This Applebee's opened up a few years ago; probably one of the newer/newest ones around the area. It's a pretty low key one since it's out of the way for many. Definitely quieter then the Lynnwood one."
Patrick S.,"Bothell, WA",1,49,,4.0,4/11/2014,"This review is for curbside to go. I'll start with the call to order. The lady who answered the phone was very courteous and asked a couple good questions to ensure I got what I wanted such as sauce options and making sure I wanted the full size as opposed to half. I was then told it would be 14 minutes. I was there right around the 14 minute mark and the food was brought out promptly within 2-4 minutes of parking, so excellent timing considering I ordered a full $18 rib and crunchy shrimp dinner. The lady who brought it out greeted me and asked how I was doing and was genuinely friendly. Overall, service was definitely 5 stars.  The food isn't fantastic, but it's good for the price, so it's hard to take away stars based on what this restaurant is striving for (not being a world class restaurant). The fries are good, but aren't super fresh, but again, not expecting truffle fries like some people haha. The shrimp wasn't the most flavorful, but who can expect a $13 order of shrimp to be like the specialty seafood restaurants right off the water? My wife had the ribs, so I'm not sure on those, but she seemed to enjoy them. All in all, the food is decent, the service was great, and the punctuality was right on, so I'd recommend this location. I still recommend Red Robin for overall food over this (for the same class of restaurants), but this was a good experience."
Kristi W.,"Mill Creek, WA",55,45,40,2.0,7/31/2014,Not impressed with this Applebee's. We've always had decent service by the severs but it always seems to take forever to get food once ordered. Couple weeks ago we did take out and it took over 45 minutes to get our order brought out. No one ever told us any updates or what was going on. I kept asking and no answers. When we got home our food was cold. Had to put it in the microwave.  So disappointed. I called and spoke to the manager explained our whole situation and he really kept giving excuses as to just how busy it was and tables were waiting too. BTW I was sitting in the waiting area for 45 min and saw all the tables that got there around the same time I did and they all received there food and finished before I even received my order. I told the manager it was a lame excuse and communication is key! The dining room was not all that full either. I should have just left but I hate doing things like that. Needless to say the only way this particular Applebee's made me somewhat happy was they sent us a voucher for our next meal. Well we used that voucher last night at the Applebee's off of Everett mall way and it was perfect service and great food. We won't be back to this Applebee's however.
Wil M.,"Everett, WA",1,3,,2.0,3/29/2014,That Daniel Stimpson does good under pressure
Bob M.,"Arlington, WA",0,40,1,1.0,12/20/2014,Pretty much the worse Applebees I have eaten at in years. They seemed under staffed. Asked for dressing on side and it was on salad anyway. Brought honey mustard with chicken strips and it was less than 1/8 full. Maybe it was auto filled and it missed the auto...
Jerry G.,"Arlington, WA",2,167,2,1.0,6/19/2010,"Okay, NO stars is the rating they've now reached...... Four of us dining, happy hour is in full swing..... I order the Sizzling Shrimp Fajitas.... I point to them on the menu and speak slowly...... I get some kind of crap shrimp dish and guestion the waitress..... She argues, says I ordered this dish, my wife says bring me a manager..... The manager comes over and supposedly apologizes over and over; says he'll comp our meal since I haven't eaten much.... The bill comes and he charges ALL FOUR MEMBERS OF OUR PARTY FULL PRICE FOR OUR HAPPY HOUR DRINKS AND APPETIZERS! Comps the two regular meals, but holy crap poll-lee.....the bill comes out to be the same amount because of the non-happy hour upgrade.... Stick it in your hindquarters, Applebees, that is the final straw...I hope you crash and burn in my ""Neighborhood""!!!!!!"
Brittany H.,"Snohomish, WA",0,2,,1.0,10/18/2014,I did curb side to go. I was told order will be done in ten min. I pull into the curb side parking spot and sat there for a few min and no one came out so I went in to pick my order up. I stood there a few min before someone noticed me and they didn't look very busy from what I could see. The guy brought me my food and started to walk away. I then told him I haven't payed yet. He acted confused when I said that. I handed him the cash and just walked out. I had ordered Thai shrimp salad. Well I get home and there is hardly any salad there. For paying ten dollars for a salad I expect a nice amount of salad not a small side salad. I will not be back
Chelsie S.,"Glendale, AZ",70,89,19,2.0,12/27/2011,"Applebee's is usually ok... but they don't really have the ""wow"" factor I'm looking for. The last time we ate here, a member in my party got sick after eating the shrimp pasta... Most of the time, I've had a decent experience. The food isn't anything spectacular, but their burgers are pretty decent. The waiters and waitresses are usually friendly and prompt. It's a good place to just eat with friends or hang out, and there's a bar area in the middle of the restaurant if you want to have a drink and talk with friends. Otherwise, I feel it's just your average chain restaurant."
Jo P.,"Seattle, WA",34,17,2,4.0,10/26/2011,"Great for happy hour! Their Nachos is simply delectable! Plus, who doesn't like fake cheese?"
Gina D.,"Arlington, WA",1,17,,1.0,10/7/2010,There goes the neighborhood.  This place is crap.  I'm pretty sure every meal is reheated in a microwave oven.  Won't be going here again....or any other Applebee's.  Sorry.
Jo W.,"Bothell, WA",0,11,,1.0,1/2/2013,Yet another unpleasant experience. Extremely slow service. Soggy burger buns. Food was greasy and gross. We will NOT be back.
Dave O.,"Bothell, WA",0,26,,1.0,2/15/2012,1 to 10 scale. Nachos( where's the beef?)   3 Cheese sticks (dry)  2 Service  1
robie W.,"Bothell, WA",0,3,,2.0,11/16/2011,"Happy Hour !!! Just wanted to inform those that are looking for a great happy hour establishment. Applebee's IS NOT the place if your looking for deals on drinks and getting your moneys worth. It seemed every pitcher we ordered had a 2-3"" head on it. One pitcher we didn't even get three full glasses, the art form of pouring a good beer has been lost at this local ""family"" bar. A typical 48oz. pitcher should get you 3 + 16oz.beers, after ordering several pitchers of beer I was fed up, we complained and they acted as if they were innocent about what we were saying. food was what you would expect. Not getting my biz anymore. Thirsty"
Lala L.,"Everett, WA",140,1,,1.0,8/11/2012,"I would give it 0 star if I could! I had the 2 for $20 for dinner tonight, I order a medium well 9 oz steak with mashpotates and fries, boyfriend had the chicken strip basket., and our appititzer was boneless wings.  After our food was brought out my steak was raw and extra bloody with mashpotatoes and veges when I asked for fries. They said my fries will come out right away, but they didnt come out till another 10 extra minutes. The fries weren't even fresh!!! They were a little bit above warm and bit soggy. I ask to speak to manager name Tasha from one server, she didn't come! so I had to ask another server because I was unhappy with my services and meal. I look across the room and saw the manager chatting it up with her co-workers and whatever she was doing that didn't look so important that she didn't come check on my table for another 10 minutes when I was an unhappy customer and had a complant! WOW such terrieble services.  After 20 minutes of waiting my steak was replaces for a new one that was OVER COOKED! After that I didn't even bother to say anything I was just so tired and feeded up. I waited for my food for over 40 minutes and got nothing out of it. After the manager came back and checked on my new steak, asked how it was and I told her it was over cooked she gave me an additude and said in a very unprofessional, rude way ""I guess we'll just pay for your steak tonight!"" and walked away. I took 3 bites of my food and ask for the check and my bill was around $16 something instead of $20 something they said. 2 for $20 plus a $2 upgrade for the steak . so they should of have taken of half of that cause that was half of my meal but instead they charged us with the $10 chicken strip basket, made us pay for the appetizers that came with our 2 for $20 meal so our check was around $16 something.  I was not happy with the food or services but was still kind enough to leave the server a nice tip because she was nice trying to make sure that I got my steak and that it was cooked the way I asked.  I WILL NEVER EVER COME BACK TO THIS APPLEBEE!  I GIVE IT A -3"
