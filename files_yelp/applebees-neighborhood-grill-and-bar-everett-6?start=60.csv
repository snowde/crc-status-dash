Sara H.,"Bothell, WA",38,7,11,2.0,11/21/2010,"Okay... It's Applebees... My standards aren't terribly high... It's not like I am expecting a quiet meal... But I was seated surrounded by screaming kids... With an almost empty restaurant. 1 birthday party with 2 high chaired babies screaming... A booth behind me with a kid screaming RIGHT in my ear... And a booth in front of me with more quiet kids, who are just staring at me eat. Â Now, I'm a teacher... And I've worked at daycares before... But don't sit me around a bunch of screaming kids... That's got to be like rule number 1 of being a hostess... If it isn't it should be. I give 2 stars because the food was edible, but the waiter was smothering me with ""how's it tasting?"" and honestly it wasn't tasting that good!... I just gave a lousy tip and left asap... I didn't even finish my meal... I couldn't deal with the screaming anymore. I am going to the Bothell-Everett highway from now on."
