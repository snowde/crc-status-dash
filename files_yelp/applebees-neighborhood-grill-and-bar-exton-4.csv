Allyson A.,"Brooklyn, NY",97,52,97,4.0,1/7/2018,"I came here one night for takeout. The service was awesome. It was cold outside and I was dreading getting out of the car, but the takeout waiter came to my car and took my order. He was very nice knowledgeable of menu options, as I was unsure of what  to order. Although it was cold, he was very patient with me and brought my food out to my car when it was ready, as well as took my method of payment at my car. I had the brunch burger with sweet potato fries...I should've taken a pic once I got home, but I guess I was too hungry lol. Overall, wonderful experience. This was my first time ordering takeout here, however, I've been on several occasions with children dining in and the service and food were great."
Matthew L.,"San Diego, CA",101,35,3,5.0,11/27/2017,Very friendly and delicious. I'm from out of town and Trish helped me understand the local beer laws. I'll be back.
Tim O.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,52,22,1.0,1/6/2017,"THE GOOD 1.our server was so nice,she could not do a better job THE BAD 1.lets see,starting off lets talk about the apps,and not the ones on our electronics the cheese sticks were horrible,the outer coating was a cheap nasty tasting introduction to a less than stellar cold cheese center,overall just nasty,the cost -co cheese sticks are way better so you should just get those and call them your own.just saying 2.cheese fries were soggy and disgusting,yuk 3.now the burger,i hate undercooked burgers,and when i took my first bite the outside was crispy,but the inside was raw,not just pink,but raw (GROSS.GROSS,GROSS),if you are unable to cook a burger correctly you need to get a meat thermometer and cook it to the proper temp. I returned and refused to order anything else. 4.i was going to eat some of my wife burger,and again it was undercooked,not as bad as mine ,but still GROSS,when you order something well done,cook the darn thing 5.last my son ordered the big tasty,there was so much overcooked meat in it,that it was inedible,another disgusting item that you could pawn off on your customers,i am sure that it was leftover meat used in this dish summary so we go to a reasturant and order non complicated fair that should be cooked correctly yet failed on all   burgers,and pulled pork sandwhiches are not complicated,if you can't get those right your not long for the cooking world  ,also invest in a meat thermometer,they are like 10 dollars and will save you these kind of reviews"
Deborah C.,"Honey Brook, PA",5,83,42,1.0,12/28/2016,Bad service slow and no one was there for there reason for poor service . Got drinks right away and waited for server for about 15 mins then when asked for a baked potato and it was 5mins b4 the menu says they serve them and I was told no . So I ask for the bill for the soda and how I got that lightning fast
Gary T.,"Exton, PA",0,13,3,5.0,5/28/2016,Unexpected quality dinner Friday night with wife and grandson. Wood fired menu looks good - nice change! I ordered cedar plank salmon (tasty) and the Mrs had half- rack ribs (good). The 4-cheese Mac and cheese was the hit side dish. Perfect margarita topped off a delicious dinner. Sabrina did an A+ job as server! Keep it up Lionville Applebee's - we'll be back!
Nick D.,"Wayne, PA",0,25,,2.0,6/23/2017,"First the food was good, and the place was clean, but the service was slow, we had to ask for napkins and straws. Also it took forever to get our food."
Jason T.,"Chester Springs, PA",67,33,36,4.0,7/21/2015,"Applebees in lionville has an award winning staff. Starting with the GM Manny, the bartender Jen, and the hostess Damis. They always have a smile on their face and are willing to make your dining experience a great one.  Applebee has a new and improved menu with some old favorites. I started with sriracha shrimp that were tasty and good bite from the sriracha sauce. I had to try the 4 cheese mac and cheese, topped with honey bacon chicken tenders. This is the true definition of comfort food. The mac was loaded with cheese with every bite. The tenders had a unique taste with the honey. This pairing works well together.  After all that i still had room. So i ordered dessert which was smores churros. Truly sinful and worth every calorie. Guess i have to run for a week to burn this meal.  Applebee is a great spot to get a great meal at a great price."
Liz T.,"Downingtown, PA",0,10,,1.0,4/22/2017,"I only gave it one star because it wouldn't let me give 0. My burger was disgusting, steak was dry and over cooked. Our waitress was incredibly slow and didn't check on us until we were visibly done by placing our full plates at the edge of the table. She didn't do anything about the uneaten food. The bill was $53, we used a $25 gift card and our debit card... the kiosk in the table asked for tip on the gift card, we thought we would just do it on our debit card. It didn't give us an option so we asked her to fix it. She came back ten minutes later to tell us ""the manager was too busy to fix it and we would have to leave a cash tip"" which we didn't have. I'm baffled by the absolutely SHITTY service although I have to say I should t be surprised about the shitty food it is crapplbees after all."
Tony N.,"Philadelphia, PA",52,67,65,2.0,9/2/2016,"Horrible food. Holy crap! I didn't know you could mess up wings! It tasted like they fries it hours ahead of time, then fried it again when I ordered it! None of our food came out at the correct temp, well the salad did I'll give them that. The server didn't come by to check on us once, until she saw us struggling to pay at the payment kiosk they have on the table (which didn't work at all). Never returning here. Only reason they get two stars is for the pumpkin beer they had on tap."
Katie G.,"Parkesburg, PA",0,8,,5.0,12/13/2014,"Had a great experience last week! It was pouring rain and i had been out shopping with my almost 2 year old. The last thing I wanted to do was stop and get out of the car in the rain again, but my son was hungry so I stopped at the closest place that wasn't fast food. Anyway, I was grumpy and didn t really want to be there. The waitress (can't remember her name) was so nice, as was every employee that came by my table! My son likes to talk to every way and say hi 50 times to the same person, and everyone there took a moment to interact with him :) The food was soooo good. I had a new item the shrimp and brocoli cavatapi. Seriously amazing. So much shrimp that was perfectly cooked. Lots of brocoli florets that were cut up nice and small to blend in well. The portion was small, but since they put in so much shrimp and brocoli, I could look past that. The sauce was delicious. I could eat this every day. For dessert, I had the pretzels with caramel. Also very good and only about $2."
Christopher W.,"Downingtown, PA",9,12,1,1.0,11/17/2015,"I can't figure out why this place has so many stars. I've come to this location a handful of times and each time the experience is just as depressing.  Food is subpar. Getting a steak cooked medium is seemingly impossible. Servers are hanging out, sitting in booths and neglecting the fact that my beer is empty and I need so many more to keep me from just walking out and calling us even.  I don't recommend that anyone come here, even if their prices are on the low side."
Alex R.,"Coatesville, PA",0,1,,1.0,5/10/2017,"If I could give zero stars I probably would. I don't typically complain about service, I've worked in the service industry myself, but last night my boyfriend and I had the worst experience at this Applebee's. When we first arrived we were greeted by a really nice young man he was polite and extremely attentive (it's a shame the experience didn't continue like that) when we sat down our server was initially very sweet our waters came timely however it too roughly 15-20 minutes to get our order from the bar (we each got a draft beer). The food came out and my salad was completely drenched in salad dressing and my boyfriends steak, that he ordered to be a medium temperature, was so well done he could barely finish it. Our server checked in about a half an hour later, only after we asked that same nice gentleman from the start to go and find her. She brought A1 and disappeared yet again. I continued to keep my eye out for any hint of a manager but instead found the majority of the wait staff sitting in a booth in the back of the bar. I got up to use the bathroom and had to walk through the mass of gathering wait staff I could only take one path the other hallway led to the kitchen and none of them would move for me. I had to literally squeeze by. I returned to my table with the dirty dishes still present and empty beers. We waited roughly another 45 minutes before our sever came back to give us our check meanwhile I observed her to be flirting with the other servers and mingling with what appeared to be her friends who were either off duty or not employed by Applebees because they were in street clothing. One of these friends literally followed our server around while she swept sitting in booths chatting with our server who walked passed us 6 times without even glancing over. All the while still did not see a manager in site. This place needs a major face lift when it comes to customer service and maybe should consider hiring staff that doesn't look like they just graduated from the 8th grade."
Taylor K.,"Exton, PA",0,9,4,4.0,2/20/2016,"Delicious food, been there for breakfast and dinner. Wonderful meal and attentive service from our waiter tonight despite the busy Saturday rush. Would definitely recommend their quesadillas; my whole family loved them! Everyone enjoyed the food and got large portions, with lots of left overs for tomorrow, it's good for the price. Great family place, I like the calorie count on the menus, too."
Biff P.,"Downingtown, PA",89,60,3,3.0,8/21/2015,Average food at a good price. Only complaint is that the server spent more time watching sports on TV with his co-workers at the back of the dinning room floor. Never cleared our dishes. I hate sitting with a table filled with dirty dishes and watching other staff members ignore the fact that we are finished and our server is MIA. Team work can make a bad experience better but there wasn't even team work.
Ted M.,"Bedford, TX",46,7,16,4.0,11/11/2014,It's an Applebee's so you already know the menu. A couple of new items worth mentioning. The pretzel sticks are marvelous. They come with the cheese sauce and a honey mustard type of dipping sauce. I really enjoyed the honey mustard sauce. The cowboy burger is my go to burger at Applebee's the onion straws and barbecue sauce make the burger. To top it off you can't go wrong with the chocolate mousse shooter.   Today was Veterans Day so they were very very busy I got there early service little slow but I attribute that to them being busy on this Veterans Day
Pat V.,"Phoenixville, PA",36,3,,5.0,1/3/2016,I think the Lionville location is the best.  Today we were served by Tai.  She was awesome and very attentive to our needs.  We were celebrating my neice birthday and she and her co-workers sang to her and she loved it.  The food was great too.  Served just the way we wanted and piping.  If you are ever at this location ask for Tai to be your server.  You won't be disappointed!
Adam A.,"Downingtown, PA",2,62,,4.0,3/1/2014,Excellent choices after 9pm for half off appetizers and discounted drinks.  Very friendly staff...great for dinner!
Erin C.,"Aston, PA",100,280,209,3.0,3/5/2013,"They're an Applebees.  You don't go for stellar cuisine.  This is as good as one would expect an Applebees to...well, be.  I really like the calorie counts on the new menus and the servers are very nice people."
Christopher F.,"Brookline, MA",0,11,,1.0,6/24/2013,"Fairly certain I got food poisoning after eating the California Shrimp Salad.  I would not recommend eating here based on this experience alone.  I will say that our server was very nice and attentive, as was the hostess."
t w.,"Chester Springs, PA",0,104,,2.0,1/14/2014,"Their kitchen quality control needs improvement! I counted 6 yes 6 little red potatoes on my plate. They were supposed to be ""roasted"" but tasted microwaved yuck no seasoning or flavor at all. The roll sandwich came with was stale so quickly discarded that. I overpaid 10 bucks for a dried out chicken breast and the scant portion of potatoes!  I know A-bees is not gourmet standard but I do expect better presentation and portion for the money."
