Dorothy B.,"San Francisco, CA",40,268,558,4.0,1/6/2018,"My son wanted to go to Applebee's for his birthday after watching a movie. We normally don't eat at Applebee's. Every once and a while we go. I don't know why we don't eat at Applebee's more often. But John made us a believer. We were helped by John who was training another person. My husband and I got one of the 2 for $25 deals. The portions were more than enough. I got the chicken pasta dish with spinach and I think Alfredo sauce (thanks not the official name). My kids got the corn dog and Mac and cheese with chicken. I don't remember what my husband got. My kids and husband finished my off because the portions were more than enough. I really enjoyed there appetizer Caesar salad. The dressing was just enough for flavoring but not overpowering. John was real personable and took care of us. Since it was my sons birthday he got a very delicious birthday ice cream. It had crumbled Oreo cookies, a drizzle of chocolate syrup and whipped cream.  Needless to say, my husband and I finished it off for him. Thanks John for making my son's day special!"
Homa K.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,31,,2.0,12/17/2017,"Alright Applebee's, I'm starting this with a disclaimer that the experience really varies based on location. See my others Applebee's review for the Vacaville experience if interested.  I just wanted to have a nice lunch with a friend one day, but was sadly disappointed. If you're wanting something vegetarian to eat and you don't like mushrooms...good luck! I know I'm a picky eater but I feel the menu had more variety in the past. My friend ordered a pasta with shrimp and I had the French onion soup. The waitress rolled her eyes at us when my friend asked for utensils. I got completely blown off when I asked for some crackers to go with my soup. The waitress said they no longer carry crackers. When I asked about bread instead, she said nope. When I asked if they have any bread at all, she said well the buns for the burgers but you can't have that. So I then asked about the bread they put in the French onion soup, because clearly they have some type of bread in their kitchen but she was clearly not interested in letting me have any. Is there some type of bread shortage??  She was clearly not interested in serving us that day. I know customers can be annoying but we were not being rude or inappropriate. I can't believe the waitress was being so rude. Lunch was nothing special to say the least and I definitely will not be going back to this location."
Patricia S.,"Fairfield, CA",71,50,308,1.0,11/5/2017,"Enjoyed our food.  However, for sanitary reasons, I want a straw that either has a paper tip or is still wrapped in the packaging.  Too many places give you an unpackaged straw.  I will not drink from the glass or use a straw that is unwrapped. Today's visit we had what appeared to be a new server named Erica (recently employed as a server).  I will not criticize that aspect, as experience makes for a better server.  However, I do take exception for rudeness.  When handed the check with payment that included a tip, the least you can say is ""Thank you""."
Lee W.,"Fairfield, CA",0,53,5,1.0,1/10/2018,"Cold food, inattentive waitperson. The place wasn't that busy. I and one other person at our table needed our water glasses re-filled. The waitperson took our glasses, went in the back, refilled them, and brought them back to the table. Am I certain I got my glass ? Or did I get the other person's glass ?"
Sabrina J.,"Fairfield, CA",94,123,652,1.0,9/3/2017,"We had the absolute worse dining experience at Applebee's today!  The service we received from Dominick today was beyond ridiculous. After we sat down and put in our orders, we sat for over 30 minutes while customers who came in AFTER us received their food. My sister ordered her burger well done and once it arrived, it was completely pink inside so she had to wait another 10 minutes for her food. My food came with chips on the side, which Dominick forgot. When I ordered dessert and it came out, there were no spoons. My sisters dessert also came with no spoons so when we ALL requested some, keep in mind there were 4 of us, Dominick only brought 2. One of the spoons however, was REALLY dirty. It had some sort of dry gunk all over it, spinach I believe.  My sister in law went to the bar to get spoons and waited 5 minutes until someone noticed her. When the check came, Dominick forgot to remove one of the orders on the check. They overcharged us for our order. We had to wait over 10 minutes for the new check to come out because the manager was soooooo busy. Sorry, but there was just no excuse for it.  Service was unacceptable from start to finish and all Dominick really had to offer was excuses! Excuses of him being new and how the food on the spoon wasn't his fault, I could go on.  Ultimately we had to ask for the manager because this was just beyond a bad visit and we definitely won't be returning! We arrived at Applebee's before 12:30pm!! It's now after 2:30pm and we are waiting for a manager who doesn't want to deal with unhappy customers, those were Dominick's words! The manager did not want to come out! On top of that, another tables order had their food messed up!"
Meghan R.,"Vacaville, CA",0,10,6,1.0,1/4/2018,"I could write a long drawn out post about how my order wasn't correct, and how the food was. Instead I'll just say this, the chicken in my wrap was still raw."
Sonny J.,"Fairfield, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/10/2018,A rip off restaurant high price on menus poor customer service food is not good Small servings
Kei K.,"Vallejo, CA",6,5,1,1.0,11/17/2017,"Just left this location on a Friday night, 10:40 pm. Our hostess sat us almost immediately. After ten minutes no employee spoke with us. I tried making eye contact with waitresses as they passed. No one offered us water. No one told us they would be serving us or to wait because it was busy (it was not busy.). First time feeling so disrespected at an Applebee's or at any restaurant.  1 star because of being seating quickly and mostly because I don't know how to put 0 stars."
Loren T.,"Fairfield, CA",0,45,11,5.0,12/17/2017,"We always visit this Applebee's because the service is awesome and they have late hours. A good review is long overdue, but Trisha W. is the main reason I am reviewing. Trisha is an amazing server. She catered to our needs, made sure we got the best deal for our buck, and talked about the promotions going on. All the servers we've had are awesome, but Trisha is beyond expectations. We will be sure to come back and request Trisha. She also asked the questions as needed to ensure our food would taste just right."
Kash D.,"New York, NY",15,266,317,4.0,6/3/2017,Ordered their 2 for $20 consisting of 2 entrees and an appetizer.. We got 2 Lime Chicken and Boneless Buffalo Wings with Ranch.. Meal was good but so heavy to even finish it..But $20.00 + tax for 3 meals? Not bad huh...
Wayne L.,"Modesto, CA",24,22,4,1.0,12/10/2017,If I could give this place a worse rating I would. First of all it took forever to get a table in a restaurant that wasn't that busy. The server was Karla who was missing in action for most of the meal. We ordered Sierra Mist which was basically just sparkling water. When we brought it to Karla's attention she gave attitude. The food was terrible. The chicken tenders were so dry. It's like they got left under the heating lamps for way to long. My wife's salad had barely any dressing on it. I also asked for a refill of my soda that I never got. No manager or anyone stopped by. Just overall a terrible experience and I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.
Jennifer S.,"Napa, CA",29,6,,1.0,12/9/2017,"Horrible service!  It took over an hour to get our food and then we still did not even have silverware.  That took another 10 plus minutes to get silverware.  They sent our drinks to another table but said they would at least take the charges for the drinks off our tab- well yes, especially since we NEVER got them.  This was my first time coming to an AppleBees and I will never go back."
Kolby P.,"Grass Valley, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/2/2018,"The particular waitress we had served all of our food cold, served the appetizers the same time as the main dish, and never came to fill our waters or ask us how the meal was going. However, from what I saw anyway, the other waitresses seemed to be doing a good job."
Aj H.,"Vallejo, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/9/2017,"I don't know why I keep coming here before a movie. Every single time my family visits here, it's a problem. Our drinks ALWAYS comes after the food. Food is always cold, service is always horrible."
Lee H.,"Fairfield, CA",0,8,,3.0,9/26/2017,This will be short and sweet. I eat here quite often normally by ordering take out. The food is always good and tasty but it's always pricey! Two entrées and 1 kids meal $50.00.  Today actually sat down to eat and the service was slow got drinks right way which is a plus 5 mins later ordered food which is a plus. Then for 30mins didn't see our waitress which resulted in me looking for my waitress to tell her I will just take the food to go. Then all of a sudden the food was ready and came out.  Wasn't happy. But the food was good.
Eric L.,"Vallejo, CA",0,22,3,3.0,1/22/2017,"We were seated immediately, our waitress was perfect, food was good and all that. But: DON'T USE THE AUTO PAY CONSOLE. MY CARD INFO WAS STOLEN AND USED FOR THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRAUDULENT CHARGES! This was just last night. Those devices are hooked up to wifi that is vulnerable to hacking. Other than my meal costing me $3000.00 dollars, service and food was good!"
Michael O.,"Fairfield, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/22/2017,"Its funny that with as many commercials this place has you would think they could afford to hire hosts a cooks that know how to do their job. 3rd time I've ordered a medium steak and it comes out super well done and harder than the knife I'm using to cut it. Thanks for charging me $18 for crap on a plate, atleast the A1 sauce tasted good."
Alison C.,"Fairfield, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/7/2017,"Horrible. I normally wouldn't name names, but this Dominick guy already has other horrible reviews on him, and here's just one more. Guy can't even take an order. Ordered two appetizers, one drink, two meals. Only received one appetizer and the meals. Couldn't even serve our drinks??? ridiculous.  There was a bug crawling across our table, we killed it.  The last straw, after finally receiving our food after an hour and 10 mins (after two other tables who came in after us had gotten their food and DRINKS-tons of alcoholic bevs, mind you, we couldn't even get our strawberry lemonade lol) a red and white huge spider drops from the ceiling in my face, while i'm eating. I will NEVER return.  I would rather eat in a dumpster than ever go back here."
Shimmy S.,"Vallejo, CA",1,26,2,1.0,10/25/2017,"Let's get started. Waiter doesn't even know the menus arguing with us that we can't do what is already stated on the menu wtf lol. Appetizer came in no plates, appetizer burnt sent back, plates received dirty..... done"
Sheryl H.,"Fairfield, CA",135,199,617,4.0,5/17/2017,This is a hit or a miss at applebee's. I've been here numerous times and i've always had okay service. I do love happy hour which is from 3pm-6pm and 9pm-closing. The only thing that i eat here is the bourbon chicken and shrimp + the wonton tacos. The meal i had today was the bourbon chicken and shrimp which was fresh out the kitchen! I heard it all the way from the kitchen. That was definitely a 10+ star!
Casey G.,"Suisun City, CA",15,14,1,5.0,10/16/2017,"The food was good and came out fast. But our waitress Calani was amazing. She was friendly, funny and on top of her job. We didn't wait for anything and never felt rushed. She had a lot of tables but still didn't forget anything. And she always approached with a smile. Good food and great service was my experience on this visit."
Victor W.,"Suisun City, CA",265,197,209,1.0,3/23/2016,"It is rare that I come here, I repeat rare, maybe every ten years. We were at the mall and the family was hungry. We ventured to Red Robbin but the wait was long. We arrived at Applebee's and there was no wait. The service was slow and the food was basic with no flavor. I asked for a diet coke and got a regular coke, I didn't ask for it to be replaced because I knew it would take longer to get a new one. The refill ended up being diet coke. My wife got a burger, and it didn't come with lettuce or any fixings, after asking for some it took about another 10 minutes to arrive.  At the end of the night we paid by card and I had a funny feeling. The next day we got an email from out card company that someone attempted to make a online purchase with our card but the card company stopped it thinking it was fraud. I am not pointing fingers but I have a feeling someone grabbed our card from here.  I don't plan on returning."
James T.,"Fairfield, CA",57,12,,1.0,1/5/2018,"I've been to this location many of times, it literally is a hit or miss, mostly misses. Being understaffed is one thing, I get it. Wait times aren't usually the issue. The issue is mainly having rude hosts/waiters/waitresses. My last visit I came with friends, we asked for a booth for 5 people. For all sakes and purposes we were fine with the 20-30 minute wait, and asked for something that can fit all 5 of us. Mind you with the long wait, one of our friends went to go snag something quickly from a store. When we got called for us 5. They say ya down in the smallest booth section. When we say we asked for a chair so my friend can have a place as well. The host responded with ""no you can't"" And kind of proceeded to be like ""this is why we asked you for a booth or table. We asked you!"" Very rudely as if it's our fault you can't figure out where to put 5 people. We said booth but there are clearly booths big enough for 5 plus. Already kind of irritated she kind of suggested we can wait til the big party was done then we can be sat. The waitress (who was nice) came over and of course we just explained the situation and she was fine with it but just wanted to check with her manager, who he also said no and came to explain to us why it can't be there and offered to move us to another booth when it became available and at that point, the damage had been done. He tried to stop us by offering free appetizers and I'm kind of tired of this location more focused on trying to stop upset guests then just assuring the experience is good. It's happened quite a lot of times at this location over the years and it sucks to say this but If I go to Applebee's it'll be at the vacaville location."
Kenny W.,"Suisun City, CA",448,118,46,1.0,11/25/2016,This is not the first time we have had to wait long time! We all got our food and finished it and the sere Vera messed up and gave our dish to someone else. It's better to just tell your customer a mistake was made. Do not pass it off as someone else's fault. Work as a team.  Food comes out great here if you don't mind waiting.  Manager stepped in and got our order to us right away so I will keep one star on this review. This place use to be the spot until this year.
Kolby V.,"Fairfield, CA",14,145,18,2.0,9/1/2017,Food looks delicious in the pictures but tastes like a phone.  So much for online ordering.
Elisa V.,"Fairfield, CA",0,2,1,1.0,6/28/2017,Me & my boyfriend used to come here quit often. We usually get the 2 for $20 with Cesar salads. A few months ago the salad was awful. Red lettuce all over my plate & what I did eat it was disgusting. So we haven't been back for awhile. Last night we decided to do on the go from there getting the same thing as usual considering it had been a few months since our last visit. I literally could not eat any part of the salad. It was disgustingly red lettuce everywhere. By the time me & my boyfriend picked out the lettuce there was barely a bit to eat. I just don't understand if you won't eat this type of food why would you serve It? Safe to say we won't be back. Trust me I wish I could upload the picture I took of the salad!!
Gwendolyn C.,"Fairfield, CA",286,84,78,3.0,4/23/2017,"This was the first time I've been to an applebees before and it wasn't too bad. We went here on a saturday afternoon for lunch. When we first arrived, there was no hostess at the front so I was a little confused at what to do but I just assumed they were busy. When the hostess finally did arrive, she was very friendly and we were seated within a reasonable time. I ordered french onion soup and a thai shrimp salad. The french onion soup was pretty good and the salad got better as I continued eating it. I don't really have anything bad to say about this place but nothing super great either. I would say it's a decent place to go to if you're in the area just as long as it's not rush time or anything"
Yella D.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,8,,1.0,11/25/2017,Don't quote 20 min when it's really 35.. and respond with 'I can seat you as fast as the tables are cleaned off'.. can we just tell the truth... I just hope my food isn't microwaved and I get it timely. You pay for the experience I guess ...
Tamala S.,"Fairfield, CA",49,11,22,2.0,5/24/2017,"Normally has good service but Today....  NO!   Waited over five minutes before someone came to seat me.  The server brought ONE plate for two of us to use for our appetizer spate over a napkin!!  Then the server made us pay BEFORE we were finished (We had just gotten our food) because she ""was leaving"" (end of her shift) ....   Then did NOT inform her ""relief"" about us!!!   I am sure because she had us ""cash out"" they probably thought we were ""gone"".     NOT Good Applebee's !!!"
Edwin A.,"Suisun City, CA",145,16,6,1.0,3/14/2017,"It was not a pleasant day at Applebees at the Fairfield Solano mall with my family Waitress was ok service. We order our food and me and my wife order   wife order a caesar salad and it was drenched with caesar   was discussing salad.We told  the waitress and she  said "" now worries about the salad and she offer not to charge us but she charged us   we called the next day to speak to manager and spoke to assitant manager and said that the manager was going to call us but no   doesnot seen they want to take of their customer since we paid already. SUCKIE SUCKIE"
Viclaire S.,"Fairfield, CA",266,342,1916,3.0,6/5/2016,"So this place is your average Applebee's spot. It's not a go to restaurant, but every now and then I end up here. I feel pricing is kind of high, I guess every year restaurants raise their prices. But I prefer to order appetizers as my meal. Accompany it with a beer, watch a game on their tvs, add some good company... it makes up for the average-ness. Service is a hit or miss. I've had wonderful service, other times, not so great. I will say, its conveniently located in the mall and next to the movie theater. Makes it easy to have a meal before or after a movie. Parking can be a pain though since it is next to a movie theater."
patrick s.,"Fairfield, CA",0,189,17,1.0,12/22/2016,"***This Applebee's fucking SUCK!!!*** We came to this place for dinner on Wednesday, 12/21 at 6pm. Stood in the front to be seated. There were three teenagers waiting in the front. One retard came us, pretending to work for your restaurant, asked how many and proceeded to tell us it was going to be a long wait. I got pissed and tell this retard I'm cool because she started laughing when he asked so I knew he wasn't part of your crew.  I stood waiting to be seated/helped for 5 minutes while your employees were walking by. We ended up leaving.  Hey, save yourself some time and great serve by going to BJ's in Vacaville or go to Fuddrickers near chick-file."
Gabbie D.,"Fairfield, CA",111,1,,1.0,8/6/2017,Applebee's was such a disappointment today my sons and I came in at 5:15 the server didn't help us till 550 and we didn't get our food till 630 and all we ordered was an order of fries and two orders of boneless wings such a disappointment
Roy A.,"Fairfield, CA",66,7,3,1.0,4/20/2017,"I took my fiancé for dinner to Applebee's maybe this was a accident or a one day thing but when we received our food on her plate there was a really huge bug , managers came and took care of us ."
Rachelle S.,"Fairfield, CA",1,20,8,1.0,10/11/2017,"Avoid, don't waste your time, money or energy on an establishment who can care less about you. My husband and I came in after work looking to try the 2 for 20, I felt we were judged on our choice of the menu, don't have a deal on your menu, then judge people on getting the special. Now I ordered the burnt, flavorless, overcooked dry bourbon street chicken and tiny shrimp. My husband got the cold whiskey burger that taste like they just poured alcohol over it and didn't cook it off and stale fries. For our appetizer, we received the spinach artichoke dip and all broken chips. The service was beyond ssllooww. Never gave us eating utensils or checked on us. Avoid. Why don't you guys revamp your staff and menu, you should care about your guest and the servers should see every guest as a business deal not as another cheap table getting the special. We are not cheap, make us want to spend that money we have in our pockets, it's there, it's up to you to get it. Just put some care into the establishment."
John R.,"Reno, NV",52,368,31,1.0,8/29/2016,absolutely terrible. took 45 minutes to get food and they weren't even busy. we were seated and it took 10 minutes just to get our drink order. food quality was subpar. said something to a manager but all we received were snarky comments. ordered a steak well done and it came out with a pulse (I swear it moo'ed).  I think I should have listened to the yelp reviews but tend to brush those with few reviews off.
Khamsay V.,"Riverside, CA",0,1,1,1.0,5/10/2017,Not good took a while to be seated got seat no Waiter to take the order totally ignored​ for over 30 minutes ended up walking out 1030pm on 5/10/17 most horrible service ever
Cesar O.,"Fairfield, CA",8,9,1,1.0,10/1/2017,It was a very poor service.  It was no silverware and when i ask for  the waitress brought just forks no knives.
Julie T.,"San Marcos, CA",149,408,760,1.0,12/24/2015,"Can you say ""nightmare"", boys and girls?  My last time into an Applebee's was 10 years ago, after a string of mediocrity and surly service, I vowed to stay away from the chain, but my daughter was given a certificate for a free ice cream sundae from Applebee's for making straight A's last semester, and she was so excited to redeem it. I figured after 10 years, surely they have improved a bit.  Ummmmm, no. We were seated and waited FOREVER for our server to show up. That was the first red flag... We should have just got up and left, but my kid REALLY WANTED TO USE THAT ""MAJOR AWARD"". My daughter ordered the ""Triple bacon burger "", I had the lunch combo of ""Thai shrimp salad and Applebee's honey pepper chicken tenders mac and cheese"". The food came out, such as it was. The Mac and cheese I ordered said on menu ""Honey pepper balances the richness of this dish by giving a sweet and savory flavor to our breaded chicken tenders. They're served atop a mound of our indulgent 4-Cheese Mac & Cheese loaded with Applewood smoked bacon."" What came out was a dish of pasta with some kind of cream sauce spiked with raw bacon ( no I'm not kidding the bacon was cold, rubbery, and quite raw) with a single, tiny, dark brown, deep fried thing, perched atop this gastronomic nightmare. It was the size and shape of a cat poop: no lie-It looked like my cat took a dump on a little dish of noodles. I'm not even going to describe my shrimp salad-in-name-only, as there are no words... The bacon on my poor little 9 year old's burger was also raw, and inedible.  Wow, just wow! Seriously Applebee's, have your minimum wage cooks take a course in basic food prep and proper cooking techniques! Besides making your customers angry, you will also make them sick! Do you have to kill someone before you wake up!?!  Looks like 10 years wasn't nearly long enough. Never again! If I could give negative stars to this hell-hole I would: -10!"
Wanda W.,"Suisun City, CA",67,29,65,2.0,3/12/2017,Came to Applebees after a movie. They had several people waiting for just a hostess to show up. I personally had to inquire of who was the hostess. It took approx. 4 to 5 min for someone to show up.  I advised the hostess that its important for a hostess to oversee thier work station. After the discussion we decided to leave because the 1st impression is vital.  We left and went to Fuddruckers  instead. Very disappointed that they have such poor customer service.
