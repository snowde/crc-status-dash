Kathleen M.,"Rio Vista, CA",28,22,79,3.0,2/11/2016,Soup and salad combo with a chardonnay.   Decent ingredients in the chicken  oriental salad. Chicken tortilla soup is seasoned and spiced lightly and pleasantly.   Good for a light appetite.
Hayley P.,"Fairfield, CA",38,5,4,1.0,1/9/2016,Food is horribly gross and the service is even worse. I don't even know why I came here. Took over 30 for two salads. Never got our second beer and my margarita tasted like water. Never coming back ever.
Charles S.,"Los Angeles, CA",60,65,26,1.0,6/9/2014,"This place sucks. Bad service, hair in my sour cream, and getting the drinks after the apps and entree. Never again! Later Fairfield!  Best part of this place is paying through computer because I didn't have to see the servers again! 0/5 (negative if possible)"
Brittney B.,"Vacaville, CA",100,5,,1.0,7/22/2015,"The service is always poor and always slow. It takes forever to order, and then takes even longer for the drinks to arrive if the server even remembers to pick them up from the bar. I really wish this wasn't the only place open when I get off late from work...."
M D.,"Napa, CA",2,103,18,1.0,4/14/2014,"This is one of those ""Why can't I give negative stars"" situations.  One star is too much for this dump. Let me start by saying that I recognize we're talking about Applebee's here, I'm not opposed to Applebee's at all, I've eaten at the one in my hometown many times.  It's nothing special, but it's OK.  So my reaction to this specific Applebee's isn't a result of me expecting it to be something it's not.  Applebee's is mediocre food in a chain-restaurant setting, I get it. But this particular location is just awful, even by Applebee's notably easy standards. A smallish group of us met here  for lunch about a week ago.  The restaurant is not busy, mind you, but the service was still atrociously slow and inattentive.  My wife ordered a Corona, it took nearly 30 minutes for it to finally arrive at our table.  30 minutes, for a bottle of beer.  The rest of the service was equally slow and inept, they just don't seem to care. But the real star of the show was the virtually inedible food.  There were 3 adults and 3 kids under 12 at our table, and not a single one of us finished our food.  About halfway through our meal (which took forever to come out) we all sort of slowed down eating... looked around the table... and nearly in unison said ""Is it just me or is this not very good?""  In all honesty every dish seemed like it had been cooked earlier in the day, refrigerated and then microwaved for our order.  Which does nothing to explain why it took 45 minutes for our food to come out when the restaurant is essentially empty. Even the kids meals (mini burgers, kids pizza x 2) were nearly inedible.  When a restaurant can't make a kid's cheese pizza that a kid will eat you know something has gone seriously off the rails.   My shadow will never darken the floor of this Applebee's again.  Terrible service, terrible food, why go here?  Hit a McDonalds on the way to the mall, it will be a million times better."
Richard G.,"Vacaville, CA",5,1,49,5.0,5/29/2013,Just came in after the movies got drinks had a great experience in the bar area  They got a Zoisk on the table so u can order ASAP!! Or food and drinks were out quick was great!
Kori M.,"Daytona Beach, FL",79,296,167,5.0,4/3/2014,"We had a great lunch here. The food and service was wonderful and the restaurant was nice and clean.  This review I want to focus on our server. Her name is Sabrina and she deserves a crown or a gold medal or a castle!!  She was of course on the ball with us and took such great care of us.  What impressed me was how she dealt with possibly the most difficult patrons I may have ever witnessed.  There was not one thing these 2 ladies did not complain about and everything that came out to them, they sent back.  Considering how perfect our lunch was, I just have a hard time believing theirs was bad...especially THAT bad.  Sabrina was so patient and gracious every time. She never questioned or seemed annoyed. I was just over the top impressed with her. Before leaving I spoke with the manager and he agreed that she was a super special person and he was lucky to have her on staff!  Bunus: Military discount!!"
Juleah K.,"Fairfield, CA",231,6,6,1.0,5/10/2015,"Horrible service. Order food, got the wrong food. After I touched it they brought it back to the kitchen. And then I received the same plate again. My moms chicken was dry and hard as rock. Dads food was half seasoned. And also when we spoke to the manager she just said sorry and walked away. When I asked for a refill. She filled the same glass I had before and no telling who touched my straw. Not sanitary at all, and not any good service."
Trey F.,"Martinez, CA",43,8,,1.0,5/5/2015,"This Applebee's is a joke, they are terribly understaffed on cinco de mayo, how are you not prepared for that day, and the manager Toni was so rude and mean to myself and my girlfriend, not being accommodating and making us feel like the terrible service was our fault. I will never come here again and I hope this Applebee's smartens up and gets rid of Toni, she might be the most disgusting human being I have ever encountered in the food industry."
Kimberly H.,"Helena, MT",1,69,5,1.0,7/6/2016,Server is great.  Hardly any pasta to choose from so decided on a steak...  they're out of baked potatoes.  How can you have a steak and no baked potato?
D. W.,"Fairfield, CA",0,49,,1.0,2/1/2015,"We went there last evening for dinner. First of all, there was salt sprinkled all over the table which we had to wipe off with a couple of napkins. (We did not notice this until after we sat down). The rice that came with our chicken was cold. Our server was good but we dont believe it was her fault. She still got a 22% tip from us. It is the manager who needs to make sure everything is OK and guests are satisfied dining at the restaurant. We will not be returning to Applebees again."
Jason Z.,"Petaluma, CA",156,305,184,2.0,5/15/2014,It's ok at best. The service is slow and not really tip top. I would expect more but I guess it's the location of the place that matters. my food was just ok...the dressing was terrible. i would not go back again if you paid me. They were playing a day old basketball game? wtf? why would they do that...I asked the bar for water and got a old glass...gross...
Trayona N.,"Vacaville, CA",356,21,88,1.0,1/7/2015,"DO NOT EAT HERE!! The service is horrible, the drinks are watered down and the crowd is ghetto!"
Ian H.,"Eureka, CA",12,4,25,1.0,11/15/2014,"I guarantee if I managed this store knowing nothing about the business, I would be able to do a better job than this."
Sophia M.,"Fairfield, CA",1,8,,2.0,7/22/2014,"Applebee's will always be... Applebee's. I ventured out one night with a friend and ended up here. He ordered something with mashed potatoes... it looked and felt like a softball. It dropped back onto the plate without a bounce, though. I always order the same thing... Chicken fajita wrap with fried chicken & extra Mexi-Ranch... cant really go wrong with tortilla, lettuce and fried chicken.  On Mondays they do a 'Guy's Night', $6 pitcher of crappy beer and $6 burgers. Keep in mind their pitcher only holds two and a half (if that) pints.  The bartender wasnt attentive and also decided to charge more onto my credit card and give herself a tip when I clearly wrote 'cash' on the receipt.  Cheers to the manager for handling the situation afterwards. Not sure what has happened since, not willing to find out. I'll be avoiding this place at all costs."
Gino P.,"Rocklin, CA",63,94,61,1.0,3/15/2015,"Applebee's , you have proven to me once again why so many of your restraunts are closing. For a chain restraunt I would think the kitchen staff , mangement and servers would have a clue  ! We are seated and about 10 minutes later waitress comes over , acts like we are bothering her to order food . Halfway through it 30 minute wait she says Manuel will be taking over for our table , no introduction or anything . Our food finally comes in waves , and the forgot the steak. Ok, let me ask for the steak now, guy acts he's too cool for school . Finally another 10 minutes her steak comes . Let's talk about each dish now , the cheese sticks ok for my daughter , she's 7, my potstickers were so small , over cooked and lacked any meat in them. Steak over done tasted like the bottom of a shoe , in a bed of fried onions, Riblets nasty. Then waiter,  managers and busboys walk by 10 times and don't clean the table. He puts down the check without clearing the table,  or asking if we want desert , wow now  I'm getting pissed. Table completely covered in plates and he puts down the desert on top of our dinner plates , really ?? Ask him To clean the table he gives me attitude , yet expects a tip still. Hmmmmm I say out loud how the service sucks looking directly at the manager , what's he do ?? Nothing , he acknowledge my statement with head nod , yet didn't even come to the table to see what happened , train your ghetto staff, sleeve tattooes are cool if you like convicts , hepatitis and want your customer to worry if his credit card number is getting jacked , Applebee's , you lost another customer ! Get your act together !! Let's see if they are worried about customer service or their brand. Please feel free to contact me!"
David B.,"Sacramento, CA",89,13,41,1.0,2/14/2016,"Decided to come eat here since I was catching a movie right next door, and I have to say this place has the worst service ever! Got sat at about 8:30pm didn't even see or get greeted by out server until 9 and it wasn't until 9:15 we saw someone again,  while waiting all this time,  we didn't even get water! 45mins is not acceptable to be waiting just for water, as a former server,  I would know. Then finally a manager came and saw that we didn't even have waters. When we explained that we waited for 30 mins to even see a server and another 15 for nothing, he just asked what our drinks were and was off,  when he did try to bring our drinks, I finally just told him to cancel the whole order because waiting 45 mins for nothing was unacceptable, he just said so cancel this whole order with an attitude and walked away!! I'm glad I cancelled my order, they didn't serve a dime from me with service like that. This place deserves no stars at all!!"
Gary E.,"Fairfield, CA",2735,385,1414,2.0,3/8/2011,"We've been to this Applebee's a number of times before and from my experience it was always crowded. I guess that's good for business, however, I felt that service levels were sacrificed to a certain degree due to volume. Though it seemed a bit rushed on the prep., the food was decent. Overall, it's not bad. Nice menu selection and cheap combo's were good tummy stuffers. The drink selections offered were right on. Hopefully in the near future I can hang a few more stars on a review. This location is conveniently located in Westfield Mall and footsteps away from Edward's Cinemas movie theatre. I really admired the cool and historical USAF décor that lined the walls..."
Lance D.,"Rio Vista, CA",8,10,,1.0,11/1/2015,"Service is getting worse by the month, anything with alcohol takes 15"", ask for ranch and it'll take another 10.  Beer comes with 3/4 - 1"" missing and late.  You have to ask for anything, they send out another person with orders who does not give a cr@p if you need anything else.  Been coming here for 10 years!"
Bruce W.,"Fairfield, CA",10,144,1,1.0,2/5/2013,"Consistently terrible.  Quite possibly the shittiest place for ""food"" on the entire planet. If you go here after seeing this review, consider yourself a) warned and b) retarded."
