Sachi M.,"Yokohama, Japan",32,447,1007,3.0,8/9/2011,"My husband decided he's going to have steak every time we go to the US. It's cheaper than what we get in Canada, especially at a place like Applebee's. I try something different every time, but the creamy pasta is too heavy or the appetizer is too greasy or something like that. Not my first choice, but reliably average for when we don't know the area. They had 2 brownies and vanilla ice cream scoop for $1! That's a good deal, but one hint that you shouldn't come here too often. Free Wi-Fi!"
Jen J.,"Birds Landing, CA",3,11,7,4.0,6/7/2015,"We were becoming disenchanted with Applebee's in general, however; today's visit revived our enchantment. :). We had the sampler platter and everything we had was fresh and very flavorful.   And the service was outstanding.   Will be back."
Briana C.,"Fairfield, CA",81,113,33,1.0,10/2/2014,"I always come for the happy hour. Select appetizers are half off. I've been here more than once and haven't terrible service yet. Until yesterday our waitress took about 15-20 just to get us our drinks. But she was constantly helping the all guys table next to us. We finally get our food and she forgot the dipping sauce that came with it. She only stopped by our table every 20 minutes so I used the little table side machine to call her. In about 10 minutes, she rushed to the guys table and said ""did you guys call me?"" Once they said no, then she paid us some attention. I couldn't let this one slide. We were so irritated with her service, we left cash on the table since she wasn't responding to our ""ask for a server"" signal to get the check. The place looked moderately busy, but the waiters in the past were able to help us promptly. Don't really feel like coming back here anymore."
Michelle B.,"Fairfield, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/26/2016,Came into this applebees at around 10PM so it was moderately slow . Stood by the door to get assistance and no one came to help for about 10 minutes. Made the decision to leave right before someone finally came to help us . While walking in to the be seated saw 4 employees standing in the corner conversing with each other rather than taking care of the costumer. After been seated had to wait an additional 10 minutes someone to place our drink orders. Food came and it was great even though our chicken quesadilla was missing chicken . There was however one employee who I actually saw working. :Marline  . Her costumer service was great her sense of urgency was great and she did regular table touches with the costumers Great job to her.
Douglas Y.,"Sacramento, CA",569,893,2281,1.0,11/1/2012,Although I like Applebee's I will not eat at this location. Every time I have been here the place is just dirty.  The tables smell like they were wiped with dirty rank rags.
Kaylani L.,"Chesapeake, VA",1,48,20,1.0,9/19/2014,Worst service for such a large chain!! We sat here for like half an hour before we were even asked what we wanted to drink...by the time they finally came to our table we were ready to order. We put in our order and our drinks and food came in a timely manner. BUT IT TOOK WAY TOO LONG for someone to initially come to our table.
Mr. Andro P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",59,34,6,1.0,8/5/2015,"One star for great service, otherwise I would rated 0 if I could. 5.50 for glass af blue moon and 15 for smoked salmon.  Food was cooked so bad with some old spinnage on top and worst than that was the dirty dish they put this food on. Discussing."
Phil H.,"San Jose, CA",434,360,1014,1.0,9/22/2014,"I have eating here three times, twice I have gotten a stomach virus, I cannot blame the food, maybe it is the facilities, maybe they are cooking everything on 1 grill because everything I had, tasted the same. I had fish, it was not properly cooked or it was not properly refrigerated, first trip I had a salad and pasta, the pasta was cold as well and both times I suffered a bad stomach virus which halted my weekend and rest of my activities to a nearby restroom for a few days and incapable of working. Thus I have no one else to blame except the food. The service was GREAT and fast, the liquor, unless it's on the menu, the bartender was terrible. The utensils were not washed, and I had to ice water clean them myself. Maybe hire more mature people in the kitchen or cleaning facility, or maybe it's time for an inspection, being a chain restaurant, they should know better. I rarely give a 1 star, but they only deserved 1 because of the fast service, nice host, and quick delivery of food. Otherwise I felt the place is contaminated and the food is full or viruses. They need to clean or sanitize the place, clean the floors, clean the walls, dust the place down, and surely clean the utensils before servicing people. The maturity shows in the staff, by not taking care of the place, not just serving food. Clean it up, sanitize, be careful and check your stuff before you eat here, I hate to say this, but I doubt I will ever come here. 3 times, 2 times sick,  it's not coincidence, please be careful. I will be writing to the company, just to save themselves major lawsuits."
Ariel L.,"Vacaville, CA",1,4,,1.0,3/1/2015,"Watered down drinks, and the food looked repulsive. Way over priced for such a shitty place."
Joanne D.,"Fairfield, CA",0,8,,2.0,7/16/2015,"Majority of the time I get just mediocre service. I think once I got a younger guy who was pretty tall who was amazing (5 stars to you, sir!) With the exception of that server, the service is slow. I myself have been a server so I completely understand how the restaurant business works. Letting a table sit for 10 minutes just to be greeted is not acceptable. Always takes forever to be sat, and when I sit at the table right next to the host stand, I don't want to hear them talking about their personal lives. I get it gets boring up there, but for the sake of my ears please keep the conversation clean."
Sunny T.,"Antioch, CA",65,43,8,5.0,7/25/2014,I am not giving 5 stars for the food that's for sure Applebee's is usually kinda crappy food wise... I am giving 5 stars for our service our server Caitlyn P was amazing that poor girl had to deal with a difficult table they were sitting right across from us they were very rude towards this young lady and no server deserves abuse from a crummy ill behaved person she was very professional smiling being polite as this table berated her to anyone who would listen... Poor girl but bravo for handling that so well.
Jose C.,"Cloverdale, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/1/2014,"Horrible!!!!!!!! Service was terrible! Waited 1 and 20min for food, never had a a real waitress. This digital ordering made for no customer service and lack of attention to customers.  Worst Applebee's!!"
Laura B.,"Fairfield, CA",41,17,1,1.0,5/7/2014,Apple bee's omg bad place very unprofessional bad service dirty place and to top it off hairs on food who knows what else  I been going several time to this place I always given another chance before I take my business somewhere else. I have gone for dinner lunch and just because all those time there's always something. A few days a go I whet with my sister for lunch we wanted something small we decide to go for the lunch special our waiter was an a** H*** he changed his mood just because we order form the lunch menu we was rude and I could hear him talking stuff about us with another waitresse.he never even bother to go check on us AT ALL . A few weeks before that we went to eat dinner and same thing they where very unprofessional rude and careless to top it off they took almost 45min to bring our orders and to put the cherry on the top my plate had a few hairs I order the pasta so it was very noticeble.i told the manager she took my plate and broufh it back in 3minutes what that tells you that they just took the hairs out right ibdidnt ate my plate left it there and paid and left IM NOT THAT TYPE OF PERSON THAT GIVES ATTITUDE TO HARDWORKING PEOPLE OR IM NOT A DEMANDING PERSON WHY ARE THEY SO RUDE  IM NOT EVER GOING THERE EVER AGAIN
Erika E.,"Suisun City, CA",21,9,3,1.0,11/12/2014,"The only good thing about Applebee's in Fairfield are Maria and Erika, always have a good time with them at the bar, otherwise every other time I'm there service is just embarrassing. I'm a server, and I'm also young and I know the servers probably fight over who has to take our table which just means when our server finally comes 10 minutes later I already want to leave them a crappy tip . The food isn't that bad for being mostly microwaved honestly just seem like they hate their jobs!"
B. ..,"Los Angeles, CA",0,33,2,1.0,11/21/2014,"My first experience was good but ever since then the visits got worse and worse. My last visit, me and my boyfriend go on a Saturday evening it wasn't that busy. We both ordered burgers 'no pink' I got the classic cheese burger and he ordered the new American burger. We did not get what we ordered, I got a cheese burger with the toppings that were suppose to be on my boyfriend's burger, and his burger didn't look close at all to what was on the menu, it was a patty, a bun and some yellow sauce. We tell the waitress how bad our meal was screwed up and after arguing with her we agreed on taking the burger my boyfriend had back and ordered another cheese burger. My boyfriend goes to eat his burger and it wasn't cooked completely, we're ready to leave at this point, the waitress ask if we want dessert...NO, just the check, then the manager comes out and apologized for our horrible experience and offers us dessert that we just said we didn't want. That was officially my last visit, to bad a lousy place like that is taking up the perfect space in the mall."
Saucye W.,"El Cerrito, CA",46,11,9,4.0,2/1/2014,The night started off bad. It took us 30 minutes to get water! But as soon as we asked for the manager she quickly came to our aid. Michelle Reece is an awesome manager she's an awesome addition to this Applebee's. I will be returning to get the  excellent customer service that she gave us on my last visit.
Ash M.,"American Canyon, CA",60,29,11,1.0,2/6/2015,I get it's an Applebee's but DANG.  WORST dining experience ever!  Waited over 30 min for our food and they forgot my order.  The waitress didn't want to say it was forgotten and kind of lied to us.  It was weird!  The meat was requested to be medium rare and it was so well done it looked grayish.  EW  I'd rather eat at Taco Bell than this crappy joint.
Karen F.,"Elk Grove, CA",83,37,67,4.0,3/23/2014,Chicken and Shrimp Tango with rice pilaf! Yummmy. Inexpensive dinner and very tasty!  Loved the avocado drizzled topping!
CHAD C.,"Los Angeles, CA",81,83,114,1.0,5/3/2014,The service here is horrible! And why is all the food so salty?! Spinach dip - what a joke?
Aban E.,"San Francisco, CA",1,64,,1.0,8/3/2014,"Normally, I wouldn't rate Applebee's but since my experience at this particular one was so bad that I feel the need to leave a review.  Our server was sweet but got so many things wrong.  We'd ask her to fix them and she put on a smile and was very nice about it but nothing got fixed.  She forgot, again.  I mean really?  And got charged for things we didn't receive... When I asked her to cancel the order since everyone else is done eating, she looked shocked!  Come on..."
