Janice S.,"Vacaville, CA",7,2,,1.0,12/8/2013,"I was not pleased with service and meal at this location. I found hair in my 11 month old's meal. I was upset...in tears cause my daughter had already eaten her meal when I found it and asked to talk to the manager. The manager told me she was sorry I was having a bad day and apologized for the service, but the damage was done and hardly the response I was expecting."
Roberto M.,"San Francisco, CA",44,2,,5.0,7/15/2014,Love this place been comming here for a while now great place to have some drinks if your sitting at the bar make sure Maria is the bartender BEST Bartender I have seen if I can give her 10 stars I would!!!!!!!
Brandon A.,"Plainfield, IL",18,328,21,3.0,3/19/2014,A great place to stop for a bite to eat while at the mall.  Sit by the window and there is some great people watching.  The service was good as well.  The food is on par with any other Applebees.
Jessica A.,"Daly City, CA",398,40,4,4.0,9/11/2013,"We decided to have my dads birthday celebration here. The waiter, Jason was awesome- really friendly, accommodating, and great to my family. He gets a star all to himself. As for the food, applebees is always whatever. It's a big selection, and its yummy. But always could he better in quality. My family of 4 got two 2 for $20 meals. Each one comes with one appetizer (or two salads) and 2 main dishes. I got the honey steak and potatoes. The steak was great, but the onions/jalapenos/potatoes surrounding it were so...meh. the honey sauce was so good...but it was only drizzled so I seriously rubbed down my plate with steak trying to get every bit of it. The dish itself looked nothing like the picture by the way..buy still my medium-rare 7oz steak was delicious and tender. The artichoke spinach dip was okay. As well as the ceasar salads.  For dessert we got the molten lava cake- YUMMY. And my dad got a free little sundae and Jason offered for their staff to sing happy birthday but I didn't want to do that to the employees haha."
Danvin R.,"San Jose, CA",241,280,19,2.0,7/13/2009,"It was a disappointing day when we came down from Tahoe. Looking forward to trying Chick-fil-A, we were abruptly reminded that they were closed on Sundays. Applebee's to the rescue! Right? Well... no not really. I've gotta give them one thing, no matter which Applebee's you go to, they ALL look and feel the same. Same mediocre food paired with the cheesy local memorabilia that they found from local garage sales some where. I had the all you can eat ribs here. I wanted to get my money's worth, yo! Regardless, the ribs that were served were tiny and came out two ribs at a time. Come on... you're gonna make me keep asking for more? Thanks for all the ribs Applebees, you reminded me why I don't come here very often."
Krystal F.,"South San Francisco, CA",49,47,2,4.0,7/13/2011,"I've been going to this neighborhood Applebee's since I moved to the area. Some good some not so good service but for the most part I can say I am very satisfied with this place.  Happy Hour is the best, love the late night happy hour since its nice just sit back and relax after a long day. I've gone there a few times for a girls night out and the service is always good, it can get a little busy during this time which takes the staff a little longer to get drinks and food out but nothing too crazy.  The staff is very friendly and service is fast.  Food and drinks are reasonable, so its an inexpensive night out.  Definitely would recommend this place and will continue to go there!"
Kristina H.,"Fairfield, CA",0,3,,2.0,3/15/2015,"I'm going to start off with saying I'm never going to eat there again. We first got sat right next to the entrance and it seemed like it took ten mins before we were spoken to and even longer when we asked to be moved because of the high table. Our waitress was Caitlin P. and she seemed okay, only checked on us twice and seemed to gossip a lot with her coworkers but that was fine. Food came and my pasta was good, my brother and boyfriend said their chicken strips and burger tastes like it wasn't very good so we pay our bill, I ask for a to go box for my food and leave. I wasn't even to the parking lot when I realize I forgot my box on the table and when I came in to get HALF MY FOOD I PAID FOR, Caitlin tells me ""Oh I'm sorry we threw it away."" I ask really? You guys don't hold onto it for a few minutes? ""Yeah we don't, I thought it was weird you asked for a box and you left it, I thought you didn't want it so I threw it away. Sorry again."" And I just looked at her surprised and she just looked at me with a insincere smile. Upset I just said it's fine and walked out. Previously working in a restaurant myself, when people left HALF THEIR FOOD THEY PAID FOR on the table I hold it in the back for 15 minutes or so in case they return because WHY WOULD I ASK FOR A BOX IF I DIDNT WANT MY FOOD?? And if we did throw out someone's left overs we would make them fresh food Togo but I JUST GOT A ""OH IM SORRY.."" and a mental push out the door. If I could ask for my more then 15% tip back I would but loosing my service forever at Applebee's is good enough for me. So my tip to people who go there IF YOU FORGET YOUR LEFT OVERS ON THE TABLE DONT EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME WALKING BACK BECAUSE THEY DONT CARE ABOUT THE MONEY YOU SPENT ON YOUR DINNER. I hope management sees this. The date was 03/14/15 and paid my bill at 9:11PM."
Juan A.,"Lansing, MI",64,298,134,4.0,1/10/2012,I have to say that I am a fan of applebee's and I haven't left any of their establishments disappointed. Their food is very good for the most part and the drinks are very decent as well. The 20 dollars is a good deal if you want to stay in a budget and the options are very tasty. I come to this particular one whenever I want to eat something before or after going to the movies and don't feel like driving somewhere else and have always experienced very good service from the hosts as well as from the waitress and waiters.
Theresia D.,"Oakland, CA",291,369,264,5.0,1/23/2009,"Manager's Inviting you to enjoy dinner and drinks, WoW! Seriously, my girlfriend and I walked in and they insisted we sit and have some food and drinks, lol! I guess it did help that we went to high school together, LoL! The host did seat us at a well lit table as I requested (Host-mike) and our server Lindsey was really sweet and nice. She made sure that we had everything we needed and that it tasted good. Of course the Manager Aaron came and made sure we received everything we needed and said to let him know if we needed anything. (that is the high school friend) Let me not forget to mention that even the General Manager Cheryl came to check on our table.  These people really make sure that you have everything you want and need!  I will go back soon, LoL! Especially for the new Quesidilla Burger, to die for! No jokes either, really good!!!"
Ardella O.,"San Leandro, CA",69,203,124,2.0,11/19/2011,"Service and food are subpar. However, I do make my occasional visits to the restaurant just to order their blue ribbon brownie, to-go of course."
R J.,"Oakland, CA",4,193,86,1.0,6/6/2013,"This place is the worst place to eat in Solanocounty. The service is abysmal, I literally have to beg to get refills on my drink and the food me and the wife ordered were cold."
Andrea P.,"San Francisco, CA",203,7,,3.0,5/1/2012,The food is really good!! They made my steak perfect for a well done!!! Still was very juicy.  The negaitive...... When it came time to pay the bill. We split the bill between 2 cards. My card was charged twice.... I basically paid the bill.... Our waitress was very ditzi... It took a minute to get our drinks and she kept disappearing.....
Edna V.,"Suisun City, CA",42,5,,1.0,5/26/2011,"I've been to this Applebee's several times before in the past, and service had never been stellar, just OK, but my experience this time was simply horrible. We had a party of about 10 people and it took 15 minutes from when we sat down until the server came over just to take out drink orders, most of my party didn't really mind because in that time, Happy Hour had started and drinks were cheaper... but after we placed our orders.  It took over 45 minutes to get our food out. While this was going on, our original server was ""phased"" and a new server took over the table, but things really didn't improve.  While most of my party was eating their entrees I was still waiting for mine, and it was just a pasta dish.  30mins on top of the original 45min, I FINALLY gor my pasta. After dropping the food, the server never came back to see how our food was or if we needed drink refills... and the manager never came by the table either. It took another hour just to flag down someone to flag down a manager to inform him that were were waiting for our checks.  Our server came up just as we were speaking with the manager with outr checks that she thankfully separated so we didn't have to tell her.  But it took another 20 mins for SOMEONE to come up and gather our bills to close our checks.   Ther server finally came up with our closed checks and mumbled some excuse about not anticipating that the restaurant would have employees walk out on the job...  Which really wasn't helpful. We arrived at the restaurant at 8:45pm and didn't leave until almost midnight..."
Marilyn B.,"Fairfield, CA",218,36,3,1.0,8/17/2011,Haven't found an Applebee's yet that had decent food and service. I am no longer going to try. my recommendation: Pass and  go somewhere else.
Duke H.,"Suisun City, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/30/2010,Dined at this location for 5 years but lately the service has begun to go down hill. 3 months ago (Sunday 6pm not busy) we waited 45 minutes to get our meal. Our meals arrived cold. We spoke to the waitress about this issue and she sent a manager to us. The manager was rude and very unsympathetic to our needs and went as far to nick pick to the fact we disturbed our food because we took a couple of bites! At first she served us another steak without giving us a fresh plate. This is about the time I got my blood pressure boiling and spoke to that manager's  manager. Her manager was professional and acknowledged her fault & compensated us and had her apologize to us. Today we sat down for dinner and our waiter asked me if I wanted mushrooms on my sirloin. I told him not if it is extra. Then I asked is there a charge for the mushrooms? He responded no. Of course  when the bill got to me I was charged for it. When I asked him why I was charged he told me he said there was an extra charge. Not once did he offer to rectify the charge.  Instead he tried covering his mistakes with lies that he told me there was a charge. This made me very upset to say the least.  I decided to let it go because of the way I was feeling at that moment. To top it off the rude manager from 3 months stops by our table to ask how everything is going in an unpleasant tone like she's doing us a favor for asking how we are doing (good thing she's not a MD.)  Well this is the last straw for me. I decided that this particular location of Applebee's is a location I will stay away from. I have eaten at other Applebee's location but not once have I EVER rec'd this type of treatment.   Good luck to everybody.
John A.,"Benicia, CA",0,12,,1.0,11/22/2010,"On November 20, 2010, I decided to stop by this restaurant and have a quick meal before heading off to the movies nearby. I ordered the Sizzling Skillet Fajitas with chicken and the meal arrived, rather quickly and was delivered by the restaurant manager. I don't want to appear overly sensitive, but the manager had a peculiar look on his face.  As the meal was dropped off, I noticed that the sizzling platter was not sizzling whatsoever - in fact - it was ice cold. The entire platter was ice cold - from the rice, to the chicken, to the peppers, etc. But I didn't complain - because I just wanted to eat and go see a movie - but then the worse part of my experience reared it's ugly head.  The rice had an after taste, that was very, very gritty. When I looked closely - the rice looked as if it was a leftover from days before. There was corn in the rice, and it was shriveled and dry, and the rice itself was stale and dark in areas that it shouldn't be. I don't know why the rice was the way that it was, but if I were to assume anything - it looked like it had been scooped up from the floor. The chicken also had a strange after taste. After a few bites, I put the meal aside, and I felt an allergic reaction coming on, and I just left the meal. I was completely disgusted. I'm just a regular Joe - and I have nothing against Applebee's - but I think something was strange about this whole experience. I'm going to file a formal complaint to the county and hopefully have this place inspected. The service was fine, but the food was something to be less than desired."
Alohalani R.,"Fairfield, CA",0,7,2,1.0,5/24/2014,"If I could give no stars or negative stars I would. We spend an average of $50-$60 a week at this Applebee's, the service is horrible & the managers are horrible! We kept giving them chances, but they never improve. Slow service! I'm talking like waiting an average of 20 mins just to see your server! Another 20 mins to get your drinks! And another 20 before you get your food! You're waiting an hour before you get to start eating, and you are lucky if you get drink refills timely. Last night was the last straw! We went in to eat & when we got there the manager came up with a waitress & said ""2 weeks ago you came in & did not pay your bill."" I looked at my husband, because we always pay our bill & have the receipts emailed to us, she looks and goes ""Not him. You were here with friends having drinks and ran off"" I'm pregnant, so I'm not out drinking & the only person I ever go out to eat with is my husband! Not to mention 2 weeks ago we weren't even in town, we were out of town for the entire weekend. She didn't ask, she came up accusing, and when I told her I was pregnant etc, and she said my ""supposed"" name, and I showed her my ID to prove it wasn't me she goes ""Oh well you know how people look alike. We just had the security guards looking for them & they looked like you."" We were so appalled that a manager would come up in such a rude way when they were not 100% sure it was me. I even had other waitresses/waiters that know us because we always come in, and said we only ever come in together, and always pay our bill! We were so angry that she felt appropriate to come up accusing with no proof that we left! We will never return there, and will make sure that we tell all our friends/coworkers/Travis AFB in general not to give this Applebee's your business! We will definitely use Vacaville from now on."
Nicole M.,"Petaluma, CA",81,19,3,1.0,11/19/2012,"Hands down, WORST service ever... I am a server myself so I am very understanding and patient with other servers when I go out to eat, BUT WOW.... We sat at a table in the bar area and were greeted by a very friendly young man who cracked jokes about the new ziosk (electronic waiter) with us, so we thought we lucked out with a good server... Unfortunately what he had in personality lacked poorly in service. I ordered a house margarita with no salt and asked for it in a pint glass. He brings me a martini glass with salt and an olive? I ordered a margarita dude, not a martini. Ok, fine... no big deal, just bring me a glass with no salt, ice and a straw. Warm glass brought, no ice, no straw. Umm, can you put some ice in this and bring me a straw? Glass with ice brought, no straw... I got up and got it myself. (We havent even ordered food yet). My bf orders a Cowboy Burger and is very clear that he does not want onions..... brought COVERED in onions. Rather than risk something else going wrong, he chooses to pick them off and asks for an iced tea. No iced tea ever brought to the table. We get a new server that informs us that she is taking over for the other guy. He takes this opportunity to ask again for an iced tea and I order another margarita with no salt. Margarita WITH salt brought to the table and no iced tea. WTF? I said nothing because at this point we were just irritated and wanted to see how long or if his iced tea would ever make an appearance. No such luck.  I made a point to ask our new server how much she has to pay out in tipshare at the end of her shift because I felt strongly that a tip was not deserved especially because the restaurant WAS NOT busy at all, how hard is your job?? She told me...10%!!! She blatantly lied to my face about how much she has to pay in tipshare because she thought I would leave a bigger tip. Well. I confirmed with the bartender that servers DO NOT pay 10%, They pay 2%. So, I asked for the manager. I wanted to explain to her how bad my service was and why I was only leaving 2% of the bill to cover tipshare so she didnt have to pay out of pocket for my crappy experience. The manager says ""Its ok, you don't have to tip her"". That was it!!! Lady, We shouldnt have had to even PAY... thank you for informing me that a tip wasn't required. Bottom line- I will never return to this Applebees again and will definately steer anyone I know in the direction of another establishment. No wonder they have electronic waiters on the table... Service is beyond horrific!"
Denise I.,"San Francisco, CA",23,40,19,1.0,4/13/2010,"Applebee's is officially on my ""Never Again"" list. Past Applebees experiences at other locations were never knock-your-socks-off awesome, but they were decent enough, just like how you expect these mediocre dine-in chain restaurants to be. But this particular Applebee's was terrible.  It was awful enough to ward us off this chain forever. Bad service:  had to ask multiple times for eating utensils, she dropped a drink from her tray down on the table, couldn't remember our order.  No one came by asking if everything was okay. Slow service:  We waited 40 minutes for our food.  We waited for soup that probably was ready and waiting in a soup pot in the kitchen, for a sandwich, for a salad, and for grilled cheese.  The restaurant was not crowded, it didn't look under staffed.  And it's not like this is gourmet. Bad food:  the soup wasn't very hot.  the grilled cheese wasn't hot.  The sandwich ingredients weren't fresh or cold. Dirty:  There was a leftover dirty plate with half eaten food from a previous diner sitting on a shelf by the entrance when we came in.  When we left (way later that we had planned) the plate was still there.   Apparently we weren't the only ones miffed because a customer walked out of the restaurant complaining that they waited over an hour and never got served."
Anne V.,"Suisun City, CA",0,10,,2.0,8/14/2013,"This place is hit or miss for me... The last few times have really put a damper on this place for me. Food: Hit or miss. The last time I went my steak was burned, salty and rubbery; yet somehow part of the steak still had pink in it! Blew my mind! It was awful. It was supposed to come with garlic mashed potatoes. They were NOT garlic mashed potatoes. They didn't have any seasoning at all, and the vegetables? Were they supposed to be cooked? Because mine were raw.  The time before this I had a delicious burger. I was surprised the steak was so bad because my sister had it before and she said it was great. The drinks are also hit or miss. They made me a terrible margarita, but other drinks I have had were good. I just won't get margaritas from here anymore.  Service: It really pissed me off when this girl just dropped our appetizer on our table and walked away. Then I saw the same girl give a nearby table their food, and saw her smiling, and conversing with them shortly. I know she was not our server, but that was still incredibly rude! However, our actual server was a nice guy. On another occasion our server was almost totally absent, and it was not crowded at all. What gives? Overall I have had more bad occasions than good. I want to give them at least 2.5 stars but the lack of consistency is killing me. I just can't give them a full 3."
