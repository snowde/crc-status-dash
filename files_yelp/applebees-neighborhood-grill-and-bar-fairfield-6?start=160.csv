Tiffany V.,"Fairfield, CA",78,11,8,1.0,2/20/2012,"I'd like to preface this with the fact that my co-workers and I used to come here often for late-night happy hour.  Cheap appetizers and drinks were a perfect match for me, but as of late the quality of service has gone down tremendously.   After a long hiatus, my boyfriend and I decided to give Applebee's a shot. After being seated, we waited for 10 minutes before our server came over to take our drink orders; a long island, a margarita, and a round of waters, and we asked her to return for our appetizer order.  We waited, and waited, and waited some more and she finally returned to take our food orders.  We placed that, and she walked away again.  30 minutes from when we were seated, we finally received our first round of drinks, albeit without the waters.  Before I could make mention of it, she was gone again.  My boyfriend tasted his drink, and it was absolutely awful.  Now for $3.29 I'm not expecting the best drinks in the world, but I am expecting something that we could drink.  We tried to flag her down, but she did not come around to check on us, and when she was at the table on the opposite side of the partition, it was as if she couldn't see us trying to get her attention.  20 minutes later (50 minutes from our initial sit down time), our appetizers finally came out and as our server was starting to run away again, I called her back to again ask for waters, for appetizer plates for our newly acquired food and to point out the fact that his drink was not good and to ask for a re-fire.  She said no problem, and ran off.  15 minutes later, a food runner came with his drink, dropping it off and disappearing.  One taste of it and again, it was no good.  This time it tasted like it was the same drink that they let sit on the counter for a bit then refreshed the ice.  The drink was completely watered down.  We glanced around the dining room, and did not see our server again, but fortunately another server that we were familiar with was passing by and had stopped at our table to say hi.  We told him the issue, and he went and found our server and again had her re-fire the drink.  An hour and a half from when we arrived, my boyfriend got drink number 3 and upon tasting it it was STILL WRONG!!   Our food was long gone (and we had to eat off the serving plates because we never received our appetizer plates), no waters, and he hadn't even received a decent drink.   Then another girl walked up and told us that our server had to go home early, so she would be taking over.  I asked for our bill, and told her about how his drink was still incorrect.  She offered to just take the drink off the bill for us, which hey, I'm not opposed to since we sat around for nearly 2 hours and he didn't even get to consume one, and she promptly brought the bill.  I checked the total, $21.  Not bad, but upon thinking about it, that didn't make any sense.  I had 1 drink, the quesadilla, and the boneless wings (after having his drink removed from the bill) so how it came that high was beyond me.  At this point, we asked to speak with the manager.  10 minutes later, he comes mozying on over, like he's taking a Sunday stroll.  I outline all of the issues we had with that night and said it made zero sense how our bill was so high.  He (Tom I think his name was) tried to talk down to me, telling me that my math had to be incorrect because there was no way that the computer could be wrong.  I busted out my calculator and added the figures IN FRONT OF HIM and to his dismay, he was incorrect.  He then started to make excuses for the server, how she was dealing with family issues so she was having a bad night to which I quickly quipped back with the fact that I'm there to receive a service, and not be a therapist, so the was neither here nor there.  I don't need excuses, I need the service I'm paying for to be correct.  Not once was an apology given.  In total, 2 hours from being seated to reconciling our bill. In closing, I will never be returning to this location, especially since was not the first time that they attempted to over charge me (one time, a $40 bill somehow mysteriously got charged on my card as $93, and it took over a week for me to get my money back).  I've been here more times than I can count, spending more money than I'd like to admit, but with the service that we received (and how it's declined greatly over the past months) I'd rather go to Red Robin or Chevy's."

Karla E.,"Vallejo, CA",20,32,12,2.0,10/22/2009,"I just had dinner there tonight.... the food was great! the service..... eh, I've experienced way better! We had two different waiters for some reason and the second one kept on coming back every 5 minutes asking if we were OK and if we needed boxes and then she brought the check and we weren't even half way through with our meals!  Then the manager came and asked if we were doing OK and said ""how about a couple more napkins?"" and she came back and literally brought us a couple of napkins! This was just not a good experience! To top it off, they were out of mints!  i would have to think twice before coming here again....."
Alex S.,"Fairfield, CA",33,5,4,1.0,8/7/2012,Got seated and went unattended for 15 minutes so we left. This is the second time this has happened. It was around 8:30pm and there was barely anyone there. Plus they microwave most of their food anyways. Safe to say that Applebees is a place we are never going to eat again.
Eleanor M.,"Suisun City, CA",0,4,1,5.0,8/2/2014,I like the service & the prices. The food is very good. There Strawberry Lemonade is off the hook and refreshing.
Holly H.,"Vacaville, CA",15,15,,1.0,9/16/2011,"This is by far the worst service I have ever had. The 1st time we went, the girl shorted my change $19.74, and must have thought I wouldn't catch that.. The second time, we waited 20 minutes for our drinks, another 20 for our appetizer and over 30 more minutes for our food. Staff was completely unorganized, just lolly gagging around. the food was ok. I more than likely will never go back. And if I do, it will be for take out!"
Terri L.,"San Jose, CA",200,262,225,3.0,1/4/2012,"My friends and I planned a dinner originally at Red Robin. The wait time there was only an hour :/ and we were starving, so a few people went to Buffalo Wild Wings and others went to Applebee's to check wait times. Buffalo Wild Wings also had an hour wait and Applebee's only had five minutes! So, Applebee's instead! We went in and sat at our table and immediately the server asked us for drinks. I have never been here before so I was wondering what food they have. There wasn't much that was considered healthy, even the salads were high in calories! I ordered an under 500 calorie meal with chicken, potatoes, and steamed veggies since the description sounded delicious! After 20 minutes or so, she came back to get our orders. After ordering, we probably waited about 30 minutes for our food, but we all really didn't pay attention since we were all talking about random stuff like school and work and life. I really enjoyed my time with them. Once we got our food, someone had a mix up. One of my friends was given the wrong meal and asked for the correct version. My plate was small considering it was $12... All my friends got double what I got and paid $12... I realized I shouldn't even be looking at calorie counts since most of the food was too big to eat in one sitting. Our waitress appeared to have been annoyed because she was giving us a bit of an attitude. It didn't really matter to us because we were not even paying attention to her. We stayed after eating for a bit. They took a really long time for our checks, and they didn't even pick up the orders that were in exact change. We just left it at the table. There was a good vibe here, and I'd like to come another day! But they do need more and better food choices because they didn't have much that I wanted. And more healthier plates too! The prices for the healthier options were ridiculous for the plate size. At least lower it down to compare it to the larger size plates. If the larger sized plates were put in smaller sizes, they would have been very similar to the healthier plates. But, at least it was a good first experience and I know what to order."
Rosemarie B.,"Fairfield, CA",140,65,684,2.0,4/25/2011,"I've been here so many times and i come in with an optimistic view that one day i can say ""Mmm.. eating good in my neighborhood with Applebee's"" but suffice to say this place fails me everytime.  I always try what's new on the menu but no matter what I try the food, I wished I chose a different place to eat.  The food is salty, presented like the food was thrown on the plate, and it takes awhile to get to you.  The service is okay, I've mostly been served by young kids who are not considerate and don't check up on  their guests but oh well.  If you're going in to eat at the bar or if your're in high school this place would be perfect!  So I'm not hatin' on Applebee's but it ain't that good in my neighborhood =P"
TIm D.,"Fairfield, CA",0,6,,4.0,6/3/2012,"The place is underrated, in my humble opinion. Years ago when we first ate here we were underwhelmed, but since the big chef makeover a few years back, the food has been quite scrumptious... way better than you might expect in this setting. The service is generally quite personable... Once in a while we've had to wait or the food has arrived on the cool side. Lots of low-calorie choices that are still very tasty. The steaks are particularly good, and they're not afraid to serve it rare when asked. A solid four stars."
alice c.,"Vallejo, CA",134,11,20,2.0,10/1/2011,"Normally Applebee's is always a good choice. This particular one however is not. Our service was horrible, two tables of at least 4 sat down after us and were served and left before us (party of 3) our drinks took 20 mins to get to our table and we ordered them right away. When they finally came they were the wring kind and one Margarita had an olive in the glass.  As we were mid sentence our server turned her back on us and walked away, can you say rude. steak was under cooked and sent back TWICE before we asked for it o be taken off. Just a horrible experience"
Shig N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",28,133,5,3.0,3/22/2011,This is only the 2nd Applebee's that we've been to.  I ordered a hamburger and enjoyed it.  One of the better hamburgers that I've had in restaurants of this class.
Lindsay C.,"Elk Grove, CA",30,45,2,2.0,8/2/2011,"I always seem disappointed when I leave Applebees. The service was fine, I had to ask for things a number of times but got it eventually. The food is always what makes me regret going to Applebees. We only went because we had a giftcard. Probably won't be back."
Bee O O.,"Vancouver, WA",58,102,1,2.0,1/4/2009,"Ok, there's a problem when you are asked if you want your burger ""with or without pink"", instead of rare, medium, etc. My mom and I shared the Bruschetta burger ""with pink"" and it came out completely brown - not medium, not even medium-well, but more like well-burnt. Everything was dry as hell and nobody came to refill our waters. I finished my glass, drank my mom's, and started on my dad's (what can I say, I am actually a sponge) and not once did anyone come by to refill or even ask if we needed anything! I give it the second star because the buffalo wing/nugget things are pretty darn tasty.  Most of the people in there were at the bar, not eating, just drinking (at 11.30 am). I guess we should have taken a cue from them."
octavia m.,"Fairfield, CA",95,14,,1.0,3/29/2013,This place is seriously in need if a whole new crew and management. Came in tonight on my lunch break with a coworker I ordered a Appetizer boneless wings and my coworker ordered the fried green beans or whatever it's called we ordered at 1135 ish from the hostess supposedly she gave the order to the bar keep.. Which walked past us 3/4 times with no communication on our food and how long it would be I asked about it about 3 sep times everyone said they were checking on it but yet NO FOOD!! SO WE WALKED OUT!!  The bar keeps seemed so lost or something WHERE IS MONICA or NUNU or MARIA? They were great!!! Also came here with friends and bf last week ordered appetizers drinks meals and never got our apps and then the manager comes out and says oh yeah I've seen them sitting in the back like really u just watching our food get cold and expect me to pay for it idts ..... The first time I brought my sister her she had her meal also not made to her liking and it took the food 4 times to be made before the manager came out to our table!!!! And then made us feel like we were wrong because the food wasn't how my sister asked it to be!!!! You may have changed the decorations and added glass but the attitude and service sucks!!! That's why I stay at the Vallejo location or hit up Chevys!!!!!
Bobbi W.,"Fairfield, CA",28,13,,1.0,12/28/2013,Service here sucks. I typically over tip (30% or so) but today I left a buck because the waitress was so bad. Never coming back.
Rosan D.,"Castro Valley, CA",9,42,,2.0,1/7/2011,"This isn't the best Applebee's, but i've been coming here for years.  I definitely only go for the bar.  Since they added happy hour it's turned into a go to place late at night.  When I come I'm usually just here for the drinks and gradually get an appetizer of boneless buffalo wings."
Luis C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,15,,2.0,1/31/2011,"C'mon ya'll, don't lie. The reason why to visit Applebee's is because of the 2 for $20 dinners.  Well, at least that's my reason and their happy hour.  I know it's not French gourmet or anything like that but it's OK for what you pay for.  The reason why I'm giving this location two stars is because:  The entrance where the hostess stands is too small and people are on your way when you're trying to get in.  The bathrooms are way in the back, you gotta walk thru all these tables and I would hate to be sitting near the bathroom!  The waiter ""Blake"" on this visit (1/29/11) was not good.  Stingy w/ ranch dressing, napkins, cherries & refills.  I'll continue to visit Applebee's, just not this one."
Traci G.,"Fairfield, CA",4,21,,2.0,10/31/2012,"My son and I went there on Sunday the 28th of October. I have definately experienced better there. We were seated right away. Ordered water and a brewtus for me. Got the water right away. But took an additional 15 minutes to get my beer. The waiter that brought us our water when I asked about it said ""I don't get the beer"" About 10 minutes later our order was taken. My son ordered the ultimate trio I ordered the appetizer sampler. After 30 minutes we FINALLY got our food. I then asked for another beer. Now here is the frustrating part. The waiter that said ""I don't get the beer"" is the person that brought me my second beer. By now I couldn't finish the second beer due to time constraints. Which frustrated me. I don't like to leave undrank beer. I will not be going back there for a long time. When I told the waiter I was ready for my check. He took my money. Told me he would be right back with my change. 10 minutes later I finally got my change. This was the most HORRIBLE experience I have ever had there."
Ann S.,"Green Valley, CA",0,13,,1.0,4/4/2013,"Typical chain food.  Our server was great, but my medium rare steak came out well done.  I didn't send it back, lest the cook spit on it.  My baked potato came after I was half way done with my entree.   Won't go back unless I'm in the mall and desperate."
R V.,"Fairfield, CA",0,40,16,2.0,11/19/2013,"The food was not bad. We had steak & shrimp. Also onion rings. The steak was tasty (although small). The onion rings were nicely done. The real problem was the service (or lack of it). The host staff seemed to spend most of their time chatting amongst themselves instead of the guests. Our server missed some of our drink order. No big deal. After our entrees were served our server was almost non existent. We saw him only once more the whole visit. I had to fend for myself to get steak sauce from another table. It took a whole 30 minutes after we finished eating to flag someone down for our check. When we told him he hadn't tried to suggestive sell us a gift card (they're supposed to give you some free mozzarella sticks if they fail to try to suggestive sell you a gift card), he said ""Well you haven't given me a chance to."" & then made a lame attempt in an attempt to cover his butt. The food was not bad, the atmosphere was pretty good. But the service was almost non existent. Too bad."
