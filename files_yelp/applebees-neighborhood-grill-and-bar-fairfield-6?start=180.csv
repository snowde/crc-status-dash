Sunie K.,"Oakland, CA",150,45,1,2.0,2/12/2010,Crappy service (most of the time) and mediocre food. I just go for the happy hour. DO NOT GET THE FOOD. I know first hand they are pretty unsanitary.
Shari D.,"Oakland, CA",5,12,2,2.0,1/19/2012,"I just had 1 of my worst restaurant experiences at Applebee's in Fairfiled, Ca. My son in law is in boot camp so decided to take daughter and 3 grandkids with a few others to Applebee's to cheer her up. There were 8 of us in total, 4 adults, 4 kids. I sign in at 6 pm. and ask wait time as you know how little ones can be. He tells me 15 min. So we wait. 25 min go by and see tables of 4 pass us by. Wondering why cant they put 2 tables together? Host walks up and tells me there waiting for 1 particular party to get up.Another 10 min.kids are crying, table still occupied. Host says found another table where they can put 2 together but waiting on 1 of those tables. At 48 min of waiting, I tell host "" look its been 48 min. if you had told me this on the front end we would of left,{ as my party had asked me to do already a few times} I would like to speak to your manager. He takes off with 2 of his colleagues. 5 min. goes by, he comes back, table is ready! We get seated. We wait 8 min. no waitress. 1 of our party see's manager and approaches him. He tries to tell manager what we have just gone thru, kids still crying as there HUNGRY, and manager Tom I believe his name was, grabs Mike by the arm, not roughly, but you shouldnt put your hands on a customer and tells him to remain calm and they would be right with us. Now Mike was calm, just trying to explain and make manager aware. Not so calm after manager puts hands on him, lol, waitress arrives and she was great, food comes, mine was good, after about 15 min.into meal manager comes to table asks if all is ok. No apologies, no comps. nothing! As my friends know I myself am a manger of a store, this was the WORST customer service and not the way anyone should be treated! Just thought you should know there was no caring for this customer from Applebee's lol"
S B.,"Albuquerque, NM",22,79,1,1.0,7/8/2009,"This was the most hilarious experience.. My friend ordered the steak and it came out looking like a piece of dog poop.. no joke! I am a vegetarian and there was NOTHING on this menu.. except a  "" Veggie Patch Pizza""  this was a tortilla covered in white sauce, a crap load of cheese and... well, that's it.  While eating, I noticed that 5 other tables were also complaining about their meals.. (not a good sign) . You are better off eating a real piece of dog poop"
Katherine K.,"Suisun City, CA",90,78,39,3.0,6/11/2009,"Just came back from dinner, it was pleasantly nice. Waitress was awesome! Never once had to ask for ANYTHING. We did the appetizer and 2 entree special for 20 bucks. Spinach & artichoke dip was cool, nothing spectacular, but cool. Matt had the steak and veggies and for myself, the quesadillA burger. Good, good. Overall, a pleasant experience for the right price. =)"
karlie h.,"Suisun City, CA",0,4,,4.0,11/3/2011,"lately ive been working real late and im real to tired to get home and cook dinner for me and my fiance, so alot of times we go out , so applebees is a great place to go eat since theyre open later than most resurants, they have AMAZING STAFF they i probably have never seenn such good customer service, the waiters/waitress' really know there stuff and can really make the experience so much fun even just for a quick dinner ! the  pricing is very reasonable , and a tastey steak dinner under 500 calories is such an amazing find  ! i never really liked applebees till i started going to the one in this mall and trust me they have changed my mind completly !"
Kat C.,"Santa Fe, NM",487,967,19,2.0,3/24/2007,"I've never been to applebees before, and I didn't really like it. The overly kitsch and the cuteness was pretty gross. Also, one can tell by the clientele that this isn't healthy eating. I mean, we're talking BIG, sloppily dressed people. (I know, awful, but true). The weight watchers foods were MINI and they would have to be based on the greasy, cheesy gross foods they were serving. Plus, my fruit bowl had mold on it. The waitress seemed a bit busy, but it's really not her fault the kitchen was getting things wrong."
Lacey C.,"Sacramento, CA",433,382,166,1.0,5/19/2008,Very little Vegetarian Options. There are no entrees that are Vegetarian. The appetizers have a few options though. Upon not being interested in Spinach Artichoke dip or Mozzerella sticks for dinner I asked if they had Veggie Burgers. The waitress had to ask... she said they did. So I ordered a Veggie Burger. Since all but one of their burgers have bacon on them I also made sure to say no Bacon (even though you think that would be a given) So my veggie burger comes back... with bacon. WOW!  They do have something called the Veggie patch Pizza it's not too great though. It's badly boiled veggies on cheesy bread... BTW even the salads @ Applebees have meat in them... Seriously what kind of a chain restaurant has such little healthy/veggie options.
Pippi L.,"South San Francisco, CA",55,295,,4.0,11/27/2006,"This is the first time I've ever been to an applebee's and I have to say it was pretty good, compared to other chain restaurants I've been to. I guess they are trying to fancy up their menu because they have entrees created by the Food Network guy, Tyler Florence. (he's hot) Anyway, I had the Crispy Brick oven chicken and my boyfriend had the Bruschetta burger. Sooooooo good. And then we finished off with a dreamsicle cake. yum. Now I'm going to have to find an applebee's closer to where I live!"
Kat R.,"Seattle, WA",30,35,1,1.0,2/14/2009,"let's start with the fact that I wish I could give them half a star because I feel a whole star is way too kind.  Having said that I now feel I should back it up with a list of what went wrong:  My friend and I stopped in for drinks and a little nibble before going to a movie, gave ourselves about an hour before it started. Plenty of time!  So we order our drinks and decide to split the nachos sans the meat (for yours truly) and sour cream on the side for her. Now believe me we were very clear about the whole ""leave the meat and sour cream on the side"" thing. When the food comes it is covered in both meat and sour cream (fail #1). We politely send it back, everyone messes up every now, then and we weren't in that big of rush and we had drinks! The waitress then comes back and says they ran out of the meat and have to cook more. We say it's fine to just leave it off completely. She brings up plain chips and salsa while we wait. Crappy watery salsa (fail #2). Then she comes back about ten minutes later and tells us they are completely out of meat (remember how we didn't care if there was meat because I didn't eat it and my friend didn't care either way?) we say that's fine we just want nachos...she asks if the chips and salsa are fine instead. ummm...no? We wanted nachos, with cheese and tomatoes and lettuce and goodness dripping off of them. She says ""I can heat up some cheese and bring it to you"" (fail #3). We so no thanks we'll take the bill. 15 minutes later...she comes by and asks if we want another drink!!! (fail #4) We demand check and are now annoyed.  Side note: they have a promo going on right now where if the manager doesn't visit your table by the time you leave you get $10 off your next meal there, and of coures this whole time ms. manager is nowhere to be found.  We FINALLY get our check (movie starts in 5 mins) and give her a credit card. When she takes it the manager finally walks by us for the first time and goes to a table across from us where this guy is pissed and demanding his $10 coupon, we chuckle because we know we're about to do the same thing. The manager then walks over to us just as the waitress is giving us our card back and my smart ass comes out. I start to laugh and cut her off mid sentence, tell her what happen and start to stand up (I'm pretty short and in no way intimidating but she looked scared) I said ""we're done, we're leaving, hand over the $10 coupon that we will then throw away because we will not be coming back, and I hope your night sucks""  I admit, I can be a bitch at time but dammit we're in a re session. I can't afford to give my money to people who don't deserve it.  I feel I need to stop visiting chain restaurants all together.  DONE!"
