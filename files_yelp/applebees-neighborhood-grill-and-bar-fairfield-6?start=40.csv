Brian C.,"Fairfield, CA",1,14,6,1.0,4/23/2017,"Trash on the floor in dining room, the bathroom floors wet with urine, medium rare hamburgers took 50 minutes to come out cooked well done, Luke warm fries, one flat warm beer."
Jim G.,"Fairfield, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/5/2016,"Applebee's in the Fairfield Solano Mall,is the place NOT to go.  I have never been to a restaurant with such terrible service.  And, they defenately should get rid of the bartender and replace her with someone who can pour a beer in under 30-35 minutes. TERRIBLE, I can't even give it 1 star."
Dave D.,"Napa, CA",31,35,4,1.0,8/8/2015,"Dirty, dirty, dirty...when we were seated my arm stuck to the table....we asked the server if she could clean it, she sure in a minute, it's been 15 mins now.  I'll make sure I have her tip ready."
Consuela M.,"San Francisco, CA",20,87,67,2.0,1/26/2017,"First off, the music is always way too loud in this place.  PLEASE turn it down!  Second; why can't one get a non alcoholic beer in here?  The Vallejo location carries it.  We've asked and been shut down numerous times.  Really the only reason we come here is for convenience.  The other thing I would ad would be directed at corporate; please stop changing your menu every other week.  Seriously, by the time we find something we like, ""poof!"", it's gone!  Applebee's FF, please step up your game!"
Christy M.,"Vallejo, CA",0,8,1,1.0,3/11/2017,Worst place I have ever been so not come here worst service our waitress was literally sitting in the booth with her friends didn't even take our order the management and servers here should be ashamed of themselves.
Lisa G.,"Anchorage, AK",0,10,,1.0,5/21/2017,"If I could rate a zero I would. I am here at the mall, starving hungry and I walked up and stood there. The hostess looked at me, when I said 1, she said well it's going to be a wait. I said that's fine and she went back to what she was doing.  She didn't take a name or anything. I guess they didn't want to work today but I bet she sure thought she deserved her pay check."
Sekushii A.,"Fairfield, CA",92,29,2,4.0,7/12/2016,Happy hour! Chicken wonton tacos. Yum! Ordered all my happy hour needs from the tablet. It was wonderful. I haven't done happy hour here before but it was great. Half off appetizers! Check it out.
Constance S.,"Fairfield, CA",23,1,,1.0,3/11/2017,Service sucks!!! Took 20 mins to get mozzarella sticks and an extra 5 to get the marinara. Not even going to mention the drink. They were NOT full which makes it worse.
Marcos F.,"Fairfield, CA",1,3,2,1.0,1/15/2017,"Always running out of food, co2 for the soda, over price not recommend it at all. Everytime i ask my steak medium its always well done."
Sunny S.,"Fairfield, CA",6,12,5,5.0,2/10/2017,Every time I come here I usually come with my best friend and we sit at the bar. I must say Maria is amazing and knows her drinks as a bar tender! She always makes sure we're okay and attended too. Her drinks are great! Always happy to come here just to see her!
Melissa V.,"Petaluma, CA",70,9,2,5.0,1/12/2017,"Compared to other Applebee's I've been to, the service was quite fast. The waitress, Noreen, went above & beyond! She was so helpful and carried a positive energy."
Kat D.,"Fairfield, CA",76,172,129,2.0,9/4/2015,"My husband and I decided to have lunch at our local Applebees, bad move on our part. The only reason they are getting 2 stars was due to the excellent service we received. Not the server's fault the cook in the back isn't doing their job.  But this is a restaurant and the main thing about this review is on the food.  We ordered the wonton chicken tacos and the the kobe style meatballs for a appetizer. The tacos were ok, but they seriously need to add more chicken! But the bigger problem was the meatballs. My husband took one bite and spit it right out! Why? It was cold, i thought hey he likes his soup so hot that it burns his tongue on the well down, but when i touched it, it felt as if it wasnt even at room temperature, like it was taken out of the freezer. That was sent back. Now here comes the entree, I decided to go with the lunch combo, I ordered chicken fajita roll up. (Once again barely any chicken, the thing was pretty much stuff with just lettuce) and the 4 cheese mac and cheese w/ pepper chicken. (It was drench with oil, took a few bites and couldn't even continue)  strangely enough my husband ordered the 4 cheese mac and cheese as well but his was oozing with oil so what the heck?  Its safe to say less then a hour after our lunch, my husband had to make a urgent trip to the bathroom, dirty dirty dirty. Last trip for us!"
Jade F.,"Santa Cruz, CA",388,1,,4.0,2/3/2017,"Generally good but especially loved David the host! Went out of his way on multiple occasions for us and other guests. I appreciate a hard, dedicated worker when I see one. Thank you David!"
Kevin S.,"Hayward, CA",0,8,,1.0,6/3/2017,"Customer service is horrible, bad attitude, at least act like you care and do your job.we were never greeted or seated. Had to go and ask. Server took a long time to come talk to us. She didn't even know what was on tap. So we had to guess what to order. Food took way too long to come out! We are still waiting! Ghetto crowd. Not inviting place at all. Not coming back!"
Leonardo L.,"Fairfield, CA",48,2,,1.0,10/13/2017,"This place really needs to make sure all their employees are properly trained before letting them work by themselves. My girlfriend and I walked to the entrance, The greeter/host asked me how many in the party and what my first name was. I then said ""for two, my name is Leo"" clearly. She wrote it down on the paper in front of her ""supposedly"" then i sat down to wait while she said ""it will be a 10 minute wait"" ii said ok, cool 10 minutes isnt bad. then i heard other people that were waiting that its been about 30 minutes since they have been waiting. She kept telling the people that were coming in that it would only be 10 minutes when it was taking much longer. As time passed by i then noticed that some people that were arriving later than us and were getting seated before us. I didnt say anything for the first two groups just becuase the group was much bigger so maybe a bigger table was open before a table for two but it happened again. Then i walked up to the greeter and asked ""do you know what ever happened to our table?"" She then said ""did you sign in?"" as if she didnt remember i signed in 15 minutes ago. i said ""yea my name is Leo"" But she didnt see it on the paper to sign in. Then she said "" hold on let me find a table for you right now"" i said alright as i waited on the waiting area. She came back and left twice and didnt even update me on the table or what was going on as if i never existed. Then i asked her ""what ever happened to the table"" and she said ""oh ill go find it right now"" and didnt come back after 10 minutes. They really need to get organized"
Alondra T.,"Fairfield, CA",0,3,,5.0,7/14/2017,LOVE the margaritas here!!!!! (The house lemon on the rocks margarita) and the customer service is good too!
Jessica P.,"Vallejo, CA",38,13,2,1.0,5/28/2017,Staff very unprofessional. I'm sitting at a table listening to the hostess talk to her friend about boys.
Allen K.,"West Sacramento, CA",83,194,646,5.0,2/17/2016,"I had lunch today and I had a wonderful experience! The waitress that serve me today was excellent! Always friendly, smiling and coming back to ask if I needed anything? I will definitely come back just for her smile and excellent service!"
August D.,"Sacramento, CA",1,27,4,5.0,9/21/2016,"Went for Wednesday Happy Hour, and Maria was a fantastic server and bartender! She was very quick, attentive, and personable. We ordered within the final minutes of happy hour, and Maria was extremely accommodating. She made our drinks immediately and they were fantastic! She was friendly and funny. I hope Maria is working the next time we come. The food was great too with great options for $4 during happy hour. Chicken wonton tacos, perfection. Best Applebee's service we have ever had."
