Jackie T.,"Fairfield, CA",0,6,,1.0,4/30/2017,"This applebees is horrible!! We have finally hit our last straw for coming here! It started when our young 20 year old server came to our table to take our drink order after waiting for almost 5 minutes already and she said as she's placing our napkins down ""oh my feet and back hurt what a long day"" and then finally said her name and took our order. So that set me off already then my salad arrived before our drinks I had to wait at least another 5-7 minutes for silverware. Then my daughter bit into her corn dog and it was frozen.. they brought back a cooked corn dog and manager comped all the kids meals.. I didn't want to leave a tip but as a fellow server and bartender I felt $3 was sufficient.. corporate needs to come in and do a major clean out of this restaurant and start over!"

Kevin C.,"Long Beach, CA",79,28,6,1.0,3/14/2017,"So I came to Applebee's on a Tuesday around 4 PM during happy hour, I waited at the front to be seated for 15 minutes, employees kept passing by and nobody tried to acknowledge us. So I sat myself in plain view and waited for a server to come by, after a few minutes of sitting down with my girlfriend... still nothing. So I got up, and as I was leaving, nobody had yet acknowledged that I was leaving the place. On the way out, I saw a server and I told her that employees take too long to seat customers and attend them, her excuse was that they didn't have enough people. To me as a customer, that was a very lame excuse. When there was a bunch of employees just walking passed us while we waited to be seated. All it takes is less than one minute to see somebody down! Honestly would not recommend this place to anybody, Very poor customer service for it not being busy ! STEP IT UP  there should always be someone at the front"
Rachel H.,"Dixon, CA",15,3,5,1.0,8/24/2016,I have been here two times in the last 3 months and both times have had horrible service. The hostess is the same young girl both times and she is very rude and unprofessional. The first time she was very rude and took my sons meal while we went to restroom. Nothing was eaten off of his plate so I had to wait while hey made a new plate. She didn't apologize and the second visit she was going out of order to seat people and was going to seat us. There was many groups in front of us with the same amount of people and I said they were in front of us I believe and she said yes I know! And turned around to help them very rudely. The serves seem to not care about nothing but getting you in and out. I will not be back.
Anno D.,"Martinez, CA",71,11,14,2.0,1/15/2017,"Let me start saying that I went there Thursday evening around 8:45pm. The place was decently full and there was a lot of vacant table still. I was greeted right away as I walked in and seated. How ever, it took them 15 minutes just to get my order. My server though acknowledged my presence but she should have asked me if I want something to drink or get an appetizer. The worst thing about the experience was waiting for the bill and paying it. And you guessed it right. It took another 15 minutes just to check me out. My table was literally across their cash register. And to top it all, gave my bill by handing me the thermal paper receipt without even the check/bill holder. So if you have plenty of time to spare and not that hungry, I would recommend this place. Or if you have a date that wants to talk a lot, I guess this would be the place to dine."
Bear F.,"Suisun City, CA",38,98,179,1.0,6/30/2015,"The male server was literally longed face (frowning),uninterested in getting our order,and spoke to us as though we were uninvited/unwelcomed. Look, I understand there are bad days, but you selected the job, so deal with it or quit. My drink was literally with maybe 3 drops strawberry syrup in my lemonade, unstirred and unappealing.  I tried to catch him to change the drink, he avoided tables and eye contact. I ate a piece of shrimp that simply was not good, I will say no more about that. I ended up requesting the manager, Juan.  Juan gave us a new waitress, Kristen, great customer service. I ordered food to go as well, I should have not been trying to rush out, they did not give me the salad with the meal deal,2 for$20, no utensils,and no napkins.  Simply will not return to this location."
Heidi C.,"Vacaville, CA",32,52,2,2.0,7/3/2016,"Ah, the eternal quandary--where to eat near the Fairfield theater that will get you out in time to watch your movie, and have food and service that is decent.  We decided to give Applebees a whirl.  Yes, we were in and out in time for our movie; and yes, the food was pretty good with decent (albeit inexperienced) service.  So, mission accomplished.   However, while we were seated relatively quickly, I felt that the hostess staff was initially oblivious to new customers; they have some funky charity campaign going on, and all of their decorations completely obscures the hostess station and the hostesses were busy chatting 6 feet behind it.  The one who finally took us to our table seemed confused where she was going; it was like they had no map or computer program, but were winging it when they set guests up with tables.  Our server was very pleasant and personable, but seemed somewhat new.  We took a bit of time to figure out what we wanted, and she was patient with us and observant--she noted when we all folded our menus and was right over.  My kids enjoyed their dinners (a beef and potatoes entree, and a pork chop), which is a plus.  My husband said his ""triple hog dare you"" sandwich had too much going on to be really good; he liked it but won't get it again.  My salmon was delivered late; they brought out chicken first.  When I finally got it, the salmon was hot but was nearly overcooked--no hint of pink at all in the flakey flesh.  The ""steamed"" spinach was obviously microwaved, as it was dry and kind of sticking to the plate.  It didn't come with the sauce as advertised, I had to ask for it.  The broccoli was good, and their new maple sweet potatoes were really delicious. The really negative was oddball stuff.  The bathroom smelled funny and looked like the drain might have a habit of overflowing, there was water on the floor.  I swear my daughter's steak knife kept ""weeping"" water--I think there was water trapped between the layers of the knife handle, but when I took it from her to look closer, I couldn't replicate what had been happening when she cut her meat.  And, when we had finished but before we even got our bill, someone was there to clear the plates--that's fine, but she actually stacked up and took away our glasses, so we were left with a completely empty table while we waited for the bill!  I felt that they were really rushing us out the door; that, and I felt like the young lady doing the busing was very new, and didn't really think about how that made us feel.  Overall, feels like this place is full of very new staff who need a lot more training.  The food was totally passable, and it did get the job done--fed and happy, we hit the theater and enjoyed our movie."
ByFaith M.,"Pittsburg, CA",26,2,1,4.0,8/1/2016,The food was great the wait time wasnt long we were seated asap our server checked on us from time2time. This place is a nice quit restaurant. Mariana was our server she was Grate!
D C.,"Fairfield, CA",1,21,4,1.0,8/12/2015,"It sucked. It sucked so bad that I feel awful knowing that my first meal of the day came from here, and I'm also kinda pissed that the experience wasn't so great for my mom on her birthday.  First of all, the food was disgusting. The appetizers we ordered were probably the only decent items, but you can't really screw up mozzarella sticks or onion rings. I ordered the chicken penne and noooooooo. God, no. I just got over a vegetarian phase after I accidentally ate raw chicken and now I want to go right back. It contained a mixture of dry pieces and mushy pieces so I don't really know how I feel about that. And I thought it was absolutely ridiculous how we got charged an extra $2 for a tiny cup of coleslaw.  Second of all, the service flat out sucked. I don't really want to directly call out our server (so I'll call her N) but I wasn't impressed. She greeted us, brought out our drinks, and asked for our order but we weren't really ready yet. THIS GIRL DISAPPEARED FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES. For WHY??? Yeah, thanks for the extra time but we were done in about 5 minutes. To be honest, I was surprised she actually came back because it seemed like she forgot about us. Also, refills were nonexistent. What is water. What is iced tea. And finally, when we were ready to go, she took our check and disappeared again. I caught her standing with the host with 3 other employees just talking near the entrance. I'm sorry, but what was so important? Then I saw a small group of guys come in and it all made sense.  She acted nice, though, and the water was wet so that deserves a pretty star."
David L.,"Fairfield, CA",1,4,,1.0,7/8/2016,Service was terrible. Took forever to get what we ordered. The appetizers came out after the main course. The food was cold when it arrived. Terrible place to eat. I will never go back or recommend.
Mimi Y.,"Napa, CA",0,34,1,1.0,2/17/2017,"Interesting how same restaurant can differ from location. This Fairfield store lacks service. Recent visit had us fuming for lack of prompt service and undercooked hamburger!  Hostess was surly, unfriendly and clearly was bored. When we complained we had even there almost half hour and no food she snapped back that we had not been there that long! Huh? Move her to the back of the house away from public. Waitress who finally waited on us kept say "" food coming shortly"" not so. It was almost 45 min before served. Totally unnecessary. We won't return. Mgr tried to mediate but by then too much damage had occurred. Applebees should train hostess better and make sure tables are promptly waited on."
Aubrey D.,"Fairfield, CA",356,413,569,4.0,6/13/2014,"Food is always good here, but the service can be a hit or a miss. The restaurant is clean and there are always great deals for food for two! There's also a Happy Hour, and you can always catch watching a game there with some folks!"
Susan K.,"West Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/15/2017,We ordered food to pick up and the portions are ridiculous! I ordered a side of fries for $4 for my son and there is hardly any fries. I ordered buffalo wings and they are BBQ and only gave 5 pieces!!! So disappointed!!
Samuel P.,"Sacramento, CA",391,11,4,1.0,5/19/2015,Understaffed. Didn't get my water until I was ready for my check. I asked for an orange slice for my drink and never got it until i walked to the bar myself. Do not order the Crosscut Ribs...I thought it was a joke. I blame the management. #neveragain
Henry N.,"Fairfield, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/14/2017,"We go to this Applebees  alot and while sometimes the service is abit slow but if its busy thats understandable.  This leads up to 5mins ago my wife and I  went there and was seated at a table with this male waiter who had one other table it was over five mins before he came by.  My wife ordered water,diet coke,and an ice tea several mins goes by and he stops at the other table and nothing for us. My wife asked our drinks he said hes working on it water and soda? We don't see him for awhile but I  see the other waitress bringing water and soda to a table that sat down way after we did. Few mins later I went to thw bathroom he is no where to be seen I  come out of the bathroom and he is finally at tje bar for drinks comes to the table and said the coke machine was broken.  After 20mins we just got water!! So we said never mind and went downstairs to ted robin where we got our drinks and food in less than 15mins. Poor service with only 10 people at the restaurant makes me think twice before wver going back again and I  will spread the word arouns."
Richard C.,"Fresno, CA",10,5,1,1.0,5/8/2016,"Had a horrible experience picking up food from here today. Placed our order online for pickup at 8:09. I show up at 8:15 and the multiple hosts ask to help and when I tell them I'm here for pickup they tell me they are busy but someone will be with me.  The hostess in charge of pickups walks by me twice to tell other pick ups that they are out of half rack ribs. She does not acknowledge me.  8:40 and when I tell the other hosts that my daughter and I are here for a pickup AND NO ONE KNOWS I'M HERE YET, they pick up the pace and I see the hostess by 8:45 to pay for my order BUT DID NOT RECEIVE MY FOOD.  9:00 rolls around and I finally get my food. There's another woman with a small toddler who has been waiting longer. What a mess!  Will not get take out at this location again."
Leanne C.,"Emeryville, CA",325,171,107,1.0,1/4/2014,"Unfortunately, I haven't had any great experiences at this Applebee's. The food is edible, but not good. The only reason I came here with my parents was to use up a gift card. Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend this place. The appetizer sampler is alright. Their spinach and artichoke dip is good, and you can't really go wrong with tortilla chips. The hot items on the plate, however, come out just warm (i.e. none of that ooey gooey cheesy goodness in the mozzarella sticks). Dad ordered the marsala mushroom sirloin and said it was just alright. We all had some trouble finishing our dishes. The service here isn't great either. Took quite a long time to flag our waitress down to get us the check. If you're really hungry, there are far better places to eat within (and also right outside of) Solano Mall. Perhaps check out the food court instead. It's all the way on the other side, but you'll definitely get something tastier for much cheaper."
Frances T.,"San Lorenzo, CA",89,19,2,3.0,5/2/2016,"We came for mainly appetizers and drinks. The waitress at first was lagging to come back to us. We placed our drink orders and asked for a minute for food orders, so we found what we wanted and I watched the waitress lean against a wall, gossiping with another waitress. But after that she was good, we got our drinks and food. Ordered some shots. Overall, it was okay. My best friends feels as if her food was recently frozen and the warmed up. Not good. It was a one time thing for us, so I doubt we'll be back to this exact Applebee's."
Valerie W.,"Fairfield, CA",1,8,1,1.0,12/3/2016,"Out with my 3 daughter's today for lunch, service was not good. The food was suboptimal. Our server failed to check on us, did not offer any refills nor could we get her attention in regards to getting ranch dressing or tomatoes for my salad. Very Poor Customer Service today. Apple Bee's, it will be a long time before you see me again."
Taralyn B.,"Vacaville, CA",4,4,1,5.0,5/4/2016,Second time I've sat at the bar and both times I've had great service but today was the best service I've had anywhere in a long time. It's 2:00 so not super busy but the bar has a good amount of people at it and the bartender is ON TOP OF IT. Let me tell you. Such an upbeat attitude and totally taking time to make sure you're doing good. VERY PLEASED with today's service!
