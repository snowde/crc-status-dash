Stacey L.,"Suisun City, CA",0,10,,1.0,4/30/2016,Yeah. This place has so much potential. But the leadership just isn't there.  I had to ask for a server.  And when she came she approached the wrong table first. And then it took forever to get our drinks. Food came out in a timely manner. I witnessed another table complain about a label in their salad. But it's hard pressed to have any staff available.
Elizabeth C.,"Concord, CA",0,8,3,1.0,11/28/2015,"Worst food experience ever! Hot wings came out after 40 minutes, dry , hardly any sauce. When we asked for more, they brought out a cup of cold hot sauce. Food came out cold, waited for food forever, then husbands food came out even later than that! Steak was over done and cup of mashed potatoes was only half full!This is all after we spoke to the manager! Ruined our date night. Shame is all I can say!"
Janet P.,"Suisun City, CA",29,9,2,5.0,7/21/2015,"I have been to this Applebee's several times. Service is okay and food is decent but small portions. Service has usually been slow, with food taking a while to arrive.  Tonight we were served by a new server named Tiffany. Recently transferred from out of state. She was awesome. Very attentive and on top of her tables. It was a promo night with free appetizer samplers offered to all tables. We were very impressed with how fast apps and entrees came out sizzling hot and everything was perfectly cooked. We will be back soon to see Tiffany"
Eddie P.,"Fairfield, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/8/2016,Did the to go service got here on time and didn't get helped till 10 minutes after even though there were 5 other people standing around wanking off. Ended up getting the food checked it cold and dissapointing. I recommend the vacaville one way better service
Kao T.,"Fairfield, CA",0,6,6,1.0,4/11/2016,"Horrible service! If only I can give it a -1000!!!! Came here on a date and the guy who set us on our table LITERALLYYYYY never came back! We waited 20 minutes with no water! No menu! No nothing! And when I saw another server and ask him can we get a server, he nodded yes and also never came back!!! WTF is wrong with this place! I was about to flip the table! But after a 30-40 minutes wait looking for someone to serve us we just left! Never ever coming here again and never recommending this place to anyone!"
Jai-Jonathan W.,"San Francisco, CA",154,2,,1.0,4/27/2016,"I had a horrible experience.  I ordered a drink a Margarita. It was watery didnt taste like achchol. I told watriess could she make another one and she gt rude ,mgr asked do i want another i stated no, he just butted in rudely.  Also after getting home they charged me for the drink that i didnt drink. I will be cwlling corporate.  From one manager to another i would I would not go back and I recommend you do not eat at this establishment , everytime I go the staff is very unprofessional also waitress brought me appetizer without napkins or silverware or plates, waited 10 minutes we grabbed our own napkins from a another table and the waitress asked us did we need silverware. Booo thumbs down"
Amanda L.,"Carson City, NV",18,63,114,3.0,2/6/2016,"After being in the hospital with our daughter who just had major surgery my husband and I finally got a night to enjoy with ourselves. Why we came here? It was convenient. The food is nothing more then microwave food. My husband ordered steak cooked medium well, let's say it was on the very rare side couldn't cut through it at all. My enchiladas were crispy and inedible. My husband ordered a Long Island but more like a cup of ice. My drink tasted like everyone's left over drinks poured into one cup. When talking to the manager Jeremy, he didn't give one apology for the quality of food we received. He gave us our options and was out of there. Long story short when we left I asked him for his name he told me Jeremy, then he he chased us out of the restaurant and asked why I asked, I told him how we felt about the service he gave us. Someone in his position is to make sure the customer is completely satisfied. This was not the case. He asked us if we wanted corporates number. WHAT? We just wanted an apology for the quality of food we received and an apology for him not treating us like customers. On the good side the waitresses should be promoted for their kindness and hard work having to deal with the kitchen mess ups and the managers unprofessional attitude. Update: upgrading to three stars because the manager Michelle reached out and genuinely apologized for Jeremy's unprofessional attitude I do appreciate that I have never met someone in his position to act that way. I'm looking forward to meeting Michelle to thank her for taking the time out to reach out to me."
Briana B.,"Suisun City, CA",230,188,577,3.0,8/18/2013,"Applebee's gets props for having happy hour 7 days a week, one during the day, and one at night. That being said, the one item I always order from the appetizer menu is the chicken quesadilla. It's a pretty good size portion and is tasty. If u want beer, they have the ""Brewtus"" glass size available, $3.49 for domestic, $4.49 imported. Right now the seasonal brew is Samuel Adams Octoberfest.  When I eat out at restaurants I usually don't order dessert, but here I do because they have a brownie bite dessert served with ice cream for $1.29. I think the small portion size is perfect! Last but not least, don't forget the $1.00 Jell-O shots."
EJ V.,"Fairfield, CA",14,45,12,1.0,1/30/2016,"First of all, you can't order onion rings as a appetizer or side unless you're doing the 2 for $20 or 2 for $25 deal which is dumb. The food took almost 30 minutes and it wasn't busy at all. My girlfriend and I finally got the food and it was cold. Never going here again. Don't eat here unless you wanna get fast food quality type of food that takes forever."
Candice S.,"Antioch, CA",9,292,,2.0,1/27/2013,"Oh man, I've had some truly fantastic times here... not. Applebee's seems like the place to go to once you live the movie theater. You just watched a great movie, you're kind of hungry and look, wouldn't you know, there's a restaurant right there! Right off the bat I knew something was suspect about this location just based on the way the layout was designed. It's like a puzzle. Like a very inconvenient puzzle and bless the person who dares to figure out where the restroom is. The service is abysmal. I've had two types of service: either they barely acknowledge you or they're never there. Which if you're trying to enjoy the experience makes it pretty darn hard to. A few times I've ordered food from the Weight Watchers selections and each time I noticed that the serving sizes were much larger than what they were supposed to be. I did Weight Watchers for two years and the portions they gave us at this location was nowhere near what they should have been. It was practically triple the size and completely lacking in all flavor. I've had other non-WW dishes, like the steak and what not, but it was just so tough. This place is the dumps. I give it 1 star for convenient location and nice restrooms, if you can find it, but dear lord, never come here. Once you exit the movie theater, repeat after me: there are other restaurants in the mall. Applebee's is not the only one."
Peter P.,"Fairfield, CA",0,12,12,1.0,8/28/2016,"OK, I was invited to join friends at Applebee's for lunch. Against my better judgement, I haven't been to an Applebee's in probably 10 years due to horrible service and items on my receipt that I didn't order, I agreed to join my friends. Well, Applebee's hasn't changed, service was horrible and we had items on our receipt that either we didn't order or that should have been included in a 2fer combo.  We caught the drink but not the appetizer, that should have been part of the  special, before we paid the bill . When we brought this up to our server he said that the manager would have to come over to take care of the issue. When the manager showed up she had a coupon for a ""free"" appetizer on my next visit. Hmmm, I think I just paid for that appetizer so how is it free? She made it clear that she didn't want to correct the charges on my card.  Well, this just confirms why I haven't been to an Applebee's in 10 years. It will be much longer before I visit an Applebee's again."
Abegail T.,"Fairfield, CA",60,37,18,3.0,1/15/2016,My husband and I go here before we go to the movies sometimes. The food is alright and the service is not bad either. The mac and cheese is good and they give military discount.
Pamela W.,"Vacaville, CA",7,192,63,4.0,7/13/2013,"Now I am not the biggest fan of Applebee's...mainly because we have all been told that they rarely cook their own food ( not rare....rarely, meaning it is pre-prepared.  Get it?  I once asked to have my steak medium rare and the waiter said ""Uh, they are all medium when we get them."" Ooops!  Cat is out of the bag...God, I hope it wasn't cat... OK on to my review. I stopped in by myself for a quick lunch.  I wanted to try the Wedge salad with Green Goddess dressing and bacon and pecans and blue cheese crumbles.... I was NOT disappointed!  Lettuce was fresh and cold- dressing was amazing and the bacon was REAL..  I also had a cup of the French Onion. Very good.  I love the little Ziosk stations where you can order, call the waiter, play video games, and even pay- all right at the table!  My grandkids will love this!!"
Adela L.,"Suisun City, CA",81,67,53,2.0,7/21/2014,"Behold, they no longer need to provide customer service because they now have these digital menus/pay devices at every table. We only saw our waitress maybe twice.. once to bring our drinks, and the second time to bring us waters.. which funny enough we had to use the ""Call for service"" button on the table device to remind our waitress we were still waiting on our waters.. which took like 20 minutes to get. I suppose the digital menu is neat, but it removes that personal interaction from customer service and it feels like staff doesnt want to be around customers at all. The games looked like they would be neat, but they charge for you to play them! We only ordered drinks, that were good, but I don't like the replacement of these devices, lack of customer service!"
Vicky L.,"Fairfield, CA",533,323,1868,4.0,11/12/2012,"My mom suggested to come here for lunch(Sunday, day before Veteran's day), which was odd bc she isn't a fan of American food(she's a chinese buffet aficionado). The reason--bc her friend was there & military/veterans would get a free lunch(pops is a veteran).  It was pretty busy when we got to restaurant, but we didn't have to wait bc mom's friend already had a table. Holler. The pops ordered the 7oz. steak w/ mashed potatoes & steamed veggies, mom and I ordered from the 2 for $20 section(2 full entrees +1 appy)-- Bourbon street chicken & shrimp, 3 cheese chicken penne, & spinach artichoke dip(sweet deal huh?). The spinach dip was good, but not the best I've had. The 3 cheese chicken penne was quite good with the diced tomatoes & shredded cheese, yummy. The pops really enjoyed the steak w/ the mashers, seriously--every 10 mins he was like, ""this is the best steak I've ever had...better than that Texas Roadhouse, theirs is so dry..."" then he would go back to watching the '9ers game, lol. I didn't taste the steak, but the mashers were pretty darn good(so good that I was scraping it off the plate), flavor & consistency were on point! My mom liked the chicken & shrimp dish-- she even finished the whole thing(well 85% of it..she gave me some of her chicken) I shoulda took a picture bc seeing her finish a plate at a restaurant is rare O___O(she usually eats less than half of her food & asks for a to-go box @ T. Roadhouse & then she goes and takes some of my steak fries(T___T).  Overall, this place is great. Good service, despite how busy it was, prices are reasonable(especially 2 for $20/$24 section) and the food was good. The only thing I would change is the weight of their plates--I almost snapped my wrist trying to fork my penne from a heavy plate into their unreasonably small to-go box -___x Definitely coming here again ^___^"
Tessa V.,"Fairfield, CA",23,72,79,2.0,11/15/2015,"Hostess station was unmanned for several minutes. When we were finally acknowledged, it still took awhile for us to be seated. Table was sticky. But food was as we ordered."
Jerry L.,"Suisun City, CA",23,26,2,1.0,8/31/2014,"They EARNED no stars but I guess I have to give them at least one. The wait was ridiculous and the reason given was the ""host"" didn't want to get the servers out of rotation -whatever that meant. The service was slow even though servers were standing around, texting, and moving like they were in slow motion. The food was barely edible, no flavor, and lukewarm. We had to hunt down the server to get our bill. Won't ever go back to that place.  What a waste of my dining dollars."
Jo F.,"Vacaville, CA",0,15,1,1.0,7/2/2015,"I ordered a oriental chicken salad. Have had it at Applebee's in several states and it has always been the same.  Here it came with no dressing and less lettuce than my husband's burger. It looked like I already ate it. Grilled chicken was luke warm at best and they drizzled a tiny bit of sauce on it. I asked where the actual salad was. Waitress said, ""we measure all portions and that is the right amount"". All Applebee's are different at all locations I was told. I gave it back and changed to riblets which looked gray and we're horrible. Thank goodness the fries were edible. $35 for fries. Waitress never filled water.  Had to get up and refill it myself. I won't be back. Other servers looked at our empty drinks but no way would they help out. She was not a ""server"", we had no service at all!"
Paulamertha A.,"Suisun City, CA",287,472,617,1.0,6/20/2011,"The food at Applebees is alright, it's not super delicious by any means. The servers here SUCK, at least the ones that I have. Not only does it take them forever to take your order, they aren't very attentive to their guests and won't even come back to check up on you. I waited over 10 minutes to get a refill on my drink! When the server did come back, they just dropped off my bill before I could even pay right away. It took more than 15 minutes for the server to come back to collect the payment. My party talked with the manager and he basically did nothing about it.  If you're craving Applebees, I HIGHLY suggest going to another one."
David S.,"Fairfield, CA",12,6,,1.0,8/10/2015,The servers are very slow they take your drink order 10 minutes later here comes your drink food is okay for microwave I eat burgers when I go can't mess that up I've seen people say there food is cold steaks taste like a tire my advice eat burgers only
