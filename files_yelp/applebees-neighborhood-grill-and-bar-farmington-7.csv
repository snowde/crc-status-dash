Sheri C.,"Seattle, WA",210,1826,1610,3.0,1/22/2016,"It's Applebee's.  Not much to say besides the fact it's average food and OK service.  Pretty quiet on a Saturday night, but it's a small town. Food was served quickly and no issues. Came with a friend who said her salad was good.    Food: 3 Service: 3 Parking: 4 Ambiance: 3"
Lelandra T.,"Columbus, GA",0,4,,1.0,6/21/2017,"Went here for Fathers Day, worst place to go. I've been to other Applebee's and don't have to search for the host. Mind you it was not busy at all when we went 1/2 the restaurant didn't have customers. That is not the case here, you have to search for the host or in this case the host will motion you come to her while she sits eating a basket of fries. When you are told where to sit and order an appetizer it took over 20 mins, finally we asked the waitress how long does boneless wings take to make, oh 7 mins. Well it's been over 20 minutes and no appetizer.  Then when your food arrives it wrong, ordered a full rack of ribs and only get a half rack. Asked waitress didn't I order a full rack, is this a full rack he response oh did you. I'm not sure if that is a full rack. Smh. Then blames the cooks and says oh they read the ticket wrong. Overall worst Applebees I've went to tried to make Fathers Day a special one for my Dad and this was the service we got."
Stacy M.,"Norcross, GA",0,7,2,1.0,10/19/2016,"Horrible customer service! Our Waitress was very RUDE! Took her 15m to bring me my drink, 30-45m for my appetizer an about an hour for my meal... horrible!!! Won't be coming back"
Tyrian C.,"Kirtland, NM",1,20,6,2.0,8/9/2016,"After visiting here a couple of times, service has gone down.  Waited for a table for 15mins, this was on a Tuesday afternoon, plenty of tables available!  Finally was seated, ordered a appetizer and a beer, after another 15mins, Beer was warm and had no foam whatsoever, appetizer was cold.  I asked to speak to the manager, they took 15% off my bill."
Andrew O.,"Farmington, NM",0,12,1,1.0,7/29/2015,There are a few times in life you can expect poor service or look forward to an unsatisfying meal except when at Applebee's in farmington.  Every Time we have complained we don't even get someone to help with the problem.
Jenny Lee R.,"Farmington, NM",78,23,2,3.0,7/27/2015,"Applebee's is always decent go-to place for lunch. Service is fast, food is o.k. We went for the free apps day. The siracha shrimp were great, but the churro s'mores are kind of lame."
Brandon P.,"Orangevale, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/18/2014,I took my mom to lunch yesterday and we had a horrible experience.our over priced drinks were mostly ice and the mess our drink order twice and took almost 20mins to get them.then our food was terrible and took over 30min to get us our food.I will never go back to this location.
Kristin P.,"Boulder, CO",2,10,,2.0,4/26/2012,"Made the mistake of waiting until after 9pm to go grab dinner. BAD idea in this place they call Farmington! Since nothing else was open we went to Applebee's and discovered what the bottom of a dumpster must taste (and feel) like. I ordered the shrimp and spinach salad which should be advertised as the shriveled sea turd and spinach salad. The ""shrimp"" tasted and looked like they had never been in contact with water, let alone the open ocean. The bacon dressing served with this salad was suspiciously gelatinous (like the stuff you might find congealed in the bottom of a dumpster) and didn't have an identifiable taste which had me slightly worried about my health. Nothing bad to say about the spinach...just wish it wasn't drenched in the bacon-flavored dumpster splooge. Any hopes of a cold brew making up for the meal were dashed as soon as the waitress rattled of the beer selection. Does a large portion of the population out there really drink Bud/Miller/Crappy light?!?! Whatever - to each their own. Next time I need to eat after 9, I'll save myself the trouble and wait for breakfast."
Kari D.,"Farmington, NM",30,6,4,1.0,1/6/2014,"Horrible, COLD, food!  I ordered chicken penne pasta, evidently without the chicken and enough sauce for 3 dishes. The restaurant takes zero pride in presentation or edible foods."
Derrick Z.,"Shiprock, NM",217,225,173,3.0,2/23/2012,"we have been to a couple of applebees restaurants in phoenix, arizona and they are disgusting.  crummy food and service. i cannot explain why this applebees in farmington is so much better.  the steaks, burgers, sandwiches and salads have all been great.  the service from the hostess to the servers and managers have been top notch. so way to go farmington applebees.  for the record i probably will not go to another applebees anywhere else.  lol."
Emily H.,"Phoenix, AZ",18,31,32,3.0,5/18/2012,"Tried this Applebees; not much different from Applebees in Phoenix, AZ.  There was a crowd here- karoake going (on a Friday), so a bit loud,... the waitress was not so well, she took our order and that was it- the rest of the time we were waving our arms, saying excuse me... not very friendly.  My sister's serving of fries on her order was more than that of my nephew's order on his kid's plate- lol, so we requested more fries- we got the attitude from the waitress but she did follow through on loading my sis up with more fries.  All in all an o-kay dining exprience, but nothing to shout about :)."
Applebees C.,"Gallup, NM",0,1,,1.0,7/6/2014,"Nothing more than a hangout for alcoholic servers after their shift. Staff has no idea about customer service; no idea where menus are, no idea about specials or happy hour, care more about frequents than paying customers. If you don't know the bartender and need of some suspect food, Taco Bell is next door"
