Rachel N.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,29,98,2.0,5/17/2016,"A friend and I decided to go here for lunch, it wasn't busy at all and quite. The waitress was very nice and right there... Until after we ordered, then she came back twice... We were there about an hour. Mind you it wasn't busy at all, our appetizer, cheese sticks, we're just barley warm.. Not hot but on the edge of cold. My friend didn't want me to say anything, so I didn't. Then came lunch ... The same lukewarm temperature... At this point I am very unhappy with the whole thing. My friend was afraid that if I said something, they would do something to our food if we returned it. There was no excuse, or at least non they told us, that would excuse this... Literally there was a total of about 8-10 tables of people in the whole restaurant and this waitress only have 3 of them. If I go back, I will make sure I do not get the same waitress! She didn't have time to tend to us, but when someone she knew came in, she had time to sit and talk to her and when her food came out... It was steaming... Must have been nice to have a hot lunch... I didn't know that day."
Derrick S.,"Sanford, NC",0,1,,1.0,9/17/2017,Worst place ever. Waited 20 mins for a drink. Never got a menu. Had to go to the bar and order my own drink and ask for a menu. Still haven't seen or heard from my waitress. Manager walking around. WHAT IS HE MANAGING! This is the worst.
Jajhira H.,"Prineville, OR",95,25,12,3.0,3/3/2017,I ordered Carside to Go & got the All American Burger. I arrived 15min after the suggested time since I figured service would be slow; I was right. The burger doesn't look as juicy as it does on the website. On the website the burger has condiments on the burger and seared into it. It was still good though. The woman manning the Carside to Go orders was nice but I didn't receive any condiments and wasn't asked if I wanted any. Overall the food at this location is consistently good and whenever I dine in my waitress or waiter is always nice.
Cristina M.,"Fayetteville, NC",25,24,4,1.0,8/4/2017,"Why did we even try...wanted a decent meal and there aren't many options in this area. I ordered a Caprese Chicken Salad....looked nothing like the picture. By definition, a Caprese salad is FRESH mozzarella and tomato, not cooked...the meal on my plate had a piece of rubber cheese on top of 2 slices of cooked tomatoes (so generous!), onions, overcooked chicken and mashed potatoes, drizzled with a disgusting ""balsamic"" sauce. Was this a cook who had no clue or a failure of Applebee's menu ""chefs""? I won't be returning to find out. The other food at the table was equally disappointing. And the service was poor. Waiter refilled husband's tea but not our waters, never asked how the food was, or if he could get us anything else. How is this place still open?"
Roy P.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,3,,1.0,11/20/2016,This has got to be the worst Applebee in Fayetteville NC...... I have been living in West Fayetteville for 12 years now I have gone there many times hoping that the food would change but unfortunately is still not worth eating however the staff is really nice so that is the only reason I gave it one star
Doug H.,"Banner Elk, NC",12,2,,1.0,7/31/2016,"We've been to this location a few times, once because family gives us gift cards.  It IS NOT family friendly.  The bar attracts people fit to be in some sort of joke in the wall bar on Bragg Blvd and the new music app, CrowdTunes allow people to choose whatever music they want which is also unpleasant unless you've already had too much to drink.  Highly recommend not coming here as a family. Not to mention the food and service are substandard most of the time we've been here."
Lance M.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,2,1,1.0,7/17/2016,Would give less stars if possible. Food was alright but sanitation lacked severely being that I found a dead fly in my barbecue wings. Most disgusting experience I've ever had at a restaurant.
Jane C.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,4,16,1.0,1/9/2016,Applebee's on Ramsey Street has terrible service.   The food is not good at all. When they 1st opened up it was much better but it has really turned out as a big disappointment.
Tammy K.,"Fayetteville, NC",19,58,74,2.0,6/10/2016,"Disappointed with the corporations changes with the menu.  Once again they took something off the menu I like. In addiition, increasing their prices w sale pr smaller portions."
Letycia B.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,20,,1.0,7/27/2016,"Went to the particular location over the weekend, I was not please at all with the service.  Our waitress came back once to our table and that was to bring the check, she didn't refill drinks, she didn't ask us if we needed anything ? Nothing. It was very poor service. Very disappointed and will not be returning!"
A R.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,27,24,1.0,6/23/2015,"Man oh man I've live in this area for a while and watched this Applebee's get built. I was very excited at first cause I like the restaurant. First me n my family went there to eat I don't know what it was...it's as if the workers had no training once so ever. Only the door greeter knew his/her job correctly.  The 2nd time we went the adolescent waiters didn't know what they were doing I guess one 2 drinks (including refill) is what ur expected to drink during a full meal. Waited for over 15min to get my refill. Then the food that came out wasn't cooked to order.  Normally I go by the 3x strikeout rule u 'F' up 3x your done in my book. But 2 mishaps in a row at that, was enough to seal the deal highly not recommended at all."
Henry S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",67,46,51,2.0,1/18/2015,I was seated quickly. ..a plus...the game was playing another plus. The service was okay. The salsa and chips was too salty. The food came on time. The bread sticks were hard as a block. The server did get me more. I was very disappointed
Mike K.,"Raeford, NC",0,2,,1.0,6/18/2016,I was there tonight....when did Applebee's become a black night club? They had a DJ playing nothing but rap music so load I could not wait until I got my food and get the hell out of there! I will never be back!
Martha U.,"Raeford, NC",136,32,132,3.0,11/11/2014,"I would have given 4 stars but the food here is hit and miss. The last time we came my son's quesadilla had burnt chicken in it. I'm talking about more than sear marks. Honest to goodness burnt.  Other than that the service is pretty good, they're good for kids and the foods comes out relatively quickly.  I also appreciate that they have Veteran's Day promotions. I'm always down for a free meal. :)"
Kimberly M.,"Fayetteville, NC",13,1,,1.0,7/16/2016,Don't go there !!! This place is slow and makes u wait for 30 min when no one is even in there !!! Just sad !!!
Akilia S.,"Raeford, NC",0,4,,1.0,9/27/2015,"Sorry sorry sorry. I have no idea why this store still exists. Manager John tells me my issue is ""really small"" and my refund requires a 2 week turnover. They need to write down my credit card info and fax to corporate office?  Ordered a blonde, wasn't hot, forgot the sauce. Took the manager 7 minutes to heat up new sauce. This store really sucks!"
Dawn L.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,4,,3.0,9/22/2015,We each had Thai Salad & French Onion Soup. Both were good. Just wished they had a little more lettuce with on the salad. But the desert that our waitress Hailey recommended was real good. Fresh strawberries with a little  cheesecake. More importantly our waitress Hailey was Excellent!
Trina M.,"Fayetteville, NC",1,40,61,3.0,7/8/2015,Ordered the Fiesta Lime Chicken.. DRY as a bone and hardly any flavor. Good thing there was a sauce over the top of it. The tortilla strips were stale as well. For $11.99 I expected a bigger piece of chicken then I got. Should have ordered the 3 cheese pasta. My husband had the cowboy burger and he said it was really good. I gave Applebee's 3 starts for my husband's food and our waiter Judd was really good.
Sergey F.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,5,,2.0,6/25/2015,"Nice, clean place. Service needs work...a lot of work. Good place to have dinner if you like bartenders who don't stock their bar before you order something, getting your own menus and silverware, and chasing down a waitress to get some food. The suicide music playlist adds a nice touch to the atmosphere of ""nobody gives a ****""."
Kelly H.,"Raeford, NC",0,11,,3.0,6/7/2015,"My bun was hard, but the burger tasted good. Fries tasted funny, just wasn't a good visit this time."
Robert A.,"Petersburg, VA",13,7,3,2.0,4/2/2015,"The service was great, the waiter was very insightful and helpful. However, the music was way too loud, after asking our waiter we were informed that they had already received complaints and the manager refused to turn down the music. However once another manager came on shift, she was frustrated with the previous manager and turned down the music. Food was decent enough since they keep changing their menus to keep with peoples tastes. They are trying to be a mock gastro pud."
John R.,"Raeford, NC",1,5,17,5.0,3/6/2014,Okay my meal was alright. Had a good waitress so no complaints tonight. The vegetables were very well sautéed and the chicken and shrimp were very tender. I'm here on a Thursday night at around 7: pm so this may very we'll be a great time for the crew of chiefs working.
Willie J.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,3,1,1.0,3/1/2015,This by far is the worst Applebee's I've ever been to. They made people wait 15-30 minutes to be seated when the place was less than half full. The hostess said it was because the cooks needed time to catch up. When I complained to the manager she said it's because the tables weren't clean. Looked clean to me so basically it was all BS! As slow as it was there shouldn't have been any waiting.  More to follow on the food later.
Alethea D.,"Asheville, NC",5,19,6,1.0,4/26/2014,"Hostess took her sweet time coming over after we'd been waiting 15 minutes and that was the best part of the evening. My food was uncooked and cold, when I told the waitress she tried to tell me it was cooked that way cause its precooked already and can't be cooked anymore. I said I don't want to eat uncooked pork for health concerns and she just looked confused. Manager came over and offered other food but we'd already waited thirty minutes for food in AN EMPTY RESTAURANT. So I said no. She was kind enough to CHARGE me half for the disgusting food I didn't eat. If I could give negative stars there wouldn't be enough for this horrible place."
Shelby A.,"Fayetteville, NC",3,27,20,4.0,7/16/2014,"Been to this Applebee's a few times and it was always so-so. Service is normally slow. Tonight though, Laura, our server, was spot on. Quick with refills, order was correct, cleared dirty plates quickly (a pet peeve of mine is sitting at a table full of dirty dishes and empty glasses). The food was typical Applebee's fare, but the 2 for $20 is a great deal. Had chips and queso, fiesta lime chicken (too much cheese on it) and the sirloin with fries (instead of the garlic potatoes and broccoli that normally comes with it). Had two beers from the bar and didn't have to wait long for those either. All in all, it was a good trip to Applebee's and review worthy since Laura did a great job. A competent Applebee's waitress is refreshing :)"
Jeffrey C.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,2,1,1.0,9/4/2014,This was the worst service I had ever been given. I think I would have been better off eating out of the trash can!  If you go here don't be in a rush because this is something they know not how to do!!! If I am hungry and this was the last place left open I would rather eat my toe nails before stepping foot inside this place!
Sj D.,"Raeford, NC",0,2,,1.0,10/9/2015,"Please don't bother to eat here. I promise you will be disappointed. Wait staff is the worst I've ever seen. The food is awful. As I said, you will be disappointed."
Rachel G.,"Stafford, VA",0,37,8,2.0,1/4/2014,"Yuck. Waited 20 minutes to see a waitress after being seated before finally going to find a hostess. Chips were greasy, broken, and literally only filled maybe half the plate. My Asian chicken salad was literally just lettuce and fried chicken tenders.  The manager apologized for the long wait and two beers were in the house - she's awesome and deserves a better job. Go some where else."
Jeremy P.,"Lakewood, WA",0,1,,1.0,12/29/2013,"Waited 15 minutes at car side to go and ended up calling to tell them we were outside. Brought our order out finally and brought us boneless wings instead of app sampler and forgot our milkshake. Made us give boneless wings back, had to wait for an app sampler to be made and still charged us the two dollar difference for the app sampler. All in all spent about an hour just for car side to go. I think this is the last time we go here."
Mandi J.,"Fayetteville, NC",10,4,3,4.0,10/16/2013,"The boneless hot wings here are AWESOME! They're good at remembering if I order extra sauce on the side, which I always do. Their bar is a little slow if you're at the tables-but they do make a killer cherry limeade with shaved ice. Compared to the one one Skibo Rd, this one wins every time for me!"
Tonya G.,"Raeford, NC",0,13,1,1.0,4/10/2014,"Beware!!!!  Stay clear of this gross dumpster.  I will not even call it a restaurant you have to actually get a D grade to be a restaurant.  If I could do negative stars I would.   On the night we visited I did not see the health score hanging up.  When I asked the hostess she said the frame had fallen and the grade was an A.  Skeptical, I searched the web as we sat down.  When the score came up as a ""F"", I asked the server about the score, he said he was told by management that it was due to equipment and not due to sanitation.  Our party ordered as 2 of us continued to search the web for the real answer.  Thankfully after 48 minutes we had not received our food ( exception one out of 5 got a wedge of salad with warm dressing poured on it) and my friend found out the truth.  Sanitation was a big issue!!! I won't even try to list all the issues, only to say unless you want your stomach pumped I would not even drive by that place.  We now know why there were only 6 cars in the parking lot on a Friday night.   I asked for the manager, showed him the report on the NC site, he hung his head in disbelief, asked if we wanted to eat at the other location, even called ahead so that we would not have to wait.  So we drove down the road about 7 miles to the location on Raeford Road at Harris Teeter.  They had a high B score, we got our food in 20 minutes, even though they were packed.    I've walked in this location 3 times since then, low scores each time.  Surprised the company hasn't overhauled this place."
David J.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,1,,1.0,3/11/2015,What a disappointment.   I ordered the triple Bacon burger and paid an additional 99 cents for the sweet potato fries.  It's supposed to have bacon cooked in the burger.  Not so much.  In fact it on had 2 pieces of bacon on top if the burger and some pieces underneath.   The sweet potato fries are not cooked property.   They were soggy and tasteless.   Then the dessert.  I ordered a Blondie.  It came out hot but the more we eat you could taste a burnt taste.  When got to the middle the dessert was burnt through.  My 9 year old refused to take another bit and had to spit out what was in her mouth.  Asked for a manager and he began to say that we should have asked for another dessert before we got to theat point.  I asked him what he was willing to do about it.  He said the dessert was gone and that I should have asked for him earlier.  I showed him the burnt peices and he still acted like the issue was with me and not the food.  Don't waste your time going here to eat.  You will only frustrated and hungry for good food when you leave.
Ashley D.,"Hope Mills, NC",0,7,,1.0,10/17/2015,"Worst experience I have ever had. We chose to eat here on a Saturday night. We had three small kids with us walked in the hostess told us they had a 10 minute wait. No problem. 30 minutes later she sat a party of five and a party of eight that came in after us before us. We had two adults, one child, and two high chairs. The restaurant was half full. The hostess blew us off and said the party of eight called in which the server later told us they can't make reservations so it was an excuse. Ten minutes later the manager said they were trying to figure out a table I said pick one put two high chairs at it. I was going to leave at that point but my three children were hungry and would've had a melt down. We finally are seated service is slow not due to the server he was doing his best. We finally get our food 40 minutes later and my food was full of raw onions I couldn't even eat it. I asked the server did it say in the description there would be raw onions he didn't know and came back and said they were supposed to be cooked but it wasnt in the description so the manager comped our bill right dollars. At this point my kids were beyond done, I didn't even get to eat, and two hours later we finally left with only my food comped. I have never had such a bad experience at a restaurant. Management is horrible, the assistant manager did a better job. He did not even bother to come and speak to us, apologize, or anything. The server, Shane was very nice and doing the best he could in the terrible circumstances. How are you not staffed on a Saturday night? Nothing but disrespect I would definitely not waste my money ever going there again. If I could give zero stars I would."
Dennis S.,"Fayetteville, NC",10,34,6,1.0,5/11/2011,I have yet to have a good meal here yet. Only reason I go there is for my wife. She loves the won ton tacos. That's all she will order. I hate this place.
Jessica H.,"Albuquerque, NM",41,114,26,3.0,9/3/2010,"It's your average Applebee's. Our server was sweet, but the host was MIA, so some older guy with rotten teeth seated us without silverware. The food was good, but our steaks were a little more done than we asked for. Not much else to say."
Tina D.,"Fayetteville, NC",2,9,2,1.0,2/15/2012,"This place is the worst restaurant in Fayetteville. We went there for valentines day only because we had a gift card. With plenty of tables available we had to wait 20 min to be seated. The waitress was very nice but the food was tasteless and undercooked. My steak was so undercooked blood pooled on my plate. Needless to say I spent the evening in the bathroom. We will NEVER eat there again. Stay ou of that ""neighborhood ."""
