Rich Y.,"WHITESTONE, NY",0,4,,5.0,10/16/2017,"Pleasant experience and great value. I go to this Applebee's on average once a month and usually order something in their 2 for $20 menu. It is the best value in downtown Flushing. For $20, you get one appetizer and 2 entrees plus FREE PARKING. Just parking alone is worth $3, so you're really paying 2 for $17. And they change the selection every now and then. My favorite entree is the Tilapia with marsh potatoes and garlic green bean, hope they will keep this item on the 2 for $20 in the future. And my favoirte appetizer is the spinach and artichoke dip. The seating is comfortable, ambiance is nice. Service can be hit or miss, but generally the servers are attentive and the food come quickly.  I think the business is decent there, but could be better if they can simply offer menu in Chinese, and put up a sign in their entrance saying ""Menu in Chinese available"", I can see many non-English speaking residents in Flushing won't go there just because they don't know what and how to order. Until then, it's a hidden gem in downtown Flushing to the Chinese residents there."
Petrina R.,"Brooklyn, NY",74,81,275,1.0,1/10/2018,"Applebee's in Flushing Queens is the absolute worse Applebee's I've been to thus far. I am a MAJOR foodie and I know when food has been refried or just plain old no good.  I was trying to take my babies to Mamajuana's in the area, but they opened at 4pm and my kid were starved. We waited 8 mins by the entrance door for the waiter to place me at a table, but it was so busy with it being about 10 WHOLE customers in the Applebee's. When we were finally seated the kids were absolutely silent due to hunger.  I immediately asked the waitress to please bring the Chicken Taco's and Mozzarella Sticks. They tore through that as soon as she put it on the table. Before we could finish the appetizer the lunch came out 8 mins after the appetizers. I started on my salad and was not pleased. I order the same thing all the time. How do you mess up chicken fingers cut up in a salad. My son's fries were stale but my daughters wasn't. 2 of the 4 chicken fingers on where stale. SMH!!! You get the idea! STALE, RUSHED AND ANNOYED! Advice: Go if you are a BIG fan of stale rushed, refried food."
Pamela B.,"Freeport, NY",0,2,,1.0,11/4/2017,"My debit card was kept and used to take over 1000$ out of my personal checking account.  Service was awful, food was cold and took forever!! I wrote to the manager to get some feedback and I'm yet to get a response! This is by far the worse restaurant I've ever been in... don't recommend at all...I can't stress enough how horrible this place is along with its employees."
Anna Z.,"New York, NY",37,39,10,1.0,9/29/2017,"This place is a mess even when it isn't busy. My friend and I came here to order take out and at first everything seemingly went well. After we placed our orders the waitress disappeared... for more than 15 minutes. Okay fine, food takes a while to make so I'll let it slide. Then our food came and my friend's well done burger was not well done at all. Because Of that, my friend started getting very nauseous. When it came to closing our tabs, they got our orders wrong and nearly charged me the wrong price twice! Never coming back again."
Farrah B.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,292,688,4.0,8/19/2017,"We tried this location before and it was pretty good, so when we needed a quick meal (movie time was near).  We sat at the bar and it was interesting. It smelled a little sour, from all the overflow from the taps and drinks.  Happy hour brings odd sorts in to harass bartenders after they load up on liquid courage.  Even though these guys pestered the bartenders, they were so polite and bubbly to every customer that came to the bar.  Lysette got our order in and it took a while, but it came out fresh and hot.  We were going to save some for later but it was too good to leave back. It took a while to settle the bill (closing time was prolly near), but it will not keep us from coming back."
Ven H.,"Queens, New York, NY",1010,274,1212,4.0,8/13/2016,"I came to this location for the first time because Applebee's offered a free 3 course meal with a free drink for my birthday through Applebee's e-club. This is a huge Applebee's but I feel like there isn't enough staff working there and service was kinda of slow even though I everyone was working very hard. Also, because this location is in the basement, I didn't have signal for the entire time I was there. I ordered the oreo milkshake, wings for appetizer, the salmon entrée, and the chocolate chip sundae for dessert. Everything was ok but the chocolate chip sundae was a killer. It's bigger than my main course and satisfied all of my cravings.  The whole meal was to $47 but I paid $0. Not even tax! I feel bad I couldn't pay tips because I couldn't swipe my card for a $0 bill, but huge shout out to our waitress Danika, she was awesome."
Jenn F.,"New York, NY",15,2,3,1.0,10/26/2017,The few times I've been here I've waited a very long time for someone to even approach me and today is the last time I come here. They're rude and there was a hair in our food
Umesh P.,"Flushing, NY",9,6,,1.0,11/25/2017,Very rude staffs. Bad food as well. I asked the margarita and it was all bad and I complaint about it and the server said I have to pay extra if I want another one. Simply I said no and handed over the drink to her. The waitress here name Judy is so rude and was ready to do the arguments. Later she said she didn't charge for that drink. I left the restaurant without saying
Tiffany L.,"Bath Beach, Brooklyn, NY",41,167,573,2.0,5/26/2016,"This is your typical Applebee's. The waitstaff could care less. We came in pretty late, but at least an hour before closing and the waiters were already being nasty about how we were coming in so late. Well, don't advertise being open till late if your employees are going to be disrespectful! We order the 4-cheese Mac and cheese with honey pepper chicken tenders and double glazed baby back ribs. The cheese sauce on the Mac and cheese was surprisingly ooey and stringy. It was very good. The chicken tenders were weirdly sweet due to the honey. The baby back ribs were falling off the bone but the portion size was extremely small. It had a good smoke layer and grill marks on it as well. It was served with some very unseasoned fries."
Jodi G.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",24,60,70,2.0,8/16/2017,"After we got our seats...30 mins and the waitress finally came. It's a Wednesday night..crowd is average but the service sucks!! Then when u finally get ur food. Thats it for the waitress, no check ups, nothing u don't see her again. In conclusion...just as any applebees...the service still sucks!"
Fateha A.,"Queens, NY",17,152,214,1.0,3/17/2017,I ordered a medium well steak that was too tough. I almost choked on it. It came with Mexican rice which was bitter for some reason. I basically hated everything on my plate.
Bee V.,"FLUSHING, NY",11,1,,1.0,9/11/2017,"What a horrible place.  A place that the staff doesn't care and no-one wants to work there.  When you sit at the bar, it smells like garbage.  Please don't go here."
Christianna N.,"Denver, CO",42,4,,1.0,9/16/2017,"Here on vacation and this put a damper on my night. First of all, when we got seated I had to ask someone to take our order that's how long we waited. When the food arrived I was then told they didn't have stir fry. I don't understand why they couldn't tell me before they started cooking my girlfriends food that way whatever I re ordered would've all came out together but no, they bring hers then decide to tell me. Didn't even order again, wasn't worth that wait. Horrible service. Never had to wait so long for a refill or the check. A 20 minute dinner turned into an hour of waiting minus my meal. 0 stars I'd give if possible."
Rashid M.,"New York, NY",1097,931,572,1.0,12/30/2015,"It's funny how much I used to like Applebee's as a kid, but now I hate eating here. This was my first time at this Applebee's. What I like about this location is that it's at a small mall that's not too busy, so there's always a seat available. But that's not reason enough to eat here. We ordered from the ""2 for $26"" menu, and even that is paying too much for it. Started with the boneless honey bbq wings and then had the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp. Nothing about the dish was bourbon, and everything tasted so bland. I also had the Apple Chimicheesecake for dessert, which was actually a little better than the other dishes. Our waitress looked like she couldn't wait to get out of there. She was not attentive at all. No soda refills, when new dishes were brought out old plates were left at the table, etc. Those are basics that you learn at Waiting Tables 101."
Linnie B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",28,3,,1.0,9/15/2017,"Took 15 min for waitress to come to our table.  Ordered kiddie milkshake for my 20 mnth old and she brought a huge ass glass.. said the kitchen made a mistake.  My son couldnt even hold the glass. What a joke!  Asked for a smaller glass and never received it. After the starter, someone took all the plates and clean utensils and napkins from the table. Told the manager i needed utensils when he brought my food.  10 min later I was still waiting.  At this point im so pissed off and my food all cold.  Waitress disappeared after taking my order. Food tasted nasty, steamed broccoli was all mushy. Never going back there again. Not even for free food.  Stay away and save yourself the frustration."
Mandy Z.,"Queens, Queens, NY",7,4,3,3.0,8/28/2017,"I ordered the wonton tacos like always and it tasted just as good as other places however, the service was pretty slow. I went there with a friend and we only ordered 2 things but, it took them about 30-40 minutes to give us our food. Half the restaurant was closed off and it wasn't even that busy. The waitress there also doubled as the bartender so I understand why it took her a while to give us our order. If service was faster, it would've been a more enjoyable experience"
Ikwhan W.,"Queens, NY",0,3,,1.0,7/22/2017,Omg  My food took more then 1 hour Stake was like leather  And it had some kind of smell. We could not eat most of the food. Next table got so mad they just left about 40 min later You should avoid this apple bee
Stephen L.,"Queens, NY",277,305,4473,1.0,3/1/2016,"I would have to say coming to this Applebee's was the worse restaurant experience I have ever encountered in my life and I'm sure I can speak for all the friends I went with. I will never return to this location and as a result of the service (or lack of), I have not returned to any Applebee's franchise since 2011. I came here late September 2011 to celebrate my girlfriend's (now my wife) birthday with a group of friends and coworkers.  We were a group of 15 people and made reservations two weeks in advance. Upon entering Applebee's, the table was all set up and everything was well.  The restaurant was almost empty; there were only two other tables occupied.  We were expecting service to be fast, however, it was slow and very unprofessional.  Thanks to a waitress by the name of Kimberly. Before the groups arrival, a friend prepared the birthday cake and told the waitress that the cake was a surprise.  My wife being a Pokémon fan, we ordered her a pikachu cake.  Upon ordering, what struck me was that Kimberly said there was no tap water available!  Okay, fine!  Let's assume the fountain water wasn't working.  However, 3 minutes later, the table next to us, serviced by a different waiter, was brought out some fountain/tap water?  Unbelievable!  Kimberly wanted the whole table to order drinks so by default she could get a bigger tip.  She could have told us that water was available or that the machine was fixed, but she did not. As for the pickachu cake, it happened to be somebody else's birthday at the restaurant as well.  Guess what? Kimberly and her coworkers brought the pickachu cake to the wrong table! The other table pointed out the error, and the staff blew the candles out and brought it to the back.  Upon bringing the cake to our table, different candles were in the cake and there were holes all over the pikachu cake like it got shot up by a shotgun.   Service by this restaurant was very unprofessional throughout.  If you want a horrible time, and a way to ruin a special occasion, this would be the ideal place to go.   I highly recommend that you don't come here."
Pranai R.,"New York, NY",32,57,60,2.0,9/27/2016,"Great food & love the true American culture ! But the service is way too slow & taking too much time to bring in the food. Manager is too freaking slack , shouldn't be running himself like a wait staffs when he can hire extra help to engage customers who'd had been waiting for the last 60 min to get a brunch burger & fries ? Smell somethings wrong here ? Absolutely yes.If not then well keep on waiting until U wave at them after 2 hours ! saw few people just grabbing the menu and walking to any tables. Need to fix that here."
Paula W.,"Elmhurst, NY",6,18,6,4.0,3/6/2017,Came here for lunch yesterday! Haven't been to an Applebee's in years but my friends wanted food and somewhere to watch the game so why not applebees right? Haha. I ordered the shrimp Parmesan sirloin steak with mashed potatoes and garlicky string beans. I forgot how big he portions were here. For some reason I really loved the taste of the garlicky string beans and you can never go wrong with mashed potatoes. I finished everything and I was so full and happy by the end of my meal. We stayed there for the whole game and luckily happy hour started at 4pm so my friends ordered beer after beer after beer.
Richard C.,"Flushing, NY",83,7,,4.0,7/2/2017,"It's an Applebee's people! It's not a 5 star restaurant. There's some dishes that are great. Some that are not, but ask nicely and let them know and they will help. The staff is really what sets this location apart. The food is 3+ to 4. But the staff is almost always a 5."
Estefania C.,"New York, NY",0,2,,2.0,5/14/2017,This is like any other Apple bee. The food is awesome. My complain is the service and management. I have been here twice and both times the have messed up by bring me the entree first and the the apps. I'm not sure who's fault who it is. The server complain to the manager and they gave us one of our apps for free. But other than that she never asked if we wanted water or another alcholic drink.
Meng M.,"Millburn, NJ",3,3,1,1.0,9/1/2017,"45 minutes. That's how long it took for me to walk in the door until I got my food. My very mediocre food, not just once, but three times. The service is absolutely disgraceful. Unless you got no choice to eat, which is ridiculous because you're in flushing, do not eat here. You will not have a pleasant time here."
Joe C.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",0,1,2,1.0,7/10/2016,"The food here is so small compare to other Applebee's and we think they are cheating our money, so we say DON'T COME !!!"
Hailey W.,"Flushing, NY",223,73,24,1.0,6/13/2016,"The waitress was really attentive and was able to change the channels for us so that we were able to watch the game. But my friend almost swallowed a piece of plastic from the quesadilla. So I question how sanitary their food is. Instead of offering us other food, they offered us more quesadilla. Yes I would love to eat some more of that quesadilla stuffed with plastic. Please enlighten me with more of that taste.  Initially I gave this place a 2, even after neglecting the whole plastic incidence, I looked passed it for the waitress. But this other waitress from God knows where she came from shuts the TV off and says ""I don't care if these people stay, I'm clocking out."" First of all, she could have asked nicely and informed us that she has to go home. Second of all, why the hell are you working at a restaurant if you're going to criticize customers in front of their face? She was lucky the manager wasn't there, but horrible service and disgusting food. Now I'm wondering if they substituted my chicken with rats."
Edward S.,"New York, NY",42,10,41,4.0,2/8/2016,"Applebee here was fantastic. I would definitely return with my friends. The service : FANTASTIC. The server for my table constantly returned to my table asking us if we needed any more drinks and etc. I got a sierra mist, which included free refills, he came back every time my cup was 3/4 full. Usually in the restaurants I go to, I have to request the server to refill my cup for me, so having a server come up towards me without me asking is definitely a great thing.  10/10 service The cleanliness: My table was extremely clean, I had no problems with it. The restaurant was full and packed, so it was hard to speculate for the whole restaurant, but looking at how fast the servers worked to clean the tables that needed cleaning, I would say the cleanliness of the place was pretty good. 9/10 Cleanliness The food: I loved the food I got, Shrimp Linguine, and Honey BBQ Bone in wings. The quality of the food was okay, nothing special. I enjoyed my food and have no bad reviews about it. It's not those restaurants that you expect 5 star quality. 7/10 Food"
John C.,"Flushing, NY",708,107,427,1.0,9/24/2016,"Why would you go to Applebee's in Flushing Queens when there are so many delicious alternatives?  Flushing, Queens is the most dynamic and diverse community on the United States and home to foodie heaven.  Why should we tolerate deception marketing, bad food, and poor service from chain stores like Applebee's?  Unfortunately, that's what we found at the Flushing Applebee's restaurant when we visited and found that our orders did not conform to unwritten rules for Happy Hour specials. The wait staff didn't explain these rules and charged us the higher prices. They didn't apologize or offer to validate our parking."
TylerRose A.,"SUNNYSIDE, NY",29,26,16,5.0,6/17/2016,"June 17, 2016 -- We were a party of four, taking my daughter out after her 8th Grade Graduation ceremony. I'm so glad we came to this location. While others found the restrooms, I explained my daughter's special order onion soup to our waiter (James) and that we were celebrating.  He told me they'd do a dessert and sing for her at the end. I didn't have to ask him to bring it. They showed up at the table at the appropriate time and sang for her and she was just delighted.  She loves the onion soup, and asks them to make it with just the cheese and the broth. They do it for her no problem. I had the 12 oz sirloin, rare, with broccoli and green beans. It was cooked perfectly (broccoli is always overcooked, but I can live with that). I also had a red apple sangria, which was very tasty. James (who I called Josh at one point, but he was gracious and overlooked it) was attentive without being too pushy. He's very good. Some people you can tell should not be wait staff. Others excel at it. He excels.  Our thanks to him and the rest of the staff for a great visit. The soup was perfect. She said she didn't find even a single piece of onion. The steak was terrific and perfectly cooked. We are going to make a point of coming back to explore the mall and dine again."
Mr F G And Ms M S.,"Flushing, NY",662,1038,3988,4.0,1/26/2016,We were here for dinner on a Monday night. The food here is good but nothing special. It taste just like any other Applebee's out there. 3 stars for the food & an extra 1 more star for the service. The service was great. Our waiter were very polite & attentive. We would most likely go back again.
Emily O.,"Queens, NY",35,146,180,3.0,2/26/2016,It's really hard to review chain restaurants. Not every chain are the same. But as a general rule i stick to what that chain restaurant is good for. That way nothing can go wrong. I usually  order burgers from applebee. They are a good size and semi filing. Although they are more expensive than fast food burgers. Wish they have more fries to the burger. Service is decent. I barely see my waitress which is something i am not surprise about. This location isn't pack at anytime so wait time is almost nonexistence. But this restaurant is one of the only few American cuisine in flushing. That is something i am happy about.
Patricia C.,"Queens, NY",161,742,3545,4.0,1/6/2015,"No more Five Guys in SkyView Center, so we ended up here.. Good choice of ours 'cause we really enjoyed the food. We opt in for the 2 for $26 pre-fix menu, which includes 1 appetizer and 2 entries! --- Boneless Wings with Buffalo Sauce (Lightly breaded, tender chunks of boneless chicken with your choice of sauce) --- Sizzling Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp (Cajun-seasoned chicken breast grilled and served on a sizzling skillet with blackened seasoned shrimp, garlic and thyme. Served with fried red potatoes and sauteed onions & mushrooms.) --- Fiesta Lime Chicken (Grilled chicken done fiesta-style with zesty lime sauce, Mexi-ranch and jack cheddar cheese. Served with crisp tortilla strips, seasoned rice and freshly made pico de gallo.) DELICIOUS MEAL FROM START TO FINISH!  Best deal ever! Totally fulfilling and satisfying dinner. Maybe it was a good thing we didn't get Five Guys lol"
Melwin D.,"Edison, NJ",18,7,2,5.0,2/29/2016,Very clean restaurant. Party of two food was worth the money. Enrique the waiter was great kept coming to ask if we need anything we love the food is amazing  we will be back soon
Anton C.,"New York, NY",30,1,,1.0,3/10/2016,"Horrible. I was there a couple of weeks ago with my baseball teammates to have a nice dinner. It was good until I got my check and while I was supposed to get 10 dollars in change (with the tip), the waiter gave me 5 dollars back. My teammate addressed it and said he thought I was paying with the tip. I told him I did and I showed him the total price on the receipt and the price with a 20% tip. He tried to tell some bullshit that it was tax, but I noticed that it was actually the tip. He then said ""Well its up to you if you want to give the tip"" and gave me the 5 dollars he took from me. Not only did he try to make me look bad around people that I have respect for, he tried to scam me. I think his name was Kevin or Devin, I really don't remember."
Adriana P.,"Ozone Park, Queens, NY",48,128,210,4.0,12/15/2014,"Typical Applebee's.  We were seated immediately and had a very friendly server.  Food was cooked perfectly and we didn't have to wait long.  After 7 hours of shopping at Skyview mall, we so needed our bellies to be full and a good drink.. they brought our margaritas in martini glasses though. The bartender made up for it by giving us a glass full of olives at no charge.  Bathroom could have been a little cleaner but definitely useable."
Elena S.,"East Rutherford, NJ",37,17,3,1.0,10/23/2016,"The waiter took forever every time we called him, the bathrooms were dirty and didn't have paper.. food was not that great.. this Applebee's does not meet the franchise standards."
Andrew K.,"Rego Park, NY",158,27,76,1.0,11/8/2015,"I've always hated Applebee's only cause I don't think their food is good and their service always tends to suck regardless of which one I go to. I thought I would just mention that the food tastes like it was microwaved and I actually can't believe they can sell that stuff and call it food.  The service was ok I guess. I've definitely gotten better service elsewhere. We placed an order and they forgot certain specific things we mentioned. But that's not a huge deal anyway cause whether they got it right or not the food will probably be equally bad.  They have somewhat a decent list of beer and they have a lot of seating (maybe due to the fact that not too many people go). I guess the only thing going for them.  Not my recommendation. If you're in this area, why not go for some authentic chinese food down on Main Street. Cheaper, better, and local (support local businesses!)"
Daniela G.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",112,144,144,3.0,11/21/2015,"So despite a few of the reviews, I decided to be a rebel & try this Applebee's. To be honest it was not bad at all.   I ordered the 4 cheese Mac n cheese & my boyfriend ordered the brisket enchiladas. We also got salsa verde nachos as an appetizer. The quality of the food wasn't bad but not amazing either. It was tasteful but some things like the rice were a bit stale. The nachos on the other hand were simply perfect. Right amount of everything. My Mac n cheese was really good. Very cheesy but I didn't really taste 4 cheeses, more like 1.     The service was pretty good considering its a Friday @ 9pm. It was pretty busy. The cool thing is that they got these new tablet things were you can place orders, drinks, play games with your friends or date while you wait for your meal. So in a way it makes the wait time enjoyable. The waitress was sweet & very attentive. I guess this place has its good days :)"
Bin L.,"East Elmhurst, NY",29,337,14,5.0,1/3/2016,"Came here yesterday. Ordered the one apptizer, two main dishes $26 plan and a separate dish. We had buffalao chicken wings, a 9 oz. sirloin steak, and shrimp cocktail. The separate dish is garlic-crusted sirloin steak. Both steaks were grilled medium rare. Parking was a nightmare."
Jeremy S.,"Pasadena, CA",153,525,9,3.0,7/23/2016,I went here for happy hour food. I wasnt expecting good service. The bartender was pretty attentive though even though she seemed to have a lot of tables. Select appetizers are half off and I got the nachos. They were huge and pretty good. It is a little too oily and rich though. Get it with a side of salsa.
Elizabeth T.,"Whitestone, NY",212,86,169,3.0,1/1/2016,This Applebee's is pretty standard. Solid food. They have happy hour specials with half off appetizers. They have a large variety of food dishes.
