Y H.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",0,21,43,1.0,10/29/2013,Food was absolutely terrible. Ordered the chicken tortilla soup and 4 cheese Mac. Soup was worse than from the can. Four cheese Mac was drenched in oil and maple syrup. Never going back to this location.  Giving 1 star for the nice hostess.
Eunice C.,"Brooklyn, NY",111,46,44,3.0,12/4/2015,"We came here for a quick dinner after shopping at the Skyview mall. Despite it not being crowded the services was very slow. I am not a big fan of applebees as their food is not very fresh and does takes processed or microwaved at times. My husband and I got the 2 for 26$ combo. I ordered the chicken and shrimp with the mashed potatoes and he got the 9oz steak with sweet potato fries and veggies, there is a $1 surcharge for the sweet potato fries. My son got the kids meal mini burgers, which should be called extra mini burgers, that are even to small for a little boy. Barely any burger to the tiny bun, this came with your choice of side. He got the french fries and the mozzarella sticks. For some reason the fries here always taste like they have been fried with fish or seafood. I am not sure if it is because they might fry it in the same oil. The food was very salty and oily especially my chicken breast.  I am allergic to shrimp but asked for this on the side for my husband to eat since I could not substitute the shrimp for something else and there were limited chicken options on the 2 for 26 menu. Our waiter tried to be nice, but he was just too slow.... It took him about 15 minutes to get us silverware after our appetizers (caesar salads) came. Our salads literally came with like 2 croutons.  We asked for a few more since this is the essence of a caesar salad and it took him like 20 minutes to come back with them this was after our entrees were already half eaten and salad almost done.  He kept messing up our orders to. I asked for water with lemon and he kept forgetting. Overall for their price I think they can do better and offer healthier options. Also better kids options."
April F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",277,149,291,3.0,9/12/2014,Really great staff here. Very personable and attentive. The bartenders are really great too!!! Very friendly and nice. Great lil spot to grab lunch solo after shopping in the mall. The grilled cheese and tomato soup combo is awesome especially when it's freezing outside. Highly recommend!
Rose R.,"Flushing, NY",0,14,9,1.0,1/31/2016,Worse Applebee's location I've ever been to. Our waiter was extremely unfriendly and rude. Had to ask several workers for our drinks before he decided to bring them to us. Food was terrible.
Joyce K.,"Flushing, NY",11,55,4,3.0,11/10/2014,"Let's be honest, I'm really here for the booze (with food, of course). For the most part, my friends and I have never had any problems with service quality, we even had an awesomely nice bartender the last couple of times. The food is about what you'd expect from a chain like this one. No surprises here."
John E.,"Flushing, NY",68,97,213,2.0,9/1/2013,"Two stars too generous! Very clean location due to recent opening. They seem to be getting cheap on their food quality, however service was very professional."
Freddy Y.,"Mayfair, Philadelphia, PA",2,1,,5.0,9/11/2014,First off I wanna say I'm not a big writing reviews type of guy but this is for sure an exception! This Applebee's is pretty well staffed and a good environment as well. I never had to wait for a table when I was in town and the staff are very friendly. My waiter I had for two nights goes by the name Pete and Pete gave excellent recommendations to try and that's hard for a guy who keeps it simple and doesn't like to go outside the box and Pete was able to do that for me. He has a great personality and always there when you need a waiter to be. I'm only writing this review in regards to my excellent service from Pete! If you happen to visit this location ask for Pete and you for sure won't regret it!  Pete made me feel like a New York local.
Jenny H.,"Flushing, NY",22,27,87,3.0,4/20/2014,"I came here not long ago and got the 2 for $26 deal . I order a appetizer , the nachos and it was delicious !!! The pasta was good , overall it's tasty . But we had to ask if we could order which was unusual. The waiters past by our tables and none told us if we were ready to eat . And most had the check thing on the inside of there pants which was nasty . The customer service here is horrible !"
Ange M.,"ELMHURST, NY",0,12,,2.0,11/15/2014,"I've have been here very few times but there are too many poor experiences here. Will not be returning after last visit. One time the ceiling began to leak as i sat at the bar and no one told me as the water was leaking right behind me. The last time i went the waitress did not know what was in a sandwich I was asking about. I told her i don't eat pork so i would like to know. She responded with ""I don't really know what's in the food. But i'm sure it has tomatoes and lettuce."" When the sandwich came, there was bacon in the sandwich and had to send it back and re-order. One waiter there is really nice, his name is John"
TK M.,"Elmhurst, NY",0,8,34,3.0,5/17/2013,"first time at a Applebees Good food and quick services. went at noon, pretty empty. order by 12:10. app arrived ten min later and  Entrees 20 min after., the place got pack but still got a Baked Desserts  12 min  after  ordering which was after finishing our Entrees.    ordered Boneless Wings -  tender and nicely cook. tasty sauce,  very good A+ Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp - too Cajun for my taste, chicken tasted burned but the blackened seasoned shrimp, garlic, thyme and sauteed onions & mushrooms. was really good. however, the fried red potatoes were too dry. small portion. over all C- Fiesta Lime Chicken -  Chicken was good, the lime and the cheese brought out the taste nicely. however the rice it came with seem old and it was cold.  small portion  B- Blue Ribbon Brownie - very good. however it is rich and heavy but, but worth it. A+ the service was fast and the two staff members i interactive with were very nice. will go back."
Jeff S.,"Flushing, NY",108,6,3,2.0,8/11/2014,"I generally like Applebee's so today I ordered their take out service. I ordered a chicken tortilla soup and a tomato basil soup, an appetizer sampler and a side of mashed potatoes. I don't know if the quality of the food differs THAT drastically from dining in and taking out but when I got home the food just didn't even seem like it was anything on the menu. Maybe it's just this Applebee's but the soups did not even have a soup texture. the tomato basil soup looks like tomato sauce out of a can  with bread in it and the chicken tortilla soup looked like a chunk of soggy mixed ingredients that overall just shouldn't even be considered a soup. The sampler was ok but it seems like they skimped the portions being that it was taken out. I never had this kind of food provided to me when I dined there so it's just disappointing to see that their quality isn't as good when taking out."
Alexander W.,"Flushing, NY",0,1,,1.0,8/6/2014,"I enjoy apple bee's appetizers + drinks- although it does get worse every time. Today, my medium rare steak was one of the wellest done steaks i've ever eaten. The unsweetened iced tea was the first cup i never asked for a refill for at any restaurant. The homestyle mashed potatoes was the blandest i've ever tasted- on par with hungryman frozen dinners. The only reason I ever come is its the only American-style food in flushing where i can get drinks,appetizers, and sometimes hope for something decent. If there was ever a ruby tuesday in flushing, i'd never go to applebees again."
Johnny C.,"Elmhurst, NY",1,22,,2.0,10/13/2011,"I think this Applebees will be better situated near a high school. That's what most of their staff look like...but the type that are either irresponsible or just don't care. Yea, their staff is young/dynamic...if you want to go there...but they don't know what their doing...my gf and I sat at the table for 20 mins before even being recognized by a  waiter/waitress...(I was able to watch 1 and half innings of baseball playoffs with the Cardinals on)  thank god our conversation masked the time.  But there were at least 8 waiter/waitress roaming around to a NOT FULL restaurant on a Friday night. Thus explaining the ""ease of getting a table""...just because it's easy, doesn't mean it's good...it may have to do largely the fact that people don't go there.  Which was bizarre, because, even with the restaurant not full, 8 waiters/waitresses on hand, we still had to wait 20 mins to get served. Now, to rip one on the girl that served us.   Fine, we can see you didn't want to serve us...(20 min wait).  Maybe you got ripped by a coworker saying ""hello, they been there for 20 min, that's your line"" OR WHATEVER THE CASE...make pretend you care...service with a smile right?  Nope...our waitress was one of the prettier ones, I'll say that...blonde, about 5'7"", white.  But talk about a very ""Surrogate"" character (the Bruce Willis movie)....she was like an uncontrolled stiff robot. And the appetizers should come before the entree right? Nope, not here, my entree was first, then the appetizer next. They should either fire the staff, or get rid of the restaurant altogether. Other Applebee's far out perform this poor excuse for a AB chain."
Carlos Z.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",0,3,,1.0,7/28/2015,"Where do I begin? Forget about enjoying a quiet meal with your family, this place has music playing as loud as a nightclub. The pictures on the menu are deceiving: we ordered a salmon with vegetables, and the salmon was tiny and overcooked, also the vegetables were clearly microwaved and not fresh at all. Very little food in a huge plate for the amount it costs. The tortillas we ordered were very greasy and tasteless. Just a terrible place to dine."
Christine B.,"Bowie, MD",76,92,47,2.0,2/8/2015,"Upon arrival to be seated, we noticed that the restaurant was pretty empty, so it was the assumption that we would get good fast service, however we were wrong. After waiting almost 10 minutes to be greeted by our server ( Fi-Fi), she appeared to be somewhat u knowledgable of the drink selections. She left our table to retrieve our drinks however it took her a much longer time that was thought to be necessary, only to find out she was Taking food orders from two tables that had just. Been seated. While we waited for her to return, she finally came back to get our order. I asked for ""extra crispy"" bacon on my BLT, to which she interpreted as ""extra bacon"", of which she continued used to tell me that ""extra bacon"" is what I asked for. After I asked her to correct my sandwich, she stated that a manager would come and resolve the situation, however a manager never arrived to our table. Instead of bringing me another sandwich, she brought me three pieces of bacon. Fi-Fi did not return to the table to check to see if we needed anything, but we were able to track down the manager, who resolved our issues with the service and removed my order from the bill. needless to say, if you have to visit this Applebee's, make sure you don't get Fi-Fi- and be prepared to wait. The rest of our food was good.. It's a shame that the service wasn't better."
Mei T.,"Whitestone, NY",13,111,200,2.0,5/16/2012,"Lively atmosphere. Cool martini for mother's day!  2 for 20 or 2 for 26 specials. Decent deals.  My only problem was the table was sticky, I did not get my order.  It was  10 mins later than the rest of my table.  Come on I had to ask - you see me sitting there waiting ans waiting,  You would have thought someone would chk.   We asked for a Strawberry drink and we get cherry but the servers said its the right one.  What is going on?  The place was not crowded so you cant blame it on that. I have had much better and correct service from this place."
Kristin G.,"Port Washington, NY",1,11,1,1.0,3/26/2015,"I got so sick after eating the brisket nachos , all of our food was luke warm . I told the server I didn't like the nachos because it was piled backwards with everything under at the bottom I had 4 bites gave it back and she had the nerve not to take it off my bill. I was in the bathroom for 2 days on both ends its was terrible I'll never eat at an Applebee's again."
Christina P.,"New York, NY",0,3,,1.0,6/16/2015,My coworkers and I went to have late dinner at this location and our server Michael was not the best in custoner service. We couldnt hear him when he asked us for drinks he seemed as if he was mumbling. As we got our check and split the payment with diffrebt payment method he stayed that we calculated wrong and told my coworker that one of us should have done the math better than she did. He sure was not mumbling about that and the other thing is that nkrmally tou woukd leave a 15 -20% tip however the recipet auggested what type of percent to leave. He sure did not deserve our 20% tip and also what reataurant suggests the percentage i leaving a tip. Not great and food was not great as well. Dont come here.
L H.,"Mineola, NY",4,28,10,2.0,1/16/2012,"Pros: -Your typical applebees menu, with Flushing-friendly decor. -abundance of servers -they play all types of sports games and the bar is a great place to watch.  -good happy hour while the games are on! Cons:  -Not your typical service, rather lack there of. There are too many servers (for such an empty house) but I can never seem to get decent service i.e. getting water or drinks on time, food takes too long and arrives lukewarm, all while the servers are hanging out in the corner laughing at their own jokes, etc, etc. I've only come here to watch games when I've been too lazy to go out to the city, or when I was craving for some fatty American food in Flushing.  However, I always leave this place with a bitter taste in my mouth. Service is just downright subpar and unprofessional -- even for a chain restaurant. The only thing I recommend is the bar for happy hour during game nights.  Needless to say, I wont be going back and have not since summer '11."
