Eszee R.,"Jamaica Estates, Queens, NY",53,169,61,5.0,11/25/2011,"Shout Out to my fave Bartender Jeanice (don't know if I spelled her name right)...she's super friendly and makes great drinks... I don't usually like these chain restaurants...but this was close to my house and they have Happy Hour every weekday...idk what everyone else is talking about, cause I came here with my friends soooooo many times throughout the summer...the drinks were GREAT, the food comes out pretty quick, the place is SPOTLESS...I don't really have anything bad to say about this place... Ill update if anything goes wrong..."
Sandra R.,"BAYSIDE, NY",2,35,18,1.0,1/10/2014,"The worst Applebee's we have been to! We called in to check if we can sit at booth near the bar for happy hour because our friend got a kid with them and they said yes. Once we got there, they told us we can't. And the manager was rude, food was bad and took a long time. It's pretty empty. We go to the one in Fresh Meadow now."
Lyss C.,"Elmhurst, NY",92,90,39,1.0,4/19/2013,"Came  here  for happy hour on friday around 6pm. pretty busy at  the  bar.  the  place  had a musty smell  that  we  couldn't  identify.  these  two  girls  were  bartending,  one  of  them  named jannice or something.  Well  both  of  them  seemed to adhere  to a  policy   of serving  all alcoholic drinks  first  then  other  orders.  My group  was  the  first to  order,  and  we  ordered  waters n  sodas.  for  some  reason  the beer orders  came  first,  then  no soda or water. waited about 15-20min  while  we  watched  them  take  other beer orders...AND serve  them...then  after  an  eternity  she (jannice)  blithely  came  by  with  the  sodas n  waters, with not  even  with  an  apology  that it took  forever  to  come.  If *I*  was  the  bartender,  I  would serve  whoever ordered  first,  NOT according to  what  type of drink  was  ordered  first.  this  happened a second  time  awhile  later,   turning  away  the order AWAY and saying WHY  because  it  took too  long.  RIDICULOUS.   but I didn't.  NEXT TIME i will.  No doubt. Then  again wtf  do  we  expect  from  an applebees  and  the ppl  whom  they  employ  anyway, right?  not  much,  that's  for  sure. ha. fyi, this  place  is  falling  apart.  while  we  were  at  the  bar,  the  ceiling sprung a  leak  and pieces fell. lol. we  walked  out  after  the second leak sprung. lol... i wouldn't make this a PRIME spot to hang out.  pshh."
Celisa C.,"Queens, NY",149,72,319,2.0,1/3/2013,2 stars only cause they have decent service. The Cajun shrimp fettuccine gave me an on and off tummy ache and there was a lack of sauce. Just a small dollop for all that pasta. The spice was pretty on point. The manager kept pushing on the new energy drink that they feature but I uncomfortably kind of dismissed the suggestion even after explain that I wasn't in the mood for an energy drink based cocktail. So I ordered a kiwi bulldog that was recommended and it didn't taste like kiwi. It was so watered down and barely even green like the mix should be. Blah. I feel like Applebees has such a bad rep and for reason.
Sue B.,"Queens, NY",171,56,5,1.0,6/21/2012,"Just wanted to watch the game. The place was literally almost empty and they just didn't seat us-- 2 people. We waited 20 minutes. We were just sitting there with the hostesses right in front of us with rows of empty tables everywhere. Just when I was about to complain and asked my boyfriend if we could leave I guess the hostess got the message and gave us a table that was clear the whole entire time. When a waiter finally got to us, he took our order without even asking what we would like to drink... Seriously? We got out of there as soon as we could to watch the game somewhere else. What a waste of time."
Jane S.,"Plainville, CT",0,4,,1.0,5/29/2012,"I had dinner here last summer, and my dissatisfaction is still fresh enough to warrant a review. My boyfriend and I came here at dinner time, and it was practically empty. Normally, when I go to an Applebees at dinnertime, I'd be waiting around for a few minutes because the tables are full. However, at this place, my boyfriend and I were waiting for one of the no-brain waiters/waitresses to stop chitchatting with each other long enough to seat us. When we were finally seated, it took a good 15 minutes for someone to even bring us a menu. Perhaps because the place was so empty that the workers didn't even realize they had customers? Still, unbelievable. I mean, I had to flag someone down to get a stinkin' menu. Some tall, lanky, geeky-looking guy was our waiter. He disappeared after giving us the menu. I swear, we waited a good 15+ minutes and this guy was nowhere to be found. I had to flag down some other guy who happened to walk by. He turned out to be a manager or something rather. He was nice enough; he apologized for the poor service, personally took our orders, and called over the lump that was our waiter and scolded him a bit. That was probably the only good part of this dinner. I had ordered a sandwich, and it took, no joke, nearly an HOUR for it to come out. When we had managed to get a hold of the waiter, he make some bullshit explanation that we had to give my order extra time to make. That made absolutely no sense whatsoever, because my boyfriend had ordered a burger, which actually considers cooking, and he got it before my order, which requires absolutely no cooking whatsoever. The waiter never bothered to stop by our table to see if we needed more water or anything. Nope, he completely disappeared until we needed our check. Then of course, he took his sweet time with my boyfriend's credit card. You can believe that we left him zero tip. My boyfriend, however, did leave him a nice little love note on the receipt."
Karen H.,"Corona, NY",60,60,9,1.0,5/10/2013,"The first time i came became the last time. I came here with 5 othersfriends the food wasnt well prepare my friend's fillet was over cook, my dish was very salty i could hardly eat it, fries were very soggy and smushi. The service was very slow. Would definately not come back to this place."
GREG F.,"Flushing, NY",0,2,,3.0,1/2/2014,"Hello, This is the second Applebees that I have been to. I had a 9oz steak with mash potatoes and a side order of broccoli. I ordered the steak medium and that is how it was made. The steak was good and the broccoli was ok as well.  My only little problem was that the mash potatoes was not too hot. As opposed to a good deal of people who eat at Applebees my wait times was not long."
JacksonLee K.,"Manhattan, NY",71,82,453,5.0,2/12/2013,"This is a cool place, service was very nice & quiet... And those foods are delicious...I like this place a lot... :)"
Jeff J.,"Queens, NY",0,8,,1.0,9/25/2012,"I'm done with Applebee's, too many misses and few hits. This is the 4th chain I've visited and it will be my last. I visited this Applebee's 2 days ago with a co-worker and everything seem to be headed towards a 4 star rating until we were rushed out without finishing our food. Some old fast talking Italian guy ( I guess he was the manager) convinced us that we were finished and quickly took our plates away which still had food on them. We felt as if we were apart of a mafia shake down. The place wasn't crowded, it was only about 6pm in the evening, we've only been eating for about 20 minutes. There must be a eating time limit at this location. When the bill arrived we only left a 79 cent tip only because we couldn't break the dollar."
Leila Y.,"Woodside, NY",9,173,101,3.0,1/25/2013,"The Applebees has improved since the last time I been here. My friend told me that they changed the chef. I came here with my stepsister and a friend, we ordered the Three-Cheese Chicken Penne, Southwest Shrimp Fettuccine, Spinach & Artichoke Dip, and the Ultimate Trios which include the Chicken Wonton Tacos, Mozzarella Sticks, and Steak Quesadilla Towers. Everything was really good. Even though they said that the Southwest Shrimp Fettuccine was spicy, it wasn't spicy at all. I really like the Chicken Wonton Tacos, it had a sweet and sour sauce on top. I thought the steak in the Steak Quesadilla was a little hard. But overall the food and service isn't bad."
Edwin D.,"New York, NY",62,11,21,5.0,8/18/2011,"Staff was awesome, and I got to enjoy my baseball game like a king! GREAT DRINKS by the way!"
Chris P.,"Flushing, NY",28,117,15,1.0,11/16/2012,"Massive space, over priced and understaffed, considering the great food available in the area, this should be a last resort."
Sasha R.,"Flushing, NY",0,2,,1.0,6/1/2013,"The few times I have ate at this location the food has been horrible. During my visit today I was first handed a cold soup and when I complained that the soup was completely cold another server returned with a hot soup that looked like a paste. When I politely asked one the hosts if the soup usually looks like that she brushed me off and said yes that was how the ""soup"" is and walked away.  I waited for my server to return and be removed the soup off of our bill. Still hungry I waited patiently for my entree ( portebello mushroom chicken) only to receive a hot plate with cold food on it. The mushrooms and onions were burned, there were 3 dry potatoes, and the chicken was burnt and cold. Having worked In the restaurant business before I know the pressure that the kitchen feels during busy hours but I just find it completely unacceptable that they would send cold and burnt food to a guest that is paying for a good meal. I will not make the mistake of eating at this establishment again. Between the unhappy servers and hosts and the horrible food I'm surprised this establishment is still open."
Nishia D.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,24,9,1.0,11/17/2012,The hostess joked a little too much to the point we felt awkward. The waiter is the worst I've ever had. Forgot to put in a part of our order. Took long to bring items such as napkins and hot water and even a straw although he brought out the drinks! The food was disgusting....bland and lukewarm. Did I forget to mention my booth seat fell off when I moved forward to eat? Yes we know this a chain restaurant but I've been to enough of them to know what the service should be like.
Jameson C.,"Flushing, NY",301,47,26,1.0,8/28/2013,"I wish I could give negative stars, or atleast 0 stars. This place is HORRIBLE. Came here a few times sadly because I was lazy. Service was HORRIBLE every single time. The staff is lazy and incompetent, the host brought us to 3 different tables because she didnt know where to seat us according to her book. The waiters and waitresses take 20 minutes just to greet you and give you beverages. The food was disgusting, i got the shrimp fettuccine that came out hard and the sauce tasted spoiled. I asked for a new one and they gave me the same one back with a few new strands of noodle. I've been to other applebees and NONE of them are this bad or bad at all. This place needs a serious change, i cant believe people still go here. I hate this place, even after giving it so many chances they get worse. I highly recommend not going here, EVER. Save your time and money. This place is the worst of the worst."
T C.,"Floral Park, NY",0,75,,1.0,5/10/2013,"Bad. 1.  You can't get cell phone service in the building. 2.  On the night I went, the barmaids took 10 minutes to even know I was sitting at the bar. 3. Even though the place is a quarter mile away from CitiField, and despite the fact that the barmaids were wearing Mets shirts, they could not figure out what station was carrying the Mets game. 4.  Barmaids did not even bother to wipe down the bar where I was sitting. There were crumbs from previous customers all over the bar. 5.  In their defense, they are understaffed, but it still doesn't detract from the fact that this place sucks."
Kheng C.,"White Plains, NY",0,15,,1.0,10/23/2012,"Change all waiting and kitchen staffs please. Worst pasta dish i ever had. It was cold, lumpy, bland, didnt really care about small portion since it tasted so bad. Imagine cooking pasta in hot boiling water then serve with no sauce or even olive oil in it. Seriously Applebees has been a disapppintment regardless the location but this is the rock bottom. Reinventing menu wont do any good if quality suxs."
Ben C.,"Tappan, NY",102,295,1463,4.0,4/18/2012,"this place was pretty good with free 3hr parking. i ordered the lunch special basil tomato soup and fried chicken salad. im usually not a salad person but the use of fried chicken was interesting.even our hostess melissa was very friendly, helpful and entertaining.i enjoyed watching the 5-6 televisions and caught up with the rangers playoff. a pretty decent bar and the decor was queens theme-like including a dancing dragon hanging from ceiling. i would recommend."
Jane M.,"Flushing, NY",2,11,2,1.0,5/26/2014,"Extremely dissatisfying, disappointing and upsetting food as well as service. Upon being seated, two different servers came and told us that they were going to be our server tonight. Ok.. So one one of the waiters takes our order and comes back with pitiful looking and completely different dishes. My bf ordered a chicken sandwich and instead got chicken with rice. Don't know where in the order the server got that jumbled up. Then, my medium rare steak came back almost well done and it was so tough to chew that I didn't even finish it- not to mention baked potatoes instead of mashed potatoes, of which the texture was as if they didn't even cook it. Then as I was finishing up dessert, two other servers came and asked me if they could take my plate away WHILE I STILL HAD A SPOONFUL OF ICE CREAM STILL IN MY FACE. Needless to say it was definitely a mistake coming here and I do not make the same mistakes twice. Goodbye forever, Applebee's. You were a good friend in middle school."
