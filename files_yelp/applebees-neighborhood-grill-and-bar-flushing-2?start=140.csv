Kristine V.,"FRESH MEADOWS, NY",13,12,25,4.0,7/3/2012,"I'll give this place  a 4 out of 5 for now as they have been consistent with the friendly service, food comes on time and is on point with the quality. Always get a voucher at the end of my meal and again, staff is friendly. They could do a better job cleaning the rest rooms as it smells."
Jacqueline L.,"FLUSHING, NY",182,73,21,1.0,8/11/2013,bad. just terrible. service is horrible. servers are not attentive at all. my friend asked to change the channel to a basketball game and they waiter never got to it until we called for the check. Their food isnt great either. their spinach artichoke dip had chunks in it and the chips were broken. the place is too dark for my liking and they dont clean the tables until they have a customer to seat there so there are dirty napkins and left over food sitting at almost every table
Kara T.,"Albuquerque, NM",50,195,124,2.0,10/31/2011,"I really want to give Applebee's better than two stars but I just can't bring myself to make it happen. The kitchen is slow the waiters seem uninterested and the food is only mediocre. Well it is an Applebee's after all but I've had much better in my day. The location is great. Situated in the same building as a Target, Bed Bath and Beyond, Old Navy and Best Buy it's nice to be able to grab a bite to eat while shopping. I just really wish the 4 times I've been there I could have walked away with one good memory."

Cindy G.,"BAYSIDE HILLS, NY",0,1,,1.0,7/2/2012,"This hot summer, lazy to cook at home on Sunday night.  Taking out 3 kids  crying for hunger. We went to Applebees. Typical American restaurant.  We have the worst experiences with THE WORST SERVICES. No waters, No waiter or waitress.  and the hosts are terrible manners..  no services for 20 minutes. and take forever to get the check.  We paid $100 foods tastes like garbage. SUCKS!!! the worst place!!! NEVER going back."
Anny N.,"Queens, NY",0,22,,1.0,11/16/2012,"Worst Apple!bee's in Queens. WORST! Worst service, worst food, worst everything. Its sad because the manager really works quite hard but none of the servers (or cooks) really care. The one in Queens Center is a million times better. In this restaurant I have: 1. gotten my chicken breast burned (the manager gave us free dessert so there's that at least) 2. waited 20 hours for service 3. had a hair in my salad 4. have been served a cold soup. all the servers suck!!! the tall white guy, short black girl, ALL OF THEM!!! The girl that opens the door is nice."
T N.,"New York, NY",3,43,19,5.0,10/1/2011,This place is not as bad as you think.   Eventhough the service is slow they should serve some bread at least so people don't get hungry while waiting.   Overall the restaurant is big and clean.  My food came out fresh and hot so i dont have problem waiting.  There are many tv's showing different kind of sports.    I would come back again because it's easy to get a table at this location
David C.,"Secaucus, NJ",16,20,2,3.0,7/1/2011,"Me and my friend were there for the game 6 of NBA finals. To me everything was just acceptable. My friend,however, was a bit annoyed because they ran out of his first 3 choices of beer. My team won that night so I gave the waitress a whopping 20 dollar tip and got the first smile out of her since I arrived.p"
Tony Y.,"Flushing, NY",0,12,,3.0,6/25/2011,"Place is nice and clean and the staff is friendly. However, the kitchen is so slow that after a while I forgot I was there for food.  The quality of the food was good, didn't have many issues with it."
Antony L.,"Flushing, NY",7,46,1,1.0,9/1/2011,"Worst Applebee's I have ever been to. Food came out very late. I ordered a chocolate shake and what came out was pure watered down chocolate powder. So then I ordered a cherry limeade. The waiter told us that it was free refills for the cherry limeade. So we got a few refills. The check comes and we were charged for each cherry limeade. The waiter then had the nerve to say ""I never said free refills"" with a smirk. Horrible horrible service. Will never come back to this again."
Marvin S.,"Corona, NY",680,81,,4.0,7/31/2012,"came here for a friend's birthday, and we had no complaints at all. the waiter was very nice, the service was great, and the food was delicious. not too much wrong with our visit at all."
Lisa F.,"Delray Beach, FL",1,13,,1.0,9/14/2012,"Empty place. Sat at the bar with below average service with an attitude. My steak arrives raw. Sent it back to receive the same piece that was so full of fat and grizzle I could not cut it. Bar tender took it away, gave us our check without even asking about our meals"
Jinny K.,"FLUSHING, NY",0,2,,1.0,2/16/2013,"it took 15mins to just order the food and the server never showed up. so, we had to wait for her to get a check for another 30mins. the lady at the door didn't even say hi to us but she was holding the door and said have a wonderful day to the other customers. i feel like the staffs look down to us as Asians every time i come here. she gave us check without checkbook or anything. it was just a receipt by itself."
Xavi H.,"Flushing, NY",0,4,,2.0,5/15/2011,"the food takes longer than normal to come out.  the waiters are attentive.  Other than that, this is just like any other Applebees.  I cant really complain about anything else like the other people who have reviewed it. Maybe it was just bad timing. But i havent experienced anything out of the ordinary here.  Expect to wait a looooong time for your food. The drinks come suspiciously quickly."
