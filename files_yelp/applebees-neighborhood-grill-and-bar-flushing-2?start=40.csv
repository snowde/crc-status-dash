Damian W.,"Henderson, NV",4,65,31,1.0,1/15/2016,"Terrible experience and a great reminder of why I don't eat at chain restaurants such as Applebee's. Food has TERRIBLE and service was horrible at this location. I ordered the 9 oz Sirloin with mashed potatoes & mixed vegetables, and really wish that I didn't and that I had gone somewhere else, but we were desperate after a long day of shopping at the mall. Food gave me diarrhea before I even made it back to my car. STAY AWAY! Food was bad, and so was the service. It took forever just to get a refill and our waitress was not pleasant and seemed to either be hating life or her job. I really wish there was an option to give zero stars because I don't even feel that they deserve one star. The only good experience was the hostess. The hostess was wonderful and is a great representation of what other employees should be like."
Dominika W.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",69,54,62,5.0,9/28/2015,"- Great speedy service, & great bank for your buck! Love the steaks and the appetizer choices here. It is very clean and I highly recommend this Applebees !"
Anna H.,"Queens, NY",225,692,8138,2.0,4/14/2013,"First time having lunch at this location, its pretty spacy but not a lot servers on the floor. It was pretty emptied when we arrived there so I asked for a booth for me and my brother's gf.  It took a good 10-15 mins for our server to come and greet us. We ordered right away because it would be hard to flag her down again. I got the Cajun Shrimp Pasta and my brother's gf got the Creamy Cajun Steak & Shrimp. Overall the Cajun flavors were right on our palates. Our server only came once to check up on us and she was no where to be found when we wanted our check.  The food was very delicious but they need to work on the fucking service because it was horrible experience for a chain restaurant!"
Joe E.,"Flushing, NY",7,2,2,1.0,5/15/2016,"Not happy, tried to use seamless to order from you guys and it took an hour for someone to tell me that my order was cancelled saying I was out of the delivery zone. I'm 4 blocks away, that is totally unacceptable."
Siqi H.,"Flushing, NY",88,4,10,4.0,2/9/2016,"It's my first time at Applebee's. The server is pretty nice. I got the $26( one appetizer, two entrées)  combo for my friend and I. We got boneless wings, sirloin steak and a chicken steak. Now I know why people get medium rare, because it's very good! The portion is enough for three, I was satisfied . :)"
May W.,"Manhattan, NY",9,35,387,2.0,5/29/2014,"This applebees is nothing special, just like the other one. Also its over price, the service was bad. We came here for lunch, it wasn't that crowded, but we need to wait 10 minutes to be seated just because we had a stroller, then our waiter didn't come serve us after another 20 minutes wait, the food was average.  When we need something we can't find our waiter, even ask for the check, we need to wait for 15 minutes for her to bring us the bill, its just a bad experience here. One star is for  its location, its very convenient, inside a mall and baby friendly 2nd star is for the free 5 hours parking, If u dine in, u will get a 5 hour free parking.  Overall not that good, and don't think will come back..."
Gian A.,"Flushing, NY",86,9,11,1.0,7/8/2016,Horrible service. Took almost an hour to get our food. It wasn't even busy. Not once were we checked on or even asked how our meal was. Never coming back here.
Richard H.,"Queens, NY",0,6,,1.0,8/23/2016,"Food was ok, service is Shxt. Won't come back again. We came into the restaurant and waited for almost 30 min to have someone with a bad attitude  serve us.  I had to ask for instruction on how to use that computer to order."
Eric F.,"Flushing, NY",25,16,34,5.0,12/20/2015,"I've been coming here for the past 2 years & it has never Let me down with amazing service and food! & ive been to plenty Applebee's in the area and this is one of the best , highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to kick back and chill and have a nice drink by the bar at happy hour! Raylin , Carolina , Stephanie , Brianna are one of the best waiters you can ask for , very attentive and friendly! This is my go to spot"
Adrian M.,"FLUSHING, NY",44,9,,1.0,3/17/2016,"Service is awful here. I can understand a bad day but it's been bad every time I came here.  Food is standard Applebee's across the board, but when you don't get served water with your meal and are ignored by several staff members after asking for them, you have an issue."
Serena L.,"Forest Hills, NY",74,215,15,4.0,5/11/2015,"Went here for Mother's Day...place was super packed but we only had to wait about 10 min. Hostess was super friendly as was our waitress Ivana. Our food was really on point as well! Got the apps to share (wings and chicken quesadilla. next time we will do a full order of the honey bbq wings which were deeeelish!)  Ordered two items from the kids menu for the kiddos, hubby had ribs and i had the thai shrimp salad. We almost finished everything! My salad was fresh, with crisp greens and shrimp, crunchy almonds, etc. omg soo scrumptious! Will definitely be back :)"
Cobra K.,"Singapore, Singapore",64,1257,5727,2.0,1/19/2015,"Applebee's is running a special right now.  $20 gets you an appetizer with two entrees.  However, the food just sucks.  Nothing here really tastes that good.  The mozzarella sticks were average and so was my blackened talapia.  It's talapia after all...the most bland fish of all time.   The only real benefit of coming here is getting 5 hours of free parking at the mall.  Come here and grab something to save 5 bucks on parking."
Naty H.,"Corona, NY",22,13,50,1.0,12/15/2015,"the service, food and asthmosfear of this place is horrible, the last time I eat here I got sick with the food, horrible and the service really slow event that the place was empty, now im back cus i have no other choice but eat here, and the server is rude, she didnt even say excuse me to put the plate in the table, just through it in the table and left, she is wearing crocs that looks like she is on sandals, the bootsthat are next to the bathroom smells disgusting, how can you eat with a bathroom smell, the chicken winds tests like they been there the whole day and just pour the bbq sauce, soo disappointed with this place, even the  lemonade taste like water"
Monica G.,"Miami, FL",110,9,23,5.0,5/12/2016,The food was actually on point. The margaritas were pretty strong and the beer was reallyyyyy cold off the tap.
Gurpreet S.,"Queens, NY",0,6,2,2.0,10/25/2016,"There is nothing about this Applebee's that makes it stand out. The waitstaff is generally understaffed, leading to long wait times although the manager does seem to be making an effort. Drinks are provided on a timely basis but the time for the food is way too long. I have come here several times and it is obvious that many of their appetizers such as mozzerella sticks, artichoke dip and the like are microwaved. The entrees are also of similar quality, with nothing popping out. I am a vegetarian so generally my choices are limited. This location furthers that limitation and what few is provided is lackluster with no significant flavor. My friends who often eat here (due to lack of restaurants in the area) also state that their meat entrees are nothing to praise and definitely could be prepared better. If you can find nothing else, go here. If you have the time and means, find a different restaurant."
Mohsin A.,"Flushing, NY",30,46,2,1.0,6/13/2016,"So I was the friend that almost swallowed a piece of plastic. At first I didn't want to start anything because they're already a shitty restaurant to start off with and I didn't need to push them to rock bottom. But this one waitress wearing glasses and ponytail, shuts the tv off right in front of us even acknowledging the fact that there is literally 1 minute left of the game and our eyes are still glued onto the television. At first we expected an excuse such as I have an emergency, but she pushes the responsibility onto the customers saying to her coworker ""I don't care about these people. I gotta clock out"". What kind of service is this. You see the customers are watching TV and you just close the TV without saying a word to us. All of us were so stunned, we didn't know what to say. And she has the guts to say I don't care right next to us. Are you serious? Are we serving you or you're serving us. Never will I ever come back to this Applebee's with such unpleasant service and food. This place isn't just a terrible place to go eat but the pathetic attitude from that waitress is just not worth the trouble to even bother giving this place another chance. If you really want Applebee's go to the one in fresh meadows where they hire decent human beings and not selfish trolls."
Sara P.,"Hollis, Queens, NY",14,3,,1.0,10/31/2016,"If you like bugs in your salad, this is the place for you.  I ordered an oriental grilled chicken salad to find half way through my salad a what seemed as a grilled bug.  I was sooo disgusted to say the least.  I manage a store near that restaurant and I walked with a colleague to ask for a manager.  A man who was looking at us unresponsive as we asked the hostess for a manager.  We mentioned a bug on the food and he immediately reacted. He said that this happens to orders with lettuce as if it was the most normal thing in the world. He kept the evidence and said that this will be checked in the kitchen.  I know my team will not be eating there any longer.  That was a lot of business that you lost.  No refund was given but only the mention of a discount if I go in again.  No thanks.  Yuck!"
Alex A.,"Rego Park, NY",0,7,,1.0,10/12/2016,"Worst applebee ever! Dirty utensil and rude waiter and manager! Asked for utensil replacement and took our utensil and never brought it back. Asked again and brought back same utensil and told me to wash it by yourself. Also, they dont seems to understand simple math since changes were not correct! Avoid this place!!!"
Randy P.,"Flushing, NY",98,7,1,3.0,12/16/2015,I've been going to this applebees for two years now. I enjoy the service but someone has to get on top of the food quality I was given a stale bun burger once. Mistakes happen but another time I was given a drink in a dirty glass.
Kenny Y.,"Hicksville, NY",106,185,123,3.0,1/16/2014,"I love the happy hour here.  It is a hit or miss on food.  I have tried the two for 20 and two for 26.  Sometimes it can be passable and sometimes it can be just awful.  I have  been sticking with the appetizers just for the half price happy hour.  The food is what you get at any chain restaurant.  Do not come here and expect a 5 star dinner. I like the wings (well done and sauce on the side), cheeseburger sliders, and potato twisters."
