Jean-Paul L.,"New York, NY",16,57,127,1.0,12/28/2014,"I used to love Applebee's for its folksy image and pricing, but not any more after I got charged over $11 for my Long Island Iced Tea a couple of days ago at this location where I patronize most. It was quite suspicious when I found the item listed on my check wasn't ""Mucho LIT"" as it's always been but some ""Ribs"", so I asked my waiter if they mistook it, the answer was NO since it was large size. I didn't respond any more, paid and left WITHOUT HAVING A RECEIPT. Sorry management team, but it couldn't be clearer that you were trying to fool customers who were NOT born yesterday. Haven't you heard that ""only an arrogant fool would treat a customer like an unsophisticated country hillbilly""? I'm a 20%+ tipper generally, even for this case I tipped around 18% which I didn't have to. One star for 3-hr free parking, the other for the waiting staff."
R Y.,"Manhattan, NY",43,270,333,3.0,2/12/2015,"Came for happy hour because it's 1/2 off appetizers and drinks but waited 30 minutes before being served.  Only reason we were served was because I flagged down a waitress who was walking by after serving another table.  I asked her what's going on and she has no idea.  What the...  In addition to everything,  Manager walked by my table twice with cash in his hand.  Obviously not doing his job.  Fire him and hire a new manager  Only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because food came out piping hot and fresh and when a waiter waited on us,  he was okay.  Half price,  slow service,  fresh food, terrible management.  You be the judge."
Caroline L.,"Manhattan, NY",17,10,18,1.0,5/3/2014,"This Applebees is close to where I work and the location is perfect for a quick bite to eat. I keep thinking maybe it will get better but every time i go i am disappointed. I went there recently with my family for a quick bite to eat while shopping at the shopping center.  When we arrived we waited a little to be seated because they had to clean the table which is understandable. When we got to the table it was not cleaned and there was a spilled drink on the chairs. They cleaned it for us and we sat down. When ready to order the waitress sneezed and kept rubbing her nose while taking our order which was quite off-putting. We ignored the other items and didn't say anything thinking its okay they are just busy. Then while eating my mother had found a piece of hard plastic in her soup. She nearly choked on it. Luckily she didn't break a tooth or it cut her throat when going down.  We then called the waiter told her the situation and she was like okay. We then asked to speak to the manager. The manager was like ""oh okay"" when we mentioned it to him. He wasn't very accommodating to the situation. He offered us a lunch combo deal to come back for lunch on a weekday. Which is inconvenient being that most people including myself work during the week during those hours and cannot take a leisurely lunch. We left with a bad taste in our mouth for this place."
Yolanda G.,"Corona, NY",19,2,2,1.0,7/3/2015,I went to Applebee's last night after shopping in the Skyview mall in College Point. I was very unhappy at the level of service provided. The waitress took forever to come take our orders. I ordered a sirloin steak which I specifically stated I wanted well done twice she asked Do you want your steak well done? I said yes. After waiting for my food for almost an hour guess what my steak was rare the mashed potatoes were cold as well as the shrimp. Not to mention that the steak was also hard it looked nothing like the picture. She kept apologizing for the delay I just didn't want to hear it. Never again the food was not good at all and the service is even worse.
Ayesha A.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",0,1,,2.0,9/12/2014,"Every time I come to this Applebees, my food is always served to me cold. The servers aren't very attentive & you always always have to wait a long time for your food.  Today I went to this Applebee's & ordered the boneless buffalo wings, Fiesta lime chicken & triple chocolate meltdown. Buffalo wings tasted old, were cold Fiesta lime chicken tasted reheated was luke warm Triple chocolate meltdown: ice cream was heavily melted by the time it was served. Chocolate lava tasted luke warm, chocolate cake was cold."
Ricardo S.,"Brooklyn, NY",44,15,12,1.0,9/9/2015,"On August 31st, 2015,my fiancee and I decided to stop by this Applebee's within the Skyview mall. We wanted to grab a bite to eat before we took a walk by Citi Field. The restaurant was only 40% full so we figured the wait for food wouldn't be long. When the hostess arrived from seating a previous patron, she promptly points us towards a seat by the entrance. We told her that we instead wanted a seat towards the back of restaurant and seats by the door can be a little drafty. She replied ""Are you sure? The service back there isn't good."" To this, my fiancee and I did a double take. However, instead of heeding her warning, we chalked it up to inter-restaurant dynamics. Maybe her and the server  did not like each other. After being seated, we waited about 5 minutes for the waiter to come over and ask us for drinks.We both asked for water. 10 minuted later we get our drinks and order 2 hamburgers and a quesadilla appetizer. As my fiancee is about to drink her water, she notices a black dot on its surface. 10 minutes later, the waiter returns and we ask him to replace the water. He removes the water and places it on the table opposite of us. 8 minutes later, he returns with a new water. 11 minutes later, clearly noticing our agitation, he returns to the table to inform us that our meal should be arriving shorty. 10 minutes after that, and 54 minutes after being seated i ask one of the busboys to call over the manager.  The manager arrives and ask what can he help us with. I tell him that we have been sitting there for almost an hour and have not received a single part of our meal. He asks what ordered. I tell him the quesadilla and the two burgers.""I haven't seen that order in the back"". That was the last straw. I got up and said we're leaving.  After the whole ordeal, we chalked up this experience to a horrible waiter. While we sat, multiple waiters passed us by tending to patrons in other sections. it seemed as if our waiter was the only one off his game. This had been the second time he had served us and both times had been bad. The young man should look for another line of work."
N W.,"Glen Cove, NY",19,31,1,1.0,2/18/2017,"I have been to Applebee's four times in the last 15 years in four different states. This review covers 'em all: hands down, the worst burger and fries I have ever eaten in my life. I ended up here because I didn't have a choice of places that day. The burger has a nasty, funky flavor; the bun is just horrible. How? I don't know, it just is. It seems to be smothered in some type of non FDA approved nauseating, buttery substance. The fries are dry and tasteless. The place has depressing, outdated decor. Service was okay, but after I got served, the waiter didn't bother to ask once if everything was okay. He probably knew better and didn't want to embarrass himself. I'm amazed this chain is still in business. A 7-11 microwave burger  would be my preference over this stuff- that's how bad this place is! Advice to corporate --shut this place down and go home. You must be running on luck alone 'cause it ain't the food. I can't believe people actually go to any of these restaurants."
Charlie M.,"Flatlands, NY",0,3,,1.0,6/22/2015,Don't be fooled by the highlighted menu. What they served me is not enough to feed a small cat. I paid $18 dollars for my plate plus tax and tips. I ended up going out and eating at another restaurant.
Tony K.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",0,6,,2.0,4/28/2016,This Applebee's used to be good but I went there 3 days ago with my son and wife. Ordered the sirloin steak taste like shit. The meat inside wasn't beef or meat. Just frozen microwaved food it was. The appetizers spinach dip and chips I can't even tell u. I would never go there again.
Isidoro P.,"Queens, NY",12,6,1,1.0,6/14/2015,"There service is extremely poor. First the slow service, I don't know if they are short staff but it took 15minute for the server to take our order. Secondly the server didn't even introduce herself nor made an attempt to smile as if she didn't wanna be there. Lastly the room temperature was sub par vs the hallway of the mall too hot to be in."
William N.,"Flushing, NY",0,3,,5.0,1/23/2016,"Cheapest draft beer, wine, cocktails,bar snacks around on happy hour, and its almost always happy hour. Bartenders are awesomely friendly. Eat, have some drinks, get tipsy for less than 20 bucks...lol"
June Y.,"FLUSHING, NY",58,4,2,1.0,6/13/2016,"Wow! I cannot believe someone else had the same experience as me with that waitress in the ponytail and glasses. When she brought over my food, she didn't even acknowledge the fact that we had things in the middle of the table and completely ignores the fact that she has to warn us about any hot food coming in so that we wouldn't burn ourselves. When I asked her to change the channel, she didn't even answer me even though she was right next to me. They have literally 20 sets of TV in the restaurant, put them to use. I had to ask another waitress to help me. Service from her was horrendous because not only did she give me an attitude throughout the night, but she rushed me to leave in the end. There were still customers in the restaurant and all of the other waitresses/waiters were productive, but then you have her standing in one corner complaining to leave. I was hesitating to write this review because it was already my last resort to come here, but this place should not even exist to become an option. This place really needs to get themselves together and teach that waitress, wait my bad, unmannerly little girl how to be a decent human."
Tiffany T.,"Santa Clarita, CA",11,79,9,2.0,9/15/2014,"Obviously no one expects this this to be a 5 star experience. In fact, the only reason I ended up here was because Five Guys was packed and I was really hungry.  Long story short, there is a really young staff here and it shows. Everything took a really long time and was done at the level of McDonald's. From having anyone acknowledge me at the bar to receiving my (undercooked even though I told them I wanted it well done and was assured it would come that way) food to having to flag someone down to give me the check.  They were talking about things at the bar that customers shouldn't be privy to and jerry-rigging items around the restaurant instead of having them fixed. Not something you want to hear and/or know while you're eating/drinking there."
Reaz K.,"Queens Village, NY",43,113,19,1.0,3/20/2015,"Used to come to this place for lunch cause it was near my job. the last time I was there the bar was empty; and I'm not talking about people, I am talking about the liquor. Most of their draft beers were done, the fridge with bottled beers were empty, made it seem like the place was going out of business. The service is always terrible at all applebee's."
Marcos D.,"Rockaway, NJ",1,8,,1.0,5/28/2016,"ap·a·thet·ic apTHedik/ adjective showing or feeling no interest, enthusiasm, or concern. That was the staff attitude. The place was not busy, but that didn't prevent the food to take a while to arrive. My group was heading to a meeting at the New York Times print site plant. Bad idea and a frustrating experience."
Kareem C.,"Bellport, NY",265,5,2,2.0,1/29/2015,"I'm giving this place two stars because I enjoyed my ""handcrafted burger"" yesterday afternoon, the fries still need some work.  On the other hand the bar service was horrible. Before ordering my mojito I asked the bartender if it was made with fresh mint, real sugar, and soda, she told me it was that was a lot. The first time she made me a mojito she put sprite inside, and it had an awful taste so I asked her to remake it. She then rolled her eyes, picked up the glass and walked away. I don't even think she put any alcohol in it the second time she made it because it tasted like nothing it was the worst mojito I've ever had. If she didn't lie to me in the beginning I would've ordered something else, maybe something she actually knew how to make. I found out that it was made with a mix from a friend who works at Applebee's. I was very disappointed that she lied to my face. The most she talked to me was when I asked for the bill and then she wouldn't leave me alone I work in the industry so I tipped over 20% regardless but I just know I'll never go there and order an alcoholic beverage or sit at the bar again."
Rene A.,"Southampton, NY",1,24,29,4.0,7/12/2014,"I have to say I love this apples bees ,it's clean the food is great and the watters don't ignore you ,they cater to everything I asked for ,portion wise is a bit small but ok because I don't eat much as other people do ,love it will come again for the wonton tacos"
Amy M.,"Corona, NY",0,5,2,1.0,3/5/2015,"First time it was a bad experience but decided to give it another shot aitting here now and again, Horrible service and everything was over cooked and greasy.... would not come back or recommend."
Kevin H.,"FLUSHING, NY",0,8,14,3.0,3/5/2014,It's Applebees so you kind of what to expect. I always enjoy steak and rib. The dining area is very spacious and it's inside the Skyview Mall. Parking spaces are plenty. Servers are friendly too.
Timothy P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,34,1,4.0,9/10/2014,"Applebees has below average entrees. Most of them are pre-made and then heated up. However, Applebees happyhour is where it shines. They have appetizers just as good as any other chain restaurant, and they have the best happyhour prices in the area. Two people can have their fill of drinks and pretty amazing appetizers for a price no one around can compete with. The bar tenders are all friendly, service is good. Usually no wait to be seated. I find myself here pretty often, I guess I am a regular. You really can't beat the service & price."
