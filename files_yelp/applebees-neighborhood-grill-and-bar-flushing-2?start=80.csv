Linda R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,,3.0,4/26/2016,"This particilar Applebee's is very good when they are not crazy busy, but when one goes at prime time food is cold, burnt and they forget to bring meals."
Phillip C.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,2,,1.0,6/13/2016,"This place doesn't even deserve to earn a star. I was actually there to witness that rude waitress with glasses and ponytail, shutting the TV off on another party because I experienced the same thing. There were plenty of other TV around us which were still on, but she just had to come up to us and shut it off. Not only that, but she had the audacity to complain to us in front of our face. When we asked for someone to complain to, everyone including her disappeared. It was a pity that the manager left early, but then again I doubt he would actually do anything because I overheard the other party call the manager over after discovering an unknown substance in their food and instead of resolving the issue, he acted oblivious towards the whole situation. After overhearing that incidence, my appetite went downhill after that because of their lack of concern for their customer's safety and the way they reacted seems as if this happens on a daily basis, or maybe hourly basis. You can definitely go to the Coop, Pizza Maru, Zebra Lounge, or Leaf bar for some quality service and clean food instead of putting your stomach at risk and your mood at blue for coming here."
Patrizia V.,"Queens, Queens, NY",3,80,33,2.0,2/28/2015,"Was ok, came for a quick bite.. Nothing to rave about. .. Long wait for the  appetizers.. We waited 20 mins.... Then finally they bring everything out together! I didn't like that at all.,, we had entrees and appetizers on the same time.. We couldn't.., enjoy all our food.... Is was to much in a short time.. Especially after 20 mins... It was  just drinks on the table... On a Postive note food was fresh and hot! Waiter was Frankie he was great.. Very happy, friendly..  Not a totally loss"
Tsz-Cheong C.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",762,415,7807,3.0,2/1/2012,"Food was ok. Waitress was nice and took our orders quickly. Then comes the wait, and wait and wait. 15 minutes for appetizer and another 15 for entree.  The kitchen is running on 2 speeds,  slow and stop! It was a Sunday afternoon at 2pm. The place was only 1/4 full. The wait staff seem very young, college kids.  The food was ok, nothing spectacular."
Ann C.,"Whitestone, NY",44,288,304,5.0,12/4/2013,"Hey cool, it's an Applebee's in Flushing! Flushing-ish, at least. The whole Skyview Mall is an anomaly and an enigma to me. I gotta wonder if anyone lives in the $400k studio apartments that you can buy right above the mall. Anyway, it's a lovely, standard Applebee's. And I'm really happy about its existence.  I went one time just for dessert and they were totally cool about it even though I felt bad that our bill was so small and we had also asked for warm water. Not hot, but warm. And the waiter actually mixed some cold and hot water together. For that alone, I give them 5 stars. I also like the ambiance. Any place that can bring you to a different world, when you well know that where you actually are, is remarkable in my imaginary book. And where you actually are is on the outskirts of Flushing, beyond the block of housing projects that you were never comfortable walking past."
Erica W.,"Woodside, NY",0,6,,1.0,10/12/2016,Stay away from the apple bees in sky view mall . I usually go to the Applebee's in Astoria but I decided. To go to the one in sky view mall flushing ..I walked in the waiter was very nice attentive..that I would give 4 stars but the food do I throw up now or later I asked myself..the spinach did taste like vomit and smelled old and gave me that vomit taste all night in my throat I was so Uncomfortable the.worst feeling like a burning sensation in my throat after 3 chips with the dip I decided I don't care how much I like spinach dip I'm not eating it also the pina colada tasted horrible like burnt plastic it was also very thick ..I couldn't even sip it I returned it for a pink lemonade my main dish came and the chicken was rough to deal with as if it was over cooked my boyfriend ordered the fish and chips the fish looked so dark as if was in old oil ...or over cooked ..I went on a Tuesday afternoon..I was very disappointed cause I was craving good food but I for sure will never return there beware don't step foot into that apple bees ...
Diane H.,"New York, NY",70,9,7,1.0,4/1/2013,"My boyfriend and I didn't even get to order... Waited 5 minutes and no server comes over to ask if we'd like anything to drink or if we're ready to order. So, I went to the hostess and asked if we can have someone come over. We waited another 5 minutes and still no one came...we grabbed our belongings and left. Unbelievable."
Lesie H.,"Flushing, NY",350,575,260,2.0,4/16/2011,"Chaotic. I think that's the best way to describe a Thursday night at this Applebees. They are either horribly understaffed or terribly mismanaged. The waiters were excellent though. But the way they ran around stressed indicated something was not right in management. Applebees food is as standard as they come. I always liked their spinach and artichoke dish. And their riblets. But what really pulls the stars down is the service.  Our waiter at table seemed to have the entire floor as her area. Two other people were only bring out food for the entire floor. So what I was gathering was that they had only one waiter working and two food movers. Plus a manager. And that's a pretty big Applebees. They need to hire more people re-organized staff. Something's is totally wrong there. On the upside, I heard that during quiet lunch times they do okay. On the downside, the the table next to ours had burnt food. And everyone could smell it."
Tammy L.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",31,90,48,1.0,3/22/2013,Terrible service + Super salty food 1. Service: the waiter was nice but not properly trained or maybe he just didn't care - took our order without asking if we wanted anything to drink - didn't ask me how I wanted my steak done - didn't deliver our food and never asked if everything was fine  - UNBELIEVABLE: my bill came out to about $31.40. gave him $40.00 and I received $8.00 back with no change. He walked off and I had to wave him down for the rest of my change.. he said that he had no more coins in the register... then he gave me $0.50 and said that was all he had.  2. Food: my steak was over salted... way oversalted. *We went at 3pm on a Friday. The restaurant was not full and my waiter had about 3 tables.
B Y.,"Corona, NY",26,77,9,4.0,8/27/2013,Second time at this applebees I have to say it wasn't that bad..came here with my girlfriend on a saturday during..happyhour 7-12am.. we were greeted fast the host told us there was a 15 min wait..very weird because i did see alot of empty tables..after 5 minutes we told the server we where going to the bar to get food there n drink... Once we got to the bar there were a couple of tables next to it so we decided to sit there and the bartender quickly attended us and gave us the menu...our food came fast and the drinks she made them strong enough to taste the liquor i'm a fan ! Only thing was we had to flag her down at the bar when we wanted another drink & we wanted the check....
Roni S.,"Rochester, NY",173,360,1081,2.0,8/8/2011,"Chaotic?  I always see this place empty!  The last time I was here it was a Sunday afternoon, a big shopping day for most families.  You'd think a family restaurant like Applebees would be packed!  Nope!  For the entire hour and a half that I sat here, only four tables were occupied.  Do you like your burgers medium rare?  Ask them to serve it to you raw, when you say medium rare they take it as ""well done."" The service was slow, hell, the host was outside of the restaurant texting on his phone.  After he saw me enter, only then did he return to his position!  What did I expect?  Applebees is synonymous with slow service and overpriced, mediocre food.  There's no way around that, by agreeing to go to Applebees, you've effectively agreed to lower your standards.  Hell, I overheard the employees talking about how excited they were for Five Guys to open up!  I wonder how many of them put in applications at Five Guys.... This place is great for large parties without reservations, people who hate crowds, and people who generally don't like food."
Annie L.,"Sydney, Australia",121,152,581,3.0,10/21/2013,"You can watch a sports game here at bar. The waitress/bartender would change channel for you if you'd ask politely. They can even give you little sound box so you can hear TV. **1/2 off all draft beers means $3 Bud Light all day!** If you're there to dine, you never have to wait on line. Service is hit or miss. I've been lucky enough to have more hits than misses. Kitchen is slow. Food comes out looking nothing like pictures on menu but they can still taste good. Applebees has a great menu, but their chefs need to do better. Milkshakes (and Margaritas) are their signature. I'd order Lemon Shrimp over Rice again - very flavorful. Best of all - very affordable lunch menu!"
Lola D.,"Flushing, NY",6,26,,4.0,1/12/2015,"Favorite Applebee's in Queens hands down. Loved the manager and server, Enrique. Because it's located in a mall, it's like a maze trying to get there lol. Awesome food. Always hot, good portioned and quick."
May C.,"Manhattan, NY",56,100,91,3.0,7/31/2015,"Pretty standard. On weekdays, I like to get the lunch sets which is $8 I think. I always get the Caesar salad and choice of pasta- whatever pasta they offer. I think these portion sizes are great, as I can't fit too much in my stomach. Also worth the price as well. Service was pretty bad here though. The food took too long, and they also forgot to place my order."
Erin S.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",22,9,11,5.0,2/26/2014,"I'm in love with this Applebee's. My fiancée and I came here once. We wanted to go back after a couple of months, but couldn't remember where it was located after a few minutes of searching we found. Boy, was I content. I like this Applebee's because it's not crowed. I could actually here my fiancée when he talks. Our waiter was really friendly. A+"
Miguel P.,"New York, NY",54,37,63,1.0,8/29/2014,I have been a few times but every time a different experience. Waiting 10 mins for someone to ask for if we needed anything. Then they ran out of amstel light. And to top it they ran out of chicken. On a saturday 7 to 8 pm. Place needs to shape up cause now they are lacking management skills. Was there on 4-10-14
Moby W.,"Flushing, NY",150,3,,1.0,3/18/2015,"Terrible hostess and waitress, took 20 min to get 11 people seated, and hostess completely ignored our table for another 20 min, when we told her we were ready, she said okay and walked away, after waiting another 10 min, we all got up, left, and went to 5 guys, and over there, we got our food in about 5 min..."
Vida O.,"Loudoun County, VA",141,333,5,2.0,8/25/2013,The hostesses were great but the food and overall waiter service can be improved on. Maybe because it was mid week and the place was two thirds empty so they didn't have a lot of staff.  But the customer service is definitely a one star and the food was pretty bad and I was starving.  Definitely never going back to this place. It could be a banging spot if they improved on service because of the location.
Cheena G.,"Flushing, NY",53,27,15,3.0,1/4/2015,"Cool place to hangout with friends... Food is just alright but I love going there for the sangrias... Nice service, friendly staff..."
Robin L.,"Clifton Park, NY",36,76,21,1.0,1/28/2013,"Wish I could give the place 1/2 a star. When we arrived, the woman at the door said it was a 5-minute wait. Then she saw our kids & said we'd be waiting longer. After a short wait, we were taken to our freshly washed, but very sticky table. When the waiter brought drinks to our table, he brought two straws for the four of us, then disappeared. Luckily, I had extra straws for the kids in my bag. My son ordered the hamburger off the kids menu. It's about the size on a White Castle's hamburger. Ridiculously small. After asking if we received the correct meal, the server had to double-check with the manager. He reported back that a child's burger is a slider. He also failed to bring a spoon for my son's applesauce. Poor little guy didn't mention this to me, but tried to eat it with his fingers! The only thing that the waiter did without error was the check. But they seldom skimp on that. :("
