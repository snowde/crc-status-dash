Cynthia H.,"Tonawanda, NY",15,58,22,1.0,6/22/2013,"1 star for really bad service. Mediocre food, and small servings."
Ben D.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,78,2,1.0,5/22/2012,"It just blows me away that people willingly eat here. I just don't get it. You should see the look on my face when I drive by on a Saturday and see people actually waiting outside for a table.  Going here for a beer and some fries or wings to watch a game would be the only somewhat acceptable reason to be here.  The food is just like all the other Applebees, out of a can and overcooked then allowed to cool to just below room temperature. I'll be honest, i swore off Applebees for life a couple years ago but Ive been to this one many times and felt I had to warn you in case for some reason you are on yelp but would still consider going to Applebees. You'll have better luck at the wendy's, chik fil a, or cocco's pizza which are all a stones throw away from their front door."
Matt M.,"Wilmington, NC",6,81,8,2.0,11/8/2012,"Typical applebees....nothing special, but nothing bad either. Usually just go for drinks or half price appetizers late night. Other than that I try to stay away from this restaurant....if you can call it that"
Melynda D.,"Secane, PA",56,43,1,1.0,2/9/2013,"This has to be THE worst Applebee's on the face of the planet.  So much so, that I stormed out of the restaurant in the middle of dinner with my mother in law and husband.  The food has been sub-par at best on more than one occasion here, and once I got meatballs with cheese inside that were barely unfrozen.  To top it off after experiencing coagulated meatballs, when I complained they were not warm, the ""manager"" (if he really was one), argued with me that they were cooked to temp, and when I asked for them to be heated in the microwave, he turned them into napalm and I scorched the roof of my mouth.  I tried to talk to said manager, and he was a complete and pompus ass.  The ONLY reason I even give this place 1 star, is because the bar drink I had was good.  I have sworn off eating at this Applebee's ever again, I'd rather eat sod than eat here.  Even after calling during the day and speaking to another manager, all I got was ""I'm so sorry your experience here wasn't good, but I hope you come back again"". Really? Why would I waste hard earned money on a place I wouldn't even give a half penny to if we had them in the US? There is much better places such as Ruby Tuesdays if I want ""Pub n grub""."
Alex H.,"Milmont Park, PA",0,10,,1.0,3/1/2011,"Southern Delco and chain restaurants go together like flies on sh&t. And Applebeez fits the bill. Sad thing is, people around here LOVE them. This place is dirty inside. Service is unprofessional at best. Diners are packed in like sardines. The food is all pre-packaged, deep fried food-distibutor drek. You wanna be ""eatin good in the neighborhood?"", then stay home."
Serena O.,"Ridley Park, PA",1,36,16,1.0,8/7/2010,"Horrible, it really is the grossest restaurant  I have been to in the area!  Went because we got a gift card. Other locations are (while not somewhere I desire to spend my money) at least passable for food...however this one is not.  My husband got a burger and it had the paper still stuck to it and even my salad was rotten. Plus we had to wait for almost a half an hour, the people going there must be crazy."
Ed B.,"Springfield, PA",10,29,30,4.0,10/4/2013,"My wife and I ate here early (arrived somewhere between 5:00 and 5:30) on a Friday evening and were seated immediately. We started with the Ultimate Trio combo of Steak Quesadilla Towers, Brew Pub Pretzels and Spinach Artichoke dip. All were very good but the dip could have used more tortilla chips. I had the Bourbon Black & Blue burger and my wife had the Cowboy burger - both were good and we would both order them again. Service was quick and efficient. We did order the appetizer with our drinks so we received it first and were not even done with it by the time our burgers arrived. We were done and out the door by 6:30. We have had significant waits when going here later but that has been our experience at almost every restaurant in the area. I hate waiting so we eat early and avoid the hassle. My only complaint would be price - $15 for the appetizer and $10.40 for each burger but I guess that's par for the course with restaurants like this. At least the burgers come with fries. The above mentioned items and a large Miller Lite draft came to $39.60 after a 10% discount we had and before tip."
Undercova A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,392,178,1.0,5/22/2010,"Not all Applebee's restaurants are equal.  This place was dirty dirty dirty.  I was depressed eating here and couldn't wait to leave.  The tobasco sauce, oil and vinegar bottles were sticky and gross.  The salad greens were dry and I felt as though I was chewing on leaves from the back yard.  The bathroom was unkept and looked worse (honestly) than any public bathroom I have used recently.  Our waitress though (Sharon) was a very nice and attentive woman who deserves so much better than this."
Shannon F.,"Philadelphia, PA",20,25,,1.0,5/14/2013,"This is the local hangout--god knows why. It's convenient, but that's where the positives end. And while I owe this Applebees a bit of thanks for many a warm molten lava cake (terrible for you! Don't eat it!) just before closing time after a long night of studying or a midnight deadline, I will no longer voluntarily eat here. 1. I got food poisoning from their fajitas. 2. They changed the quesadillas! They used to be good, and now they're greasy and soggy and just awful. 3. It's like a class reunion of everyone who was mean to me in high school."
