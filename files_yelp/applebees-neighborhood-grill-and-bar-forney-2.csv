Katie H.,"Brea, CA",150,2,,5.0,9/1/2017,Hands down the best Applebees I've even been to! My steak was fantastic and our server was great! Coming all the way from California I will forsure come back to this Applebees whenever I visit!!
Carlos B.,"Washington, DC",26,3,,1.0,10/29/2017,"Ordered to go, servers were clueless on how to handle an order to go, where to go, who to go to, etc Ok our order was simple: Shelby had 6oz steak medium cooked Taters and green beans Lauren and Kirsten shared the mini sliders kids meal with fries Miriam had original cheese burger with fries I had the baby back ribs Taters and green beans  Food was way over cooked and dry as hell.  Stick to Chili's in Forney if u want decent service and food Moral of the story don't spend $50 for crap food and service."
K H.,"Dallas, TX",2,20,,5.0,1/25/2017,"We brought a group of 10 and our waitress couldn't have been nicer. She did a great job and was super attentive--just wish I hadn't forgotten her name! The food was great, too."
Rod C.,"Lancaster, TX",0,11,1,2.0,3/30/2016,Eight of the Applebee's in Forney last night service was okay they made a mistake on my food my drink and dinner baby back ribs were burnt dry overcooked I live in Forney for 12 years and cannot figure out why Chick-fil-A is the best restaurant in Forney that is so sad whatever happened to the quality of cooking good food
