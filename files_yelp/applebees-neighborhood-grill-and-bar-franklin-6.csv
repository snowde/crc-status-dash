Charlie F.,"Raleigh, NC",215,980,1220,4.0,6/4/2009,"Very happy to see a choice in Franklin, VA other than fast food!  I'm assuming this is a new location of Applebee's. I ordered Sirloin Steak, which was seasoned perfectly and served quickly.  Instead of the vegetable medley, I got applesauce with my meal.  I was a little surprised that it was served in its unopened plastic cup, just like you would buy at a grocery store.  Not the most appealing presentation. Food was great, server was pleasant but just a tad on the slow side."
Don M.,"Portsmouth, VA",50,22,5,2.0,3/11/2017,The only positive thing about this review would be our server who was very professional and friendly. Aside from that the burgers we ordered were mediocre at best. I asked for mine to be well done yet it was medium rare at best. We could have gone to Hardee's and had a better burger for half the price which is what we will do next time.
Sue M.,"Franklin, VA",6,1,,5.0,1/21/2017,Last night I had the Southwest steak salad it was delicious....I didn't have the Chimmy Cherie but had the dressing on the side. I wanted steak and salad and that's what I got....
Deanna C.,"Arlington, VA",13,1,,1.0,11/13/2015,"Absolutely terrible. It took 25 min just for someone to come to our table and say that they were our server. While waiting for our food we attempted to fix our own table from wobbling so much it looked like an earthquake every time we touched it. My bf and i specifically stated that we couldn't have ANY PEPPERS in our appetizer because I'm deathly allergic, the server seemed to understand but the appetizer still came with the peppers anyways so only my bf could eat it.  I ordered a chicken dish that had gravy that im convinced was made of 80% salt, i could only stomach to eat about three bites before i started feeling nauseous. My bf ordered the babyback full ribs and received a charcoal with some bbq sauce on it. This is one of the absolute experiences I've ever had the displeasure of going through at an Applebee's.  I would have actually had a better evening if i had stayed home and ate my dogs food while slowly having my legs waxed by a monkey. I will absolutely NEVER go back there. Please do not waste your time and endanger your family's health by going there."
Taylor T.,"Ahoskie, NC",8,13,1,2.0,3/2/2016,"Poor service, ok food.  We were seated after a lengthy  discussion between hostesses - I felt a little awkward standing in the door way for so long. After being seated and promised crayons by the hostess (which we never received), we placed a drink and kids meal order. My order was placed when the drinks arrived ten minutes later. Boy was I glad I had already put the kids order in. First round of drinks gone. Still waiting on crayons for the word search that was placed in front of us. At this point I am feeling a little neglected. The hostess walked past copious times without speaking to the kids or it triggering her memory that she would be right back with those crayons. I would have asked, but it was if we were invisible- unable to attract the attention of any server as ours was absent. The staff were avoiding eye contact almost as if they knew they may have to deal with something. Some of the food eventually arrived after about 30 minutes. Then another 10 minutes pass and the simplest order of grilled chicken and an applesauce packet arrives. These were all served by not our waitress, but a pleasant waiter who was definitely more attentive although busy. Food tasted good. The boys wanted some sauce for chicken and once again server was absent. Another server brought ranch, but the little one had to settle for the ketchup that was thankfully on the table since he received  his food so much later than the rest of us.  The bill- we were charged for an extra kids meal and for use of the game thing on the table which we didn't mess with other than to move it out of the way.  The bill was not ready in a timely manner and I had to once again ask another server for that.  When it was incorrect my server was not around again. Finally she came to the table and said it would take some time to correct it because the manager had to sign off on it and take the game charge off. I reminded her there was also an extra food charge as well.  When she eventually brought the correct ticket- she stood over me while I put the cash in the folder and when I asked for the receipt- she said ""why? Are you going to do the survey?"" I replied with ""no, should I? She shook her head no. I needed the receipt for my purposes not the survey, but it makes me wonder if I should do the survey.  It should also be mentioned that the manager was involved in some type of convict at a table near me, but I never saw him- even after having two unjustified items added to my bill and having to wait ten mins for him to sign off on removing them.  I don't really like to give a negative review, I am generally positive and give people or places the benefit of doubt. --I don't know what our waitress is going though, I tipped well and hoped she wasn't trying to skim money with that extra food charge on my bill."
Steve S.,"Saint Louis, MO",1,210,12,2.0,11/11/2015,"Times have really changed since I've been to Applebee's.  We were looking for a good steakhouse in Franklin and were informed Applebee's was the only place for steak. Upon arrival the place was full which gave us high hopes for a great steak. Upon ordering a pitcher of beer it started.  The beer was delivered in a pitcher 1/5 ice to keep it cold. Under the ice section was an air filled spot taking up more room in the pitcher.  $9.00 We then ordered appitizers of buffalo wings. 4 wings, 2 celery sticks and a cup of ranch.  The fried green beans were somewhat more plentiful. Beans and wings were good. All three in our party ordered the New York Strip and baked potatoes.  Steamed broccoli as the vegtable. Two orders were wrong having mixed vegatables instead. One of our party began to soak his steak in A-1. I told them a great tasting steak stands alone without masking the flavor of the steak. Needless to say A-1 to the rescue.  It was an average tasting steak like what you would get from Ponderosa.  The banana cheesecake was excellent as was the waitress,  Morgan who tried to rectify everything. $133.00 bill next time we'll drive to Norfolk for a great dteak dinner."
Lori A.,"Ozone Park, Queens, NY",26,281,227,4.0,7/9/2013,"I recently returned back to Applebees for dinner about 10 days or so ago. This time I went at night. Service was still acceptable and it was packed and everyone seemed to be in good spirits, guests and employees. This seems to be their norm and I'm happy to have found a good location to dine out at in town."
Clayton G.,"Newsoms, VA",2,3,,1.0,1/18/2010,"I come here about once or twice a month.  Not really by choice but because of a lack of choices out here.  I have never been overly impressed with any visit that I have had.  Most of the complaints that I have are with the staff.  They have been rude and slow on a number of occasions.  This is bad because, when it is actually served hot, their food is not bad, just way over priced."
