Tara B.,"Atlanta, GA",26,78,282,4.0,9/6/2017,"Typical Applebee's location. Nothing special but our server, Ruth, was great. I was in town and my mom and I decided to grab a quick bite to eat. The place wasn't busy but had a good bit of patrons in it. Our server was quick and attentive. If we had a question that she wasn't sure of, she got an answer for us right away. (She was new, 2nd day, but we didn't know this until we were checking out.)  I ordered the BBQ brisket tacos. Shredded brisket, BBQ sauce, cheese, pico, crispy onions, Mexi-ranch dressing. It was served with fries and slaw. My first bite was a mouth full of fat! That was pretty gross, especially for the first bite. After that, all was well! I loved how the tortillas were perfectly crunchy. The pulled brisket was tender and full of flavor. The Mexican ranch dressing on it that tasted really good. I will say that the chef drowned my tacos with the dressing. As good as it tasted, I wished there was less of it on there. I really love condiments so this didn't ruin the dish for me. It did, however, take away from the crispness of the onions. It said that the BBQ sauce was spicy but I didn't taste anything spicy and would have loved to. The fries were pretty salty but good. I like the dish came with slaw. Good tasting but bland enough to to pair perfectly with the dish and balance out the flavors. I was it was a larger portion because I probably would have put it on the tacos, they needed something crunchy."
Devany G.,"GA, GA",4,5,,1.0,11/21/2017,"This Applebee's is the shittiest place I have ever been to. Service sucks, food is hard as a rock, dirty dishes that are ""clean"". We went in around 1 and we had to wait 15 minutes until someone noticed that we needed to be seated which is RIDICULOUS! Our waitress was completely fucked up and couldn't even finish a sentence without running all of her words together. I DO NOT recommend going here!!! There was also no tables cleared off even though there was only 8 tables taken up-DISGUSTING!!  Very disappointed with how this trip worked out for us."
Kristie D.,"Alpharetta, GA",91,324,65,3.0,11/6/2015,"I'm not sure I can add a lot to the Applebee's discussion.  It's Applebee's, there are no surprises.  Its decent, unimaginative, reasonably-priced, fairly edible food.  There's nothing on the menu that will blow your skirt up.   Decor is stuck in 1985 but that's ok.  It seems to be a place for the older crowd, I would imagine their dinner rush is at 4:30. I visited because someone gave me a gift card for Christmas and I figured lunch with the mini-me was a good time to use it as she'll eat anything.  I was pleasantly surprised at their lunch menu.  They have a 2 for $20 deal, 2 people get a salad (or soup) and entree plus a free appetizer.  There were a good amount of choices and we enjoyed our food. Service was good and the place was clean.  What more can you ask for?  Its not a terribly exciting place but it is consistent and affordable."
Tracee R.,"Suwanee, GA",1,6,1,2.0,3/22/2017,"Experience wasn't great. My husband took me out for my birthday Sunday night and once we walked in, it started. We stood there for a long time before being acknowledged and the hostess walking up to us to seat us at a table. The server who took care of us was great she took pictures of my husband and I and went over and Beyond to try to make our experience enjoyable. Because of her customer service and the way she took care of us that would probably be the only reason I would go back. My husband and I ordered two of the same pasta dishes which we were both very disappointed and hardly had any grilled chicken and the sauce did not taste too wonderful either. Overall I would say I probably will not go back but I will say that I would like to commend the server who took care of us I only wish I had her name."
Colonial W.,"Gainesville, GA",4,43,27,4.0,5/27/2016,"Enjoyed an outstanding meal with family, celebrating Mom's birthday.  She loves the twofer meals!  Scott was our server and he was very good.  We enjoyed sirloin steaks and a new item called Butcher's meat.  Excellent!! The dining area was clean and not busy when we first got there.  Management made rounds and inquired to how their service and food fared with us.  Top-notch!"
David W.,"Hoschton, GA",17,91,71,4.0,8/26/2016,"Lunch visit. Good salads, soups. Burger isn't too bad either. Good size beers, lots of TV's you could do worse, the staff are attentive and polite. always eat at lunch though. Can't comment on the dinner crew."
Dennis M.,"Atlanta, GA",41,88,82,3.0,7/17/2014,"Stopped in for a quick business lunch.  Decent mix and match lunch combination menu. Ordered Turkey Breast sandwich and the Avacado, Strawberry and chicken salad (both turkey and chicken for lunch.....go figure..) Sandwich was good but more like a third instead of a half sandwich.   Salad was nice and light.  Chicken that topped the salad was wafer thin.  (Probably as part of the plan to keep this meal under 600 calories)  The strawberries were fresh and had great flavor.  Not even a hint of souring. Applebee's will never win a Michelin star, but it is decent food at an affordable price."
Joe P.,"Gainesville, GA",2,7,2,3.0,1/24/2015,"This review used to simply be ""if this Applebee's location had a face, I would punch it."" I returned to this location today (only because I had a coupon for a free appetizer) and was actually surprised: the host didn't seat us at the bar, our waitress was actually polite and attentive, and my overall dining experience was a complete 180 from last time. To me, the two experiences average out, hence the 3 star rating. I'll still be avoiding this location in the future since they tend to be inconsistent."
Bray T.,"Alto, GA",0,1,,1.0,6/27/2016,Waited at least 5 minutes and nobody ever seated us. Three waitresses saw us then preceded to go hide in the back. Definitely wont be back.
Janel M.,"Flowery Branch, GA",0,15,,4.0,11/7/2015,They were short staffed but everyone pitched in and it was great. That's what you call team work! Great job!
Bruce B.,"Cleveland, GA",0,3,,4.0,10/30/2015,"My wife and I eat out a couple of times a week and would not go to Applebee until last month and we blown away by their New menu items we now seek them out instead of running away I'm stuck on their fish and chips ,my wife  on the the burgers"
Jasmine H.,"Gainesville, GA",4,42,52,1.0,10/26/2014,"This was the only place between O'Charley's and Longhorns that didn't have a wait on a Friday night. Now I see why, service was good, but the food was not! The mozzarella sticks weren't  heated long enough- when you bit into it, the cheese didn't ooze out like its supposed to. My steak had no flavor and the mashed potatoes were cold. The daily special house margaritas was weak and watered down with ice. The one star is only for the good service, other than that I have nothing good to say about this Applebees location."
Aya L.,"Gainesville, GA",1,5,1,2.0,1/18/2015,"We went on a random Sunday and was pleased to see that it wasn't crowded, but the service was slow. Like, unbelievably slow. 3/4 of our meal didn't make it to the table; we had to repeatedly ask for refills or missing items. Won't be back; only as a last resort. If that."
Clint K.,"Gainesville, GA",85,36,64,3.0,1/26/2014,We ordered the pretzel bread sticks and the cheese dip wasn't warmed up just slopped in a bowl. My hamburger was pink in the middle when I asked for well. The kitchen needs to tighten up.
J W.,"Atlanta, GA",0,14,,1.0,4/24/2014,"The appetizers were excellent.  The waiter was new but tried hard.  My wife enjoyed her meal.  Mine,(4 cheese pasta w/ chicken) was dreadful.  The water the pasta was cooked in had no salt in it.  The chicken (although cooked nicely) also was devoid of salt, but had a TON of oregano on it.  I managed 4 bites, (1 bite contained the chicken, the other 3 the pasta/cheese/unsalted tomatoes etc) before my stomach started to turn sour.  Then came the plate of bread sticks we mistakenly received (My wife commented in a question that my pasta came with bread, our server thought I ordered bread IN ADDITION to the bread that came with my meal. When I told the server it was a mistake, he said he already added it to the bill, and was reticent to tell the manager about it. So...)I told him to bring me a to go box that I guessed we could eat it later with another meal, and didn't want it to dry out.  By the time he got back with the box, I handed him my plate (minus 4 bites) and told him I couldn't eat anymore and the smell was nauseating me.  He just took it away without comment.  Once the odor cleared up, I chatted with my wife while she finished her meal. He picked up my c. card and rung me out.Not a great experience. Update:  Talked to Applebee's by phone (couldn't get their website to work), we talked in detail in vivid detail. he was very polite and attentive.  A few days later a reasonably polite, but clearly annoyed manager called me at home. He was quite generous in handing out the blame. including about me (""We'd prefer you handle this in house next time"").  I TRIED handling in house, three times before I even left the several times when I got home.  A couple of weeks later, got a generic, un-signed form letter and a gift cerificate that didn't even cover the cost for MY HALF of the meal. Went from making a minor but fix-ably bad transaction to a personal and insulting (Spent more time on the phone about this then actually eating and waiting for my wife to finish her meal) incident that is going to stick with me. Well, at least their consistent. There are scads of  other places to eat within 10 minutes from their. restaurant. Chances of me going back to that (or maybe any ) Applebee's:  0%."
Jason D.,"Kennesaw, GA",94,182,23,3.0,12/18/2012,"The service is ok, but I hate when you see such a good looking picture on a menu or on a commercial and your plate comes out and it just looks like the cooks didn't care at all and it's all mush with lack of presentation."
Don H.,"Gainesville, GA",0,13,,3.0,6/3/2014,"The service was good, food just average. Was in for lunch. It was really slow."
Heather W.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,7,,1.0,7/23/2012,"My bf and I were having a date night that we rarely get with each other due to schedules. I am ashamed that I wasted me date night at Applebees on Browns Bridge road in Gainesville. The food was cold and disgusting , My food didn't have everything on it as it said in the menu and my Bf's food which had shrimp in it still had shells on it.And when my plate arrived I had a few fries on it, I mean for $8-$9 with little to no food on the plate is ridiculous I should have went to a buffet or something.  Will never be going back to this place again. On top of horrible HORRIBLE food the service wasn't even better. Our waitress wasn't talking to us nor coming to our table and our drinks didn't get filled until dinner was over, our empty plates and trash from the appetizers sat on the table the entire time!!!! WHO RUNS THIS PLACE? Seriously!"
Priscilla B.,"Buford, GA",30,119,73,4.0,1/17/2011,"My Dad and I have been here a few times now. Once for lunch and twice for dinner. Each time the service is hit and miss but that's anywhere nowadays. I'd like to have a ""great"" service experience here, but that day has yet to come. One thing is for sure though the food is very good. They have a great selection of 'healthy' entrées. For lunch we did have a really nice server who was very eager to please - a little too eager because when I asked for my house salad with no bacon - and I know it comes with bacon because I learned my lesson on the last visit, he assured me it didn't and sure enough it came out with bacon on it. But he got it fixed up right away. On our dinner experience - we had a brand new server. This was probably her first dinner shift ever. She said she had 3 tables, which filled up within the time of us dining here. Our meals were hot and tasty and she asked if we wanted dessert and we said we would take a look at the menu. She came back about 5 minutes later and dropped the check. We went ahead and paid and she dropped the check to sign with no pen and no thank you. She was in the weeds really bad at this point. She was sweet though and we'll cut her some slack because while we were her only table, we received great service. We'll come back again."
