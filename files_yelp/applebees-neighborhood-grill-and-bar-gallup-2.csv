B R.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,37,7,4.0,11/15/2017,"I have been to Applebees a handful of times over the last 20 years, all in different locations. They have been on my 'ok' list, till this week. Hubby and I are living in Gallup for 3 months while we are on a voluntary work assignment. We eat out each weekend and have tried many of the places in Gallup. Applebees was the latest. First of all, it was busy on Veterans day and it seems (but we didn't ask) that there was a special deal going on for Vets that night. Good for them. Hubby and I decided to go for the 2/25 deal. Main entree, sides. I think our server was fairly new, our unfamiliar with the food so I will give him slack for trying but giving wrong answers. I asked if the mashed potatoes had cream (which is deadly to me) and he said no. I clarified, any dairy? He said no, but they did have a gluten free menu if I wanted it....Ok. He is young and doesn't have dietary issues, yet.  I ordered the baked potato to be safe. For the other side, I asked what the grilled veggies were and he said peppers and cucumbers. Cucumbers? yes. Cucumbers. Hmmmm. I am thinking it was Zucchini, but maybe it really was cucumbers. I got green beans. Ok. On to the ribs. I am a TGIF ribs fan. I like the sweet sightly spicy sauce and not the hickory, tomatoey, sauces. I was assured it was the sweet, so I decided to give it a try. The house salad was wonderful! Nothing really spectacular, but we have been salad deprived. Green beans were flavorless, and possibly a little beyond their prime. Potato was safe. The ribs were WONDERFUL. the 1/2 rack was much less than I expected but there was plenty of food. Hubby had the bourbon chicken and shrimp which he liked. Nice dinner. We will return and maybe I will get a full rack of ribs.  Service was fine, they were busy. I do wish there had been wipes or extra napkins. I had to go wash my hands after eating the ribs, so I could finish my meal."
Warren Y.,"Gallup, NM",0,21,86,3.0,1/6/2018,"Applebee's Gallup NM... I've always heard about this place being called "" Ghettobee's"" why? Everyone that's a felon can't get a job, but there all at Applebee's. I've known a few felons there that were cooks and former workers did say that where all the magic happens. By magic I mean drugs and sex. Managers don't see what their workers do in the back and babies being made there also lol. See? That's why I never ate there in so long. But out of a clear blue sky we ate there. Was before lunch rush and everything there was speedy, from the time we sat down and to eat our food. Waitress there was friendly and never rushed us. Food was ok, but I tried to imagine I was at a 5 star place. It was ok, don't know if I'll ever go back again. But I didn't see any felons cooking my food, which was ok. Would I go back? Maybe, maybe not? 3 stars for the nice clean service!!"
Alysha M.,"Austin, TX",362,341,693,2.0,3/15/2017,Road trip pit stop....not so great :/ my mac n cheese was cold and the Thai shrimp was notttt good- it was like they accidentally overloaded it with spices.  My friend's steak salad was good though. Meh. Is there any Applebee's that deserves more than two stars? Probs not.
Jeff M.,"Albuquerque, NM",25,217,1,1.0,7/9/2017,"OK, I have some family here, so I have local connections - I know where to go (generally), but I rolled in late on a Sunday night, so my choices were limited.  I went ahead and went with the chain - expecting moderately bland consistency. Nope!  The bartender was too busy trying to poach tables in the bar from some server who wanted to go home early.  Then, she got caught by the manager - which led to even more drama.   And, finally, let's not forget the apparently off duty employee who was distracting everyone.  Please, don't let these things get in the way of greeting the ONLY guest at the bar for five minutes. I ordered a couple appetizers - boneless wings were lukewarm and typically bland Applebees fare.  But, I wasn't surprised, short attention span bartender was screwing around, and somebody brought the food.  Then, she couldn't even remember where it went (Hello - I am the only one at the bar).  My second appetizer was much fresher.   Somewhere along the lines, silly bartender was replaced by a solid amateur.  Service picked up from non-existent to slow.  What few guests in there were loud, vulgar, and obnoxious.  The manager should probably spend less time starting flak with bartenders, and regulate their obnoxiously overserved guests instead.   Look, it's a chain - it was safe - I am not sick, I knew what I was getting.  Unfortunately, I got about what I expected."
Judi D.,"Gallup, NM",176,49,3118,4.0,10/31/2016,"In the year since I last wrote a review, things here have continue on the upswing. I've been here maybe 5 times since, and the improvement continues. They are consistently doing great.  Our last 2x here we've received truly excellent service with a genuine smile from a lady named Sarah, and she is so aware - and *fast*. Such a rarity it seems nowadays to have such warmth with such efficiency. To be fair, we've been lucky to have some really great servers here, however, in the past they were bogged down by incredibly slow times getting to the table (maybe staffing has been replenished) and the food and sometimes even the drinks weren't brought over promptly. Put it this way: some ppl's butts were numb from sitting before the buzz of their drinks hit their heads. So kudos again to management for supporting this location, and to the managers that used to make the rounds (none this time, maybe because they don't need to, with Sarah on deck?) because things continue to improve and former customers are taking notice."
Mike H.,"Show Low, AZ",3,113,31,3.0,5/5/2017,"Been a while since my review, and this place is doing a lot better. Real good burger today, and employees are doing much better now. Service is improved and so is the food. I'm nicely surprised."
Debra V.,"Chagrin Falls, OH",45,472,1048,4.0,9/30/2014,Very satisfied. Seated immediately by the hostess. Our waitress was wonderful. We had decided on the two dinners for $25. Michelle recommended the chicken wontons for appetizers. Excellent choice. We ordered baby back ribs. She said the Asian sweet sauce was good and hot. Ok. We got that. Wow!  The ribs were very tasty. The sauce was hot on the tip of the tongue! Left full and happy.
Coco L.,"Albuquerque, NM",58,49,19,4.0,12/6/2016,"I've been to this place a few times since my last review and was pleasantly surprised. The service, food and drinks were a huge improvement from the last time I had made a review. The steak I ordered was cooked perfectly and my margarita was strong and tasty"
Kelli M.,"Lompoc, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/24/2016,"I'm surprised that this location only has two stars. Our visit tonight was absolutely perfect!  Ashley, our server, was lovely and very attentive!  Food came out piping hot and very yummy!!"
Rick S.,"Mahomet, IL",80,122,27,1.0,2/8/2015,"As a chain, Applebee's is similar to other middle of the road restaurants (e.g. Chili's, TGI Fridays, Ruby Tuesday's, etc.) that seek to offer a little nicer experience than say, Denny's, IHOP or your basic diner type establishments. For travelers it is supposed to offer an experience that, while may not achieve a very high level of cuisine, will at least provide a decent meal at a reasonable price. I've eaten at several Applebee's across the country, in New Mexico as well as Washington State, Idaho, Oregon, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.  The Gallup Applebee's has to be by far the worst restaurant of the group. I have been disappointed here several times but was urged by a friend to try it one more time after a recent remodel of the building. The restaurant's physical plant is much improved after the changes but they would have been better off spending more time on food prep and service training.  I realize that there is limited ability to alter recipes that are supposed to be the same between restaurants across the chain, so the chef may not be able to do much with seasoning and preventing bland food from coming out of the kitchen. However, they can ensure at least that the food comes out hot (or cold as the case may be), and that it isn't burnt. As for service, it seems they need to better train their staff on how not to annoy customers. Our meal was constantly interrupted including a spiel on donating to a charity. At first I thought they were trying to be attentive but it ended up becoming irritating to the extreme. The Hilton Garden Inn next door has a much nicer restaurant and also has a full bar to boot. If you want to grab a drink or casual meal, the Garden Grille is a far better choice albeit more pricey than Applebee's. There are also many other local restaurants such as Virgie's on the west side that offer dinner and drinks at a reasonable price. Skip Applebee's in Gallup."
Teresa A.,"Sedona, AZ",0,3,,5.0,5/16/2017,"Let me start by saying I am celiac and finding a gluten free meal in Gallup is no easy task. I went to Applebee's hoping to find something that would be safe to eat.  They do have gluten free items on the menu - but I had a few questions regarding the ingredients.  That's when Gerald Harper, the General Manager, came to my table.  I asked him why the cedar grilled lemon chicken was not gluten free - because I wanted something a little lighter than the other gluten free items.  He told me it was the sauce.   So he took the extra time and effort to work with the kitchen to prepare a gluten free sauce.  He said 'no problem at all - happy to do it'.   Granted the restaurant wasn't overly busy at the time - and I probably would not have asked if it was.  But I really appreciated the extra effort and will definitely will go back to Applebee's on my next visit.  The dish was excellent!  Thanks Gerald!"
Fawnia F.,"Gallup, NM",9,28,66,4.0,3/11/2015,"Dined here twice within the past month and I do have to say it has improved! The food, the service, everything has improved. My fave dish is the three cheese chicken pasta! The sweet and spicy boneless wings are so delicious! Try them. I hope it continues this way, because everything before was a disappointment."
L T.,"Santa Fe, NM",56,192,449,3.0,11/3/2015,"That's odd, it's nice and clean! It must have been a different place months ago, judging from the reviews. I just stopped in for a drink. I ended up getting food and hanging out at the bar. The bartender, Celena, was professional, fun to talk to, and very attentive to all her customers. The food was up and out fast. People at the bar seemed pleased with the service and food. I had the Wonton Tacos and Salsa Verde Nachos. It seems pretty decent and much like my local Applebee's, many miles away. I'll be back when out Gallup way again."
Russ F.,"Cheraw, CO",0,5,,2.0,1/15/2017,"Was told the apps were half off for happy hour. Clarified prior to ordering but was then Charged full price. Manager partially reduced the bill, yet we still paid $10 over what we should have been charged."
Taylor H.,"Palmyra, NY",1,10,6,1.0,4/10/2015,"I do wish that I could give no stars, and it's not because I have high standards for my dining experiences and can't be satisfied...blah, blah, blah. This restaurant truly deserves no stars.  My family and I were traveling from Vegas to home and stopped in Gallup for the night. We stayed at the  Hampton Inn right up the street (so location wise, Applebees is in just the right spot). We didn't expect much. Just the New Mexico version of what we have back in New York. Um, no. First off the hostess was just weird. She was on a cell phone when we went in, and didn't hang up when she saw us. Instead she turned her back to us to continue her little chat in private. When she was finished, she told us a table has just opened up and she was having it wiped off. We got to the table and it was still a mess. I get it though. I work in a restaurant and things don't go the way I want sometimes.  Our waitress took our order. Things were looking up. Then a table of about 7-8 came in. We overheard the other waitresses laughing and they told our waitress ""they're allllll yours."" She sighed in sadness. Nice. After that, we weren't really sure who our waitress was. We never saw our original one until she brought the check. The manager on duty kept asking other workers if we had been checked on in a while, so that was nice. I get that she was busy, so the other waitresses stepped in to help, but it seemed every time we needed something, it was accompanied with an eye roll. Sorry, but we're not the reason our waitress is busy. We're not trying to hog your time. We know you have your own tables.  Eh, you win some, you lose some. We're never coming back."
Heidi S.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,1,1.0,12/19/2015,Awful.  Served raw bloody chicken wings. I took a picture as proof.  I am hoping I don't get sick.
Wind R.,"Santa Fe, NM",0,8,7,1.0,7/19/2015,The worst customer service period. Waitress got my order wrong and suggested I take my food to go after the cook remakes it. I don't think I have to say much more.
Bob H.,"Palm Springs, CA",25,80,165,2.0,11/29/2013,So disappointed in tequila chicken and shrimp choice. The size of the shrimp in the menu photo was 16-20 but served was 21-26 (number is count per pound). Totally false advertising on menu. Entree was 9.95. I know why. Would have paid $12.95 if shrimp were as advertised.  Chicken was dry and over charred.  Service was great at start and horrible at end. Good came promptly but then I was a forgotten table. Too busy with side work.  Complained to manager about food. Was told it was what corporate provided.  Plenty of TV viewing so food for sports watching.  Based on last two visits to very different locations would not choose Applebee's as first or second choice.
Michael K.,"Menifee, CA",6,149,3,1.0,1/17/2016,"I don't know what the deal is, but they must grow the laziest, worthless employees in some dilapidated basement in the outskirts of Gallup and everytime I drive through I am blessed with having to deal with them.  We stopped in around 3pm, which is typically a non busy time in a restaraunt.  It took almost 30 seconds for the hostess to greet us even though she was standing right there and was just doing nothing.  It was almost as if she completely forgot what to do.  She then walked away to clean our table.  She was only 20' away, but I think she actually fell asleep wiping our table.  Once seated, I excused myself and went and washed up.  By the time I got back, our drinks had yet to be served.  Then my girlfriend went to clean up and when she came back, we still didn't have drinks.  We're talking water here.  It didn't come until after we placed our order.  We placed a simple lunch and once again we had to wait.  The only good thing was the little computer thing on the table where we could pay our bill and not have to wait for our waitress.  As we are walking out, our waitress and the hostess, both of which had eye contact with both of us, couldn't even muster up a thank you or good day.  I would pack up some beef jerky and popcorn and drive straight thru Gallup next time."
Lisa Y.,"Gallup, NM",2,103,,3.0,5/5/2016,"This Applebee's generally has good food.  I just tried a new dish last night (Shrimp stir fry) which I won't be having again.  It was tasteless, but I've also had salads, burgers, and steak and all of those dishes were good.  The service varies.  Sometimes it is slow as molasses and other times it is quick.  I am happy that they do have good margaritas though.  And By good I mean something other than a well tequila and mix.  It is hard to find a restaurant in Gallup that has premium liquors and bartenders that know how to make good drinks.  Overall, a good restaurant pick in Gallup."
Claire G.,"Flagstaff, AZ",0,34,28,4.0,1/8/2015,"The food was good and the inside was like any other Applebees.  The staff was very friendly.  My mother and I ordered 2 for $20.  Our salads came before the appetizer, but they quickly corrected the mistake.  Overall a good experience."
Dawnyale A.,"Brookhaven, Atlanta, GA",210,19,2,4.0,3/29/2015,"Nice service, love our server his name is Dusty. Very personable and on top of things. My coffee never got cold loved this experience. Food wasn't too slow coming out. Nice experience over all."
Candace M.,"Spokane, WA",275,671,1126,4.0,12/22/2013,"My review of this Applebee's is totally subject to where I was at the time. Living on the reservation, there was absolutely nowhere to go and nothing to do. When we wanted a drink and some appetizers after a long day of work, my good friend and I would drive the hour to this Applebee's. Previously, when living in a big city, I hated Applebee's. I thought it was overpriced and overrated and generally a restaurant to avoid. When in a town of 5,000, on the other hand, I LOVED this Applebee's. The service is hit or miss, and the food is hit or miss, but those drinks were always on point. For that, I will always think highly of this Applebee's."
Kevin S.,"Plano, TX",28,825,2,2.0,10/30/2010,"Cruising by on my way to Albuquerque, I was looking for some lunch.  Noticed the Applebees off the highway. As others have mentioned, this one doesn't live up to the expectations of other Applebee's in the chain. Ordered the Three-Cheese Chicken Penne.  It was a bit overdone and the breadstick that came with it, was seriously over microwaved.  Waiter seemed annoyed I asked for some grated cheese. Actually, the waiter seemed annoyed I even showed up.  So service here wasn't the best. Parking was easy.  Prices were the usual. Maybe sitting at the bar is the answer?"
Luke B.,"Mesa, AZ",0,6,,2.0,9/28/2014,"I should have checked with Yelp before I came.  The reviews are correct.  When someone finally came to take my order, I ordered Cajon chicken and shrimp.  Evidently, some people think you can cover up freezer burn with an extra helping of garlic.  Not so.  Had to dip the chicken in ketchup to choke it down."
Dan L.,"Glendale, AZ",15,13,1,1.0,1/13/2015,"Poor service. I walked into the bar and sat at a hi-top. I'm a white guy and the only guy in there not Native. Placed an order with their automated system. Waitress was conversing with her friends at the next table, looked at me and went back to her conversation. I activated the ""call server"" button on the automated system and a light flashes. She looked over again and back to conversation... I left. And to be clear it wasn't busy."
Christoph B.,"Santa Fe, NM",2,24,9,3.0,6/11/2014,"Good selection on food. Friendly waitresses. A little bit too big and too loud. The cocktail margarita didn't taste good. In total not worth the money spent, too expensive."
Deidra T.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,6,3,3.0,4/9/2013,"Odd how others got bad service, when ever I go there I get good service and the food was good.  Drinks were good-ish."
Chris K.,"Glendale, AZ",4,7,,2.0,12/31/2011,"Upon arriving for lunch, there was no host to greet us at the door, and we literally just had to sign a sheet of paper, and wait. (unacceptable if the place is not busy, which it wasn't) I ordered the quesadilla burger (good, but I would rather it would not have  the service was so slow. our food was obviously sitting at the pick up area for awhile, the plate was ""warm"" and the food was not ""hot"" when it arrived at our table . our server was a bitch, however I giver credit for trying to play the nice card. surprised by the swarm of flies near the restroom area. The steak that our friend ordered was not delivered with the rest of our meal, and took longer when she said ""I'll be right back with the steak"" (try another 5mins). Debra was the manager who helped us (because of her, we might be back)"
Ricky F.,"Lone Tree, CO",0,16,9,4.0,4/19/2012,"Very friendly servers in a great Applebee's which always has very good value and tasty food. This one really feels like the 'neighborhood' restaurant that the chains claim to be,"
Dmitry O.,"Oakland, CA",22,252,271,2.0,11/24/2013,"Great service! Food on the other hand is not terrible, but just taste like frozen food. Food that was microwaved, put on a plate, served and charged $14. Small piece of tilapia fish and some raw tasting roasted potatoes. I told my wife that applebees used to be my favorite restaurant chain. Hopefully they will improve food quality. My wife had the wedge salad which she devoured. She enjoyed it. Main course was some crappy tough chicken marsala with raw-ish potatoes."
Tiva B.,"Gallup, NM",2,10,,2.0,2/10/2014,Waited over 10minutes for someone to take our drinks & another 10minutes to actually get them. Drinks were wrong & didn't get it fixed until we got our appetizer 15minutes later. Bad Service and Mediocre Food. Not my choice to come here but we don't have the largest range of restaurants. Now I remember why I haven't come back in over a year. Choice Cracker Barrel or a local place.
Lexie K.,"Tempe, AZ",0,6,,2.0,9/3/2013,"The food was decent, when it finally came out.  Not only did the table wait for more than 30 minutes for our food, but when we finally got it, one of the party members had to wait an extra 15 minutes for her salad!  Apparently, the chicken was not ready (although we had three steaks on the table that looked as though they would have taken a lot longer to cook than putting together a salad and some chicken).  The waitress did, however, acknowledge this issue and took a whopping $0.70 off of our more than $70.00 bill!  So thoughtful of her.  Overall, bad service and mediocre food."
Andrew S.,"Reno, NV",20,72,11,1.0,5/5/2009,"I was in town on business, and figured Applebee's was a safe bet.  Man was I wrong.   After being seated, I ordered a drink while I looked over the menu.  Fifteen minutes later, no server, no drink.  He finally showed back up, only semi-apologetic though, while trying to place the blame on someone who was running a register at the time. I don't even know what that was about.  He took the drink order, shouldn't he make sure it gets where it's supposed to go? So then I go to order and I'm told that soup is only available during lunch--which of course isn't stated anywhere on the menu.  So I order a steak, which was SUPPOSED to come with a salad and steamed vegetables.  Twenty minutes later, I am presented with a small bowl of lettuce. Just lettuce. Seriously.  That's a, uhh, ""neat"" salad.  Thanks.   And after the bowl of lettuce, I get a room temperature chunk of meat tossed on a plate. All by itself.  No vegetables.  Nothing else whatsoever.  What kind of restaurant does that!!??  Just a plate with a lonely piece of mediocre, not-even-hot meat on it?  Not even an attempt to dress up the plate or substitute something else for the vegetables which were, apparently, only served at lunch as well.  I wasn't in the mood to really make much of a stink about it at the time (it may have taken the manager 45 minutes to get to the table anyway) , but I promised myself I'd write a review about it.  So here it is."
June P.,"Baltimore, MD",14,83,1,2.0,2/14/2010,"If you think all Applebee's are the same, you have never been to this Applebee's. This is a busy one and the food is not so good. But, in a town like Gallup, there aren't a lot of places to go. So you'll probably come back here anyways."
Doug W.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,4,,1.0,3/18/2013,"Didn't actually eat here, had a coupon mailed to me from Applebee's good in participating restaurants. Called the restaurant since we are from out of town, was told they would honor the coupon, noted my name, and said the mgr. that would be there when we were coming was notified. But when we got there the mgr. declined to honor the coupon, so we went to Cracker Barrel next door and had a good meal."
