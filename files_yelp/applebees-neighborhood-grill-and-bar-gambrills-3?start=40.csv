Jarre J.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",134,11,1,3.0,2/5/2013,"This past weekend I was out in Crofton at the Chapel Town Center shopping with my signifcant other and we decided to grab some lunch at this Applebees location.  Not a big fan of Applebees, but I really liked the sports theme at this location, and it was actually CLEAN.  The food and service was actually pretty good as well.  No complaints...would probably eat there again if I was shopping in the area."

Laura R.,"Centreville, MD",9,70,3,2.0,1/2/2012,"Meh, probably one of my least favorites of the chain restaurants.  It's ok in a pinch, but I don't seek it out."
Stephanie M.,"Millersville, MD",11,138,28,3.0,6/23/2012,I agree with a previous post - I am disappointed that there are no Happy Hour Specials between 4-7.  Service last night was lacking - the waitress was too quick to bring the check without asking if we wanted more drinks or dessert. The place was pretty empty - especially for a Friday night so I'm not sure why she was rushing us. Food was good and reasonably priced but I would much rather go someplace else with HH specials and a more fun atmosphere.
Janet C.,"Odenton, MD",27,28,9,4.0,3/10/2012,"I've had bad Applebee's before and this place really isn't bad!  Seriously!  This place is WAY better than the one near where we use to live in California. That place was bad!  The servers are nice and there is always something here the kids will eat. Sometimes, you just want something that you know will taste good.  And it's always busy here - even during the week which is a good sign because the food is fresh.  This is definitely our go-to spot if we want to spend a little bit of money for sit down service."
