Faith W.,"Secaucus, NJ",147,10,1,5.0,12/16/2017,I was craving wings and I always enjoy wings at Applebee's . So I decided to order Carside to go .Let me start by saying when I decided to order them it started to snow so I thought I would have to wait forever . When I got there they were out to me as soon as I pulled in the parking lot and they were THE BEST wings ever ! The wings we're still crunchy like I like them  .
Christopher D.,"Lodi, NJ",255,342,2303,3.0,2/14/2017,"I usually stay clear of most chains as much as possible just because I think the food is usually predictable as far as level of tatste. I was invited out to be treated tonight and YeAhhhhhhhh free meal why not lol. That being said, Applebee's is pretty good for a chain in my personal experiences. The menu is varied and the prices are reasonable/ cost effective. The several times I have eaten there over the years the service has always been good as far as customer service, My friend she had the steak which was my only complaint tonight. Had no flavor and was kind of tough like a reptiles skin lol. Other than that, I'd recommend Applebee's as a nice place to eat if you have your expectations for the level of reataurant it is.   This location in particular usually has a short at the most. The free Wifi is actually pretty good which is another plus. No issues streaming videos etc.. The 2 for $20.00 menu also has a decent selection for those on budget.  I like the amount of food served with the entrees which is just the right portions so no leftovers to take home. And the prices overall are alright too. This is sort of a bland review but what else do you want its Applebee's nothing to see here so keep it moving lol.  Bottomline good spot for drinks and average food at cost friendly pricing. So of the food will surprise you in a good way though."
Brittney M.,"Dumont, NJ",0,1,,1.0,10/5/2017,"This is the worse service I have ever experienced. 1. No one came too our table the whole 30mins we were sitting there until we told a manager. 2. We ordered apps and only got 1 plate for 2 people??? Didn't bring or offer water to the table. So we had to ask then she brought us water with NO straws. We ordered margaritas after they brought us our apps and NEVER brought them out. We had to wait another 30mins and ask her where they were. HORRIBLE. I will never be going there again. Not to mention when we finally did get the margaritas, they were absolutely disgusting. I will definitely be going to Hackensack or Clifton next time where they know how to provide quality service."
Darlene D.,"Hasbrouck Heights, NJ",136,6,,1.0,11/3/2017,"I ordered One simple appetizer, Spinach dip. I was ridiculously over priced for cold spinach that has some weird looking cheese and tasted re-heated. Applebees as big of a chain so called restaurant. You should be ASHAMED OF YOURSELF. Rip off"
Krista C.,"Bloomfield, NJ",1352,69,217,5.0,2/19/2017,"Party of 6 and we got sat down fast and our waiter Jhasua was very nice. I got a margarita ,classic wings and the blue ribbon brownie!!! All was very delicious. The blue ribbon brownie came out warm with ice cream and was perfect. Place is clean and parking is fine."
Lily T.,"New York, NY",667,883,687,3.0,8/25/2016,Your usual Applebee's. Food came out fast and was your standard frozen Applebee's food Service was quick and friendly. Draft beer was reasonable priced  Will be back here again
Brendalynne F.,"Lodi, NJ",544,189,1887,4.0,4/21/2016,"If you're looking for a cheap and casual spot to grab some drinks and grub, this is the place. They always have great deals going on: - Half priced selected appetizers every day after 10 pm - $5 burgers on Mondays after 4pm - ""2 for $20"" menu (one appetizer to share and two entrees) They also have happy hours and ladies nights, but I'm not positive on the details for those. The food is nothing fancy and it isn't the best quality, but it's definitely good for what it's worth. I crave their sweet potato fries and mozz sticks all the time, I love their grilled chicken wonton tacos, and their pasta dishes come in huge portions and are really filling. Xavier was a great waiter too! Really enthusiastic, friendly, and efficient."
Dom R.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",33,87,159,1.0,5/17/2017,Came here because i couldnt go to hackensack with wife because of a power outage. Big mistake should have taken it as a lose and gone some where else. I dont know where to start food was ice cold now its burned and dried up and tasteless. I guess doesnt care making dinner they feel they needed to make cold. It was better the first time. Dont come here. Go to hackensack. I forced myself to eat this because theres nothing open at this hour.
Antique R.,"Passaic, NJ",2,22,4,2.0,2/18/2017,The only reason why I'm giving 2 stars is because the siracha shrimp was tasty. Other than that I would be giving them only one star.  The service was awful the waiter only came to take our order after that we never saw him again. I'm still waiting on my son refill to his drink a year later.  It was just awful on this particular night I'm never returning here again ever.
Pete M.,"Henderson, NV",8,6,1,1.0,7/1/2016,"I had an occasion to eat dinner at this Applebee's last night. Normally I'm not a big steak eater, but wanted to see if the new menu and marketing for this chain had improved things from the past. Sadly it had not, I ordered the sirloin medium rare,  when I finally got it.... (23 minutes later) it was closer to medium well than medium. Being the son of a butcher I feel I know my steaks pretty well and this by far was one of the worst pieces of meat ever. It was not only cooked poorly, but was tough and stringy. I literally could hardly cut it with a steak knife. I left about 80% of it uneaten as I just couldn't chew it any longer.  This place should stick to things you can't mess up...salads, pasta, and chicken because steaks are beyond thier skill set.  The bright note was the waitress was very apologetic and attentive."
Cinthya G.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",124,46,15,5.0,3/31/2017,"My son and I were there two days ago for dinner, we had a very pleasant experience since the minute that we walked in until the minute we left. Our waitress Sasha, was very helpful, courteous and friendly. My son ate a delicious chicken macaroni and cheese with french fries and I had Chicken, artichoke & spinach cavatelli that is one of the newest plates on the menu, with a classic red apple sangria...OMG! DELICIOUS!!! ;) Something totally different that I greatly recommend."
Dan R.,"Manhattan, NY",56,62,1,1.0,2/22/2017,The drinks are watered down. Only come here if you want to get ripped off. I will not be returning.
Nina A.,"Garfield, NJ",0,37,73,4.0,9/22/2016,"I came here often in high school. I knew most of the waiters; some were nice, some were very rude. The food isn't so bad, but it's overpriced. I usually had quesadillas, pretzels, or wings, all great, and half priced at night. Sandwiches and soup combos are good too. I loved the deserts.  The penne with chicken wasn't so appetizing."
Patrick J.,"Garfield, NJ",172,2,,1.0,2/23/2017,"I wish I could've left a a less than one star review. Never received such disrespect from the bartender (Tabby) in my life. When I asked to speak to the manager she asked me not to speak to her "" like that"". She refused to accept my friends international license and refused to serve us. I thought restaurants were supposed to put their customers first, I guess that's why tabby works at Applebee's because she's too incompetent to work anywhere else. Do yourself a favor and go to TGI Fridays, dont come here. I will never come back again in my life"
Toni T.,"East Rutherford, NJ",0,3,,4.0,1/14/2017,Food is good. Lot of choices. Toni is a great server who adds some character to the place.
Ronnie J.,"New York, NY",2,51,85,3.0,10/24/2016,It's a nice spot not too busy Saturday night. But they slow as hell. The waiter took so long to come to the table to ask us want we wanted. Lucky I was hungry. It's all good because I didn't tip.....
John B.,"Garfield, NJ",0,5,,5.0,4/25/2017,"It's dumb lit, honey bbq boneless wings all day"
Michael M.,"East Rutherford, NJ",2,5,,1.0,6/14/2016,Worst food ever. I got the American burger with bacon onions that are chop in the meat. What a small burger and u can't even Taest the bacon or unions. Came with hardly any fries and no pickle for 12 bucks. What a rip off. After tuning it away I went across the street to McDonald's. Should have been my first choice!
Eddie T.,"Wallington, NJ",0,2,1,1.0,10/7/2016,"Literally waited for an hour and 40 minutes, and called ahead. No need to wait this long. One of the waiters is sitting at a table, shooting the breeze with the people there. Very disorganized here. The manager did literally did nothing to help us. Let people just sit at tables for ever an hour while the didn't eat or drink. Saw atleast 5 groups of people show up and leave in the time I was there. Needs a new system, management and work ethic here. Would rather go to the McDonald's next store. Definitely would NOT recommend after this experience. Terrible. Just terrible"
T. L.,"Nanuet, NY",23,16,5,1.0,8/23/2015,"Took my Grandmother to dinner there yesterday. HUGE MISTAKE! 1. House salad came to the table without dressing.  Had to recall the sever to ask for it.  The oil and vinegar bottles (separate) were brought to the table unopened. 2. The salad, warm with plum tomatoes that made me gag from the taste.  3. Could not get the beverage orders right. 4. My Grand ordered a baked potato and received a disgusting rotten potato.(photo) 5. The side order; mixed vegetables with uncooked (hard as a rock) carrots. 6.  The server notified the manager of our disappointment with the service and came over and didn't introduce himself, nor did he take responsibility for the incompetence of the staff preparing the food.   If you want a steak, I suggest you either try another Applebee's or not even trust this franchise to provide good service and fresh food."
Angella B.,"Garfield, NJ",55,5,,1.0,2/3/2016,Avoid this place on a friday night!!! also they should really stop hiring rude high school waiters.
Nick C.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",325,963,1662,3.0,1/5/2014,"It's Applebee's. Applebee's is the kind of place you end up when no one can decide where to go. Nothing really great here, but a few friends from high school like meeting up here for their 10pm happy hour. I'd only come here when drinks and appetizers are half off. Food is okay, nothing really sticks out. Beer selection is boring, but they usually have one good seasonal beer. Service is good, they don't rush you to leave or anything.   I'd only come for their late night special"
Ernest R.,"New Milford, NJ",721,19,24,2.0,5/26/2015,"The waiter was rushing and placed my soup and salad in first , my entre came out last and it was cold . My sponsor food came out last he ordered blackened Talipia and the waiter starts making excuses about to as why the Tapia came out last , the waiter was totally unorganized and inattentive . As a result I will not be ruturning to Garfield Applebee's the service was unprofessional and the waiter was inattentive to his guests .he just apologized and doesn't deserve no tip for his poor service ."
Stephen D.,"Bergen County, NJ",213,571,175,3.0,5/7/2013,"I only came here for half apps. Or server was extremely nice, very helpful, she told us specifically which drinks were cheaper and which I weren't, she could have just let us order without explaining what the deals were, but she didn't. I like the boneless buffalo wings, good flavor...chicken. None bad. I tend to hate the rest of the food here. Bt for $25 we got 2 drinks and some apps, can't beat that."
Calvin W.,"Irvine, CA",162,236,169,3.0,3/1/2015,"Applebees have been getting worse and worse everytime I go. highlights are the fajitas, the asian taco appetizer, and thats about it. I saw they had a craft beer menu. i asked the waitress what she had and she said ""blue moon"". I said what else.. She said thats it. smh. service was slower than expected and meal (fish and chips) left me wanting more food(didn't finish...chips were soft and fish was watery. I think I prefer TGIF."
Jose T.,"Lodi, NJ",2,10,1,1.0,6/28/2016,"Can someone please train the chef in this place. The inconsistencies with the food and taste will drive you nuts.  Two times in the past month or so ive ordered grilled chicken, both time chicken was raw. Very disappointing!"
Norma H.,"Garfield, NJ",29,7,8,1.0,7/30/2015,Horrible horrible service will not be back. I ordered coffee it  was water and the girl told me to get it a McDonald's WOW!!!! Never again...shame on u...
Kyle H.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",367,230,34,3.0,5/26/2013,"This place is a mediocre resturant and there is nothing to really brag about during the day. Prices are so so for really mediocre food. But after 10pm this place transforms into the best deals around! HALF PRICE APPETIZERS!  and awesome drink specials. I would never come here during the day but after 10pm ever appetizer is half off the original price and they usually have awesome drink specials. I had 2 Long Island Iced Teas for $9 the other night which is awesome. for food my favorite is the boneless wings, i love the classic buffalo.  Nothing crazy to brag about but if you are looking for some good cheap food with friends at night this is a great spot. Not a good first date spot, unless you wanna look cheap."
David G.,"Paterson, NJ",19,3,1,5.0,2/8/2015,Really enjoyed all the food I ate today Carlton my server was very attentive and made sure we were satisfied patrons. I absolutely love the food and customer service I received today. Will definitely come back soon.
Rach D.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",0,32,4,1.0,6/7/2015,Ate here with friends for lunch. Chicken wings had 2 hair strands. Food was soo cold when they served it to you. And the wait for the servers to take your order was way too long. If you want quick and fresh meal do not go to this place. Bad customer service.
Kevin T.,"Clifton, NJ",50,14,25,3.0,11/11/2015,"Service is super slow, but the people who work are wicked nice. Unfortunately, nice people don't cover for the terrible service."
Diana W.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",0,13,4,5.0,5/22/2016,"Pretty good food... The new quesadilla burger is delicious, and the fiesta like chicken is mouthwatering. To top it all off, they have the chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream, which is heavenly. I come usually for dinner, and they tend to be busy at that time, but the wait line is typically 15-20 minutes give or take. The staff is quite friendly, and attentive as well."
Catty B.,"Manhattan, NY",2,31,4,5.0,1/18/2016,I love that location. Their 2 for $20 deal cannot be beaded!! Their steak and chicken is juicy and very tasty!!! The staff are very attentive and fast!!! Best Applebeas location and too good for a franchise restaurant!!!
Feedback F.,"Wayne, NJ",0,14,3,1.0,3/9/2014,"The only reason I gave it a one is because the waitress made up for the horrible food.  The boneless wings were like a rock. If you plan on ordering them, bring a hammer and a pair of safety glasses.  The fries were way too salty.  The full meal was way too cold, too over cooked, and completely drenched with spices that masked the awful quality of the food.  My advice, if you are in this shopping center and NEED to eat, hit McDonalds next door. It's a safer choice."
Colleen S.,"Clifton, NJ",16,6,1,1.0,9/21/2014,"if you like over priced microwaved food, then you'll love this place and any of there chains- terrible. would not feed to my dogs. waitress was a young kid, friendly, so i tipped her well, but the soup was way over salted, my buffalo wings hard as a rock... this place sucks. it's a glorified burger king or mc donald's.. all sh_t food!! stay away"
Mia M.,"Seaside Heights, NJ",44,158,75,1.0,9/27/2014,Uff. Mango lemonade had no mango flavor. Wings with new Asian flavor was inedible and so salty. Wonton chicken crisper was so salty. Only the spinach dip was good.
Ashley G.,"Kearny, NJ",36,67,6,5.0,1/15/2015,Ask for Isabella she was amazing waited for the food got the water and asked us for more things really friendly.
Angie C.,"Wallington, NJ",2,14,6,1.0,8/23/2014,"Even thought I like the service and food, I'm giving this place one star because there is a guy that works there (food runner I think) who was standing next to the hostess station/desk right on the front of the restaurant picking his Afro, very disgusting! I heard the manager say something but as soon as he walked away he kept doing it."
Nicole P.,"Lodi, NJ",970,321,563,2.0,3/6/2014,"So this Applebees is like within a half mile of my house and in the 3 years I lived in Lodi I have eaten here once.  So thats somewhat of an indication of what I really think about the place...Anyways we got a gift card a while back and forgot about it till the other night and I was dead tired from work and had no intentions of cooking ..So I figured lets try take out. We ended up doing the 2 for $20 meals bc we had a $25 giftcard . So I got the sizzling chicken and shrimp with a parmesan cheese sauce accompanied by rice pilaf and  peppers. It was pretty tasty, I'm not gonna lie. We had the buffalo bites. They had a pretty spicy flavor, I liked them. I was surprised... My bf got the steak and red potatoes. He ordered it cooked well done, but it was literally bloody in the middle. I told him not to expect an awesome steak from Applebee's , DUH... And for like $2 my daughter got a side order of fries.The portion size of the main entrees were a little skimpy. But for $24 in total, it wasn't horrible. Would I got to Applebee's without a free gift card? Probably not... But i may check out the half price apps after 10pm  the other Yelpers keep talking about,... Mediocre at best, but in a pickle maybe worth a try.... PS Major stomach cramps about an hr after we finished eating....."
Lauren C.,"Carlstadt, NJ",1,23,,5.0,1/21/2015,Great workers who are very friendly. Food is great especially their artichoke dip!
