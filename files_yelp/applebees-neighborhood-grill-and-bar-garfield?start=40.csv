Joelle H.,"Bergen County, NJ",226,262,20,3.0,5/1/2013,"I'm not a huge fan of Applebees. I feel like their food is very greasy and not very creative,  but after 9:30PM they offer half price appetizers and discount drinks which makes them A-OK in my book."
Matt V.,"Moonachie, NJ",131,9,27,2.0,6/7/2015,"I came here last night with five of my friends for a quick bite to eat around 11. The place still seemed pretty busy and there was a wait for tables. We gave the hostess our name and she took our phone # to notify us when our table was ready, but did not give us a quote time of approximately how long we would have to wait. After about 10 minutes, we asked if our table would be ready soon since there was a long booth that had been empty since we got there. Two of my friends had to leave, so now that we only had four people, we were sat soon after. The waitress we had came shortly after and took our drink and dinner orders. We did the 2 for $20 combo and got our appetizers before our drinks. Everything seemed to be fine until we got our entrees. I had told the waitress that I wanted the 3 cheese penne and when the food came by two other servers, I had gotten the chicken and fries basket and told them the mistake. Shortly after, our waitress came over and said she had fixed it and my food would be coming out shortly. She had also failed to notice that our drinks were empty so I had asked her for refills as well. After my food came and we all ate, we had to wait about 5 minutes for the check, and when the check finally came, the waitress had charged me for the 2 for $20 and the pasta separately as if I was paying for two entrees. We went up to a manager and he fixed the problem right away. Overall, the service was very slow and the server was inattentive. She tried to make up for her mistakes by telling jokes, but I wasn't buying it. I used to come here a lot, but I can tell that the staff has changed and that there is definitely room for improvement. Hopefully, there will be a more positive experience for future guests because I was not satisfied at all with my past few visits here."
Yennifer G.,"Jamestown, NY",13,39,9,5.0,9/26/2014,Every time I go to This Applebee's I receive great service. The food is good I wish they would change the menu more often as I feel like I eat the same thing every time I go. Other than that it is great. P.s is best to go for lunch they have good specials and it's not too crowded.
Edward T.,"Basking Ridge, NJ",148,66,,1.0,1/28/2016,"I don't like posting negative reviews, because the livelihood of people is involved, but I also believe in honesty. In the interests of full disclosure, I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, and eat in them as seldom as possible (although my elderly father has a taste for the Olive Garden and I guess you could consider me a regular, albeit reluctant, patron of that chain establishment). I've dined occasionally at different Applebee's with friends, and it's always what you'd expect-- lots of undistinguished but basically satisfying food for not a ton of money. Not this time. My dining companion wanted to come to this Garfield location, and, as it was her birthday and I was picking up the tab, I said, ""Hey, no problem.""  We were seated promptly, and we both ordered the Brisket Enchiladas, which looked immense in the photograph on the menu. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup to open.  I had a Coke, my companion had wine. At some point after ordering, a gentleman, who I assumed was the chef, came over to us and explained that the dish we had ordered was spicy, and he just wanted to caution us. My thought was, ""This is an Applebee's; how spicy could it be?"" My companion asked that hers not be too spicy, and I concurred. The gentleman was nice and helpful, but this had never happened in any Applebee's I had ever been in, and some instinct was alerted in me. The soup was ok-- nothing more, nothing less than what I expected. The main course, however, was something else again. The Enchiladas, which looked gigantic on the menu (and thoughtfully had a paper cup of Jalapeno peppers provided on the side of the plate), were puny indeed when viewed on the reality of the plate, more an appetizer than a main course. They were covered in white-yellow glop, and were lukewarm at best. There was more of the rice on the plate than anything else, but it was pretty tasteless. Again, I'm not very picky when it comes to chain restaurants--- I'm aware of what I'm getting into when I go into one--- but if I had 3 bites of meat in this ostensibly ""meaty"" main course, that was a lot. My companion complained about the lukewarm heat of the meal to the management, and they seemed to take it in good stride. But later, after we had left, it began to belatedly really steam me up. Places like Applebee's are popular because they're relatively cheap. However, upon reflection, this place wasn't really cheap. Given the quality of the meals we were served, it was appalling. The next morning, I complained about the meal to my companion, and said, ""We should have been more vocal about it."" She said the meal had been horrendous, then corrected herself; ""It wasn't horrendous, but it was very, very mediocre."" Again, reading negative reviews can sometimes prove entertaining, but I don't like writing them, because I recognize that people in the restaurant business, especially the chain restaurant business, generally work very hard for not much money. And the people in this place seemed nice, helpful, and efficient enough when it came to service. Still, if the purpose of Yelp is to give an honest appraisal, I have to be honest here. Maybe it was fluke; maybe not. But I left feeling cheated, quite frankly."
Frank M.,"Westwood, NJ",94,109,2,4.0,6/4/2014,Can't really go wrong with this good fall back spot.  It's close to home and if we just don't feel like cooking it's an inexpensive comfortable place to go that we always know we will find something to eat.  Only negative is sometimes it seems as though the wait staff isn't 100% up to speed on things but it's ok to me.
Aracelly C.,"Garfield, NJ",3,20,10,1.0,10/8/2013,"Boneless wings will get you sick,don't bother. Service is ok, happy hour is after 10 which is actually good. If you're from the area you'll see a lot of your high school friends lol"
Derek D.,"Garfield, NJ",0,29,9,1.0,6/17/2014,Wouldn't recommend to anyone food was poorly cooked and skimped on ingredients. Had the new shrimp scampy pasta and the shrimp was tough like Rubber and the pasta dry.
Samuel G.,"Sloatsburg, NY",0,3,3,5.0,2/28/2015,Just got home from Applebees it was good like Applebees good you know...I just want our awesome waitress Izebella (sorry if i messed up that name) to know that I got home and burned a little and ate those churros and they were banggginnnn.  Thanks.
Samantha D.,"Houston, TX",242,145,186,3.0,5/25/2013,"Generally, I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants but you can't beat their half apps after 10:30. Its a perfect place for those late night cravings for greasy bar food and a beer. The waitstaff at this location is pretty friendly/helpful which is always a plus."
