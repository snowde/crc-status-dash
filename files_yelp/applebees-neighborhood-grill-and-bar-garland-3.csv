Brandy N.,"Denison, TX",84,5,3,3.0,4/3/2015,The service was poor and the food was horrible plus they charge me $6 for a shot of tequila in my margarita. The 4cheese mac&cheese was horrible.  Lesson learned don't try anything new.
Austin R.,"Garland, TX",136,164,528,1.0,7/4/2017,"4th of July evening , at 10:00pm. There is no one inside. Sat down and waited about 7min before I was greeted and given a menu. Waited another 5min for a glass of water, Ordered a $1.00 frozen margarita and given a on the rocks. Food came out pretty fast, but chicken seemed it wasn't cooked fully so did not eat it. Just ate the ribs... Couldn't tell anyone, no one ever came back."
Megan A.,"Dallas, TX",39,1,,1.0,12/27/2017,Ate here tonight. The wait staff was really nice. The food on the other hand was horrible. My husband ordered the whiskey birger and damn near threw it up. Switched it for brisket tacos which wasn't much better. My kids fries were old and hard. My 2 year old just kept saying her food was nasty. The manager was awesome and was able to assist with our bill. The salmon was extra dry... it was just a bad experience food wise.
Jose G.,"Dallas, TX",339,12,6,1.0,6/14/2017,"Was there Monday 6/12 , service and food was good up until I was almost done with my chicken Caesar salad and then I found some plastic in the salad. Seemed to have been the Caesar dressing packing. The server happen to come up at the time I found it so it's defiantly was no joke.  The manager came up to apologize and offer to send me out another meal but I had to go so I declined. I hope this doesn't happen again as I could of easily ate the plastic , yuk."
Jason A.,"Carrollton, TX",105,3,1,1.0,9/25/2016,The service is very bad. Disorganized. Slow.  We asked for chips and salsa. 2 oz salsa ramekin was brought out... I asked for more.  A 1 OZ RAMEKIN was brought out (enough for about 5 chips)...
Amanda P.,"Mesquite, TX",8,18,17,2.0,11/3/2016,"The food was really gross. The only thing I would come here for is a few drinks due to their happy hour, and THAT'S it. The food will definitely disappoint you, and the only reason why I'm giving 2 stars is because the waiter was really nice and attentive. If weren't for the waiter it would have been a 1 star rating."
Stacey J.,"Dallas, TX",29,3,,1.0,5/7/2017,We have been to this location about 4 times and will never come back again. We walked out the last two times. Walked in and hostess was sitting there and asked if we could sit in the bar around the corner and I said no I wanted a booth.   She sat us. The waiter came and took our drink order and brought us our drinks never again to return. Sat for at least 15-20 minutes and they were not busy. Staff was standing around talking.
Ashley R.,"Dallas, TX",20,124,174,4.0,12/9/2016,I had a good experience here. Came in for the bogo deal. Was actually way better than I expected. Our waiter was an older gentleman that was extremely attentive and kept our drinks full.
Michael G.,"Garland, TX",0,1,1,1.0,12/31/2015,"After waiting twenty more minutes at the bar on my to go order, suffering through music that was way too loud for a restaurant, the bartender brought out our food, and I go home... At home, the salad was brown and wilted, one of the two salads didn't have dressing. My kid's meal was supposed to come with a drink that wasn't there, and our food was cold. By far the worst food I've had there. I won't be coming back, and I recommend you dont, either!"
Dennis S.,"Garland, TX",8,3,,2.0,12/7/2016,"Have been there 3 times shortly after opening . Service was bad food was not hot, received a credit for next meal only have them refuse to honor it. Was told new manager did not have to honor credit. This has happened 3 times. I have not returned in over a year. What good are promised credit when they refuse to except it."
Mary E.,"Rowlett, TX",0,7,3,5.0,8/2/2016,Love the food will be coming back very soon service was fast awell clean restrooms and steam is at high recommend
Tony S.,"Arlington, TX",145,761,55,4.0,2/3/2015,"I gotta say, I was a little nervous b/c I read all the bad reviews AFTER I already sat down and ordered.  Most of the reviews said the food was good, just terrible service.   Well, that was not my experience today.   This was my first visit at this location and I came in for lunch.  The food was very good.  And Veronica, my sever, was first rate!   Maybe management read those reviews and made changes...???"
Ryan G.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,3,,1.0,10/14/2016,"Only gave it one star because I couldn't give it zero stars. This place has gone all the way down hill. If you want slow service, incorrect orders, and servers/managers who don't give a damn about either, this is your place. This used to be a great place to go but now it's horrible. I love the value that Applebee's offers but I'd rather pay twice as much than put up with this particular location. Unless you're drawn to a thugged up bar scene at night, steer clear."
Fuk Y.,"San Antonio, TX",23,440,162,1.0,6/23/2016,"Hungry and in a hurry because of Chile vs Columbia game, I had to get to go at Applebee's. Stupid me, right? Who on earth with sound mind would eat there? But I did, so here I am crying about the crappy experience that I had. This location charged me extra 1 dollar for the same side item that I can order online. Its annoying having to pay extra 2 bucks for no reason. But it's only 2 dollars, said the bartender. I refrained from telling her to pay an extra  $2 when she buys a dozen of donuts, or fill up gas.  Anyway, the place looks like a dive. Food (bbq rib, grilled veggie, and sweet smash potato) was ok. If you have to choose McDonald or this place, choose this place but order to go to save yourself the 25% tip for service you will never get."
Stephanie T.,"Garland, TX",27,11,1,1.0,3/16/2016,I have given this place more than a few tries to get it right. First time they are out of ribs and tonight they are out of margarita's. The service is lacking and the management team needs customer service training!
Theresa K.,"Mesquite, TX",9,38,26,1.0,9/27/2016,"The waiter, Virgil, couldn't have been nicer. Ordered two $9.99 steak dinners and both, after a lengthy wait , came out full of gristle. We mentioned it to our waiter, who in turn said he would inform the manager. When the manager finally came to our table, ten minutes later, to validate our online coupon, I mentioned that our steaks were grisly. He was very nice and said we should have let him know so he could correct the order. We told him we did tell our waiter, but when no one came and we figured no one would, we finished our meal. I told the manager we did eat our steaks so we planned on paying but did want him to be aware that the steaks were not good quality cuts of meat. Without hesitation, the manager insisted that he take one steak off our bill. Because of the friendliness of both Virgil and his manager, we will assume this was just an unfortunate dining experience on this particular evening and give it another try some other time."
Monica A.,"Garland, TX",62,1,,1.0,9/9/2016,I went there tonight about 10pm sat there for 10 minutes no one even bothered to come to our table to greet us. Servers passed us and a manager was even bussing the table next to us.we got up and left.
Marcelina B.,"Dallas, TX",0,2,,5.0,8/15/2016,"I have to give them 5 stars.  After encountering the rudest hostess in the world at OTB, we attempted Applebee's and the service was stellar!  The waitress was polite, personable and so incredibly sweet.  She truly made a horrible night so much better!! She, unfortunately got an ear full when we first walked in about our encounter at another restaurant.  She did everything she could to make sure our experience there was better.  Food was hot and fresh. She refilled our drinks without needing to be asked. Just awesome!!  If I knew her name, I'd post it.  Thanks Applebees!!! We appreciated the awesome service more than you'll ever know."
Jack T.,"Dallas, TX",103,39,239,1.0,7/13/2012,"Such a huge disappointment going to this location.  From the get-go service was not the brightest (Sorry Windi C.).  Referred to the Wonton Tacos as the wedges and the Honey BBQ as Honey Mustard (TWICE!).  Missed one of our entrees (there were only 4 items total, 6 if you include the water and soda).  Food was pretty sad as well (for this location, I've been to other's where it's been fantastic.  The one in Carrollton is pretty good).  The Potato Twisters were a smaller order than usual and were burnt, oily and stuck together.(pictured)  There were a few pieces that were six inch long oily burnt potato logs.  Wonton Tacos shells were not crisp and fresh. For a drink refill, my girlfriend had to go to the host and ask.  Won't be coming back to this location which sucks because it was the closest Applebee's. edit: Had asked for our ""Honey Mustard"" Chicken to be packed up and they decided to throw in the sauce container from the restaurant (pictured). Thanks Windi for going the extra mile! P.S. Still left a 15% tip only because I have been in the food industry for over 10 years and it kills me not to leave a tip. I usually leave 20% or more depending on service. I was very strongly tempted to leave 10%, but WIndi made a comment at the end where she ""wouldn't hold us hostage any longer"" and I always appreciate humor."
Sarah C.,"Plano, TX",0,1,1,5.0,5/29/2016,"Been going here for about a year, and the service we get from Krissy is awesome! She learned our drinks and our entrees from the first time we sat in her section, and she always takes great care of us."
Eliora C.,"East Dallas, Dallas, TX",0,9,4,2.0,2/1/2014,"This is the 3rd time I've been to this location and had good food and poor service. The food is actually really good for Applebee's. We had spicy buffalo wings, chips (that were warm and crispy) and salsa, and a quesadilla that was filled with chicken, cheese, and grilled onions!  However the drinks and service were under par. In the entire restaurant was my table of 2 and one other table of 3. Our waiter only visited out table to take our order and bring the check. Someone from the kitchen brought our food and the bartender brought our drinks.  My margarita just tasted like sweet-n-sour syrup. My friend's Long Island tasted like sweet-n-sour syrup and vodka. We were never given or offered refills on our water or for another beverage.  With the food being fresh and tasty, they have potential. If you're wondering why I keep going back, it's because the prices are way too reasonable!"
Kirk M.,"Garland, TX",0,2,,5.0,3/14/2013,"I have read all the reviews, Hey people, if the service is slow ""just don't leave a tip"". Waitress and waiters all work for tips.  As far as the food at this location, I have never had bad food here, everything every time has tasted excellent. Just today I was not feeling well, so I got an order togo of onion soup and salad. Now, I feel a lot better. This Onion Soup will cure everything. Thanks Applebee's."
Mary S.,"Garland, TX",109,223,8,2.0,7/26/2014,"I would avoid this place, as if there aren't enough reasons to dislike Applebees on the evening I visited this location the dining area smelled terrible.  Not sure if there was some bad food in the back or they were having plumbing issues, but it was that type of smell.  Service was pretty good, only had drinks so I can't speak for the food."
Sanford H.,"Garland, TX",0,1,,2.0,4/12/2015,Service was good and staff friendly. But compared to other applebees I have been  to the food was not so good. Proportions were skimpy and steak was tough. Was at an applebees in hot springs ark. not too long ago and ordered the same thing steak was half again larger tender and cooked just right. Twice as many vegetables and mashed potatoes. Other times I  have eaten here the food was cold. I  hate that. Won't go back to this particular location.
Paige W.,"Rockwall, TX",1,39,2,1.0,6/23/2015,"If i could leave a negative star i would. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. Ive had more professional service from mcdonalds employees, seriously. Im not expecting 5 star service at applebees, but common sense would go a long way here. There are so many bad things i could say but ill just stick with the key points. First off the appetizers they brought us were cold. Second was the ""top shelf"" drinks they brought us with literally no alcohol in it. When we told our waiter this, he said it happens a lot and that he wanted us to tell the manager so she could see how often it was happening. At this point i thought they would fix  the problem with ease, i was very wrong. The ""manager"" never apologized and seemed annoyed we said anything. Usually when theres a problem the manager will fix it as soon as possible, not here. After 30 minutes of waiting they bring our food out, still no drinks. After we finish our meal they brought us melted drinks that had obviously been sitting on the bar for who knows how long. The kicker is the fact that there were multiple employees talking and texting. Pretty much doing everything but their job. To the business owner heres some advice. If you cant train your uneducated employees, hire some that have customer service experience. I hate leaving bad reviews but this has been, by far the worst resteraunt experience i have ever had. There are plenty of other places to eat around here that actually care about their customers :)"
Phyllis D.,"Dallas, TX",9,70,,4.0,8/3/2015,"Went for lunch.There were three of us ,no problems.Our server Brain was great.Food came in short time.He came back a few times to check on us.Food was hot and very good.Would go back any time."
Angie K.,"Frisco, TX",0,22,,2.0,7/15/2015,"I have been here three times now, and I have never been impressed. The first time it was ok,but I ordered a glass of wine, and it was served in a white wine glass, and it only had a few sips. The bartender talked about cheap prices so when I realized this sip of wine was seven dollars a glass, I was surprised. I ordered the new shrimp appetizer which was okay. The second time that I went all of the employees just sat around and talked. The woman manager and the bartender with long blonde hair were having a blast while the bartender threw out the big F-word. Really!! There were kids and women around. I couldn't believe the manager just laughed about it.  The third time that I went; I waited over fifteen minutes to be asked if I wanted a drink. The man manager walked by me at least three times and never even asked me if I needed anything. It isn't like this place was busy it was during the week with only a few customers. I will not be going back. I had a meeting around the area that is why I kept returning, but I won't be anymore.  Food was not good; service was bad!"
TJ A.,"Dallas, TX",14,12,7,3.0,1/5/2014,"They must have cleaned house.... I mean no familiar faces, and the service was MUCH better. Thank you very much. Now lets get down to food. Every time I order the Brew Pub Pretzels w/beer cheese dip I seem to get less and less cheese dip, sometimes you can tell it's been watered down. All I want is a consistent  product. I don't really order entrees any more because they could not get it right, but now that I see they have a new crew I'll give it one more shot. Really trying hard to like this place and looks like they are now on the right track."
T N.,"Garland, TX",0,23,2,4.0,2/25/2014,I agree that when they opened the service was good. Then it all changed and there was not a white waiter or waitress in the place.  The music and sports tv were both up so loud we couldn't talk.  The waitstaff was slow moving and all overweight.  They act like you are inconveniencing them. It's been like that for months (year)? Complaints left on their website were not responded to.  Last couple times we went it seemed so much better. New manager?  I love the food. Always consistent.  Thanks for cleaning up the waitstaff.
Sky V.,"Dallas, TX",95,14,8,1.0,12/16/2012,Worst service ever! Sat down and waited for 25-30minutes and didn't get greeted by any of the servers. They walked back and forth several times and didn't even acknowledge our  existent.
Haydn G.,"Grand Prairie, TX",3,3,,1.0,12/19/2013,"Food is ok. To bad the tip doesn't go to the cook. Stopped in for lunch I love Applebee's French onion soup and spinach salad. Problem is people here don't know what they're doing. I ordered a Texas tea and the waitress brought me some red drink that tastes nothing like what I ordered. She brought me back a long island ok fine whatever. We ordered our food while I was eating she came to see if she could take my plate um no.but when I sat my plate on the side of the table for her to take she brings us the check and leaves our empty dishes. :/ well I had a coupon I gave her at the beginning of our meal and she forgot to take it off so we send the check back. She said she is in training, so her trainer brings us the new check we give her 3 twenties well she brings us change for a 50 . Well we call her back to tell her and she disappears to the back for a good 15 minutes. What really made me mad is our original waitress was helping another table and when I tried to get her Attn to see what was taking so long she looked at me then turned right around like she never saw me. So as I'm getting up to go find a manager the other girl finally comes out with our change. It's sad but I have a strong feeling the change was wrong on purpose hoping we wouldn't notice. In the end she screwed herself out of a decent tip Smh if you want to go to Applebee make the extra drive to a better location!"
Emily M.,"Garland, TX",61,18,,2.0,6/4/2013,"Good happy hour prices and decent service, but you know that when an officer has to walk around the premises as people eat after 7pm that the clientele is ghetto. I've actually seen a fight break out here."
V D.,"Garland, TX",0,4,,1.0,1/15/2014,"We (just like the last reviewer) were so happy when they opened this Applebee's because we live fairly close by. The excitement was short lived due to the inconsistent food quality and service that we received on several occasions. The latest visit (1/12/2014) is the one that finally prompted me to leave a review. I called in and ordered take-out and was severely disappointed when I returned home and got a good look at the food. I ordered a Pecan Crusted Chicken Salad (over $10) and upon opening it discovered that about 30-40% of the lettuce was actually the hard, white stalk part of the lettuce (the part that I throw away when making a salad at home). If I wanted an inferior salad made with the junk part of the lettuce there are many fast food venues that I could have went to and saved at least $5.00. I immediately got on the Applebee's website and wrote a letter detailing my experience and so far have not gotten a response."
