Harry N.,"Gaithersburg, MD",6,2,,3.0,11/25/2017,"I went to Applebee's with my sister on last Friday before Thanksgiving day to celebrate my birthday. When we walked into the restaurant, a staff greeted and opened the door for us. We didn't have to wait long to get seated, and we sat in one of the tables near the windows. After that, a server named Kevin (if I remembered correctly) handed us the menu and asked what drink we would like to order in the meantime. I had my Dew Berry Burst, while my sister picked her flavored lemonade. Then, the server took our order and left so we could take a look at the menu. What a great and diverse options it has!!! So many dishes, combos, entrees for us to choose from. We decided to go for the 2 for $25 option with boneless chicken wing being appetizer, 6 oz USDA Choice Top Sirloin for me (with medium rare steak plus fries as a side), and Bourbon Street Chicken+Shrimp dish. While waiting, we looked around the restaurant. Because we came in at 12:00 or 1:00 p.m., the restaurant was not so crowded at that time. But, it got great and cozy atmosphere when the weather was freezing cold outside. Few minutes later, our foods came out. My sister's dish was sizzling hot and smelled delicious, but my steak dish was not. The sauce instead of putting on top of my steak was sloppy on the side of it, making the plate looked messy. What made me so disappointed was that I told my server to have my steak medium rare; yet, when I cut the steak in half, I got little to no rare at all. I cannot understand how one cannot distinguish medium rare from well done, but sadly they cooked my steak wrong this time. To make up for their mistake, I got loads of fries on my dish. The steak on the other hand was juicy and flavorful. I also tried my sister's chicken+shrimp, and I think it was awesome except the onion. They got too salty. During our meal, our server came and checked if everything was good. Also, he asked us if we would like to have some desserts after we finished. We both shared Triple Chocolate Meltdown because I could not finish it by myself. I particularly like the chocolate oozing out from the cake when slicing it. In short, we were quite satisfied with Applebee's and will be likely return."
Jasmine G.,"Gaithersburg, MD",295,90,311,3.0,10/17/2017,"This location might be going the same route bob Evans went. (closed)  First off: parking was easy to find. The is plenty of seating. They have this tablet where your kids can play on it but they charge you $1.99 to use it. You can pay your meal from that device as well. Customer service: My server was super slow. I had to keep asking the host to get correct my order. And he rarely came to check on the table. Mind you, we went around 3:00pm. The restaurant was almost  dead ghost town.  Food: My plate was half way poor. Their potato's and fries  came out hard!! Lol like I could have chipped a tooth! Lol My kids burgers? The bread was hard and brown. I didn't even know till I cut the burger in half and my kid just ate it not to complain. They did give me a replacement and that took awhile too. The ribs?! Were good! I should have ordered that instead. My husband and Mom really enjoyed their plate. So it's 50:50. They need to get their service together though"
Justin J.,"Clarksburg, MD",399,24,36,3.0,10/7/2017,"Came into Applebee's to watch some college football games, appetisers, and of course THE DOLLAR MARGARITAS. However, when we ordered our drinks, our waiter informed us that it could take 5-40 mins to receive our margs because everyone was ordering them. However; we got our drinks within 10 minutes so we didn't have any problems. Also you can order only 3 per hour apparently so keep that in mind when you're thinking about coming here and getting 5 the moment you sit down. The margaritas were average and they could have definitely put more tequila in them but hey, they're a dollar i'm not complaining. We got the appetizer sampler with boneless wings, chicken quesadilla, and pretzel bites. Pretzel bites were pretty good, but the cheese sauce was kinda play-dohy haha. Chicken quesadilla was good but came out a little watery/greasy but nonetheless was good. Bones less wings were just boneless wings. hard to screw up on them ya know?  Overall, it was a pretty good experience food was decent, drinks came out in an orderly fashion. HOWEVER, The drinks were a little watered down."
Hibah S.,"Germantown, MD",124,160,125,1.0,12/24/2017,"Absolutely awful. This Applebee's already did not have a good rep in my book as I associated it with poorly cooked steaks and watered down drinks. But now it's officially a one-star place due to service. Last night, I came here for dinner. My boyfriend and I stood by the door for several minutes, during which time absolutely no one acknowledged or greeted us. There were two employees talking to each other literally right in front of us. They were loud, so I got their names - Carla and Jordan. They continued talking for a long time while we stood by the door. Other parties were also waiting for their acknowledgment. I understand if you need to talk to each other about something, but don't waste the time of your guests. Greet and seat them first - or if there's a wait time, let them know! Or if you're conversation is truly that important, apologize and say you'll be with them in a moment or get someone else to be the host. Don't straight up ignore people. After several minutes of being ignored, we decided to leave. We couldn't believe the kind of service that was so bad we walked out before even being seated. That has never happened before."
Xiomara C.,"Gaithersburg, MD",29,15,7,1.0,12/12/2017,"I will never go back to this Applebee's and maybe no other Applebee's considering how my issue has been handle. We went out to eat Saturday night and ordered our drinks, and when the drinks came out ordered our food. As my son took a sip out of his he said it tasted weird and moved it away. I looked over to see if they had given him the wrong drink and when I looked I saw a roach YES A ROACH!!!! inside the drink. We flagged our waitress and she quickly called the manager on duty, the lady apologized and asked if we wanted to stay LIKE NO but I told her I wanted a report cause if my son got sick they would have to be responsible. I filled out the report and the same night I email customer service and yet now Tuesday 11pm I have not heard from nobody. Very disappointed"
Joy D.,"Damascus, MD",130,38,,2.0,12/23/2017,"The service was just ... BAD. From the beginning we tried to speak with the hostess about seating options, she barely greeted us and then stopped speaking to us mid conversation to have a very lengthy conversation with one of the other staff members. We were seated in a booth in the corner and had to flag down another server to find our own. Our own server didn't know any of the drink or food specials and was genuinely surprised when we read them off of the menu to him. He was pretty good at first, but throughout the course of the night it became harder and harder to find him. Once again we had to flag multiple people down to find our server. I'm sure they are super busy due to the $1 Long Island specials but sheesh! Just because I like a good deal doesn't mean I like bad service. We tried to order appetizers throughout the night as well and they were out of half of the items and some of our orders never came in. I'd say only come here if the plan is to catch up with someone and you do t have anywhere else to be. Otherwise go somewhere else!"
Josh S.,"Damascus, MD",0,2,,5.0,11/22/2017,"Very good bar and restaurant. Although my experience at the bar was dismal, I have enjoyed the many times I visit here with friends due to location and deals. Best happy hour deals in my area, due to vast selection of apps for half off, and amazing selection of coctails and drinks for half off as well. My personal favorite so far is the ""pair of Jacks"" drink which as the name implies has jack Daniels in it. And with such great deals on drinks during happy hour, I don't feel so worried that I'll get something I don't like because the drinks are only 3-5$ respectively. And as a college student it works out fine. I can't wait to try more drinks, and to go again."
Bianca B.,"Montgomery Village, MD",265,39,17,2.0,9/17/2017,"Stopped by for dinner and sat at the bar. My boyfriend and I ordered from the 2 for $25 menu. We ordered 2 Caesar salads for the appetizer and as for entrees, I ordered the Firecracker Shrimp pasta WITH THE SHRIMP ON THE SIDE and my boyfriend ordered the steak. Our Caesar salads came out promptly but I noticed a hair in my salad before even eating eat. I alerted the food runner and she apologized and brought a new one. I don't really recommend the Caesar salad. It's not tossed, it's just romaine drizzled with Caesar and croutons, no cheese. After we finished our salads, someone was bringing out the entrees and our server stopped the person and took the food back to the kitchen. I noticed that it was because the shrimp was on the pasta. The server then brought the food out and I alerted him that I was ALLERGIC to shrimp, so if it was the same pasta, I couldn't eat it because the shrimp had already touched it. He told me it was a new pasta and the shrimp never touched it. After having the pasta in front of me, I saw the breadcrumbs from the shrimp, IT WAS THE SAME PASTA!!! Employees should really be trained better, if someone has an allergy please don't lie to them. I'm very disappointed my server lied. He never sent a manager over to address the situation, but he took my food off. I appreciate the gesture but an allergy isn't something that should be played with."
Caroline A.,"Rockville, MD",31,25,1,2.0,8/25/2017,"Went here to get lunch with my mom, aunt, and cousins. Food was good except the there was a hair on my plate. And a chip in my honey mustard sauce; when no one ordered anything with chips in it. The mango ice tea is a diabetics nightmare."
Ian S.,"Gaithersburg, MD",247,39,6,1.0,2/26/2017,"If i could give 0 stars i would.  Been here a couple times before, service was always 2-3 star but the food is on the cheaper side and the games are always on, but today we showed up at 1:15 and were seated at a hightop.  Waited 15 minutes, no server ever came, THEN a family was seated directly next to us, and their server got to their table 1 minute later.  As we were walking out, their guy at the door told us to have a nice day, we responded that it would have been if we were able to be served.  The guy said ""oh"". Sh#t service, won't be returning."
Sary S.,"Germantown, MD",51,3,,1.0,5/7/2017,"We went here today for a late lunch with my family, we sat there and waited for 10 min before I flagged down a waitress and asked her who was taking care of us. The waiter finally came over, took our drinks and appetizers order, 10 more minutes went by and he came back, empty handed and asked us for our entrees order, he took the order and left. Almost half an hour sitting there and we still didn't have our drinks, not even water. Needless to say our experience was ruined by then, and with two hungry kids things weren't pretty. The food, well not our favorite.  We've been there a few times, but this is by far the worst experience we've ever had. I am in the restaurant business, and I totally understand when is busy and your running around with multiple tables, but it was over 2pm and it wasn't busy at all. Very disappointed..."
Kate P.,"Germantown, MD",91,24,2,3.0,9/2/2017,"Food is mediocre, but you can't beat the happy hour beer and food specials! Sandy is hands down the best employee there. I dread walking into the bar to see any other bartenders working! She is always so prompt and attentive to any customer's needs!"
Celena A.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,1,,5.0,8/28/2017,My sisters and me enjoyed ourselves. We were quickly seated. Our server was on point. The food was served quick and hot. For drinks we tried the blackberry lemonade. Fantastic. Appetizers were abundant and the onion rings were huge.My sisters had the Classic Combo while I tried the 2 for 25 meal deal( ribs). Great atmosphere and food. We'll definetly be returning.
Olga C.,"Germantown, MD",294,6,8,5.0,2/18/2017,"Love this place ! My husband and I went to Applebee's for the first time and we feel very good here. Our waitress, Ingrid, was very friendly, quick and helpful with suggestions. We tried many things and like them all - beef nachos (app), Asian chicken wings, 4-cheese mac, mash potato with steak. Will comeback soon."
David G.,"Montgomery Village, MD",0,2,2,5.0,2/24/2017,Come here all the time great place. Good good  Great staff. Very nice place. Open late
TJ B.,"Gaithersburg, MD",87,428,1480,3.0,12/12/2015,"I've avoided this place because of the poor reviews, but they were unwarranted.  The place is clean, friendly with good kid's meals and fast service. We went on a Friday night.  Packed house, 5 minute wait.  Our order was taken promptly and there was never a lack of friendly servers, food runners or managers in the area if we needed anything.  They also had a game system on the table to keep the kids entertained if the crayons and coloring menus didn't do the trick. Kid's meals were $5 which included an entree, side and drink. They had $6 kid's meals which were a little bigger.  The meals were very small, but so are their appetites so I didn't mind.  One of the kids had a house salad as their side and it was great. Adult meals seem to be $10-$18.  Portions are small and the food is what you'd expect from a typical American franchise.  I didn't see anything that blew me away, but sometimes a fast affordable meal in a clean friendly environment is what you need.   They had a little bit of everything. If you need a killer burger, go to Red Robin.  If you want great ribs, go to Famous Dave's.  If you want larger portions & a better bar, drive up to Bennigans, but if you want a large variety close to home, give it a try. If anything, for me it was a reminder that sometimes you just have to see the restaurant for yourself, and not lean too heavy on the reviews."
James A.,"Germantown, MD",31,38,,5.0,7/7/2017,"It has been a while since I walked into this location.  The customer service and bar was horrible.  Today, Manager Dan White and some servers were there greeting and it felt so welcoming.  Sat at the bar and Ciara and Sandy was so happy and jolly and welcoming.  It made me feel like a was the only person at the bar. So happy to see that this location stepped up there customer service and employee comradely.  Thank you for hiring a great staff."
Robert F.,"Montgomery Village, MD",34,3,1,1.0,11/18/2016,"Late night....no smiles, no greeting, (unless ""youneedamenu"" constitutes a greeting, no ""how's your burger?) ...friendly isn't spoken here.....cleaning is the only priority....Yeimy, needs something...more sleep, more training, an appreciation for her position....I see this to frequently in the so called service industry.... *burger overcooked *FF cold *no check back *no guest interaction ..in all fairness the other bartenders here are on point!"
Brian R.,"Gaithersburg, MD",39,16,1,3.0,12/27/2016,"We had a Person in Our Party with Food Allergies and Told Server about it. we said no Berry's, Pork, Bacon for her.He said OK. We Ordered Appetizers and she wanted the Mac and Cheese and Chicken with no sauce.  He said he can do it  We ask him to get the Manager 3-4 Time's nothing to do with him but he Never did and I'm Sorry that is Rude. 30 Minutes to get drinks cause he Couldn't Remember the Order Cause you don't write it down and the place was dead. No Drink Special's No Special's at the Bar. No one in the place I wonder why...  we get the food and he said my bad  We Couldn't Change the Order for her. What The F*^$ !!! We all got food but her and you couldn't come tell us sooner. She switched for something else. The Location has and Keep's Going down hill. I used to come every Week But you Change the Menu Change The 2 for 20 and Charge more for Steak I AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COAST'S  Piss poor Service"
Sharon G.,"Gaithersburg, MD",204,276,106,4.0,5/9/2016,"I stopped in on April 27, 2016 to use up a $25 gift certificate. While being seated, I was excited to see the computerized gaming console on the table, but disappointed to learn there is a charge to play. I ordered the chicken and shrimp with red potatoes dish. It arrived sizzlin' hot, but where was all the food I ordered for $15????? I took a picture of my dish, ate my meal and had plenty of room for dessert so I ordered the $1.99 brownie bite. Now THAT was the perfect amount. One small heated brownie and a small scoop of vanilla ice cream."
Ruth H.,"Tysons, VA",49,13,6,1.0,1/6/2017,"Won't make a mistake coming here again. Pros: seated quickly Food came quick  Cons: bill was messed up cause kiosks on table were switched w another table, food was disgusting, how do u run out of baked potatoes?!"
JoshNavy 9.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,2,,4.0,6/9/2017,Perfectly done chicken. Very open to my requests and listened. I felt heard here. Mac and cheese had the perfect amount of pepper not too much not too little. Fries were very good sort of bland.
D.L. C.,"Washington, DC",25,63,7,1.0,3/21/2017,"See my tip. Awful old fashioned. Overpriced and nobody knows what the hell they're doing.  Sure, the place is a chain joint but an old fashioned should not be tasting like goat piss. This place is absolutely horrible. At one point,  they made the drink decent. Egg on my face for trying to support local. If you want a good old fashioned in the area, go to the local Grillmarx."
Amy J.,"Montgomery Village, MD",0,8,,1.0,4/26/2017,"This place is gross, it stinks inside the booth was dirty, The waiter was slow and clueless. It took 15 mins for waiter to bring our drinks. The place was empty, I ordered tacos that were topped with coleslaw the smell of that was bad and old. Returned that. I came with a friend, I came here maybe 10 years ago and didn't like it. My friend says she goes there often yuck !  She offered me to try her food I didn't like that either. The food is not fresh at all she had chicken it was a rubbery texture. I will never return to this place."
Kel M.,"Germantown, MD",0,10,1,1.0,8/31/2017,"Carside to go service is the worst. Had so many bad experiences there. Contacted corporate, but I don't think much has changed. We decided not to go there purely because of service. Food is not bad, but it's definitely not good."
Vanessa T.,"Germantown, MD",35,13,18,5.0,11/17/2015,I really like the food in this place. They have really good drinks and dishes! And the best part is that they have updated the menu with more delicious things.  In this occasion I'm trying the new cedar grilled lemon chicken which is very good and tasty with rice mix with quinoa and cranberries.
Ana P.,"Gaithersburg, MD",23,502,1794,4.0,6/11/2014,"I was pretty impressed with Applebee's! I was told it was similar to Ruby Tuesday's or Friday's, but I would prefer Applebee's over both! Our waitress, Kadi, was super sweet and the food was so great! I got the crunchy shrimp and BP ordered one of the steaks. The portions were very generous for being on the two for $25 menu. I was delighted by how crunchy my shrimp really were. Not even one of the literately 20 on my plate were soggy. The red potatoes on BP skillet were great, as was the steak. Cooked medium well, it was perfect."
Michael A.,"Germantown, MD",0,30,5,5.0,11/5/2016,"Very good place for traditional American food!  Usually go to this location regularly with my family and always enjoy dinner experience.  Service is always on par, food quality is great and have a good time, overall.  Ordered a few times for take-out and service was great that way, too.  Location is fine from our residence and in a nice shopping center."
Amber M.,"Bethesda, MD",154,30,15,5.0,4/27/2017,I just love this Applebees. I had never been a regular to an Applebee's ever. Robin always takes great care of us. She's the best. My girlfriend and I came here on our first date months ago and we always make sure to sit in robins section. She's super attentive and always willing to get whatever we need. The only con is that the bathrooms could use a little extra attention but I'm always greeted by a friendly host or hostess and seated quickly. The food is really delicious. I always try something new and the drinks are divine. I've only ever had one drink that wasn't so hot but Robin substituted it for something else and made it so that I only paid for the other drink that I actually drank and enjoyed. She's always looking out and a friendly face. Thanks for always providing a great experience for us! We come back as often as we can! :)
Brad G.,"Stafford, VA",0,6,4,1.0,9/21/2015,"Everything was dirty, table, silverware, dishes, and food was not like other Applebee's."
Jaime C.,"RIVERDALE, MD",1,3,,1.0,9/30/2016,"RODOLFO E. was TERRIBLE, he was our waiter. We've been there before but this time it was 60% full, we sat at the table for 15min before he even got our drinks. We had to ask another waitress if she could get him to take our drink order. There was much more but Long story short he rushed us, rolled his eyes (constantly) and was rude. I'm sure he was mad because we got another waitress to go get him so he took it upon himself to give up and just be rude and hasty the whole time. The sad part is I always tip around 25-50% but only gave him 10%. ***You get what you give*** (food was great, compliments to the chef)"
Sergio P. T.,"Rockville, MD",4,95,73,2.0,12/21/2015,People are great but food has taken a slow dive over the years. Menu should have been left alone. They added fried honey chicken to Mac and Cheese and the oil and glaze from it overpower the Mac and cheese. You sit at a table with a tablet device and it has a trivia playing. You find our moments later that if you actually stated plying they charge you $1.00  No big deal but someone should advise you as you're being seated. This was probably my last visit to one of bold time neighborhood favorites.
A. J.,"Gaithersburg, MD",8,20,,3.0,8/31/2016,"We haven't been to Applebee's in awhile and were pleasantly surprised at the varied menu. It took awhile to decide on a choice. I chose the Cedar Plank Salmon and got the maple glaze on the side. However, I ended up using it all as the salmon, though properly done, was rather tasteless. It was not presented as nicely as the photo, but what dish ever is? It was nice enough. The roasted veggies were perfectly done. My husband had a steak and roasted potato dish. The photo on the menu showed the meat sliced but it came in one piece. It was tender and tasty.  The Margarita was satisfactory. Will go back to try some other dishes."
Erin M.,"Davie, FL",337,227,24,1.0,7/13/2015,I had food poisoning from them around Christmas and have refused to go back ever since!  The customer service was great and apologetic but I can't get over the feeling of the food poisoning
Chanelle B.,"Gaithersburg, MD",14,37,35,4.0,1/3/2016,We always come here ! And it's good every time . We bring our kids and food is hot and ready !
Michelle R.,"Frederick, MD",0,23,13,1.0,7/13/2014,Terrible. Ordered to go Caesar salad. It was only lettuce and croutons.  Turkey sandwich was dry Tortilla soup was MUSH and not edible
Stuart W.,"Damascus, MD",2,86,,1.0,5/4/2015,"Up until last night we'd always enjoyed going to Applebee's. But a terrible server named Danny's appaling service means we are unlikely to come back again now. We arrived at 8:38pm, within a minute I saw Danny and he made eye contact with me, but instead of greeting us just proceeded to serve the larger table next to us. He then went and came back to their table twice without even acknowledging us. Only when the large table of people left did he serve us - we waited 10 minutes to even be greeted! Absolute disgrace.  Then when he took our order, we waited for our drinks. 10 minutes later we still didn't have our drinks. We looked over to see him just sitting at the bar chatting to a girl, and we proceeded to walk out. It doesn't take 10 minutes to make and bring us a couple of drinks. This guy just didn't care about us and honestly we don't feel he should be working as a server at Applebee's if this is the level of service he provides. In addition, the volume level of the music at this location is way too loud, we could barely have a conversation because of it."
Gary G.,"Montgomery Village, MD",87,5,10,4.0,11/23/2014,I frequent here from time to time.  Never have a bad experience.  Food is always good.  Sometimes more than I can eat in one setting.  Really like the southwestern salad nice and spicy.
Sabir U.,"Long Beach, CA",208,122,140,1.0,2/23/2016,"If I could give this place no stars I would. Not because of the food or the staff at large, but rather a single incident that occurred here with one particular waitress. And although my problem is singular to one occasion and person, it was so impactful that it was hands down, the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  So basically I came here with a bunch of friends. There were about 10-12 of us and this group was primarily Hispanic, Black, and Asian. We ordered drinks with one waitress but she wasn't actually our waitress. Everything was going pretty normal but then our waitress came over. She introduced herself and was a very bubbly, 20 something-ish blonde, white woman. Very quickly, things shifted. She said, ""hey so we're all young and trying to work and do our own things and so I just want to be straight forward and make sure you guys know to pay before you go and I hope we won't have any problems because none of the other waiters/waitresses wanted to serve you guys."" Um, whoa, time out. Let's take a pause. Excuse me?? So I say to her, ""I'm not sure where this is coming from but it's extremely rude. You don't even know us."" And she says, ""what's rude is you guys coming in here and leaving without paying. We have to work and earn our money and you guys just leave without paying your bill or leaving a tip."" When I told her that none of us had come to this restaurant before she then proceeded to call us liars and specifically pointed out two of my friends who apparently dined and dashed (again, none of us had been there before). By now I was ready to take the hoop rings off and smear some Vaseline. But you know I was trying to be a good person and not whoop some a** in a family establishment so I took my group out of there. This was so clearly racism, prejudice, discrimination, generalization, and all the other terms. It was so wrong I still can't believe it happened. Never again will I be going to an Applebee's, that's for damn sure."
Che N.,"Clarksburg, MD",0,27,1,1.0,12/5/2016,"The greeter/hostess was very nice.  We got a table right away.  Our waiter was very nice, but food came out Super slow.  The food was disappointing.  The portions were small and the presentation was below average. My husband ordered the all you can eat riblets. The 1 st plate was very small, but lots of French fries.  When he asked for more riblets, it took another 30 minutes before we got another small plate of riblets and lots of fries.   You would literally have to sit here for hours to eat the all you can eat riblets.  Not worth it.  Very annoying.  Will not be back and would not recommend applebees at all to anyone. The quality of the food was also below average."
