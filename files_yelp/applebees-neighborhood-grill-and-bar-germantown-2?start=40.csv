SpicyLady A.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,7,1,2.0,2/17/2015,"Ordered take out tonight about 2 hours before my husband was to pick it up. It was still not ready when he arrived. His dinner came with the wrong sides, my son's cheeseburger was literally a patty an inch in diameter and his strawberries and yogurt consisted of a huge tub of yogurt and half a sliced strawberry. They also didn't put his drink in the bag. What food we did get was good, but I don't think we'll be ordering here again."
A. O.,"Germantown, MD",0,5,,3.0,12/23/2016,"Applebee's is our ""go-to"" restaurant.  It is convenient for us and the price is right.  The food is flavorful and service is okay."
Steve P.,"Germantown, MD",0,55,70,4.0,6/20/2015,"New menus for everyone - including the kids! Good to see simple improvements as such. Food remains good. Not daring to see if loaded potato remains a ""fix it yourself"" option. Mashed potatoes are a delicious alternative."
Ren C.,"Rockville, MD",6,29,6,1.0,3/15/2016,"Service was incredibly slow. Waitstaff was apologetic, but we waited almost two hours to get our food. The wait wasn't even worth it because I couldn't even recognize what I ordered from the mess that was on my plate. Quality was just not there. Skip this restaurant. Food is overpriced anyway."
Elizabeth W.,"Gaithersburg, MD",295,188,360,4.0,9/6/2013,"I read the other reviews, but  I have to say I disagree. I had no problems and the food was great. It's been awhile since I've been here, and I was pleasantly surprised. We got the new food: Mozzarella Sticks Queso Blanco Honey Pepper Chicken and Shrimp Nappa Chicken & Portobellos (only 450 calories) 4-Cheese Mac & Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders Riblet Basket For 3 people, this was a lot of food. We got one 2 for $20 (chicken and shrimp & riblets) and one 2 for $24 (nappa chicken & 4-mac). All of the food was delicious. The Nappa Chicken was by far my favorite. Food at Applebee's just doesn't get any better than this. The 4-mac and the Honey pepper sauce sure gave that nappa chicken a run for it's money though. Did I say I was in heaven? Service: We got Kadi, and she was not bad. We sat in the bar area and she kept our drinks filled, the food came fast, and we were well attended. I was happy. Also, come on people, it's Applebee's. Chain restaurants are a special breed. Find a good server, find the delicious food at every chain and be happy!"
Ibidapo O.,"Beltsville, MD",108,4,1,1.0,1/30/2016,Terrible customer service. Waiter messed up orders at different tables in his section and manager seemed confused. Food was ok but the vegetables were not well cooked. Don't come here in the evenings. The afternoon crew is much better
Kim A.,"Silver Spring, MD",146,393,26,4.0,1/23/2015,I love this spot ... Waitress was the best waitress I had In my life . She was conversational . And when we asked her for stuff she didn't forget to bring it . She told me she's only been working there for 4 years . Wish I got her name . The food wow delicious . I haven't had fresh food in a while . The appetizers we're huge they gave us a lot of mozerella sticks and boneless wings . They said appetizers are half off after 9. I told my man I like her ... He gave her a good tip . 4 stars because bathroom was filthy ..and the service here is inconsistent
Abc A.,"Germantown, MD",18,37,1,4.0,8/13/2016,Thank you Jasmine M for the great service this afternoon!!! We were sitting at the high tops and ordered salad and burgers.
Ataya P.,"Germantown, MD",183,164,229,4.0,12/20/2014,"So close to home and affordable. My mom and I like to come here time to time for our girls night out. It's so easy to get things off the 2 for $20 or 2 for $25 menu. I do not recommend the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp... lacked flavor, I ended up asking for a side of bbq sauce. I will not be ordering that again. Simply put... I recommend anything with bbq sauce!! :)"
Jrue S.,"Gaithersburg, MD",12,7,1,3.0,3/5/2016,"Not as great as it used to be, but still gets the job done. Was craving some for American so decided to stop by with the family. Service is a little slow, but they managed with a packed restaurant on a Saturday night.  I had the full rack of ribs and there was nothing to complain about. Definitely get the wonton tacos though, those are delicious. Just your average restaurant- haven't run into problems, but haven't experienced anything to make it an especially great restaurant. Great place to catch up with family, coworkers, or a fun date."
Donna G.,"Gaithersburg, MD",35,7,,5.0,12/5/2015,Stephan the server was awesome! His food recommendations were good.  I love this location!
Tiff G.,"Rockville, MD",26,47,18,4.0,4/1/2015,Food is always good and drinks are even better. Good service and a nice low-key spot. Try there 2 for $20 deals they can't be beat
Melanie K.,"Clarksburg, MD",33,225,158,3.0,2/25/2014,"We came in for dinner on Sunday night because we had a gift card. IMO, Applebee's is one of the better ""neighborhood grill"" type chains and is good for a cheap, relatively quick dinner. We've been to this location numerous times and we usually have a pretty good experience. With that in mind, we always sit in the lower bar area. There, the service has always been great. This time around, we got put in a corner booth to the right of the main entrance. No craft brews or anything ""different"" in terms of beer, but the sangria is good. I usually get the Red Apple Sangria, but went for the White Peach Sangria this time around. We almost always go for the 2 for $20 menu items because it's such a great deal, but we wanted to try the Grilled Chicken Wonton Tacos, which were surprisingly delicious. They were crunchy and packed with flavor. When it came to our entrees, we both opted to get the Fiesta Chicken Chopped Salad. The dressing was a little vinegary, but overall was good. Our server was the only thing that didn't make this a 4-star experience this time around. It's not that he was unfriendly, but he wasn't particularly friendly or likable, either. I can appreciate a server who's not in-your-face, kiss-your-butt, overly-excited, but this guy was just kinda slow-moving and ""meh."" He just seemed to do the bare minimum."
Yue L.,"Potomac, MD",7,11,,1.0,11/18/2013,"We went on a weekend night and the food was awful. Everything was soooooooooo Salty, even the steak was so salty from outside to inside, which we really didn't understand. We want the steak to be medium cooked, and it came in as fully cooked. I've been to Applebees at different places and this is the first time I was so very disappointed. The manager came and we want to brought to his attention that we were concerned with the food. But he acted very defensive, keep inferring that it's our problem, because the food came in the same way, and their is no way the chef or the store could do anything wrong. Will never go there again and would not recommend to anyone."
John H.,"Boyds, MD",55,85,20,3.0,5/4/2014,I usually come after a long day at work for the half off appetizers after 9. They aren't bad. I like the BBQ wings and nachos.  Entrees are nothing to write home about.  Service is hit or miss.  I used to do karaoke there but last I heard they axed that. Too bad.
Michael R.,"Frederick, MD",16,16,,2.0,11/21/2013,"Tonight we went to this place for dinner and my wife ordered the Low Calorie Pepper Steak and I had the low calorie 7 oz Sirloin. The Pepper Steak was ordered to be cooked medium. Well the steak came out looking grey on the outside and ""RAW"" on the inside. It looked like road kill. Now my steak was good and my wife's replacement chicken was good. The manager did come over and apologize for the poor looking steak. The server was good and the ambience is your typical bar/restaurant.  Overall the food was just OK and the price for what we got wasn't that reasonable considering the poor food quality and the manager really didn't do much to have a repeat customer. It was more like the lip service approach.  This is just my opinion on my experience here."
Crystal N.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,19,7,4.0,8/11/2015,My kids love the Mac & cheese and BBQ boneless wings here.  Food aren't that bad. I like their Napa Chicken & Portobellos and French Onion Soup.  They are getting busy. Customer service is improving.
Disha L.,"Sterling, VA",0,12,2,1.0,10/11/2016,"We visited Apple Bees of Germantown on Sunday the 9th of October. This girl name Mauryana who attended to us, took off our order. She forgot bring the sliver ware after she served our order. One of my friend's birthday was on that day and I requested her for the surprise birthday wishes and cake which we were ready to pay for. She did say sure. But later didn't turn up even after we paid the the check and waited for whole 15 mins after that. We reminded her twice but she ignored us and was busy chatting with the other staff at the reception. She did see us waiting but she turned blind on us. I was going to call for the manager who was no where insight. Later we gave up and left and she did see us leaving while she was chatting off with the receptionist. We told to her never mind and she said bye to us shamelessly. We will never visit this Apple Bees ever again where such a kind of treatment is give to the customers."
Katie M.,"Germantown, MD",0,4,,4.0,4/10/2016,"I gotta say, I had a tiny issue when I first came in. Their staff was more than amazing. Applebees customer service was amazing! There were four people in particular who made my experience lovely. Robel, Devon, Macx and the hostess. (I'm sorry, I didn't catch her name.) All of the guests who were with me really enjoyed their food, and we would greatly recommend this place to anyone! Thank you."
Susan L.,"College Park, MD",0,14,2,2.0,6/13/2015,"I went here with two other people. The service and atmosphere were great, but the food wasn't that great. We only went because we had a coupon, but will probably dine somewhere else. We were seated very promptly and our server was friendly and helpful. We ordered the half and half appetizer for $9 with sriracha shrimp and honey bbq double crunch wings. They forgot to give us small plates for the appetizers. The potions of the appetizer were ok; five shrimps and five wings. The shrimps and wings were a good size and very tasty.  The entrees were OK but didn't really taste that great. I got honey bbq ribs with fries and mixed vegetables. The ribs were a little dry and didn't have that much meat on them. They were similar to the type of ribs you find at a buffet. The mixed vegetables were like the cheap frozen kind you get at the grocery store boiled in sugar water. The other two people got two different steaks, with sides of potatoes, rice, and broccoli. One steak entree was ~$19, which was cooked perfectly but didn't taste that great at all. I would rather spend $19 for a steak somewhere else like longhorn. The other steak was better. I was still hungry afterwards.  Even with the coupon, I thought it was expensive for lackluster food. Maybe we didn't order the right things or fully utilized promotions. Although service was good, we're not coming back."
