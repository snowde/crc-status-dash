Harris H.,"Germantown, MD",63,223,7,1.0,10/13/2015,"Horrible experience.  We actually had a gift car to another restaurant but my wife saw a tv ad for the burger with the egg.  She insisted we go try it so I agreed.  First, let me say the service was fine due to the fact it was very busy.  Her burger came out and the egg was so dead she laughed and sent the runner back to get another one.  On the commercial the egg is runny, but this one was burnt on the outside and almost hard boiled inside.  Not sure how they could even think about putting it on the burger unless the cook was new.  My burger came out, which was the mushroom swiss, and at first glance it seemed good.  I took a couple bites into it and it was so plain and tasteless.  I then put ketchup on it and continued eating.  About 1/2 way through my burger, I made a comment to my wife that I have never had a mushroom swiss burger without some type of sauce on it.  She mentioned she saw it had it when looking at the menu and immediately pulled the online menu up on her phone.  She had plenty of time as she still hadn't gotten her egg.  Turns out my burger was supposed to have sauce, but didn't, which explained how bland and boring it was.  How the heck does the cook forget one of the main ingredients of the burger? Finally her egg came out, and she got to eat her cold burger as I was already done my meal.  Just a bad experience all the way around.  We both agreed we should have gone with our first instincts and gone to the other restaurant.  It really is bad to pay $12/burger to get this quality.  We could have gone to BGR, or a number of other places and faired much better for similar or even less money.  I tried to write corporate but apparently they let you get all the way to submit, then it tells you it can't do it and try again."
G Hinson W.,"Germantown, MD",0,2,,3.0,7/4/2014,"When this restaurant opened many years ago, I gave it a try.  Was not at all happy but a year or so later, gave it another shot.  Same results.  Now, about 10-12 years later, I decided to try it again figuring that it has some staying power so management must have got their act together.   I went on a Friday with my wife and a friend.  The The hostess was very nice, and seated us promptly. Restaurant was clean and well staffed.   I wanted to try the ""two for twenty"" meal they had been pushing on TV so we ordered from that menu. I ordered the 7oz Sirloin, my wife got the chicken penne.  Appetizers were served promptly and were delicious. I must admit that I normally don't like onion rings but these were great.  The wait for the food was appropriate so there was not a big gap between the time we finished the appetizers and when the entrees were brought.  Everything went downhill from there.  My steak looked great and was cooked as ordered but it was like jerky. Now I do not expect top-of-the line steak at a restaurant such as this but if you are going to put steak on the menu, it should at least be edible.   My wife's order was ok but our friend got a tough steak also. I managed to get through about 3ozs of the 7oz steak and gave up.  I asked for a box to take the balance home to my dog (she has a much stronger bite than me) and asked for the manager to come over.  I explained and expected an apology and possibly a discount or no-charge for the steak. What I go, floored me.  The manager apologized but then, she said that she didn't like the 7oz sirloin either.  She then listed a few of the options that she felt were much better than the steak and explained that for steak, she preferred ""Ruth's chris steak house.""  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.    She then offered a ""brownie bite"" as a condolence. When I got the bill, I saw that I had been charged for the brownie bite.  To her credit though, I was given a 20% discount that I hadn't expected. I mentioned the charge to the server and it was taken off. Unfortunately, there is nothing about this experience that would make me want to return to this restaurant."
Janice H.,"Montgomery Village, MD",9,15,,1.0,1/21/2013,"What Happened to Applebees? They are slipping!!  We had not been to Applebees since my youngest was a Toddler and when I was pregnant with him I craved their Santa Fe chicken salad. We got a gift card from one of my husbands clients for Christmas and decided to get carryout since our son was sick.  I think they short change the carryout customers on purpose. The Buns on the Burgers were hard and cold already. The burgers were nothing to write home about and the fries were all of the butt fries, you know the small little hard pieces of fries not the crisp full regular fries they probably serve to dining in guests. We live 8 minutes away and alraedy in that time the food was ice cold. I can say that we will not be back. If he gets another gift card we will donate it to charity. Applebees get it together!"
Christie G.,"Germantown, MD",2,11,,2.0,2/26/2015,"The food is decent.  We had a pretty bad experience here and haven't been back. On the positive side, the service has always been very good for us in the past."
Frankie D.,"Brookeville, MD",6,6,1,1.0,11/6/2015,"Food was great! Service was ok. Management was terrible to say the least. I had spoken with the manger on shift tonight, after having our meal, about the lack of service by our waiter. I was kind and polite and had little to say. The manger proceeded to agree with me and try to brush me off. I walked a short distance to turn around and find the manger speaking with our waiter joking with him,  both laughing in joy. Now im not saying he was speaking ill of me and my party but it sure did seem that way. Our waiter then proceeded to provide us with some more bad service. My fiancé having to walk up to him to then grab her credit card. Because he wanted us to wait on him. Now I'm sorry but isn't his job title a waiter and isn't he suppose to WAIT on us. My point being I will never eat here again not due to the lack of good food, but the lack of good service for which I am paying for and tipping for........."
Rick R.,"Selbyville, DE",74,85,13,3.0,6/20/2013,"It's Applebee's.  A customer told the waitress that at the other Applebee's, they fill her margarita to the top and put extra on the side.  With that kind of clientele what can you expect?"
Sonia C.,"Germantown, MD",128,40,3,4.0,11/16/2014,Love onion soup. The wonton appetizers are a must! Great food and reasonable priced. Especially the 2 for 20. Get 1 appetizer 2 salads & 2 meals is a steal
Stephanie D.,"Germantown, MD",111,17,2,1.0,9/11/2012,"Came here for a quick and easy dinner.  The good:  My bf got the steak and was pleasantly surprised.  My mango mojito was pretty tasty...but instant headache. The ugly:  I got the bourbon chicken and shrimp...disaster.  The whole meal was over-seasoned for my taste.  I realize it's blackened chicken...but it just didn't work.  The real kicker though is the shrimp came out raw.  I sent it back and it came out BARELY cooked the second time.  I realize the meal is served on a searing plate, but a) the raw shrimp was on top of my cooked chicken and b) even after sitting on the sizzling plate the shrimp had not cooked by the end of the meal.  Seriously disappointing even by Applebee's standards."
Ja'Bette L.,"Germantown, MD",150,109,39,3.0,8/25/2010,"Please don't hold it against me. Especially when I'm admitting to my fellow yelpers that I actually ate and enjoyed my meal here.  I haven't stepped foot into an Applebee's in probably seven years. Maybe I got lucky, but the steak I had was pretty tasty and cooked perfectly. Of course, it is possible that alongside my ice cold Blue Moon, even cardboard would taste good.  My server Diedre made my experience that much better. No plans to go back, but thanks for the good time anyway."
Whitney R.,"Gaithersburg, MD",15,51,,2.0,1/31/2014,Our server was super nice! The food was Aweful! The steaks were a joke at best. I will never return.
Hung T.,"Washington, DC",156,190,162,1.0,10/29/2011,"Wow Applebees. Do you buy everything from Costco? No wait, even Costco food would taste 100x better than the crap you served. I usually dont write reviews for chain restaurants like these but this deserves one.  Everything we got tasted like it was either microwaved, overcooked, or 1 week old.  Fries - stale Chicken fingers - hard, not crispy Steak - chewy, no flavor, no juice, overcooked Salad - like 1 week old rabbit food Never again. Go spend your money elsewhere people! You would be happier at McDonalds than here."
Nady B.,"Washington, DC",0,5,7,4.0,1/8/2011,I always enjoyed this place...the food was good. the drink was cheap and good too. Had a great time with the family and will return again. It was crowded and we waited to be seated for about 10 min. love their fries! will come back!
William S.,"Gaithersburg, MD",19,73,5,3.0,3/29/2012,"I got a gift card to this chain and avoided using it forever.    One day I decided I had to use the card and I didn't care if I had a horrible meal. With my ultra low expectations I went to this Applebee's and ordered their sirloin steak.   I was going to order it rare since these things are always over cooked at these chains but I ordered it medium rare and it came out perfect.    Oddly, it had great flavor and I left there really impressed.   I don't know how they did it but my food was great.  I haven't gone back because I don't expect them to be able to repeat it but I have to given them an A-OK."
Shane W.,"Kansas City, MO",162,315,54,2.0,9/3/2011,"I'm not proud that I ate here but five of us met from a couple different states to meet with a client. The new guy suggested we meet at Applebee's (it's okay, we told him never to do that again). Every single Applebee's is the same. Why am I even writing this? Four out of five meals were correct, that's pretty good really. One salad and reuben came as salad and french onion soup and the server apologized and asked if they wanted the reuben. Well, yeah. I had a side salad and tomato basil soup. Nothing wrong with it except they found a way to add un-needed calories to tomato soup by adding bread crumbs and cheese. Oh, and the music was a little loud for noon. It was a short loop of 80's pop and rock.  In general everyone was satisfied but we agreed nothing spectacular just happened."
Jess P.,"Silver Spring, MD",226,189,140,1.0,5/30/2013,"My first experience at an Applebees in a nutshell:  I will never return.  Thank you TINA, you made history in horrible service.   I remember the food being alright-- nothing at all memorable.  Especially because of the service that we received.  It is almost to a point where I would say I prefer lack of service.  We were pressured to pay, even before we got our food.. Then constantly after that.  In all honesty, I understand if it is the end of your shift.  But it's really unfair to be rushed.  We wanted to drink more than 1 beer, and we definitely wanted to order a lot more food.     I'm sure other locations are better.  Maybe I would have been able to enjoy the food, without the evil waitress."
Kimberly G.,"Washington, DC",0,3,,1.0,9/26/2014,ROACHES! If it were possible to give 0 stars I would. A roach crawled across the table as we were siting at it. The manager handled the situation terribly. I have never been so disgusted.
Jim B.,"Hagerstown, MD",5,25,12,4.0,1/27/2014,One of my favorite places. Blackened Bleu Burger is amazing. Get it cooked medium. Steak smothered in shrimp is also fantastic. Great kids menu as well!
Kimberly Y.,"Germantown, MD",0,3,,1.0,4/23/2015,I used to go to this Applebee's often because it is very close to my home until one day I ordered the boneless wings which I love and their was a dead bug in the sauce. I was so upset especially after I had eaten half the dish. That was 5 months ago and I will never ever eat there again.
Nikon H.,"Germantown, MD",82,58,91,1.0,8/4/2014,"I am sick of going there and giving them try after try. Nothing seems to get better. My family went there a few months ago and the service was horrible the waiter gave me cold coffee then my husband veggie with his steak came out with ice on them. The manager had to comp our whole meal I was done. Well tonight my niece wanted to go and I was like NO. But I gave I and Sean was our waiter. He was all over the place, in the middle of our drink order he just walked away. Then he returned and said sorry. But then as I was giving him the drink order again he seems not to be listening or his mind was working faster then his hand. Then he toke my app order and he was hearing stuff like did u want wings and the only thing I said was spinach dip. He brought our app out with no plates. Every time I go there the services gets worst. Just done with this place. Please get servers that care or at least want to work."
Archie M.,"Clarksburg, MD",2,36,9,1.0,2/5/2013,Had two consecutive bad experiences with this restaurant in the area of customer service 6 years ago and never turned back. Their food not bad. But servers I dealt with during dinner time were bad. Just bad. Won't give then a chance anytime soon unless they give me a reason to.
