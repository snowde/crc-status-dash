Katie P.,"Germantown, MD",3,16,,2.0,8/24/2010,"Overall, I would say this is the worst Applebee's I've ever been to. Slow on refilling drinks. Forgetting things like ketchup for your fries. Being seated in the corner then forgotten. Having 16 year old servers spilling our beers as he brought them over. Oh, and the #1 worst thing: bringing out the main dish right after the appetizer! However, our last visit (which my husband and I both said would be our last if we experienced the same low level of service and poor quality of food) was great. It seemed like they may have changed management, as the woman (I forget her name) came over to make sure everything was ok. We ordered off of the 2 for $20 menu and the food was served quickly, hot, and delicious (well, for Applebees). We now no longer rule out this place when deciding where to go for a quick bite to eat. They also have great happy hour and late night (after 930 on weekdays) specials. Last visit brought this place up from 1 star to 2. Hope our next experience here is similarly as enjoyable."
Rima B.,"Germantown, MD",0,6,,5.0,11/26/2014,I always get carry out from Applebee's 2 for $20 deal. I have to mention the Managers who are extremely niceand friendly . The 2 names who come to my mind are Michelle and Robel. Michelle even wrote for me that I could substitute Chicken burgers instead of Beef on Mondays as I don't eat beef.
Oscar S.,"Germantown, MD",74,69,3,1.0,2/7/2012,"What do say when you order a steak (yes, I know it's Applebee's) medium rare and it comes out cripsy: 4th mistake. and.. What do you say when they bring you back the steak with a cow's tail still on it: 3th mistake. and.. What do you say when they send back the mooing cow back and return w/ beef jerky: 2nd mistake So.. What do you say when you make the desicion to go to Applebees for a quick dinner on a Tuesday night: 1st mistake!! Yup, this was the wonderful experience my girlfriend and I had this evening while dining at the fine establishment of Applebees in Germantown.  But it get's better.  So as you can tell they completely screwed up my steak (I know I know, it was Applebees), but the best part was how they reacted to it.   I know people make mistakes while you're out eating and sometimes things don't go they way they should.  But to completely screw up a meal and not even offer to take it off the bill or even a free desert, to me that's just unacceptable.  Oh, did I mention that I asked for cheese on my broccoli and that was screwed up too, lol.  And when they brought it back, it was burnt cheese on a plate w/ broccoli around it...uh.  Come on Applebees, we weren't expecting much but why?? So the manager by the name of Michelle C., comes up to apologize w/ the 3rd time they screwed up my steak.  And says, ""I'm sorry"".  I cut it and of course it's not right again.  At this point it's a hopeless cause.  I say, this is over cooked again but oh well.  Her answer, ""We have a new cook back there, sorry about that"".  Why is a new cook making steaks to the guests, and why is he the one fixing my steak?  So we say to her, well listen, not your fault but we're not going to pay for this steak.  Everything else is fine, but this is just unacceptable.  And she looks at me like she's confused.  So, I say again, you can take it back or leave it, but either way we're not paying for this.  Keep in mind this wasn't in an arguementive way, just being honest.  She says, well it's the 2 for $20 meal so I can't just take it off.  So we say, well ring up the app and my g/fs food and we'll pay for that.  So.....we get the bill.   She took $6.00 of the whole check.  Thanks.  I'm sorry but I used to be in the food industry for many years both on the waiting side and the bartender side.  And I guess I could say that though they were not the classiest of places(i.e. Bennigans, Fridays, Outback, Ruby Tuesdays), my managers never acted that way.  They all would have taken the meal off immediately offered some free desert, or taken more than $6.00 off the tab.   Needless to say, all we got (not that we were asking for free stuff) was a 10% off our next visit, which we won't use b/c we're not coming back, so we left that there for them and a horrible experience which could have been completely avoided just by better customer service. Needless to say, I did bring back the little piece of steak (Oh yeah, it was a freakin 7 oz strip, seriously how do you mess that up 3 times) and guess who enjoyed every little bit of it.....(drums....)  Buddy!!  My lab/husky mix pup!  I would've been extremely upset if even he didn't like lt either.  All in all, if you're going to go out for a quick bite, try McDonalds, they have really good smoothies, and at least you'll pay for what you get."
Gordon T.,"Greenbelt, MD",0,105,,3.0,5/31/2013,"I like it. Its not the greatest place in the world but its not as bad asw all these reviews are giving it. The food is cooked well its a little long of a wait but its worth it. The TVs should keep you occupied long enough. Not expensive and again the food is good, and the bathrooms are clean enough."
Karen G.,"Germantown, MD",0,2,,2.0,2/18/2014,"Friday night - not too busy when we walked in - had a ten minute wait.  We were seated and given menus.  No server came by for what seemed like forever.  Finally the manager must have noticed and he came over and took our drink orders.  After another long wait, a waiter came by and said he was helping out our waiter because our guy was busy.  We mentioned that the manager took our drink orders.  After a while, we got our drinks, but no one stopped by to take our order.  Oh, yeah - I guess it's because our waiter was still busy.  Finally the waiter who was ""helping out"" our waiter came by and took our order.  Food was okay.  Service was not great. Maybe we'll give it another chance someday.  Dunno."
Quinn W.,"Vienna, Austria",27,83,69,2.0,10/9/2011,"I think Applebee'ss has sunk down to the lows of their brand of food.  I tried the new chicken fried steak stack.  It is hard to mess that up, but the food was pretty bland.  I probably won't visit this location again, but on the positive, the service was good, and it was very close to my kid's soccer game, where we met some of his soccer mates at."
Windi L.,"Arlington, VA",91,497,172,3.0,8/17/2009,"Back when I lived in Washington State and lived in a more underdeveloped area, Applebee's was the place to be. The service was quick, drinks reasonably priced, and food was pretty decent. Actually, at the time it was the bomb diggity bomb bomb as I had yet to encounter any real non chain restaurants to compare it to.  On the way home from River Tubing, our group stopped in for some food. We were starved (as that's what River Tubing will do: dehydrate you and make you HUNGRY). We all looked like crap so we didn't want to do anything too fancy so we broke out our Blackberrys and found the nearest Applebee's. This one was it.  I have to say I was very disappointed with some of the aspects of this Applebee's compared to the ones back in WA. Our server was very nice and attentive however she was very slow. They were definitely understaffed. So slow, in fact, our food came back cold and had to be sent back. To add to the chaos, my burger had cheese. Attached to the cheese was the paper that separates cheese sliced. Fortunately, their manager at this location was reasonable and replaced my dish (I then ordered the french fries and chicken fingers) and did not charge me for my dish.  Everyone left feeling sick because their portions are huge but we left satisfied. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt because they are, well, a low budget chain joint and we all have off days. Food was decent, service decent and the things that did go wrong were fixed promptly."
Michael H.,"Germantown, MD",14,1,,2.0,8/7/2015,"We typically avoid Applebees due to several bad experiences in the past. We tried again and were seated near the window where the table was sticky from the lacquer finish having flaked off! Otherwise, the food was fine.  On our way out, we mentioned the sticky table to the hostess who said they've been telling management this for months and they've not done anything about it. I filled out a survey from the receipt, and to their credit, management called me to say they've fixed the tables, and asked me to come back - telling me they would discount 50% of my check for two people upon my return. We went back that night, and again the food was pretty good, but we unfortunately had an inexperienced server who would disappear for long periods of time, and at one point delivered dessert with no silverware. To make matters worse, the check was delivered and only had 20% off, not the 50% we were promised. Since the server was nowhere to be found, we calculated what the bill should have been, added tax and tip and had to seek out a manager to explain the situation and we paid in cash. Upon our return home, Applebees corporate management called again, but this time not to apologize for the poor service, but instead to accuse me of lying about the store manager offering me 50% off the check. Ridiculous.  The food and atmosphere keeps people coming in - as evidenced by the lines out the door, but even though this restaurant is very close to our home, we're displeased by the way we've been treated. For Applebees corporate management - a simple call to the store manager to verify his 50% discount offer followed by a sincere apology to us would help a lot, but insinuating that your customers are liars does not a good customer make."
Shahryar M.,"Germantown, MD",5,15,5,3.0,3/4/2012,"I walked in Saturday around midnight to quench an appetite for steak.  Got greeted and seated pretty fast.  Ordered a Ribeye with veges and fries and a sweet tea to drink.  I asked for my steak to be cooked medium and it didn't take too long for it to come out but about a third of the way into it, it was definitely medium well, some parts nearly cooked well done.  Plus, it tasted a bit on the dry and bit tough and ribeye steaks are supposed to be juicy and tender.  It took a bit of time for me to get some steak sauce, but overall the server did a good job.  The server was actually pretty friendly but lacked opinion, because when i asked for recommendations, she wasn't really able to tell me what she really liked.  I thought she could use a little work on selling menu items. The steak itself was mediocre at best.  I guess it lacked seasoning but the overall taste didn't compare to other ribeye steaks i've had.  I ordered a Brownie Obsession for dessert, which I practically inhaled it was so good, and always has me coming back.  The brownie is as soft as chocolate cake and comes heated and filled with warm hot fudge in the middle, served with a fudge topping and cool vanilla ice cream. One plus is there is free wifi service which turns on when you open a browser on your mobile device and redirects you to the Applebee's website.  BTW, Applebee's might consider adding a mobile site, because their regular site takes forever to load and I have a pretty fast phone.   Another good thing about this restaurant is the hours.  If your hungry at midnight, your options in Germantown are pretty much limited to fast food.   This place is open till midnight on weekdays and till 1am on weekends. I'm giving this place three stars because of accessibility at late hours, wifi service, dessert, and friendly  service.   I'm subtracting a star for a slightly disappointing steak and another star because i just can't get myself to say i'm a fan of this place but it is definitely A-OK, so 3 and half stars at best."
Matthew D.,"Gaithersburg, MD",2,58,,2.0,9/16/2011,"I was reading past reviews, and I normally don't comment on them, but I wanted to correct a little on one. Never will you be served a beer from an underage person. Why? Cause they can lose their license. So I don't trust that review right off the bat. So, on to my review... The tables And booths are worn, torn and needs a major fix. It's Friday evening and the service isn't too bad yet for a party of 4. The food can be better. I ordered the cowboy burger and asked for no tomatos or bacon..and guess what I get? I get both. The table behind got burnt food...this place is a hit or miss. Maybe i'll send this to HQ. Maybe then, someone will fix something."
marky m.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,21,,1.0,7/13/2013,"Food quality & service has gone down hill fast since the asian manager took over. She also appears to be racist/unprofessional. The last 3 times ive been the food came out raw, burnt or just tasted terrible. I was here for a business dinner to wine and dine a prospective client. However after 1 drink I was informed by my server that the asian manager said we are not allowed to have more than 1 drink. Keep in mind we are 2 well dressed quiet spoken proessfionals having a quiet dinner/business discussion in a corner booth. When I confronted the manager about the 1 drink limit & pointed to several obivously drunk patrons around the bar area who had several drinks she said ""i know them its okay but i dont know you so no more drinks for you"" I will never go back to this restaurant again."
Shasha S.,"Montgomery County, MD",12,60,14,1.0,11/3/2012,This place could use alooooot of help.their lamp fixtures are  dusty and its just not appealing for a food establishment.we did the 2 for 20 deal and got the spinach n artichoke dip (straight out of a can or frozen) the chips were nothing to babble about.now the entrees oh gosh the new southwest shrimp fettucine was disgusting.the sauce was dry pasta was mushy and old.the shrimp was definetly old probably frrom sitting out too   friend ordered the ribs which she claimed were dryyyy.i will not however comment on the service because my only complaint was that it was superrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr slow but that might also be the kitchen fault! I will not be returning to this location.
Tim R.,"Cabin John, MD",5,246,13,1.0,1/3/2011,Would not provide allergy information.  Gave me a number that I could call to find out.  Phones were not staffed.  It offends me that a food establishment would put so much effort into not being responsible for what they put on the table in front of me.  I won't go there again.
Shertia C.,"Germantown, MD",1,3,1,1.0,4/24/2012,"Worst experience Ever!!!!!!! I had my heart and stomach set on the Blackend Chicken Penne and even added on the steak for $4 extra..my friend and I arrived at 6:30ishpm not busy yet...best time before the evening rush we ordered the trio and received it 10min later...not bad time...then we placed our orders for the pasta and an additional side order of wings.. My friend stated that he wanted his wings welldone lightly sauced our waitress [Kadi N] acknowledged the request with okay. 35min later we receive or cold pasta and our waitress never brought our wings out. She stated I didn't know you wanted them...smdh.  When we started eating our pasta was cold or waitress offered to warm it back up in the microwave... WTF....REALLY THE MICROWAVE...At this point we're ready to go! Then the manager ( Michelle) comes out trying to make peace and states she will have them cook us whole new dishes and bring out our order of wings and give us a discount and free appetizer or dessert. At this point we already missed our movie time not to mention we were still hungry so we decided to wait...15 min later we have hot pasta and our order of wings...15 min....so why did it take 35min the first time. Of course by this time all the hungry evening customers were coming in...so now its  packed and noisy. We asked for the check [ manager Michelle] comes over to see if we want dessert..I told her that's okay were ready to go. The bill comes and they took off our order of wings 6.95...not seeing the justice for all we  been through that night I asked our waitress to tell the manger we'll take the free dessert she offered earlier to go. 8:250Pm Kadi N our waitress states that the manger already gave us the discount and took off the order of wings...we showed her our bill with the [no discount] she said its the discount or free dessert....so WHERE IS MY DAMN DESSERT????..""Morale to this experience look in freezer next time be patient for it to thaw out, and fix your own damn meal! Oh and no more Applebees at the Fredrick Road, Germantown location!# yes i'm doing this by text...Im that disappointed!!!"
Tabu D.,"Gaithersburg, MD",1,6,2,1.0,2/6/2012,I should have read the reviews. We went there on Friday because I just wanted to try their under 550 calorie meals and because I have not been to Applebees since the 90's. We were seated and promptly forgotten.  10minutes later my sister had to flag down a server that turned out to be a manager. She apologized and got us a server and guaranteed us that we were in good hands and the kitchen has been told to speed up our food. Our server took out order and again was goon for another 10minutes before we got out drinks. 15 minutes later we got our food minus the appetizer we ordered. First of all the food looked nothing like the picture. They did not even try.  My sisters shrimp where cold. She sent it back and when she got a back it was apparent that it was put in the microwave. Her medium rare steak was now well done and it was horrible.  Our server promised us that she will check on the kitchen regarding our appetizer. Another 5 minutes later our appetizer was delivered and one of the managers came over to apologize. He apologized because our server had lied and forgot the appetizer and instead of admitting her mistake she blamed it on the kitchen. To make up for the inconvenience my sister's meal and the appetizer where on the house. I will never go again. There is a lack of attention to detail with the server. The restaurant was empty and anyone setted in our section had to wait for a while. Our server made many mistakes with our orders and others.
Jatte L.,"Germantown, MD",4,24,2,4.0,8/17/2010,I am pretty impressed with Applebees. The french fries are well seasoned and they were so good I could eat those all the time. I loved our waitress and everyone was super friendly. Definetly going back.
Kim L.,"Rockville, MD",0,19,,5.0,8/6/2012,I love Applebees and especially there fries and alcoholic beverages.  I'm happy they do not charge liquor tax like some restaurants in Rockville do.  If I want an alcoholic beverage I come here and because I know I won't et taxed on it.  Thanks Applebees
Karol W.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,6,,3.0,6/10/2012,"Been to this restaurant many times and each time the food is OK, plenty of it but nothing spectacular. My wife and I usually order the 2 for $20. They need to perfect the way they serve their steaks. When I order a steak medium, I expect it medium not well done. Applebees should install a salad bar like Ruby's who now offers their salad bar as a side dish, great idea and last time there they were packed w/long waiting times. We got there early so didn't have to wait. Given the hard economic times the the USA, restaurants have to get creativee w/their menu's and not offer  the same old tired food. Applebee's 2 for $20 offering haven't changed since it was introduced many yrs ago. ."
Marvin G.,"Frederick, MD",5,47,2,2.0,11/15/2008,"I've eaten here a couple of times and always a little dissatisfied. It just doesnt taste right. I decided to try again and ordered the Blackened Chicken Salad with, blackend chicken, bacon, tomatoes, hard boiled egg, mixed greens, and vinaigrette dressing. What could go wrong? It's a salad. To start, there was no bacon or egg. There were 3 of the tiny tomatoes and the vinaigrette dressing was sweet. Who puts sugar in vinaigrette? They told me it was bacon vinaigrette and that's why it was sweet. I did a google search for bacon vinaigrette, to get the ingredients. There is no such combo. Bad place. That was my last visit."
