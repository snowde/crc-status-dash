Sherry H.,"San Jose, CA",91,14,1,3.0,1/10/2018,Good afternoon.     I called in an order. And. Low and behold.   When I say NO PICKLES.  THATS WHAT I MEAN.   I was pleased that it didn't take long.   But.  CMON.  No Puckles.  PLEASE.  Not ON MY FOOD.    Other than that.    I love Applebee's.   Their fries are AWESOME.    Geeeeez.    Jus sayin....  The place is clean friendly.   Great service.    The whole 5 star thing.   But when you ruin my burger with Pickles.   Your Stars fall off.
Laurie M.,"Elk Grove, CA",7,22,24,4.0,12/30/2017,This Applebee's was very busy when we came for early dinner (5 pm)...probably because of the season (Christmas) and location. It took a while to seat us even though there were several tables open. But our server was prompt and gave us our appetizers quickly. The portions seemed more generous and fresher than other Applebee's we've been to (Palm Springs and Elk Grove). The rest of the meal was good too but took a while to come. We had a really efficient and attentive server (Yoanna)...most enjoyable meal at Applebee's yet!
Bhavin P.,"Arlington, TX",99,2,,1.0,12/26/2017,"Worst service ever. This place is in the middle of Gilroy outlets and for it being in a prime area where a lot of traffic comes thru, you'd think this place is a nice establishment. Well, this place is the worst. The restaurant is nasty, not very clean, and waiters/waitresses are not very attentive. I ordered a whiskey bacon burger well done. When my order came out, my burger was pink and not well done. I called the waitress to tell her, she took it back and I didn't see my food ever again. It took them so long to correct the mistake I ended up canceling my order because we were there for about 2 hours now and we wanted to go to the stores before they closed. If I could, I would give this place 0 stars. Will not be coming back to this place ever."
Timothy D.,"Milpitas, CA",227,40,122,2.0,5/30/2017,"Applebee's has never been a go to food place for me or anyone I know. If anything it presents itself with a nice building but mediocre food.  When we went the room was packed, so we waited around 20-30 minutes for seating which was fine. It was warm outside and the indoors was somewhat cool. We got seated by our server, Amanda. She did the best she could and I don't blame her for anything. She was great! I decided to order the new Fire Roasted Chicken Salad Wrap with a Cesar Salad for the lunch combo. I had high expectations because it mentioned it being spicy. Knowing myself, I LOVE SPICY. My mom was about to get that but was worried it was going to be too spicy, so she asked what was in it that gave it heat. Amanda replied that it was mixed with sriracha (which in my opinion is not even spicy at all).  We wait a bit then receive our food. Everyone's portions seemed a lot larger than mine. The salad seemed small and it looked like I was missing half of my wrap. The plate landing on the table made me feel incomplete because my food looked incomplete. After some disappointment, I began to eat. I wanted a lot more dressing on my salad, but aside from that it was fine. More croutons could have helped but that's just me loving bread. The wrap however looked dinky. Half a wrap. It was a mere 3-4 inches long. It looked promising because of the amount of chicken and lettuce it held. One bite in, no spice. There was a lot of healthy flavors going on, but as I continued I was wondering where the spice was. There was no heat at all. I wasn't dying for water or sweating. It was nice, but could have been better with the some sort of spiciness.  Overall my portion size could have been more and things could have had more flavors. I would say I'd go here again but I'm not: 1) Because Gilroy is far away from me 2) Because the food was not up to my expectation and I could have been more full if I spent my money elsewhere"
C W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,45,5,2.0,12/16/2017,"Been here a few times. This time the service was just okay. We had to ask for drink refills after the second time.  I know she knew the cup was empty.  We ordered the 2 for $20. Sad, not as many choices. We ordered the onion rings for appetizers (a little over cooked), the chicken tenders (way over cooked, dry), grilled fiesta lime chicken (nothing special, liked the shredded tortilla chips though).  Riblet basket  is no longer a 2 for $20 option, nor the chicken and shrimp. Maybe we'll take another chance and try the all you can eat riblets on a Wednesday."
Mindy S.,"Gilroy, CA",31,30,6,1.0,4/4/2017,"This place has really gone downhill. I used to be a manager here in the early 2000's and we would have NEVER accepted the level of service and food quality that is going on here now.  We were seated pretty quickly, but that was the end of the attention we got. Luckily my buddy Jayne still works here as a bartender and I was able to get her attention to find a server.  Attached is the picture of the 2 for $25 'half rack' of ribs my husband waited 10 minutes longer than the 25 minutes the rest of us waited for our food,  which was cold when it arrived anyway.  The ledge behind the both we were seated at was so filthy so it was obvious that noone had wiped it down in many days.  Disgusting,  we will never be back. You stink Applebee's."
Susan G.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,5.0,12/7/2017,"My granddaughter and I stopped in for lunch.  15 minutes or so after ordering the manager came to our table to apologize for our wait and to inform us that my meal wasn't ready. She offered us an appetizer while we waited. After our lunch came the manager and our server, Brenda, stopped by the table numerous times to check on us.  I don't mind waiting for my food if the staff communicates with me that there is a delay. Our lunch was enjoyable thanks to Brenda and her manager."
Eddie O.,"Hollister, CA",52,36,9,1.0,12/30/2017,This place has such garbage food. Its just nasty. The people that work here are fine but the food is just doodoo butter.
Fred B.,"Morgan Hill, CA",52,14,,1.0,11/24/2017,"We have usually had good food and service here. The problem we have noticed is the management is clearly lacking. The final straw for us ever going there again was the week before last when we saw the bartender refuse to serve an underaged girl at a table with two other legal aged ladies. These ladies just kept feeding the underaged girl their drinks. After a while the very busy bartender caught on and removed all the drinks from the table(which she legally had to do, since I have been a bartender myself). The bartender went to management to 86 the three people since they were pretty much yelling cuss words at her and the management would not back her up. It looked like the bartender quit on the spot because of this type of thing happening before. That was the last time we go!!!"
Coleen C.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,5.0,11/23/2017,"Although they messed up my to go order, they more than made up for it by giving us a free appetizer and dessert when we went in the next time. Always very happy with their customer service!"
Tara D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3,30,21,3.0,10/14/2017,"So I had not gone to an Applebee's in probably over 10 years because of past bad experiences BUT I was pleasantly surprised to have a very decent experience at the Gilroy Applebee's . My friend had suggested we go for the October  ""dollaritas"" and not horrible actually pretty decent especially for a buck . We had tried several appetizers and I thought the steak quesadilla pretty good. I know  Applebee's has not been doing so well but I suggest keep the Dollaritas promo going it is working and bringing people back"
Lisa L.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",27,25,4,3.0,11/5/2017,We ate there because we were passing by. I ordered a steak medium but it was so done I had to saw it with my knife. My other food was good and so was my families. The waiter was good. I would have sent the steak back but we had an appointment we were heading to.
Destinie Z.,"San Jose, CA",409,546,527,2.0,11/3/2016,"Occasionally come to Gilroy to have happy hour with a friend since he works nearby, and every time we end up at Chevy's but this time we came here....mistake. They ran out of the beer he was ordering. The food came to our table freezing cold.  Waiter was changed from one guy who didn't pay attention to the next who paid even less attention.  I think we'll be sticking with the Chevy's around the corner."
Roel P.,"Salinas, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/17/2017,"I have been coming to this restaurant for a while now and one of the BIGGEST reasons that I keep coming back is for the bartenders Jimmy and Dex. The guys are a ball! They're attentive, caring, funny, charismatic and all around just great guys. 5 stars simy for these two. Keep up the great work guys! P.S the drinks are great!"
Leola C.,"Gilroy, CA",0,4,1,4.0,1/19/2017,"Last time hubby and I ate here the service was good. This time I think the waitress may have been having a tough day... But she wasn't rude.  I got the smaller portion chicken with apples and quinoa and the person was just right. After eating about 1/3 of the sampler appetizer and this chicken meal I actually was pretty full.  It's a light dish and wouldn't recommend it for someone with a hearty appetite. The apples and celery were a nice pair and the rice-quinoa serving nestled underneath the 2-4 oz chicken breast had dried cranberries, such a yummy combination of flavors! I'll definitely be getting this again!"
Marcio E.,"Gilroy, CA",10,29,1,5.0,6/14/2017,"Came here a while back when my friends from brazil where visiting me. Service was greAt, food was good. I am a simple man. I like thier 2x$20 deals.  No complains its just a good place to eat. Will definitely come back again."
Mark Z.,"Gilroy, CA",123,27,60,1.0,9/5/2017,"Wow, this used to actually be a halfway decent restaurant but I must say the quality of the food is in the toilet. I made a to go order on their app which by the way it's pretty cool. I then drove up to the waiting area outside and they have a camera they're supposed to see you when you park in one of the spaces. Well I waited for about eight minutes and nobody came out, so I went inside and grab an employee. She then verified my name and then brought me the bill to sign before seeing the   she brought it out I should've looked at it but it was wrapped up nice and neat so I figured OK I'll take it home. My ribs which were the dry rub variety took a dry to a whole new level. It was crispy like the turkey in National Lampoon's Christmas vacation. My wife had the cedar plank salmon which is more like salmon jerky, hard as a rock. So I wasn't going to drive the 7 miles back to the Applebee's location by the outlets but I figure I'm done with these guys 55 bucks wasted and I even tipped them  so I said you Applebee's it was great when it was a honeymoon but after this many years I'm through."
Duvina M.,"Columbia Falls, MT",20,4,2,5.0,5/29/2017,"Love my Job, the people & the Food. I always look forward to coming to work to serve and spend time with good people we're a team we're a family"
Richard L.,"Alhambra, CA",90,23,9,1.0,3/11/2017,Three words: hair wrapped steak. Service is friendly but the food was pretty inconsistent. Worst of all my steak ordered medium but got well done had hair literally wrapped around the steak....I know it happens but this was pretty obvious and I'm not sure they could miss it. My girlfriend order fries that were cold and salty but her brother also order fries which were almost perfect...? How does that happen?  I would not  recommend his place.
John J.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,12,11,3.0,5/20/2017,A good alternative to McD for something to east while shopping at the outlets.  Bar is ok too.  Watch out for crowded times - not worth waiting for table.
Janis D.,"Morgan Hill, CA",31,76,7,4.0,7/23/2017,I would hVe given them 5 stars if they got my appetizer to me when they should have and hadn't lost my order. But my server was excellent. I sat at the bar when I got there waiting for a friend who was stuck in terrible traffic. I also took his suggestion and ordered the steak salad for lunch. Wasn't really hungry after eating the appetizer so I have plenty leftover for dinner. But it was cooked perfectly and delicious. My server was arguably the most personable server I have had in any restaurant in a long time. Totally fun but professional guy. Kept me company while I waited for my friend. Was just nice! Will be back if I can except service like that
Perry P.,"Milpitas, CA",227,23,12,1.0,7/26/2017,"We came in at 11:30pm. They close at midnight. I worked at a pho restaurant and Rubio's and Marshalls in the past, 30 minutes is not a big deal for 2 guys lol. We saw 3 of the workers conversing with another and looking back at us over and over. Pretty obvious they wanted to close it off with us and anyone else after us. 1 of them came back and said ""we already did last calls on food 5 minutes ago..."" in a very hesitant and terrible liar voice LOL the 2 girls were obviously annoyed giving us mean faces, they didn't even ask if we wanted take out or speak to us kindly..."
Joseph B.,"San Jose, CA",225,122,208,1.0,6/12/2016,I came here to have the 8oz steak with baked potato And veggies My youngest ordered the wonton stir fry The shrimp was the best part of that dish Her rice was dry & crunchy the broccoli was dry  My steak was cooked wrong I ordered medium rare it was over cooked I sent it back n it still came out wrong My vegetables were bland the baked potato was good I think the place is just too busy and the food is rushed I don't eat out dinner much cuz I know I can do better at home Don't think all Applebee's are like this but I won't ever eat here again
Sarah M.,"Hollister, CA",18,28,1,2.0,8/8/2017,Mediocre food at high prices.  Mozzarella sticks are dry and lukewarm.  I ordered the caprese chicken with basalmic dressing.  It was gross.  My daughter said her hamburger bun tasted doughy.  Plus the air conditioner was not on and it was so stuffy inside.  I will not be coming back.  Ever.
Liz F.,"San Bruno, CA",27,23,1,1.0,10/21/2017,"Let me tell you horrible horrible!!! We waited an hour for our food just for it to be cold. My son's Mac and cheese was old like it was made the day before then instead of remaking it they just reheated it. The manager who was talking with was while the food was being ""remade"" tried to say he watched them make it. I call bs!!! Oh and don't buy into their dollaritas. Its basically flavored water. Bypass this place if you can. The worst Applebee's I have ever been too. I can say more but it's just pissing me off even more that I wasted so much time at this restaurant. You get one star because I can't give no stars."
Jona C.,"Anaheim, CA",2,70,65,4.0,7/30/2016,"This place wasn't bad for being an Applebee's.  Came here because it was the only thing open after 9:30 pm and was happily surprise. We sat at the bar so didn't have to wait to be seated, only the bartender was working the area so he was definitely busy but gave us great service, kept checking on us and letting us now he would be right with us. Drinks were good, and food was really really good had the ribs and nachos and everything was fresh and tasty. Place can seem a little rundown but nothing crazy."
Jenny D.,"San Jose, CA",10,34,6,1.0,2/19/2017,"It takes forever for them to pick up their phones for take out and if they even do they end up hanging up on you. I've called three times now, first two times was just hung up on right away and second time was hung up on after waiting on hold for someone to take my to go order.  There is a reason this Applebee's has 2 stars on Yelp! I recommend staying far away from this place.  Applebees itself is a great place to eat but this location is poorly run. Management needs to do something if it's employees are allowed to treat their guests like this"
Juvenal V.,"Fremont, CA",8,1,,1.0,10/23/2017,"This is the worst Applebee's I have ever been to, and probably the last I will ever visit this restaurant chain. I was there this past Sunday night, I was told the wait would be around 20 minutes, which I didn't mind. The 20 minutes came and went, I continued to wait patiently until the hostess started seated people who showed up after me. I asked her what was the deal and she responded that I would be seated next.  Apparently NOT!!! She proceeded to seat the couple who had just walked in! I asked on the waitress to speak to the manager to get an explanation on the seating process, the waitress explained the hostess was new but come on hard is it to read the names from the list in the order people arrive. I eventually decided to take my business somewhere else with out speaking to the manager, it is clear the staff here lacks hospitality training. I will definitely never step foot into another Applebee's."
Lisa D.,"Gilroy, CA",183,11,5,2.0,8/12/2017,They never turn a/c on and if they do it's barely and off and on. The poor waitresses and staff are clearly sweating. We went there 3 times this summer. Same issue each time. Food is ok but somehow they seem to get our order messed up and service is slow. It's gone downhill. Perhaps management??
Amy V.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,74,1,1.0,10/23/2016,"This place is FOUL. My friend and I were shopping and stopped in for a bite to eat as it was the only place around that wasn't McDonald's or fast food. It was packed and the staff was clueless. The place is dirty--piles of dishes and food scraps in the sink at the bar (hello, I can see that) and a weird smell near the bar..probably the rotting food in said sink. And there was a five year old eating ice cream at the BAR while her parents were drinking. Umm...what? Sit at a table with your child. Children should never be seated at the bar. Geez. Bathrooms....don't even go. Hold it. Never coming back again. Ever. Eeeuuuwww.... I wanted to throw up after being in there."
shon f.,"Salinas, CA",24,31,10,2.0,4/23/2017,"Brought my family here after shopping at the outlets. The service wasn't terrible but it wasn't exactly stellar. We think our waitress must have been covering two sections because she would take quite a while before she would come back to us. The place was hot inside and out table felt sticky. I ordered a salmon, my wife a steak w/fries, our 18 m/o a corn dog , and our 5 y/o a mac n cheese plate.  My wife's steak was chewy and flavorless.  And our toddler's corn dog was under cooked because when my wife was cutting it in smaller pieces the batter of the corn meal was still raw.  Wife sent it back to get a new one cooked all the way through. The second one they brought out was again undercooked. Finally we talked to the manager about it and explained to him why it's dangerous to be serving undercooked food especially when people bring their kids to their restaurant. They took the corndog off of our bill and we just fed her broccoli and French fries. Overall the dinner experience was bad and this Applebee's is one of the worst ones I've been to. The only reason they get a lot of business is because of where they are located."
John M.,"San Mateo, CA",0,37,1,5.0,10/7/2017,"Great service and good value of food, two orders of salad + grilled chicken/shrimp for $20, food taste good too."
Chelsea B.,"Gilroy, CA",279,1,,1.0,6/30/2017,"Our server was sweet But man oh man was the food absolutely terrible. My husband ordered the bacon burger medium well and it came out RAW. Literally, the inside of the burger was raw beef. Thank goodness he doesn't habe food poisoning and thank goodness I decided not to take a bite considering I'm pregnant. I ordered the four cheese mac n cheese and was also extremely disappointed. The noodles were plain and drenched in what tasted like a soy sauce marinade. No cheese on anything. The manager took the two items off of our bill. We will not be returning. Every time we do something like this happens."
Cece M.,"Hollister, CA",0,19,1,1.0,7/19/2017,"Horrible services! We waited 20 before a waitress approched us. My boyfriend ordered sweet potato fries and they came back with like 10 regular fries because they were out of sweet potato fries. They brought out the sweet potato fries when we were almost done eating. The waitress didn't came around to ask if we need anything, we finished our drinks half way through the food"
Ashley N.,"Bakersfield, CA",50,14,1,1.0,9/23/2017,Have you seen the movie 'Waiting'? I'm pretty sure the cook here has! After a few bites of the food I noticed a 1 inch black hair in my food. My husband reassured me it was nothing and suggested I continue eating. My toddler and I had a few more bits before I noticed at least four more pieces of hair in the food!! Everyone was very apologetic and they took $15 off the bill. I was hesitant to write this review as the manager did seem to try to resolve it. I just don't understand how that much hair can make it in one plate of food!!! Disgusting!!!!
Ashmita V.,"San Francisco, CA",86,169,41,1.0,9/4/2016,"One star for the ability to pay through a tablet on the table without having to show my extremely disappointed hungry face to my server. This place is horrible. Flat nasty beer, soggy cold mozzarella sticks and Doritos in the name of salsa verde nachos for a whopping $11. Don't. Just don't."
Perla G.,"Gilroy, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/22/2017,"Came to pick up a To-Go order. Not only was I waiting a long period to get my food, the servers would just look and should I mention there was 2-3 people talking in groups no one bothered to ask if they can help. Worst Applebees I've been too."
Devo S.,"Sacramento, CA",970,1012,3135,5.0,1/12/2015,"""5 stars?!"" you say? Well, based solely on the one experience I had at this Gilroy Outlets Applebee's location...heck ya!! We had left Cambria at about 9:00am, and were making excellent time home back to SacTown, but were getting hungry. Thanks to the stupid DirecTv/NBC blackout the previous night, we didn't get to watch the Steelers/Ravens playoff game, so wanted to do some place the had the Bengals/Colts game on. After a quick Yelp search while still driving on 101N, we saw there were lots of food choices in the area. We just happened to pull into the Applebee's parking lot, and they had just opened, so in we went.  What was REALLY awesome is that they have Happy Hour in the bar during football games...WOOT! Add to that one heck of a pleasant, funny, efficient bartender named Monica, and we just had ourselves a grand ol' time! Got to relax from riding in the car for a while; had some EXCELLENT HH-priced apps in the asian chili wings and the pub pretzels, plus my two $5 blue agave margaritas and hubby's Coors Light...it all just worked out great and we had a great time and that's why I'm giving this Applebee's a 5-star rating. Everything just worked!"
Monica L.,"Palo Alto, CA",29,6,,1.0,6/11/2017,"Horrible service, horrible horrible horrible.... our server never took time to take care of my family and I. The Manager was on his phone playing games WHILE ON THE FLOOR, our server always chatting by the micros, the runners ignored us when we tried to get their attention. the only people who looked like they were taken care of were the people at the bar. The service was mediocre, its amazing they even have people coming in!! Considering the food was just OK... if your looking for a place to eat, your better off eating at in-n-out around the corner."
Jennifer M.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,16,,1.0,2/10/2017,"Stopped here becaus we were starving and from out of town. Sat at the bar and the gentleman was very nice. However, nothing behind the bar was clean. The wells had crap all over them as well as the dishwasher. Even the sink had mold around it where the ice was!!! And on the water line!! I was sick to my stomach by the time we left. Absolutely disgusting for a restaurant and should be shut down I can only imagine what the kitchen is like."
