Nicole C.,"Discovery Bay, CA",502,523,674,1.0,4/3/2010,"We normally would not step foot in an Applebee's but immense hunger completely overtook our group. When we first walked in we asked for the direction of the restroom and the ignorant wench who's job entailed opening the door for people laughed at us and said, ""There's a big sign over there."" I wanted to say, really I don't see it, can you take me to it yourself.""... idiot...and that is why she employed to only open a door...  The table they sat us at needed to be wiped down, it was a rather large table but the moron wiping it down slid the wet rag over to me and asked if I could wipe it down for him where I was sitting....UM NO! I don't know what the heck was on that rag! Our waiter was a little gross looking, with overgrown facial hair and mess hair... They took forever to get our drinks, I might add that throughout this whole experience we never got refills.  The appetizer was nasty and the wench who brought it out returned out ""Thank you's"" with a nasty scowl...  3 of us ordered burgers and the other person in our party ordered a sirloin sandwich. They messed up our order and tried to argue with me about what I ordered when I told them to take back what they tried to push on me as my order. 30 seconds later they brought my order out, I picked up my burger and it was DRIPPING with juice, I took a small bite and saw that it was RAW in the middle! The other two people in our group that got burgers stopped eating and realized that theirs looked pink as well, just not as bad as mine...my was straight raw! My friends sirloin sandwich had 4-5 small strips of steak on it and the bun was so hard you couldn't even cut it with a knife.  We called the manager over and his response was, HUH-YUCK....I guess we struck out 4 times...I just hope you'll give us another try...which met 4 HELL NO's! Worst service & Worst food EVER....cementing ALL Applebees fate(s) with us. We'll stick to more upscale places in more upscale, non-cow molesting cities."
Magic M.,"Waxahachie, TX",214,433,2,4.0,12/30/2011,"Not bad.  It's a chain, you get what you get.  Nothing outstanding, not bad service, very passable.  No wait, no pagers, no problem."
June G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/23/2011,"I went to this place last night at about 9:00pm.  I ordered a steak and a pasta. The dinner was  a little bit  average but the service was below average. The pasta tasted not that good but the steak is average, The steak I wanted was medium well  but was cooked too well done. The worst of all is I signed the credit card slip (AE Xpress) and I forgot to take back the card. It turned out that  the next morning I realized that my credit card was missing and found out when I called the credit card company that it was misused. It was used for fraudulent charges near that Applebees restaurant. My guess is somebody in that restaurant has misused my credit card because after that dinner I went straight back home and realized that in the next morning the card was not in my wallet.  Make sure you get  your card back when you dine there."
Eric K.,"Dublin, CA",45,1116,9,3.0,5/23/2010,"Not great... not horrible... I still don't like the fact that places like this charge as much for a salad as a burger or something.... comon... the ingredients don't cost that much. Stopped by here for lunch today on the way back home....  Food was decent, service was decent... we sat in the bar area at a table, so we walked right in and got served. What's to say?  if you've been to applebees then you know the food, as this is one of the places that wherever you go... is pretty good on consistent quality and service."
Nick R.,"Edgewater, FL",224,172,2,3.0,7/5/2010,"Despite the many negative reviews here, we had a good dining experiince overall. My steak and shrimp were delicious, though the French fries were not as hot as I'd have liked. My wife had a shrimp fajita and said if was not as good as some of her favorite Mexican restaurants, but it was fine for a general chain restaurant.  Our server was friendly and took good care of us, and the manager made it  a point of coming by to see if we were happy."
Becky B.,"Gilroy, CA",6,40,5,1.0,7/30/2010,"I would have to agree with many of the yelp reviewers, when I walk into a restaurant...I would like to feel welcome...if you are employed with the simple task of standing by the door, smiling, and escorting customers to a table...the LEAST you can do is smile and be polite. I will start with my story...my best friend, my son, and I went out to Gilroy for a fun day out of outlet shopping...when we got hungry, we decided to give Applebee's a try. My prior experiences with this particular place had neither been good nor bad...so in we went...we were greeted by the ""bitchiest"" employee I have ever met. He did not smile, did not greet us, did not even ask how many people in our party...in fact...we seemed to have disturbed his afternoon. After what seemed to be a long and silent walk over to our table...he practically threw our menus at us, rolled his eyes, and walked away. That should have been our 1st clue, that we should have packed it all up and left...our server, took his sweet time coming over...and really did not seem to be in the mood to be dealing with customers but he accurately took down our orders and disappeared. We barely saw him, from the time he took our food orders until the time the food came and then he became attentive, asking if we needed refills, etc. My guess, is that he was taking this opportunity to start earning his tip... I won't be going back...any place that doesn't bother to check up on and regulate their employee's behavior and how they interact with customers is not getting a single penny from me."
Raul N.,"Pacific Grove, CA",234,415,761,2.0,2/14/2010,"I headed over to Gilroy today for a quick trip to the J. Crew outlet and decided to grab dinner here too. Settled on Applebee's--not my choice--for dinner. Now, I've never been to an Applebee's before, so this was quite the experience for me. The menu was certainly eclectic--a mix of different cuisines. And the décor was, um, interesting. After poring over the menu, I settled on one of Applebee's new ""under 500 calories"" dinners. Now I'm not one to usually count calories--I did, after all, unabashedly have an apple tarte tatin with lunch the other day--but when the calorie counts are provided on the menu and you see the average dish carries 1,000+ calories, well, you can't help but seek out the healthier fare. I tried the Dijon chicken with Portobello mushrooms. It wasn't terrible--sure, a little salty, and the chicken had that artificial ""smoky"" flavor that's common at chain restaurants, but the Portobellos and roasted red peppers offered a nice flavor. The sides--seasonal veggies and potatoes--were pretty bland, like an overcooked TV dinner. I was pleasantly surprised by our service. The restaurant was packed--we had completely forgotten it was Valentine's Day, after all--but we didn't have to wait too long for a table during the dinner rush. Our service was a little slow, but considering every table was packed, I was impressed how quickly we got our food. Will I be back? Probably not--next time my stomach starts rumbling while I'm outlet shopping, I'll stick with In-N-Out."
carol K.,"Benicia, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/4/2013,"This is the filthiest restaurant I've ever been in! I'm surprised the health department hasn't closed them down.  The food is also lousy and the wait staff, while pleasant, are very slow.  Never again."
Justin A.,"San Jose, CA",33,42,8,4.0,5/1/2011,"The service was good, that is what earned this Applebee's Four Stars. From when we walked in, until we left, our experience was outstanding. We ordered our meals and it seemed to come out really fast. Almost like they knew what we were going to order, and boom, there it was. I had ordered the Herb Shrimp and Steak off the weight watchers, now I was skeptical at first, no longer, this was delicious. It gave me an idea to start boiling most of the food I make, thanks for that. All of us enjoyed the meals that we ordered. Applebee's you did well! We will be back to this location."
Tina G.,"Gilroy, CA",7,10,3,1.0,9/2/2012,"Very upset, gave this place a second chance tonight and it was a mistake. The waiter offered us a 2 for $20 and he went to go get our appetizer which we never got. We asked for water, butter, and salsa, which never came. When we went to leave as I stood up, the Asian lady next to us was holding a WHITE DOG in her lap wrapped in a blanket! Now I'm a dog lover and owner but this pissed me off.... In fact I think the health department needs to be notified."
Sappho C.,"San Jose, CA",167,183,640,3.0,12/17/2011,"Not too shabby for your average ""friendly neighborhood bar and grill"". They do have a decent happy hour and one of the few places that have drink specials after 10!  What's a bit annoying is like what every yelpers have said, they announce it over the speaker when your table is ready. So my friends and I are having a good time and out of nowhere, ""Michelle, party of 2, Michelle, party of 2, your table is ready"" Way to ruin the atmosphere. Although the ratings are low, 2 stars, we were there on a friday night and it was PACKED from 4-11! So i guess although it might not be good service, people will keep coming back because theres not much around gilroy."
Marcus K.,"San Francisco, CA",640,1076,1897,4.0,11/11/2009,"Came in on a Thursday evening for dinner at the bar.  Had a nice full glass of wine, sirloin steak, mashed potatoes, fresh steamed broccoli.  The wine selection was way too small (a coyple blush and reds - c'mon guys your'e in California!!!) but I found something that would do.  The mash was refridgerator cold but the b'tender brought some freshly nuked ones quickly.  Brocc was fantastic and got a huge pile.  Yum!  For dessert there was a nice small sunday.   I wish more restaurants served small desert rather than mambo size dessert tha you can only finish with a large family or a five year old.  Service was great."
Chris Y.,"Portland, OR",46,75,,4.0,2/20/2012,"Service was great, I got the Salmon grilled with garlic and herbs with almond rice pilaf. The portion of the salmon was a bit small, but the salmon wasn't dry and was delicious!"
Andreas W.,"Mountain View, CA",6,10,,1.0,9/23/2012,"We had lunch there while shopping in Gilroy. Food wasn't good, cold and overcooked. Maybe enough for 3 stars. But then they lost my credit card when I wanted to pay. We were sitting less than 30 feet from the checkout - how incapable can one be to let this happen?"
Judy L.,"San Mateo, CA",3,26,2,2.0,3/3/2012,Food here is good enough for me to return. Riblets and deserts are great. Service very bad. I always hate leaving a tip.
D. S.,"Burlingame, CA",0,12,,1.0,4/7/2011,The food was bad bad. I don't frequent the chains much but it's usually inoffensive at worst. This was nasty and inedible! Should have gone to McDonald's instead. Yuck! Service was slow also.
Ghost I.,"San Jose, CA",0,14,,2.0,9/12/2014,manager was nice. food was decent. server wasnt friendly and seem like she wanted to get rid of me.
Marevie T.,"San Jose, CA",1823,674,26,5.0,8/23/2011,"The day before my birthday, my boyfriend and I decided to stop by for a bite to eat before tearing up the outlets. The wait was a little long, but well worth it. Loved my Mango Mojito (but where was the mint leaves?) and enjoyed my ribs! I did like my appetizer (buffalo wings) better though, it was spicy enough for me to handle. Definitely would return here if I'm in the area."
Maos E.,"Gilroy, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/5/2014,Its not all about the food. They serve a decent steak. The service is shitty the atmosphere is noisy and its hard to carry a conversation. The drinks are overpriced. I had a rasberry tea that had no taste it was practically amber colored water that costs $5 might as well get a glass of water. They take over 25 min to bring you your food also and time is precious.
David C.,"Gilroy, CA",22,22,1,4.0,3/1/2012,I've really been enjoying Applebee's low cal meals. Today I had the grilled chicken and portobello mushroom. Very tasty and filling and only 500 calories!
