Eduard F.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,28,,5.0,11/21/2016,"Why do the burgers taste so much better at this place compared to every other Applebees?  Sat at the bar,  fries were good, my area was clean, mustard and ketchup bottles were new and full (no air), napkins were within easy reach and the stainless steel flatware was clean. Quick and friendly service.  You don't get all that with most lunch places nowadays so I couldn't really ask for anything more."
Ryan C.,"Morgan Hill, CA",78,14,6,4.0,7/3/2015,"Very friendly staff. Today I had the oriental chicken salad, and it actually satisfied me more than a burger or some meat would have. The sriracha shrimp appetizer was delicious. It had the heat of sriracha, but not the flavor. Very well done. The bartender made the perfect Tokyo tea, also. Not bad."
Lawrence O.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,12,2,5.0,3/14/2016,"We went to Applebees today for lunch and we were served by Monica L . Monica is a Gem , a very nice lady. We had burgers with fries and also an appetizer. We ate all of it amd enjoyed our meal very much. I've noticed many of the Yelpers were complaining about the food, smells, wait staff, etc. None of that was our experiance. Looking forwsrd to our next visit to Applebees."
Ken M.,"San Mateo, CA",9,36,32,3.0,3/24/2015,The experience was okay. I would have rated a 5 star or 4 star but starting off there was a little chunk of food in my water. I am not really a picky person but that was unsanitary. I told the waitress and she immediately fixed it. I was happy about the correction and the rest of the service was good except for that. Also for some reason the tables were kinda sticky. I don't know if it was because they did not clean it or it's just like that. Overall this place is a decent place. The waiters are fast and very friendly.
Deanna D.,"Los Gatos, CA",31,17,3,1.0,1/30/2016,"Just awful. Food was cold. Waiter nonexistent. You have to work really hard to be this bad. If that's what they're going for, they nailed it."
Michelle G.,"Gilroy, CA",23,85,4,1.0,7/25/2014,Megan L. is probably one of the WORST servers I have ever encountered.  Sure she's pretty and has fantastic eyebrows but her attitude and serving skills overshadow those earlier mentioned attributes.  Just goes to show you good looks don't always get you far.... or a tip.
Elicia F.,"Campbell, CA",142,10,10,1.0,10/6/2016,"AWFUL. I came here with a large party and the manager, a blond man with glasses came and kept shushing us, mind you we were also watching the dodgers v. Giants game.. plus, there was a FLY in my drink and when I told this same manager he tried to give me a coupon for another drink and I had to literally fight with him to get a full refund. Terrible and disgusting, not surprising for gilroy"
Leila M.,"San Jose, CA",6,5,,1.0,8/2/2016,"Biggest disappointment to Applebee's chain.  It took us 30 mins to be seated, close to an hour for food to be served and steak was overcooked!  Their meat was dry (we asked for medium) and pasta was served room temp with its chicken on top close to fridge cold.  We had to send the plate back for reheating.  The only redeeming factor there was their dessert but the rest, a huge disappointment.  I'm not sure if this is just an isolated case but I don't think I would be back there to dine again."
Elliott G.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/13/2016,"Would give zero stars if possible. Got coffee from starbucks and came here for lunch. First off no one greeted us and we were standing there for 5 minutes wondering if anyone would acknowledge our presence. Then the waitress came up and I was told I couldnt drink my drink because it is ""policy."" Never been kicked out of a restaurant simply for having a coffee.  Never been treated worse at an establishment in my life. Worse restaurant of all time. Will never go to this Applebees or any other Applebees ever again. Do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere."
Jessica Z.,"San Jose, CA",39,65,136,2.0,10/13/2014,"I swallowed the food, so I guess it was ok... The portions are ridiculously small for the price!  So the problem wasn't that we were still starving, but that it was too costly... The hubby got a weight watcher Thai shrimp salad or something called that, and I SWEAR that it was about one little hand full of lettuce! And then a nice amount of shrimp (12 to be exact-not bad)... I asked two employees that passed by the table (just to confirm my shock) if this is really how this salad comes or was the chef just being stingy?! (Well I said it nicer).. ""Yea""   Wish I took photos!  Well my chicken Alfredo penne pasta was ok... Nothing special but like I said it was edible. And good normal portion.  OMG  The kids food was tooooo hilarious! Under the menu it says ""Very Hungry"" and then a list of options. One cheese burger fries and drink was $4.99 and it fails to say it's a ""Slider""! Soooo tiny literally like 2""x 2""! And the fries were really hard and dry... Don't get me wrong, my kids were full at the end of the meal... But for $5 ? And yes my kids usually have left overs, but other restaurants like ""Red Robin"" (lunch/dinner) or ""IHOP"" (breakfast) have better prices and flavorful meals....  This was my first visit at this location and my last going to this restaurant chain..."
Tee J.,"Salinas, CA",3,78,1,4.0,8/25/2015,"- I've not been a fan of Applebee's for some time, yet a family friend seems to like the place, so we return from time to time. -- Surprisingly enough... the food and service at this store has improved a lot! -- The staff seems better trained and the food is much better. -- The lady-manager is --actually interested-- in comments from customers and she says, ""We can only improve if you tell us where we need to improve.""  In my view this is a refreshing comment from a manager who's truly interested in taking care of customers."
Seth G.,"Hollister, CA",53,5,,1.0,3/3/2016,"So chili's is one of my all time favorite restaurants and one day I made the mistake of wanting to go a different route. The service was beyond terrible! Our waiter kept ignoring us, he mouthed off when I asked him something about the menu, and to top it he couldn't keep his eyes off my girlfriend. $0 tip for Mr douche bag waiter! The food sucked. To be honest I think I would've been more satisfied if I stayed home and ate frozen microwave food. It was my first time to the last time, I'll never come back here. I do not recommend this place unless you have really low standards and deep pockets or your in a really shitty mood and feel like screaming at a manager about something, this establishment will give you more then plenty of excuses to do so. Bon appetite"
Winston S.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",93,447,89,3.0,7/28/2013,"Mom, myself and mom's bf had lunch here yesterday, after going to the Garlic Festival.  We were greeted at the door and got a booth in a matter of a minute or two.  The seats and table were not completely wiped, so they had to do it again and left it wet.   The server was friendly and was on the ball with our refills and communicating if something was delayed.  The spinach artichoke dip was decent and we asked for extra chips, which were promptly brought to us.  The Wedge salad was pretty good, but I didn't expect too much from Applebee's.  I was full from the steak and potatoes that came with the 2 item combo.   The only part that really stood out was that our server vanished after our food came and we waited 10 minutes or longer for our check.  We flagged down another staff member to bring our check and process it for us.  Not sure what happened... We live in LA, so it's not like we're going back here again, lol."
Harry T.,"San Francisco, CA",152,290,90,2.0,10/10/2012,Service is SOOO SLOWWW here! It has its good days but even then its barely bearable.  1 star because they have a decent happy hour 1 star because James the bartender is awesome
Claudia V.,"Seaside, CA",31,128,365,2.0,7/17/2015,"What a disappointment. I love big chain restaurants, but this one was a flop. I ordered a 7 oz sirloin steak with mashed potatoes and veggies. The streak was long and skinny and had a lot of fat in it. I really wanted to send it back, but I was too embarrassed. I struggled to cut the meat into pieces so I could eat it. Two stars for the mashed potatoes and veggies."
Caroline B.,"Fresno, CA",506,302,4504,3.0,4/6/2013,"We got the steak plate w/veggies, southern bbq wings (bomb), chicken italian alfredo w/broccoli was good but kind of bland. Used a gift card for our dinner, other than that, I don't think Applebee's would've been a choice to dine at."
Cece B.,"Santa Clara, CA",8,64,8,1.0,6/10/2015,"Let me start off by saying bluughhhhh ewwwww!!!!! This place makes chili's taste like a 5 start restaurant.  I'm so sorry I wasted my time and money here the food was horrible! It seemed the portions got smaller and the food has gotten more disgusting!!!!!! My steak tasted like canned meat with texture of beef jerkey, my husband's mac n cheese was drenched in a disgusting sauce!  Both of our stomachs were uneasy on the way home, gross blughh, makes me want to throw up thinking about it!!!!!!"
Cindy H.,"Hollister, CA",131,11,5,5.0,5/5/2015,"I had came to Applebee's today when Hometown Buffet across the way didn't open on time. So decided to go to Applebee's. Service from the start was great!! Wonderful greeting at the door, friendly service, great advice on Bourbon steak from our waitress Amy. Food was delicious, srawberry lemonade was good, and when leaving the resteraunt a waiter said have a nice day and even held door for me. Very happy with my experience at Applebee's  today. Thanks"
Cyn M.,"Gilroy, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/14/2016,"I've came here a couple times already and I love when Megan is our waitress ! She's so polite and patient . Last night I went in with my daughter and brother and there was a mistake made on one of the orders she apologized nicely , brought the right order so fast!!"
