Sue C.,"Foster City, CA",3,76,,5.0,9/27/2015,"This review is for the staff members at Applebee's. My son left his spiderman lego figure at the restaurant when we had quick drinks stop and we remembered after a couple of hours that we might have left it at the restaurant. A staff member called ""Cid"" answered the phone, found the lego figure from the host desk, and kept it with him until we came back to pick it up. Big thanks and thumbs up to the staff who cleaned the table (and managed to find the lego), the host who kept it, and Cid who took care of it for us."
Jae W.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",2,10,5,1.0,5/31/2015,"Would give this place a zero stars if we could. This is by far the worst Applebee's we have ever been to. Bad service. So slow everything came out freezing cold. The staff was rude the entire time. The manager Lori, was particularly horrible. Disrespectful, downright nasty. Do not go to this Applebee's location of you can avoid it."
Susan R.,"Richmond, CA",92,17,12,1.0,4/10/2015,Horrible service waited over an hour for my tables food only to have waiter approach us an hour later to let me know they gave my food to another table and we're out of what I ordered. Few minutes later another waiter brought my food that magically appeared and was so cold do not come here waiting to get my check still 30 min after my meal
Cher H.,"Bellevue, NE",53,160,81,2.0,9/3/2012,We had a gift card so we decided to give Applebee a try.  LONG LONG wait. Ordered the 2 entrees for 20$ and the food was boring and meh not very good. Oh well. We got to use our giftcard. Oh and the kids hamburger was a JOKE@! Nasty nasty. Looked like a crumb of meat.  seriously??
Melli D.,"San Mateo, CA",71,16,,1.0,3/20/2016,"First we get here and there's a 30 minute wait.....but at the same time there's about 15 open tables with dirty dished all over them. So we opt to sit at a high top at the bar. So the waiter shows up,. I then ask for the allergy list and spent about 20 minutes making sure anything I ordered wouldn't effect my food allergies. We all ordered our food and I'm brought something that is 100% the opposite of what I ordered . And when I say 100% I mean I ordered a salad and I got some chicken and mashed potatos.... no joke, I'm being completely honest here. Then I told the waiter what my order was yet again. And was extremely specific about my allergies and what my order was suppose to be. I was brought my order  (mind you my family is half done with their foot at this point) again I'm brought the wrong meal and then told by my waiter that what he brought was what I ordered.... ummmm I can tell by looking at the plate that it's not and it was filled with food that I'm allergic to. This is for sure a place you have to really be careful of if you have food allergies because they are 100% careless."
Phillip C.,"Norfolk, VA",25,17,4,4.0,12/31/2014,"This is your standard Applebee's with the standard menu. With that being said, our meal was what we expected for the price that we were expecting. Our server was very good and friendly, and we got everything quickly. We have no complaints about our meal and would return regularly if we lived here."
Andrea W.,"San Jose, CA",228,231,21,2.0,5/5/2014,"Seating was quick Waitress was quick The rest wasn't Took over 30 min for any of our order Including appetizers& kids grilled cheese Food was ok, nothing exciting Waitress was polite but busy or something  Mixed up a few things in our order.  Table could of used a better cleaning  Not a place I'm likely to return"
L L.,"Corona, CA",0,21,1,1.0,6/3/2015,Yuck!! Don't waste your money here. Applebee's has become a favorite restaurant of mine; the food good.  This Applebee's however is a sorry excuse for a restaurant. Terrible food. Terrible service.  Do yourself a favor. Go to the Applebee's on Salinas instead.
Sue J.,"San Jose, CA",0,21,9,4.0,8/27/2015,"Good place to stop while shopping at the outlets. Had the 3 appies for $14~ good deal. Ample amount of food to share for 2 people. Service was pretty good, a little slow getting the bill."
Maddie W.,"Soquel, CA",0,14,1,1.0,8/25/2014,"After school shopping at the Gilroy Outlets for 7 1/2 hours, my family was extremely exhausted and soooooo hungry. Applebee's was the first thing we saw so we went there. We were seated and met our server who was very nice but she didn't come back to take our order for about a half an hour.  When she finally came back, I ordered the 4 cheese pasta with grilled honey pepper chicken. When it came, about an hour later, the pasta was coated in some sort of honey sauce that was not very good. All in all. Food: not so hot, Service: did we even have a waiter? Price: uncomfortable."
Shirin M.,"San Jose, CA",3,2,,1.0,12/21/2013,"Went there for lunch today with my wife to eat and relax after doing some Christmas shopping at the outlets. What a mistake! We were seated in about 10 minutes and the food came about 15 minutes later. I ordered the Cedar Salmon and my wife ordered the Chicken & shrimp. The smell of fish was so bad and the plate was so dirty that I refused to eat it. My wife's food was not any better. The spanish rice was cold and dry, she only had a bite and didn't eat anything else. we complained to the manager, got up and left. The iced tea was good : ) and that's why we gave them one star. No more Applebee's for us . Max San Jose"
Chris R.,"Stockton, CA",99,3,10,4.0,5/10/2015,Not only were they quick and speedy but they were funny and most of all warm. You don't feel that often!  I'm local but rarely come here... I'm gonna work on that.
April R.,"Milpitas, CA",18,19,16,5.0,11/19/2014,"For a party of 8, we were seated very promptly as they prepared our table. Our waiter was very kind and very attentive bringing us refills and extra sauces without asking. The appetizers that we chose, about 4-5 different kinds, came out within 15 mins. The appetizers tastes really fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the chicken wonton tacos  soooo good! Three people at our table ordered spirits and those didn't take too long to come from the full bar. Our dinner was out before we knew it, hot and delicious! I had the bourbon street style chicken and shrimp with mashed potatoes, yummy! I would definitely go back!!"
Karissa T.,"Morgan Hill, CA",34,2,,1.0,11/27/2013,Food wasn't too bad but the service we got from our young waiter was.. Just seemed like he didn't care to be there at all.. We asked about happy hour and he said there wasn't anything on a happy hour menu. He just didn't want to explain anything I guess because towards the end of our meal we had finally came across a happy hour menu posted on wall. Christian was not a very good waiter..very unattentive.. I don't know if he was just having a bad day or what but I think he probably shouldn't have a position that has to do with customer service if that's how he is on the regular.  It also smelt pretty bad in there. Definitely not how a restaurant should smell. Smelt like something was rotting or something!
Daniel G.,"Hollister, CA",1,2,,1.0,7/17/2015,"Our breadsticks were burnt and the food wasn't the best, deals were bad and when we asked for extra chili they brought us a whole other appetizer"
Jim C.,"Panama City Beach, FL",6,29,4,3.0,3/8/2014,"While this isn't the best food I ever ate, it's not that bad.  The service is pretty good. The food is descent. My only real problem is that they don't have a lot of lighter fare.  Sometimes you want a good salad with grilled chicken.  But I guess no one is forcing me to eat here.  I give it a solid 3 stars."
Debbie D.,"Salinas, CA",32,113,22,1.0,4/22/2013,"We will NEVER patronize this location again - Manager is not competent and ignorant to laws regarding disabled patrons. I was very disappointed and offended with the manager on duty who questioned us and violated HIPAA laws when my party included a person who requires a service animal and was clearly tagged.  I am absolutely disgusted that my family would be subjected to this type of interrogation and scrutiny by Applebee's management.  Even when I respectfully gave him information at the end of our meal to not question people with a service animal by asking for the diagnosis, he had the audacity to still challenge me as to why he should.  Service staff is great by the way. If you require a service animal - Beware of the incompetent Manager and interrogation to follow!!"
Jade G.,"Glendale, CA",0,6,,1.0,3/26/2016,"This is the second time I have eaten at Applebee's and the food, every dish, was terrible!  I don't think I will be bringing my family back to Applebee's ever again.  Overpriced and poorly prepared."
Joanna P.,"Gilroy, CA",0,3,,5.0,7/4/2015,This place deserves 5 stars!! Their servers are super friendly and fast! The food is great! Nothing to complain about here
Erica S.,"San Jose, CA",248,1371,348,3.0,9/30/2011,"Typically Applebee's.  Came here to eat lunch in an AC environment since it was a hot day outside.  Since it was a Labor Day Monday, the place was pretty crowded, but luckily, only had to wait about 5 minutes to sit in the bar section.  We later heard them announcing on the speaker outside that there was no wait for a seat at the bar.   My husband and I shared the 2 for $20 deal.  We had the Boneless Wings for appetizers and had the Oriental Chicken Salad and Riblet Basket.  The salad was pretty big portion that I couldn't finish it all.  The riblets were good as it was not too sweet and easy to eat.  For $20, you can't complain with the food.  Our server seemed pretty young, but she was quick and attentive.  Too bad the parking here sucks because's it's in the outlet parking lot."
