A Z.,"Hollister, CA",45,133,151,3.0,1/4/2015,It's obviously not gourmet. But they have good drinks and appetizers. My favorite is the sweet potato fries
Nancy C.,"San Francisco, CA",39,36,7,4.0,1/15/2013,"This was my first time at Applebee's, mostly because I tend to gravitate towards food places/restaurants that aren't chains (except for McDonald's and Burger King). Also, I saw an ad for Applebee's the night before, talking about their $9.99 specials or whatever, so I was intrigued.  So, I came here on Sunday with two other people. We were seated at a booth by this one girl standing at the entrance. She gave us our menus and we deliberated for a long time since their $9.99 deal or whatever it is (it's like one entree with some other things for a certain price that's offered everyday except for Sunday) wasn't offered that day. We ultimately decided on getting the two entree and appetizer for only $20. Now, the menu is kind of tricky because it says 2 entrees for $20. I asked our server - I'm pretty sure her name is Cyndi - if appetizers were included in that $20 and she said yes. Obviously, I was all excited because the portions, judging from others' tables, looked huge and the options available seemed delicious. We ordered BBQ chicken nugget things which came with celery and ranch, and our two entrees were: Oriental Chicken Salad and Southwest Shrimp Fettuccine. I also asked for three plates since we were sharing. Our server asked us if we wanted everything at once and we said yes. We ordered waters (drinks aren't included in this $20 deal thing), and waited for our food to come. This place has really great decor. I'm a huge fan of old vintage novelties and just sitting there was great. Anyways, our food came after about ten minutes and the three of us finished the entrees and appetizer after 45 minutes or so. The BBQ chicken nugget things were sooooo good. There were actually quite a lot of pieces for an appetizer and it was seasoned nicely and the flavor was great. There's nothing else to really say about this since they were just good. The Southwest Shrimp Fettuccine was slightly spicy, but came with an abundance of shrimp. The noodles were covered in a creamy white sauce that was slightly saltier than it should have been. But with the shrimp and some beans and corn included in it, the dish was more spicy than salty. The flavor was good, especially since I'm a fan of spicy food. The Oriental Chicken Salad was alright. I'm not a fan of sweet dressing, which well, it was. The lettuce and stuff seemed to be taken out of one of those salad kits you get at Costco - it was shredded and seemed pre-packaged. However, the grilled chicken (we got a choice between fried or grilled) was super good. It wasn't tough; it was tender, there was a lot of it, and it was filling. There were also little fried noodles in it, which, I suppose, makes it ""oriental."" Gosh, they should really change the name of this dish... But that's besides the point. Our server came back again and gave us the check after we asked. We paid and then she came back with our change. I didn't notice it until after we paid, but there was a small hand-written note on top of the receipt that said ""Thank you! =)"" with a hand-drawn heart and I think the person's name was Angie. .... Our server was probably Angie then? Or Cyndi? I don't really know, but whoever it was, it was a nice personal touch!  Anyway, our total came out to be $21 and some cents. For three dishes - since the appetizer came with so much chicken it basically counted as a freaking entree - for $21, it was a steal! And with great service - food came quickly, server was nice and attentive, that personal note on the receipt, and having our server actually say bye to us as we left - this was a good meal."
VikkiJo Y.,"Fresno, CA",42,6,2,1.0,9/6/2014,So this is my first time in this establishment and was not impressed.  I came in just before and walked to the bar. Bartender not wearing a name tag did not greet me just said what'll you have? I responded with a jack and diet in a pint glass. He was walking away as I said what I wanted and in the 4 feet from me in the bar turned to make the drink and did not remember half of the order. That's right he did not remember diet coke and he put it in a rocks glass. When he brought it back I said hey let's start this again. I would like a jack and diet coke in a pint glass. He repeated me and now I have been sitting here for 18 minutes and he has not come to ask me anything. Guess I won't be getting lunch.
Jess V.,"Gilroy, CA",0,9,5,1.0,2/27/2016,"The only good thing was the Sangria. Our appetizer was COLD , dirty plates and horrible service."
Lauren Y.,"Long Beach, CA",0,29,,1.0,1/17/2013,"Came here for lunch one day while shopping at the outlets. Not much variety down there so settled for a recognizable place. First step in, the place reeks of feet. This place is smelly and sticky.  I had salad and the boyfriend had a burger. The food was average, nothing special. But I can think of a lot of other restaurants that a 12 dollar salad and burger would be a lot more memorable. Will not be back!"
Armando R.,"Round Rock, TX",11,33,4,1.0,12/21/2014,"Was doing some Christmas shopping with my wife at the outlets and decided to eat here for lunch. Both ordered burgers and food came out quickly, but that is where things went wrong. My wife's burger had a 3"" black hair inside it, which caused her to instantly loose her appetite. Then after a few bites of my burger I noticed the meat was raw. Pointed out to the waitress that the back half of the buns were soaked red with blood. The remainder of the day I had a severe stomach ache. Myself and my family with never be returning to this restaurant again."
Sonia H.,"San Jose, CA",13,6,,5.0,2/15/2015,"My girlfriend and I had our Valentine's dinner here and everything was fabulous, the food and the customer service was outstanding. We can not wait to go back. I highly recommend Applebees in Gilroy,CA. Our wait was very minimal as well"
Joyce E.,"Daly City, CA",138,1014,2098,1.0,8/1/2014,"Wow this is probably the worst diner food I've ever had! My mom and I were shopping at the Gilroy outlets and was raving about some Quesadilla Burger that Applebee's had on the menu, so I gave in. When we arrived, we were greeted by a host who asked who was nice enough to honor our preference of a booth. We were seated within 5 minutes and were given our menus and met our server, who was extremely nice and attentive! After scanning through the menu, I noticed that Applebee's has a lot of ""deals"" going on (i2 for $20 special etc) In addition to the artichoke dip, I decided on the Chicken Fried Chicken that came with mashed potatoes and a house blend of vegetables and my mom ordered her Quesadilla Burger. The food was so bland and honestly was not worth the price! It reminded me of food that I could get an old folk's home! Ugh never again."
Jenny P.,"Gilroy, CA",86,40,3,1.0,12/14/2014,"I called to order on the phone 3 times! The first two times i was put on hold for about 10 mins. The 3rd time i complained and finally took my order. Horrible food presentation! I bought an entree today and when I opened it, it looked loke someone ate half of it already. For a $14 food I would rather go to bj's and get more of what I pay for. Zero star if I could"
Sarah C.,"Marina, CA",109,141,8,1.0,5/23/2013,"Ordered the steak.... Yeah it was terrible, ordered it medium rare and it came 2 seconds off of burnt. My potato portion... Was 4 cubes of potatoes. My spinach was decent but small portioned. Now grant it I ordered the healthy entree and that could explain it but good good give me more food for my money. Others at the table got burgers and it tasted like cardboard, bacon had no flavor. And blue cheese that was on 1 had absolutely no taste to it.  Fries came prefrozen, but at least they were seasoned. But the portion was so small that it doesn't make up for it. And the onion rings were uninspired. The wonton chicken tacos were good but not enough for any stars. Server hardly checked on us."
David J.,"Fresno, CA",1,3,,1.0,7/25/2016,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS APPLEBEE'S, the worst experience service wise, ordered 2 for twenty oriental chicken salad and hamburger oriental salad was like someone grabbed a handful of salad threw it on the plate, chicken not cut up literally like chicken nuggets clumps of dressing on plate, Hamburger raw in middle got constant looks of discust from hostess due to fact I set myself and family, she stated 20 minute wait but failed to let us know the high tops in bar area was available seating, she said I'm not concerned about those areas all the while 5 booths were available when I was 10 min into wait. Server never introduced himself. Never was given menus or silver ware .no sign of manager or bus boys for that matter. Overcharged on meal even after returning undercooked Hamburger. Much more to go on about but not enough space. So please if your in Gilroy shopping at outlets DO NOT STOP AT THIS APPLEBEE'S TO EAT do your self a favor  there's an in and out closer better service"
Rosquete B.,"Belmont, CA",17,950,366,3.0,3/30/2013,"Gilroy; part of the chain Hamburger type fare Great bargain: 1 appetizer, 2 entrees for $20 Crowded; loud Sports bar Crazy memorabilia on walls Good food service Good for families"
Cristina J.,"Salinas, CA",0,7,,4.0,11/7/2015,"service was friendly, fast and efficient. I have been to other applebees where the service is not great and we end up taking more time waiting to be seated than eating. That is not the case with this applebees.  We were seated within 10 min. on a Saturday evening, our waitress was attentive and quick.  The food was good too, we ordered the sirloin and shrimp, house salads and the Oriental salad."
Kenny S.,"Morgan Hill, CA",133,121,3,2.0,4/23/2012,"THE ADVENTURES OF KIM AND CHI #6 Kim and Chi have some gift cards for Applebee's, so they decide to use them. ""Gosh Chi, we haven't been here in ages."" ""I know, let's see if it's any better than some of the reviews we read."" Chi orders a beer.  It has no head, is not really cold, and is not filled to the rim - because of the missing head.  He takes a sip. ""What the...I think this beer has been sitting at the bar for a while.  I'm going to get a new one."" ""Don't make a scene,"" Kim pleads.  Chi walks to the bar and a server nearby (not Chi's server) asks if he can help.  Chi explains his beer situation to him. ""Well, I can't believe we would serve it that way,"" exclaims the server.  Chi stands there for a minute with his mouth open, wondering if that was a feeble attempt at an apology on behalf of the restaurant or an indictment of Chi's honesty. ""Don't care if you believe it or not; that's how my beer came.""  Crap, Kim won't be happy with that, Chi thinks.  She said not to make a scene.  The server kind of shakes his head incredulously.  Therefore, Chi feels obligated to  give him the ""stink eye.""  Mercifully, the bartender comes over and Chi gives him the same story.  He pours Chi another beer, cold, with a head...exactly how he expected it in the first place.  Problem solved. ""Thanks, man, that looks perfect,"" Chi says.  As he walks back to his table, Chi raises his glass to the dumb-ass server still lingering about. Dinner comes.  Kim order penne and grilled chicken in alfredo sauce.  The meal was rather dry...hardly any sauce. ""How's your pasta, Kim,"" Chi asks. ""Eh, I ordered this because I like alfredo sauce...wish it had some."" ""Sorry,"" Chi says.  ""Guess the reviews for here aren't far off."" Is Applebee's horrible...no.  Could it be way better...absolutely.  Right now, it's just fancy fast food with beer. STAY TUNED FOR THE NEXT INSTALLMENT OF THE ADVENTURES OF KIM AND CHI."
Stephanie R.,"Gilroy, CA",104,58,22,2.0,3/10/2013,"They have a decent happy hour with half off any of their appetizers, but that's about the only thing  enjoyable about this particular Applebee's. Their drinks are generally horrible, Long Islands taste like some type of syrup, ugh.  Their is one bartender who is really awesome, but aside from her, there are not any waiters who have stood out or done anything to be note worthy, usually end up waiting for forever to get food or drinks."
L C.,"Gilroy, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/18/2012,"Love watching your servers hot box there cars on there lunch breaks..classy also, bartender Dex drinking on the job?...someone will be reporting that one to the district manager"
Ken L.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,51,,1.0,8/8/2013,The food literally tastes like chemicals.  Also it was severely crowded and smelly when I went there. Never returning. Sorry 'bout it.
Ron C.,"Evergreen, San Jose, CA",143,13,22,1.0,3/9/2014,"I personally enjoy eating at applebee's but this applebee's was something else. Our server, was very attentative at first to our needs despite the massive crowd that appears to be common here however as dinner progressed that attention as well as getting any server's attention was non-existant.  When we were first seated (a booth) my girlfriend's seat was wet along with scraps of meat and bread on the unwiped table, which happened to also have small flies around (as do all the other booths to pur surprise). Our appetizer took 15 minutes to receive and our mealstook another 15 minutes. The chicken penne (the limited time one) along with the happy and energetic nature of our server, steph, is the only reasons why this place is even receiving a star. The audacity of the other waiters to be rude and failing to respond to a simple ""excuse me"" is let alone a let down on it's own.  To be honest, you're better off waiting the line at in-n-out or going mcdonalds haha."
Jojo L.,"Gilroy, CA",139,16,15,1.0,2/6/2014,"Never coming here again, well maybe just for a Veterans day  because it's free meals for Veterans....  Manger is inept and overweight douche bag (negative stars), food was ok (2 stars) server was young and dumb (1 star).  So this place gets 1 star.  Horrible."
Brandon B.,"San Jose, CA",145,62,80,3.0,7/23/2014,My wife and I came here to try out their twofer specials and it worked out pretty well. The food was only OK but we did both get lobster and steak with drinks for less that $60 total. Applebee's is a good last minute spot for couples but don't expect to be blown away; just be happy that there's a full bar.
