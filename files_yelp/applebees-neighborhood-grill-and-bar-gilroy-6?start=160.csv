Connie C.,"Orange County, CA",633,392,1135,3.0,3/19/2012,"The restaurant is like any other Applebee's. The service here was ok, but there was an incident with two waitresses that had a little fight, kind of unprofessional...Made it a bit awkward, but our waitress was very sweet still. We ordered the two entrees and one appetizer meal for $20. The appetizer that we ordered is honey BBQ wings which was good! I love that it had a crisp to it due to the honey! The entree that I ordered was a seven ounce steak that was over cooked and not tender. The mashed potatoes tasted good and the vegetables were very soggy. The other entree was a chicken and shrimp dish that was on a skillet. The chicken was plain but very juicy. The shrimp was a bit too salty for me and whatever that green sauce was on top...didn't mix with the flavor.  Overall, this place is ok."
Doug G.,"Kodak, TN",10,98,,4.0,5/17/2014,For an Applebee's it was a nice visit .The food was good and served on time.  What made the visit above average was our server Monica L.  She was great!!
J L.,"Newark, NJ",77,33,96,1.0,9/14/2014,"Service was ridiculous. The host acknowledged me.  Walked away, and never came back.  I sat myself down at a non wiped down table.  Order was wrong when it came out, and finally got to eat once I got some utensils."
Paul R.,"San Jose, CA",1,2,,1.0,9/13/2014,How can you mess up a burger? Well go to this Applebee's and find out! The best thing about this place is the beer
Meghan W.,"Penryn, CA",726,144,52,2.0,12/8/2011,Please shoot me... Get those pagers! How can one enjoy eating when you are constantly announcing the next table ready to be seated? Every 1-2 minutes the hostesses is announcing a name and it is just about the most annoying thing ever. I dont expect this to be fine dining but honestly.... This is out of control. They announce the names at least 3 times. I cannot even talk to the person in front of me without having the loud speaker interrupt at least a dozen times.  Applebee's... Please get some pagers. Your patrons will thank you!  Oh... And the flys are not helping!
T N.,"Gilroy, CA",0,7,,2.0,9/24/2015,"Though the Thai Chicken salad was good,  it was so small it was like an appetizer size. Ridiculous especially since it was the price of a large salad."
Jacqueline S.,"Gilroy, CA",38,2,,1.0,7/31/2014,"My boyfriend and I went in for a few drinks and to play trivia. We were excluded from multiple rounds. It would have been ok, but this was not the first time this had happened. We were also l neglected by the bartender,  though the story was very different when I had gone in with girlfriends another time. For a family restaurant, the food is salty, the staff is unprofessional and sleazy. I will probably never go there again..."
Derrick L.,"San Francisco, CA",24,171,17,1.0,8/4/2012,"Have not been here in years, and the food (lunch) was a lot worse than I remember. I tried the fried-green-tomato BLT sandwich. I did not heed the warning of the calorie count, and suffered. It was a gross amalgamation of fats, butters, and oils. It was really awful. If they just left out the cheese, buttered bread, it might pass for a tasty sandwich. As it is, it's gross. The spouse had some sort of shrimp pasta that she said was fine, but looked typically oversauced to me. Oh, I did order a frozen lemonade that was refreshing on a hot day. But, the sandwich was so bad, I have to give them one star. Blah."
M. L.,"Gilroy, CA",5,51,11,1.0,2/22/2014,"The girls in the front need to try something called a smile. We requested another booth because the booth was so large it was uncomfortable. We asked the hostess how much longer for another booth. She said ""I don't know."" She basically walked off because she was acting like she didn't want to help us. Then a minute later they call another table with the same amount of ppl. We had to request a open booth and they seemed really annoyed to help us. Mind you I have two elderly parents. Then half way through our dinner one hostess came to sweep right by our table looking a mess too. Her hair was falling out of place from her ponytail. It was not professional at all."
Alyssa L.,"Santa Teresa, San Jose, CA",282,213,151,4.0,3/16/2014,"My fiend and I came in for drinks and sat the bar so I can't really critique the food. Our waiter was very attentive and checked on us quite frequently, constantly asking us if we wanted a second round or any appetizers. The Arnold Palmer and the margarita were both delicious. A nice mid-way refreshing stop if you are walking the Gilroy Outlets!"
Mike O.,"Gilroy, CA",11,13,30,5.0,8/28/2013,"You know this Applebee's has some harsh critics. Ill tell you what... Ask for Monica. She is amazing. You can't beat the 2 for 20. Tv's with a bar. I mean really, what are you gonna expect, five star hospitality. It's a chain restaurant. I guess you just have to know what's good and what's not. Let me tell ya what. If you get to the restaurant and do not know what you want and just gonna wing it and it's no good, well that's your fault I would say most people who come in here know what to expect. Don't have crazy high standards, but I will say what we order is consistent and completely worth the dollar. Would highly recommend it."
Tanya Y.,"San Jose, CA",1,46,4,1.0,11/10/2014,"Probably the worse service I have ever received. Went here with my husband and 2 kids before heading to the outlets for shopping. We were seated within 7 minutes at lunch rush so that was nice. Service was non existent after that. It took 10 mins for server to even get to our table. Waited another 7 minutes for strawberry lemonades. Then the server comes up to us and says, ""I'm going on break, Victor will be taking good care of you and the kids food should be up shortly."" We were like good maybe this one will be better. WRONG! Waited another 15-20 minutes for our food. Kids food came out with ours and my daughter never received her strawberry yogurt that was suppose to come with her food. WILL NOT be back to this location! The only part that was quick was when Victor collected our credit card for payment. That was record time."
Elizabeth H.,"Morgan Hill, CA",19,63,2,4.0,4/11/2014,Always a good experience here at Applebee's   Good food good service.  Our waiter Nicholas was courteous and very attentive.
Hylary L.,"Morgan Hill, CA",175,334,4,2.0,6/12/2013,"Yikes! It's been years since I've been to this (or any) Applebee's, but my husband and I decided to stop by for lunch since I had a gift card. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because our server was very sweet and attentive. Other than that...eep! The restaurant was hot, muggy and smelled like mildew. The table was sticky and there was food crusted in between the pages of some of the menus. There was food on the ground under the tables. When our meal arrived it was kind of slopped on the plate, with sauce flung to one side, sides on the other...zero presentation. What my husband ordered looked like a Lean Cuisine that had been heated in the microwave and them dumped upside down onto the plate. Like I said, our server was kind so that's a plus. Regardless, we will not be returning!"
Briana V.,"Milpitas, CA",1,3,5,5.0,7/15/2015,"Five stars for the best server my mom has ever had, Christian Sánchez. She called yesterday and asked if she could make a reservation and a girl told her that She wouldn't need one. She went in today with a party for 10 and the hostess told her it would be a 45 minute wait. She was out for a company lunch and needed to get out of there quickly. She saw Christian and he's been our waiter before so She asked him if there was any way he could get her and her lunch invites in sooner and he gladly said he would set up a couple of tables and wait on them himself. He did a great job and got them out of there in a timely matter. My mom greatly appreciates his positive attitude and his kind service. Servers like him keep us coming back."
Kevin L.,"Foster City, CA",33,5,,1.0,3/21/2015,"I come here almost every time I shop at the outlets. Not because its great, but because its really the only thing around besides fast food and the food is decent. Thier service has always been sub-par, but this time it was just abysmal. I ordered a BLT and I don't know how they messed up my order, but I got tilapia instead. The waiter tried to explain that he had written down tilapia next to my BLT. Everyone makes mistakes, fair enough. Then my BLT came and it looked like they were about to make a grilled cheese sandwich but decided to use the bread for my sandwich instead. On top of that they put 3 strips of bacon instead of the advertised 6. When I got the bill I was still charged for the tilapia, but he gave me a discount by subtracting some random item I never ordered. This might be the last  I come here."
Nick L.,"San Mateo, CA",82,1025,13,1.0,1/11/2012,"This was a parental request as I doubt I'd come here of my own free will. Especially to this version. It's not because the food was bad, it was ok a bit better than average. However the service was appalling. I've been to many places and luckily although not frequent when a server messes up they apologize and offer something on the house. Here? No chance. Hardly an apology for spilling a whole glass of water over my wife and myself. And no, this soda is on me etc. Other places do this as a matter of course but this place failed. To me it's accepted practice and common decency. Lucky it was not soda or anything stronger because that would have been a real smack in the face. Even service after this (water spill at the start) was patchy at best. The spinach and artichoke dip was good but really after that initial disaster it's hard to rate this place above 1 star even if it served world class food which it doesn't at all!!"
Jen S.,"San Jose, CA",2,171,6,1.0,7/24/2011,"I should have read the reviews first. After being seated, we waited a good 15 mins without even being acknowledged by any of the wait staff. I went back to the host after a table behind us was seated after us and a waiter came up to them right away. WTH? When I went to the hostess to ask if someone could take our order, instead of apologizing and saying someone would be there, she said ""We/They didn't know you were there."" How is that possible? You're the one who sat us there and 5-6 waiters passed us by! We ordered an appetizer but our meals came first, not because it was late but because the waiter FORGOT. On top of that when the appetizer did arrive it was the WRONG one. When the right appetizer did arrive we were pretty much done with our meal. To add insult to injury, they still charged us for the appetizer.  They weren't even apologetic for their mistakes. The staff clearly doesn't give a crap because they know the people from the outlets will keep them busy."
Rachel B.,"East Bridgewater, MA",1139,645,175,1.0,1/13/2009,"How to Ruin Mac & Cheese, by Applebee's:  1. Don't bake it! It wouldn't be cost effective to bake a fresh batch.... but wait, all of Applebee's food tastes like it was frozen anyways. Hmmmm  2. Make a cream sauce. Mac & Cheese should be slimey, right? Who would want their Mac to be a solid mass of cheese and noodles?!  3. Don't use Macaroni noodles. Penne pasta is more interesting anyways, according to Applebees.  4. Don't use sharp cheddar OR any flavorful cheese. If everything in the bowl is bland, then the garlic toast will stand out. Caz obviously I'm ordering Mac & Cheese for the garlic toast.  5. Charge $12 for it. Caz customers are paying to ""eat good in the neighborhood"" and all the neighborhood places I go would charge $12 for sauteed, pre-frozen penne and velveta."
Lisa T.,"San Mateo, CA",45,64,,2.0,6/24/2013,"Last time I went to this chain the food was so below par I didn't eat it.  Luckily, I wasn't paying.  Against my better judgment, I went last night on the way back from a road trip with friends who were hungry.  Surprisingly, the food was decent, but I also ordered a shrimp salad - an item that was hard to mess up.   Unfortunately, a trip to the restroom was the place's undoing.  Smelled so wretched, I decided to hold it for the hour long drive back home.  When I brought it up to my server, she said they ""check the bathroom every 30 minutes,"" but would advise the hostess.  They may very well ""check it,"" but no one is lifting a finger - and I guarantee that place hadn't seen a cleaning product since its doors opened for lunch. Odors like that make it hard to keep a decent meal down."
