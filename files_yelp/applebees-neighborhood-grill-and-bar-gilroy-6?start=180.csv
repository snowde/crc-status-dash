Michael G.,"Gilroy, CA",61,3,,1.0,3/11/2014,"I cannot believe that no one has mentioned the three drink limit! No more than three beers or well drinks... God help you if you order a top shelf (where they actually put alcohol in the drink), then you are limited to one and a beer. Service sucked at 9 pm and the place was basically deserted (it was a Sunday night). Food took FOREVER to arrive. Chili's or Famous Dave's on 152 is a much better deal and has a ton of more atmosphere..."
Vithiet L.,"San Francisco, CA",108,197,4,4.0,12/19/2010,"Yes, 4 stars for an Applebee's. Why, God why? Well because it's an Applebee's. My expectations for a chain restaurant are pretty low. The only reason I went there is because I was way hungry and way tired from Outlet Shopping to go anywhere  else. I was happily surprised. The service was very nice & friendly yet professional. The food was very decent and like all the chains, plentiful. Plus they have Shock Top on tap and not the usual Blue Moon you find everywhere, and well, I like it better. It made me feel like I'd WANT to go back next time I go to the Outlets. So there."
Rick R.,"Gilroy, CA",14,34,1,1.0,5/31/2013,"Food and service great, but to allow smoking at the door sucks, could not avoid walking thru it, im allergic, next time ill goto dennys"
Dave M.,"San Jose, CA",4,20,1,5.0,9/28/2011,"I went to dinner here the other night, and the service was superb, the food awesome, and the ambience was great.... The servers were excited, and exuberant, and paid close attention through the whole meal, dessert, and drinks. I was extremely satisfied and recommend this experience for anyone in the area, or driving through. To have this level of service, the manager of this restaurant must be outstanding, and pay close attention to their staff with training and praise. This manager should be given a raise and a promotion."
Jeff M.,"San Jose, CA",56,181,327,2.0,2/24/2011,Brought a wet salad plate and had to assure us it was clean. I hope the health inspector finds it clean.
Rinky N.,East Bay,717,1102,2200,1.0,7/11/2008,My brother came by the other night to get some take out food.  He asked for a menu and then asked if they had anything vegetarian.   The staff of 3  or 4 snickered and laughed.   My brother walked out.   How rude!  It's no wonder there are so many one star ratings. I've been to other Applebees and they have offered to make me a vegetarian dish.
Alejandra C.,"Morgan Hill, CA",184,1,,1.0,2/15/2014,My family and I went to Applebee's for a birthday celebration. The table where we were seated smelled like urine. The table was sticky and dirty. I ordered the Cedar Salmon and it smelled foal. The overall experience was very poor. I don't recommend it at all. We are never coming back again. The staff is very friendly though.
Zan O.,"North Hills, Los Angeles, CA",364,838,204,1.0,9/8/2010,"Ewww wow I wished someone could have please warned me. Money down the drain. I thought this place would be like Chilis or TGIF. So wrong, so wrong. Service was nice and friendly. Their food was the one of the worst things I have ever put into my mouth. Well then again maybe it was what I ordered. My friends said it was my fault for ordering orange"
Gloria W.,"Angels Camp, CA",19,3,,1.0,3/11/2012,"We had lunch here with friends a couple of months ago. We were busy talking and failed to notice that our waiter did not return my husband's credit card. When we noticed it missing we called the restaurant and spoke with the manager who insisted none of his waiters would take a credit card belonging to a customer. However, there were 3 charges that we did not make before we discovered the card missing. Fortunately AMEX said that they would turn the matter over to their fraud investigator and we would not be held responsible for the unauthorized charges. Needles to say, we will not be returning to the Gilroy Applebees."
Bobby K.,"Gilroy, CA",53,71,10,2.0,4/20/2013,"Only time I come here is when my friend asks to go during happy hour for appetizers. We load up some sliders.The waiters and waitresses are decent here. They're polite and friendly, but we sometimes go for ten minutes without hearing back from them. Of course, we do get the ones who truly DESERVE that tip.  Aside from that, theirs nothing really special about this chain restaurant."
oldvolkz G.,"Hollister, CA",2,31,6,3.0,10/20/2010,"Applebee's has been and is my favorite chain restaurant. Was their for dinner on a Thursday night. Despite the football game the restaurant was slow/ steady. We had the 2 for 20 deal and what a deal. 2 full entres plus an appattizer for 20 dollars!! You can't beat that. Our waitress was excelent, food was killer but when I got my app I asked for more ranch from the food runner and never got it. Then like ten minutes later a manager(she had a solid collar shirt,I think those are managers)came and asked ""if everything was ok"" I said everything was fine but that I needed some more ranch. She smiled and said "" I'll get that for you right away"" but it never came. We finished our meal still left a tip. Next time i'll ask my server. She was busy but I have a feeling she would of brought it the first time I asked. 3 stars for food & service from our server. Would of got a 5 star review. To bad managment droped the ball on this one."
Erica M.,"Gilroy, CA",0,11,1,5.0,1/27/2014,We love going to this Apple Bees.  The bartenders are great and the servers are quick.  We like to go here for their Happy hour specials which are not only held during Happy Hour Times but also during Hockey or Football games.  Cannot beat low cost drinks and half off appetizers.
Sharon H.,"San Jose, CA",4,10,,3.0,7/7/2012,"James, our waiter was the highlight of the lunch meal.  He was very attentive, funny, thorough and we tipped him well. The meal was as expected at Applebee's.  Nothing to rave about but edible. We loved James and think he should be made Server of the month if they have such a thing.            If you go for lunch as for James  he is worth it. Funny bathroom situation..........line out the door into the hallway for the two holer women's room so we started using the men's.   When the last man standing came out of the men's he stood guard so the ladies could use the facilities.   And this was a lunch, can't imagine the back up during happy hours."
Grace H.,"San Jose, CA",346,99,6,2.0,4/9/2011,"Food here is alright but besides the awesome bartenders, service is terrible!!!! Can't really blame them them though because it does get extremely busy. It's a shame that I keep coming back for the happy hour (I think 9 or 10 to closing daily). Gilroy needs more/better bars."
Marigold M.,"Fremont, CA",15,166,98,2.0,9/1/2014,"I would never eat here again. Our waiter took our order but that's not what came out. We constantly had to ask for things because our order was not what we asked for. And when we asked for things that's still not what our waiter brought to us. Our food was not even hot. It was barely even warm. I had to ask for the rest of my kids order because it didn't come out at the same time. Overall I'm disappointed at this resturants ability to hand a busy resturant. Our waiters excuse to us was that ""it's really busy in the back"" so I took that as you guys are busy and our food will not be hot."
Rose F.,"South San Francisco, CA",42,422,504,4.0,2/27/2011,"We always stop here during our visit to the Gilroy Premium Outlet's which is like once a month sometimes two.  We love the new Weight Watcher menu options along with their regular menu.  Our usually order: a good cold ice beer on draft (Sam Adams), Asian Paradise Salad, Buffalo Wings, and a burger after a hard day of shopping.   Serve is good most of the time.  Never come here around lunch time - there's always a wait on weekend's.  Love the decor."
Mrs F.,"Redwood City, CA",12,27,8,1.0,8/11/2012,"ONE STAR ONLY BECAUSE I HAVE TO. Horrible service .  We stopped by on a weekday , (""less busy day)"" my daughter wa hungry so i figured we can stop by and grab early lunch... Well I was WRONG.  We get there and it already takes FOREVER just for waitress to take our drinks order ... I order a cocktail.... Then a couple came after us. They got there order and drinks before us... Well that was annoying, okay then we FINALLY GOT our phone order mind u still NO DRINKS. Then after 15 min we FINALLY GOT OUR DRINKS... Okay the couple across from us order right after us and their food was ready... Okay we waited for ANOTHER ten minutes and we asked a random waitress if we can get the manager... After 15 minutes NOTHING. no food no manager... It seemed like all the ""managers"" we're in a meeting .. So my lovely mother went over there and the so called ""manger"" said ""ok ill be right there in a VERY RUDE manner so we decided to just leave... the manger tried to apologize but it was already tooooo late...  Never never going back .. Atleast we got a couple of free drinks.. Which were not all that great...  Get better managers and waitress who are no racist.. I'm sure that's what it was. No other logical explanation. Racist racist racist... -1 is my rating."
Alicia C.,"San Jose, CA",158,18,9,1.0,12/30/2014,"Dropped in shortly after 3pm last Saturday to take a break from shopping. I ordered some chicken wings and fried greenbeans, the chicken looked amazing when it was served. As I was starving, I went straight to the chicken wings which looked ptlump ONLY TO FIND THEY WERE RAW. Yes, I had a mouthful of raw chicken and swallowed a good part of it thinking perhaps it was just cold. Then I realized what was happening and threw up. Aside from the negligence in the kitchen, the manager: Andrea Dias, came out to take a report. She was apologetic and said she would cover our bill given what had just happened. About an hour later when we were on our way out, we were slammed with the full bill for everything we ate/drank. I asked Andrea for an explanation and she said she took off the chicken wings.  How magnificent ... and of course I have AppleBees insurance calling me now for a recorded statement of what happened.  Please .... my advise to all is STAY AWAY from this place. They are very careless with customers and take NO RESPONSIBILITY for their actions.  I have been not been able to eat much since then, not to mention the painful diarrhea that has kept me away from work this week."
Renato M.,"San Francisco, CA",1,14,1,1.0,8/22/2013,"One of the worst Applebee's' experience that I've had.. To sum up: Terrible service Average food No bathroom Bathroom: The staff said their bathroom is under construction and there was a white bathroom outside (that looked like a container or a huge generator from the outside of it).. I get that at least it is something and that they would be worst off without nothing, but it did made our experience at the restaurant worse.. Service: Went there with my mom after some shopping. We were greeted at the front and they didn't get my mom's name correct... Her name is common and my guess is that they didn't really pay attention and didn't want to ask again. We were seated after maybe 5 minutes (was about 2pm) and I think they forgot about us at that moment. No water or anything was brought to us... We waited for 15 minutes easily before I stood up and energetically waved both my arms to get a waiter's attention.  Btw, do not expect that any waiter, other than the one serving you,  will care about you. 2 other waiters were looking directly at me during this 15 min period and they did notice me calling them (you can tell because they focus their eyes at you) only to look away... (I swear I could listen to one of them saying in his mind ""not my problem"" and walking away) Food: Finally we ordered and 5 minutes latter comes our waiter saying that they were out of some ingredients from the side dish from the orange chicken that my mom ordered, and if they could replace them with something else (I'm fine with that). Then because of the delay on my mom's food, my plate arrives early (not the best practice.. But ok...) And after some more time then her orange chicken finally arrives... And it tastes awful. Tasted like a poorly made chicken nugget with some orange seasoning on top.. She then asked to trade it for a ceasar salad wich was ok. Next time I am at the outlet I will consider other options and even McD. before this applebees again. Positive: To close this review with a positive note (and to make it worth one star instead of zero) the manager later did go over our table and apologized for the delay and for the bad chicken. We didn't get a discount or anything but at least it was something."
A S.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2,60,19,4.0,7/3/2014,Happy hour is awesome. Half priced appetizers & drinks. Service isn't the fastest but they have always had a smile on there face when serving us.
