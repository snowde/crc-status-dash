Selina S.,"Campbell, CA",52,307,237,1.0,8/16/2011,The food here and every other location is disgusting. Everytime I give this place another chance I'm just disappointed yet again with the food that is just slopped on my plate. The service  location I've been at. I won't ever be back!
Patricia A.,"San Francisco, CA",86,594,5,4.0,6/13/2009,"Paul is giving it four stars I am giving it 3 stars so after a game of rohsambo he won.  2 for $20 and $8 Perfect Margarita plus tax $34. $6 tip eat at the bar.  That is it simply we had the boneless wings, Fiesta Chicken plate and I had the riblets.  Good for $20 with an appetizer. Margarita served in 4 oz martini glass so the side car shaker gives you three more glasses for $8 is okay not grande.. We could of had desserts but the douche bags behind Paul were rubbing off on him and I was buying and driving so I couldn't have more than my 4oz x 3 margarita...it was missing something...oh yeah alcohol what was I thinking next time its straight tequila.... I have been here several times and strangely enough the bar is always open spot seating which worked too before 7pm. on a Friday night with the NHL playoffs going well Paul was happy and when you are a desperate single woman you put up with NHL and basketball and spinach needs..."
Allan T.,"San Francisco, CA",37,166,8,4.0,8/11/2009,"After a crazy day of walking around the outlets, we needed some food before we headed back to the city. Closest thing I could find was an Applebee's. Yeah classy place because I'm such a classy guy.. ha! No really, we were hungry and didn't care as long as we fed our monsters.  We did the 2 for $20 promo deal. I think this is a great gimmick because you get 2 entrees and 1 appetizer for 20 bucks. We both went for Angus burgers and the artichoke spinach dip appetizer. Wow that's some grubbin. Service was on it as they brought us more chips and salsa as we rant out.  Kudos to our server! Is applebee's ghetto? Eh it kinda is but hey whatevers.  I'm loving the 2 for $20 promo and it's not bad food.  I'd stop by here again when I roll through Gilroy and go outlet shopping again."
Jamie Lee C.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/5/2014,"My boyfriend, best friend and I went there for dinner and a late happy hour tonight... Our waiter was nice but didn't ask before he took our plates away (we weren't done with our food!) and he served both my boyfriend and I really bad desserts. His ice cream was soup and mine had a hair in it! GROSS! And our only comp? Taking off the crappy desserts from our check. Like I was going to keep eating around the hair? That is so unsanitary."
Erin O.,"Morgan Hill, CA",112,23,5,1.0,8/28/2008,Does anyone know about the three alcoholic drink maximum at Applebees?  It would be interesting to hear if anyone has heard of this - or been cut off while eating dinner and having three 12oz bottles of beer. Would love to know the corporations take on this - since I'm sure most of their revenue comes from sales of alcohol and not their horrific food.
Alie C.,"Santa Clara, CA",576,683,14,1.0,7/8/2010,I can't stand walking into a restaurant and not feeling welcome. The hosts here need to at least pretend to be happy to see the people coming in. The girl was also smacking bubblegum. Gross. The food was greasy and disgusting and the service was definitely lacking. We'd ask for something and it would take 5 minutes for us to get it. I left with a tummy ache and the desire to never step foot in an Applebee's again.
Es E.,"San Francisco, CA",11,48,13,1.0,5/29/2008,"Here's a copy of a complaint letter I sent to Applebee's. I realize it may fall on deaf ears but what we experienced was something we hope would not befall other unsuspecting would-be patrons: ""We arrived for lunch on Memorial Day and was informed that there would be a 20 - 25 minute wait. Seeing the queue we understood and patiently waited. Finally, after watching many other parties get seated ahead of us, we were seated after 45 minutes! (I understood what was happening - we were a party of 12 and the other patrons who were being seated earlier were smaller parties; however, I had informed the staff that since we had an elderly aunt with us sitting in the car outside that we did not mind being seated in different areas. Apparently, this was not taken into account.) When we were seated (at two adjacent tables), our server Rebekah gruffly asked for our drink orders, not even giving us a minute to breathe and consider our choices. By this point we were still patient and took into consideration that the restaurant was packed solid on a holiday. However, when she found that two of our party was missing she launched into a very condescending and rude tirade about if we weren't all at the table in five minutes we would have to leave! We tried to explain that having waited for about 45 minutes that the other people in the party were in the car in front of the restaurant. She would have none of it and as we protested being addressed in this manner she rudely insisted we should have been all waiting at the door for our table. At this point, many in our party were aghast at this treatment. I said that we should have another person serve us.  A server named Monica promptly swooped in and the service could not have been any more pleasant or different from Rebekah's. Her skill and demeanor quickly eased the tension and we persuaded my relatively weak aunt to calm down. The last thing we wanted was for her to have an attack right there and then! Monica informed us that, 'She gets that a lot.' (Possibly referring to other complaints being lodged at Rebekah.) Rebekah would be going on break. We were relieved and tried to enjoy our meal. My family are big travelers, are used to dining out and experiencing various levels of service and are usually patient and understanding of what happens in situations where the conditions aren't ideal. However, the treatment we received was inexcusable. I had been debating whether or not to file a complaint since I realize that Rebekah's employment might be negatively affected - but we did not pay good money to be abused in public.  To our chagrin, Rebekah returned to our table with a demeanor that was very solicitous, upbeat and what could be termed only as 'uncomfortably familiar'. This only succeeded in further making the situation more bizarre as this just gave us a sense of how she could just be absolutely false. We were, as the kids would say, 'weirded out'. Despite the impulse to do so, we left a 15% gratuity in line with proper etiquette (although we had even overheard the party behind us say that they weren't going to leave anything) .  Never again Applebee's. From this point on, if ever we're in a bind and we need to eat at this sort of venue - Denny's gets our business."" I've only eaten at an Applebee's on one other occasion in my life and thought that this would be at least a generically serviceable, if not pleasant, experience. If in a crunch, Denny's usually does ok.  I expected no less. But I was wrong. Dead wrong.  In these tough economic times they need to shape up. Do yourselves a favor and go to In-n-Out nearby if you ever make it to Gilroy (I know it was a bad move to go on Memorial Day in the first place... or even, just to go to Gilroy. Period.) And don't get me started about the food. UPDATE 5.30.08 Received a phone call from Applebee's corporate on the same day I sent the complaint online. I was impressed!!! I received profuse apologies and the person who read the complaint had spoken to the server involved (who told him a lie to cover her sorry ass - but no matter).  Very impressed with the people in corporate in this instance. Now if only the people who give the brand a face would treat their customers with professionalism and respect. One star for a responsive corporate manager, negative one star for Rebekah."
Sharon S.,"Gilroy, CA",0,23,,3.0,10/15/2013,I just want to say Elvis that works really made my day he has a very bubbly personality which made my day and I hope the management for this Applebees they have got a great worker and a hard worker Thank You Elvis
M T.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,199,,3.0,9/24/2013,"Stopped there for dinner after shopping in the Gilroy outlets.  Both my wife and I had a good meal.  I especially like my tilapia dish.  Waitress did a great job and was friendly and personable.  Prices were reasonable for what we ordered.  Restaurant has a bar area, and music was playing in the restaurant.  I found the music annoying -- guess I wanted a more quiet environment.  Eventually some music from my generation was playing, and I adjusted to the music noise."
Christine T.,"Pleasanton, CA",142,436,68,2.0,1/26/2009,"Wasn't horrible.  Wasn't great (but that's expected).  Best thing about this place is that it's kid friendly.  My sliders were lukewarm (cheese wasn't even melted) but the salad that came with it (can't remember what it was but it had shrimp in it) was pretty good.  Tried K's quesadilla burger and it was fine, if a bit messy (duh). I'd definitely go back if shopping and I had B to take care of.  It's a nice place for feeding/changing her and eating too."
Eric G.,"Berkeley, CA",40,414,44,2.0,11/21/2006,"Closer to the bottom of the food cahin. I have a rule that if a place gives me the shits, I can't give it more than 2 stars.  I think that's fair.  Food:  Been dragged here 3 times. First 2 visits gave me explosive geyser-shits that damn near lifted me off the toilet seat. 3rd time I didn't have a soda because I remembered their being a sort of chemical taste. I had a bottled drink. No squirts. I'm definitely calling the Food & Health Dept. I had an Oriental Chicken Salad. It was pretty well oriented.  They were nice enough to substitute grilled chicken instead of the fried chicken. I think form DS3 ""Standard Deviation Substitution Agreement"" had to be filled out by the cook though.  Greens were fresh. Chicken looked just like rubber!!! How do they manufacture their chicken. There was almost no grain or texture to it. Bizarre.  I heard that all of the grilled meat is pre-grillled in advance and shipped like that so they just heat it up. I can't prove that though.  Atmosphere: Every move and word the workers make follows strict guidelines in a 3-ring binder from corporate HQ. For example- Article ii of section B, sub paragraph 31 says that the greeter shall pre-greet each guest before the host greets them. Both greetings shall be perky and look each guest in the eye and treat them like your favorite uncle Bob.  Check this box if you have completed your mandatory greeting training with the Uncle Bob standard issue training dummy. (Oops. Change that to ""Training PERSON-UNIT""). ""Dummy"" is not a neighborly word.  They call themselves a NEIGHBORHOOD grill and bar. My family's neighborhood didn't have a Mikasa outlet store next to it. I guess it wasn't very neighborly.  Crapple-bees. Bring your kids! Let them throw their food all over the fuckin floor! It's a big party!! Woooooo!"
Michelle S.,"Salinas, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/17/2013,"I ordered the Garlic Sirloin and there was a long hair in my food, Yuck!  The red potatoes it came with tasted like rotten potatoes, I told the waiter and he replaced them with mashed potatoes that also tasted bad.   I told the waiter James who didn't seem to believe me,  He just rolled his eyes.  So if you want bad food, bad service go to Apple Bees Gilroy and ask for James."
Bill J.,"Gilroy, CA",5,67,,1.0,12/8/2006,"Nice balance of reviews on this place. I have to admit I'm a bit jealous of Joshua's review. Not too sure I have much to add there. However, I would like to register my general distaste for this ""genre"" of restaurant that gets built in twenty-five minutes and is made to look as if it had existed for seventy years in the same location. The walls covered with STUFF that's supposed to remind people of the days when the United States made a lot of it's own products. It pisses me off, because there are perfectly decent restaurants in this town that are owned by actual people that you run into in the grocery store and they are barely squeeking by while corporate suck-holes like APPLEBEE'S have people waiting in line every night. I don't take the punk rock approach with this. I don't think that everyone who comes here is a moron or that the company itself is a whore of Satan, I just wish we could do better. THIS JUST IN: I looked over the reviews for this place, and there isn't ONE that has more than three stars. Basically, people think this restaurant sucks.  WHY THEN IS THE DAMN THING PACKED TO THE CEILING WITH A WAITING LINE EVERY FRIGGIN'  NIGHT? The only possibility is that people are eating in BAD restaurants on purpose. Bummer."
Matt W.,"Imperial Beach, CA",23,80,1,1.0,3/7/2013,"bleh.... dirty silverware, greasy menus, dirty dishes, poor service server was more concerned with talking to coworkers then taking a food order. i shouldve known better it is applebees after all"
TJ T.,"Oceano, CA",21,44,10,1.0,2/6/2013,"This resturant should be closed after reading all of these Yelp reviews!  My Husband was on his way home Tuesday from the Veterans Hospital in San Francisco to San Luis Obispo on Tuesday a Friend went to pick him up they thought they would stop in for a bite to eat.  My Husband just had a laminectomy and he had a service his little service dog with him which had it's ADA tag on!  Needless to say this Applebees refuesed rather rudly to serve them and made them leave because of his service animal!  Yes this is against the law and yes this is not the end of this.  My Husband was injured in serving this country and this is how this place threats him the Americans with Disableds with also be notifed also!  This manager that told my Husband that this resturant was ""His house and that dog will not come into his house and he has to leave""  well mr. manager not all service dogs are big some are small and do other things like tell a person when they need there meds or when they will have sever spasams."
Steph C.,"Cupertino, CA",329,665,109,1.0,12/23/2009,Its been almost a week and they havent refunded my money.... jerks.
John Z.,"Hollister, CA",0,421,13,1.0,12/10/2007,"I have been here only once despite numerous offers to return. I hate Applebees. This one is no different. Bill's review hits the nail on the head. These corporate greed punk bitches try to make the place look like it's been around for 50 years but damn he's got a great point. Not ONE review more than 3 stars and this place is still packed to the brim every night. I gotta think it's out of town shoppers who don't want to look for a real restaurant or locals that think this food is good. Retarded locals.  God I hate this place.  Well the one time I have been here I nearly got black out drunk so that helped with the food being horrible and the crap service. Left a damn good tip though, don't ask me why."
Justin L.,"Daly City, CA",189,151,1,1.0,8/25/2010,"how do you messup bread for a turkey club?? i knew i would regret coming here, and i did. but what else am i going to eat before outletshopping? didn't want to eat fast food, but might as well have."
Karlita C.,"San Jose, CA",131,214,1,2.0,12/28/2006,"Back in the day, I used to love coming here.  In the past 7-8 years, this place seriously took a turn for the worst. The food (no matter what was ordered) was always gross.  I was lucky if they threw 10 beans on my order of nachos. The menu has also changed a LOT the past few years. The ONLY consistently good item on the menu was the Oriental Chicken Salad.  The best I have ever had. Tonight, I forced myself to come here only because I was given a gift card for Christmas. Again, I noticed the menu had changed (BIG Surprise). But this time, there seemed to be at least a few things i wouldn't mind trying. Tonight I had the new Tuscan Pesto Chicken Ciabatta. (I did substitute the chicken for turkey).  The Ciabatta bread was outstanding.  Perfectly soft and seasoned just right.  There was the perfect amount of pesto too.  This sandwich was SO good that I didn't even want to eat my french fries. (Anyone that knows me knows that i LOVE my french fries). I am happy that Applebees seems to be trying to make some sort of comeback. I just hope that they don't change the menu AGAIN and take this bad boy off. PS - I do have to say that I have always liked their Perfect Margaritas.  Not the best margarita I have had, but it's a nice alternative to ones typically served."
Jeff P.,"Melville, NY",182,841,193,2.0,8/26/2007,"After a long day of wine tasting and outlet shopping, we were famished and had no idea where to eat.  It was 8:30 and we knew we were too hungry to make it back to SF without dinner. So, we decided to go do some ""Eatin' Good in the Neighborhood"".  Well, if eatin' good means high fat foods & slow service then we succeeded!"
