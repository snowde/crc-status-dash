Sheila P.,"Tracy, CA",1513,752,1501,1.0,12/13/2009,"This place sealed the deal.  Applebees is on the ""will not ever again"" list.  Our original server (Jimmy) paid us close attention but after he switched with another waitress all went to hell.  Don't even bother ordering an alcoholic drink.  We both ordered one and both were basically a child's fruity drink.  I'd like to at least taste some alcohol so I know its not just some crappy punch.  The food was okay.  We received our appetizers at the same time as the rest of our meal.  Poor kitchen management."
Veerle H.,"San Jose, CA",8,30,9,2.0,2/20/2007,"2,5 stars - lunch on 2.19.07. The girl with the waiting list was totally rude (acted as if I didn't understand English, while she was the one that didn't know how to speak it properly).    The food was ok, but it took FOREVER to come out of the kitchen.  Most of us ordered soup and salad, so I have no clue at all why it was taking them that long to serve us."
Katelynn L.,"San Francisco, CA",74,406,889,2.0,3/21/2010,"Applebee's is definitely not one of my favorite chain restaurants...I'd much rather hit up a Chili's but there's not many places to eat when you shop at Gilroy so boyfriend and I ate there last weekend.  We got there a little before 4pm on Sunday and the place was pretty crowded.  Luckily, we didn't have to wait long for a table.  I ordered the Portabella Steak (one of the healthier items on the menu) and my boyfriend got the Southwest Jalepeno Burger.  Both dishes were decent but service was sub-par.  The food took a long time to come and our server never refilled our waters or anything.  I've been to Applebee's with much better service before so meh to this one."
Lan A.,"San Jose, CA",27,156,18,4.0,5/19/2010,I came here for dinner the other day with a girlfriend after our shopping excursion.  We were both starving so the food tasted great!  We had excellent customer service.  We ordered the 2 for $20 deal.  My friend had the steak & I had the chili lime chicken with rice & tortilla strips.  We also ordered some wings for appetizers & they were so good! I would definitely come back.
Erin O.,"Neighbors Southwest, Beaverton, OR",85,643,59,3.0,1/15/2007,"I don't get the bad rap Applebee's gets. It's a chain restaurant ala Bob's Big Boy, which is what I fondly grew up with. I always get decent or better service and decent or better food. Here are some items I've tried and liked: -Today for lunch I had a hamburger quesadilla that was quite tasty. It came with seasoned fries (I'm not a french fry fan) and I ate almost every one. -I consistently like their Santa Fe Chicken Salad (nice amount of chicken, greens,guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, and a bit of a kick) -Their loaded mashed potatoes are a heart-attack in the making, but god....they are good -I've had several steak and shrimp combos which were good -My daughter loves the mac and cheese that comes with garlic toast and applesauce Decent prices too. I don't get what's wrong with the place. It is what it is."
Amay V.,"Fresno, CA",31,64,,2.0,6/25/2009,"We were on our way home from San Franciso crabbing and decided to stop in Gilroy to do some shopping. We decided to eat here because it was convenient. To our surprise we waited a long time, the food took a long time, and our waiter only came to give us our tab. The food itself was ok. Nothing superb. The Apple Bees in my town seems to be better."
Sophia B.,"Gilroy, CA",0,1,,4.0,4/11/2012,"I thoroughly enjoy the atmosphere here, like any other restaurant in a small town with nothing to do or nowhere to go, If you want a more quiet meal, come during the day, if your looking for a hang out spot to drink, eat cheap appetizers, and meet up with half of Gilroy, then come at happy hour. People complain so much about bad service and food being half assed. Remember that some of these people come to work right after leaving their second job, to only go to another job after clocking out at apple bees. Ive had many good experiences here and for the most part see the staff doing their best while still enjoying their jobs. Its a hard business serving hundreds a day, and maybe thousands a week. Especially in this location i give them props. Might i add if you do happen to go in and you see monica at the bar, i urge you to swipe a seat at the bar. She should be named one of the top bartenders in Gilroy, not because drinks are fabulous seeing as it is a corporation, but her demeanor and personality make the experience worth it. Great job Monica and i will always look forward to seeing you. As for all the people that complain of the service... DONT go back, i know way too many people that go back even after they post ridiculously mean things on here. So to everyone in the food industry. Hats off to you all."
Shakeel A.,"San Jose, CA",2,64,2,1.0,1/2/2011,"Went in today at around 2:00 pm and had horrendous service! We placed a fairly simple order. We wanted an appetizer and two sizzling steak and cheese entrees(not the 2 for 20 deal) and wanted our steaks well done. After our orders were taken, about 15-20 minutes our steaks come out. I asked about our appetizer and she said she forgot and was going to place the order for it now. I told her forget it because if she brings it out after we have our entrees it does not remain an ""appitizer"", mistakes happen. I guess it was also my fault also, we should have realized she did not write down our order from the beginning. We cut into our steaks and they were rare. So we had to wait for 5 minutes until we flagged down someone and asked if we could see our waiter. She finally arrived and we told her our steaks were rare, not medium otherwise we would have managed. She took our steaks and diappeared. 15 minutes pass, then 20, then 30 finally after 40 minutes we again had to flag her down and asked about our steaks. After our steaks were returned she came to us saying that she made a request for the steaks to be remade(you could not just grill the same steaks with all the cheese on it) and it was taking longer because our orders were given to someone else. OUR ORDERS WERE given to another table and told me it will take them about 10-15 minutes more for our orders!!!!! She sort of smiled as she told us this and left. At this moment we were more than an hour and had had enough. We asked someone else to get the manager. The manager comes out 5 minutes later with two sizzling steaks!!!!!! I think they were someone elses order because one had fries with it instead of the usual mash potatoes. The manager put the food in front of us and told us that it took long because they wanted to make sure our food was properly prepared. I told him that about 5 minutes ago we were told our food was given to another table and that it took them almost an hour to cook it a second time around? Anyways with the manager standing we cut into our steaks and guess what...... rare as rare could be.... not medium.... we had had enough."
Jeff S.,"Gig Harbor, WA",0,77,29,2.0,7/3/2011,"What happened? Okay, it's a chain restaurant, but lunch was not what it was supposed to be - literally. We were interested in trying some new things and have had success with the WW Points Plus items. He ordered the Paradise Salad and I ordered the Spicy Pineapple Glazed Shrimp. My was very good with a good amount of spiciness to it (they'll probably get complaints about that). But the Paradise Salad was anything but. It was supposed to be grilled chicken on a bed of greens - okay it was grilled chicken but was on a bed of raw cabbage. Then the menu calls for Mandarin oranges, apples, pineapple and pico de gallo. The one thing my husband was looking forward to was the pineapple. So he balked at the cabbage (I would have also), but then there wasn't a single piece of pineapple on the plate. We had a change in servers (at 12:00 Noon?) and didn't have an offer of refills on drinks or a ""How's the meal?"" after it was dropped off by a mystery food runner from the kitchen. So when the bill came, we told the waiter. The manager stopped by (and I don't think it was because the waiter told him) and asked how the meal was. We explained and he actually made the meal sound worse than it is -- like they dip a measuring cup into some big can of fruit mixture to toss with the salad. He also thought the orange/apple/pineapple mixture WAS the pico de gallo. They took it off the bill but we'll be looking for someplace new next time we go to the outlet malls. I also noticed that the ratings for the restaurant have either had a nosedive this year or because of the food and/or service, more people are adding reviews about their dissatisfaction. Too bad, because we used to go here whenever we were there."
scott r.,"Gilroy, CA",3,33,9,1.0,3/5/2012,"i took my wife and kids there for a dinner server was a smart ass said things under his breath sorry i heard him,the burger i was served was nasty and soggy and had some gross sauce's wife ordered steak with seasoned shrimp the stake was overcooked and the sauce was ice cold just poured all over tithe service sucked and so did the food sorry about that apple b maybe thats why your not apple a s haha."
IM B.,"Burlingame, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/8/2011,"Pack your lunch when you shop outlets! These guys are terrible, every other bad review is very accurate! I was too hungry to yelp it before I went there this past weekend, our first server was so skinny and when we tried the food I realized why; the food is awful! Moved to another waiters section, and he forgot my credit card for the longest time! I hate these kinds of restaurants because it's an alcoholics innovation; that means someone with absolutely no taste buds decided to get in the food business once upon a time- don't expect good food, don't expect service! If you're an alcoholic, have another drink it will be over soon, but If you're sober and are there to do some bargain shopping, pack your lunch it's cheaper and drama-free!"
DaYeen M.,"Livermore, CA",12,61,7,2.0,12/4/2008,"food is good. we ordered the sirloin steak, mashed potatoes and spicy (and a bit sour) buffalo wings for appetizers and also added chocolate mouse for dessert and boy we were stuffed.  my only complaint is that the staff that are making sure everybody gets seated aren't doing their job.  We went there on a tuesday but still it took us around 30 mins to get a seat. Unfortunately the girl who was taking notes on how many needs to be seated isn't doing her job. When we realized that all of those people before us got seated already we came up to her and asked if maybe she forgot to put our names in the list. And we were right, she didn't write it down.  well, she saw us sitting there for the longest time and didn't even bother to double check.   all in all. poor service. good food."
K J.,"Hollister, CA",0,32,,1.0,4/11/2010,I got food poisoning from this place...I threw up 4 times the next day...gross.
Tamara J.,"Morgan Hill, CA",4,36,1,5.0,4/8/2012,"I'll admit, we've been to this Applebees before and it was never anything special- just mediocre food and service.  However, our recent visit was enough to make us look forward to returning again soon.  This review is based on the fact that good service goes a long, long way.  My husband and I sat at the bar for lunch and drinks after a morning of shopping at the outlets.  One of the bartenders, Monica, took care of our food and drinks.  Monica has one of those special personalities that kept the people there at the bar ordering more appetizers, food and drinks than they probably would have otherwise.  She gave attention to each customer with a big, bright smile and friendly service.  My husband had the appetizer sampler and I had the soup (delicious!!!).  We hardly had any wait at all for our food even though the place was packed for lunch.  Our drinks were top notch (I had the skinny mojito- Monica even checked to see that I was enjoying it!).  I ordered a second juts because she was so great.  If you go for happy hour (great deals on certain drinks and half off most appetizers!), you should look for Monica.  She will make it worth the stop!  She is someone who obviously enjoys her job and does it well.  Thanks, Monica!"
Brian A.,"San Bruno, CA",136,220,,1.0,5/31/2008,"When we go to the outlets there aren't many food options (either that or we are just too damn lazy to actually search for alternatives).  If it was up to me we'd go to In N Out every time, but sometimes Carla isn't in the mood for a hamburger... so when that's the case we go to this dump.  Applebee's is the epitome of everything that is wrong with chain restaurants.  The food sucks and there I agree with what John P. said: these bastards try to make it seem like this joint is a big part of the Gilroy community.  Bitch please!"
Kris L.,"San Francisco, CA",198,805,261,3.0,8/21/2006,"Came here yesterday with a (non-yelper) friend for a quick bite to eat before we started our outlet shopping.  We split an appetizer of fried dill pickle slices over tortilla chips with ranch dipping sauce.  Not bad.  I'd never thought of frying pickles, but I like pickles and I like fried food so we had to try it.  We followed with a split entree of the small basket of riblets - which were good and not too messy.  And then ended by sharing a Dreamsicle Cake.  It tasted a lot like those creamsicle popsicles I used to eat when I was a kid.  Applebee's.  Not a bad place to go when there isn't much else to eat in the area."
Ron D.,"Dededo, Guam",483,1135,37,1.0,10/5/2008,"Had no choice but to grab a bite to eat here, because Gilroy Shopping Outlet still does not have a foodcourt for customers to eat!  We were there during the weekend, so it was filled with weekend customers.  Although the food arrived in a timely manner, all I can say was that it was very salty!  I guess that was to make up for the fact that most of the time we've eaten at Applebee's worlwide, e.g., Times Square NYC & Niagara Falls Canada, the food was always bland and not that great.  One would expect better tasting food from them, considering they're always advertising!"
Bryce K.,"Sacramento, CA",1,145,,3.0,8/29/2009,"i ate here during the 2 for $20 special. food taste = 3.5 price / value = 4 service = 3.5* environment = 4 i guess applebee's is much better when they have a special going.  food tasted good.  the amount they provided was satisfying. * - service was a tough one to rate.  our first waiter was outstanding.  very professional, polite, helpful, and patient.  i would have rated him a 4.5 or 5.  unfortunately, he needed to go on a break or something and the girl they replaced him with was a little 'too' helpful.  almost took away some dishes i wasn't finished with.  brought the check quickly and checked on it twice before i actually put my cc in it.  basically, i felt like she was trying to run me out of there before the dinner crowd arrived. despite that, i thought the chili's special was a bit better, so i can't give this a 4, but this is a very high 3."
Marijke D.,"Schoten, Belgium",3,134,,2.0,2/20/2007,"Our first experience with this chain restaurant was not a very good one (unfortunately).  We had to wait 20 minutes for our table (not bad considering the fact that it was a holiday and the outlet was bustling with hungry people).  We ordered and then we had to wait forever before our food came out of the kitchen (we ordered soup and salads so I don't understand how this can take so long).  Service was not friendly, it was nonchalant at best.  The quality of food was better than expected and the portions were not huge, but of a good size."
