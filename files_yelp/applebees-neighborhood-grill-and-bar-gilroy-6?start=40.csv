Robert D.,"Gilroy, CA",75,36,24,1.0,2/1/2017,"Was here 2 days ago, I must say, mgmt not paying attention to customer service, got my order wrong, food  was fair, and very small portions. I should of spike to mgmt."
Lia S.,"Salinas, CA",105,48,157,1.0,6/20/2016,"This place is ridiculous. The hostess is a joke. I think her name is Lauren. She keeps telling everyone the same wait times and she looks so lost. We watched her count menus over and over again. She could have helped clear tables to expedite the wait time.  There's no busboy. The place cleared out after the game and the tables were just dirty. No one cleaned the tables. The hostess told us to sit at a table that still had dirty dishes and wait for a server to clear the table. Who does that?!?  The food is the same if you went to any other Applebee's. Half the food is cold by the time you get it because they wait for everyone's plate to be ready. The portions here are small for what you pay. But the service is a joke today here. Our server is quite nice (I think his name is Justin) , but we've seen one walking so slow and not caring about the customers. It's either they're short staffed or the staff doesn't care at all. The manager is just walking around and laughing with a few guests.  Go somewhere else to eat than here."
CamiAnn B.,"Fresno, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/2/2017,"This place is crap. Don't eat here, service sucks, food is cold and I had to pour my own drinks that wasn't in the right cup. Wish we would've went to the McDonald's for the garlic fries and mind you I hate McDonald's. Wish I could put no stars! Oooohhh by the way tables will stay dirty for a long time busier siting down. Andddd corporate had been here training I don't understand how this place is still crap when their here!"
Denise C.,"San Francisco, CA",4,25,11,1.0,1/14/2017,"Didn't expect much from this place. Not a big fan of American fast food diners either, but holy the service was terrible! Came in with my Asian family and was treated by a white waitress who was mean to us from the moment we sat down. She was impatient with my family even when I spoke decent  English to her. Had a mean and bitc** face on the whole time. The food wasn't that good (expected). When the salad came, it was mostly browned and going bad. I asked her while pointing at the salad why it is like this, she told me that's how the salad is today. But the thing was the table next to us had perfectly fine salad. Ended up switching the salad thankfully . You know where you wont be seeing me again!"
Andy R.,"Nipomo, CA",22,271,26,2.0,10/24/2015,On our way to Santa Rosa we stopped off for lunch. We ordered off the 3 appetizer items for $14.  1) overlooked with the only moisture from the sickeningly sweet BBQ sauce: 2) potstickers with the wrappers tough and dry; 3). Chicken quesadilla- acceptable with the green tomatillos sauce.  We will wait another ten years before going back.
Staci L.,"Gilroy, CA",0,7,,4.0,9/1/2017,The wait was kind of long. So I decided to sit at the bar. I sat for a little bit and then the bartender took my drink order. Shortly later he took my food order. My drink that he recommended was good. My food arrived and looked good. About a1/4 of the way thru my meal I realized my cheeseburger was not correct. The bartender and manager made it right.
Arthur F.,"Seaside, CA",32,1,,1.0,4/22/2017,I walked in there today had a dilemma with the bill that needed the managers assistant's Habib. Thanks to him my whole experience at Applebee's was ruined whoever is in charge of this establishment should strongly consider a replacement. He blew way out of proportion a simple problem that had a simple solution.
Sally A.,"Fresno, CA",5,43,16,1.0,5/15/2016,"Caution!!!!!! 1. Plates were wet, dirty, and there was food stuck on the plates. Apparently the plates aren't washed  properly they're just dipped in water  2. Salad had the core of the lettuce head (the inedible portion) in the salad and it was rotted 3. The steak was cold and after reordering the second steak still came out cold  4. Management is terrible   GO ANYWHERE ELSE!!!!!"
Shelley P.,"Hollister, CA",38,4,,1.0,1/12/2017,"Placed online order for a second time with this Applebees and they screwed up again. I left Hollister and placed online order for pick up asap. Get there 20 minutes later and order hasn't been started. Manager 1 says sorry we will make right now. Making excuses of the previous nights power outage.  Manager 2 says it's not supposed to be ready until 11:27, and I say yes it's 11:34. Really should have been reimbursed or compensated somehow for the troubles and the fact that they made me 1/2 hour late to work.  Guess you just can't online order from them and get an order done right or without hassle."
Nico H.,"San Mateo, CA",67,6,2,1.0,1/5/2017,"I forgot my small pouch here before and when I called, the lady who answered said that it was still there, when I came back (drove atleast an hour) and told the host about my missing item, he gave me a big bag. I said tht is not mine. He just said ohh sorry. There's no more items. (I had a ring inside from my sister)"
Christine T.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,,1.0,3/30/2017,"Love Applebee's just not this location. Service is horrible, not friendly and slow! Will not go back."
Hsin-Fu C.,"San Jose, CA",28,2,,5.0,7/27/2016,"My girlfriend was order a mashed sweet potato, but she doesn't like, the lady help us to change a regular mashed potato instead without any hesitate. Well service and helps, highly recommended!"
Rashmi K.,"San Jose, CA",1,67,1,1.0,12/11/2016,"Extremely poor service. We waited an hour and when the food finally came out, the entire order was completely wrong."
Wade W.,"Hollister, CA",0,5,2,1.0,6/10/2016,I ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken.  Long story-short. Food was cold. I sent it back. So what does the idiot cook in the back do??  Reheated and sent back chicken and shrimp jerky.  I wished I could post the pic. I found a few of the original shrimp that looked like the smoked ones you buy in the bag at the Hispanic Grocery stores. It just pissed me off that someone would do that. And the manager is the one that reserved it.
Anthony M.,"Gilroy, CA",19,10,,3.0,3/8/2017,Have had good and bad experiences here. My advice just have some appetizers and drinks. Food is good but when they get busy the customer service goes way down which you expect but it can get to extreme levels. I once had bugs in 3 drinks and a piece of glass stuck in my hand from the booth.
Maureen S.,"Hollister, CA",3,75,89,4.0,1/9/2017,"What a wonderful young lady working behind the bar at this Applebee's, her name is Jane. She is a fantastic server and barkeep always with a smile, always with recommendations. my husband and I were in for lunch recently and ordered two different lunch specials. Mine came in was in  edible. Jane was right there and hurried to get another order in for me for my lunch so that I could eat with my husband. She was so gracious, and had my lunch taken off of the bill. This is the third we have eaten lunch at the bar, because she is so pleasant. Applebee's is lucky to have her!"
Carlos R.,"Los Banos, CA",35,4,2,5.0,10/13/2016,"I don't know what the fuss is about with the bad reviews but I'm here right now and just ate the shrimp n steak parm and it was AMAZING! I don't remember the last time I left any restaurant and a steak blew my mind.. money well spent Happy birthday to my wife and my hats off to Chef Ramon, that guy really knows his way around his kitchen. Thank you Applebees for a perfect ending to my wife's birthday. Until next time Applebees. I'll be back on a Thursday for sure. And service and portions were perfect."
Miranda B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",31,109,25,2.0,8/2/2015,"Haven't been to an Applebee's in ages but this is the worst service I've gotten at an AMERICAN restaurant. We stopped here on our way back home to Southern California from San Francisco. Wish we hadn't.  Food was ok (maybe we felt it was fine because we were starving). Service was super slow, it took our appetizer 20 min to come out and right after it did they came out with the entrees. My daughter spilled lemonade on the floor and table and we sat there through our meal with ice on the ground. No one bothered to clean it. I had to ask for a rag to clean the lemonade myself. Not very clean and the place is ran terribly. We saw people all around us having to wait forever for their food.  I'm giving two stars instead of one only because towards the end the waiter was cordial and attentive.  You guys really need to step up your game and change the management ."
Lara F.,"Los Gatos, CA",154,304,102,5.0,4/15/2016,"Look...it's Applebee's. It's a chain. You're not going to get French Laundry food here.  All the meals we have gotten were well prepared at the right temperature served promptly. (ok, once in ten years, we had an underdone steak and they handled it by cooking longer and comped us the steak).  Glasses are refilled quickly.  We love sitting at the bar when we're taking a break from shopping at the outlets. We're always treated like we're important. The bathrooms are clean. It's a good place for us."
Jackie S.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,1.0,7/3/2017,Two out of four of our plates came out cold. My mom ordered a well done cheeseburger and it came out cold and medium. Our waiter was also absent for most of our meal and didn't check on us. We had to flag down the manager and tell him about our cold meal.
