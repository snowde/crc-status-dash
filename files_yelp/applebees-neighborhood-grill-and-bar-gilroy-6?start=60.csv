Harry G.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,50,,5.0,5/16/2017,"Best Onion soup ever, food is always delicious, we have been to a lot of Applebys restaurants always great. Service is very good."
Nancy B.,"Gilroy, CA",0,13,9,1.0,6/30/2017,"The MOST disgusting food I have ever experienced at an Applebees !! What the hell is going on at this last cation !? We already have shitty choices for restaurants here in Gilroy and to have such disgusting ill prepared food here tonight was extremely disappointing !! Our server did the best she could considering they were most likely short staffed because she didn't get around to clearing our apps very well. The food... omg the food.. SHAME on the complacent , lazy chefs in the kitchen ! My daughters Mac n cheese looked like a soy sauce soup with over cooked floating corkscrew pasta! We sent that back .. it was gross tasting and looking ! My son in law ordered a burger he was so hungry so he starting biting into the burger.. if we had a vet around the probably could have resuscitated the cow back to life!! It was a floppy patty of ground beef that looked like it had been BOILED for 5 mins and put on an old bun ! Simply disgusting and very, very dangerous !! Serving meat so raw, the health department will be notified as well . We will never step foot into that establishment again!! The manager came over was apologetic etc took off the bill however, didn't offer even a dessert and it was my mom's bday ! We told our server who did offer dessert that we didn't want anything but it was very weird that she asked .. doesn't the server automatically bring something out for the birthday person ? In any event , this is a huuuge warning that this place has gone down , down , down !! Absolutely disgusting and nauseating even imagining the way the food looked and tasted !!"
Marie P.,"San Francisco, CA",53,714,32,4.0,1/17/2015,"If you are in this area don't forget there is Applebee's! My fam could not remember the last time that we dined here, so it was like ""our first time"". Our server Amanda was the sweetest. I believe it was her first day serving customers she did an excellent job.  The chain Applebee's likes to decorate will local photos and community pics..I love it!Gives you that hometown feel. You can watch TV here which is excellent for the husbands and boyfriends that don't want to miss their SPORTS.  Everything about our meal from the service, food and smiles was great. Management even came around and checked to see how we were doing. They have menu specials every now and then too."
Leticia S.,"Hollister, CA",29,60,80,2.0,12/21/2014,"Fast & friendly service in the Carside To Go. I parked in the spot designated for this service & within a few seconds of parking I was greeted by a very pleasant gentlemen who greeted me by my name at my driver window. It was nice to know that even though the restaurant was packed the Carside To Go was not lacking customer service. Thank you for the great experience! I am a little confused as to why my salad though had very little pieces of lettuce & a lot of cabage. This looked like a half or even a quarter salad, I ordered a regular Thai Shrimp salad for $11.99 honestly it was missing more lettuce I will upload picture & you tell me if its worth $11.99  I think that's why I got an extra soup in my bag, one thing I ask a restaurant is if you don't have all the ingredients for what you have on the menu please don't sell it. I provided my phone number on the pick up form someone could have called me:( just a bit disappointed with the food quantity & the office..doesn't Tomato basil soup was really good"
A C.,"Salinas, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/21/2017,"If there was an option for no stars I would give it. Darius called himself confronting his customer after a complaint to the manager about him. He couldn't tell me options in the menu, told me I ordered something I didn't then tried to give it to me when it was for the  a table next to us.  We had a waitress put her hand and shirt in our food before trying to serve it to us. We did get a comp of $4.13 to our bill which is a joke! I would of rather just had my waiter more respectful and given better customer service."
Carlo S.,"Moraga, CA",11,20,1,2.0,8/10/2016,"Food is sub standard, service nothing special. Maybe it was my unlucky day as I have been to better Applebee's. Will try again."
Steve T.,"Pleasanton, CA",623,1370,379,3.0,10/8/2015,The fish and chips were too salty for me and were only okay.  My French onion soup was good.  Service is great.   Typical Applebys restaurant.
Minnie W.,"Albany, OR",194,74,71,1.0,7/2/2016,this place is very sloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo­oooooooooow! we ordered 2 things and it took 30min to get it done. and my steak is over cooked. :(
Douglas L.,"Pasadena, CA",1101,242,300,5.0,3/11/2015,"I stopped by for a quick lunch to re-energize after a long drive up from Los Angeles.  Got the Thai shrimp salad and it went down like butter!  Was surprised cause it is Appleby's but it was legit.   The salad had a good number of shrimps, unlike some places that put like three just to call the salad that.  My only quip about the salad was that I wish they had more salad.  It would have rounded it out better. The taste and combo was good.  Was pissed when I got in cause I need to take a shit and I was waiting for the waiter to come so I could place my order and go drop my bomb but he took forever so I had to tell the hostess.  But the guy made up for it cause my order came out fast and I got a good number of shrimps.  Plenty of parking and it is close to the outlets."
Maureen H.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,8,,2.0,10/26/2016,Took my two Grandchildren to dinner on a Tuesday and found out it  was kids night! Apparently none of the staff is aware of their written deal on the kids menu. I questioned 2 waitresses about pricing and each came up with a different story as to why the price on the menu was not reflected on my bill! The food was good but service and general knowledge of their menu was poor.
Bobbie M.,"Gilroy, CA",156,102,21,2.0,10/23/2015,It stinks in there... Like feet or something. The food is not very good. But it's Applebee's what do you expect? You get what you pay for. If you're trying to be cheap then you obviously won't get great food at this type of restaurant. Service is great. The servers work hard for their money.
Katie A.,"San Jose, CA",87,30,1,2.0,9/13/2016,Came here late one evening and wanted to get a quick bite. The upside is it was open late the down side is the food wasn't very good at all. I had the Mac n cheese with chicken tenders and the Mac n cheese tastes like it had no cheese sauce and the chicken was dry and hard like it had been sitting out all day. The steak stir fry needed more flavor. The service was just ok. Seemed like the servers were a little too lax. Some were sitting in the booths gossiping and turning the lights off and said they were on break. Some where yelling across the place at each other. I would not go back. Other locations are much better .
Samuel N.,"San Jose, CA",0,13,,1.0,12/27/2015,"Ordered online with their ""Carside to Go"" Service. Spent 20 minutes waiting in the parking lot for them to come out. They never came out. I then went inside to the cash register counter where 3 servers were standing there talking. One of them with the name tag Ariana was on her iPhone and talking. Another gentleman was standing there with his kid and told me had been there for 10 minutes and no one had even said hello to him. Meanwhile, these three servers were laughing and joking and completely ignoring us. Eventually, I flagged down a server and asked about my order. He stopped the manager, a large man with glasses with his shirt untucked, who said no one was on ""Carside to Go"" duty. They then went to get my food. While they did, Ariana still stood there at the register but only flirting with other servers as they walked by. The gentleman behind me was very bothered as well and still had not been helped when I left with my very cold food. Tldr; HORRIBLE service."
Rich H.,"Rainier, OR",0,57,,5.0,4/6/2016,"FYI: We entered at noon and were out by 1pm. Got seated right away. Ordered the 2 for $20 special and folks it was great. Maybe we got lucky but we loved it! We will be back but not if we had to wait for 1/2 an hour for a table. Our time is too valuable. Here's the skinny. David our server was cheery! Took our order promptly. He was a pleasure to talk too and was very interested in making our visit a special one. He agreed that the 2/ 20 selections were excellent and he wasn't kidding. The Chicken Wing appetizer was great. The Bourbon Chicken with Shrimp was one of the best meals we have ever had, especially for the price! The sizzling platter kept our food warm to the last bite! What a great idea and perfectly executed. Our compliments to the chef. Illana the hostess was great! I also met Habib the manager and praised him on the excellent dining experience we had!"
Chris V.,"Gilroy, CA",0,5,,2.0,3/31/2017,"Dam sucks trying to eat at the bar and you have all these nats flying around!! Told manager and says ya I know been like this for weeks! SMH can't enjoy my food. I'll give you a free beer ! ? More like comp my food!!!  The Bartenders where cool and knew bout the problem, the manager was like I. Don't care I can't give everyone free food!  But nats everywhere!  They've called I guess eco to come clean 3 times too !"
Alilu M.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,7,3,1.0,2/25/2016,"Well so I arrived with my kids for lunch, I order a CHICKEN FAJITA ROLL, expecting something delicious, I have no idea were was the chicken maybe run way, I told the lady and she said yes there no chicken there, she took my plate and came back telling me she checked the roll and the chicken was really really chopped, OMG are you kidding me!!!!!"
Cristina C.,"Salinas, CA",0,12,,1.0,2/19/2017,Worse Applebee's restaurant I've been too. Our food took a very long time to get served. Other guests who have arrived after us got there food b fore us. Never good back.
Donna M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,6,,1.0,3/13/2017,"Worst,food ever, first it is such a odd menu,really hard to pick anything the menu just makes no sense. Just ordered onion soup and small ceaser salad both were gross, tasted like Lipton package soup yuk salad was old lettuce, music was so loud was killing our ears, and the waitress had attitude because took so long to order, what can you expect with such a dismal menu save your money in and out burger is around the corner"
Elena N.,"San Francisco, CA",1406,2423,10560,2.0,6/29/2014,"Was shopping at the Gilroy outlets a couple months ago. It was nearing the late afternoon and we hadn't eaten all day, so we decided to have lunner (late lunch +early dinner = lunner?!) at Applebee's. We didn't have to wait long and were seated quickly. We ordered: Perfect patron margarita: patron silver 100% agave tequila and patron citronge with perfect margarita mix ($9.75) - Came with a shaker of the extra margarita. A huge serving but very weak. There wasn't much alcohol in it. House salad (no croutons) with ranch ($3.25) - Average house salad with mixed greens, tomatoes and cheese. The greens were crisp and fresh. I enjoyed the salad.  9oz house sirloin: classic steakhouse cut, served with seasonal vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes ($15.49) - This was the roommate's dish. It looked fine, but kind of bland. He seemed to enjoy it as long as he had some A1. Appetizer sampler: Mozzarella sticks, Spinach & artichoke dip, Cheese quesadilla grande, Boneless buffalo wings ($12.99) - I'm a variety kind of girl so I thought this would be good for me. Unfortunately the Mozzarella sticks weren't hot and gooey and the Spanish & artichoke dip needed seasoning. I had to add salt to it to eat it. The Boneless buffalo wings were okay when dipped in ranch. And the Cheese quesadilla grande tasted fine with the salsa.  Butter pecan blondie: baked with nuts, topped with ice cream and glazed pecans covered with a rich, cream cheese sauce ($5.49) - Apparently the roommate orders this every time he goes to Applebee's. I found it way too sweet, but he loved it! So I basically had an average food experience for an Applebee's. Subtracting a star due to our odd server. When we were ready to order, it took a while to flag him down since initially he came by too early. Throughout service he seemed to forget to bring us things. When we were done, we needed boxes and asked him for some. We boxed up our own food and then realized he didn't bring a container for the Spinach & artichoke dip. I asked for a soup container but he said he could bring the plate to the back and box it up himself. He was a little insistent so I said fine. Some time passes and he comes back saying someone dropped the plate and we're making us a new one to go. I appreciate the gesture and it was the right thing to do, but I totally could have boxed up the food myself! Plus the server made it seemed like they were doing us a favor and we lucked out! Maybe he was new to serving, but it was a really odd dining experience."
Carol B.,"Morgan Hill, CA",63,11,,5.0,6/3/2016,Drinks made by Jimmy and Cristi at the bar are a hit. They are friendly and make dining at the bar a fabulous experience. Will definitely come back to have drinks.
