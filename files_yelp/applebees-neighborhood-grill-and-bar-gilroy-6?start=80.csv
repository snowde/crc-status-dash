A A.,"Fresno, CA",0,2,,2.0,8/9/2016,"My wife and I stopped in for a quick late lunch. Restaurant was not busy at all. When we entered there were three customers waiting to be seated. They took our names down and ask us to sit. I wasted if there was a wait time as I looked over the restaurant and was told yes. About 3 minutes later the 3 customer that were waiting got seated. While waiting Another couple walked in to be seated quickly and were told they could try the bar. They walked to the bar and then walked out.  We waited another couple of minutes and then were seated at a table that had been empty the entire time! The Hostess never smiled the entire time. I don't know why they want you to wait before getting seated. If they were busy I would understand, this was ridiculous! Won't visit that place again! Hostess needs customer training!"
Rimi K.,"San Francisco, CA",523,430,422,3.0,10/26/2014,"*OK food, great service, conveniently located right by the Gilroy outlets* Get your wings here!  And they're pretty good!  Also available are dessert shots.  Gone are the days we're required to purchase full desserts, leaving most in left over ruins!   Recommend if you're at the outlets and feel like something more than in and out."
Jessica S.,"Millbrae, CA",189,88,72,4.0,6/12/2016,"If you're surprised that an Applebee's is receiving a 4-star rating, rest assured - you're not alone. I sit here in disbelief myself as I write this. This place is clean, the service was great (even at the bar), and the food was actually pretty good. The onion rings were super doughy, but that's really my only complaint. Not a bad experience at all."
Miguel G.,"Hollister, CA",544,5,53,5.0,6/19/2016,"our server Gage went above and beyond. My wife ordered a plate unaware the 4 cheese mac had beacon (she is allergic) to it. Gage quickly took action in correcting the issue and ordered something else for her. Gage made sure my wife's plate was to her liking and approval. Gage was very helpful and attentive not just to us but to his other guest as well, we saw him helping the other tables and recommending great dishes and drinks. A very Well recommendation for Gage and the Restaurants Manager ***** Five stars all the way. We will continue to visit Gilroy's Ca, Applebees more. Thank you."
Marky Mark F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",9,49,3,1.0,7/26/2015,The food here is disgusting. I ordered a chicken dish that had some chemical taste. So I sent it back and ordered a chicken quesadilla. How could that be bad? Where do I begin? Easily the most disgusting food of any chain. But busy for whatever reason. I guess the folks out here don't know better.
Jenna G.,"San Jose, CA",0,14,1,5.0,3/5/2016,"They call you and i quote ""ratchet ass bitches"" and ""dicks"" . Two women who normally do not accept that kind of language from a stranger let alone restaurant staff ..but i applaud you and your quick wit+service. You made us laugh and pour nice and heavy drinks. Chevy's service/staff does not compete. ;)"
Tracey P.,"Gilroy, CA",378,246,1161,2.0,3/6/2016,"Used to come here and play beer pong, bingo, and enjoy appetizers. Cool new tactics for customers. Dunno if they still have it but the food was hit and miss, some good sum blah. Clam chowder is bland and steaks are under cooked. Great salads tho."
Melissa V.,"San Jose, CA",3,5,1,1.0,6/3/2016,Why am I swatting flies while waiting for my drink that came in a dirty glass.. You can smell the bathroom from across the restaurant.. The booth still had someone's chicken tender crumbs everywhere and the table had a layer of stickiness that probably needs to be sanded off its so thick..
Ra L.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/4/2016,"Saturday around 12:30pm. Service extremely rude. Sat at the bar tables, tried to get someone to pay attention to us for 15 minutes. Tried everything. Pressed the call server button, waved our hands, said ""hello"" loudly when they were 3 ft away.. Of the 6 waiters who passed by, 1 server who was older with long grey ponytail made eye contact twice and walked by as if we weren't there. We got up and left.  Menu (which I had to walk up and pick up myself) also seems to have shrunk considerably and prices jacked up. Don't see the point of ever going to an Applebee's again."
Marco C.,"Gilroy, CA",9,41,91,4.0,9/16/2015,"Haven't been here in years..not because I live out of the country, but last time food sucked. Today almost was my last time because of the long wait to be served. After we order everything else turn around for the better..food was awesome(4 cheese Mac bacon chicken tenders in Alfredo). Kids loved the fires..my wife had the oriental chicken two . Look out chilis lol."
Colleen R.,"Austin, TX",1,16,,1.0,6/28/2016,"From poor service to an ignorant lying manager, my our experience at this franchise location is something we will remember as a reason never to go to Applebees anywhere again. Get on your phone and look up and go to any of the multiple local joints in town if you expect decent service and to get what you ordered."
Leslie Y.,"San Francisco, CA",245,650,585,4.0,5/31/2014,"We were starving by the time we walked half of the Outlet stores, so we ended up coming back to the part where Applebee's stood..... When we walked in, the young lady tells us 7 minutes til happy hour...... We got tons of food, ordered bourbon steak, not worth it.....these types of restaurant just don't know how to cook a steak..... Fettuccine and penne dishes were yummy, my friends liked them a lot...... The service was really good, the young man always came by to make sure things were great and refilled our liquids as needed.... spinach and artichoke dip....we had 2 of them, one after the other, imagine that...."
Rita G.,"Salinas, CA",0,48,1,1.0,8/4/2015,"Dirty table top, waitress seating us put menu on top of mess! We ordered separate basket of fries and had to ask for it twice! Guacamole burger greasy! Had to wait while those who arrived afterward were served!  We ALWAYS get EXCELLENT service at Applebee's in Salinas. Not Here! Need to clean up their act.  OH! There was one waitress who brought French fries who was cheerful and gave us a feeling of welcome. (Older lady with sandy hair. I stopped to tell her she was great while she was taking another's order on the way out!)"
Alfred G.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/20/2016,"Me and my family went to the gilroy  outlets and so naturally after some hours of shopping and walking around you get tired and hungry. So we went to this applebees and everything was going well until.... we were served the appetizer we ordered after 40 minutes. Other people who came in after us got their orders really fast and it went on - people sitting down having their orders in no time. I kept buzzing the server but all he could say was "" sorry we're on it"" our orders wasnt even that many to begin with. We gave it a chance but when we were almost an hour sitting there with just the appetizer he served after 40 minutes, it was time to go. The worst service i have ever encountered i dont know if it is a normal thing here in applebees, but after 1 hour of waiting they didnt really care or did anything about wasting our time just sorry and it was not good enough. If i could give negative stars i'd give them. Just a heads up for people going to this applebees for the first time DONT GO TO THIS APPLEBEES you will waste your time and you wont get your order."
Michael N.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,35,4,1.0,11/13/2016,"The sanitation needs to improve at this place, the bathroom is disgusting & to think that's where the employees wash their hands to cook, and prepare tables for customers. The tables are sticky & a wet rag wiped over the table is not cleaning that's not okay.. Also wait time on food has rapidly increased, just to have your order served nice and cold by the time it gets to you. Servers are forgetful it's horrible. Please upgrade the quality in your staff. This is hard working money we pay to expect a great visit at this restraunt."
Hen A.,"San Mateo, CA",3007,3154,4803,2.0,12/15/2014,"inside gilroy outlets...southeastern block...already parked and not wanting to drive out...completely full with long wait, but taking the self-seating bar stool...pint of blue moon $5...typical burgers, ribs, salads, sandwiches and more...order of the thai shrimp salad and cross ribs in traditional sweet bbq sauce...ribs having a very dried-out crust masked in sticky sweet bbq sauce mess...extremely sauced heavy and thick....fries were decent...thai shrimp salad was better...very light subtle dressing and decent portion...applebee's is packed on the weekends, wait for a table can be long, service is extremely slow and ribs are bad....burgers look far better and bigger..."
Jana A.,"Gilroy, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/8/2016,"I used to love coming here with my mom.... We have both decided that we will never come here again, and here is why.  The moment you walk in it has an overwhelming smell that hits you right in the face. A mix between old mop, bathrooms and molding food.  We were seated in the biggest booth for my niece's graduation (as soon as they opened) and there was reminence of days and days of old food in the back of the booth.  I went into restroom to wash my hands and the floor was so disgustingly dirty and sticky. It made me wonder what the kitchen looked like.  Boneless buffalo wings were very dry and didn't have as much sauce as they used to.  My chicken salad had chopped up pieces of the butt of the lettuce and it was brown.  The kids pizza is French bread with spaghetti sauce and a tiny sprinkle of cheese.  The ribs were very very dry and didn't have the membrane taken off of it before cooking. Eating them was like gutting fish.  The sweet potato fries were soggy and seemed like they were from another person's plate, made the day before and reheated.  I caution everyone to think twice about dining here. It's gross food and to top it off it's disgusting and the service is terrible."
Timo L.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/30/2015,"Ug. Geez. Ok.  I get it.   I had medium expectations too, but didn't expect this:  You may have been on the road (I-5) for hours, or spent the day elbowing your way through the not so great deal Outlet Malls, and you are tired, and hungry.  So you think to yourself- ""Let's just go to Applebees- can't be that bad- it's supposed to be a step above...ie. Chili's etc."" FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY.  STOP AND THINK FOR JUST A MOMENT! Do yourself a favor- go over to In-n-Out again, or Mc Donalds, or even the Hot dog stand at the Home Depot (great guy and a local secret favorite by the way). BUT AVOID THIS STICKY, SMELLY, HONEY BOO-BOO DATE NIGHT DESTINATION OF INDIGESTION AT ANY COST! Really.  I wish I could say otherwise, but as one of the busiest Applebees in the country you would think that they would: 1: Understand that it smells like a shuttered up zookeepers shower room in Orlando in August. 2: Understand that occasionally wiping the last 30 diners sputum off the table with actual cleanser is a positive thing. 3: Wilted, soggy, cold, unseasoned greens placed in a jumble with boiled until deceased (and likewise completely unseasoned) new potatoes holding hands with what could only be described as a cadaverous excuse for poor Flossy the milk cow's tumerous beef growth is not a steak dinner. 4. Mac and Cheese, covered with dried chicken (I hope) tenders, and then drenched with a brown embalming fluid is not  American, comfort food, or even possibly legal in some states. 5. Artichoke what?  on Salmon?  Wha?  Ew.  Wilted, wet and uncomfortable once again. 6. There are beers that you say you have but you don't because they are only in some restaurants but not this one? But they are on the friggin menu but your server can't get them for you 'cause whatever 'cause whatever 'cause well to hell with it.  (Try some alcohol in your mixed drinks too, if you can afford to put another lump of coal on the fire Uncle Scrooggelebee.) I could go on, but won't.  I think you get it. Recommendations to Applebees parent company or otherwise: 1.  Every single night clean the **** out of this place.  Stem to Stern. Figure out with cadaver dogs or otherwise where that smell is coming from. (Carpet, chairs and tables probably in that order Mr. Manager.) 2.  Send your head chef ( the guy who makes up dishes such as the aforementioned wouldn't serve it to Gitmo prisoners Mac -n-Cheese) well..... to Gitmo (before it closes down or just leave them there.) Good grief- everything was just awful- even to look at.   3.  Retrain the entire staff- they probably thought one of the perks of working there was eating for free...I feel so sorry for them. Please give them meaning in life by allowing them to serve decent, non-hybridized, over reaching, godawful attempts at some sort of American cuisine.  Tone it down in the kitchen.  just make it good.  Simple. Tasty.  Your customers are the tired and newly poor (Outlet Malls again) and need to treated as such.  Not given literally what could be their last meal before they contact some incurable virus from the environs and cross the dark divide.  4. Remember what it means to be in charge of what was once one of the most sought after restaurant chains for groups such as the Ladies Auxiliary retirement club, or the speed dater's anonymous Wednesday group, or the Holiday Inn Express next door go to place.  C'mon people, you were great once.  ( I think) ( I heard it somewhere).  This isn't complicated.  Throw on some clean socks, slick back your hair, hike up you khakis, and make Gilroy's Applebees the apple of your eye!  Imagine how it will look on your restaurant improvement resume when you attend the managers convention for DineEquity in BEEEAUTIful Gelndale California.  Yea! P.S. If this is a franchisee owned restaurant- I give up."
Meygan C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,10,,2.0,10/30/2016,"came here about 6:45pm on a Saturday. it wasn't too busy. The food wasn't bad (a little pricey), but the waitress was not very friendly, nor did I feel she wanted to be there or have that job. She took over 30 minutes to place our order and just as we were getting up to say forget it, she shows up. she was just very distracted  and would stop to talk to other waitresses/waiters instead of helping tables"
Dan G.,"San Jose, CA",0,25,1,2.0,7/8/2015,Ordered an oriental chicken salad and an American butger. The salad was overloaded with cabbage. Otherwise it was fair. The hamburger was   have dill pickles inside the patty. I asked for no pickles. Half of the burger had pickles. It also was supposed to have onions inside. Onions were.on the outside. I also ordered onion rings. They tasted like the oil hadn't been changed in weeks.  The service was friendly but it took a long time for the food. The manager apologized and comped the burger.
