Carol V.,"Fox Point, WI",2,30,6,2.0,10/31/2017,"Sometimes you just feel like a quick ""chain meal"" when you're out and about ....  You know, where you walk in and know exactly what you want to order because it's your go-to dish for that particular chain.   Last night we chose Applebee's while at Bayshore.   Couldn't believe we hadn't been there yet....it was our first time in this location.  I was immediately struck with how dirty it was.  Coincidentally (?) as we noted that a waiter appeared with a broom and seemed to be tidying up in the area we were seated.    Ok.  We'll take a seat.  But quickly understood why there was no waiting... To be seated.   The couple at the table next to us was getting ready to leave and heard me mention how hungry I was and said ""it's gonna be a while...."".  They had waited over 30 minutes for their food.    I give a star for the service because our waiter ( Carrington ) very quickly moved us to a different table because ours was rocking as he approached us.   And he took our order right away.  It's not his fault how slow the kitchen is.  Trouble with too much time waiting for our dinner is we were again struck by the uncleanliness of the place.  There was so much grime on the table condiments I hated to touch anything before eating.  It desperately needs a deep cleaning which should happen daily.   Second star is for the consistency in my dish....fiesta lime chicken is still my fav there!   But the mango iced tea taste like plain ice tea.  Even after it was replaced.  The Dollarita wasn't worth more than that  but my husband couldn't resist.  I was not tempted, knowing that house meant very low end...hence the buck.   No stars for drinks. ambiance or overall satisfaction."
Heather P.,"Vernon Hills, IL",23,2,6,2.0,10/6/2017,Server is so lazy. Waiting times is so long. I ordered box for remaining dish. I am waiting for 10 min. So bad.
Alan H.,"Milwaukee, WI",47,1,,1.0,11/5/2017,"Walked in here because I haven't  had Applebee's in so long,we got seated,and were told out server would help us soon,after 20 minutes of waiting and not one person checking on us,we decided to get up and leave,and just walked to five guys."
Nikhil P.,"Lower East Side, Milwaukee, WI",8,2,,1.0,10/7/2017,$1 margaritas pretty low quality. Understaffed for Fri night. People are nice and doing their job but very diminished quality of service.
Sharon B.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,23,1,3.0,10/8/2017,"We went to this location on Saturday evening around 6:30-7p on September 23rd. When we first walked in it was very loud at the bar area & some of the tables were not cleaned off w/ all the dirty plates & cups. Also there were crumbs on the floor which shows clearly someone that works in the front area is not maintaining a clean area. The guy that greeted this evening was not friendly at saying its an 10-15 minute wait like that was going to change our minds. But our family decided to stay & give this location a try because usually we go to Falls. Our waitress Janecia was so kind & friendly; she told us she used to work at the Kia Tim on Brown Deer prior to them closing. Our food was good and overall & waitress was excellent. Just the overall entrance into the restaurant, greeting & tables not being cleaned were not."
Jon V.,"Milwaukee, WI",2,38,17,4.0,2/9/2017,"Went in not expecting much and I was pleasantly surprised.  Was seated right away, though my booth didn't have those little electronic machines which i heard is how you can now ordered through, the waiter was prompt enough in taking my order and serving me.  If they keep this up, I probably will come back more often."
Kevin R.,"Port Washington, WI",7,142,3,1.0,12/11/2016,"Wow - I am absolutely mystified how this place could possibly be this bad and still be open.  We went there on this past Friday night, and my first indication of what we were in for should have been that we did not have to wait for a table... on a Friday night... at 7pm... at a mall during Christmas season.  Dummy me. Here are some of the issues we experienced: 1. We had to ask 5 separate times for our drinks, including twice from the manager.  We finally had to go the bar twice and request them. 2. Our kids meals were ordered long before our adult meals were ordered, and our adult meals came out first.  We had to ask for our kids meals, and when they came out they were cold.  And my kid's strawberries were really cold - as in frozen solid. 3. We never were asked for refills, but not surprised since our meal was more than 1/2 over before we got them in the first place. 4. Our adult meals were very bland. 5. We had to ask twice for our check and waited 15 minutes to get it so we could pay.  All throughout the meal, I was continuously looking for someone, anyone, who could help us.  No one cared enough to come to us.  Our server was nowhere to be found. 6. The place is dirty - restaurant, bathroom, bar, everything. This is just a brief summary of the issues.  The bottom line is that they have terrible, inept service, a manager that doesn't care or is incompetent, the food is bad, and it isn't the cleanest place either.  Skip this location to save your sanity."
Jolie D.,"Queens, Queens, NY",5,3,2,2.0,7/27/2017,"I've always been an Applebee's fan. But the menus have started to really irritate me. The food turns out looking nothing like the actual pictures in the menu. I had ordered a macaroni, bacon, honey sauce pasta with chicken. And it was absolutely terrible. The dessert is great though."
Drevon B.,"Milwaukee, WI",53,2,,1.0,10/6/2017,This has to be one of the worst Applebees in history. We were sat and waited for the server to come over it took her 45 minutes to come over and say hello to us.then once she did take down the drinks it was another 45 mins till we received them. my thing is if it was busy I could understand that but it wasn't. so why were we waiting 2 hours to receive our drinks? I would never recommend eating there.
Marian Q.,"Milwaukee, WI",143,121,149,3.0,4/2/2015,"This is my first time since the move and it's definitely an improvement in location although parking on that side of the mall has always been pretty difficult. Your best bet is the parking structure since they converted the lot as Trader Joe's only parking. I was there for lunch with a couple of friends and the dining area had plenty of natural light.  The food and service...was ok. Our food came out pretty timely once we ordered but 2 of us couldn't really start eating our burgers because we didn't get the lettuce/onion/tomato we ordered.This left our 3rd dining companion awkwardly picking at her fries. My burger wasn't cooked terribly, I do like my meat on the more well done side but I didn't even get the option (I mean at least give me the illusion that I'm in control of my order, right?). It didn't seem like a terribly busy day but there was some waiting in between finishing our food and the check. I would hate to see what the wait time would be like if it was busy. I wouldn't mind giving it a try again."
Haley F.,"Milwaukee, WI",200,124,27,1.0,2/26/2017,"This place is a complete mess. Tables sat dirty for our entire meal around us. Our table was dirty as we approached it. She seated us at the table while we watched her clean it. I ordered a bourbon and berries; but they didn't have the Makers Mark that is used for this drink. I ordered a Corona, this was also n/a. :( We ordered the Butcher's Meat and Potatoes... IT WAS JUST A PILE OF MASHED POTATOES AND GRAVY WITH ONION STRINGS! There was ZERO meat in the dish. The Butcher really butchered that dish. We ordered the brunch burger and the egg was not cooked the way it was intended. The server was very apologetic and replaced it promptly; so props to her."
Ken S.,"Brea, CA",0,44,,5.0,2/19/2017,"Amazing food. Amazing service. Especially from the new waitress; Amanda. She is absolutely sweet and took care of of us extremely well. Her personality is adorable and her will to make sure we were satisfied was a plus. We figured out that she'd only been working for 2 weeks, but it sure seemed liked she had been there for longer. She is officially my favorite server ever. My girlfriend and I just want to hug her. 10/10, highly recommended."
Monique W.,"Milwaukee, WI",131,1,,1.0,3/29/2017,"Worst restaurant experience ever. No drinks, food was incorrect, no silverware, missing food...no help from staff"
Alisha A.,"Seward, AK",92,41,100,1.0,2/5/2017,"Possibly the worst service and the worst Applebees I've ever been to. It took an hour to get food, our orders where all wrong and it was the worst steak I've ever had. Think cremated instead of the medium-rare we requested. And the meal was lukewarm! We ended up having to get to go because we where rushing with work and it had been so long we needed to go, but the bills took so long to come that we ended up eating our 'to go' meals at the table and being late. And it wasn't just the food either. My sangria was so watered down that it barely represented the drink we all know and love. Disgusting!! And the water I wanted never came. What a very bad representation of the chain. What a waste of money... especially when we didn't order the cheap meals. The servers did NOT seem to care and I can honestly say after being a frequent customer at Applebee's, I now do not wish to return again to any location. Such a letdown. Absolutely livid!"
Emily S.,"South Milwaukee, WI",0,24,4,2.0,4/18/2017,Waited a long time to be greeted. Food was very fresh for applebees but the server was never around and she took 8 minutes to get us our waters&lemonade.
Carl V.,"Naperville, IL",0,2,,1.0,1/27/2016,"So terrible that it made me leave this, my first Yelp review. I wish zero stars was an option. Where to start... We arrived with a party of three and stated that the fourth was about 15 minutes behind. We were seated immediately (plenty of open booths), but no waiter to be found. After waiting 10 minutes without being so much as greeted by a server, we were rudely told by the hostess that we wouldn't be served until the fourth had arrived. Fine.  When the entire party had been seated, we ordered our drinks. About another twenty minutes later after sitting empty and alone, we were able to flag the server down for refills. We then put orders in for appetizers and waited another half hour with no contact. Appetizers arrived and the order (wings) was wrong. We were so hungry at this point we ate them anyway.  Less than five minutes after the appetizers arrived, the entrées did as well. But not all of them, just two of the four. One was completely wrong. The wrong entrée was taken back to be fixed, and we were left to sit for another 20 minutes, one entrée getting cold and three more M.I.A. A good 25 minutes later a second entree arrives, again wrong (incorrect rob sauce). Ten minutes after that, a third. Another ten minutes after that, the first incorrect order comes back.  Just a botched experience all around. Terrible service, unresponsive and absent management, mediocre food, empty dishes were not bussed at all throughout the meal, screwed up more orders than not. Will not be coming back."
Matthew P.,"Milwaukee, WI",9,15,,1.0,4/24/2016,"My wife and I stopped in for a quick drink. We sat at the bar and the bartender asked us what we would like to drink, then walked away for a minute and came back  Very odd, but we saw her do this again. I ordered a blended margarita which came with the syrup on the bottom, the white mix in the middle, and the liquor on top. I spent three minutes blending it myself. Very poor service."
Ann M.,"Brown Deer, WI",0,3,,4.0,11/11/2016,We went for lunch on Veterans Day and were so welcomed! Wonderful staff and good food. We will be back.
Pokher A.,"Round Lake, IL",38,55,205,1.0,9/29/2016,"I frequent Applebee's quite often but this locaton is the worst I've been to. The restaurant is 1/4 full on a Thursday night and the place is a mess. The service was super slow and the bar area was a mess. The rail in front of me was full of dirty glasses while the bartender was busy partying with 6 regulars. This is our second visit at this location and the first time was no difference , very slow service and the place was not at all busy. There will not be a 3rd visit for this store."
Stephen B.,"Cedarburg, WI",0,1,,1.0,1/1/2016,"Nearly empty upon arrival, and seated immediately.   After that, the experience went downhill: The silverware was filthy, particularly the knives. Yuck. The touchscreen device at the table was covered with food grime. Yuck.  We placed our order, and then waited for what seemed to be an eternity -- at least 30 minutes.  We asked for straws for our two children, and then we had to again 10 minutes later. Really? The food itself was disappointing.  The pricing was high relative to the food quality.    My wife has declared that we will never eat at Applebees again."
Becky M.,"Sheboygan, WI",42,2,,1.0,3/25/2017,"This was the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. First we sat at a table that felt dirty. The drinks we ordered didn't come until AFTER we finished our appetizer. Then they brought the wrong food out to our table. After we finally got our food, we didn't have any silverware to eat with. The silverware they did bring was dirty and gross. The food was the only good part of the night although the plates it was on were pretty gross looking... not sure it was cleaned properly. When we finally got our check our waitress was nowhere to be found. She was horrible! Surprised she can still work there"
Beni H.,"Glendale, WI",44,40,6,1.0,7/14/2015,"There should be a half star option or no star option for this place. I dislike Applebee's already, but went as my husband wanted to try something he saw advertised.  It took us 10 mins to be seated, mind you no one was in front or behind us, there was no hostess at the stand when we arrived. We were seated and waited another 15 mins while the people around us, even the ones that were seated after us were served beverages and their food. We left after waiting for so long and went across the street to 5 Guys, because they never disappoint. Please, don't go to this location!"
Eve M.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,4,,1.0,9/18/2016,"I only gave it one star because I had to other than that it doesn't deserve anything. I went for the Friday fish fry this weekend because it was late and one of the places that had an all you can eat. I knew service in the past have been bad but once it was pretty much okay praying that I would get the same service today, it didn't happen it was worse than ever. We were seated immediately but it took the waitress more than 20 minutes to come over and even after I called the waitress on the prompter that sits on your table she still did not come over right away. When she did she was apologetic for her not having a good day it was a bad night and she had too many people that she could not handle and was complaining about how her life was hell.  this turned me off. Because I didn't need to hear her problems I was hungry and I wanted to eat like three hours ago. We place our order and it took another 30 minutes to eat and when the food came out I must admit my daughters looked very well she had the appetizer sampler but when I received my fish the plate was soaked in grease, The fish was hard dry and overcooked and burnt. I sent it back and when it came back out it was yet the same by this time I'm is really starving because I'm a diabetic and I was beginning to feel sick to my stomach because of me not eating and my blood sugar dropping. The only thing that kept me afloat was eating mostly half my daughters plate and drinking the water down strawberry lemonade that was failed to be refilled. When the waitress came over she ask what was wrong and I told her. When she sent the manager over the manager had a problem because my daughter and I shared the appetizers plate instead of addressing the issue with the grease soaked fish. Because I gave my daughter a half a piece of fish to substitute for me eating nearly most half of her meal they decide to charge me for two all you can eat fish dinners. Thankfully there was a higher up manager than her. he came to the table he was very apologetic and he only charged me for the meal and drinks that my daughter had. still this is isn't enough I will never go back to this Applebee's again not even if they're giving something away for free. Especially after I had to go to their rivalry and order another dinner from the cheesecake factory."
Kevin N.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,50,1,2.0,3/10/2016,A couple of years ago: appatizers were good but specialty drinks were horrible and pre-made. Last year came by with my 24 year old daughter and wife. Manager refused to let my sorry arse in because I didn't have an ID with me. I guess policy is policy.
Bill H.,"Tipton, IA",27,20,5,1.0,10/10/2016,"Avoid this place!.....Traveling and not knowing the area.....I was looking for a place to eat....saw the Applebees and thought....it's a national chain....should be ok.....WRONG!....finding a place to park was terrible.....got lucky and someone pulled out just as I was going by....was seated immediately.....then I sat for 15 minutes while wait staff continued to walk right past me.....finally the manager came by and asked if I had been helped....I said no...so she took my order....she grabbed the ordering device from my table and evidently placed my order for them?.......finally was recognized by my server and he apologized and said my order was put in.....I waited another 10 minutes just to get the bottle of beer I ordered.....then another person brought my food out.....sat it down at my table....and walked away.....it would have been ok if I had silverware to eat with.....I guess I could have picked up the steak and ate it with my fingers caveman style.....the steak was very grisley, and the shrimp were very small and overcooked.....not once did anyone come by and ask if I needed another beer......finished my meal and waited another 10 minutes for my check....which he brought and MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR BILL CLOSELY!!....because I found some video game added to my bill for $1.99....(remember the manager grabbed the device off the table??).....they did remove the charge from my bill......here for another night....guess where I WON'T be eating!!??....."
Jenna O.,"Milwaukee, WI",60,86,9,2.0,9/1/2015,"Very average experience... I definitely was not blown away by our service. The food was good but the service was slow and the restaurant was dirty. The table next to us left and their dishes sat there for over a half hour, and no the place wasn't super busy either!"
Tshachee L.,"Madison, WI",0,1,,1.0,11/2/2015,Worst service ever. Does not treat every racial group with equal service. Do not waste your time there. Waited 20 mins and did not even get our water.
Angie O.,"Shorewood, WI",354,411,274,2.0,2/19/2013,"You know what you're getting yourself into when you go to an Applebee's. I choose this location based on the fact it's on my way home from job #1 and job #2 is at Bayshore. I only come here to unwind after a stressful day: they have $2.99 tall ($1.99 regular) long islands all day every day. And, in my opinion, they are pretty amazing and always help cheer me up and/or relax. Service is hit or miss. Sometimes it's awesome, other times it can be pretty bad. I only order food here if there's nothing at home and/or I feel like I'm starving to death. I've never had anything bad and I feel it always comes out rather quickly. I know it's all unhealthy, and most items contain more calories than I would consume in a typical day - or two. Except for the ""healthy"" items, and from what I have tried, those are all pretty lackluster. People watching can be pretty fun here. They also have lots of tvs to catch whatever game is on. Bottom line: Don't seek out Applebee's for unique or nutritious meals, or stellar service. But the drink specials are worth it if you're at the mall!!"
Tim E.,"Lexington, KY",5,196,43,2.0,8/24/2014,"Ate here because was close to hotel, and would be fast. Food pretty much the same as any applebees. Waitress did not mention drink or any  specials.  At dinnertime the dining area was empty but I was seated next to a couple. they carried on a routine conversation but their language was so vulgar, I almost as the waitress to move me to another table."
Bethany W.,"Houston, TX",286,148,177,1.0,3/5/2015,Eat here only if all the other food joints are closed.  Was I expecting five star cuisine? No. But I was expecting better than what I got. Edible but not enjoyable.  So why only 1 star? mediocre food and poor service equals only 1 star in my book.  I came in by myself on a Thursday at 12:15. It's the lunch rush and there was only myself and another lady at the bar. We both ordered at the about the same time and she managed to get three different items before I ever got my sandwich. It took over 20 minutes once I placed my order. Fine I say. I'll over look it cause I'm famished and am now gonna be cutting time close. Well to my sad dismay my fries were cold. Even worse I ordered the chicken fajita wrap which barely had any chicken in it. I swear if I dumped all the ingredients on the plate it was maybe three bites worth. Fine...I'm still so hungry I could eat my arm. But the greatest offense was to come. The tortilla was hard. Like so hard when I bite the sand which the tortilla cracked cause it was dry. I barely scarfed some down I was that hungry. When the bartender came over she asked if I needed anything right away. I said I needed my check as I was already running behind on time. Well 15 minutes ago by and she brings me my check after chatting up her friends.  AVOID!
Alexandra B.,"Milwaukee, WI",122,8,1,1.0,3/6/2015,"Literally the worst experience of my life! I called in an order for Curbside ToGo and no one told me they didn't have that! I drove around and around without luck. Then I waited at the bar for 25 minutes for me gross cold food! I complained and got a call from the manager with a lame half assed apology, but nothing else. Thanks, but no thanks! Keep your cold, gross, tacky food away!!!!!"
Lisa L.,"Plymouth, WI",1,2,20,1.0,3/29/2015,Absolutely terrible in every way .... just like every other time I've been to this place!  Never going to an applebees again!
Merete M.,"Milwaukee, WI",98,265,29,2.0,10/23/2013,"While our server was completely on-point (the only reason for the 2nd star), the food was..................... not. I had flavored lemonade for my beverage of choice, and it was supposed to be strawberry-lemon, but it mostly tasted like lemonade with pink in it. Strangely just like the mixed-berry lemonade I had for my second choice.  The food was no saving grace. I had the fried green beans with the dippin' sauces. They were fine. But I opted for one of their steak and shrimp options. the steak seemed to have been thawed from frozen. It came with a side of broccoli that was -smothered- with garlic and something else that had an off taste.  I suppose it's no secret that when going to Applebees, just go for apps, drinks, or lunch. Dinner is a no go."
Thomas G.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,7,,1.0,3/30/2016,"This place gets my vote for the worst restaurant in all of Milwaukee. Went there recently. Were not assisted by the hostess, leaning against the counter. Went to sit down. Waited 20 minutes to be noticed. Clueless wait staff everywhere. Decided to leave and on the way out notified the hostess that we had not been waited on. She, with a face as blank as you can imagine, didn't even respond as we left. I wouldn't go back to this place if they gave me a free lunch. Really bad."
Terry M.,"Washington, DC",1,6,,1.0,10/28/2015,By far the worst service I experienced this year. It took approximately an hour for the food to arrive and to make matters worse the waitress was unapologetically disengaged. If you DON'T value your time this is the restaurant to visit.
Jessica A.,"Milwaukee, WI",109,2,2,1.0,11/21/2015,"My boyfriend, his mom and myself went to get dinner there. The decor was warm but thats all that was good about our experience.  We waited 20 minutes to get a table when we could see plenty of tables open. When we finally got sat, it took another 10 minutes to get our waiter to our table. We ordered our drinks and waited another 20 minutes to recieve them. We placed our order and got the soups after 10 minutes (the quickest part of the night.) My boyfriend and his mom got their steaks and I sat without a plate for 20 minutes. My boyfriends mom asked for sour cream from 4 different people and finally the hostess got it for her. We asked the manager (who seemed to be annoyed with a complaint and seemed like she doesnt care) to see where my meal was and she slowly went back into the kitchen to get my meal. We ate our meals and our waiter was no where to be seen. He never asked us if we wanted another drink (we all were empty for 20 minutes) or how our food was. But he was real quick to drop off our check and had the audacity  to stand there and say I can take that for you right away. This was the worst dining experience I have ever experienced.  I will not return."
Jennell J.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,21,4,1.0,5/17/2013,"My boyfriend and I went on a weekday evening. It seemed fairly slow, as we were seated next to one other group, and the rest of the section was empty. We sat and looked at the menu...and sat... About 10 minutes later the two girls sitting next to us told us that they had to wait 20 minutes to get drinks, that it was the worst service they'd ever had, and that we should leave while we had the chance. Not being one to complain, I said we'd wait 5 more minutes, so we did... ...and nothing. No water, drinks, nothing.  After a full 15 minutes (not at ALL an exaggeration) we finally got up and left. I know Applebees can be very busy, and I could understand a wait like that. But with how slow it really was and not even a ""be right with you"", it was hands down, the worst Applebees service ever."
Ilya S.,"Mequon, WI",0,29,4,1.0,9/14/2014,"To start out I have been Cooking for a living for two decades! We were shopping,and I decided I wanted to try the all you can eat crosscut ribs? Who names a meat product after the the way you cut it on a menu!Anyways we order the drinks and the high server brings the drinks 20min later in a dead restaurant. My other parties tortilla burger came out well done dry as cardboard,a complete waste of $10 for a burger that was just a hot mess! My ribs came with honey bbq not chipotle. I asked them to be flash grilled too much to ask for? No grill flavor,and was told they just deep fry? Why at least par bake them and flash grill them to order! The server said he is bringing more after waiting for 10min! They come and this time Asian Chili? Wtf is a simple order hard to get right with two tables in your section? I had enough I am not going to sit and wait 20min for refills or another 20min for the right food. I got the 19yr old minimum wage Mgr and told her everything. She said anything I can do? Is that the training they get? Make it right fire some people make things work or close! A Dirty unsanitary place full of lazy highschool dropouts,drug using staff that should of stayed at Mcdonalds begging for $15hr! I see why they are all closing this one has to be next !"
John C.,"Port Washington, WI",0,58,133,1.0,3/5/2016,"I had been at the old Applebee's when inside the Bayshore Mall several years ago and before Yelp.  I could not get served with drink or food for over 30 minutes at lunch time at a 1/2 full restaurant.  They have since built a new building outside the mall. It's looks nice.  I decided to give it a try again.   Went on 3-5-16 around 5 pm.  Parking: none.   Applebee's corporation really?   Why would I want to park my near the place.  Hostess I will call highlighter girl has a map of the restaurant a several highlighters.  The restaurant had been half full (maybe). No hello or greeting.   Highlighter girl takes the top off the yellow one and says restaurant or bar.  I respond which ever.  She puts the cap back on and said then go sit at the bar.  This restaurant has two areas and one appears to be a bar. With table around it and several TVs.  You may have seen this in every other restaurant in America.  Its half full.  We sit at a table next to the bar.   After 10 minutes. Highlighter girl comes up and says you can't sit here because there is a 15 minute wait for a table.  I have to sit at the actual bar top. I decided that this had all ready been the same experience and left to nothing.   No sorry, no explanation why I have to wait to sit at an empty table or why I can't wait at this table to sit at another empty table in 15 minutes.   I can't even leave fast because so many other customers are leaving pissed off over a 15 to 30 minute wait when they see 25 tables open.  Applebee's really?   Do you even want to try?  Is there a manger or regional person even trying.   I've seen some poor performance but this is the worst I've seen in customer service.  I guess one positive would be if you want to lose weight, go everyday."
Eli R.,"Canton, MI",0,1,1,5.0,1/9/2014,"I have eaten here at this Applebee's many times over the last two years and I will continue to come back. My server has always been quick and friendly, and the food is spot on. I usually don't expect much coming a chain restaurant, but this Applebee's does a great job."
