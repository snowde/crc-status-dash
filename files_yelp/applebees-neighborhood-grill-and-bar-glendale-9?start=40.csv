Diana D.,"Milwaukee, WI",119,9,,1.0,3/6/2015,"I've never really loved any Applebee's locations, but this is by far the worst one I've been to.  The restaurant looked 50% empty, but there was a line of about 6 parties waiting for tables.  The hostesses and waiters looked very uninterested and had no sense of urgency whatsoever.  The food was also very below average.  I will not be coming back to this location."
David K.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,68,9,1.0,10/27/2013,"DISASTROUS  PLACE TO EAT!! My son took his girlfriend to Applebees.  He said he had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated even though there were many empty tables. He said that the hamburgers he ordered were barely edible and were cold. He said that his waiter was unfriendly and acted like a robot and did not smile. Yes, this is a 2nd hand review but I have been to Applebees myself on a few rare occasions and can completely concur with what my son had told me.  While I did not have to wait quite that long for a table and my waiter was somewhat cordial, the food was cold and did not seem at all fresh. I knew then that this visit would be my last. The only reason my son went back was that he had a $25 gift card so in essence, his meal was free. Irrespective of the gift card, his service stank, his waiter stank and the time it took for him to be seated stank. Time to close up shop, Applebees, and let's see a decent restaurant in it's place."
Kate T.,"Aiea, HI",485,397,276,1.0,7/9/2012,"While visiting wisconsin I wanted to go to Applebees so my mom took me there on my last night there. I was really disappointed. What happened to customer service? The people working here are not very nice at all. After commenting on our servers attitude my husband told me that it was probably her last shift so she was entitled to act like that. I'm sorry I don't care if your pet died your at work and you shouldn't be as mean as our server was.  Even though the workers were completely horrible, the food was pretty good. The drinks were strong and the restaurant was clean. Another thing is that the service was quick. Even though the restaurant had these strong points the workers made me not want to ever come back again.  LEARN TO USE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!"
Kelly S.,"Saukville, WI",0,12,,3.0,1/12/2015,"It's Applebees. It's fine. Sometimes its good, sometimes it's not. I've never had anything really terrible from here, it's usually at least Decent. The waiters have always been at least nice, if sometimes slow or kind of strange. I recommend coming here on the weekends, since the atmosphere feels inexplicably strange during weekdays when the restaurant is mostly empty."
John A.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,9,,2.0,11/22/2014,Watched the manager get into a verbal fight with a customer. Was pretty funny. Although I feel bad for her in the end because she was pretty much in the right.
Harriet M.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,1,,1.0,11/19/2015,"I have always been a big fan of Applebee's since it started in Kansas City and that's where I'm from. Tried this one twice and it's a disgrace.  The service was terrible.  The waiters seemed more interested in talking among themselves than waiting on their customers.  The food took forever and when it finally came, it was mediocer.  I will never go there again.  If you want an Applebee's that's a credit to this chain,try the one in Oak Creek."
G F.,"Hales Corners, WI",1,27,23,1.0,3/29/2016,"We went to this Applebees a couple weeks ago to celebrate my Mom's birthday. Although it wasn't busy- When walking in, the Hostess informs us that we'll have to wait 10 minutes to be seated and ""wait even longer because we're short on staff"". We accept and decide while waiting, we'll at least have a drink at the bar- which only had two other patrons. While waiting at the bar to order a drink, one staff is closing out the drawer so the other bartender couldn't take my order. He acknowledges that I'm theWere and tells me to ""wait"". When the staff appeared to be done closing out her drawer, the bartender STILL does not take my order.  He just tends to the other patrons already there, as I patiently wait. At this time, three other people walk in and sit down. The bartender answered their questions and as I thought he was opening the drawer, ready to take my order, the previous staff who closed her drawer, jumps back on the computer. At this point, I'm waiting 15 minutes. Our name was called for a table, and as my Mom waits at the table, I'm still waiting at the bar to order a drink. We figured at the rate this was going, if a waitress tends to her first, then I order, we'd be good with a few drinks to last our entire meal. Once the staff is done messing around on the computer/drawer, the bartender takes another patrons order first. Patrons that came after me. I let it slide and wait... Reminding him I'm still waiting, he acknowledges, and STILL takes ANOTHER patrons order. It this point, it's been 25 minutes with no order taken. My Mom is still waiting at the table and has not had anyone come to take drink orders there either. After a HALF AN HOUR, I had enough. We left and went to Buffalo Wild Wings across the street. Ridiculous!"
Frank Z.,"Whitefish Bay, WI",7,1,,1.0,1/11/2014,"I've eaten at quite a few Applebee's and this one is by far the worst. Our waitress was very kind but our food was horrendous. The fries were soggy and cold. They were the worst fries I have ever tasted in my life. Also, there were old, dried French fries and onion crisps missed in with our chips. Do you guys not know how to be organized and clean? There were also water stains on our plates. Disgusting. The quality and quantity of food was lower than I had expected. I will not be coming back to Applebee's anytime soon."
Ryan L.,"Milwaukee, WI",11,31,1,3.0,3/12/2015,"This is in regards to Applebee's Bayshore at their new location right next to Pt Washington Rd. The old location attached to the mall has been closed and bears signs directing you to the new building. It should be noted that there are absolutely no parking spaces dedicated to ""Carside to Go"" which is advertised as being an amenity to this location. Other locations have dedicated parking spaces off to the side of the lot and have attendant comes out of Applebee's and bring meals direct to your car. You need to find a parking space yourself (good luck) and walk to Applebee's. You walk in via the front door since they lock the ""Carside to Go"" door. Your meals are held at a counter behind the bar. If you go at 3ish in the afternoon you're fine. Any later then that and the bar crowd is so thick it's going to be a mess picking up that order. If you have a choice of locations for a ""Carside to Go"" order, go to Menomonee Falls. They have a 6 parking space section and are very prompt. The food at this Bayshore location is fine, but they forgot the coleslaw on my two riblet platters when I ordered. Not a huge concern since they come in tiny cups, but getting it would have been nice."
Chelsea G.,"Noble Square, Chicago, IL",9,15,1,1.0,3/8/2015,"Walked in and noticed about half the place was empty. The host and what I assume was the manager was talking to a women in front of us. They told us it would be a 15-20 minute wait when we could clearly see about 12 open tables. What really turned me off was the manager telling the women in front of us that they do not accommodate groups more than 9 people. The women asked if they could split up the group into different tables. The manager proceeded to tell them they do not do that because he doesn't want people walking around and getting in the way. I can see where he is coming from, however this was a large group big money and they are paying for a service. After listening to how rude he was treating the group my friend and I walked out. I believe the customer is right and should be accomidated.  There are tons of places to eat in that mall they better get their service together or people will do what we did! CPK treated us great!"
Robert S.,"West Bend, WI",0,5,,3.0,3/26/2015,Our appetizers took a bit long but the new restaurant looks great!
Melissa A.,"Mequon, WI",0,2,,1.0,2/15/2015,To be honest I can't believe anyone gave this location more than one star. I've been sitting at a table for 15 minutes unacknowledged. Scared to eat their food...
Danielle I.,"Milwaukee, WI",78,160,36,3.0,4/28/2013,It's an appleebees what do you really want from it? this place isnt any worse or any better than any other applebees i have ever been in. I will say they have the cheapest Long Island i have ever found. So for that they get a 3 star no more for that though not exactly the first pick for food there's so many great local restaurants to visit over a chain.
MO P.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,50,53,1.0,5/21/2014,My 16 year old daughter wanted a hot chocolate with peppermint...she was served a hot chocolate with Schnapps peppermint! She's underage and has never had alcohol and didn't know why her drink taste so nasty...needless to say I was pissed the waiter didn't check ID or question it.
Kindle M.,"Wisconsin Rapids, WI",0,1,,1.0,10/30/2013,"wow, talk about gross, cold food.  I'm so disappointed with this restaurant  the past few yrs.  customer service is horrible. waitress I had was horrible. I ordered boneless buffalo wings, and queso dip w/ chips, everything was chewy crunchy, and cold...like it had sat under the heat lamp too long.  I've been in the restaurant business for over 10 yrs...so not impressed with this place anymore."
Sean R.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,2,,1.0,9/29/2013,"Very ghetto..from the start, the hostess that took us to our table looked like a lesbian dyke that just got out of prison , no manners and pissy. Took 20 min till we even got water. Than after 30 we got our food and my wife had a bug in her salad.. No biggie it happens with produce..So she sent it back and just ordered Chicken tender basket. Well after 30 min we got that..Nothin but attitude and crappy service. . Stay away f4om this place !!"
Leslie J.,"Lake Zurich, IL",60,76,12,2.0,8/10/2014,"server was very nice but the place was filthy! walking past the side station area to get outside SMELLED, it was dirty and gross. table was sticky. I will NEVER eat there again. would have left if I could!"
Lea W.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,12,2,1.0,5/18/2012,"On May 16,2012 I took my family to Applebee's in Bayshore mall to eat lunch and the food and service was not good at all. The food was not hot and me being a chef was able to tell that the food was not fresh. My wife ordered a sizzling plate and it was not hot or sizzling. The waiter who served us was rude. From this point on, we will never eat that this location again maybe at Applebee's corp restaurants again."
James M.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,16,,1.0,10/9/2015,"My wife wanted to try this new location, I hadn't been to an Applebee's in years but expected it to be the same as I had before since they were always pretty much the same, but I was so wrong, the first neg was we went in and they had half of the tables empty but we were told there was a 10 min wait (which ended up being 5) then we were seated, the wait until the horrible waitress arrived was the other 5 min. we ordered drinks and the dinner at the same time which must have really thrown her off, we waited awhile for the drinks (no free refill) which was fine if the appetizer didn't take 15 min and the wait for the main was about 45 min, the waitress apologized and said it was because they were so busy, my wife and I looked around and we were the only people sitting in out section, across the ""wall"" there was 2 other couples, so 3 out of 25 tables is busy? as for the food, I had steak, or what I thought was supposed to be steak, it was a weird looking cut about 3"" X 2"" and was kind of like a rolled up ball. My wife said her's was barely edible, I had ordered a 2nd drink when the order arrived but it was sitting at the bar the whole time, I was done eating by the time the waitress brought it to me, the main issue is bad service, our food wasn't given to us in a reasonable time (the waitress was hanging out with the hostess counting her tips) the with my drink (lemonade) that I paid twice for was sitting at the bar and so was our waitress for close to 5 min talking with other workers, she got up and didn't grab my drink but went back for it about 10 min later (like I said I was done eating a steak by the time she got back). Overall this place is the worst in Milwaukee, I have dined at some iffy places in my life but this was bad all around, I couldn't find anything pos to say! It was the only time in my life my wife and I left no tip, it was that bad and that awful that we felt cheated spending 45.00 for crappy service and horrible food."
Randy O.,"Milwaukee, WI",2,4,,3.0,10/24/2011,"$1.99 Long Island all day and night - can't beat that. Service is okay at times, could be better."
