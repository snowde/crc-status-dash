Kelly P.,"Indianapolis, IN",91,278,355,3.0,11/30/2017,"Atmosphere / decor - 3 Service - 2 Food - 3 Location - 3 Value - 2.5 Overall 3 We went here on thanksgiving so it was pretty slow. We sat down in the bar and were greeted pretty quickly. Our waters were brought out pretty fast as were my parents drinks. I wanted to order a drink when she dropped off their drinks but I didn't get the opportunity.  I finally got a margarita ordered. I ordered it without the orange liquor because I don't like liquors. She kind of gave me a rough time and tried talking me out of it. I get that it's a weird request but I know what I'm ordering. She also wasn't very attentive. I get that she's the bartender but it wasn't busy at all.  I ordered the cedar chicken (which later my mom told me she made a face at which is not appropriate at all). I thought it was decent, nothing special. It was an option I hadn't had before which was nice because the lighter fare options seems to always be the same.  I'd go to Chili's over here personally."
Jamie Y.,"South Bend, IN",37,87,780,3.0,10/26/2017,"The $1 margaritas for the month of October brought us in, as I don't typically like to visit franchisee chains over dives or independently owned restaurants. However, the quality of the food left me missing some of my favorite local places! The $1 Margarita was OK for the price, nothing to complain or praise about it. It was a basic margarita on the rocks in a mug. My friend ordered another featured holiday drink that was on their menu, but we watched the bartender read a recipe on how to make it. The food was OK. We just ordered appetizers and while the Oriental tacos were good, the spinach artichoke dip was a little bit sad looking. It looks as though they have cut the portion size of their appetizers in half.  Our server was friendly, very friendly, but a bit too attentive. He visited us a lot. Usually that is a great thing, but sometimes too attentive can be a bit over-the-top. Although I much rather have this than inattentive, he was doing his job!"
April K.,"Edwardsburg, MI",0,1,,2.0,7/7/2016,Wait staff was great. Restaurant was clean. Got our food cold and the potatoes were old and hard. Wonton tacos had no flavor at all. Won't go back to this one
Kent K.,"Goshen, IN",0,1,3,5.0,12/16/2015,The 2 for $20's were a great deal.  The servings were generous enough to make doggie-bags for lunch tomorrow!   The service was excellent as well as was the quality of the meal.
Katrina M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",180,161,693,1.0,3/20/2016,"Applebee's is the worst, but grandma loves it. Our meal was awful. I ordered an appetizer as my meal and it came out first as an appetizer. 25 minutes later Zach asks if we want dessert. Their entrees hadn't even come out yet. Apparently there was a ""glitch"" in the system and the order was never put in, unapologetically he put the rest of the order in. They didn't take anything off the bill for the horrible experience or even offer us a free dessert. Zach sucks and so does Applebee's, I won't be back with grandma."
Jamie B.,"Richmond, VA",1,5,,1.0,9/17/2015,This place is horrible...the last 5 times I have been to Applebee's they have messed up my food or my families food. I have given them way too many chances and will never go back. I hate I had to give a rating of one star because it's not even worth one star in my eyes.
Bevely S.,"Marion, MA",0,32,7,4.0,7/11/2016,"Well after reading the previous reviews, we ate there anyway. The service was outstanding. Alex was a great waitress   My Long Island Ice Tea was great. The food was good, but a little overcooked. I got the shrimp stir fry and it was all good except the cook burnt the broccoli. Otherwise I would have given them a 5."
Colleen D.,"Mount Pleasant, MI",0,5,1,1.0,11/6/2015,"Ugh. Horrible. horrible. horrible.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke appetizer. When it came out the dip was cold and the chips were stale. When our food came out the french fries were old, and my boyfriends crunchy shrimp were wayyy overdone.  I ordered another beer so I could have it with my dinner. It took ten minutes, and they were not busy. At all. I was all done with my meal before the drink came.  Run!"
Joel B.,"Goshen, IN",8,53,3,4.0,5/8/2010,"I never used to be much of a fan of Applebee's.  Their service was never great and their food wasn't good enough to overcome it.  However a few months back I gave them another go and visited them for lunch.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  I sat at the bar with a colleague from work.  The bartender, Janet, was phenomenal and gave us great service as well as great food. Now we go there on a fairly regular basis...when we are in town."
Melissa S.,"Goshen, IN",39,1,,1.0,6/7/2015,"Jermaine did an amazing job as our server. I have absolutely no complaints about him. However, I asked Jermaine if they had comment cards because I wanted to comment about all of the visible tattoos on the servers' arms, hands, necks and one of female servers had cleavage exposed making a chest tattoo visible. I myself have a full sleeve tattoo but do not feel it is professional for servers in what is suppose to be a family friendly environment to have tattoos exposed all over their bodies like that. A majority of the servers even had long sleeves on. There is no reason why these servers cannot have their long sleeves rolled down covering up their ink. Jermaine was polite and requested the manager's attention for me. The kitchen manager was the only one available at the time and he came to our table and politely greeted myself and my boyfriend. I was not rude, I simply told him that it doesn't make it feel like a family friendly atmosphere with the staff walking around with tattoos exposed all over their bodies when there are uniforms capable of covering them. The manager said it's company policy that tattoo exposure is acceptable. He wasn't rude by any means but seconds later, after he went back to them he kitchen, numerous servers came out of the kitchen rolling their eyes and shooting glares at myself and my boyfriend. I was at a high top in the bar area and overheard the bartender make a comment about people complaining about servers and tattoos. She then proceeded to refer to me as a bitch and when I heard that and looked over at her, she shot me a nasty look and rolled her eyes and then looked away. My boyfriend took a hit off of his vape and this same bartender (we later found out her name was Jess) snapped at him from behind the bar across the room saying ""Um sir those aren't allowed in here."" She had a VERY condescending tone and my boyfriend asked if this policy was posted anywhere Jess proceeded to look at another server standing next to her and loudly ask her, ""Isn't it company policy that those aren't allowed?"" At this point, Jess had most of the restaurant starring at her irate antics and verbal abuse of a customer. I told her she wasn't being very professional and she shot another dirty look at us and walked off off to the back. The kitchen manager clearly did not display a professional stature by informing the entire staff that a customer commented on all of the tattoos and then allowed them to all walk around with poor customer service skills and allowed the bartender to become irate and confrontational. If the vaping isn't allowed, the professional thing to do is to politely approach our table and let us know. There was absolutely no need for her to shout it from across the room to us also allowing the rest of the restaurant to be interrupted by her. I am BEYOND angry and displeased with my experience at this restaurant. I've had MUCH better service from McDonald's restaurants! I will NEVER return to this particular Applebee's."

Jim B.,"Carmel, IN",0,1,,1.0,11/9/2013,"One of the worst restaurants I have ever eaten in.  Lousy service, worse food.  I am a vegan and asked for a salad that was vegan..it came with cheese. I returned it and then they dumped oil all over it.  Hostess was barely clothed, place was musty smelling.  Even for rural Indiana this place is terrible."
