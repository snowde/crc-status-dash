John M.,"Austin, TX",346,429,1371,5.0,7/20/2017,"Last review I wrote for Applebees was 2013, back in Austin...This was walking distance for our adventure for Lego Land, Aquarium and the hotel we stayed at for the weekend. I will give to them for the constant attempt at menu changes, keeping it new and inviting. This experience was really out of bounds for us...something we talked about on the way back to Austin...Service was great...but the food stood out...Simply put, it was perfect....We have had the pretzels with cheese sauce before, and the new improved sauce it outstanding...We would visit just for these..Wife had the fish and chips...crisp, hot and the fresh...Fries crispy...4 cheese mac with Honey pepper chicken with Bacon...thick chunks of Bacon...Mac was super creamy...you would think the chicken pieces, as small as they were would be over cooked...But NOPE...Tender and Juicy with a great flavor....Mini cheese burger was devoured by our granddaughter...We are both a ""Bang for your Buck"" Yelpers, and both of our entrees were just over $12 each...it was truly worth it...Are they on the Radar...Yes..Yes they are.."
Michael G.,"Beaverton, OR",25,9,2,1.0,12/31/2017,Raw chicken is never acceptable. Good service. Food is cheap for a reason. Wait staff is super friendly and took our order quickly.
Fabian S.,"Conroe, TX",0,1,,1.0,1/2/2018,"Service super slow super slow. Is like  10 Tables in the restaurant and only 2 waiters on the floor, service super slow."
Shalyn W.,"Monterey Park, CA",447,30,45,1.0,12/14/2017,"Why are people smoking inside the restaurant???? I can't breathe in here. Im literally eating and smelling the smoke. Probably will never be back. The food here was eh... it wasn't that good. The boneless chicken wing looked and tasted like it has been out waiting. The server seemed a little bit too tired or a bit off. So every time I would ask for something, he would forget and it wasn't busy or anything. It was around 1-2 AM."
David V.,"Keller, TX",113,347,861,4.0,11/6/2016,"3.77 stars. I don't usually dine in at big chain restaurants, not sure why... Rarely crave American casual dining, I guess, sounds bad, but don't really have an appetite for it. Chilis, TGIF, etc. Today stopped by because they were the only ones still open around 12 at night close to the airport. The server made the experience alittle more pleasant.  I had the chicken tenders platter. It was pretty good. You can't really go wrong with chicken tenders. Came with French fries and cole slaw. It was a great meal. It was so big, I probably ate 3 days worth of food.  The one thing I don't like was the smoking in the bar area. You could smell it in the dining room. I thought they banned smoking indoors...  And also the new iPad ordering device at the table. Never been a fan of electronics at the table, especially if it does the job of the server.  Overall your typical casual dining experience. Great for hanging out with friends. Average typical dining"
Armeen A.,"Chicago, IL",0,16,7,1.0,12/22/2016,"Just went to this Applebee's and had the worst experience ever! To start off, when we walked in they gave us a hard time because they had to accommodate our party of 6! Then, we get seated and it takes 15 mins for a server to come out to take our drink orders. We then waited an additional twenty mins for someone to come out to take our order because they were confused with about the order we placed through the tablet... (quick tip: if you're confused, just come ask is! Don't take 15 minutes to try and figure out why we ordered on the tablet.. if you don't know how to use this type of technology, eliminate it.) Once the order is placed, the food starts to come out one by one. One group received their order and the rest of the table waited thirty mins to get their order. When the food came out it was cold. It came out one by one every five mins.  We get our final two orders on the table and the wings are uncooked!!! With barely any sauce!!!! The manager came out and without even introducing herself, she threw in our face that she was comping half of the meal (at this point she didn't even know about the raw chicken) and instead of apologizing, she gave us an attitude and acted as if she was doing us a favor by comping half our meal! It's not always about the money. It's about how the situation was handled."
Carol E.,"Arlington, TX",13,36,2,1.0,7/9/2017,"Immediately walked inside and it reeked of cigarette smoke,  and visibly I could only see 1 smoker. There was nowhere to sit that could escape the smell. The waitress was nice. My friend and I wanted to split a 2 for $20, while ordering I asked if I could get the burger,  without pickles or bacon, she says the patties already come frozen with the pickles and bacon combined inside the patty so it couldn't be removed. Frozen prepackaged patties??!! EW! I asked if I could substitute it for the classic burger (which is cheaper) they said no. My friend then ordered a sangria, it was a cup filled to the brim with large chunks of ice, in 2 sips it was gone. That's terrible, needless to say I won't be returning to Applebees any time soon."
Jim P.,"Grapevine, TX",1,44,8,4.0,7/13/2016,"Another new menu!  After navigating thru 2 new menus I settled on the Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken dish. The dish wash a "" lite"" meal with 570 calories. Very tasty with  Granny Smith apple relish with cucumbers, rice, cranberries, very lightly honey glazed pecans, and quinoa. Very tasty and enjoyable. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the plate presentation was perfect.  Recommendation for the environment: complete the buildout of the eating space to separate the bar area smokers from the dinning area.  The dinning area smells like a smokey bar.  I will not return if not corrected. And the benches need upgraded."
Bryan B.,"Katy, TX",0,8,2,2.0,8/23/2017,"I was in Dallas on business and this Applebees was within walking distance of my hotel.  The food was definitely nothing to talk about. The spinach dip was burned, the chips were crumbs, and the salmon and steak was mediocre at the very best (that's probably being nice).  The bar area also allows smoking so the entire place reeks of stale nasty cigarette smoke.  We asked to sit at the very back of the restaurant away from the bar which helped slightly with the smell, but not completely.  The two stars are purely for their all day happy hour deals they had.  Very good drink deals and the drinks were actually pretty good! My advice, go full, and order a liquid diet."
Chris M.,"Sherrills Ford, NC",46,7,,1.0,4/10/2017,Worst experience ever at Grapevine location. Manager Kendall is an embarrassment to food service and needs to learn how to talk to customers.
Mike P.,"Dallas, TX",1,1,,2.0,2/27/2017,"We came here for dinner because of a coupon we got in the mail. We won't be back. This place is obviously understaffed. The hostess was also required to bus tables, which means she wasn't around when we showed up. There was a 20 minute wait, even though the restaurant was only about half full. The hostess seemed unorganized and didn't really seem to have a system for who was next. The bar, which is right beside the waiting area, allows smoking, which fills the waiting area with smoke. There were several parties ahead of us, and most of them left before their table was called. Food was meh. Sever was friendly. My wife did enjoy their $2 margaritas, so that's something. :)"
Lisa B.,"Dallas, TX",20,18,34,1.0,9/18/2016,"We ordered food to go. When we got home more than half the order was missing.  Since it wasn't close to the house and the kids were hungry we opted not to go back and instead asked for credit on the missing items.  They said it was too complicated to do a refund.  I ordered the grilled chicken it was nothing like the description.  I've posted a picture of their menu item and what I received.  The menu item indicated grilled chicken, quinoa and rice, cranberries , Granny Smith apples and pecans.  I received grilled chicken and rice with apples.  I will never go there again or recommend any of my friends to go there."
J D.,"Burleson, TX",1,72,2,1.0,6/6/2017,This place is disgusting! So damn dirty I wanted to go home and shower. Stopped in for a couple drinks while waiting a pick up at the airport. Thank god all I had were drinks. The bathroom was awful dirty. There was excrement on the toilet seat. I thought about telling management but then realized the place is so gross they probably wouldn't care. I wouldn't eat here if it were my last meal on earth.
Rasha S.,"North Richland Hills, TX",51,5,,1.0,4/22/2017,"Was not impressed. The restaurant smelt like it needed a good cleaning. People were smoking cigarettes in the bar and it was trailing out to the eating area. My husband and I ordered off the lunch menu. My chicken salad wrap had a few pieces of chicken and the rest of it was lettuce. My husbands club sandwich looked like a grilled cheese with a tomato. His mac n cheese chicken side was disgusting. Overall bland, and unimpressive. Will not be back to this Applebee's or any Applebee's ever again"
Steve K.,"CORTLANDT MNR, NY",56,525,1726,3.0,10/24/2015,"Stopped in for a Perfect Margarita and bar appetizers of Tortilla Soup and Caesar Salad. Tasty bar food in small portion, perfect for a snack. Soup was just warm from the microwave, and probably needed another 30 seconds. Its location is convenient to the gazillion hotels in the Grapevine area. Good value at the bar. And excellent brewskies selection on draught. Like a sports bar, abundant TVs I stop in Applebee's occasionally when traveling, and the Grapevine Applebee's is better than most. My experience was much better than the other reviews. Not being from Texas, I am unfamiliar with the law. Regardless, I was surprised to see smoking in any place that serves food. Texas is Texas and loves its freedoms, including the freedom to smoke."
Krystal T.,"Fort Worth, TX",32,14,1,1.0,12/10/2016,This is the worst Applebee's I haven't encountered. Our poor server Zack was working his tail off but the cooks messed up our order. How do you mess up nachos?! The heavy set African American woman was just too rude. You can tell there over worked and understaffed. I won't be back. Steak n Shake has better service than this!
Mark A.,"Keller, TX",0,4,,1.0,4/20/2016,"We went for a late lunch (missed the lunch rush if there even is one).  The smell of stale cigarette smoke greets you in the closed-in foyer and doesn't get much better even on the restaurant side.  Not very appetizing.   We waited at the front for the host/hostess to seat us.  After looking around to see if anyone besides the bartender was working, the manager came from around the back part of the bar to bring us to our table.  He couldn't have cared less that we were there or were looking for someone to seat us.  He slowly sauntered like we had all day...because he clearly had all day and no sense of urgency or hospitality.   Our server was pleasant and took our order right away when she arrived.  Our iced teas were slow to the table.  The soup & salad wasn't there after more than 10 minutes.  The restaurant was nearly empty.  We were hoping for quick service and ordered appropriately.   The manager (who returned to his post at the back of the bar) saw me trying to get his attention 3 times and didn't make any effort to talk to me until I got up and walked toward him.    I let him know that we were waiting for our food and thought that the soup would come out just a bit faster than 10+ minutes in an empty restaurant.  He went back to check and our order came out in just another few minutes.   The person that delivered our lunch was not our server.  After she loudly dropped the plates down, she immediately huffed off and said, ""YOU'RE WELCOME!"", before we even had a chance to say, ""Thank You.""  Her passive-aggressive, pissy attitude was not appreciated after the series of bad experiences up until that point.  She could have saved the experience with a good attitude instead of what we received from her.   I called the manager back over from his assigned post and he didn't care one bit.  He could clearly tell I was upset about how we were just treated.  He said he would go talk to her.  Then, a few minutes later, she came back past our table snapping her fingers and dancing with a big smile on her face.     We won't be back..."
Matt C.,"Farmersville, TX",0,3,,1.0,8/13/2017,"The smell of smoke is overwhelming in this restaurant. Reminds me of a seedy bar. Not impressed at all. If you have the chance to eat there, skip it."
Matthew M.,"Mooresville, NC",0,1,,1.0,4/10/2017,Worst I have ever been treated by any management in the food industry in my life. Applebees needs to get rid of the manager Kendall before I ever go to another Applebees ever again.
Marty S.,"Carrollton, TX",0,4,,3.0,10/14/2016,"Food and service are awesome, Brandon was our waiter he was fantastic!  But I will never come back due to the fact smoking is allowed in the bar in Grapevine.  I'm an exsmoker and it makes this place smell horrible."
Sharen M.,"Matteson, IL",0,3,1,1.0,4/3/2016,If I could give this restaurant a half star I will. Customer service was HORRIBLE!!! Did I say it was HORRIBLE!! Water tastes like dirt! Had to request utensils after salad was brought to the table. Server (Tiffany) took our order and didn't write it down...of course it came out incorrect! We had to flag her down anytime we needed something. Fries were old and cold. Riblets were cold! Don't waste your time!! There are several other restaurants in the area that knows how to treat customers and would be more appreciative of you visiting their establish to spend your hard earned money!!!! I'm disgusted and appalled about the service we received today!!! Maybe I need to write a letter to corporate also!! Uggghhh!!
Olivia E.,"Fort Worth, TX",233,123,1547,3.0,3/31/2015,This Applebee's is nicer than most Applebee's that I've been too. For the price you pay the food is good. 2 for $25 includes an Appitizer and 2 entrees. Wish dessert was included in the deal. Service was good when we went. I would go back.
Jarrod H.,"Grapevine, TX",12,7,2,1.0,11/18/2016,Ordered car side to go.... waited 10 minutes and no one came out.... went inside and they informed they don't do carside to go despite the website allowing it.... then order was 20 minutes beyond promised time.... not happy..
Bill M.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/19/2016,"Oh My God...where do i start ? This is the nastiest applebees ever !! come on its 2016 Cut the cigarette b.s IT STINKS , they keep changing the crappy menu to try to gather more customers , well its not working food is garbage , service is not friendly NOT EVEN WORTH ONE STAR :("
Traveling P.,"San Antonio, TX",1,37,62,5.0,9/19/2016,"Everything changed, the menu and the flavor on everything, I only tried one dish the smash potato beef with gravy in it and French onions... Wow! It's a big WOW!"
Kishen R.,"Colleyville, TX",1,4,,5.0,11/6/2016,These guys are amazing. I always come back to this place. The host always opens the door for everyone when they are leaving and the waiters go beyond. Great establishment.
Amy N.,"Broadway District, Portland, OR",203,15,9,5.0,8/19/2016,"Compared to all the other Applebee's I've been to this is my favorite one. Our waitress was very nice and on top of everything. Checked in with us at just the right times, brought our checks without us having to ask and right when we needed them. Loved the music they were playing and all our food was good!"
Dominic C.,"Flower Mound, TX",283,850,169,3.0,11/25/2015,Applebee's is decent for a late night snack and a few drinks. That's because nothing else better is open. I wouldn't eat here any other time. The food is just reheated blah that every chain does. The drinks could be stronger. Service at the bar was good.
Barbara O.,"Colleyville, TX",0,1,,1.0,11/25/2016,"We ordered well done hamburgers.  When the waitress brought them out, the inside was like raw meat ... we sent them back.  Our french fries were supposed to be unsalted; they were not. The waitress spilled an entire glass of tea on my son-in-law's plate.  We spent fifty dollars on horrible food and service, and the manager said ""I'm sorry about that""!  We won't go back!"
Sarah L.,"Grapevine, TX",141,42,61,4.0,9/4/2015,"I'm surprised at all the negative comments on the service, We've been here twice and both times our service was great-Very friendly and prompt. Our server, Brendon, was awesome. I accidentally left the lid to my daughters bottle on the floor and he ran out to the parking lot and gave it to us as we were about to pull out.  He very easily could have left it for a busser to trash.  They have a great Caesar salad and the honey BBQ sauce on the ribs was very tasty. Just the right amount of sweet.  I'm not going to lie, the billows of smoke can really put damper on anyones dinner. If they are going to allow smoking it should be at least a semi closed off area. We noticed at least two tables walk in with a disgusted look on their face and ask to be seated further away from the smoking section (sorry, there is no escaping it). If someone walks in and is accosted by smoke, I can only imagine how their experience just snowballs from there. 5 star service 4 star food 1 star ambiance"
Andrea R.,"Tulsa, OK",0,2,,1.0,8/22/2016,"Walked in to the smell of stale cigarette smoke, sat down and the smoke got worse. Turned around and walked right out. Why is smoking still allowed I restaurants?"
T R.,"Grapevine, TX",0,1,,1.0,2/17/2017,I give this place 1 star because that's the min. If I could give it negative I happily would. It reeks of stale cigarettes and somehow still allows smoking.
Judy H.,"Grapevine, TX",0,3,1,2.0,8/18/2016,Car side to go order that I had to go in and get. This is the salad I ordered. Horrible lettuce and the meat was so tough I couldn't even pull it apart with my teeth. The restaurant smelled of old fish. Will be hard to go back to.
Lenora E.,"Spring, TX",117,16,18,2.0,4/29/2016,Tisha is an amazing server. She greeted us with an enthusiastic smile in spite of the fact that her Manager is an total and absolute unprofessional douche bag! We called over an hour ahead of time and we waited patiently only for him to pretty much tell us to go somewhere else. Large party of 20.....he hates money or he just hates to work. Perhaps he would do better on unemployment and welfare.
Robby G.,"Benton, LA",66,11,,5.0,7/26/2016,"Service was great, food was fresh,delicious,hot and served quickly.  Prices are very reasonable. Way better than Rainforrest cafe. Drinks never ran low. Will be back."
Rick Z.,"Dana Point, CA",18,26,,1.0,5/5/2016,"Went in for lunch today. Order iced tea and a salad and sandwich deal. Ice tea came right away and then crickets for 20 minutes. Manager walks by and I give him the death stare...he stops and says ""you been takin care of?""  I said I ordered 20+ minutes ago. He goes and checks my order and comes back and says ""we don't have your order...what did you want to eat?""  I sat there for a second in complete shock and then said later days dork and I'd get rid of that dip$hit that took my order if I were you!  Went to chick filet next door and it was probably a lot better anyways."
V1bram B.,"Fort Worth, TX",13,23,,2.0,7/10/2016,Stopped by for lunch after shopping at Grapevine.  we had Pretzels and wontons for half size apps. It was good and perfect portion size. Lunch we had Bourbon chicken and shrimp was great. My wife said her Fiesta Salad was lacking of all the ingredients but tasted ok. Mother in law liked her Shrimp stir fry and French onion soup. However speed of service by server Aleena was slower then what we are used to Applebee's.
Tiffany W.,"Austin, TX",5,29,3,4.0,4/18/2016,I went back a second time and sat in the bar - Reece was the server. He was great. Will def shoot you straight. Main bartender was slow. Good for sports games and one of the only places left you can smoke in the bar.
Veronica A.,"Springdale, AR",2,17,6,1.0,5/1/2016,"Our server was extremely nice and helpful. She told us where to seat and left to get few things only to have her manager yell... Loudly at our friends. Sadly that caused few other folks to walked out. They stopped by to speak with us and left, didn't even order their food. We thought it was pretty unprofessional. Our waitress was from another location but ask if we stay she will take care of us. Well we tipped her nicely for serving us. Unfortunately we will never come back here."
Jason S.,"Irving, TX",90,30,52,1.0,4/25/2015,"Bad service. Sat in at the bar and waited for a good minute for the bartender to even show up at the bar. When she did, she didn't come greet us or anything right away. We smiled and was friendly to her but she wasn't very approachable. We ordered 2 drinks and mind our own business. We noticed she paid more attention to the other patrons and not us as much. Another group of our friends showed up and then she became more attentive to us. But it was like she didn't want to deal with us as much.  But the worst part of the entire establishment is the smoking. I thought all eating establishments had a no smoking requirement. Guess this place is an exception. Cough cough...  Pass unless you smoke."
