Scott B.,"Keller, TX",25,219,15,1.0,3/13/2015,"Got seated and took forever to just get a waitress. When one did show, she was kind of rude and said they were in a meeting. Really? Who calls a server's meeting at 6:30pm on a Friday evening. Poor poor timing. No wonder Applebee's keeps going lower and lower. Oh well, we ended up at Love & War in Texas and we're seated and taken care of immediately."
Sharifa W.,"Grapevine, TX",23,26,2,2.0,12/13/2015,"It's not often we go to big chains like this here in Texas. But we were STARVING and it was close. Plus we wanted cocktails after going to the mall. But this was the WORST. I mean, the food was good. (Which is why I gave two stars instead of 1) but the service was so slow and food came out at a snails pace. My friend ordered a cup of soup and 30 minutes later the server came back after the rest of the food came and said that they were out of that soup. Had we known that right away, we would have just ordered a different soup. And that was after the server came back twice to double check that we had ordered soup. The cocktails were also sub par, I don't think there was actually any liquor in any of them. And at the end of the meal, the server had to change our checks a few times because she charged extra, didn't charge or forgot to remove things (the soup we didn't get)  Needless to say, we won't be back."
Jt S.,"Denton, TX",77,5,,1.0,4/24/2016,"This has to be one of the worst Applebee's that I have ever eaten at, and I have been to many.  We were there for dinner and they were out of ribs, the milkshake machines were broken, the bathrooms smelled like a back alley in New Orleans, and the food that we did get was cold.  Also, they allow smoking in the bar which is so close to the main eating area, the smoke was thick in there as well.  Not sure what is going on in the Grapevine area, but it is evident why the businesses over there are losing business.  I know I won't return."
Roman G.,"Irvine, CA",4,174,29,3.0,12/19/2015,I flew in late one evening and was staying at a hotel in Grapevine by the mall. There aren't a lot of restaurants open late but Applebee's advertises being open until 2am. I knew what I was expecting when it comes to food but I wasn't prepared for all the smokers in the restaurant. The bartender was very attentive and provided good service. Overall food 2.5 stars service 4 stars....smoke 1 star.
L M.,"Dallas, TX",1,29,5,1.0,3/7/2016,Awful service.....The smell of smoke made me sick...I'm came before 2pm people aren't allowed to smoke until 4:30 she said but it smelled like someone had just lit one.Worst location I've eve been too. It was very dusty and needed a good cleaning.
Mary B.,"Plano, TX",0,11,,1.0,9/18/2016,"Shelby was not very friendly, and a ghost.  The bathroom was dirty, no toilet paper and one toilet would not flush.  We saw more of the manager than our server.  Yet, the food was good."
Tracy S.,"Keller, TX",41,40,12,3.0,8/30/2015,Better than some locations I have been to. Somehow this restaurant chain is always slow and always understaffed. Too bad because the food is good.
Clyde J.,"Fort Worth, TX",10,5,,1.0,3/13/2015,"Very poor service and  no one seams to know what's going on. Food was ok, when my honey chicken 4 cheese was brought to the table I had to wait 10 minutes for the bread stick, who brings out a uncompleted dinner plate. I love Applebees and am so disappointed at this location as was many others on this day. I will never visit this location again."
Mary S.,"McKinney, TX",49,82,37,1.0,12/25/2015,Went to sit in their bar and order a few beers... waitress waited on a big crowd of people in front of us and laughed when I mentioned that we were waiting there first.  RUDE!
Patrik P.,"Albany, NY",69,67,113,2.0,10/15/2015,I go at Applebee's only because its open until 2: 00 am. Food quality is terrible. Some of servers are good at service but management of restaurant aren't professional at all. Menu pricing is very high on lower quality of food.
Chris M.,"Hurst, TX",2,5,2,1.0,7/10/2016,horrible  Terrible service walked in sat myself down didn't get Asked what I wanted to drink for five minutes and when I ordered my margarita the bartender told me they ran out of that Liqour and wouldn't have it until tomorrow so I went to the Bedford tx location where they did have what I needed I will never return to the Grapvine location horrible service
Jimmy W.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,4,,2.0,7/26/2015,"The food was pretty good. Its Applebees, what do you expect? But for the love of god, smoking at the bar? Immediately knew from the moment I stepped in the door I knew I'd never visit this specific Applebee's ever again."
Kevin G.,"Grapevine, TX",0,13,4,3.0,1/27/2016,Stopped in last Wednesday (1/20) for $1 Margaritas as they were advertised only to find out that location does not participate. Wish they didn't allow smoking in the bar.
Brenda G.,"Dallas, TX",423,16,18,5.0,7/17/2015,"Ding, dong the witch is dead! That is Bow Head! Lol OMG this use to be the worst place to go in Grapevine.   Now that the bar staff has changed this place is awesome!  Courtney was a Cocktail waitress and is awesome so everyone sat at her tables and bar was empty.  I am so happy to say she is now Bartending. She cares about her job and customers unlike the other Person.  Come see her please! Plus they are open late."
Maggie T.,"Southlake, TX",0,19,,1.0,6/13/2016,Horrible customer service .. Hostess did not smile once. Wait staff disappears often.
Jacqueline M.,"Coppell, TX",14,25,16,1.0,8/24/2014,"I have always disliked Applebee's but we had a gift card and wanted to avoid the heavy smoke at the Lewisville one.  Appetizer chicken wonton was good. Main course was really disappointing. I got the chicken penne, and it literally have five tiny slivers of grilled chicken on top. It wasn't enough to feed a small cat.  So I had to wait five minutes to hunt down our server to see if I could get more chicken on the side. She just said ""yeah"" and when she brought it she never said sorry or ""I hope this makes up for it."" Then I bite into it, and it was completely bland. Not even salt helped.  Oh, and we just got the bill, and they charged us $4 for extra chicken! I usually try to give people the benefit of the doubt and be positive and understanding.  At this point, I was fed up....I grabbed the bill, looked at it, and said ""Oh no, we are NOT paying for that! [chicken that should have been there from the beginning]."" The server saw my reaction and came over to say it was a mistake, and they would fix that.   NEVER AGAIN, underwhelming Applebee's!!"
Dirk N.,"Dallas, TX",0,637,144,2.0,7/3/2014,"Not a very good Applebee's location.  For starters, there's smoking (is that even legal in DFW?) and there's not good separation from the non-smoking area. That's great for pregnant women, like my wife... not. Second, service was terrible. It wasn't busy, yet our waiter seemed distracted the entire time, wasn't personable at all and was SLOW. He also said bacon wasn't included in the house salad (menu clearly stated it was), forgot the salad dressing and forgot the dipping sauce with our dessert. The food was mostly mediocre, except for the delicious dessert (salted caramel pretzel sticks with a delicious maple cream sauce).  We definitely won't be coming back."
Darin T.,"Southlake, TX",0,7,,1.0,6/13/2016,"The service and servers are on their on schedule, at the bar chatting it up.  Can't find the manager, do not recommend."
Traci G.,"Bedford, TX",75,60,6,1.0,8/22/2015,"Well, I was going to feel bad for posting a bad review until I saw the others.  First of all what the heck kind of restaurant still allows smoking?!?!?   Gross!! The hostess was rude, rude, rude.  The food was mediocre.   The one star is for our awesome server Antoinette, but she's normally at the las colinas location so we'll have to go check that one out instead."
Dustin B.,"Melbourne, Australia",991,382,259,2.0,12/26/2013,The food here is ok as is any Applebees. What i hate about this location is the smoking. No matter if you are in the non smoking or smoking you can still smell cigarette smoke.
