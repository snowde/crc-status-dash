KJ C.,"Highland Village, TX",15,57,23,1.0,1/5/2014,"Bar Fight! wtf was management doing!!!!!!??? Management let this ridiculous argument between two OBVIOUSLY intoxicated patrons get way out if hand. I way 100 pounds... So, when I have two fully grown ""men"" arguing and shoving 3 feet away from me I'm going to be concerned. For my safety. As a guest at this establishment, I should have never had to ask, tell, these men to knock it off!!! To top it off, large Marge AKA ""manager"" on duty, decides to try her best (sigh) and break it up. Too late mama!!! Where the heck were you earlier!? Bad management let two drunken A- Holes ruin the night for paying guests.  I can't see this smoke ridden DUMP staying open for much longer with current management.  No worries.  No loss.  It's Applebee's. Pfft next."
Jan F.,"Colleyville, TX",53,303,123,2.0,6/20/2012,"We were looking for a place to have a late breakfast after walking in Grapevine Mills one morning.   Seeing nothing better and nothing that was open, we noticed the Applebee's across the street with an ""Open"" sign, so in we went.  We were enthusiastically greeted and taken to our choice of seats. There was no one else there at such an early hour (about 10:30 AM), for good reason.  They don't serve anything close to something you might want to have for breakfast or even brunch.  So we had our 'lunch' early. We both opted for something off the Weight Watchers approved menu item list (we had been walking, after all!), both were OK. My Grilled Jalapeño Shrimp looked better to me than his Creamy Parmesan Chicken.  We both ate until there was nothing left to take home (we had been walking and it was late, OK?) With two iced teas, that in the beginning tasted like leftover tea, our bill came to almost $30 before a ""Golden Apple"" senior discount of 15%.  There are some advantages to being over 55.   But still, we felt that the cost was a bit too high for the food and the atmosphere. Service was friendly and adequate.  Iced tea refills were served warm, with no ice.  I noticed a Ranger calendar in the Ladies Room that was a few weeks outdated.   There is no good reason to return that I can come up with.  Two plus would probably be a better rating."
Christy I.,"Ewa Beach, HI",16,45,20,3.0,6/30/2015,Second time at Applebee's ...service was great! Atmosphere was clean. Waitress was very attentive! The food was a little too salty for my palate!
Jose M.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",0,6,2,4.0,6/26/2015,Came in for a quick late lunch on a Friday. Evan was my waiter and he helped me promptly (less that 5 minutes). Food came out (meat) just as I ordered. Overall this was a great customer service and good food.
M P.,"Lowell, MA",1,54,20,4.0,4/30/2015,"Good service at the bar for lunch, food was good, restaurant was clean, and it was close to the hotel.. Not sure why it go such a low rating earlier..."
Rob S.,"Grapevine, TX",0,5,,2.0,6/22/2015,"Bar area is okay, but dining in, that's a no. Been here 3 times and I will never dine in again. If I need a cold beverage, I'll sit in the bar. Food was cold, chips stale all 3 times."
Michelle B.,"The Colony, TX",43,17,,2.0,5/9/2015,I wish I looked at the reviews before I came here. Seating hostess is MIA. We had to wait to be seated and I just watched another family wait about 4 minutes. The place isn't crowded at all. Service is super slow. Still waiting for my son's drink to be refilled. Did I mention the restaurant isn't crowded? Like at all?
Nick C.,"Bellevue, NE",1,40,,4.0,7/30/2015,"Had the Cedar Salmon for lunch today and really enjoyed it. The bartender was very pleasant and service was excellent.  I haven't been a big fan of Applebee's in the past, but I like the new menu and recent experiences."
Melanie S.,"Dallas, TX",0,20,,1.0,4/2/2016,"Awful! We decided to give Applebee's another try after years of swearing them off. (New town, new state) after looking at the menu online before we went and after looking at the physical menu our server gave us, we ordered fried green beans. We were politely told that they had been discontinued. I was surprised they were giving out menus with food they don't even serve. (The menus had spring 2016 printed on them. It is the beginning of spring 2016) Our beer was flat. Nachos were cold and poor quality. The wings were disgusting. Actually, disgusting is an understatement. They were dry, hard to chew and way over sauced. We should have turned around and walked out as soon as we saw people smoking. First clue. Who allows smoking in restaurants anymore? It is official, we will NEVER eat at an Applebee's ever again."
Leslie D.,"Dallas, TX",131,28,6,1.0,10/15/2013,"Was the chicken undercooked or just unsanitary? Who cares?  Its been three days and I still feel like I've been kicked in the stomach.  I'm not going in to detail, if you've had food poisoning, you already know. I would give this place zero stars if I could, but since I have to give them one anyway, I'll let them have it because I've lost weight. So, if you would like to shortcut your diet and lose weight quickly, order the chicken green bean thing on the 2 for 20 menu.  It worked for me!"
A B.,"Lewisville, TX",0,17,,5.0,3/8/2016,Good drinks and half price apps.  Josh was a great bartender.  Very fast with a great personality.  We are new to the area and will definitely be going back.  One complaint is that it gets a little smokey in there.  It won't keep me from going back.
Elisa S.,"Grapevine, TX",0,3,,1.0,2/14/2016,This location is in serious need of a makeover. Grapevine use to allow smoking and it smells like they never did a cleanup after smoking was banned. The mirrors looked like they haven't been cleaned in months either. The tea tasted like instant mix and the food was bland.  Very disappointing.
Catlin M.,"Encinitas, CA",180,7,1,1.0,2/15/2016,"I'm not normally one to write reviews, but this place was unfortunately deserving of the one star.  Right when you walk in you are hit with a wall of smoke, I was planning on sitting down to eat so I  could get some work done, since I am in town on business, but the smell of smoke was unbearable I ended up getting my food to go. This is one of the few restaurants surrounded by several hotels and while waiting for my takeout I over heard several businessmen walk into the bar area and either ask to be seated in a nonsmoking section or leave. The bartender was nice and accommodating so I do not feel she is deserving of the one star by any means, but what surprised me was that the patrons in the restaurant that were smoking were also in Applebees uniforms, seemed they had just got off work. Applebees has always been a good reasonably priced place to eat when traveling, but moving forward I will have to rethink my options."
Kelli C.,"Edmond, OK",29,15,2,1.0,12/22/2013,"We were in town shopping at Grapevine Mills Mall and decided to go to Applebee's to appease all in our group. Upon arrival, you enter right into the bar area where it's obviously smoking.  No judgment to smokers, as I'm an ex smoker myself, but it was super smoky!  We went ahead and were seated quite a ways from the bar area.  Needless to say, when we finally made it home, we all noticed all of our new clothes we were proudly wearing smelled like smoke!  Come on Applebee's, it's called proper ventilation or 2013!  On top of that our food was eh.  Never again and I don't recommend at all."
Juliana C.,"Dallas, TX",4,8,6,1.0,6/9/2012,"worst experience ever!  My husband and I came here hoping to enjoy a nice lunch date, instead we couldn't get out of there any faster. Staff is horrible and service is worse. We ordered an appetizer to eat before our entrée and they never brought it to us, instead they gave it to the people sitting behind us. They didn't even realize their mistake until my husband asked them to remove it from our bill; they ended up giving the appetizer to our neighbors for free and their only way to compensate for their mistake was to continue to only apologize. On top of that we couldn't even enjoy our entrée because there was flies swarming our food every five seconds. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL!!!"
Dru M.,"Highland Village, TX",0,5,,5.0,8/26/2015,"Had a great early lunch. Everyone was attentive & friendly & the food was good. Upon leaving, my battery was dead. When I went back in to ask for someone to give me a jump, it seemed the whole staff went over & above to help. The manager & a gentleman from the kitchen, who just got off, went out of their way to help me. I was very impressed. You can't always get that kind of service today."
Teresa K.,"Southlake, TX",112,210,26,4.0,12/4/2013,"Not very busy on a Friday at 11:45a. Not always a good sign , but service and food was good . so i'll be back"
Clara S.,"Grand Prairie, TX",8,2,,1.0,2/20/2014,"Very slow on a Wednesday... Bar was packed but the dining room had 3 tables. I had to wait 5 minutes to be seated... Not even by the hostess... The busy bartender seated me. Then I set my timer and waited 2minutes and 53 seconds before getting up and leaving. I have never walked out on a restaurant, without even being greeted. Can't even greet me within the 90 second  sit down time. That's ridiculous. Off to another place for late lunch. Lousy service. Will NOT return."
Shashawn W.,"Lewisville, TX",119,205,34,1.0,12/3/2012,"The service was unacceptable. When we arrived there was not a wait and the restaurant was not very busy. The server took forever to take our order for drinks and food. He was not very accommodating or friendly. When our order arrive our server did not check to see if we were okay and needed anything else. I was really disappointed in the service at this Applebee's. Our food was luke warm when it arrived. He was very quick to run our cards so he could settle us out.. Overall, the experience was not pleasant. The restaurant was clean and we even had to get the hostess to help us get refills on our drinks."
Haley K.,"North Richland Hills, TX",67,530,71,5.0,1/18/2013,"I actually had a very good experance at this applebee's resturant. We went after a birthday party my daughter had attended so we were all worn out and tired. We got sat right away in a booth, the girls up front even gave my daughter extra crayons. The server was really nice and stayed on top of everything. My husband said his food wasn't the best ... some sort of steak something which living in the land of a million stake places its hard to beat the nice steak places when it is a chain such as this resturant ... but wasn't as bad as it could have been. My daughter had mac & cheese and it wasn't gross! Which almost anytime she gets it somewhere I roll my eyes cause I know she will say its not like what I make at home but it wasn't bad. I was excited because my fries had very little pepper on them which when we go to other applebee's they are usually so peppered I can't eat them. The tenders I ended up eatting were not fatty/gressy as chicken tenders can get at bulk preped places and I ended up eatting 3-4 of them when I normally stop at 1-2. We will for sure keep this place in"
