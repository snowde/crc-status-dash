Joshua T.,"North Richland Hills, TX",99,84,,2.0,7/8/2013,Went for lunch with a friend and the food was ok. Nothing special. The waitress was pretty slow to refill my drink. Like 10 mins from when she said she would refill it
Deni G.,"Allen, TX",1,28,3,3.0,12/30/2014,"I've never been a fan of Applebee's. But decided to give it a try at this location, despite the low reviews. (Someone in our group had gift cards.)all the ones I've been in feel dark and run down, this location was no exception. Yes, the smoke smell was unappetizing. I ordered a steak, usually don't because I'm usually disappointed, again no exception here. Taste was ok, but I ordered it medium rare. It came more rare, which was ok except that it was not cooked right. It had the 'seer marks' but the rest was an unappetizing grey color. The salad I had was fine, the potatoes and mixed veggies were good. The service was pretty good. There for I gave the review a 3, since I would have giving it a 2."
Janna M.,"Irving, TX",76,15,3,4.0,7/27/2012,"Have gone here for lunch several times.  Love this place because it is hardly ever busy at lunch time so we are able to get in and out in no time.  The food is always delicious and service is great too.  The manager, a cute blonde man, is always walking around making sure everyone is ok and enjoyed their food. Had the mini burgers today and they were off the chain!  Way better than Chilis sliders. Also the fries are really good too."
