Erik L.,"Fayetteville, NC",70,93,150,3.0,11/11/2017,"I guest today is the day of trying different places that I have not eaten at for a while. My shrimps were very good, so good that I ate more than i wanted. The food was not bad just that our hostess was very busy she spent less time with us. My wife and son ate the pork chop and it was missing the Apple sauce so it made it dry."
Carol S.,"Harlem, GA",5,8,,5.0,11/19/2017,"My husband and I eat at this location fairly often and could not be more pleased. The food is delicious and service is fast. I can't neglect thanking our server, Kelly, who gave us the best service. The manager, Savin Hall, was so accommodating and went out of his way to make our visit a 10+. I would and have recommended this location. The service has always been top notch, the food is always delicious and the prices are fairly reasonable!"
Kamari J.,"Atlanta, GA",0,6,13,5.0,6/15/2017,"I have been going for a while now. I normally order to go or eat inside. The food is good, I love the steaks there. I always get it medium well. Sometimes it's medium well and others times it was well done. But overall it was good.  The service is great. Everyone is nice. I am always greeted when I enter the restaurant by the host. Carl and Amber are 2 great servers there. I always have a pleasant experience."
Lady N.,"Decatur, GA",8,149,135,3.0,3/23/2017,"It's Applebee's. Food wise, what do you expect?  Anyway, the appetizer nachos are big enough to make into a meal. They had a special for the steak, salad and two sides for 9.99. I got it. The server was awesome explaining the drinks and specials. Food came out fast and was served with a smile and nice conversation. didn't have to ask for refills. May return in the future to see how consistent they are."
Daniel H.,"Augusta, GA",62,96,177,5.0,4/25/2015,"As i read the reviews for my favorite Grovetown restaurant I am forced to see if i am missing something, nope this Applebee's is still excellent.    On my last visit my steak was cooked perfectly.  My food arrived so quickly I thought the server had made a mistake and was attempting to give me someone else's meal.  I was wrong and my food was great. In my opinion this the best Applebee's inthe CSRA."
Sandra S.,"Grovetown, GA",36,69,582,4.0,2/18/2016,"Decided to drop in for an appetizer and night cap.  To my surprise it was karaoke night hosted by Mr. Koach The music, singers and atmosphere was hypnotic.  My drop in turned into an evening of enjoyable entertainment. This will be the spot for girls night out.  Hope to see you there Saturdays from 9 pm to mid-night."
Kayla B.,"Augusta, GA",0,1,,1.0,8/31/2017,"This is the third time in a row that our service at this Applebee's location has been terrible. The first two times our orders were messed up and the managers were nice enough to take the messed up food off the bill. Tonight however was a complete disaster. Our server, Nia, was not attentive at all and forgot to bring a water despite being asked twice. She stood and chatted with another table for over twenty minutes without checking on us, giving us refills, or checking on our food. Our food was barely warm when it reached the table a good 45 minutes after we ordered. My steak was way over cooked and when we asked to speak to a manager, she acted like she could care less. The one thing that saved our visit was we were given  a different server named Richard, who was fantastic. We have had him before and from now on, we will request him. He was great for the last 15 minutes of our visit and received a well deserved tip. My advice however is to stay away from this location. We were not even offered a slight discount for the terrible service and the subpar food. It's well worth the drive into Evans, where the service is much better."
Joel C.,"Augusta, GA",0,19,55,4.0,9/2/2016,"We came in and were immediately greeted/seated by the friendly staff. Our server was very friendly and helpful. The restaurant was clean and food came well-prepared. I've had a bad experience with Applebee's in the past. This visit erased that. We ordered the combo appetizer plate, pretzels, and garlic fries. All were delicious. We'll come back."
Paris N.,"Evans, GA",84,89,136,2.0,10/26/2016,"Hmm.. Well. Its a chain. I shouldn't have expected much. I live out of state and never visit these sort of places but my family wanted to.  First off, I have a dairy allergy and I no longer eat meat. So this was a challenge here. The only thing I could eat was a salad. Oh yay! I could've stayed home for that. I asked for the Oriental salad with out shrimp. Nowhere on the menu did it say it had cheese in it. Well it did. But it was like thrown in, so not a lot. But I still has to pick it out. Or I would have been very sick.  Then our little waitress girl was nice, but kept forgetting everything. That's ok, she's probably new. But the people behind us got her extra care. That's fine. Places like this need to understand not everyone can eat dairy or likes to eat meat. Not one vegetarian or vegan option available. Never again will I visit this chain. And if I family wants to, I'll just go for the company.  Thanks for being like every other drone-like restaurant in the South. Whoop!"
Kelvin B.,"Grovetown, GA",16,1,,1.0,2/5/2017,"I will NEVER go to this Applebee's again. Ordered my kids food first so they could eat first. Didn't happen. They had to wait 40 min for their food just like we did. Not only did we have to wait, the food was cold when it arrived I talk to the manager and she apologized and offered a free dessert. I thought she was joking. I told her we were leaving. Not many places to eat in Grovetown so I guess they feel their standards can be low and still receive business. We'll they won't get mine again."
Ray P.,"Evans, GA",29,29,,2.0,1/27/2016,"It's an Applebee's, so expect what you'd expect at any other Applebee's. The service was just ok. At one point I had to flag down my server to get a refill on my drink. Nothing really stands out. My steak was ordered medium rare, and it came out medium-to-medium-well as usual. For some reason, no chain restaurant can cook a steam medium rare. Even when their menu has very distinct descriptions for what medium rare is supposed to look like, the over cook it every time.  I will say, they LOVE their air conditioning. That thing was on full blast and we literally stopped when we walked in the door from the arctic blast. We debated actually turning around and leaving it was so freakin cold. But, since we were there (and it was our first time at the ""new"" Applebee's) we went ahead and were seated. The entire time we were literally shivering. I looked around to see if we were under an AC vent, or had accidentally been seated in the freezer, but other than icicles hanging off the end of our table, nothing stood out to explain the arctic temperature. If you're looking for an Applebee's, this is one. Personally, I wish we had driven the extra 100 feet and gotten sandwiches at Jersey Mike's. That place is delicious and you dont need a parka while you wait. As a matter of fact, I'm gunna go review Jersey Mike's now."
Jody W.,"Conway, SC",0,5,1,5.0,12/4/2016,"Out of town for work. Stopped in for lunch. Ordered the Sirloin and had the Pecan Blondie. Food was great, waitress was just the right amount of friendly.   Will definitely be back next time I'm in the area..."
Lauren M.,"Southside, Jacksonville, FL",52,2,,4.0,5/29/2017,"Our waitress, April, was very friendly and very helpful. Our food came fast and very good. The hostess also was very nice."
Alex M.,"Peterborough, United Kingdom",27,7,1,2.0,2/19/2016,"Yesterday some friends and I went to Applebee's for dinner. Let's just say the dinning experience did not justify its cost. Walking through door we were greeted (well... actual we weren't even acknowledged at first) by lackluster hosts struggling to seat a few people in a half empty restaurant.  Our waitress was thankfully an improvement but the kitchen staff weren't helping her out as the appetizers arrived with the main meals and the simple request for sauce on the side was not met (but she caught the mistake and sent the plate back). The overall atmosphere of the staff was rather unkept and needing some adult supervision. With other similar reviews of this place, I hope the levels will take notice to provide some emergency training. I don't want people to lose their jobs, but I be embarrassed to bring others there again."
Misty A.,"Grovetown, GA",46,78,157,3.0,5/24/2016,Food is great. As long as you order from the bar you're o.k.. But you guys could use better servers. Or some additional training for the ones you have. BAD SERVICE could over ride GOOD FOOD.
Andrya D.,"Grovetown, GA",40,10,4,3.0,8/16/2015,"This is a standard Applebee's.  The decor is clean and staff was average.  Nothing makes this one stand out over the other ones.  It's convenient for us and it's my son's favorite chain.  I give the chain huge thumbs up for trying to actually upgrade their menu.  Everything I've tried off the new menu, such as the salsa verde nachos, maple bacon chicken piadini, clubhouse grill, sriracha shrimp, are all good...but nowhere near good for you.  I think their under 600 cal menu is seriously lacking in flavor and quality.   I'd like to see something healthy, in a decent portion size, that isn't a salad."
Paul M.,"Grovetown, GA",0,18,1,2.0,10/24/2016,"The food at this location is truly a hit or miss.  I have received very good burgers and pasta dishes, but on the flip side I have received over cooked and returnable dishes (something I seldom do).  Bar has the common beer and liquors on hand, the staff is courteous for the most part.  My two star rating is based on the inconsistency in the food preparation."
Peter L.,"Grovetown, GA",11,12,60,4.0,6/4/2015,I always get great service friendly and courteous staffs. The food is average but I'd give them 4 stars because of the good service. The bartenders are very nice.
Robert N.,"Grovetown, GA",1,29,10,1.0,3/17/2016,Ate here a few times and it's a clean place with friendly staff. But the food ID hit and miss on taste and well I don't think I ever have left overs from here
John AndLaura C.,"Thomson, GA",3,12,5,4.0,2/29/2016,"Ate here for the first time 2/28/16, and my wife and l were pleased with our meal. I had the Loaded Brisket Enchiladas, while my wife had a rack of Chilpotle ribs. Both meals were full of flavor and were served in a very timely manner. Our appetizer, the Sampler, was delicious as well. Our server, April, was very sweet and pleasant and very efficient. We would definitely eat here again."
A M.,"Grovetown, GA",0,9,9,1.0,8/12/2016,Poor service. Been here about 3 times and it took forever to get the waiter to even acknowledge us. The service was slow the entire night to a not even packed restaurant. The last time it was only 2 other tables on our side and we didn't get asked for drink for 20minutes. We walked out and that was out last time ever going. Sad that it's only one of the few restaurants Grovetown has.
Audri P.,"Grovetown, GA",106,171,74,1.0,7/5/2014,Horrible service.  The food is mediocre at best.  We waited over an hour to be seated and then waited another hour for our food to arrive.   Unacceptable.   The staff are nice but the wait times are what makes the service BAD.  Went here once & won't be returning.
Eazey A.,"Augusta, GA",1,41,2,1.0,1/29/2015,"I thought it nothing less than appropriate to write this review as I sit in a Carside ToGo spot for 18 minutes and counting. Like, really Applebee's? The purpose of calling in an order is so that the customer doesn't have to wait, and wait staff doesn't have to serve. But here we are, 20 minutes later...and still counting. F-A-I-L."
Bryan G.,"Springville, AL",0,3,,1.0,2/10/2016,"Poor experience today. Service was bad to the point of having to get my own silverware, not getting refills on my drinks or taking a long time to pay the bill. The restaurant is new and clean but need help with the servers. Hopefully can they resolve the issue."
Britt S.,"Grovetown, GA",1,2,,1.0,2/27/2016,"Tried to give this place a chance, support Grovetown businesses so more will come.  Horrible service, especially during lunch time.  Too many bad experiences, will NEVER come back!"
Maria L.,"Evans, GA",1,14,,1.0,12/22/2014,"Customer service was extremely slow.  We ordered appetizers and there were no plates or utensils brought out at the time.  By the time they were brought out, we had already finished our appetizers.  The main courses came separately vice at once.  Overall the wait between requests was a 10-15 min wait.  We could see the frustration on other customers waiting for their drinks and food as well. There was no waiting line and the place was not packed.  Quality of food was poor.  The burger was small and the grilled chicken tasted like it was first boiled then thrown on the grill for grill marks."
Kadence B.,"Grovetown, GA",0,3,,1.0,2/1/2016,So a while ago I came here with my parents and the waitress we had was TERRIBLE. I don't remember her name but they should have fired her. After a while I came here again with my great granny and we saw that lady again and she was carrying plates. Now you might think that carrying plates can't really be messed up but it can. She had a little container with mustard or something that was yellow and it was spilling all down the row and my granny spotted it and told her about it. I really hope she doesn't work there any more. Also at this Applebees it seems like they pay attention to one side while the other is basically left in the dust. My dad said that next time we come here we are sitting on the side that gets more attention. We have never dat on that side and I'm ready to go back and writer a new review and hopefully it will be five stars. And I'm gonna guess that if when we go on the other side and if we still get terrible service we are never going there again. I love Applebees but they have terrible service.  Please fix EVERYTHING
Richard M.,"Thunderbird Heights/Wilmot Desert Estate, Tucson, AZ",17,2,,1.0,7/11/2014,"Service was extremely poor. Food wasn't bad, not perfect. The wait staff seemed very confused. The manager was unkept in his dress appearance. He never came thru the restaurant to see how things were going. I never saw him once. It took 10 minutes before a waiter showed up then it took 45 minutes from the time we sat to when received our food. The manager did compensate our check for the bad service. I won't go there again unless it's just for drinks."
Sarah A.,"Augusta, GA",98,10,6,1.0,5/11/2014,"When Applebee's was coming to Grovetown, I was pretty excited. I was so wrong.  We've come here a few times in hopes that it'll be better than the past times, and it never is.  THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE.  We have waited over an hour to get our food every time we've come here, and when it finally arrives, it is beyond disappointing. As an example, last time I got the avocado and strawberry salad, which was supposed to come with grilled chicken on a bed of romaine and arugula. I got a couple strawberry slices and a couple chunks of avocado and a piece of avocado skin with rubbery chicken on a bed of spinach that was clearly very old (read: wilted). Ugh. It seems like there's a problem with the kitchen, because the serving staff seems more than competent, not to mention friendly. And usually the manager come out and apologizes and gives us a free app or discount or fronts our meal.  So pretty much every time we come it's a 2.5-4 hour ordeal and we get free food.  I'd honestly pay to just go in, have a good experience and decent food brought out the first time, and get out. But this place just won't let that happen."
Joey Y.,"Grovetown, GA",18,43,40,3.0,2/18/2015,"I reviewed this location about eight months ago and was not all that impressed, but I have tried it a couple more times since that last review and I have to admit things have gotten a little better the service was always pretty good the waiting staff was always friendly and the restaurant is clean. they have a new system now where you can order your food and pay your bill right at your table if you choose to do so I thought this was very convenient   And from a security standpoint to your credit or debit card never leaves your hands. I still kind of have mixed feelings about this pay and or order at your table,but it is the sign of the times so I am trying to embrace this new idea at Applebee's I would definitely give this location I'll try things are getting a whole lot better especially during the lunch hour. Just goes to show things can improve with just a little effort. The new items on the menu are pretty good and to my surprise this time they did come out hot instead of just warm so give this location a try just as I did I gave them a second chance I don't think you'll be disappointed."
Lionel S.,"Grovetown, GA",0,9,2,2.0,7/16/2015,"The first time we went here, it recently opened (a few months or so) and we had a gift card.  Fortunately, we didn't have to pay for the experience. I was hoping that all the new store hiccups were settled but that hadn't happened quite yet. The second time we went my wife didn't want to stay because of what she saw while she was on her way to the restroom.  Apparently it was something nasty.  Note - she is not a stickler for cleanliness so I must have been bad.  Unfortunate...  Hope operations improve.  This could really be an awesome location."
Aron K.,"Harlem, GA",1,2,,1.0,6/16/2014,"You'd think one Applebee's would be just like any other but in the case of the Grovetown location you'd be way off. Probably one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had, from being seated to out the door. Poor wait staff, poorly cooked food, and an overall dirty place considering its brand new. Not sure what's gone wrong here but they'd have to pay ME to ever try this location again."
