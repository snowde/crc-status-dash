The Critical J.,"Cresskill, NJ",64,94,,4.0,7/26/2017,"PROS: They have the friendliest wait staff you'll meet. They're clean, there's a lot to choose from on the menu, the prices are good, and there are tablets by every table to play games on and to check your meal out. The servers are knowledgeable about the food, and they have an open bar with many tvs for the game. They even hire the mentally handicapped for bus boy positions, that way they can gain some work experience. I think that's very nice of them. CONS: Applebees is very slow at bringing out your food. Also, when they're busy, they don't turn over tables fast enough which causes the waiting time for people coming in to increase. Another thing that I don't like is that they don't check up on you regularly. My glass was starting to collect dust before my server asked if I wanted another one. OVERALL: This is a great Applebees to go to. Many of their pros are the same as with any Applebees, and if your willing to overlook a few of their cons, I think you'll enjoy it."
Margo A.,"Matawan, NJ",189,3,,1.0,1/4/2018,"I came to this Applebee's with my boyfriend on a snowy day. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant. The host was laying down on the waiting area on his phone. He finally realized we were there after a few minutes and then sat us. After, our waitress came by and I asked her if we could wait till 10pm to order the half off apps (it was 9:50pm). She then said that they can't ""give up a table"" and she rolled her eyes. She sent the manager over and he was very unclear and said ""we don't normally wait, can't do nothing about it now"". Me and my boyfriend decided to get up and leave because not only was it extremely unprofessional, but we felt awkward."
Nico L.,"Paramus, NJ",87,1,1,4.0,9/27/2017,"I wouldn't say I frequent this location but I have been here a good amount of times. Usually for the half apps or for cheap find drinks. My last visit wasn't the best though. Our waiter was knowledgeable and funny nothing wrong with the staff upon this visit, however my grilled shrimp came out twice uncooked as if it went straight from the freezer to the grill."
Antoinette T.,"Los Angeles, CA",84,36,72,1.0,5/19/2017,"Durning my visit at the Hackensack Applebee's I was disappointed with my Shrimp Skewer & Chicken meal. I was first disappointed because the chicken & shrimp had no flavor. I then started to eat my mash potato. As I was eating I noticed the supermarket produce sticker blended in with the mash potato skin. I notified my server, Luis who was very apologetic. The manager, Carl apologized but was very nonchalant about the matter.  He said I can order something else. Despite my disgust I place an order for a cheese quesadilla. The quesadilla was loaded with veggies. I really just wanted cheese but at this point I didn't want to complain again. I was ready to leave.  As I was reviewing the receipt I noticed there was a charge for my first order (Shrimp & Chicken) and the quesadilla. I told my server there is no reason why I should have to pay for both entries. He said the manager was suppose to remove it. The manager then stated he removed the appetizers & the Shrimp & Chicken entree from the receipt. I believe he only removed both items after we complained. Needless to say I will not return"
Fiona C.,"Demarest, NJ",17,5,2,4.0,4/23/2017,"Before I came, I saw this Applebee's review pretty bad! But we still want to try. When we try to open the door, the waiter came out and open the door for us. Make me feel so welcome to come! Then he took us to the table less than a minute.        I like the waitress so much because she always have the smiling face. Her name is Gowa. We ordered salmon, steak and chicken. The food taste was ok, but the portion a kind of small.         Overall the service is 5 star, the food only 3-4 star!"
Katelynn T.,"NJ, NJ",112,2,,1.0,10/6/2017,I wish I could give this no stars. The service was beyond awful. Went with a group of friends for half apps and I waited over an hour for my meal to come for it to be the wrong thing. Waitress never really checked in on us. I wish I could get the time I wasted here back. 3 hours for a couple appetizers and drinks is ridiculous. Will never be back here.
craig S.,"Lodi, NJ",0,27,,4.0,11/8/2017,"I like the food at Applebee's. Their food is good and the price is reasonable. Especially, 2 for 20 is kicking ass. I always get 2 for 20 every time I go to Applebee's. This deal does not have a lot of options for the main meal, but they all taste good. The only thing I was not happy is that when I did take-out last time. I ordered 2 for 20 and when I paid, I paid cash. I gave the person who took the order exact money. The person's name who took my order was Faith. When I paid, Faith said tips are not included, and then I said ""well, I am doing take-out"". As soon as I said that, she gave me a dirty look. I have never seen any servers asking tips for take-out. If I am going to leave tips for what I am spending, I rather eat in at the restaurant and get a full service than doing take out. I have done take out 2 more times ever since then, but Faith was not there. The other people who took my order never asked for tips and they were really nice and friendly"
Erin O.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",1,4,,4.0,8/16/2017,First time at this Applebee's location and the service was fantastic. Dave made sure our drinks were always refilled and our food came out fast and hot! I would definitely recommend this location compared to others.
Janice L.,"Roselle Park, NJ",607,884,123,3.0,4/5/2016,"The person who sat us just was not in the mood. He sounded as if all life was taken out of him that day. Service was alright. The food was what you'd expect from an Applebee's. Now they have tablets at the tables in the bar area where you can grab your server's attention or add to your order. You can also pay there, which makes it easier.  It's alright, not great, but it's alright."
Ian S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",157,7,,5.0,8/1/2017,"After a horrible customer service incident at TGIF(across the road), me and my girlfriend came to Applebees. The service was great, our food and drinks all came out within 20 minutes. You won my vote!"
Virginia T.,"Dumont, NJ",156,314,264,1.0,3/24/2016,"First time here and I have not been to an applebees in about 8 years. Very, very disappointing! Every entree tasted like a warmed up frozen meal. The service was good therefore I feel bad leaving such a review but the food was bland and just lukewarm. Even the kids meal was bad. I will not be returning."
Dom R.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",33,87,159,3.0,5/16/2017,I apperciate the manager for working today that saved our meal. Our money was stolen from us and not given back our change and taken as a tip. If the woman needed the money so bad i would have given her a few dollars. Still going back though tomorrow for lunch with wifey.
Jeanna G.,"Paramus, NJ",438,627,2800,4.0,12/21/2015,"Stopping in here the other day before work to pick up a oriental chicken salad and honey bbq boneless wings from car side to go.  I placed the order about 10 mins before arriving and the woman over the phone was a pleasure to deal with. Bubbly personality that brightened my mood. I pulled up to car side to go and after just a few mins someone came outside with my salad and wings just as I ordered them, I paid the lady and was on my way. Quick and simple. Great car side to go service!"
John L.,"Bergenfield, NJ",0,21,9,1.0,4/10/2017,"Appetizers come out late . Then they drop off entrée 5 minutes later. The place has 10 people in it , really..."
Ricardo P.,"Bronx, NY",5,35,4,5.0,1/28/2017,"The waiter, Javier was so attentive. He made the eating experience so much more pleasant . Food was great and service was fast. I would come again"
Lindsey W.,"Emerson, NJ",96,150,151,3.0,4/23/2016,"I haven't been to this applebees in a while but gosh has it changed. We sat at the table for about 30-35 minutes before our drinks came to the table. We had to use the iPad at the table to order our appetizers and they were ordered before a waitress even got to our table- which we had to use the iPad to send her a notification to call her over.  The food was good though. Not any different than your typical applebees. The ribs were cooked perfectly. A few of the appetizers were missing their dipped sauces and the spinach dip definitely got stuck with the bottom of the bag chip crumbs.    i can't say we'll be back very often, but I'm sure i'll end up here for half price apps again."
Shadya N.,"New York, NY",24,123,203,5.0,6/11/2016,This review is specifically for an employee who attended me at CARSIDE TOGO. Gus was amazing from beginning to end. All the tips in the world wouldn't be enough to thank him for his service. Really great customer service and a pleasure speaking too!
Terri G.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",0,2,,2.0,3/30/2017,"Hadn't been here in a while, usually go to the one on the Bronx. Forgot why I hadn't been in a while until now. First they try to seat us directly across from a noisy baby even though the restaurant was empty. Then they bring us the wrong appetizer. My margarita was watery even through the ice hadn't melted. Hannah was pleasant but the service and food was lacking overall. Won't return anytime soon."
Hennie Rose D.,"Bergenfield, NJ",383,168,234,4.0,8/8/2015,Came here for the first time after many many years. Ordered half price apps. Food came quick. Food was good. Its what you expect from an Applebee's. Its half off.
Thorne K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,61,,5.0,4/15/2017,"This review is for one of the servers and greeters there. Every time my husband and I have visited Applebees, Sammie always made our visit ten times better and more welcoming. His service is nothing less than amazing and accommodating. He shows enthusiasm and kindness that's not seen in many places these days. Thankful to have gotten his name yesterday and hopefully this gets through to someone higher as well. In my opinion, praise is due where and when it's deserved."
Keydi B.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",5,47,29,1.0,7/18/2016,I came to get a gift card for my great aunt for her 90 birthday.   They had NO plain gift cards except football or winter ones.  Unacceptable!   Go a local store for a gift card rather than coming here!  Do Not waist your time even with the $10 back promotion!
Shreen S.,"Tenafly, NJ",146,48,5,1.0,12/20/2015,"Giving this Applebee's one star is being generous in my book.  I completely understand that this is, after all, an Applebee's and my expectations aren't high at all. That being said, this establishment is very poorly run as the servers don't even have enough decency to treat customers with a little respect. My waiter threw 3 straws at me when I asked for one. Then, after bringing my food, he joked that he forgot to add special seasoning and took it around the corner and came back (implying that he was going to spit in it). I understand he was joking but there's a thin line between being funny and doing your job. Especially when I waited about 40 minutes for my plate and completely lost my appetite.  Regardless of that situation, this place always disappoints. The service is always shitty, the workers are rude, and it's just awful food. It's never my first choice and I instantly regret agreeing to go as soon as I walk in through those doors."
Mayra A.,"Union City, NJ",59,11,,1.0,9/24/2016,"If I could give it 0 stars I would, this is the worst Applebees I've ever been to. Worst service. I get home from work late, and decided to grab a bite to eat with the boyfriend, sat down right away, which was good, it took our server 20'minutes to get to us. I had to call the host over to ask if anyone was going to come over, he then took our drink orders.  I asked for a blackberry sangria, and it came out 40 minutes later, its ridiculous. I can only imagine how long it would take for our food to get to our table. I don't think anyone is managing this company or are too cheap to have more staff closing and paying more attention to the customers. I work at a restaurant and this wouldn't fly by my staff. This is horrible! I couldn't wait til I got home to write this review. So I'm doing it now as I wait for my food to come to my table and it's been already over an hour and that I've been here. Who is running this place ??  Never again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APPLEBEES!"
Jose T.,"Paterson, NJ",16,6,,4.0,8/29/2016,"The service is really good. My waiter, Justin, was very good at making sure we were comfortable and satisfied with our meal. However the one reason id give this review a 4 out 5 is because the fries were a bit stale. They didnt taste as good as i expected. I was there not too long ago and the fries were amazing that time. Doesn't mean im never going back. Just a heads up to the kitcen staff to work in the fries. Other than that, great service."
Alicia G.,"Englewood, NJ",0,11,2,5.0,6/29/2016,"Great customer service at the bar, Carlos and Matt are the what....BOMB!!!!!"
Nareefa Y.,"Englewood, NJ",11,20,8,4.0,1/2/2016,"Sadly it's a mixed bag when coming here, because of the inconsistencies and a lack of quality control. We usually take home food and were given uncooked rice or missing dressings. We normally sit at bar area, because we enjoy chatting with the staff. Over the course of three years, we have seems many different faces and made friends with a few of the bartenders. Our favorites are Cory and Matt, they always make out experience a pleasant and entertaining one.  The drinks can be watered down but we continue to come here as long as the regular bar staff doesn't change."
Joe Y.,"Palisades Park, NJ",122,4,,1.0,8/17/2015,"Let me start with this- this is an applebees; expectations are NOT high. I expect prices to be cheap and food to be hastily made, even microwaved is acceptable. That's fair to expect from an Applebees, right? This review is based on 5 occasions of going back (you want to give them a chance right?) and I've had the same experience EVERY TIME. With that said, the things you expect to be actually acceptable are all bad. If you ask for waters to start off, expect not to get it until you ask them at least two more times as they pass by. Maybe they're going to the mountains to get the water, but aside from that, this basic task is always a complete fail. The food will be bad. Don't expect anything fantastic. But the 1 star is not for the food. It's for the service. Lol no one will go to applebees looking for good food. It's because you want some late night half price appetizers for cheap.  If you want the check, just assume that they are processing fresh wood into paper and hand printing your bill onto it, because it takes way too long. Don't expect the check the first time you ask for it. Ask for it maybe 2 or 3 times. Otherwise expect to sit there until they close.  This is basic stuff, Hackensack Applebees. The management need to better train their employees. We understand they're mostly high school kids- but this is just basic stuff."
Maly A.,"New York, NY",158,665,1206,3.0,8/4/2015,Only ordered to-go once. Staff that  brought it out was friendly. The Fiesta Chopped Chicken Salad (the only thing I get from here) was also fine too.
Wayne W.,"Fort Worth, TX",632,475,87,3.0,9/22/2015,I mean what can I say its Applebee's so its sub par food for a decent price.  There is nothing you can get here that you couldn't spend a little more and go to a speciality place for.  Wait staff is always good besides that its just normal Applebee's
Travis W.,"River Edge, NJ",0,2,1,1.0,8/4/2016,"My gf, her mom, and I went here for din din and when the waiter asked what we wanted to drink, my gf asked for a water and a vanilla shake, her mom ordered a martini thing I think, and I asked for a coke (nothing too fancy) but the waiter smiled and replied with ""we have Pepsi"". DO YOU THINK THIS IS A GAME?! I asked ""do you have Sprite? And the waiter replied ""no, but we have Sierra Mist"". SIERRA FRIGGEN MIST. Do you want to die sir? I then stated ""I'll have a water"". I will never ever forget this horrific experience. I am left scarred knowing that they don't have those two VERY AFFORDABLE beverages."
Joanna R.,"New York, NY",7,8,3,2.0,6/1/2015,I rarely review a franchise but part of why you visit a franchise is because you know what to expect but the consistency of this franchise in comparison to others is mediocre.   This Applebee's is always a very frustrating experience which is unfortunate since my apartment is literally within walking distance. I have dined inside on two occasions where they have literally run out of cups for water. I also have a friend who dined on a separate occasion from those two times who complained of the exact same issue. The fact that this has happened on three separate occasions is not a service issue- it's a management issue. I hope that they will read this review and address this very bizarre issue that I promise is a very cheap and easy fix. My next frustrations came with takeout. Both times I have ordered takeout from this particular Applebee's they have failed to start preparing my food prior to my arrival. The first time I called in and placed my order over the phone. When my boyfriend arrived at the expected pickup time they admitted that they hadn't started the order. The reason I never previously reviewed them was due to the fact that the manager comped one of our apps and I felt like it was a reasonable accommodation. Tonight I placed an order for pickup through online ordering and when I arrived on site while the employee was very nice and polite it was obvious that again my order hadn't been started even though this was my pickup time. My food was promptly started but I now know that I just really can't rely on my food being ready on time at this location. Overall this location is run down and outdated in comparison to other Applebee's locations. This probably won't be my last time visiting this Applebee's but it is only out of convenience and the fact that I like the food. The reality is that I will continue to choose other local dinning options while visiting this specific franchise less frequently than I otherwise would if it was more on par with the standard that has been set by other Applebee's locations I have visited. If I could give a 2.5 I would but this place just doesn't deserve a 3 star review. Hopefully they can work on some of the things I mentioned in my review and eventually when I give them another chance in the future and at that time I'll adjust my rating but for now they've got some things to tweak.
Lex B.,"Manhattan, NY",36,13,8,1.0,4/25/2015,"This Applebees used to be my favorite late night spot all through my high school years and college. However, as of lately, it seems like management could care less of about their employees and the type of people serving their loyal customers.  In short, the service is beyond terrible. Expect to wait before getting seated (even when it's empty), expect to wait for utensils and getting your order taken, expect to wait for your mediocre food and expect to wait for the waiter to get your bill. The last time I visited I asked for a plate and the waitress picked her ear and grabbed an unused plate from a table they were cleaning out because she didn't want to walk to the back. Disgusting.   Tonight was my last straw. For starters, they took forever to get seated and to get our orders taken so we left. As we exited, a young waiter with long unwashed curly hair  sporting a stupid bandana sarcastically said, ""That was quick I hope you enjoyed your food"". Are you kidding? Instead of kindly asking us what went wrong, he decided to make a rude comment to completely turn us off from ever giving this place another chance.  Applebee's, get your business together. We went to Miller Ales after this with no regrets."
Robert G.,"Rochelle Park, NJ",2,4,,1.0,10/17/2015,"Tried again at Hackensack location, never have received good service. Once again not disappointed, sat down and after 8 minutes,  nobody wanting to take responsibility for our table, we got up. People behind us got served almost  immediately,  but not us. PS one waitress when asked, blatantly in front of us said that this was not her table. Seeing this is at least 3 times we have received inferior service chances are we will not be going back to this location. Lastly, manger wanted to sit us someplace else, I guess just doing his job, but enough is enough, we will not be back"
Lisa C.,"Succasunna, NJ",0,21,,1.0,11/10/2016,"AWFUL!  Used to go to this location at least once or twice a week. I ordered take out and found missing items more than once. The last time it was over $30 worth. The manager advised he would mail me a gift card for the $30 rather than reimburse my credit card. Even after following up and explaining to yet another manager, 2 months later and still no gift card. I will never dine at this location again."
SooZ C.,"Bergenfield, NJ",0,4,,1.0,10/8/2016,"I just had the worst experience with curbside to go. I came and waited for 10 minutes and no one came to greet me. I got out and walked in, and no one greeted me until one waiter said you have to pat at the bar. I ended up paying at the bar and waited for them to give me my food. I don't think that's what Applebee's means when they say carside to go. What a inconvenience! So mad actual!"
Bart L.,"Dumont, NJ",6,85,,2.0,8/28/2016,"OK, while it is not quite bad enough to rate 1 star (which, for me, requires awfulness above and beyond simple neglectfulness), it comes close. I've been to other Applebee's, and found them to be decent as far as chain restaurants go, but, even though we give this place a chance every 2-3 years (pretty much after every time we have a pleasant experience at another Applebee's), it always disappoints. Some problems are based on the kind of restaurant it is (unsupervised children screaming and running around), but we have experienced problems from ""Would you like some food with your salt?"" to getting several pieces of tableware with encrusted dirt which, when brought to the manager's attention, we were unable to get the message across that it was something that she might consider being concerned about."
Andrea A.,"Antioch, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/9/2016,"This is the worst Applebee's experience I have ever had.   Mind you I travel for work as an IT Consultant so I have had Applebee's all over.   Needless to say the my waitress pleasant.  They lady delivering my food was utterly rude.  She gives me my food then proceeds to walk away, I said ""excuse me"", she turns around and screams at me ""WHAT DO YOU WANT"". She was so loud and disrespectful   I very calmly said I'll just talk to my waitress when she comes by.   She gets closer and yells NO WHAT DO YOU WANT.    At this point I got very quiet please Maam don't worry about it.   I was scared she very close to me and yelling.   It's beyond my over cooked chicken wings with no seasoning.   I now feel threatened.   Worst Ever!!!  To add insult to injury I notice the woman was nice customers of another race.   RIDICULOUSLY!!!! I wish her had her name.  There is no reason to talk to anyone that way!"
Ina M.,"Hackensack, NJ",329,378,820,1.0,9/24/2014,"If this could get negative stars, I would give negative stars. I try and try again to at least like this place, but it just always disappoints. Okay, before I go on with this, I am not hard to please (I easily give 4-5 stars). Just give me a drink and put in the food order and we will be best friends. I work in the same industry and I totally understand we get busy with other tables, but to go around a table and making it obvious you don't wanna take us is just rude, especially if we have to wait 10-15 minutes just to get greeted. Just say ""Give me one second and I will be with you"" is enough for me to know you acknowledged my presence. Every time I attempt and give a chance to this place, my boyfriend puts a timer on and it seriously takes us 10-15 minutes to get greeted. That is not the worst thing yet. So I come in with friends and have more on their way. We get sat quick, but takes forever for a server to greet us. So the rest of our friends come in 30 minutes before closing. The host greeted them by saying, ""you know we are closing in 30 minutes right."" And my friends were puzzled and said we""ll make it quick. I honestly felt bad that the rest came so late and the kitchen was about to close and the restaurant was about to close and we were still there. I ACTUALLY FELT BAD AT FIRST. But after the host came to our table and said ""well if you plan on ordering food, you have to go to the bar and order..and you gotta make it quick."" I was shocked. If I were to say that to a guest, I would've gotten fired on the spot. I felt disrespected. So fine we go to the bar to join our friends that ordered food. I was just so heated that I asked for a manager. Well, that was a mistake. I talked to him and it was not going anywhere. He even said ""but I don't understand how hard it is for you to get up from your table to the bar and just order."" I was even more shocked. Like I just lost respect for this place. I told him if he wanted to say sorry at least act like you mean it and he's just like, ""but I don't know what else you want me to say..I am saying sorry!""  I decided to leave, and my friends that stayed to wait for their food said that they heard that manager talking crap about the situation amongst the employees. Who knows.  If you want to go to a good spot, go to the Applebee's in Paramus (I do get busy servers, but I absolutely love that one 10000000000x more! Service is better, and managers are great. They actually know how to approach guests. I have been to the one in Garfield once, and I got good service too (could have been because our server was the boyfriend of a friend, but regardless, everyone in that Applebee's were so much better).  Drink tip: And if you're there too, never get a margarita here. They just taste like pure sour (could be due to their company recipe). But the white peach sangria never disappoints! 5stars to the sangria!"
Vero T.,"Union City, NJ",1,4,,4.0,10/5/2016,"Good service and this time the food was great specially the drinks, I love made two for 20! It's cheap and good!!!"
Daniel M.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",136,6,3,1.0,3/31/2017,"Such an outright shitty experience. First off, the Host was looking at us all weird and we were not feeling in. Secondly, our server took 15 minutes to ask for our fucking drinks. I ordered the Honey Blackberry Quencher Tea and this bitch put ONE fucking BLACKBERRY IN IT. Then, I ask for extra ranch with my wings...where it @ doe. So I ask her coworker...where it at though. She comes by to ask how's everything. I ask for ranch...where it at though. She comes back again. Where's my ranch!? Then she brings it. Then we trying to pay and this bitch was so shitty. We wanted to pay half card on iPad and half cash and she didn't even help us or explain shit when the iPad crashed, and it got to a point where I didn't feel like waiting to pay cash, so I paid with my card. Even when she came back from her hibernation in the kitchen, she didn't even have that check that I initially ASKED HER FOR. Gowa, this just ain't for you. Not to mention, just in general, everyone there seems a little Bek and I don't know what's good with anyone who works in this establishment. Everyone seems too tired and disinterested. What the fuck is going on here. Would not recommend"
