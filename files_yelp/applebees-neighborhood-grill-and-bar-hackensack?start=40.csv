Charles B.,"New Milford, NJ",117,15,1,1.0,3/31/2016,"We arrived for dinner on Thursday, 3/31, at about 8:30 and requested a booth. As soon as we sat down several huge cockroaches ran across the table. We left immediately.  From outside we saw several members of the staff swatting the bugs with menus.  Absolutely disgusting. We will never return."
David V.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",59,24,58,3.0,4/6/2015,Lives up to the 3 stars this place has .. One of the waitresses told me people were getting fired .. I'm don't want to get involved with issues in this place .. Waitresses please keep it friendly and stop acting like you're living a miserable life .
Amp R.,"River Edge, NJ",0,26,,2.0,8/14/2014,"I have been here atleast dozen times..  This place is for college students, especially if you go after 10, where they come for half off apps and happy hour drinks.. The half price apps are horrible and the drinks are  totally watered..  There are many regulars in this place.. the applebees menu is also pretty limited.. I have started preferring other local chains"
Tom R.,"Teaneck, NJ",15,52,33,4.0,10/30/2015,They have really stepped up the game and become a good chain. At least in the locations I've been visiting
Emma B.,"Teaneck, NJ",82,11,,4.0,1/17/2016,"Good food and atmosphere, really nice servers! Went here with my boyfriend and the lady we had was very nice and down to earth! Totally recommend it!"
Maly M.,"Teaneck, NJ",1,29,,4.0,11/8/2015,"Matt the bartender was great. I wasn't sure what drink I wanted but he was very helpful in narrowing down selections and made me a tasty fireball drink with vodka, strawberry, and lemonade. Great service. Thanks Matt!"
Gowthami C.,"Teaneck, NJ",1,20,10,1.0,2/1/2014,"We were here last night and never going back because... - The worst long island iced tea I ever had - Got bacon in my Quesadilla when I specifically asked for none and I ate some :(  - We had to ASK for the cutlery and while waiting, our food got cold - The food was pretty disappointing too STAY AWAY!"
Aw F.,"New York, NY",1,33,14,1.0,3/30/2015,The waiter took a good 10 mins to come to us to just introduce himself and take our drinks. I asked if the happy hour included in the half appetizers he said yes. So I ordered took them 20 mins to bring two appetizers I asked for my sons fries to be non seasoned. They came seasoned after 30 mins. It wasn't busy. Didn't even come check up on us or anything he went missing finally he showed up I asked for the check and the apps weren't half off I told him aren't they have off he said no only drinks I was like but asked you about the appetizers and u said yea. Very unprofessional. Service food was all horrible.
Vivi N.,"Englewood, NJ",246,144,453,3.0,4/15/2015,"I guess the waiter was new.... People after us got their appetizers before us. The food was bland (I got the shrimp and broccoli cavatappi). The potsticker appetizer was cooked extremely dry. But I guess, what do you expect at a food chain? You get what you pay for. I guess I will stick to the usual quesadilla burger next time... How can you go wrong with that? I'll order Chinese in next time instead of a late night food run."
Elvira A.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",17,29,20,4.0,4/7/2015,"I came to this restaurant with my friends to have some drinks after work... Also to take advantage of the happy hour that they have after 10 pm... The appetizers were delicious, the drinks were ok.... the waiter was friendly and attentive; the only bad thing was that they took so long to serve our food... but in overall I enjoyed the experience there."
Kyle H.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",367,230,34,2.0,7/31/2013,I prefer the Garfield location better. The server was great! but my wings were a bit dry which was disappointing cause it was a Tuesday night and it was extremely slow in there.
Wai W.,"Waldwick, NJ",119,448,203,4.0,10/26/2013,"Applebee's help support various fund raisers by doing pancake breakfasts just like my god son's boyscotts.  They open and cook the pancakes from 08:00 to 10:00 today.  The $10.00 ticket is worth it for charity and I will support all Applebee's for their kind support for neighborhood.  Food, quality and service has always been good and you do get your money's worth.  A good place to grab a bite, a drink or two and you always feel welcome."
Gerony M.,"Bergenfield, NJ",56,31,22,4.0,9/7/2014,"I come here frequently and I usually go for the half apps, but it really like it. The food is good, especially the wings!! The staff here r really friendly and always make u feel comfortable. Sometimes when it gets busy it feels like you never get any service but that understanding. It's a really nice place to eat and relax but not for fine dining , mostly American food but it's a nice place to satisfy hunger I like it a lot !"
Daniel L.,"New York, NY",386,223,72,1.0,11/20/2012,"As the Duke of this place, I feel that I have honor- nay, the absolute burden- of writing a review about this Applebee's. The servers are money hungry as they always find a way to ""accidentally"" upcharge your bill despite the meal being part of the late night half off deal. I mean, who else would come here if it wasn't for that reason?! Part of me wishes that there are better options nearby where the craft drinks are cheap, and crowd noise low enough for you to catch with your group of friends, and screens big enough where you are about to enjoy the game. Sadly, this is the only option around. Except for Hooters (they primarily serve domestic beers).  Aside from that tangent, what I can assert as true is the staff is dimwitted and money hungry, and managers unapologetic and rude. I complained numerous times for their delay of food coming out.  Yet, given the monopoly they seem to have, I don't expect to avoid this place until some where else worthwhile opens up. All in all, just know what to expect and expect to tip less, cause they'll find a way to up charge you."
Carla L.,"New York, NY",120,240,22,4.0,1/15/2013,"As far as Applebee's go, this is one of the better ones. Whoever is in the kitchen, does a really good job with the food. I've been here many times, and it's always prepared quickly and correctly. In fact, I'm usually thinking, ""wow, this is pretty good for an Applebee's"".  The servers have always been friendly and attentive when I've been here. It's a very comfy vibe here too for some reason, which is strange because you would think all Applebee's would be the same, but I've found that some tend to be more high-strung than others."
Aliyah M.,"Bogota, NJ",111,102,25,4.0,11/19/2012,"I come here for one reason- half-priced appetizers after 10 pm. I would ABSOLUTELY NOT pay full price for.. well.. anything on the menu. We go, order a few milkshakes, a bunch of boneless wings, a plate of nachos (which is HUGE, btw), a chicken quesadilla, and what the server suggests if we feel like it- and we chow down. Its not gourmet but hey- this is Applebee's, guys. You all know what you're getting yourselves into.  Our servers have always been pleasant, if not as prompt as we like it but since its always really packed after 10 pm and these people have to run around listening to annoying customers all day with a smile on their face, I don't mind.  I like the food and it's always enough. If it's not enough, spend another 5 bucks and get another full order or wings! Yay! Nothing has ever tasted bad or stale, and I would absolutely come back. After 10 pm. And pay 1/2 for the appetizers."
Victoria G.,"Paramus, NJ",0,3,,1.0,11/7/2015,Wish I could give this location 0 stars. Service is TERRIBLE. They couldn't even bring us plates for our appetizers and it took them 30 mins to get us our drinks. Never coming back.
Thomas V.,"New Milford, NJ",2,2,1,2.0,1/25/2015,"I came to this restaurant after church. I was seated almost immediately. A waiter came by and took my order for drinks. Then I didn't see him again. Thankfully Thomas, another waiter came to my rescue. He was courteous and polite. He took my order for Bourbon street steak and root beer. The order came in about ten minutes, pretty good since I had ordered medium well. The steak was a little too salty for my taste. The waiter came and enquired how I liked the food. The manager also came by. The overall experience was ok but the quality of the food was average. I think this Applebee's is trying to improve, my previous experience to this place was nothing to brag about. I might go back in another six months."
Ben F.,"New Milford, NJ",162,122,103,3.0,1/18/2013,"This is definitely one of the friendlier and down to earth Applebee's. The servers will stop and chat with a table. Plus, they actually have opinions on the food, they will tell you what they recommend and don't recommend. I like when they do this based on experience and not the price point. Which our server did. He was very knowledgeable and helped my friend--who had never been there before--navigate the menu.  The apps are delicious and the prices aren't crazy. There's usually something for everyone.  It can get a little crowded/noisy but you get what you pay for. Enjoy the environment. Bring some friends. It's a good place to unwind for less than one would pay at a NJ or NY bar."
Lauren K.,"Fort Lee, NJ",2,3,1,1.0,12/20/2013,It is Saturday late afternoon and it is not rush hour and we got sit right away however we were waited for the server for more than 10 min and still didnt get anyone. I just waited to see how long it will take and noone came by..so I am leaving right now! I will never come back here!
