Barry F.,"Secaucus, NJ",2,5,,1.0,6/14/2015,"Went to this Applebees a few days ago with a friend.  We sat at the bar in the early afternoon for some beers and lunch.  The bar was not crowded at all maybe four other people there.  The service was absolutely horrible.  The bartender came to take our drink order after we already been sitting for several minutes and had the attitude that we were bothering him on this lazy afternoon.  He gave us our menus and forgot about us.  He never came back to ask if we wanted to order and finally we needed to flag him down and ask if we could order appetizers.  We gave him our order and the appetizers came out promptly however the bartender had assumed that my friend wanted a small plate combo instead of the two full size orders.  This is not a giant deal but he should have asked what option my friend wanted.  The food was fine no issues there but after receiving our appetizers we were once again forgotten.  The bartender must have assumed we were done however I was interested in ordering an entree.  We waited for over twenty minutes to see if Mr. Personality would ask if we were ok.  He never asked if we would like another round of drinks or if we wanted to order any other food.  He then brought the check over without us having asked for it.  Now I realize that at Applebees they put the check in a glass in front of you and update it when you order but this guy plopped it right in front of us.  Well at this point I as fed up with the horrible attitude from this guy so I paid the check and his tip was zero.  I have never in my adult life tipped someone nothing.  I frequent other Applebees on occasion and have never had such a bad experience.  Save yourself the aggravation if you walk in and Ben is behind the bar just leave.  I don't know abut the rest of the staff, they may be awesome, but I will never be back to find out.  Applebees management you probably lost out on double or triple of amount of what my bill was including beers and instead I went to popeyes so sad."
Mega M.,"Jackson, NJ",65,452,,1.0,8/10/2011,"AWFUL!  AWFUL!  AWFUL! I went to this location twice in my life and both times I scratched my head wondering how this place is in business. I ordered a burger medium and it came to me medium rare. When I told the waitress about the mistake, she got an attitude and looked annoyed that I asked her to do something. She returned it to the kitchen but when it came back, it was burnt. I was so ******** annoyed that I asked to speak to the manager right away. I waited 20 minutes and nobody came to the table. I was pissed. I left them the money and walked out. It would take a miracle to walk into this place again. Awful food, Awful service. Don't wste your money"
Mister T.,"New Milford, NJ",122,5,,1.0,5/28/2015,Food was good didn't take too long to come out. The service on the other hand was terrible. Took forever and didn't even check on us to see if we're ok. Couldn't even provide straws so we asked someone else. Waited 1 hour for our check and our water refills were sent to the wrong table. The waiters name was Malik. I'm sorry to say that he must be the worst waiter I've ever had.
Dayna A.,"New York, NY",22,182,8,4.0,6/23/2011,"Was recently taken to this Applebee's in Hackensack-yack-yack [you outta know by now], there was some reluctance on my part as an old co-worker who worked the line in his teens called it Crapplebee's.  The name has stuck in my head for years.   I ordered from the bottomless lunch menu.  $7 for unlimited french onion soup and spinach salad--- what a deal!  The food was unexpectedly fresh and tasty.  But what sealed it for me was the service.  We had an amazing waitress named Lisa Wadel who was a joy.  She seems to love her job and it shows.  Apparently she is actually recognized by Applebee's for her staff training capabilities.   Well done Lisa--- and well done Applebee's for validating a fantastic hire."
Manda D.,"Hasbrouck Heights, NJ",21,25,18,1.0,4/24/2013,"Beware CAMILLE-I don't know how she spells her name but she is clearly miserable as a waitress and taking it out on the restaurants guests. She didn't take our menus away, didn't bring out our food or our drinks (they were brought out by other people) and when we requested lemons she's kept us waiting fifteen minutes. She took our order, brought a single glass of water to the table and then disappeared to get the lemons. In the meantime our food and my drink from the bar was brought over by another server. When she came out of the kitchen 15 minutes later with no lemons, we watched as she approached two other tables- bigger tables with more people and thus capable of giving her a bigger tip- and ignored us. Upon seeing our faces, before we even said anything she came over and said angrily, ""you have to give me a minute okay, I just got a four top and six top and I have to help them. I'll get your lemons in a minute."" Then she rolled her eyes and shook her head, it was behind my friends back but I was facing her and could see her clearly. When she walked by I told her we needed plates, napkins, straws and the rest of our order which hadn't made it out of the kitchen and she started looking at me like I had three heads, I added in that I realized she was busy but I saw her roll her eyes and she's not invisible- she just walked away! Unbelievably rude- the manager then came over with our lemons and in front of the manager and VERY loud she goes, ""Oh and I'm not serving this table anymore!"" I would have fired her on the spot- all the other guests were just staring at her and I just felt so much pity for her. How pathetic it is to be a grown adult and not be able to control yourself in front of other people. Not to mention it's her job- the manager was polite and he apologized but I really felt like no patron should have to sit through that- oh and to top it off the waitress put in the wrong order for us she gave us chicken nachos which I believe is more expensive and not what we asked for- we wanted regular nachos.  This was a frequent hang out place for a few of my friends, but every time we go now it just gets worse and worse. We go for the late night apps/drinks and almost always the server's are rude. Mostly this is because I usually go with only one or two other people and a ten dollar check isn't going to yield a big tip. So the servers are money hungry but I've had experiences where I've had to call a manager over. The one manager, James is nice, very apologetic and accommodating, but he's fighting a losing battle with unprofessional and downright rude staff."
Evelyn M.,"Hackensack, NJ",1,1,,3.0,6/13/2014,"Evelyn Martinez 150 Bonhomme ave Hackensack, nj. 07601 I went to the Applebee's in Hackensack and was not happy with the service there.  I realize it was a busy  Friday, but do not think that I should accept cold food and rude service.  I order a bacon cheeseburger medium rare.  Of course it took about 20 minutes for me to get it and it was well done.  I told my waitress that  I couldn't eat  and I wanted to send it back for a new one.  I did not receive my food  for another 45 minutes  by then I was starving and annoyed.  I asked if she could make it to go cause I was tired by then.  She looked not. To happy. I left her a tip eve though. She was  not professional.  I realize she might of had a bad day, but  I do not appreciate  being treated that way."
Jessica K.,"Hillsdale, NJ",21,349,53,3.0,5/21/2011,"What do you do when the Mets/Yankees are on TV, and you're so hungry not even the thought of biting into a bar pizza sounds satisfying enough? Where do you go when it's 10:30pm on a Friday, and your burger-lovin' significant other wants his moo cow on a bun asap? The answer to these questions, my friend, is Applebee's. Yes, the chain every American is familiar with and probably the basis for the whoever wrote that movie ""Waiting"", starring Ryan Reynolds. Overpriced drinks and mediocre food still seem to bring in a lot of people here. Just after being told the wait was 10 minutes for a table of 2, and not an empty bar stool in sight, I thought, maybe this really wasn't a great idea. But then, a patch of clear space appeared near the bar, so we moved in quickly, and planted ourselves right in front of their monstrous HDTV. With a perfect view of the game, their signature, not-so-bad boneless wings, standard bar service, and a great guy sitting next to me, I can with confidence, this Applebee's experience turned out to be quite alright."
Brian G.,"Emerson, NJ",1,2,,1.0,10/12/2013,You do not want the waitress marta. We waited 10 mins before being approached and she doesnt give a damn about service. Ill find another applebees
Elizabeth B.,"Hackensack, NJ",0,3,,1.0,2/16/2015,Beware of this trash box! Service and food sucks. Worst long island ice tea ever!!!! It tasted like tap water and flat club soda. We attempted to order buffalo wings and quesadillas. NO MORE! We attempted to order mozzarella sticks and a veggie burger. There was no more. We ended up ordering french fries. Cold french fries.  The waiter seemed rushed and impatient. The manager was incompetent and full of excuses. The silverware was filthy. We asked for plasticware. No more! The absentminded waiter served us tea on a dirty sticky saucer. They ran out of food and plasticware. I'm so over Applebees.
WILL L.,"Lodi, NJ",171,5,19,2.0,5/23/2013,Food is ok. Service is a little. Triple Chocolate Meltdown is a hit with kids and adults the same.
K E.,"Teaneck, NJ",4,14,,3.0,7/23/2013,"This place is okay. It's a typical Applebee's, nothing special. The food I received was hot and didn't take long. Server was okay."
Michael S.,"Dumont, NJ",7,10,5,3.0,8/29/2011,"Well the host, he had but implants, really? They don't look good on girls!"
Cynthia A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",464,718,330,3.0,12/19/2010,"Upping my review to three stars cause I had a good waiter second time around, and this place shouldn't suffer from one crabby waitress.  I also like the queso dip w/fresh cut potato twists."
Billy B.,"Chester, PA",0,3,,1.0,8/15/2012,"I've been here twice and ordered steak both times. On my first visit, the steak was overcooked but I didn't complain and still ate it. I visited again last night, ordered another medium rare steak and it came out medium well. This time, however, I let the waitress know and had it recooked. Ten-fifteen minutes later, the manager delivers my steak, I cut into it while she's there and again it is almost well done! I'm sure she knew that it wasn't cooked to my liking but being in the business myself, I just sucked it up, took my losses, took a couple bites of the dry steak and threw out my entire dinner. Obviously, I'll never dine here again. How many strikes does one need? Three is enough!"
Kevin C.,"Paramus, NJ",0,3,,1.0,11/12/2012,"I was there with my friends last Saturday. OK.. It was late night but we could have been served way better. Our server seemed so lost and screwed up every order we gave him. But really? Do I have to wait 15 minutes to get beer?????? He took orders for something that they ran out (Sam Adams) and it took 20 minutes for him to come back to our table saying they ran out. (Are you kidding me????)  So instead, we ordered Heineken and someone (bartender??) ended up bringing us Coors Light. Of course, it took 15 minutes for the wrong beer. He ended up overcharging us for the Sam Adams that they ran out. This place is so lost and needs to train staff better."
Cristina M.,"Garfield, NJ",0,2,,1.0,8/14/2011,"bad experience.... never again! stopped in one night for dinner and what was supposed to be a quick dinner turned out to be almost 2 hours. server took 10 mins to initially get to our table so we ordered our drinks and food right away. Our drinks came quickly but everything after went downhill. After waiting 30 minutes, we were getting restless. The server was everywhere seemingly forgetting about us. 45 minutes later I walked up to the hostess asking for our food and a manager because if not we were ready to walk out. Upon getting back to my table dinner was served COLD! It was definitely sitting unattended for a while. The manager came and offered every which way to keep us from leaving. Ultimately we got new food. After getting our food, the server yet again ignored us and made up excuses as to why our food was cold and blamed it on food runners. Did I mention we both had empty glasses while telling us this and never offered refills? Terrible service! Unattentive... this is the second time Ive had bad service there... don't think third time would be a charm"
Christine W.,"Warwick, NY",21,35,,1.0,7/1/2013,"I've eaten at various Applebees in the past and it is what it is. Usually good for a burger, sandwich, appys, etc. No complaints with other locations. But.. ate at this Hackensack location last night.. HORRIBLE! Waited quite some time for a burger and a steak. When the food finally did appear, both were not cooked as specified. My BF requested his steak medium and it was more on the medium rare side. I ordered my burger medium as well and it was barely even cooked, still raw and cold in the middle. Waited forever for our server to come back as he conveniently disappeared. When he finally did I requested a new burger, waited another 10 minutes and the 2nd burger was STILL way beyond medium... very rare. Ate it since by this point I was starving and didn't feel like waiting another 10-15 min and my BF was pretty much done with his meal at this point. Some rude person came over at some point and asked how our visit was so I explained the problems and the jerk ends up giving ME an attitude. Didn't make ANY attempt to rectify it and make us happy. Definitely won't visit this dump again.. not worth the money, will just order a pizza next time."
Mickey Z.,"Rochelle Park, NJ",0,13,,3.0,1/24/2010,"When there for the 2 for twenty deal.  Order the mozz sticks as a appetizer, a burger, and the chicken penne.  Mozz sticks were very good.  The burger was below average, and chicken penne was tasty.  Unlike the Paramus location, this location does not get ridiculously busy and the staff are all pleasant.  Overall, a place I would go back to if they still have this promotion, but I'll hold off on the burger.  A side note, burgers are usually what I order in these chain restaurants, so my standards for burgers tend to be quite high."
jerzee g.,"Wayne, NJ",2,95,,1.0,1/7/2011,"Ate here when the restaurant first opened in this location 5 years ago.  Shared an appetizer and ordered a salad.  Ate around 7.00pm.  By 1.30am the next morning I was doubled over in extreme pain.  I had violent food poisoning--the kind where I probably should have headed straight for the emergency room but instead went to A&P for Gatorade and white bread.  I was ill for three days, barely able to tolerate food.  I contacted the restaurant to let them know I was ill, most likely from the salad.  They denied anyone had called to report food poisoning and told me that perhaps I had a bad cold.  This was no cold!  They offered me a free meal.  I turned it down and said I'd call the health department.  The persisted and said they'd send all sorts of coupons, etc.  I said I was never eating in an Applebee's again (I've held steadfast to that!).  They persisted and I gave them my name and address. Figured I'd give out the coupons or whatever.  About 10 days later I received an apology letter addressed to another individual in another town; apparently this person reported a food-related illness the same day as I.  Rest assured that letter was faxed to the health department!"
Anthony D.,"Hackensack, NJ",0,4,,1.0,11/3/2011,"terrible.  i sat at the bar, initially thinking i would get attentive service!  i was mistaken. i sat at the bar for almost 10 minutes, waitress was rude & had a chip on her shoulder. I had to get the attention from a waitress to let the bartender know what I wanted.  After my ginger ale, bartender took my order, brushed me off & continued to ignore me. NO TYPE OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT!  Food came out LATE 1/2 HOUR.  I ordered the 1 appetizer, that never arrived after I asked for the boneless wings to come from the kitchen first. The bartender assured me this will start off my dinner!  I was served 2 entrees, a chicken penne & burger. My appetizer never arrived & I was charged for it.  I had to deal with 2 separate waitresses to receive ANY type of employee acknowledgment. I tipped the bartender twice as to get her attention & ANY type of customer acknowledgment. Staff members were playing cards at a table next to the bar & CLEARLY saw everything. I constantly told them & other employees of the TERRIBLE service.  DO NOT SPEND YOUR $$$ with these people, they're obnoxious & rude. If you work @ this location EXPECT TO HEAR FROM CORPORATE for I am an investor."
