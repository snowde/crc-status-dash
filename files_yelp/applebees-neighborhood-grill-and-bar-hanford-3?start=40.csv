VeeVee N.,"Fresno, CA",60,624,11973,3.0,5/3/2012,"The food was good and there wasnt very many people, I mean it was only a tuesday night. About halfway thru our meal, the restaurant started playing really loud music. I couldnt understand why, as you'd expect music to be played on a weekend or when there is a big crowd. We asked if they could turn the music down a little bit so we could hear ourselves talk, but they never did. Our waitress was nice though and checked on us often."
Berkely P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,21,,1.0,7/12/2015,"I would be giving this place no stars if I could. I called to ask the manager a question about any positions hiring. He then says ""yea know what questions like that need to be asked after 2pm"" and then he hung up. I couldn't ask any more questions because it was a burden. I'm really disappointed that I was trying to ask a question and I was totally disrespected. I know now I do not want to be working in a place with poor Managment and communication skills. Totally not worth being treated like this."
David S.,"Corcoran, CA",50,2,,1.0,3/5/2016,I'm usually very calm when things go wrong but this place is so poorly ran I just had to give this place a horrible review. I feel bad for the waiters because they are the ones that have to hear our complaint about waiting about and hour and a half to receive our appetizers and like two hours to get our food. Management needs to get on this because when I asked about what was going on I was told that the order was never put in due to something wrong with the kitchen... Then when a manager finally came to speak to us he said he was sorry and it happens often? I'm over this place. Sorry for the rant but now you know...
Brittany B.,"Fresno, CA",177,58,39,4.0,12/28/2014,"Great place for happy hour! I love their drink and appetizer deals, though I wish the appetizer list was a bit bigger. They used to include the cheeseburger sliders (which are delicious) but not anymore! They've also discontinued their burger selection and brought in some new flavor grilled ones that are just not as tempting. On the bright side, our waitress was super helpful!"
Erin C.,"Selma, CA",62,12,1,1.0,5/30/2014,"If I could give negative stars, I would!  WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT GO TO THE HANFORD APPLEBEES!!!! Tonight after graduation, we decided to get outta town figuring everything in Selma would packed... we arrived at the Hanford Applebees at about 9:30 were seated by about 10pm... WE JUST LEFT its 5 minutes until midnight!!! It took over an hour and a half to get our food, one person had to wait almost an hour just to get his drink despite reminding the waitress 4 times! It was ridiculous! Kids were falling asleep on the table waiting, and when we finally got our food, it was AWFUL! One of the kids and I didn't even touch our entrees they were gag inducing... their excuse was for taking so long was a new computer system and menu changes... either way none of us ordered anything that wasn't on the ""old"" menu... I know we could have left, but by the time we were pissed off enough to leave, nothing else was open we had to stick it out... nonetheless... AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!"
Alma M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/1/2015,We went here last night for dinner the appetizers were cold. The waitress had friends there so she was not attentive she was over with her friends a lot she got our order wrong. We asked to hold off on our food so we can get to enjoy our appetizers everthing came out together so we were crowded.
Kenzie B.,"Hanford, CA",7,28,29,5.0,12/24/2014,I love this place my mom got a gift card from here from one of the waitresses I know that work there the gift card was for my grandfather
Thelma H.,"Port Angeles, WA",155,5,,1.0,8/6/2014,"It was an awful experience. My friend and I went to the happy hour at 9 pm and we ordered the artichoke dip from the bar. The manager brings us our order with burnt cheese and stale chips. When we told him the chips were stale, he said, ""Do you want me to change it?"" DUHHHHHHHHHH......YES!!!! Who wants to eat STALE CHIPS!!! Wow! Then the manager continued to argue with us. He told us that this is how it always comes, it looks just like the picture on the menu. But if we like, he will take it away and make it 'the way we want it'.....Wow....We want it fresh and cooked right!!!!! I will NEVER RETURN to this place or any Applebees.....horrible service from the MANAGER!!!! We left, we did not have to pay for the stale chips, however, he still made us pay for the two drinks we ordered, but never had the chance to ENJOY! BYE BYE Applebees! And the funny thing is that the bartender was just as surprised by the manager's behavior as we were!"
Mystery Yelper W.,"Fresno, CA",26,27,19,1.0,3/21/2014,"Definitely not worth it, my sister and I went with a really big group. FIRST OFF, they stuck a new girl who is in training with us! NOT COOL!!!! She took about 30 minutes too get us our drinks and we only got water. I got an alcoholic drink it took her another 20 minutes to bring it. The drinks aren't even strong!!!  The food took about 2 hours to get to our table! The food was ok but seriously they were stupid prices for something that's not even good!  Also it was freezing outside and we asked politely if they turn on the heaters for us and they never answered our question if they worked or not!  Lastly, when we went to go pay for our food they didn't separate it correctly! Some of the girls didn't get any of their food, Especially the BIRTHDAY GIRL!!! That's really HORRIBLE!!!! So unorganized and like I said shouldn't have stuck a newbie for a big party.  Overall, I didn't leave a big tip she didn't deserve it! And I don't think I will go there anymore. Also if I could I would give this place ZERO STARS!!!!!"
Aaron L. H.,"Hanford, CA",35,19,1,4.0,11/12/2014,I went to this location for the first time since living in hanford on veteran's day. I'm not going to claim this service was great but it was okay. At first we sat outside and then we asked to go inside because it was cold. That was done quickly. I felt rushed the whole time because my waitress kept bringing the receipt to the table for me and my guest to pay every time we ordered something else. Other then that the wait wasn't too bad. I would go again because the food was actually pretty good.
Kim W.,"Hayward, CA",24,168,401,1.0,3/4/2014,"Car side to go is not worth it. Lol, I should know. Foods no good and the staff has been crude. Believe me I am no saint but the last two times I have been at this location (been only a total of three) the curse word have been flying. Tonight I wanted some chicken so I called ahead to get it to go. It took them three time putting me on hold to then take my order. They don't bring it out to your car like at other locations, so when I went in I stood and waited for the two young ladies with the potty mouths to wait on me. ""Did you order something?"" The one finally said after she got done fixing her hair. Now why would I be standing at the pick up place if I had not ordered yet???? She couldn't help me because she didn't take my order. Finally the manager came over and helped. Sheesh! What does a girl got to do to get her dry boneless hot wings???"
Elizabeth E.,"Hanford, CA",5,5,4,1.0,3/28/2015,"I would give this place zero stars but it makes you give at least one. The service is okay, but the food itself has been cold and over cooked the last three times we went here. We kept saying we would give them another chance, not anymore. The last time we went here, our food took over 50 minutes to get to us. When we mentioned the long wait time the waitress insisted that we hadn't waited THAT long, when we said we had waited over 45 minutes to an hour. I was thinking really?!?! You're going to argue with us that we didn't wait that long? We watched almost an entire basketball game while waiting! Then when we got our food, the steak was suppose to be cooked med-rare, which it looked like it was, BUT it was like rubber!!! Nasty cut of meat for a ridiculous amount of $$$!!! The baked potato was not even cooked all the way though, it was hard, and gross! We are so disappointed! Don't get me started on the other times we went."
Karina O.,"Coalinga, CA",30,15,2,2.0,2/19/2014,"Went there on Sunday night! Wait wasn't too bad until the end when I realized we had spent 2hrs at the restaurant! The food was definitely not what I expected, very small portion sizes, and it was not even tasteful!! We had desert and even those portion sizes were tiny and on top of that it took forever to get them! The bill was extremely high $72 really?! It was truly not worth it!! The server was nice seemed like he was new, he was a little shy, but I stilled tipped him 20% because it's not the servers fault food was taking forever!! Never blame the server for the slowness of the food!!! Will never step foot in this Applebee's again!!"
Matthew S.,"Hanford, CA",10,2,,1.0,1/4/2014,"Horrible service, wait 45 minutes to get seated then another hour to get mediocre food. Pretty much all Applebee's are the same. I only go to get rid of gift cards."
Bradford L.,"Antelope, CA",8,125,2,1.0,3/20/2014,"Ya, it's an Applebees. Obnoxiously loud country music. Mass produced food and tacky decor. Service was great!"
Rob G.,"Hanford, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/1/2014,Service sucks. Our waitress Courtney ignored us she was too busy talking to her friends. It took 30 minutes to get our desserts. The only food we ordered. And another 30 minutes to get our check. We only got our check after she heard us say if she was going to keep ignoring us.
Neisha A.,"Hanford, CA",0,25,10,1.0,8/11/2013,"This place has the worst service. I came here, and stood at the front for 15 minutes before anyone can even come ask my name to seat me. I then waited another 15 minutes for them to call my name, mind you the place was not even half full. This is the last time I come here!!"
Vence L.,"Lemoore, CA",0,3,,2.0,5/22/2014,"I ordered a 7 oz steak medium rare with veggies and loaded mashed potatoes. The steak was ok, But the veggies were definitely frozen and then microwaved. It was like chewing plastic. Everything should be fresh."
Philip L.,"El Segundo, CA",72,85,26,4.0,9/1/2011,"A decent Applebee's with a lot of shenanigans on the wall to occupy your eyes. The service is generally good and if sitting at the bar, the bartenders do a good job at keeping the drinks strong. Occasionally ""Bent Fender"" will play a show here, providing some classic rock and blues for your enjoyment out on the patio and there is all-night happy hour. That is one hell of an ""hour""!"
Ricardo M.,"Hanford, CA",17,21,3,1.0,5/9/2013,"Carpets,tables,chairs and place settings are extremely dirty.  The waiters are are inattentive to the needs of the customers.  The third time I went there took the wife and kids, and our meals were dry, burnt and no meat when it came to the ribs.  And in the end, a very expensive bill.  Strike three and Applebee's in Hanford has struck out.  Avoid this restaurant."
