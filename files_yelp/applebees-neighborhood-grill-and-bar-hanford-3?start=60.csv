Dennis H.,"Hanford, CA",9,155,16,4.0,7/14/2013,"I had a gift card to.use, so I stopped in.  Tried the roasted garlic sirloin with extra mushrooms.  Also had a bowl of French onion soup.  Everything was great!"
Gene K.,"Pacifica, CA",3,119,14,2.0,6/23/2014,"Come down to visit my Navy son and spend a lot of time at this Applebee's. Sitting at the bar, I deal with daytime bartender Nikki, who is absolutely great!!! Extremely friendly, hard working bartender. A true Pleasure!!!! Food is good and consistent...Good happy hour..(3-6 pm daily) with good appetizers/beer/ drink prices...Last visit 3/20/15.. Terrible experience..bartender Julie decided to turn her back on the bar for several minutes and have a conversation with the other bartender while my group and two other groups at the bar waited for drinks/ and to place food orders, while the useless managers stood around!! She and the other bartender were having an ongoing personal conversation which caused them to screw up my food order and forget to bring my wife water, which I had to ask for again..Another issue,ordered a chicken Asian salad for like $11 during a visit a few months ago and wasn't much to it..after this last visit, I'm done here. Would give only one star, but Nicki is great and the food is good..."
Lonny W.,"Lemoore, CA",34,167,68,3.0,5/17/2013,Family restaurant franchised ok food all cooked the same no insperation from the cook so it is standard.
Cloak D.,"Hanford, CA",0,45,5,4.0,4/3/2011,"Pros: Nice atmosphere, great servers. Cons: Sort of dirty and cluttered compared to other Applebees.   Cloak anecdote: It's confirmed: the people here think I'm a mental patient. Don't ask. Actually, do ask. It's a funny story. This place has definitely improved over the years in every way.  The servers are great, the food is good.  Although I love the decor, it's a bit too cluttered and makes the entire place feel dirty. Maybe they should tone it down a bit? Overall, I like this place and it's perfect for a night out."
Jim K.,"Los Banos, CA",0,83,5,1.0,7/23/2015,Came into this applebees at around ten thirty ran into a black hostess that had that I go to college don't need this job mentality was rude from the beginning then she looked at me and my cousin and was like you people will have to wait at the bar I said there is only two of us and many open tables she said were understaffed and can't help you people so I figured she meant the parties in line I said ok so after sitting at the bar and getting ignore for 40 minutes I finally got the old bartender who wasn't really interested at all in helping us then 20 minutes later the place was empty except for the people that walked in behind us at the tables I walked up to the hostess again and asked if I could have that table right there please she said well you people can do whatever you want now can't you I asked her what this you people crap was she said you couples then I figured it out she thought that my cousin and I were a gay couple I asked her what her problem with gay people was she said that I made her sick that it wasn't right needless to say I didn't feel the need to explain anything to her other then a couple of choice words later just sat down needless to say the old bartender decided that I wasn't in need of cooked food or any drinks then we got the are you done yet a shuffled out the door so it was an enlightening experience to say the least it left me with a funny story to tell at the family Christmas party
Sara H.,"Visalia, CA",29,15,3,1.0,6/14/2014,"Oh man! I'm with Erin C.! If there was a possibility of negative stars I'd line them up!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!! Talk about disappointing!! Sad part is, I keep giving them ""one more shot"" and STILL end up saying ""never again"". This past week was the most recent ""painful experience"". Called in for a takeout order. The girl that answered the phone was clueless. Even had to call us back later because something we ordered wasn't even on the menu anymore. She had her head in the clouds from the word go. To make matters worse she gave us the receipt, circled the survey access number and asked for ""a good review so she could make her own working hours"". Are you kidding me?! If you weren't so caught up in getting your own working hours maybe you could actually DO a GOOD job or get to know the menu. Her name was Britney, Brandy, something that started with a ""B"". The icing on the cake: got the food home and the food wasn't even what we ordered. NEVER AGAIN!!!"
David B.,"Hanford, CA",15,91,1,3.0,2/2/2012,"Just like your average Applebee's.  Not bad, but not earth-shattering, either."
Joe W.,"Westminster, CA",55,242,43,4.0,10/19/2011,Ok... The food here is pretty good and the service is pretty great.  I never eat at applebees but since there is no where else that is decent I will be coming back.  The manager even came by and asked how our meal was... I'm actually impressed.  Thus place blows away nasty a$$ chili's down the street.  Everyone seemed really happy here.. Even my mom... She is actually willing to come back...
B P.,"Palo Alto, CA",9,188,,2.0,3/24/2013,"Smoke coming out of kitchen, sprayed by a hose at the bar, understaffed, miserable caeser salad, plates not cleared on a timely basis....Not a fan. Won't be back."

Brandon T.,"Yuba City, CA",2,5,4,5.0,3/13/2011,Our server John was awesome! We had a table of six and he took our craziness like a champ! John's great personality is definitely a reason to come back for happy hour.  Happy hour.... wasn't bad but it was busy and loud at times.
Emylee Y.,"Concrete, WA",77,11,2,5.0,4/7/2011,A great resturant. Has pepsi. And very affordable for a quick date night. Highly suggest the asian chicken salad.
