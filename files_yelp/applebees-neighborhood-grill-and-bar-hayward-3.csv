Ryan A.,"Hayward, CA",154,380,169,3.0,12/22/2017,"Came here for takeout a few weeks back.  This place has always done well in Hayward at Southland Mall area.  For whatever reason it's always packed in here.   At least they're at the point now where their food quality has passed Chili's.  We got the onion rings, which were good, nacho's, good also.  Then we got a chicken dish, the one with pasta with it, it was ok, not that great.   I would come back for more togo food as I have some giftcards I need to use.  I wouldn't eat there willingly but would meet some friends for drinks there."
Robert G.,"Frederick, MD",0,2,,5.0,10/29/2017,Our car was broken into in the parking lot of this location.  It was at lunch time with people everywhere.  Hayward Police wouldn't even come out for report.  Had to submit crime report online. Contacted Applebees Corporate and they couldn't be nicer.  They agreed the Hayward Police are not doing their job.
Lynae W.,"Oakland, CA",44,156,613,2.0,10/21/2017,"First time here. Mel (our beauuuutiful Server) is very nice and accommodating,  today is her 3rd day! She is very patient & doing great.  It's not her fault that its LITERALLY 15 DEGREES in here. We had to send someone to the car to get all the coats & hats. I wish like hell I had a scarf & some gloves. The worse thing ever is too be FREEZING while you are trying to enjoy your food.  It's not her fault that the table the hostess sat us at was not prepped. No utensils, no tablet, and the tables aren't even pushed together.  Definitely not her fault that they don't have ANY sangria, that they sent my sister a Patron Margarita in a shaker with a MARTINI GLASS. Though presented and served incorrectly, the margarita was EXCELLENT! Not her fault that my dads coffee was cold as hell. I mean literally I was checking for ice cubes! Food was slow but decent. We ordered the Crunch Fried Shrimp (2), kids grill cheese sandwich w/ fries (2), and the brisket tacos w/ fries.  Again, food was good but I wont be back because I'm freezing to death while trying to enjoy my food."
Estela D.,"Hayward, CA",14,162,123,4.0,12/2/2017,"I came here with a friend on a Friday night and even though it was busy, we were seated promptly and our food and drinks came quickly as well. I ordered the three appetizers option for $13.99: spinach artichoke dip, buffalo wings and sriracha shrimp. Everything tasted great and my $1 long island was pretty good too. Our server was kind and attentive. I love applebee's appetizers and will definitely be back for a few long islands this month."
David F.,"Hayward, CA",31,2,15,5.0,11/11/2017,It was such an honor to be Honored on this Veterans Day.   Service was excellent.  Excellent variety from the Veterans menu.
Jermaine C.,"Torrance, CA",284,232,391,3.0,6/8/2017,"This review is regarding their to go services that they provide and what I witness while waiting inside the store. First, I want to start off by saying Applebees is one of those places you don't expect much from. You go in order, eat, and go home. Plain and simple. But during my visit, I think the host may have been flustered.  During our visit, we walked in and asked for a To-go menu and the host said that he'll be back to ""grab the lady that does the to go orders"". The women who helped us was very friendly and patient with us. She would probably be the only reason why my visit is rated this high. She took very good care of us. But as we were waiting for the kitchen to prepare our order, I could hear other customers complaining to the host that they were being skipped. I understand that it was a busy night but what's the point of being on the list if you're not going to follow it, especially if to parties (of the same size) are waiting for a table."
David S.,"Portland, OR",10,22,1,1.0,12/12/2017,"Wonder how an Applebee's can get only two stars with over 300 reviews. I mean it's Applebee's for gods sake. How hard can it be to follow the simple corporate guidelines and push out passable food at passable prices.  For the answer just visit this dump.  Doesn't the owner or corporate auditors care about this ? Horrid service and I mean rude, slow and dirty There are other choices in walking distance."
Tanya G.,"San Leandro, CA",0,3,,4.0,12/28/2017,"My family and I have been going to this restaurant for years. They have incredibly kind servers. I've never met an unkind server at this restaurant. They always have big, gracious smiles and very attentive to our needs, as customers. The one star is for phone orders. There are times the restaurant is inundated due to holidays or sporting events etc. I believe it was last month, their phone service was inoperable for almost two weeks. I went in to order and asked the manager why the phones weren't working? I thought they had changed their number? She explained the phones weren't working and they didn't expect to having them fixed for a few days. They weren't fixed. But I found out ordering online is absolutely fantastic. Thank you Applebee's for fantastic food and a very nice and patient staff."
Xena R.,"Hayward, CA",3,75,189,3.0,8/26/2017,"It's been awhile since we last ate here and while waiting i was reading the comments. Little disappointed that we're not all good. We were seated about 5 mins our server came over and took our drinks . Came back and ordered our food, we waited about 10-15 mins food came, it was okay for the size portion and the prize. Server very attentive and nice took care our needs. Overall it was a good experience.. hoping they won't be included to the closure that was recently announced."
Ben F.,"San Leandro, CA",143,4,,2.0,10/24/2017,App was gross chips were stale spinach dip was nast the waitress was really nice though I didn't catch a name  I wouldn't come here at night
Melissa A.,"San Ramon, CA",5,8,11,1.0,4/26/2017,I ordered Cedar salmon with maple glaze. What I got looked nothing like the picture. My salmon was very small and overcooked/burnt. The people behind me also thought the same about their food. I heard them complaining to the manager.
Alejandra D.,"Chino, CA",0,24,2,1.0,6/14/2017,Worst service. Never received our food. Husband never got his drink. I got one glass of water. After 45 mins! Server kept walking by and not acknowledging that we were asking her for our drinks or refill to water. To be fair it seemed like she had zero support from other staff including the manager.  Our kids order was placed at the same time as the order for our drinks. Never received her meal. 1.5 hours later and we finally had enough.  We will never return here and advice our family and friends to do the same.
K D.,"Pleasanton, CA",81,42,11,1.0,10/7/2017,"We went last night, the server was no where to be found, my food was ice cold, like they didn't even heat it up, took 35 min to get a Pepsi a FREAKING Pepsi, the $1 margarita was just mix. So bad. So so so bad"
Heather D.,"Oakland, CA",0,44,11,2.0,6/26/2017,"Two stars for our server....zero stars for our food!   What's up with this place??!  I've been to other Applebee's locations and the food wasn't this horrible. My husband and I were not in the mood for a big meal due to the weather...we were having a heatwave. My husband ordered soup and salad. How can you mess this up, right? His soup (French onion) was disgusting! Tasted like it was some soup mix type or something. His salad was just a heap of greens and a few croutons.  I was a little more hungry so I got the BBQ ribs. My sides were their 'new' garlic green bean thing...there was nothing on my green beans! Tasted like microwaved frozen green beans. I also got the baked potato. It was an actual baked potato...SURPRISINGLY! On to the BBQ ribs...omg! Horrible! Completely dry, chewy, bland, overcooked...shall I go on?  I don't like cookie cutter restaurants. This experience proves why."
Allen G.,"San Leandro, CA",0,7,,2.0,4/9/2017,"Just ate here for the first time. My wife and I were the first customers there at 11:00am opening. We asked for a booth and told booth's are not open yet ""What?"" anyway the menu is not the same as posted online. After exploring they NEW menus (2) of them. My wife made a choice only to find out she could not have because it was on the ""2 for $25.00"" menu that didn't have what I wanted . . .  So she settled for something else that was sirloin bit's over rice, and I ordered the Triple Bacon Hamburger. The wife's plate didn't have enough rice (she is Asian) . . . Finally had to stop another waiter to order extra rice . .  that took another 15 minutes waiting as her plate got cold . .  and I struggled to woof down the driest burger I have ever had watching our waiter give booth's to other couple . .  strange? After a 10 minute wait to pay our bill, and finally flagging down another waiter for our total, my wife insisted leaving a $2.00 tip . . . OK :-)  maybe they will get the message? About the only good thing to come of dinning at Applebee's is that my wife was so upset she cancelled going shopping after we ate . . . God only knows how much that saved me :-) won't be going back to an Applebee's any time soon . . . . . . . . .  :-("
Katherine S.,"Hayward, CA",139,2,,1.0,10/5/2017,"My fiance and I went in for a late lunch date,  there were tables around the bar that were open I asked the hostess if we come sit there and was told there was a wait list so we put our names on the list, we sat there for about 10min, another couple walks in and was given a sit right a way in the same location I just asked about. Went to AJ and told him what happen he sat us down right a way. We sat there for another 15min and only got water. By the time the waiter walked by and said he would be right with us after he places the order of the couple that cane in after us by that time I was ready to go so we walked out"
Ricardo R.,"Oakland, CA",159,4,,5.0,9/13/2017,"Damonique was a great server! My family came in for my brothers birthday today 9/13/17, and everything was great. Damonique was friendly, fast, and easy going. Would definitely come again, especially if Damonique would be my server."
Pradeep D.,"Hayward, CA",24,89,7,5.0,8/16/2017,"Gave this place a second chance, jasmine was our server and did an awesome job, got everything right from the food to the refills. You've earned a customer now."
Jessica C.,"San Ramon, CA",15,159,5,1.0,7/16/2017,"this applebee's is awful. the last two times i have come has been the worse service ever.  first time: we got seated right away. after ten minutes of waiting and not being acknowledged, i was about to walk out. my husband ordered a club soda. i ordered a water and my son a lemonade. my husband got his club soda & that was it. i waited five minutes until i asked for my sons lemonade and my water. we finally got it. we ordered an appetizer and meals. our meals came and no appetizer. i mentioned it to our server and she said she forgot and asked if we still wanted it. uh, yes. we did order it.  second time: just as bad. also, seriously i don't like paying on that stupid machine that's on each table. and the push you to pay on it. WE DON'T WANT TO!  i won't be coming to this applebee's again. one star because obviously we can't give zero (yelp really needs to fix that) but also because michelle that works there is nice. i think she's the manager."
Ciarra C.,"Hayward, CA",81,43,52,1.0,2/17/2017,"Applebees is just one of those places you don't expect much experience from, except exceptional food. It's been about a month now that we HAVE NOT received a promised a gift card by management for missing items in our order. The management blamed the new chef and then offered a gift card. We provided the details she needed and called a week later to follow up. None of her other mgt team knew who we were. They said there were no notes on this incident and they would call back. Another week later still no call so we called back. She said she found our email and had it under an S and not C. This time she said we should get it. Well, Here we are a month later still haven't received anything,  nor am I interested at this point."
jeff B.,"San Lorenzo, CA",7,17,8,5.0,2/3/2017,We had two gift cards for this place and wanted to use them while we were in area. Ordered 2 for $25 and 1/2 rack of ribs Food was more than we could eat ! We had leftovers for few days. The on table computer lets you order and pay bill easily.
Raul B.,"North Valley, San Jose, CA",266,4,1,5.0,3/28/2017,Through out the time we where there we had a very good service... I ask if I can get my son food first because he was already hungry and they did. I enjoy my food with my family.
Ernesto R.,"Hayward, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/12/2017,First and last time coming here! Everything  is just disgusting.  Price is very high for some poor quality food. Waited over 30 min. Asked for a burger w no sauce and the first thing i get is with sauce.
Edith B.,"Oakland, CA",0,4,11,1.0,8/20/2017,"bad place !! for my son's birthday  we came to eat and we waited 47 minutes for our food. The waiter kept skipping us, we left because after waiting for so long they brought us the wrong order. terrible place first and last time coming here."
Joseph M.,"Hayward, CA",60,68,498,5.0,2/1/2017,Sandra is amazing. Has always been. Every time she is here my experience is better. Thank you for always providing excellent service!
Micole B.,"Oakland, CA",3,25,14,1.0,8/6/2017,"First off. The waitress rushed us to order. We had a party of 7 and we're waiting for the last 2 to arrive. She came to our table 6 times in 10 minutes asking us if we ready. Then suggested we order for them. It was 10pm on a Fire Tuesday night. There were no other guest. Then once the party arrived and we ordered about 7 minutes later, the waiter never came back. They gave us wrong orders, the food was dry ass hell, and the waitress seem to only needed a tip. Wont be going back."
Jezelle S.,"Hayward, CA",142,146,313,3.0,11/22/2016,"Let's be real here. This isn't The Cheesecake Factory. Don't come here expecting a five-star diner experience. This is Applebee's. 2 for $20, 2 for $25. Applebee's is like a ballin on a budget restaurant. Late night movie and dinner typa thang so you can't knock em! The way I see it is like this.. I won't spend so much money on a place that doesn't hold their end of the stick. What I mean by that is, service wise, the cleanliness of the place, and the overall ambience. I wasn't looking for anything fancy, but if I were, I would go all out. But that wasn't the case and me and babe are ballin.. on a budget!    Anyways, came here Friday night with my boyfriend because we were oh so hungry. He wanted to go to a sit down restaurant and this was one of the places open. It was a bit late so our choices were limited. It was nice inside, but could've been more organized. Many drunk folks at the bar. Wasn't packed in the seating areas. Our server did take pretty long. It seems like I always have that issue at Applebee's. They need to get it together. Lol, I've been to Applebee's one other time before and I love the 2 for $20. I already knew what I had wanted. Yup, we did the 2 for $20.  I got the chicken cavatappi pasta. Pretty good. Felt like the chicken was skimped, but everybody be doin that!! Babe for some lemon chicken or something like that. That was actually quite great. I kept picking off his plate lol. Our appetizer was mozzarella sticks! I highly recommend that. Ooey gooey cheese and marinara sauce? Yes!!! Count me IN."
Debbie S.,"Hayward, CA",14,9,5,1.0,6/16/2017,"Bad service again tonight at Applebee's. After ordering and waiting for 45 minutes we had to ask where our salads. They served my salad on a piping hot plate, when I said the plate is too hot and this is a cold salad I was told ""well I'm really busy and it's gonna be a while"" so I told him I wasn't going to eat the salad, next they bring out my dinner which was the caprese chicken which I've had before and it's delicious and beautiful, and it looked like dog food, absolutely atrocious. So a manager was asked to speak with us, but instead went about taking care of receipts, and then when he did come to talk to us, he was clueless.  I was so angry I had to leave the restaurant and my husband had to take care of the bill. We did not get to eat our dinner, and are leaving HUNGRY. Run the other way people run the other way and go to any other restaurant."
Shelley C.,"Hayward, CA",52,21,,1.0,12/14/2017,"Every time we come here we have a bad experience.  We keep saying that we won't be back, and then they have some promotion that sucks us back in.  They were training someone so we had 2 servers, but it was clear right from the start, that they were more interested in training the new person than giving customer service.  It took at least 10 minutes to get our drink order and then we got a phone call about something which required us to have to hurry up and leave, so we told them we were kind of in a hurry because we had to go pick up our car before the place closed.  It obviously made no difference to them, service was SLOW, obviously because of the trainee.  We could see them struggling with the computer that places the order.  I ordered the special steak with potato topper, and when she read my order back, it was completely wrong!  I just told you what I wanted, you were obviously not paying attention and wrote down whatever you wanted to write down.  Later, they offered to fill my hubby's iced tea, and they never brought it back.  When we asked about it, they stated that they were busy running food!  Well, duh!  Isn't that what a restaurant is supposed to do!  We had to beg for our check, and the whole thing was just a disaster as far as service goes.  That waitress is never going to make it in this business!"
William B.,"Discovery Bay, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/20/2017,"This is one of the WORST Applebees in the Bay area! We started we being sat at a dirty table. Then were only brought 2 waters, not 3(there was 3 of us). I ordered a side salad,  and specifically requested my salad BEFORE the main course. Not only did it NOT come before, I was halfway done with my meal before I reminded our server. On top of it all, our food was served and we STILL had not gotten our silverware,  after asking 3 different people.  DON'T COME TO THIS APPLEBEES.  IT IS THE WORST!!"
Tamu V.,"Oakland, CA",247,78,90,1.0,4/20/2017,"My friend and I choose this Applebee's because it is near our school and we have gone to this location before after class to unwind after a struggling day of electronics. We entered the restaurant and no one was there to greet us. We then walked over to a booth while making eye contact with the staff over by the bar. I then run off to the bathroom and upon my return my friend is sitting at the booth with just her menu and no waters. It looked as though she was never acknowledged.  She began asking me questions about happy hour and I responded with ""the waiter didn't tell you about happy hour specials?"" She said no one has come over yet. At this time we had been there for about 10 minutes. This isn't the first time my friend exclaimed, they always treat us bad in here! I looked over at the bar and I seen two (which looked like waiters) standing over by the bar looking at us. By this time we both realized we didn't want to sit there continuously waiting and not being waited on or seeing anything on the menu that we wanted at the time so by the 15 minute mark we were out of there! The staff needs training and the Manager does also. This was very unprofessional and it was done to a Yelper! You never know who is walking through the doors of your establishment. It didn't seem as though they cared about who walked through their establishment. I didn't feel like I wanted to Return AFTER I left.  So we left without being able to unwind sad to say."
Juli C.,"Hayward, CA",0,56,25,3.0,10/6/2017,Jasmine was incredible. Quick to our needs.  Margaritas for one dollar. Yes One dollar that's correct. Food was OK and came out a little slow but definitely worth it.
Alex H.,"San Jose, CA",304,5,,1.0,6/18/2017,Took like 10 minutes to get seated when there were many tables availavle. Food took 45 minutes- an hour first off. When it arrived it was only semi warm as if it had been sitting out in the kitchen unnoticed. Our server was nowhere to be found most of the time. Drink was forgotten about. At one point the host was the one serving food which was very strange.
Steven C.,"Ontario, CA",13,5,,1.0,6/14/2017,I have been sitting at my table now for 30 min with my wife and daughter we have gotten 2 of the 3 appetizers we ordered 1 glass of water and 1 juice for my daughter and have asked for a refill 3x now
Martha Z.,"San Leandro, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/3/2017,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED!!!!!!!!!!!! There was a spider in my drink & neither the server or the manager NOT ONCE apologize for my experience. The manager sanja didnt even come to the table to check if i was okay the whole time i was there. Instead he refused to serve my table after i expressed my frustration. Im a waitress myself and i am SO DISAPPOINTED & UPSET with my experience at applebees!!!!
Jackie Z.,"Novato, CA",23,2,,1.0,10/9/2017,"Visited this Applebee's in Hayward.  What an awful experience.  After ordering drinks before our food, the appetizers came with the entrees, & no drinks!  When they did come, one drink that should have had mint with it, did not.  The cheeseburger ordered had the incorrect cheese on it.  It wasn't the fault of our waitress, who did apoligize, it was the bar & kitchen.  The manager was not being attentive to customer service.  Lots of guests waiting, yet we saw empty tables.  We will not go here again.  Our Applebee's in San Rafael is very good."
Isela M.,"Hayward, CA",6,16,6,1.0,2/17/2017,So my husband and I came here on a Friday at about 3:30pm the place was dead. There was only like two other tables that had people seated. The service was extremely slow. I have no idea why but it took about 20 minutes for the waiter to put in the order for our drinks another 15 minutes for the drinks to come out at this point we were just fed up and paid for our drinks and left this place. I will never return to this crazy ass location.
Dalton C.,"Hayward, CA",55,3,,2.0,10/23/2016,"Bartender Review"" This is for Danielle. All night she pretty much has been loudly negative, causing a lot of attention on herself. Her drinks were okay-got the Daculas juice. She was really rude to her coworkers and also her manager . It was just a loud inappropriate scene that made me feel like I wasted money on booze and should have relaxed at home. She also mocked about the customer on the phone."
Shawn A.,"Dublin, CA",53,25,2,5.0,4/20/2017,Great Service! Mac was our server and he was fabulous. Quick service and made sure our food came out tastey. Went the extra mile and brought out extra fries! Wonderful employee to have on the team!
Yessica V A.,"Oakland, CA",0,3,4,1.0,5/21/2017,"Customer service is horrendous. Half empty and it took 15 minutes to be seated,  once seated 20 minutes go by with out a waiter coming by, not even drink orders no water or anything. Get up to get a waiter and ask politely to see if someone could please come to our table and take our order. Waiter says they'll get our waiter, 10 minutes go by and NO ONE has yet to come, Girl I asked to get someone to please take our order is flirting at the bar with some other waiter instead of helping anyone or getting anyone to come help. Got up and left. NEVER coming here again, worst experience I've had at an Applebee's."
