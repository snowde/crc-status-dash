Dagmara J.,"Walnut Creek, CA",107,20,28,4.0,11/2/2012,"We love the hostess Carmen and her daughter.  Usually we go there for happy hour because prices are really affordable specially for the tasty food.  Fridays evening bartenders are the best EVER! :) You can get a big drink for 5 dollars or huge beer for 3.50 $ . We make there some friends ,but there is also a huge amount of ghetto people coming in and that's why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5.  P.S I dont really like the music,because I am not a big fan of hip hop."
Kenny C.,"Oakland, CA",28,223,45,4.0,1/12/2011,"Applebee's has a sweet late night happy hour with great deals. Well drinks $3, wonton tacos $1, sliders $1 and jello shots $1.00. They also have other items on the happy hour list but these are the best items on the happy hour menu besides the boneless wings. The late night happy hour is from 9pm-12am and surprisingly the bar area is never full when I go. The staff is always attentive and the service is fairly quick.  Since they started the late night happy hour I refuse to go to Applebees during any other time. This is a great place for you to hangout with all your friends and eat and drink good for less then $20!"
Nicole G.,"Tracy, CA",97,10,257,1.0,2/23/2014,Ummmm Jell-O shots being passed around as if I'm at a Dim Sum!!!! No thanks Never Ever!!!
Mendy _.,"San Leandro, CA",44,46,,4.0,4/9/2012,"I seriously don't know why this place is getting such low ratings. People on Yelp! seriously need a wake up call because I'm starting to think that they wouldn't know good food if it hit them in the face. Mind you, I came on a Thursday night with a couple of friends. We were originally gonna go down the street to Mimi's Cafe but it was closed. I had my qualms with this Applebee's because their food absolutely sucked in the past. I hadn't been to this place in about 6 years since then. Until now. The place was PACKED on a Thursday night. But we were able to get a seat in a matter of 10 minutes.  The vibe of this place was really cool too, just a great place to hang out with friends or grab a beer and watch the game. We ordered a sampler trio, and the Appetizer + 2 Entrees for $20. In the sampler trio, we had the Steak Towers, Chicken Wonton Tacos, and Boneless Buffalo Wings. I didn't get to try the steak towers but the tacos and wings were great. The taco was really fresh and had grilled chicken inside it, drizzled with a sweet and sour sauce. The wings were really tender and juicy, but crisp on the outside. For the appetizer we had the Spinach & Artichoke Dip which was just creamy and flavorful. It was probably one of the better dips I had in a chain restaurant. For my entree, I had the Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp, which was just absolutely amazing. I always dread ordering chicken breast from these chain restaurants because they usually come out dry and cardboard-like. Until this dish at Applebee's, I used to swear to Olive Garden's chicken entrees, because their chicken was really tender. But this just changed everything. The red-skin potatoes were so good, with the carmelized onions and mushrooms in the bourbon glaze. The bourbon glaze was just perfect flavor for this dish. And topping it with the shrimp and garlic-herb butter was like the cherry on top.  We were stuffed and didn't get to have dessert but I will DEFINITELY be coming back to this Applebee's. It's NOT the BEST FOOD IN THE WORLD, but it excels in its category. And it DEFINITELY REDEEMED ITSELF from its horrid past, hands down. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the service took a while, but that was only because it was just super busy. Our waitress was really nice and patient with us because we couldn't decide what to order from their new and improved, yet HUGE menu. Come to this Applebee's!"
Karen L.,"Murphys, CA",122,88,35,3.0,5/14/2014,"This is where I meet for a weekly GNO...at least this is where we start. We like the bartender ""Dougie-Poo"". He treats us girls really well. The food is, well, you already know. We don't go for dinner, we go to drink and have a fun Girls Night Out. And this place is great for that because the bar has ample space for everyone. Friendly and Fun! That's what this is all about."
Simon F.,"San Lorenzo, CA",51,500,3314,3.0,12/1/2011,"[Part 2 of 2] Like at the Union City location, there's a ""101 Dalmatians"" poster here (still, there are some items unique to this location). My wife and I counted the dogs in the past, but this time I could barely see the poster from where I was sitting, and my wife didn't even notice it. After eating here, I was full, but not quite satisfied. Big eaters like me should stay away."
Angela B.,"Castro Valley, CA",3,11,,1.0,8/10/2014,Horrible service. Our waitress had no personality and took forever to bring us anything. She forgot the appetizer and seemed miffed when we cancelled it since we already had our food (brought by someone else.) We had to ask another server so we could finally get our bill and leave. Lame.
Ramesh S.,"Hayward, CA",1,19,,5.0,9/3/2015,Alex was out hostess and performed a great job. She seemed to know what we wanted before hand. Im sure she received great training.  Thanks for your service.
Mc C.,"San Leandro, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/2/2015,Ordered food and when it came it was cold usually food is steaming warm but when it cane to our table food was cold even the wings were dry and it looked like it was old wings heated up and they just added buffalo seasoning on it and the other entries were cold as well never coming back here again
Kean T.,"San Mateo, CA",30,6,16,4.0,11/29/2012,"Best Hot wing in the area so far. Especially when it's consistent with every order. Place an order to go for a craving wife at 10:30 pm. When she crave for hot wing, it better be HOT WING with bone, not that chicken nugget in hot sauce crap. The gentlemen who took the order did not specify if I want with or without bone. I assume it would be with bone(typical), he assumed boneless. big mistake. Brought home to discover it was boneless. That did not go well with the wife. Immediately called call back and the gentlemen offer to redo the order. This is after closing time. Thanks to Applebee's great customer service, wife is satisfy. Will definitely come back just for the hot wing."
Henry M.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,5,7,1.0,4/1/2012,"This place Is not good at all..   First of all waited 20 minutes for a table then waited for our drinks about 20 minutes.  Food took like 30 minutes I ordered some shrimp pasta that they don't even have anymore so I ordered the mushroom steak (medium). I asked the waitress if it was salty and she said, no is not.  When the food actually arrived my steak was medium well almost well done and salty as  heck. My buddy's pasta was dry. I could tell it was dry from across the table. We were there for over 2 hours for dinner.  This place sucks, will not return..   There were other people complaining of their food. One of the waiters dropped some food on the floor and left it there.  It wasn't picked up for over 30 minutes"
Taurus R.,"Oakland, CA",9,28,6,4.0,9/9/2012,"I've been to the happy hour twice. If you sit at the bar they have a menu of half priced beer, cocktails, and appetizers.  I pay attention to the small things. The bar area where we sat hadn't been wiped so I had to ask the bartender to handle that before we ordered.  Once we were served our food was good, no complaints. The beer my husband ordered was cool, not cold. My pom martini was wonderful. This has become our late nite spot to eat and have a few drinks because can kick it for under $30."
Sandy B.,"San Leandro, CA",17,24,8,1.0,4/27/2014,Wow..the service is horrible. Definitely is not the place to be for a quick dinner out..
Terrence P.,"San Leandro, CA",4,79,2,1.0,7/12/2014,"My bad for returning. The last time I been was four years ago, so of course the last visit was totally unforgotten. Went with my Mom & Son. Sucked! The first thing I noticed was the Manager was in his waitresses faces. He flirted the whole entire time with them. Not once did he welcome the guest or come over to say hello or ask how our visit was going. My mom mentioned how she did not like the service. Immediately, I knew it was a flaw starting from the manager. Sad case, but I won't be returning. I will be contacting corporate."
Hillary H.,"Atlanta, GA",926,220,77,1.0,7/8/2011,"Don't you go to a bar to have a drink? Well not at this place unless you have a ""Table"" ....Kinda dumb if you ask me(Since we had a 20minute wait), but apparently when you are trying to order a drink from their bar the manager, as well as the bartender will both tell you,""Im busy and you're going to have to wait"" Whoa Im sorry, but isn't your job to serve and satisfy the customers, correct me if Im wrong but you guys have the absolute wrong idea about customer service here. #RUDE..... A group of us have been stopping by occasionally to catch their late night Happy Hour and food specials which are Awesome!!   After we were finally seated and served we had  a server named Angel as our server who was in fact an absolute Angel whicht is the only reason for the one star!! I understand it can be kinda hectic and annoying to serve a big party, but she was fantastic!! She brought our drinks and food as fast as we ordered them, and had all of our orders placed correctly!! Good job girl!!  The food was actually pretty good. We ordered a bunch of apps and entrees and all of the above had no complaints. It stinks to have good food and drinks at a place with poor hospitality. Not sure if we will come back anymore due to the horrible service to begin with from the manager Alex and bartender on duty...Hopefully Angel makes it to another dining spot because she was great, but her peers ehhhh...Not so much..."
Yaneth E.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,123,3,3.0,7/1/2011,"Two words... HAPPY HOUR, HAPPY HOUR, HAPPY HOUR! :) If you want a place to hang out and have some decent drinks with some decent appetizers, this is def the place to be. I've only been in the bar area so my experience with the customer service has been very good."
Lori L.,"Alameda, CA",82,213,37,4.0,4/26/2012,"I don't know why, but for some reason Applebee's is so different during Late Nite! The place was full and lively. Everyone's relaxing and having a good time. If you sit in the bar area, you get 1/2 off appetizers and maybe some of the drinks. Service was flexible and accommodating when we asked to move to the bar area.  Ordered four appetizers - Queso blanco, Won Ton Tacos, Honey BBQ Boneless Wings, and Mozzarella sticks (to share of course. No way can I eat all of that!). All were so good and filling.  The Queso Blanco was our new fav. Nice and spicy and it stayed hot all the way to the end (I've had experiences where my spinach dip got cold at Applebee's before). The Chicken Won Ton Tacos were very flavorful and crispy and something I haven't seen anywhere else (you get four of them!). The Meaty Boneless Wings and the Mozzarella sticks were good as always.  The last few times I've been to Late Nite has been a positive experience. Definitely check it out (ask to sit in the bar area)!"
Isabella T.,"Castro Valley, CA",1,7,,1.0,6/14/2015,We went in on June 10th at 1:30 pm we waited for a server to approach us for 40 minutes or more. We waited because the graduate boys wanted to eat there other then that we would have left. Our server was very overwhelmed and slow. We never seen a manager and no one else came to help. I have never waited so long for orders to be taken. Very bad experience and I blame it on management that we never seen. I will not go back. What happened to this place ??????? Its to bad.
Miguel L.,"San Lorenzo, CA",0,2,,2.0,7/26/2015,"The food is mediocre, the potato they gave was not Cooked it was like eating an apple although the steak I had was good and the shrimps. Also they don't bother to ask if you want refills."
Richard C.,"Daly City, CA",99,133,,4.0,4/6/2014,The food is hella good and the service is not bad at all. I eat here once in awhile when I'm in the area. There used to be an Applebee's at the Westlake Shopping Center near where I live but that location close before the Westlake was remodeled.
