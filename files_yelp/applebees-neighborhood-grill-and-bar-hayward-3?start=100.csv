Yen Y.,"Hayward, CA",4,63,,1.0,9/15/2016,Cold French onion soup? Really? It's been a long time since we were here. We were hoping when they renovated d place the service has improved. Sadly it didn't   Food sucks too. Guess won't be coming back here again.
David A.,"East Bay, CA",8,52,8,5.0,4/13/2016,The waiter Kimberly is awesome and very cool!! She's very humble and made me laugh as well. I would love to come back to this Applebee's again. There food was just good and I loved it a lot. Thank you again Applebee's
faye b.,"Hayward, CA",51,17,33,4.0,3/6/2016,"The best part is the atmosphere. The place is spacious and roomy. My waitress was nice and my order came out timely. We ordered ribs & Mac & cheese. They tasted good. We also ordered a steak. Not so good. It was very tough. Other than that, we enjoyed it."
Brie M.,"Merced, CA",0,8,,1.0,5/27/2015,"ZERO STARS This place is just horrible horrible horrible. We should in the front(the only 2 people in the lobby) for 5 mins while several waiters and the bar tender looked directly at us without getting the hostess). When we were finally seated it took another 10 mins for our waitress to come over to take our drink orders. Long story short the overall service was unacceptable and I will not be returning. Also told talk to the night manager, you can clearly tell he has no backbone and completely gets walked all over. Shitty service"
Sheryl M.,"Danville, CA",110,374,55,1.0,10/6/2014,"I hardly ever eat at fast food restaurants (trust me, fast in reference to this place is just a label) but on 10-05-2014, I sacrificed.  This place is lacking leadership and organization.  There were (3) of us and this was our experience.   We ordered (2) appetizers, (3) entrees, (2) beers and a mixed drink.   Food/drink review: They advertised 24-7 happy hour with Bud Light and Coors Light being the selections.  We ordered Coors Light, because, well, Bud Light is nasty.  One person ordered a margarita.   One hour later, we finally were told they did not have Coors Light.  We were given no alternative except Bud Light.  We opted for micro brews. Oh, and this is when we got a glass of water we had asked for one hour earlier.    My beer had a napkin or something is it.  Rather gross, but since it took over an hour to get it, I fished that sucker out and drank it.  My friends margarita was watered down. The food: The appetizers came after the entrees (about one hour and and fourth-five minutes after being seated).  The entrees were warm but not hot.  They forgot (1) appitizer so it came way after the entrees and the other late appetizer.   The server was nice, but in no way offered to compensate us for EVERYTHING being wrong.  I even pointed out the gross chunk of napkin (?) in my beer.  He left us in the middle of service to bartend.  We had to flag down another server to get our bill paid.  I eventually walked over to the bar to finalize things with the server.     In all, we were there for about (3) hours.   It is a good thing I enjoyed my company because everything else was a major FAIL!"
Mariano P.,"Compton, CA",0,1,,2.0,10/15/2016,The worst service I've ever had.  Slow to start with. It took our sever 15 minutes to get to our table. Drinks very slow also. And our server didn't even know what a jack Daniels neat was. Very disappointed over all. Will not come back to this place ever again.
M R.,"Austin, TX",12,9,1,5.0,12/19/2015,I just came in for a random brunch and found this place. The server was awesome! Food came on-time and they are finger licking good! Must come and experience guy!!
Julian T.,"Long Beach, CA",487,371,728,1.0,12/15/2013,"Wanted to get some soup here ToGo, but couldn't even because I was basically being ignored the whole time.  Came in, looked at the menu and waited. I let a family before me get helped first because I was still looking. Once I got a hostess to help me (it was not crowded at all!) she told me to go to the bar to put my order in. Once I got there, the bartender saw me, ignored me, then walked away. Sat for five minutes, continued getting ignored, so I left.  Not busy restaurant at all, stupid service, and they need to get themselves together."
BRANDI P.,"Hayward, CA",4,68,4,1.0,2/6/2016,"How do you go here on a mid Saturday and have to wait 20 minutes, there are so many empty tables. Crazy. We told them we had a large party yet they didn't give us enough tables. They are so slow, we sat at empty tables for another 30 minutes, no drinks no server, nothing! This makes no since what so ever. An hour or so after sitting here we finally got our food which was very bland. We had 5 different servers, all who were slow and with attitudes because the first lady that took our order didn't get everything that we ordered and ended up bringing us the wrong drinks and foods. It was all over the place. Don't make the same mistake wr did. Was great to be with family and friends but sucked to deal with these people. It was a MESS."
Lily V.,"Santa Clara, CA",324,265,40,1.0,4/6/2013,"This place is the worst Applebee's I've been to.  OUTRAGEOUSLY SLOW SERVICE. So, my boyfriend and I went here for a late night dinner since it was right next to the Carnival that we were at. Without checking yelp, since it was convenient, we just walked in expecting okay service and decent food! OH BOY, WERE WE SOOOOO WRONG!  We were seated right when we walked through the door. There wasn't much of a crowd since it was a Sunday night. Sat down, wait for literally 30 minutes or more to get our order taken. We were talking a lot, so we didn't notice the time until like 30 minutes marked, we looked at our cell phones and was like WTH?! We waved down another waiter who was kind enough to take our order.....WTF, it look them another 45 minutes to bring out an order of Spinach & Artichoke Dip and Grilled Jalapeno Lime Shrimp. They came back to us saying that they messed up our order, so that was why they took so long to bring it out. THE FOOD WAS COLD! There was no artichoke that can be identify in the dip....and it was all bad. Who can messed up an  Spinach & Artichoke Dip? This applebee's apparently. The Shrimp wasn't bad, but it supposedly took this dish 45 minutes to get out of the kitchen. It wasn't worth the wait. We demand to talk to the manager after we took like 3 bites. Saying we aren't going to pay and it was bad service on their part. Manager said, hey you waited and you ate the food. Nothing  he can do about it. WOW!! We paid and left. Didn't even wanted to finish the disgusting place food.  Went to Carl's Jr after, I swear even a fast food restaurant food is worth eating! Faster service, probably better service, hot food, and it tastes better!"
Eugene L.,"East Bay, CA",2440,1843,67221,3.0,3/23/2011,I was out with some of the Brothers and we were craving a late night snack and Dessert after our Sushi Dinner. So we rolled to Applebees . This one stays open very late . We wandered in and it was Packed !! There were even people playing Beer Pong.  This Applebees felt like a Singles Club  there where Packs of Girls Munching out even a few Cougars prowling aroound. We were seated very  fast . Then have a late night Happy Hour at this Applebees so I went with 2 Pork Sliders and a Ice Cream Oreo Dessert. It was interesting in this Applebees they were even Cranking Hip Hop. My food arrived 15 Minutes later. The Sliders were a nice snack and the Ice Cream Oreo Dessert was a nice Decadent Rich Treat.   Ice Cream we all Scream for Ice Cream!!!
Taylor J.,"Hayward, CA",151,56,31,4.0,10/16/2014,"I meant to write this review on Monday but forgot, came here at 1030pm for happy hour. A very last minute decisions since my birthday was at midnight even tho we had work and school the next day we wanted to go out and celebrate a little. The bar was not too busy, but not dead. The bartender was on point. We ordered a rum and coke, two pitchers of beer, and a hennesy shot. It was my birthday after all! It got close to 12 and we were the second to last people in there but the bartender as he was closing gave us a corona and glass of wine on the house. I'm sure he knew why we were there but it made the night feel that much more special. We will be back!  Last night I ordered to go to pick up after class, the host was super friendly and got my order out and ready in 5 Mins even though I was 10 Mins early then pick up time! Food was okay. But the service is what will have me coming back!"
Antonio G.,"Los Angeles, CA",59,1,,1.0,9/25/2016,"very poor customer service by the hostess (racist) She yelled at me, she didn't put  my name on the waiting list,  the manager did nothing about it, la hostess era una Afroamericana"
Sarah F.,"Hayward, CA",0,9,,1.0,3/26/2016,"I disagree with the OVERALL 2 star review for this establishment. This ""restaurant"" deserves a ONE star AT BEST. I just received the WORST service in my ENTIRE 25 years of being alive. I work in a service industry that is highly graded on customer service and I don't even get tips. If I had talked to a customer the way I was spoken to, I would have my head chewed out by my customers. My party of 5 that consisted of my parents, brother, 1 year old child and I walked into this Applebee's and there was no host standing at the podium. It took 5 minutes to be acknowledged by anyone. When we were actually acknowledged, I'm not even sure that that individual was actually a host. If he was, he was a joke. He tried to seat just my brother and I without asking us how many people were in our party. He realized that there were 4 and a baby. He said the wait will be ""10 minutes"". I asked if he wanted my name so he could call us up. He said that he will remember us. Oh, and because they ran out of ink at the host station... How do you run out of ink? Run your business better!! Do you not have pens to sign credit card receipts or will you just remember that each customer paid their bill based on the honor system? At least pretend to care, find a pen or a marker, and write down my name, dude. There were 2 families ahead of us. 30 minutes and 4 parties that came in after us later, we got seated. Our server, Karen B, took our drink orders. 2 lemonades and 2 waters. 10 minutes later, she took our order. She brought us 4 waters and had to go back for our lemonades. 20 minutes later, we had not received our appetizers and the party that came in after us received their bar drinks and their appetizers and entrees. We told her that we were going to leave and our appetizers actually made it to our table at this time. She told me that it has not been a long wait and that dinner takes 15 to 20 minutes to come out, with the biggest attitude. I told her that we had been here for that entire duration and that that party received their entire meal before us. Apparently, according to Karen, they were a party of two and that why they got their food before us. If dinner takes 15 to 20 minutes, why haven't I gotten my appetizers during that time frame? Also, it was definitely not busy at this dinner service. Half the restaurant was empty. Needless to say, we left.  The ONLY thing that was decent here was the Manager On Duty. I don't know his name but he took care of the appetizers that we didn't touch and our lemonades. He was a really nice guy.  Owner: you need to revamp your entire staff (minus that manager on duty) because they are incompetent or close down this establishment."
Jenae G.,"Irvine, CA",236,6,57,1.0,8/27/2015,"Came in to have dinner with my parents. We ordered, the waiter was nice. Then dun, dun, dun...we waited for over 45 minutes just for Spinach Dip, which hadn't even come out yet! Safe to say we dipped. Hopefully the staff can eat the spinach to strengthen their service game. #justsayin"
Anna C.,"Dallas, TX",8,241,139,2.0,4/29/2013,"The food is just average. It is about what you get at any other Applebees. It is not fresh nor do they offer amazing deals. Simply because of the lack of freshness and quality of food, I don't think it is an ideal place for a good meal. I don't mind greasy food and enjoy the occasional cheap eats, however, I don't really enjoy this place too much.  I had the orange chicken which was fried glazed with sweet sauce. The chicken is good (I don't know how to complain against fried food.. its just so yummy no matter what). The rice pilaf that came with it was watery and the veggies mixed in was unrecognizable. I was more surprise at the presentation though; it looked like the chef just dumped them on the plate carelessly. I wish they would have at least placed it with some more thought...  I would give the service 5 stars. The staff were attentive and very nice; contrary to what people say here. They were very accomodating. Service wasn't that slow either."
Kyra S.,"Union City, CA",505,410,1205,5.0,7/12/2014,I  had great service here. My server is Krystyana and she serves with a smile. I love the fact that they haver the under 550 menu. And I love the  two for and 20 or 2 for 25. That includes an appetizer and 2 entrées. There were a lot of people here food was good.
Amanda T.,"San Leandro, CA",695,318,120,2.0,1/2/2013,"I was going to give this place one stars. But the I liked the batter for the onion rings. Notice how I said batter and not onions. The onions weren't cooked enough and still cloudy and not translucent.  So we decided to come here for dinner last night to try it out. This is only my second time eating at applebees. The first time was in LA and I had a horrible experience with long waits and nasty food. I was skeptical coming in but I was hopeful. So we waited for about 20 minutes which was permissible. As we made our way to our booth, we noticed that there were MANY tables empty and that was really suspicious. Anyways we were just glad that we finally got seated. To be honest, nothing seemed really appetizing on the menu. Some things looked really good on the picture but we al knew that when it came out on the plate, it would be nothing but disappointing. The waiter was normal got our drinks and orders. My friend ordered the asian chicken salad and I ordered the three cheese penne. My family ordered other things. So we wait and wait. We noticed that two tables that got seated after us even got their food before us. This is not right at all. I'm hating this place even more. But, we kept ourselves busy as our total wait time for this restaurant added up to be 1 hr. Food finally comes and the plate is super hot but the food isn't smoking. Not fresh as we expected. First thing my friend told me was that my chicken is from frozen as she works at a restaurant herself. The chicken tastes burnt all over and the penne was nothing special. It really was disappointing and I had no more appetite. Of course my friend enjoyed her food because it was just salad.  bottom line: I'm never coming here again or eating at any other Applebees. This experience was just not that great."
Shannon B.,"Castro Valley, CA",7,9,,4.0,1/10/2015,"Great Happy Hour during the day and AGAIN at 9pm-close in the bar area.  Stays open late too (at least until 1am) even on weekdays.  I highly recommend the Won Ton tacos!!!  Especially when they are half price at Happy Hour!... in fact get 2 orders!!  They're that good! (not to mention lower in fat compared to the other appies.)  The bartender & waitresses consistently deliver friendly yet quick service so you can always get in & out if needed.   Perfect spot when looking for an enjoyable, inexpensive, late night snack and/or cocktail!"
K. D.,"San Leandro, CA",1,72,6,4.0,2/26/2016,"Gotta be the Best ""Bang for Your Buck"" restaurant in the Bay Area! We really like the 2 for $25 menu...... Food and Cleanliness 5 stars*****..... Service could be speed up, 4 stars****..... 102 year old grandmother loves the Honey BBQ Boneless Wings..... Always a Customer....."
