Steve H.,"Hayward, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/18/2016,"Beware, dishonest billing! Check your monthly credit card bill! My tip had been increased after I had left."
Salman T.,"Hayward, CA",105,33,20,3.0,11/19/2015,"Not bad. Not great.  Wanted to go to Panera bread next door, but these guys had parking.  My last experience at this place (8 years ago) was terrible.   This time was much better but I still was not satisfied.  I had a burger and fries.  My wife has a philly sandwich and chips.  She got a single order for onion soup and we shared a artichoke dip with some chips.  The  bill came went over $44(!). And this is the first place in years I was charged for carbonated water(!).  The serve time was ok.  The food wasn't bad but was pricey.  Idk if I'll come back--maybe in another 8 years...."
Shania B.,"Hayward, CA",1,6,4,1.0,8/11/2015,"There are rude at this location, nd I asked to sub something for me nd she was being extremely rude nd then calls the manager who was even more rude..... your better off going to the union city location their much nicer, oh yea the general manager the white lady's a bitch. She tried to get up in my face."
Mariah B.,"Hayward, CA",185,7,9,3.0,5/11/2014,"*disclaimer: went in on Mother's Day, the place was pretty busy* First of all, it's a chain restaurant so I wasn't expecting much. The food was okay, nothing fabulous, but pretty good if you get the 2 for $20 deal.  Second, the service was subpar. Our waiter kept screwing up our order and the surrounding tables. He also messed up our receipt, and we had to correct him several times.  Third, be wary of ordering drinks. The prices are hidden for a reason, they don't want you to see how much you're spending!  Not my favorite chain, but it's not bad if you're going in for a simple dinner."
Toibox W.,"Hayward, CA",696,22,18,2.0,10/22/2015,"I've tried to like this spot. I've always like the food at Applebee's but this location is slow and never gets it right. I waited for a manager for over 30 minutes and she tried to apologize for the poor service, but the problem is that the service here is NEVER good. Even when they aren't busy, the waitstaff spends more time talking to one another than they do checking on their customers. Shame"
Paul M.,"Concord, CA",18,73,30,2.0,6/13/2014,"I should have looked 1st. Probably the worst experience at a chain restaurant. I was with 3 other co-workers. Orders took forever, appetizer never delivered, never checked for refills, a simple quesadilla was burnt. Sorry i even showed up"
Judy W.,"Oakland, CA",412,343,133,2.0,3/20/2013,"Alright, so applebee's is the place that me and my bestie go to back in davis after we failed a test, or got our hearts broken. lol. We would walk over, and get a triple chocolate meltdown to soothe our damaged souls. lol. the Davis location wasn't bad, locals and college students were their clientele. The servers were always nice. and it was clean. HOWEVER, this location in Hayward is a wholeeeee other story. we come here very randomly and rarely for happy hour. Let's just do a quick run through Food: The food here sucks, lol. Nothing I've ordered here tastes ""good"" and definitely would not pay the non-happy hour price. We ordered our triple chocolate meltdown, though the cake was good, the server brought it out the us with the ice cream entirely melted. that was ridiculous. He said it was cause of the freezer, well if ur gonna bring me something that looks like shit, u shouldnt bring it out at all. Just tell me your freezer is broken and that the ice cream is melted. and take a dollar off the cake. But no, he gave me my cake next to a pool of melted ice cream. thank you for that, guy. Drinks: It depends who bartending, i've had good margaritas, and not so good margaritas. If you dont want to risk it, i suggest you order a beer. Service: service here isnt terrible, but you can tell the people that work here kinda hates their job, and just really doesnt give a shit. lol. i.e. the melted ice cream incident that ruined our memories of a perfect Triple Chocolate Meltdown!!!! It takes forever for food and drinks to come out. No water refills. No offering of napkins. you know the simple stuff. Cleanliness: Its definitely not clean. There's crap all over the floor, the tables are sometimes sticky, stuff on the chair. Eeeek. The only reason why we would come back is for the happy hour drinks. ill never order my cake here again. lol.  and hopefully i wont get that halfway stupid server -.- seriously? liquid ice cream, if i wanted milk, i woulda asked for it. =["
Vilma T.,"Hayward, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/9/2016,"As soon as we walked in the restaurant the vibe was dead! No one greeted us stood there for about 5 min until the hostess came with an attitude. The hostess didn't even say hello, she was too busy talking with her friend who was on break. Again, the HOSTESS kept rolling her eyes as soon as she would see PAYING customers coming in. We were seated and waited 10 min and nothing! No sign of a waitress not even to offer drinks! We finally walked out. We rather drive to Chili's in Union city to get better service. Management shame on you."
Graice J.,"Hayward, CA",0,6,1,1.0,12/2/2015,When we came to order to go the server was very unpleasant he was very short with me during a conversation but other guests he went out of his way to make comfortable in front of me so that was a little odd. We ordered ribs and fries and left immediately after we paid and got the order. Extremely hungry and anxious to eat when we went to open up the order which I wish I checked before leaving the ribs were burnt and the fries were a little warm and less than a handful. I was wondering if we had half the order of fries and a rushed order of ribs. Our experience was very unfortunate!!!!!
Ange A.,"Hayward, CA",24,12,11,2.0,10/12/2015,"Very disappointing carside service. Had to call three times, they hung up twice. When order was finally received it was lukewarm at best. Arrived on time, but order was 15 minutes late & cold, too...REALLY? The waiter guy ran after handing us the food. Not good....."
Crystal S.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,1,1.0,11/28/2015,Worst service! Awful! They take forever and the servers and talk amongst themselfs when u ask for the manager the manager takes another 30 mins. I didn't even talk to the manager I walked out I'm so hungry I'm tired of waiting
Rajdeep K.,"San Leandro, CA",14,20,5,5.0,2/7/2016,I don't  know so many  people  giving  them negative reviews. So far we been here 5 times. We never had any bad experience with customers service or with food. I guess people are so selfish these days they never write positive  review when they are happy with customer service  and food. Yet they will write  negative  reviews if restaurant makes a mistake.
Alexandra R.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,1,1,1.0,2/5/2015,"The service is super slow, the servers give attitude, the cups are dirty, it's just not good service and the bar doesn't do justice either ."
Katherine L.,"Portland, OR",11,33,3,3.0,11/8/2015,The three stars are for the service.  The steak and mashed potatoes I had tonight tasted like fish.  Gross.
R. B.,"Hayward, CA",38,243,6,3.0,8/23/2015,"Came back to try a couple of Appetizers. We opted for the Chicken Wonton Tacos; the chicken was over cooked and they are super sweet! Both of us didn't care for this app. We also tried the Salsa Verde Nachos with Shredded Brisket. These are really good but hardly any toppings compared to all of the chips!  The chips however are light and crispy, the Queso is yummy but there wasn't enough of it! the meat is tender but still not enough. Good Concept; Poor Execution:("
Lizzbeth R.,"Oakland, CA",0,19,3,2.0,1/2/2016,"Always slow service. not too impressed by the food. I do have my favorite though, the lemon cedar grilled chicken. Very good. They are pretty cheap which is good, my problem with this place is the slow service, along with a few very bad experiences."
Amber C.,"Alameda, CA",103,124,91,2.0,3/1/2014,Food is reliable. That not what I'm giving a low rating for. The service here is the worst compared to other Applebee's. There was a 15 minute wait with half the restaurant empty. And then another 10 minutes just to be offered water. Management should work harder at efficiently utilizing the staff even when it's short staffed.
Ar F.,"Hayward, CA",0,37,24,1.0,7/10/2016,"They have to change they hours in Yelp, because I went 12 am and they wrote they are open until 1 am but they were closed."
Ray D.,"Fairfield, CA",0,6,2,1.0,11/29/2015,"This goes for all Applebee's.  This brand has gone down so low.  The service is the worst.  Some of the food is OK to good.  But when you  have such bad service,  that over shadows everything else in my opinion.  Just sitting here trying to endure the torture until this review process is done."
Christian L.,"San Lorenzo, CA",7,12,4,2.0,4/25/2016,"The food was well made, the bartender really outdid herself, more than satisfied with her work! Unfortunately, the waiters are careless and rude. When we first walked into the restaurant, the first waiter who was supposed to seat my party and I to our table, said that he would wipe the table down and come get us right after, but that he was ready to seat us. The young man left and did not come back, we had to wait an additional 20 minutes after that to be seated. The waiter who replaced him was no better. on April 24th at 9 PM our waiter named Manny was being very rude and smart mouthed to my friends and I. He walked away from me whIle I was asking him about my check, and would often leave for long periods of time when we would try to get his attention to order more things. It was a discomforting experience, it felt as if we were bothering him just by asking questions. He wouldn't let me finish asking my questions, when he would try to end my sentences for me. How is he a waiter? I will no longer come to this location, I will not pay to be disrespected or to be treated rudely. I would have rated this place with 5 stars if the waiters weren't so rude and careless. Don't come to this location if you have a temper, or can't deal with disrespect!"
