Jesus Alden P.,"Fremont, CA",0,11,6,1.0,1/31/2014,"If I could give no stars I would.  The hostess that greets you is obviously unhappy of her job.  Not accommodating, very unprofessional (chewing gum)... Had to wait a million years to be seated. Hostess just pointed as to where we are supposed to be seated. We ended up leaving hungry unhappy and frustrated! Called the manager later only to find out that she herself is not as happy as her servers! Definitely will not be going back again! Ever !  Bring your hungry stomachs to Panera bread next door, where you're treated right.."
Jose P.,"Oakland, CA",0,10,2,1.0,5/22/2016,"Horrible service today. We were seated quickly but we waited 20min until our server came to INTRODUCE themselves. Not even to take our drink order. Keep in mind that the restaurant was dead during our visit. But apparently 3 employees thought it was a priority to chill and waste time at the host stand. Worst service ever. Especially from our server, Rossario (i think that was her name)."
Coleen K.,"San Leandro, CA",166,5,2,1.0,4/23/2015,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! I took my Mother to this location for dinner last night.  It was perhaps one of the WORST dining experiences EVER.   It took the server 10 minutes to even stop by the table to get a drink order.  It took another 20 minutes to get 1 water and 1 ice tea and another 10 minutes to get a bloody mary.  It would be understandable had the restaurant been busy - but IT WAS NOT - Neither was the bar.   When we placed our order (Pot sticker appetizer, 2 bowls of french onion soup, 1 burger (med) with mayo on the side, tomato and onion only and a side salad), it took another 20 minutes to get the soup.  It was bland - like water had been added to it.  The soup was lukewarm at best.  The server did not show back up to check on things.  The appetizer was never delivered.  The burger was barely warm and overcooked.  The lettuce in the salad was brown and obviously old.  The cucumbers had been partially frozen and were limp.   The waiter forgot the mayo and I had to go searching and found the manager and asked for it.  He acted put out - when he brought it to the table, he just slid it across to my Mother without a word.  He had the audacity to come back and ask how things were and then left to take a call before we could say anything!!   We paid at the table and left.  Total bill was about $34 and a complete waste as 95% of the food couldn't be eaten. This is inexcusable - horrible food, horrible service.  I have no choice but to give 1 star in this rating system; however, it would be a -5 if I could do that."
gee b.,"San Jose, CA",99,71,10,2.0,7/31/2015,"This review is for this location only. The food isn't too bad here portions are normal, the only complaint I have about here is the wait time. We come during non-busy hours, no sport games going on and no wait times to be seated, but yet we wait 20-30 minutes for our food. Our main dishes always come before our appetizers so that sucks. We always have to flag a person down to get refills on our drinks. I never really had a good customer service experience here. I tend to come here since it's literally 5 minutes from my house, but after repeated horrible service from here I'm willing to take the trip to UC or just settle for McDonalds."
Edwin R.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/20/2015,"Would like to comment on the food but after sitting at our table for 30 minutes, we have not seen any. Asked for lemon with our water 3 times, and still didn't get any. When asked where is our food, was told it's coming. We have not been here in a while, and apparently they changed the decor, but they have lost my business. Finally... Food arrived. My overpriced all day brunch burger is literally 3 inches wide. Looks like a slider. So disappointed."
Erika D.,"Antioch, CA",0,9,,1.0,11/2/2015,"Unfortunately this was a terrible experience. First drinks were wrong, the long Island didn't have alcohol in it. One person in our party had their entire order skipped. Then the bill was all screwed up so we asked for the manager and he never came. I'm very disappointed in this place especially considering that it's so close to a busy mall and such heavy foot traffic coming in."
Steve N.,"Castro Valley, CA",197,4,,1.0,3/10/2015,Worst service ever every time I come here. The bartender has been rude to multiple customers wow!!!
Lorri D.,"Danville, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/3/2015,HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! Cant say much about the food because I didn't get that far. We left before we got seated. It was a joke. Rude employees and poor customer service. Would NOT recommend it....AT ALL!!!! LD
johnson t.,"Oakland, CA",2,9,1,1.0,8/16/2015,Terrible service. Super unorganized. Five different servers came to ask if we had already ordered. Entree came before appetizers. Waited twenty minutes for my first glass of water.
Jeneal V.,"Pittsburg, CA",1,32,,1.0,8/7/2015,"The service here is terrible.  I will NEVER come back. We ordered using the kiosk and when we completed our order, it said to call the server.  We had to wait for the server to take our order (again).  Our buffalo wings came with no sauce; the server brought the food and quickly walked away without providing utensils, napkins, and plates.  So again we had to wait for her to return. We were a table of four but she brought utensils for two . Had to wait again to have her bring the sauce too.  It didn't come for another 15 minutes.  I could go on but it was just h-o-r-r-i-b-l-e service. After having the appetizer, we just paid and left."
Jayr R.,"Hayward, CA",8,9,,5.0,9/7/2015,"Always a pleasant staff serving great, food at a very reasonable price. Been going with my family since I was a very young child and it's always consistently delicious!"
Jenneath C.,"San Leandro, CA",60,51,14,5.0,3/20/2015,Wanted to give a 100% to Cindy the manager at Applebee's. We came here to try to enjoy a nice meal unfortunately we brought along with us a friend that could not hold himself down. However Cindy notice that and took control of our table. I only have wish we would have been able to enjoy our dinner in the restaurant. Cindy was understanding.
Flower S.,"Los Angeles, CA",115,3,,1.0,12/27/2015,"Not long wait time to be seated. When seated waiter was a bit standoffish. We ordered our food. Didnt get asked how we wanted our meat cooked. When We got our order I was done with my drink. Not once did she ask me if I wanted another one. Our appetizers came same time as our food. However they were sitting there.. Why didn't they bring them out when they were ready? The way I know they were done is bc the motzarella sticks were soggy on the side that was touching the plate as if it was sitting there a while. Also, the Maranara sauce had a dehydrated  top layer. Also indicative that it was just sitting there in the warmer. Again, why didn't they serve it? Kind of gross to have one side soggy one side crispy motzarella sticks. The chicken plate was edible, the stake plate had good mashed potatoes... That's it. The meat had a weird texture to it and was not cooked evenly. It was also like some mystery meat... rubbery and well done on the thinner side and the thicker side was nervy and chewy and rare. Why didn't we get asked how we wanted the stake and why didn't it resemble a cut that I'm familiar with... really gross. We lost our appetite, after we pointed out it was chewy and not well cooked. Then the waitress put in an order for another stake, but it took forever to come out, like at least 20 minutes. We decided to leave even if one of us was still hungry. By this time we we were ready to go with a headache and stress, because the manager lady decided to have her dinner break right next to us.... she was complaining about work issues regarding people who where working that moment, and talked down to employees that approached her. The other, I suppose, second in command gentleman having his break with her was soft speaking aND fortunately I couldn't hear his portion of the conversation. But the lady manager was loud and had no qualms about speaking work problems in front of customers. This was distasteful and frankly ruined my experience of the little good aspects of the food. I come to a restaurant after work to get away from work issues and have care free service that I am paying for... this was the opposite of what we  got. Never again. Hope management changes, because with a toxic boss you are sure to have a toxic business."
Lyndsay I.,"San Jose, CA",2,14,,1.0,9/28/2014,"Worst service! Got seated immediately and took our waitress almost 20 minutes to stop by and offer us water. We were just about to walk out. Got our order in, even got the wedge salad a good 10 minutes before our silverware showed up. It's lovely staring at your food just waiting to eat it. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who'd actually like to be served or eat within an hour."
Monica T.,"Daly City, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/21/2015,Was sitting at the bar area and my sister mentioned she saw a bug on the lamp above us. The bug fell onto our table and we saw it was a ROACH!!!!! The ROACH then ran across the table and hid in between the cracks of the Booth!! Disgusting !!!!
Akleshni S.,"Hayward, CA",1,4,,1.0,8/3/2015,"We decided to celebrate our grandma's birthday at Applebee's today. BAD decision. Not many ppl there n were told about 25 to 30 minutes since we were a large party. We waited n waited...finally  about 30 minutes later we asked how much longer, the waiter told us it will be another 15 to 20 minutes because another large group came in n it will tie up the kitchen. REALLY.... how is that our fault.. hire more cooks. We asked to talk to the manager who I guess didnt wanna deal with us cuz he never showed up. Finally they got our table ready. Never going back....Ever!!!!"
Vanessa P.,"San Leandro, CA",0,12,11,1.0,5/15/2015,"Probably one if the worst experiences here in Applebee's. Managers hand was touching my ribs when he gave my plate, I asked him for hot water he never brought it, I had to re ask my server. Then when the manager brought us spoons for our dessert he just put them on the table with no napkin. I worked in restaurants for 7 years and that is not how you do things!!!"
Cleo M.,"Oakland, CA",109,144,5,2.0,9/26/2014,"Service here is like night and day.  I actually went here for lunch September 9th, it was great. Got seated immediately and server came over within a matter of a minute. It was a pretty good size crowd but no delay in service. I order there crosscut ribs, all you can eat special. My food came out less than 15 minutes with large portion sizes, I questioned whether I would be able to eat another plate because I knew I would not finish the first one. The server was attentive, checking on me and even ordering a second plate ( you can try the other flavors with each plate) while I still had a sizable portion left. She stated that it would be a minute so she wanted to make sure my order was in when I finished. I never finished but did get my second plate and ate a bit, taking the rest home.  Came back the same week the Friday with my sister, slightly larger crowd but not by much, we did get seated quickly. Our waitress was great and came over for ordering within 5 minutes. We ordered, I ordered the same thing from the 9th with all you can eat and my sister a burger. Easy peasy right...no. About 15 minutes in our waitress has to go on her 30 minutes, no problem she introduced us to our fill in waiter. Cool. Nope, he's  not attentive, granted we didn't get our food until nearly an hour after entering the place. So him being attentive to all the empty tables who had no food in the area would have just been status updates. Nothing. Even the chick selling jello shots was more attentive. We had decided we would not leave a tip if he was still the waiter at checkout, because my sister cup was sitting on E forever. When you are hungry and you wait as long as we did, I started questioning whether I was really hungry or experience phantom hunger symptoms. We entered and sat at 9:45pm, I looked up and it was 10:39 and we still had no food, all the tables in that area had no food, most of them entered within 5 minutes of us. I thought I could have hit a drive thru already before the food came out. But when it did come out, it was less of a portion than the previous time, no biggie, it's all you can eat. We requested napkins because I'm eating ribs with my hands and not a fork, they weren't brought automatically like logic would suggest. And my sister has a burger, something you eat with your hands, at least we do.  There wasn't even the rolled silverware on the table, wait never mind wrong restaurant.  I started to question had I made the request because he took forever to bring napkins, I had to ask the host standing at the door for napkins. Guess who came quicker, the host but the waiter did come with napkins. He never came back over after the napkins, I thought I had all you can eat, granted I still had food on my plate but with the nearly hour wait for food he could have at least asked if I wanted to order more.  Within 15 minutes of getting our food, our old waitress was back, I put in my request to go containers, the check and another order to go. She did so with no problem, we left her a tip. Not consistent service at this location."
Ryan L.,"San Francisco, CA",1611,328,423,1.0,5/31/2013,Applebee's has a new menu which is like an ugly person getting a new t-shirt. yawn. skip.
Victoria C.,"Frederick, MD",14,10,1,1.0,4/23/2015,"Terrible service!! My family and I waited 15 minutes for a table which was fine, but we are sitting here at our table and haven't been acknowledged by a server for nearly 20 minutes now. No water, with no one to check up on us or apologize. Ridiculous!!!!"
