Dana D.,"Pleasanton, CA",22,65,16,1.0,7/3/2015,"This place is joke! No one wants to help you but socialize with their friends, hang outside yapping in front with their friends and should be torn down. Place was not busy half empty and tables open but 3 people could not seat us in 15 minutes which is too dam long to wait while watching theses kids socialize. They want a job but not do their job this place needs new management because obviously has none. There are so many other places that we can go to and we did!"
Michelle T.,"South San Francisco, CA",852,312,3891,4.0,1/8/2012,"The last time I have been here was a few years back and at that time the food sucked!  However, I had a gift card this time that needed to be used and found myself back here.  New and improved menu and the service was great!  It was a busy night and the server gave me a heads up that the food may take awhile to come out, which I really appreciated.  I ordered a mango Margarita to hold me up before my food came out. So good, gave me a really good buzz, just what  I was looking for. =) The menu has been updated with much healthier choices with weight watcher choices and items under 550 calories. I chose the grilled chicken with portobello mushrooms, yumm!  The $1.99 shooters for desserts are just enough and worth getting, we tried all three and shared amongst each other, my favorite was the cheesecake. So tiny but yet filling.  I would definitely come back."
Javier P.,"San Leandro, CA",290,501,1782,3.0,12/31/2013,Let me start off by saying that I'm not big on Applebee's. I've been here a few times with coworkers after a long day at work on Sunday evenings. We come for a few drinks and appetizers. You can never go wrong with the sampler and  boneless wings to go with your drinks.
kim d.,"Castro Valley, CA",3,11,,1.0,3/6/2015,"They claim to be a friendly neighborhood, but no. They have horrible customer service. We came here for a family meal at 3pm, and barely anyone here. We had to wait for 15 minutes to be seated, after we got seated we had to wait for another 10 minutes for the waitress to come, she rude and not polite!! This is not a place for family to come eat"""""""
Denise H.,"Hayward, CA",45,146,47,3.0,10/20/2013,"Before you read this review, you need to make sure you're comparing this restaurant to similar restaurants. This isn't a 5-star, high quality restaurant. That's not what you pay for, and this is a chain. So, on that note, for what the quality of food was and the fact that I decided to eat here on a crowded Friday night, the simple-minded staff can only do (and perhaps handle) so much. We sat at the bar so we wouldn't have to wait 30+min for a table. The pasta was kind of warm... Which meant it was sitting out for a while before we got our food. The fiesta salad was nothing to brag about. Dressing was tangy and tasty. Those pretzels, though... Were DELICIOUS! Would definitely get those again.  If I'm in the mood for a chain restaurant."
Loo X.,"Hayward, CA",0,8,,1.0,8/28/2014,"This Applebee's at Southland has really gone downhill. The service was absolutely horrible, everything took forevvvvver and the bartender has no idea what he was doing... Terrible drinks!!! Will never go back!"
Andrea C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1032,319,1497,3.0,6/28/2011,"It's a chain restaurant, and as you know, chain restaurants have a limit to how good they really can be.   It's good for lunch, there's a lunch special menu as well as a two entree, one appetizer special for $20.  It's a bit cheaper than other chain restaurants of the same caliber, and the quality is roughly the same.   I am a big fan of milkshakes, and they do an oreo one with I do enjoy, but at the end of the day it's just a chain restaurant. Fair service, fair food, fair prices.   That's it."
Jet G.,"San Lorenzo, CA",185,10,,2.0,11/24/2014,"I do not condone under aged drinking, but Applebee's does not seem to mind serving drinks without asking for the ID card of certain customers. I have been at a gathering where I found out after this individual had ordered shots and beers, she was only 19 years old. Was it because she was an attractive female? Was it because she may have looked older? I don't know. But to me she looked younger than her age. Besides that, the food and appetizers especially are on fleek!"
Diane H.,"Clovis, CA",24,41,29,2.0,1/2/2015,"It was o.k. I have a problem if everyone's food doesn't show up at the same time and this was ridiculous. It was obvious they totally Forgot about my friend's dinner because they only brought it after we asked where it was! The spoon I was given for my soup had lettuce stuck to it!! Also, there was a language barrier that I usually don't mind but this is America and I EXPECT you to speak English! If I went to your country you would expect the same."
Unhappy C.,"Stockton, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/19/2016,"From the time we entered the establishment we were not acknowledged within an ample amount of time. I went down to the bar to get a glass of water for my girlfriend and the bartender was busy talking to a buddy of his at the bar, and wouldn't even acknowledge me until I said excuse me. Once we were seated the food server was very cordial and attentive. The appetizers and drinks came promptly, but after that everything else was down hill. It was a terrible dining experience."
Stephanie P.,"Hayward, CA",127,1,,1.0,5/23/2015,"Do NOT eat here !!!!!! Worst service ever! You have to wait forever to even get offered some water! Decided to try out their car side service one day and it was fine, went back today and we waited forever as in almost an hour because they had ""technical difficulties "" and had not made our meal .... Car side to go is supposed to be convenient and fast yet we waited forever! I was really upset because this defeated the whole purpose, I could've gone elsewhere but I had already paid beforehand ... Of course there was no technical difficulties when they received my payment online but my order was somehow lost ... So 2 bad experiences will never come back here again all they offered as compensation was a free dessert shooting that I'm not even going to eat! Avoid stress and go somewhere else"
Alex G.,"San Leandro, CA",64,40,7,5.0,6/18/2015,"I am so surprised to see so negative comments.  This place is awesome.  After shopping in mall, we went there. The whole restaurant was packed. We thought is gonna be while to get the table, but we were seated quickly.  We ordered the artichoke dip, chicken pasta and another chicken dish can't remember the name.  Food was so good. Customer service was also very. We loved it"
Melanie C.,"Fresno-High, CA",3,32,,5.0,8/15/2013,"This review is for the service alone - as Applebee's food is pretty much the same anywhere you go.  We had a party of 12 and had to wait 30 minutes for a table, which was understandable on a Saturday. We were seated and Tatiana was our sever. She was extremely nice and accommodating. My two young boys were so hungry and a three year old has a hard time understanding that he has to wait for food - she made sure to put the boys orders in first and they were done within 10 mins. Awesome!!! That meant a lot! All of our orders were correct, our drinks stayed full, and when one of the plates took over 25 minutes to be ready - she comped it on our bill.  She was awesome! We're not from here - only here for a baseball game ... But if we were to come back again, we'd definitely request her section.  She definitely deserved every penny of the tip she received!"
Dj T.,"Castro Valley, CA",136,36,4,3.0,6/6/2015,This place is hit and miss. I believe the failures have to do more with the corporate side than the folks working there. They are too busy and under staffed.
Ruth A.,"San Leandro, CA",65,312,21,2.0,9/21/2013,"I've been here several times now. The food is consistently good, and the service has been consistently poor. Some examples: - We came in the door and stood, waiting to be seated or even acknowledged, while several servers chatted in front of us. After some waving and direct questions, we were finally seated. - Service was slow on every visit. S-L-O-W. - On every visit, something was not right with the order: a drink wasn't brought until late in the meal, we were brought the wrong side dish, etc.  I'm not sure if this was all the servers. At least once, the server implied that the problem was in the kitchen when we complained.  My conclusion? I won't be back."
Ariana L.,"Fair Oaks, CA",38,62,13,2.0,9/14/2013,"I only gave it 2 stars because they actually have really good 3 cheese chicken penne pasta but since I'll never be going back, that part doesn't really matter.  This location is thee worst Applebee's I've ever had the displeasure of being at. The first time I went it was amazing. Fast service good food. Nice staff. Just great.   The second time. Started to suck. Me an my husband don't have kids yet so we usually like to sit at the bar or around the bar area to be away from noisy kids and large noisy parties.  Well the staff sits us next to some hysterically crying child and we put up with it for the entire 45 mins. that we were there waiting to place out order. No one ever came. So we left.  The third time! (I don't know why we poked the hornets nest)  They actually took our order after about 10 mins. Not bad. We were sat next to 4 extremely loud and obnoxious women so we heard their cackling the entire time but its cool. The annoying thing was that the power went out right before we were going to leave and it was taking out waitress forever to give us the check. If she would have just paid attention and not forgotten about us then she would have realized we were done and gave us the check so we could leave BEFORE the power went out.  Since she didn't, she couldn't process my husbands card and she couldn't access our bill AT ALL so we had to pay in cash and we don't usually use cash so it was difficult to scrounge some up and then the waitress over charged us and said our food, that usually comes out to $25 for 2 people, miraculously came out to $45. But we couldn't even fight it because we couldn't prove because no power to get a receipt.  Complaining, ranting review is over!  P.S. the waitresses excuse was ""I rounded to the 16th of the dollar""  Wtf???? Stick to the calculator next time :("
Ms F.,"Fremont, CA",0,24,,1.0,4/21/2015,"Let's start with the 1 star, that's for the manager trying to be nice, and the bartender trying to accommodate us....the customer service at this establishment is horrible and the food is gross as well..ridiculously rude servers and long waits when there clearly available seating....after the horrible experience I had last night I'm sure I will find some where else to watch the playoffs ....."
Aloha J J.,"Hayward, CA",0,17,,1.0,10/23/2014,"Good menu for the special. However, food are very oily and greasy. Services lacking most of the time and floor are dirty. They will clean up the floor while the customers are eating at the same time, like vacuum the carpet... interesting!!! I will go for my drink if all places are close early at night only!!!"
MaryAnn W.,"San Diego, CA",103,177,49,2.0,11/12/2013,So getting seated was not bad at all! Around 10:15pm on a Tuesday I expect it to be quick. Our server took like 10 mins to get our drinks!!! We ordered our food the 2 for $20. Our appetizer came out 10 mins. Our food however took 15 to 20 mins! The creamy chicken with rice was not great. It came out sloppy.  My honey chicken and shrimp was great! The server disappeared half the time.  Checked up on us once! I mean there was only about 10 people in the restaurant! Servers were talking to each other and not paying attention to the customers! It took me 15 mins to get a togo box! And another 10 mins for my check! Hello!!! If I'm asking for a togo box bring my check along with you geeze!  The 2 stars was for fast seating and my honey chicken and shrimp! Other then that service is not great!  Our server was Rossio! Not the best server.  I usually tip 20% but she doesnt even deserve it!
Kea H.,"Berkeley, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/25/2015,Went to Applebee's to place a to go order.     I ordered the pepper crusted steak. I told the waitress that I would like my steak medium and she said to me they only cook the steak one way. I found this to be odd but I said ok how do they cook it. She said I think medium but it was obvious that she really didn't know. Came home to eat and my steak was by far the toughest steak that I ever had to chew. Very bland and the multigrain rice mix on the side was tasteless as well. Will not be ordering food from there anymore. The amount they give you for the price plus the flavor isn't worth it.
