Alicia A.,"San Leandro, CA",84,289,447,1.0,2/12/2013,"Worse place ever!!!! Horrible wait, service and food."
Chaniquea C.,"Oakland, CA",0,6,1,1.0,9/9/2015,"Wow this is the worst experience ever I've ever had at any Applebee's. The bartender Michael for 1 didn't even greet me upon arriving to the bar. My friend was already there. Ignored me when I asked for some ranch for my mozzarella sticks. My friend had to ask him for me. He stayed out the bar customers looking for him, more than in the bar. Shift leader on duty didn't even reconcile the problem. Every one unhappily waiting for Michael.  Boooooo!"
Raquel F.,"Antioch, CA",63,51,19,2.0,9/24/2013,"Thank God for good company. My best friend and I went here last night for dinner and drinks. Of course, the service was slow and horrible. Not just our waitress, but all the waitresses (that can only be found every 20 minutes) we're rude and had an attitude. The food and drinks were commendable, which is the reason for the 2nd star. If I had to base it off of customer service, definitely -1 star.  It took approximately 15-20 minutes just for our waitress to greet us and ask what we wanted to drink. Our menu of choice for the evening was: Berry Sangria (5 starts) and my bf had the Oktoberfest, which she enjoyed. I tried the new mac and cheese with chicken (4 stars) and she had some type of chicken and potatoes, which was decent. Like I said in the beginning, thank God for good company. Bad service can really ruin your outing if not for good company."
K M.,"Hayward, CA",117,87,50,4.0,8/16/2013,"Liked our visit last night. Dinner was good. Pretty happy with how the food turned out considering if usually can be known to be cold or lack luster. Server was really nice.. Although she kept coming over a lot to ask if we wanted the check a lot. Also, the host was an idiot. He made all these people wait. I know working in a restaurant you usually need to seat when there's a server, but come on, 7 open tables... Just seat them. Poor people."
Amanda S.,"North Highlands, CA",7,19,3,1.0,5/31/2014,Service was terrible!  My mother in law had to go get us napkins and utensils. The waiter took at least 15 minutes to give us our drinks. Then when we finally got our food after waiting almost an hour my sister in laws meal was wrong. Im never comming back to this location again.
Kayla G.,"Vinton, VA",0,11,7,2.0,2/1/2015,"Every time we order carside it takes well over the estimated time (last night quoted time it would be ready was 8:04, it wasn't ready until 8:35). We also have NEVER ordered carside to go here and have someone bring it out to us. We have to go inside. Every. Single. Time. (Even though we request carside- inside pick up is another option). Last night I literally sat in the spot for 20 mins, called them from my car, then waited another 10 mins before going inside. Their food is ok, but they last several times they messed up our order as well. The only reason I give two stars is their manager- Ricky- was very nice. He offered us two free appetizers. I appreciate that someone recognized the ridiculous wait time this time, but this happens EVERY time. The only reason we still go is it is the only semi-decent to-go food that isn't fast food in this area. I regret it every time."
Niel S.,"Hayward, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/19/2015,I just had lunch here and asked a server Evelyn to assist and she was very rude and in denial of basic service etiquette.
Priscilla C.,"Oakland, CA",22,38,169,1.0,8/9/2013,"Decided to give Applebees a try for late night dinner with my family since we always see Applebees around, but never tried it. All I can say is that it was one of the worst meals I've had at a restaurant. Service: horrible. With a party of three, the waiter took 15 minutes to get to us even though there were tables open. The waiters were just talking to each other in the back. Gave them a benefit of the doubt because it was around 9pm.. but when it came to ordering food, it took FOREVER to wave a waiter down to take our order. The waiter recommended the steak and chicken dish because those were ""applebees specials"".. which we regret later.  Food: waited for probably 30minutes before the food came out and it wasn't even hot.. but WARM/on the side of cold. We ordered a 7oz steak and portebello chicken dish, hoping the food would look somewhat like the menu. BOY WERE WE WRONG. The steak was inedible and even my mom who's tolerant to ""not that great food"" spat what she ate out and regretted eating out that night. The portions are small on oversized plates, the plates were half filled with potatoes. The chicken was dry and the outside was covered in sauce. There were barely any portebello mushrooms, and their veges are you typical frozen vege: a broccoli and some carrots. Cost: expensive for such below average food. The two dishes came out to be around $30. I'm so disappointed and highly recommend against trying this place out."
Brittney W.,"Alameda, CA",0,4,,5.0,2/6/2016,The food here tastes far better than any applebees ive ever been to! Idk how they do it but i love it!!!!
Ed F.,"San Francisco, CA",13,43,20,4.0,12/14/2014,"I know that they don't have the best reviews on Yelp  in regards to their  ""normal"" service BUT I guarantee that their service at the bar Evelyn and Rocio will DEFINATELY take care of you. Their happy hour on driving is ALL DAY LONG and their appetizers are half off on during certain hours buy it's still great! I'm from SF and it's almost twice as much at The Wharf and the service us nowhere half as good. These ladies will take care of you. Gotta love them!!!!"
Doctor G.,"Alameda County, CA",0,1740,1,3.0,12/21/2012,"Went here for lunch a bit apprehensive because of the negative reviews on Yelp.  The parking lot was crowded, but it wasn't that crowded inside.  We got seated quickly and the service was actually first rate.  I had French Onion soup and a spinach and grilled shrimp salad which was darned good.  Price for soup and salad was right too. This restaurant was clean inside and looked just like any other Applebee's I've been to.  Good experience."
Thee M.,"Oakland, CA",2,47,13,1.0,8/20/2014,"I visited this Applebee's on my birthday 8/18/14 for dinner. The waitress Samantha was SOOOOO rude, didn't check on us the entire night and had the audacity to argue with me, when SHE was wrong! I used to frequent this place BUT NOW, I'm not even returning to the franchise. If this is how they operate, they may as well close the doors for good because no one wants that. Applebee's get it together!"
Luis G.,"San Leandro, CA",0,46,9,1.0,10/24/2014,"The service here is slooow and horrible,  i will never come here again in my life!  Honestly this place should be shut down for good. Shame on Applebee's i guess is a good place if you want to go and waste your time never again."
Shan C.,"Concord, CA",28,142,194,1.0,5/20/2014,Ok I use to really like this place. The service was always pretty good and it was this time around but how can one think of eating when you see one of the waitresses come out of bathroom stall - swing a towel onto her back and walk right out onto the floor. OMG!! Wendy Wendy Wendy Wendy - don't forget this name. Guess Wendy figured the alcohol from the drinks she was making and serving at the bar would clean her hands. I was down right disgusted. I couldn't even phantom eating anything. I know and I should have said something to the manager that day - but I was just disgusted. Then I saw her on the floor serving food to people. Lets just say for now I'm done with Applebees. Can you say salmonella???
Liliana G.,"Oakland, CA",14,9,2,1.0,12/4/2014,"Don't even waste your money here! So...I stopped by on a Sunday evening (11/30/14 6pm) for dinner with my boyfriend. Upon walking in the hostess was too busy talking to her coworkers  to acknowledge us so we waited for a while until we were seated.  Once we were seated we got our order taken quickly and drinks soon arrived after. My boyfriend ordered a cranberry martini and I got some fruity drink the waitress recommended, that's where the problems started. I was sipping my drink and then I realized there were TWO FLIES IN MY DRINK!!!! I asked to speak to the manager and she was very unapologetic about the incident. I was brought over another drink and it was absolutely disgusting, way to much tequila! So inconsistent in their drink making. As for the food, we got our food before we even had napkins or silverware we waited for about 5  until someone brought them over. Overall a terrible experience, totally avoid this place you'd get a better experience eating at the mall right across the street!"
Yanna B.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,11,,1.0,6/12/2015,"Ordered a drink. Finished it...glass sat empty for 20 minutes while two bartenders glanced at me frequently. The bartender asked me if I was just hanging out...or what? Did I want another one? She rolled her eyes st me and poured a drink. Why do paying customers deserve this? If being loud and belligerent is necessary to get their attention, I will go elsewhere."
Mr. P.,"Fremont, CA",4,29,2,1.0,4/11/2014,"I feel ripped off. Will never return to this place. I guarantee it. Food was cold, my Togo was missing two things, if I wasn't a bag checker, I'd of never known. They were rude, and the manager didn't even acknowledge me."
Jessica M.,"Frederick, MD",75,12,,3.0,6/17/2013,"Ok, I travel for a living, so I rely on yelp reviews. I guess I should've checked the reviews here before I ate here.  This was my second trip. First was for lunch during the week and this time was for lunch on a weekend. Both experiences were similar.  Food is average Applebee's food. Service is ok, but would someone explain to me why a half empty restaurant has a wait? On a Sunday morning?? If you don't have enough servers, then you should bring in another server. The bar area was completely empty when I arrived and I was told there was a 10 minute wait. Ummmm...what?! I sat at the bar because I was already hungry.  I gave 3 stars because I've been to Applebee's in 8 states and this is one of the worst in terms of service. Though I'm discovering this city doesn't have many well rated restaurants.

Ray S.,"San Leandro, CA",27,8,4,1.0,1/15/2015,"This restaurant is really getting worse. Me and my wife goes to this place from time to time to have a dinner and for my wife to have some perfect margarita. The steak was good but service was worse! We waited for an hour for our order. When we're about to leave, our order came..The waitress asked us if everything was ok, I said NO because we waited our order for an hour. The waitress?..no apology at all. I'm not going back there ever again."
Isaac H.,"San Francisco, CA",45,523,459,3.0,6/10/2014,This location is alright. Some what small. Still good service and good food. I would go the Applebee's in Dublin over this one because the one in Dublin is bigger.
