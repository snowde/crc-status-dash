Vivian T.,"Hayward, CA",318,49,41,2.0,3/26/2011,"Came here after the gym to fat ass it with my bf. They still had their 2 for 20 menu going on so we decided to get that. Service was horrible. Took 20 mins for the waitress to come greet us and after she got in our drink order (two waters), she told us she was going on break and that her sister would come serve us. Another 20 mins later we met her sister. She told us the food was coming right out and of course, nothing came out until another 20 mins. Food was definitely good for the price we were paying.  After we were done eating, we wanted the check so we can pay and leave. We saw our original server and her breaker walk around, but they never came to check up on us. When one of them finally spotted us glaring them down, she told us she would be ""right out"" with the check. Instead of being right out with our check, i spot her on the other side of the restaurant moping the floor and chatting with a coworker. You're kidding right? Anyways, applebee's is definitely not a place to go to if you want awesome service. I'll prob go to the Union City AB next time if I ever want to fat ass it with their 2 for 20 special."
Scott B.,"San Leandro, CA",104,89,32,3.0,2/26/2012,They took away the sizzling apple cobbler :(   That was for sure one of the best highlights ever!!  There bar at night is pretty active they have cool bartenders that talk and have fun...
Millisa C.,"San Mateo, CA",1,3,,2.0,10/23/2013,"Even for a Friday night the service was pretty good. On this visit, it was the food that failed. Ordered the build your appetizer trio, the southwest towers were more like a grilled oversized burrito and falling apart, the mozzarella sticks were super salty and the cheese want even warm. When the chicken strip basket arrived the chicken was dark brown from dirty oil but not even crunchy and the fries were salty as ever. I was hopeful it would improve by dessert but the dessert shooter was melting before it even got to the table and the whipped cream was everywhere. Epic fail for this location."
Renee G.,"Hayward, CA",0,5,2,1.0,7/3/2015,"I would give them 0 stars if I could. Horrible food, horrible customer service. Food tasted very chalky and no flavor at all. I order a cheeseburger and my husband ordered wings. We will not be back. Hire new people. Needs new management apparently"
Laura F.,"Hayward, CA",43,5,,2.0,3/16/2014,"Not the place to come to on a Sunday.  Asked for mango iced tea and got unsweetened plain black iced tea. Then asked for a well done steak and got medium rare. I'm pregnant and can not have under cooked meat so I ate around it leaving most of it. My brother-in-law asked for mashed potatoes and got regular seasoned potatoes and when we told them they said they would bring them to him..they never did. They asked if he still wanted the mashed potatoes after we were done eating. The waiter didn't give us straws, we had to ask a different waiter for those. I'm sure the service would have been better if we went durring a weekday."
Elizabeth H.,"Hayward, CA",3,4,2,1.0,9/28/2014,"The service here is terrible! I only saw my waitress when I received my drink, and then, again when the bill came! The food is absolutely terrible as well... go to a better place than this!"
D S.,"Modesto, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/21/2015,"I will NEVER go to this Apple Bees again! I should've looked at the reviews prior to eating here.. We only ordered appetizers and had to keep asking our server how much longer it would be.  After 45-50 mins we received our fries, chicken wings and mozzarella sticks which were ALL cold.  I asked to speak with the manager and told her we waited to long to eat cold food! She offered to have the food remade but we refused. The restaurant was not busy so there was no reason to have had to wait so long. Don't waste your time or money here!!"
Alan Y.,"San Leandro, CA",30,2,,1.0,6/20/2015,"Went to Applebee's Southland Hayward and had the most terrible experience going to Applebee's, my wife and I were going to celebrate our anniversary and have a bite to eat, the hostess sat us down at our table our waiter took our drink order and said he would give us time to look over the menu. Upon his return he took our food order which consisted an appetizer and two entrees, 20 minutes has elapsed I noticed the hostess sitting some patrons behind me there a waitress has taking their order so all this time the people behind me had already finished their appetizer and we're starting on their entree and we have not received our appetizer yet. Then our waiter came by and said the food will be out shortly, at this time 30 minutes had passed and the table behind me was waiting for the check. I had noticed our waiter was just standing there conversing with his coworkers and not checking to see if I order was ready or not. I certainly would not recommend this establishment to my friends upon experiencing the bad service that we had received ."
Vivian F.,"Fremont, CA",0,21,,1.0,8/21/2013,"Me and my friend ordered from the 2 for $24 menu. He ordered a steak and I order the baby back ribs. The steak comes with mesh potato and steam vegi and the baby back ribs comes with french fries and a very small portion of coleslaw. The presentation of the dish is very good and the waiters are very professional. However, the food is so SALTY!!   Both of us had to eat our dishes with four glasses of drinks.  yeah, we thought about stop eating them, but don't want to waste any food.... and then when we went home that, we both had heart burns and our hearts beats like crazy trying to get ride of the salt out of our body.... The price is right, and the servers are nice... however, I will NEVER go BACK again.. (well, unless, i want a heart attack...)"
Brandon G.,"Castro Valley, CA",28,12,10,3.0,3/19/2014,Sometiems its good sometimes its bad . depends on server but for a place late open and for me to order and get it and go its perfect . besides that its apple bees not house of prime rib you know what to expect .
Dom M.,"San Lorenzo, CA",0,3,2,1.0,4/20/2015,"This particular Applebee's needs to send their chefs and servers through some recurrent training. The food took near an hour for our small party of 5. Nothing difficult ordered and when we walked in, it wasn't packed at all. Then the server walked by our table at least 10 times without taking our finished plates or refilling our drinks. Ordered one dessert plate and waited another hour. Should've learned from the amount of time it took for dinner to come out but I have them the benefit of the doubt considering it was ONE plate. Close your doors or hire some new workers who can get the job done. Thanks!!!"
Ashley Smash F.,"Elk Grove, CA",51,5,,1.0,4/12/2015,"I wouldn't even give it one star but I have to for the sake of writing this review. Went there with a group of 20 after a basketball tournament at a nearby location. It took us 20 minutes to get seated. Which was perfectly fine and expected for a party as large as ours. After ordering, we waited 45 minutes to an hour for our food. Our food came out randomly. The waitress, Krystyana, didn't refill drinks, didn't bring bar drinks, didn't bring our appetizers, and brought half our tables meals. Staff there were very unprofessional. One waitress was rudely pushing through our party as we all stood up to walk out and talk with manager yelling ""EXUSE ME!"" While rolling her eyes. I over heard the manager telling his staff that he was going to have to ""throw some left elbows"". The manager was as ignorant and rude as his staff, which speaks volumes of the service at this establishment. We were threatened by staff and manager. Having kids with us, I had to remove them before things escalated due to Applebee's employee's and manager's threatening comments to our party. I would NEVER eat at this Applebee's when visiting Hayward again."
Sarah R.,"San Jose, CA",56,59,17,1.0,8/20/2013,"Sebastian is a terrible bar tender. Kept ignoring me because I was with 2 fine Mexican dudes - but they are my friends. He was probably jealous. In any case, I would recommend that he be a more attentive bar tender. I would rather tongue kiss a lizard than experience his service again."
Cassandra W.,"San Leandro, CA",144,7,2,1.0,2/25/2015,"I'm giving a low rating, not based on the food or prices. I actually think their happy hour prices are cheap! I came in yesterday after work to watch the last quarter of the Warriors game. Upon getting there, my mom and I asked one of the hostesses and then the bartender when we sat at the bar to change the channel. Why it wasn't on in the first place is beyond me. They had some college basketball game on instead. The bartender immediately went to tell the manager to change it. Apparently, the only person who has access to change the channels is the manager. We waited and waited and waited and still nothing. When he finally came out, he changed the channel alright but to the wrong station. We then had to wait even longer! We didn't get the Warriors game on until there was 5:46 left in the 4th quarter. Mind you, when we got there, I checked my phone and there was about 2 minutes left in the 3rd quarter! It's absolutely ridiculous that it took that long just to get the TV changed to a game that should've been on in the first place! I rushed from work to at least watch one quarter and only got to watch half of it thanks to the incompetent manager. I usually don't write bad Yelp reviews, but the experience was terrible and I wasn't the only customer pissed off."
Ayana K.,"San Francisco, CA",546,246,66,2.0,8/7/2013,"Well, not the best experience I have had at an Applebee. The wait staff were mainly focused on talking to eachother than paying attention to customers.  The food came out just ok. Nothing I need to go back for"
Beth Q.,"Oakland, CA",12,14,7,3.0,1/19/2012,"2 stars for the good customer service we had.. .0.5 star for the food. Fair enough? Ordered artichoke dip wit chips.. It was ok and server gave us extra tray of chips.. I had bourbon street steak which is sirloin steak  with onion and mushroom gravy and bite size baked potatoes on d side. Steak was pretty decent but it was way too salty. Potatoes also salty. Iv tried this dish at an applebees in bakersfield, and i liked it that is why i ordered here it but im disappoinred because it tasted so different, the sauce was overpowering and salty. Didn't like it at all. Mister ordered shrimp& Parmesan sirloin steak. Again, way too salty..  The side veggies were overcooked and saggy.. Blehkk.. Bill was about $50 - not worth it..  Won't eat here again.."
Fred S.,"San Marcos, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/25/2014,Don't eat here unless you want to eat with your hands and wipe your mouth with your sleeves.  Terrible service. I won't come back. Don't know this place stays in business. Stay away from this place unless your use to bad bad service. Food ok
Kody B.,"San Leandro, CA",1,34,9,4.0,2/4/2011,"You guys are all nuts, sounds like most of you don't like applebees before you eat it. I liked applebees tonight! Hadn't been in years, we went for our yelp night and enjoyed it tons. Our server was great. Came quickly with everything ( you'd think since we go out on tuesday they all would but no) she was friendly and well informed. Happy hour was fantastic they had a huge selection of drinks for half off. And appetizers for $4, so we got 3 appetizers they were all good. A bit too much sauce on the buffalo wings. The quesadilla was good ( without pico de gallo and peppers), and well  no one can mess up mozzarella sticks =). we got out with 2 drinks each and 3 appetizers for under $30 Woot! Now we know why elephant bar next door was empty last week during happy hour!  Haha I enjoy this place alot and it wasn't dirtier/ worse decorated than any other chain restaurant so not sure what these other reviewers expected in terms of high class decor ;) it was just fine for us!"
Rose A.,"Daly City, CA",368,622,3017,3.0,8/20/2011,I miss having an Applebee's in my area.  I also miss their fried cheesecake.  But my all-time favorite is the Asian Chicken Salad.  Their food is usually always decent and the service is usually pretty good.
