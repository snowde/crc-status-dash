Thomas M.,"Oakland, CA",274,72,3,3.0,1/29/2011,"First time entering this Applebee's last night @950 pm with my girl. The place was busy on a late Friday night. We felt like we were entering a club or some scene of wildness. Although some CHP officer was walking around looking for a suspect(s) when we walked in, which felt KINDA uncomfortable, but oh wells, duty calls. We were sat down about 2 minutes after we entered. The professionalism of the staff were A-OK. After browsing the menu, we decided on what to order and placed the menu on the side to signal the waitress that we are ready order and rock n roll. Bummer...It took them 5-7 minutes for them to come take our orders. Kinda long because we was extremely hungry. We ordered the 2 for $20 deal which consists of one appetizer and two entrees, which is blazing nice and cheap! -Two 7 oz House Sirlion steak served w/ mash potato, along with steamed broccoli (Upgrade $1.99 more for an 9oz) - Crunchy Onion rings - Corona beer - Service could of been quicker Total: $28 Overall, the meal was delicious, the night went well, left the building @1030ish They also have a new dish on the 2 for $20 deal, Florentine Ravioli with chicken, I will try it next time when I come back to Applebee's."
tarah d.,"San Jose, CA",14,1,,1.0,3/1/2015,"Be prepared to WAIT... From seating to appetizers, to waiters to food... Waiting over and hour minutes just for our entrees Very understaffed, many tables available but no one gets seated, waiting at least 20-30 minutes at a time."
Anna W.,"San Leandro, CA",491,576,478,2.0,12/28/2010,"Wanting to give the place another try, your leading Yelp-lady went back for a dessert visit with two of her lovely ladies a few months after the meal mishap. After being seated promptly, the menus were cracked open and pored over. Applebee's desserts are none too large, but it sounded like a good idea at the time. After all the orders had been placed, the waitress (a different one from the last unfortunate visit) scurried off. Making small talk with her friends and giggling over the latest social gossip, the time seemed to pass by quickly before the waitress returned and apologized -- evidently, the kitchen had run out of ice cream. Her two orders of dessert shooters would have to be changed, unless she didn't mind the lack of ice cream. Shaking her head, she was chagrined but changed her order because it wouldn't have been the same without the ice cream. Lifting her hands helplessly as the waitress scurried away again, she sputtered, ""I'm cursed when it comes to Applebee's!"" The rest of the evening was spent pleasantly enough, but she swore she would not return -- her experience here had simply been soured by these two visits. ...or so she thought. Months later, the boy convinced her to give them one final try. Perhaps going with a male instead of her female compatriots would break the curse. They arrived and were seated fairly promptly -- it was a weeknight and so the restaurant wasn't terribly crowded. Their glasses of water came rather slowly (though it wasn't the waitress' fault -- something about her manager requesting her to do a trivial task that he could've done himself) and her nerves were set on edge -- was the curse beginning to rear its ugly head again? Luckily for her sanity, the rest of the evening passed by rather pleasantly. There were no further mishaps with the food or with the service. The food was a little on the bland side (really, seasonal veggies do NOT amount to simply broccoli -- broccoli is a year-round veggie!) but otherwise no other complaints could be made. The curse appeared to be broken. As they left, the boy turned to his lady and inquired if she was worried about her curse returning -- she had mentioned earlier that the true test would be returning with her lovely ladies to try their service again. She shrugged and said, with a helpless laugh, ""I'm hoping it is. But unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) for them, I really don't know if I want come back to figure it out for sure."""
Tony C.,"Dublin, CA",366,307,47,2.0,8/2/2010,"Why oh why did we even venture in here?  What can be said about an Applebee's that they don't already say about themselves. Slow, and I mean tortoise who doesn't end up beating the hare, service. Manager was running around like it was his first day on the job and had his server stop taking our order after only getting 3 of the 8 of us to go wait on another table that had apparently been there longer. Food was sub par and over priced. Beer was watered down and low on Co2.  I mean all the stereotypes came true. I think I will wait another 8 years in between visits to good ol' Crapplebee's, unless I'm really feeling in the mood for diarrhea."
Jessica G.,"Hayward, CA",73,4,,5.0,2/11/2011,"To Mr. Ream & Bomber,  Right off the bat, I started the night out rough (just one of those days) and needed a drink. Luckily Doug was able to supply me w/ a cran & vodka to start out with. :) The bar & restaurant was fully packed but Doug was still able to check up on us and make sure that our glasses were never  empty. While enjoying our drinks this cute ""Mr. Jello Shot"" waiter served us jello shots all night (not as good as my gummy bear ones, but they were good ;) ).  Me & my girls enjoyed a night of fun plus a time to joke and conversate with you guys. Here is your 5 stars, you guys deserve it.  Xoxo Jessica"
Austin B.,"San Jose, CA",0,14,,1.0,4/11/2014,"I hate to give bad reviews but I would like to add to the other yelpers who have had a bad experience at this restaurant.  Our party of three experience went like this: Walked in, 5 minute wait but place was empty.  No problem. 15 minutes later we are seated, get waters fairly quickly. Put in our order, chips and salsa come out fast. Appetizer comes, we eat it, wait another 10 minutes still no waitress, water refills or dinner. Can't find out waitress to tell her we want to leave because we don't have 45 minutes to wait for dinner on what appeared to be a slow night. Finally go tell the hostess we'd like to pay for our chips and salsa and leave. She directs us to the manager where I repeat why I want to leave.  Manager is very nice, has our food in her hands and begs us to stay.   Food looked like it was just thrown on a plate because she knew we were getting anxious to leave. Our waitress is still out of sight. Manager is very kind, I felt bad leaving but she said sorry and the chips and salsa were on her. I have been to many Applebee's in my life but never one that functions like this.  I wish them luck but will not be back to experience it. What stinks about a national chain is you go there expecting they are all similar so most people probably won't read yelp reviews on Applebees but I wish I had so I could get back that night of long waits and building hunger."
Nancy R.,"Hayward, CA",21,37,8,1.0,5/21/2012,"This is the letter. I actually tried sending in to the area director. But the email listed on the receipt is wrong and the automated system takes you no where....  We have always been fans of Apple Bee's it use to be our place to go Friday nights. The food was good , and most importantly the service was great. Within the past 12 months we have noticed that we don't visit the restaurant as much as we use to. The service has not been the best, and several times I have caught myself returning my food because the waiter took the wrong information. With all that being said we decided to visit Applebee's once again this Sunday for late lunch. Honestly this has topped it off for us.  We truly do wish the service would improve. The wait was not long at all took them about 5-10 minutes to sit us down. Our waiter Michael C. took our drink order gave us a couple minutes to decide and shortly after came back to take our order.  And then it began.  Appetizers came out we waited 10 minutes before we had to remind him for the 2nd time to bring us plates.  It seems like the plates had just gotten out of the washer and were wet. The funny part is there were three of us and he only brought out two. We sucked it all up and waited for our food. I specifically told him about 3 times that I wanted no cheese on my salad. They brought out the food and there was cheese on the salad I requested the salad to be corrected and they told me it would be a couple minutes 30 minutes later I still did not have my salad. Our waiter was concerned that he had lost his personal pursue and was going all over the place trying to find it and completely forgot about the clients he had waiting. I finally got a hold of him and told him to cancel my salad order. His exact words were"" I am not sure if I'm going to be able to but I will try"".  I had to ask another gentleman that was walking around cleaning the area to get us our tab. We were running late and just needed to get out. It took another 15 minutes before the waiter came back with our tab and sure enough he tried charging for the salad that I wanted and never got. I went to the front asked to speak to a manager but apparently there was no one who could help. A gal finally deleted the order and charged me.  This has completely topped our experience with Applebee's if we were some random people I am sure we would have gotten away with just walking out on him and not paying. He was not paying any attention to what he was doing, several times we were looking for him to get his attention and he was in and out the restaurant.  We have been fans of Applebee's for a long time but this experience has been the worst.  If only the customer service had been better or manager had been on staff to apologize for the mess Michael was making this would be a different email."
John P.,"San Leandro, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/6/2013,"I would avoid this establishment at all cost if you do not want to waste time or money. This place not only have the worst service in the restaurant business but in customer service in general. I walked out of this place twice already in the past and figured I'll give it a third try last night. When you walk in don't expect to be greeted at all, instead enjoy watching the workers walk by as if you don't even exist. You won't get any help unless you initiate it and even then you'll be greeted with a rude and unmotivated workers. It seems like everyone hates their jobs here. I blame the manager who runs this place, there is no way you can walk into an establishment and find all the people working here so rude. Avoid this place at all cost, save yourself the headache."
Jennifer Z.,"San Lorenzo, CA",65,33,,1.0,3/23/2013,"This place was horrible!!! Slow service. And then my card got charged twice! Once for someone else's meal, and once for mine. Instead of charging just the difference, she charged me my entire meal. So in reality it's like I paid 90& for a 40$ meal. No compensation from manager nor any other staff. Eff that!!!!! Customer service= 0. Not gonna be returning, that's for sure."
Mary Jane P.,"Hayward, CA",142,458,166,3.0,1/9/2011,"OK so we started off kinda rocky with coming here......it was happy hour starting at 9 we had to wait for a table in the bar area to get the happy hour deals. So I put my name in and while waiting I all of a sudden noticed that a couple that walked in after me was seated...wtf??? So I know another group of people were about to leave and asked if we were next. We finally got seated and started looking at menus. I had to get up and ask the hostess for water....grrrrrr I was sooooo irritated by this point! We finally got drinks after 30 minutes of sitting at our table. This would have been 1 star if it hadn't been for jazzy lo$!!! he Pretty much saved our night. He kept our drinks coming, made sure our waitress put in our orders and he was serving us jello shots. The tequila which I didn't want to try ended up being the best. I wouldn't even have tried it except he told us 3 it was the best........he was right lol  appetizers were good, sangria was the best I've had.  He also informed us that they do beer pong??!!! wooohooo we will for sure be back"
Leesh O.,"Hayward, CA",52,145,61,3.0,5/9/2012,I do visit this place often because of the Happy Hour prices and atmosphere. However service is so hit or miss! The drinks aren't strong enough and the food is just so/so.. But it still seems like an ok place to hang out or relax w/family and friends. Just dont expect too much. Their completely under staffed always!
Aburish A.,"Hayward, CA",1,6,,1.0,6/1/2014,"Slow service especially the last couple of times I been there, seems like not enough cookers or waiters, the food took almost an hour for two simple orders and every time I check on the food status the waiter respond ""its coming up"" dude not very professional  looks stressed out"
Izzal A.,"Union City, CA",3,35,13,1.0,7/15/2012,Crappy service during happy hour in an empty restaurant. SMH
Robert M.,"Hayward, CA",29,8,,2.0,6/9/2013,"Went to the AppleBee's near Southand Mall with my girl friend, had the best steak in town their. Been eating their for over 13 years."
Janel P.,"Hayward, CA",6,34,3,1.0,5/18/2012,"The worst possible place to go if your celebrating a birthday. We went here on a Thursday night and the servers didn't seem to care if customers were waiting for however long, but they did make sure that their nails and hair was perfect and that the boyfriend was taken care of.  We asked to sit down at a booth, there were about 15 booths available, we were asked to wait a few minutes before we could get seated. OK, fine, we got seated, and no server/host showed up until about 20 minutes. Finally, place our drink and appetizer orders, the drinks come after 10 minutes. And this only, after I walk over to the bar to see if we can just order at the bar. Then the appetizers come, we asked for some extra dressing, this never showed up.  We ordered our food, dinner came at different times for all 4 of us. In addition, one of us ordered grilled salmon with veggies and mashed potatoes; the veggies were not even on the plate. We asked the server where the veggies were, she goes in some kind of incomprehensible oblivion; like ""huh, ummm......""  Then another server came over and informed us that he will bring it over soon as. As for the rest of the evening, it was pretty torturous all the way. The servers were more concerned to gather around the entrance/greeting podium and flirt with guests or maybe their friends rather than making rounds around the table.  I'm not a demanding person, but rather relaxed and easy going; however, ignorance, disrespect and inferior complex by the hosts makes me feel that they don't care whether clients show up or not.  This is not the place to take your family; but a place for happy hour beers with rowdy friends who wouldn't care to be shown any respect. Is it possible to give negative stars ?............ this place sure gets that!!!!!"
Tim P.,"San Pedro, CA",59,44,4,1.0,3/20/2012,"Being a traveller for business, I often dine alone, being a non drinker and preferring to avoid loud drunk people and their ""poor language skills"", I hate dining in the bar, but that was all that was open. The place stunk to high heavens didn't smell clean (At least at the bar) like everything had been wiped down with a stagnant rag. I ordered the Bourbon street Chicken and Shrimp, it came without the shrimp. I just wanted to eat and get out so I did. Didn't even get desert. My recommendation, try the Elephant Bar (I know I just said I don't like eating in the bar, but it is a full restaurant) right next to it That's where I'll probably go tomorrow night {8^)"
Sandi H.,"Union City, CA",7,56,39,1.0,4/5/2012,"We have been going here since it opened.  Love the easy access parking.  The service s horrible.  We used to eat thee often but the service is so poor we won't be returning.  Manager could care less about our concerns, the waiter could not get our order right the first time.  We went back, party of three, the waitress brings out two of our meals and the third like 5 minutes later and forgets the salads  Last and final time waiter forgets the salads, we asked for no sauce on the steak and who gets steak fajtas sans tortillas?  Yes he forgot those and we actually had to get up and find him to get the tortillas.  Sad, but get that feeling they won't be there much longer."
Max-Adam A.,"San Leandro, CA",578,197,52,1.0,1/29/2010,"Customer service - seated immediately, waiter took his time to greet us.  Sounded like he didn't like his job Food - tasteless ""fire pit"" burger, the mustard did its job by makin it OK. My friends chicken pasta had a sour taste, she took 2 bites and didn't eat it anymore Drinks-Sangria wasn't strong, had a punch flavor without the alcohol. I've never been a fan of Applebees, this confirms why i'm not..."
Shannon S.,"Hayward, CA",99,57,35,1.0,8/5/2012,"just went there Friday night with some friends, place is hella ghetto there was barf all over the bathroom. the booths that you sit in had broken seats in them. the waiter was a duchebag. thought he was so funny and smart but he made himself look like an ass. i wasent happy with the food either. i just got a salad and they couldnt even get that right. they gave my friend a hot skillet and never even told her it was scolding hot. (it wasent sizzling by the way) and she burned herself. our food took forever to get to us and seemed like it was sitting for a bit when we got it. we asked to talk to a manager about our time there and he said ""oh i meant to take off an entree from your recipt but i forgot and when he finally did no one would even talk to us after that. just give us ur money and hurry n get out! hella over going there. it was my first time at an Applebees and ill never return."
Ashley P.,"Fremont, CA",16,24,,2.0,11/2/2012,"This review is only for the Applebees at Southland Mall. The lunch special at applebees is awesome, but the service is terrible. I only get 30 minutes for lunch so I ordered carside to go to expedite my trip. After sitting in the car for about 5 minutes I had to get out and walk into the restaurant. I had to wait for a hostess to come over to greet me. I informed her of my carside order and she laughed and said she didn't see me. My order was $40.19 (I knnow what you're thinking and the answer is I picked up lunch for co-workers as well thats why the total is so much). I gave her $40.25 and she went to get my order. When I got back to work I realized that she did not give me my change! It's only 6 cents, but so what...it was my 6 cents. I wonder how many times in a day she short changes people and they never think to make sure they got the correct change back."
