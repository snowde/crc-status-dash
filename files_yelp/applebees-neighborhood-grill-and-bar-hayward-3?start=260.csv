Roberto N.,"Hayward, CA",0,17,,1.0,2/1/2013,"Really this chain has to improve service. All the stores I've been to always have the A / C at such a low temperature that the food always arrives cold. Much they ask for them, there's no way that these people raise the ambient temperature. I really regret going this or any other Applebee's restaurant. :("
Angela K.,"San Lorenzo, CA",295,673,1071,2.0,11/20/2009,"I would only go here when they have the 2 for $20.00 deal! Otherwise, I would not go here because it's too pricey from their menu items. I would usually order the burgers as the main entree and as for the appetizers I would order the bonless wings or the mozarella sticks. Overall, their drinks are pretty decent, but a little more expensive than their food items. As for the customer service, it's what you expected to be, not slow or fast.  If you decide to sit at the bar, you will get a faster service from there instead of sitting in the booths. The bartenders are very nice!!"
Anon Y.,"Hayward, CA",1,45,8,1.0,11/16/2013,"I think that Applebee's should provide a more consistent service. My server let it be known I was her last table of the evening. Not only because she told me several times but also because of how I was treated. She took my order then did not follow up. I received an appetizer with no plates. I received a soft drink but no refill. I received utensils but no extra napkins. I was extremely dissatisfied with my visit here at this location. When I was finished with my meal I sat there for about 15 minutes looking directly at my server who counted her tips a few tables away. Finally, when I was given my bill I saw the opportunity to take this survey. When I gave the server my card with the receipt she returned it with a duplicate receipt that did not have the survey code on it. I think she knew the experience she had provided was less than satisfactory. I asked her for the receipt that she had originally gave me she looked through the trash, then went off for about 5 minutes and finally came back. She had conveniently found it."
Chorii M.,"San Leandro, CA",46,15,14,2.0,5/7/2012,"Upon arriving to Applebee's I was seated quickly, however after being seated my server passed me several times never acknowledging me, offering water not anything. Though it was happy hour it was not extremely busy I waited 15mins before getting up and leaving. This will be my final visit"
Jose A.,"San Lorenzo, CA",198,27,,1.0,12/2/2011,"My friends showed up at 8:50pm and they were seated at the bar and were told that they would get a table in a moment, so they got some beers. I showed up around 9:05pm and were still seated at the bar. We didn't get a table until 9:15pm but we weren't given any menus and I wasn't asked if I wanted anything to drink. What upset us the most was that we were left sitting there until 9:30pm. No waiter/waitress, I didn't have a drink, and 1 of the 2 friends of mine just got off work and hadn't eaten yet. We decided to leave, by that time it was 9:35pm. On our way out my buddy told the waitress that we had been sitting over at that table waiting for someone to take our order. This woman didn't even flinch, all she said was sorry and sat the next customers at the table we just left from!"
Rachel N.,"Oakland, CA",45,68,2,2.0,4/29/2012,"All night (a Saturday night) I was debating between giving one star or two. I'd say that their saving grace for the second star was the food. Customer service here was not their best, and was made worse when the bar started to get more people. Note here, if you want fast service then you should get seated in the bar area. People who were seated after us there were getting their food before us. To be more explanatory, here's what happened. My group of 6 adults and a two-year-old got seated about 8:50. We didn't see our first server until about 9. Oh wait...sorry, she was our 'drink server'. Which she rudely made clear when we told her we were ready to order. Five minutes later were get another server come over to take our drinks. He also said that he would be taking our order. We get as far as giving out our drinks (again) and he leaves. We were left there wondering why he didn't take our order too, since we said we were ready. He comes back with our drinks and takes our order at about 9:10. Two of us ordered regular dishes, four of us order the 2 for $20 meals, and there was a child's mac 'n cheese. We didn't see any sign of the appetizers for the 2 for $20 until about 9:30, about the time the bar was starting to get into full swing. This is where we saw that people there, seated after us, were eating and yet we had nothing. I think it was about another 20 or so minutes later, we finally get our entrees. Unfortunately it was too late for the part of us with the two-year-old, who was tantruming from the late hour and lack of food she was getting. They had to pack up and leave for home....which took another 10 to 20 minutes (waiting for the check and some containers) and was a comedy of errors in itself . First he comes with the checks for everyone, and only got one out of the three right. We had to wait for him to go back and fix it. Then we find out that some of us had drinks that were competed and others that were not. We didn't bother trying to stay for dessert, cause we were worried we wouldn't get out until midnight. Mind you, though, some of the food was not bad. I had the bourbon chicken with shrimp. The flavors were exquisite, the chicken moist, and the shrimp the right texture while holding the flavors quite nicely. I tried the some of my friends three cheese penne and chicken in case I wanted to get it next time. It was alright. The combination of the cheese they used didn't really worked for me and the sauce was not real creamy. Was sadden me was, though the vegetables were flavored nicely, you could tell they were frozen due to the face that they weren't steamed very well. Most of them were mildly warm and one was ice cold."
Dylan N.,"Hayward, CA",65,16,,1.0,10/7/2013,"If I could avoid applebees I would but I ended up coming here for a friend's birthday and it was his choice. The hostess was nice enough to get my friends and I happy hour at a booth away from the bar so that was nice of her but our server was way under par of standard service. We got in around 930pm and it really wasn't that busy but our server didn't even remember to bring utensils or water until we asked for it. The borthday boy didnt even get to eat his food for 15 minutes because it took them that long to get us our utensils. Just asking for normal things like water, utensils, and ranch seemed like a troublesome task. Another friend of mine ordered the oriental salad and wanted to ask for ranch but she denied him and said it's already on the salad. I know that workers must be tired but excellent customer service isn't supposed to stop until you're off work. I've always had a bad impression of applebees before I'veeveeven tried it but this visit definitely solidified any future impressions I would've had for this restaurant."
Francie S.,"Hayward, CA",21,7,,1.0,9/12/2011,Horrible customer service no wonder they get no business and happy hour is whack . DO NOT go there ! awful restaurant chain!
Christine N.,"Union City, CA",49,68,14,1.0,6/5/2009,"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!  I think the server who had my friends and I saw us, and she just expected us to be rude drunks who dont give a hoot about anything. So then she decides to be rude to us. If you like to be ignored by servers.. this place is for you."
Thuyvi M.,"Hayward, CA",713,853,632,3.0,1/13/2010,"Applebees is not my fav but the food is ok and the prices are cheap.  The service is a little slow and the customer service is ok.  They do have lunch specials with half soup sandwich or salad.  Came here for lunch today with some coworkers ordered a Club House Grill.  It has sliced Virgina ham, oven-roasted turkey, Jack and cheddar cheese, Applewood smoked bacon, lettuce and tomato and served warm on grilled bread with mayo and honey BBQ sauce.  It seemed like it had only bbq sauce.  It was good but a little greasy.  Came with french fries but the fries tasted bland."
Maureen P.,"Oakland, CA",228,106,573,1.0,3/27/2011,"Wanna try a soggy steak? Then come dine here at night. Not only was my steak soggy to the point that a toothepick could've cut it up, but the food took more than 40 minutes to come out and our appetizers came out at the same time as the entrees. They got one entree wrong and one of the appetizers wrong, so there was an even longer wait. Plus while we were waiting, guess who we saw in the corner enjoying a cocktail? Our dam waitress! Worst service and food ever!"
Jerry G.,"Hayward, CA",78,20,6,1.0,3/28/2009,"If it wasn't for their food, I would have gave them a negative star. The only service I got was a being seated. I understand that March Madness was on the tube BUT damn after waiting for 10 minutes NOT one servant asked us for drinks or apps; even their manager on duty passed us twice and was more concerned in shooting the crap with fellow employees. Thank goodness Mimi Cafe was close by. Gave them 5 stars!!!"
Elle C.,"San Francisco, CA",3,54,5,2.0,1/8/2014,"I actually like Applebees, it's a convenient place to go during Happy Hour to catch cheap drinks and catch up with friends. I don't have high expectations for Applebees, as previous Yelpers have stated, it's a chain restaurant and it's nothing fancy. However this particular Applebees, really annoyed me last night. Usually, when we go to this Applebees, the service pleasant.(The reason for the two stars).Unfortunately, I don't recall our servers from the past, but last night I can recall the one who was serving us. Seriously, I don't know if she was on one on the job/drunk, whatever.. Tatiana 1) she spilled the ranch, joked about it that it was our fault- we had to remind her repeatedly about it btw & it took apprx 30 mins to bring it 2) messed up on our drink order and joked about spitting in the new one 3)took more than half an hour for our Happy Hour appetizers of tacos... AND THEN the spinach dip which we also had to remind her repeatedly. I don't think there was anything humorous about any of this, but she believed all of it was a joke. I also believe that we should have received a comp for the incorrect drink order as well as the unnecessary, long delay of our mini appetizers."
Krystal H.,"Daly City, CA",0,14,1,3.0,2/13/2015,"This review is strictly for lunch time. Came in around noon and got sat immediately. Our waitress, Evelyn, greeted us shortly after and took our drink orders and appetizer order. Started out with the green bean crispers which were pretty good. Nice & crispy and hot. She had a very pleasant smile and was very polite. Got stuck between a couple of menu items and she was able to help me decide. I had the 4 cheese mac & cheese. Didn't like it apparently so I sent it back and ordered something else. However, my boyfriend's plate had small plastic circles that he bit into off of his vegetables. Assuming it came from a frozen bag. We didn't send it back for a new plate because it was just plastic. Not to mention we both come from working in the food industry so we understand. Evelyn was very accommodating though, I just think the kitchen needs some work. Service was excellent, food was a little on the poor side. Wait times were very decent. Might give it s try again."
James L.,"Oakland, CA",4,152,45,1.0,6/17/2011,"6/5/11 430, half empty restaurant, cocky host. Party of two. 20min wait, no seats. It's always a hassle eating there. We left to go find a real restuarant. Tip,,fire ur host"
palma k.,"Oakland, CA",27,19,,1.0,6/10/2011,"I ordered from the office for myself and my coworkers. I drove over and p/u everything. Got back to the office everyone was so happy until we started eating. The very minimal salad greens in the caesar salad, pick a pair, were warm and the croutons were so stale we didn't eat them. The price was also an issue we were told over the phone the price was $6.99 when I paid the bill was $7.99 each plus I tipped on a take out. I called back to speak with someone about all of this and was transferred when I was telling this person the issues and  phone went dead. I called back they said ""oh we are having phone problems""...seriously?...then she put me on hold for a manager who never came. We will take our business elsewhere."
jeff c.,"Hayward, CA",110,52,28,1.0,12/27/2010,"I don't normally like giving bad reviews but this was an absolute must.  Arrived here at about 730 PM and sat at the bar for a couple quick beers and a little something to munch on. It was crowded in the restaurant but there didn't seem to be too many drink orders coming thru yet the bartender couldn't keep up at all. It took us about 10 minutes to get our beers from the time we sat down. The guy had no idea how to multitask. I also noticed that other people around the bar were waiting for drinks and to put in food orders. I just chalked it up to him having a bad day.  After people started filtering out of the bar area I noticed the thing that really bothered me. There were dirty dishes and glasses sitting on the bar 20-30 minutes after people had left and I'm not talking about a dish here or there, I'm talking about piles of plates and dirty glasses lined up. I kept waiting for the bartender, manager or someone else to notice but nothing ever happened. A couple walked in and sat down and they had a stack of dishes about a foot to their right and another gentleman walked in and had 4 dirty glasses in front of him. I couldn't believe they would leave it like that. I said something to the bartender and he was giving a bunch of excuses. He was too busy trying to get at the hostesses (who were obviously annoyed with him) rather than making sure the customers were satisfied. Despite actually liking the food I got I doubt I will be going here anytime soon. If I am going to be paying 6-7 bucks for a beer I want to at least be in a comfortable atmosphere. This place needs to clean up it's act real quick."
Tk C.,"Fresno, CA",37,62,65,3.0,4/9/2011,"expecting was not expecting such bad service!  When mybfriends andi were seated, we stayed put for over 10 minutes before we decided to call over a server.  I really don't like doing that, but nothing was happening in this section!  After another long wait, the manager came up to us and comp'd our drinks and really pushed to keep us happy.  I was very pleased with the effort afterwards!  If they gave this service when we first got here, they could have easily earned 4 or 5 stars.  Nice comeback effort."
Genevieve F.,"Hayward, CA",1,20,,3.0,3/20/2009,Wow this place is that bad for some?  I guess I'm just lucky.   My only complaint is some of the really ghetto-fied customers that eye your tips right before you leave.  LOL The food is great.  The service isn't too slow or fast.  What do you expect.  The prices aren't that bad.  I like that 2 for 20 w/ an appetizer.  The drinks probably cost as much as the food!  Very true what that fellow Yelper said that it looks like a trucker stop.  I agree!
Danielle W.,"Hayward, CA",20,151,4,1.0,10/17/2008,"I haven't eaten here since that time a cockroach crawled across our table 6 years ago.  When we complained to the manager and started to walk away, he tried to get us to pay for our food! I have friends that work in and manage restaurants.  I know that there are a certain number of bugs, but when they crawl across my table there's a problem.   Just no."
