Gaelic F.,"London, United Kingdom",0,45,1,2.0,12/4/2009,"Went there the other day for lunch. I was ok, service was good though. The place wasnt as clean as I would have like, One thing that irked me was they handed a special lunch menu but when I tried to order something from it they told me it was for Monday-Friday. I asked then why did you give it to us and she just shirked. I had the veggie pizza. It was fair but tasty. On this not they hide so little vegetarian on the menu. We also had the chicken/oriental salad which they didnt put any dressing on. Once they brought us the dressing out it was ok.  Wont go again."
Scott F.,"Hayward, CA",1,58,12,4.0,1/28/2010,"I always thought I didn't like Applebee's because of experiences years ago when I thought the food was microwaved.  But I went there recently, not once but three times for their new Happy Hour and all is forgiven. Great service, nice flat screens,three dollar mixed drinks,22 ounce premium beer for 3.50 , four buck appetizers and a delicious one dollar slider. I actually might try a regular meal."
Michael H.,"Hayward, CA",319,1403,650,2.0,11/5/2008,"What is up with this place.  I've been to the typical chains: TGIF, Tony Roma's, Chevy's, etc; but this place has the atmosphere of a trucker diner.  The lighting feels dim and the noise level akin to a old folks home.  The only persistent sound that can be found is a whirring sound coming from the bar's blenders. We were seated at a high table with bar-like chairs.  There are pretty big flat screen televisions showing different sports events.  This isn't a bad thing, but it turns out to be overly distractive. Our waitress was fairly attentive.  She kinda forgot to give us certain things we asked for.  I have no real gripes since it looked like she had a long day. The food is ""eh"".  Middle of the road American food with absolutely no interesting twists.  I was amused to find ""turkey sandwich"" on the menu with a ""NEW"" symbol next to it.  What the heck is so new about a turkey sandwich?! They have this deal: 1 appetizer and 2 entrees for $20.  The items are of course limited in selection.  It sounded good enough so my friend and I both had the bacon cheeseburger with spinach dip.  My other friend had a burger quesadilla.  It's essentially a quesadilla with a hamburger patty.  Yum/yuck? Our appetizer arrived hot and good lookin'.  The spinach dip dish is rather shallow.  The spinach dip itself is tasty.  A kind of tasty in the area of 1800-2100 calories.  The tortilla chips looked like broken leftover bits.  We asked for some additional chips and they gave us an entire tray of chips. The entrees are alright.  The burger was surprisingly decent.  No frills, just basic cholesterol goodness.  It was so heart heavy that I only ate half of it.  The fries taste artificial much like Burger King. I'm still confused as to why so many people go to Applebee's."
I'Love'Food K.,"San Pablo, CA",0,18,7,1.0,11/2/2011,"I usually go to the Applebees in Alameda... i should've went there this time. My group of 22 showed up to a nearly empty Applebees as always, this time in Hayward, In short we were turned away as the manager stated they didn't take groups like ours after 9. Another couple who overheard the conversation (and happened to be white) refused to eat there as they said they always pop in with their family and friends at that time of night and what the Asst Manager was doing was blatant racial discrimination. While we spoke with the AM the waitress seated 17 ppl and there were still many seats left. I even have pics of the empty sections. After hearing the complaints of the other customers he said that we can be seated in an hr, but we can't sit in the empty seats and our crowd was to large to wait in the waiting area. We were forced to find somewhere else to eat."
Patrick A.,"San Lorenzo, CA",101,126,17,4.0,10/7/2010,"Some crazy deals here during happy hour! And the staff is super nice here too. Foods mediocre, but with beer and friends around... its a good time."
Naomi B.,"San Ramon, CA",0,13,,3.0,2/21/2012,2 stars for the food. 1 star for the service. My boyfriend and I recently went on a Sunday for late night happy hour. You definitely can't go wrong for the prices of appetizers and drinks but the service was just awful. We sat ourselves at a high top bar table and it took about 10 minutes for someone to come over and acknowledge us/give us menus. What was frustrating about the situation was waiters/waitresses were just standing around the bar talking and not helping/waiting on tables. We were very disappointed. I would NOT recommend this Applebee's because it for sure is NOT the friendly neighborhood bar and grill this franchise advertises to be.
Nancy F.,"Santa Clara, CA",5,141,21,2.0,6/2/2009,"This is a typical ""american"" style place. we went on a saturday for lunch for their 2 for 20. our service was good, so i guess it's just your luck. the waitress apologized for not getting to us sooner (but we didnt wait that long) and offered us soft drinks on the house. we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip,3 cheese penne pasta, and firehouse bacon burger. the appetizer was good, but the pasta could use more chicken and sauce. and the burger doesn't compare to red robin's so i was disappointed."
Janet M.,"Oakland, CA",3,15,,1.0,10/15/2010,I recommend to anyone who reacts to MSG that they not eat here - it might cause a severe reaction as it did me. After eating there last night I had insomnia so bad that I didn't get to sleep until about dawn. What's worse is my body and head are really aching.
James L.,"San Mateo, CA",17,72,,2.0,12/21/2011,"Really heavy and greasy food, and despite all that grease, still didn't taste great. I've definitely had better."
Christopher S.,"Oakland, CA",68,45,6,4.0,6/17/2013,"eh, its applebees. sometimes the food is good, sometimes its okay. havent really had a bad experience."
Michelle C.,"Castro Valley, CA",141,319,28,3.0,3/17/2011,Ehhh!   You have been to one Applebees you been to them all. I am giving this one a 3 star rating because on a cold December evening  we went in looking for a yummy value meal and were coming up short on options. We got the manager to trade out a cheese burger in place of the other value meal option on the menu. That was very helpful indeed.
Jan S.,"Oakland, CA",10,43,,3.0,8/9/2009,"We go here a lot to meet friends and family. It is wise to order your cocktail or drink when you are seated, sometimes they are a little slow.  If you order something pay attention to the picture or description because when you get served it may not match either. Just mention the discrepancy and they will take care of it. Sometimes the staff is slow on orders but the food is pretty good. It is a chain and usually the staff is young adults that are learning the trade."
Keane L.,"San Francisco, CA",1007,1106,216,2.0,9/16/2006,"Applebee's, the retarded cousin of Chili's and Chevy's, fails to please yet again. Reliable Chili's has the quality American fare with the southwest kick, while senor Chevy's is the guy you want to get wasted with. Applebee's, on the other hand, offers no personality and little quality.  Just look at the menu: steak, teriyaki bowl, tostada, a chicken wrap? This place is more schizo than an episode of Robot Chicken, with one-quarter the taste. The ciabatta on my ""bistro"" steak sandwich was so chewy, I swear it was microwaved. It was also really greasy and small. So greasy, that the sliced pickles on my plate were also greased (I wish I was kidding). The garlic toast that came with my salad was soft and near-mushy. And how about a refill? I saw you look at my glass. I shouldn't have to ask.  Eat here if you don't like waiters. Place your order, then ~poot!~ he's a fart in the wind."
Valerie M.,"San Leandro, CA",111,62,718,2.0,9/3/2010,"Came here after my softball game late Friday evening. To my surprise it looked like a ghost town, YES on a Friday. We had 2 orders of chicken wings (Buffalo and BBQ) then rounds of drinks. They were very limited on the beer selections and my buddies said that their mixed drinks were very weak. It took 20 minutes just to get that round with all but 15 people in the entire restaurant. So as we watched the wait staff stand around and chit chat we ate our yummy gooey chicken wings. We ordered another round and had to send one of those drinks back Yes, a Margarita with a Martini shaker and Martini Olives. They were nice and took that off the bill then made her another drink that was soooo strong that if she finished it she would have been carried out!! I give it 2 stars because the chicken wings were yummaaay! Next time ill go to Fridays, Elephant Bar or Chili's instead."
Angelina M.,"Allen, TX",176,258,43,2.0,2/11/2010,"I should know better. The honey wanted to meet up for a quick lunch and seeing as how I was super eager to see him I said YES to Applebee's without even thinking. I had the ceaser salad and it was super mushy. The chicken was good, the croutons didn't go with the salad. He got the Chinese salad(?) He ate most of it. Iced tea was good, our server didn't bug us which was nice. Next time I think I'll try and talk him into E bar. :)"
Daryl Y.,"San Francisco, CA",116,80,6,1.0,1/19/2010,"I've been in this restaurant about a half dozen times and I have not been impressed. The last time I went, our waitress was very rude even though I was as warm and polite as I could be. Food was slow to come out, and drinks were never refilled. There were three discrepancies on the receipt totalling 16 dollars, and the waitress was adamant that she did not make any mistakes. I explained in detail the discrepancies, and she says ""Ohhh-"" but there was no apology for calling me a liar. correcting the mistakes on the receipt, she accidentally charges us another table's tab, and was again adamant that she charged the right amount. The place is not clean, the 2 dollar pints really cost 4 bucks and they are half a pint, and the staff is very unfriendly. I regret taking my family to this place."
Maureen M.,"San Mateo, CA",0,5,,5.0,7/8/2012,"So my car broke down late last night off the freeway, and I had to park into the applebees and wait for a tow.  It was closing time there, but everyone was soooooo nice in letting me and my sister stay and wait for our tow while they closed down.  Though I don't regularly go to the East Bay (I live in San Mateo) Applebees great hospitality has definitely enticed my to go back!"
Cynthia B.,"Hercules, CA",912,1062,87,3.0,12/21/2007,"First of all I don't like Applebee's.  This is a average Applebee's location.  Perhaps a little below average.  Too pricey for the food and drinks you get, just like every other Applebee's.  Friendly service.  Very weird parking lot layout, it's like a maze made by someone who has never drawn one before.   This location should be open much later.  I wish that customers would come together and demand better food and interior decoration that isn't such an eyesore."
Chris A.,"Hayward, CA",20,18,2,1.0,3/26/2012,Manager just asked us to leave because genus short in servers!!!! Reapply bad bad service
Jess O.,"East Bay, CA",95,259,36,4.0,9/2/2010,"Its all about the HH! I've never been here for dinner or an actual meal, so I can't comment on that. But I do enjoy their happy hour!  Cheap appetizers, cheap drinks! how can you lose? You definitely won't be losing any weight. That's for sure! I usually get the Wonton Tacos and make my bf get the Hot Wings or Boneless Chicken. I gotta have my Hot Wings. The Nachos are huge! So get it to share. It's a chain restaurant so it's as much as you can expect from a chain. It's good for the price and fun to meet with friends.  HINT: if you are health conscious get the Chicken Wonton Tacos they have the least calories of all the appetizers. Also, HH doesn't include the sampler plate."
