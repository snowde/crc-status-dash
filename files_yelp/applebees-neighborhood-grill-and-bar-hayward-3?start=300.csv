Lisa L.,"Hayward, CA",2,99,,2.0,6/28/2012,always super crowded on wait list.  ur bumping elbows with the table next to u.  Its better to go hella sexy and get fukd up at the bar.
Ty H.,"Hayward, CA",1,60,1,2.0,2/19/2010,"It doesn't matter if there are 3 tables of people or if the whole restaurant is filled the service here sucks!  I went here the other day and it wasn't that busy in fact we were seated instantly. Then it went downhill from there. We sat and waited for 20 minutes before even being recognized. We ended up going to the bar and ordering our own drinks! When the server finally came over she took our food orders and  then we didn't see her again until it was time for the bill. We had to have the manager Katie help us out. Needless to say we ended up tipping out the manager and not our lost server.  Horrible service, yummy boneless buffalo wings and beer!"
Dianna P.,"Hayward, CA",0,34,,1.0,9/8/2009,"Eck, I've been here two or three times... And they were all such horrible experiences I don't know why I even came back a second and third time... They are VERY slow, servers are not very nice and neither are the other guests (there seemed to be a lot of racist people as we walked by the second time we were there). Food was below average and portions were very small (compared to other Applebees I've been to). Managers were not too helpful when we complained. Even the group next to us was talking about how much that place sucked. In fact, they left a message for the waitress saying ""You suck"". It was immature... but it was funny because it was true."
Jan S.,"Hayward, CA",0,9,,1.0,7/6/2014,"This Applebees used to be really good.  Great service and good food.  Tonight was another story.  We were seated and we waited for someone to take our drink orders.  We were seated right by the front.  We were looking at our menus when one of the hosts asked if our waitress had been by our table and we told him no.  He said he would go and find her.  She came and took our drink and food orders because by this time we were ready for them to be taken.  The food took awhile to get to the table.  They didn't seem to be very busy at this time.  The food got there.  My Dad ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad.  Some of the croutons on the salad tasted stale others were soggy. He wasn't really happy with it and said he had, had better salads.  My Chicken dish with mushrooms and other veggies was okay.  My brother said his Fiesta Chicken was good.  Overall thought, not a good experience. Sorry to say we will probably not be back.  So sad as Applebees used to be one of our favorite go to places.  It seems from reading the other reviews of this location a lot of customers have had the same experience that we had. Sad :("
Dave I.,"Camarillo, CA",0,16,,1.0,8/30/2011,"I guess I should've read a few reviews before venturing in at 7:30pm.  On business, so I'm eating alone and apparently must not look very service-worthy.  I got seated right away by the mgr and got a menu and my drink order taken shortly thereafter.  14 minutes later (according to my cell phone), the drink still hasn't arrived and it doesn't look like I'll get my order taken anytime soon.  I hand my menu and silverware back to the clueless waiter, who said, ""hey, thanks.""  I guess he thought I was eating with my hands.  I would've...if I'd only been able to get some food.  I'm not alone in thinking the service is slow and indifferent - and trust me, I had plenty of time to contemplate the service.  But you can only stare at other people eating just so long, then you have to leave and go someplace where your business is actually appreciated.  It's not Applebee's."
Mr. M.,"Vallejo, CA",133,5,,1.0,12/16/2012,"Warning! Horrible service! Antonio greeted us and did not offer us anything! we waited for 30mins And still nothing! Through the night we waited for our appetizers and it took at least another 20mins to be served! Once our orders came in, he also gave us the wrong food, and we also waited another 20-30 mins to get the right order! Horrible service! Do not go deal with this Applebee's! Go next door to elephant bar!"
Hoa B.,"Santa Monica, CA",113,11,20,2.0,8/1/2010,Had the sampler.  Chicken Wings were super dry and the blue cheese dip was weird.  the cheeseburger sliders were also super dry...  waitress kept ignoring me.  I wouldn't come back here again for the food.  that's for sure.
Gabby H.,"San Leandro, CA",56,100,,1.0,6/1/2009,"WORST APPLEBEE'S IN CALIFORNIA!!! The waitress just dropped some menu's on our table and left w/o mentioning if she was coming back. We waited at least 15 minutes w/o our waitress and water. When I tried to call over the manager to our table she instead stands exactly where she was and expected me to yell at her clear across the room. Already pissed off, me and my group decided to just get up and leave. Applebee's lost their business to TGIFridays that day."
Gabe F.,"Oakland, CA",366,283,,2.0,4/10/2009,"Crapplebee's. A blind, narcoleptic chimpanzee would have provided better, more competent service.Waited forever for a server, waited forever for the drinks, waited forever for my burger, it was like the D.M.V. only with food.The one bright spot, that bartender knows how to make a kick ass bloody mary, 2 stars for that."
Michele D.,"Hayward, CA",5,4,,2.0,9/5/2012,"Normally go to the Union City Applebees, but was in Hayward so decided to go there. Order from the 550 calorie menu a steak and herb shrimp (on top of steak with some sauce) with veggies and herb roasted potatoes, plate delivered with garlic mashed and no shrimp. I told him I thought it was wrong and ask for the menu, his excuse was they don't have that anymore (there was a big picture of it at the table besides it being in the menu) , they were out of garlic shrimp, but would bring me some shrimp.  Few minutes later got some cold shrimp, tasted cajun probably and some time of herb or pesto sauce( the sauce was white in the picture), he later brought me some herb potatoes.  His excuse was they didn't have that anymore and I do see after checking the website that they have changed that item, but it was still advertised all over the Hayward restaurant.  Service was slow, didn't ask how I wanted my steak cooked and the pen he brought to sign the bill didn't work.Over all not impressed.  When  you are ordering from a low calorie menu, substituting garlic mashed potatoes without asking is not acceptable."
Michelle G.,"San Leandro, CA",1,7,,2.0,11/1/2012,"applebees is ok , theyre getting really sloopy and you know when you food comes out you get happy cause it looks so good well lets say i was happy cause it finnaly did come out and not how it look ..

kris v.,"Alameda, CA",67,94,7,5.0,1/13/2010,"Great service, pretty waitresses, good food"
William L.,"San Mateo, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/17/2012,"My girlfriend,my mom and I ended here for dinner over the weekend. I was very DISAPPOINTED in all aspect of the resturant. The service was VERY POOR!!! WE ask for water and order our drinks at the same time, our drinks came b4 our water. The worst part was our entrees , my mom order and I order the sirloin steaks and the side dishes. The steaks were VERY SALTY, potatoes were under cook, the veggies weren't cooked to our specifics, sauteed onions were NOT SAUTEED. We will never go back. Don't waste your money.  I would prefer the Elephant Bar."
Billy S.,"San Leandro, CA",348,158,21,3.0,4/4/2009,"It's a chain so the food isn't great. Actually, I'm not sure if they have it any more but, they had a really good asian chicken wrap. it had this tasty mandarin orange sauce. Anyway, for the price the food is good enough and there's plenty of seating available. the waitstaff has always been courteous and on top of things everytime i've gone to eat there. Parking is never a problem as this restaurant is located withing the same vicinity of the Southland Mall. All in all this place isn't a bad place to eat by any means. Hell they even featured it in Taladega Nights, so if Ricky Bobby likes it, so should you."
Tony T.,"Hayward, CA",6,75,15,3.0,6/6/2011,"Service was ok.  The hostess was the only negative we experienced at the restaurant.  Walked in this past Saturday afternoon.  Business was slow by the look of the crowd because only one side of the restaurant was occupied.  We waited almost 5 minutes to be seated!  Besides that,  our server was helpful and always checked up on us."
Nat P.,"San Leandro, CA",45,14,4,4.0,11/23/2009,"I dont know why everyone always rips on Applebees!  Yea its a crappy restaurant, but the food is tasty and the service is decent.  I guess they think its fun but i happen to be a waitress there (for the past year in fact) and i must say the only thing that sucks here are 75% of the customers.  Let me give you all some pointers:  If you need something like a refil or extra sauce etc... try not to name them one by one each time i bring the thing you previously asked for back to your table.  Dont be condecending.  And the most important thing; you chose to come and eat here so stop complaining, you know what we're about, one knotch above Macdonald!  FOR GOD SAKES, stop acting like this is a five star restaurant! ITS APPLEBEES!!! Four stars because like i said, its not a five star restaurant!"
Danielle G.,"San Lorenzo, CA",31,14,,3.0,8/15/2011,"I always have good service and food has its ups and downs. I haven't been in awhile, i received bad spinach artichoke dip and got very sick off of it. I know you can get food posioning so easily but that completely turned me off from this place for awhile. I always get mozerella sticks they are the best and i love the 2 for 20 deal it's awesome."
Lewis F.,"Hayward, CA",84,33,,1.0,10/9/2007,"Horrible, horrible service!!!  There were only two of us, and though we were seated right away, that was the end of our service.  It was about 11:30 am on a Sunday, and it wasn't that busy.  In fact, there were several servers standing around talking with each other while we were basically ignored.  After 15 minutes of no acknowledgement whatsoever, we got up and left.  No one on the staff even bothered to ask us to stay or apologize for the non-service.  I wish I could give a zero star rating.  Avoid this particular  rathole of rudeness like the plague!"
Christa M.,"Oakland, CA",3,18,,1.0,6/8/2009,"""Applebees Southland Hayward, CA  Went to applebees on May 19th and after having the manager bring me a dirty plate of food, having horrible service, and having to wait to eat myself being the birthday person, and having to wait for drinks although I have a diabetic member in my family, we were not a party of 4 happy people.  The staff and management her are not customer service oriented people. They don't seem to worry about giving bad service it's a normal thing for them. That was my last meal at Applebee's! And I had been going to this location for over 7 years when it was a 3 star rating and the quality has just declined!"" Bad server was Ashely P. and  the Manager"
Chris K.,"Livermore, CA",218,1178,230,2.0,1/19/2008,"Decent service , decent food, just my recommendation don't come here with HIGH expectations, its like a step up from Jack in the Box with a Full Bar!"
