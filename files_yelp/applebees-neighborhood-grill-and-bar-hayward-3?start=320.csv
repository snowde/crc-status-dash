charlotte s.,"Stavanger, Norway",92,1233,31,2.0,2/26/2007,"i came here a few times when i lived in hayward and this restaurant had just opened up not too long ago... which now is quite a long time ago... the food back then as i remember, was decent, but nothing extraordinary... i'm sure i don't feel the same now... there's a few other chain restaurants i'd go to before going to applebees"
Esther G.,"Hayward, CA",51,11,1,1.0,3/29/2012,"i was at applebees hayward location earlier this week and the service, food, and drinks were just not worth my time and money. I had ordered potato twisters as my appetizers and the potatoes had oil residues on it looks black and oil dripping! i than asked the waiter to change it and he came back in less than 5 minutes with the same looking plate. it was weird how it took them almost 30mins to get my appetizer and when i requested it to be changed he got me my appetizer in less than 5mins!! the food sucked! it was a big plate with half the plate empty! my brother had ordered one of their sizzling plates which was not even sizzling! the drinks was all ice!! the server gave me the bill when i wasn't half way done and the server had not checked on us!! bad bad customer service! i will not go back to applebees hayward location! it was really disappointing! and the bills was almost 45$ !!! comeonnnn 45$ ...wasted my money!! go else guys...we spend so much we deserve better service and food!"
Cremaster T.,"San Ramon, CA",0,7,,3.0,1/7/2010,"We go here fairly often as it's my daughters favorite restaurant.  They love the mac and cheese as well as the appitizers.  We've sampled much of the menu which is actually pretty good.  The service can be pretty slow but the wait is usually pretty short, even at peak times which is nice when you have small children."
