Brittney B.,"Oakland, CA",113,154,172,4.0,1/29/2016,"It was applebees...  I went on a thursday evening to wait out the rush hour commute traffic and ordered the ""pick 2"" bar bites (chicken wings and nachos) for $9 and the bahahama mama, which was an all-day special for $4 I was actually impressed by the quality of the wings... they were much better than I'd expected... The bartender made my drink well and was such a sweetheart! I'm surprised by the negative reviews for this place as my experience was great.. I mean its Applebess (a cheap chain bar and grill)... you can't reallly go in with high expectations to begin with..."
Damian C.,"San Francisco, CA",315,1,,5.0,5/9/2017,Ashley was such an amazing waitress. She took care of our every need and super accommodating. Plus love the steak and shrimp.
Art P.,"Hayward, CA",0,6,,4.0,4/29/2017,Great service good food I live Applebees fish and chips  server was great it was buddy but we were served in time .
U.R. K.,"Hayward, CA",0,25,,2.0,4/29/2017,We had to wait about 4 minutes for a table  which wasn't a problem but they seated us at a table that hadn't been wipe off yet an lacked place settings.   When around us were table clean and ready to go.  Food was okay I ordered a pasta dish which seemed to be watered down and lacked taste.  When the server brought our meals she asked if we needed by thing else which we asked for forks.  She didn't ask us if we wanted dessert and just brought us the check which she placed in front of me instead of my date.  I asked for a box and she brought it and placed it in front n of my date.....attention to detail was not her thing.
Debbi C.,"San Leandro, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/31/2017,"If I could give NO stars I would.   Had the WORST service last night.  Hostess sat us at our table, it took about 15-20 minutes for waitress to come to our table to take our drink order.  She took our drink & food order at the same time.  Then we had to wait 20 minutes for our drinks.  At this point I had asked to speak to the manager because we wanted to pay for just our drinks and we were out of there.  He followed the waitress out with our food.  Told them we were getting ready to leave, but we'll eat.  Husband bite into his food & it was COLD.  He ended up taking his whole meal to go & heated in microwave at home."
Sue H.,"Union Square, San Francisco, CA",4,21,33,1.0,2/21/2017,"Service here was slow and it wasn't even busy. Our waiter Manny was slow, no water refills, messed up our order and still charged for missing items. I had to go to the bar to ask for water for our group. Food was great tho!"
Juanita O.,"San Leandro, CA",0,6,,4.0,4/5/2017,"This is my second review for this location.  It has improved from 2 to 4 stars.  We went in last Saturday at lunch time, and we were promptly seated.  The server was very nice and attentive.  I have no complaints on the service, my complaint is on my all time favorite Asian chicken salad.  This salad was my favorite, and I ordered it almost every time, until they CHANGED it and not for the better.  I am talking about a full size salad that I am paying $11 for, and this is what I got:  a very large bowl with a ""handfull"" of not so fresh romaine lettuce, grilled, sliced small chicken breast, and salad dressing on side!  The side salads are bigger than this one. This is what the salad used to be like: big bowl 2/3rds filled with shredded green and purple cabbage, crispy noodles, some type of seeds and I think sliced almonds, with nice chicken and dressing.  This is the way I loved it and the way Asian salads are served elsewhere. Whats up with the romaine lettuce?  at least give enough to look like a dinner salad; it's not that expensive.  Very disappointed!"
Omni H.,"Hayward, CA",0,34,12,5.0,2/22/2017,"This post is for happy hour specifically.. The margaritas are 3.99! I repeat 3.99 from 9-closing..for the nonbelievers, I repeat 3.99! You can't beat that price anywhere in the bay area, and they were pretty strong and tasty. You should try one, and for 3.99 you can't go wrong."
Domonique T.,"Oakland, CA",1,16,45,5.0,12/22/2016,"Kristine is AWESOME and is a excellent Hostess/Server.She was so nice,Made sure we were taken care of and Hooked us up.....MY Margarita was awesome as well :-)"
Janelle S.,"Discovery Bay, CA",117,23,5,1.0,11/17/2016,"Just don't come here! We came here 5:40 ordered drinks and mozzarella sticks. Ordered our 4 cheese burgers for 4 people (super complicated order I know) at 5:45 Our drinks showed up around 6:20 and our appetizers around 6:30. People who got here after us had already gotten their food and left at this point.  Our drinks sucked they were so sweet and disgusting, also probably no alcohol in the margarita. Our food didn't arrive until 6:40 and at that point 3 out of the 4 burgers arrived. I had to wait another 10 minutes to get my burger. All of my friends fries were cold and burgers over cooked and burnt. So seeing as the food wasn't fresh and warm chance are our waitress just forgot us. Then when it came to finally bringing us our bill it was wrong, no surprise. Like really wrong like another tables bill wrong... saddest part of the night was that the place wasn't even busy.  Currently still at the restaurant waiting to pay this wrong bill so stay tuned if more crazy stuff goes wrong. Moral of the story, go somewhere else buddies brews is near by and amazing, the Mexican is near by and also 1,000 times better. Good luck with your eating desires."
Jeverlyn L.,"Union City, CA",9,2,1,5.0,5/25/2016,"The manager is really nice guy....  his name is Chuck Findley! Very friendly!  definitely, I will be back.. Craving Satisfied, Good management...."
Salina C.,"San Lorenzo, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/25/2017,"Awful service, I believe the bar tender/servers name was Miguel he was awful not to mention he had his friends lingering & sitting around the bar cussing up a storm and saying very inappropriate comments SUPER LOUD. Anyone that was in the area could hear. So unprofessional. Will NOT be coming back here."
Francisco L.,"San Mateo, CA",3,11,3,3.0,3/7/2017,"Reasonably good. Their spinach-artichoke dip is very good. I had their 12-once Butcher's steak. The steak itself was ok, but the sides...... not that much. The really down side of this experience was the service. The food takes too long to come to the table, even when the restaurant is not too busy. The server was not exactly friendly or polite....."
Cynthia R.,"Hayward, CA",1,8,1,3.0,7/8/2016,OK so last month I ordered the before chicken and they team out of onion strings. Today I ordered it again. Great waiter but the runner was clueless. I had no knives husband's backed potatoe had no better or sour cream and mine had no gravy. Sad
Nene R.,"Berkeley, CA",14,249,,1.0,5/9/2016,"Mom wanted this....really, really badly. No amount of cajoling would do.  I think she likes it for their two for $20 deals when she goes with her other senior citizen friends.... So, so bad.  Items not as described on menu.  When you ask about it, waitress just shrugs and says ""that's what it is"".   Lackluster and lackadaisical come to mind. First the appetizers: you get two for $10 The two we want, they don't have.  So we go with her suggestions of the shrimp and the mini tacos.  Neither one if us ate more then our initial taste:  shrimp had a heavy mayo sauce and tacos used old BBQ chicken tough to chew. Mom got a steak dish with m.potoes and gravy...not cooked to her request for medium rare...really well done.  sent back and came back the same....and they must have just reused the same plate as potatoes were cold and gravy congealed.   Asked  for something new...and they still charged 1\2 price for the original! I thought I would be safe with the waitresses suggestion of the 3 brisket enchiladas.  What arrived was a tortilla with a spoonful of meat covered by another tortilla, some enchilada sauce and a gagging amount of semi melted cheese.  So.... I say this isn't as described or pictured on the menu.  Waitress gets the menu reads and then says "" it equals the same thing"" and turns to leaves...I ask for a house salad instead of the meal.  Bill had the meal...but no charge for the salad.  So, she tried?!? Not sure what the deal is here:  I think they just don't care.    If I could give no stars.  I would.  Hate it when I spend my hard earned money on crappy food and service.  Enough said."
Sugey G.,"Pittsburg, CA",13,15,15,1.0,4/27/2016,Horrible food ! Undercooked bacon! Who does that? I understand burnt but undercooked? Lets be Real now. The only reason I gave this one star was because our waiter was great. She understood the issue and brought a plate of bacon well done without a hassle.
Elizabeth G.,"Hayward, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/31/2016,"Wish I could give -Stars. I walked into the Applebee's at Southland Mall in Hayward and waited over 20 minutes and still my ""to go order"" was not taken. Trust me there were two ladies in front of me who had made their ""to go order"" and I was totally ignored. Are you kidding me - there wasn't even a waiting line to be seated. So I left and called the location to speak with the manager. The person who answered stated she would get the manager and 10 minutes later I hung up.  I Do Not Recommend the AppleBees in Hayward!!!"
Mel G.,"Oakland, CA",11,187,235,3.0,6/15/2015,Applebee's usually ain't my thing and I would prefer chilis but this time the food was actually good. We were seated right away and our waitress was nice. Hubby had the steak with shrimp and garlic mashed potatoes and I had the maple bacon chicken wrap which was yummy too. We shared the salsa verde nachos that had a good flavor.  Don't care about coming back as the options don't really call me lol it's just whatever lol
Andy K.,"San Bruno, CA",46,4,4,1.0,11/30/2016,"For a long time this was my absolute favorite Applebee's to eat at. That is, until I ordered a hamburger and found a COCKROACH cooked into it. I left with my party, so disappointed, hungry and unable to eat at an Applebee's again."
Philip C.,"Oakland, CA",0,16,12,1.0,12/27/2016,I can tell you this the star rating is on par for this place the service could not be any more lousy. The food was OK however again the service of some of the worst I've ever hadI don't think the server got anything right on our order I hate to complain but it is what it is the service sucks here I'll never be back
