Kelly H.,"Hayward, CA",56,1,,1.0,4/21/2016,"I wish I could give this less. We are new to the area, after flying back from a few days in my hometown we decided to go to Applebee's for a quick bite. We were greeted quickly by a hostess but everyone in the bar was distracted by the end of a game.  We were sat in a section with other tables, one was wrapping up and two were eating. A good 10-15 minutes we sat there. Servers watched the end of the game in front of our table. No one even noticed we were there.  I went and asked to speak to the manager, who said he would start our order but didn't really care. At that point I was so frustrated I wouldn't want to give them the sale or the tip.  Very disappointed because we're locals and would have enjoyed this as a close place for a quick bite and drink."
John T.,"San Leandro, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/7/2017,Craving a steak but didn't want to drive far to get one. Haven't been to Applebee's in a while. Never ordered a steak there before. Ordered the Bourbon Street Steak Medium Rare. Wife ordered Medium. Steak came out Medium Well the wife's was well. So we mentioned it to the manager so she could correct the cook. She told us that the steaks come out on the sizzling hot plates and they keep cooking. We should next time order steaks more rare to compensate for the cooking. If the steaks keep cooking after they bring them out the cooks should no how to cook them so they are not overdone when they are served.Should not be up to the customer to know how the cook is cooking the steak. One the worst steaks I have had in a long time. Even the Red Potato's that came with the steak were under cooked. Very hard like half cooked.The manager did comp us a couple dollars off each plate but that doesn't fix how the steak is prepared.
Hanzzeh Y.,"El Monte, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/24/2017,"Walked in, told waitress 1. She looked a bit unconcerned. Waited a few minutes despite obviously open seats. Several waitresses walked by, they socialized a bit, laughing about stuff and things. and I simply left."
Mar L.,"San Francisco, CA",8,75,216,2.0,4/8/2016,"What the heck is up with this place? We walked in and no one was up front to greet customers. Someone finally appeared when we were about to just seat ourselves at the bar. We asked to sit at the bar area and the host looked confused. There were plenty of tables open. There was a VERY, VERY LOUD female bartender who was speaking about personal things about herself & other coworkers & using very inappropriate language. My husband and I looked at each other several times and asked ""Did you hear that?"" ""Did she really just say that???"" The male bartender working with her just laughed and kept his words to a minimum. We watched people wait & wait for tables when they appeared to be well staffed and definitely had a lot of tables open. Some even pointed out all the empty tables but still had to wait. The bright spot was our waitress who was always smiling and very attentive to all her customers. She joked and laughed with everyone and gave her honest  opinions about food selections."
Tony D.,"Sacramento, CA",3,6,2,2.0,5/14/2016,"Portions are extremely small (kid size portions)... If you are on a diet then that's fine... If you're hungry, best to pre-eat prior to coming!"
Sven S.,"Hayward, CA",27,27,92,2.0,7/31/2015,"Not set up for To Go business. No place inside specific to To Go orders. To Go order not done as specified in the on-line order.... Now more than 15 minutes late... Triple Hog Dare Ya is not worth the money and in no way resembled the sandwich depicted - no onion straws to be found and seriously undercooked bacon! Same goes for the Brew Pub Philly... No jalapeños found in this one. The Sweet Asian Pineapple Burger was a sad little burger, this miniature burger ($11.) was smaller than the Big Mac...and none of the pineapple was actually in the burger as it is described, slapped on top.  Overall the experience was a flat zero! Will I go back...absolutely not to this Southland Dr location. Too expensive for the mess we got!"
Sel M.,"Hayward, CA",58,4,2,1.0,4/22/2017,"It never fails...The service here lacks tremendously! First they didn't put the order in for 2 of our appetizers. Then I had to ask 3 different times for napkins...The third time our waiter had the nerve to give me a dirty look, as if to say I was on his nerves! We had to ask for refills. Then our food finally arrived...and they tell us your chicken strip basket will be out in a few minutes... After 15 minutes we ask about the food again and he says ""we're working on it now, I didn't put the order in."" We then ask for the bill and the manager comes to our table and asks what the problem is...REALLY?!?!? Now we get the bill and its over $130.00, For two 2 for $20's, a chicken sandwich and a corn dog! Really?!?!! SMH...Like I said it never fails!!!"
Jux T.,"San Mateo, CA",0,17,,1.0,3/12/2017,We walked in and saw a medium empty bar. Let's sit there!  Was told this location is not self seating in the bar. Weird #1. It just kept getting weirder and the vibe was off so we left. No orders. Went to Famous Dave's right behind. Found a new favorite restaurant. Save yourself the headache.  Go to Famous Dave's.
Ken L.,"San Leandro, CA",180,134,449,1.0,4/28/2016,"The food was awful! The only thing I liked about this place is the fact that they had these media devices on our table that allowed us to pay our bill without waiting for the waitress. Yeah, the food is cheap and cheap is what you get.  If you're a drinker, you'll probably have a better time at the bar instead of dining."
Rick L.,"San Jose, CA",155,93,14,2.0,8/3/2016,My bad for not looking at the rating.  Very slimy tactics.  Billing for some game was odd as I never authorized the game. Calculating tip on top of tax is simply wrong and greedy.
Larenee H.,"Hayward, CA",23,10,,1.0,6/13/2016,"Came in for lunch today and had to wait 30 mins to be seated . For some reason this place is always low on staff. How do you expect to keep ppl waiting on their lunch hour . I can see if the place was pack , but it wasn't. Manager need to hire and manage their staff to show up on time . We ended up leave to got eat somewhere else. It's peak hour , it's stupid for them to not seat everyone when the place is not even packed."
Destiny L.,"Hayward, CA",95,8,5,1.0,3/13/2016,"We had the worst service here tonight. The waitress (Elizabeth) was very rude and inattentive, our food was cold and soggy and they were out of alot of things and the substitutes that we ordered were never brought to the table. To make up for that she offered us a desert so we ordered the caramel pretzel bites..but she served us old hard little pretzels coveted in cinnamon sugar and maple syrup with a dipping sauce of WARMED UP BLEU CHEESE. This isn't a joke, we thought it was too, but we all tasted it and it was disgusting. I am never coming back to this location."
Francis C.,"Hayward, CA",19,8,11,4.0,11/14/2014,"It's Friday night and my girlfriend and I were too lazy to make dinner.  We defaulted on going to our local Applebee's.  General manager promptly greeted us and one of her host sat us down. Raymond was our waiter for the night.  Since my girlfriend just got her braces, I ordered her some French onion soup and some soft mash potatoes on the side while I ordered myself some Mushroom burger.  Once we got our food, I immediately realize that she can't have the French onion soup because there's some stuff in that she can't really chew on it. Raymond was kind enough to take it off of our tab.  Even though it's hard for them to come back to your table because they're busy we didn't really wait that long."
Zsa Zsa G.,"Hayward, CA",95,68,69,5.0,5/12/2016,Michael or Micheal or Mickey or Mikey is the #1 MVP BEST AMF I ever had and yeah highly recommend him as a bartender other than that yeah. 5 star for Michael or Michael or Mickey or Mikey haha thanks for cheering me up. Yay
Kanetha J.,"Sacramento, CA",19,2,,1.0,8/16/2016,The worst serves ever if I could give 0 stars I would...they under cooked my order and brought it back burnt over all they need to do better
Lorelei B.,"Hayward, CA",12,19,37,1.0,6/26/2014,"Horrible service i must say. Waitress had a fake smile, she didn't write down our orders (i guess she tries to remember our orders by her head), and didn't realize that their hostess got us our drinks instead.  Our food was dry and cold. We had no utensils or extra napkins when food came;  waitress didn't ask if i needed any steak sauce since i ordered a steak; waitress didn't check to see if we needed refills for our drinks; and she always walked by us with a muggy look on her face.  Now, because we were sitting next to where they enter the bill and take payments, i can see that all these waiters and waitresses only care about how much tip that the customers are giving. Then they would say something negative about them when they gave less than expected....Well, HELLO!!! Wake up! Maybe if you give a better service with a smile on your face showing that you actually care, maybe these customers would give you more tips!    Guess what? I DIDN'T GIVE YOU ANY because you were HORRIBLE! I should have been the waitress to serve for my own family instead. Im 100% sure that i will do a much better job than most of their waiters and waitresses there. THIS PLACE SUCKS! I Am Never Coming Back Here Ever Again!  It's so unprofessional."
Luke B.,"San Ramon, CA",68,3,,1.0,8/1/2016,"Took 45 minutes to get a sandwich I didn't order.  Service was absolutely terrible, even for an Applebee's.  If don't want to waste an hour and a half waiting for crappy food, don't eat here. Would give 0 stars if possible."
Ernest S.,"San Diego, CA",3,51,16,1.0,7/2/2016,"Let's see... dirty sticky table, dirty sticky menus... seat has a big tear. Lots of small children. Chain restaurant at it's worst. Wait staff attentive and quick."
Nallhieli M.,"Hayward, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/28/2016,Terrible terrible service. I came here a few months back and the boneless wings were so salty I couldn't eat them. I decided to give them another chance and came back again. It was a bad decision. We waited for more than 20 minutes before someone noticed we were waiting to have our orders taken. We didn't know who our server was since they never introduced themselves. There were 3 other parties than came in after us and we're already eating. This has been the worst experience I've had at a restaurant. The service at this Applebee's at Southland Dr. has been atrocious. I will not be dining here again and I do not recommend this place to anyone who does not like waiting almost 30 minutes to have their orders taken.
David K.,"Hayward, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/28/2016,Extremely Poor and Slow Service. Food wasn't properly prepared. It appeared as if the entire staff just didn't care.
