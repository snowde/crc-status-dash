Nancy R.,"Hayward, CA",11,9,6,1.0,12/14/2015,"this was one of the worst experiences in my life. Everything really sucked! My hubby and I went to have a nice Friday night out and we decided to come here. The Sangria drink that I ordered was nasty and was missing flavor.  Once our food was given. I was totally disappointed. Nothing in the stuff we ordered was good, nothing. I mean how can someone mess up steamed broccoli? Are you kidding me? Anyways I ordered the steak with mashed potatoes and broccoli. It all sucked! My hubby's food was also terrible. Overcooked baby racks! Now the worst part comes. our bad server came by to drop off the bill. We decided to pay at the mini tables that are on the tables. I paid my balance and it was time to leave. As we are approaching my car in the parking lot, my server screamed at us in front of the other people yelling that I had not paid my bill!!!! How embarrassing! How can someone yell that out with out FIRST verifying if the bill was paid or not.  I went back in and showed her that I had paid my bill and she was telling me that I had paid for the wrong order. She was forcing me to pay for an order that wasn't mine! I was really upset! This server was not doing her job correctly and made the restaurant look even worse!!!! For sure I made it very clear that I had paid my bill, showed it to her and walked out! I will not be back again in the nasty/unpleasant place ever! To my fellow yelpers watch out for this place!"
Rachel H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",291,84,116,1.0,6/21/2015,"AWFUL SERVICE. Food was okay, but took forever. The only good thing about this place was the friendly people at the tables on either side of us. Other than that, this place was really not worth the visit.  We were seated and it took a while for our waitress to ask for our drinks. When she did, we were ready to order, but she left too quick for us to tell her. Then when we did order, we waited about 45 minutes and they forgot someone's order at our table, so she got it when everyone else had finished their own.  Not once were we asked how we were doing or even if we wanted refills on our drinks (I asked for my own refill). I tried to let them redeem themselves because they said free mozzarella sticks if they don't suggest a gift card to us. I asked and apparently, it's only after we get the check and the waiter I asked suggested it. This place is built upon lies."
Lei M.,"Alameda, CA",156,23,12,1.0,4/19/2015,"EVERYONE NEVER GO TO APPLE BEES IN HAYWARD by SOUTHLAND!  They made us wait 30mins til we finally had a server. (It wasn't even busy) Our drinks were not cold. And we waited an hour til we finally got our food!! They never asked us if we needed anything so my boyfriend had to go back and forth to get us napkins, bread, bbq sauce..  You complain about you needing to get tipped but u do a shitty job?  The FOOD WAS HORRIBLE! No flavor and it tasted like it had been sitting for a whole day. The macaroni wasn't even cooked all the way it was kinda crunchy on the ends..  Ugh. Wasted my money!!!"
Crystal D.,"San Francisco, CA",15,20,15,2.0,8/18/2015,"Slow,  customer service was slow, food was slow. I ordered appetizers of the boneless chicken and the 4 cheese Mac and cheese with the chicken tenders. Mac and cheese only has one type of cheese, and it was cold. My babes good came out hot and fresh and sooo good. He had the sirloin 7 Oz steak, mashed potatoes and veggies. I ate his veggies and half of his steak. The hunger. Only thing left to do now is take it home and remix this Mac and cheese. I'm disappointed"
Joe C.,"Belvedere Tiburon, CA",0,49,13,1.0,3/26/2016,O hell no. Service here is a joke. Food came out straight cold. Not lukewarm... Cold. I told them I dont feel like paying 20 bucks for cold food. I was treated like I was in the wrong for sending the food back. This part of hayward tends to bring with it a ghetto attitude. I wont be back for anymore cold food or over priced beverages.
Dee R.,"Hayward, CA",150,27,6,3.0,3/13/2016,Bad experience with the to go order I placed tonight. Sending my husband to pick up the order was my first mistake but that doesn't excuse the restaurant from messing everything up. I got the bourbon chicken and shrimp and said no mushrooms even on the receipt it says no mushrooms but there was mushrooms on my chicken my sons steak was missing the fries wasn't well done it was medium rare. People check your to go orders before you leave. Food was good that's why I gave Applebee's 3 stars.
Jessica N.,"Hayward, CA",0,22,11,1.0,12/3/2015,"Gross!!! I ordered three cheese penne pasta . All I got was dry pasta with tomato and small shreds of cheese . I kid you not there was no sauce. Also it was suppose to come with bread and I didn't get that either. Eat here if you want to be served dry pasta by a sorry chef & terrible management. I use to love their food, but now it's horrible! Fast food is better!"
Kevin Y.,"San Lorenzo, CA",8,3,3,1.0,5/14/2016,Over cooked two of our medium rare steaks to over well done. Tasted like dry-wood. Food was too small
TRINA W.,"Oakland, CA",127,10,2,1.0,5/9/2015,Grossed out!!! I paid $54.95 to find dirt on my lettuce in the salad I ordered! This is very humiliating! Who knows what else wasn't cleaned that my kids & I ate from this restaurant! I will be contacting the BBB and sending the pictures I took of the dirty lettuce! No ***'s but Im forced to leave one...
Kg M.,"Fremont, CA",2,18,3,1.0,8/1/2015,"Never come here took  1 hour and half to eat drinks suck service sucks, Waiter was undocumented worker hope he didn't spit in food...."
Matt G.,"Hayward, CA",3,29,12,1.0,1/31/2015,"Went in today for a late lunch. There were a good 15 people in the waiting area in front so we asked to just sit at a table in the bar area. They said there was a waiting list for that too, despite half the tables being empty. So we sat directly at the bar because we didn't want to wait.  There was one bartender and three customers, but she was making drinks for the restaurant, so we understood the 5 minute wait before she got to us. Still, she could have looked at us and acknowledged us or something. After 5 minutes she grabbed a couple menus, and without making eye contact or saying hello she gave them to us. Didn't ask us if we wanted anything to drink. Hello, we're sitting at a bar.  A couple minutes after that, without the bartender coming back to us about drinks of food or anything, one of the servers came to the entrance of the service area and ""playfully"" threw a handful of ice at the bartender which bounced all over the bar. So that's why 15 people are waiting for a table?  Maybe two minutes after that we just got up and left. Even if we would have gotten service we didn't want to be there. Honestly, we found it funny more than anything. Never in either of our lives have we seen such bad service. We just chuckled and rolled our eyes and then took our business elsewhere."
Rachelle D.,"San Leandro, CA",18,19,30,1.0,2/20/2015,"ROACHES ROACHES ROACHES!!! First and last time I've been to Apple bees in years because my husband insisted. So we ordered the sampler which took 30 mins to come out. Then finally our entree. My dad ordered the steak which came on a sizzling platter on top of a wooden palette. Needless to say it looked delicious and as we were about to eat big huge roach came out from under his plate! I told a waitress who came by and she said ""yeah that's gross and walked away. Then our server finally showed up we told her that there was a roach and nothing! She handed us the bill and said thanks for coming.  People don't eat here unless you like roaches in and around your food!  Dirty dirty dirty!"
Briana C.,"Palo Alto, CA",2,10,,1.0,3/22/2015,"I'm writing this post during March Madness. I was in the area and wanted to watch the game. I noticed that the establishment had televisions. Once inside, I was shocked to see all the tv's were playing poker- not march madness games.  After asking the manager if he could change he notified me that "" I have along list of things to do so it would be while"". Instead of leaving I sat at the bar and waited. 7 min into my wait nothing had been done. Dirty dishes still remained from the previous people sitting next to us.  15 min in, still no basketball game. The manager disappeared and the bartender kept making excuses on how swamped they were.  After about 20 min I decided this was a waste of time and left. Don't waste your time."
Timothy L.,"Fremont, CA",17,17,1,1.0,6/17/2016,"Food quality here is horrendous. Brought along the whole family expecting a decent dinner, only to be disappointed by terrible service and tiny portions. Despite the restaurant being almost empty on a Thursday night, we waited almost an hour for our food. My daughter's burger was seriously undercooked and had to be sent back twice. Support a locally owned diner instead!"
Jeff T.,"Hayward, CA",2,124,1,1.0,5/28/2016,"Saw commercial for new so called trained meat cutters, figured steaks improved,  boy did I figure wrong.  Wife and I both got couple of flip flops , asked for medium, given well over done.  Asked server to replace, she said it would be 15-20 min wait for replacement steaks, spoke to mgr who offered discount on bill, never again crap a bee's"
Lisa W.,"Hayward, CA",0,19,,4.0,2/10/2016,"Been here twice now and love it. The 2nd time, had a little trouble getting a salad and I think the waitress just forgot so I was a bit irritated as the salad showed up at the same time as my meal but once I started eating, I was less and less irritated. The food was delicious and worth the wait, even the salad was delicious! We will definitely go back again."
Nadia C.,"Hayward, CA",64,8,10,1.0,6/23/2015,This place use to be one of my faves but now I will never go back  Horrible service not once not twice but three visits back to back. And each time my order was wrong AND late. Never again.
SeTavia M.,"Antioch, CA",84,4,,1.0,9/27/2015,The customer service was the worst ever! Karen took my order over the phone when I went I picked up the order I was in a hurry so I didn't check my order before I left. When I got home I noticed my order was incorrect. I called to complain about my concern I didn't receive any sympathy or apology. I'm going to reach out to the district manager about their customer service because it was unacceptable I will never go there to eat early morning lunchtime or late at night! Dear management you need to train your employees about customer service. World-class customer service is the best customer service and unfortunately your employees know nothing about it! PS if it was up to me they would get no stars zero nada!
Susie M.,San Francisco Bay Area,1,3,3,3.0,9/25/2015,$11 for chips with couple shreds of beef. I was ripped off...and no avacado. $11. For chips and lettuce!  The stars are for the wine.  Food was a zero.
Rodney N.,"San Leandro, CA",27,16,2,1.0,3/9/2016,"We went here for lunch on Sunday. There are 6 of us and 3 toddlers. We waited to be seated for over 45 minutes when there are quite a few areas in the restaurant that are empty. They could have easily put some chairs and tables together to accommodate us. But for some reason, they've closed off some sections and told us no one will serve us if we seat on those sections. After 45 mins, I asked how long still do we have to wait and the host said it'll be another 15 min. We left. Everyone especially the kids are very hungry at that point. That will be the last time we'll go to this place. What a horrendous service!"
