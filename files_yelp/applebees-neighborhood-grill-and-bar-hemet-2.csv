Jeremiah E.,"Oceanside, CA",47,11,3,5.0,11/21/2017,Favourite Applebees In town. Bartender was amazing and very outstanding. Will come back soon. The food was good. Very satisfying.
Stephanie R.,"Chino, CA",222,10,1,5.0,1/9/2018,I've had multiple good experiences here with Kelly. She makes it so nice for my grandma & I. We came back for her especially! She deserves recognition. Food is good at this location too.
Roberta W.,"Menifee, CA",19,12,10,5.0,9/1/2017,"I can't imagine why people don't give this place 5 stars, heck I give Applebee's 100 stars. I always sit at the bar and get special attention and I always come here since Chili's stopped serving my drink Pina Coladas. Applebee's makes the creamiest icyist coldest drink in town. They always have new specials like the on top of series. I got a high tender moist porkchop covered in Cajun shrimp to die for. I was able to keep it light with garlicky bacon green beans. Marty enjoyed the 6 oz sirloin with grilled veggies and garlic mashed potatoes. And the servers Wendy me Velma were so on top of things we ended up with 2 sets of silverware, lol."
Theresa S.,"Perris, CA",57,27,11,5.0,10/26/2017,Great service Shannon was amazing . Had the steak and baked potato and I have to say I couldn't finish it. My daughter had the ribs and mashed potatoes. The food was great. I will be back
Nicole U.,"Murrieta, CA",0,6,2,1.0,8/30/2017,"I have been to this restaurant three times and, each time, there wasn't a host to greet us and we ended up having to wait ten minutes or more to be seated (there wasn't even anyone ahead of us to wait behind!). The servers are not very friendly (almost as if there's tension in the air) and you can tell that they just want you in and out."
Gab R.,"San Jacinto, CA",0,14,,1.0,7/26/2017,"Went here with my husband and kids, the waitress attending us was extremely rude and not friendly so I asked for another waitress.  Lady it's not my fault you were having a bad day. The food was ok but the customer service is blah. Won't come again."
Cathy R.,"Murrieta, CA",41,10,1,1.0,5/28/2017,If I could give this particular store zero stars I would. We came in for dinner and we usually use the ordering system at the table. We got a 2 for $$ and when the food came out they didn't not bring our appetizer or other entree! When we informed our server Samantha she gave us attitude and said we only put an entree for our 2for$$.! To me that makes no sense because a 2for $$ comes with an appetizer and 2 entrees. Why would we order a 2for$$ and only order one entree.. Samantha handled the situation very poorly practically blaming us for the mistake saying we placed the order with out ordering the appetizer and second entree..the manager was no help at all either basically siding with the server.
Tommy S.,"San Jacinto, CA",1,102,59,5.0,12/23/2016,Was very pleased with the 2 for $25 deal ! Servers Kelli and Cheyenne took great care of us !! Definitely recommended and will be back again!
Azubike K.,"San Jacinto, CA",0,6,3,3.0,10/20/2016,Had a gift card so decided to eat here. Ordered to go. Stood inside for about 10 min waiting for the employee to complete my transaction and give me my food. He was very busy and obviously backed up on orders but he was attentative to me and the others. My food was hot and the order was correct. Was not very satisfied with the food. I got the 8oz sirloin with veggies and baked potato. I could have made a better meal myself at home honestly. No seasoning on anything on my plate. I literally got 5 veggies. 3 were tomatoes.  Who df roasts tomatoes. The only reason I gave 2 stars was for Jeff. Very nice employee but I will not be eating at applebees anytime soon.
Col. Dickie K.,"San Jacinto, CA",2,24,2,3.0,7/2/2017,Went to this place for the first time. Food is decent however service was a little slow. We had a late 10pm dinner on a Friday night.  Will try again to see if it's gets any better
Mona G.,"Hemet, CA",6,34,34,2.0,3/7/2017,"Closes at 12am, we came in at 11:15. I understand we came in late. They made us sit in the bar area. There were 2 other tables that were there so we ordered anyway. The waiter said the kitchen is going to close in 5 minutes so we had to hurry and order. I thought that was rude. We felt rushed. He hardly came by our table but was talking up a storm with the table next to us. They ran out of sauce for the mac&cheese chicken meal. I was already upset by how we were treated so I just didn't want anything. Then I ended up getting it with no sauce on the chicken. Took awhile to serve my husband his beer. He did offer more cheese for my mac&cheese because it looked dry. He always spoke really fast which was another reason we felt rushed. Food was good. Service was not."
John S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",169,5,2,5.0,6/1/2017,Great food. Fast service. Thank you Wendy for putting a smile on my face with world class service. lunch specials are solid
F V.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",8,171,131,4.0,7/21/2016,"I came here today for lunch. I've only been to an Applebee's one other time in my life. I ordered the ""Grilled Onion Sirloin With Stout Gravy"" off of the ""Lighter Fare"" menu, and it was pretty good. Meat was cooked perfect and the meal as a whole flavorful. The sirloin was a tad chewy in some areas, but it wasn't awful. This is Applebee's after all.  The one thing that made my experience great was my waitress, Wendy. Definitely one of the sweetest waitresses I've ever come across, and I've come across many. Very good service. In fact, I noticed all of the waitresses and waiters were very attentive, always checking on all of the other tables to see if everything was ok and if anybody needed anything."
Blair H.,"Hemet, CA",2,135,385,1.0,7/29/2017,"I've only been to an Applebee's in Temecula maybe 12 yrs ago which was an ok experience for lunch with a friend. Then came the second event which was Mother's Day at the hemet applebees which was more like a Mother's Day meal from hell. Went with my mom and dad and teen. Waited over an hour for our table. The only good thing was the waitress who was fast and friendly. Everything else from the food presentation, portion size, flavors was the worst dining experience in recent memory for all of us. None of us ate our food and to include my father into that is pretty shocking. He cut one bite of his tiny minuscule overcooked piece of meat trying to pass for succulent steak, and put his fork down. The veggies weren't even worth it, absolutely nothing was. So we just asked for the check without eating. When the waitress saw the uneaten plates and asked if we wanted boxes she was shocked when I said we would not bring that nasty excuse for a meal with us. She got the supervisor who came over and tried to find out the problem. I listened and in very short but polite terms explained that it was the worst meal and the worst restaurant we had ever been to. He kept trying to utilize his customer service and pacifying 101, (useless on me since my education is clinical psychology and global MBA, I've studied human behavior and business relations for close to a decade) however I very calmly again explained that there was nothing he could do. We were not happy and our Mother's Day was already ruined after waiting over an hour for a horrible flavorless kid menu sized meal. I plainly told him to save his efforts because while I appreciated him trying to do his job I wasn't interested in any resolution. I didn't want a discount I didn't want a coupon, we would never ever ever set foot in an Applebee's again. After 10 minutes he gave up since I wasn't budging. I thanked him for being nice paid our Full bill, tipped the waitress 35% since it wasn't her fault and we ran as fast as we could out of there. Came straight home and made seafood and couscous and Greek feta salad and enjoyed our Mother's Day at home away from the tasteless pit that is Applebee's in hemet"
Eva F.,"Hemet, CA",0,9,1,3.0,3/27/2017,"We usually won't go to these ""cookie cutter "" restaurants. They are notorious for bad attitude, and poor food. I talked my husband into giving this Applebee's a second chance. The employees were friendly and helpful. The food was actually very good. Maybe we caught them on a good day. I had the 6 ounce sirloin with shrimp. It was perfect.  We may even give them a 3rd try."
Jayne M.,"Hemet, CA",54,2,,5.0,3/26/2017,Kirsten the server was very friendly amd made my dining in experience  wonderful i love the siracha shrimp and wonton tacos thank again Kirsten your the best
Dakota G.,"Anaheim, CA",11,66,68,5.0,11/23/2016,"The service was unbelievably good! Kelli, you were amazing! The food was hot and fresh. Everyone was very friendly. The fries are some of the best I have had and the boneless wings were perfect and crispy. Thanks for a great experience, Kelli."
B A.,"Hemet, CA",13,27,5,3.0,2/4/2017,"The fam and I ate here because we had a giftcard, not usually a place we would go normally we prefer less chain like food places.However we had a good attentive waiter food wasn't bad for chain restraunt and is better then what I remember appplebees used to be years ago"
Jasmine B.,"Hemet, CA",29,3,3,1.0,9/17/2016,"I dont like how the waiter David G. Was dismissive after our order was paid. I intended on ordering another drink. If im still in the establishment i expect some kind of recognition, or at least how am i doing every now n then. I received not a glance from this waiter."
Dan R.,"Hemet, CA",0,11,2,3.0,12/21/2016,"Well the experience here tonight was not the best! I've been coming here for years and tonight was a 1 star kinda night. I can't believe it's a ""sports"" bar but they had transformers playing and the manager wouldn't change it to sports! The reason I gave it a 3 stars is that the bartender some what saved the night. She made it tolerable while transformers was on at a ""Bar"" . Next time I'll call in advance to see if they are having movie night!!!! So I can pass !!!!!"
Tina C.,"Hemet, CA",91,3,,1.0,9/10/2016,Basically after ordering we get told they don't have a flavored tea. Then the waiter doesn't tell us until after the order was out in that they are out of the steak my husband ordered 12oz sirloin. So suggested to make 2 6 oz steaks. The. The manager comes to our table and is very rude and tells us that it would be an extra $10.00 charge to do Two 6 oz steaks. Tells us the they just sold out right when we walked in. So you would think they would inform their staff that they are out of items. But I guess not. This is not the first time we have had a manager that was very rude at this particular location.
Gonzalo G.,"Hemet, CA",0,9,1,5.0,5/31/2017,"Everything tonight was perfect, the beer pretzels and the boneless Asian spicy wings were an excellent choice for appetizers. We ordered the whiskey bacon burgers and chicken tenders and I washed my delicious meal down with my favorite ballast point Sculpin beer. Our server Velma was on point delivering top service, thank you."
Esperanza M.,"Hemet, CA",43,71,11,3.0,2/27/2016,"The food was great but the service was not. We had to wait to be seated about 15 mins. We were seated got drinks and ordered,after that went downhill. Some lady in a purple top brought our appetizer, she failed to give us any napkins. Our drinks were empty the waitress seemed like she disappeared for about 10 mins. Then came and filled our drinks they brought our food which was good,she didn't check on us for another 10 mins...geez c'mon I'm starting to hate going to restaurants they have such horrible service these days!!!! Good service here is hit n miss I've been here a few times 2 out of 3 have been bad service."
Sandra G.,"San Jacinto, CA",71,3,,1.0,12/7/2016,"A month ago at Applebee's in Hemet, our waiter (David G.) He was discriminative towards my family and I (we being latino). Is no the firts time he do that to us he server us before and always is the same history so i decided to do this review ... was a white family in the booth next to us. He was polite and giving good service , but when it came to us he would wait a long time to get our drinks and bring a orders to us. David's attitude was always in a rush, when we were ordering our food he would tell us that they resturant didn't have this or that item yet the white family had order a few of the same items after us.  this waiter wouldn't even bring me a high chair for my nephew saying there is no room for it. Also my son ask for refill he say no to him  i'm sorry but the restaurants floor plan was already laid out for them to be used. we had a talk with his manager about his service and seen the manager talking to him about it and david just laugh it off. Being in the service industry myself I have never acted like that in all my time working because I know that my tips depend on the great service I give. I never do that but I didn't leave any tip to him I leave 20 dlls tip to the hoostes he was really nice with us! I'll not go back if that waiter is there! Horrible service.. I had other waiters there nice but that night he was the only one on the floor !"
Shawna H.,"Chino Hills, CA",45,14,15,1.0,7/1/2016,"I would give this place a zero if i could. This is absolutely the worst Applebee's I have ever been to. Save yourself the hassle and go to chilis  up the street. Our server was near non existent. We asked 2 other servers for water refills because our server disappeared doing her sidework, they themselves went back to the host stand and we're standing around without   refilling the waters. My son asked for a spoon and it took her 10 minutes. By the time she brought it is food was ice cold. I ordered a beer pub burger with veggie patty. The patty was burnt and the burger was missing everything it was to come with. My husband ordered the chicken mac n cheese dish. It had hardly any sauce and 1 chicken strip thing.  My father in law ordered the bourbon chicken and shrimp combo.  Theu chicken was dry and rubbery, inedible. We will never come back here again."
heather s.,"Cathedral City, CA",168,36,55,5.0,7/7/2016,Want to for lunch and had the best experience. Food was great and got it quickly. Our servers name was Kori. She was fabulous. Drinks were always full and she had a smile on the whole time. We Heard the table behind us complimenting her as well. We will definalty be back. Our new lunch time spot.
Tim G.,"Hemet, CA",4,7,,3.0,6/22/2016,"New wood fired steaks are amazing but sides of ""fresh"" vegetables are LOADED with salt and garlic seasoning and their strawberry lemonade was way over sweetened, and took 3 trips to get to our table , would probably return if these things were fixed , but till then I'll put them on the back burner from where I had them before this trip."
Beth D.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",23,28,6,1.0,6/11/2016,Disgusting!!!! Service was bad ~ the food was bad. Even the table next to us was unhappy with service and food. The funny part is there was a total of 9 managers and servers combined and maybe 5 tables to serve. Don't waste your hard earned money here.
Maria B.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,84,33,1.0,7/15/2015,"First time at this location and the LAST! I went for lunch with a friend today we were grossed out by 4 things.  1- The spoon that was given to me for my soup had leftover chocolate cake/brownie residue on it  2- There was a hair in my sandwich 3- The edge of the table where I was sitting (the part you lean against when you eat), literally had about 10 or more long hairs hanging on it, plus the backside of the seat where your back touches, was full of hair as well.  4- The top of the table where your food is placed didn't look like it was thoroughly wiped after the previous people who ate at that table.  If you don't care about the cleanliness of a restaurant, go ahead, eat there. But if you're like me and want to enjoy a meal that you're not worrying about the proper handling of, stay away from here!!! I can't believe this place has not been shut down!"
Ashley H.,"Hemet, CA",0,27,,5.0,2/27/2017,"Well I can say this Applebees is so much better then the one in Beaumont. Love to go to applebee. Spur of the moment, don't matter always have seating. Pretty fast at getting your food to you. Never had a meal I didn't like. The people are all friendly. Good place to go, even if your on a budget. Love to 2 for $20"
Jessica R.,"Hemet, CA",0,11,5,5.0,7/18/2016,"My family and I had dinner here a few weeks ago , we were happy with the service. We only waited to be seated about 10 min on a Friday night. Not bad. Our food was good too. My husband and I has a couple of margaritas and they were good too. I like the new kids menus they have as well"
Randall B.,"Hemet, CA",23,12,,1.0,7/19/2016,"I used to love this restaurant...we had a party of 6. 4 of us had cold food. I had the Salmon but it was old over cooked and dry. My grilled veggies consisted of red bell peppers and zucchini. I don't normally complain but I have to this time. My wife's potatoe was under cooked. The service was great. Normally we're the kind of people that just suck it up, and don't say anything, but every restaurant in Hemet is churning out terrible food. POLLY' S is the last quality food place in Hemet...and no, I don't have any financial interest in POLLY'S, just stating the facts."
Robert R.,"Sun City, CA",37,231,2,2.0,5/7/2016,"Service is so slow, not the place to come if you're going to eat before going to the movie theater. I mean it's Applebees, not Morton's. The food or the service is mediocre at best. Was a mistake choosing here before going to the movie. We missed our showing... Who'd have thought an hour and a half wasn't long enough. And no, they weren't that busy."
David M.,"Hemet, CA",70,49,134,1.0,8/20/2016,"The host,( young black man), was awseome. He was very courteous.  There was a Few empty tables in the bar area. I asked Velma (our server), if the tables were available,  she replied ""there's stuff still on the table, so, no"". The host cleaned off a table for us while Velma was preoccupied with a table with only one gentlemen sitting there.  We asked about happy hour, she gave us menus and walked away.  We eventually ordered drinks from the kiosk. The bar tender sat our drinks down without any straws. I asked the host for straws, he was very accommodating. Velma with our appetizers.  She made us feel as though we were bothering her. Her personality wasn't pleasant at all. We paid using the kiosk, I tipped the host, as well,because I felt he went above and beyond. Maybe it was a busy time and Velma was covering the entire bar section on her own. The food was phenomenal! I'll go back for the food, as long as I don't get the same server."
Elizabeth P.,"Hemet, CA",16,1,,1.0,2/28/2016,Let me start off by saying the guy who sat us didn't even look like he had showered in a few days he didn't smile or anything. The girl who served us was alright and the appetizers were edible.. But when our food came it wasn't hot like it was supposed to be the rice tasted like it had been sitting there and heated up a number of times... My friend got food poisoning from her sandwich and is in pain today. The best part of the whole meal which is sad was the alcoholic drinks.  I am not satisfied when I go out and spend 58 dollars on dinner I expect to be happy with it. We all threw our money out the window unless you want a stomach ache don't go here. Never coming back
Tim M.,"Atlanta, GA",0,7,1,5.0,1/19/2016,Kylie is the best bartender/server ever. She will not guide you wrong with ordering food or drinks. She rocks and she is pretty easy on the eyes. Chilies I mean Applebee's!  Lol
Nay H.,"Perris, CA",0,42,6,4.0,3/26/2016,We had absolutely no service problems.   David was our server and he was the bomb. Will request him every time I come here.    Our food was good too.
Nick P.,"Menifee, CA",5,108,37,4.0,12/30/2014,"So, I'm writing this review about their ""Carside To-Go"" service. I have REALLY enjoyed my experience with ""Carside To-Go"".  Not only are they super efficient and friendly, but they've ALWAYS got our order right, and it's always hot and ready to go on time - which is really important for a service like this.  If you finish it too early, then it cools off by the time you get there and then it's lukewarm (at best) by the time you get home.  Because of this, this location gets my recommendation for their ""Carside To-Go"". As far as the food, it's always been great.  Only eaten inside once, and the food was great, but the service was mediocre and slow. Pricing is a bit rough, though.  Times are still tough, guys."
Dee D.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,10,,1.0,5/7/2016,"My mother & I ate at this restaurant on May 3, 2016, and the food was burned! My mother ordered well done steak/shrimp, & I ordered a full rack of ribs. The ribs were whole (i.e., they did not cut the rack of ribs in half). Also, as soon as I turned the ribs over they were completely burned! With this in mind, I called the waitress over and explained the situation she then called the manager. The manager, who was an older gentlemen apologized and offered to replace the ribs, which I accepted. Meanwhile, my mother turned her steak over and discovered it was burned, too! At this point, we were fed up and ready to leave. The manager came over again, and offered to replace the meal free of charge for everything including beverages. But we decided to leave and we will never ever return!"
Ronald R.,"Hemet, CA",34,15,1,1.0,5/5/2016,"Terrible service! We won't be going back ever! The food was ok, but the server was very lacking on manners and attentiveness."
