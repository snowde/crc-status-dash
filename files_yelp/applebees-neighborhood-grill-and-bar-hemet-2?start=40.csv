Troy S.,"Hemet, CA",14,25,58,4.0,1/2/2015,"We're here tonight to redeem our gift card. It's very busy tonight,  well it is Friday after all. Can't wait to eat."
Laura M.,"Casa Grande, AZ",0,13,,5.0,9/9/2016,Jason and Velma are amazing bartenders. We spent a few hours In there just laughing and joking and completely enjoying watching them work and interact with their customers. They have great attitudes and good camaraderie with patrons! Great experience.
Lee S.,"Orange, CA",0,31,8,3.0,7/25/2016,"I spent $60 for two (including tip). If you ask me if it was worth my money, I'd say NO! I've tasted better for that price and had better service. Not saying the food was that horrid, but not the quality I expected for that price."
Gabriel A.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,3,,2.0,3/11/2016,"Food was pretty good, tried some new items personally along with my brother and sisters. Our meals came out at different times. Waiter was slow on refills but tended to others and passed my table countless times my brother pointed out while i was talking and trying appetizers. I would say the attentiveness needs to be stepped up, along with as a customer do not shine me on with a fake smile saying you apologize for any delay then leave the empty dishes.."
Rick H.,"Corona, CA",78,52,17,1.0,7/19/2014,"Bad all the way around. The chips were glowing in grease, and I'm not exaggerating. Service was below average, not as horrible as the food. There is always a 50/50 shot this Applebee's will get your order wrong, and today I was the lucky loser and my order was wrong."
Richard G.,"Hemet, CA",50,6,15,4.0,12/20/2015,"So my girl and I ordered 2 steaks off the 2 for $25 menu. Hers was well done and mine medium well. They where both very juicey and flavorful. I loved my steak especially because it was very juicey and full of flavor, I also did not need any steak sauce at all. Our compliments to the chief. Only down side was that I got fries instead of my coleslaw as ordered, but that was quickly corrected. Overall, a very good meal. Thx David for making it a pleasant meal."
Claudia F.,"Knoxville, TN",0,10,,1.0,2/18/2016,"I have always loved the menu at APPLEBEES until we ate there the other evening. They have been market testing a table device for ordering and paying for your food. It may be a great toy, but what the plan is to totally replace the wait staff with this device. More jobs out the door by a corporate entity. When I go out to eat, it is for the experience as well as the food. I am already sick of scripted press button phone calls, no bank tellers, self checkout at the grocery and now we will have the same thing at a restaurant. Impersonal service. I will forget going out to Applebees Restaurant unless I get takeout."
Thomas G.,"Hemet, CA",0,32,4,4.0,8/14/2016,"Interesting start, 20 plus open tables and we are told we will have a five minute wait. We were at a table in four minutes. Shannon was a great waitress! We had the 2 for 20 with the burger. A great burger indeed."
Peter And Lauren C.,"Hemet, CA",8,52,4,2.0,2/11/2016,"We eat there often, as it's close to us, and usually decent. Tonight, I ordered a steak, and my husband ordered a bourbon chicken. His dinner was ok. Not great, but O.K. I had to send my steak back, as it was rubbery, and had NO flavor. I hate rubbery steak. The baked potato was good, and should have just kept it, and stopped there. But, the waitress was quite apologetic, and handled it like a pro. I asked for a small burger instead, which she brought 15 minutes after my husband had finished his dinner. The hamburger wasn't even very good. Actually, it was a sub par sad little burger with wilted lettuce, and a tiny end of a tomato for garnish. Patty was dry and just nothing special.  Nothing special at all. In and Out makes a waaaay better burger. I ate 3 of the fries, we paid, and left. Mind you, I LOVE FRIES, and NEVER LEAVE THEM ON THE PLATE.  I will say that our waitress was outstanding, very responsive, and apologetic. Not her fault. We still tipped her well, of course.  Probably won't go back anytime soon, if at all. It seems that drive thru in this town is about it.  We've decided lunch is the meal they do best. Soup and sandwich were delish."
Seraphim F.,"San Jacinto, CA",89,48,34,2.0,6/3/2014,First I was not greeted at the door for over five minutes ... David was our original server he was a Lil spacey and rude   he made me wait  five minutes and then delivered the wrong soda   he assured me I was wrong.... Really my taste buds. Work just fine ... He then passed  us to another server a woman  Wendy who was nice and on point the sampler came it was bland  when dinner arrived the fries were cold the  steak was chewy   the appetizers  were cold and the cheese on the  artichoke dip was cold and hard.  My steak. Had. Great flavor it was just very chewy. Now I know why people call this craplebees two stars but only cause Wendy was nice
Franklyn A.,"Silver Spring, PA",1,17,,2.0,7/31/2016,"When the loudest person in the place is the bartender - there is a problem.  When the manager greets people at the front door while picking his teeth - there is a problem. When 50+ year old couple are drunk at the bar and fondling each other - there is a problem. When the menus are gritty, the table is sticky - there is a problem.  Couldn't bring myself to check out the bathrooms.  Pleasant staff, decent food, no wow factor AND COULD SOMEONE TELL THE BARTENDER TO SHUT UP FOR 30 SECONDS!!!!!"
Scherry B.,"Hemet, CA",20,259,40,2.0,6/20/2015,"I only like two things from here otherwise I would not come here. One being the wonton tacos, very good !!! The other is the mudslide , the mudslide is very very very good best mudslide that you can get at any chain restaurant! Service is ok and the rest of the food sucks plus it seems as though the prices are high for this kind of place. I mean 70 bucks for two at Applebee's ??? I rather pay 100 bucks at a real restaurant !!"
Jill H.,"Hemet, CA",5,6,,4.0,9/12/2015,Our service was excellent.  The four-cheese mac & cheese was delicious.  Plus lemon drop martini was terrific!
Steve D.,"Hemet, CA",1,24,,4.0,9/9/2015,We visit Applebee's at least 3 times a month to take advantage of new offerings and their Happy Hour Menu - best in town. Food is always good and consistent and the staff are very helpful. This is our go to spot.
Sovi S.,"San Jacinto, CA",1,12,2,1.0,5/8/2016,"WE WAITED IN line for over 40 minutes today to celebrate mother's day. After the long wait, not only did they sit us right next to the bar, on pub tables, with my underage child, and my old parents who couldn't even get on the chairs... But going even beyond that, we were extremely disappointed at the quality and portions of food. we had to send our entrees back, because not only were the steaks half the size of our palm, for ""LARGE HOUSE SIRLOIN"" (YEAH, RIGHT) but they came with half scoop of mashed potatoes, 2 broccoli florets, 2 baby carrots, and 3 squash slices. The salmon was a skinny strip of something the size of a polish hot dog. Immediately we returned it without even tasting it. In all of our years of dinging out, we have never seen  fish stick size salmon served at a restaurant for $15, and tiny tiny tiny  steaks for $18 Needles to say, our mother's day was ruined, 3 hours of our lives wasted, and the worst dining experience of our lives. We will never ever go back to an applebees restaurant, in any city or state, and we will make sure to share our terrible experience with all our friends and family, so we can spare them a most disappointing experience. The only positive was that the service of our waitress, ANGIE G , was very fast and friendly. But since fast and friendly service doesn't fill your stomach, we left hungry and came home to have a BBQ instead"
Jenifer K.,"Hemet, CA",53,157,,1.0,2/21/2015,"I am not normally a fan of Applebee's.....I've never been too impressed with their food.  BUT, they recently held a fundraiser for my son's AFJROTC and it was phenomenal!  They aren't typically open for breakfast, but for us they served an all-you-can-eat pancake breakfast with eggs and sausage that was fantastic.  For that event, I give 5 stars....as for their normal fare, I am just not a fan."
Diana O.,"San Diego, CA",56,18,62,1.0,12/21/2014,"Absolute worse place to eat! It took them 5 minutes to get us a table but once we were seated, nobody came up to us to take our orders. About 10 minutes later, a waitress took our drink orders but it took another 10 minutes just to get our drinks and take our food order. To make things worse, nobody came back for another half hour and finally somebody asked how we were doing so we told them we were still waiting on our appetizers. By then I was about ready to walk out and go to another restaurant. Never coming back and highly recommending everyone else not to."
Zeek W.,"Riverside, CA",11,259,841,4.0,8/18/2011,"I never go inside this place because it's always way too crowded, but I'm a fan of the curbside pickup.  It's quick, easy, and a great way to get a good meal that is not ""fast food.""  You just call 951-791-2506 and place your order.  Then pull up to the marked parking spots and within a few minutes, the packaged food is delivered to you car.   If you use this service, don't be a cheapskate!  The curbside server has to package up all your food and lug it out to your car.  He or she deserves a reasonable tip!"
Diamond W.,"San Jacinto, CA",0,13,1,3.0,4/22/2016,Went here and we order a margarita the perfect margarita the glass was sticky wet and the look of it was horrible it looked nothing like the picture salt all over the whole cup it was really bad we asked the waitress to change the cup thinking we would get our drinks back with a better presentation but that did not change anything she brought it back the same way I wouldn't have even thought she changed the cup . As of out food it was good besides when they gave us our wings they only have us 1.5 pieces of celery .    Prices not bad.  Margarita was good but just super sloppy and presentation is supposed to be everything .
Tony S.,"Beaumont, CA",174,328,23,5.0,10/26/2015,"service was fast for lunch , food was hot and fresh, waitress was attentive and kept our drinks full"
