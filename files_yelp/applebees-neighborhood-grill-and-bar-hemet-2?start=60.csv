Tommy W.,"Hemet, CA",12,35,22,5.0,3/14/2014,I have to say we had a really nice time here tonight.  The server Quona was perfect from the start.  The appetizers tasted great and the entree came hot and delightful. I had tequila avocado shrimp chicken the wife had fish and chips and my son had his fav. Chicken strips.   We always had a full beverage.  Thank you for the great SERVICE then great food.
Diana P.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",31,33,,4.0,4/8/2015,"This is The best Applebee's I've Been to...The Service is usually Great & the Price of Food Reasonable...The Staff- welcomes and remembers you as a Regular when I was living/working in Hemet. They are open late so it's great since just about everything else in town shuts down by 9pm. They also had a 10 pm Happy Hour & Mix up their menu so I've been happily surprised to try their new foods & drinks. But have comfort in the regular menu.  Some People have put me down for liking this place,but it is still One of Favorite Chain Food Restaurants'..."
Aileena W.,"Upland, CA",60,7,2,1.0,11/20/2015,"Horrible service. Wasnt greeted, took so long to get drinks. They were just standing around talking. My food came out wrong. I dont know what is going on but I couldnt take it and there was no manager. I walked out. Horrible horrible. I will never go back. Chilis was so much better"
Megan J.,"Temecula, CA",243,512,139,4.0,9/8/2013,"So, I took the advice from my fellow yelper friend Liz O and sat at the bar and it was great! The bartenders were totally on top of it. We came on a Friday night and sat at the bar. We wanted to watch the Dodger game and we didn't know it but preseason football just started. UGH. So, we were thinking we probably won't be able to see the game since football overrules everything and we were going to leave once we finished eating. My hubby asked the bartender if they could put the Dodger game on and they said yeah not a problem! It just won't have sound and we didn't care about that. Yay! 1 star for just that. Drinks were made pretty good. And they always made sure we were good. For the food, I ordered the wedge salad and steak (special going on at the time) and it was delish! I wasn't expecting the best thing I've ever had and it surprised me by how tasty it was. Especially for Applebees. Bar is a little small so when football season starts and post season baseball is starting, I would probably watch baseball on any other day but Sunday or Monday or go somewhere else.  Great location right off Florida and close to the mall. They have a nice outdoor seating spot with misters! All in all, a pretty good place to go but only go in the bar for a decent experience."
Cynthia W.,"Hemet, CA",12,4,3,2.0,2/7/2015,"So I went to applebees last night with the family, was looking forward to their new shrimp and broccoli cavataplia? (Probably spelled it wrong sorry). Well anyway, when the food arrived it looked nothing like the picture on the menu, the broccoli was one side and the pasta and shrimp was on the other side,   and on top of that the food was lukewarm not hot, I told my bf let's exchange it or tell the waitress Denise but he said never mind eat what you can,, cause our was going to start in 20 minutes, so we can go, we said we are never coming back here again he said his steak was cold also. Very sad"
Kikin F.,"Hemet, CA",87,8,,1.0,12/29/2014,"Every time I come here, I leave disappointed. The service and food quality has gone down in the last few years. This used to be my favorite restaurant and that has changed because of the bad service. When I pay $17 for a steak, I want it to taste good and not be dry and flavorless. The only good thing is the bar"
Anthony P.,"Temecula, CA",80,90,159,4.0,9/30/2014,Food was good! Service was Great!  Our server was attentive to our needs and made sure our food was brought to us hot! I will mention her name in my next review as soon as I find my receipt lol!
Vicente A.,"Murrieta, CA",58,16,,5.0,10/8/2012,"Excellent Customer service by Quona I was surprised that this place is busy on a sunday night but as always Applebees is very good, i have yet to find a bad applebees restaurant. The service was excellent. Our server was QUONA S. shes a great server and very smart too. She took our orders without writing any of them down and i was surprised that she got everything because we were very specific on our food.  Steak is very good its soft and juicy and the quality is better than BJ's and sizzler."
Liz O.,"Seattle, WA",678,808,67,3.0,9/16/2010,"If you go here, my recommendation is to sit in the bar area. Better atmosphere, better service. I'm sure most people know this restaurant is a chain, so the food is decent but nothing outstanding.  I've ordered everything from the burgers, to the pasta, to the appetizers and desserts.  Nothing stands out.  But none of the meals have ever made me sick either."
Debi G.,"Santee, CA",0,12,,3.0,6/15/2014,"I was up in Hemet again for the second time in two weeks to visit my aunt who was now in hospice. I was starving and was planning on leaving to drive back to San Diego when one of my cousins mentioned he was ready for dinner too. I decided to stay and suggested some other places, but was outvoted and had to come here for dinner. I have been to other locations of Applebee's in San Diego and Riverside counties and was never thrilled with the menu, it was kind of meh. There wasn't much on this menu I liked, but the server was great and had a sense of humor. I think we all needed that since it had been such a depressing day. I did remember how good their fiesta lime chicken dish was the last time I had it. This time, it was an unusually big piece of chicken breast. The presentation was very nice and everything on the plate was good. I loved the lime flavor and the meal was pretty filling. I especially like the tortilla pieces in two different colors. They were crisp even with some of the sauce touching them. I liked the rice. It would have been nice to have beans too, but the breast was so big, I was full without them. The server was great in explaining some of the dishes and making suggestions. He even talked one of my cousins into the shrimp dish by telling him the number of shrimp he would get. My cousin was surprised since other restaurants don't give you that many shrimp in a main dish.  I would come back here again but it wouldn't be my first choice. The area here is not the greatest. We came here after 6pm on a Tuesday night and saw police activity twice on our way down Florida. It's too bad. I can remember Hemet when it was a boring, quiet little town in the 70s and 80s."
Mrhemet F.,"San Jacinto, CA",1,11,4,1.0,12/6/2013,"We'll I took my girlfriend here to have a nice dinner and was anything but nice. First the service was bad along with atmosphere heard are waitress cursing to a manager. Secondly we were brought are main dishes before even receiving the appetizer. When asked about it , I was told it was sent to another table. Waited 20 minutes just to take are drink order and it was slow after receiving my drink we wait 20minutes before my girlfriends drink was brought. Over all just very disappointed won't be coming back and I'll be tell friends and family to no longer go there that's how bad the service was"
Elton J.,"San Diego, CA",10,187,1,5.0,8/21/2014,"Applebee's is pretty consistent regarding their food.  I usually have no issues with the food or the quality of the food.  There does, however, seem to be a problem with getting a good server at Applebee's (not with this particular location tho').  Prior experience told me that my visit today would TASTE good but the service would probably stink, like it does at the Murietta location...and was I WRONG!  Christina took care of my guest and me today and we were both very impressed with the attention she gave us but at the same time didn't smother us with.  I don't normally tip as much as I did today for a $25 lunch but Christina was that good.  I WILL BE BACK HERE!  I come to Hemet once a month or so and you won't be able to keep me away!  Thanks again Christina :)  You're a great server!"
Lynn H.,"Hemet, CA",16,9,11,2.0,2/6/2014,"The food was good, the service friendly, and our server was attentive and pleasant. Beverages were refilled and everything was brought at the best temperature. However, there was an advertisement on the table stating a free dessert on your next visit if the server doesn't mention gift cards available for purchase. Our server neglected to ask, so we mentioned the offer. The server immediately brought us a coupon for the free dessert, but I was disturbed to learn that by my asking for the coupon the server will be ""docked"" a day of work on the restaurant's work schedule.  PUNISHMENT for neglecting to push the gift card? SHAMEFUL! Applebee's should try positive reinforcement to their employees, not punishment. SHAME ON YOU APPLEBEE'S. :( Lynn H."
Andrew Y.,"Hemet, CA",0,4,17,5.0,9/7/2015,"Yummy O. Great place for a late lunch and a cold drink. The place was clean, the waiter was real nice. The Location is in a great area. Would I come here again??? For sure and I'll bring a few friends."
Angela D.,"Hemet, CA",83,1025,5,2.0,9/5/2013,"Gross! Can't believe I just dropped $75 at this place. Food was nasty, service was whack, the whole experience was so sick, never again."
Rita C.,"Hemet, CA",4,2,,1.0,8/2/2015,"If there was a zero option I would chose it. Went to this place for dinner with my daughter and grandson and the services was awful. I'm using awful as a polite choice of wording. First when we arrive the hostess says she will be with us and then we get ignored by the male hostess and her until another couple comes in and the male hostess almost seats them before us. Right before he seats them he looks at us only because my daughter is starring at him like what the hell dude. At that point the female hostess comes up and states she has a booth in the bar ready and my daughter tells her she does not want to take her 11month old son to the bar, and I mention no one wants to see a baby in the bar. Oh and she has the nerve to give my daughter attitude when she says no to taking her son into the bar to sit. WE then tell her there are plenty of open booths to sit at and the hostess then make up some excuse as to why we cannot be seated in there.  We finally get seated and our server comes and takes our drink order. My daughter got her lemonade beverage before my draft beer (which I wait over 20 mins for). Then he comes and takes our order. Now we arrived at 9pm and we left at 10pm. By 9:43 pm we asked a different employee where our food was. By the way I ordered a salad and my daughter got two appetizers. The people on either side of us got their meals while we were still waiting for our simple orders. When our waiter walked by he noticed us sitting there with no food and then asked us if there was something wrong. Well of course there was!!!! He then proceeds to ask us what we ordered again. So I thought that in order to be a good waiter you should remember what our tables ordered right. Well this man sucked at it. We told him that we wanted a manager, and ten minutes later she shows up. We try to tell her what happened and all she did was cut us off and says yeah I know I heard. Im putting a rush on your food.  At this point my daughter says lets leave. So we get up and walk out before getting our orders. I had a feeling that those meals were not going to be safe to eat. Oh and no one even noticed that we got up and left. We even walked right passed our waiter too.  After returning home we emailed their cooperate office and the email never even went thru. Never eating at Applebee's ever again."
Miguel M.,"Fontana, CA",0,20,7,3.0,4/12/2014,"It was not a great experience, the server Christian was not very attentive and got the order wrong, even after bringing It to his attention.  He was somewhat rude at times.  The drinks were watered down, the food was a little cold, and I can't believe I spent my evening there.   Next time is rather go somewhere else, anywhere but there.   If you have a choice go to chilis down the street"
Frank A.,"Beaumont, CA",0,9,3,3.0,4/27/2014,"Really bad at giving you an accurate curbside order, so check your bag. Food menu doesn't match online. Otherwise the food is cooked just about the same as ever other Applebee's though."
Chelsee J.,"Hemet, CA",121,56,15,2.0,2/4/2014,I've been here many times and always seem to be disappointed in something. The food is okay but there over priced for such little amount of Food. The service is okay as well but you do get attitude from some of the staff when asking simple questions. I don't really want to keep trying this place.
Brian A.,"Hemet, CA",1,45,,4.0,6/19/2012,"It's alright, nothing special.   It's basically a Chili's with a different name.  They do have good hot wings though and good desserts.  Service has always been good.  I added an extra star for the wings and the desserts."
