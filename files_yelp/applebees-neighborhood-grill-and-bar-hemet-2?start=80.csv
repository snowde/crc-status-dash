Mary C.,"Indio, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/1/2015,"1st time here at Applebees in hemet, ca...our server is not fit to be a server our food took 45min to get our food...horrible service never again will I come here."
Robert L.,"San Gabriel, CA",72,268,502,3.0,11/11/2014,review of Applebee's in Hemit California four stars once again a great meal for My dad the vet . It's not my cup tea but I do like the movie hall pass they do make reference to Applebee's in it so I'm here and I'm with my dad who's enjoy the free double crunch dinner because he's a veteran services good little slow but overall very attentive a nice.
Armando V.,"Seattle, WA",0,30,2,4.0,9/8/2013,"Went in for lunch and a few drinks,  the bar tender was extremely friendly and attentive to our needs the food was great, just as  I imagined it to be.. Definitely recommend this place to others."
Charli B.,"Loveland, CO",100,17,6,4.0,9/19/2011,"One of our choices when going to have lunch with dad.  The Applebees in Oceansid doesn't hold a candle to this one.  It is clean, fast service and good food.  I have never had to send anything back and have had excellent service. We did the 2 for $20 this time and not disappointed."
Kurtis L.,"Hemet, CA",0,13,,2.0,2/15/2015,"First time here and the food was nothing to write home about, my little girl got the pizza bread kids meal.  She took one bite of it and wouldn't eat anymore.  I tried it and it was nasty like your eating a raw rotten garlic.  Beer was a little flat and not vary cold.  Service was par nothing special.  Chili's down the street blows this place away."
Keith M.,"Hemet, CA",0,5,,4.0,1/29/2014,Just ate at applebees the service was outstanding and the food was perfect would definately recommend to all my family and friends
Aaron H.,"Hemet, CA",12,44,432,4.0,3/31/2013,"This place is a nice hang out spot for some cheap food. But as someone mentioned you do get what you pay for. Recently its been pretty good, even when dealing with all of the graduation parties that show up, I've still gotten good service. The Happy Hour is nice, in that it runs from 9 to close. The actual menu however in my opinion is a bit over priced for what you get. The drinks aren't have bad either, Tiffany and Manny do a good job. There are a few odd ball servers, especially Cari. If you have her, I hope you can take a joke. She can be.. ""overly"" friendly."
Chris M.,"Hemet, CA",41,214,31,3.0,2/8/2013,"The food seems to have gotten better over the year.  It as gone from inedible to ""eh."""
Stephanie C.,"Hemet, CA",19,39,5,5.0,6/7/2010,"So I am basically writing this review of the customer service...The food is good, exactly what you would expect of Applebees. The honey mustard is GOOD... So I have done, the TO GO three times and have had the greatest service, do not have the two diff ppl who helped me's names wish I did..maybe I can find out and add them...But one is a tall, young, blonde white guy..so respectful and helpful..Customer service doesn't come like that anymore. The other is a young, blonde, white girl, I think her name starts with a ""T' she is so friendly, and accurate, I tipped her to low this last time, and I feel guilty, she deserved better. Next time I go, I will over tip to compensate."
Ky O.,"Hemet, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/15/2013,"Went here for dinner with my family. Service was horrible!! Seems the staff was more interested in standing around talking to each other rather than paying attention to the customers. Our waitress was very unprofessional! And the food was horrible. For our appetizer we had the chips with spinach and artichoke dip, and the chips were SOAKED in grease. My three cheese chicken penne was very bland and I was unable to find any cheese on it. My family and I will not be returning."
Stephanie A.,"Perris, CA",1,15,,1.0,6/4/2014,"I had a chicken dinner that was on special that day. Holy mother of ..... It was horrid. It was one of those things where you take a bite then let it fall quickly out of your mouth. Experiencing emotions raging from Surprise, Disgust and Horror.  My son said you're being picky. Then he took a bite and his face was hysterical. While spitting repeatedly into a napkin he called the waitress over. She apologized and the manager came over and took my plate to the back.  The manager came back and said she was so sorry that was terrible and made the chef prepare a new plate (guess she tasted the other chicken breast we hadn't touched on the plate) but when the new order came it was just as bad.  Still I paid for it, boxed up the dinner and took it home, I was going to freeze it and send it off to the FDA to have it analyzed because I don't know what that was but it didn't taste like chicken. It was a cross between some type of waxed display food and pressed .......something. Got on the FDA website and it was too much of a hassle but I wish I had instead of tossing it in the trash. I really would like to know exactly what that was. What is odd is that my son had a chicken sandwich which he said was great. But we both agreed whatever was on my plate was. 1. not edible 2. not chicken"
Doggy I.,"Hemet, CA",1,105,11,1.0,6/10/2013,"Mannn! Bad service to start, rude waitresses and above all manager walks by me on my way to the table and rudely yells excuse me and sighs loudley as he goes around me. I can let all that go but what I'm writing here about is the ""Cowboy Burger"" that made me very sick to my stomach. I should've known when the burger tasted tough and the meat was off tasting. I haven't been that sick in a while. Just because of that I have to grade this low."
Kate H.,"Hemet, CA",0,6,,2.0,6/16/2014,"Too tired to go out - we worked all day moving stuff so, we called in for take out - the 2 for $20.00 - I ordered the 7 oz steak and sister ordered the chicken penne pasta. The steak was IMO not restaurant grade - the flavor was excellent and the medium rare was exactly what I wanted - pink through-out.  The garlic potatoes - a lump of clay and the veggies were over cooked in water.  Now for the bad review - sister said if she wanted something this dry she would have ordered toast.  No sauce at all and the pasta was gummy.  No, I would not recommend take out - at least sitting down we could have spoken with the server and maybe experienced better food."
Fat Panda X.,"New York, NY",433,99,2,2.0,3/1/2013,"ehhh.... the waiters are all trying to push the talapia on you, makes you wonder if they bought too much of it. food is so so.. beer tastes watered down."
Reanna R.,"Palm Springs, CA",34,188,81,2.0,9/21/2010,"It is your typical applebee's.  Nothing special.  Nothing more nothing less.  I'd rather go to Chili's down the street.  The food is your average food that you could make at home, but your too lazy to.  The only good thing is they have the 2 for 1 deal usually."
Ruben O.,"Hemet, CA",28,16,2,3.0,3/10/2011,This place was ok. The lime chicken was really good and it was a decent portion. I got the 2 for twenty. The riblet basket seemed small. It was good but could have been a bigger portion.
Felicia P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",43,7,,5.0,1/29/2014,Cliff the manager and Kylie were awesome. Great please to be late  great people clean good food
Eric F.,"San Jacinto, CA",0,14,,4.0,12/26/2014,come here maybe 5x a year.  never had a problem with speed or order being wrong.  in line with other Applebee's I've been to.
Gina B.,"Knoxville, TN",16,25,4,1.0,8/15/2010,"Really, 5 star reviews for Applebees?! If we don't demand better we'll continue to get these crappy chain restaurants in this crappy city! The food is processed, super salty, and leaves you feeling bloated and remorseful. The service is okay but everything else is typical, corporate, over-processed crap. Save your money."
