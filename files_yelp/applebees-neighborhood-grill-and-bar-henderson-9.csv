Dennis M.,"Atlanta, GA",41,88,82,5.0,11/15/2014,"Exceptional Applebee's: They are open until midnight everyday! Service is outstanding, especially if you sit at the bar and Savannah is the bartender! Ordered the 9 Oz sirlion (medium), broccoli and mashed potatos.  Steak was perfect!  Broccoli was cold (really no fault of the kitchen because broccoli disapates heat faster than any food on the plantet.  Mashed potatoes were better than any other Applebee's I have been to.  Larger portion (possibly because I am eating so late) and large chucks of potatoes in them. Combine all this with a very good Bourbon and diet coke to make this a great ending to a long day! Plenty of TV's to catch up on a days worth of college football scores!   The only downside.......it is snowing outside. :(  Being from Atlanta I really do not need to see this, but work mandates that I see customers even if it snows there. The great customer service from Savannah makes up for the dismal weather.  If you are in the area, and your stopping at Applebee's,  try to be here when she is working! Decided for myriad of reasons to skip desert this evening. Have to get up too early in the morning :)"
Jeff A.,"Henderson, KY",4,2,1,1.0,5/6/2017,"I ordered the Butcher's Choice 12 Oz sirloin (well done) with mashed potatoes and garlicky green beans to go.I received a steak that was pink in the middle and received steamed broccoli instead of the green beans. I guess they figured since they are just one of a couple of places in town where you can get a steak doing it right does not matter.So much for decent dining choices in Henderson,Ky."
Tammy G.,"Woodbridge, VA",10,1,,1.0,1/7/2017,My Husband and I went on a lunch date. We were the only 2 in the whole restaurant the only 2.. Our waitress her service was good little over bearing.  About every other bite of salad she was standing there asking is everything still with our mouths full I mean we couldn't answer of course and then I'm guessing he was the manager walked up Food good again with mouths full. And that wasn't even the not so good part. Now mind U we r on a day date it's rare we ever get out to eat due to my medical issues. But we were not able to have a simple conversation due to the Blonde ponytailed short girl behind the bar yelling as loud as she could without screaming about how hot and good looking she is and how it takes a line of washer at the laundry mat for her to do her clothes. No one could talk but did try to talk over her. And the man bun wearing man yelling back at her ( You know I'm right here You know I can still here U). At this point 2 others had come in and been seated. Our food arrived Double Crunchy Shrimp more like Cook to a Crisp dried out broke my tooth shrimp. Now with only 4 customers in the Whole Big Restaurant 2 more arrived and with the no one on the other side oof the restaurant They seated them almost right on top of us. So at this point if we would have wanted to talk there would have been no chance because of not only them speaking the waitress waiting on them and again us the blonde and Bun man were still very loud.  We were not Pleased Nor will we ever EAT OR RECOMMEND anyone to EAT there...  Waist of 30.00 and 1date lost...
Angela S.,"Chicago, IL",254,242,2,2.0,10/2/2016,"We were visiting from Chicago and Detroit so maybe it's just a cultural difference not being from ""the South."" Service was so slow at this place. Lemon for our iced teas didn't come until we were almost finished with our first glasses. A party of 4 and one entree came out solo that wasn't even what we ordered. It took at least 5 minutes for a server to figure this out and come back to retrieve it. This was a mac-n-cheese w/ crispy chicken and bacon dish. When it eventually arrived the bacon was maple flavored and cheese non-existent. Cold noodles w/ pancake syrup and frozen chicken bits is what they should've called it. The other 3 of us had grilled items. Nothing more disappointing than waiting for a hot, grilled, juicy steak and instead getting a cold, dry piece of gray meat. The broccoli and baked potato weren't even warm enough to melt the butter."
mary r.,"Naperville, IL",0,7,,4.0,4/11/2015,"We were driving through and stopped at Applebee's.  Brandi, the bartender, was great.  She was so nice, informative and genuinely happy with working for Applebee's.   She is the type of employee every employer wishes for. And more importantly, she is the type of person that will bring customers back!  Great people person.  We had dinner later, and the meal was good.  Our waitress was busy but very attentive and friendly."
Megan B.,"Henderson, KY",3,15,45,4.0,4/14/2013,"Usually their service is horrible, but I went in the afternoon, around 1, and we actually had a good waitress. Food still took a while to arrive, but I guess if your gonna go to Applebee's, go during lunch and avoid the horrible service."
Chris A.,"Louisville, KY",11,10,2,5.0,9/5/2013,"Let me tell you... My son had a baseball tournament here and we ate here in between games. This was the best Applebee's I have ever been to, and I've been all over this country. I almost want to make the 2 hour drive from Louisville just to eat here. This is what it should be!"
Jayne C.,"Forest Grove, OR",10,80,,2.0,1/20/2012,"Ready for along wait for your food? Because that's what you are in for at this Applebee's. It was my grandmother's 96th birthday - yes, the restaurant staff was aware of the nature of our occasion - and we waited for more than an hour for our food. When we complained, we were told, ""Sorry, but we're really rushed. Everyone came in at the same time for lunch."" I looked around the restaurant and it was half empty. Other tables got their food before us. One of our party had to leave without eating. The restaurant took his meal off our bill, without our asking, and that was nice. But cold, late food? No, that's unacceptable. When I shared this experience with others in Henderson, I was always told the same thing, ""Oh, yes, we had that experience too and that's why we don't go there."""
Joshua C.,"Henderson, KY",80,16,,4.0,3/26/2013,I have always enjoyed my experiences here.  This is where my family and I eat when they come in from out of town.  Always have friendly staff and quick service.
