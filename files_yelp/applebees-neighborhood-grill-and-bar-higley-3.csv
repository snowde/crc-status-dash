Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",67,382,737,3.0,12/12/2017,"It's been some time since we've been to an Applebee's. Decided to go-as they'd sent me a Birthday Special. A BOGO deal. Came in Saturday evening 12/ 9 and sat at the bar. Andrew was our server & bartender. Very pleasant & accommodating. I'm going to give this place the benefit of the doubt after seeing many of the negative reviews. I think some are honest and a few others not so much!  I can say we had issues with utensil cleanliness. Prior to our meal we had to asked for another set of forks. Wings came out not as requested, kitchen error and it was resolved in a very professional manner. Those were tasty! Double Crunch, never a bad thing when it comes to crispy chicken & sauce! Ordered the Sirloin Steaks (Butchers Reserve). *Keep in mind for later * that again it's suppose to be the ""Buy one, get one : of equal or lesser value FREE""! Steak Meals were $18.99 each. We ordered 1 medium and the other medium rare. Medium rare my husband felt was over cooked. However, it was a 12 oz ""uneven"" butcher cut, so the thicker piece was medium rare and thinner piece was medium well. My cut was more balanced and cook perfectly. Can order two sides. Both of us had the garlic green beans which are good. I had the baked potato and was asked if I wanted it loaded. ""Sure""! It's $2.99 additional for adding bacon & green onion. When it arrived it had 3 very small pieces of bacon and no green onion? *See Pic* I requested a side of both: since I was paying for it! That request was met with no complaints. My husband had the garlic mashed potatoes & they were good. Both meals we just ok. My son came in a little later with his girlfriend, so we added the sampler platter to our bill that they shared. $13.99 Drinks were pricey $8.50 for vodka tonics (grey goose) NOT a double! LOL Beers weren't at Happy Hour Price even with getting there at just before 6PM. The bartender made reference to that when he served us our first set of drinks. At the end of service when we presented the coupon, the bartender took off the sampler platter? They didn't read their own fine print nor honor the coupon the way it was supposed to be offered. I told my husband it should have been one of our steak meals comp'ed?! He wasn't going to bring it up after the charge had gone through. We still paid over $100!  Applebee's has really deteriorated over the years. From management to staff it just is average in my opinion. A fast food chain that use to be very successful , but over the years has declined. I don't think we will be back anytime soon to dine."
Andy M.,"Mesa, AZ",0,3,,1.0,11/25/2017,"Started off with filthy plates for our apps Ordered the brunch burger  Soggy oily disgusting burger  Patty fell apart before I even had a chance to take a bite  My lady had the Chinese chicken salad  Lettuce was soggy , chicken was over cooked  We should have noticed that the place empty at 2pm on a Saturday  It was a reminder why you should never just go to eat someplace because it's close to where you are shopping  Never again  Overall food was poop  Service was a 5"
Reese B.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,7,,1.0,10/2/2017,"APPLEBEE'S HAS RATS!!! I was trying to enjoy a celebratory dinner with my Son, grand kids & my ex-wife bit couldn't even do that! my order was wrong! I SPECIFICALLY asked for no onions on my bourbon steak & the waitress kept arguing back n' forth with me that I didnt! & thats when I went to dig in to my Cobb Salad & found a WHOLE RAT in my salad! Feces & everything! No wonder the damn Ninja Turtles couldn't find Master Splinter..  Stay far away from this or any Applebee's as they certainly aren't up to food standards"
Gordy T.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,67,,2.0,1/2/2018,Previous 4 star review has changed. Went in for the 2 for 20 lunch which we always get. The normal burger is least expensive burger on menu. The new menu has upgraded to a more expensive burger. We wanted the less expensive burger. Waiter said no way. What. How dumb
Kemlyn B.,"Glendale, AZ",411,510,1840,2.0,8/19/2017,"Poor customer service and food presentation lacking in attention to details. Our family headed to Applebee's near the Mesa Gateway Airport. We always love the Wonton Tacos which drew us here.  It started out well enough. Casey, our server was pleasant and service was customary then. We ordered one entree and 5 appetizers. My daughters split the macaroni and cheese with bacon and honey chicken. They enjoyed it.  Two of our three Wonton Tacos were not finished well. They usually  top the slaw on the tacos. Two of the tacos did not have slaw in it. Another problem with detail was the spinach artichoke dip. The kitchen had left a fairly large woody piece of artichoke in the dip. When Casey came to check on us, she asked, ""How's everything?"" When I asked that she provide feedback to the chef that the tacos were not dressed correctly and there was a large chunk of woody artichoke in my dip. She scoffed at me and rolled her eyes dismissively. ""Okay."" she said and walked off.  Training. I know that she was probably trained by management to ask customers how everything was going, but if servers are not interested in feedback then should at least pretend to be pleasant. Also, if you don't want feedback, don't ask the servers to ask customers how things are going. We left the restaurant disappointed with the service. I don't think we will be returning."
Teri D.,"Powell, OH",113,702,50,3.0,4/29/2017,"After a day out hiking in the mountains I was pooped and wanted to just get something fast and reasonably priced to eat and then crash.  Came here as it was close to our hotel, sat in the bar and had the speediest and most charming server ever.  The dude was killing it handling the bar and the high tops around it.  We both had a non-alcoholic drink and those fixed price special meals.  For the two of us it came to $29 and that ain't bad.   Andrew M was our server and I salute him for his skills in handling his business."
Brea G.,"San Francisco, CA",53,1,,1.0,11/25/2017,The absolute WORST! Food is absolutely horrible.  They brought used(filthy) app plates to the table!!!! Soggy salad.  Greasy burger.  Ugly people.  TV playing football so loud x 10 you couldn't hear yourself think.
Lauren B.,"Gilbert, AZ",67,66,30,3.0,7/5/2017,"I've been to some pretty ghetto, hood-like places in my day and I am not proud of this but never in my life have I ever been served such stale tortilla chips like my Lord. I realize that it's Applebee's and it's 1. Redneck City and 2. Not in any type of tortilla chip business but really? I almost lost teeth.  But my entree was good and my server was friendly."
Oscar A.,"Gilbert, AZ",46,17,,1.0,6/25/2017,"Careless management staff, un responsible bartender. My fiance and I are regulars until today. We were sitting at bar and witnessed a intoxicated female patron with her 2 toddler daughters get over served. I spoke up to management if they were going to do their job and stop serving her and or make sure that she would not get behind the wheel with her 2 kids and they did not seem to care instead they kept serving her. I was told my manager on Duty Maranda that ""she was a regular and that she was good"". A responsible bar manager would not continue to serve a patron that was intoxicated especially with 2 children. Shame on you Applebee's I thought you guys promoted a family atmosphere, I will never step foot in your establishment again after seeing your careless actions today thank god the local PD got involved and took issues in their own hands."
Leslie O.,"Tempe, AZ",15,7,,1.0,6/25/2017,"Shame on this location for serving a clearly intoxicated lady with 2 small children alcohol. When brought up to management that she was in no condition to keep drinking they blew it off saying she was a ""regular"" there and that she is still ok because she always comes in there with her kids. I will never come back to this location after witnessing this."
Robert J.,"Las Vegas, NV",186,101,143,3.0,5/25/2016,"Nice place it was the only place open late, but I wasn't too found of the food. I had the 2 for $20: Chips w/spinach artichoke dip and grilled chicken wonton tacos. The tacos wasn't too bad actually."
Brooke S.,"Murrieta, CA",9,6,,1.0,6/23/2017,Applebees is the only place that can mess up a burger. All around not a good restaurant. Do yourself a favor and don't come here!!!
Alejandro A.,"Tempe, AZ",2,11,11,2.0,4/11/2017,"""Who wants to go to Applebee's by themselves?"" Haha, I wish I had suffered alone and not had my poor Dad insist on paying for 9 people at the table. This is, in all my years of visiting Applebee's across the Valley, the worst location when it comes to food. It's a small location, but the staff is great at handling large and small parties like pros. I have a problem with the portions and the cooks from Hell there. Nothing ever comes out 100% right or 50% appetizing. The burgers my girlfriend and I ordered were only half edible. Meat tasted like 2 day old Jack-in-the-Box. Yes... Just poor quality. The chicken usually comes out as soft as a shoe and the ratio in the pasta bowls of noodle to meat is just laughable. Drinks are good."
Ryan K.,"Omaha, NE",3,8,1,2.0,7/19/2017,"Stale chips and bartender kept turning up the R&B music louder and louder. We dined from 9:30-10:30pm, by 10:30 my wife and I could barely hear each other talking."
Calvin L.,"Glendale, AZ",0,16,,1.0,7/7/2017,"I ate here late evening on April 20th and had a steak. I ended up getting food poisioning from eating here. My daughter was born on April 22nd early in the morning and I spent the whole time doing the two affects food poisoning have on you in the delivery room. The nurse ended up having to nurture to my pregnant girlfriend and I at the same time. Unfortunately I was unable to enjoy the true experience, of the birth of my daughter, due to me being sick from a steak I ate here. I can honestly say I would never step foot in this Applebee's or any other after that. In addition to that it was by far not the best ""service"" I've received at a resturant."
Lauren C.,"Mesa, AZ",53,10,,5.0,5/27/2017,Have been craving fish and chips for a while so i had that with a mango lemonade and it hit the spot :) our server paul was super nice but i feel bad for giving him a tip in coins but i gave him 5 dollars in quarters (im a waitress too so that was my collective tips) overal yummy place
Jann Salutz P.,"Newport, OR",48,16,,5.0,2/23/2017,"Andrew and Lola! Give those two people a huge raise! Service. Personality. Friendly. I try to come here every time I am in Phoenix. I am sad if we cannot work in a trip to see them. And yes, the food is great, too."
Daryl O.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,19,3,1.0,12/3/2016,When you say medium rare you expect a little pink. I think shoe leather would have been easier to chew than the piece of meat I got.  The service took forever so the steak was probably cooking for the full 45 minutes.  Silverware was filthy as well. Somebody needs to step thing up or they won't last long. Unfortunately I see they've got a lot of 1 star reviews. Wish I'd looked before assuming Applebee's was a safe choice.
Judy R.,"Mesa, AZ",0,4,,1.0,3/4/2017,Worst experience! Also dirty restaurant not one associate cares about their customers ! I will not go here even management doesn't care!
Michelle K.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",14,78,17,1.0,5/26/2016,"I would give my experience ZERO stars. Went in a couple days ago for dinner... Took about 15 minutes for our server to say a word to us..... Took our drink and dinner order..... Ordered steak with a baked potato and green beans.... Also a side house salad no tomato...  Salad comes out WITH tomatoes all over it and no salad dressing...... About 20 minutes later it dinner comes out..... Steak looked great, green beans  looked good and the baked potato....... Was a plain ass potato.... No butter, no sour cream NOTHING..... When server asked if we needed anything else- responding with.. YES butter and sour cream- the look on her face as if I said her face looked like asshole was beyond surprising..... I didn't know asking for what should have already been on the baked potato was  no no."
John L.,"Azusa, CA",17,14,18,1.0,7/3/2016,"Terrible service at the bar rude they always act so busy  with no one at bar at all never once asked me if i wanted a refill so half way threw my dead plate no drink either. Anyway   After starting my dinner never once asked if I was ok or liked it...  Starts off with smallest side salad I have ever seen  Terrible tasteless over cooked bourbon Chicken dish chicjen was dry no flavor, burnt shrimp burnt frozen style potatos Tasteless grilled oinions with canned mushrooms  I have never had such bad food at Apple bees  Only reason I ate it,  I was starving and I never send food back......"
Tracy D.,"Phoenix, AZ",267,22,3,1.0,2/19/2016,"Really bad service. Staff thought it was more appropriate to sit down, relax and tell jokes than to actually pay attention to the guests."
B R.,"Orem, UT",0,8,,2.0,4/27/2017,"Slow service and fair food. Our food, two chicken dishes took well over 30 mins to get to the table. While they are trying to set the mood of a local bar, they fall well short of that goal. The staff seemed to be more concerned about talking with each other than taking care of the customers."
Karen A.,"Gilbert, AZ",7,4,1,1.0,11/13/2016,"This was a terrible experience from beginning g to end. We waited forever for a waitress when there were only three other tables filled. Then we discussed the menu and chose a 2 for $20 plus one free appetizer order. My husband wanted wings first then he ordered the fiesta chicken and I ordered the classic burger with bacon, cheese & pickles.  It took over 30 minutes for her to bring out not our wings, BUT our main courses!  I asked where the wings were and she said we didn't order them!  Took back entrees and 25 more min went by before the wings appeared. Finally she brought out the orders. I didn't have bacon or pickles nor the mayo I specifically ordered. Took 5 more min for these to come. When the bill came, we were charged wrong!!!! Not the 2/20, but by individual prices. She had to redo the bill.  Never go to Applebes on E Ray Road!!!"
Paul B.,"Lake Havasu City, AZ",1,16,1,4.0,2/5/2016,"We had been working all day and decided to go to Applebees cuz it was the closest restaurant candidly. It was a Friday night and we got there around 8PM and had a 10 minute wait for a table. Once Seated we were greeted by our server who was great. He took super care of us all night and never let any of our drinks get too low. For dinner we ordered the Bourbon chicken and Shrimp and the Salmon for the wife, both were actually cooked just perfectly which was actually a surprise as so many chains will overcook chicken and fish but both of our entrees were done perfectly. This place was clean and the service was superb...........just wish were werent watching our calories right now as the desserts looked great going by!!"
Jared H.,"Queen Creek, AZ",0,21,,1.0,7/20/2016,"I brought my family of four to this Apple Bees, we were seated at a dirty booth. Asked the waitress to wipe it down and she did, she was friendly enough too. My wife received filthy silver wear then returned it to the waitress only to get more filthy silver wear covered in dry food. The food was mediocre but the gross silver wear pretty much made us lose our appetite. The waitress apologized for the problem and stated she had advised the manager of this, the manager didn't bother to stop and apologize or anything. We will never return."
Mark O.,"Phoenix, AZ",119,339,88,5.0,5/17/2016,"Everything was very good, love the new menu!  I used to not be a big fan, but I will be back.  Now to get my wife to try Applebee's again..."
Albert M.,"Gilbert, AZ",18,14,1,1.0,7/30/2016,So apparently i got a ice cream and brownie for my night before birthday at applebees and i didnt even get a happy birthday song shout out... wtf... anyways i will not be coming back to the applebees on power and ray... paul was a good waiter bit apparently was intimidated by me for whatever reason and did not do the song. Oh well... i guess i will continue to chilis... thanks applebees...
Brian B.,"Phoenix, AZ",17,26,6,3.0,6/22/2015,I had a gift card to Applebee's so I went for lunch.  Except for being incredibly calorie laden the food was good and prepared in a timely manner.  Service staff was nice and took good care of me. Given the choice I would chose something else but free food is never bad.
Gail B.,"Mesa, AZ",51,24,1,1.0,4/22/2016,What terrible service sat for 10 minutes no water no greeting nothing. Walked out just looked at us and said nothing. Wow.
Erin E.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,14,,3.0,12/31/2016,"Take out food was fine. Hot when it came out. I was there right on time but I sat in my car for 9 minutes past the time ready. No apology, thank you or recognition that it was not ready on time by worker given."
Lori N.,"Gilbert, AZ",16,19,4,1.0,10/17/2015,"Gross! Dirty! Horrible service! We came here because we had a gift card, but will not come back. The food was awful and tasted like it came from a microwave. The service was mediocre. And don't get me started on the women's bathroom. Absolutely less than 1 star."
Moir A.,"Gilbert, AZ",22,28,3,4.0,4/19/2016,Our waitress was great and very helpful. We ordered the cheese burger egg rolls. They very good. We also had the tortilla soup very good also. I found this Applebee's to be clean which is very important to me. My only problem was we wanted to pay in cash and had to seek out our waitress. They have a tablet on every table to pay with a credit card. I guess with these tablets it's the only way to go.
Dana B.,"Gilbert, AZ",410,745,614,4.0,1/9/2015,The 4 stars is for my husband who is a very picky burger guy. He really enjoyed this one. Service was ok. Caesar salad was decent but nothing to write about. We will be back for his new found burger spot.
Cali F.,"Mesa, AZ",444,123,112,3.0,8/8/2016,"My friend and I came here yesterday and got you're 2 for  $25 meal. For our appetizer we got the boneless buffalo wings the hot and spicy which was very good. I orderd one of your citrus drinks that have blackberries, club soda and grey goose very very refreshing. My friend got the house margarita she was not very please tasted horrible she could only take a few sips befor sending the drink back. I also got the mango jalapeno drink I finished it but was a Lil to sweet for my liking. My friend got theb bourbon street chicken witch she really enjoyed. I orderd the butchers meat and potatoes. I was very disappointed it was horrible. The potatoes were so bland had absolutely no flavor, no spices no anything. The meat was way over cooked I could barely even chew it because of how tough it was. I had to around the whole thing and A1 sauce salt and pepper to even make it tastes somewhat okay. I was very disappointed. I come here alot and normaly order the same on tray. I now know not to try new thing here it's either a hit or miss. I was also kinda upsetting that the waitress never even asked us if we'd like their food."
Lindsay H.,"Youngstown, OH",149,222,410,3.0,9/3/2015,"Fresh, tasty takeout experience. I see that many of the poor reviews are service-related. We have never eaten in the restaurant but had decent carryout which we ordered online via their website. However, no host was waiting upon arrival and hubby had to stand and ask around awkwardly to find out where to go for pick up (in the back. Go through side entrance). We live about 10 minutes away and they estimated 15 minutes for the following food to be ready: -2 item app combo: crispy green beans and pretzels with beer cheese and honey mustard -American Standard burger with BBQ fries -4-cheese Mac with honey pepper chicken Everything arrived home hot, fresh and crispy (where applicable). The green beans came without the advertised aioli, so we used ranch from home. They were tasty and did not have as much breading as the Friday's version, in a crispy delish way. The pretzels were ""meh"" but the accompanying beer cheese was awesome.  The burger was good but couldn't taste the bacon, pickles and onion that was minced and mixed/cooked into the patty. We wish that it would have come with lettuce and tomatoes like the other burgers. Ordered well done but was cooked medium.  The Mac and cheese was pretty good and a hearty helping (I have about 1/2 for leftovers). The cheese sauce is nothing unique but I like the use of callentani noodles and the bacon (which I almost asked to omit) was crispy and a welcome change of texture. The chicken sounded a bit lame... ""honey pepper chicken strip?"" I imagined them throwing a chicken strip that had been sitting under a heat lamp on top and calling it a day. The chicken was actually really tasty. Obviously crispy but the sweet/salty combo was great with the creaminess of the pasta. I wish they had they had the option of adding veggies to make it more of a complete, adult dish. We added leftover stir-fried zuchinni, peppers and broccoli and it jazzed it up a bit. The breadstick was pretty old and tasteless and not worth the calories. While it was pretty good, I don't think I would get this again. I will go back to my usual Oriental Chicken Salad or club house grill. Worth a try once, though.  All-in all, it was fresh, well made food. Some of the best carry out we have had in the last year. They offer both car delivery and you going into the carry out area in the back. Just bring cash for a tip for the car service. *edit: we ordered take out again and were there while food was still being prepared. Even so, taco app was soggy and fries were dry, cold and stale. It was clear that they did not time our meal prep properly. Bummer!"
Jamie L.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,63,4,1.0,2/4/2016,"So... as many of you know by now- and I now know about myself- apparently(!) I am masochistic and I love to be abused by mediocre establishments. My husband and I ordered Applebee's to go *gulp*  yet again. Traffic was heavy so we weren't perfectly timed when the stuff came out of the... Oven? Microwave?... er... you get the idea. We get home and the food is cold as all get out. (Some how pizza guys can manage to keep the pies hot... but I digress...). The big problem is we did the '2 for $20' special (you know, the one managers here don't think exist) and my husband's fries were missing. And we don't exactly live a hop, skip, and a jump away. Plus my husband has school to be at in a half an hour. So we call and they put us on the phone with some wretched manager named 'Janie'. And Janie is just aghast apparently that a customer would have the nerve to talk to her... let alone complain! Janie has to get the kitchens side of the story because we all know... the customer is NEVER right and their side of the story should NEVER be heard before the staff! She could barely listen to our side first. Janie is unapologetic, unfriendly, and tries to blame us for this. I guess I missed my second job shift as a cook back there. Or maybe I was supposed to be the car side-to-go guy... Well. She says we can come back... Sorry lady- can't do that unless you want to fill my gas tank and sit in a class for my husband. Then she says she can't void a single item on the receipt. But, my husband asks, she could void the transaction altogether and charge us for what we had minus the burger meal. Ummm... well.... Then she hangs up in my husband's face-- or do those landlines get really bad reception these days? Er. Okay so he has to go to school so I call back within a few minutes and the rude guy who answers the phone already knows we are calling and magically and just as unexpected as  a unicorn parted the sky with glittery rainbows the manager has evaporated and is now in a meeting with 'another manager'. And I am beyond pissed off at this point and tell him that is unacceptable, I need to speak to her, and I will wait. After throwing that curve ball that they totally did not plan for because the hang up was like totally an accident *end sarcasm* he tells me she is just going to void the transaction. And he has attitude galore and is totally unprofessional but considering who his manager is... am I suprised? NO. But I am still yelping about it. ;) So, the point is, from my perspective, they have messed up more than a handful of times over the past year or so and the management clearly has not implemented any changes, they do not apologize still, and they certainly do not try to rectify any wrong doings. I mean, at least TRY to problem solve. Like offer us a replacement meal in the future (and follow through for once), or offer a future desert/appetizer... but because I am NOT interested in freebies- just suck it up and apologize (because you are the manager at a resteraunt- your skin needs to be a little thicker than that) and offer to take off the meal that went wrong (no matter the logistics because we all know it can be done- if there is a will there is a way!!!). I hate to be the one to tell Applebee's staff this... but... us customers are the reason your doors are open and you have a paycheck. If no one comes to your establishment and they tell their friends not to go because you suck... who then tell their friends you are awful... who Yelp about how you deserve a NEGATIVE 3 STAR RATING... eventually doors will start closing, investors will get all upset and go elsewhere, and then another mediocre neighborhood grill will take your place. If you don't want that to happen: change your ways. My advice to Yelpers: Gilbert has some pretty awesome places to eat- please give your money to the places that deserve your time and money- and DO NOT eat here. Whatever excuse you are thinking in your head about why Applebee's is still okay- you are only fooling yourself. This place is leagues below other nearby venues. The end. Now I am going to go feed my cold, tiny, soggy chicken tenders to my dog if you don't mind. Oh wait. She deserves better than that."
Savannah F.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,9,7,1.0,2/28/2016,Was the first people in- just two of us. Another party of two walked in after us. They took them back first. We just thought it was because they didn't see us come in first. Then another party of two walked in and they automatically took them back first. They completely ignored us like we weren't there. We walked out and went to village in instead. They need to train their hosts better!
Jason M.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,47,200,5.0,11/15/2014,I really like the Applebee's lunch specials.  I'm sad that the Applebee's location on Gilbert/202 closed. This Applebee's is just as good. The food is delicious and the servers are great.
A G.,"El Paso, TX",10,32,7,2.0,11/22/2015,"Their menu changed for the worst. Had salmon w artichokes and the portion was small, and for a $15 meal, it wasn't enough. It didn't even come w a salad, so I left starving and went to another restaurant. I probably won't come here anymore."
