Jesse A.,"Mesa, AZ",23,24,6,1.0,8/9/2014,"If your looking for a fun bar, don't go here.... If you picture a bar with good music and everyone laughing then this is not the place to go... We went in ready to have a good time but between the 60's- 80's mix and the sleepy atmosphere we were ready to go have some actual fun... If your 60-80yrs old this is your place, if your young and want fun this is not even an option.... I'm sitting here now and it's Saturday night and 11:00pm and I'm ready to go to sleep in a booth at the bar....."
James F.,"Gilbert, AZ",187,3,,1.0,4/4/2016,"My girlfriend and I came in last Saturday around 1:30ish and it wasn't super busy, pretty steady. We were on our way to go sit in one of the bar booths and we asked the hostess if we could sit there, she said ""no, I just sat this section and the server is getting drinks right now for other tables!"" She then offered a dirty high top to us, so we sat there. The family that came in right behind us got greeted and sat right at the booth we requested before. Annoying. Then as we sat in the high top for 10 minutes with no service or acknowledgement that we were even there. At least 6 people walked by us without saying a word. One waitress walked by multiple times and didn't give any service. She seemed ""in the weeds"". We were not greeted by the bartender as well who also walked by multiple times. We then decided to leave. It sucks cause I like this place, hopefully it was just a fluke!"
Drey J.,"Chandler, AZ",151,26,4,1.0,1/29/2016,"I hate to write this review. It's a 2 star because the food was good! So my husband and I decided to invite friends and eat at this Applebee's. We ordered the 2 for 20 the artichoke dip, fiesta chicken and chicken fingers and I said I would like to add a desert and right away our server responded ""oh that is not part of the deal"" in a rude condescending voice. I replied "" I know, that is fine!"" He then said he would put the desert in later so it would come out last. Which is was totally fine with me.  We get our food and he comes out with a 3 cheese pasta and fiesta chicken. My husband then says I ordered the chicken fingers, the server then argues and looks at his order book and said no sir that is not what you ordered again in a rude condescending voice. He then takes the food and said we will get you the chicken fingers. Which was nice but if he would have got things the first time he wouldn't have had that miscommunication in the first place. The whole time he treated everyone at our table with the least respect I have ever seen a server treat customers, he in no way went out of the way to please or value our business being there. Oh also he never brought out my dessert he had the audacity to ask if we wanted dessert at the end when he was handing out or checks.  So yes I am disappointed I love Applebee's but I don't know what the deal was with this server tonight and I hope we never get him again. I want to say his name was John and he is the one with small Gage's in his ears. So if you get this server beware!"
Shay M.,"Erie, PA",26,25,5,1.0,4/24/2016,"Besides the multiple disappointments (didn't have items that were on the menu, draft system was out of order, only 2 of 3 meals served, employees congregated at the front with their heads buried in their phones), the restaurant employees crossed the line. One employee intentionally knock the silverware basket on the ground; another did nothing. A third picked up the silverware from the ground, put it the basket and back up on the shelf for service. Less than a minute later a couple walked in and the employee that pick the silverware up off the ground reached into the basket and started to walk the couple to the table. Don't worry, I stepped in and stopped the couple from getting the silverware and asked for the manager. Unfortunately, the manager didn't strike me as someone who would actually follow through and take action. AVOID!!!!!!"
Anthony B.,"Provo, UT",74,32,13,4.0,3/7/2015,"I have always had quality service, quality food and full drinks at this Applebee's.  Applebee's is great and has a menu that changes every so often. They have some great low calorie meals that are filling and tasty."
Bob R.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",0,1,,5.0,4/3/2014,"Wonderful service. Tequila chicken and Shrimp was delicious. Wasn't crowded, but was Wednesday night. Right in and seated right away"
Barb J.,"Mesa, AZ",67,10,,1.0,2/24/2015,"I am really disappointed. This was our second time getting to go from this location. It was very disappointing. The mozzarella sticks were not even warm. The bourbon chicken had nearly raw onions instead of caramelized onions, to the point they were not edible. Being that there is an additional charge for the bourbon chicken just raises the frustration. I had a really long day and depended on a $50+ dinner being good and as ordered. I most likely will not return to this location. Way to make a customers experience memorably bad."
Cori B.,"Tucson, AZ",2,305,130,1.0,4/7/2014,"I went to them for the take out option. All I wanted was their steak that comes with garlic mash potatoes and seasonal veggies. I asked for a med-rare, got well done. The mash potatoes had zero garlic taste in them. The seasonal veggies was just broccoli, which is a veggie (singular), they could have at least added squash or carrots. And the broccoli was just steamed, nothing else, no seasoning at all. The staff were nice but they were not at all busy. There is no good reason as to why my food was overcooked and under seasoned."
Thelma C.,"Gilbert, AZ",20,2,,1.0,8/27/2015,Sat for 10 mins before anyone came to ask for drinks. Hostess didn't even ask if we wanted a booth and manager walked by 2 times without even trying to offer to take our drinks order or acknowledge we haven't been served. No wonder no one is ever here. My server girl was attentive however. Hostess and manager was not welcoming at all.
Matt G.,"Brook Park, OH",52,10,,1.0,3/30/2016,I'm staring at my empty beer while hoping my server appears and brings me plates and silverware so I can eat my food that is getting cold
Vera D.,"Queen Creek, AZ",153,72,86,4.0,2/12/2015,"We came on needing to get in & out in 45 min. It's date night!  Sat at the bar, had great service from Joe behind the bar. He took our order & is dedicated to get us out on time for or movie. Suggested Walnut Crest 2012 Merlot the whole bottle for $10, it is a very smooth Merlot, we were quite surprised! We'll come back just to see Joe! Food came quickly & it's delish & quite hot!"
Danielle C.,"Ontario, CA",4,5,2,1.0,4/13/2014,Waitress was nice enough  Food was absolutely horrible  Bacon was barely cooked  Food was served Luke warm at best. Manager came to see if we were doing alright all we asked for was a ranch 10 minutes later no ranch and the waitress finally showed but and she came back with it right away.  Shrimp was underdone  Needless to say we will not be going back ever again.
Kimberly G.,"Seattle, WA",150,238,49,3.0,6/6/2013,"I had not been to an Applebee's in over a year until tonight. My family lives out in Queen Creek and our options around there are very limited. We decided tonight on this Applebee's because it was fairly close and the wait was way to long at the Native New Yorker in Queen Creek.  The food was okay. Not bad but not great. The beer prices are great. The service was good. I had jalapeno lime shrimp with rice which had good flavor. My sister had lemon butter fettuccine alfredo with shrimp which she enjoyed. I had not been to an Applebee's in a long time prior to this because I had some really bad experiences at a location in Chandler over a year ago. It seems as though they have changed the menu quite a bit. There are still some staple items that Applebee's has always had but definitely some added items as well. I would say that Applebee's is trying to do too much with this new menu. They have seafood, sandwiches, pasta, chicken, burgers and more it's too much. They should try to do two or three things really good instead of trying to do too many things mediocre. But alas it is a chain. I would visit this location again. It wasn't bad. I might just stick to beer and apps next time but we'll see..."
Sophie P.,"Longview, TX",7,42,11,5.0,9/29/2014,"We ordered a pretty large order for Curbside To Go. A few items were missing from our order. One, quick, phone call to the Manager and everything was replaced...and some. The manager I gave the initial call to was Bruno. He was very efficient and helpful. When I actually picked up the order the manager on site was Shannon. She is amazing! So friendly and took extra special care of our fixed order. I highly recommend this Applebee's. As a chain they have great food. But, local customer service is what will have us return! Thank you Bruno and Shannon,"
Colby J.,"Gilbert, AZ",4,21,1,2.0,11/7/2013,"This place is definitly going down hill and resembles a bar, it has too many beer posters cluttering the walls The service is bad, don't hold your breath for drink refills. My wife ordered an ice tea and got a water then politely reminded that she also wanted ice tea. She never got the ice tea however they charged us for it and then a manager had to get involved to delete it off the check. The portions are very small so the ""low price"" value goes out the window when a entree salad is the size of a side salad. Many better choices exist in this area for the same price point."
Abby F.,"Mesa, AZ",0,3,2,5.0,6/6/2015,Loved our server Renee! So kind and loving! Made us feel like part of the family! Definitely coming back! Amazing food and great service!
Stephen K.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,14,8,4.0,1/31/2015,"We enjoyed another great lunch today. We had he three cheese chicken penne. We had the chicken appetizers. The service was great , and do was the food."
Wendy W.,"Phoenix, AZ",23,10,9,1.0,12/22/2014,"Would give it a zero if that was an option. Will not ever eat here again. It used to be a great place to eat but new management changed it all. Waited 50 minutes for our order to be taken. Our party of eight was already seated and knew what we wanted but they only took the drink orders. We were told they were out of French fries when requested as part of the kids meal. The steak was brought raw so they took it back, cooked it, and served it on the exact same plate as the raw steak. Took three tries to finally get a steak that wasn't still moving and a clean plate. We were treating the kids to dessert because the kid's meals had incredibly tiny portions but after almost three hours there we went next door to Walmart to get dessert. While there we saw the general manager buying a cartload of generic frozen French fries. Definitely not worth the money or time spent."
Mark K.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,66,6,1.0,3/7/2013,"They made my elderly, mobility challenged mother cry! Non existent service.  Not welcoming at all.  Upon entering the restaurant on Christmas Eve, instead of being greeted, the hostess barked that they were closing soon. and we would need to hurry up ""just so you know.""  When I asked when they closed, I was told in one hour.  Really?!?  One hour and you're turning guests away, especially a party with an elderly couple on Christmas Eve!  SHAME!!!!!! They wouldn't accommodate a basic seating preference for my elderly mother who had trouble walking.  They made her walk to the farthest side of the restaurant!!  Despite that we sat where ordered.  Then we were completely ignored.  Nobody acknowledged us at all.  Servers walked buy several times.  They wouldn't look at us or even take our drink order.  Thank you for ruining a Christmas Eve for my elderly parents.  For hours my mother was talking to family and friends about the experience and was in tears during each conversation saying that she was in complete disbelief that she would be treated so rudely, especially on Christmas Eve. I sent two letters to their corporate office and never received even a form letter response."
Jee A.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,22,62,5.0,8/19/2014,This is one of the best Applebees and have been to and will definitely come back here. The service was great and quick and the food was very delicious . The staff were very friendly .
