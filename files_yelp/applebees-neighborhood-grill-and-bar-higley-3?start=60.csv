Sherrie F.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,2,,4.0,1/8/2015,"Love coming to this Applebee's on Power and Ray because the food is great for a chain restaurant and the staff is always nice.  I recently tried one of their new Under 600 calorie dishes. Let me just say, you have to try the Cedar Lemon Chicken. The chicken was so tender and it came with diced cucumbers and green apples on top with a light lemon sauce. The rice was a blend of white rice, quinoa (not sure I spelled that right) cranberries, and pecans! YUM!!! Think I found my new favorite dish. :)"
Kara R.,"Mesa, AZ",4,23,6,1.0,1/28/2016,"Probably the worst experience I have ever had at at a restaurant and I didn't even get to eat. We walk in, obviously they are busy people are sitting in the front and waiting. The hostess were not friendly. They don't greet you. I was stared at with a look of disdain and annoyance when our table was finally ready twenty minutes later, I didn't mind, we knew we had to wait she just walked us back and left... Didn't ask us if we needed a high chair for any of my kids or anything. Just left. We sat there another fifteen minutes and not a single person stopped by. We stared at many workers yet no one heeded our dear in the headlights look. Finally, one of the hostess, k*****, was behind us clearing a table. I simply said ""excuse me, it had been over fifteen minutes and no one has come by our table"" Another look of annoyance and then a very rude Response with a snippy attitude. I asked for her manager who just so happened to be right behind her. I told her of my experiences thus far and then decided to leave. Upon leaving k***** was upfront whispering with her blonde minion. I asked for her name and she held up her name tag and said ""yeah! It's K*****!"" In a very hostile manner. I let the manager know, but obviously this girl has somewhat of a free range because she has no issues being a complete c word to customers. I will never go to an apple bees again. Ever. And K***** you are a super CLASSY broad. That attitude will get you super far in life"
Angela P.,"Queen Creek, AZ",2,15,11,1.0,1/21/2014,"Food has gone down and menu too. Ordered French dip sandwich and no horseradish sauce, dry. No dressing on Asian chicken salad, no barbecue sauce for sandwich ordered, garlic bread was plain breadsticks. Service is lacking and so is food. Doubt I will go back."
Cindy G.,"Gilbert, AZ",2,5,,4.0,5/28/2015,"Why are the employees permitted to order Jimmy Johns delivery & then sit in the dining room &eat it?   Not to mention,  they are ignoring their customers while doing so!  This would never be allowed at most other establishments!  Our food & service was great!   We just thought this was a major conflict of interest! !"
Diana L.,"Fresno, CA",421,142,20,3.0,12/5/2011,"Applebee's has ok food, but it's an easy place to meet people and eat and have drinks.   I do love their traditional hot wings."
Jason F.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",3,105,,3.0,4/9/2015,"been to this pace a few times, each time the food wasn't as good as other Applebee's I've been to. service was lacking and I'm just not enthused about going back. plenty of other options around."
Lee Ann W.,"Mesa, AZ",121,115,49,3.0,1/9/2012,Have only been for lunch on 2 occasions. Salad and soup was great but it took awhile to get it. Not sure that would be good if I worked!
Marli G.,"Mesa, AZ",38,4,2,1.0,1/6/2013,"I have been to the Applebee's on Gilbert and baseline, and the service amazing! I live closer to this Applebee's, how ever I will never be returning.  I went with my mother and sister party of three including I, I gave the host my name and I even spelled my name for her. She warned us it was a 15 min wait and I was fine with that. (I work in the restaurant biz so I have grown some patience) anyway, the host was looking for MARK party of 3, no one was responding so I asked her if she meant MARLI. She said I will check. She never got back to us so we waited a little longer, after 30 min of waited I decided to ask her how much longer, she asked for me name and she responded "" I don't have you on my list"" I laughed at her and said oh maybe I was your mark party. She looked back at her list and said oh I could t read my writing. She apologized and she kindly said we will sit you right away. We got seated and walked up the a dirty table with fries all of the floor and food still on the seats. The male who Sat us said I am sorry we will clean it right now we are just busy. I was disgusted. I will never go back to this location."
Nicole H.,"Queen Creek, AZ",27,91,12,4.0,2/22/2013,I have eaten at Applebee's many times and am rarely disappointed. The service was great and the food was quick and good. Our server kept our drinks filled and our tummy's happy.
Diane S.,"Chandler, AZ",0,12,,2.0,6/4/2015,"Had lunch yesterday.  First, the new menu is CONFUSING!  Even our waitress agreed.  Ordered the brisket sliders, they tasted slightly burnt and had way too much sauce.  Side salad was ok.  Husband's 1/2 sandwich and salad was just ok.  Bathrooms were DIRTY!  I don't know when these are checked, but it looked like it had been DAYS.  Won't be back.  The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because we had a nice waitress."
Bob D.,"Mesa, AZ",48,26,20,5.0,1/30/2014,Great lunch... We did the 2 for $24  food was awesome.  The service was also great Doree took great care of us our drinks were never empty and she made sure to keep checking on us to make sure we were ok.  Great Applebee's to eat at
Ryan D.,"Gilbert, AZ",62,106,57,4.0,6/19/2013,"Friendly service, good tasting food. Lots of TVs and good happy hour drink prices."
Vicki N.,"Bryan, TX",84,107,16,4.0,10/11/2010,This particular Applebees is a great fun time on Thursdays! They have live music of Brian Legate and the whole bar gets into the act. Sometimes the waiter will get up there and sing with him. He plays rock music and takes requests. What I love about this Applebees is they always remember you when you come in. They even remember your favorite drinks. You'll be lucky if you get Roxy or Wendy as a waitress. they are fun! Happy Hour has $2 beers and $4 Long Island Ice Teas!! Oh and wings for $4 too.
Kelly B.,"Gilbert, AZ",5,46,23,4.0,7/20/2014,Good food. Service was kinda slow. There were an unusually high number of people here for 3pm on a Sunday. Can't go wrong with the Mac n cheese with chicken. Omg so good. My son liked the chicle tenders.
Dan N.,"Gilbert, AZ",8,21,6,2.0,4/14/2012,"The food is ok, but the customer service is lacking like water in Arizona."
Sandy M.,"Chandler, AZ",0,4,,1.0,12/28/2014,"Now I know why so many Applebee's restaurants are closing. I had a gift card and had to go out of my way to find a restaurant near me. Both my and my daughter's food was practically unedible. I ordered fish and chips that was almost burnt. My daughter ordered the sliders which were also cooked dry. The server was nice enough, but I will not go out of my way to come here for a bad meal again."
Mike M.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,1,,1.0,9/15/2013,"I have had better service at a fast food restaurants! My family waited over 30 min before we were asked what we wanted to drink, drinks took 20 min to get. Meanwhile there was several other tables being served by the same waiters and getting there food orders. On top of that we heard the manager giving other tables free appetizers saying they were on him because of the people having to wait. Manager never once stopped at are table. We should have just walked out. Lesson learn. Applebee's has some of the worse service! This is the third one we have been to and never again will we eat at one."
Rochelle D.,"Mesa, AZ",35,41,,5.0,3/9/2013,The 4 of us had a w onderful lunch there yesterday- we were greeted and served quickly and they were busy but server Caitlin took great care of us and the food was terrific. We were all pleased and the manager Frank was fantastic and greeted us. Thank you for a really nice lunch~We will all be back soon!
John W.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",14,39,23,2.0,11/11/2011,"A clear disappointment.  The only reason that I ate here was the free Veterans Day meal.  It was more like an appetizer.  Not only that, but for restaurant claiming to support veterans and the military, it makes them look bad when they post a ""no firearms"" sign on their front door."
Ann P.,"Chandler, AZ",0,6,,1.0,1/13/2012,"Ordered pork wonton tacos as appetizer. Pork was dried out chunks that tasted like the end of ham, sort of like the end rind. Complained, but kitchen manager did not report back and tell me what he found in the kitchen, as both me and my partner thought he would do. Ordered the bruschetta chicken salad. The tomatoes were not made into a bruschetta, but huge chunks. No red onion or roasted peppers to be found, as pictured and described. I have ordered these dishes before in another location and never been disappointed.  Staff needs retraining on the correct presentation and ingredients. The manager did not even offer  to exchange my appetizer or take it off my bill. Your manager can find me if he chooses to make it right. This was at the Power/ Ray Rd location in Gilbert, AZ. My ticket number is TB#41, ordered 2 salads and appetizer. on 1-13-12. Called  Applebee's corporate in KC and was called by the store manager the same day. Funny how that results in quick action as I was issued a gift card. And no, I do not work for nor have I ever worked  for any restaurant or diner or food establishment in the last 30 years. I simply want to spend my money on establishments that provide both good food and service."
