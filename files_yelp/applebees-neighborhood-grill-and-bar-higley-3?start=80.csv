Gary G.,"Tempe, AZ",0,15,16,1.0,5/4/2014,"Apparently don't come here a Sunday afternoon. We have been here an hour and still haven't got our food. Food was old, dry and cold. Better food at a dive bar."
david t.,"Westerville, OH",0,7,,1.0,9/9/2011,"Being in the restaurant business I understand times are tough. Any type of promotion to bring in guests that is feasible would give the ""edge"" to a particular business. Frequenting this particular applebees I felt like I just walked into club applebees. The volume is way over the top. Service was compatible to a crowded bar with one bartender to serve. I sat at a table to wait 10 minutes before even being greeted by my server. With the music it came as no sunrise that the food order came out totally incorrect. After trying to stomach through the wrongly prepared item, I had to regrettably send it back. After 2 minutes it came back corrected with the quality parallel to Taco Bell. The identity is in question, the food is a pathetic excuse for a full service franchise, and service that I could find in a dive bar. Highly disappointed in this franchise as of late. Past three visits to different area locations have ended in similar fashion. So sad."
