Jessica R.,"Columbus, OH",84,92,84,4.0,1/31/2017,"I know what you're thinking. Applebees? Chain? 4 stars? I know! I think the same thing sometimes. But Applebees is a good place to go for groups. You can't beat the large menu. There's always something for everyone and the service is always great.  They've got happy hour twice a day. Once from 3-6 and then after 9p. Drink and app specials. Tuesday's are their wings specials (my personal fav day/night to attend).  For reals guys, it's not that bad. Trust me! :)"
Steve H.,"Columbus, OH",2,29,40,2.0,12/5/2017,"I feel bad giving this rating a 2 because our waitress tried even though I think she was forced into taking our table while the ENTIRE restaurant staff watched Dr. Phil and this included the manager: how do you even make a complaint when the manager is involved. Someone hooked their phone up and started playing songs that included vulgarity and we was sitting next to senior citizens who sort of looked at each other a bit confused, which was sad honestly. My daughter asked for no tomatoes on her salad so when a waiter brought it out it and it had tomatoes on it, I told him and his response was ""oh man"" you want me to fix it ? You shouldn't have to ask first off because if she wanted tomatoes the first damn place she never would have said hold them back. I ordered Chicken Won-ton tacos and more than a few had minimal ingredients which was really pathetic. I come to this location because I've enjoyed the service over the years but there must be a change in management because this is 2 times in a row that the impression I have  is really unsatisfactory and I make no plans to return. I guess Grove City will have to take my money going forward. By the way... first photo, crew watching TV and second one is my lack of goodies in my tacos."
Peter G.,"Columbus, OH",209,52,89,4.0,1/10/2017,"I have to admit, I'm a sucker for half price apps at Applebee's.  Growing up we would often visit our local Applebee's after a movie on a Friday or Saturday night for tasty half price apps and discounted drinks.  Still to this day I cannot find a spinach and artichoke dip that i like better than Applebee's.  Their two for twenty menu has a nice variety on it and we normally get that if we are there too early for half priced apps.  I always try to end with the molten chocolate cake as this is my favorite one out of all restaurants that I have visited.  My favorite drink there is the Red Apple Sangria which is absolutely delicious and comes in a cauldron looking glass. Yes it's a chain and the food may be hit or miss depending on what you get but if you're going for bar food and great drinks you really can't beat it."
Theresa W.,"Columbus, OH",126,73,132,3.0,1/19/2017,Half-priced apps - woo hoo! The food was pretty good for Applebee's and our bartender really nice. But why was there clubbing music playing 4 pm in the afternoon at max volume?
Ciara M.,"Columbus, OH",23,16,2,5.0,4/16/2017,"Ashley M. at the bar is a fabulous bartender! She's very personable, attentive and a great multitasker. Every time I come in, her service is superb!"
Jevon T.,"Columbus, OH",42,6,2,1.0,3/3/2017,Poor customer service was greeted at the door but when we sat down nothing no hello can i start you with appitzer or are you thirsty nothing did not stay there another second got up and left. If i wanted the silent treatment i would have stayed home and cooked
Kirk S.,"Washington, DC",204,648,24,2.0,11/26/2015,"The service here is excellent.  Everything else is... ehh. You almost certainly know what this place is: a freakin' bastion of middle-America, a sort of chain restaurant in every sense of the word.  It's huge, it's filled with nice booths and television screens and iPads you order from, and there's ""The Big Bang Theory"" on TV.  This place is for cute little families that shop at Target and watch ABC Family or the Disney Channel or something.   The food here isn't cheap but isn't remarkably expensive, and it really fails to impress in any way - but that's not really anyone's fault.  I had the Bourbon Street Steak, which was basically their 9 oz steak doused in some sort of liquid and put on top of a few mushrooms and slivers of onion.  It was good - a bit overcooked in certain areas and desperately in need of whatever sauce was thrown on it - and simple.  The fries were good as well, though also inconsistently seasoned.  It was the kind of food that was good, but not exactly something I'd consider mind-blowing or even really a ""hit the spot"" sort of meal. The service here is surprisingly solid.  I didn't expect much for a location like this but was pleasantly surprised: the people here are genuinely nice and fast-working, even if the ultimate product is basic.  What I complain about is 100% unquestionably not their fault. In essence, this is exactly what you think it is.  If that's what you're in the mood for, go for it. Otherwise, there are a billion other places you can - and should - go."
Elisa M.,"Hilliard, OH",39,29,1,4.0,9/18/2016,Tried the carside to go for the first time. Filled out my order online and was told exactly how long it would be til the order was ready. They did not disappoint. Service to the car window was prompt and courteous. My order was exactly what I placed. As far as food goes - I love their apps. Having the option of the varied smaller app choices is  great. Wish it included their whole app menu. Chicken wanton tacos and the pretzels - truly a go to item.
Bridget B.,"Galloway, OH",0,24,60,3.0,7/7/2016,"Food is pretty good, the service is hit and miss but I do enjoy some of their dishes. Love the chicken wonton tacos , spinach artichoke dip and whiskey chicken dinner."
Steve L.,"Hilliard, OH",16,5,2,1.0,10/10/2014,"I'm not one to leave reviews; however, I can't ignore it this time.  We've tried this applebee's on numerous occasions over the last 3-4 years.  In fact our last experience kept us from this location for over 2 years (even though we live 1 mile away).   Unacceptable wait (after sitting down we waited 45 minutes for food to arrive).  We were about ready to leave realizing that nothing had changed and then the food arrived so we forged ahead--bad mistake.  That's when the adventure began. My son's hamburger was actually a slider and some nasty yogurt (see picture).  Long story short, it came back twice and was still raw on the last time.   We explained to the waitress that we thought $5 was a bit excessive for a slider and some yogurt...she was quick to point out that that included the juice box!  Fantastic, i feel better now ;) Anyway my steak was microwaved too long (far cry from medium) and not sure what exactly that was on my wife's plate but it was supposed to be fiesta lime chicken w/rice.   Long story short, we got comped for the meal (definitely not desired but appreciated).  I appreciate them doing their part to make it right but in all honesty this restaurant, management, menu, food, specials is continuing down a path of mediocracy that we're unwilling to put up with since there are so many alternatives in the area.  I hope your experience(s) are better than ours have been.  We're done with this location."
Mark K.,"Columbus, OH",182,1929,1240,3.0,8/27/2014,"It's all about the ribs. Yeah, I saw a commercial about all-you-can-eat ribs.  So of course I was interested.  I've been to Applebee's before.  It's never my first choice, for barbecue or anything else.  But it's a decent place to go meet friends, and I've always had good service.  First time at this location, since I was running errands nearby and I had ribs on the brain.  I started off with the Asian sauce.  It was a little spicy, sweet, and tangy.  Thick but not running off the ribs.  Not sure what the appeal of ""crosscut"" ribs is; they are bony and a little annoying to eat.  But, I'm sure they're easier to cook.  Anyway, mine were done fairly well, and I chowed down.  Each order comes with slaw (meh) and ""barbecue-seasoned"" fries (well, I couldn't detect much seasoning besides salt, and the fries themselves were subpar.)   For my second order (hey, all-you-can-eat,) I tried the chipotle sauce.  No heat to speak of; a little smoky chipotle flavor.  Not bad, but definitely not my first choice.  The second order was smaller, which was cool.  I couldn't bring myself to place a third order.  The other sauce is their standard honey barbecue, which I've had and remember as alright. All in all, I'd go back.  It's a comfortable place,  Service was good. The food is decent.  I can't think of any negatives."
Jim O.,"Hilliard, OH",9,7,,4.0,7/20/2016,"We had a party of 7 and we were seated right away. Our server Ashley was awesome, everything was correct and our drinks were never empty. The wood fire grill steaks were thick and flavorful and the broccoli was steamed perfectly. They were even nice to give me a treat for my birthday at the end. All in all it was a great birthday dinner!"
Kassim G.,"Columbus, OH",88,1,,1.0,11/19/2016,Very bad service ive been sitting at the table for atleast 30 minutes and nobody has addeessed us and people that came after me were served very racist they didnt even offer us nothing to drink
Hannah V.,"Galloway, OH",25,14,2,2.0,5/9/2014,"I went here tonight with a couple girlfriends because we really enjoy their perfect margaritas. But tonight the food was less than mediocre. I ordered the Roma Steak Sirloin and it was horrible. There were no Roma tomatoes on the steak nor were the potatoes it came with seasoned. I ordered my steak rare and it was tough and chewy.  I've never sent my food back until tonight. The waitress was very sweet about it and so was the manager and they comped my meal. The only reason why I'm giving them a two is because I've now had multiple bad experiences with the food being absolutely not what I asked for. The Applebee's on Georgesville Road is much, much better. I'll be going there next time if I want my food cooked correctly. I'll never be returning to this location."
J T.,"Hilliard, OH",0,41,2,1.0,10/18/2015,I live less than a mile away and have had some bad experiences. Went back again for some more abuse. Service week. Service slow. Table and seats greasy.  Bathrooms smelled like urine and a dirty dish rag. My booth was just vacated by a family with small children - I had to clean the rest of the mess they left. I cleaned my seat with a (mildew smelling rag) I got from the hostess. Table greasy - needed cleaned. Was finished with our meal.........but leaving was the hard part. I gave the waitress a $100. took her almost 15 min to bring my change. We saw her chatting with the other staff and waiting on other tables while I'm waiting for my change. I hate being held hostage at a restaurant !!  Probably be another year or so before I go back.
Brad S.,"Dublin, OH",1,30,1,2.0,9/28/2016,"Let me start by saying I have not been to Applebee's in about a year. Before that I came here very often, 2-3 times a week. A lot has changed here over the last couple years, most not to my liking. Applebee's has made a number of changes to the menu, food, and happy hour. In the past  I would leave work a little early to make sure I could get a seat at the bar. It was always a good crowd, good food, and a good value. I don't know what happen but everything changed. The food wasn't as good as it was before, servings were smaller, and with the constant change of happy hour you didn't know what you were walking into. So, after a few not so great experiences I stopped going to Applebee's.  It has been a long time so I figured I would try it again. Getting here around 5:30 the place was not busy at all, only one other couple sitting at the bar. It stayed that way the whole time I was there.  That was never the case in the past. The service was good but food was mediocre. Maybe in another year I will try again, if they are still here."
Ron D.,"Galloway, OH",4,37,6,1.0,6/4/2015,One of the worse meals my wife and I have had. The meat was Grey awful stuff. Frozen food. Service was good.
Dan L.,"Columbus, OH",3,21,1,3.0,8/30/2015,"Service was good  but  was a bit slow for what I am used to at Applebee's, but the food was good and  servers were friendly."
Anna H.,"Hilliard, OH",192,541,206,3.0,2/19/2014,"This was my first visit even though it's fairly close to home.  I met a friend and it was her choice.  The lunch combo menu is interesting and available on Sundays (it says everyday 11-3).   We each had soup & salad.  The food was pretty darn good and our server was great and very attentive.  I may come back, but there are a lot of other places I would go first."
Critic M.,"Columbus, OH",1,34,4,5.0,7/19/2015,"Big yes. They're doing a great job on customer service and the quality of the food.  Everything is well done and organized. The food was cooked to perfection. Exactly the way I wanted my brew pub philly burger. Great place, great food and great people. That's what makes me come back."
Brian F.,"Hilliard, OH",328,285,10,3.0,7/31/2013,"It's Applebees, so you know what you are getting.  I thought the service was really quite good (we had a nice server with a lot of personality).  My friend and I both ordered the fajita burrito, and it was pretty good.  Definitely get an extra side of the Mexi-Ranch, if you are so inclined.  I wasn't super full afterward, so I don't know if it was that good of a value.  Overall, not a bad experience."
Andy R.,"Dublin, OH",3,4,3,1.0,12/23/2014,Has to be the worse managed Applebee's I have ever been to.  Warm beer and slow service.  I actually just walked out cause the bartender didn't come to wait on me.  I would hate to see him when they are busy!  I would stay away with me! There are way too many other choices!  Wishing I could give less than one star!
JB B.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,21,,2.0,5/5/2013,"First time for this location.  Much fewer cars compared to other restaurants in the area.  Not busy - taken to a table which we did not like (one side in aisle) and we asked for a booth.  Seated in a section with dirty tables all around. This location is way overdue for a remodel.  The only thing that looked newer was the carpeting.  Looked and felt dirty, from the dingy low ceiling tiles to the dirty window sills, tables, seats.  Everything felt sticky.  The table cards and menus were gross - these should be wiped daily.  Service was average.  Food was slightly below average.  We don't eat out much and were really looking forward to dinner.  We chose Applebee's because we had always experienced good food in a good atmosphere.   Three in our party - mom got the fajitas and really enjoyed her meal - the steak was cooked perfectly, had good flavor and was seasoned as requested.  Hubby got a burger and fries.  The burger was burned (outside was black - asked for medium well) as were the fries.  He was really disappointed.  I got the half oriental chicken salad which was just okay - the lettuce was not very fresh and there was not much chicken - for almost $9 there should be a whole chicken breast. Applebee's as a whole has a great thing going - this location will be going away if it doesn't get its act together."
Alan R.,"Columbus, OH",117,154,48,4.0,1/14/2013,"Im a fan. My wife and I went here a few weeks ago, right when CBUS got pounded by a storm. Well apparently we were not the only ones who wanted to eat out on a Wednesday, so it was kinda busy. Only about half the staff showed up on this cold snowing night. We waited longer for everything, to be sat, getting drinks, food, bill, you name it. I think we were there for a good 1.5 hours.  During the whole meal the staff was great and very apologetic and the mgr came by a couple of times to apologize and chat.  The food was tasty and we got our app for free do to the crazy wait for stuff. We didn't ask for free food or anything the MGR was giving free apps to everyone if they wanted it.  I will be back!"
Ron H.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,1,,1.0,10/19/2014,Terrible service - we asked the waitress what was taking so long with our appetizer order & she told us she didn't know... We suggested she go check in the kitchen & find out. She then eturned with our appitizer - go figure ! . Then we waited way to long for our main course & when we received the food it was cold. When we asked for a manager no one showed up. Needless to say we had a terrible expierenece as did every table around us. Until the manger figures out that this place is terrible I'm certain Applebees will continue to loose customers. Apparently this doesn't bother the staff at the Hilliard Applebees so I'll do my part & spread the word just how bad this place is.
Rick N.,"Dayton, OH",0,3,3,1.0,10/25/2014,Unbelievably Bad service. 15 minute wait turned into 30 minute wait. Had to ask our waitress 4 times to bring us crackers for the baby. Took 45 minutes to get our cold food to the table. Restaurant ran out of clean silverware and had to bring us plasticware instead. Horrible.
Karen W.,"Columbus, OH",51,419,148,4.0,1/28/2012,"Great place to meet if you're going to meet up with some friends. There's a variety of foods that you can choose from and plenty of alcoholic drinks you can choose from too. The decor seems to always be the same with the memorbilia on the walls. TVs are everywhere, especially close to the bar. You cant go wrong at this place. You might have to wait a little while longer for food, but it is definitely worth it!"
Troy S.,"Hilliard, OH",87,730,522,3.0,11/5/2011,"Do Yelpers review generic chain restaurants?  I guess I will since I have frequented this establishment a number of times.  I would not say I love this place because it is just a basic restaurant that one can find in numerous neighbourhoods throughout the States.  But, it also is close to my house, good Happy Hour prices, not packed on OSU game nights, most people can find something edible and to their tastes, decent service, and some healthy options are available. I went here because I was tardy on my arrival at a local Sports Pub.  no space for two people sent us to the nearest restaurant for kickoff.  I sat right under the TV and the bar area had about 5-10 fans who cared about the game.  It worked for us till halftime.   Service-  I have rarely had horrible experience at Applebee's as their manager is present and the wait staff is efficient. My water was never empty and I drank 3-5 glasses over 2 hours.  Food- The food is always decent.  I ordered steak and shrimp because I am counting my calories and it fell in at 550 calories.  Which I cut down by doubling my veggies and cutting out the potato.  I went here under the premise that it was not a steak place and it confirmed that.  The steak was a little tough but it was what I expected to receive at a generic chain that doesn't specialize in steak.  The flavor was good and I only ate half of my steak which when warmed up on Monday tasted better (weird).  The Broccoli was steamed and probably could have spent another minute or two in the kitchen.   Best Part-  Dessert-  Blondie-  This is the only reason I really like coming here because I really like their Blondie which I cheated on while sharing it with my wife.  I only ate 1/3 of it so I kept with my plan to eat light."
Alan K.,"Hilliard, OH",1,18,,1.0,6/26/2012,I have literally been to hundreds of Applebee's....... No matter how many chances I give them - they continually let me down and it is never for the same reason.  One time food rocks and service is atrocious.  Other times food is weak and the service is great - etc... Why am I critiquing this one?  I live in Hillard.  Make no mistake about it though - this is intended for the entire chain!
L A.,"Hilliard, OH",18,34,1,5.0,11/8/2013,"Applebee's is great , chill , decent prices , Iove happy hour :)"
Michael H.,"Columbus, OH",0,10,,1.0,10/10/2014,Horrible service. We were told there was a ten minute wait and were forgotten. We were then seated and forgotten. We didn't get silverware or drinks for almost 30 minutes and then spent 20 more minutes waiting after that.
Penelope C.,"Hilliard, OH",1,11,,1.0,10/20/2013,"So went there today...usually don't go there, but had been there a month ago late night and enjoyed the experience,  but to day the waitress was the worse I have ever encountered!!!!  1.  She took our drink orders but then walked past us with my daughters beverage in hand to talk to someone.  2. She did not give us any info about specials, but I did not realize it until I saw how much detail she provided to the guests who were seated on either side of us.  3.  Another waiter brought our food.  We asked for two condiments.  But we noticed we had no utensils.  When the original waitress comes back and asks how does it taste, I laughed and said, I don't know, we don't have utensils.  She said oh, right like you wouldn't  eat with your fingers.  But rather than get us utensils, she  proceeded to engage the customers at the table next to us.  We sat patiently. Finally, I got up and said could we please have some utensils.  She said in a minute, I have to go to the back and roll some.  But she xontinued to talk to the other customers.  I walked to the front door, grabbed two rolled sets of utensils and made it back to my booth, asking also to see the manager.  As I walked back to our booth with the utensils, she yells to some unknown being (we saw no one she was speaking to), ""never mind!""  The manager comes over wanting to know what the problem was.  I didn't want a scene but I quietly told him what was going on.  So he discounted up meals.  No big deal.  We were there to eat and pay, so a discount was not an issue.  But he seemed not to address her behavior, bc she routinely came back to our table...and here's the thing she was so nasty to us...could it be bc we are minorities?  Please don't let it be that, but the treatment she gave us was remarkable different than how she treated those around us who were not obvious minorities.  WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE AGAIN!"
G B.,"Galloway, OH",0,2,,2.0,10/21/2012,husband and I went there for lunch on several occasions. Food is usually cold and service is terrible. We got the trios. I had the spinich dip. Ice cold.. My husband had the sliders and wings. His burgers were pink in the middle. He sent them back and they came out pink again. Finally we got the manager and he tried to take care of it. The burgers came out burned black. Apparently the chef thinks his mistakes are a joke. Have never been back and probably never will. The service is usually pretty slow. Took forever to get the check so we could leave.
