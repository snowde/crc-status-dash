Amanda A.,"Mark, IL",1,13,2,3.0,11/7/2017,Food is what to be ecpected from an applebees.... convenient next to hotels Service needs improvement. Happy hour apps are good.
Kevin S.,"Marion, NC",17,70,93,5.0,5/12/2017,"From beginning to end this was a great experience.  The greeter welcomed us holding the door and made us feel like they were here for us. Our server, Alicia was helpful and knowledgeable. My steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked as well as the grilled vegetables. Only ""complaint"" I have is they didn't have Yuengling on tap or in bottle. Alicia again made the meal great with her charm and smile."
Tony G.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,24,5,2.0,8/3/2017,"A consistent dining experience is usually a good thing for a chain restaurant.  Not so much when that consistency is for terrible food.  Ordered one burger and got another instead, wife ordered the Mac and cheese with chicken and had to ask them to microwave it because a lot of the macaroni was still cold.  The waitress was nice at least. #neveragain"
Becca F.,"Hinesville, GA",0,5,,5.0,11/6/2017,Stef is the best bartender and made my experience unforgettable! The wonton tacos she recommended were so good! Go see her!
Mike W.,"Marietta, GA",74,75,36,4.0,11/6/2016,"I had a pleasant experience at this Applebee's. Our server was very attentive and kept our drinks refilled. I got the Blazin' Texan burger. The taste combination was interesting. I enjoyed it. The savory + spicy taste really hit the spot. My french fries were cold though. Also, the number of fries received was low. It wasn't justified by the prices they charge. I got the fried apple cheesecake for desert. It was tasty, but a little on the cold side. The caramel drizzle was a bit messy. It was sprinkled on the dish as if someone was rushing to do it, making it hard to really enjoy it. The stickiness ruined the experience.  I would recommend this location to anyone. However, avoid peak times so you won't have to deal with spotty customer service."
Nitra B.,"Hinesville, GA",0,9,,5.0,7/24/2017,Great for a lil hang out and i always get the burger that have the egg on top of it and fries. Never had a bad experience and its always the way i order it
Teschia B.,"Savannah, GA",32,137,66,4.0,2/7/2017,"I'm not sure why the bad reviews. Our dining experience was amazing and the food was great. We ordered the Bourbon Chicken and some sort of meat plate. Our waiter, I think her name was Sam was very attentive and made sure that we were good to go with our dining experience. I liked that they have a tablet on the table where you can order and purchase your food. I was not a fan when I had to pay extra money to use the tablet to play games. It should be official. You order over $15 in drinks. You get to play games for free. Also, we need bigger portions. I'm a big woman and when I go out and drop coins. I like to eat. Better portions with the prices and you will get 5 stars. Other then that me and hubby will be dining here again. I will add that what made our night horrible, was the family sitting beside us that had a baby and she was completely naked. Like only had a diaper on, while these folks were dining. Like WTF. Who brings their baby to a restaurant with no clothes. Even if the child pissed himself, I have children and have been there before, but I would never have them in public like that. Girl...do better!"
Krystal H.,"Richmond Hill, GA",87,80,331,1.0,10/5/2015,"Only after achieving duchess status, I find myself writing this review. I've been to this particular establishment numerous times for lunch. I have come back for punishment to this place in hopes of new management/improvement, but alas, here I am...Officially throwing in the towel with this place.  On multiple visits food has been incorrect, bills not reflecting the appropriate amounts, and one time, our waitress even said after she messed something up, ""oh, I had a blonde moment"" (to which she was not blonde, however I am; therefore I did take offense to that). But this last time takes the cake.  My food came out after my entire group had already eaten, and paid their tabs. And when my food did come out, it was incorrect, and sent to the wrong table (by this point, I almost felt as this had to be on purpose or that I was being filmed). I spoke to the manager who was extremely rude about the entire situation.  Our entire group from work which has taken multiple parties there for work functions, will never be back."
Louie L.,"Clarksville, TN",44,68,37,4.0,12/7/2016,"I always get chicken and shrimps on penne with Alfredo sauce, it isn't on the menu but you can request for it. My husband and I always get carona-rita and it tastes yummy"
S L.,"Charlotte, NC",0,1,,5.0,7/11/2017,"So I wanted to be deterred because of all the negative reviews, BUT I was staying in a hotel close to this location and decided to give it a try. First time, my bartender, Tameika was AWESOME! She was attentive and personable and recommended an amazing dish. Second time, Steph was our bartender and she was equally as bad ass! The ONLY reason I can think of  for these bad reviews are the people doing the reviewing! I sat there and watched 3 soldiers get great service and leave  2 bucks on $60! Get the F@#$ outta here! Cheap asses! Servers work hard for their money! I would TOTALLY recommend coming in and seeing these 2 chicks! Great food for a great price with great service...yes please!"
Kathrin E.,"Guyton, GA",3,111,68,1.0,11/20/2016,"Horrible slow service !!!! No , it is not OKAY to have to wait for 45 minutes for your steak with no explanation ....and yes, a waitress is supposed to check periodically if you have your food and ours didn't.   And then sitting right behind some punks who were obviously not raised well at home since even after asked to please not vape ...they did it anyway and purposely blew a bunch of vapes when they left.  Not one time where they told by management to stop."
Toni Z.,"Concord, NC",0,56,109,3.0,4/9/2016,"Typical Applebee's, but, seemed like newer decor than my local place. Photos and murals of nearby Ft Stewart. Had the Brewhouse Chicken. Not bad, but, I really could not pick out any brew taste.  More like just a decent (in prepackaged terms) brown gravy. Recommend they only put gravy below the chicken in order to allow chicken and onion rings to stay crispy.  Husband had chicken tenders and sweet potato fries. Tenders nothing special and small.  Fries came with a unique dipping sauce.  Maple something or other.  Reminded me of cinnamon bun icing.  Place was clean. I saw no dust or anything concerning."
M K.,"Paterson, NJ",6,25,4,1.0,7/8/2016,"Horrible experience. Didn't receive any service, water..nada... save your money and time."
Eric B.,"San Antonio, TX",31,300,197,3.0,8/27/2015,I have been to more then a couple Applebee's around the nation and this one ranks in the middle.  Nothing to special.  I must say though that the bar tender handled a situation very well when two ladies just didn't think their drinks were made correctly and kept insisting that the she make another one.  Come On... Strawberry Daiquiri?  really... the Bartender remixed 4 Strawberry Daiquiris trying to satisfy these two women... it was obvious after the 2nd drink that they were they for the free sample hors-d'oeuves and trying to swindle free drinks to go with them... Hats off to the Bartender as she handled it like a pro... when she should have stopped at the 3rd drink.
Jeffrey B.,"Hinesville, GA",36,6,,4.0,9/17/2016,I am not sure what Applebee's did with their American Standard Hamburger.  But that was an outstanding hamburger.  My wife and I ordered the same thing and she was saying the same.   Very good keep up the good work.  Hopefully this change will be good for the Applebee's in Hinesville.
Tamara H.,"Savannah, GA",3,5,4,1.0,8/12/2015,The SMELL! it smells like standing sewer water- and you won't get used to it! Mold on my bread!food slow.service ok. Manager brought me replacement meatballs (that had the moldy bread on the plate) is a dirty sweat stained shirt! I used to like this place but I'm done ! I'm sure that rancid smell and my moldy bread are related
Steve B.,"Atlanta, GA",12,777,203,3.0,8/1/2014,"Just your typical Applebees.  Same food, similar service.  Pretty good actually.  Definitely not a bad place, especially in this town where not too many in regards to a major city.  For a chain, has the hometown feel to it. Not great, not bad.  It does the trick and right on the strip. Grade: C"
Justin W.,"Jefferson City, MO",0,19,,5.0,6/22/2016,At 10:30pm there are not many options here like the other reviewer mentioned.  Was told it was happy hour and had great service from Mr Norberto.  10% hotel discount and half off drinks....ill be back:)
Benjamin C.,"Savannah, GA",0,2,,1.0,1/16/2016,"So we have eaten here before, but tonight was different.  Server took 15 minutes to come to our table after being seated.  The table was sticky and the top appeared to be peeling. The Kiosk thing on the table was nasty, you could see that someone wiped the screen but nothing else.  The manager was busing tables and did not look like the manager.  Employees were standing around arguing about who was doing what or talking about guest.   Food was average at best and the prices are to high. 12 bucks for some mac and cheese with some bacon on it (really)."
Ares V.,"Fort Stewart, GA",0,11,14,5.0,1/15/2016,"I'm shocked to see the not so good reviews , I eat often here and I had never had any issue with nobody , the servers are very nice , the food is great and I never had a billing issue , but this is my experience ..."
Adrian Y.,"Copperas Cove, TX",0,27,,1.0,5/20/2016,"Don't waste your time!!!   This place has awful food.   Server was decent & friendly, but most staff just sits / stands around Gossiping about each other...   I can deal with that but damn the food was NASTY!!!!    I ordered From the light sides food menu trying to eat healthy & the Thai Shrimp Salad was just smothered in sauce!!!!    I felt like I was eating straight Salt/Sodium..   Rice was like Brine.   Don't waste your time or money here.   It's not like most Applebee's franchise's...    Freak'n Nasty..."
Taneisha G.,"Detroit, MI",76,43,462,1.0,1/23/2015,"It's Friday Night (10 PM).  I wake up from my nap, starving.  I pull up the Apple Bees website and try to order.  It's not working,  so I call the restaurant. Their computers are down and they are too lazy to manually take orders..... Please wait an hour and call back..."
Jesse H.,"Hinesville, GA",0,2,,1.0,11/18/2016,"I came to Applebee's in hinesville ga with my fiance, her mom, her son and his fiance and daughter to have a family dinner together. I had ordered the salmon and my fiance and her mom ordered steak. I was highly disgusted to see that my fiances steak was still moving and her mom's steak was well done when want med rare. My salmon should of been still swimming it was nearly raw in the middle. The waitresses was great but the cook had lowered my expectations of this place. I feel ashamed by telling my fiances mom this place has good cooking. Applebee's has let me down and now I am not sure that I can trust to come here again"
Tiffany S.,"Fort Stewart, GA",156,6,1,1.0,2/15/2016,"Worst service ever!!! Food service was slow by the time I got my food everyone else was done. Also server kept reaching across others food to pass things across the table, how rude!!!!"
Ashley G.,"Casas Adobes, Tucson, AZ",26,22,1,3.0,12/28/2015,Applebee's is decent. Never had a problem with the service the food is ehh average. I have noticed they have raised the prices on the food.
Lakia M.,"Newport News, VA",3,40,4,1.0,3/27/2014,"New look, same shitty service. It's Friday nite, why is there only 1 bartender?! Then you stick the ditzy dumb blonde in the bar area. Mind you, she only 2 tables and my party was blessed with sitting in one of them; she acted like she didn't know what she was doing. Told her I wanted less ice in my drink..(seriously stop filling up the goblets to the top with ice, I want my alcohol) I get my mucho Bahama Mama back tasting like pineapple juice. Told her I want rum with my juice (duh) took 15 min to get back the same damn drink. We ordered wings to go. We got the check, paid, got our change but still no wings. After the waitress comes back to the table to clear the plates, we asked for the wings. Her response ""oh you want them now?"" WTF??!!"
Melissa T.,"Decatur, GA",79,348,85,2.0,4/7/2014,"The Fairfield Inn lured me over with promises of 10% off....twice. And twice I walked back to the Fairfield Inn with angst in my heart because I should've known better. I should've listen to my gut, my mother, the little voice in my head....anyone or any past experience that has taught me that eating in chain restaurants in small towns is destined to result in unhappiness. First I tried a turkey sandwich with a caesar salad to go. It was supposed to have avocado on it but the avocado must have run away after it saw what I uncovered next... The salad's croutons. They were drowning in dressing and calling out for help but I couldn't save them. They sank to a soggy grave. Next I tried a steak with sautéed mushrooms and onions but to try that to go would surely be ludicrous so I copped a seat at the bar and waited on someone to take my order. I checked my email and then Facebook and then some other apps until my phone was almost dead. At the frightening realization that I was about to run out of ways to entertain myself, I started looking around frantically and asked that someone please take my order.  Several minutes later the steak arrived with the two cutest little mushrooms on it. They smiled at each other as I  devoured them to squash my hunger pains. The other veggies on the plate had died from heat stroke from being under the lamp for too long though. I tried to revive them with butter, salt, and then pepper but alas, it was too late. I placed them next to the remaining bits of overcooked steak and covered them all with a white paper napkin so no one else had to witness the gruesomeness of the crime scene. RIP. O o   x"
Shawntae M.,"Olympia, WA",20,1,,1.0,11/3/2015,"This is my first time rating any establishment. I didn't even get to ordering a meal. A random waiter brought my 3 year old and I something to drink to get us started. After 20 minutes of waiting, the so-called manager walked around asking everyone about their meal and service skipping over me (even asked the couple across from me who hadn't even settled in their seat). I picked my daughter up and left even as she yelled that she was hungry. According to the other reviews, no telling if she would have received a meal. From the manager down, this staff needs customer service training."
Danny L.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",18,89,8,1.0,3/19/2015,"I ordered their sirloin steak; should have known better. Imagine a fake pressed steak in the realm of chicken Mc Nuggets. The vegetables were far from fresh cooked, cold and rubbery, The most obvious problem is management and second,  Applebee's quality of product. It is a stretch, but good management can at least make cookie-cutter mass produced food edible. I left with a sickening feeling that took a few hours to shake off. On a positive note, the waiter was pretty decent. He never delivered the Heinz 57 sauce I requested however. Otherwise his service would have been excellent."
Jason H.,"Savannah, GA",78,63,393,4.0,3/27/2014,Good during both visits for lunch. Food is pretty good. I really appreciate managers walking through the restaurant checking on tables and customers. It is a quick drive outside of Ft Stewart.
Brittany O.,"Hinesville, GA",26,5,,1.0,9/21/2015,I have visited this location 3 times. Twice for Dinner and once for lunch. As far as lunch was concerned it was OK. Dinner on the other hand was a disgrace! My husband and I went there for my birthday and I had to ask the server 3 times for water as she only walked by. She never came back to the table after she took our initial order. I had to order my birthday desert and pay on the machine as no one ever came back.
Jasmine-Angelika B.,"Fort Stewart, GA",1,11,,3.0,12/31/2014,It is really a hit or miss with this place. They really need to work on the quality of their service. Food is not always cooked to proper order. Servers are always training which causes confusion during the busy hours. Overall there needs to be more communication with the staff to keep customers satisfied.
Jennifer B.,"Midway, GA",84,3,,1.0,8/16/2015,"Hasn't improved. This was our first visit back in three years, due to the awful food from the last time. Sad to say, it hasn't changed. Don't bother with the sirloin steak in any form. Freezer burned, weird texture and never cooked properly. Very low grade quality of meat, for the price. One would get a better grade cut in the bargain bin at Walmart. Took 45 minutes to get our main dishes, then when they arrived, sides were on the wrong plates, steaks grossly overcooked. Dining room was dirty (food, straw wrappers, bits of napkin on the floor). Booth and table had a greasy feel to it. The only high point were the hostess and our server. Both were friendly, attentive and provided great service."
Lashawn S.,"Schofield Barracks, HI",82,8,4,1.0,3/10/2015,They get 0stars from me there was a bug in my food pregnant and hungry so not the business
Crazy G.,"Newton, IL",2,117,284,1.0,2/13/2015,Pretty busy.  Not enough staff.  Manager does not look to bright.   Waited 20 min for a drink.  Server we have is nice.  Don't franchise places ever get checked on?
Chris H.,"Hinesville, GA",5,7,1,3.0,7/9/2013,"What's there to say, but that it is Applebee's! Spinach and Artichoke dip could use some work. The steak was cooked right and it came to the table sizzling, which is awesome! We had a new server, and she did a decent job. We got the 2 for $24 and it was a good bargain. Food came out quickly. Overall not bad. Better than most places in Hinesville!"
Dawni C.,"Centralia, MO",35,60,36,1.0,12/5/2014,"Been here twice and the food is well below par for what Applebee's should b. My current server is very personable and keeps our drinks full, but the food was unfavorable. The kiwi lemonade is excellent, but I need a little bit more to get me back thru the doors!"
Norman H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,2/15/2016,This is the worst Applebee's I have ever been crappy service and they take forever on the food. I order online and it says to pick at 737 I go at 745 still not ready I get me food dam near an hour later and still had to pay for it. Wow!!!!! Keep up the good work people you guys are doing great
Ronald M.,"Fort Hood, TX",217,50,26,1.0,11/1/2014,"Menus sucks, service sucks, food sucked. Sat down and it took 30mins for someone to come help me. If you don't sit at the bar don't expect to order any drinks because they will forget or take 30mins to bring them out. I ordered chicken Alfredo and there was 3 pieces of chopped up chicken and took them 10mins after my food arrived to bring me my breadstick. Better off with chilis!"
David H.,"Fort Mitchell, AL",5,38,6,1.0,4/16/2013,The manager needs to ensure that he restaurant is clean!
