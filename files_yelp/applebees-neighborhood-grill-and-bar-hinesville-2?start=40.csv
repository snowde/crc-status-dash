Shannon L.,"Lutz, FL",1,6,,4.0,10/4/2014,"Four stars because of our awesome service today! Very attentive and friendly. Not really much to offer in the Hinesville area, and none of the food really amazes me, but it's consistent and of course the drinks are usually on point. One of the better restaurants around Hinesville."
Stephanie M.,"Hinesville, GA",0,2,,1.0,11/11/2014,"Don't waste your time or money. This  place is not worth either. The food is not fresh and it seems like they don't care if it's prepared properly. They gave my one year old runny old yogurt with barely,one whole strawberry. Needless to say I didn't let her eat it. We won't be coming back."
Sienna B.,"Hinesville, GA",1,6,,4.0,8/3/2013,"Hubby & I have been here a few times now, and I have to say, it's the best Applebee's I've been to. Previous experiences at other restaurants in this chain have been absolutely horrid - mostly substandard customer service and orders coming out wrong, cold, or both. We were reluctant to try this particular Applebee's out for that reason, but I have to say I've had pleasant experiences each time here in Hinesville. Waitresses have all been friendly - last time, my husband was happy to have ours wait for him to cut his steak in order to insure it had been cooked to order. Service has been prompt, but we've also never been there at peak dinner hours. My husband is a big fan of the Bourbon Street steak, and we both recommend the green bean crispers & brew pub pretzels. I also am a fan of the California shrimp salad. Nice job, Hinesville Applebee's. We'll be back."
Marcy C.,"Fort Stewart, GA",2,5,2,1.0,9/25/2015,We've tried eating here a few times and it's always so disappointing and gross. The car to go service is disappointing too.. Last week we waited and waited and finally went in and the employee was just sitting there doing nothing and our food was just sitting on the counter and it was pretty cold when we got home.
Jonathan G.,"Augusta, GA",68,35,31,2.0,3/12/2014,"Not a good experience this time.  The waitress was awesome!  The food was horrible!  I ordered the Roma Peppered Steak and instead of looking like it came off the grill medium rare like I asked and showed on the menu, it looked and tasted like a well done microwaved steak.  Yes, there are those of us who know what microwaved steak looks and tastes like.  The roasted potatoes were undercooked, and the Artichoke Mushroom Cap was watery and bland.  The best part was when I asked for a to go cup for my drink, I received a small coffee cup :/.  I do not like writing bad reviews and this may be good for the locals, but keep in mind the crowd that comes to town on business.  Honest reviews help a business succeed and I will not go to this Applebee's again when I travel here, ever!"
James C.,"Hinesville, GA",9,5,1,1.0,9/8/2013,"Poor service with substandard food equals meh!! Im all about customer service, and funny thing is that most applebees in Georgia are less hospitable than in South Carolina. It seems that complaints dont do anything unless you speak about it online!!"
Farrel P.,"Stuart, FL",0,30,,3.0,12/27/2014,"It's a chain so pretty typical, but I have to give a thumbs up to the chicken wonton tacos. Very different, nice spice on the chicken. Not a huge fan of chains but would order this again. Good job Applebee's! And the happy hour pricing makes it even better"
Alan G.,"Hinesville, GA",0,7,4,2.0,8/16/2013,"Have eaten at this Applebee's twice while here on business and both times were less than acceptable.  Poor service, overcooked food, and over spiced.  From arrival and sit down, poor service, we had to wait more than we should have for drinks, to order, and to get our check.  Came the second time to give them the benefit of the doubt, well, it was not good either.  Will not go here again!!!"
Margarita B.,"Tyler, TX",4,25,10,2.0,1/15/2014,Worst service st at the bar for 7 min before the bartender even asked if everything was ok. When I asked for food menu she rolled her eyes ... Seriously!!! Just find another job chick!!
Nathan R.,"Hinesville, GA",52,12,10,3.0,7/13/2012,"It's Applebee's what can you say.  The food is good, the drinks are good ( order the Margarita's ..they let you have the whole shaker so its like a 2 for 1 ) the staff was very friendly and nice !"
Kelly V.,"Sacramento, CA",32,10,1,1.0,9/6/2013,Service during lunch was sorely lacking. Light fixtures still dirty as shown in someone else's picture. The table was still sticky when we were seated.   Food was okay but certainly nothing special.
Derrick S.,"Edgewater, Miami, FL",122,272,707,1.0,11/8/2012,"Absolutely the worst service ever. The lay who works as assistant manger probably would not work in a major market Applebee's her customer service was the absolute worse, they messed our order 3 times and all she could say was sorry- It has taken me 3 months to get around to write this because I had to leave the area and had my hands full with work- The service the manager THE MANAGEMENT provided was the worse ever and I need to follow up with a call to corporate so they can weigh in."
Daniel R.,"Hinesville, GA",0,3,,1.0,12/14/2014,"I last time I went which about 4 months ago, I sat there for about 30 min. waiting for a waitress to come over and take my order. 4 other ladies in an adjacent booth were there before me and they to were waiting. I finally just got up and left."
Stephen M.,"Savannah, GA",0,1,,4.0,11/2/2013,"Great food, great friends. The business is on the main drag here in Hinesville. The management is very positive and the service is great!"
Lisa B.,"Lathrop, CA",0,17,,1.0,4/3/2014,"The food here made me want to vomit.  My  husband and I came here because it was right next to our hotel.  We went for lunch and was surprised that it wasn't very busy although we found out why.  Our waitress came to take drinks first and informed us that they were completely out of all of their lemonade and special lemonade flavors.  That was an initial disappointment as we both were going to order a flavored lemonade.  My husband ordered Pepsi and I ordered Raspberry Iced Tea.  My husband was given a Cherry Pepsi and I was given a Sweet Tea.  He sent his back, I just didn't really drink mine.  We ordered the sampler appetizer with steak quesadilla towers, hot wings, and mozzarella sticks.  Their was no steak in the towers it was simply hamburger meat and disgusting.  The hot wings had a less than appetizing not hot sauce.  The mozzarella sticks were about the only thing we enjoyed from the trio and they were not very hot, tasted like frozen mozzarella sticks you buy from the grocery store and microwave.  So after the appetizer went mostly uneaten we got our food.  I'll start with my husbands, he ordered the 4-cheese mac and cheese with honey pepper chicken tenders.  The chicken tenders were more of the size of the wings not that it mattered.  My husband tried a bite of the tenders, awful!  My husband tried a bite of the Mac and Cheese, awful!  My husband tried a bite of the bread stick, awful!  How do you mess up bread sticks?  He couldn't even choke down his food, it just stayed there uneaten.  I had ordered the Turkey, Bacon & Avocado sandwich with french fries.  Sounds delicious, right?  Wrong!  First of all I am pregnant and cannot eat cold deli meats they need to be heated, so what a disappointment it was that the Turkey and Bacon were straight out of the fridge and onto the bread.  Who in the world wants cold bacon?  The sandwich had two tiny slivers of avocado on it, not enough to have avocado in the name.  The ciabatta bread was the only thing I ate from the sandwich.  For the most part my husband and I just filled up on the french fries because they were the only that actually tasted good.  The funny thing is the manager comes around to make sure everything is going ok, although she came before we got our food, drinks or even really experience the restaurant yet.  Then you never see her again.   I will never in my life eat here again, huge waste of money since we literally spent $40+ on food we didn't eat.  Probably won't eat at another Applebee's again either just to avoid another experience like this."
Nancy H.,"Port St Lucie, FL",2,23,,3.0,6/30/2012,I am traveling to Jersey from Florida and stayed over night in Hinesville Ga .  Had dinner at Applebee's right in front of our hotel.  We sat at the bar and were greeted right away by bartender Lily.  Order our drink and she ask us for I.D.  I'm 60 years old and my husband is 62.  How about a little common sense!  Lily said it's company policy.  'Maybe Applebee's  needs to change that!  I.D. Up to 30 maybe but everyone???  On a positive note Lily was very friendly and helped me order my food ( dieting need healthy choices). Dinner was excellent and very healthy.  Thanks Applebee's for the weight watchers choices.
Paul W.,"Fort Hood, TX",8,3,,3.0,10/11/2013,"The Applebee's is just as good as any other, minus the one in Killeen. The atmosphere is very friendly as one would expect. Since it is close to a military base you should expect to see a lot of soldiers. The service is ok, the it can really slow during dinner rush. My waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed but she did her best. In the end if you like Applebee's then you already know what you are in for."
Erica K.,"Fort Gordon, GA",0,8,,2.0,7/16/2013,Food was regular Applebees menu and standard. Drinks were well made whenever you could finally get one. Service was absolutely substandard. I acn go to other chain restaurants for that level of food/drinks and would not return here because of the service.
Rick I.,"Wahiawa, HI",121,25,11,2.0,10/18/2012,"Ive been to other applebees in other cities and this is the worst one. Their nachos and dip are microwaved, some of the appetzers are premade elsewhere and just heated up there. I found this out when I asked for no peppers in my steak quesadilla towers. There are other big chain restaurants in Hinesville that are much better than here"
C J.,"Round Rock, TX",1,24,6,2.0,7/11/2014,"Good enough for lunch, but it was soup and sandwich, so how hard is that? Still, OK, not great or even good really. Dinner was very slow, and I was a single order, not even a group. All the wait and the steak was gray AND overcooked, obviously had been on a not-hot-enough grill and then under the salamander. I wasn't alone. Everyone had slow kitchen service. The waitress was fabulous. The girls at the bar, equally so. It was clean and I had high hopes. It was just the kitchen that ruined the day. This was my 3rd time here, and it was at least consistent."
