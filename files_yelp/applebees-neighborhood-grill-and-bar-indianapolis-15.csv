Chandra L.,"Indianapolis, IN",58,15,17,2.0,5/26/2016,"Stepped in today because I absolutely love the grilled chicken won ton tacos. But was horribly let down by my service.  My friend & I walked in and even tho the restaurant was basically empty, we stood at the door for 5 min before being seated.  Once at the table we waited another 5 min for someone to take our order.  When our server, Clarice came to the table she wasn't very friendly. She never came to check on us and in the middle of our meal she placed two Togo containers on the table without saying a word to us.  I love my won ton tacos so I can't give up Applebee's all together but I will not come back to this particular location."
Kristen B.,"Indianapolis, IN",52,47,51,1.0,4/18/2017,"Stopped in on a Friday night recently & even though the place was far from full (not even half capacity), I was notified there'd be a 30-40 minute wait. No explanation, no attempt at being pleasant, just made to feel it was in my best interest to leave. There's too many actual great restaurants in Indianapolis to tolerate the poor customer service at this one."
Daniel S.,"Mile Square, Indianapolis, IN",87,1,,1.0,9/11/2017,"I don't really ever leave reviews but I wanted to share that my experience was akin to those others who have left reviews for this particular Applebees. My girlfriend, child, parent's and I were greeted by an employee with a mouth full of food. After being seated she took a drink order and then immediately forgot it twice, before even leaving the table. The language used through our exchanges during our experience wasn't necessarily inappropriate, but it was definitely unprofessional. The food was good as expected. We had chosen the restaurant because the child is a picky eater, but the service was very low quality. While the employees were friendly, the experience was nothing like I expect at a restaurant."
Terry K.,"Louisville, KY",267,22,3,1.0,5/10/2017,I was on the way back from Chicago and it has been a long day. I just wanted to stop and sit down and eat. I know it's applebees but at this point I'll make a concession. I came in the door and waited at the front for about 3 minutes. No hostess. No staff contact. I was not engaged. I went to the bathroom in the back and walked back up front. There were 14 people in the restaurant. It was 10:16 pm so it wasn't busy and they are open til midnight. After standing for another 4 minutes up front I just sat down in the closet open area hoping I could be seen. Still no contact. I only seen to waitstaff. No one engaged me still. I left. No excuse to have someone sit in your store for 15 minutes without any contact.
Ntianu S.,"Indianapolis, IN",282,423,941,2.0,11/7/2014,"Call me a food snob if you must, but Indy has too many incredible restaurants to patronize yet another typical dull uninspired chain restaurant where the beer of the month is Miller Lite. Seriously?!?  Although the service was great, the food was meh. I ordered the chicken fingers platter which basically looked like something I would order at Arby's. SUCH a disappointment. My bf enjoyed his quesadilla burger. This place is just not worth the visit. Ugh!"
Nick A.,"Westchase, Houston, TX",0,5,2,2.0,6/6/2016,Let me start by saying I've never really been a fan of Applebee's BUT when I came with my mom I tried the salmon and it was delicious !!!!!! My moms experience however not so much lol and I say that because she's the one who convinced me to come. She ordered a steak and the quality was just not good nor was the strawberry lemonade. All in all she won't be back but I might
J J.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,2,,1.0,5/23/2016,"After waiting more than a hour, our food was cold I'm not exaggerating.  From 5:15to 6:55 we weren't offered any refills for our empty glasses. The manager only offered to cook our food  again but couldn't understand that it would be unreasonable for us to wait that long to eat. I also had children that had school the next day. I think the server was polite but that was unacceptable."
Katie N.,"Indianapolis, IN",1,6,4,1.0,4/23/2015,"Sat at the table for 8 minutes before being greeted by my server. She asked for our drinks then our order. Correct if I'm wrong but I think that I should be greeted, told the specials, asked for my drink then given a couple minutes to look over the menu. It took her 7 minutes to bring out our drink after taking the drink order because she was standing at the computer right next to us texting. A little frustrating. Then she finally comes back with our drinks and asks for our order. She dropped our food off and never came back. I had to wait til someone, anyone that worked here, to walk by to ask for something and my food got cold. We then wanted dessert and we had to order it from the computer on the table rather than from our server because she was too busy standing in the bar with a group of other employees talking and being extremely loud and obnoxious.  I've never had service this horrible in my life."
Robbie R.,"Indianapolis, IN",134,158,78,2.0,4/28/2014,Since we work a couple blocks away we get Applebees once a month or so and the food is usually the pretty decent fare that you expect from Applebees.  However today I ordered a wedge salad that was so small I had to go to McDonalds after I ate it because I was still hungry.  I posted a pic so you can see what I mean.  I had the exact same salad at the Applebees Saturday night and it was twice the size.  It was so good that I have been thinking about it since so I ordered it today.  With all the other options that we have for lunch in the Lafayette Square area I think I will be skipping Applebees from now on.
Taylor W.,"Indianapolis, IN",77,4,4,1.0,12/10/2015,Good food. Service was poor and slow. There was only 2 other tables in the restaurant with customers. So they weren't busy. Food should of been fast. Waitress rarely checked up on us and wasn't friendly. Didn't give us straws for our drinks. And never asked if we needed refills. Took a total of 1 and a half hours from arrival to leaving.  Not a pleasant experience.
Cyd L.,"Indianapolis, IN",2,23,11,5.0,8/8/2015,I love this Applebee's they are like family. They are really friendly. Don't understand the bad rep. My kids enjoy the new menu with bigger serving choices. My parents always order the cowboy burger and I adore the double barrel whiskey steaks.
HM P.,"Gregory, MI",44,15,8,1.0,8/18/2015,"Horrible experience... We should have just walked out, when we were greeted by a grumpy bear!  Poor service and mediocre food made our time there 8/17/15 @ 8:48pm horrible.  It was Monday night burger special. $6.99 for these premium burger... Ha!  The food was sloppy and the appetizer Won Ton Tacos were cold and short with toppings.  No limes also!  Employees not happy and complaints heard from the kitchen and prep area.  They should all be replaced! No customer should ever have to experience this from such a large and credible franchise. This didn't even deserve 1 star!!!"
Kandice T.,"Indianapolis, IN",23,25,7,1.0,3/9/2016,"The food is mediocre at best, and for two weeks in a row I've gone here in a pinch.  The first visit was terrible.  We were neglected while the server tried to straighten things out with the table next to us who had also received crappy service, apparently!  On our second visit, I told the hostess about my previous experience, and asked her to sit us in an experienced server's area.  I accepted a table rather than a booth in order to get the experienced server.  For over 5 minutes we sat there waiting to be acknowledged.  A female server walked back and forth passing us several times while I tried tirelessly to make eye contact or otherwise get her attention.  I still don't know if she was the ""experienced server"" that was appointed to take care of us, because finally, we just got up and left.  The TGI Friday's down the street was much busier, and still provided much better service, and tastier food!  I was happy to have left!"
Mindy L.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,7,,1.0,12/19/2014,"Went to this Applebee's tonight at about 1130pm. It had a fair amount of people in it but was not as busy as I have seen many other applebees. We have been to this peticular applebees many times over the years and have had few issues ...until tonight. When we walked in no one greeted us, we wanted to sit in the bar and have been told many times to just go ahead and sit so,  we did.  The manager was behind the bar yet once again we were ignored.  The bar was not full of people at least 6 seats were empty. The manager after a while left the inside of the bar and stood against the wall with 3 servers.  We sat for 8 minutes waiting to be at least acknowledged and got nothing. Then finally my husband hears the manager complaining to the servers about us sitting there. Loud enough for us to hear. Needless to say we   seemed that there may not have been a bartender on duty. If she or someone would have at least acknowledged us and explained the situation we would have accommodated them. Instead we got nothing but rudeness. We are now in tgifridays and getting friendly good service. Doubt we will go back to this applebees until at least new manager is in place."
Charlie C.,"Gurnee, IL",0,8,,2.0,12/31/2014,"The place was not busy at all when we got there around two pm. The floors were dirty and the bathrooms were horrible. However, customer service is good and food was ok."
Nancy K.,"East Lansing, MI",16,103,7,3.0,12/18/2012,"Okay, I am generally not a franchise fan (says the Starbucks addict) but at least you know what you are getting. This particular restaurant has always done me well. The food has been hot and as ordered. The drinks have been delicious. The service has been good. It's my go to place at lunch when I don't feel like anything else, and I don't want to be disappointed."
