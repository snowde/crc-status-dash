Sarah A.,"Indianapolis, IN",121,5,2,5.0,11/29/2017,"I just had dinner here tonight with my parents and it was definitely a good experience! When we came in we were seated right away and the server came within just a few minutes to take our drink orders. We were a little indecisive, so she gave us time to decide and then promptly took our orders. I had the BBQ Brisket Tacos, which came with fries, and they were deeelicious! The tacos (3) were served in soft flour tortillas and consisted of the shredded barbecued brisket, which was  tender, juicy and flavorful, and cheddar cheese, crispy onions, Mexi-ranch dressing, Texas BBQ sauce, and pico de gallo. This was not the first time I had had them, and I think they are becoming somewhat of a ""go to"" when  I don't know what to get! The fries were tasty and a good combination of crunchy and soft--although maybe a little on the over-salted side. Our server was friendly and attentive but not overbearing, checking on us occasionally and coming back to refill our drinks. I had not been to this location but I have never had a bad experience at any other Applebees and this one did not disappoint. I will definitely be back."
Shayla N.,"Indianapolis, IN",53,8,4,2.0,1/7/2018,"Went last night. We were seated promptly along with another table by the hostess. We sat for 15 min with no server greeting us. They just kept walking by. So I asked to speak with a manager. Then all of a sudden s server appears to take our drink order. The server was great, fast, and apologized for us waiting so long. This tells me they knew what the problem was. Someone knew we were waiting longer than we should have and someone sent him to us. Although he was great and apologized, a manger never came to our table as requested. The worst part is after the fact, I read the reviews and I see this has happened often at this location."
Penny R.,"Indianapolis, IN",131,87,63,5.0,1/27/2017,I met my sorority sister here for the start of my birthday weekend.  She was already here and met me with a drink. We ordered the two for 20 lunch special. We had a spinach dip for the appetizer and it was great. Our meals came out very timely. Our server was very attentive and was by frequently to fill our waters and address Our needs.  The manager even came by to check on us. This was a great experience
Christopher F.,"Indianapolis, IN",392,93,56,4.0,3/15/2017,"I feel like I just walked into my southern Mamma's house. I was called honey, sweetie, darling and a host of other enduring surnames. I called in a to-go order. I was put on hold but apologized to for said hold when she returned to the phone. My food was timely; ready when promised. I had the 4 cheese pasta. Seems pretty expensive for the little amount you actually get but it was delicious. While waiting I did get to hear some intriguing server discussions about guests in the restaurant and their wants/needs. Note to ya'll: someone is always listening. See you again soon sugar pie!"
Ej F.,"Indianapolis, IN",1,18,,1.0,9/29/2017,"Ghetto! Friday night in the hood! After standing for 5 minutes we got seated. We got to walk past about a dozen tables before they found one that didn't need cleaned off...totally disgusting! Thank GOD we got to order from the tablet on the table, I am sure waiting for a waitress would of been a while! If it's close to the ghetto it's gonna be a ghetto experience!"
Michelle A.,"Indianapolis, IN",31,4,,1.0,10/22/2017,Unfortunately poor customer service. Also they put you on hold until you finally hang up when ordering curbside to go.
Craig W.,"Indianapolis, IN",217,3,,1.0,6/29/2017,"Went in tonight because I was craving some chicken wonton tacos, they were good, as usual. Ordered the fish and chips as my entree and once it arrived I went to cut into the fried fish and it wouldn't cut with my fork. I tried again with the same result. Started to pick at the fish with my fork and noticed that beneath the batter it was totally grey skin and very rubbery, scarcely any white meat on the fish at all. I immediately lost my appetite and sent it back. The manager and the GM comped the cost of the meal but I felt like very little was done to rectify the situation. Needless to say I won't ever be eating at this place again."
Justina W.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,5,2,2.0,7/1/2017,"On 6/29/17 ordered pick up from Pendleton Pike location.  $56.00 + $10.00 tip. When we got back home,  we were short one whole dinner.  Called back, talked to the manager.  She said she packed our order personally and she knew it was in there.  Pretty much calling me a liar. I asked if she could just take it off my card, she said no.  So we had to go back to pick up the omitted entree. She said she would give us coupons for the inconvenience.  When we got there, a young woman brought the order to our car.  We asked for the coupon and she said ""the manager said you're already getting a free meal, so you don't get a coupon"". The worst customer service ever.  The manager needs management training. She also needs to be taught how to count because we ordered 4 meals and only got 3. Went back to get the 4 th, but we're accused of getting a""free"" meal. The food was good, but the service sucked!"
Libby M.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,1,,1.0,11/18/2016,"Ordered the crispy brew house chicken. In a word-awful! It was a weird texture, rubbery and tasteless. I returned it for a burger, it was too salty to eat. The manager took the chicken off the bill, but only half of the burger. Won't be back, I'd advise NOT to go here."
C S.,"Indianapolis, IN",10,9,2,1.0,1/14/2017,Dinner here last night was the worst experience out of many here.  Our food was cold and lacked flavor.  Our meal was paid by a gift card from someone never wanting to go back if that tells you something.  Years ago it wasn't too bad but not my go to place.  Waitress didn't bother asking how our meal was when she did come by our table. Hoping better options move to the area or I guess we'll be eating at home.
Keshia C.,"Indianapolis, IN",79,96,186,3.0,6/11/2016,"The Applebee's located on Pendleton Pike generally has really good food.  The restaurant is always clean when we are there and the servers are average.  For this particular trip we ordered dinner on line and picked up curbside.  The on line ordering process was pretty easy.  In fact, a little better because they list everything included in the meal and give you the option to remove something you don't like. So it is pretty easy to remember to have those items you don't like removed before it is prepared.  We had a pick up of about 6:30 pm and the meal was delivered to our car around 6:45.  The chicken and salad was well prepared.  Everything else was sub par and pretty much just thrown together with little attention to the meal or presentation of the meal.  The sides were quite a bit smaller than if we would have just dined in.  We are likely to go back but probably would not order curb side again."
Richard P.,"Indianapolis, IN",256,535,122,3.0,7/27/2014,"After a rough morning, I found myself wanting to have a quiet meal and read my Sunday newspaper. Applebee's used to be one of my favorite restaurants, a place that I could go hang out with friends and not feel pressured to rush through my meal. I'm not quite sure when the atmosphere shifted at Applebee's, but over the last few years I've noticed that it has more of a ""corporate"" feel and less of a ""neighborhood"" feel to it. While I don't exactly feel rushed, I've noticed that if you actually get two drink refills you start getting a ""it's time for you to go"" vibe. I've gone to Applebee's a few times with friends over the past couple years, and almost without exception that feeling of being able to just hang out is gone.  Today, I was in the mood for a casual meal, comfort food, and a less busy atmosphere so I checked out this location. I actually drove around quite a bit before settling on Applebee's, but ultimately it just really sounded good.  I've never frequented this location as I tend to prefer the Broad Ripple area location, but this was closer to where I was running some errands and I decided to give it a chance. I was disappointed to see that all the wheelchair accessible parking spots were taken and I ended up having to park on the other side of the restaurant and wheel around to the wheelchair ramp. That said, I was greeted at the door by the hostess and that sure made things better. I was seated promptly at a table that gave my wheelchair lots of room. My server, whose name I've completely spaced, got to me in a decent amount of time and I was ready with my order when she arrived. The food, which was only a cheeseburger w/fries and an iced tea, took a bit longer than I expected but it wasn't unreasonable.  The food was good and the burger was prepared ""no pink"" as I'd requested. As much as I'm trying to eat healthier and Applebee's does have Weight Watchers friendly fare, I'm a big fan of their burgers and can never seem to divert my attention to their low-fat items. That said, this particular meal wasn't quite as good as usual. It wasn't bad and it certainly wasn't anything I'd send back, but it just lacked the usual Applebee's flair that justifies the fact you're paying about double what you'd pay for a fast food burger. In fact, I kept thinking that for five bucks less I could have had a better burger at Steak n' Shake across the street.  My visit was really just about the definition of slightly above average. The food was good, but not great. The service was good, but not great. The atmosphere was a bit busier than I'd hoped, but I was certainly able to read my newspaper. I did have to ask for even one refill, but I will say that at least the server came back a couple times.  If I could, I'd probably go with 3 1/2 stars here. It simply wasn't a 4-star experience and 3-stars does feel a tad low. However, given that it wasn't up to my usual experience at Applebee's I have to stick with the 3."
Sabbir O.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,15,,1.0,1/30/2016,Honestly the worst apple bees experience in my life my stomach still hurts and it's day three the servers throw any trash inside the cups after customers leave ( filthy af) you'll notice an old lady always arguing with the servers about her tips in front of everyone which is pretty embarrassing.. Apart from that food is served in silver run pans for some appetizers.. Pretty weird never saw that in any other apple bees. I've been to many Applebee's my entire life and this by far was the worst one.. The server that took care of me and my table said she was tired which is why she didn't serve us all enthusiastic and not in a grumpy mood .. Why are you working that late then lol AVOID IF POSSIBLE I might have food poisoning praying I don't
Jake R.,"Memphis, TN",4,173,72,5.0,6/13/2015,"So Applebee's... Not generally your main go to place. I mean the food is okay, but it's pretty mainstream.  But as far as Applebee's goes this was probably the best one I've been too. The food was excellent, the server Alexia was awesome. She took care of business, made sure we had drinks, got out food out to us hot and fresh. She made sure we didn't need anything, but didn't bug is every five minutes. The prefect balance in a server. So if you want Applebee's and great service make sure you get her section."
Luppie A.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,1,,1.0,5/22/2016,Came in on sunday 5/22/16 was going to have dinner but service sucked so bad decided to go elsewhere. Was not even busy.  Now i remember why i dont go to applebees!!
Tressa M.,"Indianapolis, IN",5,27,,2.0,6/17/2015,"We stopped in at this Applebee's prior to going to basketball practice near by.  In hopes of getting a decent meal on a real plate, vs Buffalo Wild Wings and our food being served in a basket.   We had a new server and she was friendly and that is why they are getting  2 stars, rather than 1 star.  My sons dinner was in fact served on a tin plate, with paper under it.  Our bill was incorrect and the food was average.  Perhaps, because I frequent locally owned restaurants, not chains, I am a bit more critical than the average customer.  They really did not give me a reason to return."
Derek S.,"Greenfield, IN",29,29,,4.0,12/22/2014,I'm impressed....We had giving up on Applebees in our hometown due to multiple issues. This location has restored our faith in the brand. The new menu is great and burgers are awesome. The service has been exceptional as well. We will continue to drive 30 min out of our way just to visit this location.
Lindsey M.,"Pendleton, IN",0,4,1,2.0,10/13/2013,The food is not worth the price. Ultimate trio is a rip off. The steak quesadilla towers were so small!
Kylee B.,"Noblesville, IN",6,17,35,4.0,6/22/2014,This place has been full every time I have visited in the past year. Staff is a hit or miss - same with every other place. Food has never disappointed.
Debbie C.,"Chicago, IL",6,2,,5.0,9/1/2014,"Went in for a late night dinner and drink after a hectic day at work. Natalie, the bartender was awesome ! Kept us laughing the whole time, was very friendly and did everything she possibly could to make us have a great meal. I suggest taking a seat at the bar and have Natalie help you out."
Rahul P.,"Highland Park, IL",15,2,,5.0,12/18/2011,"I've never been to an Applebee's before but we decided to give it a try after walking into the Buffalo Wild Wings next door. At the B-Dubs there was no one there to greet us at the door, nor was the staff excited to serve us. We left before even sitting down. Natalie, our server, brought it. She was energetic, polite and had a good knowledge of the menu. We were very surprised how good the food was - we ordered buffalo wings, fish and chips and chicken alfredo.  Everything was GREAT, this definitely won't be the one and only time I step into an Applebee's."
Marcus H.,"Buckhead, Atlanta, GA",19,2,,2.0,2/11/2014,"Came in on a Monday night during a fairly busy night. Was sat down immediately by the host, but was not helped for 10+ mins. Server was very unfriendly, and was not attentive. Food did come out really quickly, and was pretty good, yet the fries were cold. Never asked if our food was ok, or if we wanted a second drink. Not happy at all with this service."
Nicholas B.,"Indianapolis, IN",4,1,,4.0,2/19/2014,"My review is based on overall Applebee's experiences in the past and how this one stacked up. It's pretty busy with the exception being during the day, but the service and food were great. I ordered the build your own trio and it was as advertised when I picked wanton tacos, quesadilla towers, and wings. This is a good Applebee's compared to most and I will be visiting again."
