Robert G.,"Indio, CA",88,73,117,4.0,8/12/2017,Update!!!!!  Even a few months after my first few experiences here they only get more welcoming. I came on a Saturday night and we got sat right away in a kind of romantic corner lol jk. It was very relaxed with low lighting which was welcoming and our server was a great ice breaker making us feel even more welcomed. I usually get the artichoke and mozzarella sticks munch on while I enjoy a drink (very rare). The blue Hawaii was a bit strong but then again I drink no more than 7 days a year so everything taste strong to me.  This time the food came faster to us and was a little cold so they may have pre made the food a little to early. Minus one star for that. If I was buzzed it would have been okay but I wasn't yet Thank Tara for the welcoming vibe and hospitality.
Joe D.,"Thermal, CA",7,65,1,5.0,8/10/2017,"First visit during lunch.  Great waitet, fast service. We were a group everyone very pleased with service, food and prices.  Good place to eat if you are on jury duty. Senior and other specials on Wednesday."
Lisa L.,"Indio, CA",1,7,1,5.0,12/6/2017,"Came here with the family for dinner, and had a very good experience. The hostess Audrey was very friendly and quick to seat us. Our waiter Marcus was very friendly knowledgeable of the menu and came back at the right time to check if we needed anything. And got us what we needed very promptly and had a very good attitude... the food was excellent. we would definitely return"
Sarah W.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,7,,5.0,1/5/2018,"We had given up on Applebee's about three years ago when our Rancho San Diego location changed to the new menu and their service went downhill.  Tonight, we were hungry for the steaks advertised on tv, so gave this location a try.  Wow!  Loved both the food and the amazing service from Brenda.  The steaks were just as good as advertised!  We'll be back!"
Mariana C.,"Goleta, CA",0,8,,2.0,1/2/2018,"Got seated very quickly. Nice and friendly atmosphere. Server was nice. The food took about 45min for a pasta dish, basic burger, and fish & chips. The burger was slightly undercooked even though we asked for fully cooked patty so we only could eat half. Pasta was good & fish & chips were ok, nothing special. Considering the price of the plates and the food quality I would say it was overpriced. The strawberry lemonade was yummy with real fruit. Not amazed by this place and probably would not return. While the ambiance was nice it was not enough to make up for the meh food which left us a bit undersatisfied. I would rather go to a place with good food and mediocre service than poor food and ok service."
Javier M.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",34,349,5,3.0,6/27/2017,"Hey, if you want to escape the HEAT during your lunch break from the court, this place will qualify. The service at first was a bit slow. Then, things picked up and I was able to order a Grilled Chicken Caesar Wrap and a Sam Adams. The pricing for the return on quality was steep. They also had tons of TV's but they were all playing replays of past events. I'd rather watch cartoons or CNN in lieu of that garbage.  The restroom was clean enough and the proximity for an afternoon trial was the best part. EXCEPT for that COLD BEER! I will make my way down to Huerta's next time."
Anthony M.,"Indio, CA",0,13,13,3.0,12/29/2017,Was told by manager no wait had to wait almost 20 minutes but staff was quick and curtias getting me and my wife are seat
Ryan C.,"Coachella, CA",3,3,,1.0,12/3/2017,Went here with my family of three on 12/2/17 and I don't think I could have been more disappointed. The service was slow (they were not really busy when we arrived) our server seemed like it was a bother to do her job. The food was over cooked and rubbery. Don't waste your money on this place. It's better to just go to Red Robin.
Brandais H.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/2/2017,"This is probably the worst s in the valley. Went 12.03.17 for the $1.00 long island ice tea & happy hour. It wasn't busy at all! Literally 8 to 10 tables in the whole restaurant! Got sat for 2 & didn't get waited on until 10 minutes after out arrival. I was ready to get up & go to another location but by the time I would have got to the one in Palm Desert the happy hour would have been over. As we were waiting the servers were just standing around talking and one, who ended up being our server, went out of her way to mention that she was supposed to be on break & that's why it took so long for us to be greeted. I didn't leave a tip I was so upset. I'm a server so I know the drill. I will NEVER return to this location again... HORRIBLE"
X. S.,"Coachella, CA",0,6,,3.0,9/24/2017,"Out of all the Applebee's in the valley this would have to be my least favorite. I have given it a few chances but the majority of the time they end up disappointing me, they take waay to long to have you're food ready. I really hope they can improve on this."
Marilyn A.,"Indio, CA",53,16,9,1.0,1/27/2017,"Currently here.. Came over right after work craving some double crunch wings. Placed three orders of wings, to me & my friends disappointment bartender comes back saying they're all out.. Then she stated ""We usually run out of wings on Fridays""  Way to go management on placing your stock orders."
Shanna C.,"Indio, CA",0,11,,1.0,5/28/2017,"Car side to go order -$67 -  Cheese sticks - ok Cesear salad - no dressing Nachos - burnt, most of it inedible 2 of the Shrimp and 4oz Sirloin from Bold menu- shrimp was hard, as if over cooked.  4 oz sirloin turned out to be 2.4 oz, which when we called to inquire they said it's  because they weigh before cooked, however, no mention of that on website.  Manager mentioned it's like when you go to McDonalds and expect a big burger but they end up flat after it's cooked.  Comparing to McDonalds didn't help, especially since we don't eat there.  It's unfortunate that we thought we put our order in to the LQ Applebees but realized after the fact it was Indio.  Never had any of these problems with LQ.  Waste of money."
Christina Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,32,10,1.0,8/4/2017,"Service is so SLOW!!!!!! We got in around 9pm and we ordered shortly after. It's now 52 minutes later and my food is still not here. Not to mention Customer Service is NOT that great. We got seated pretty fast though. On the bright side, the only thing they remembered was my daughter's birthday."
Dixie V.,"Indio, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/2/2017,"Bad customer service! Decided to eat at Applebee's in Indio and was very upset with the lack of customer service. Walked in to no hostess to be seen anywhere; at least 10 minutes passed by until we were greeted. The hostess offered us a high table by the bar that was not even cleaned, she proceeded to make us wait again as she cleaned the table. We were informed that our waiter would be with us shortly but once again another 10 minutes or so passed by until our waiter finally appeared, food was good so that was one plus for them but overall lousy staff."
Sonia R.,"Indio, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/12/2017,Lousy service...how can a city make a difference we always get great service at the La Quinta store thought we'd try this one and it was a terrible experience.  We sat for almost 10 minutes until we approached the bartender and she tells us sorry the serves are on break...seriously??!!!
John L.,"Ontario, CA",84,14,14,1.0,7/21/2017,It started fine but then we waited 45 minutes for our tortilla soup & waitress was arguing with us that we didn't order. She didn't even bother to write down our orders; how are you supposed to recall the entire order omg.!
Lalo M.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/27/2017,Bad place went for my girlfriend birthday and the lady wanted us to sit next to other customers with no privacy. Then she tells us the bar is also open and clean so l decide to take my business somewhere else. Went the RedRobin down the street and good customer service with nice sitting. Don't waste your time going to that place.
Nelly S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,2,1.0,5/27/2017,We just walked in and the hostess didn't let us see where we wanted.   She gave us a option either a section next to the bar or the bar at 8:32 pm What kinda service is this?
Daniel O.,"Indio, CA",1,2,3,1.0,2/8/2017,"Every time i come to this applebees it's honestly a bad experience. I either get a wrong order, get my drinks very late, or never get any customer"
Tadera W.,"La Quinta, CA",3,2,,1.0,2/8/2017,Horrible customer service. I ordered my meal online. I waited for my order to be completed. I arrived to pick up my order and it hasn't even been sent to the kitchen yet. Im then told that it happens all the time with online orders like stop taking online orders if you can't get the system working properly.
Alex R.,"Indio, CA",80,20,13,1.0,6/4/2017,"Shout out to Mark for being one of the most non caring employees I have ever encountered since this Applebees in Indio opened. Kept getting annoyed at everything me and my friend were asking. No customer service whatsoever. Not coming back to this one again. Applebees in Rancho Mirage, La Quinta and even Palm Desert is so much better."
Robert M.,"Corona Del Mar, CA",1725,1258,47,3.0,8/31/2016,"Me and the family came here to spend a gift card I was given.   Decor:  As expected.  Overall, it has a somewhat strange layout, as it's mainly bar, which leads to some strange maneuvers to get around to a table in some areas.  I see the other bad reviews here, and please note that my experience, while not perfect, was certainly better than a one star experience.  A few points to note: Service:  Service, for a weekday evening, was very slow.  We were left alone for long stretches of time, especially when we got there and when we wanted to leave.  Luckily, the table top devices have games we could plan (which are generally lame, and some cost money - for 1991 level trivia games!).  If we could have ordered from the tabletop device and avoided having to wait for a server, that would have definitely made the experience better.  Applebees, I hope you're listening.  We appreciated that you could pay through the device, rather than wait for a server, but since we had a gift certificate, that didn't work for us.  Food:  Nothing exceptional here, but I actually liked the food.  Great portion sizes, great menu options, and since I have a picky 11 year old, I appreciate that there is food he likes here.  Would we come back?  There are better options around.  If you're only drinking, this might fit the bill."
Mayra O.,"Fullerton, CA",0,11,1,1.0,1/19/2017,"Worst service ever. My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary and we waited by the door for about 40 mins before the hostess acknowledged us. When she finally did acknowledge us, we waited another 20 mins to finally be seated. I will never return to this place."
Jose B.,"Ciudad Universitaria, Madrid, Spain",37,17,10,1.0,8/29/2016,Restaurant did not have a hostess when I arrived. I was standing waiting. I took a video and posted it on Yelp as well. In addition WiFi does not work properly . CONNECTION IS LIMITED. It needs new management fast.
Mabel R.,"Indio, CA",0,2,1,4.0,2/26/2017,"Half the restaurant is empty and it takes us twenty minutes to get seated. Just when I thought we were doomed Brett, our server saved the day! He should be the restaurant manager!"
Noemi A.,"Indio, CA",0,7,7,1.0,11/10/2016,"Wow. We were waiting for 40 minutes to be seated for a group of 15. The management does a Terrible job hosting large groups. Beware of this large groups. They could've at least told us that it wasn't going to be possible they had us waiting without warning us. We left to Denny's. They always treat us better. If I was the owner of this business, I would be upset I just loss business. I would start by getting new management. :("
Mitchell A.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,117,3,1.0,3/31/2016,When ordering I asked to make sure the food was not spicy they served me spicy food and the baked potato was cold.  Back to the kitchen and the napkins smelled like gasoline. Service was awful they shoved us in the back at a very tiny table. Coffee cold I don't recommend this establishment to anyone!
Chris C.,"Indio, CA",1,5,4,1.0,5/22/2016,"Lunch Wed May 18th. Only 2 girls(servers) working the entire place. This is when your manager needs to step up and help get them out of the weeds. Joey (Mr. Manager) was sitting in the office, he'd poke his head out from time to time, stand near bar look around and head back to his sanctuary. Never helped. A good manager helps and provides his staff where and when is needed. Not just writing the schedule, screwing up the schedule and sit in office while your staff is running and sweating. Happy employees = higher sales, cleaner facility, more tips, friendlier environment, return customers, employees willing to come in on their day off cause someone called in sick and Oh! Keeping Your Job Mr. Manager! 1 star for management  5 stars for girls playing the hand they got dealt!"
Cyndi O.,"Indio, CA",24,67,88,2.0,6/4/2015,"Poor food quality‼ Asked for the new chips, they are all over cooked w an aftertaste.  Asked for crisp bacon on my triple hog, server said its crispy, NOT We asked for the honey pepper dressing be put on the side & it wasn't. It's all over the chicken tenders making them to messy for an 88 y o woman to eat. She is halfway done & I SIT waiting for crisp bacon & homemade chips‼ All the silverware needed replacing. It all was filthy. New restaurant shud HAV a new machine & someone wiping them down. Very disappointed with Indio's store. Triple Hog Dare is NOT worth  $12.00 A ciabatta bun with a touch of BBQ sauce, 2 small thin slices of ham, 2 small pieces of bacon & a pile of onion straws‼ Triple⁉"
Wendy A.,"Indio, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/15/2017,"Had a gift card, so tried this restaurant. Next time will give away the card. Used car side to go, I got the egg burger, the yolk soaked burger had to be eaten with knife and fork. Missing fries with one order, the fries were cold and old, a lot of money for bad food."
Jose M.,"Coachella, CA",80,2,,1.0,3/27/2016,First time at this appleBees and just to tell you guys its the Worst applebees i ever been  Every slow service took about a hour to get or food and Plus when wanted our refills they said they will be right back took other 20min just to get us refills!!! I will never go there again this place is the worst !! Ill rather drive a bit more and head my self to la quinta applebees much better service over there  I dont recommend this place at all!!! It sucks
Its D.,"Palm Desert, CA",1,11,7,1.0,2/20/2016,The service is very low quality certain workers are rude; they think the customers should tip regardless of poor service. The problem stems from very poor management.
Peggy B.,"Sioux Falls, SD",5,92,26,2.0,1/8/2016,"The food was delicious.    The service was very poor and slow.   We waited over 1/2 hour to get our food.  When we ordered, we asked for extra salad dressing.   It did not come with the food and it took 10 minutes to finally get only 2.  There were 3 us  who requested it.  It took another delay to get more. Getting our bill took some more time. Overall it was a disappointment for the 5 of us."
Kathy J.,"Downey, CA",1,22,3,1.0,3/15/2017,"Ugh, so we decided to give it another shot! We arrived and stood there for minutes.....the waitresses would see us, even the manager saw us waiting (Night shift) but Nope didnt even bother to greet us. He just sat near the bar with his back towards us. The place wasnt even busy. This is the worst applebees ever. I regret even attempting to give them another shot.  Don't bother showing up"
Gilbert G.,"Indio, CA",117,4,,5.0,10/29/2016,"I'm surprised about all the bad reviews. I always enjoyed this particular Applebee's, always treated me great awesome service and yeah here and there they mess up but the manager always personally apologizes and makes up for it and I think hmm they are just humans not their faults things happen. Maybe because I go here regularly and I get greeted with smiles and a how's it going, but there's a reason why I go often because of them and their great service, foods always exceptional but I can go to any Applebee's for that nothing different about the food here and from the one across California it's the servers employees and bartenders. Keep up the great work you'll always have my Bussiness as long as I always have money in my pocket. And also no other place in the valley (believe me I tried) beats their damn happy hour!"
Karina P.,"Indio, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/15/2016,"Service and food quality here is terrible, I rather drive to a further location next time."
Krista M.,"Indio, CA",23,7,2,3.0,10/25/2016,"Went here with a group of friends last night for a going away party. First let me say our server was out standing if I was writing a review soley on her performance id give five stars! Very sweet, friendly, fast, checked on us through out the night and was very patient with our table of ten! I can't remember her name I believe it was holly... The reason I can't give five stars is because three of us ordered the Mac and cheese with chicken tenders and got horrible food poisoning (not just one of us all three of us!) must have been the chicken or bacon. Besides that the service is great, just be careful what you chose to eat"
Dulce T.,"Cathedral City, CA",2,37,76,5.0,11/20/2015,Excellent service!! My server Micheal was so polite and attentive!! I loved my sampler.. I asked for sirachia shrimp and beer bater pretzels.. Very filling for 9.00 I truly recommend them!!
Jennifer A.,"Coachella, CA",0,8,3,1.0,2/6/2017,"I've came here a couple times and every single time has been a bad experience, but I seem to always want to give them a second chance. Walking in you're supposed to wait for the hostess to seat you, however, no one ever seems to be at the front & you're waiting there for what seems to be forever! Other waiters & waitresses see you waiting but won't come up to you to at least say, ""someone will be right with you"" or something.... It seemed to me like all the employees were hiding out in the back, it was such a long wait to even get a drink.... Management really  needs to step it up!"
Gingerlin A.,"Indio, CA",29,4,1,5.0,4/9/2016,I had a great time at Applebee's i brought my family and they loved it. The service was wonderful thanks to Rian bar tender live the way he took care of us i am coming back again forsure.
