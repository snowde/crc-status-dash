Amanda T.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/6/2016,it's a good family restaurant  But the service is so bad I don't care what the employees do over the weekend. Will never go back to the Indio apple bees I'll stick to la quinta.
Esmeralda C.,"Coachella, CA",0,10,6,1.0,3/23/2017,"Went in today and was greeted by nobody. There were other people waiting to be seated as well. Finally got seated but everything took forever to arrive. When we got our spinach and artichoke dip every bite was cold /: Server tried his best but every time I come in, it is the same thing. Definitely prefer the LQ one more."
Joanne G.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/9/2016,The service was decent though you can tell they are well under staffed but the food really was horrible. Everything tasted as if it was frozen and reheated in the mucrowave. I had the half rack of ribs and not only were they cold but I couldn't even bite into it.
Mayra C.,"Coachella, CA",0,18,17,1.0,7/12/2015,"Food was good, service is poor. Our server brought us drink but someone different took our order.  Our appetizer came after our dinner and they were cold.  Once we told a manager, she asked if we wanted new ones, ones to go; ""or pretend this never happen"". NOT SURE WHAT THIS MEANT! N then never returned.  We like coming to Applebee's but DEFINITELY not coming to this one again."
Edgar R.,"Coachella, CA",0,35,13,3.0,4/8/2016,"I have visited this location probably shy of a dozen times since its inauguration. First and foremost the staff is great but it's not difficult to notice that most of the hosts and servers are new and lack experience in the food & beverage industry. Your visit at this location can either be absolutely terrific or a dull fully dreadful. On a couple occasions when asking for a platter with specific instructions, they where not fulfilled and had to be returned to the kitchen for correction. The prices are like any other Applebee's affordable and acceptable. I will probably review again in a couple months since I frequent this restaurant maybe 2-3 times a month. I feel once the staff is fully trained and situated this location will be able to offer the same service that Applebee's is known for."
Stephanie M.,"Coachella, CA",96,1,,1.0,4/18/2016,"Horrible service!!! Waited over 40 min to be seated with half the restaurant empty, very under staffed, very unconcerned with any request, staff was very inefficient."
Robert V.,"Coachella, CA",15,2,,1.0,1/29/2017,They are definitely low on help. Been here for an hour and a half before I got my bevarages I ordered and the appetizers. This does not include wait time. They need to step it up especially on a weekend. Food came out cold as well. They need to work on this!
Alejandra E.,"Thermal, CA",39,6,,3.0,8/2/2016,So went about a month ago first time to this location . Food took forever to reach us the server was a nice girl that started off great then a hour later disappeared not cool. My son food was fine but mine and my spouse's o man horrible her ribs and my chicken and shrimp nothing but the taste of charcoal! Even our hands were left all black wish we would of said something . Saddly we just ate our appetizers debating to ever go back .
Tiffany H.,"Indio, CA",0,13,,1.0,6/24/2016,Long wait for food and refills on drinks.ive been here for almost 1 1/2 hrs and just barely got my food and its not even peak hours! No apologies given or explanations. Ive asked for a to go bag and im still waiting 10 mins. Never again
Berry B.,"Indio, CA",17,38,155,4.0,7/17/2015,"This Applebee's feels larger than others in the area. My party of six arrived around 1 PM and was seated promptly. Our waitress was attentive and refilled drinks in a reasonable amount of time and if other staff noticed we were low, they stepped in and also refilled drinks.  I ordered the lunch combo of Honey Chicken Tenders and Fiesta Chopped Salad. The food was presented in an appetizing way and the tenders were awesome. The waitress offered dessert and we gave in to the brownie bites!"
Leticia A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,2.0,11/7/2016,"I don't think I'll be back to this Applebee's.   The food is good, staff is friendly but the lack of communication between the wait and support staff makes for an unpleasant dining experience every time."
Brian S.,"Palm Desert, CA",1,34,15,1.0,2/18/2015,"We have been there 5 times since opening this was by far the worst customer service and restaurant experience we have had thus far. We sat and watched as 3 other people had service issues that were mishandled by the management on duty.  Basically, there was a drunk that had obviously been over served alcohol and was disruptive for everyone at the bar, she showed her breasts to the bartenders and all they did was laugh.  In addition, one customer complained about his portion size (he was accustomed to) in reference to the other local Applebees  and was told corporate has changed plates, there was a customer who asked if it was possible to steam an Asian style appetizer and was told they don't steam things (meanwhile steamed broccoli was served).  He said to us ""how do they steam the broccoli then, but can't steam pot-stickers""? Don't go to Indio Applebees if you are a military veteran unless you have your dog-tags or a tattoo to prove it.  The manager was so ignorant to even ask for such items and challenge the integrity of a proud military service member.  Only people with service related disabilities get ID cards.......I was refused a posted 20% discount all because I didn't have my dog-tags or a tattoo to prove it.  I don't even have a tattoo and my dog-tags are framed next to my honorable discharge!!!!!! Management was very aggressive towards guests with service complaints and not one single guest was accommodated for their legitimate food service  issues. The female manager stood in front of me and ruined my and my loved ones evening with her aggressive behavior regarding asking for a posted military discount. Don't go to the Indio Applebees if you want good service, and by all means don't expect anything if you have an issue with your food, drunk over served patrons, or posted discounts."
Stephen C.,"Coachella, CA",208,64,89,1.0,3/15/2015,"This is a great place to go if you want a mediocre dining experience coupled with a show; amateur hour.  I absolutely hate this location.  If I was locked in a room with this restaurant, the leader of ISIS and Sadam and I had a gun with two bullets, I'd shoot this restaurant twice.  You couldn't pay me to eat here with your mouth eating and the chef forking ""phood"" down my waiting maw.  This place makes me so angry, I had to double up on my blood pressure meds lest I suffer an infarction.  Sadly I'd rather have done that than deal with the hostesses, who'd rather play with each other than acknowledge the growing line of rubes like myself who decided to patronize this pit of desolation.   If you're in the mood to punish yourself for your sins against humanity, then come here. If you have a shred of decency, Del Taco is across the street."
Jackie S.,"Indio, CA",151,13,,1.0,10/24/2016,"I guess we should've read a few comments before coming to this location. Service was not good. My friend and I arrived and got seated right away. Then, that's where it went downhill. The table next to us got service 5-6 times by a server before we were even asked for drinks. Someone walked in 5 minutes after us to the bar and promptly asked what he wanted. 3-4 servers walked by our booth but none asked if we needed anything and our menus were down. I had to ask the hostess who was our server. Hostess went and talked to the server who was managing the other booth next to us in our section and she rolled her eyes and was the same person who went to the bar and asked the guy what he wanted. Mind you, granted this is next to the courthouse, and we went during lunch, there weren't that many tables. The server came to our table and we ordered our food and drinks together. We had 2 different people serve our food. We finished and then it was another waiting game. Took us another 10 minutes to get our check because we didn't have a device to pay in our booth. We even had our plates stacked and shoved to the front after we asked the hostess for a box. Paid right away with cash and left without giving a tip, which I NEVER do-- I even tip on to-go orders."
Hannah R.,"La Quinta, CA",2,3,23,4.0,5/25/2015,The service is usually adequately efficient and the food and drinks are great. Our favorite place to go out for a casual night. The half price apps during happy hour are our favorites. The buffalo wings are amazing.
Miguel L.,"Indio, CA",23,5,,4.0,6/2/2016,So i came back to see how long it was going to take this time and to be honest is was GREAT the server was on point the cooks on point this has been one of my best experiences here this time it was almost flawless how every one performed during my family visit here great work every one
Vanessa R.,"Indio, CA",0,5,1,2.0,3/31/2015,"20 min to be seated in an empty bar... 35 min wait for water... No wiskey in stock... Kids choco milk missing the chocolate Starting to wonder if they have opened for business yet? Someone please help! We really want this location to be successful. Waitress Kim tried to make our visit enjoyable. Shes the only reaskn were giving 2 stars.  Thanks Kim and keep smiling, we'll try again soon."
Shila B.,"Vancouver, Canada",160,11417,733,2.0,4/12/2015,Cheap food if you want something quick but there as no taste. Had a club sandwich and even the mayo was bland. Didn't even finish sandwich. Customer service was okay.
Will M.,"Indio, CA",3,28,2,5.0,4/3/2016,Came in and was seated by Sophia in under 10 seconds. Our server Marcus was wonderful! He was very attentive and quick with taking and bringing our order. He is very customer service oriented. Definitely go see him!
John A.,"Seattle, WA",0,37,,4.0,2/22/2016,We've had a couple of dinners this last week at Applebee's and we think they give pretty good bang for the buck.  We had the Thai Shrimp and also one of the chicken salads our first trip and they were pretty good.  Tonight we had the southwest salad and it was great!  Our waitress (Cindy) was very personable and gave us both good recommendations as well as solid service.   We'd go back!
