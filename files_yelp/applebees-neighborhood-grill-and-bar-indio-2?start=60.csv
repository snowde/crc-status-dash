Jaime G.,"Indio, CA",85,2,,2.0,6/9/2016,"I would have been ok with this place but the way they made my drink after I had 7 long islands...no liquor in my drink...and pluss they have no advertisement about how many drinks I can have...""HAPPY HOUR"" doesn't say any limit per customer....just saying!"
Jackie H.,"Pahrump, NV",29,149,14,2.0,1/8/2016,"So here is the deal, food was good, service was poor.  This was built across the street from the courthouse and should be busy during the lunch hour.  No, was not even half full and the service was terrible.   No way someone can come in and have lunch within an hour.   We arrived at 11:45, ordered and took 1/2 an hour to get our food plus additional time to get the extra salad dressing we ordered with the meal.  Then we had to have a server track down the waiter so we could pay the check.  This seems to be an on going problem with the Applebee's corp.  They need properly trained servers and possibly more on duty during the busy hours."
Delia L.,"Ontario, CA",0,5,1,1.0,2/21/2016,"The worse servers had four ladies tell us that they were going to take our order and do still walked away, waited around 25 minuets, We finally got our appetizer I had to ask for plates they never came, A couple next to us came in after us got server before us, they got their order wrong and left upset."
Josh L.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,18,126,1.0,11/28/2015,"Terrible service, I just left, a bunch of tables available but they insist on making patrons wait and wait...This establishment is run by monkeys, don't waste your time; just go down the street, there are other better choices."
Loves F.,"Mecca, CA",0,8,,1.0,3/24/2016,I love Applebee's just not this one. Why? Because they didn't want to give me my food. I called in the phone to order my food and I told them that I will pick it up in a few mins. They took my order they said it will be ready by the time I get there. I got there and waited and no employee came out. I called and told them I was here to pick up my order they told me they will be right out after 30 minutes I had enough and called again only to tell me that they will not bring the food because it was after 9pm but the thing is I was there way before 9pm and I didn't get my food. This really got me mad! Very bad service. You employees give Applebee's a bad name
Mario V.,"Indio, CA",5,6,1,5.0,3/28/2015,"Great service from the waiters, great food.  All the whiners are probably from the fair and are entitled babies. Wahhh wahhhhhh"
Animal-Lover J.,"La Quinta, CA",10,203,62,4.0,10/31/2015,"I was pleasantly surprised with the service! The hostess was gracious and seated us right away. Our server was equally attentive and accommodating. As my son was looking around (we were checking out the new restaurant) two other servers (at different times) came over to see if we needed anything! Wow! I also observed a server in the adjacent section assist our servers customers and clean her tables when she wasn't as busy. Teamwork at its finest! I deducted one star because my food was just ""good"" - not great. And there was a screaming toddler flinging French fries all over the floor (while the parents did nothing) which was extremely disruptive and annoying."
Brenda P.,"Indio, CA",5,4,,1.0,2/20/2015,"What can I say....I took my kids for a night out I thought they would enjoy. All three of us, my 13 year old daughter, 9 year old son and I were seated on a small booth for two, our drinks arrived and needless to say within ten minutes my son spilled my drink, the waitress Kelsey never brought me extra napkins nor offered to help dry up. I sat there with an empty glass and wet napkins in my table until food was served....still no Kelsey...thanks to Chanel that finally offered to refill my glass about 20 minutes later. My daughter asked for the bourbon steak which was too salty she couldn't eat it, my son had the ribs, those were ok. Needless to say I will not be going there again, was so excited to have an Applebee's in Indio.....did not meet my expectations."
John S.,"Indio, CA",0,6,3,2.0,2/29/2016,The service here is always pretty good....friendly waitresses and a pretty good atmosphere....SADLY the food here is horrible the chicken was so rubbery and tasted horrible I couldn't really enjoy it....the bacon macaroni is pretty good but not worth the prices....I can say the taco appetizer was pretty good....
George L.,"La Quinta, CA",0,1,7,1.0,9/14/2015,Bug in my burger manager gave me a shake instead of a discount or no charge on food. Waitress was great.
Renee A.,"Indio, CA",69,4,,1.0,1/20/2016,"Been coming to this Applebee's since it opened. Service has completely went down. We have waited about 20min for a server to get our drinks, then we were rushed to order food."
Lacy E.,"Palm Desert, CA",197,40,7,4.0,3/23/2015,"First time visit at this new location. I had the broccoli cheese soup and grilled chicken cesar salad. Everything tasted great. I was especially impressed with the service. Jesse, our server, was very friendly and attentive. He even noticed my mother had pulled the bread from her sandwich and inquired if she had any problems. She told him no, that she was just trying to avoid gluten and so he offered to bring her some lettuce to wrap the sandwich with. We finished off with a brownie bite dessert, which was a small but perfect portion after a big meal. I'm sure I will be back to visit this location when I visit the area."
Crystal T.,"Palm Desert, CA",5,4,,2.0,1/6/2016,"Food is typical at all applebees, so im not complaining about that, but the service and cleanliness is disgusting! There was a hair in my husbands drink, and LIP GLOSS on the cup."
Daniel A.,"Indio, CA",4,30,3,4.0,4/5/2015,"Really nice inside. I was *Surprised* at how nice this Applebees is, being in Indio. Staff was friendly."
Cheryl B.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,3,,3.0,7/4/2016,"The restaurant seemed clean. Our food was just average. I had a burger with egg and hash browns (forgot the name ) and my son had veggie substitution for burger. Husband had Asian mini tacos and something else. His was the best. Our water had terrible aftertaste. High point was Mandy our server who took the order quickly and had a very positive attitude and nice smile. Serving the food took a while, but maybe that was the chef"
Edward J.,"Indio, CA",0,5,5,4.0,4/29/2015,"Now that this place has been open for a bit I think they finally have it all in place...   came in on limited time before work, had the triple bacon burger with onion rings...   was excellent. Service was fast and food was delicious. I even had time to mess around with the little presto tablet..."
Ysidro M.,"Carson, CA",17,9,,1.0,3/1/2015,Horrible service and bad tasting food. The quantities are a lot smaller portions than the other franchise store like La Quinta. The food was over cook and no flavor don't understand how the indio branch can be so different than the La Quinta branch.
Serina M.,"La Quinta, CA",22,32,,2.0,3/4/2015,It did take a while to get our food but I'm assuming it's because their still new and adapting. I give them two stars because the bartender Jamie  was trying to be attentive even with only one other bartender present. His customer service was great! Ill come back in a few months...see if there's any improvements
Krystal V.,"Indio, CA",0,16,1,1.0,3/31/2015,"Worst service I've ever had!!! Drinks and food took way too long to come out. My husband ordered a beer and even that took 15 minutes and was the wrong beer. On top of that, our server was conversing with another guest for at least 10 minutes, (I understand, being nice comes with the job, but what about the other tables that were left unattended while she chatted). Ended up asking a hostess walking by to get us refills, extra napkins, and dipping sauces. And of course I was met with a sigh of discontent, and a rude comment because I was not patient enough to wait for my server. I was able to complain to a manager and all I got was an excuse about there policy on encouraging there servers to talk with their guests and disbelief that her hostess was disrespectful...  I don't ever complain about a restaurant, because I was once a server in my past I know what demands are being placed upon them.. But this was ridiculous!! If I could I would give negative stars!  Never eating here again!!!"
Christina R.,"Indio, CA",52,7,7,5.0,7/8/2015,Haven't been to Applebees in years! Decided today was the day to break the no attendance stent and I'm sorry it didn't come sooner. I had the clubhouse grille and probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! Hungry? Go to Applebees they will not only fill you up but they'll leave your tastebuds dancing in celebration for the flavor that has been so blessedly bestowed upon them! Cheers!
