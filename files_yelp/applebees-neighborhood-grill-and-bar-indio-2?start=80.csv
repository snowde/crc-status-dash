Adam I.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/30/2016,"worst service, waited for over a hour for food, 30 min for my drinks, will never come here again, do not recommend this place to any one"
Katie M.,"Palm Springs, CA",126,34,6,2.0,3/6/2016,"Didn't have the best experience here tonight. Walked in with four adults and 3 kids ( three toddlers !) the place looked empty ! Sweet !! No..... They had booths open but we still had to wait about 10 minutes.. why!!??!! The host us placed us in a big booth, and told us our serves was Anna. We never saw Anna. We had to wait 15 minutes for someone to bring us watt ( we had to call someone over ). I guess the bartender didn't even know she was serving us. 3 out for 4 adults ordered drinks. My sisters margarita had to be sent back two times ! There was zero alcohol in it! It tasted like water. The manager made it a third time and it tasted disgusting still. There was no use into bringing it back again. We never once got a refill on waters. This Applebee's has literally gone to shit! Every time I come here there's a problem. I always seem to give it another shot and I think I'm done trying. Hopefully they get there stuff straight so they'll stop getting bad reviews on Yelp."
Amanda D.,"Wahiawa, HI",59,11,3,1.0,5/3/2015,So far not good. Been here 20 minutes. We had to flag the server down to even get him to say hi. Took forever to get drinks.. Still no straws. The waiter is not busy he just doesn't have it together. Wondering if we should just leave... Not a happy family. These employees and managers need to get there shit together or Applebee's will be closing soon. Just opened a few months ago and they already have 19 reviews and only 2 stars!!
Frankie G.,"Coachella, CA",23,2,68,1.0,3/5/2015,"So sad. I tried to order take out. First time it just rang, second time someone picked up and than hung up. Decided I'm not even going to go to this one. If I could I wouldn't give them one star."
Pablo T.,"Indio, CA",2,1,,5.0,7/15/2015,"Best service ever, along with great food! I had the All in American burger it was the best! Definitely will be back especially on Monday's they're half off the entire day"
Brando L.,"Indio, CA",98,11,4,1.0,3/9/2015,We had waited almost half an hour too get our food. The server was pretty nice but didn't check on us. The young bartender lady had to give us refills cause we hadn't gotten refills. And we ordered two hot wings appetizers and they never gave it to us. How ridiculous & fuck Ted.
Wyatt M.,"Indio, CA",3,24,,2.0,4/14/2015,"Serves an alright burger, BUT has decent onion rings. Ted is though. The menu has sticky food all over it. Please note this is my first experience at an Applebee's establishment. #applesbeesvirginitybroken"
Roy G.,"Indio, CA",134,11,10,1.0,3/8/2015,The service wasn't bad. But the food was over priced fast food style served cold after waiting way too long. The fries were greasy n soggy. Reminded me of high school cafeteria fries. Step your game up indio.
Suzie B.,"Murrieta, CA",0,19,,2.0,1/8/2016,"I've eaten at several Applebee's. This ranks second to the worse one ever. Slow to get our drink order, slow to deliver our drink order, slower to take our food order and slower still to deliver it. We waited for a long time for dressing for salads. Waited longer for additional dressing not brought with initial order. And, oh waited to get our bills. Horrible service. Food was up to par though. Will NOT recommend this location."
Esperanza R.,"Downey, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/7/2015,"This place has horrible service all around. They sat us and at least 5 servers walked by and ignored our table. We ended up leaving. This is not the first time, last visit the server brought the food separate, wrong drinks and no utensils after being asked multiple times. Overall, very bad service."
Cyndy J.,"Indio, CA",1,6,,4.0,2/12/2015,"Ok, they just opened and are smoothing out the wrinkles..give them a few more days. Our food was great, whoever their chef is is spot on with what we ordered. Staff very friendly and accommodating. I would come to this Applebees 100 times more than the one in La Quinta. Great job!!"
Katrina R.,"Indio, CA",0,10,1,2.0,2/24/2015,Service is horrible. Food took forever to come out! Our table next to us waited at least 45+ mins for their food and never received their appetizers.
Meagen J.,"San Diego, CA",51,17,,1.0,4/22/2015,"The service was terrible at this Applebee's location from start to finish. Also the food was mediocre. It was a very unsatisfying visit. So much so that I ended up canceling my food after it was dropped on the floor and took too long to come back out. They tried to make things better by comping the food from our meal, but they were so awkward and everything came out so wrong. Even the burger that came out was supposed to be no sauce with lettuce and tomato only and it had sauce with no tomato. They took it back and it took 15 min and it had to be wrapped up to go. When we got homo there was still NO LETTUCE OR TOMATO?!? Also when we initially ordered we asked to have 2 separate checks and they said no problem and asked who would be on each check then at the end of our meal they had to ask what each of us ordered. The workers here are nice but could use some customer service & front of the house training."
Raul J.,"Indio, CA",0,1,,3.0,2/12/2015,I sat in bar area. Ordered a mudslide and tasted nothing like a mudslide. Just tasted like vanilla ice cream with bit of liquor. Like bartender isnt experienced. Bartenders were talking too much and not noticing me. There were 4 bartenders and unorganized. I had to ask for napkins cause i wasnt given any like in other applebees.
Beatriz R.,"Indio, CA",37,1,,5.0,8/21/2015,"the service it's totally awesome waiters and waitresses help each other, impolite, funny...and their service is OnPoint!!"
Steven P.,"Arcadia, CA",180,35,,1.0,4/9/2015,Ok the service here from the start was crappy. The 2 girls behind the bar were unprofessional. They were actually speaking out loud about a write up she just got and she was confused about it. I could hear the comments around me about lack of service for an empty restaurant. Way over staffed and still inefficient. Fire 90% of these people on staff tonite 4/9/15 9:30 pm. Â They will be participants in the failure of this Applebee's location. Or find a manager who knows wtf they are doing. I tipped my usual low tip for horrible service .
Aly I.,"Indio, CA",0,6,2,1.0,4/17/2015,"Visited: 4/17/2015. I was excited for my soup and salad, until I discovered, according to the supervisor/assis. Manager wearing a leopard buttoned shirt, that their bowl of soup is measured by ""one ladle"". If that's the case than serve the one ladle serving of soup into a cup; for which would better suit it. And instead of this supervisor using her ability, since hey you hold the power to do so to fix the problem, I was given an ultimatum to take it or leave it. I guess giving me an additional half ladle serving of soup would just put this restaurant under. So, I had them remove my soup and salad from the bill and forgoed eating because I was upset over being given an ultimatum instead of a solution. Apparently, I'm not alone in my struggle to have good service at this Indio location,by the two star rating this restauraunt currently sustains. I really shouldn't be suprised, shame on me for giving them the benefit of the doubt. If anything lesson learned even though it took an empty stomach to do so, thank you female supervisor in the leopard buttoned shirt!  Alysha I."
