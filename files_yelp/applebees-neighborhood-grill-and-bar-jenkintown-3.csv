Tash M.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,9,3,4.0,12/18/2017,"Called ahead of time to make sure this location was participating in the current promotion of $1 Long Island and they were pleasant. Came in with a couple friends at 9pm on a Saturday, it was relatively crowded so we put our name on the list and went to Burlington for a few. We came for the special drinks and also appetizers. Our waitress informed us there was another promotion going on of 50% off appetizers! Win, win for girls nite out!"
Jessica L.,"Philadelphia, PA",60,62,90,1.0,9/28/2017,"Usually very good service and food overall. Tonight was the freaking worst. I'm pretty sure they had all new staff tonight.  I came in with my boyfriend and we were seated and then we waited 10-15 minutes before a server actually showed up to take our order. We even pressed the call server button they had, but apparently it didn't work. We got 2 strawberry lemonades and the 2 for $25. We ordered wings with light mild sauce so they don't drown the wings in dang acid. BUT NOOO, THEY DROWNED THOSE SUCKERS IN THERE AND BURNED THEM. We wanted a refill on our drinks but, haha, our server is nowhere to be seen. We eventually got our entrees. My boyfriend got an 8oz well done steak and I got the new menu item, the butcher's cut, which includes mashed potatoes on the bottom along with cut steak tips, tomatoes and onion rings. My meal was well made and tasted pretty good. The tomatoes with my mashed potatoes were probably not the greatest combination. They messed up my boyfriend's steak twice. The steak came out mooing and told them to cook it until it's well done. MOOOOO! THEY DIDN'T COOK IT RIGHT AGAIN. We got them to just take the steak off the deal. But they only took off $6 in which the steak was $8. I was pretty peeved since the meal altogether was $30 and we got crappy service and food.  Anyways, very shitty night indeed."
Tara M.,"Philadelphia, PA",21,38,137,3.0,1/7/2018,Service was great chicken fingers were good and the fries are great the riblets are so so. I would  come in again in the future to try other things.
Eddie L.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,4,8,1.0,12/11/2017,2nd time here in two months  and it's the last time.  Not a clean place and don't look like they care neither.
Christina H.,"Elkins Park, PA",150,117,259,1.0,10/4/2017,"DON'T VISIT!!! I'm not a fan of Applebees but I came in for a special they were running. I had several margaritas and some appetizers. The last margarita I had came with a huge crack in the glass. I alerted the bartender (Robert) and he poured the drink into a new glass and gave it right back to me which is a HUGE safety violation as there could be broken glass in the drink. I left it on the bar, paid my bill and asked to speak to the manager. I alerted him about what had happened. He apologized and offered to give me a free appetizer. As he walked past the bar, the bartender said loudly, ""What, they're trying to get something for free?"" When the manager returned I thanked him but informed him did not need the coupon as  I would not be returning to the establishment under any circumstances after that rude comment. He apologized again but I am appalled at the (lack of) service I received. Violating safety procedures and being overtly rude should NOT be acceptable anywhere. Never again!!!"
Johnny L.,"Marietta, GA",71,70,137,3.0,10/9/2017,"Came in here on a Monday afternoon right as they opened for a quick bite. The place is in the Burlington Coat Factory/Acme Shopping Center with a few other stores. Me and my wife came in with our daughter for some lunch and ended up being there for quite a while due to the length of time it took for them to get our entrees. We ordered the steak quesadilla and won ton chicken tacos which were brought out promptly and were pretty good no complaints. The waiter was great keeping the refills of my Diet Pepsi in check and overall pleasant. The only thing that ruined the experience was the time it took for our entrees to come out. It literally took 25-45 minutes to bring out some sirloin steak and a friggin salad? Anyhow with the wait being so long the food was not bad, typical Applebee's standards. Maybe they got the order mixed up but was not pleased having to wait that long for our entrees. Will most likely not be back for there are a lot of better places to eat and as my wife would say ""Once is Enough"""
Amber C.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,4,2,5.0,9/20/2017,"Ask for Mike! Best waiter ever. So gracious, so kind. He really made the experience phenomenal. My girlfriend is regular here and every time Mike is fabulous. 5 stars!! I wish every waiter could be mike."
Evelyn D.,"Philadelphia, PA",70,168,113,5.0,11/22/2016,"It was very good tonight. They have grilled items on the menu now.   A few weeks ago I had sirloin and tonight I had to grilled pork chop, garlicky string beans and mashed potatoes.  It was so good."
Antonette S.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,3,,1.0,10/4/2017,"Went for happy hour and received a margarita in a cracked glass. I told the bartender (Robert)  and he simply poured the same drink into a new glass. HUGE safety violation!!! I spoke with a manager about it. Afterwards, the bartender sarcastically asked the manager (loudly enough for us to hear), ""Oh they just want something for free?"" I was shocked and appalled as that was not my intention - I typically don't even go to chain restaurants and I definitely won't be back to this one. Terrible service! They have to address this if they want to keep customers."
Jen K.,"Telford, PA",7,6,,1.0,12/12/2017,"Horrible. Walked out. My daughter and I popped into this location around 6:30 on a Tuesday night. We were sat immediately. Took twenty minutes for the server to come over and get our drinks order. Meanwhile, we ordered mozzarella sticks through the ordering system on the table. Mozzarella sticks came out with no marinara sauce, yet I requested it. Still, no server asking for our entree order. I hit the contact server option on the order screen at our table. He didn't come over but the manager did. By that time I was sliding my card into the order screen thing on the table so we could leave asap. The manager was apologetic but by this time I was over it. We went down the road to Jules Thin Crust and had dinner which was excellent."
Ada W.,"Brooklyn, NY",164,184,321,4.0,8/5/2016,"Came here for dinner out of convenience despite the bad reviews. Food was average (3 stars), good price especially with the 2 entrees for $20/$25 deals. we ordered 3 medium rare sirloin steaks. 2 of them came out perfect. The third one was somewhat undercooked, and as a result, it was so hard to cut through. I would've asked them to recook it, but my dad was butchering the whole piece of steak, already, so..watever. Like some of the other reviews said, some of the food was salty, including the fries and the artichoke dip. Service was nice and pleasant. The waitress who took our order was very patient with us and our questions. What made me give them 4 stars was the fact that my sister left her phone on the table after we left. One of the waiters found it and ran out to the parking lot to give it back to us. Thank you!!"
Jonathan B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,3,,5.0,10/25/2016,I took my mother and father to  the restaurant for dad's birthday.  The food was good and the service was great.
Bobby B.,"Thornton Heath, United Kingdom",13,33,42,5.0,8/29/2016,"The sandwiches here are legendary, birthday specials and cheesy fries. Free refills and cozy decor."
Sara J.,"Hoboken, NJ",213,62,16,2.0,7/4/2016,"Opted for carside to go at this location yesterday. I ordered online at home then went to go pick it up.  Firstly, it took 15 minutes longer than the estimated pick up time I was provided.  Secondly, they forgot to pack two orders of garlic mashed potatoes. I'd understand if it was busy but there were only two tables when we walked in to pick up our food.  Never going to Applebee's ever again.  Other than that the food was alright."
Lamar R.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,2,,1.0,11/16/2016,"Tonight I dined at your Jenkintown location (323 Old York Rd, Jenkintown, PA 19046, 11/16/16, 7:07PM, check # 9493-471273) with my mother. Our server was CARLY P. The service was satisfactory. However, after receiving change from our bill, we asked Carly P if she could break $5 OR give us $1 and keep $4. Carly P said, ""I hope that next time the service is better,"" as she went to get the change. Although I immediately knew that Carly P was being passive aggressive, assumptive, rude and unprofessional, my mother thought that perhaps there as a miscommunication, as unprofessionalism is not something we've come to expect during our almost two decades dining at Applebee's.  When Carly returned with five one-dollar bills, my mother said, ""I think you misunderstood me, I just wanted the change, you can keep $4."" Carly P hesitated, gave a frustrated and rude glare towards my mother and said, ""I hope the service is better next time."" Carly P took the $4 tip, didn't say ""thank you,"" and walked off. Tips are optional, the amount one leaves is solely up to their discretion, and customers do not dine at Applebee's to have unpleasant experiences with their waitress. While it wasn't the worst experience in the world, it was unprofessional and passive aggressive enough that we will NEVER be stepping foot into another Applebee's for the foreseeable future, and we will also encourage our social circle to do the same. It is my hope that management speaks with Carly P about her behavior so that other paying customers don't have to experience her rudeness."
Sara W.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,9,13,4.0,8/4/2016,"Was reluctant to come here due to the bad rating but had no idea what to eat so went in. 1. We were seated immediately. 2. Our server was nice and patient while we were taking our time ordering. 3. The food was decent average food, I had the 2 for 25 and got the steak with Mac and cheese and garlic potatoes. The steak was made the way I ordered, medium rare, and the garlic mash was good but would have been better if it was hot rather than warm. 4. When I left the rest, I didn't realize I left my phone behind and a waiter ran out to give me back my phone."
Tom R.,"Philadelphia, PA",96,39,11,2.0,2/4/2017,"Even though I have lived in NE Philly for 10 years, I have never gone here, preferring other restaurants.  It will also be my last visit.  The wait was expected for 5:30 on a Sat night.  My friend and I ordered a 2 sample appetizer and dinner.  After a LONG wait 1 of the aps finally came to the table.  Just 1.  We were told the other was coming.   We finished the pretzels and waited another 10 minutes for the egg roles.  I swear 1 looked like it had been sampled by the kitchen staff before we got it.  Then as we were 1/2 way thru them another plate of egg roles came out.  When the server came by we told her these had arrived as well.  She picked them up and said there must be a mix up some where.  You think?  2 tables that came in after us were served their meals.  We finally had to ask where our steaks were and were told it woulds be a few minutes.  Were they out back killing the cow?  We had now been at the table 40 minutes with only aps.  When the steaks finally arrived, I had ordered the 12 oz sirloin.  About 3 ounces of it was ALL fat and gristle.  Also I have no idea what the issue was but an older woman who seemed to be having dinner with her Grandson kept talking to the waitress and you could tell she was up[set.  Finally she got up from her table, and walked over to the POS station.  A waitress right next to us asked if anything was wrong and the woman replied ""I'm ready to throw this unless a manager does something""  I'm guessing her experience was worse than mine.  With so many choices in NE Philly and Jenkintown - this is not worth the time"
Emily K.,"Willow Grove, PA",46,109,102,1.0,11/1/2013,Yea. This place is horrible. Went last night. Wings looked like they were sitting for awhile since the sauce on the wings hardened. Our food looked weird and the table was sticky and dirty. Everything came out late. We were here for a hour and a half. 30 mins in and we didn't even have drinks. We had to ask to get a waiter.  Obviously management does not care here. And if they do they are not managing and do not have any structure.  Get it together.
Noel N.,"Cranford, NJ",2,16,1,4.0,8/1/2016,"Been here many times over the past 5-6 years with me elderly mother & they ALWAYS treat her/us with kindness & respect . Today we celebrated her 93rd birthday & they were lovely as always . My sister & I had delicious salads, mom had steak. But the treatment towards my mother is what we come for ."
Courtney P.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,15,2,1.0,1/27/2017,"I was just online then I called the location for a 9.99 burger deal just before cutoff at 3:59 and I was not allowed to order the burger deal. I was just before the mark, it's horrible customer service to ""just miss the deal"" . I've been in the location last week for pick up, waiting at the ToGo station, for 10mins while I asked two different servers if they could get my order. They didn't even acknowledge me, when I asked if i could get my food, they just said it's not their station, no appology and no one tried to get someone to help me. I get better service at a dive dinner or fast food to be honest!! I work in the plaza but 2 HORRIBLE customer service experiences I will NEVER consider this location for a food option again!!"
Charlotte D.,"Philadelphia, PA",87,191,50,1.0,3/14/2015,"Don't even waste your time or money. I haven't been to this Applebee's in years and it's even worse than before. The menu is completely new with very modern type, new american food. They have a new policy of bringing out food when it's ready so everyone's food comes out at different times making it very awkward when one person at the table has food and the rest of us wait ten minutes for ours,  The waitress was very nice at first but the second my friend complained about their food, she became instantly nasty. We received our food before our drinks. The runners brought out our food and we had to ask them for condiments or anything we needed because our waitress was avoiding our table. When she did walk by she never asked did we need anything, refills on drinks, nothing. At one point we could see her in the lobby laying down on the bench in front of the hosts stand and even walk out the front door for a few minutes. After complaining to the manager who was very nonchalant and argued with me at one point but agreed to take off one of my food items. During this entire time from when we complained about the first food item until when we asked for a manager our server was STILL nowhere to be found. Shortly after that, the manager came with one bill. From the time we sat down, we asked for separate checks to save this trouble. The waitress then comes over after ten minutes with separate checks that are ALL wrong and mixed up. She didn't even speak to us, instead she folded each check in half and handed it to us one by one. It was like dealing with an angry child."
Jo M.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,92,,2.0,4/29/2016,"My child picked Applebee's for her birthday dinner.  I had not eaten at an Applebee's in a couple of years but we went to satisfy her.  After the overall experience, I can honestly say I don't feel a need to come back. The pros: The hostess greeted us right away.  We were able to get a seat right away as well.  And our waitress was very nice.  Even after I changed my drink order she wasn't irritated or rude.  She let us take out time looking over the menu, and throughout our dining experience.  We ordered the drink special and it was very good.  My child was entertained with the birthday ""surprise"" (singing and brownie/ice cream). The cons: Overall, the food wasn't very good.  It did have flavor, but seemed a bit on the salty side.  Only 1 out of 3 of us that it was ok.  And how the food was brought out was a major issue for me.  First we received our appetizer (that my child won't eat).  So here we are, eating and she isn't.  Then she received her dinner about 10 minutes after our appetizer.  So now she is eating and we aren't.  Ok, cool.  She is eating.  But it took another 10 minutes for my husband and I to get our food.  So she was pretty much done eating before we even started.  We sat as a family, but we didn't eat as a family. I would recommend to bring the appetizer and kids meal together, or appetizer then all meals together. Also, when we went into the bathroom it wasn't clean.  There was no toilet paper in one stall and there was no hand soap.  It was aroud 7pm on a weekday.  I would think they should have maintained it before the evening crowd came in."
Nicole D.,"Elkins Park, PA",22,6,,3.0,8/31/2015,There was not many people eating out tonight so I was dissatisfied that our server was not on top of his tables like he should've been. Our food came out before our salad a manger never came over to visit the table I was done eating my food and asking for the check by the time I got a refill. My chicken fingers barely had any meat in them and were burnt. I was just starving which is the only reason I would come to Applebee's anyway but they never cease to disappoint me
A Y.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,4,,1.0,7/23/2015,"So we go there, 9pm on Thursday, is not packed there are no people waiting to get seated, besides us of course. 4 adults, 2 kids one who requires high chair, people come in and get seated (2s, 3s, 4s) and we wait and wait, I asked why we havent been seated they tell us the same excuse they told us when we first got there, ""we are waiting for this table to get cleaned."" Staff was standing around talking, looking  at each other,  who were they waiting for to clean the table???? Another couple comes in-they get seated, we decided to get up and leave, will not visit this location again. Get it together! !!"
Nikki B.,"Willow Grove, PA",12,153,5,1.0,12/12/2015,Went here because we were in the area. This rating is based on food our service was surprisingly great...I got mozzarella sticks..how do you mess them up? The breading was dripping GREASE. yuck
Joe S.,"Forks, WA",84,117,6,3.0,6/14/2015,"Any visit in this area usually turns into an off balance experience...I must remember when I'm dining alone to just go eat at the bar,because never fail any time I sit at a table they usually end up setting up a huge table for like 10 or more and MY waiter is the one that also has to service them which means bye bye to me..."
Tanya C.,"Philadelphia, PA",57,67,12,3.0,8/16/2015,We took the kids here to eat. Nice place for a family restaurant but it is not the cleanest place. Last minute dinner.
Annette B.,"Glenside, PA",9,10,,1.0,12/13/2015,"Just want to say the ""triple hog dare ya"" & the ""brew pub philly "". Both where disgusting sandwiches that I wouldnt feed to my hog if I had one. The Bar-B-que & classic fries tasted of old oil and artificial  seasonings that where obviously frozen before hand. In this day and age of hard earned money you dont want to waste it on this joint!"
Ling P.,"Philadelphia, PA",94,132,396,1.0,2/19/2013,"By far the worse Applebee's I've been to so far. We ordered the Crispy Wonton and Mozzarella Sticks for our appetizer. The Crispy Wonton was very good. It was a little greasy, but worth getting again in the future. The Mozzarella Sticks were undercooked. The mozzarella cheese didn't stretch out when you took a bite of it because it wasn't fully melted, which made it unappetizing. The marinara was too thick and didn't taste right. The appetizer altogether was gross. Our entrees took over a half an hour and it wasn't busy. Our waitress never checked on us and never came back to give us our check. We left an estimate of what we believe that will pay for our entrees and left. The host and hostess should have serviced us instead. They greeted us when we walked in and escorted us with a ""Have a great night!"" This Applebee's is a total fail. They need to get their customer service together."
Kimberly G.,"Newtown, PA",740,385,8,1.0,9/22/2013,"Bad service, cold food! One of the worst experiences I've ever had at an Applebee's. The host told us ""your host will be here in 5 minutes or something"". So unprofessional! The waiter didn't bring us our drink order till after our appetizer came. When our entrees came 3 out of the four came and one was cold. We sent it back to reheat it and it still wasn't hot. We had to ask for the food we ordered.  It took him 20 minutes to reheat pasta! I was under impressed. I won't be coming back"
Wise M.,"Haymarket, VA",20,42,146,3.0,10/26/2014,"The restaurant isn't crowded this time of the day. The restaurant is clean and nothing out the ordinary to report. A lot of staff on hand. Jill was our server and she was pleasant, attentive, and nice. I order a strawberry  avocado salad with salmon and water with lemon to drink."
Robyn E.,"Philadelphia, PA",31,27,,2.0,6/16/2015,Food was mediocre.  Employees getting ready for work and chatting loudly on phone.  Feels like a high school cafeteria.  Pass...
Stuart D.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,3,,2.0,6/12/2014,"This place starts out fine. The waiter was a great guy, took our order, a little slow with the drinks, but otherwise, there was no problem. All I mentioned was the waiter, now let's get to the food. I ordered a steak medium rare, got it, cut into it, and it looked like it was rare. Had them take it back. They come back with a better cooked steak, but it was the same one I returned after cutting into and noticing its condition. I requested a new steak and they made me a new one. And then, while everyone else was putting their left overs into boxes, I was just cutting into my steak. Waiter, awesome. Service coming from the kitchen, sucked."
Alyssa C.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,84,7,3.0,11/4/2013,"A little shocked this location got such bad reviews!!! Only issue was Halloween night bc kids ate free and boy was it PACKED and slow service.  Always happy w the service and food here, french onion soup the BLT my faves!!"
Denise C.,"Abington, PA",14,19,2,4.0,11/23/2011,"I've been to this Applee's before for their late-night specials. I usually sit at the bar, order a drink and get a few appetizers from their half-price menu.  This time I had the boneless buffalo wings and spinach dip. The wings were great and you get a fair amount of them. I'm wasn't super fond of their spinach dip because I think it lacks flavor. I also had a perfect margarita which I love because it comes with the shaker. It's like two drinks for the price of one! I will always return to this Applebee's for their late-night specials. The half-priced appetizers are great and not half the size. If you're looking for a relaxed, quiet place to wind down this is a great spot."
Hope R.,"Philadelphia, PA",24,43,852,3.0,1/31/2013,The burgers are great here. Love the bar area. They have a good selection of draft beers and mix drinks. Great place to grab a nice meal at an affordable price.
Arseny R.,"Feasterville-Trevose, PA",99,150,28,3.0,12/19/2009,"Was not a bad experience, but nothing outstanding.  Food - just good enough, service - just fast enough. Waitress was fun, but the busing crew was seriously confused."
Camilla C.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,18,23,1.0,2/7/2014,"I don't know why I even bothered to give this place a second chance. The last time I was here I was served pasta with just about no sauce on it, and then when they brought me a replacement, the sauce was completely bland. Today, I was served a club sandwich with ROCK HARD bread. It hurt my teeth/gums when I bit into it. I thought maybe it was just me, but when my husband tried it the same thing happened to him. Our waitress, Brittany, was also horrible. Probably the worst waitress I've had in the past year. She had a bad attitude from the moment we sat down."
Bella H.,"Philadelphia, PA",156,79,,2.0,8/19/2014,"Not the best applebee's I've been to. Went there last night with my mom and sister. The service was subpar because the waitress was barely there. The food was okay. The staff did not seem like they like their job. It was kind of clean and the environment was not cheerful at all. Ridiculous because now they charge for lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onions on a burger. How much profit are you even getting? Other places I've been to has a welcoming staff and exciting environment."
Robert B.,"Abington, PA",198,272,1,2.0,5/26/2010,"Not a lot good to say about this particular location. It is not always clean. The food is average to below average. Hard to mess up chain restaurant food, but it really is not good. I've been to this chain at other locations, and simply do not think this is a good representative of the chain."
