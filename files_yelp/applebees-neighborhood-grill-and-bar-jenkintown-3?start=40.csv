Dan B.,"New York, NY",1,40,3,4.0,1/15/2013,"Standard Applebee's, nice place to relax with friends on the inside. Over the last 5 years I have been there many times and the staff is always kind and fast."
Sam G.,"Ambler, PA",151,29,,2.0,5/14/2014,"I was with my friend and we both ordered the same steak. Both came out extremely undercooked and was not made how we ordered it. There were only a few tables occupied. We could not find our waitress either. We waited a while just to send our food back to the kitchen. Once it came back it was very tasty, but very tough and thick. Not impressed at all."
Meg F.,"Collingswood, NJ",38,168,4,1.0,12/2/2009,"Went here with my boyfriend. I got a salad.  I couldn't even eat half of it-it was COATED with caesar dressing.  This ""chicken caesar salad"" was supposed to have more toppings, but all it had on it was soggy croutons and some cold chicken. Oh, and there soda machine was broken..how does that happen? My boyfriend got the chicken, which was okay, but the portion was tiny. Service was slow. I would not go back to this one ever again."
Robert F.,"Glenolden, PA",3,75,6,2.0,11/15/2012,"Steak quesadilla towers are the best appetizer.  Get the brownie bite which includes a scoop of ice cream for only $1.  Tonight I visited with my aunt for my birthday, however my experience was less than memorable.  The appetizers, most of which were half price (except steak quesadilla towers and cheeseburger sliders).  They were out of pomegranate ice tea.  I asked for ice water with lemon but waitress (Stephanie) failed to provide the lemon.  The appetizers we ordered tasted fine, however the ambiance was less than fine. It was loud, noisy, and distracting with karaoke that goes on from 9-11 pm.  Applebee's resembled more of a bar/nightclub than a restaurant at that point.  I could barely hear my aunt speaking it was so loud.  I won't visit again during this time.  Also, once we told the waitress to drop off the check, she basically disappeared after providing payment.  We stayed for another hour past the time my Aunt paid with no visit from the waitress.  Meanwhile, i was parched and there was no one around to offer or ask us if we wanted anything further.  It also felt like the waitress was getting snippy and rushed us as we were trying to choose our appetizers.  Applebee's management really needs to get involved and properly train their employees and well as provide a nice, inviting environment for customers to enjoy their food and drink.  It doesn't feel like the employees put forth a good effort to render good customer service to their patrons."
Dana B.,"Philadelphia, PA",324,852,,4.0,1/6/2009,"I've eaten at a number of different Applebee's locations, but I have to say I've eaten at this particular location the most out of all of them.  The food is great, I especially love the salmon and the parmesan tilapia, and my newest favorite--the dessert shooters!  Dessert shooters are popular desserts like hot fudge sundaes, cheesecake, strawberry shortcake, and chocolate mousse served in what looks like a shot glass but a bit bigger.  Good for people like me who crave dessert but don't want to go too overboard with portions.   The best part is that if you get 3 of them, they're only $2 each!"
