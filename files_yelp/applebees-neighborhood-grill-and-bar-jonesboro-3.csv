Minh T.,"Atlanta, GA",11,49,148,3.0,10/22/2017,"We came in around 12am and it took them about 10-15 minutes to seat us. The bar area was packed so there wasn't any first come first serve seating. Even after we were seated, it took about 15-20 minutes for our waitress to come and take our orders.   We came in during their October $1 margarita special, dollarita. It was really watered down, and I felt like I was drinking lemonade and not a margarita. You do get what you pay for.  After 10pm they have 1/2 off appetizers. We ordered the spinach dip. We were given a side of salsa with it as well. The spinach dip was good for the price. I wanted to order the chicken wonton tacos but I was told that they were out of wontons. I've had it before and it's probably one of my favorite appetizers from them. The flavors blend well together and it's a pretty light appetizer. Despite the service I love Applebee's and their food. The price is good and the drinks are good. I enjoy coming here to watch games or just chill with friends. I will come back."
Thuy P.,"Atlanta, GA",420,49,213,3.0,10/22/2017,"i've been to this applebee's a couple times, and each time has been... OK. on my most recent visit on 10/21, it took us 10-15 min to get seated at 12am, this is understandable, but it also took 20 min for a waiter to come to our table and take our orders.  we already knew what we wanted and it was frustrating to see the servers walking back and forth, not busy and also not taking our order.  i enjoyed the artichoke dip-- priced half off from the late night menu, and $1 margaritas--dollaritas--$1 for the month of october-- amazing deals! i had a good time with my friends, and although i did not appreciate the slow service, i will undoubtedly be back."
Tara B.,"Columbia, SC",38,245,148,4.0,7/28/2017,"This is a typical Applebee's on a Friday night. Outrageous attire, loud music playing and people conversing at the bar. I came here specifically for Brownie and ice cream AKA Blue Ribbon brownie. No complaints regarding customer service. We were seated right away and greeted properly."
Thomas W.,"Atlanta, GA",3,37,144,1.0,4/1/2017,"This place need to be revamp because the service is bad, food quantity is poor, and the bathrooms are nasty. Once we sat down it took over 15mins for someone to help us and she didn't offer water at all. She assumed we wanted alcohol, once we ordered alcohol she still didn't offer or bring water we had to asked. She also brought out main dishes first before the appetizers. Smh. Our food was over cook and it didn't have any flavor to it.  Our utensils were dirty and the drinks were water down. Both bathrooms didn't have soap or towels for your hands and it looked like it wasn't clean for days. This is the last time I will ever come back to that location because it's not worth my time. DON'T eat at this location, you will be disappointed."
Ms.Leading 1.,"Atlanta, GA",5,82,9,1.0,3/10/2017,Hostess is a airhead. No class or professionalism. Smh Will not return . These employees are LAZY AS HECK.  Servers don't want to do anything. The only person in here that's attentive was one of the bartenders .  I'm kind of pissed . Our actual waiter was a prune. The manger was a joke . I will NOT BE back to this establishment.
Kimberly L.,"Honolulu, HI",92,285,189,2.0,6/24/2016,"I was excited to try Applebee's, because we don't have one in Hawaii, yet.  Lol.  I'm such a newb.  Anyways,  when we came in service was pretty good.  Our waiter was attentive and made the small chatter.  However, service turned.  She disappeared for...  A while.  Lol.  I was thinking that maybe she got off her shift?  We were occupied with meeting up with my bf's family so we kept ourselves occupied but the food time took forever.  I think we waited over 1 hour and food came out staggered.  The manager actually went around BEFORE the food came out and asked how everything was BEFORE it turned bad.  He should have said something about the kitchen being backed up or something, give us a warning!  I'd try them again but maybe a different location.  Lol."
Andrew J.,"Mandeville, LA",0,11,10,5.0,1/30/2017,"This place has changed a lot in the last few months.  The new staff and possible new management have taken an interest in making this place better.   The food is hotter and similar to the pictures you see.  My favorite waitress is ABONY, she takes real good care of you.  The place is a lot cleaner and the atmosphere has changed from a after hours club to a nice restaurant. The volume of the music is lower so you can have conversations.  The only complaint is that hustlers are always out from trying to be for money.  It's kind of embarrassing when have friends or a date.  Thank you Applebee's for turning this place around."
Rico W.,"Denton, TX",0,27,1,2.0,3/16/2017,This places is extremely slow. The waitress didn't want to give me what I asked for. She overcharged me and tried to justify the reason which didn't make since. Please go elsewhere!
Marlon A.,"Miami, FL",304,4,,1.0,8/2/2016,Got seated at 10:50 didn't get my food until 11:50 AND it was wrong! Didnt give me silver ware either. Didn't make a deal of it but asked if I could get compensated and they took off $3. What a joke. The server name was kisha btw
Ashley F.,"Jonesboro, GA",97,60,86,1.0,4/2/2016,Worst service ever! We tried to notify the staff that we had a big party and they apparently weren't ready. It took almost 3 hours for our food to come to the table and the orders still aren't right. This is ridiculous and they need more staff.  Our original waitress walked off from our table and said she wouldn't serve us bc she got to frustrated with all the orders this is beyond unacceptable. But the one thing they're trying to get right is the bill. Forget that 3 hours later people have still not received their food.
Pia B.,"Lithonia, GA",7,60,25,1.0,4/17/2016,Very dissatisfied!! Entered restaurant at 4:39 and left at  7:30. It food 2 hrs to come.. It took our drinks 1 hr and had to come. I asked the manager to comp our bill they took off $4.99.... I'm insulted. They are very disorganized  here. Will never return to this location.
Kay B.,"Hampton, GA",1,29,23,1.0,5/25/2015,"I ordered spinach dip and I was just pissed that they could serve someone stale chips. It was stale to the point where i couldn't even swallow it. It was so bad. And on top of that, the bowl that the spinach was in was used. It had old salsa stuck all around the rim. I'm just in disgust."
Joshua E.,"Jonesboro, GA",268,45,17,1.0,3/24/2016,Horrible horrible horrible.... I've been standing here for 10 mins at door. Nobody has helped me yet..... employees just walking around.... like really.
Katz A.,"Atlanta, GA",4,23,6,1.0,6/11/2015,"Most recent Applebee's visit.  Applebee's is uniformly bad. If not for mandatory lunch meetings,  I'd choose flight 571, Donnerees, or maybe even Arby's over Applebee's."
Christina D.,"Atlanta, GA",39,133,36,3.0,2/1/2016,"The sole reason for this review is based on the great service I received from the waiter,  Jose. On a busy Friday night,  amongst disgruntled guests and a big crowd, I managed to be seated promptly in his section. He was cool but professional and just had a warm n pleasant demeanor that was genuine! I had no issues with my order or service and my drinks were great!, I'd like to thank Jose for that because the manager I could definitely do without! My food was good, typical Applebees..but good,  nonetheless. The manager here was NOTHING at all to write home about AT ALL and I could do without him. Hence, the reason for the three stars."
Dr. D.,"Jonesboro, GA",2,11,2,3.0,12/12/2015,"This review almost was a one star!!! Stopped by on my way home to grab dessert; blonde with vanilla icecream. Upon entering the restaurant I was greeted by no one. When I approached the bar to sit down, a bartender says I wouldn't sit there because our wait staff frequents there. So I move to the other side of the bar stating I just want to order dessert. She states, okay just go to the other side in a dismissive tone... never a hi or welcome or how may I help you. Once on the other side of the bar, I take a seat. The bartender carries on as if I'm not even there. The manager eventually comes out and ask if I was being assisted, I said no, that I just needed to place a to go order. He instructs the bartender to take my order, again she was dismissive and never acknowledged me. After a few minutes I get up and leave. Get to the parking lot, get in my car and then I see the manager approaching.  He asked me to come back in, I replied no that's okay,  I'll go to another Applebees. He kindly insists and states that's not how we do things. I go back in...to apologize  for the unprofessional and dismissive service I initially received he provides a drink and dessert on the house. Now, I've been to many Applebees,  but can honestly say this was the first time where I encountered a manager that cared about the consumer experience.  I went from being extremely offended to a valued customer all in 30 minutes. The manager, who stated he's been with the company for 27 years made the difference. .. THANK YOU! Now as a customer service consultant and business professor I strongly recommend the two female bartenders be replaced.  In the service business, ""customer service"" is paramount. Unfortunately,  the two female bartenders working tonight lack the professionalism and customer engagement for long term sustainability.  Again, huge thanks to the manager for his professionalism and customer empathy.  Kind regards,  Dr. Sykes"
Tameka A.,"Atlanta, GA",86,59,16,2.0,1/10/2016,"So this was my first and probably last time visiting this Applebees ; the atmosphere was fun and inviting but the service ehhhh not so much! We came in after a busy work week on Friday 1.8.16! I was struggling looking through the menu because I'm not a frequent applebees customer. I would have loved if the waitress would have gave some type of recommendation! She didn't, not even when I asked what did she suggest for a good cocktail...She was very sweet though! She's from Texas, and has the most adorable accent I've heard! It took forever for our drinks to come out, My friend's got their food before mine which was strange because usually they bring all the food out together...apparently my food was sent to the wrong table! The onions were sauteed they were actually pretty RAW, my chicken was tender, and the potatoes were Delish! Overall it wasn't the worst experience, but it wasn't the best. They played really good music though!"
Bob D.,"Acworth, GA",0,16,,1.0,3/5/2017,"Please Yelp, I beg you to let me leave zero stars. 1 star is WAY over rating this place. Walked in the front door as a party of 4 and the disaster started. I see at least 6 empty booths and 2-4 empty tables. The hostess immediately says there's going to b a wait? Why? We're short staffed. Short staffed? On a race weekend? Seriously. Ok, we'll wait. How long is the wait? Answer: until we get a table ready. Uhhh, can you tell me in minutes? Answer: No. Ok, we'll wait. During our ""wait"" I watch the hostess bus a table and that's when I notice a little closer exactly how filthy this place was. Trash all over the floor, multiple tables in need of cleaning. Then I see the ""hostess"" wipe down a table and seats with a rag from the hostess station and place that same rag right back under the hostess station. No water, no cleaner, just a filthy rag at room temp used over and over. Next issue, during our wait, three more parties of four enter, the hostess then takes the last party to arrive to the table she ""cleaned"" just leaving us standing there with no explanation. Next walks in an additional party of three. They just give up on waiting for the hostess to return so they sit in one of the booths that has been empty since we arrived. A waitress brings them menus, takes their orders, brings their drinks and the rest of us are still waiting on the hostess. I watch as 8 people simultaneously walk out the front door. Applebee's is not fine dining but corporate should take a VERY SERIOUS look at this dump. My prayers are with that party of 4 that was still waiting as the other two parties drove off."
Anastasia B.,"Jonesboro, GA",141,18,15,5.0,11/20/2014,"Amazing service and staff!  Stopped in to pick up dinner for the family and was helped immediately!!! The 4 cheese Mac and cheese with honey pepper chicken tenders is the best! I am also in love with the grilled chicken wonton tacos!  Its spicy grilled chicken stuffed in crispy wonton shells and topped with slaw and cilantro!!!! Btw, ask for Jessica, she is everything! !!!"
Kate M.,"Co-op City, Bronx, NY",108,12,8,1.0,5/31/2015,Disgusting service 15 mins waiting to be greeted and when I asked for another table I received an attitude. If you want service with an attitude all are welcome
Tiffini D.,"Albany, GA",0,3,,1.0,4/30/2015,"Terrible customer services, order curbside services it didn't happen, had to go inside and get the food, order a to go coke they didn't have cups, terrible experience"
John D.,"Decatur, GA",31,7,,3.0,4/8/2015,"The sizzling dishes are amazing, though I can't say anything about the dessert that I ordered for my mother because my server said he thinks they're out. I'm assuming he thought I wasn't going to leave much of a tip because I went by myself (I've been a server for 3 years now) so he gave me basic service. I left a 45% tip to show him that you can't always make assumptions about the people who sit in your section. I'll return, but maybe with friends next time."
Ricky H.,"Jonesboro, GA",21,26,3,4.0,11/1/2014,I enjoyed my visit here on last night. Club Applebees is what i will call it in the weekends. The wait for food was a little slow but after all is the weekend. They have the music was blasting like we were in the club. The ambience was pretty cool. I enjoyed our waitress who was pretty cool. The drinks were strong and great. I found out they have karaoke every  other Wednesday. I will check them out and update review.
Brandee O.,"Maricopa, AZ",0,4,17,1.0,4/5/2015,"This place is dark, dingy and dirty. The service is not good. The coffee was disgusting and the Coke was flat. The booth was dirty and we left before we got our food in fear of getting sick. I felt like I had a soar throat from drinking out of the filthy cups. Never eat here. I am surprised Applebee's keeps their name on this building. Gross!"
Desmond M.,"Atlanta, GA",6,63,7,2.0,6/7/2013,"I previously reviewed this restaurant 4 months ago and gave it high praises. Apparently on my return there must be new staff and management because this experience I recently had was nothing to jump about. Ordered spinach dip and the dip was cold when it got to our table and the chips that go with it were stale. I requested fresh chips and warmer dip and the next batch of chips he brought tasted like they were dumped in a basket of salt. I decided I'll work with that because the dip did take off the salty edge. So I ordered a seasonal blue moon beer, which I'm glad I did cause you would have to be a little tipsy to enjoy this evenings service. To keep it simple and to save time I ordered a caeser salad half. I didn't receive my order for another 40 minutes after the ten minutes after the initial arrival of the spinach dip. My waiter was no where to be found and the restaurant was not packed at all! One person at the bar and a few couples and a handful of families. Not enough to daily a salad almost an hour. When it did arrive it tasted good. I couldn't see how you mess up a caeser salad. Once I received my check while I was waiting to cash out I noticed how filthy everything was around me. My seat was dirty. My table had crumbs from whoever was there before. There was used utensils under the table, that I did noticed until my foot kept stepping on them and I didn't want to look anymore into cause there was no telling what else was down there. Paid and left in a hurry.  It will be awhile before I return. At least until I see another good review from somebody else."
Kenya D.,"Fulton, GA",0,4,,1.0,5/27/2012,"I purchased a to-go order from Applebee's at 6608 Tara Blvd., Jonesboro, GA 30236 on 3/25/12 @ 4:49pm.  When I opened the box to eat, I saw something that was totally inedible. This slop should have never left the Applebee's kitchen.   I took the food back to the restaurant manager and asked for a refund ($21.40).  I was told repeatedly that it was their company's policy not to issue a refund.  The manager told me that I could select something else from the menu or receive a gift card for the amount of the purchase.  I told her that those options were not acceptable.    I called Applebee's corporate office and they were no help.  I finally got in touch with Channel 5 (Fox 5 News)-Call for Action Team. They got in touch with Applebee's VP of Operations.  He contacted me and mailed me my refund of $21.40 the next day. I commend the local news' consumer advocates who REALLY fight for consumer's rights.   Don't fall victim to a business who doesn't value you as a customer.  You can choose to spend your money ANYWHERE!  But a business should be grateful when you select them.   If after turning over your hard earned money, you're not satisfied with the product or service, try to resolve the matter directly with the merchant.  If a resolution can't be reached, then I definitely recommend contacting your local news' consumer advocate team for help."
Na L.,"Forest Park, GA",9,75,124,3.0,1/26/2014,"Last time I went, I was being rushed out because our waitress had to get her hours for her manager or something like that. It was pretty rude even though she tried to do it in a nonchalant manner. Other than that, the blonde brownie with ice cream was good and so was the honey pepper shrimp dish."
Sethang M.,"Atlanta, GA",222,7,,2.0,3/14/2015,"The service was fair and decent. I enjoyed the one Patron margarita that I ordered, but I didn't understand why the waitress denied me for a refill for a second drink. I assumed she was joking when she replied, ""no *laughs jokingly*"", but after no refill of my beverage after 30 mins I realized she wanted to regulate my 23 years of age as if she was my mother. If I'm a paying customer who wanted to enjoy drinks, PLEASE cater to my needs. That is all."
Tuarise S.,"Buckhead, Atlanta, GA",8,60,112,1.0,9/24/2012,I visit Applebees on Tara Blvd.about a week ago. The service was bad and the food was terrible. The waitress was very unattentive. We had to keep asking another waitress for help. The worst wings I have ever had. The wings were dry and hard as a rock. I will never go back there again. I am a chef and there is NO WAY I would have displayed or served food that terrible..
Kiara C.,"West Hollywood, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/26/2014,"Very RUDE ! Today is Dec 26,2014 and I decided to call in an order at 11:40pm ..the phone call was answered but I was placed on hold for 10 minutes. Somehow the phone hung up and I called back and was placed on hold again. Once my call was finally taken I politely asked to place an order in for a brownie NOTHING ELSE just that..I was given an attitude , once I explained why it was even later for them to receive my order because I was placed on hold ..the host ( or whomever answered ) responded (in a very rudely manner ) that I couldn't places order and that Applebee's stopped accepting orders at 10pm. Which is fine if that is the truth but I honestly feel like that should have been said earlier in the convo and also in a nicer way ..so I decided not to order because that was very rude of the female whoever was on the clock to answer the phone between 11:40pm - 12:00am (dec 27,2014) . That is NOT a way to treat paying guest over the phone ."
Princess G.,"Port Charlotte, FL",73,22,16,2.0,3/19/2012,"Not much to say except the food could've been ALOT better. I am a frequent at the Applebees establishments in Tampa Bay, FL, and this particular restaurant does not live up to standards. This place is in much need of some staff improvements. They walk around talking amongst themselves, playing around and grouping up in corners when there were customers waiting to be, well, waited on. The only reason I am giving any stars on the rating is because of how fast our food came out. But sadly, as faithful as I am to Applebees, I would never come to this location ever again, or refer anyone to either."
Kris S.,"Forest Park, GA",0,3,3,1.0,12/16/2014,"One of the worst dining experience in my life. Appetizers  was too salty and the entrées  took forever to  come out. I could be much more understanding if the place was packed, but it was not busy at all. After waiting for about 45 mins my food finally came. I'm starving and tired, as I look down on my plate I come across a piece of hair in my food! That's not even the worst part.... I totally understand that it was not my waiters fault that my food had hair in it, so I didn't get mad at him. BUT he made the situation worst by avoiding my table... We waited about 20 mins before he even came back to ask him for a Togo box then another 15 mins for him to actually bring the box and additional 15 for him to come back for the check and another 7 mins to bring us back our card.... Like seriously it was NOT busy. I used to be a waiter so I know what the deal is.  Oh AND when I told another waiter about the hair, she said she would get the manager! But the manager never came! I watched run to her tell her manager and they just completely blew me off like it wasn't a big deal! How do you expect to get business with management like that. The worst management and staff ever.. Bottom line I'm never returning to this location again."
Rod B.,"McDonough, GA",1,11,,3.0,10/23/2013,"Food is generally good.  I only frequent this location for lunch.  Only a three star rating because service is hit or miss.  It is never crowded during lunch, but servers are busy socializing or searching the jukebox for songs to play.  Again, only a few of the servers have these issues and if you visit more than once, you will be able to tell who they are (won't name names)."
Sean R.,"Riverdale, GA",0,1,,1.0,4/4/2010,Can't believe noone has reviewed this place yet. Maybe because it's known that this applebees is the one to stay away from and I was the late one? Either way let me complain a bit real fast. Long story short terrible service though it's really one individual I'm speaking on. Can't remember her name but doubt she's there anymore anyway as she was an obvious racist (Either that or very much against mixed couple relationships). After being seated almost immediatley she came over just as fast asking what drinks we wanted with the worst attitude. Couldn't help but notice 3-4 couples come in after us within a 20 min time frame and get their drinks before we did. Obviously we walked out a lot later than we shouldve. So in conclusion let me say that this spot deserves no money with employees like that so I suggest all stay away and go to mount Zion :)
Mikequita H.,"Fayetteville, GA",19,3,,2.0,3/7/2012,"Some friends and I met her last night after work, After we placed our order we were told we couldn't get drinks until after 7pm cause it was election day. Fine we had dinner anyway. The service was horrible orders were wrong and we were told by the waitress well I didn't make it. We spoke with the manager nothing was done the table behind us complained twice and finally asked for their food to go. We recevied our change and the amounts were all wrong she never returned to the table."
