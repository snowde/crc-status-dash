Sarah M.,"Kalamazoo, MI",127,8,7,4.0,10/27/2017,"This is an okay restaurant. The service is good and the food is good but nothing about it is very unique which is what I really enjoy about my favorite places. Although they do tend to have good deals now and then like a free appetizer when you check in on yelp or for the month of October they had $1 margaritas, yum!"
J M.,"Kalamazoo, MI",0,9,,5.0,1/10/2018,"I rarely go here, but when I have the waitress is always quick and kind.  The atmosphere is friendly and usually hopping.  Ive not had too many bad issues here."
Kimberly K.,"Kalamazoo Township, MI",48,4,,3.0,12/13/2017,"It's Applebee's, it is what is. The food was ok, you know what to expect here. My daughter loves it. The spinach dip is definitely winning."
Madelyn R.,"Kalamazoo, MI",0,5,,1.0,10/7/2017,"I used to come here all the time but they've messed up my food the past 2 times and this time I haven't gotten a single drink refill and I've been done eating for over 20 minutes and the waitress has not brought the check. In fact, she hasn't came by the table once after taking our order. I definitely won't be coming back."
Bob S.,"Oshtemo, MI",139,198,119,2.0,6/26/2015,Fast and a good value. But cookie cutter routine heat and eat meals.   Great for a quick beer with friends. Nice staff too.
Jenna P.,"Grafton, WI",89,9,1,1.0,3/13/2017,"Today for Lunch I decided to go to Applebee's and use the Car-side To Go. I picked up my meal, and went back to work. When I opened my 4-cheese Mac & Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders, I thought it was a joke. I couldn't believe my eyes!!! The entire to-go had about 6 bites and 3 tiny pieces of chicken. It looked like someone scooped up the meal from a left over table, and thru it in the to go container. It was the smallest portioned meal, I have ever seen. My co-worker thought it was my dinner left over from last night. Honestly I couldn't believe it. I get this meal, every time I eat at Applebee's. I am so upset. Now I will be starving all day, until I get home for dinner. Very disappointed!!!!"
Larry H.,"Midlothian, IL",3,25,4,2.0,8/28/2016,Portions are kiddy size at full price rate. Have to increase the portion size to earn my business again.
Paul C.,"Kalamazoo, MI",0,2,1,3.0,1/8/2016,"I am a big Applebee's fan, but recent visits have made me question their mission.  They have a new self ordering system which is confusing and unnecessary, the server is spending too much time showing everybody how the new system works instead of connecting with the customer and doing the ordering for them, which is why people go out to eat. Remember, people go back to restaurants because of a good experience which is often times the result of having a great server. I suppose this new system might work if the servers aren't very good, or if there are a lot of tech-savvy younger customers."
Pam R.,"Clearwater, Tampa Bay, FL",1,64,19,1.0,8/14/2016,"Just thought I'd add this, attempted to email Jasmine and this is an invalid email. Looks like an attempt to make them look responsive, but don't be fooled!"
Rev. Anna P.,"Kalamazoo, MI",7,9,1,5.0,7/31/2015,"OMG! Inever expected the food to be so amazing.  My friend and I used the 2 for $25 offer and with that we got 2 appetizers and we bought a third which we got free because of the Yelp coupon.  I got the French onion soup and he got a salad and then we shared spinach artichoke dip which was filled with ""spectacularness"".... they make their own corn crisps.  Then we got shrimp on the one free Bar appetizer from the Yelp coupon. For dinner I had the Bourbon Steak which was absolutely perfectly prepared and yummy as can be and my friend got a chicken dish which he also said was great. At the end we were too full for dessert and very happy with the price. We will go there again for sure."
Shawn B.,"Mattawan, MI",56,152,115,3.0,7/25/2015,"I'm surprised there are so few reviews since this location has been open quite a while and is in a busy location. Admittedly I've been here dozens of times. It's convenient to where we live and shop. Things I like: menu changes on a regular basis adding new items to try, never a wait, quick service 90% of the time. This visit we arrived around 3 on a Friday afternoon. Were seated right away. Our server took quite a while to stop by our table. Not sure what the hold up was.... A small group of servers and the manager where just chatting at the bar. Eventually she showed up to get our drink order. Got a couple bar drinks which took a pretty long time considering how busy or should I say how not busy they were. Ordered some happy hour apps, only $3 each, nice...but apparently for $3 you get just 4 cheese sticks, not sure that nearly $1 a cheese stick is a good deal, but anyway. Meals, clubhouse grill- good, I like that they have started using real turkey versus pressed lunch meat. Hubby had a burger and said their new burgers were much improved. I wasn't super impressed with this visit, but simply based on location I imagine we'll be back by at some point."
Shannon K.,"Oshtemo, MI",36,2,,4.0,12/21/2015,Server was fabulous.  Manager came around talking to guests.  Had some minor issues with food but they politely fixed it and then it was fine.
Mathew K.,"Kalamazoo Township, MI",172,27,9,5.0,7/17/2014,"We are giving this Applebee's a 5 star review because the people here are amazing! Most chain restaurants don't care about the quality of food or service but Michael Huber the manager and Amit, our waiter, went above and beyond our expectations to take care of us. My wife and I will be back again and again because we appreciate businesses that care about us as customers.  Thank you Mike for being an exemplary leadership example for how to take care of customers and thank you Amit for working hard I make our night great.  Sincerely, Mat Koenig CEO KonigCo The #1 Mobile Marketing Company for Automotive Dealers in the U.S."
Gary C.,"Bloomingdale, MI",0,1,2,5.0,7/4/2014,This place is the best. I recommend the bourbon street steak and the tortilla soup is awesome!
Donald S.,"Kalamazoo, MI",17,21,10,4.0,1/28/2016,"I didnt used to be a fan of applebees but have recently started going back as their food selection appears to have gotten better. The boneless wings are delicious! The atmosphere is kept at a dull roar with the bar being the focal point of the restaurant.  Staff is hjt and miss, recent visit delt with ""alex"" who seemed to have issues making basic change and was pushy when asked questions about selections on the menu. Otherwise its been pretty good."
Ana P.,"Novi, MI",16,81,,2.0,8/26/2012,I'm usually not a fan of chain restaurants anyway but I have been to this location a few times (at the request of others) and each time has been kind of a mess. Orders are constantly messed up and are often served cold (on all occasions people that I am with have had to send back food for either being too cold or being the wrong order.) Granted the staff is always apologetic but just get it right in the first place and it's not an issue. I think they are just lacking in talented cooks/chefs. Also the service is really slow..not the fault of the wait staff but again that can be blamed on the cook line.  I also really wish there were more vegetarian options....or any vegetarian options for entrees for that matter.
Tyler B.,"Portage, MI",24,35,,4.0,3/7/2013,Been to this location a few times (also tried several other locations around town) Have always got fantastic service!  Aside from the 9oz steak being a little small I've consistently been wow'd by the service. I usually sit in the bar where the bartenders are extra friendly/talkative. Tends to be busy but food is good.
Perry B.,"Battle Creek, MI",8,13,1,5.0,8/12/2014,"Always greeted by an energetic host, and sat in a clean booth with the server very close behind.  The server is always attentive to detail and the good comes out hot and as ordered.  I took my friend's six year old daughter here and she loved it.  A great Applebee's for any occasion."
Megan M.,"Temperance, MI",0,3,,5.0,7/22/2015,"Now this place has the best customer service I have ever experienced. You can tell they work really hard at it, which is surprising considering most customers are travelers. Our waiter was outgoing, shook our hands, checked on our table very frequently, and was very genuine. Not only did the manager come by to every table to ask if anyone needed anything, but so did any staff member that was passing by. Truly a great, clean  environment and the food was just a good. The 4 cheese mac and cheese was very popular amongst our table and others surrounding. There is nothing I would change about this place!"
Jason M.,"Lawton, MI",3,59,27,2.0,10/17/2011,"So i'd just done some shopping at the nearby Target and Gamestop, and I was feeling that urge in my stomach.  You know, that urge that can only be satisfied with something nice and cheesy that fits on a bun... yep.  It was cheezburger time.   Not really being in the mood for a fast-food cheezburger, well, I decided to take a shot in one of the few sit-down restaurants.  I chose the neighborhood Applebee's.   Have to admit, though, the place was crowded- and somehow I ended up at my own small table, even though there were couples waiting to be seated.  The table itself was sticky and a few crumbles of cheese were left on it, apparently from the last diner (-1 star for that).  So I get a look at the menu, and order the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, and a cheezburger combo with Mountain Dew to drink. The drink and sticks come first, and I have to admit- they were pretty good.  They'd be better if I didn't have to choke blazing hot cheese down with only a drip or two of liquid while I waited for my waitress to show up with a refill.  That took about ten minutes. (-1 star for inattentive waitstaff)  So, finally, my cheezburger came, and it was actually decent- the fries were almost covered in some kind of tangy cheese-like product- I expect it either to be blue or feta cheese from someone else's dish.  It was okay, I guess. Finally, as I was leaving, I paid with my last $20- hey, dinner was $18, and now the waitress who gave me crappy service is eyeing the pair of ones in my hand like a hungry shark.  When I put them back in my pocket, I get a dirty look.  I'm sorry, but tips are for people who do a GOOD job.  (-1 star for greedy waitress) That leaves us with a rating of two stars.  If you have to come here, at least bother the management to get some Western Michigan gear to put on the wall."
Philip T.,"Portage, MI",1,14,,1.0,10/5/2014,"One would think that after such an awful experience at a restaurant and notification to the Corporate Offices, someone would address the management issue here (or at least the concerns of a former long-time customer) but no one has followed up!  This is sad but even just a little research on Google reveals that this company really doesn't care about customer feedback.  Quite sad."
Jack K.,"Paw Paw, MI",1,30,2,4.0,7/1/2013,Nice service &I like the half price appetizers  at night.
Susan A.,"Kalamazoo, MI",1,5,,4.0,4/16/2011,Great place for a fun dinner that is easy on your budget. Super quality  top shelf margaritas that come in their own shaker from a super friendly wait staff. This is our new date night place rediscovered!
