Stephanie W.,"Polson, MT",0,14,1,3.0,10/1/2017,"Food is mediocre, service was a bit slow, but restaurant was very clean and well kept."
Robert P.,"Boise, ID",1,28,1,2.0,7/27/2017,"Staffing was my issue. A clean and attractive facility. It doesn't work to have bartenders take tables. Bar patrons are left on their own, through no fault of the staff. Food was good. This is a management failure. Staff appropriately."
Maria S.,"Clackamas, OR",0,17,4,5.0,5/21/2016,"Great experience!! Even though they were busy I can see why though because this place was incredible!! Had a great vibe right when we walked in people were very friendly laughing, talking enjoying themselves. Super nice staff, our server was awesome!! Great personality, very attentive to our needs fast friendly service!!  Manager did an excellent job he was going around not just checking on everybody and making sure everything was good and they got what they needed but he was also very caring, entertaining and funny. Food was very fresh so delicious! I would definitely highly recommend this place and I will be back!!"
Tracey R.,"Beaumont, Canada",13,13,5,2.0,8/3/2016,Prefer the 8oz and 6oz wood fired meals. Both steaks were ordered Medium. One came out Rare almost Blue rare at the thickest point and the other came out well done. Sent back to kitchen and re wives two new steaks but we had to keep our veggies et al from first menu. This is my first visit to an Applebee's and will not be back. Had to give two stars cuz the server was very helpful.
Annie F.,"Hazelton, ID",31,1,,1.0,10/12/2016,"This review has nothing to do with food. The food is fine. The service is ABHORRENT. I only (very reluctantly) agree to eat here because my husband likes the piadini. One occasion, we waited in an empty lobby to be seated for a good 10 minutes because the host was MIA. Another visit we waited for nearly 30 minutes to be addressed by a server after being seated as several waitresses walked past repeatedly. Finally one said that she'd go ahead and serve us since the person who was supposed to wasn't. Then we got to listen to them argue about whose section we were in. On this occasion the women's room was out of toilet paper, too. Had my husband not been addressed while I was in the restroom, I would have left immediately. Today one of those servers (who catches our eyes every time because of her abrasiveness - if you're management from Applebee's, it's the one who grew up on a pig farm in the south) was throwing a loud tantrum every time she walked out of the kitchen...something about ""then I'll just take my own food!"" No one wants to hear arguing between employees when they're trying to have a meal. We didn't have silverware at our table, and when I requested it after being served a SALAD, I was told, condescendingly, that she would ""be right back."" The server then cashed out other customers, requested change from another server, etc. while I sat looking at my salad for a few minutes. Get your priorities straight, people!! Unfortunately, the service at the Evergreen Applebee's is just as bad. I'll be making piadinis at home from now on or my husband can find another woman to take to Applebee's. I have ZERO tolerance for BAD customer service."
Greg D.,"Kalispell, MT",0,8,,1.0,2/5/2016,"Save your money and go to famous Daves, it is not perfect either but you do get what you pay for at least. I will not go back to this Applebee's again, paid $15 for a coffee and a salad that you could fit into a regular soup bowl. I asked if the salad was a half salad and the waitress said that corporate was there and they are really watching the portions sizing - really? Well they will no longer have to worry about seeing me there again- we eat at dave's 4 times a month and other restaurants in the area but will never go back to this Applebee's again - never!!!! I have not been to the evergreen location for some time and will have to reconsider going there based on this experience. Oh and once you complain do not expect the waitress to fill your water or coffee again - what a joke."
Ashley H.,"Kalispell, MT",39,24,6,5.0,9/16/2015,"Cali is the cats meow, go during lunch and ask for her. Amazing server with great personality!"
John A.,"Kalispell, MT",15,48,6,1.0,6/16/2013,"I have eaten at this Applebee's many times with friends, and we have had extremely bad experiences. The service is some of the poorest in the Flathead Valley. Our food is consistently late, taking over an hour from the time we are seated until we have food in front of us. And on many occasions, they have brought us the wrong food.  Some of the offenses were very serious, especially in regard to food allergies. We ask that there not be shrimp, and when we dig through we find shrimp (they merely picked off shrimp from an already-prepared dish). They have left nuts when we asked for no nuts, etc.  The worse part is that the servers/waiters/waitresses have shown no remorse nor offered any apologies for the mistakes. Instead, we have been treated as if we are a burden to them.  I really despise this place. I have not had any good experiences here yet. I keep coming with hope that maybe it will change. But tonight may be my last night."
Dale D.,"Spokane, WA",5,3,,5.0,6/9/2015,"My wife and I went to eat, both wanting a steak.  When our meal was delivered the meat was tough and looked like it had been frozen.  It also had a funny taste.  My wife told the waitress and she went to find the manager.  We explained our concern and he agreed with us.  He took our steaks and said he would take care of it.  We were very happy with the two steaks that were delivered to us a short time later.  The new steaks were excellent!  Good service provided by our waitress, and excellent service by the manager.  I highly recommend this place."
Thomas T.,"Prince George, Canada",7,30,,4.0,3/28/2014,Our waiter was incredibly friendly and fast. The food was a little bit above average. The only complaint was that the floors were pretty filthy. They really need somebody to sweep that place.
Nate P.,"Portland, OR",0,7,,3.0,7/2/2015,Food was not as good as other locations.  Food came cold.  Appears to be too few wait staff for customers so they were all really stressed
Mandy F.,"Missoula, MT",1,49,9,2.0,10/11/2015,"Crap food and terrible service.  My food was entirely messed up, but our server was shocked that we weren't pleased, despite me not getting to eat with my family and spending the evening with empty cups"
Jeff V.,"Columbia Falls, MT",0,126,152,4.0,2/10/2013,"Good food at a good price, especially the 2 for $20 deal.  Lots of monitors for watching sports events and a very friendly and accommodating wait staff."
Theresa H.,"Kalispell, MT",0,12,,4.0,2/7/2014,"Ordered carbide to go last night!! The girl was very sweet and our food was still hot when we got home! Never a let down, will always be my favorite lazy day restaurant."
Maria R.,"Lawrence, AR",17,53,8,4.0,9/16/2014,"We actually eat here fairly regularly mainly because they have great deals on the menu  2/$20 which comes with two entrées and an appetizer. They also have low fat and low calorie options that are very tasty. The chicken is always cooked very well  and we like the soups. We like being able to go out for a quick dinner and not have to eat high fat foods and break the bank. The service is always mediocre but not horrible enough to not go back. Once in awhile we get a great waitress but usually they are ""just ok"" a lot of times we have to get up and find someone if we need something. They are always very nice and apologize profusely though."
Mandie H.,"Whitefish, MT",132,347,237,4.0,11/11/2014,"I've been a fan of Applebee's for sometime. I know their food is not homemade and is essentially expensive fast food, but whoever creates their dishes knows what they are doing. Flavor profiles are unique and keep you coming back for more. I've found this particular Applebees to give really decent customer service. And I like the layout, particularly around the bar. My favorite dishes that make Applebees special and unique are the Oriental Chicken Salad and Fiesta Lime Chicken. Can't find anything like them! I've also come to love their lower calorie dishes. They are very tasty and satisfying: Roma Pepper Steak and Napa Chicken and Portabellos, all for between 440 and 550 calories! Recently they've come out with a Thai Shrimp Salad for under 550 calories...and it's great!!  I LOVE the French Onion soup and their Blue Cheese Pecan Wedge salad is fantastic!! I'm also down on their Artichoke and Spinach Dip but I try to stay away from it and any of the fried dishes because they are high in calories, but really good for a reason (great fries, chicken strips, burgers). They have half price apps late night and good deals on a lot of drinks  (double gin and tonic for $5!). I was really impressed by their Carside To Go service. You can download the app, browse the menu, order on the app, pay for it and pick up your food, in as little as 15 mins. It works like magic! App needs some work...but it's a great option. Only thing that prevents me from coming more often is how expensive it is, relative to other fast food joints.....wish they had a loyalty program..."
Jim C.,"Hyattsville, MD",0,9,12,1.0,7/22/2014,What a terrible experience!!!  My team and I got stuck out in the woods with a flat. We finally got out an called to make sure they were going to be open. They said no problem they would wait for us. This was at 1030 pm. They must have headed straight to the door to lock it because we arrived at 1035 and were not let in. I can say I won't be back!!!!  So much for a neighborhood grill
