Reannen Q.,"Waipahu, HI",0,3,,5.0,1/8/2018,This is probably the best experience I had at the restaurant. I was outside the door with my friend deciding where to eat. I wanted something nice and fresh and on the healthy side. Just in the mitts of deciding the applebees restaurant door opened and we were greeted by a young man Davin who is the host!  He welcome us to come in and have lunch he'll have a table ready fairy quick for us. That's when we couldn't refused him after feeling that positive vibe from him.   The menu had a wide selection of ONO picks as I went straight for the lunch combo. I choose thee french onion soup that was very cheesy delisious to start with. Then along with a fabulous combo of chicken salad and a tasty grill clubhouse sandwich. I was super satisfied with everything along with our server who worked at the bar. Awesome service from being greeted by Davin who got us in the door to a great server although I forgot her name. But go to the bar area for a table and look for a small young lady with black hair tied up and i think with some tattoos she's awesome. I'll diffently be returning to eat applebees kapolei again and taking my husband. Mahalos Davin for your awesome energy and aloha at the front door!
Juliana M.,"Kalihi, Honolulu, HI",28,38,12,3.0,1/8/2018,"Dined in at the bar area. We had this one server/bartender who was super helpful, attentive, and polite! Wish I got her name but she was a little skinny Asian bartender with glasses.  And we had this other bartender/server, a light skinned girl with long brown hair. Super RUDE, UNWELCOMING, and SLOW. She would never acknowledge us, (mind you, she served and bartended at the Ewa Beach location too) slow at making drinks, and not attentive.  We got the steak nachos. It was really tasty and fresh, super satisfying and filling!"
AJ D.,"Waipahu, HI",29,15,14,3.0,1/7/2018,"First and probably last visit.  Visited this place on a Friday night without a reservation for a party of 5. The wait was about 15-20 minutes.  We were asked if we were okay with sitting on the high-tops but we preferred the regular table. They were able to seat us on a table by the bar. Before looking through the menu, we had to move from our first table to a table further back because our 5th seat could not block the walkway. Understandable.  Our server started us off with our drinks and appetizers. We were told that they had to wash the cups so our drinks didn't come out right away. The place was not packed, so I don't know how they could run out of cups. We placed the rest of our order after the drinks came out.  Our appetizers were the spinach artichoke dip and bone-out hot buffalo wings. The appetizers were okay. The serving size of these appetizers looked decent for 3 people. By the time we were done with our appetizers, we were more than halfway done with our drinks. It was another 5 - 10 minutes before the rest of our order came out. We had to ask another employee for water because our waitress came back to our table only when our main dishes were served.  When she came back she saw that our drinks needed refills so she went to get us refills. When she brought the refills, she didn't clear the empty glasses that were piling up on our table. These empty glasses weren't cleared from our table at all.  The food was okay. I ordered a steak salad. My steak was cold. I would think that if the steak were cooked at the time I ordered, then it would be hot.  If you want a loaded bake potato, then you have to pay extra for each thing you want on your potato. I believe it was $0.99 each.  When we were done with our entrees, we ordered desert and coffee, and asked for boxes. She brought our boxes but didn't give us a bag. We asked her for a bag 3 times and she still didn't bring it despite walking past our table multiple times. We had to ask another employee for a bag. Our plates weren't cleared from the table until the desert came out. Our cups were still not cleared from the table. So when we were eating our desert, it was a bit of a hassle because we had these cups in the way. We ordered the triple chocolate meltdown for desert. It was good! The cake was warmer than my steak, which made me more disappointed that my steak was cold.  Not to mention, the coffee never came. It wasn't on the bill, so we didn't care to stay any longer.  These employees need more training."
Mel M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",10,133,57,3.0,12/23/2017,"My mother-in-law, who passed away a year ago, absolutely loved shrimp. At the risk of sounding like Forrest Gump's friend, (Benjamin Buford Blue...but everyone calls him Bubba) she loved breaded shrimp, grilled shrimp, shrimp scampi, shrimp cocktail, Creole shrimp, garlic butter shrimp, popcorn shrimp, shrimp tacos, gumbo with shrimp, coconut shrimp, shrimp and grits, shrimp etouffee... So when my wife and I were deciding on where to dine for lunch on a Friday before Christmas, we considered our options on the west side and decided to head out to Applebee's...despite past reviews indicating extremely slow service. We got there around 12:30 and were told it would be about a 30-minute wait! I probably wouldn't have said anything about the wait if it wasn't for the obvious empty tables. I briefly considered heading out somewhere but since my wife and I were stopping by the Nagoya Bakery for some coconut bread (makes awesome French toast!) and to check out last minute shopping deals, we decided to stick with Applebee's. After about 30 minutes, my wife received a call and we were shown our table, a semi-booth with openings on both ends of the table close to the kitchen. It took a few minutes before we were served cold water and it was, who we believed to be, the shift leader who took our order. We ordered the $25 combo meal with the Spinach dip as our appetizer (pretty good) and the Double Crunch Shrimp for my wife and I had the Bourbon Chicken and Shrimp. Someone emerged from the kitchen and served us our appetizer...but instead of going around the tables to serve us the appetizer, he just lazily placed it where it was closest to him and away from us, expecting us to reach over, and didn't say a thing. My wife and I were conversing and could've missed the appetizer had we not seen him. Our server served us the entrees and thankfully made the effort to serve them on our side of the table. The place was a little loud...and the big party with a woman screaming like a banshee at times didn't help. Our meal was actually quite decent and the portions were bountiful...service, however still needs some work."
Ray B.,"Mililani, HI",7,51,167,4.0,12/1/2017,"I've gone to several Applebee's locations on the mainland and was excited when they finally came to Hawaii. They're known for a great family dining experience.  This location is at the Ka Makana Ali'i mall in Kapolei. It's a nice open restaurant. Plenty of seats and TVs for entertaining.  I went for lunch and got seated right away. Staff was friendly and service was quick. There's a great lunch menu available with plenty of choices. I ordered the Bourbon chicken and shrimp sizzling plate, and the fried breaded shrimp with fries.  The Bourbon chicken came out sizzling hot and full of flavor. The breaded shrimp was crunchy and addictive. It comes with your choice of cocktail sauce or tartar sauce. There's a nice side of coleslaw too. We also got Cesar salads and nachos to round out our lunch. Both great additions to the meal.  I will definitely come back to try more lunch specials. Lunch prices are a great value."
Lorilynn L.,"Ewa Beach, HI",150,241,139,4.0,10/22/2017,"Applebee's to the rescue!! After being shut down at 3 other places for outrageous wait times, Applebees was ready immediately to accommodate our party of 6.  We arrived just in time for happy hour, which included half priced appetizers, yessss!! Our server was extremely friendly and we commiserated the football team we both are fans of and our lack of a win season thus far.  The food took a little long to arrive, but when it did, it poured out hot and super delicious. They were kind enough to change the tv station to a game that we preferred to watch and we had an overall terrific experience. Thank you Applebees for a great first visit experience. If you like appetizers and don't mind eating after 9pm, happy hour is awesome!! And they get a bonus star for feeding the tired and hungry six."
Keani H.,"Honolulu, HI",429,11,52,2.0,1/5/2018,"TOO BRIGHT!! Feels like you're eating at a cafeteria. No restaurant needs to be this bright unless it's goal is to turn over that table and get you out the door as fast as possible. It does not have an inviting feeling. The bar area looks promising but i don't wanna get a sun tan from the super high intensity light bulbs. Bad planning.  Host at the door, he had a horrible attitude because he had to clean a table that my elderly grandfather wanted to sit at. The manager had to ask him to clean it after he told us no 3 times. The manager laughed with us after noticing his very open temper tantrum. lol Server got my drink wrong. Not that big of a deal, but at least hustle and get the correct one on the fly (means to hurry up). Not put me back into rotation after the bartender finishes making the entire restaurants drink orders. I care more about cocktails then i do food. My order was a simple patron margarita as stated in menu, she brings me a pomegranate one. ‍ Service is ok. I don't judge a restaurant by any one server, it's not fair to the restaurant. I get that people are people and there is a high possible chance that she won't even be there in 3 months.  Reason for the TWO stars is because this place is not worth going back TWICE. It's just basic, i would have had a better time at a Chili's or Tony Roma's. Attitude and ambiance can make a restaurant great even tho the food is basic.  I would return once the lights go down ."
Ariel N.,"Kapolei, HI",180,100,547,3.0,11/4/2017,"Came here in the evening maybe close to 9 PM. Hostess said the wait would still be around 25 minutes even though there were so many tables everywhere you turn! I guess the just the didn't have the staff to accommodate us, but really it wasn't even that busy at that time. Luckily there were two seats open at the bar and just decided to go with that. First ordered one of their watermelon sangrias which was pretty good and my boyfriend ordered one of their $5 margaritas since it was the late night happy hour. We weren't super hungry at that time and decided upon smaller items such as appetizers. My boyfriend ordered just the plain quesadilla and I got the Thai peanut sauce double crunch bone-in wings. Surprisingly quite tasty. I'd definitely try coming to this location again, but not the kind of place I'd always go to."
jen m.,"Oahu, HI",2,6,5,1.0,1/2/2018,"i don't usually post negative reviews, but i really feel like it's my duty to warn people about this one because it was literally the worst restaurant experience i've ever had. never been here before, and didn't check the yelp reviews because i figured it would be standard fare american chain stuff like chili's, outback, etc.  place was empty yet it took over 30 min to get our food. when we got our plates, omg, it was the saddest looking thing. portions for little babies!! i wish i had taken a picture of the 'pepper crusted sirloin and whole grains' dish that was ordered. it was like the tiniest piece of overcooked meat you can imagine over the tiniest bit of grains and veggies. that was like $17!   i do have a picture of my supposed 'clubhouse grille' sandwich and 'french onion soup' which helps give you an idea. the sandwich was the saddest looking thing and had literally zero bacon and chicken inside. i had to call over the waiter like um, there's no bacon inside.. i didn't even care about the chicken already. he came back 5 minutes later with a plate with 3 strips of bacon for me to assemble myself.  the soup was cold and congealed like it had been sitting for a long time.  we never got our water refilled even once and the waiter literally came by just to say 'ready for the check?' didn't ask if we wanted dessert or anything. the waiter had no pleases, no thank yous. no have a nice day. it's just as well as i was horrified and wanted to just get out of there as fast as possible.  run far, far away!! ‍idk who's managing this place, but either they're trying to trick people into paying $17 for a plate of nothing and get away with it with enough people or they're just seriously lacking the ability to run a restaurant."
Chauncy W.,"Honolulu, HI",214,12,8,1.0,12/27/2017,"Unreal! Arrived around 7pm for dinner. We ordered our appetizers and entrees after being greeted by our server Cheyanne. Waited about 10 mins for our water to arrive which confuses me cuz I've been to many places and water is always the first thing that's on the table. 10 mins later... A man, who looked like the manager, asked if we've been served and we told him ""yes we have sir"". Cheyanne our server comes back apologizing for the delay and that the food would be out shortly. While we waited, we noticed that there were a bunch of food on the counter that looked ready to eat. The manager was there talking to the cooks. Couldn't he just simply put the MAN in MANager and help delivering those meals? While he was there ""managing"" we had to wait another 15 mins for our food to arrive. Here's where it became unacceptable for me as a customer to experience. First: Cheyanne and another server brought out our appetizers and entrees which baffled me cuz appetizers are supposed to come before the entrees. Second: Cheyanne accidentally spilled some salsa right by my feet as she brought me my steak quesadilla. I felt sorry for her at first because clearly she's under a lot of pressure. She apologized and said that she'll get another salsa cup for us. No problemo. (At first) Third: Our appetizers were cold. If they brought it out when they first finished it then it'll be nice and hot for us to enjoy. Fourth: That spilt salsa that I mentioned before, it was still there on the floor even after I finished my meal. How could this happen? I had to lean my foot out in front of it just so everyone else, especially children couldn't slip on it. A lot of the employees walked by it, even Cheyanne, yet no one didn't tend to this safety hazard. Lastly, as we complained about our experience to the staff, we found out that we weren't the only ones going through it this evening. Apparently two other tables right next to us were displeased with the service. It gotten so bad that one of em even told Cheyanne to return the food to the kitchen because of how long he had to wait. I've never been to an Applebee's before. This was my first time in one because I'm a born and raised country boy and I barely go into a restaurant like this. Yet being here just didn't live up to the standards of what I thought Applebee's could've been like from what I've seen in their commercials. The staff needs to work on their service skills and they need to be more on it. I didn't intend to write a one star review to complain but I hope that the company reads this post and hopefully learns from me and many other had experienced."
Gabrielle G.,"Honolulu, HI",99,72,91,5.0,10/28/2017,"I thought this place was pretty good for the price and amount of food you get. We came on a Wednesday and got seated right away, I was pleased that it wasn't very busy.  The place is clean with cool light up decor, a bar, and lots of TVs to catch a game or fight.. a plus for my fiancé. They have a lot of two entree deals with lots of choices for even as low as 20.00 or so! Some of them even include an appetizer! We got free chips and salsa for checking in on yelp, mozzarella sticks for our appetizer.. super generous serving of like 12 sticks. I got the cedar grilled chicken, one of the healthier choices and it was packed with a ton of flavor. I was really surprised since it was such a deal and it being healthy how delicious it was. The quinoa had cranberries and nuts, it was a good contrast with the lemon chicken. The fiancé got the bourbon street chicken and shrimp that came extra hot on a grill plate and was also super delicious with loads of buttery garlic flavor. I couldn't stop picking at his plate! I think what impressed me the most is the chicken on both our entrees were so moist and tender.. not like the usual dry chicken breast. Definitely want to come back here again!"
Veronica L.,"Ewa Beach, HI",441,227,739,3.0,9/23/2017,"Just like the restaurant in Ewa, the food at Applebee's has come a long way since the early 2000s.  My mom likes coming to this location instead of Ewa (where we live) because she says the wait time is shorter.  I guess I can agree. Plus, if you go when the shopping center is open, there is much to do while you're waiting. Not sure about the Ewa location, but this one will text you when your table is ready. They also offer free Wi-Fi in addition to Ka Makana Ali'i's free Wi-Fi. Service is hit or miss here, just like their other location. Mostly, the staff is nice but it's the poor service that undermines their friendliness.  Both locations are fairly small, but this one may be a bit larger. It's very clean inside and there is ample parking at the shopping center.  Regardless, I will continue coming back as I do enjoy the food."
Kaylin W.,"Kapolei, HI",0,6,2,1.0,12/19/2017,"Ordered takeout. Chicken tenders basket, chicken quesadilla and classic bone in buffalo wings. First off, they forgot to give me my fries that's supposed to come with the tenders. I called them right when I got home to let them know they should double check their take out orders next time so this won't happen to someone else and just got an apology. Then, their chicken tenders and even chicken wings taste like it's been fried so many times. I paid about $40 for this. I'd say save some money, go to the store and buy the ingredients and attempt to make these appetizers yourself. It'd probably taste better!"
Elsa L.,"East Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",40,15,8,1.0,12/2/2017,"Pros: appetizers tasted as it was described Cons:  1) slow service 2) if u have to flag someone to get napkins and refills, there's a problem 3) ordered firecracker shrimp pasta, w/c was described as having sriracha creamy sauce. It had no sriracha at all. Bland and shrimp was overcooked 4) honey pepper chicken pasta- bland. The kraft mac/cheese tastes better than this 5) sirloin- tough, even at med rare 6) ribs- dry, overcooked Maybe the chefs/cooks were having a bad day, but i don't think we'll be back here."
Jan K.,"Waianae, HI",103,349,2574,3.0,8/21/2017,"AB - Updated. (2.5 stars). ""Dear Mrs. Applebee, I've gotta get somethin' off my chest!!"" - David Garrick (Dear Mrs. Applebee) After some coaxing to give AB another try, I did. I decided to update my review because I did have a much better experience the second time around!! But I do have to get something off my chest Mrs. Applebee!! The food here is very underwhelming and even with the HH prices, it doesn't excuse the quality... Not to me anyways. I went in to have an adult beverage and told myself that was all I was going to have... Umm, I ended up having 5... Hmm, Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol?!! :) That led me to the decision of ordering off the bar HH menu since it is cheap enough... I ordered the following: -Double Crunch Wings -Steak Quesadillas Double Crunch Wings - $6.25 (HH). (2.5 stars). Kristina, the bartender, was wicked awesome and allowed me to order my wings naked and get all the sauces on the side! I had a choice of Honey BBQ (which was decent), Hot Buffalo Sauce (very vinegary), Spicy Sweet Asian Chile Sauce (sweet but decent), and Thai Peanut Sauce (a little watery and not a very noticeable peanut flavor). This dish is cheap, I get it, but my wings tasted like they were fried over and over AND OVER again. Meaning... it was fried once. Then probably fried again. Then fried yet again?? The coating was literally disintegrating in my mouth as I bit into each wing. Ugh. I suppose since I had a few drinks that I ate about half of them just out of sheer hunger but I can't say it was great. I will definitely ask for naked wings and the sauces on the side if I order these wings again... which I'm sure I will when the BF is around! Steak Quesadillas - $5.75. (2.5 stars). Extremely cheap for the portion size. The tortilla was nice and crispy! To be fair, the menu does say that the quesadilla has pico de gallo in it but I just felt there were too many raw onions for me. Just personal preference. The steak was cut up into bite size cubes and was tender so that was a pleasant surprise. The salsa verde had a decent flavor with garlic and cilantro being the highlights. I didn't taste any heat which was a little disappointing. The salsa was awful! It tasted like tomato and onion water. That's it!! There was no flavor whatsoever and it was extremely watery. I asked for sour cream on the side and that was my favorite part!! I love sour cream. This quesadilla doesn't have very much filling but the cheese was melted nicely. I would order this again but ask for the pico on the side. --- All in all, the food was a little better the second time around!! Kristina definitely made my visit worth it. She treats each customer how she would want to be treated which is rare in this day and age!! I'm glad to see the GOLDEN RULE still exists!! Kristina is the main reason why I will be back to AB in the future. Well that and they do have a decent selection of beers on tap like Guinness!!!!"
Nicole E.,"Kapolei, HI",16,53,4,2.0,11/25/2017,"Decided to stop by here on a Tuesday evening. We were a little weary after reading all the reviews, but gave them the benefit of the doubt.  As soon as we walked in there was no hostess, or no greetings from any of the staff. A waitress saw us, and ran in the back where I assume she called for the hostess. The hostess came out, in no rush and walked over to us (I think her name was Sylvia). She had no smile or any kind of friendly demeanor. She sat us quickly and walked away. It was already off to a poor start, but fortunately our waitress was great. She was super sweet and bubbly and made up for the rude hostess.  However, our food was a different story. We ordered the spinach dip, and when it came out the chips were hard and the cheese on the top of the dip was solid. It was as if it had been sitting around a while after it was melted. I ordered the honey bbq ribs, and it was the toughest ribs I've ever eaten in my life! No joke! Even the huge steak knife they gave to me couldn't cut it. The flavor was decent, but I had a difficult time finishing it as it took me 5 minutes to just cut one rib off. My baked potato was the not even close to being baked. They cut it in half, and it was still completely solid! I tried to mash it a little with my fork but it did not budge at all.  I don't think I will be returning back to this restaurant."
Tyesha J.,"Laurel, MD",101,1,,5.0,1/9/2018,Emma was amazing!!  I came in today and she made excellent suggestions all around!  Friendly staff and exemplary service
Keoni C.,"Aiea, HI",101,19,45,2.0,12/29/2017,"ok, so not something u would see from a franchise that JUST opened. waited way to long(over 30min.) for drink order, a draft sam adams, coke and a water. had to REORDER said drinks for it to come 10min later(after reorder). Not really that busy, we had a party of 8. I understand the kitchen being backed for food order, but drinks, and servers being attentive to their zones is messed up. Honestly, food as subpar for the price and wait. Im just so dam hungry that i didnt really give a sh*t. if u just want a place to eat, and somewhere to sit down. then ya, AppleBees kapolei is ok."
Courtney M.,"Honolulu, HI",245,12,9,1.0,11/5/2017,"Waited for over half an hour with a practically empty restaurant. They didn't have enough menus for my party of 6 and we went throughout our appetizers with no utensils or napkins. We waited over an hour for our food with 2 very hungry children. The kids fries were hard & cold, our steaks very over cooked and lukewarm.  I get that there isn't a lot of waitstaff but that should make you want to have better food service & not have hungry, anxious patrons eating cold food.  Ordered some of their specialty drinks & was presented with a different version of the same drink each time.  There was a lot of waiting & a lot of inconsistencies & disappointment for the high hopes we had of this mainland chain."
Keola M.,"Kapolei, HI",3,46,83,4.0,8/4/2017,"Our server was very friendly hence the one star but, other than that service and food quality was below average. We decided to order from the 2 for $30.00 menu which includes one appetizer and two entrees.  Of course, we had to do the spinach and artichoke dip for the appetizer, unfortunately Chili's set such high expectations Applebee's fell beyond short.  Stale chips and a condiment side portion of salsa, I wasn't mad it wasn't ""bottomless.""  Almost 40 minutes later our main entrees made it to the table.  I had the cedar lemon chicken and my kāne had the spinach + artichoke chicken cavatappi.  Good food but, not great and given the portion of chicken to mac & cheese we paid for overly priced kids meals. Not to mention 20 minute intervals for drink refills.  Our server thought someone refilled our drinks and after we finished our food came to the realization no one did.  Then over 15 minutes to get a box and bill, I honestly thought they really don't want customers to return. Wouldn't you!?! To be fair, it is one of the newer restaurants and a majority of the staff appeared to be first time servers.  Not saying we'll never go back, but, it's definitely not our first, second, third, fourth, or fifth choice (if you know what I'm saying) when deciding on where to go for dinner. AUGUST 2017 UPDATE We actually wanted to go and eat at Moena for dinner but apparently between 3:00-5:00p (don't quote me I may be off by an hour) only pupus are served and we were HUNGRY.  So, after walking to CPK and being quoted about an hour wait and wanting to just enjoy a nice sit down dinner we reluctantly went back to Applebee's which ended up being a great choice! At Applebee's all of the appetizers are 1/2 off from 3:00-6:00p we ordered EVERYTHING, again, we were hungry.  This time the service was awesome and I will attribute it to the server she was friendly, attentive, and we were served in a timely manner.  My kane enjoyed his brunch burger and the BBQ brisket tacos I had were sooooo ono!! I also have to give the onion rings an honorable mention, battered and crisped perfectly!!   Giving them four stars despite my previous one star review for the complete turn around in quality and service."
Asami K.,"Honolulu, HI",91,2,2,1.0,12/28/2017,"This was my first time at an Applebee's but it was a very irritating and frustrating experience. We had a party of 5 but 3 of us are servers at other restaurants so we are generally really lenient with mistakes and we usually tip well; but our experience at Applebee's was simply unacceptable.  When we got seated, we didn't get utensils. For drinks, I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita and it was a very watered down margarita in a tall glass. Never seen a margarita in a tall glass. We also ordered a watermelon sangria but it had blackberries in them. Another person ordered a blackberry sangria but guess what? The blackberry sangria had no blackberries! The bartender needs to get it together. Geez.  When we got to our appetizers, the chips we got for the artichoke dip were basically crumbs probably from the bottom of the bag. I suppose the other apps we got were okay though. No issues with those. But once we got to our entrees, they forgot to put sauce on one of the burgers, they forgot my boyfriend's order of onion rings, my half rack of ribs were really burnt, pretty sure they didn't put any salt or pepper into my mashed potatoes, and we also got the bottom end of a whole lettuce in our salad.  We wanted to get desserts, but we just thought we'd go elsewhere because we knew they were gonna screw it up again.  So we asked for the check and of course, they charged us for the onion rings and cheese that we didn't get. So I asked for the manager and when I complained to her about all those things, she said ""so what do you want me to do? Give you more chips for your dip?"" And that just made me snap. I asked for her to comp something off of our check. There's no way I'm leaving this restaurant without something for this terrible food and service.  Might give them another chance in the far future when they get their shit together. But other than that, I'd be really careful of ordering any steak or chicken from them. You just might get food poisoning or something from them."
Angel H.,"Honolulu, HI",971,834,7664,4.0,7/20/2017,"When I had lunch here with the hubby everything was on point. The server was nice and kept refilling our drinks. The only complaint was that it took 30 minutes for us to get our food.  It was my first time at Applebee's, and I liked it better than the other restaurant chains. We started off with the double crunch bone in wings with honey bbq sauce. I would agree with the name, double crunch. Even though it was drenched in sauce, it was still super crunchy. The sauce was yummy. I ordered the half rack honey bbq ribs. I really liked it. It was fall off the bone tender. I got the garlicky green beans with bacon and garlic mashed potatoes as my sides. I'm not a fan of green beans but this one was delicious. It was cooked just right. I don't like it mushy and I don't like it crisp, it has to be right in the middle.  My husband got the four-cheese mac & cheese with honey pepper chicken tenders. He asked for it without bacon and they obliged. He really enjoyed this dish. The four cheeses melted into a gooey goodness. The chicken tenders were crispy and coated with a delicious sauce."
Kevin P.,"Orlando, FL",2,3,,4.0,1/7/2018,Great place to have a few drinks and watch the Game!!     Food is good but the atmosphere is great!!
Kimberly Marie B.,"Waipahu, HI",265,42,79,3.0,6/25/2017,"I've been going to Applebees since they first opened in Kapolei. As a note, I try to eat at a restaurant a few times before I write my reviews so that I can give the place a chance. So, here goes. I've eaten at Applebees several times, and for the most part it's been great. However, as times passes, the food quality starts to go down. Which is unfortunate. The last meal I got was the shrimp stir fry and it was cold when I got it. My husband's steak was also cold, and was overcooked. He had asked for a medium/rare. So if you're going for the food, you may or may not disappointed. But the one thing I can praise about this restaurant is the fact that the bartenders are absolutely amazing. They are so attentive and very friendly. If it wasn't for them, my husband and I wouldn't go back.  I hope they fix their issues regarding the food, because other than that the staff and atmosphere get an A+"
Pili S.,"Honolulu, HI",79,51,147,5.0,10/11/2017,Used the Yelp app to redeem free chips and salsa...they gave us a refill...for FREE.  Military discount applied to rest of bill!!!
Mike M.,"Honolulu, HI",74,118,363,5.0,6/10/2017,"Had a great time here tonight!  My wife and I came during peak dinner time 6-7ish on a Friday night. Immediately greeted at the door by the host, something that really makes a great impression. I'm quite amused with the harsh reviews here. Again, I believe unrealistic expectations and just nasty attitudes unfortunately dwindle the ratings of a place like this. This isn't a hole in the wall nor is it a fancy pants fine dining place either. Quit being cheap and quit expecting to be treated like royalty. Anyhow, continuing with my review! Place is very spacious with a lot of wiggle room. The decor is very industrial and modern. Along with the ambiance, this place was also very clean! TVs galore, perfect place for sports watching with beer drinking and app eating. This place will be a mad house when the NFL is back! Prices I believe were VERY reasonably priced with the various mix and match options. Take a look at the photos of the menu I posted to see what I mean. You either have to have no understanding of food costs or just pretty hungry to think the portions don't match prices. They also half priced apps and beer specials TWICE A DAY! The value is quite unprecedented so for people to call this place a rip off are really outta touch with reality. (Sorry not sorry) The food came out really hot and fresh. I'm quite timid with the quality of food with chain restaurants yet I was not disappointed one bit. The 2 of $12 apps we chose were the Chicken Tacos and Spinach Artichoke Dip. Both apps came out very fast, served hot, crunchy and packed with flavor! We also ordered a burger stuff with pickles, bacon and onions. Opted to go with onion rings vs fries. Burger had a good char to it, the bun used had a very good firm texture to it, crucial to making a burger that much better.  Our server RHEA hit on all the right points when serving my table. Proper introduction, very welcoming, available for any questions and requests, table always bussed, drinks constantly topped off. VERY WELL DONE! Nothing but great things to say about this location. Please keep up the great work and we'll keep coming!"
Kirsty D.,"Hampton, VA",34,9,3,1.0,12/6/2017,"If you are really into salt this is the place for you. Seriously we were there three hours ago and can still taste it!  Served us tepid chewy fries, when I told the server she said ""oh ok"" so I asked for new ones and did get some. But the chicken tenders were so salty, the BBQ sauce was salty and the fries, well, yeah, they also were salty. My daughters Mac n Cheese was Easy MAC...  Slow bored waitress with about four tables full so no reason why. Wanted to try to check if it was as bad as other Applebee's in the USA. Got confirmation. Don't waste your money."
Mikiala C.,"Ala Moana, Honolulu, HI",20,78,64,3.0,5/27/2017,"Surprisingly I found the food not as bad as the reviews make it out to be. We got a variety of appetizers: Chicken tacos Spinach and artichoke dip Buffalo boneless wings Chicken tortilla soup French onion soup Caesar salad  The only thing that skewed my overall opinion of this place was how uninformed the staff seems to be. For somewhere I'd consider to still be new, Management didn't seem to be around. Runners kept bringing the food to the wrong tables. Empty plates were never removed from our table. It was just overall ""in the weeds"" as those in the industry would describe. Hidden in the back of the drink menu you'll find appetizers are half off from 3-6pm daily as well as 9-close. The staff does not promote it nor tell you about it. When I asked, the waitress replied ""ya everything but the classic combo and ""build your own"". My family decided we didn't see anything we really wanted on the entree portion of the menu so we decided to choose a few appetizers here and there. In our selections we chose a few soups and small salads. Later in our bill we found out they weren't half off. Which isn't really a HUGE deal but when we questioned our server she said ""oh and the soups and salads aren't half off either"". (Which both are listed on the appetizer menu) Knowledge about the menu is priority, and giving wrong information out, in the right circumstance can risk you a bigger complaint."
Sandy H.,"Mililani, HI",0,2,8,1.0,12/2/2017,"I've eaten at Applebee's at different locations across the continental US and thought there was a corporate standard.  I was sorely mistaken.  This doesn't even rate a 1/2 star. 1.  Checking in for dinner when the half of the tables were unoccupied, I was told there would be a 30 min wait.  When pointing out the obvious, I was told that they were expecting 3 large parties of 5, 4 and 7 (large, really?) and the kitchen couldn't keep up.  (Big hint should have been all the unbused tables.) 2. Checking back in 30 min later, they had to clean a booth to seat us.  (Remember, restaurant is half full.). We sat, and the table was greasy.  Hostess said she'd bring our utensils. 3.  Ordered our salads and waited 40 minutes to be delivered.  Server had apologized for the wait and that their manager would deliver our meals.  They were delivered without comment or utensils and we had to ask for them.  I specifically asked for chopsticks, the manager said okay, and came back with fork and knife.   4.  My Thai Shrimp Salad (tagged as healthy, lighter fare) consisted of about 3 ounces of cole slaw mix with 3 sprigs of cilantro DROWNING in peanut dressing with sliced almonds and maybe 6 small shrimp.  It was hard to eat.  It's a good thing I filled up on lemonade. We started the whole process at 7:00 and left at 9:00.  No shopping at the mall as the stores all closed."
Lika G.,"Wahiawā, HI",24,150,187,4.0,10/16/2017,I think this is a great family place and I am so glad Apple b has finally come to Hawaii. My first time here and I was pleasantly surprised. They have great deals here and the prices are so reasonable. The food was great so many choices we had a hard time deciding. We ordered way to much but was happy to take home the left overs. I would definitely come back.
Jam A.,"Ewa Beach, HI",460,144,1371,4.0,4/25/2017,"This restaurant just opened in Kapolei, it is  located in the back of the mall, across the street from 24 hour fitness.   My 24 hour gym friends and I wanted to go out for drinks after our hard workout. I know, not something you should do after working  but it  was Aloha Friday and that's my excuse.   We arrive just at the time the restaurant opened, so there was no wait. The restaurant opens at 11 AM, that is also the same time  their happy hour starts.  We sat near the bar and our sever was the bartender.  He quickly greeted us with menus and Cold water. He was super friendly and he kept our drinks flowing.  They offer a variety of drinks and three appetizers to chose from on their happy hour menu. The drinks range from $5 to $7 dollars. The appetizers are half off their normal price, which ranged around $6 to $7  dollars.  I loved my Margaritas but their version of the long island ice tea was the favorite at my table.  We orders  2 orders each of the three Appetizers, the boneless wings, steak quesadillas and a spinach and artichoke dip. Appetizers are on the smaller side but all delicious.   I did get to look at main menu and they offer a variety of dishes that I will be coming back to try."
Rachel C.,"Wahiawā, HI",146,134,691,4.0,10/11/2017,"Days after coming back from a trip, my bestie and I planned to meet for lunch so I could tell her all about it.  We were deciding on a place to meet. Bestie: Hmm, how about Applebee's? They just opened and I've never been...have you? Me: Ooh that sounds good!  Nope I haven't been there yet.  Where are they located? Bestie: There's one that just opened in Ka Makana Alii.  Me: Perfect! Brought my boyfriend along, and the three of us arrived to Applebee's in the afternoon.  The place was busy, but not packed that we were seated within five to ten minutes.  We started with chips and salsa, which came with both red and green salsa.  The portion seemed small for three people, but was enough for us to munch on before our meals.  Thanks to Yelp, this is free with check-in and it's refillable!  For some reason, I was craving for a burger so I ordered the American Standard.  I also added the House Salad.  It seemed liked a lot, covered with croutons, cheese, tomatoes and cucumbers. As for my burger, it was thick and huge!  I ordered my beef as medium-rare, which was recommended.  It was juicy and tender. However, it was salty and greasy.  I could taste the butter from the bun and it was overpowering. I tried to eat it all, but could only do half. I also got their Raspberry Iced Tea to drink.  It was refreshing and has the perfect amount of sweetness. My boyfriend ordered the Classic Combo. It was perfect because it's a sampler of the appetizers all in one plate. He enjoyed his dish.  I got to try some of the items from his plate: spinach and artichoke dip, mozzarella stick and boneless wings.  They were all so delicious. I had one bite of each since I was full from my dish lol. My bestie ordered the Four-Cheese Mac + Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders. She enjoyed her dish as well and ate all of it.  I tried the Mac + Cheese, and it was very creamy and rich.  Overall, we had a good experience.  We enjoyed our food. Our server was friendly and attentive, consistently checking on us and refiling our drinks.  Prices are reasonable.  The atmosphere reminded me of Chili's.  It's a nice place to relax and catch up with friends."
Metitirani L.,"Waipahu, HI",12,4,9,1.0,12/2/2017,"Our server was very attentive BUT the food Quality was TERRIBLE and DISGUSTING! Appetizers arrived 15min and waited 45-50min for our main entree, only to be served cold 4 cheez mac/cheese, Full rack of ribs was burnt and dry on dirty plates and utensils!! We decided NOT to touch it and asked for the manager to let her know of their food quality. NEVER AGAIN at this location!"
Terrance L.,"Mililani, HI",89,1,1,5.0,12/14/2017,"First time here and already an awesome experience from the moment we entered with a greeting and quick seating from Jamie. Service was superb Cheyanne, Mal, and Chelsea was fast, friendly, and professional! Awesome Teamwork! Mahalo!"
Destin C.,"Kapolei, HI",11,34,123,2.0,9/23/2017,"A friend told us that she had a bad experience but we've never been to Applebee's so we wanted to try it out. The service was ok, not great and the food could definitely use some help. With exception of the chicken wonton tacos which was quite tasty. That's the only reason we're being more generous with the rating.  My wife ordered the three cheese mac and cheese and I ordered the chefs special steak. Both dishes lacked flavor and did not live up to the description on the menu. We also got a couple drinks; Bahama mama for the wife (which was way too sweet) and I got a Sam Adam's Boston lager. Nothing to say about the beer for obvious reasons.  We wanted to try a dessert as well hoping to end on a good note but even that fell short. We ordered their chocolate molten cake which would have been ok had it not been for the excessive fudge drizzled over the plate. Not sure if we'd go back. Maybe we'll give them more time to adjust and perfect their menu. Hopefully someone on their staff engages with reviewers and uses their comments to better their business."
Rae B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",82,5,,2.0,1/2/2018,Food was mediocre my sizzling plate did not sizzle. Server was good. Manager was not helpful. Would not come back was too loud from young drunk Boys at bar
Wesley A.,"Mililani, HI",277,46,55,3.0,10/27/2017,Applebee's restaurant at Ka Makana Alii Shopping Center in Kapolei Hawaii. We ate lunch here. We looked at the menu and the prices are moderate $$-$$$ we tried the appetizer sampler and it was pretty good nothing to write home about standard American fare no imagination to the menu. The inside of the restaurant is spacious I like that big windows you're not too cramped or crowded. A lot of TVs there to watch if you get bored. Staff is nice and friendly. Applebee's is a once-in-a-while place not like Zippy's word Zippy's that everyday kind of place and Zippy's is very reasonable. As far as we're concerned Applebee's is an average place with the average menu American style food.
Kimberly V.,"Mililani, HI",79,32,70,1.0,12/23/2017,We showed up on football Sunday for lunch and we had to wait 30 minutes for a table and the place was half empty. We were told that some of the sections were closed because of the sunlight making it too hot?!?!?! Our food took over an hour and to try and make up for it they brought out chips and salsa. They screwed up on our order when it finally came and the food wasn't even hot so it obviously was sitting. I think they should have staffed properly for a football Sunday. We will never return and will surely spread the word that this particular location is not worth it.
Aimee H.,"Aiea, HI",500,277,3263,2.0,7/27/2017,"Have you ever been to a restaurant and was told there was a wait to be seated but when you looked around there were lots of empty seats? I hate that! So before I begin, let me give you the scenario. We had tried the Applebees in Ewa over a year ago. The service was horrible, the food was not very good. I was absolutely disappointed! So, I said that I would never go to another one again. Well, after watching a movie with the hubby we decided to get something to eat. I decided to give Applebee's another try. Different location, maybe different experience. As we walked in, we were told that there was a wait to be seated. As I looked around, there were lots of empty seats. Now, don't get me wrong, I get it that servers are assigned to sections and sometimes there are not enough servers scheduled to cover all areas. But right after we sat at the bar to wait for our table, they seated people in some of the empty seats!!! Once seated at a table, we were never served any water, food took long to come out, food was mediocre, I was charged almost $10 for a shot of grey goose.......disappointed once again!!!    The only reason for the 2 stars is because the manager was nice enough to accept a gift certificate from the other applebees that was already expired! That was very kind of her.     Don't think I will be giving applebee another try no matter what location it is in!!!!"
Christine H.,"Ewa Beach, HI",6,56,23,5.0,9/9/2017,"This was our very first visit to an Applebees. I've really been hesistant to go because of mediocre reviews. But, I figure I give it a try when I did my first visit to Ka Makana mall. We arrived a few minutes before they opened and when they did, they were prepared for the people. I was happy with where they sat us which I'm sure they put us there with our stroller in mind.  Our server Sasha (Sashana on the receipt) was very attentive. She was so friendly and courteous! Sasha quickly took our drink order (water) and brought it to our table right away. She asked if we were ready to order but, I told her it was our first time so we needed a bit to review the menu (and feed our baby) and I would let her know when we were ready.  The menu was easy to navigate and I couldnt help but notice the prices. Very reasonable! We ordered the classic appetizer which came with a lot of food! All very good and it came HOT!  Thank goodness we didn't order our actual lunch until after the appetizer was brought to us because I seen it and was like... um yeah. I'll just have some fries. Lol. Sasha was amazing to explain the whisky burger my husband got and when he asked for onion rings she made sure he was ok with the up charge and that it was 5 pieces. She also asked if I wanted my fries now instead of waiting. Thankfully she asked... if she did bring it later with my husband's food, I wouldn't have eaten it as I would be full from the huge appetizer! Sasha was on point with refilling our drinks and she took very good care of us. It made the experience a great one and I would hope my experience would be the same when we return.  Even if you feel like their food is mediocre or great, the service really does make a difference. And that's what made this review a 5 star instead of a 2 or 3 like other people. Thank you Sasha for making this a great experience. We had good laughs together and enjoyed the brief conversations."
