Camille K.,"Honolulu, HI",7,1,,1.0,6/11/2017,"Can you rate a restaurant zero stars?? This was the first time here for us, first time to the mall for me. My friend checked in and was told the wait would be 45 min. They would text when our table was ready. We went back then, no text. We looked at the menu, still no text. After more than an hour wait, we asked how much longer. It was only then that we were told the kitchen was backed up and they weren't seating anyone yet. So we decided to eat at CPK instead. There was no wait for outside seating, and the service was great! Even a manager came by to check on how everything was for us. Unbelievably, after more than an hour and a half, we were texted from Applebee's. That was just horrible service for making us waste our time for nothing!  P.S. I've eaten at the Ewa location and it was fine. There was a wait, but ultimately even shorter than what I was told."
Karen C.,"Aiea, HI",35,38,35,2.0,6/29/2017,"This location is new & appeared to be fully staffed but the food took really long for over a half empty restaurant on a weekday. The server forgot to replenish our tortilla chips & salsa so there was a long period of wait between a second round & our meal being served. Food was good, everyone seem to have enjoyed it. Since the establishment in this location is new I'm sure they're trying to figure things out so hopefully the next time we will see an improvement."
Tim S.,"Honolulu, HI",26,10,2,5.0,8/31/2017,Always great food.  Prices as well as service as are better when you sit at the bar. Also very friendly bartenders. Don't forget this and you won't regret it.
Jennifer L.,"Penn Valley, CA",0,2,2,1.0,6/10/2017,Absolutely horrible from start to finish. We waited 45 minutes for our Caesar salads. Our food came out 10 mins later but our daughter waited an additional 10 mins for her meal. Our son got the fish and chips and they were swimming in grease. The attached pic was from my husband patting off one fish. The manager did comp the fish and chips but by then the damage was done! Save your money and your stomachs and go somewhere else!
TK A.,"Honolulu, HI",282,16,1,1.0,6/8/2017,"Where do I even start? This was our first time here. First they don't welcome us and then they seat us far away from where other customers are sitting.  Second we are not even acknowledged by any server. Third, they seat another family after us but in the middle area where majority of the customers have been seated as well and they are greeted right away and offered drinks. The menus being made of a weak card stock paper and not laminated were gross and sticky and covered in food. 5-10minutes have passed by this point and as soon as we are about to get up to leave a young waiter by the name of Kekoa (Christian) finally acknowledges us. I will give him this: he tried to be as polite as possible so we decided to give him a chance although we got no apology for the wait). The Food was good. And Kekoa's (Christian's) attempt at providing good memorable service slightly saved the experience. That was it. Lastly, the receipt was handed to us without a proper holder so it appeared sloppy. And as we were leaving, there were 4 employees at the greeter stand 2 appeared to be managers. None of them thanked us for our patronage. Nobody said ""thank you please come again.""  Aside from the food and Kekoa's (Christian's) attempt at recovering our first impression, our Overall experience was unwelcoming and discouraging to ever go back to this Applebee's or any other Applebee's for that matter. Sad to say that for our very FIRST experience at Applebee's, will be our LAST."
Grace P.,"Honolulu, HI",153,55,71,3.0,7/4/2017,"If I could do half stars, it'd be 2.5 stars. We decided to give the Kapolei location a try on a Sunday night. 30 min wait or so but we expected that. Looked like a pretty chill spot with a nice sized bar and hanging from ceiling tvs but not a place to go and watch sports or anything. Drinks came fairy quick enough but our entrees took forever. Coming from someone that's working in the restaurant industry previously, I know couple months or so after opening is usually the rough patches; work out the kinks and etc. but we waited nearly 40min for our entree. And all we ordered was that 2 for $25 (4 cheese mac and cheese with honey pepper chicken for me and a standard cheeseburger for the hubs). When they say standard, they mean standard. No pickles, onions, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard or mayo. And mines was a basic mac n cheese and chicken fingers with sauce drizzled. Service was ok. Our waitress checked on us a time or two but nothing outstanding. Safe to say we won't be back again."
Edge N.,"Honolulu, HI",19,167,36,3.0,5/11/2017,The folks wanted to check out the new Applebee's in Kapolei.  We got here around 4:30 pm.  The restaraunt seemed to be in-between the lunch crowd and dinner crowd.  It wasn't very busy and there was a whole bunch of waiters just walking around looking for things to do. This Applebee's is alot bigger than the Ewa one and seems to have just opened. The inside seems similar to an outback or Ruby Tuesday with wooden tables and chairs with vinyl padding nothing special.   I am reviewing as we sit idle lookbecause our food hasn't arrived yet and it's been more than 25  minutes so far.  I don't normally go into detail about the tables and chairs but our food still hasn't come yet.....whistling still waiting Oh ok!! Food finally arrived .... The waitress said this restaurant just opened 2 1/2 weeks ago so I guess new restaurant new staff it can't be perfect...The food was pretty good ..we all ordered steak and it was well seasoned and cooked good. Our waitress Devianna was very smiley and attentive she was also training and managed to do a great job.   I think this Applebee's will do well since it's in the new Kapolei mall....just be patient and understanding new restaurant and crew.
Mike N.,"Honolulu, HI",94,1,,1.0,5/13/2017,I've never seen customer service as bad as this in my life. The manager started yelling at the people in front of us when we were waiting for a table and after that we just left. Do not waste your time coming here.
Ashley H.,"Aiea, HI",72,3,4,5.0,8/23/2017,"My husband and I swung by for a late dinner. We were seated promptly and wait staff were excellent. Kiani was our server. Very friendly and attentive. Recommended food selections that did not disappoint. We shared the French onion soup; steak was juicy, garlic green beans with bacon, and fries were delicious. Dessert was also on point. Refills came without prompting. Will be back! :)"
Cindra M.,"Aiea, HI",15,7,3,2.0,8/22/2017,"Food OK, service VERY slow. Only one gal to take orders, make cocktails, serve, process parent, bus tables. Disappointing  experience for a $100 lunch tab"
Stephanie M.,"Aiea, HI",0,2,,1.0,5/14/2017,"Similar to the other reviews, the wait time for our food was way too long. This place needs more help in the kitchen. Our appetizers came out probably 10-15 minutes after we ordered and waited a total of 45 minutes for our entrees to finally come out!  Food wise, it was ok; nothing too spectacular. The chicken wontons were good; I would eat that again (if I ever come back). The bowl of tomato basil soup was way too small for $7. The oriental chicken salad had very little lettuce and was overpowered by the crispy wonton strips.  The only good thing about my experience here is our server. She was nice and came to check up on us a few times. Other than that, I would not recommend coming here, only if you have great patience for the long wait."
Nahoa G.,"Waianae, HI",0,5,1,1.0,4/30/2017,"My family went to have lunch today at Applebee's , always enjoyed the ones on the mainland.  First thing we saw were buckets in a couple booths catching dripping water.  Then we were seated total of 4 of uf in our party was only given 2 menus. No napkins or silver wear on table.  Ordered ice tea only had little bit ice like the tea had melted it. Now on to ordering our food,  I asked for fish and chips (ran out) artichoke dip with chips (ran out) we ordered other items and waited over an hour for the food to come.very disappointed in taste and portions of the food. Never again will I go back."
Gianna F.,"Kapolei, HI",70,2,,1.0,4/28/2017,This is the worst experience I've had in a restaurant so far. I thought it would be a lot better than other chain restaurants in the area but I was wrong. Seriously understaffed we sat down and waited for our lunch close to 45 minutes in a restaurant that was half empty.  Two of the desired menu items were not available and we had to ask for our drinks and silverware. They brought us food that was for another table and when we finally got our food half of it was overlooked. We had spent so much time in there that we asked to box it just so we could leave. Seriously Applebee's get it together. I didn't think it was going to be worse than chilis but I was wrong.
Leilani B.,"Honolulu, HI",265,11,1,1.0,5/13/2017,"Staff did not know how to make a reservation and put my sister on hold for 10 minutes. She hung up and called back to make the reservation. She confirmed next day and the reservation was not made.  Got seated at 1:30pm. We finally got our food at 2:52pm. We waited an 1hr and 22 minutes for Our food! unacceptable! We ordered steak, salad and boneless wings. My wings weren't even warm! the waitress didn't even apologize for the wait. It was my moms birthday and we told the waitress, no desert was given to her.  Unprofessional, horrible customer service, and will not be going back!"
Dee Y.,"Aiea, HI",1,15,13,2.0,5/29/2017,"I should've known better than to go to Applebee's when they were still in their ""grand opening"" weeks. 35 mins to be seated when the restaurant was 1/4 empty. Another 1 hour to get any food.  Our ice water was refilled with a pitcher of room temp water turning the entire cup to room temp.   Waitress and manager were both apologetic about the long wait.  Manager said they'd comp my entree (which came 5-10 minutes after everyone else) and we could order dessert to be comped as well.  When the bill came only the entree was comped but we were too tired by then to make a stink.  Not to mention all the tables around us were obviously suffering as well.   We were seated within view of the kitchen and observed numerous dishes sitting under the heat lamps yet not going anywhere.   My food actually was pretty good (steak + grains light entree) so I hope our experience is just from being new and still trying to get it together.  If not, it's not looking good for Applebee's in Hawaii!  Every bad review for both locations has same problems we experienced."
April Tricialen B.,"Wahiawa, HI",69,14,2,3.0,4/26/2017,"30 minute wait at 3:30PM was understandable especially on the weekend. I am giving my experience as a 3 star because the wait for my actual entree ended up becoming an hour and a half long after we had already ordered the appetizers and kids' food. When we ordered, the order went to the kitchen and 10 minutes later we found out one of our orders was not able to be made because they ran out of the baby back ribs. We ordered something different, and they ended up adding an additional and wrong entree. My brother's girlfriend got her food 30 or so minutes after the appetizer came out. After another 15 minutes is when the rest of the food came out. My entree was wrong, so I had to wait another 10 minutes before my food came out. My daughter had fallen asleep during the 30 minute initial time wait, and she was able to wake up from her nap to eat her food and finish it before I even got mine. I mean, the people who came in 30 minutes after us got their food and left before I finished my food. During the time of our visit, the fire alarm went off twice to evacuate the building, but no one moved to make an effort to let guests know whether or not the alarm is real. My dad had to ask another waiter (while Kawena was checking other tables and putting in orders) to see what's going on. Manager didn't make an announcement and told the waiter to let us know we should wait 3 minutes before exiting or finding out whether or not the alarm is real because ""Papa John's usually has a fire drill."" Wait, so does this mean if they didn't know if it was a drill or not, we'd wait 3 minutes to find out if there's smoke or fire in the actual building? Shouldn't the building be notified whether or not there will be a drill? The only reason I'm giving a 3 star is because Kawena was a great waitress and always checking up on us. I asked her for a customer survey, but there are no paper surveys and was given the suggestion to do an online survey. Instead, the manager, Katie, came by to talk to me and had taken off $50 worth of food and drinks. Okay, that's good, but the chances of us coming back here would be a bit slim. Depending on whether or not we want to use whatever coupon or discount thing Katie gave us for future use."
Sunshine M.,"Kaneohe, HI",1,9,5,5.0,8/16/2017,Our server annika was on point. Very friendly and patient with us. This is me and my wife's first time. She didn't rush us. She made us feel very welcomed. We ordered 2 baby back ribs. Oh it was big and delicious. I also ordered a mango Bacardi lemonade its to die for. I will definitely be back. The only down side was the food took 40 mins. I guess it's reasonable for 2 big racks of ribs
Neve-Lei S.,"Waipahu, HI",108,55,25,1.0,5/21/2017,"Zero stars if I could, Tried to dine in last night, told it was a 30-45 min wait for 2. That was at 7:40pm. A lot of empty tables when we checked in, maybe they're short staffed? Whatever, they have a text app to let you know when you're table is ready and see the hostess. I got a text at 9pm, HA! They just opened and majority of their reviews aren't so great. Ended up eating at another restaurant in the mall, and I was already leaving the mall when they texted my phone."
Lori K.,"Aiea, HI",0,9,35,1.0,4/16/2017,"We waited 30 minutes for a table, waited 15 minutes for water, waited 40 minutes for our food and they brought the wrong order. Our waitress Sylvia was slow, could not be found, never came around to fill water or ask if everything's okay and didn't even apologize for the extremely long wait. Another waitress saw us waiting so long that she even asked us if we were being waited on. That was the worst dining experience we ever had. Food portions were small and is nothing to want to come back for.  Definitely not worth the drive out there."
Jonathan C.,"Mililani, HI",0,8,12,1.0,8/14/2017,"I have been to plenty of Applebees in the main land and they are great. I have eaten 3 times at the ones in Oahu and 2 of times they were not good. It seems the customer service is very lacking. We were there for over an hour and only received 1 refill each and on that we had to ask for it. My wife salad was not good and the only way they could try and fix it was to throw some more salad on it. Our hostess didn't even bring our food to us, she walked around us many times with out checking on us or seeing if we needed anything. It's hard to say if we will be back I would recomend Chilies over Applebees at this point."
