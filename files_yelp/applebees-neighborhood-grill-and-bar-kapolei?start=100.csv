Cristine R.,"Ewa Beach, HI",5,93,19,4.0,8/29/2017,Came for a birthday lunch celebration for my coworker. Had heard a lot of bad customer service but in my opinion the lady who helped us was very friendly. Food took a while but what I got turned out yummy. Wouldn't mind coming back
Emma S.,"Kapolei, HI",0,1,,1.0,1/2/2018,"half the restaurant was empty, host had us wait for him to buss the nearest table despite the fact that there were other tables, but there probably just weren't enough servers for the night  took maybe 30-40 minutes before they brought out the food. no dressing for salad, mac n cheese was cold, sitting. watching the staff at the line, everyone was bunched. obvious confusion, no organization. food was sitting for long periods of time. staff continuously ignored the food. server never came to check up until we asked to cancel the check & cancel the food they took to ""warm up""  it was obvious they were having a terrible night. staff wasn't happy, seemed to be no organization considering how crazy it seemed at the line, all the food sitting; however, after reading the other reviews, i realize that this is normal for this location"
Sherine Q.,"Waianae, HI",93,1,,5.0,12/1/2017,Very satisfied with the food and server we had. I think our servers name was Cheyanne and she was such a sweet heart. The food was good and they gave us more food than the one that's in Ewa beach.
Shy K.,"Honolulu, HI",154,182,351,3.0,8/27/2017,Everytime I come to this location their is always a wait. Not saying it's a bad thing. At times the don't appear to be busy and there is still a wait. The food is mediocre. Nothing that WOWs me. Servce is just like the food mediocre. Nice atmosphere clean floors.
Kristin T.,"Ewa Beach, HI",214,18,40,2.0,7/9/2017,"Me and some friends were at kamakana mall and wanted to have dinner out in kapolei. We actually wanted to go to db grill but we called and they said the wait was 1 hour. Since we were already at the mall we decided to give Apple bees a try. Went to check in and they said the wait was 20-30 minutes. They took my friends number and said they would send him a text when the table was ready. It was pretty cool because they sent a text and it took you to their site that had like a countdown timer for your table which started at 30 minutes. The timer had counted down and now it said that it was 0 minute wait, but we still got no text saying the table was ready. My friend jokingly sent a text back saying ""hello?"" And we were finally seated after about a 40 minute wait.  Okay so service... our waitress seemed very nice but I think maybe inexperienced. She brought us drinks and we asked for a few minutes to review the menu. We were looking at those shared meals where it says one appetizer and 2 full entrees. We were kinda joking/ wondering why we had to pay an extra $1 to make the chicken tenders meal a ""platter"" so we asked he waitress and she said by making it a platter it came with coleslaw and more chicken and more fries. Thought that was weird because that means that you were actually getting a small portion meal but had to pay an extra $1 to make it full size when it already says full entree. Anyways that's not her fault because she doesn't make the prices. Btw we ended up paying the extra dollar. I ordered the all day brunch burger which sounded good and said it came with fries. When my burger came out the fries portion was seriously sad! Like if you're gonna give so little fries you should maybe put it on a smaller plate.  I'll attach a picture of it. The rest of the food was good. Boneless wings with sauce on the side, 3 cheese Mac and cheese, and the chicken platter.  Paying... I see a lot of reviews about taking a while to pay and I honestly can't say if it was or wasn't long because I think we were complaining about my small portion of fries. When we got our bill we had the 2 for $25 but was charged $27.50. I asked the waitress why and she started to tell me that oh because the platter was an extra $1... ummmm ok $26.... lol she went to talk to the manager and there was a glitch in the system. I actually didn't notice the charge till after I already ran my card so they asked for my card back and refunded me the $1.50. Yes I actually took the $1.50 refund.  In the end me and my friends said we shoulda just waited the hour for db grill. I'm pretty sure we won't be going back."
Shantel B.,"Honolulu, HI",24,7,4,1.0,7/9/2017,"All the negative reviews are spot on! We waitied entirely too long for drinks, food, and the check. I had to flag down our waitress to ask for refills on our drinks.... she never offered to top them off after that.  They were not even that busy.  So many staff standing around but service is so slow?  I had to take me check up to some random employee and ask her to cash us out because we had sat there 20 minutes waiting dor our check to be picked up. The employee said she had to find out server because that is the only person who can cash us out..... she walks away with our check and cards somewhere in the back.... 10 minutes later we get the checkand cards back. Never again."
Rell P.,"Wahiawā, HI",120,7,26,1.0,8/7/2017,"I will make this short and sweet as I have no time left in the day because it seemed like we were at this place FOREVER!  Estimated ""10 minute wait"" which turned into 15-20 minutes but yet you can clearly see there are more than 5+ tables available and no lunch hour rush. Waited over 5-10 minutes for our waitress let alone drinks to start off with.  Waited over 5 minutes for a my strawberry lemonade. Waited for over 30 minutes for our entrees, mind you our waitress didn't have the common courtesy to refill our drinks, tell us our food will be shortly, or apologize for the wait. Would've been understandable if it were busy, but it totally was not. The one star is for the food quality it was actually really, really good - maybe it tasted extremely good only because I was starving, idk. Lol. Was it worth the wait? Not at all. Definitely not coming back to this location, that's for sure. But if you have all the time in the world and do not mind waiting, this place is definitely for you!"
Lon C.,"Wahiawa, HI",4,7,3,3.0,6/3/2017,"We got there Sat 5:30.  They said it was a 20 min wait and we got called in 15 min.  Waiter was getting our drink order shortly after.  It took maybe 25 min for the food to be ready.  The waiter told us it was taking longer than usual and would take 2 more minutes.  Seems like a typical wait for restaurants, nothing like the 40 reviews.  Waiter was pretty attentive. The shrimp wonton stir fry wasn't that great.  The rice seemed like it was previously frozen.  The sauce was slightly spicy and a little too tangy for me.  The wontons seemed a little extra crispy in a strange way.  The shrimp was fine, not raw-ish and deveined and not too hard.  Probably would try something else the next time we come back."
Kristal A.,"Kapolei, HI",53,71,88,5.0,8/2/2017,Polite & respectful workers Wait time is about 15 mins  Sitting time is usually asap once you walk in They don't mind answering questions and also suggesting items on the menu. I appreciate the patiences that the employees have because I usually take long when it comes to ordering. Thank you
Gardenia D.,"Waipahu, HI",7,16,21,1.0,6/27/2017,"IF YOU WANT TO TRY APPLEBEES, GO TO THE ONE IN EWA!!! THIS LOCATION IS HORRIBLE! A couple of my friends and I decided to try this location out despite all the bad reviews we got from our other friends. We were sat down at our table by the hostess. It took 10mins for a server to greet us, another 20mins to get WATER. At this point, I'm already disappointed because serving water isn't that hard. That's the FIRST thing you serve at a restaurant, even if the guests don't want it. We were seated right next to the bar, where the gentlemen on that side had drinks refilled THREE times while we waited for our water. Our appetizers came out. Those were good. Another 30mins, we waited....for our entrees. Fyi, only 40% of the tables throughout the restaurant were filled and it was dinner time. Our entrees came out except one. Mind you, our food came out cold. Finally, my friend's food came out. I don't know why it took so long when him and I ordered the same thing! His food though, came out with the wrong sides lol. I don't know how else the experience could get any worse. My friend's entree came out with the correct sides and it was finally time to eat. Don't come here for the ribs...unless you want to wrestle with it. The only good thing they got right was when the manager so nicely gave us 20% off for the cold food. Overall, don't come here expecting good service and food....unless you're a guy and you sit by the bar because that's where all the servers are at with their ""good customer service"" laughing and joking around.  Whoever the owner of this place is, PLEASE WORK ON IMPROVING YOUR RESTAURANT SERVICE STANDARDS/EMPLOYEES and maybe you'll get more customers."
Mike D.,"Ewa Beach, HI",23,2,,3.0,11/24/2017,Service was ok but damn can I get my steak cooked well not bloody and can get some sliver Ware please
Melisa A.,"Honolulu, HI",22,37,11,4.0,9/3/2017,"Had a great dinner tonight with the family, Sasha was really great she took care of us like we were family. The food was good, had the whiskey burger and could not finish it. It was really good and my family really liked there food."
Shaianne Y.,"Fresno, CA",227,2,,1.0,7/1/2017,"Person in the front and greeted us, we asked for a table for 2 she said the wait was 30-35mins long and she will txt us when our table is ready (8:24pm I got the text saying hold my phone they will txt us blah blah.) So we decided to walk around the mall, still no text. We sit down in front of the restaurant around 8:45pm and theres barely anyone waiting! Nobody is outside except us, and people who were walking in got seated right away.. So around 8:50pm we decided to wait inside the restaurant and theres everyone who was waiting and those who came after us all seated! So we continue to wait and they were like ""you are so and so right"" and i say yes then they finally seated us around 9pm. Clearly they forgot about us because there was more than enough space to sit 2-6 people.  Then we got our drinks 10mins after we sit, the waitress took our orders right away. It took almost 30mins for our food to come out and all we ordered were 2 burgers. The waitress CONSTANTLY keep reminding us about our burger status and how shes going to ""check"" on them but lets be real she probably forgot to put our order in.. At this point im pissed off. The waitress kept constantly asking us if we are ok and good and shes even said at one point ""you guys need anything else? Sorry everything is so hectic i hope you guys are cursing my name or anything ahaha"" im sure the greeters probably told her to be extra nice to us cuz they forgot about us or she realllllly wanted a tip.. overall i got out of there around 9:45. NEVER COMING TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN."
Diana B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,3,2,1.0,7/8/2017,The waitress had an attitude the whole time and food was mediocre. The food doesn't come out like it looks like in the menu. Portions were a lot smaller than in the menu as well. The waitress took forever to get our check and wasn't friendly. We will not be returning.
Erinn A.,"Kapolei, HI",2,3,,2.0,6/4/2017,"My family and I took my father here for his birthday dinner.  My sister had such a great experience here that I was hoping for the same experience.  It started off well... we had a party of eight, and when I first put my name in on the list, the hostess had told me that everyone in my party needed to be there to be seated.  When they texted me that my table was ready, not everyone in my party was there, but the hostess said that was okay and seated us anyway.  So far so good... good experience. Our server was nice.  She checked up on our party to see if we needed anything... good experience. Things took a turn when our entrees came... 1. My niece ordered the kids' chicken grillers.  The server came back with a kids' grilled cheese.  Then her chicken took forever to come out.  Her broccoli came out before her chicken.  By the time her chicken came, everyone else was more than half way through their meals. 2. My dad, the birthday boy, ordered his steak medium.  When he got his food, his steak was well done.  It was tough and hard to cut.  When his new plate came out, the steak was cooked correctly, but the kitchen forgot to put the correct condiments on his baked potato.  3. My son ordered a blackberry lemonade quencher.  The server came back with the strawberry one.  At this point, I told him to just drink it because it might take forever for him to get another one.  4. When we got the check, we just got the receipt with no card holder, which I thought was weird because all the restaurants I've been to use those holders.  Management should really look into using those.  It's easier for both the customer and the server.  Credit cards and money can get lost, especially if the server is handling more than one check at a time. By the end of the dinner, my dad was frustrated with this dining experience and didn't even want dessert.  The plus side is that the manager and the server always checked in with us to let us know when the food was coming.   I'm not sure if my dad would come back to eat here. I might give it another try.  After all, it is still a new place.  I do hope that management are reading these reviews and will try to improve on some of the negatives."
Ron B.,"Kapolei, HI",0,2,,1.0,12/20/2017,"I really tried to like this place (I really did), however, I don't think I will be eating here anytime soon.    We were seated right away and our waiter took our order, however, like some of the user's experienced, service was quite slow (that is being nice) for a restaurant that didn't see busy at all (maybe they were short staffed tonight).  At about an hour's wait, I decided to ask our waiter to pack our food and I was told that the food wasn't ready (they were still cooking the kid's macaroni and cheese).  There was a table next to us that ordered after us and got their food rather quick.  It was a total wait of 1 hour and 13 minutes before our food was ready.  Kudos to the waiter for docking 20% off our tab, however, when we got home, my steak was well overcooked, dry, and cold (asked for medium rare) and they forgot to add the fries that came with my kid's macaroni and cheese.  I should have taken a picture of the food we ordered (maybe next time, if I ever feel like visiting Applebee's Kapolei again."
Shirley T.,"Mililani, HI",22,18,18,1.0,6/3/2017,"Terrible service. Went got seated right, 14 minutes later no water. No came by to say anything. Decided it wasn't worth my time and left. Should be no stars. But app won't let me exit without putting a least one star."
Kupono E.,"Waialua, HI",44,2,,1.0,10/29/2017,"For the Saturday before Halloween, it wasn't busy at all and my party was put on a waiting list for 30 min!  Service was way below sub-par by our given waitress, exceptional service from one and only one individual, Quinn! If you ever come by, request for him he is very upbeat and awesome!"
Lorene Y.,"Honolulu, HI",0,4,1,1.0,8/30/2017,"If you are in a rush and want a quick bite to eat, this is not the place to go!  If you are hungry, you will starve to death.  The service is non existent. It took half an hour for my Diet Pepsi to arrive.  Mind you, they were NOT busy except for one poor waitress who the hostess seemed to put everyone in her area.  I will NEVER return to this establishment. Honestly, I do not see them lasting very long as the service is POOR."
Penny V.,"Mililani Town, HI",25,20,,1.0,5/18/2017,This restaurant will be getting a bad review not only from me but other customers too! You'll get seated right away but will have to wait about 25 minutes before you can order your food then it'll take 40 minutes before the food comes. Two people in our group had to wait for silverware while the rest of us started to eat. We we're given the desert menu but the joke was after we ordered the waitress came back and said they couldn't make the deserts we ordered because they ran out of the ingredients! What a disappointing dining experience!
