Andy S.,"Aiea, HI",126,6,,5.0,10/18/2017,"First time coming back to Applebee's in quite a few years due to poor service and quality, this redemption experience was on point and will have me coming back again for sure. The waitress Kahi was on top of it at all times and made sure we were taken care of. The Caprese mozzarella chicken was excellent and the drinks were just as good."
CT M.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,3,,5.0,12/16/2017,The food was great and filling but most importantly our waitress Natalie was phenomenal.  Extremely attentive and caring...we will ask for her next time we come!
Basilio M.,"Kapolei, HI",2,81,35,2.0,5/7/2017,"So that happened.  We have a Applebee's in Kapolei.  Unfortunately it is bad.  Looks very nice and roomy.  Appetizers are meh, the food was bad.  Took 20 mins to be seated, almost an hour to get food.  Now I'm not expecting gourmet when I go to Applebee's.  But steak salad with cold steak, fish and chips with double cooked fries that still arrived cold.  And poorly presented pasta and stir fry.  Food was ugly.  Fries tasted like cold crunchy ash, and when you order a South Western salad you know they skimped you on beans and corn and drowned the cheap lettuce with dressing and covered it tortilla confetti.        Don't go to eat ""meals"" there.  The entrees where overpriced premade Costco bulk snack food mixed together.  It's like when you have no real food left and you mix a bunch of TV Dinners and totinos boxed food together and call it homemade Bolognese lasagna.        If you go, just get tap beer and mozzarella sticks, food and drinks they are unable to mess up or get creative with.  Watch a game.  Though there are better places to go for beer and snacks with TV's that do not charge for the cost of it being Applebee's.        Save your money, if you want the experience of eating here.  Get a Hungry Man TV dinner, some KFC chicken, hunts BBQ sauce and sit in front of a TV at home with a Pabst Blue Ribbon.  It will taste the same and be 1/8th the cost and 0% disappointment."
Hohoho B.,"Aiea, HI",64,73,19,1.0,7/5/2017,"Ugh food tasted like frozen TV dinners, but not as good. Husband had stir fried shrimp. Yikes! Didn't taste good at all... I had sirloin steak... Tasted like it had freezer burn... not right. Food came out cold. Service was slow but pleasant. Horrible food for the price. I love Applebee's in the mainland, but was super disappointed with this one. Bummer coz I've waited a long time for them to open here... And now that theyre open I'm never going back for a meal."
Ann C.,"Honolulu, HI",11,104,293,1.0,5/16/2017,"Zero stars. Where do I begin? First, how about you bring enough utensils for all 5 of us, and not just 2? While you're at it, bring 5 waters also, please? We did ask for them afterall. Next, we loved our warm salads that came out about 20 mins later. Who doesn't love a warm, wilted caesar? Oh wait, you don't have the soup, that's ok, we will take another salad. Oh now you do have the soup, great, we would prefer that since that was the original order. At least you offered to only charge for the soup and not the extra salad too. 15 mins later, thanks for bringing us the appetizer we ordered, and then 3 mins later bring out some of our entree's. Thank the employee who came out and said they would re-do the steak we ordered and not charge us for it since everyone else was done eating already and still no steak. Finally got the steak, and it came with mashed potatoes instead of the fries we ordered. At least you brought out a plate of cold fries to go with it. The only good thing about this meal were the green beans, they were delicious, and for that, you get the one star rating. It only took numerous attempts to get a take out box, then a bag, then the bill, which was wrong. 15 mins after that, we finally get the correct check, and that was after we had to remind you that you offered to remove the salad we didn't order and the steak that came out over an hour after we ordered our food. that was the longest meal ever and it was not fine dining. At least your employees were nice, just not helpful or efficient. I'm not sure what was going on that night but the dinner was painful and slow, food was mediocre at best, and I do not think I will be back, ever. Hard pass."
Kandyce N.,"Honolulu, HI",33,12,26,4.0,10/19/2017,"Stopped to see how the newer Kapolei Applebee's was. The hostesses & servers were very cheerful & polite. It was our first time there, so the food they recommended trying was all very good & came out pretty quickly. Our server Seanelle was very attentive & we felt very relaxed & comfortable. Great first experience, will be back very soon!"
Catherine E.,"Hauula, HI",2,18,7,1.0,10/29/2017,"DO NOT GO HERE!!! It is not worth it at all. We drove from Hauula because we've never eaten at an Applebee's before. We sat at our booth for 15 minutes when I asked someone walking by if we had a server, he then came 5 minutes later. We ordered our drinks with our food order since we had be then 20 minutes already.  I was seated where I could see where the food would come out at and there was about 8 other meals sitting up there along with a whole bunch of appetizers. I was just keeping an I eye on what the cooks were doing in the back so I was paying attention to when they would put the food up on the warmer table thing. My husband and I both started watching the waitresses to see if they were planning on talking the orders out. I'm not even exaggerating when I say this but those lazy ass girls not once checked to see if orders were up. There was about 6 of them standing by one of the registers with horrible looks on their faces as if they were all annoyed with being there. The only time someone grabbed something from that food table thing was a manager and she grabbed 2 plates and we never saw her again. We had been sitting there for 40 minutes at this point and my husband who is the calm one starts to get pissed since these servers were literally just walking around in now groups of 2 just talking story. To make a long story short, all that food that had been sitting there when we ordered was still sitting there when my husband stood up at the 1hour mark from the time we got there and told our male server we're leaving. This was the worst place we've ever been too!!! To make matters worse the place wasn't busy at all!!! My husband and I along with our 3 children walked out never even getting our appetizer. I did call and ask to speak with the manager after we got into our car and told her how horrible this was. She said she'd only been in the restaurant for 10 minutes before I called so she had no idea what was going on. I don't believe that at all. DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!"
Chantele C.,"Pearl City, HI",47,5,10,2.0,6/25/2017,"Me and my family came here on Sunday, June 18th. This was our first time here. We had a big group of 15 and didn't RSVP, so the wait was 55-60 minutes. I had ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken which was apart of the 2 for $35.00 deal. The deal is for 2 entrees and 1 appetizer. The bottom of the chicken was burnt. Potatoes tasted a bit dry and had a lot of GARLIC butter, but there weren't that many on my plate. But besides that everything else looked fine. Apart of the deal we got a Artichoke and Spinach dip with chips as our appetizer. Very good, cheesy with great flavors and seasoning. It also came with a side of salsa. The salsa was spicy and delicious. It left your month with a nice little burning, but not to over whelming.  Desert was fantastic. They say a picture say a thousand words, I say the picture speaks for it's self. Cake moist, warm, fluffy, and with a nice gooey inside. Most of the time, I see a picture no try to imagine how big it will be. Most of the time the actual this is smaller than expected. But in this case it was bigger than expected. And as good as it looks.   So when we came today, June 24th I decided to get the Four Cheese Mac with Honey Pepper Chicken Strips. Which was delicious. The noodle were cooked perfectly, the cheese sauce was creamy cheesy goodness(wish I had a bit more, just cause it was so good). There was a decent amount of bacon bits. But my favorite part was the Honey Pepper Chicken Strips. The sauce was spectacular, sweet with a nice pop of heat that left a little bit of heat in the back of your mouth. The chicken strips where crispy, they had a decent amount of flower, and they were cooked well. And I had the Caesar Salad as my appetizer. As show in the picture, which was taken before I took a single bite, there were only a few crotons,2-3 and a little bit of salad. Honestly at first glance I thought they had given me a partially eaten salad. In addition to the unappealing size, a hand full of the pieces of lettuce were brown. Another person in our group had ordered a garden salad today. The size was good, the lettuce was fresh, and they had a decent amount of various topping. When we had come the Sunday prior, a member in our party had the Caesar Salad as well. When they were served, the size was good, the lettuce fresh and a decent amount of crotons. I'm not sure if they are inconsistent or if that particular plate wasn't made well. In addition another member of our party ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken, the chicken was partially burnt. And the small amount of potatoes were dry and had a too much GARLIC butter again. The Artichoke and Spinach dip was fantastic again."
Ciara L.,"Waipahu, HI",66,1,,1.0,11/25/2017,"First time here and it was a terrible experience! Restaurant wasn't busy, but we still had to wait for a table. We finally sit at a table and someone in our group of six asks the waiter what was on tap? I guess he didn't hear, his response was, ""What?!"" Never have I been to a restaurant and get that kind of response! Then, we order our appetizers & meals. The wait for appetizers was long, so we asked our waiter if we were getting it before our dinner, he goes to check & comes back with our appetizers five minutes later & they were cold...spinach/artichoke dip & onion rings. Also, had to ask for utensils. Waited quite some time for our dinner, even my 6 year old was asking why it was taking so long for Kraft mac n cheese. We finally get our food and they were all cold...chicken tenders, fried shrimp, fries, mac n cheese & mozzarella sticks...ALL cold! Only the chicken/shrimp sizzling platter was hot. Complained to the manager & she says she'll see what she can do to our bills(we had 2 separate bills)...we get our bills from our waiter & nothing was done to our bills. So, we asked to see the manager and she says she was busy & didnt have a chance to look at it. So, she takes our bills which takes at least 15 minutes & comes back & one of our bills was more than what it was before adjusments. So, she had to take it back AGAIN! Waited another 10 minutes! From waiting to be seated to finally paying our bill it took about 2 hours! Waiter, manager & cooks need better training. While there, I hear/see waiters apologizing to other customers. Hostess was awesome...she gets the one star!"
Grant H.,"Pearl City, HI",2,41,,1.0,5/13/2017,"Service is RUBBISH.  Food takes way too long. Listen to all of the reviews. Busy time, slow time. It doesnt matter expect to wait at least 25 minutes for your food. 2 star rating.  Update while we sit here stilllllll waiting for our food. Its been 40 minuted ans stillno food. Down to 1 star rating.  Lucky no more 0 stars cause seems like it coming up."
Phil J.,"Ewa Beach, HI",9,39,7,1.0,5/20/2017,"This place was not good at all, I realize that they are new but they need a lot of work, the portions are terribly small for the price you pay the burgers don't come with any kind of garnish plus the onion rings are terribly over-cooked and the service was terrible. We waited at least 20 minutes for our check to be taken up. They also left all the dirty dishes sitting in front of us the whole time. I do give kudos to the manager as she did stop by and ask us how everything was."
Shaela M.,"Kapolei, HI",3,56,49,4.0,7/26/2017,"We had our team lunch here today. We made reservations ahead of time. Although the girl at the door came off with a little bit of attitude, our server was nice & very sweet. She was knowledgeable of the menu & gave us ideas on what to eat. I've heard that the food here is not as good, but I had the half rack ribs 2 for $35 deal; and although the honey BBQ sauce was a little spicy, the meal was very good & satisfying. The tortilla chips had punches of salt on each chip which I also didn't like because the chip was literally all salt. Despite the cons, I still would come back here to eat & request no salt on chips."
Dallas-james C.,"Haleiwa, HI",1,1,,5.0,12/17/2017,We had a amazing time here at apple bees food was awesome but what was the best part of it was Cheyenne's customer service. I got up to get something I left in the waiting area and another employee asked if I was ok and if I was being helped. As someone works as a customer service trainer for big box electronics store I enjoyed my time she ensured we were taking care of and our food came out fast. THANK YOU CHEYENNE!!
Roger B.,"Honolulu, HI",0,11,,3.0,8/20/2017,Four stars for food and overall service - they do do a great job.  Would have given a higher rating... but two things stood out.  Both appetizer plates had stuck on food. Yikes is what the server said! Second thing was we ordered the chicken tacos with no cilantro- food comes with cilantro in the coleslaw.  We should have been told at the time of our order.  Otherwise we enjoyed our meal. They have to provide exceptional service as Cheescake factory opens soon.  Otherwise they will be taking overflow business as the new restaurant will steal their share.
Mylyn M.,"Waipahu, HI",2,3,1,1.0,8/5/2017,"I give Sashana 5 stars for being a friendly.  I give no stars for the wait to be seated when there were about 6 tables open, wait 45 minutes for the burgers, then two choices for the burgers...pink and no pink.  Pink means raw!  How the hell so you ruin a burger.  Hope we don't get sick."
Preciousgem 1.,"Aiea, HI",12,15,5,1.0,5/29/2017,"I read the reviews about this place but gave this place a try anyhow.  Saturday evening ~ wait time was about an hour. We put our name down. We received a text that out table was ready at 652pm and we were seated just before 7pm.  Placed our order by 715pm.  We got our appetizer shorty after. After we were done with our appetizer, we asked about our dinner. We were told it will be another 10 mins. People who came in after us were getting food delivered to their table. What was going on?! By 750pm still no dinner. We spoke with the manager. The manager told us that our food was ready and tried to accommodate us. She insisted the wait time was only about 20 mins. Now if we were seated just before 7pm...if our wait for food was really only about 20 mins, we would be finishing up our dinner by 8pm. But no... our dinner never made it to our table. Service was bad. Food? The boneless wing appetizer was ok."
Boto I.,"Aliamanu - Salt Lakes - Foster Village, Honolulu, HI",32,1,,3.0,11/4/2017,"45 min wait they said. I counted 11 open tables wit just few people waiting outside, my head wasnt itchy but I had to scratch it anyway"
Kristian B.,"Honolulu, HI",10,16,2,1.0,4/16/2017,"ATTENTION YELP READERS!!!!!!  If you're hungry DO NOT eat at this piece of crap restaurant. You're better off taking a nice stroll to the food court where you will receive outstanding service. I've never been to Applebee's. I was at Ka Makana Ali'i earlier today hoping to try this place out. They told us that the wait would be 5-10 min. That's not bad at all.  Our wait was about 10 min which is totally fine. The restaurant wasn't busy at all.  While waiting at our table, it took about 15 min for anyone to notice us.  A manager took our drink order & told us that our server would be with us shortly.  I over heard the table next to us say ""oh, wow.. they got drinks before us"".   45 MINUTES LATER, NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON CAME TO OUR TABLE TO TAKE OUR ORDER!!!!!!! WE LEFT THE RESTAURANT BECAUSE NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THE HELL THEY'RE DOING. I understand that this is a new restaurant & it takes a while for everyone to get it together.  Gen ala Moana is also a new mainland restaurant, & I had no problems at that place.   I will never return to this piece of crap service restaurant. EVER!"
Curtis A.,"Kapolei, HI",19,4,3,1.0,5/19/2017,"If you want good service, DO NOT go here.   Me and a couple of friends went there to eat around 8:30 PM and was seated immediately, which was good. We ordered and every thing was fine until we got our food.  We didn't have utensils so we kindly asked for some. Our waitress came back and slammed a bundle of forks and butter knives (still wet) in the center of the table. Way more forks and knives that we needed. One of us also got a simple chicken dish but didn't get his food until about 20-30 minutes after the rest of the group got their food. Mind you we already waited about 20-30 minutes for our food to come out.  We also sat right in front of the entrance where the workers at the check in table were lying their heads on the check in counter. Also if you decide to pay cash expect an eye roll, it may be an inconvenience for them. Our waitress also thought it was more important to talk to her friend who just walked in and have a little chat, instead of putting the change she had in her hand on our table that was right in front of her!!  With that said, I ordered a Brunch Burger that came out pretty good but really greasy. The food was alright but the service is absolutely terrible. The workers I seen during my dining in seem to have little to no experience with customer service."
Jensen H.,"Kapolei, HI",278,15,3,3.0,5/1/2017,"Tried the new Apple Bees at Ka Makana Ali'i. Arrived a 15 minutes later than my family, which they had already been seated and kids food were been served already.  Food was great as I ordered the Shrimp Won Ton stir fry. It was great and wait was not that long. Water refills is big with me, so I asked once and it kept coming after.  Seems like staff is still trying to find their click, little mishaps here and there but they're new, so it will not affect my rating.  Atmosphere was great.I'm sure we will be returning in the new future.  Hopefully the next time, I can give them another star."
