Ma'rin W.,"Waipahu, HI",31,20,51,3.0,4/22/2017,Pretty good. Service a little bit slow but good was pretty good. I'm not the biggest fan of their food but this location is brighter and more spacious than the one on EwA Beach.

Zero O.,"Honolulu, HI",0,6,,1.0,5/28/2017,"First time Applebee customer, it will be my last for the Kapolei location. Wait time was told 1+ hr.  Walked around the mall while waiting. Finally got the text after 1hr 20 min. When we were seated, the restaurant was 3/4 full. Had to SMH because I'm thinking why we weren't notified earlier to be seated.  Rate: 1 Star Server asked if we wanted appetizers because the kitchen is backed up. About a 30min wait time for food. Now family is like ""WTF"". Please note:  we got seated around 8pm.   Luckily, food came out in a reasonable amount of time.   Rate: 2 Star Now the food. Ordered the baby back ribs. Would have tasted good if only the ribs was hot. Food was served COLD.  My baked potato was cold too. The cheese and butter wasn't even melted. Wife also make a comment that her food was cold. Kids burger was dry, fries....dry.  I understand the place just open but sheesh.....GET YOUR ""SH!T"" together!  Rate: 1/2 Star"
Sara L.,"Honolulu, HI",33,25,,1.0,4/30/2017,"Service was ok could be better if the waitress was attentive with refills. Manager needs to greet customers too as they are a new restaurant. The food needs to be improved too. Chicken appetizer was overly fried and dry. The sauce didnt make it better either. Ribs were too spicy. Also, the chips and salsa appetizer took 20 mins to come out. It was 11:30 am lunch hour too. Kitchen was understaffed. They have enough servers but need to be attentive and smile more. The restaurant roof was leaking water down too. Other restaurants in town are very effcient, attentive and have the best service. Come on, get with the game here Kapolei town!!!  Not coming back to Applebees again."
Andrew G.,"Honolulu, HI",85,10,,2.0,5/29/2017,"Lord where do I began.... 1. We were a party if 4...asked to be seated in a booth. We were given half booth half chairs.  When asked if we could sit in an open booth....4 feet away, the hostess stated ""eee. Ummm well I would have to walk all the way back up there ( Hostess station ) to ask. She never returned to answer our question.  2. Drinks took longer than I feel was appropriate but not too big of an issues. Our our drinks had to be returned as it was ordered as a frozen drink and came to the table as on the rocks. The waiter also piece mealed waters to the table.  3. Appetizers and entrees:  all but 1 meal was fine. 1 steak was not even close to medium rare. Talked to the waiter and he asked that we move the potato off the plate instead of taking the whole plate back.  At no point did a manger come bye in regards to the missed drink and messed up food.  Service was the worse I have ever had at any Applebee's. I really hope it gets better."
Braunsen M.,"Waipahu, HI",0,7,3,3.0,7/1/2017,"Not a bad experience overall service was slow but friendly. Food was good I'd give it a solid 7 out of 10, I'd return for special occasion though. Clean friendly environment."
Stella G.,"Honolulu, HI",31,2,,1.0,10/30/2017,"The service was so bad. We waited for our food over 30 minutes, and they still did not bring it out until we asked for it. Everything was just warm or cold. We asked for the manager and she acted like we were bothering her with our complaints. We told her that we watched our food sit up there for around 15 minutes and she said that was normal....wow really you let food sit there on a warm counter for 15 minutes!!! Sorry Applebee's after all your awesome commercials,I was so excited to have you finally come to Hawaii and now I think you should spend the advertising money on training your employees. There are too many other restaurants that are opening up all over Hawaii that actually want business, unfortunately you are not one of them. The worst part of this experience was that no one in your restaurant even cared."
Mariel R.,"Azusa, CA",0,12,,5.0,4/16/2017,Great place! Chill vibes! And great bartenders! Holly & Kristina were so nice!  Try to sit at the bar bc it's happy hour all day! & it's a good place to watch sports as well (at the bar).
Nerissa M.,"Waipahu, HI",15,1,,1.0,12/17/2017,"I was so excited for this Restaurant to  have here in Hawaii. So my boyfriend and myself went for an early Lunch . I would not recommend this place to my friends and family. The service is so slow   waited for almost 45 minutes and when my order came out, my soup was very cold I cannot eat it , so I waited  for our  server to at least  look at our table .  But she never did. Again waited for another 15 minutes. Finally she came by , She took my soup inside to wait for another 15 minutes and another girl came out with my soup and my sandwich.  When we were eating, our server came by with our check . I lost my appetite so I just ask for a box  to go my club sandwich. I can't imagine we lost that much time in this restaurant .  Btw our servers name is Hannah. She needs some more training . We will never go back again : first and last ."
Megan K.,"Waipahu, HI",0,1,,5.0,12/17/2017,I've been to this location multiple times but I had some amazing customer service tonight. My server Cheyanne was so sweet from the first interaction I had with her. She let us know that the restaurant was short staffed so she was actually serving AND cooking the food! Our salad took a little longer than expected so she comped it for us which I thought was great. She deserves a raise for the amount of work she was doing tonight!! You go girl :)
L B.,"Aiea, HI",20,7,1,1.0,10/10/2017,"Place wasn't busy. We waited for our food for 40 minutes. Baby Back ribs very dry, asked for more sauce. The Chicken Breast with Shrimp was also so very dry& hard to cut with knife. My son had to drench it with ketchup . My Pasta with artichoke & spinach with pieces of chicken breast also hard and dry. No quality in food. This was my first & last time to this place. Need to change!"
Di C.,"Ewa Beach, HI",10,41,29,2.0,10/9/2017,"This location not the greatest. Service is slow. Food came to our table and it was cold. Waiter ""bus boy"" gave good service in taking away the used dishes."
Nikki C.,"Pearl City, HI",59,31,49,3.0,7/14/2017,"Went here on a Saturday night, was expecting to wait a while being the mall was quite packed and all restaurant were full. We checked in, then got seated about 15 minutes later.  They sat us near the bar area, it was clean for a busy night. You go to some restaurants and sit next to the bar and its a shit show.  Our server was Caelan, greeted us right away and took our drink order. Then came back a few mins later and took our dinner order.  I actually had to use the restroom, so I might as well mention that it was clean. I do however want to mention, while walking to the restroom you pass the entrance/exit of kitchen so I almost got clipped by a tray. Im thinking the walkway is kinda narrow with some blind spots- but whatever maybe the waiters will learn to take the corners more cautiously.  Food came maybe 10-15 mins later; we ordered the sampler appetizers. I must say that I enjoyed the artichoke dip much more then I do CPK's. The rest was good too, but the dip was best- might just get that as a full order next time.  Dinner- I had the 8oz top sirloin with garlic green beans & a loaded baked potato. Listen when I order steak from these places I dont expect it to be anything like Ruth's Chris, Mortons, or any of those other steak houses- so I cant complain, it was a bit over cooked for my taste, but like I said I've never had any Chilis, Outback or Red Lobster type of restaurant really impress me with the steak (so I have no idea why I always order, thats why I cant complain).  The green beans were, mehh. The loaded baked was mostly sour cream, like so much sour cream and hardy any cheese, bacon, and chives. So All in all. it was okay- not the best but then again not the worse.  My hubs had the ribs. He liked the mashed potatoes, also his green beans. However his ribs were stuck to the rib, lol. It didnt fall off the bone, which made it difficult to eat, he gave up half way through and was over it. So yeah, Idk maybe it was a bad batch of ribs being it was tough, but I do know he wont order that again.  Dessert- We shared the triple chocolate melt down. It was awesome. They also dont skimp on the ice cream, so thats a plus. I hate ordering dessert and getting the sorriest scoop of ice cream. LOl. It was chocolate heaven.  Service- Caelan was great. Very friendly, attentive and even made conversation with us. You can see that he enjoys his job.  So In regards to my Star ratings, I still fell like its a new restaurant and in time they will find their way. The food was mediocre, the dessert was great, and the service was exceptional. As long as they keep up with serving their customers well, in time they will be a well rounded restaurant deserving 4 or 5 stars."
Emilee P.,"Kapolei, HI",17,26,20,3.0,4/16/2017,"This is the new Applebee's location at Ka Makana Ali'i. I haven't been to an Applebee's in about 10 years and it's changed a lot from what I remember. The decor is very minimal. The entrance is somewhat crowded- it seems like that area was badly planned. There is only room for about 4-6 people to sit and wait, otherwise you have to go outside. They currently have no benches outside so you just have to stand around. (Edit: I checked again and yes there is one bench) Come in the evening so you're not standing in the hot sun. The server greeted us almost immediately and we got drinks and an appetizer with no problem. The main entree was a bit of a wait but they are in their first few days of being open, so I understand that they're figuring out the timing with the kitchen. No complaints with the food or server. I thought the music was a little loud because I couldn't hear people at my table at times. I would give it overall a 3.5 for now, and will visit again in a couple months. UNFORTUNATELY we were seated near a table full of a******s. These people were absolutely ridiculous. I felt so bad for the server. If you go to a brand new restaurant within the first week of opening, you should expect there to be small issues in timing or wrong orders. Whatever, let them know and they will fix it. Here's what NOT to do: snap at the wait staff like they are dogs, yell across the entire restaurant for a manager, walk into the kitchen, yell obscene things when families with small children are nearby, oh and walk out of the restaurant without paying after you have received drinks and appetizers. Advice: it's a brand new place figuring out their flow and timing. If you want everything to be 100% then wait to visit for a while. If you're going to be a total jerk to everyone, stay home. Otherwise check it out and if you feel like it, give constructive criticism on things they can fix."
Jason L.,"San Diego, CA",4,133,25,2.0,4/23/2017,"Came in on a Sunday to grab some dinner around 5:00PM. Not too busy, asked for table and was directed to the bar. Okay, I'll oblige, it was just me, all things considered. A bit more ""bar atmosphere"" than most Applebees I've been in - loud music playing, lots of people having drinks, not a lot of children / families. Ordered some food, came out and was almost delivered to the wrong person. I claimed the food as mine and it was set down. Food was good, hot, well prepared. About 1/2 way through my pupus the bartender asked if I wanted anything else, I put in for dessert. It literally took 20+ minutes to put together a brownie on a hot plate with a scoop of ice cream, and when it came out, it didn't even have the cream cheese topping. The bartender added it from a solo cup after the fact. I've ate at a lot of Applebee's over the years...this one is not only overpriced ($13 bucks for 6 boneless wings and 5 shrimp?) but the back house is too slow. Friendly servers, good food (although, crazy small portions) - I personally won't be back, but I'm sure it'll be a good fit for many, considering Applebees is new to the island."
deanna f.,"Kapolei, HI",1,2,,1.0,11/25/2017,"Customer service is bad, 30 minute wait when the restaurant is less than half full. Then we got seated and waited another 15 just for the waiter to acknowledge that we were here. We ordered grilled cheese for the kids. Other half ordered a classic burger with all the fixings with sweet potato fries. Server brought out grilled chicken, I sent it back but the server was trying to get the kids to eat it. Burger came out dry with just cheese and regular fries. This place seriously needs better management and more staff. Sorry but last time we are going to come here."
Shane P.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,1,,3.0,6/9/2017,"Being that this is just an Applebees, I never expected much from it. This is a pretty new restaurant in an upscale area, so a friend and I were excited to try! We went on a Friday around lunch time and were seated immediately, however, we were seated all the way in the back near the bathrooms. Not sure if this is normal or whatever, but it was a little far away, and we had no views or TV. Service overall was okay, nothing special, nothing awful. There wasn't any proper introduction from any of the staff; it was pretty much just sit, order, eat, and leave. I never got any names of any of the three (yes, three) different waitresses that served us. Like I said though, the service wasn't awful, it just wasn't special.  As for the food, we did the combo meal where we could get an appetizer and two entrees for around $30. Really good value, food was just okay. I got the Fiesta Chicken, which consisted of an overcooked chicken breast, Mexican sauce, and cheese on a bed of tortilla chips. It also came with a side of Spanish rice, kinda tasted like dirt. Bland. While the chicken was a bit overdone, it was overall pretty good. The other entree was a Chicken Artichoke Pasta, which, when finished, ended up like a spinach pasta dish with two pieces of chicken. It was good though, just had a bit too much spinach.  3 stars for okay service, okay food, and an overall experience nothing short of, well, mediocre."
Rapunzel L.,"Honolulu, HI",0,8,,3.0,10/13/2017,"We have eaten here on 2 separate occassions.  The food is reasonably priced, quality and flavor of food is actually very good.  The reasoning for the 3 stars: 1) On both occasions our food took over 40 minutes to come out after ordering.  Neither of our visits were during a dinner rush and never had more than 30 patrons.  2) On our most recent visit on 10/12 at about 3PM we had multiple service issues.  First we sat without being greeted for over 10 minutes. Then we finally got a ""be right there"" over the shoulder shout.  15 minutes in our drinks arrived.  Food came out after 40 minutes, but one of our orders was incorrect.  We didn't want to have to wait another half an hour for a correction so just took it as is.  Lastly, and this is by far the worst, our server asked if we needed change on a $38 tab when we had given him $50.  Even excellent service doesn't call for a 30% tip.  The server then returned with a $10 bill instead of change as requested, when I told him that's not what I wanted he pocketed the $10 and said ""Oh this is mine? Thanks"".  I literally was in shock. I had to stop him and correct him yet again.   All in all great deals, concept, decor, food...please work on staff training and kitchen ticket times; we'd hate to not return when there's so much potential."
Jerome B.,"Kapolei, HI",0,21,6,1.0,7/30/2017,"Always excited to see new dining establishments come to the west side of the island. Had an open house today and needed to kill a few hours so I  decided to give this new eatery a place.  Already giving their Ewa Beach store and opportunity and oh so failing to meet the grade...I decided to give Kapolei a shot. It took me every bit of two minutes to make a decision to stay or go. Let's just say lucky for them the Dodger game was on and that was a prerequisite on my part.  This store was worse than the Ewa Beach store. Simply pathetic! I often wonder where are the owners in these franchises. They can't be coming in to check on their mega million dollar investment. Because if they see what I see they would make drastic changes. Or at lest I would.  Walked past the seats behind the bar and looked at dirty dishes, glasses and silverware everywhere. Stayed like that for the better part of 1-1/2 hours. The bartender had zero help. So I can't blame her. We stood on a sticky floor just to get a seat at the bar. It took over 15 minutes just to get he dirty dishes and counter wiped so we could even begin to feel settled in. Pathetic!  The bar counter and other areas were just covered with dirty glasses. Food service was slow at best. Do I need to mention the bug that flew into my glass of wine? Enough said!"
Jesenia J.,"Honolulu, HI",29,1,,5.0,12/14/2017,"This place is definitely very comfortable, the service is incredible and the food is awesome!  I recommend everything on the menu! our server was great. Very polite and attentive!"
