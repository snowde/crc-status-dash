Jeffrey B.,"Mililani, HI",26,73,25,3.0,9/9/2017,First time here and ate the Whiskey Bacon burger.  Service was a little slow but the food made up for it.
May Jane T.,"Ewa Beach, HI",177,58,31,4.0,6/6/2017,"Me and my coworker went here after to work to relax, drink and eat some pupu's. We split the 3 choice appetizer sample (steak quesadilla, chicken won ton tacos, spinach artichoke dip) all three was delicious but the chicken won ton tacos was my most favorite! Our server was awesome, he recommended a the Lemon Squeeze Strawberry cocktail and the watermelon sangria which was both really good. The watermelon Sangria was the best one though, it kinda reminds you of a jolly rancher. He checked up on us and refilled our chips for the dip and made sure we were okay. Again great service, food and drinks were delicious and both me and our coworker got really full off that sharing one appetizer (we were really hungry, too!). We'll definitely be back, most likely for that watermelon Sangria"
Paul S.,"Lehi, UT",97,2,1,5.0,4/22/2017,"Since its opening I have been here almost every day. I like to come in for the happy hour bar specials. This bar is best in Kapolei. I ask to watch certain baseball games and the staff is on it. There is nothing in the area that can compare to the drink specials here. Service is great. Especially at the bar area... love it. All the bartenders are amazing but shot out to Kimberly and Holly. My wife and I stop in just to have a quick beer, wings and good conversation. Even the managers are as attentive as the servers and bartenders. The bar manager/trainer during the opening, Derrick is awesome! Really great job here in Kapolei with this Applebees! Super excited the Island has this location. Keep up the good work!"
J S.,"Kapolei, HI",1,34,,3.0,10/8/2017,We waited 10 minutes to get seated and less than 5 minutes for our waitress to get our drink order. We did the special...Meal for 2 for $35 and we checked in with yelp to get free chips and salsa. The food was DELICIOUS. The staff did a great job i keeping our coffee and soda filled at all times. The negative part of this is the music was extremely loud that i felt like i was yelling at my waitress and yelling to talk to my better half. How do you enjoy date nite if i can't enjoy a conversation? Will i be coming back? Yes because the food is good and its in my neighborhood.
Sasha C.,"Aiea, HI",2,6,,1.0,9/10/2017,"We had one of the worst services here. And to make it worse, that was our first time there. My parents have been there once before. And they said everything was perfect. But when we went last night. We instantly had terrible service. She wasn't friendly. Didn't even seem like she wanted to help us. Didn't seem like she enjoyed her job. Or even wanted it for that matter. As if she couldn't care less if she did a good job or not. She also seemed very impatient. And when we had asked questions. She didn't seem to know the answer or want to find out the answer. Our servers name was Sylvia I believe. And the only person that seemed of the most help. Was the hostess. Our food was sitting there for how long. We sat perfectly in front of the window to see our food sitting there forever. And on top of that, we didn't receive all of our food. And they still charged us for it. Of course we said something and they took it off. But there were how many severs and people in the kitchen who clearly saw it still sitting there. And yet nobody even bothered to acknowledge the fact that it was someone's food sitting there. And hasn't received it. I would give this zero stars if I could. Even my parents said we aren't going back there ever again. The entrees were cold when we received it. Took over 30 minutes just to receive our appetizers. Also cold. We waited so long to eat. We at all the appetizers than our actual food. And honestly the appetizers tasted better than the main course. To make it even worse than the already terrible service we received. Before we were even seated. We had been told that the wait was 45mins-1hr. And we clearly saw how many OPEN tables there were. But none of the workers cleared it. There was multiple tables still sitting there with dirty dishes and food everywhere. Even as we left the restaurant the same tables we saw to begin with. Still has food on it. They don't care much for maintaining their restaurant. Nor do they care how long the dirty dishes sit there. We clearly saw 5 tables that's could've easily been cleaned so that more people could be seated faster. And towards the end of our dinner they had already started cleaning the bathroom and there were still a couple tables left. And they had closed the bathroom. So no one could use it. This is very unorganized restaurant. I expected more from this place It was very disappointing. Especially being there for our first time. We definitely will not be back. Huge disappointment. More than disappointing. It was unbelievable"
Shayne S.,"Waianae, HI",0,8,,1.0,11/19/2017,"This place was literally hell. First they ran out of steak, ribs, salads, won tons. Who runs out of won tons and salads?? Then they took an hour to bring the food out. But wait, there's more. The food was ice cold. And the stir fry was raw and the rice was mushy. I thought it was a frosty from Dairy Queen. I could flip it upside down. The staff was walking around doing nothing but talking and laughing. Ohhh and then, these two girls came in and got everything then ordered withing 10 minutes. 0 out of 100 never again."
C K.,"Mililani, HI",0,1,,2.0,12/3/2017,"Server was friendly but service slow. Restaurant not crowded but took about 40 minutes to get our food. I also ordered a plate with whole grains, but it was served to me on white rice. Server said they ran out of the whole grains. I think they should have told me when I ordered so I had option to change order. I ate it anyway since it took so long to get food. Flavor was ok but overall very disappointed. Won't return."
Naoto T.,"Honolulu, HI",4,25,3,4.0,6/3/2017,"It's seems to me like Chilis but the menu is different.  I always wanted to try Applebees but never had a chance to. Since it opened in Hawaii for its first location, we have gave it a shot. But the thing is the vibes and food are just like Chilis. The menu has your favorite burgers, fajitas, chicken, and much more. More and more I see the menu it clearly looks exactly like Chilis but the name is different from the outside. I mean food is good, menu is great, but the service and staff should work on it more. On Our first visit, we didn't have a bad server but the couple right next to us have ordered a appetizer first but instead the entree came out first. Realized that both of our table and theirs were the same waitress but having bad service there but not to us. Overall, came to full meal and ended up watch Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man Tell No Tales."
Stephanie C.,"Honolulu, HI",58,6,15,3.0,4/15/2017,"The rating should be 3.5 stars just because service was great. Located in the Ka Makana Ali'i shopping center. Our server was attentive, refilling waters and answering any questions we had about the menu. She even offered us lemon in our water. We ordered the chicken wonton tacos for an appetizer. It was pretty good. The description said it was tangy chicken but I thought it tasted more sweet than tangy. For our entrees we shared the spinach artichoke chicken cavatappi and the southwestern steak salad. The pasta tasted like spinach artichoke dip on pasta, but it was cheesy and delicious. The grilled chicken was yummy too. The steak salad was meh. The picture on the menu made it look so good! The steak was hard and overcooked. I let the waitress know and she asked if we wanted a new salad or something different. I asked them to make grilled chicken instead. They brought it our promptly and I felt like that made up for the steak error. Overall, service was great, food was okay. Not sure if I'll be back again."
Kaweheonapuanokawahineokaliula D.,"Waianae, HI",13,9,6,3.0,6/12/2017,This is my first time here at Applebee's. Our wait time was 15-20 min because the table were not ready and the guy at the door said the servers had to wipe the tables and they weren't . They were also short staffed.  Waiting almost 30 for my food.. Im not too sure if I will come back to this one but maybe my second visit will be better.. Food was good.. and that's why I gave the 3 starts
Andrew L.,"Kapolei, HI",0,5,2,1.0,10/8/2017,Tried to order carry out but the phone was literally taken off the hook. I know this cause I went there and saw the phone off the hook. If you don't want to do carry out then don't do it but don't be rude and leave your phone off the hook.  Lost this customer!
Carlee P.,"Kaneohe, HI",9,5,16,4.0,5/13/2017,"New restaurant, so we did expect to wait a bit.  The place was packed, but the atmosphere was nice and music was at a good level, my friend and I were able to talk stories while we waited for the food.  The menu has a variety of selections.  The food was worth the wait.  Presentation was nice and the steak and burger was cooked exactly how we ordered it.  Joseph our server provided excellent service.  Amanda the manager was visible and keep the clientele happy.  We will definitely be back again!  Thanks for a great first experience at Applebee's!"
Odette E.,"Sacramento, CA",0,10,,3.0,10/7/2017,"Haven't been to an Applebees in a long time. The interior decor is different from the restaurants we have been to in the past.  Food was just ok, but our server was great. Front desk hostesses were slow."
Leticia A.,"Long Beach, CA",0,9,1,4.0,11/28/2017,"Excellent service, came in for lunch and Patricia served us at the bar, had two different kinds of margarita, original on the rocks and the perfect margarita, both were well made to order. My husband had dos equis on draught, which was cold, and ""delish"" per his words. We both had the classic cheeseburger, both were cooked well (as ordered) by Kyle and Ryan and the burger was seasoned, condiments and vegetables were served on the side so we could put on the cheeseburger what we would like. French fries were fresh, hot, and not overly salted. Only improvements I could think of would be to have a couple more pickles and another tomato slice with the burger, but All of the staff were very pleasant and we will definitely be back!"
Mariah K.,"Kapolei, HI",234,96,85,5.0,4/26/2017,"This place is still new so of course they'll have to work out a few kinks to work out, but we came here for lunch on a Wednesday and we had a great experience. Our server was Leilani and she was friendly and attentive with refills and taking away empty dishes. We ordered appetizers before our entrees and the appetizers were out promptly and held us over while we waited for our food. Entrees were worth the wait and everyone enjoyed what they ordered. Although we dined in, I saw a sign that it was all day happy hour at the bar. They have a wide variety of hand crafted cocktails and beers on tap so I'll definitely be back to try their drinks."
Li P.,"Kapolei, HI",0,6,,1.0,12/5/2017,"My husband and I went to Applebee's (Kapolei - Ka Makana Alii) at 3:00 pm on Sunday afternoon.  We were told that there was a 5 minute wait.  From where we were sitting we could see more than 5 tables open (which should have been the sign to go to another place).  We were seated and sat there for about 10 minutes no waiter/waitress came by to offer anything.  Finally a waitress stops by and asks ""anyone helped you yet?""  We told her ""no.""   No smile on her face like she didn't want to be there.  We order drinks from the bar and water.  Approx. 10 min later the drinks are delivered and we immediately gave her our food order afraid we won't have anyone else stop by our table.  It was 4:15 pm and we still were sitting there with no food.  I looked over and saw people who were there when we walked in and they still did not have their food. I stood up and went to the Hostess and asked her for our tab (for the drinks only). We walked over to the Cheesecake Factory and was apprehensive because there were so many people.  We were seated right away, got our drinks and bread within the first 10 minutes of sitting there then we ordered our food that came out 10-15 minutes after.  We had a waitress named Sage and she just made us forget about our experience at Applebees.  Never again!"
Ashley N.,"Waianae, HI",206,14,53,5.0,4/12/2017,Great atmosphere!! Brand new at the Kamakana Alii mall!! Great service and food came out fast! Great deals too!! We will be back for sure
Amy T.,"Honolulu, HI",50,47,69,4.0,4/22/2017,"New restaurant and great food. The chicken wontons are great as well as the bone-in chicken wings. Chocolate chip cookie is delicious. The kitchen knows their stuff.  Since it just opened, service is still getting the flow and timing down so we had to wait extra long and remind things they forgot but they are sweet and will try to fix things. The servers seem young and not as experienced so hopefully it will get better once more time passes."
Alvin L.,"Downtown, Honolulu, HI",1,27,38,4.0,5/23/2017,"Haven't eaten at Applebee's in over 5 years and decided to try the newly opened restaurant at the Ka Makana Alii Shopping Complex. No lines at 7pm and sat immediately on a weekday evening. Sat down at the bar and it was a good call. Kristina and Holly were super attentive and got my drink and order quickly. Had a House Salad and a Steak which came in a reasonable time.  The House Salad was ok, although I wasn't sure why cheese was sprinkled on it. Steak was cooked to the requested temp and was tender and juicy.  The Garlic Greenbeans with Bacon side rocked. The Baked Potato was done right. All in all, was happy with my selection and left full enough where I declined dessert.   I would probably come back during football season, as it looks like it would be a fun place to hang and watch a game or two."
Lynna B.,"Honolulu, HI",0,4,,5.0,12/2/2017,The food was GREAT! And the appetizers during Happy Hour were all amazing. Coming back for sure.
