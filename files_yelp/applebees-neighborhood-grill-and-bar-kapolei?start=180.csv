Mario H.,"Honolulu, HI",86,3,,2.0,7/25/2017,"Went to dinner with my wife. Restaurant was not busy at all with lots of empty seats but still took 15 mins to get seated. Once seated no one came to serve us for almost 15 mins. When our server showed up, he was nice and apologized for taking to long. He offered us a free soda for taking to long. We ordered a strawberry lemonade and  a watermelon sangria and also our food. We got the lemonade quickly and waited on the sangria. The lemonade was warm and was the sweetest drink I had ever tasted. It was like drinking syrup. It took another 20 min just to get our chips and salsa. After that another 20 min for our main dishes came. My wife had ordered steak and salad and I had shrimp won ton stir fry. My wife's steak was super wall but was good. My food was good also. The only thing was we still had not gotten our side of rice, fries, or my sangria. We waited another 15 min before we found our waiter and informed him that we were still waiting. 10 mins later we got the rice, fries, and sangria. They didn't charge for the sangria because it took to long.  Overall. This was one of the worst experiences that I have had at a restaurant in a long time. We were just frustrated by the end. The food is good but they need to work on the service. It look like they just don't have enough servers. We don't plan on returning, would rather go to Chills."
Jeremy U.,"Ewa Beach, HI",17,60,84,2.0,8/25/2017,"Service was really bad. It took awhile to get a menu, get the order down, get the  food and the check. The time between everything was at least 15 mins. The other tables around were also waiting just as long to get their things. Food was alright, service need a big improvement. I go again when I wanna kill time."
Mariah S.,"Hickam Field, Honolulu, HI",25,1,,5.0,11/25/2017,"Love Applebee's!! Our server and her trainer (Natalie & Dedee) was very welcoming and our food came out very quick! Very good service, will definitely be returning!"
Kryssy T.,"Waipahu, HI",0,14,3,5.0,9/5/2017,"My fiancé and I just dined at this location on Monday, September 4, 2017 (Labor Day) and had such great, quick service. We got there a couple minutes past opening and we were greeted and seated right away. Our server, Chelsea, was also the bartender and even with several couples seated at the bar she was really attentive to her other tables. The food came out really quickly and was brought out by the hostess who was also very attentive and friendly as she even filled our drinks when she dropped off our appetizer.  Overall I will definitely be back at this location. I prefer this location to the other one because the service and food was soooo much better!"
Dani P.,"Mililani, HI",116,5,1,1.0,11/30/2017,"Terrible wait times, and terrible food. Got here early enough--there were only 3 other tables occupied by small groups. Our waitress was initially attentive but that didn't last long. After ordering, our appetizer came fairly quickly. Too bad the chips for our spinach artichoke dip were stale on top and soaked with oil on the bottom. Our entrees after that took nearly an hour to come after that, which is crazy because the establishment was nearly empty and there were several wait staff. On top of that, 2/3 of our entrees were sitting out so long that the cheese hardened and the rest was room temperature. By that point our waitress was just MIA and the person we had to flag down to reheat our food was a manager. My husband ended up having to flag down the waitress to get the bill and boxes. He then had to get up from the table and physically hand her the check because she was too busy standing around watching the cooks push food out. Terrible and ridiculous."
John H.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,69,68,5.0,9/3/2017,"Had lime and cheese chicken with Spanish rice and pico, very goodies of flavor. Arrived at  7 pm and no wait and ordered right away."
Tehani M.,"Kapolei, HI",0,3,,1.0,12/29/2017,"It was our first time to this location today because we normally go to the Ewa location. We went for lunch and surprisingly it wasn't busy at all considering we were seated rather quickly. There were 7 in our party--3 adults & 4 children.  Put in our order of drinks & entrees. Then the wait. After 15 minutes, the first to come out was the Onion Rings appetizer which came with 5 rings. Ten minutes later, the kids got their food. Eight minutes after that my Mom & I finally got our Tomato Basil soups (which was actually part of the Lunch Combo Special they offer M-F til 3p) that were supposed to be served with our choice of sandwich. Our sandwiches came out SEPERATELY 10 minutes later! I was done with my soup already! Horrible experience but our server Jake was very attentive as far as refilling our drinks & courteous for the most part, hence, the 1 star rating. From now on, our family will just go back & stick to the Ewa location."
Marty F.,"Kapolei, HI",0,16,6,4.0,8/24/2017,"Had a nice lunch here, check in on yelp and get a free app! Also had the won ton chicken tacos and the boneless buffalo wings, siriacha shrimp, club grille and Thai shrimp salad. All were outstanding. Chips and salsa come with free refills, gotta love that! Ice cold beers and the food server was so nice and knowledgeable about all the items I asked her about! And the price is right! Will be back"
Karen F.,"Waianae, HI",0,4,,5.0,9/15/2017,"Our first visit at 2 pm on Friday Sept 15, 17. Lunch crowd was gone but the staff was on their toes and at our service. We ordered double breaded chicken wings, cedar plank salmon, maple sweet potatoes, broccoli, French onion soup, and wonton tacos at the hostess recommendation. I honestly can say that my husband and I can not remember when each food item was perfect.  All food was served hot and well flavored.  I never had broccoli that was salted and buttered so good not to mention still green and slightly crisp instead of mushy and yellow.  The wonton tacos are fantastic.  This experience was so good that we even ordered our own deserts.  WE NEVER DO THAT!  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  We will go back and I am hard to impress. I have done this job (waitress and bartend).  My martini was perfect and well chilled. A+"
Nadine A.,"Waipahu, HI",0,1,,4.0,11/26/2017,We were very impressed with this place and our waitress Didi was outstanding and helped me with my yelp for our free chips and salsa. We ordered the taco dinner and we truly enjoyed our dinner. We were seated right away and the food service was fast. Didi was very pleasant and made our dinner experience enjoyable..
Rene L.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,,1.0,11/26/2017,"We were so excited that this place was opening  here. We loved eating at Applebee's on the mainland and the we were so disappointed!  Sooo sad. First we asked for a table because my husband didn't want sit high on a stool but they tell us there were no tables available, yet there was so where do they sit us on the high booth. And what was worst the family behind us get seated at the table we inquired about. The waitress knew we were not too happy but she was not a problem she was nice and helpful but already my husband was upset so nothing was going to make up for the first experience. The food then comes but it was greasy and oily horrible so we never went back. We also talked to others that have eaten at restaurants on the mainland and they were totally disappointed too. It is hard to go back once you get a bad experience!!!"
Tui T.,"Kailua, HI",0,5,1,1.0,7/17/2017,"This was my favorite place to eat in Colorado until i went there last night. Ambience is kind of industrial and different and I thought it was pretty cool. I was greeted by a smiling face and also had to wait about 30 minutes which was ok. We finally got our text and was super excited to finally dive into some food. We were seated and greeted by Hunter the assistant waiter i think he was in training, very nice kid. Took our order promptly and abou 20 minutes later i was still sitting without water. WATER?!?!?! I had to ask another server to get us some water and still took 10 minutes for the drinks to arrive. Not good! Then our appetizers came yay. That was good. 40 minutes later our food arrived. My salad was probably made right away and just sitting so by the time i got it , it was SOGGY. I was livid but my bf doesn't like confrontation or me acting out. So I remain ILL like disgusted. Ps. Do not go there, service is horrible and everyones a fucken snob."
Bryson B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",5,26,14,2.0,8/16/2017,My first time dinning here party of three it took over 30 minutes to complete our order.The spinach and artichoke taste delicious.The shrimp stir fry was still cooking while being brought out .The ribs was good .Overall a would rate this store 2 since tv is on mute when there football game
Sam P.,"Waipahu, HI",0,2,1,1.0,7/2/2017,"Dining experience on 01 July at Kapolei: Arrived at this restaurant at about 630 pm and was told it will be about half an hour wait. We told the hosts that we will be right outside to wait. Forty five minutes went by and we're still waitng to be called. Finally went in and asked how much longer the wait is, and found out there were several open tables, and no one bothered to call us. Did they forget to call us?   Once seated, we ordered our drinks and waited. And waited. Another 15 minutes went by, I told another server about our wait, and the drinks finally came in. We ordered our food, a half rack of ribs & chicken with a loaded baked potato, bbq brisket tacos, corn dog, mac and cheese, steak and shrimp combo, the butcher's reserve sirloin steak and some appetizers.   My food came with fries and garlicky green beans. They were alright, not salty and tastes well. But the rack of ribs was dry, salty and tough. The chicken was seasoned right but like the ribs, it was dry and tough. And the baked potate wasn't buttered, and came in with excessive sour cream on it. My family had their own comments about the food, and I'll leave it like that.   The bill came and it was someone else's bill. What a surprise! The manager corrected it, and I paid. With the poor service from start to finish, I felt that no gratuity is deserved.  SUGGESTION TO MANAGEMENT: Close the restaurant for a day and re-train everyone. You're lucky to get a 1-star rating!"
Christianne N.,"Kapolei, HI",119,18,25,1.0,7/9/2017,"This was my first time here and I don't think I'll come back anytime soon! Our server did the best she could, but due to the lack of communication with the kitchen...most things my child ordered was not available until a later time. Not once, but twice she had to come back to our table to have him choose something different! Not acceptable, but since she seemed sincerely apologetic we ended up sticking with the ribs (which they apparently don't have until after 12pm and we were here since 11am). She came back the second time to say that baked potatoes aren't available until after 4pm!! Seriously!!! Again...unacceptable!! On top of that, the food turnaround is quite slow. Like I said, we were here at 11am and my other son didn't receive his chicken tenders and fries until after 12pm. The portion was so small, that there's no reason for it to take that long to come out!! In fact, its two fried items...it shouldn't take that long to come out period!! I ordered a firecracker shrimp pasta that was so unappetizing that I had a stomach ache. What made me more upset was the fact that there was no management to assist with the situation. That's poor customer service! I work in the customer service industry and I have no idea who does their training because this is by far the worst experience I have had. The Wendy's at the same mall has impeccable service and this corporation should take some note from that fast food joint! It's no wonder it took so long for Applebees to come to Hawaii and Im sure it won't be here for long! I give you one star for the nice server...it wasn't her fault!"
Randy G.,"Pearl City, HI",65,3,2,5.0,8/23/2017,I had the 4 cheese MAC and cheese and chicken strips and it was delicious.  My wife and I had the French onion soup and the chocolate chip cookie sundae also.  Both of which i would recommend. The place was very clean and our waitress Kiani was very nice and never had to ask for anything as she was on top of it.  First time ever coming to this location and definitely will be back.
Plix E.,"Aiea, HI",0,5,,2.0,7/12/2017,"We liked our food, but took fooooorrrrreever. Wasn't busy & we barely saw our server."
Stevi P.,"Ewa Beach, HI",50,147,154,2.0,6/4/2017,"Walked in to apple bees for lunch and was seated immediately by the bar area at about 11:45 am.  There was no one in the restaurant except for us and another couple on a table next to us.  It took a while for our waitress to come and introduce herself to us and take our drink orders as well.  We waited, talked stories and finally after 20-25 min our waitress finally came over. We ordered our drinks.  Our drinks didn't come to us until about 15 min. Later.  By that time we already knew what we wanted to order. We placed our order with her and waited again.... almost an hour later not even exaggerating at this point the manager comes to us and says that our ribs were accidentally dropped on the floor and they would have to make a new set. She brought out the rest of the food (which was cold) for our table and waited on the ribs. Ribs eventually came out and the manager said they would give us a dessert on them... mind you the dessert also took a long time to come out and the ice cream was melted already. We were beyond frustrated and was in there for about 2 and a half hours waiting for food. Even to pay, it took a while for her to come back and give us our receipts and cards back.  The service was amazing don't get me wrong, however I think they need to come up with a better system on how to run things. The food also tasted great if it wasn't cold. I'm not to sure if I'll be giving this place another chance."
Rob B.,"Kapolei, HI",6,5,,2.0,7/22/2017,Food was average. Good value for the kids menu. My daughter thought the chicken mac&cheese was the best she ever had. I had the cedar plank salmon and it was pretty overcooked and dry. We also not impressed with the Thai shrimp salad. Service was slow. Our food took a long time to come out and had to ask multiple times for drink refills. No rush to head back here.
