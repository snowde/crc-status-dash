Raizza A.,"Kapolei, HI",1,2,,1.0,4/13/2017,"Horrible service!!! I know it's new in the area but c'mon for 1hour wait!! and I made a reservation. I'm not going back to this place again, friendly staff but the food sucks"
Nehcole P.,"Mililani, HI",132,9,3,3.0,7/30/2017,"Went to dinner there around 4:45. Got seated pretty quickly, it wasn't busy. For it being half empty, the service was slow. Our sons food came out quick but our food came out a very long time after that. The food was alright, could be better, but just waiting for it was too long, and we weren't getting any updates on our order."
Ryan M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",405,1,,1.0,4/23/2017,"First time here and we already had a bad experience. Wait time was understandable. About 30 min wait time. But when we got seated, we waited 15 min for our drinks to arrive and another 10 min for our order to be taken and then 20 min for our food to arrive. And to make it all worst, they had seated us right next to the Restroom and there is about 9 other tables that are available. Very disappointed.."
Jamie S.,"Kapolei, HI",119,84,35,3.0,6/29/2017,"The kids Mac n cheese with chicken tastes like chicken noodle soup, it's weird and my 4 year old insists it is chicken noodle soup.  My dish was fresher, but lacked good flavor.  I got the cavatappi with spinach and artichoke, and got 1 tiny artichoke leaf.  Service was fine, and it looks nice inside."
Kapua K.,"Līhuʻe, HI",0,5,4,2.0,4/29/2017,40 minute wait for a classic burger and fries.  My fries were cold!  My daughter had the Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich and the coating around the chicken was burnt.
'Ihilani A.,"Kapolei, HI",214,11,14,1.0,5/23/2017,"What are the chances that you find not 1, but 2 hairs in your food & drinks?! This experience was so crappy & it was honestly so sad because I was expecting so much more. I would say the only good thing about this experience was the waitress & her name was Kalena. Kalena, if you ever read this post, giiiirl you're good at your job. Anyways, unfortunately my boyfriend found a long piece of black hair just basically swimming at the bottom of his cup & we only saw it while we were trying to stir the drink. The waitress got us a new one. THEN, the appetizers come out & there's white hairs on our chips.... So then we send it back. I'm assuming she's a manager because she was the only one wearing a blue shirt, but she came out give us our new spinach artichoke dip & said ""sorry about that"" & walked away. Kalena came back & asked us if she came to talk to us & my boyfriend said yes, but I wouldnt really say that was talking. She didn't address the issue at all, just said sorry & walked away. The food however was alright. Nothing special, everything on their menu looks like easy stuff you can basically make at home. I didn't really like much so I just got their bourbon chicken & shrimp with a side of rice. Their rice was hard, but the chicken was really juicy. Bottom line, we probably won't be coming back. But the one star is for you Kalena, you were so nice & we felt so bad that you got stuck with having to take our stuff back because of all the hairs, but you're great!"
Tony G.,"Honolulu, HI",5,19,9,4.0,7/13/2017,This is a nice spot. Doesn't look like a traditional Applebee's. Has a nice modern inner city look. Food was good. Service too.
Joyce A.,"Ewa Beach, HI",1,38,35,1.0,5/26/2017,"Well. Let's just start off with me placing a takeout order.  I called before they were open, but they graciously took my order  which was only two burgers with fries.  U was told that she would place the order as soon as they opened which was 11am. We were coming from Waipahu,  so we left at 10:54am giving us ample time to get there.  We did not receive our food till 11:30..we were told that it would be ready at 11:15...maybe this is acceptable to some people, but not to me, if you say, it will be ready at a certain time, it very well should be.  If we were told to pick it up by 11:30, that would have been fine. I didn't even eat the food yet, but I already have a bad taste in my mouth, will update review after eating and calming down"
J M.,"Honolulu, HI",2,6,8,3.0,10/14/2017,"This was my first time eating at Applebee's.  Started the night off with a 45 min wait for our table then another 45 min wait our food.  Almost thought we were eating a a fine dining joint.  Ordered a full rack of honey BBQ ribs with rice and grilled veggies.  The ribs were moist and flavorful just a little burnt.  The grilled veggies were pretty good. I would order that side again.  The rice was dry and a little undercooked hence the three stars. Would I go there again? Probably, since my in laws seem to like it there."
Alexis C.,"Mililani, HI",0,1,,2.0,4/15/2017,"My family and I just left the establishment and our experience wasn't a great one.  The inside is very nice and clean and appealing to the eye but the service and food wasn't so great. We ordered the 2 for $25. They brought our appetizer out and gave it to the table behind us. That table had literally been seated for maybe 5 minutes and received our appetizer when we had already been there for about 15-20 minutes.  Our waiter took forever to come and check on us and when they finally did, we told them that we thought that our appetizer was given to someone else. They went back to check if that is what happened and yes, that's definitely what had happened. We eventually got our appetizer which wasn't even that great.  When they were bringing our entrees out, yet again, they gave our food to the SAME wrong table. This time the other table spoke up and said that that was not what they ordered, which is when I cut in and said that that was our food. The waiter then told us that they were going to take our food back and bring us ""fresh plates."" My husbands food was cold, and so was my daughters. Thankfully mine was not but for having to wait that long, and having them mess up more than once, their food should not have been cold.  We didn't tell them that the food was cold because by then we were all starving and decided to just eat our meals. They apologized but didn't try to compensate us in anyway.  Mediocre food and not so good service. I understand they just opened but servers should at least know which table is which. It's their job and if they don't feel confident in doing it correctly then maybe they need more training."
Donny F.,"Ewa Beach, HI",118,7,,1.0,5/20/2017,"There were 2 parties who came after us and got seated before us. The place isn't even that full. Staff just seems unorganized. One star for me. I know they just recently opened, but Applebees is nation wide. They should know how to handle wait times properly"
Paige B.,"Honolulu, HI",0,7,,1.0,4/14/2017,Waited over an 1 1/2 hours for food. The place was practically empty. Other tables were gettting their food. Don't go here when your starving. I should've had copious amounts of beer to fill the void.
Frank E.,"Kapolei, HI",26,1,,1.0,5/20/2017,"First of all, I want to say we were seated pretty quickly. I am not one to usually complain about restaurants and I have had pretty good luck with Applebees in the past. Our server was new and very apologetic however the wait time was unbelievable. My wife and I had been at our table for about 20 min before we were able to order our appetizers and our meal. Needless to say 40 minutes later, we had still not received any of our food let alone our apps which should have been about 10 min. We had watched other customers who came in about 30 min after we had arrived and already had their apps and food. We finally just got up after an hour and left to go to da Cove at Ka makana alii. Very good service and food. They will get a good review."
Dextin A.,"Ewa Beach, HI",104,46,55,3.0,6/13/2017,The happy hour is decent the food is well it's applebees. Nothing really bad or good to say. Actually there is a good thing during happy hour which is between 4:00 p.m and 6:00 p.m all the appetizer ladies are half off. I had 3 beers and some nachos for around $20 including tip which isn't very bad at all. If your looking for like great food this isn't the place but if you want to relax in casual environment and watch a game this isn't a bad spot
Jocelyn M.,"Honolulu, HI",3,19,10,3.0,5/25/2017,First time at Applebee's and I look up because my 3 year old daughter says mommy... what dat... I see two people oofing on the big screen TV
Sherrie T.,"Ewa Beach, HI",168,1,1,1.0,7/20/2017,"This Applebee's had extremely slow service, horrible food and unreasonable prices. All in all my family and I did not enjoy the food nor the service."
Chris W.,"Kailua, HI",39,19,,5.0,6/25/2017,"Excellent service from Taylia! The food was delicious & came out quickly! I would totally come here again! Much better experience than I had at the Ewa Beach Applebee's, who could learn from this restaurant."
Janie G.,"Waimanalo, HI",1,4,,1.0,4/16/2017,"Customer service sucks!!! Sat there for 15mins and nobody came to get our order. My sister had to get one of the customer's attention to put in our order. It's been 30 mins and we're still waiting for our food. Utensils are dirty!! Plenty Waiters sitting around but nobody cared to ask how we were doing. Did I mention, we're still waiting for our food"
Teddy C.,"Honolulu, HI",17,21,18,1.0,4/23/2017,Tried out this new Applebees at Ka Makana on a Sunday night 6pm. Wait time was about a hour yet half the tables were empty. Managers slouching over the counters talking story. When it came to ordering food two of us ordered 8 oz sirloin. They were out of Loaded Baked Potato for sides. 5 minutes later water comes to ask one of us that they're out of 8 oz if we're ok with gettin a 6 oz. apparently she thought only one of us got a 6 oz. We also ordered Cesar salad. When the salad came it was House Salad. We had to tell the runner that we ordered Cesar Salad. Then our waiter came back with it saying they ran out of Cesar Salad. Entree's took almost an hour to come out. Not once during this waiting period did the waiter or manager come to apologize for the wait time. Before we left we did ask if the lady slouching on the counters was a manager and we were told that she was a trainer. In between she was also watching the TV's here and there too. Shouldn't a trainer be watching the employees? Don't think we'll be eating Applebees again at least not here in Hawai'i. Plus food wasn't anything special. Chili's over Applebees.
Isaac H.,"Waianae, HI",0,3,8,1.0,5/6/2017,"It first started off a little boggling as we checked in. We were told 15-20 minutes to wait to be seated and I was confused because there were so many tables available.  When we were finally seated Our waiter Caelan was very courteous, respectful, and had customer interactive skills. Although the food services was a failure.  All we ordered was 4 appetizers to eat as our meal. 2 appetizers showed up, but the other 2 we waited nearly 45 minutes.  45 minutes for appetizers! Unrealzzz....  Screw me for eating here I should have sticked to Country Side Cafe in Waianae... Now  Das solid grindzzzzz."
