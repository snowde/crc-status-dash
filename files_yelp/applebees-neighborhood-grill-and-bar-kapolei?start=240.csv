Bonny H.,"Honolulu, HI",55,22,10,5.0,6/18/2017,Love the food here! Everything looks like it does in the picture and the taste doesn't disappoint either. My family and I love coming here and during happy hour their prices are even more reasonable! BBQ brisket tacos are my favorite and the combo appetizer is amazing!
Tammy M.,"Waimea, HI",12,3,,2.0,7/30/2017,Waited too long for food.  Ordered fish and chips.  Fish wad very oily.  Our server was okay.  I will not go back.  Two disappointing experiences.  The oher was the ewa location.
Henry H.,"Waipahu, HI",31,7,15,5.0,7/15/2017,"Excellent service and delicious food. We had the Sirloin Steak with Bacon/beer topper and the Pork Chop with shrimp and Cajun topping. And for desert, the Butter Pecan Blondie!   Mahalo Applebee's!"
John P.,"Waipahu, HI",140,2,,2.0,4/23/2017,"Wait time around 5p was 45 min which we waited, then 20 min more. Host apologized and escorted us to our seating which was occupied by employees that seem did not to get the communication that was our seats. Atmosphere was filled with a bunch of ""sorry's"" for mistake orders or long waits. There were empty tables which gave me the impression they were understaffed. Now the food was great, but the timing of the food coming out made it a horrible first experience. I asked the waitress what is wrong and she just apologized. We ordered a trio sampler but only received two. We inquired about the third appetizer and on multiple accounts they gave us different reasons.  Finally our food arrives all at once except for my friend's salad. Now I am eating my Soup along with my entree, which does not make sense.  Then we asked about the sour cream and butter for a baked potato and the waitress informed us that it was being prepared. Manager comes over and delivers the salad and the rest of us were finishing up eating. The salad was made wrong. Which now we made it to go. At this point we felt neglected by the waitress and trainer because of the amount of mistakes made. The manager then comped the entire meal. I told her I didn't want that and that I get that they just opened and people are being developed but they need to tighten up in their communication and teamwork. Our neigboring table had steak cooking level issues.  I can go on about more mistakes but i think you get my drift on my experience. So a free meal to compensate the horrible experience was a nice gesture but will give a second chance because the food is good. The 3rd entree nevered showed."
Christopher T.,"Ewa Beach, HI",72,1,,1.0,7/28/2017,"Good food and very reasonable prices, but very slow service. We waited 30 minutes and no one even brought us any water; nonetheless, even stopped by our table after we were seated, so we just left to eat next door at moena cafe. I thought I would give them a chance since they're a new store and still training their staff. Staff goes out of their way to make your experience enjoyable at our previous visits though..."
Hannah V.,"Dublin, CA",207,6,1,5.0,4/16/2017,"Came here to the bar for Easter, and it was great! The staff is very friendly, accommodating, and gracious. Honestly, my friend and I who are both visiting from the mainland had a great time talking with them and enjoyed our service! THANKS GUYS!! Shoutout to you Holly, you make a bomb bahama mama!"
Dirt M.,"Honolulu, HI",371,24,1,1.0,4/27/2017,Bad service  Food was cold  Ran out of ranch  This place is very bummers I will not be back  Ever  I give 0 stars
Roro P.,"Kapolei, HI",89,8,,1.0,5/23/2017,I expected wait time to be longer as thought it would on a Sunday but service here is very disrespectful without a greet of hi my name is or a simple smile..... just a menu handed out & a snobby look! As we ordered our food which took nearly an hour as well as our refills on water; any whom having to wait service isn't all that great also there food had came out cold! Both locations are terrible I don't know how this restaurant can be in business with bad reviews especially having to get a discount on our next visit which I won't be coming back I'll just wait for Cheesecake Factory!
Luisa M.,"Kapolei, HI",0,3,8,1.0,10/10/2017,"For a newly opened restaurant you'd expect that the food and service would be on point--negative! We chose to dine here for lunch and even ordered off of the lunch menu. It took ONE HOUR for us to get one burger w/ fries and a soup and small side of pasta! Absolutely ridiculous! The manager knew I was so annoyed that she followed us out the door to apologize for the awful service but when I told her everything that went wrong, she tried to lie in my face and gave me the most stupidest excuse. She blamed the slow service on the chicken tender--this was a lunch portion so it was one chicken tender that was cut up into four pieces! My gripe isn't about the food or portion size, but more about our slow waitress and lack of integrity of the female shift manager/hostess/door opener/pink aloha shirt/liar."
Amber K.,"Wahiawā, HI",153,3,,4.0,5/24/2017,My visit was awesome! Had a late lunch early dinner. Our server Val was amazing! Very attentive and the food was awesome. She made sure my steak was good as I like which you don't get very often. I seriously recommend the chicken wonton tacos! So good! What really made my day was at the end she brought us to go sodas! She gets major brownie points!
Tami C.,"Honolulu, HI",64,14,149,5.0,6/8/2017,"Good service from Caelan last evening for our Dinner @The Kapolei Apple Bee's!!!  Wish their were more nice, patient ppl like this out there!!  This young Kane even suggested to us which combo meal to try, it was the Lime Chicken && both of us, my Hubby & I tried it & we really enjoyed our meals too!  Much Mahalos to you, Caelanfor your great service, we appreciated it. All the best to you in your future endeavors as a R~tech, you will definitely go far in life, with a very good & passionate attitude like yours!  You were raised well, all the best to you Imua"
Cierra A.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,1,,1.0,4/22/2017,"For 2 people, our wait was an hour long. While we were ordering our food I was told that they ran out of a side that I wanted. After 45 minutes we got our food and one meal was cold with stale fries and the other meal was incomplete. The waitress failed to tell me that they had ran out of potatoes so they served me, my plate without it and didn't ask if I wanted anything else instead until after I told her. Our meal was finished in 15 minutes and it took her 5 minutes to give us condiments, which should already have been on the table in my opinion. Lastly, she gave us one hand wipe on a dirty saucer when there's two of us, THE PLATE WASNT EVEN WASHED!! Okay that's all"
Candace Kawehi F.,"Ewa Beach, HI",1,3,,5.0,5/6/2017,"Second time here within a month: with the husband and 2 teenagers. This was the real test from our first visit. Must say service was impeccable from entry to exit and not to mention the food was consistently pleasant on the palette. As long as the family was satisfied in that case, were more than satisfied. Exceeded expectations once again. Theresa was our waitress and she was genuinely pleasant and listened to our needs and offered suggestions. Definitely repeat customers! Mahalo Theresa for your amazing service and genuine hospitality!"
Patty P.,"Wahiawā, HI",19,4,5,1.0,7/30/2017,Omg! Do not eat here! Raw hamburger was served..not worth the money..service was slow..junk food..menus were so filthy! Not returning!
Kitten M.,"Kailua, HI",0,18,3,5.0,6/27/2017,"Good experience eating here for the first time. At first we were forgotten and left at a table for about 25 minutes before the waiter who had the section next to us came and assisted us. We were upset and hungry! She explained that the waiter for our section was not there and apologized for our wait. Other than that long wait in the beginning,  our experience was made great by this waiter who stepped in. She also informed the manager of the situation and  the manager was responsive and friendly. They made sure the rest of our dinner was very pleasant. *i didnt write down their names, i wish i had! That waitress and manager were awesome."
Chel P.,"Durham, NC",0,1,,1.0,11/18/2017,"Honestly I wouldn't even give this Applebee's any stars! My husband and I came in the restaurant just for them to tell us it was a 25 minuet wait when the restaurant was half empty. When we got our table our waitress was pretty nice, then we got our appetizers. After we ordered they told my husband they were out of the food he had ordered so he ordered once again just to be told the same thing, then finally he got something they had, but since I've ordered before him, he got his food abnormally early. He said his food was bland and tasteless. Once our waitress came back I cancelled what I have ordered and wanted to speak with the manager, we've waited for at least 5 minuets just for this guy to walk to the back. He didn't really look professional at all he looked like a normal guy with his shirt buttoned down to his chest. We finally got our bill but this bill was $75 with ridiculous add ones to our bill. If you're looking for restaurants that are cheap for you and your family, you are better off eating at the food court in the shopping area, this place is not worth taking your family nor friends."
Melissa L.,"Waianae, HI",0,1,,1.0,7/18/2017,"Epic fail....salad served on hot plates, entrees served cold, chicken bent my fork! All this while waiting and waiting and waiting at the table for each item... Third time was the worst yet. Maybe next year...maybe."
Jodi L.,"Kapolei, HI",158,23,113,2.0,4/16/2017,"First off, let me say that our waitress was super nice...however, we had to wait a long time for our food, 50 minutes to be exact...and the restaurant wasnt crowded as it was late evening.  Our poor younger daughter fell asleep while waiting and we were all starving.  The taste of the food (when it finally came) was mediocre.  The spinach artichoke pasta thing was more like mac & cheese with spinach.  Our older daughter didnt eat most of it.  My food came cold and the coffee was light brown colored water.  Since this restaurant is fairly new, hopefully they step up their speed of service and taste of their food."
Brandi N.,"Kaneohe, HI",214,1,,5.0,7/22/2017,So I don't really know how to use this yelp app but if you saw my previous comment I actually meant to give Hunter 5 stars cause he's just that good!
Kaylin Y.,"Kapolei, HI",0,18,,2.0,10/9/2017,"Went last week for the Dollarita special, and was really surprised this location was participating, considering most national chains that have specials don't include AK & HI. We learned you're supposed to ask them for the special, they're not supposed to advertise it out to you in the restaurant, so keep that in mind if that's what you're going for. Margaritas were decent. Food was terrible. We had a little bit of everything...from burgers to chicken to chips and dip. The food was garbage. Go for the drink special, don't go for the food."
