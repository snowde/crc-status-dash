Mercedez C.,"Waipahu, HI",32,7,1,5.0,5/17/2017,The cleanliness of the restaurant seemed pretty good! My friends and I were seated promptly. Our server was Brandi who did an amazing job. We wanted to start with drinks but didn't know what. Brandi made suggestions to all our liking! Wait time on food was reasonable. She was frequently checking on our table as well as other in her section (good job!) It was a great first at applebees for me. Thanks for the outstanding service Brandi. 5 stars!!! I'll be back!
Erika S.,"Mililani, HI",0,5,,4.0,9/13/2017,"We've been here a couple of times. The first time I had no issue but the second, the wait for our food was long. We went on a Friday evening. Our waitress was very nice and I love that she brought out our kids food immediately and didn't make them wait for it. We waited a very long time for ours though. When we finally got our plates, the side I had chosen was wrong and the steak I had ordered was not medium rare. The server left before I could ask for A1 and bbq sauce. No one checked on us after he left so we had to flag a hostess to get our waitress to get the condiments. Even though I was a bit annoyed (I was hangry)  our waitress was so sweet the entire time to us. The food was good even though my steak was borderline well done :(  Husband really enjoyed the quesadilla burger and my children enjoyed their burgers. The loaded mashed potatoes and fries were delicious. The manager is amazing and she went above and beyond to fix the problems. FANTASTIC customer service and even though we had been grumpy we left with a smile on our faces! Im giving 4 stars because the manager and waitress, they definitely turned the situation around."
Deirdre A.,"Ewa Beach, HI",25,67,33,4.0,5/11/2017,"Surprisingly not that bad. They have combo specials.  The Bourbon and Berries was good, avoid the LIT. Caprese Chicken is oddly served over mashed potatoes, but tasty. Chicken tenders were small and no riblettes. Fair prices. We'll be back."
Sarah Ann U.,"Aiea, HI",47,5,1,5.0,5/20/2017,They told us the wait was 45 minutes and they would text us. We didn't mind because we could go shopping. After they sat us. The courses were adequately spaced. Kekoa was awesome. He always checked on us. The food was great. We will definitely be back.
D I.,"Honolulu, HI",0,5,,2.0,9/27/2017,"Appetizers and salad came out AFTER the main dish after a long wait and nothing done by server.  Caesar salad lettuce was wilted and limp.  Don't get it.  Appears to be wrong type of lettuce for this salad. Should be romaine, not leafy lettuce.  Chicken signature dish was good.  Service was good until the dishes came out.  Disappointed for the first visit after the hype of finally getting this restaurant in Hawaii."
Brian E.,"Ewa Beach, HI",17,2,,2.0,9/9/2017,"Just found out that my earlier concern was not met. NO NFL FOOTBALL on Sunday! This is very unsatisfactory! All establishments on the West Side were created to give locals an alternative from going into Waikiki or elsewhere and give us a opportunity to see games without making the long drive. Please consider yourselves a ""mainland"" restaurant unfriendly to local community. You are now a 2 star establishment, not sure if I'll come back...why? Brick Oven Pizza I'm back."
Agiga T.,"Ewa, Ewa Beach, HI",36,1,,2.0,9/21/2017,"This is my second time coming here and I was very disappointed with their service.  There were 4 of us and we ordered at the same time, I saw the waitress try to give my food away to another table.  Then our last order took long and so we asked about it and they said it was given to the wrong table so they had to remake it smh.  Besides that our other order was cooked wrong also, it was crispy instead of grilled which is what we wanted.  I guess I'll have to take a break from here for awhile."
Janelle A.,"Waianae, HI",196,11,2,2.0,9/6/2017,"The food was ok but the service and the place is not well organized. I called the day before to make reservations for 10 people. When me and my group came the next day and told them about our reservations they all looked confused like.. what reservations ?? Luckily the place was pretty empty with just 2 couples previously seated. We sat and they took our orders and the food took way to long. Our lunch hour was almost over and we still didn't receive our food. Anyhow, all in all the food was ok. But customer service needs to be worked on. Hopefully this is taken as constructive criticism."
Maroni W.,"Kapolei, HI",0,14,2,5.0,4/27/2017,"Had a great experience tonight here! Good happy hour and our bartender, Kristina was very attentive and nice. Will definitely be back. :)"
Andi M.,"Honolulu, HI",0,18,,2.0,7/23/2017,More like craplebee's... Appetizers were brought out with our entrees and were cold and very bland.. food was mediocre at best.. service was eh. Definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come back here.
Kristley A.,"Honolulu, HI",1,6,,1.0,7/22/2017,"Wanted to have a few drinks after we shopped, so we came here. Got seated right away. Waitress took my drink order as I was still waiting for the rest of my party. Waitress came to check on me after 10 min with waters, but still haven't received my alcoholic beverage. 15 min goes by, then 20 and I still haven't gotten my alcoholic beverage. The drink finally came and the rest of my party came. They ordered an alcoholic beverage too along with a basket of fries. 10 min went by and our fries came out. They were cold, but did not send them back as our waitress was busy so we just stuck with it. Then another 10 min went by and still haven't received their alcoholic beverage. Waitress told us there's only 1 bartender and she's taking care of her tables at the bar and there's nothing the waitress could do to speed up our order. We were going to cancel the 2nd alcoholic beverage ordered, but by the time we got our waitress' attention she was already bringing it to the table. Extremely dissatisfied and upset with this location."
Dominique C.,"Black Jack, Saint Louis, MO",0,2,,5.0,4/16/2017,The waitress Lei was outstanding we had a large group almost 20 and she was fast and extremely polite! We never felt rushed and flow of the service was 2nd to none. Would come back just see her again!
Monica S.,"Fontana, CA",60,2,2,5.0,4/16/2017,This location just opened 5 days ago and we've been here 3 times already. The servers are awesome and knowledgeable. The atmosphere is great. Everything we ordered tasted amazing. Food came out at a reasonable amount of time. We've definitely found our go to default spot!
Hr A.,"Makakilo, HI",0,4,,4.0,9/11/2017,"Tried it out for the first time for an early dinner about 4:00PM.  Got a table pretty quick, they took our order shortly after.  service  was great and priced reasonably.  Definitely will go back again"
Shylah C.,"Kapolei, HI",0,8,1,5.0,5/10/2017,"We had Caelan F. as our server just now! He was awesome! Super quick, very attentative toward us, and got everything we needed in a timely manner. Great job Caelan! Will be requesting for him from now on."
Kalihi J.,"Honolulu, HI",0,11,1,2.0,7/13/2017,Good prices but our steaks were room temp when we got it.... definitely an a1 steak at best... but you get what you pay for...
J J.,"Kapolei, HI",0,2,,4.0,8/24/2017,Jojo was fantastic keep service going made fabulous suggestions. Definitely coming back.
Erica H.,"Honolulu, HI",1,4,,2.0,7/9/2017,"I'll admit it, I'm the guy that mostly only writes a view when service hasn't been ideal. With that being said, we all know new restaurants especially in Kaploei need some work with their staffing. That's the case for the applebees at the mall. The food was good, but they didn't pay much attention to us and we were at the bar. The bartender then proceeds to spray me down with lemonade because the cap on the spot gun came off. Oops? I don't care but she then proceeds to look for the nozzle instead of offer me a napkin. Finally I ask what it was (I assumed it was water since she was not very concerned) and turns out its lemonade. Cool. Sticky. No napkin, still, as she wipes the bar down. We order, 20 min later food comes, then I taste all my food, everything is cold but the meat. I ask if I put my side on another plate if they would heat it up. Any other restaurant I've been too would have said don't worry about it I'll get fresh. Nope, not her. She microwaved it for me. yum. Now too hot to eat microwaved side. Thanks.  Whatever, food was good. If it were me and I sprayed the customer down with lemonade then microwaved their food I would have given a discount. Again, whatever. But we were then late to our movie, because their system shut down. Again, no discount.  No itemized receipt. In good faith I paid my $80 bill. Tip was 15%. I feel like I was being generous, but again, may be me."
Chris A.,"Mililani, HI",0,4,,1.0,9/4/2017,"I have never written a bad review for a restaurant, but I felt that I should warn people against wasting your money here (at least until they get better management).  The staff had terrible attitudes,  the food was slow, the salads came at the same time as the entrees and the steak was burnt (I had asked for medium).  I truly hope they can get themselves straightened out, but until they do I would strongly suggest going somewhere else."
E C.,"Mililani, HI",0,9,,1.0,8/12/2017,"Waited an hour for our food. Burger bun was soggy, steak over cooked and sent back, another steak was cold, salads were drenched with dressing, and the kids meal had the hardest grilled cheese ever. Not coming back and even with the manager knowing what was going on - nothing. No comp, no dessert, no making it better AT ALL."
