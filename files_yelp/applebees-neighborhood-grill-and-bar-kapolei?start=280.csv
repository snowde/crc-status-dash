Nani C.,"Wahiawa, HI",91,13,10,2.0,9/3/2017,"We ordered chips and salsa. Kid size... Really?! My fiancee and I ordered the combo meal. Very disappointed with the Ceasar Salad. Did it come out of a bag? It was definitely not fresh! Some of it was brown and wilted. I ordered the Chicken Caprese. That was good. No complaints. Our friend ordered the Salad with Steak, and her steak was rubbery. To end the meal, my fiancee and I had the Butter Pecan Blondie. That was really good. Our friends had the Triple Chocolate Meltdown and said it was way too sweet. The service was okay. Needs a lot of improvement. Our server doesn't even know the menu. If we knew the sampler came with chips and salsa, we wouldn't have ordered it in the beginning. Lastly, the server took our payment without asking if we needed change. What makes him assume we don't need change?! The least he could've done was comp our friend's meal or discount it. Am I coming back anytime soon? Nah!"
Rosanne A.,"Kapolei, HI",21,4,,1.0,9/2/2017,"I was not happy with the food at all. The quality was nil, the menu uninspiring. Actually the dish in the picture on the menu featured  fresh spinach. When it came it was a mass of fried crispy spinach.  The  flavors were heavy and weird although the pasta was cooked correctly, I removed all the spinach and just boxed up the whole mess. The check was presented just as a paper put in the middle of the damp table. No folder, no pen. When asked the waiter chirped that all employees took them when they  were fired or quit.  Just not worth the time, $ not to mention the blaring constant rock giant sound system."
Malina C.,"Honolulu, HI",0,16,1,5.0,5/5/2017,Came out here for pau hana drinks and appetizers with coworkers. Loved the atmosphere. Caelan was a great server! The margaritas here are delicious.
C S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,10,1,5.0,8/15/2017,"Not sure why but my experience here wasn't like any of the other people's. The mall was relatively dead when I came so maybe that should be taken into account. We were seated immediately and the server was very friendly & polite. The food was also really good, I think the baked potato was my favorite. My friend's and I's came out in about 20 minutes and it was a lot of food so honestly the wait wasnt long. Overall I really enjoyed it and will come again whenever I'm in the area!"
Jeff A.,"Kaneohe, HI",55,5,2,5.0,4/14/2017,"I like the view, excellent foods and fabulous servers. It's near 24hrs gym right across."
T H.,"Nashville, TN",52,15,1,1.0,7/3/2017,"Our waitress was fantastic, but the food was horrible. I ordered a steak and baked potato and it came out uncooked. When the cook attempted to melt the cheese on my potato, he left my steak on the plate. I was served an overcooked steak with a undercooked potato. We ordered beers and had to send them back. They had a weird after taste and too much carbonation. Was really disappointed because we had just ate at Applebee mainland and it was fantastic!"
Kasey H.,"Waianae, HI",16,1,,1.0,5/6/2017,Our experience with Apple Bees has really sucked!!! Our first experience was in Ewa Beach and they had the worst customer service ever. I told myself I would never eat there again. Then we ended up at the new Kapolei mall and was looking for somewhere to eat. As bad as I didn't want to eat there we figure we give them another shot and try again being that it was a different location. Once again it failed. From the time we walked in we had to wait for 15 minutes to be seated which I don't understand why because we were the only one there and there were a few tables open. The only reason why I gave this place 1 star was because our waiter Caelin was very accommodating and always checking up on us being that all we ordered was appetizers and waited over 45 minutes for it. Not a single manager was in sight to try and check up on us to see what was going. What kept me and my husband sane was the fact that Caelin kept coming over to apologize to us and tried to accommodate us in any way possible. Unfortunately I will keep my word this time and will never eat here again because of the unnecessary customer service skills. But once again Caelin you are the bomb and way to good to be working here!!!
Ashley M.,"Kapolei, HI",213,245,8,5.0,7/20/2017,Location is easy to find at the new mall.  Parking is conveniently located right in front of the restaurant.  We went on a Thursday night and didn't have to wait for a table for 5 of us.  I really like how the restaurant is spacious and not cramped with a lot of tables and chairs close together.  Our server was nice and friendly and took care of our requests right away.  My husband ordered a steak and he was really happy with it as he often feels restaurants don't know how to cook it how he likes it.  His plate was completely empty by the end of our meal!  I ordered the chicken breast with mozzarella cheese sticks on top.  It was tasty and the chicken was not dry at all.  They have a variety of options on the menu that are reasonably priced.  I'll be back to try something different next time!  Maybe I'll be able to include an adult beverage as well - they had a ton of different options on that menu too!
Brock Y.,"Fort Knox, KY",163,1,,2.0,5/14/2017,When I come on a weekend during happy hour and a 1/3 of the tables are empty..... yet I'm told there is a 45 min wait.... How is this acceptable!? How do these managers still have a job?
Masen K.,"Honolulu, HI",4,4,,1.0,6/2/2017,"Wanted try the place because I see the commercials but it being a mainland chain, don't get the chance.   Went to the one in Kamakana Ali'i.  Got there around lunch, one hour wait time.  Decided to walk around and come back after the crowd died down.  At about 1:30 pm we go back.  Restaurant is not even half full, with open tables all over, hostess says 45-1 hour wait.   We ask if the bar was available, she tells us that it has to be cleaned first, ok so we wait about 10 minutes......she goes back to her very important cell phone and we wait.  5 minutes later a gentleman walks in and sits down at the bar, so we inform the hostess that someone walked over to the bar and sat.  Her classic response, "" ooh I didn't see that, I'll try and get you a table sooner"".  Didn't even try the food, but if the bimbo working the hostess desk is an indication of there high standards we weren't interested.  We told her never mind we would look elsewhere.  Another classic response, ""oh, okay"" as she buries her head back to her ""well"" hidden phone just beneath the hostess desk.   We went on Memorial Day so longer waits could be expected......poor customer service can never be tolerated."
CC A.,"Honolulu, HI",103,17,1,1.0,8/6/2017,"For an off hour and fairly empty restaurant, srrvice was sad. Hostess rather talk story with coworkers than seat customers.  Lots of servers but not enough to attend to us in a reasona6le time--we sat there while others that came after us got their drinks & order taken. Wr left & went to CPK. Heads up Applebees--there are a lot of good restaurants to choose from so no worries if you are too busy to provide good customer service. For that matter, i would reccommend going to Ewa's location. Dined there twice in the past 3 months and enjoyed good food & great service AND military discount off the entire bill."
Jay O.,"Tacoma, WA",0,27,10,1.0,7/27/2017,"The service here is slow! How is it possible that my appetizers came out before my drink order (lemonade and water). Even my sangria  order came out before my water! After 20 minutes of waiting, the waitress came by to say she forgot my drink order. Food was cold when they brought it out. There were many empty tables so I don't understand the issue. Staff needs to be retained, start with how to properly write an order down."
R F.,"Kapolei, HI",0,3,,1.0,6/1/2017,"Family restaurant ??  Maybe new but must be mismanaged--wait if 20minutes to order while host/hostesses slouching on a slow weekday night @ 8:00pm ?  If waited that long , server's first words should have been ""sorry to keep you waiting"" but maybe the wait time was normal ??  In my book Mgt/host help/server need additional training ..fries were cold, chicken was over cooked & dry .& taco's sauce were too sweet--overall a very bad impression for a chain family restaurant. Do not plan on going back there for a while.."
F. C.,"NORTHRIDGE, CA",1,14,,2.0,8/4/2017,"Terrible service. Unfriendly/unwelcoming staff who are on their phones behind the podium. Food came out at a reasonable time. It was alright. The cheese on my spinach dip was burnt. My waitress had the ""I just wanna go home attitude"". At the end of our meal I asked for a to-go box & it never came. We really only went in to watch the NBA Finals, so thank god that was playing & distracted me from getting angry at the inattentive staff. Otherwise, I guess the happy hour pricing & booze is enough to give it 2 stars."
Pretty In Ink B.,"Wahiawa, HI",7,6,227,1.0,4/16/2017,"My family and I wanted to go to apple bees right after the movies .. entered into apple bees and they said wait was just 15mins ,perfect being it was not busy at all .. we place our order about 420pm and throughout our wait it took 10mins to get our drinks and 1 hour  and 45 mins and still no appetizers many waitresses kept coming back to us ""how you doing you guys ok ?"" Reassured us they checking on our food which never came.. finally we thought ok we been way too patient after restaurant was now busy and everyone around us was eating !!! Bad service and all along the manager said they didn't ever see our order in the system so basically we sat there for nothing!! We walked out very upset , very unorganized .. and our waitress who lied and said our food was coming was never coming .. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE SO UPSET NEVER EVER HAVE WE EXPERIENCED THIS TYPE OF SERVICE!!!! I highly DO NOT recommend this place. !! I wouldn't even rate them 1 star! But you have to choose a star to comment !!!"
Carl B.,"Honolulu, HI",0,6,,1.0,8/15/2017,"Unfortunately another poor night at Applebees. Bar was in a shambles, dirty dishes across 3 spaces at the bar for 15 minutes, bartender clearly had no desire to maintain her bar space, as she was not busy and restaurant was not busy.  We sat at the communal table and were not served at all and left.  Very poor service, poor management, and poor hygiene.  Unfortunately i can not recommend."
Jerald A.,"Kapolei, HI",86,1,,1.0,8/13/2017,"Me and my family have come to the new Applebee's in Kapolei from day one . The food has been pretty consistent for the most part but the management and service in all aspects ( hostess, waiters and waitresses) all need help . I understand that like any new store opening that it takes a bit to get into the groove of things but coming up on more than half the year with no improvement really shows . I may have to say good bye to this location and wait for the pearlridge location to open in hopes of a better dinning experience."
Sarah E.,"Mililani, HI",5,1,1,1.0,4/20/2017,"If I could have given it zero stars I would have. We were seated promptly an it took some time for our sever to come over an take our drink an appetizer order and even monger for us to get our drinks. When it was time for us to place our orders it was made aware to our server that I was severely allergic to spices an anything spicy. And since I was ordering the four cheese macaroni with chicken tenders with spicy dipping sauce,I wanted it without the spicy dipping sauce. When we finally got our food about 40 to 45 minutes later when I went to eat the Mac an cheese I discovered that it was spicy my mom bought it to the servers attention server said well they might have used pepper jack cheese, I was very upset by this especially since the waitress was let known that I was severely allergic to spices. She did take my plate back to the kitchen and about 25 to 30 minutes later my other meal that I ordered of chicken tenders and french fries was bought out. My mom was also unsatisfied with her order because it was heavily coated in a beer gravy and you could tell that the alcohol was not completely cooked out of it also my brothers burger was very dry. When the waitress came up to take the plates and give me a to go box she had asked him about his burger and asked if it was crappy since he had only taken 2 bites from it an didn't want a box for it to which he said yes to. Our waitress was really nice and had no issue with taking the stuff back and seemed to understand that the food wasn't good at all I am upset though with the fact I could have had a serious allergic reaction tonight because the waitress didn't seem to know all the ingredients in the mac an cheese or ask the cook. My mom, brother an I all got sour stomach from the food after we got home about an hour later. I would not recommend going here it's not worth spending ur money"
Shelby M.,"Hickam Field, Honolulu, HI",57,2,,2.0,5/26/2017,"Pretty irritated with my visit here this afternoon. My toddler and I walked in at 12:00. Got sat right away which is one of two good things about my visit. By the time our waitress had gotten over to us, I knew what I wanted to Order for my son and myself. I ordered my son the grilled kids chicken and ordered myself a chicken oriental salad with crispy chicken and no almonds. My sons chicken came out about 10 minutes later which I was okay with the time it took. Needless to say my salad didn't come out for 15 minutes with grilled chicken not crispy.  By that time, my son was done with his food and about ready to go. I asked the waitress to box up my salad and get me a box for my sons remaining meal. 15 minutes later she came out with my salad. So very dissatisfied with this visit."
Ali K.,"Honolulu, HI",0,79,12,2.0,5/8/2017,"Overpriced and slow!!  Our food took well over 30 minutes!  Even my husband, who is one of the most patient people I know was not happy.  One star is for each of the bartenders - they were great.  We sat at the bar since the wait was too long for a table. Don't think we'll be back."
