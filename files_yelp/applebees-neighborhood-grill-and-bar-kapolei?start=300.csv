Jorge C.,"Kapolei, HI",0,4,,1.0,5/8/2017,I  should had look at the reviews before waling in today. Anyways. Service is terrible... food was ok but the most that i got disliked on the place was the service. The waitress looks like she din't want to work or don't give a fuck anymore. Most of the time she was talking to others co workers and not paying attention to the tables. She would radder go hide in the kitchen or just stand around like there is no one there. Do yourself a favor and don't bother coming to this place.
Dd V.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,3,,1.0,5/16/2017,"My sister called the day before mothers day to check what time they open the girl told them 10am which was wrong they didn't open till 11am, then they ordered their food my mom ordered something with shrimp and rice after the girl took everyone's order she came back after a little while and told my mom they DON'T HAVE RICE!!! they only turned it on now so they asked her if she wanted to substitute pasta for the rice she said ok. When they brought the pasta out in a ""small"" black bowl with NOTHING!! on it and it wAS very cold she asked the waitress if she can get a sauce for the pasta she told my mom I have to ask my manager my Dad hated his food he said he expected more he was very dissapointed and my mom said that their was another family there that didn't even get their food. I guess I won't be trying this place anytime soon"
Richard L.,"Honolulu, HI",134,53,36,2.0,4/13/2017,"Nice location and just opened. Atmosphere was nice. Music was too loud. Staff were very friendly and outgoing, at the same time, staff trying too hard to be nice that it felt uncomfortable at some point. Me and my family's first time in a Applebee's ever. Unfortunately for this location, the wait to get our food took a lil over 30 minutes and it was not a busy night. Coffee was watery. My kids ordered steak and it tasted like tendered steak and over-cooked. I order the best signature dish on the menu which was the pork chop and I was not satisfied with this supposedly signature dish. The only thing that I can think of of why they called it a signature dish is because of their apple sauce on the porkchop. But there was nothing spectacular about it taste wise and my green beans tasted watery...seemed like they boiled it in hot water and just throw bits of soggy bacon and bits of garlic...thought it was a half a** job and my loaded potatoes (which cost more according to the waitress) was not even loaded...another half a** job. Simple dish but the quality was half a**.  I think this location needs a better chef. Simple dish and was seemed to be done half a** or rushed when the place was not even packed. Never again. I thought it would be different from Chilis, Outback, and Ruby Tuesday but it's all the same."
Maribeth S.,"Kapolei, HI",0,2,,2.0,5/1/2017,Ok my first impression overall is not that good.... four staff standing around the front desk telling customers wait time is 30mins or more. Tables are empty.... got a seat after 20mins even though I called a reservation days before... we got seated. Our waitress was nice... took our orders. But it took more than 30 mins for our food to come. Saw staffs just standing around kitchen entrance area goofing around like customers are not there. Waitress disappears and hard to find someone to ask for drink refills. Food arrived it was ok...last plate came without   mash potatoes only main dish. Told the waitress. And she disappears... everyone almost done still no mash potatoes arrive. When our waitress came by... she was surprise it was not brought out yet. Staff miscommunication or just not organize or short Staff? But again there are staff just standing around they seem so relaxed and not attending to customers.... so only two stars :(
Scott S.,"Mililani, HI",0,37,1,1.0,8/9/2017,"Friendly service but not too good. We sat at the bar on a Saturday night and we were served by the bartenders for dinner. No utensils given, very few check ins. It seemed they were nice but did not know how to serve. When we asked for utensils we only got a fork! We also needed a knife but we gave up. Funny thing. They missed an entire meal for the couple next to us and they seemed unnerved. Considering the restUrant was fairly slow that night it was strange. Seemed like crew was having fun with themselves instead of helping us. They seemed like children. Food was good............"
Dashia C.,"Makakilo, HI",102,1,,1.0,7/29/2017,"We had a 30 min wait for a table of 5 adults and 3 children. The restaurant was not busy,I'm thinking maybe short staff? But this was my first time eating at the Kapolei area Applebee's. The host was not friendly (meaning smiling or small conversations) if he had asked he would've known it was MY first time at this Applebee's. Waitress took our order for drinks but being it was 9pm when we put our name in,we ordered our drinks  and appetizers and dinner all at once! Our water took 20 mins to reach us so now it 920-9:30. One of my daughters margarita was totally wrong brought out a correct drink after. Dinner was served around 10pm. As we are eating staff is preparing to clean for closing sweeping wiping tables etc we wanted to order more drinks and waitress says bar is closed!! Had we were told last call or in a few Mins the bar will be closing we would've put a round of drinks in! That made us all frustrated due to how the Applebee's night was turning out! We had the table right by the door so when staff members are going out for break or home I see them making hand gestures like the middle finger to each other I'm assuming friendly matter but I have 2 two year olds and a 7... I did not appreciate that. To end this horrible night we were not asked about desserts because they are now CLOSED. So no deserts for the kids!!! I'm taking this comment to the corporates website and office. My Applebee's experience was not at all like the fun friendly and exciting commercial that I've watched on TV."
Amanda A.,"Kapolei, HI",0,2,,2.0,4/29/2017,"Wait time to be seated wasn't bad, 10 minutes since it was just 2 of us. Waitress seemed nice but didn't check up on us really. We ordered and we're waiting about half an hour, the waitress came and told us a few more minutes because they were backed up in the kitchen. Understandable for a weekend. About twenty minutes later our food came and it was cold. Oddly enough there was a family next to us that left because the had gotten their food late and cold as well. The lady that brought our food wasn't our waitress. When the waitress checked up on us 5 minutes after we got our food we let her know it was cold. The manager came to talk to us which was nice and offered us a dessert but they didn't have the one we would have liked to try. Still paid full price for our meals. And our waitress seemed annoyed with us after we talked to the manager. I don't mind not being waited on too much, but she didn't refill water and only approached us maybe twice. The manager was nice enough, but paying full price for cold food after waiting at least 45 minutes is a little crazy. The food was decent, probably would have been good hot, it's just their service wasn't too great. Maybe they'll improve with time since they're so new."
Shayna K.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,9,,4.0,7/21/2017,"The 4 stars is only for our waitress, Kahi. (I believe that was her name) as for the restaurant, I'd give 2.  My boyfriend and I went in on Wednesday around 2ish for lunch. The restaurant wasn't crazy busy but there was a good amount of people. When we were sat, I got alittle annoyed because it wasn't until 15 minutes later that we even got our water. But when Kahi came to our table, she quickly gave us our water and took our order. That's when I realized she was the only waitress there. Besides another woman wearing a blue collard shirt who helped her alittle. Kahi was very nice and when I watched her go to each table she is very on it. Not taking a rest, constantly going back and forth to each table. And she is very pregnant! I felt so bad for her because she was really doing it on her own. The other lady in the blue seemed like she was strolling along doing god knows what. SO, this place is extremely under staffed. Either give that lady more help or at least a raise"
M M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,6,,2.0,4/23/2017,We sat at the bar and watched the bar manager under pour drink after drink.  Some of the wait staff even asked her to top the drinks off-and she continued to under pour the drinks.  The food was ok-but service was lacking due to the amount of time it took to get our food.   I saw my plate sit in the window under the hot light for at least ten minutes!!!
Gina G.,"Kaneohe, HI",47,20,21,5.0,6/18/2017,"Met up with some Zumba fitness friends for my first visit to Applebee's Kapolei for lunch at 11 AM on Kamehameha Day June 12th, 2017. We had a very attentive server, Taylia, who checked on us constantly and was so patient with us as we 4 hadn't seen each other in months! Since I already perused the online menu the day before, I was ready to order once I sat down and did so. 1 other friend also ordered right away. I ordered the new pasta dish Spinach + Artichoke Chicken Cavatappi. Whoa! Whoa! It was the envy of the table! I want to order this one again! Delicious fried spinach, creamy pasta, moist chicken breast, and some chunks of artichokes, oh so yummo (eye roll up into back of head!!) I was pretty much done, though, by the time most of my dining mates' entrees arrived. The one slip up was when Taylia's co-worker made some errors when taking my other 2 friends' orders, when Taylia was unavailable to serve our table. But at bill time, Taylia apologized profusely and handled it so professionally and adjusted the bill to reflect the correct original orders. If I lived in Kapolei, I'd go back. I'd defo get that pasta dish again, but order with the entire table so we could all get our food at the same time! Good job Applebee's :)"
Cynthia M.,"Kapolei, HI",99,2,3,1.0,4/22/2017,It's very rare I leave reviews but I don't want anybody to experience what I did. Terrible experience. Waited over a hour for COLD food. Very unorganized. Never got silverware. Not professional. Would not recommend to anybody. And this one star rating is over rated if I could I would put zero stars.
Taco S.,"Mililani, HI",0,7,,2.0,7/13/2017,"Food was okay, service was lacking and it was not even busy. Waitress did not check on us after the food was served and when the check it was presented with just the receipt and not placed in the tab booklet like everybody else. Waitress name was Heather..heres a tip..""Your customer services needs help"" that is all."
Nathaniel F.,"Kapolei, HI",0,2,1,2.0,4/22/2017,"Pretty bad experience. Service was terrible. She didn't pay attention to us at all.  Empty plates sat in front of us for 10 minutes.  Food is crazy expensive. Cost $60 for two adults for lunch. Food wasn't very good either. Chicken was dry and the shrimp looked and tasted like it came out of a big bag out of the freezer. The pasta had no flavor but a lot of oil. Terrible all around, only thing that saves it from being the worst was that the food did come out really fast and the chicken wonton tacos were ok. Clean Your Bathrooms."
Jeannie L.,"Waipahu, HI",0,19,1,5.0,6/13/2017,No wait time when we got there at 6:30pm. Our waitress was a trainee. Our meal was good. You have to try the chicken wonton taco and the bourbon chicken and shrimp. Service was great!! Our trainee waitress was totally on it! Got our drinks and placed our orders in a timely manner. This was a total difference from our experience from the Ewa location where the service was very slow. I will definitely come here again. Hope we get the same server next time. Maybe the real waiter/ waitress can learn from her. Efficiency with a smile!
Isaac S.,"Mililani, HI",0,16,3,4.0,6/6/2017,"This place deserves more than a 2 1/2 stars, but I might be a little generous with my experience giving 4 stars.  1st off food was good, wait time was minimal and we were happy about that.  We had the crispy won ton tacos for starters and the family loved them.  I recommend trying them if you like tacos and like fried won ton wrappers.  I guess the bad if any was our young waitress.  We have a family of 4 and she felt confident enough to memorize our order.  Me and my wife looked at each other and said I bet she's gonna forget something.  Sure enough she came back and asked what we're our sides.  Glad she came back to ask instead of guessing.  Although she did forget our beers.  My wife wanted to ask but I wanted to see if she would remember.  Applebees served at least 2 less beers than they would have.  Not sure if this waitress does that often or if other waiters and waitresses do it also.  If you're a waitress or waiter that is reading this review, write down the order and read it back.  Jesus, even McDonalds, Jack in he Box, Arby's etc read back the order. The customer will feel confident that they're getting what they ordered and is the least you can do as a waitress.  My other ding was the bathroom, the manager should have the bathroom looked at to wipe, flush, clean, refill, etc not only during closing.  It was disgusting and a mess.  Other than that this place is nice & new.  A lot of parking in the shopping center.  I would try again."
Jeri M.,"Waipahu, HI",0,1,,4.0,6/5/2017,The host staff was meh and the guy who took us to our table didn't even say anything which was a little weird. I think his name was Avery. So we waited about 10 minutes until our waitress came. Her name was Sashanna I believe. SHE WAS GREAT THOUGH. She was funny and really helpful and very attentive. She made our dinner experience waaaaay better. And the food was pretty good. The steak/salmon/ribs were juicy. And yeah. Cool beans. I'd probably come back.
Joanne A.,"Honolulu, HI",125,5,,1.0,7/2/2017,"We check in at 8:00pm and was told the wait is 40-45 mins and they will call us on my phone when the table is ready.  Ok fine, so we just sat outside of the restaurant. 1 hour passed, went in to check on the status. Then the girl in the front says she tried calling us about 10-15 ago but couldn't get through. So, she was going to leave us hanging!!!HELLO!!! Only make sense to go OLD SCHOOL....open the damn front door to call our name.  These milleniums now days, they think the phone is the only source of communication.  By now, it's 9pm...took awhile for someone to come to our table to ask if we wanted drinks. We told him what we wanted, then that too, took awhile to get our drinks.  We ordered our food, took about 45 mins to get our food.  We had to ask why it's taking so long because at 9:40pm there wasn't a lot of people...so what's the delay!!!  By the time we got our food, one of our order was wrong.  They did offer to correct it but I said forget it cuz that might take another 45 mins to get. By now I've lost my appetite, I just wanted to  leave. I could go on and on , on more mis-haps but I would be writing a novel."
Michel Z.,"Waianae, HI",0,2,,5.0,6/10/2017,Great service and great food. Karriem was our waiter exceptional young man. Friendly and attentive. Mahalo
Jesse K.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,2,,5.0,5/7/2017,"Much improvement from the Ewa Beach location! The location of the restaurant is located in a mall so parking is plentiful. The restaurant is very open and has many tables. The food came out at a reasonable time considering the restaurant just opened and my beer was cold too, so that's important! The best past of the experience was my server, Deviana. Deviana greeted me immediately, despite having numerous tables. She didn't rush my order, but also helped by suggesting different options and the specials. She was great! Servers like Deviana make Applebee's successful. Overall, much improvement from the Ewa Beach location. I will be back!"
Trae M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,1,,5.0,5/7/2017,Our server Deviana was GREAT! She had very good knowledge of the food choices and definitely helped with the ordering process. This was our first time at the Kapolei location and we will definitely be coming back and requesting for her to be our server. When she didn't have a personal take on food or drinks she asked for our feedback. Rhe food was delicious and the drinks were good so we'll be back soon :)
