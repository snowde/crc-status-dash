Cindi P.,"Waipahu, HI",0,1,1,1.0,5/31/2017,"Such POOR service!  Wasn't greeted at door, hostesses were too busy trying to figure out their radio issues. Was seated and left there with NO acknowledgement for at least 5 minutes. Walked out without looking back!!  Not returning for sure!!!!"
Mindy W.,"Ewa Beach, HI",6,17,1,5.0,4/18/2017,Very nicely surprised with quick service and kitchen was on it.  Our waitress did disappear for a bit in the beginning but once she took our order she was attentive.  Ran into a bartender (Levon)who used to wait at another favorite restaurant. He brought our drinks right to our table.  Spinach artichoke was better than CPK's. French onion soup is my fave.  Entrees were a little heavy. Needed a bit more balsamic reduction on the chicken caprese and no mash. My chicken spinach artichoke cavatappi could have used a touch bit more salt but liked the crunchy spinach.  Now if only the Ewa Beach one was this quick.
Crystal I.,"Waianae, HI",0,1,,5.0,5/13/2017,This was our first time at Applebee's our waitress was a trainee but you know what she was good she and the trainer always had a smile on their face walked in got seated in less then five minutes the woman came right over took our drink orders cam right back with it ordered our food ran out to move my car closer due to whether by the time I got back my daughter was finish with her food great service plus fastness love it most definitely will be going back
Beverly A.,"Aiea, HI",0,7,,1.0,7/14/2017,"I don't intend to return to this location. I don't think that the kitchen staff or management know how to prepare and serve large parties, if 7 people is considered large. They seem to be able to handle small parties of 2-4 people adequately but any larger, forget about it, especially if you are hungry and have a time limit. Everyone's entry took a while to arrive at the table. I ordered a burger and everyone in my group was practically done with their meal before my burger arrived last. I would say that it took 45 minutes or more before I got my burger. I don't blame the wait staff for this, I blame the kitchen staff. It wasn't even a packed restaurant, less then half full, maybe a quarter full when we arrived. I don't know what their problem is but I was not happy with the wait time on my meal and my companions couldn't understand why my burger was taking so long. My burger was tasty and I enjoyed eating it, of course I was very hungry by the time I got it. I was just very shocked as to how long it took to get it. I have no plans to return there."
Dani M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/9/2017,Do not eat here or waste your time here. Manager and hostess were talking story and took awhile to acknowledge patrons and were unfriendly. We were given a wait time of 30 mins even though the restaurant was very empty put name and phone number on the wait list and were told we would be contacted and were not. After standing outside of restaurant for 40 mins along with many other people patiently waiting two servers came out with the paper wait list and told everyone to leave because the kitchen was backed up and we would have to wait even longer to be seated at a table and that once the orders would be placed that we should expect more than 1 hour wait for food orders to be delivered (which was strange considering how empty the restaurant was). When we questioned why the management or hostess did not notify any of the parties who already waited 30 mins to 1 hour for a table they said that they were servers who didn't know and were very sorry because management tells them nothing.
Hanako T.,"Honolulu, HI",0,4,,5.0,4/20/2017,"Decided to eat here while visiting the new Ka Makana Ali'i. The restaurant is clean and new and our server Brandi was fantastic!  I had the oriental chicken salad and the hubby had a steak that was grilled to perfection. The manager Katy was also very warm and inviting and dropped by our table to check on us and make sure everything was to our liking. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with how good the food and service was and will be back again!"
Clayton S.,"Pearl City, HI",0,3,,5.0,4/13/2017,"The new Applebee's in Kapolei is amazing! Great service, beverages, and food was good. A very enjoyable experience and I will be back.  If you are lucky enough to get Brandi as your server you are set. She is very professional and provides a pleasant experience. The bartenders are great and quick to get drinks out. All around very good time at Applebee's."
Karen T.,"Kapolei, HI",39,5,1,1.0,5/7/2017,"We tried the Applebees in Ewa 2 times but the service was so bad we stopped going.  Then, when this restaurant opened in the new mall....we decided to give it one last try.  Disappointed to say the least.  Had to wait 25 minutes for a table even through there were plenty empty tables in the restaurant.  Once we sat down it took 15 minutes to get water and place our order.  From where we sat I could see the break area for the employees.  They have all of their water bottles and bags there.  I doubt the restaurant designers anticipated that area having a table placed for a break room.  While we were waiting for our food one of the employees brought in Manapua - to the break area (which we could easily see) and this caused chaos since the employees had to stop and taste.  Seriously?  We were watching them party while waiting a long time for our food.  Sorry to say we won't try this restaurant again.  3 strikes and they are out."
Unstatisfied p.,"Waianae, HI",0,5,2,1.0,4/28/2017,"I would save my money and appetite and eat somewhere else!  Sat us after a group that came in after us.  Waited 20 minutes before a server even came to take our drink order, by than we knew what we wanted to order and ordered everything one time thinking our food should come out fast.  Our drinks came out fast.  My daughter had one kids cheese burger and mozzarella sticks and that took forever.  We waited about 45min for our food to come out and when mine came out it was wrong.  By the way I only had the appetizer 3 choice.  Waited about 10 mins and my corrected quesadillas still never came out.  By that time I had already ate whatever else we had on the table, which wasn't much and got full.  Couldn't find out server so I stopped the next server that walked by and told them to cancel the quesadilla.  Our server never refilled our drinks, let me say NO SERVER even stopped and asked if we needed a refill and the cups we're at the end of the table EMPTY!  We had to stop someone and ask for refills.  Looking for our server for our check so we can leave this lame, slow place and he's no where to be found.  Finally he comes out and spends about 5mins at another table with fellow co-workers who are dining there also.  Takes another 5min to being our check to us.  This should actually be a NO STAR review!  They need to get it together.  NEVER coming here again.  The food ain't all that anyway."
Mike B.,"Honolulu, HI",0,14,,2.0,5/13/2017,"Well I hate to give a bad review to a restaurant but the applebees here in kapolei was a big disappointment, being my first time eating at a applebees I wasn't too impressed. We waited over an hour for our food to come, our appetizer which we picked two choices came out 20 mins a piece we ordered the mozzarella sticks which was ok and the chicken one ton tacos which was great but you only get 3 tacos, our waitress was very nice and told us sorry about the wait and that the kitchen was backed up because it's a Friday night. The restaurant wasn't too busy being that they close at 10 and we got seated at 9:15, but everybody around us didn't have food, I felt sorry for the family of 3 boys next to us that ended up taking their food to go because it was getting too long of a wait, we ended up getting our food before them and we had the same exact party of people, the food was ok but not worth the wait and price. My advice is save your money for cheesecake factory which will be opening soon, the portions at applebees are crazy small and not worth a $65.00 check money wasted we won't be coming back again."
Christina G.,"North Shore, Wahiawa, HI",279,2,,2.0,5/8/2017,"My husband and I both lost our appetite because both the male and female restrooms had built up dirt and film on the back of the toilet seats in the female stales and on top of the male urinals which I don't understand because the restaurant is fairly new ...clearly the staff has not been cleaning these particular areas at all because there is no way that much build up came from one day and the managers on site aren't checking the areas either...but what I don't understand is from what I could see this was the only restroom in the restaurant...so either they just don't have a standard or they simply don't care that the toilets look like this when they use them either way it goes as a customer eating in your restaurant that makes me not want to dine in at your establishments out of fear of what else do you have different standards on...before we left we made the manager aware of the situation, so hopefully it gets fixed. But as far as me and my husband are concerned we will not be returning to this particular restaurant because we don't want to risk the chance of getting sick because of poor cleanliness and over all poor standards that are allowed to be in place that every employee has a part in...sad to because we we're super excited to have an Applebee's near us"
Alyssa D.,"Pearl City, HI",0,1,,1.0,7/23/2017,"It was the first time my boyfriend and I have ever eaten at Applebee's and we figured we'd try it out. Our server was also one of the only bartenders so she focused a lot more on the patrons at the bar than us at a regular table. I understand that she had a lot of people to take care of, but it's almost as if we were the only table left dissatisfied. We ordered and got our drinks relatively fast but it was over 30 minutes before we got our appetizer. We got our entrees ANOTHER 30 minutes later. My string beans were half over cooked and half icy cold and we could tell our steaks must've been sitting for a while because they were barely warm. Our server was somewhat apologetic about the wait but none of the other workers checked up on our table even after 45 minutes of waiting. Other patrons who were seated after us received their food before us and I feel like that's a problem. It's unfortunate for our first dining in experience to be a poor one."
D K.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,,1.0,6/12/2017,"No acknowledgement when you walk through the door.  A hello would have been nice. They just stand there and look at you.  He grabs some menus and tell us to follow him.  No friendly greeting entering or leaving.  What the heck.  At least at McDonald's they greet you when you come to the restaurant.  Then we order our food which was terrible.  I ordered ribs and the ribs were dry and tough.  My husband ordered some kind of chicken with quinoa which he ate but he didn't like it either.  Half way through my meal i find a hair in my plate.   It was cooked into the barbecue sauce.  So gross out.  I wanted to throw up after I saw that.  My husband calls the manager and she ask's us if we want a new order.  Hell No!  So she tells us  she will take the dish off the menu and give us a free dish for the next time we come.  She gives a card with her name on it and in hand writing ""1 free entree on the next visit""  and her signature.  Like really we want to come back.  Then we get the bill and they don't even take off my meal.  They take off my husbands meal off that was $5 cheaper than mines.  WHAT EVERS!  That was our FIRST and LAST time we will be dining there.  The workers over there don't even look local.  No personality and no customer service!!!"
