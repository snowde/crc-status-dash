Tammie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",75,13,4,5.0,1/5/2018,"I stopped by for lunch and was immediately seated. My server, Chelsea M, did an excellent job! She was attentive and very sweet. The next time I come to dine, I hope I'll be seated in Chelsea's section."
Fellowes D.,"Kahului, HI",3,6,7,3.0,12/1/2017,"My first time at an Applebee's. Let me start off by saying that the place appears to be dirty. Papers on the floor, restroom basins dirty. An old rule of thumb is if the front of the house is dirty the back of the house (kitchen) is much more dirty. The place is NOT busy with quite a few employees in the back. I don't see why they don't have somebody out front cleaning. Probably a management thing. I reviewed the menu it appears to be a lot like a Chili's or an Outback. I don't think I would come here for dinner. I just came in for an appetizer and a beer. The spinach dip is really good! The beer was cold."
Sharelle O.,"Honolulu, HI",2,41,68,1.0,7/12/2017,I barely ever wrote horrible reviews but this I have too !  First timers ! We walked in and they sat us immediately the atmosphere was great nice and clean !  The hosted was nice sat us with my stroller As we sat down the waitress came to take our drink order we ordered a mango margarita and a strawberry margarita and they were both HORRIBLE !!  Never again my mango came out white like it was just a plain tequila margarita and my sisters was a strawberry which just tasted like syrup !!! NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER AGAIN WILL WE COME HERE !  After getting our margaritas she didn't come back for another 20 minutes ANOTHER Waitress had to ask if we had ordered !!!! We ordered taco brisket and it tasted really bad ! We will never eat here again !!! The chicken tenders were dry !!!  The Mac and cheese was straight from the box ! The only alright food was the bacon burger which was eaten all !    Their service sucks DEVINNA IS A HORRIBLE SERVER ! never AGAIN will we ever eat here she didn't even check if we needed refills on any water nothing didn't come to give us napkins we had to keep getting up and asking for things the service was so bad !  When asking for the check ! That took another 15 minutes will not eat here again ! Don't waste your money on this place !  The manager on duty was great though :)
Heidi A.,"Waianae, HI",267,42,46,4.0,8/28/2017,"Okay so let me explain this contradictory review.  I completely understand why there's such low rating system, the service is terrible. On a Sunday night we came into the kapolei restaurant and hostess told us there would be a 20 min wait.... When I could literally count 15+ open seats, it was completely baffling. And when we asked to sit on the high chairs by the bar she came up with an odd excuse that the servers sometimes use those tables to serve food (????), what the actual f***??? The hostess is terrible (probably new) and I can't speak to the servers bc instead we went straight to the bar. Here is why I'm giving a 4 star review (can't be 5 because you can't avoid the hostess).  Our bartender, Chelsea, was fantastic!! She was very attentive, friendly, and gave us some good advice about the food. She was great, I mean even she was baffled at the hostess.  The food was pretty good! The sirloin I ordered was nice and juicy! The spinach pasta thing we also ordered had the most amazing chicken complimenting the creamy pasta. THE DESSERT WAS DIVINE!! Plz do order the dessert similar to a chocolate lava cake (but that's not actually what it is called).  Everything is well priced and the food is pretty good, just your standard Applebee's level. Aside from the service it's worth a try to give this place a taste."
Wendy B.,"Honolulu, HI",156,11,16,2.0,8/17/2017,"We came here to celebrate a birthday during a week night and it wasn't to crowded, which is always a plus.  There were 4 in our party and pupu's were good, we had the mozzarella sticks, and the spinach and artichoke dip as part of the 2 for $30.00 menu.  They were both pretty good, but the dip is best when eaten hot.  I ordered the french onion soup, which I love to eat, and it wasn't the best i'd ever had, and the bowl wasn't even all the full, but it was ok.  I think it needed a little more time to cook as the cheese was kind of one big lump and not so much the nice owey gooey you would normally get.  Oh well... The meal itself wasn't bad for the price, however i was a little disappointed in the caprese mozzarella burger.  On the menu it sounded so good, ""Sautéed garlic and onions seared into an all-beef patty and topped with balsamic aioli, grilled tomatoes, grilled red onions, fresh mozzarella, and fresh basil.""  Sadly that was not what i got, there were a shit load of red onions on there, and they were not seared, or if they were it had to be seared for like 5 seconds, because they were RAW!  I tasted no balsamic aioli, and the ""fresh basil"" was a sad little single tiny basil leaf....like what the hell...I ended up taking off ALL the onions and basically just ate the rest of the burger which i dipped into ranch dressing.  I was really disappointed, to say the least... The only thing that actually made this worth it was the dessert, which of course isn't hard to mess up. I hope the next time we come here, their burger game is better..."
Jannah C.,"Honolulu, HI",58,72,206,4.0,8/5/2017,"We just wanted pupus and we were at Kapolei Mall so we came here. Food was okay. Price was reasonable, they even had the half off for appetizers all day. Service was great. The wait for the food was a little bit long for appetizers hence I deducted one star. TRY THE CHICKEN WONTON TACOS! It's so good."
Almanard D.,"Kailua, HI",51,21,103,1.0,11/9/2017,Setting at the bar top table. No other way to say horrible service  the bartender never clean took away any plates the whole bar was a total disaster tables who had left 20 30 40 minutes prior food was still on the bar. You don't get tips just because you say hi. Lack of training I blame the management
Shelby K.,"Honolulu, HI",181,49,72,3.0,8/18/2017,I came on a Saturday afternoon and the wait was 45 mins for the three of us even though there was plenty booths still open. Maybe they didn't have enough staff working? Either way they should plan accordingly since it's Saturday.  I've never ate here before my Applebee's experience is only watching their commercials on tv. I was excited to actually try their food! I was set on getting pasta. We got the 2 for $30 which is great cause 2 pastas were $16 each. When you get the 2 for $30 you get one appetizer and two entrees. So in the end you make out a free appetizer!  The food took forever to come out. I'm not sure if our waitress really cared but she never fill our water and our food was cold by the time we received it.  I would try here again but I would really hope for a different service experience.
Sophia A.,"Ewa Beach, HI",57,3,,5.0,1/4/2018,"I went to eat here on Tuesday with my boyfriend for our anniversary. We had the server named Jessica. She was super funny and happy and honestly I came here before and came back kinda scared but Jessica made me feel better for my decision to come back. My boyfriend ordered the all you can eat chicken tenders and they were really yummy actually. The ranch was really good. Our drinks were never empty like the last time I came, and I never had to ask for condiments. I saw it was busy and they looked short staffed but they made it work and I'm really impressed how much better this place is getting. Thank you Jessica for making our evening special! Definitely will come back again only if she's working!"
Elsa N.,"Ewa Beach, HI",29,81,125,2.0,8/27/2017,The food was awesome had the chicken & shrimp Entree and my daughter had the hamburger with fries.  The reason I only gave 2 Stars was the fact that the manager refused to give me TWO STAMPS on my card! She claims that you get only ONE stamp per visit HOWEVER the card clearly states per ENTREE and not PER VISIT! Just a note to the Kapolei Applebees Manager!!!  The customer is always RIGHT. Well I guess this means Ewa Beach will be my first choice for Applebees.  No longer going to Ka Makana Alii Applebee's.
Melissa B.,"Kaimuki, Honolulu, HI",22,4,1,2.0,12/18/2017,"Came here for the first time and was disappointed.  I have been to many on the mainland.  First off they don't have the riblet basket, the waitress who was very helpful and chipper, told us they will be getting it next month.  We ordered the full rack of ribs with steamed broccoli and sweet potatoes. The broccoli and sweet potatoes were excellent the ribs were so tough and chewy, we couldn't even finish them.  We were very disappointed. We had to fight the ribs to get the meat off the bones. We told the waitress and she said she had had that complaint before from people.   The waitress was honestly the best experience of the whole thing, her name was Rabecca, and she was very eager to help and was on her game. Rebecca gets two thumbs up, Applebee's get one thumb for the good sides. Won't come back here, chili's has better ribs than this."
Steph C.,"Honolulu, HI",381,21,53,2.0,7/27/2017,"PRO:  onion rings CON: wait time for service is too long TIP:  the 2 for $25 lunch deal    I don't like to give them only two stars.  Everyone in the establishment was really very nice.  The place is understaffed.  There is a sign on the window looking for employees.  The manager was seating people, making drinks, and taking food orders.  I only saw one person bus tables.  We had to ask twice for our check. We ordered a lunch special - two entrees for $25.  It comes with an appetizer.  Entrees:  chicken and pasta (the pasta was fun and swirly) and chicken caprese.  Both were standard, nothing to write home about.  I would have liked a little extra salt or pepper but there were no condiments out on the tables.   Our onion rings were great.  They were crunchy and easy to eat.  The side of barbecue sauce was good but I wanted ketchup.  Again, no condiments on the table.   Here's an odd thing...the prices of beverages was not listed in the menu - at least I couldn't find it.  A lemonade was $2.70 (asked the server) so we just had water with slices of lemon. This was my first experience with an Applebee's.  I had hoped for more because of the all the commercials I see on TV.  The interior was cute - kinda trendy with open wood and lights that spell words.  My husband says that isn't what most Applebee's look like.   Some miscellaneous things:  The bathroom was clean.  That's always a plus.  I saw some children with a kids activity book.  They had a few long tables put together for parties of 8. It feels like a brief review but I don't want to focus on how long everything took.  So...order a beer and onion rings and don't have to be anywhere."
Karen S.,"Honolulu, HI",27,54,58,2.0,6/17/2017,"Skip this place. I usually take pictures of our meals but honestly I didn't think it was ""picture worthy"". The appetizer we ordered was the spinach and artichoke dip and it was good but very small in portion.. my husband ordered some Mac n cheese thing with chicken strips and he said it wasn't all that. His chicken strips were pretty small and the mac n cheese wasn't great. I ordered a wonton shrimp stir fry and it wasn't bad but wasn't GREAT either. Then we ordered dessert which was a butter pecan blonde and that made up for the terrible dinner we just had. The dessert was actually really good!  So overall, we'll probably not be going back. Portions were small and the food wasn't great (except for the blonde)."
Frank D.,"Kapolei, HI",35,19,4,1.0,5/30/2017,"Yes its new, staff must be also, however coffee served had to ask for sweetener. Food comes had to walk over to ask for condiments.  What kind of training do these servers get. Also while walking to table had to wait mid way, well after a few steps as the hostess discussed something seemingly unrelated to seating myself first. customer service above all needs.  Well, new kid on the block, however being a national chain i would expect better customer service. If you want repeat customers might want to look at or review training. Not my servers fault, she was polite and busy running around.  Ok got my food. Note to food designer, not good to place everything on mash potatoes, it looks great. Try cutting onions tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and grilled chicken without mashing the mashed potatoes and making the dish look like, well mush. Just got the check. A cash register receipt. Okay i take it to the front. Im told i have to give my payment to the server. So i had to ask if the server was new, answer ""not really"", I'm astonished as to what happened next................nothing. Holding on to the bill I had to ask, ""well do you have one of those holders for the bill where i can place my card?""...""oh okay"", she walks to get one.  First of all ""not really"" is not a response. Try ""is there something i can help you with"". Again customer service training. This was just lunch btw. The workers look pretty young, i would suspect summer job. More so training is in order here."
Lesley H.,"Waipahu, HI",1,2,,1.0,10/22/2017,"I went to Applebee's for lunch with my family.  I was greeted by their rude, unfriendly hostess Brandi. She did not greet me and did not try to accommodate me at all. I guess she doesn't care to bring in business. A hostess is suppose to be the first impression of the restaurant. If anyone goes to this restaurant, be prepared to get attitude from Brandi."
LaGina L.,"Henderson, NV",0,7,3,5.0,12/21/2017,"We love Applebee's. It's always been a go to restaurant for us throughout our marriage from Las Vegas and now our move to Ewa Beach, Hawaii. Tonight Patricia was our waitress. She was very personal and helpful throughout always checking on us throughout. We started out with our free chips and salsa from our Yelp app and Wonton tacos. We also both ordered iced teas. Our drinks came first then our chips and salsa, and tacos. My husband ordered the Steak salad and I ordered the Salmon with broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes. They delivered it with French fries and corrected it immediately. The salmon was absolutely delicious! It was underneath lightly buttered spinach, broccoli, a touch of a sweet mustard sauce on the side and my garlic mashed potatoes. I would highly recommend it. My husband is a hearty eater and fully enjoyed his steak salad. In closing, I did have the brownie bite dessert. Perfect for some chocolate satisfaction. Can be shared or by itself. A must try if you need your chocolate fix!"
Nora N.,"Ewa Beach, HI",3,27,12,3.0,10/18/2017,"Two times now I've went to Applebee's at this location and was told the wait time would be about 10-15 minutes later. Okay I understand that, but what I don't understand is me agreeing to the wait time and giving them my cellphone number to out in their system to text me when my seat was open....and never texting me back  Both times they lost my business."
Brittney E.,"Kapolei, HI",197,62,165,5.0,6/4/2017,"I was actually debating to try to this place since what I've heard about previous customers, but it turns out this place is great! Very nice, clean, and big area. Our waitress was so nice and sweet. I can't remember her name ( I think it started with a T) but she really impressed my dad and I with her service. She recommended us to get the rib eye with shrimp and you get to choose to sides to go along with your meal (I chose fries and broccoli). The wait for the food wasn't long at all. From the first bite I knew I was going to really enjoy the meal.  They have a lot of drink choices as well. I got the summer squeeze and it's a nice refreshing drink. It has a nice citrus taste to it. I can't wait to try the other cocktails because there was so much too choose from.  I also wish I had room for dessert but we were too full, but I'll be back again. If you're looking for a place with good food and good service come check this place out!"
Alicia D.,"Honolulu, HI",61,40,22,5.0,12/16/2017,"Great experience at Applebee's.  Daniel the GM was awesome as well as attentive  he made sure that I was well taken care of. My waiter was extremely nice.  The food was very good,  I had the brisket tacos,  I will be back.  Thanks Daniel for the wonderful experience"
Robyn F.,"Honolulu, HI",4,44,113,1.0,10/11/2017,"I ordered a medium burger to go and they gave me a well done burger on a bun (no toppings or condiments) and cold fries. I stood awkwardly at the bar and waited to be acknowledged. When I was finally addressed the bartender made me feel like I was annoying her and she was walking away as I was talking. When I asked about the lack of condiments she stated that the burger came undressed (just meat and bread) and I told her that according to the app, it's supposed to come with everything. When they brought out my fresh fries another employee stuck her hand in my bag and pulled out the old ones. Unprofessional and unsanitary. The quality of service is poor at this location. In the 3 times I've come there I've only had one good experience and it was because I came during the middle of the weekday. As our ""local neighborhood bar"" I hope they get it together."
