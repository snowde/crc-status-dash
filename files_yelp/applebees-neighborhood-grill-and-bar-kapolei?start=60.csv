Amber W.,"Kapolei, HI",20,3,1,5.0,1/6/2018,Great food fast and convenient. Jared did an awesome job will come back every time. The managers were very friendly and checked on us to make sure everything was good. The host was friendly and polite. We are very pleased with the service we were provided. Will be coming back!!!
Corinne E.,"Kailua, HI",73,68,160,2.0,5/20/2017,"Forgot to write a review after we went! The wait time was 25 minutes... didn't feel the wait was really worth it. They were nice enough to call us when the table was ready though.  We waited even longer for the food and the waitress made a comment about how the other servers weren't picking up their food first so it gave me a sense that the food was ready but the other dishes had to get moved out of the way so ours could move up. Waitress spilled a full cup of water on our table and while she apologized we still needed to remind her that the cup needed to be replaced.  The atmosphere was on the noisier side with TV's positioned all over. Neat Applebee's signage. Roomy booths. Fries didn't jazz me. My dish was pretty tasty but the portion seemed rather small. Kids have a regular meal or I believe it was a super hungry meal with bigger portions.  Was not impressed really, it was okay."
Gwen R.,"Ewa Beach, HI",25,23,13,1.0,4/30/2017,"My husband, son and I decided to try the new Apple Bees at Ka Makana Ali'i. Upon entering usually the hostess would ask us if we would prefer a booth, table or seated at the bar area but we were never asked and she tried seating us at the bar with the table and chairs being a little high we asked to be seated at a table instead. Husband just had knee surgery and trying to seat on a high chair would be difficult for him. But guess she thought with him limping that the table she chose would be for us. Uh no.  Anyways, our waitress came took our orders and disappeared.  We seen her walking around but never came back to check on us instead other waitresses stopped by to check on us which for us would've been nice to have our waitress do that to get her tip but guess she didn't  need it. The appetizers were all mixed up amongst tables and they just looked all lost. We finally got our appetizer which was the mozzarella sticks my son's favorite but when we got it, it was not hot just a little warm. Felt sorry for my son because he only ate 2 which is very rare for him. Guess he didn't like it either. We waited for 30 minutes or more for our food and by the time we received it we were disappointed. My husband and son both got the 1/2 rack ribs and according to my husband nothing really to brag about it was just bland. I ordered the Parmesan Shrimp and sirloin with French fries and green beans with bacon but everything was just soaked in butter and grease. Didn't get to eat my fries since it was soaked in oil and grease and didn't want to keep eating as I didn't want to get a tummy ache. There was a couple and their little girl who were seated in front of us and was there before us. As we waited for the check the waitress went to ask this couple if they wanted the check and they said they were still waiting on their food. Ridiculous the waitress had to tell them not once but twice she was going to see what happened to their order. We felt so sorry for them especially with their little girl who looked about 2 years old getting tired and probably hungry. We were hoping that this Apple Bees would be good but we were highly disappointed. We will not be eating here again. Save your money and just order through McDonald at least you won't be disappointed and get better service."
Anthony W.,"Ewa Beach, HI",10,28,27,3.0,10/6/2017,"Had to wait 20 mins for a seat - (did not know this was a place of interest). We were seated next to the bar area so, I was not really excited about that.  Especially as I seen other seats open.  No matter, I was going to enjoy my dinner after a crazy work week.. Waiter finnaly came to our table we ordered drinks and food because I didn't want to wait any longer than I had to.   Lucky for the waiter the food was actually really good.  Everything was hot, tasty and the waiter made more frequent trios to our table.  What started out as a questionable dinning experience, turn out to be a decent meal. Applebees, tighten up that wait time and you may get 5 stars."
Yurika H.,"Downtown, Honolulu, HI",0,4,,5.0,12/13/2017,"Appetizers were good, Cheyenne was the best! I think they have really good pasta, though they ran out of the pasta that I wanted it was ok because they still have 4 cheese macaroni. The brownie ice cream dessert was amazing. Service was slow but the food was bretty good."
Val O.,"Waimalu, HI",26,5,,5.0,12/15/2017,Cheyenne has been an awesome server!!!... and our food was sooooo much better this time!!!!
Kawehi D.,"Waipahu, HI",68,8,4,1.0,12/18/2017,"Such slow and bad service, and there was only 2 other tables than ours. Ordered the traditional wings, kids mini cheeseburgers and the chili house grille.... server says they don't have the turkey and ham that goes in the sandwich, also she mentioned that the bacon they need to cook some because they ran out, guessing the pre cook everything ?! No wonder why the quality of the food is horrible. So she suggested chicken breast instead of the hm and Turkey. When it came out they didn't have any bacon in the sandwich, boneless wings came out when I ordered bone in. Also the kids burgers were so horrible and bland. Also fries were re-fried ! Had to wait at least 5 mins after having an empty cup to get a refill. No customer service at all. Would never come back here"
Dino B.,"Waipahu, HI",522,3,1,5.0,12/7/2017,"2nd time here,1st time a few months ago was a mess,slow service,long wait. It seems to be alot better now    Our waitres Sylvia was on point"
Jeff S.,"Waianae, HI",2,15,,3.0,10/16/2017,"If you are looking for a decent meal than this is a place to consider.  When we entered the restaurant we were greeted by the hostess.  She then started to look at the seating, and used her ""in the ear"" communicator...then did a 180 and started to walk away....never a please follow me......felt like we were stalking her.  She suggested a table but the woman sitting at the next table was ""hefty"", and her chair was up against one of our chairs, with the tables not moveable we opted for another table.  Back near the door of the kitchen!  The sun was starting to set, and the bright sun shone through the front door blinding us for much of the time.  Kids were screaming relentless on the other side of the restaurant. My other half had a beer, which was presented to him in a bottle.  I had a beer on tap, and it was served in a large tall glass.  We had to ask for a glass for the bottled beer. Now the food.  I had the chicken with cranberry rice/quinoa.  It was a lovely low calorie choice, had good flavor, but would not be enough food for the average man.  My other half had the salmon.  He was presented with a huge piece of salmon, an enormous mound of broccoli, and what appeared to be a ""steamed baked potato"".  The skin was wet, and not crusty so it appears the baked potato had never seen the inside of an oven.  There is a $2.99 upcharge for sour cream etc. (a bit of an abusive upcharge for something so common).   Overall, we would return to eat here again.  We did NOT eat off of the 2 for $25/$30$35 menu, and it bill with a tip came to about $55.  For that amount of money there are many other choices that are equal or better than this Applebees."
Robie L.,"Honolulu, HI",46,2,17,4.0,7/16/2017,Nice quality food...generous portions...large menu... Will give Outback a run for the money... Better than expected!
J O.,"Aiea, HI",4,3,7,2.0,11/15/2017,Our waitress up and left. Waited an hour for our food. My food came cold. Not coming here again. The only reason they got 2 stars was because the waiter who took out waitress' place and the general manager were very apologetic and compensating.

Chanel M.,"Mililani, HI",70,70,27,4.0,9/20/2017,First time here! The food was super good. This location is in the back of kamakana ali'i ( I'm not sure if i spelt it right lol ) but its where 24 hour fitness is. There is a lot of parking to choose from. The workers are nice. The only down fall was that my friends food took a really long time. The four of us was almost done eating and he still didn't get his food yet. And then for the check they also took a while to give it to us. They wasnt like super busy either so idk what was going on. But other then that its a good place to eat.
Liezel A.,"Kaneohe, HI",347,46,367,3.0,5/23/2017,We decided to check out this place after our movie.  The wait was about 15-20 minutes not bad for location at the mall.  The food was alright.  WHY alright? The Server gave us someone else food first and we told them and we didn't order this.  We waited for appetizer for quite a time.  Lucky there's tv around us but we kept ourselves busy with our phones.  They had a specials for lunch.  My other half order ribs and I order chicken fingers.  Our main dishes took awhile to come out.  The ribs taste like it was cook and the meat didn't fall out of the bone.  So my boyfriend asked if we could talk to the manager on duty.  The manager took off the ribs and we decided just share my chicken fingers.   I glad she didn't charged us for the ribs because we were like this is American food place and they suck in making ribs.  I'm glad that the manager apologize and comp half our bill and offer deserts but we were in rushed.  Hopefully next time I tried this place I can give a better review and more stars.  I like the applebees in the mainland.  Services 2.5 Food 2.5 because the ribs didn't taste like ribs.  Atmosphere 3 (like place to go when football is back on. )
Phoebe F.,"Waipahu, HI",63,82,309,3.0,6/24/2017,"We were very excited to try the new Applebee's. There's lots of parking since it's at the new kapolei mall and the area itself it very nice and the inside clean, also great music playlist all night lol. We came here for Father's Day dinner around7pm. Being a big party of 12 I expected there to be a wait and take some time for our food to come out. After about 30 min we got seated. The menu looked great and prices were reasonable. Unfortunately they must've been short staffed in the kitchen since it took our food 30 min to come out. We even had many entrees come out before my soup and appetizer. Overall the food was good but service wait time lacked which is why so little stars. We would like to come back, hopefully another experience would be a little bit better."
Gabrielle C.,"Pearl City, HI",197,103,642,5.0,4/25/2017,"Tried out Applebee's for the first time here in Hawaii! After seeing the horrible reviews at the other location in Ewa Beach near foodland, we were skeptical to come but heard the one here at Ka Makana Ali'i was better. Parking is definitely better as well as there is parking throughout ans around the mall.  Glad we did come here! We came right when they opened around 11am and there was no wait and was seated right away. We were also greeted upon entering which is a plus.  Our server was Sashanna.... and she was WONDERFUL! She gave us suggestions when we asked and gave in a lot of inputs of what she liked and didnt liked which helped us choose as we found to like the same things. From the start she told us about their combo deals where you get a choice of 2 entree plates and 2 side salads or 1 appetizer to share. The prices range for these combos from $25- $35 depending on the entrees you share. There are also half priced appetizers everyday as well from 3p-6p and 9pm-close. For our food we chose to eat the Chicken Wonton tacos and ordered the combo of Onion rings for the appetizers and 4 cheese max and cheese with honey pepper chicken tenders and the Spinach artichoke cavatappi. The appetizers were sooo good. Onion rings fresh ans crisped and the Chicken Wonton Tacos were delicious! Somethjng i have never tasted before and is a must try! It has sauced, glazed chopped chicken on the bottom with a coleslaw type veggies on the top. As for our pastas we weren't AS impressed. My 4 cheese mac and cheese seemed like they didnt have cheese in the pasta at all. The sauce from the chicken overrided the whole plate. I didnt finish it there but when i took it home had to pack on the cheese to finish it. My boyfriend's spinach artichoke pasta was pretty good tho. If you love spinach you'll be happy cause they threw a whole crap load of spinach on top of the pasta which we just pushed aside as it seemed just for the looks haha. The pasta alone tho did contained a well mix of spinach and artichoke. Wished there was more cheese or a thicker sauce to it for a fuller bite.  Last but not least for dessert we got the Triple Chocolate Melted Cake. For $9.00 it was okay... the chocolate fudge cake was delicious tho! But for $9.00 wished the portion was bigger. Would buy again tho for the taste of we really want the dessert. Thanks for the wonderful customer service SASHANNA!!! You're the reason why this location is getting 5 stars. I would have given it 4 based on the food."
Nancy V.,"Kapolei, HI",0,19,5,5.0,12/12/2017,"Just had lunch in the bar. Catherine the bartender was great. Quick service with a great attitude. Caesar salad was mediocre, but French onion soup and chicken tacos were awesome.  I've been here before and it was really disappointing, but they definitely redeemed themselves this time."
Tracy A.,"Waipahu, HI",3,25,21,3.0,4/14/2017,"Overall I'm giving this location 3 stars not because it just opened earlier this week but because the food that my bf & I ordered didn't come out that great. The wait to get seated was super fast! I would've thought that since this location just opened they'd be packed with people waiting outside but there wasn't. We were brought to a table in the back but the table wasn't even cleaned yet so I asked to be seated at a booth since they had to still clean the original table we were to be seated at. The booth me & my bf sat at was also NOT CLEANED yet but it was pretty minimal so our host had to tell one of the waitresses to just wipe the table. I would give the wait time to be seated a 4 star.  Our waitress' name was Mal & she was very sweet. She took our appetizer order & it came out within a good 5 minutes of ordering. As for our main dish, we waited a good 45 minutes for our food, then Mal came to tell us that they were out of the baked potato & that's why it was taking long for our food to come. Honestly if the cooks knew they were out of potato then we should've been told @ the 10-15 minute mark, not @ 45 mins. We got to the place @ 6:30 PM & we literally received our food @ 8:00 PM. Total fail Applebees. My bf & I ordered the 8oz steak - when the food came there was a total difference in the sizes. My steak actually looked like an 8oz, whereas my bf's steak looked waaaaaay smaller. We ended up complaining to what looked like the manager. I didn't get her name but she was wearing a light blue collared shirt. My bf asked her what size does she think his steak was, laughed in disgust & said ""that's a 6oz but it really looks like a 4oz steak"". She offered to have another 8oz steak made so my bf said ""OK"". After that my bf didn't even want to eat his food because his mac & cheese with bacon was actually hard & almost cold. We waited another 15 minutes for his 8oz steak to come out but it was nowhere to be found so we asked for our check then left. Overall food rate is 3 because our appetizer, it was called ""The Combo"" was very fulfilling. Maybe next time I come here, maybe in 6 months to a year, they'll be more consistent with the food & all but for now I'm gonna stay away from Applebees."
Ao H.,"Waianae, HI",9,36,30,4.0,10/7/2017,What's with all the low star ratings!? The service was very friendly and helpful offering advice and choices. Food came out hot and yummo. Mahalo Rebecca!
