Lyndsay L.,"Honolulu, HI",168,12,34,4.0,6/5/2017,"My boyfriend and I were at first hesitant to try Applebee's because of all the negative reviews about the food, wait time, service, etc. but we decided to give it a shot.  Overall, our experience there was definitely better than what many of the negative reviews made it out to be.  We arrived there around 5:30pm Sunday and we were seated right away.  The waitress took a few minutes to initially come to our table but overall, she was very friendly and answered any questions we had.  My boyfriend and I ordered from their special where you can get an appetizer (or two salads) and two entrees for $25 total, which we thought was a good deal for two.  We ordered the spinach artichoke dip for the appetizer and for the entrees, I ordered the three-cheese chicken cavatappi and he ordered the chicken tenders. I was most nervous about how long our food would take only because many people on Yelp said that the wait time for the food was outrageously long.  Surprisingly, our appetizer came within about 5 minutes and our entrees came out some time after that; it was definitely not a wait longer than any other restaurant.  Overall, I found the food to be delicious.  I am a huge spinach artichoke fan and it was very good; it seemed a bit saltier than other places but it wasn't a problem.  My boyfriend seemed to like his chicken tenders and he had ordered tea and he liked the fact that they gave him extra hot water on the side.  My pasta was good; very cheesy and the chicken was tasty and seasoned.  I only wish that they gave a little bit more chicken; the chicken to pasta ratio seemed off.  Then we ordered a chocolate chip cookie sundae for dessert which was delicious as well.   The food was overall great but there were a few minor things that struck me as odd overall.  First, our table was bare; it had the menus on it, but usually in restaurants, they usually have a small rack with condiments, salt and pepper, etc.  At this restaurant, there wasn't any of that so we had to ask for any condiments we wanted.  Also, when the waitress gave me my water, there was no ice in it (it was semi cold) and she said it was because they had run out of ice, which has never happened to me in a restaurant before. Honestly, those little odd things that I had noticed did not bother me much; I'm not super picky and it did not affect my overall visit.  There was no wait time, the food was good and came out quickly, and everyone was very nice.  I would try to go back again."
Hyn G.,"Mililani, HI",67,88,24,1.0,9/14/2017,Terrible terrible terrible!  No customer service at all. Wait time OMG IS SUPER LONG when they are NOT BUSY . I am not making this up! I have been to the Hawaii and Orlando APLLEBEES Different times and Days and still the service is bad. Good Luck!
Midori W.,"Hauula, HI",128,3,2,3.0,10/1/2017,"I wish I could give them more stars since their customer service is good despite their busyness. Caesar salad that I had was mixed with brown, bitter, rotten lettuce. This was a first visit and worries me when it comes to what they may be serving. Even drive thru joints have green salads that are good enough to be served."
Charmaine C.,"Waianae, HI",40,112,65,5.0,9/18/2017,Liked the menu and the service was good. Kalelani at least I think that was her name.....thank you for such great service!!
Gareth O.,"Wahiawā, HI",19,2,,1.0,11/18/2017,"I'm not one to use Yelp but this birthday dinner turned out to be a disaster!! If I could give it NO stars I would!!  Our party of 5 originally wanted to eat at Cheesecake Factory but the wait was 2-2.5hrs long so we decided to eat at Applebee's.  Upon arriving, we were told there was a 45min wait which we were okay with even though there was a lot of empty tables. 45min came and we were seated. Took about 10mins for our waitress to come to our table when we ordered our drinks. Drinks came about another 10mins later and found several of our glasses cracked. At the same time we ordered our appetizers (fries, chips & salsa and won ton chicken tacos) and our meals same time. Our appetizers came about 30mins later only to be told that they were out of the chicken tacos and our fries were cold!!  An hour goes by and we still have not received our meals!!  2 meals eventually come (shrimp stir fry & bbq brisket tacos) and both were cold!!  The other 3 orders were baby back ribs which after 1 hour 15mins go by still have not come to our table. FINALLY.....our waitress comes to our table only to tell us that they're out of ribs!!!  How the hell are they gonna tell us they have no ribs after we wait over 1 hour?!?!  A manager then comes and talks to us apologizing and asks us if we wanna order something else. We tell her NO we already lost our appetite!!  She then tells us that she'll take care of our bill and walks away.  Our waitress comes back to the table apologizing, saying that the entire staff was all new people. Regardless new or not, they have terrible communication!!  I also heard another manager talking to the party behind us cause they were complaining about their mozzarella sticks being frozen and they were being told about steaks that they ordered were all out as well.  I will NEVER come to Applebee's again!!"
Nate P.,"Honolulu, HI",102,6,13,2.0,11/19/2017,"Honestly, if this place is prepared for success this place would be great if staffing got it together. If you talk to your waitress and be understanding than you wouldn't be angry at the staff if you know the situation. Our waitress kept informing what is going on and we got to the root of the situation. Management was recently fired, cooks are barely new, kitchen can get backed up, especially during peak dinner hour and even if it looks slow. So, until they get their act together, this place is going to get bad reviews."
Jason R.,"Ewa Beach, HI",35,16,1,1.0,12/6/2017,"Wednesday night, restaurant half empty but there's a 15 min wait to be seated because the kitchen is behind.....ok. No worries, it can happen but why won't you let us sit at one of the 20 empty tables even when we asked to? This full waiting area feels claustrophobic in an empty restaurant."
Tamara S.,"Waipahu, HI",26,6,3,2.0,9/22/2017,"I hate to be one of those people that only leave reviews because of a bad experience, but hopefully this will save a lot of you some time going there or at least pose as a warning. My first time dining in at the Applebee's and to be quite honest, it may be my last. First impressions really can make or break any situation. From the moment we stepped through the doors, my friends and I were greeted with the most sassy, insincere hello by an employee going by the name Jaz. Her tone was VERY unfriendly, her face registered like she didn't care about doing her job to the best of her abilities, and the vibe she gave off was so unpleasant that it made my friend and I exchange the same taken aback look. When she seated us, she quickly motioned to where the drink menu was located, said her insincere parting words, and went on her way. Coming from a girl that works in customer service, I totally understand that some days are worse than others because some people suck and ruin your mood. Maybe she was having a bad day, who knows. However, if your job is to be that first point of contact between the business and the customers, you should be able to at least ACT like you want to be there and ACT like you like your customers. If you can't, then maybe you should ask to switch to a position where you don't have to interact with people.  We would've walked out if it wasn't for the very friendly server who helped us not soon after being seated. Aaron G was a breath of fresh air after that uncomfortable encounter. He was kind and friendly and had a good vibe about him. Our food came out in a timely manner and he checked up on us to make sure we were doing ok. I really have nothing bad to say about my experience with him or anything following the initial first few minutes in the restaurant. It's unfortunate because I was excited to finally try this place out. Every other time I wanted to there was always a long wait. But now after this experience I'm sad to say I may not ever go back. One person really can ruin your entire outlook on a person or place and that's exactly what happened."
Bryan C.,"New Orleans, LA",277,6,5,3.0,4/23/2017,"The service from Kristina was phenomenal! She greeted us with a huge smile and continued superb customer satisfaction throughout our whole meal.  We walked in, hostess stated there was a 30-45 minute wait, however, we recognized multiple tables open in the bar section. The hostess redirected our party of five. Kristina introduced herself and, as I said before, service was great. I even noticed her taking care of her other tables with the same standards she treated us.  I had to drop down to 3 stars though; the food was not great. I ordered the clubhouse sandwich and it was very plain. Nothing that grabbed my attention. My wife's dish, that I snuck a few bites from, had the same boring effect."
Tiara R.,"Ringgold, GA",3,2,,3.0,12/11/2017,"Really good deals for appetizers. But they seem to be under staffed, the food tasted like it sat for a while. The server did try his best tho. Will return and try it again."
Samantha E.,"Waipahu, HI",52,3,3,1.0,12/30/2017,"This is by far the worst experience I've had at any restaurant. My family & I decided to come to this specific location due to such great feed back via friends/family. But tonight it took at least 30 mins it's to be sat mind you it wasn't as busy as expected, it took over an hour to just get our kids food out (ordered first). They over sat our awesome server David & yet nobody took the initiative to help run out his food. Their manager who was in a blue Hawaiian print shirt named Lei I believe, walked AWAY while we were still trying to explain our experience & let her know how horrible their food quality was. Our food not only came out over an hour later but dry & cold. Their new general manager Rich came out & was amazing ,he explained their situation with what the store is going through right now & he not only came out to help us but he comped our entire bill & gave our children chocolate milk & ice cream! Hopefully the team work improves..."
R K.,"Kapolei, HI",0,76,106,4.0,8/28/2017,Came again on a Saturday for lunch.  Service again was great and very attentive.  This time I tried the lunch combo with Chicken Fajita Roll up with a Grilled Chicken Cesar salad.  Definite plus over my last dish I had. Truly enjoy all of the TVs all around.
Claudia M.,"Kapolei, HI",0,9,,3.0,10/13/2017,"My first experience at Applebee's was not that good haha. First things first, upon entering, there were three hosts at the front who looked at us and continued their conversation without saying hello, or ""We'll be right with you"" or something. We stood there awkwardly for several minutes until we were acknowledged and brought to our table. )': After being sat, our server came to us promptly. I could tell she meant well because she advised us that happy hour was ending, but I felt sort of rushed to put in an order. After putting in our appetizer order, she came back and asked if we were ready to put out entree order in. I told her that I needed a few minutes, but I don't think she heard me because she started taking our order anyways :') So oh well lol. The food was all right. The mozzarella sticks we ordered tasted very generic. We also got the spinach and artichoke dip, which was pretty all right. I ordered a steak with garlic mashed potatoes, and the steak came out very chewy and the mashed potatoes were kinda liquidy haha. It was okay. My brother's and sister-in-law's orders were all right too. Overall, our visit was okay! We may attempt to come here in the future. Three stars because I'm not that hard to please really, and I could tell that the waitress was trying hard! That day we went, they ran out of ice so they couldn't serve any drinks lol. Oh, and on a side note, the only reason why we went to Applebee's that afternoon was to redeem a coupon we received in the mail for a free appetizer. However, we were told that it could only be redeemed at the one in Ewa Beach? Odd, but oh well. If you go here with a coupon, be sure to ask if it can be used at that location. :-)"
Keaka M.,"Kailua, HI",23,1,,1.0,12/10/2017,Worst place ever. Got sat in a far corner of the bar even though the place was empty. Food took over a half hour to arrive. My husband's tacos and fries were cold and my burger was so over cooked it was tough to chew. My onion rings were like chewing on rubber. When we told the waitress she just told us it's because of the new crew working. They still working out things. They gave us a 15% discount on my husband's tacos but that was about it. Never going back again.
Chloe L.,"Waipahu, HI",47,21,13,2.0,9/3/2017,"Aw man, so disappointing! Our party of 3 went on a Sunday afternoon and had about a 20 minute wait. They have a convenient text message alert system set up, so I could browse the mall as I waited for a table. We placed our order (drinks, appetizers, entrees) and waited ages for water glasses, then we started getting our entrees. I asked where our appetizer was. Apparently our waiter had forgotten to put in the order for our appetizer. I later asked about our drinks and the waiter came back with the wrong drinks all around. Manager took care of the appetizer, but we still ended up having to pay for our drinks ($20 for what we didn't even order). Food was fine; nothing fancy - pretty much like Ruby Tuesday.  Meh"
Jason J.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,1,,1.0,12/8/2017,$7 for an 8oz cup of soup to go. It's a sports bar not fine dining. I will not be going back.
Michael B.,"Mililani, HI",155,17,68,4.0,5/20/2017,"This is one of the newer establishments in Kapolei, so it gets busy all the time.  Our servers and bartenders are always friendly and this is turning into a go-to place for us when we don't want to cook.  The only reason it is not a 5 star rating is because a hostess gave us a 1hr45min estimated wait time when there were clearly 20% empty tables.  20 minutes later, we decided to settle for somewhere else, only to get a call from applebees with an open table right after we placed our order. Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken - Chicken is extremely difficult to cook, but Applebees serves a Cedar grilled lemon chicken that puts expensive restaurants to shame!  I found out they tenderize their chicken every morning so it's juicy and flavorful without drowning it in sauce!  The chicken is served on a bed of wild rice that has a texgure and flavor that completes the dish.  I ordered this 3 times in a row and will probably continue to do so."
Jenny B.,"Waipahu, HI",61,31,62,3.0,5/3/2017,"I really thought this was the first Apple Bees to open on the island, but it's the second. But it's my first time ever.  Took me and my family a while to find this restaurant cause I've only been to Kamakana like twice but I never really walked around. Very spacious, clean look, and nice. We was greeted once we opened the door. I thought it was gonna be busy but it wasn't even though it was lunch. Got seated right away. We got the big table near the entrance. When I was about to sit down, the seats had oil spots and looked dirty. The waitress who sat us down saw me using the napkin to clean and she didn't really say anything. My mom even noticed her looking at me to what I was doing but didn't at least offer to clean it or get me more napkins. But it's okay I guess. They obviously had better things to do.  We ordered the 2 ribs deal (I forgot how much it was, but it's the last page of the menu) and a salad with steak chimichurri. We also got the trio appetizer. While waiting for our food, our drinks arrived. The diet soda my mom got tasted hella flat and my boyfriend got a mango tea. Had no mango tea taste what so ever. It just tasted of a plain Lipton iced tea. We told our waitress that and common sense you either ask for a refill or replace it with something else. But noooooo, she just said ""oh I'm sorry. I'll let me them"". At first I thought maybe she'd get a new better one but no. Upon that, the food tasted okay. I ordered the salad but I pretty much ate the steak and had a few bites of salad. It didn't taste of anything great.  To be honest, I would rather go chillis instead.  I would of understand if it was busy but no. You could see the waiters just standing around talking story."
Your247addiction A.,"Mililani, HI",2,8,5,1.0,8/22/2017,"Honestly... terrible.  Service was slow... server didn't greet our table for almost 15mins. It took 45mins to get our entrees which was served cold... not hot, cold.... and it wasn't even busy. The food tasted jus shy of a poorly nuked frozen microwaveable dinner. Disappointing experience. Definitely over priced for what they serve.  Nevertheless, I tipped over 20% cause that's just what I do... and will most definitely NOT be dining there again.  2pax= $85... pass. 1star only because 0 stars is not an option."
Nancy M.,"Honolulu, HI",5,15,7,5.0,8/16/2017,"Everything was WONDERFUL!!! Everyone working there was WONDERFUL! Food was WONDERFUL!!! I can't wait to go back! I ordered the Pork chop with Cajun Shrimp! I can't stop thinking about it! Seriously! And...Garlic Mashed Potatoes! My daughter ordered the Steak Salad, and she loved it!  We had chocolate molten lava cake with ice cream. All I can say is yummy, yummy, yummy! Everyone needs to come here and try this place out!!! I'm serious!!!"
