Aspiring M.,"North Broadway, NJ",3,37,31,5.0,7/22/2017,"For one I love this applebees . The location, the staff and the food is great . I've never had a problem when eating at this applebees . The bartenders are always fast with service as well and cheerful .  People complain about how long their food takes to come , if you want faster service come at an appropriate time or sit at the bar where staff is always at your service or how about applebees menu barely changes know what you want when you enter that way you can order your food and drinks simultaneously."
Sheena D.,"Belleville, NJ",83,35,2,3.0,12/15/2017,"Food was a tad bit cold, steak was done as I asked tho. Waiter was very attentive and to top it off, got my $1 long island iced tea. Although they take long for the drinks, it's $1 so I won't complain...."
Gypsie R.,"Kearny, NJ",3,9,1,2.0,12/19/2017,Chicken with pasta had about 2oz of chicken and about 2 cups of pasta-where's the meat? Could've used more sauce. Chicken lime cilantro was missing lime and cilantro!  And why would they put cranberries in the rice that goes with this dish? Waitstaff friendly.
Chadwick H.,"Belleville, NJ",52,6,22,1.0,4/24/2017,"I never want to walk in an Applebee's at 11:45pm(15 minutes before closing) I ask about their happy hour drinks and be told by Jess(bartender) that....ok...but we are closing so you can only have one. This is what is immediately told to me after waiting for service. It's a drink,not a well done steak. ??? Number 1...I asked about your happy hour not your opinion on how many drinks i can take in a 15 minute period. Number 2 I'm a grown man old enough to be your father and can determine how many drinks I can have or decide to order in 15 minutes. If your open for 15 minutes I'm allowed to order atleast two maybe three drinks if I chose. This Applebee's is terrible. Always has been. Had my one draft and left. Still tipped."
Victor H.,"Kearny, NJ",0,22,5,2.0,8/29/2017,"I only come here because it is so close to home.  It seems more of a hangout for the workers than an actual restaurant.  There is a 5+ person table by the big tv that is occupied by the staff most of the time.   Today, the server was good, but the runner...  He handed my 11 year old a hot plate so he didn't have to reach to put the plate down.  He then handed my wife her plate of food putting it directly2  inches in front of my face.  I'll take the ride to Chili's from now on."
Annabelle L.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",441,477,661,1.0,3/5/2016,"I didn't have a great experience in the Clifton location and reviewed the place online.  I was contacted a manager a given a welcome back card of $20 to give Applebee's another chance.  I decided to try another location and so here I am reviewing Kearny location. Ok, I came here on a Friday night and it was busy but not crowded.  My family and I quickly got seated.  Five minutes waiting and wondering if anyone is going to ask if we'd like anything to drink, our server, Perry, shows up.  We decided to give him our full order.   When the food came, my order of bourbon chicken and shrimp came out to be riblets and fries.  I just couldn't believe it!  Few minutes later, they brought out the correct dish.   The food was mediocre just like any other diner restaurant but I didn't expect anything more.  However, the service was slow.  I paid the bill on my credit card, which Perry took and walked around with it for another five minutes before he brought it back with my receipt to sign.  Well, I'll be checking my credit card statements and if there's theft charges, I know who stole it!   Must avoid all Applebee's!"
Crystal S.,"Newark, NJ",0,1,1,1.0,11/26/2017,The worst experience at a Applebees...Been here for over an hour and no food ..Prefer the Newark 100%
Kai H.,"Arlington, WA",1,1,2,1.0,11/27/2016,"I've ordered the Oriental salad many times from applebees. Today, I ordered it to go and this is what I came home to...maybe next time I'll ask for extra greens with my salad. I would normally excuse this but, we came here last week and my husband got the three cheese pasta from the 2 for $20menu. Needless to say ,it was also subpar and they definitely cheated him on the meat."
Joel M.,"Bayonne, NJ",0,5,1,5.0,1/1/2017,I have been to this particular location a few times. Overall the staff IMO always greet you as they should and the restaurant has a good atmosphere and is clean and well kept. The appetizers are really good. I like the idea that you can buy 2 smaller appetizers for $9.99 or 3 smaller appetizers for $13.99. My GF always orders Shrimp 'N Parmesan Sirloin and she loves it. I usually order the Three-Cheese Chicken Cavatappi and it is really good. I will be returning back to this location!
Foodie G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3,24,6,5.0,5/27/2017,"I hadn't been to this location in awhile, but yesterday I did since it was nearby. My best friend and I both only had appetizers. Which came out quick thank god because we were very hungry! Our waiter Camilo was very courteous and honest with his suggestions. Which were all fabulous. Great service great food. Will be coming here more often!"
George M.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",98,1,,1.0,2/18/2017,This is terrible service she asked me to carry her plates. Waited a WHOLE 45 minutes for my stinking straw. This is just brutal. Food doesn't even come out on time. Overall I rather eat under a bridge with a armless hobo.
Giancarlo T.,"Belleville, NJ",0,6,3,2.0,8/19/2017,"This used to be a great location years ago but the quality has slowly gone downhill. The boneless wings are too fried and rough, you get 3 celery sticks,and the drinks are all water and ice."
Tony V.,"Newark, NJ",39,39,140,1.0,8/27/2016,Wow let me start from the greeter..he walked us to our table and rattled of something touched the pad on the table and said enjoy your meal..not starting of right...he said Stephanie will be right with you...she was not...we moved to the bar... Thanks Danielle service was fast and friendly...she gets the star.... i wont be coming back...
Cheryl W.,"Linden, NJ",64,154,957,1.0,6/22/2016,"Ordered Traditional buffalo wings, asked for flats only, they could not accommodate my request, but I placed the order anyway. Worse mistake ever, the wings were Hor-ri-ble; they tasted like my mouth fell in a vat of Diamond Crystal Salt. I've been to this location before, usually my complaint is on the slow service, but I'd rather have slow service with good food. I can't eve consume this garbage. So much for lunch, I can't wait until I get off so I can get something to eat, I'm starving."
Tiah D.,"East Orange, NJ",35,3,1,1.0,8/23/2016,The worst Applebee's I have ever been to.... Please don't waste your money here it sucks 20 min for soup hard ass burger buns dumb ass waitress...never agian
Fabio G.,"Kearny, NJ",24,6,32,1.0,12/10/2016,"This is officially the last time I go to my local Applebee's, again my car pick up meal was cold and after waiting 30 minutes from my indicated arrival by the staff, my sides were missing after I got home!  BK will do next time."
Chelley C.,"Durham, NC",0,22,17,5.0,9/7/2016,"We had a really good first experience at this Applebee's location.  Pros: Well... hats off our server Jamil. He was absolutely awesome! Very attentive without being pushy. He was patient and didn't get annoyed at our inability to make up our minds. Which was impressive because even I was getting a tad annoyed at our indecisiveness lol. Well dressed and very well mannered. The next time we visit hubby said we will have to request to have Jamil as our sever lol. We went at a good time. It was a holiday weekend and I guess everyone was away which worked out well for us . No wait, no fuss. The food was good, as were the beverages.  Cons: None.  Our bill: Not bad, party of 3 (4 meals and 4 appetizers) and the bill was approx *$65 including 4 non-alcoholic drinks.  *Excluding the sweet tip for our deserving server Jamil ."
Hai Y.,"Newark, NJ",1,43,1,2.0,6/18/2017,"The only thing keeping this place open are the high schoolers who go here for the deals they have. The food is not good at all. If your hungry, and I mean starving, this will do the trick. I gave it two stars instead of one for the brownie with ice cream which was good. But their pasta was bland, and the portion of steak is so tiny for the price. Kearny has plenty of good restaurants along Kearny avenue, save your money and go to one of those ."
Nga P.,"Caldwell, NJ",6,35,23,3.0,5/2/2016,"It's an Applebee's. What do you expect? Given the food is slightly colder than it should be, I would say they just don't care as much here. But meh, it's a decent price for a decent dinner. Server was doing a good job comparing to most other severs.  Did not order liquor.  Triple chocolate meltdown was the highlight of the meal."
Kavita J.,"North Arlington, NJ",22,41,23,4.0,4/27/2016,"Their service is good - the place gets busy and the wait staff put in an honest day's work. The food is very average. I try not to order fried stuff but I ended up unknowingly ordering the tacos and they were deep fried - I could tell the oil was rancid. It left a bitter after taste. Other than that, the empanadas and quesadillas were pretty decent."
Greg K.,"Kearny, NJ",2,26,23,1.0,3/3/2017,"I'm done. With all Applebee's everywhere. My waiter said apps are half price after 10 pm tonight. So I added an app to my order. When the check came, it was listed with its full price. I just don't trust these people anymore."
Lindsay M.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",53,13,4,1.0,4/25/2016,"FOOD POISONING FOOD POISONING FOOD POISONING DO NOT EAT HERE. My boyfriend and I BOTH ate the onion rings, buffalo wings, and chips with the queso dip. At 4 am I woke up and ran to the toilet. I threw up for 4 hours. When he called me in the morning his head was in the toilet. Your place is fucking filthy Applebee's"
Kent K.,"Alliance, OH",34,174,22,1.0,8/23/2015,"Listen to this story. There was once a crowd of eleven-teen hoodlums that went to New York. (This is a lousy story.) Ok we wondered around for 29,824 steps, 15.43 miles, past millions of good food places. We ate some pizzas at yay time in the early afternoon, but No supper. So we went back to JERsey, and ate at APPLEbees.  I got a turkey sandwich and fries. The taste was decent. The service wasn't really. But halfway through my midnight meal, bad things started happening. Either I was having a kid or Applebees was intent on killing me with food poisoning. Either way, it was painful. Bad experience."
Victoria V.,"Harrison, NJ",0,2,,1.0,8/5/2016,"Not worth it. The service sucks waited on water for 10 mins, no utensils for 5 mins after food came out. Once the food came out: spinach dip was watery & cold, quesadillas were extra salty, cold wings, Overall food not well prepared. I know Applebee's isn't the greatest but this was beyond terrible."
Joel C.,"OZONE PARK, NY",126,11,,1.0,4/30/2016,This location is careless and lazy. My girlfriend and I came here twice and both times had our orders screwed up. I ordered a Mac and Cheese where they didn't put in cheese.
Keoka R.,"Manhattan, NY",23,11,2,4.0,8/14/2015,"I feel like the people below leaving reviews are being a wee bit petty.We got here at about 10:45pm ..its relatively busy.Waited 25min got our seat. Waiter came by and was VERY helpful and attentive . IT'S APPLEBEE'S not Phillipe Chows.Our appetizers came in great time not with our meals following too closely behind.Our waiter even bought a cup of hot water for my 8 month olds baby food. I looked around at other tables trying to  sense the atmosphere,no one seems annoyed or   glad we came instead of following reviews ,I'm VERY picky and so far so go.Will come back."
Ms. D V.,"Watertown, NY",1,18,6,2.0,1/31/2017,"Over cooked beef tips, cold food. Wouldn't waste money here again. Keep driving by.  (Waitress was very nice & friendly)"
Zel A.,"Belleville, NJ",15,12,19,1.0,3/12/2016,"i dont know how to explain, but the chef seemed like he was in a hurry!!wwwoooorrrrssssttttt applebees ever!!!!! The server DIDN't give us plates!!!"
Jose M.,"Wheeler, MI",4,35,18,5.0,7/3/2015,"The ambiance was very nice the food was good and desert was the best , the girl who serve my table was extra nice I will come back soon"
Ed K.,"Kearny, NJ",97,7,3,1.0,2/19/2016,"I have to say that I will never into that location again.  Matt who was the manager who opened the place did a great job, since he moved the location is a ""hell-hole"".  The staff a rude and not willing to work.  I have had to ask to have my appetizer placed removed while I was eating dinner.  I asked for Burger without the bun due to a gluten allergy and you have thought I asked for the world.  All the huffing and puffing of the wait staff.  The General manager is no better.  He is the ring leader to all the problems at the location.  New construction will be bringing some new names to the area across the street.  I hope that can step it out or they may be out on the sidewalk."
Lucille G.,"Montville, NJ",169,24,5,2.0,5/3/2016,I always order curbside to go and my boneless buffalo wings were cold. The triple chocolate meltdown is really good. For ordering curbside to go I always have to wait an extra 5-10 minutes to get the food and its usually cold -_-
Yan M.,"Jersey City, NJ",405,237,456,3.0,7/12/2015,"Most convenient restaurant to where I was. After I sat down and checked into Yelp. I saw all the negative reviews about the service and long waits at this location. I would give service for my visit a 4 out of 5 since our waiter was very attentive and brought everything we asked immediately. I didn't feel like my meal was worth what I paid. I ordered the pepper crusted sirloin with whole grains. The picture in the menu made it look so amazing and delicious my mouth watered. Upon receiving my meal, I was completely let down. The plate was messy. The sirloin steak was so small i ate it in 5 bites and it was over salted. There wasn't much grains on my plate either. I usually leave a restaurant with leftovers but I finished my meal and was still hungry. Maybe cuz this is considered a healthy dish and they wanna keep it under 550 calories but it was not a normal person portion. My husband ordered the brew pub philly with a side of sweet potato fries and mayo on the side. They put his side of mayo on my plate so we were confused if it was a sauce for my meal for if it was his mayo. They brought him another side of mayo and the mayos did not have the same consistency. We concluded that one of them was actually ranch dressing. Not sure what it was for since neither of us had a salad or anything where we needed ranch. Other than that, he said his sandwich was delicious."
Vanesha T.,"Plainfield, NJ",97,28,22,3.0,10/18/2016,"Went around 5-6pm, service was good, food was good, but terrible portions. Hot shot whisky chicken, the size of my palm. Cheeseburger quesadilla was great but the sides were like 12 fries. Second Applebee's where I ordered regular priced entrees that were worthy enough as half priced apps. Maybe part of their 2 for 20 deal...."
Michelle P.,"Philadelphia, PA",123,216,337,4.0,3/18/2014,"Everyone thinks it's strange that I have never eaten at Applebees, so during St. Patty's Day weekend, I decided to try it.  The place was packed, so I sat at the bar.  They had good drink specials for the weekend and food specials.  I tried the Corn Beef Ruben, Fiesta Lime Chicken and Quesadilla Burger and all of them were great.  I didn't eat all of them, I just like sharing food with the people I eat with. The service was good and fast.  The manager even came around to make sure everyone had what they needed, which I don't see at any chain restaurants.   I usually never eat at chain restaurants, but I like this one."
Alexa A.,"Old Bridge, NJ",546,7,2,1.0,9/19/2017,"trash! our server did not acknowledge us first off. if we werent so hungry we would have left, we were not greeted for over 5 min. we knew what we wanted and we had a random guy take our order he wasnt too pleased with that but he took it and then we received our waters from our actual server. i don't think he even told us his name, we found up from the host the guys names was richard/rich... he acted if he was a zombie, he was rude and unpleasant! we were not being extra we were friendly and knew what we wanted to make it easier for him to make not multiple trips. anyway we get our food we did not have silverware he said ill be right back with it. he did not come back and wasnt going to come back. maybe he forgot who knows but he was just so rude and not happy with us! i never got my silverware from him so we asked the host and she did not want to be bothered, she was annoyed yet she is the one that sat us with him! she brang us the silver ware. but he didnt even remember or say sorry i forgot it like u pretended as if i been had my fork and knife! like are you joking thats what making me write the review im sitting here waiting and my food is getting cold waiting for you and then  see you talking with another table! this guy needs to retire or get fired. then we WERE NOT GOING TO WAIT FOR THE CHECK! so we looked at the kiosk we did the 2 for 20 deal, we payed the money and left a 5 dollar tip! this whole time richard did not want to speak with us while eating, he did not want to ask how our meal was, nope he pretended as if we were invisible. he forgot our silverware BUT YET HE REMEMBER TO RUN OUTSIDE UP TO OUR CAR IN SUCH A MEAN ANGRY WAY! we payed in cash and left i tell you THIS GENTLEMEN CAME UP TO OUR CAR IN LESS THAN 5 MIN FOR WHAT?!? YOU CANT GREET US WITHIN 5 MIN BUT YOU CAN RUN UP TO OUR CAR AND ASSAULT US? WE asked him what is the issue he said did you guys pay, we told him yes the money is on the table and we told the host aswell the money was in plain eye sight! hes like oh , oh . he did not apologize he just was looking around our car, and circling it.  im going to contact a lawyer because he was writing our plates down if he was going to do something you deserve the tip you got your lucky my boyfriend was a server because if it was only be you would get straight pennies in the water thats your ti. but him circling the car i have threatened who does this? we tipped you 20 percent whats the issue?"
Coach D.,"Lancaster, PA",0,20,20,5.0,1/25/2014,"Nice place, clean..  Excellent service! Courteous staff, good food.  The manager took care of a large group with little notice. Thanks!!"
Paulo C.,"North Arlington, NJ",7,8,,1.0,6/23/2015,Horrible service; waited 20 minutes for a waiter; Been here several times and it's getting worse everyday!!! No one even came over to even ask what drinks we wanted. Will never be back.
Jonathan M.,"Belleville, NJ",2,7,,3.0,12/6/2014,"I like Applebee's. It's a simple, inexpensive, better than fast food restaurant. We arrived at 11:30 today, and were greeted kindly. One employee held the door for us and smiled.  We were taken to our table and discovered the table top was dirty and sticky, and trash underneath the table. I informed an employee and she (very kindly) let the hostess know and we were told we could move down a table, which we did, only to discover another dirty table, so we moved down one more. This table was clean on top and underneath, but just a little sticky.  Our waiter Tony came by, and was very nice, and took our drink orders. Then he came back and took our food orders. Good customer service from Tony throughout the meal. The manager, Marco, came by at one point and asked how everything was. We said ""fine"" but didn't tell him about the previous table situation. I don't know why, he seemed nice, but in the moment you hate to make a fuss.  Regarding our food, it was great. We ordered the 4 Cheese Mac & Cheese, the All American Burger, and two kids meals. We all shared all the food and it was great. Cooked well, good temperature, and tasted great.  We were asked about dessert, and were brought the check promptly. Overall it was a good experience. I've been to this Applebee's before and it's been good."
Alison B.,"Harrison, NJ",16,11,36,3.0,4/3/2015,"My boyfriend would prefer the buffalo wings the way they were. The new breaded recipe is not as good. The breading does nothing for it. Feels like a trial. Needs to be REAL buffalo wings like it was. Just saying. Me, on the other hand, always get catered to as a vegetarian,  so no complaints here. Would like the horseradish sauce back tho."
Jamie O.,"Kearny, NJ",80,21,20,2.0,9/28/2014,"We came out for drinks and appetizers and the experience was less than desirable. We sat in the bar area and waited about 20 minutes for our drinks. Our food actually came out faster. We ordered hot boneless buffalo wings and bbq boneless buffalo wings. They came out with no blue cheese or ranch sauce or celery. Perhaps they did away with the frills??  The hot buffalo wings had literally a small dollop of hot sauce on them and I took pics to prove it, not to mention the temperature was luke warm. Very unhappy."
