Albert T.,"Bloomfield, NJ",13,2,1,1.0,8/2/2016,"4 stars for the food, one for the waitress and staff overall sucked, Myself and son who's 16th birthday it was walked in the greeting was not good, he walked us past 15 tables I was like let us sit what's this a tour. They have these new ordering kiosk on the table I asked the guy what's this he says rudely ""I'm about to tell you"" I ordered an appetizer thru this thing it never went to kitchen waitress was young and not good at all, I asked for sweet ice tea brings unsweetened. I told her no apology looked annoyed like this is free food. Brought drinks no straws finally brought appetizer no napkins I had to go look for napkins. she never came back to table until I asked for bill. Bad experience for my son's birthday. Need serious training. No wonder it was empty. And the bill was incorrect."
Sheena A.,"Roselle Park, NJ",25,51,80,1.0,4/8/2014,"Don't know what happened to the service but it has certainly declined since my husband and I last visited. Either they are understaffed or not properly trained to deal with a large number of guests.  Came here on a Sunday for drinks and dinner with my hubby, we got our drinks after a substantial wait, ordered our dinner and a half an hour later still no dinner, our waiter was busy and seemed ill prepared for the crowd.  I kindly asked a waitress ""would you mind checking on our meals as our waiter is a bit swamped"", she kindly tilted her head to the side and informed me ""well I'm busy too hunny"".   It didn't take much after that for me to want to leave this establishment. When our waiter got around to us we requested the check to pay for our drinks, that in turn took another 15 or so minutes, with him returning to tell us he is getting the manager and will be right with us. By this time i'm hungry and fuming!  Manager finally arrives and wants to know who the waitress is, I didn't see the purpose in telling him so I again asked for the chick, he was dismissive in his behavior, telling us not to worry about the drinks as he turned his back to us and huffed away.  Needless to say we won't be revisiting this location."

Jay J.,"Belleville, NJ",0,10,,1.0,7/5/2016,"WORST APPLEBEES EVER! Went around 1pm on a weekday wasn't busy at all, got seated and waiter never came after 20 minutes. About 4 other employees were in the front just goofing off knowing damn well we were waiting for a waiter. After waiting and waiting we walked out and one of the employees held the door wide open without asking a thing as if he didn't already know what the problem was. Took a lot for me to not blow up. The applebees in Clifton is 100 percent much better and I will never step foot in this establishment again!"
Kizzie H.,"City of Orange, NJ",0,1,,1.0,12/2/2016,"HORRIBLE experience! My sister and I went in and sat down in a booth. I arrived first, and the waiter approached me in a timely manner. We asked about the happy hour specials and he gave them to us, then asking if we were ready to order. I ordered a Peach Sangria and my sister said she would stick to water. He walked away to put the drink order in. After a minute or so, we noticed the sign that is on every table claiming to give you an appetizer if none of the specified drinks were offered, which they weren't. So we asked the waiter about it and he basically said we weren't getting an appetizer because he has until the end of the bill to offer a drink. So my sister asked for a manager because she didn't quite understand. The manager comes over with an appetizer card and says ""listen I'll give you the appetizer card but I can't sit here and talk to you"". EXTREMELY RUDE! As a manager, it's your job to resolve the problems of your guests. At that point, my sister and I got up and left. We will not be returning."
Lucy D.,"Passaic, NJ",77,5,2,1.0,10/30/2015,"Worst experience I've ever had at an Applebee's. My friend and I both got literally the same meal. The 3 cheese chicken penne. My friend's plate had less than half of what I had in mine. We get the manager to complain hoping to get a plate with the appropriate proportion and he offers ""extra chicken"" as if we were just greedy guests. The customer service sucks. The hosts were chatting while there was a whole line of at least 4 couples waiting to check in for a table. Won't ever be coming here. I am definitely sticking to my normal location in Clifton, NJ."
Jaymie I.,"Fairfield, NJ",8,3,1,1.0,1/30/2015,"Food was horrible.  Me and my gf went tonight and the food was not good even for Applebee's standards.   I got the cross-cut ribs and they came with french fries that were extremely salty and the kitchen forgot to send out my cole slaw. My gf got the pepper crusted steak over spinach grape tomatoes and whole grains. The steak would've been mistaken or just plain bland steak the spinach and the whole grains were over cooked. The only bright spot of our visit was our server Barbara. She was nice polite and very kind,  she was such a delite her tip was over 20%.  If we go back to this Applebee's it would only be to be served by Barbara."
Anthony A.,"Kearny, NJ",18,23,2,1.0,9/19/2013,"You are kidding right?!? This place was named in ""operation swill""    If you are unaware of it they served rubbing alcohol in premium liquor bottles and still charged premium price. Thats the link to the facts. Was in here many times before i learned i was being bamboozled by corporate greed Id rather buy alcohol from nucky thompson Will never return EVER"
Susan M.,"Lodi, NJ",0,1,,1.0,10/6/2016,absolutely terrible.. my friend and I came in for a quick appetizer and it was more like almost a 40 minute wait and at last we cancelled one of our appetizers because we did not want to wait any longer. this place should work on speeding up a little. our food was cold by the time it came to the table. it was a total nightmare!
T'shara B.,"West Orange, NJ",48,10,10,1.0,8/9/2015,Our waitress (Julia) was sweet but the steaks we ordered were extremely salty and when the manager (Ricky) came out to speak to us he said there's nothing he can do because anything else's would be the same and walked off.  He seemed like he didn't have a care in the world.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  Poor customer service by management.
Lillian H.,"Kearny, NJ",0,1,,1.0,6/15/2016,"Came here with a friend for a late lunch because she was craving chili's molten cake, and this was the closest to Chili's dessert.. Never again!!!! We ordered an appetizer, 2 strawberry lemonades and 2 Three cheese pastas. I took ONE bite of my pasta and spit it out so fast! My stomach felt uneasy and was disgusted that I found a longgggggg strand of hair in my pasta. I called the waitress over , she appologized and offered me somthing else from the menu but who would want to eat there after finding something like that with an unsettling stomach? Not me. The manager didn't even come to our table to appologize personally? Like.. Really? It was not even busy for them to use it as an excuse. We came here for the molten cake and we didn't even make it through lunch, let alone ordering dessert. Lesson of the day: Don't cut corners!!! We should have gone to Chili's!!!!!!!!!! Do yourself a favor and skip this establishment, you could end up sick. I'm not a inspector or anything but I think that's a health code violation."
Giovanni C.,"Kearny, NJ",1,3,,1.0,8/9/2015,"If it was possible to give 0 stars i would. The most incompetent waiters ive ever witnessed. The wings looked like they were sitting around for hours and they just microwave and bring it out. This place is a joke, dont waste your time. Go to clifton.."
Melissa Z.,"Clifton, NJ",165,20,1,4.0,1/4/2015,"Went there for dinner with my friends Donna & Jessica the food was ok but our waitress Raquel was Amazing! She was sweet, knowledgeable of the menu, made suggestions and was on top of all our requests and needs. I suggest when you go in you request her as your server and tip her at least 25% she's that good"
Crissy S.,"Kearny, NJ",36,17,,4.0,11/3/2014,"The food at Applebee's is what you would expect being a major chain.  The quality of the food across the various chains I've been to is fairly consist.  I do feel that the Kearny location is certainly serving better food now than when it first opened.  I love their appetizers (spinach and artichoke dip is amazing!) and drink menu.  I hadn't been there on a weekend in quite some time and was surprised by how packed it was.  The servers were friendly but not super attentive on my last visit, most likely because they were completely packed!"
Joseph K.,"Kearny, NJ",0,15,,1.0,8/25/2015,"The place is clean, spacious and the service is fine, but the food tastes weird.  The salad was overly refrigerated and tasteless and the pasta went unfinished by me.  I've been told even the hamburgers aren't good.  Stay away unless maybe you want to have a few drinks at the bar."
Crystine W.,"New York, NY",753,1201,281,4.0,3/11/2011,"Gotta love your neighborhood Applebee's when it's past 10 and you're hungry, but low on cash.   I really enjoy their post-10 PM specials since the appetizers are half-priced.  Favorites are: - Spinach & Artichoke Dip - Buffalo Wings - Chicken quesadilla - Chili con queso I also like their $20 special: 1 appetizer & 2 entrees.  It's a limited menu, but that deal is REALLY good, where are you going to get so much food for so little??? Service is usually quick, but not necessarily the friendliest.  I've totally outgrown their birthday song & free dessert to celebrate so I only come here now for the past-10 PM deals :)."
Ana C.,"Kearny, NJ",31,12,1,4.0,2/12/2015,"Not a bad Applebee's, everyone's friendly right from the beginning until the very end. They have former town athletes on the wall which is pretty cool. The only thing is that they're waiting time is very ridiculous on Fridays after 10. But besides that, great way to spend dinner (half-apps)!!"
George L.,"Kearny, NJ",0,3,,1.0,4/10/2015,"My friend and I came here to get carside to go. First off we were greeted by two female employees who were very sarcastic. Secondly, when we got our meals and our fries were half bitten off and had BBQ sauce on them which we know is from a previous customers' plates perhaps maybe with their ribs? I find this unforgivable! Not even a refund on my money would make any better."
Angie F.,"Jersey City, NJ",4,31,15,1.0,2/28/2015,The WORST applebees I've ever been to. The service is horrendous. They ALWAYS mess up your order. The waitresses and hosts are too busy playing with their phones and joking/flirting with one another to be bothered serving anyone. I figured carside would be a better option....NOT!!! Good luck trying to get through on the phone. 20 minutes and counting...that's after being hung up on twice with no answer.  I wish the owner knew what was going on here!  It's absolutely pathetic!  I would give this place ZERO stars if I could!
Vera R.,"Kearny, NJ",0,2,,1.0,5/23/2015,"So I walk in ask for a booth while staring at two empty ones and Alina, the greeter, says no sorry none available. I said ok and sat. Two seconds later she brings two people to sit at a booth I requested before hand. No one was waiting so being busy wasn't the case and it was just two of us just like the two that walked in and sat at a booth after us. I don't get it. Always a problem with something when I come to this location. My last time here!!"
