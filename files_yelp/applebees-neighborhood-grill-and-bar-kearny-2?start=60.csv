Jorge S.,"Newton, NJ",0,77,,3.0,9/7/2011,"Not the best Applebee's (That credit goes to the Parsippany location on Rt 46), but not a bad one. and it's better than waiting 45 minutes at the Clifton Commons one. You can't go wrong with much on the menu at Applebee's  The Spinach and Artichoke dip is great."
Ricardo C.,"Kearny, NJ",0,4,1,3.0,4/12/2014,Always a line is the drawback. Food is as well as the service depending on the day. The liquor is about the best thing going for this place.
I-Charly R.,"Bloomfield, NJ",80,20,1,2.0,8/11/2013,"The wait wasn't long. The prices are great. However, the place feels like a chuckie cheese. They were so many kids there, it's hard to have a nice small date. Also, I ordered white almond rice with my entrée. My entree came out and I had to wait an extra 15 min for the rice. The dessert was good."
Tony M.,"Asheville, NC",108,132,78,4.0,4/26/2013,My first ever Applebees experience.  Not sure if my experience was influenced by being there with people i love.  but i had a great time.  food was great. service was top notch. Joint was jumping with a waiting line which told me that i might be expecting something good.  the waiting line did not lie.
Dan B.,"Manhattan, NY",582,475,309,5.0,11/5/2012,I've been to many Applebee's restaurants and I know this is a chain and it's not an over the top experience but the service is amongst many restaunts above par.  The managers are aware of everything going on and they greet each table.  I've been coming to this location since the day it opened its doors and I really enjoy this location.  I come here on Sundays to watch the Giants.  This location has over a dozen flat screens throughout the bar area and then some.  I would recommend this place for the fast and quick service and the amazing people who work there.  I truely believe it's the people who add the value to a restaurant establishment.
L R.,"Harrison, NJ",1,87,,3.0,8/16/2013,It is a standard Applebee's. The wait was not bad for a busy night and the staff was attentive and overall the restaraunt was managed well.
Leean O.,"Jersey City, NJ",421,396,195,3.0,12/26/2012,"I came here for a little football sunday action only to see my Giants get spanked. No worries however as my Steak Fajitas were very delicious and piping hot. My only complaint was the tortillas were sticky and that made them almost break as I tried to devour my feed. Our waitress did come around often and with a smile to keep us hydrated but since LEAN is in, all I had was water after water. All around A-OK."
Kathy T.,"Bayonne, NJ",0,6,,3.0,6/2/2013,The atmosphere is nice. Food was good with many choices. Worth going back.
Andrew C.,"Kearny, NJ",1,7,,5.0,5/13/2014,"I like this Applebee's.  They are nice, the food is great for the price and it has a great atomsphere. Love the two for twenty meals."
Butch M.,"Kearny, NJ",0,9,,3.0,4/10/2014,"Great food, decent service. I only come here for lunch. There are better places than here."
