Denise G.,"Union Grove, WI",0,16,7,1.0,11/3/2013,This Applebee's has gone downhill   The service is TERRIBLE. There are servers all over but they are basically standing around. When I asked to have a server come to get our order she was short with us and didnt apologize for making us wait for 10 minutes before anyone came. Not planning on coming again

Elan J.,"Kenosha, WI",11,88,24,1.0,3/28/2015,"Should be ZERO stars!!! First, I got a pager and it took us 45 minutes to be seated. Okay, figure its Friday and they are busy. My party arrived even before we were seated, everyone even the late arrivals. They had 15 people waiting for tables, while the staff hung around up front socializing. We also noticed several open and clean tables that were unused, just sitting there!!! My party waited 20 minutes for drinks and another 30 for appetizers. Ridiculous. I was the only one that ordered food. The fish fry I ordered was burnt and greasy with no flavor. There were patches of breading missing, like they were in a hurry. The fries were bland and dry. The ""coleslaw"" had no dressing, curious. Oh yeah, was that tarter sauce? It was cheap dill ranch dressing!!! I paid for my portion of the bill which came to twenty dollars, ugh. Upon leaving they would not give my friend a to go container for her half price appetizer...REALLY!!!  But the worst was yet to come an hour later when I didn't feel so good...food poisoning!!!  NOT HAPPY!!! DO NOT GO HERE!!!"
Travis B.,"Pleasant Prairie, WI",0,5,,1.0,5/25/2015,"Let me preface this by writing that I don't go to Applebee's because well...it's Applebee's. But I went this time because my wife had a $25 gift certificate.  We decided to get our food to go and eat at home. Our first sign that this place sucks was an almost empty parking lot.( this was a holiday and every other restaurant that we drove by was full of cars). We arrived in the bar to pick up our food. We gave our name to the bartender, she handed us a Togo bag of food and rang up our bill.  We arrived home about 10 minutes away and opened our containers to find out they messed up our order.( not even close). We called up on the way back to return the food. The gentleman was very apologetic and stated that the manager would speak to us and probably take something off our bill.   When we arrived back at Applebee's ,we returned the food to the bartender who was expecting us. The bartender stated she needed to speak to the manager. The manager was sitting at a table in the bar about 10 feet from my wife and I. She didn't even have the courtesy to come over to us and apologize(didn't even turn in our direction for that matter).  I will never set foot in this place again. Now you know why the parking lot is empty."
tony e.,"Waukegan, IL",0,2,2,1.0,3/31/2015,"This was the far worse experience I have experience I have had at any restaurant ever. First of all the little girl at the door did not want to seat us, she told me it was going to be a 20 minute wait and there where tables and 3 booths available and only one other person waiting ahead of us. I asked why we couldn't seat at one of the open booths and she had got a nasty attitude and said follow her to one of the open booths. After being seated from her being so rude, I noticed her telling one of the waitresses about me asking about the open booths. After that we waited 15 mins. for anybody even came over and asked if we wanted something to drink and it was the manager and she apologize and said it was some waitress first night. (Which that one never came tell after we got our food!) Once we placed our order we waited an hour to even receive our food and 3 other families that came in after us received their food way before we did and when we did get it my steak was super dry and the mash potatoes was cold. Now people this wasn't the worst part of it, the worst is that they had to put something in my food cause I came home and was on the toilet for 20 mins. which is cool for me cause I needed a colon cleansing, but I won't be back no time soon and maybe when we do go back the staff will have changed again. They have a huge turnover rate! Not a good sign at all! What a birthday treat I received from them!"
Holly S.,"Kenosha, WI",42,32,4,3.0,2/25/2012,"Had late night half price appetizers, mozzarella sticks and queso dip were both good, but my margarita left much to be desired-  it was on special, so i should have guessed.  The bartender was personable, and the crowd was quiet, good place to sober up with fried food after a few drinks."
J B.,"Racine, WI",3,94,1,2.0,6/25/2010,"So I am the first to review this place?  That's odd, since it's been at this location awhile and business seems pretty steady.  Well, this is not my kind of place, folks.  I usually dislike chain restaurants and Applebee's is the prime example why.  Does it get more bland, from the decor to the menu choices to the lackluster service?!  I ate there last night with Pinch and GG, cuz the latter likes it.  Chili's across the street, which I think is better, is too spicy for her.  I ordered the Fiesta Lime Chicken.  The only lime element in this meal was a small, dry/shriveled wedge on the side of the plate for garnish.  So a modest sized chicken breast covered with cheese, along with dubious tortilla strips and lackluster ""spanish rice"" goes for $10?  No wonder they're makin' money in this economy.  My advice for better dining in Kenosha is to head towards the lake.  There you'll find Twisted Cuisine and other more distinctive dining choices that are actually worth a try."
