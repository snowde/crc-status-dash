Mason R.,"Kyle, TX",0,10,4,5.0,9/30/2017,"Exceptional customer service over the phone, Joel made it very easy for my wife and Me to decide on what we wanted for dinner. Always a treat getting food and drinks there. Great atmosphere and always a wonderful experience"
Chris D.,"Wimberley, TX",425,93,19,1.0,10/9/2017,"I was very upset on my last visit to Applebee's. I ordered the 2 for $20.  I asked if I could substitute the burger listed on the deal for a burger of IDENTICAL price.  I was told that I could substitute the same priced burger if I paid an additional $1 because it had an egg on it.  I tried to explain that the burger (egg included) had the exact same price as the one on the list, but was told again that it would cost an additional dollar because of the egg. Tell me there is a $1 charge for ordering off the list - don't tell me it is because of the egg. The burger doesn't cost more because of an egg - I could order either one for the same price. This whole encounter was so ridiculous.  If logic is not going to be a part of the rationale for doing something, then please don't try to justify things with logic. Just say its $1 more because it is your policy."
Santee J.,"Kyle, TX",4,35,115,1.0,10/15/2017,"This review is for their carside to go service. You're supposed to be able to order online and they will bring it out to your car.  Tried to order a burger and fries. Something is obviously wrong with their website design. There is a required section to ""customize your fries"". I don't need to custimize my fries. Just want regular fries. Since this is a required section I have to select something to place an order  My wife chose the green beans then called the store and explained that I wanted fries. They said ok and said our order would be ready by 8:06pm. Drove up to the restaurant and waited. Finally got my order at 8:30 and you guessed it, green beans instead of fries. Can't imagine they've been offering this service too long with these kinds of simple mistakes."
Amanda S.,"San Marcos, TX",262,4,3,1.0,8/19/2017,I got the three cheese chicken cavaitappi. Maybe 2 oz of chicken and a milk sauce. You couldn't taste any cheese or seasoning. It tasted like noodles in milk. It was ridiculously bland and I was extremely disappointed.
Jim O.,"Austin, TX",8,218,16,4.0,9/22/2016,"I seldom write reviews on chains because ya either like them or you don't but Justin the host was particularly personable. However I've a real problem with their ""Presto"" system of ordering and paying.   Luckily a live person took our order but I don't know her name because it wasn't on the emailed receipt! Sorry Applebee's but I can get food a lot of places. One of the pleasures of dining is the human interaction!  The more you rely on Presto the less I'll be visiting your restaurant.  Yes the value is good as well as the food, but if it weren't for Justin I would have give this place a lower rating."
Debbie C.,"Toms River, NJ",1,10,9,5.0,7/15/2017,My husband is a big Applebee's fan...... I'm not normally one but tonight we went to the Applebee's in Kyle Texas and had a great experience! It was just after 10 so we ordered a bunch of half price apps and the food was really good. The best part of our experience though was Kayla. She is a great bartender. I've been bartending for 20 years and I know talent when I see it. You guys are lucky to have her. I watched her the whole time constantly move and she always had a smile.
Angela A.,"Kyle, TX",1,4,,1.0,5/20/2017,Our servers name was Kayla. We never saw her. Sat down for 10 min. Never got service.  3 tables got seated after us. And had drinks.  We got up and left.   I will drive to a different town if I want Applebee.
Tim V.,"Cedar Park, TX",19,257,133,3.0,4/14/2015,"Had to drive down south for my daughters HS Soccer playoff game so there wasn't a large selection of choices.   I started with the Long Island ""daily special"", let me tell you it was special alright, WAY too sweet and most defiantly not a real Long Island so i had my wife drink it since she like the sugary stuff. I had for the meal the Napa portobello chicken which wasn't too bad nothing to write home about but it still was satisfying enough.   My wife had the BLT, which again wasn't earth shattering but was atleast faily good portion. Bottom line is this is a typical Applebees, and that's not a bad thing it just means you will pretty much get the same food quality and value at all the Applebee's.  So if you are like me and not sure where to eat its always a safe bet on getting something you KNOW will be editable."
Shay K.,"Kyle, TX",34,54,53,1.0,12/17/2016,"This is for the Curbside service only.  Our experiences in side have been consistently good. Used a $5 voucher tonight due to the last Curbside order being severely under cooked.  Tonight's order was wrong again, and the manager (John?) wanted to talk in circles and apparently he is not that familiar with the burger menu; not to mention he checked the order personally so how could it be wrong?  Here's the problem w/ the order that the manager could not seem to comprehend:  The Classic Burger we ordered came with only a bun, burger patty, and cheese.  The Classic Burger, by Applebee's own product description includes ""Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, & Pickles"".  When ordering the Classic Burger, a reasonable customer assumes that lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and pickles will be on the burger, it is not required to request that they be added, because it comes with the burger.  John's argument is that the order instructions only stated ""no pink"" (which is was pink by the way), ""add cheddar cheese"", and a side of fries"".  When placing the Classic Burger online, the only options regarding lettuce, tom, onion, & pickles is to ""remove"" them....adding is not even an option BECAUSE THEY COME WITH THE BURGER!.  How about a refund for that burger at least? The other burger, The American Standard did indeed have the lettuce, tom, onion, and pickles as we selected to ""add"".  Good job there. Unfortunately, the ""no pink"" request was not done.  And ""bacon"" that is mixed in with the onion was so little that there was no discernible bacon taste."
Joseph C.,"Austin, TX",75,1,,1.0,9/1/2016,"I will chew my arm off before entering this establishment again.  Bar service- non existent. A lazy bartender with              zero skills and a vinegar attitude.  Cleanliness - dirty and disgusting.  Food- sub par, the apps tasted like frozen fare.  Atmosphere- Applebee's.. Obviously lame.  Location - strip mall in Kyle - convenient for locals.  Service/ hospitality - slow, horrible, uninspired. the unfortunate reality was that it seemed as the service had no ability to multi task. It felt like everyone hated working there, and they hated you for witnessing.  I never make reviews, but this place blows. I feel compelled to share. This place needs to hit delete and start over."
Mallory M.,"Austin, TX",973,41,12,4.0,11/20/2016,"I'm a sucker for a chain restaurant.  My husband and I had lunch here on Friday. The food was delicious, huge portions, and the service was excellent! Our waitress was very attentive, sweet, and quick."
Sarah L.,"Kyle, TX",1,3,2,1.0,5/1/2016,The Applebees in Kyle no longer does chips and queso?  Really?  It's cheese people.  Unfortunately I won't be coming here anymore then.  That's my go to appetizer.  So instead u get chips and Sala and you get like 10 chips for 5 people?
Eires M.,"Kyle, TX",15,26,20,1.0,9/23/2015,"App: moz sticks and new wonton chicken tacos Lunch: tx blazin burger Drink: frozen strawberry lemonade  Moz sticks frozen and fried (poor/avg) Wonton (interesting, too sweet, but good) Burger (poor at best, gross) Over all 5 or 6 out of 10 at best Server didnt know anything about the menu items. Every answer was ""im not sure"" or ""i dont know"" then proceeded to stand there instead of finding out an answe. Not impressed by any means. Just wanted to have asimple lunch with family.  Under seasoned, messy, soggy burger, fries were crisp, drink was good....."
Richard G.,"Smithville, TX",0,2,,1.0,3/26/2017,Worst service. Our first time here and they ruin it. Employees looked depressed and no t motivated. Server tells us that they're are no silverware so it will be a min. Food delivery was horrible. Won't be going back to any applebee's.
Tricia G.,"San Marcos, TX",0,3,,1.0,4/16/2017,Hour and half wait for our food with less 20 customers in the restaurant. Poor customer service and food was cold. Don't waist your money go somewhere else.
Kent M.,"Leavenworth, KS",1,9,,4.0,3/1/2016,"I ate there tonight about 10:30 pm.  PRO:  I  had the ribs and they were very good.   Not dry and not all fatty.  The BBQ sauce was good.  Salads needed to be cut up more as they had big pieces in plate.   No one spoke to us at the front door as we entered or thanked us as we left the place. They had a new thing you me ""TED"". You can pay at the table and summons the server on TED without yelling or waving.  Very neat.  You can add a tip easily.   You can even email a copy of bill to yourself.   No waiting for anyone.  The Manager John is running a good place there. He comes around to the tables to see how things are going and asks you how is everything going.   My server was excellent she checked back with me frequently to see if I needed anything.   Offered refills and our order was taken and delivered promptly and correct-- just like we ordered.  We did not wait to be seated.  Our server was so friendly sweet and nice.   She offered to show us specials in the menu  CON: the floor next to us was dirty and needed sweeping."
Andrea B.,"Houston, TX",55,26,5,5.0,10/4/2015,"I like this place, friendly people and nice atmosphere. I had the ribs and they were very good! My mom had the broccoli and shrimp pasta and it comes with so many shrimps! Wife had a healthy chicken option which it was really good. Overall, typical great Applebee's axperience"
Jeri T.,"Austin, TX",8,180,49,2.0,7/9/2015,Came in for a birthday dinner. I ordered a steak with a wedge salad. The blue cheese dressing was way acidic. I could barely cut the first steak then the meat was tough and gray - like it was freezer burned and microwaved. I sent it back and while I could cut the second steak - it was grayer than the first. Ack. The nachos were chips piled with lettuce and some melted cheese beneath. The second star is only for the fried green beans.
Dave L.,"San Marcos, TX",0,23,,1.0,6/29/2016,"Came in on our way home to san marcos from Buda, thought some quick food & a beer, walked in sat at bar, bar tender seems to be prego, no biggie, she abruptly asked ""can i get yall something to drink"". No reference to what specials, or variety at all. Nor did she first introduce herself, very rude.   I said i would like to ""try"" a beer, she just starts pouring me one, I notice than tell her I just wanted to try it. She rolls her eyes & gets a shot glass fills it than my wife says what she would like, she says ""do you actually want one"" or jus try it?  Rude as hell.  Seems like this individual is very annoyed & has no customer service skills whatsoever.  Will chose to sit at a table next time to avoid this one."
Joe S.,"Bastrop, TX",5,16,3,2.0,1/14/2017,"I've eaten here a few times. The food just doesn't taste good to me. Actually the appetizers are way better than the entrees in my opinion. Went in and asked how much the coors lights are, was told $1.50 like the previous times I was there. Then I got the bill and they ended up being $2.59.... thanks for the wrong price. When asked not even an offer to change the price for being told wrong."
Holly N.,"Kyle, TX",26,5,2,5.0,7/1/2016,My husband was able to order Monterray Chicken that wasn't on the menu.  The waitress was really nice.  I have been there a few times and haven't had problems yet.
Jeremy C.,"Austin, TX",10,35,13,4.0,5/3/2015,Servers and hostesses are always fast and friendly. Food has always come out hot. It is your typical neighborhood Applebee's so the food will be the same here or in North Carolina. They have most of their walls decorated with pictures of the local high schools and city of Kyle landmarks. I guess that's to make it feel like a local establishment engrained in the community.  My favorite dish is the Key Lime Chicken and Strawberry Lemonade.
Mimi L.,"Lockhart, TX",0,6,,5.0,9/16/2016,"I just placed a To-Go order via phone, but Google maps has the wrong phone number; it called a CA location. I was frustrated because it's Friday night, and I just knew we'd have to wait another 20+ mins. The manager of this store was very understanding and expedited our order which he brought out very swiftly! Thanks for the excellent customer service! The CA location was also very patient and understanding about the mishap. I reported the issue through Google maps, so hopefully they correct it ASAP to avoid anyone else the inconvenience. Next time, I'll use YELP!"
Amy C.,"Austin, TX",8,27,10,1.0,10/21/2015,My boyfriend and I were in town and visited Applebee's at this location for the first time. The service was mediocre and we were asked if we wanted macaroni and cheese with chicken or out of the box. We decided to go back a couple nights later and what we saw was very unprofessional managers who were drinking with guest while we were served cold food and constantly waiting for something. It's a shame that this one Applebee's caused every other Applebee's to lose us as customers. I would highly recommend the owner of the business evaluate their business culture and beliefs.
Daniela H.,"Austin, TX",49,315,124,3.0,11/20/2014,"I only did three stars because its Applebees.. regular chain, with regular food and nothing special about it. The customer service was great and I went here only because my nephew was crying in his car seat and it was the closet place to eat that had grilled chicken..  As far as chain restaurant in Kyle its a good place to visit.. So if you like this kind of place then go..."
Jeff S.,"Austin, TX",168,202,641,3.0,11/6/2012,"Applebees is what it is in terms of glorified fast food chain restaurants. I live in Kyle, TX, & there isn't a whole lot of selection when it comes to dining out here. Granted, there is a little bit of everything here: Good BBQ, run-of-the mill chinese, mediocre tex-mex & Mexican restaurants but nothing to the caliber of Austin or San Marcos.  On the menu, it's the typical generic staples as found in most Applebees. The bar area is nice & new & the bartenders/waitstaff is friendly & attentive. Beer selection is your typical Budweiser & Coors product but does have a variety of their different beers both on tap & in bottles. The dining area of the restaurant is very clean as expected of a brand-new restaurant. The walls are littered with various posters representing Kyle, Buda, & Hays County youth sports to give it a hometown feel.  In a town like Kyle, a restaurant like Applebees is a big deal & definitely a smart move for the local franchise owner. Even after the ""new"" rubs off, this place will always have a packed house. At least until the next big thing comes along!"
Janet P.,"Kyle, TX",0,7,,1.0,6/26/2016,Was so hungry for a good steak. Came to the wrong place!! Cooks here need to be trained on how to cook steaks. Lesson learned: DO NOT order steaks at this location in Kyle!
Shelley N.,"Austin, TX",25,11,1,1.0,9/17/2015,"First time to eat at an Applebee's in a very long time.  This place was extremely cold and the music was turned up extremely loud. So loud we did not hear what the servers name was and obviously she couldn't hear us as we gave our order. The soup came with the meal versus before and Hubby's meal was completely wrong.  The soup was good. Once husband's correct meal arrived, it was just okay. On top of which, his tea glass sat empty from the time the wrong meal arrived until after the correct meal arrived (good 10 minutes). Many serves/staff passed by without a blink."
Amaud M.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,10,4,1.0,5/14/2015,I stopped in with the family to grab a bite after a long day on a Thursday and the wait was incredibly long even though the restaurant was not full.
Dan V.,"San Marcos, TX",1,8,16,1.0,12/12/2015,We were in need of a gluten free menu. They brought a binder that was not easy to read . These place is always been hit or miss. But this is the last time we will be in there . A major chain restaurant can do better than an ingredient binder .
Steve C.,"Kyle, TX",16,39,4,5.0,6/2/2015,"Today our wait person was Connie. Aside from being a beautiful person, she was attentive and enthusiastic. The food was great. Thanx for coming to Kyle, we need you. I'll be back."
Mark L.,"Kyle, TX",8,55,10,2.0,1/8/2015,"Not really impressed. Maybe my pallet has matured after leaving college. It, like so many other corporate restaurants, is the same as its fellow eateries of the same name."
Serena M.,"Kyle, TX",1,19,,1.0,9/23/2015,"So so food, order your basic burger bland, the only thing that was good was the appetizers I ordered a sweet tea that was good until the refill came back  as unsweetened tea. took forever for the waiter . in an almost empty restaurant"
Mickey T.,"Burnet, TX",74,5,1,2.0,6/8/2015,"Young lady named Hannah, acted as if she was forced to serve us. Very uncomfortable ,, we all felt rushed. But the wings were great"
Marcus B.,"San Antonio, TX",0,6,,3.0,7/15/2015,I love this place for lunch.  I like the tortilla soup to start and the cedar grilled lemon chicken for an entre.  The staff is always friendly.  When I'm by myself I walk up and sit at the bar for a quick meal.
Mary P.,"Buda, TX",0,20,1,2.0,12/1/2014,The meals were good but the rib plate came out cool. Service was good. Wanted to post 2.5 stars but yelp would not let me. If food was hot the review would have been better.
Jayme W.,"Buda, TX",32,25,,2.0,3/15/2015,"Sunday afternoon around 1:15 with 12 yr. old grandson. We opted for the 2 for 20$ with one appetizer and two entrees. Mozarella sticks, 8 with marinara sauce. They were not warm enough for my taste and I tasted an aftertaste like you would from old grease. Grandson got the chicken tenders basket with fries. I got the riblets basket with fries. I asked for the chipotle sauce. Riblets were not only greasy, but every bite I took had a bone I had to remove from my mouth. Hard to eat and the flavor was not good tasted burnt. Service was fine. The waitress was friendly and not rude in any way. We were trying to get out within the hour so I really couldn't ask to have anything redone. I was not pleased with the taste of the food. I did ask for the Senior Discount and was given that."
Darlene Z.,"Donna, TX",12,16,,4.0,1/31/2015,"I must say I was pleasantly surprised by their lighter fare options. I had the lemon chicken with a quinoa cranberry side-pretty frikkin good. Now, typically, I would give this place three stars because it's a standard chain but because I enjoyed a good dinner and didn't go over my calorie goal I'm giving them four stars."
David L.,"Kyle, TX",32,6,,1.0,6/24/2014,Wife and I visited new Applebee's in our town. We walked in and several employees walked passed us and did not greet or acknowledge our presence.  We were shocked to see a new establishment have such poor guest service!  Don't waste your time and money visiting this Applebee's.
John A.,"Kyle, TX",141,155,,2.0,3/5/2013,"EAT at applebee,s this week( majority family choice )i would not  put it on my  prefered list after that  debacle firing of chelsea welch in another establishment , the positive , this visit saw the same quantity and quality  of food for the  price which comperes  favorably with other nationwide franchises    the neg      i ordered coffee and  it was served to me in a dirty cup ,it had spill marks  on the side and lip marks  on the rim INEXCUSABLE   .....for that  ill drop the rating down a star ..."
