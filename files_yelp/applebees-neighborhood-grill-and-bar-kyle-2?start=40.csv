K W.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,5.0,2/12/2016,"Just had an excellent experience working with John on a catering order.  Ordering was simple, and made on time.  He made it easy and I'll definitely be back for another catering order when the time comes."
Bonnie C.,"Kyle, TX",21,7,6,4.0,7/21/2014,"Me and my husband are regulars here. One thing you can count on is not only can u cool off here but it is freezing to the point that a quarter of the way thru our meals they were already cold. I have also learned that they cannot ever cook a baked potato right. I almost always have to send mine back to have them microwave it so it is soft. Regardless of being cold and undercooked potato the atmosphere and customer service is good. Ive never caught an attitude from anyone when I have asked them to rewarm or recook my food, they are always very happy to oblige. I am a picky eater so ut is sometimes difficult to find wait staff who will put up with me. I just need to remember to bring my jacket because its so cold."
Shauna S.,"Kyle, TX",4,2,1,2.0,12/20/2014,I ordered a steak with shrimp. It came out with grey color and had so much salt. The worst dteak I have ever ate. The place was clean and service was great but  food was terrible.
Elena F.,"Cedar Creek, TX",18,7,1,5.0,2/3/2014,My waitress name was Feliziana!  She was fabulous!  Always prompt to our table and very friendly and thorough.  The food was fresh and awesome!
Rachel L.,"Kingwood, TX",157,88,46,3.0,5/16/2013,"What you would expect from an Applebees.  Just ok.  However, LOVE the pretzel appetizer.  Keeps me coming back!"
jina w.,"Kyle, TX",8,49,23,3.0,12/31/2013,It's nice to have additional options in Kyle.  They have improved service since their initial opening. They have pretty decent steak for a reasonable price. They have a lot of choices. I enjoy their late night happy hour with half priced apps.
Dolores F.,"Kyle, TX",0,6,,3.0,1/26/2014,The food is pretty good when you get what you order.  I still eat here often but on two separate occasions I did not get what I ordered. Both times I ordered Lemon Parmesan Shrimp but got Cajun Shrimp instead. I sent it back. They made it right but I don't get why the two get confused. I still think the food and service are pretty good.
Jimmy L.,"Kyle, TX",36,8,,1.0,1/11/2013,I visited this Applebee's again to give them another shot.  I sat at the bar and ate wings and had a beer.  The wings were floating in the wing sauce so they were a little difficult to eat.  The bar was also understaffed.  1 bartender was trying to serve way too many people and others around the restaurant were standing around.  When I worked as a district manager I would jump in and help my workers during busy times.   Come on Applebee's.
Celia L.,"Kyle, TX",2,13,1,3.0,1/16/2015,"Nice servers but incomplete setups and managers that seem to be just going through the motions. Our burgers didn't have any veggies on them and the server kindly let us know that they were available upon request and he would get them for us. When he brought them the lettuce and tomato were frozen. Then my husband had requested sweet potato fries for an extra charge and got regular fries and at the end of the meal a basket of sweet potato fries arrived:/. The manager came to our table to ask how everything was and my husband said,""Not good."" The manger responded, ""Good!"" And asked the rest of the tables in the restaurant the same question. The food was hot(other than the frozen veggies) and our drinks were never empty."
Jack P.,"Kyle, TX",0,34,4,1.0,12/31/2012,"My first observation was that all the servers appeared to be very young and inexperienced. My wife and I ordered the 9oz steak which tasted odd. It wasn't very hot when it came out and my wife couldn't eat hers at all. She ordered the honey BBQ ribs to replace the steak and they were drowning in sauce and also tasted off. Our server advised us that sometimes their ""chefs"" rush the food out to complete the orders and sometimes send them out under cooked. I usually steer away from these chain restaurants but thought I would give our new local chain a chance. It confirmed why I avoid them."
Lisa C.,"Austin, TX",80,108,7,3.0,1/3/2013,"Same typical Applebee's. Our server was prompt, super sweet and helpful. I ordered this Cajun shrimp pasta dish. It was actually pretty good and had a LOT of shrimp! My friend didn't like his dish so much, he ordered the quesadilla burger. It looked good to me, but I didn't try it. It was more crowded than I had expected for this area but I guess we needed some restaurants out here."
Sylvia K.,"Kyle, TX",0,7,,1.0,9/17/2015,"The service at Applebees in Kyle, Tx, has been lacking terribly since they opened.  Last weekend, after much time between visits, we decided to have lunch at Applebees in Kyle.  Initially, I had experienced terrible service and tasteless food.  This time the food was much improved but the service was still bad.  The appetizer was served  along with the main meal regardless of the fact that we waited more than 20 minutes to be served.  The appetizer was cold and served without small plates, and even after I asked the waitress to bring plates we didn't get them.  We had to ask for drink refills and although the waitress said she'd be right back with more drinks she removed our drink glasses and never made it back to the table with our drink refills.  Another feature of the Applebee's menu are the bottomless fries...well good luck with that one!  My burger came with their infamous bottomless fries; I was disappointed to see that there was a few cold, old and overcooked fries served with the burger and when I asked for the fries to be replaced with hot, fresh fries the waitress was none too happy!  Needless to say, neither was I!"
Jon C.,"Buda, TX",56,1,,5.0,7/23/2014,We visited the restaurant recently and it was so much better than about a year ago. I was surprised to see new servers. Our waitress was spectacular. We had drinks from the bar and we both had the chicken freshcado. It was great very original flavor. As we were finishing our meal the manager stopped by and was very nice when he asked if everything was great. I will definately be back to this appplebees as it has come along way.
Jenn N.,"Austin, TX",30,13,12,1.0,11/14/2013,"There should be a zero star rating!!  I am a long time car side to go customer and cannot believe the terrible service I received.  I pulled up to the car side to go at the time I was told (6:45p) I could see the waiters walking by and looking at me. After 15 minutes of waiting I called in and told the person I was waiting and that no one had come out. I was told they were bagging the food and would be right out. I was among 4 other people outside waiting. I waited another 5 minutes and called again. Chris on the phone told me I could just walk inside. I said that is not the point of car side to go. I asked to speak to the manager and was put on hold. After another 3 minutes on hold and no one walking outside I hung up and drove away, I called again and asked for the manager. Chris asked me why I needed to speak with the manager and I said I was not happy with the car side to go, he put me on hold again and I waited for 15 minutes. I hung up and called again. Ivan answered and said we are busy you will have to wait.  He then HUNG UP ON ME!!!!!!  I can't believe this!!! I don't care how busy the restaurant is, that is just unprofessional. My old store was always polite, on time, and professional.  After moving to Kyle I was hoping to get the same service as I did in Austin. I will never visit this store again. I am shocked and outraged that this type of customer service.  I thought about calling back to the store and speaking to the manager again, but with employees like that, whats the manager going to be like.  I am so disappointed that I have filed a complaint with the corporate office.  anything short of a direct apology is a waste."
