Tonya H.,"LaGrange, GA",10,1,,2.0,7/25/2017,we went the other day on a slower night 4 to 6 tables had not been cleared until we were about to leave.  we ordered food and alchohol. my husband's beer came out  along with our food and my margarita never got mixed even after she asked the manager to make it. I had to have her take it off because of the failure of the bartender and or management for not making it
Vijay B.,"Marietta, GA",49,1,,1.0,12/31/2017,"Worst service and useless food.. this is such a shame of Applebees franchise. The food looked and tasted so bad.. half cooked , I felt like giving their food back and say dare u eat this food."
Gary C.,"Columbus, GA",10,2,1,1.0,12/19/2017,Awful service slow as hell.need to shut this place down.if you like cold food and hot drinks take yourself on down to Applebees Lagrange ga. Worst service this side of the Mississippi.you get better service at burger king next door .
Gigi L.,"Boston, MA",1,14,,1.0,12/17/2017,"It took 45 mins to get some chicken tenders, fries anda thai salad. Food was incredibly salty, dry and cold! Horrible horrible place. They deserve 0 stars. Stay away"
Jamie I.,"Anchorage, AK",59,1,,1.0,11/26/2017,"All I can say is waffle house is real close by... we have had poor service in your past,  but today was the worst! Server had a horrible personality for the position, food took forever,  then came out cold and incorrect.  It took 20 minutes to get the check and drinks were never refilled without us asking and on one occasion hunting them down."
Brant D.,"La Grange, GA",122,47,5,1.0,11/20/2017,"The only restaurant where you can eat about whatever you want and you will lose weight , of course this is from the salmonella that I got after eating here. Was here on 11/19/2017 , one of the worst restaurants I have been in, was getting up to walk out when food came to table. Felt bad so we stayed , well shouldn't have done that since we were sick two hours later. Started with waiting 20 minutes to order drinks , another 20 to order food , waitress spilled tea on me , then didn't have what kids ordered , then I ordered they had to go check to see if they had that, when food was brought it was pathetic, kids Mac & cheese was plain noodles with shredded cheese drizzled on top, not even melted and some ranch dressing on the noodles ????? My BBQ tacos were disgusting and the meat while cooked was cold in the middle, where they just microwaved it .. will never be back here, I will drink Mexican tap water and eat street tacos in Tijuana before this .."
William L.,"Cartersville, GA",0,6,,1.0,12/20/2016,"Where to begin. 12-20-16 Arrived at 6 pm and the hostess has the personality of a walnut. Got seated. 610 server shows up. order steak potato and salad  Boss orders pork chop special. 620 drinks arrive. 640 ""Can I get my salad?"" 648 salad arrives but not with dressing I wanted. 7:05 we ask the walnut ""Can u check on our order?""  Walnut "" Kitchen is backed up""  Can I speak to Mgr? Walnut..""She's in Kitchen"" 710 Server. ""There's an issue with the Pork Chop, you want something else?"" Fine Bring me. burger? 725 left and Walnut said....Have a nice night!  Seriously? Chic fil a drive thru next door This place is pathetic!!!!"
Lisa L.,"La Grange, GA",52,7,18,5.0,4/12/2016,"I have been a regular here for a very long time, but I have to say over the last year this place has improved TREMENDOUSLY, from management, cooks, servers, host and bartenders.... Just the whole vibe, has changed, stop by and give Applebee's a shot, you won't be sorry.... I'm sure you will probably find me sitting at my regular spot at the bar, come in and let's chat, have some half priced  appetizers after 10pm and just enjoy the company...great friendly atmosphere!!! Hope to see you soon!!"
Samuel M.,"Coatesville, PA",0,17,1,1.0,8/6/2017,"If you have a large party DO NOT COME HERE We had a group of 11 and it took forever for everything and  it was alll messed up almost everyone's orders we got our entrees before our appetizers and and the entrees were cold one person ordered boneless wings and got 5 while another person did and got atleast 12 the waitress also told us "" I'll be sure to get those checks out "" but we didn't even get all our food and I ordered salsa a chips but she completely forgot about it kinda like another member of our party's food she completely forgot like not an appetizer the whole meal the sad part was they were nowhere close to busy compared to other Applebee's or any other restaurant and the bathrooms weren't well kept at all it was honestly a shame don't come here and avoid it I also read another review and found out people have gotten food poisoning so if you're looking for that I guess this is your place"
Taylor W.,"Forest City, NC",2,8,10,4.0,1/2/2016,"Four stars because of the unclean bathrooms and a small leak on the toilet. Our 2 waitresses were very kind and went out of her way to please my daddy, who wanted chicken parmesan which was unfortunately not on the menu. He ordered 2 children's chicken breasts with the cheese, the linguine noodles, sautéed jalapeños and lots of marinara sauce. Very complicated but they managed to do it. My mother ordered some sort of shrimp stir-fry with the green goddess wedge salad (I believe that's the name). Her food looked excellent. I ordered the steak and parmesan shrimp, without any cheese or scampi sauce. My steak was cooked as ordered and very good, no complaints here. My dad keeps telling our server how excellent his food was, how good and how thankful he was that they could put that together for him. We stop at this Apple Bees almost every year after our vacation. Always good people and a great time. We sat at the bar tonight so the service was excellent. My beverage didn't come close to halfway empty before it was refilled."
Kathy O.,"Rome, GA",0,2,,1.0,3/5/2017,"I really wanted to like this restaurant, but the service was really, really bad. Food came out promptly and tasted great, but service will keep me from visiting again."
Patrick D.,"LaGrange, GA",0,14,4,1.0,3/24/2017,The food is terrible! It is straight from the microwave! If you go just order an appetizer and a beer and go home! Staff is nice just always distracted and never remember what you told them. My least favorite restaurant in LaGrange!
Robert D.,"LaGrange, GA",16,1,1,5.0,4/19/2016,The menu is being redone with very good additions. The staff are very friendly . I sit at the bar as I'm always by myself and the service is always great and friendly.
Tyler M.,"Davison, MI",0,1,,1.0,1/21/2017,"Poor service, under cooked chicken, hard cheese for the pretzels.  You can find better food in Arby's dumpster."
Shannon B.,"Stockbridge, GA",0,12,1,1.0,12/30/2016,"Got gift cards to Applebee's, thought that was awesome... Wrong!!! Apparently they are very understaffed. We have been two times in the last two weeks. Tons of tables were empty! Both times we have been told by the manager that it would be a very long wait (45 minutes at least). She then explained both times that she has had staff call out sick? What to do with useless gift cards???"
LaToya S.,"La Grange, GA",49,69,32,3.0,3/23/2016,"Generously giving this place 3 stars because our server was very nice and attentive. A friend and I went here for lunch on a Monday and we were the first customers there. Not that I come to a restaurant for music but the sound system was loud and static-y and not the best sound when you are trying to relax and enjoy a meal. I got one of the pasta lunch specials with a salad and it was delicious and just the right portion for lunch. I wanted to end it with a brownie bite and ice cream. When the server brought it to the table it smelled like it was burnt. I broke the brownie in half and it was like a piece of charcoal inside. I just politely told the server about it  and asked her to take it off my bill, but I was disappointed. Overall not the best experience and it will be a while before I go here again."
Derrick B.,"Sevierville, TN",0,14,1,1.0,2/20/2017,"If you want decent service and food quality, go downtown. Do NOT go here. You think with all the negative reviews, why go?inthe back of your mind you think it's a chain restaurant with some reasonable oversight.. well, you'd be wrong.  The service is moderately tolerable. Order accuracy is non-existent, and the beer lines need a cleaning (like last month) order a seasonal Sam Adams and it smelled terrible with a finish much like the smell. Stupid me.. I occasionally come to town on business and take those I'm meeting with to lunch. We chose this place two weeks ago and I was very unimpressed. Just came into town and thought I'd grab something to go and it's close to the hotel. Shame on me and who ever the DM is in the region. With this low of a score, someone should camp out here until it's fixed or shut it down if anyone actually. The bar tender seemed more interested in ordering a whopper from next door and socializing rather than working."
Kevin K.,"Auburn, AL",3,33,10,1.0,12/1/2014,"Wow. So much for a quick lunch.  The story goes they had a problem in their kitchen but never bothered informing any of us. 45 minutes later we were ready to walk out and then they said there was an issue. Waited 5 more minutes for greasy somewhat cool food and incomplete orders.  Asked to see the manager, as did the table besides us, and nobody would come out. Gave us a coupon for a free order of cheese sticks instead (which definitely did not make up for the wait or food)   Would definitely NOT recommend this location."
Jonathan S.,"Morganton, NC",13,89,169,1.0,10/14/2014,"Mmm the #QuesadillaBurger served cold, on a dirty table by the waitress cleaning the blinds throwing more dust on my table. Followed by management taking a break at a nearby table. Well done @applebees."
Donna A.,"Atlanta, GA",20,52,,1.0,6/25/2015,I've never had a good experience here and have this restaurant on my boycott - the food has always taken forever to come to the table .. And the food has been way less than par.. I can only guess they need to retrain the manager and the cooks. Horrible !!!!!!
Nik P.,"Hiram, GA",50,135,78,2.0,5/3/2015,"I know it's late at night and Jennifer didn't want to be at work. She took our order like it was hurting to ask what we wanted to eat. I ordered my salad and she gave me grilled chicken instead of fried chicken. I didn't mind that my salad finally came out after my friends finished eating their dinner, I didn't mind that I didn't get a refill and my cup was bone dry. But I do want good customer service. Put a smile on your face, as a paying customer I want to feel welcomed. Not like I'm bothering you. In the end my salad was delicious. My friends food was cold she had steak and veggies, we ordered the green bean crispers and they were way over done."
Brian L.,"Gautier, MS",18,1,,1.0,5/17/2015,The food sucked a bottle beer is 4 dallors   two beers and my wife little lunch was 30 dallors I sent my food away didn't ask for nothing else it sucks
Kevin H.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,9,,1.0,10/20/2013,"One star ONLY because the door was unlocked and the lights were on. Same cannot be said for the help 40 minutes wait for a drink.  We were a 9 top but clueless would be an understatement for the staff. I would comment on the food, but since we have been here FOR OVER AN HOUR, I simply forgot what I ordered and have every confidence that it will be cold.. If you should see this place on the side of the road, lock your doors and disable your turn signals, and keep driving people - keep driving..."
Larry N.,"LaGrange, GA",43,23,42,1.0,5/5/2015,"Not sure how this franshise stays open except that most people don't check Urban Spoon or Yelp before stopping there.  They go based on the name, and never return because of the service, the lethargic and apathetic management, and not being served what you ordered.   Complaints to corporate get you a call from the manager eventually, who says ""sorry you had a bad experience, give us another chance!""  As you can tell by the reviews on Yelp, I am not alone in my assessment."
Karie H.,"Alpharetta, GA",87,319,321,1.0,3/11/2013,"I think a big part of this bad review was the location we happened to be in.  We walked in and the restaurant was half empty. We were told it would take a few min.. about10 min later we were seated and about 10 min later i snagged the hostess to let her know we  hadn't been noticed by the server yet.  She took the drink orders and then the server showed up. We placed the app and they came out fine.  Meanwhile 3 of the 4 of us were in need of refills. and those were hard to come by.   3 of our meals came out and about 8 min later the 4th persons came out.  I had ordered soup to come out first,  and she even came out to say that  it would be out shortly, but never came... and was on the bill as i came to find out (after we paid)  All in all we felt like we were a burden to the restaurant from the time we walked in to the time we left.. and I'm sorry... that's not customer service... You are a server to ...SERVE people. if you cant have a good attitude and even pretend to want to be there then get a new job... BOO Applebees in La Grange... Booo"
Lyn C.,"Newnan, GA",4,9,4,1.0,8/6/2015,"Worst food ever!!!! I ordered my steak medium well and it was burnt!!!!! The place was filled with flies and the manager said to me ""oh it's just that time of year and we can't get rid of the flies."" If your looking for good food please pass right by this place."
Steve F.,"Decatur, AL",1,30,7,1.0,4/29/2014,This place totally sucks missed managed big time.. Food is the worst..really?? WTF would ever come back here other than homeless.....
Rick C.,"Roanoke, AL",0,1,,1.0,3/2/2014,We ate at this Applebies and waited for a table even though there were empty tables. We get seated and place our order. Then they bring our food out but the only order they  got right was my wife's. they take her order back along with ours. The they bring our food out again after ten minutes but my order was still wrong. They took the wrong border back. I waited another 10-15 minutes before they brought my correct order out. Also on the floor next to our table was a dirty steak knife.
Twiggy P.,"LaGrange, GA",0,1,,5.0,12/7/2014,"Great staff, food is awesome! Sorry most people don't give it a chance. The mood in the building is really relaxed and I love that. Hate stuck up restaurants and people."
Will B.,"Grayson, GA",27,5,,1.0,1/3/2014,"I usually love Applebee's but this one absolutely sucks! I usually eat at one when I'm traveling for work (frequently) as well as in my leisure time.  I typically receive a consistently fun experience with a great value for the buck. But tonight at this LaGrange GA location I had the worst experience I've ever had at an Applebee's and one of the worst dining experiences ever. When we sat down 10 minutes passed and no one said anything to us. I finally had to get up and ask the bartender who was assigned to our table. After they finally figured out they were out of the wine we wanted (the manager did come out and offer complimentary deserts for the inconvenience) we ordered. The food was slow, Dad's food was subpar but he suffered through it. My food was strait nasty. I informed my waitress and let her take the plate I barley touched away. She said she informed her manager, but the guy never comes to address the issue.  Instead of raising hell, I just told her to keep the comp desert (Dad did take his), paid the full price and resolved to NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN. We travel to LaGrange frequently spending at least 6 nights per month in a nearby hotel.  From now on we will be going to the Longhorn's next door. Good by and good riddance !"
