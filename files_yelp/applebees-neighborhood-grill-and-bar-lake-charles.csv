Kerry D.,"New Orleans, LA",348,323,23,1.0,11/17/2007,"I had the pleasure of eating here during while evacuating Hurricane Katrina after spending about 10 hours on I-10.  Lake Charles is usually a four hour drive from New Orleans, but you put 4 million on one Interstate and you're not going to move.....at all.  Apparently every restaurant closes early on Saturday nights in this bustling metropolis, leaving one option.....my favorite place of all.   I don't think anyone hates Applebee's as much as me.  Everything they serve here is gosh-darn awful.  I would rather eat a microwavable meal at a mini-mart than eat here (but they were all closed).   My desperate attempt to eat healthy proved unsuccessful.  I scoured the menu in hopes of finding something healthy (read: non-deep-fried).  I ordered a shrimp dish and the shrimp were grey on the plate....completely under-cooked.   I think the stress of the impending doom/storm finally hit my last nerve and I burst into tears.  I asked the waiter if I could order something else and he said NO.   I think I was more upset to find there was an Olive Garden a mere 5 minutes away...just around the bend."
