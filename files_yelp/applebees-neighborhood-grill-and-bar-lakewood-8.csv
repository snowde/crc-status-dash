Joey R.,"Lakewood, CO",5,41,,4.0,8/4/2017,"Server was quick to refill drinks, friendly and the food was very good."
Lilly A.,"Denver, CO",0,20,21,1.0,10/18/2017,"This place is the worst! I went in to have dinner with a friend who loves this place, reason why i ended up there! I was a server for many years so I always try to take the servers side and understand how frustrating it can be at times, but this bartender/server was absolutely rude and made my night HORRIBLE! Worst experience! Lets begin with the fact that I ordered a margarita at the beginning of my dinner, as did the rest of the girls in my table. They all got their and I also asked for a water so he brings my water, no worries right he will bring my margarita, which I was not too worried about. But then he brings our food, at this point I don't want my margarita anymore so I don't bring it up, assuming he forgot about it....We are enjoying dinner, and none of us have any water or any drinks, we were trying to order a side of fries but he never came to check on us.... finally my husband asks if we can have water. He bring that as well as the bill (15 minutes later) we are about to pay and guess who has a margarita in her bill? THIS GIRL DOES!!! So my husband let's him know ""Hi I got charged for a margarita but you never brought it, if you could just please remove it""  the server then turns and looks at the table and says ""they all got their drinks who didn't get one?"" so i look at him and tell him its me he goes to his computer with an attitude and deletes it! DOESN'T EVEN APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BRINGING THE MARGARITA OR ANYTHING!!! He actually tried to tell another customer i was just trying to get it for free! IT WAS 1 MARGARITA I WOULD PAY FOR IT IF I GOT IT!!!!!!! NO APOLOGIES JUST RUDE RUDE RUDE!!"
Robin W.,"Denver, CO",0,42,3,1.0,12/21/2017,"Omg. Idiot server, Matt, says their free Wi-Fi sucks when we ask to use it. Says he doesn't play the tabletop games so can't turn it on. Brings hot chocolate with no whipped cream for a kid. He says he doesn't like whipped cream so he didn't put it on. I asked for grilled shrimp and got fried shrimp. Matt wanted to argue. Had to get manager and a new server! Not recommended..."
Baseemah S.,"Long Beach, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/26/2017,"I was at this location this past Sunday. I ordered a refill on my coffee. I am used to places just bringing me out a large canister so that I can pour my own coffee, since it's free refills. However, the waiter brought me out a whole new glass of coffee. BUT, there was a red lipstick print on the glass. Ugggh! I am so surprised she didn't see the prints, it was so obvious! (Or, maybe they were her prints!) When I pointed out the issue to her, she wanted to bring me another glass. I said No, bring me the canister so that I can pour my own. She appeared to have an attitude with this request.  My regret is I did not get the manager involved, but I have noticed the service has dissipated at that location over the last few months, as there was one distinct manager who used to walk around a lot and being very visible. I do not see him anymore, and that is when I noticed the drop in the quality of the serve.  I will never go there again."
Carl B.,"Southwest, Denver, CO",2,8,1,1.0,11/26/2017,"2 servers we're having a conversation with two of the customers who are obviously intoxicated and dropping the F-bomb and S bombs everywhere they could, and these two employees seem to encourage it. I don't come to a restaurant to listen to foul mouths and loud people or employees who don't know how to do their job. I will never come back to this Applebee's again.this is Sunday at 6:30 pm."
April S.,"Denver, CO",33,1,,1.0,7/24/2017,Car side @ this Applebees is a joke. I know now that it is a waste of time to order car side at this Applebees.  I order online to avoid the wait but unfortunately was stuck waiting outside in the heat. I had to call after waiting 15 minutes for them to even realize I was there. Then was left on a silent hold for 4 minutes. Nobody came on the line. A gentleman came out only to go to car that pulled in after me next to me with her order. Told me  he would  be back shortly with my order. Seriously disappointed in the service provider. My order was not ready at 545 like pick up stated on email. It was not available until 612.  To top it off my order was not correct. Not only was order late but it was wrong.
Kim L.,"Denver, CO",5,3,90,5.0,10/13/2016,Great staff!! Especially Julia and the manager went out of their way for us( I'm vegan). Thank you for excellent customer service!!
Shin M.,"Denver, CO",50,707,21,2.0,2/14/2016,"My hubby and I came here primarily to use up a gift card from a relative that we have been holding on to for years. We came on a friday night around 6pm and were seated right away. The restaurant was moderately crowded. Our server was ok. We started with sweet potato fries which came with 3 different types of dip. One was a BBQ (meh), maple cream cheese (not bad, super sweet though), and the garlic aioli (YUM!!!). I ordered the quesadilla burger with fries. The burger was OK... not much flavor. I did not enjoy the fries, as they were crunchy and needed to be seasoned more. My hubby got the enchiladas and said it was ok. We ended with the churro s'mores. It was creative and pretty good! So the beginning and end were good but the main dishes in between not so much."
Hida A.,"Brighton, CO",0,4,1,1.0,3/7/2017,"This is the worst location I have ever been to! Multiple times I have tried this location and have received nothing but horrible service. The last time I ordered, I was charged multiple times, never received silverware for my STEAK and never even apologized to for the inconvenience. Horrible horrible service!! I will never ever eat at Applebee's again and the managers were not helpful at all when it came to helping figure out how to figure out my refund for my money."
Ashley B.,"Arvada, CO",0,22,,1.0,5/21/2015,"I want to be honest, I was not thrilled when I found out Applebee's had been selected as the place where my family was dining for the evening, not a fan. We walk in and were seated promptly and immediately acknowledged by our waitress.  I couldn't help but notice the table behind us was complaining to the manager about their overcooked steak. I let it slide, after all, it is possible the steak was cooked to order and the customer was being picky. After we ordered drinks and an appetizer, I noticed yet another customer complaining about their food being under-cooked. At this point it was a red flag and we should of left after the appetizer but we stayed and ordered food.  I had the Thai shrimp salad and my mom and dad had hamburgers, which they ordered ""well done"" with no pink. My salad was fine, nothing mind blowing but not disgusting. The burgers were not fine. My dad's hamburger was grossly under-cooked, the entire middle was pink and bloody, my mom's was cooked a little more but still not as ordered. I know that the cooking temperature of meat is largely based upon preference but under-cooking meat to the extent it was is a food safety issue.  We asked for the manager, who was busy hearing yet another complaint regarding the improper cooking of another customer's food. His apology was totally apathetic and he seemed offended that my father declined a new burger. They had been under/over cooking food all night and he was done. He then said he would take the burger off our ticket, but when the bill came, only a portion of the burger was taken off.  Already ""over it"" we paid and left. It was clear that there was an issue in the kitchen and it doesn't seem like an unusual occurrence based on other reviews. If you are unable to properly cook a burger or steak, you should not be in the kitchen, that is how people get food-born illnesses.  Our server was friendly and we realize that she had no control over what happens in the kitchen, so she was left a generous tip regardless. While I'm never fully satisfied by Applebees, this was a new low. Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else, anywhere else really."
Mary S.,"Denver, CO",0,5,,1.0,5/24/2016,"Keely was our server and she was great. However, we could hear from our booth arguing in the kitchen (not necessarily from her, just the staff). The food was sub-par. A triple bacon burger? Two, maybe one longer slice cut in half, of bacon. Ordered it ""pink"", served well-done. The appetizer special is only half price because they give you half the portion. The stir fry was bland and dry. I pity the servers that work here who are forced to serve this. Lame chain restaurant who pocket money by poor quality food."
Joshua T.,"Lakewood, CO",116,238,255,4.0,10/15/2015,"Thrice have I visited this location, and though the service has generally been friendly and proficient, they could certainly use a shot in the arm wherein organization is concerned. Twice was I greeted in short order and seated appropriately to place a to-go order from the bar, at which point I had to wait for a server or bartender to get the message I was awaiting their assistance, and the third I was asked to wait next to a server station to one side of the restaurant for the ""carside to-go"" guy. I explained that I had not placed an order yet (thus, the ""carside to-go"" guy would be of limited assistance) but the lady insisted that he would be able to best assist me, despite the fact the last two times I'd simply placed an order with a regular server and had no issues. Once he came out and greeted me, I asked if I could sit at the bar (like a customer) instead of standing in the corner (like a child on time-out). He pulled up a chair and got me a menu, and took good care of me from then on. Zakery K is his name, and I'll probably just ask for him in the future and sit down at the bar to cut out the middleman of standing in the corner like a dunce. Food has been good, and I'll be back; hopefully, however, they'll get this whole ""organized, procedural service"" thing nailed down ere my next visit occurs."
Roger M.,"Golden, CO",5,1,,2.0,6/14/2016,"Dinner time, stopped by my neighborhood Applebees, looking forward to the usual great experience. Tonight only half of this experience proved to be acceptable. First the service was great, met at the door and was promptly seated after accommodations were made for my power wheelchair. Server appeared quickly with menus and all was good. Moments later drinks arrived and our order was placed. The food arrived at an appropriate time, wood fired steaks----sounds good,NOT. While the steaks were prepared one rare and one medium correctly they were so tough and stringy they were nearly uncuttable. In addition the baked potato was not warm enough to melt either the butter or shredded cheese. Of course the potato was hard. The broccoli florets were well prepared."
Gabriel S.,"Denver, CO",12,117,150,3.0,6/16/2015,"Mediocre service as usual. Waitress was okay. Food was alright. Was not acknowledged when leaving. Came to eat, left satisfied. Nothing spectacular about this experience."
Tristan T.,"Arvada, CO",80,101,36,1.0,2/12/2015,"I'm giving this location in particular a bad review. I will continue to dine at other location's but this one left me extremely disappointed with my last visit. I ordered a trio and received a raw chicken wing. I returned the plate to the server and asked that she take them away. She inquired if I wanted another plate of them or something else. I specified my reasoning for the return and I was not offered an apology, or a discount to my bill. Completely disgusted with that poor service, I, nor my friend dining with me will not be returning to this location."
Jerdie B.,"Lakewood, CO",15,11,4,3.0,3/18/2016,"Stopped by the Applebees in Lakewood after work on a Friday with some friends to have dinner, we sat at a bar table and enjoyed our burgers and drinks.  The burgers were yummy and he drinks were refreshing, the servers were attentive and the place was clean.  We watched a little March Madness and had a good visit.  Nothing exciting but pretty much exactly what I was expecting.  I will say my burger the brunch burger was cooked perfectly and it was delicious."
James V.,"Denver, CO",0,160,445,1.0,10/4/2014,Worst service ever. Took 10 min before we got knowledge. Had to ask the host about our server.   we were able to order appetizers came out and somewhat of a timely manner 20 minutes before sunset receive their food finish the food and we still have not gotten our food waitress came up at the time we decided we have enough demanded to speak to the manager the manager then explained that she was in the kitchen cooking the food and this is all 30 minutes after we initially sat down this used to be our way to my favourite locations and we will not be coming back
Demitri R.,"Lynnwood, WA",324,1594,806,4.0,9/7/2013,Not sure why people complain about the customer service it was great. My server greeted me and continued to check up on me while I glanced at the menu. My drink never hit the south end of the levy. I seen the managers come out and handle it if someone did have a issue.  Went with the shrimp and fries and coleslaw. For the price it came with a lot of shrimp and was fried to a nice golden brown. The fries were what you would expect. The coleslaw was creamy and not the vinegar based stuff.  They changed the name from the Molten Lava Cake to the Triple Chocolate Meltdown but its still a Lava Cake and delicious packed with alot of chocolate and comes out hot. Next time ill ask for another scoop of ice cream.  When the bill came and I was ready to leave she asked if I wanted a Togo cup for my sweet raspberry tea.  No complaints on this visit.
Tim n.,"Hauppauge, NY",0,8,,2.0,9/20/2016,"Sitting are bar, tap blew out soaking me. No one told the manager anything but the Mick Ultra was out while the fact I was soaked on beer. All manager could say when I approached him was Sorry"
Lauren W.,"Newport Beach, CA",179,17,2,1.0,9/6/2015,"As an Applebee's lover, I came in tonight to eat and will never be returning again. We walked in and waited a good 15-20 mins to be seated while the hostess walked around clueless making eye contact with us many times. There were many seats available so seating was not an issue, and multiple workers made eye contact with us. We had to walk out of the restaurant as it was getting late and not a single person cared we were there at all!!!! Never returning to eat at Applebee's."
Nicole L.,"Wake Forest, NC",0,7,,5.0,10/9/2014,"Loved heading there for a meal with our kids, Server talked to our 1 & 3 year old which we appreciate because most servers say hi and then ignore them.  Always had a excellent experience and truly appreciate a manager (a veteran) taking the time to come and talking to my husband (also a veteran) and shake his hand."
Brian S.,"Denver, CO",53,1,,1.0,5/19/2016,"Horrible service took forever for our food to come out and I understand they did have a little bit of a rush going on, however when 3-4 tables seated after you receive their food it gets a little irritating.. and when it did arrive it was cold and looked to have been sitting in the window under the heat lamps, came here to celebrate a graduation and ended up leaving frustrated. Never coming back, they fell off big time. I give them no stars but I have to pick one so that's why there is a star. I should get a star for even paying for the food."
Debra N.,"Denver, CO",3,3,,1.0,6/26/2016,"Saturday night hubby and I decided to jet down the street to Applebee's and get a bite for dinner. Greeted at the door and sat quickly. Host was awesome gave us menus and silverware.  That was the last we were to see of good service though. Waited 15-20 min for server to show up. We ordered 2 strawberry daiquiri and informed waitress we were ready to order food as well  (had plenty of decision time waiting for her to come take drink order) she apologized said she figured we would be ready had been taking large (6 people ) order and knew we were waiting. The table behind us had finished eating while we were ordering and left. Ordered appetizer platter ( chicken wonton tacos, steak quesadilla, beer brew pretzels and steak and black bean soup) . The food arrived amazingly fast but we hadn't gotten drinks yet. Waitress went to check on them. While waiting observed large table of 6 being served ( and something was wrong ). Waitress went to correct their order. Brought us our daiquiri (yeah). Food was amazing kudos to the cooks!! Daiquiri tasted like a virgin quite disappointing. While eating observed waitress and only can presume manager take food to other table and fix their issues. Finished our food no one checked with us to see how things were. Waiting for bill decided to pay on automated machine at table, but check had never been submitted by waitress so couldn't. Hit call server button on machine. After watching staff amble around restaurant(about 15mins)  manager came over said he noticed light on and could he help us. We asked for boxes and check. He and waitress returned with both. Paid . Did I mention that the whole time we were there table behind us was never bussed. Morale of the story food was great service quite lacking  (now understand why they were so empty on a Saturday night."
Deejay S.,"Denver, CO",240,27,11,3.0,10/14/2014,Went here last night. Staff was friendly and great but food was soo greasy . My grilled clubhouse was soaked in butter . Pasta had puddles of butter . It was really gross.
Ryan H.,"Lakewood, CO",91,113,22,1.0,6/22/2014,Went here once to get some to-go drinks because they were close. My typical crappy Applebee's experience happened at even this one. The bartender was no where in sight for 5 minutes. When he finally showed up he seemed confused of my request. The went to the back to get us two small like 6oz kids cups for the lemonade that I ordered and then charged us full price. Most Applebee's give you like at least a 16oz or whatever size cup they us. Not to mention the place was pretty dirty for 3pm in the afternoon. I highly doubt I'll be returning due to the lack of disappointment of Applebee's every time I try to go. Go to Chili's or Yardhouse down the street a out a mile west and save yourself the disappointment for same priced food and drinks.
bob h.,"Denver, CO",0,46,,1.0,4/25/2015,"Unless they got someone new in the kitchen,OMG.  How can you screw up a cheeseburger and fries? Run , Forest,Run!"
Ryo X.,"Yorktown, VA",0,21,,4.0,7/23/2012,"2 for $20, that is how the ad says. A good place for dinner when we do not want to cook. I like the fried cheese sticks."
Matthew Y.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,3,3,2.0,12/16/2014,The service was ok.  My Caesar salad was warm like it had sitting under a heat lamp. I hope it was or the cooler needs checked.  My steak was ok.  I have had better Applebees for sure.
Leza F.,"Fleetwood, PA",93,53,19,4.0,3/13/2012,"Our family really enjoys this Applebee's!!  The server we end up with remembers us and our kids every time we come in (a few times a year).  I really love that!! Food is always good, we never have any problems with service here!"
Aaron R.,"Denver, CO",0,8,1,1.0,12/20/2015,"Don't waste your time and money here, just drive up to chillis where they have 160% better customer service. On 12.19.15 around 4pm My friends and I went out to get some drinks after doing some Christmas shopping. We sat at a table next to the bar after waiting 15 minutes and not having anyone come assist us. Finally the waiter, Devon or something like that came to give us menus. He asked if we wanted water, lemonade or a pepsi but no Margaritas or drinks. He gave us attitude when we asked about the happy hour details and any new drinks they had going on. He told us he ""didn't have the details and didn't know where to find them so we were out of luck"". Our waiter was extremely rude. Not only did he not take our order correctly but he kept walking away as we were still ordering... He never brought our second order of drinks that we asked for and never came back for us to order food. We found a flyer on a table next to us advertising that ""if they didn't offer us a Perfect Margarita then it was on them."" So when the manager came by we brought it to her attention. She took down the order for 3 Perfect margaritas but we only received 2. Then our waiter came by to try and argue with us that he had offered the margarita so he was going to charge us for them and not get the third. We asked for the manager and she told us she wouldn't charge but would not bring out the third margarita. This was the most sorry ass restaurant I have ever had the misfortune of entering. Don't bother going in there, even McDonald's has better customer service."
Clea C.,"Golden, CO",4,49,,1.0,10/13/2009,"Just don't eat here.  I ate here a few times, and the last, and final time was when I found visible, large chunks of dirt on my carrot sticks.  When I called it to the attention of the bartender and the waitstaff, I was told, ""So what?""  YUCK!   I paid for my beer and left."
Ashley H.,"Denver, CO",26,265,8,3.0,3/14/2012,Late night drinks for the win. Alright apps and a drink special. If it's 9pm on a Wednesday here your place.
K M.,"Lakewood, CO",0,3,,2.0,7/25/2013,"The food is good but the service is bad. Halfway through our meal we thought our server went on lunch break because we saw her eating a basket of chips at a table across the restaurant. After getting fed up with empty drinking glasses and no dipping sauce, I walked to the manager and asked if we can get a waitress who isn't on lunch. He chucked and said she wasn't on her lunch break... Evidently they don't care about their customers."
Tess T.,"Golden, CO",7,8,,5.0,3/19/2012,This is my favorite Applebee's location.  I love the chicken quesadilla's. Saturday Night Karaoke is always a fun and good time. My friends and I go almost every saturday. We love this Applebee's!!!!!!!  Cant go wrong here :)  Food is always good. The waitstaff and bartenders are awesome espically Logan and Dave!
Lisa P.,"Alexandria, VA",0,20,1,3.0,6/29/2013,"They've added guiness (in bottles) to their beer list (yay). Their ability to grill steaks to one's liking is poor. I ordered a sirloin rare and it came medium. My friends ordered: steak medium rare and steak medium. Yeah, they all came medium. At least there's consistency. My gripe is when the manager came to tell me that the marinade caused the ""meat to look darker but that it was actually cooked correctly"". I said no, it wasn't and that there's a big difference between rare and medium. They did comp the meal (good on them for that). One of my friends was surprised at this because this had happened to her the previous week and they didn't do a thing. Hit or miss, I guess. One last thing, the other unsettling item was when one of my friends asked for lemons and they arrived, dried up and served on a coaster..."
Melzie C.,"San Mateo, CA",139,219,150,4.0,7/18/2007,"Good food! Typical yummy Applebee's! I had my Birthday dinner here with my bf and it was typical, yummy, Applebee's food at a good price!"
Jeremy C.,"Lakewood, CO",64,155,52,4.0,3/5/2009,Went to Applebee's on Colfax in Lakewood today. Had the 9 ounce sirloin with a salad and baked potato food had very good flavor as far as chain restaurants go. Some very good service and really quick delivery. I had two waiters I assume one was in training because I didn't notice this in any other sections. Both were really good. My food was good and cooked as requested. I will likely end up going back to this location.
sydney s.,"Lakewood, CO",0,14,,3.0,11/13/2009,"3 stars for the food- 1 star for the service. i actually had a friend of mine get called a whore by a waitress there... and she was saying it to one of her tables! didnt even kno her, jus decided she was a whore. they all seem like they could care less what u want.. they jus want u to order the most expensive thing so they can get a higher tip. but, as for food, good selection, decent queso, appetizers galore. kinda like a low grade chilis."
