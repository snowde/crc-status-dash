Tishea D.,"Baltimore, MD",421,196,285,5.0,11/22/2017,So My service here was wonderful. I didn't Love the wait time but it was a Friday night so I guess that's what happens. My daughter and I needed to Kill sometime because my son was at a football game.  We were waited on by Christopher and he was such a gentleman. I could really tell that I stepped over the Baltimore line. I got a chance to experience that southern Hospitality. I let him know that I was kinda in a rush because I wasn't sure when I had to go and get my son. He was on it! He came to the table like every five minutes to check on me. I also wanted to try the $1 Margarita and he was swift with bringing that to the table as well.  When he bought the check he also brought some candy.. I guess for Halloween... But nonetheless he was an absolute sweetheart and I could not have asked for a better waiter.
Gail B.,"Washington, DC",380,1223,1839,3.0,8/28/2017,"We had friends from out of town visiting and they like Applebees. The menu had lunch specials that were $7.99 & $8.99. Hubby liked the steak. The French onion soup was not ""Capital Grille"" worthy but it was decent. The bill for seven people was around $80. Our server was nice, but not that attentive. There were only two other tables with customers. We could have been checked on more often.  We weren't in a hurry so the slower service wasn't impacting our schedule. Everyone enjoyed their entrees."
Faith P.,"Washington, DC",291,52,8,4.0,8/10/2017,"Ok, I see hit or miss reviews. So let's discuss this in categories.  For starters, I am a regular at this location due to the service of the bartender who goes by the name of Stephanie. Her specialty strawberry cocktail is definitely a seller at this place for the regulars. It has multiple liquors similar to a long island. She has me coming back to this place. She was very friendly and bubbly when I first met her. It has been a few times when I have came and Stephanie was not there and other people was behind the bar, my experience was OK. So let's talk about why this place can be hit or miss.  Service- Service is usually good depending on 'who you have' to be honest just like any place. Service here is usually nice. The manger Ron is usually walking around checking on guests. 8/10  Atmosphere- Usually a good 'home feeling' type of atmosphere. A bunch of TV's to watch if you ever come alone.  8.5/ 10 Cleanliness- 8/10. Bathroom can get a little unsanitary due to female customers being TRIFLING. But, I don't know apple bees cleaning schedule as far as how often these bathrooms get cleaned..lol. I always sit at the bar and the bar is usually clean. Stephanie and Mo' always wipe down the bar take away dirty dishes, drinks etc. 'Regulars' - Has their days when they can be rowdy. They sometimes have inappropriate conversations at the bar. But I'm used to it, they don't bother me and I don't bother them. They come for good drinks, BUT who wouldn't though? From the perspective of new comers being around the bar by the regulars can come off as a TURNOFF. I honestly, feel like if you cant handle inappropriate conversations at a bar where drinks are served maybe you should drink at home.  5/10 Servers- I don't really sit at the tables to eat but when I have, I was accommodated by Tona and Tijuan before. Both were great, very attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and drinks.  10/10 for these two servers.  Overall, Try it out. See for yourself."
Diandra G.,"Bladensburg, MD",0,4,7,4.0,12/5/2017,I've been here twice in the last month. Service is great and so is the food. I'm always seated promptly regardless of how busy it is. I received my drink and app quickly too.
Dominique B.,"Washington, DC",52,40,8,1.0,10/13/2017,Whoop whoop! Always. A good time at happy hour but why they short staff tonight. Drinks not flowing like they should .it's Friday!!!:(. Ownership tryna cut down on overhead? Why the suburbs always like this.
Taiwo S.,"Wheaton-Glenmont, MD",202,9,2,1.0,10/18/2017,THIS PLACE IS DISGUSTING AND HAS ROACHES!  came here for paint night that they do on Wednesdays. Sat at a booth and out crawled a roach across the table. I will NEVER come here again.
Mia F.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",17,20,1,4.0,7/25/2017,"Well out with family and the experience was fairly decent as it relates to the food. I order Feista Chicken and was not happy.. it was all over cooked.My mother in law order lime chicken from the Lighter Fare menu... hers tasted amazing. Babes order a steak salad, it was also tasty."
Dani L.,"Washington, DC",0,22,15,3.0,9/24/2017,Service was quick and polite. The food could use seasoning and flavor. Generic standard casual dining food. Happy hour is stellar with $3/$4 drink options so this is probably the place for happy hour and appetizers. Not dinner or lunch.
Abigail H.,"Washington, DC",155,32,27,5.0,12/19/2016,"Came here for a beer before the Redskins game at FedEx Field and I have to say I was surprisingly impressed! The facility was clean and the staff were very friendly. The service for beers and bar snacks was incredibly fast. The highlight was the automated tablet ordering system that is installed at every table which allows you to order food and pay your bill at any time with the touch of a button. The tablet also features trivia games which you can play at your table. I know it seems weird to give this place 5 stars, but within the casual chain restaurant category, this Applebee's really stood out from the crowd!"
Dee S.,"Brentwood, MD",29,46,18,3.0,4/24/2017,"The food is good, however I always sit at the bar and get instantly annoyed by the ""regulars"". The conversations between the bartenders and the regulars blow my mind. The amount of profanity I hear while trying to enjoy a drink is crazy. The staff is vey nice but I think I'll start to go to the College Park location from now on."
Catherine J.,"Bowie, MD",0,3,,1.0,3/30/2017,"This place is horrible!  Went there with my daughter on a Friday afternoon.  Wanted to get a Burger.  Waited to be seated, however, while waiting, I looked down at the floor and the carpet was filthy and tables dirty.  Made me sick looking at the dirty carpet. Decided not to eat in this dirty place.  Keep your Resturant clean!"
Derick E.,"Hyattsville, MD",110,6,4,1.0,1/16/2017,"So today my mother-in-law decided to take us to Apple Bees for dinner to discuss me and my fiancé future arrangements,  let's just say that we did not finish our dinner or accomplish anything do to cold food  under cooked steaks,  and poor service!!!!!! I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy!!!!"
Biohazard D.,"Capitol Heights, MD",28,38,246,1.0,5/7/2016,"Don't waste your time with this location.  After I got off from work on Friday, I didn't feel like cooking so I decided that we could eat out. Now normally we would hit up Friday's or Outback but this time, everyone else wanted to try something new so we went to the Applebee's in Largo. Now I'm thinking its Friday, so I'm expecting a wait but it was empty. That should have been the first sign. There is no way this place should have been empty at 740-8ish on a Friday.  We go in and get seated immediately. My son is immediately excited because of the games at the table so I'm pleased with that. We were sitting in a section where it was five other tables that were full. Two of those tables was full, one was waiting for a check and the other two were waiting for drinks and apps. Now there's only one server in this section.  I know she saw when the hostess sat is down because I looked her dead in her face when she came to get the check from the one guy who was leaving. It took her 20 whole mins from the time we sat down to even acknowledge that we were there!! So now I'm pissed and ready to walk out of there and my family is like no, let's eat here, maybe she's new.  Okay fine. So then she finally comes over and says oh I know your hungry so let's get started with the drink. There no hi no welcome no apology so I'm really really angry at this point. You have me waiting and you have the nerve to have an attitude now?? Oh yeah I'm definitely pissed. My boyfriend orders the meals because I don't want to talk cause he knows Ima fly off the handle.  I expect at least some type of customer service considering I'm about to give you my money. So she takes the drinks and the orders and goes to the next table. Fifteen mins pass before we even get the drinks. I'm so angry that even my son is saying this was a bad idea. The drinks come and they were good. The strawberry lemonade made me calm down a bit until the food came.  Low and behold, she got a real funky attitude now cause she just sats the plates down and walk off. Oh I'm ready to get the manager at this point cause this is down right piss poor service. My boyfriend is like calm down, we got the food so just eat so we can go and never come back. Okay fine. I agree and look down at my food.  He had literally like big chunks of roasted veggies like they just cut it in half and threw it on the plate. Imagine cutting a pepper in half and just putting one half on a plate. My steak was sooooo small that I literally could put the whole steak in my mouth. My son was content with his food tho. So I got the waitress attention after she kept side eyeing and dodging my table as walked by. I complained about the food and the lack of cheese and butter and dressing for my baked potato to which she never addressed after I complained about the food. I was immediately done so we just paid and left. And I did not leave her a tip.  I will never visit this establishment again. Poor service. Poor food. I should have read the Yelp reviews first, I read the Yelp reviews after smh...what a maroon!!"
Josephine G.,"Laurel, MD",53,55,45,2.0,6/4/2016,They still need to remodel my food was wrong so they fixed it our service was nice drink were ok I think that so of places just do what they want to and if you don't hold them accountable for their actions they do what they want.
Jose A.,"Bowie, MD",0,5,,1.0,11/6/2016,"They are the worst, hope not to have Octavio or Sandee as bartenders. Rude and they think that they are doing you a favor"
Jay H.,"Greater Landover, MD",93,57,83,3.0,4/22/2016,While this isn't the best Applebee's it certainly isn't the worst.  I mainly come here to get 1/2 off appetizers or when applebees sends me an email for a promotional offer.  I live nearby so it's very convenient.  SOME of the bartenders are on point while others are barely mediocre.  I find the true entertainment in the patrons that are often there.  You get some true characters.  The food is hit or miss.  IF you complain about the food when it's a miss they usually correct it no problem.
Mark F.,"Hyattsville, MD",75,102,75,3.0,8/22/2015,"This place is rather hit or miss--unfortunately it takes trial and error to know what's good and not. The bar won tons are just gross. We couldn't even finish them. The service is spotty depending on who you get. We ordered blue moons one time, and what we got was definitely not it. Turns out they had switched the line but did not inform the bartenders....  with that said: their burgers are decent, as is their wings, and that's usually what we go for. Monday's are $6.99 burger night and Wednesday are $5 wing nights.  Oh. And the shiracha  shrimp is pretty fantastic -- reminds me of the dynamite shrimp the used to have years ago.  If you go during a happy hour, or when something is discounted, it's more worth the trip."
Angela T.,"Alexandria, VA",2,7,,5.0,10/28/2016,I ordered the shrimp won ton and it was great. Light and satisfying. We also ordered desert. The Apple desert. It was really good as well. Service was A1
Shannon S.,"Fort Washington, MD",28,14,7,4.0,9/20/2016,If I could only rate the service I would have given Nijah a 4.5. But the food....that's something else. We started with drinks of course. My husband ordered a fireball whiskey lemonade and I ordered bourbon and berries. Our drinks were great once we figured out which drink was which. We asked the server that delivered our drink ( she wasn't our server) and she had no idea. We pulled another server who was behind the bar and he let us know which drink was which. Our appetizer was boneless bbq wings. They were great. Served hot and in a timely manner. I order a 7oz steak with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables. The steak was a weird color and wasn't cooked the way I asked. It tasted like rubber and was very chewy.  The mashed potatoes tasted like it had been heated and reheated and heated and reheated and then they added water. Yeah. I asked if I could order something else. I did. I ordered the grilled chicken penne. It was ok. The sauce tasted like melted mayo and cheese. The service was better than the food which is why I gave 4 stars.
Hair C.,"Hyattsville, MD",679,10,36,1.0,10/15/2015,"This place just must have Bad Luck! French Onion soup came out with a very Hard surface.What was that!! Then the manager said it was a Crouton!! Are u serious! I must have ""Stupid"" written on my head! Will NEVER return to this place again! Bye-bye!!"
Richard W.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",121,71,89,1.0,9/2/2015,"If I could give this place negative stars, I would. This location is an absolute joke. Based on my last visit, I can't give you a review of the food, because my order was never taken. Hell, I couldn't tell you how the water tastes because I was never asked what I wanted to drink. Walked in there with my fiance and sat in the bar area. Waited 10 minutes for someone to come and wipe our table down. The server said she would be back with silverware. I then watched her disappear to the kitchen, come back out, and wipe down other tables. Thought that was strange.  After waiting an additional 10 minutes, we just decide to go sit at the bar. Wait at the bar for a couple minutes, then the bartender comes up to us and wipes down the bar area and walks away. Doesn't ask what we want to drink or if we want to look at menus. He goes to the kitchen too. We wait for him to come out, which he does, 10 minutes later, then goes back into the kitchen. At that point, we realized that we were stupid for thinking we'll get something to eat and drink at a restaurant. I could have applied for Applebee's franchise, interviewed staff, planned a grand opening, and get food from there in a shorter amount of time. Unacceptably poor service. Will never go back there again. If you want to eat food and get something to drink, don't go to this location. Must not want anyone to dirty up the tables they spend all day wiping down."
Virginia Horse F.,"Charlottesville, VA",764,13,,1.0,8/25/2015,Filthy!....And on a Thursday night. Carpets are old & disgusting. Toilets were gross and unattended. The back bar is a mess.  Then take a look at the ac vents above your head BEFORE you eat! They are blackkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk! Shut this shit hole down!
Nesha H.,"Joint Base Andrews, MD",0,12,3,5.0,5/13/2016,"My fiancé and I were hesitant to come here after what others have told us, but were very happy we did! Came in after 9pm on a Friday to a friendly hostess and attentive server. Better sweet potato fries than DC restaurants. Food was excellent for above chain restaurant standards, the cook definitely made an effort. We will be coming back!"
Charles K.,"Largo, MD",130,130,33,4.0,6/1/2015,"This review is only for the to-go services... When it's getting late in this part of town, you do not have too many choices of places to eat.  In this shopping center you have McDonald's, Taco Bell, and Applebee's.  With these choices Applee's becomes the place you convince yourself to eat.   The best thing about this location is that you order from a to-go counter (similar to BWW).  It normally takes about 15 minutes and you are on your way.  I always check my food before I leave, but so far my order has always been correct (knock on wood)."
Jeannette W.,"Bowie, MD",38,1,,1.0,5/22/2016,"Poor Customer Service. My first time and last. Food okay. OMG! Who does this - when cleaning the table with a wet rag, she wrung the water from  the towel onto the floor, she had no bucket."
Travis S.,"Washington, DC",2209,159,100,2.0,6/25/2014,"I don't really eat at chain restaurants however, I was celebrating a born day with colleagues. The establishment was filled with the happy hour crew. I don't think rap music with curse words are appropriate for restaurant settings.  We order food, the service was slow to the point that the waitress forgot the birthday person meal.she did comp the meal though. I ordered the 2 for 20, my chicken tenders were drenched in BBQ sauce and my colleagues were dry.  For main course I had a steak, mash potatoes loaded and broccoli.  The steak was tough if seemed as if I was eating a tire. The food was very bland overall.  I guess this is why people get drunk at hh and eat lol....."
Jeimy F.,"Capitol Heights, MD",77,98,77,1.0,5/11/2014,Pasta nasty. I would have done better boiling some pasta and buying a can of Alfredo sauce and 2 pieces of frozen chicken. Horrible service! I know better but was near by and very hungry. Yuck!!!!
Coast To Coast D.,"Marion, IL",11,29,,3.0,9/21/2014,With places like this it's always up to the crew !!!  There is one in every city and the food is usually the same or par  The service makes the place  The service makes the experience  And as for mine experience the bar tender / server at the time was on point  So my review of this chain was very expected and they played a birdie for the hole
Hope L.,"Fort Washington, MD",493,284,847,2.0,3/7/2014,Ugh! I just can not figure out why this Applebees can't seem to get it together!! I have been here on numerous occasions and am always disappointed by one thing or the other. Staff is just...moody Food is very hit or miss Enviroment/atomophere is typical Applebees.  It really sucks that I can't get into this place because they have cool things like a DJ on some nights and cheap prices for late-night grabs but I just can't deal with rude staff and wondering if they are going to mess up my food...again!
Alycia W.,"Washington, DC",70,51,23,1.0,8/7/2013,"If I could give this place no stars I would.  Last week my friend and I decided that we wanted to do happy hour at this location. I wasn't too thrilled when I first walked in. First thing, all the employees were huddled up towards the front discussing the latest episode of Love and Hip Hop. Strike one.   After being seated our server took  10 minutes to greet us. I mean the place was empty and one of the employees from the front could've at least taken our drink order. Once the server arrived. He was nice and friendly. So I felt a tad bit better. He took our drink orders and left us to talk. In the middle of our conversation. I saw a roach walk across our table. I immediately got up and moved to another table. Strike two.  I wanted to leave but my friend advised we should stay. She didn't want us to be the dramatic guest. So I let it be. I was still concerned but not as much.  I looked to the front were all the servers were hanging out but the clan disbursed. We let the server know and he told his manager. Once our food got there and we were seated at another table. Things simmered down. Towards the end of our meal my friend said ""don't freak out"". At first I wasn't sure what she was referring to until I looked down at the table. There was another roach! Strike Three  When our sever came back again we let him know of the second roach encounter.  he grabs a manager and she comes directly to us. Once we told her the problem she makes it seem as it was no big deal. ""There are no roaches in our kitchen, and they're usually brought in by guest...not saying that you brought them in but that's what happens"" Complete BS. She also said they were bringing in an exterminator. Another lie.  I will never eat here again. Very unacceptable..poor management."
Donnell B.,"Washington, DC",12,13,,2.0,3/9/2015,"The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because of the long islands Ice Teas. Although this place is close to my home, this Applebee's is always my LAST result. After sending 3 appetizers back, then two entrees because it wasnt the right order I was done. This place is always a problem. I would not recommend this Applebees."
Kiara S.,"Bowie, MD",1,9,,1.0,3/22/2013,"***Note: It makes me really sad to post such a negative review because this used to be a REALLY nice Applebee's. So nice that when my friends and I graduated high school back in '02, our families took us all out to dinner here. I also remember going here to celebrate getting my driver's liscense when I was 16 AND this is where I ate dinner on my first, official date.*** It took us almost three hours for a party of four on a Friday night to get food. Now keep in mind, the place was by NO MEANS packed. If they have 30 tables, I'd say 7 were filled with small parties like ours. The bar only had a hand full of people.  I don't feel they were understaffed because there were several waitresses hanging around the front laughing and saying mean things about some other server who apparently is a ""loser"" because she's in her late 20s, lives at home with her mom and can't drive a car.  Yes, real classy ladies...putting down a coworker right in front of the customers. I'm not saying you have to love everyone you work with, believe me I talk about people at work too, but I do it AWAY from our clients.  Anyhow, we had a very nice, though inattentive waitress. She seated us around 6:00 and came back almost 15 minutes later to take our DRINK order. After another 15 minutes she came back with our sodas and took our food orders. We each ordered simple stuff -- cheesestick appetizer and burger entree for hubby, chicken and rice for me, burger for my brother, and soup and a salad for my sister.  30 minutes later, the appetizer arrives and seeing us all sucking on ice cubes, the waitress days she'll bring back refills. After 10 minutes, my brother got tired of waiting, and finally flagged down another server and who bought us refills.  Another 40 minutes later and everyone's entree arrived except my sister. We all waited like 5 - 8 minutes and no sign of her soup and salad. We flagged down the hostess who apologized and said the kitchen was ""backed up"" (even though the people around us hadn't gotten their food either) and she'd bring out a salad.  10 more minutes and sis FINALLY gets her salad. It's supposed to be caesar but they've drowned it in so much salad dressing the leaves are kinda wilted and slimy. Sis is picking at her salad when our waitress arrives a minute later with another HUGE caesar salad that is just as gross.  15 more minutes go by and sister's onion soup FINALLY materializes. Everyone else is down eating, so we all order desert shooters so that we can at least kind of eat together.  Another 20 minutes later, the dessert shooters arrived. Everyone is in a foul mood by that time. The only redeeming factor is the waitress DID at least apologize and say that there was a problem in the kitchen...apparently the cooks weren't making food in the right order and they were backed up. (even though they had a full staff and a little bit of customers...hmm...)  After that experience, hubby has flat out refused to return. When we want burgers, we do McDonalds or Ruby Tuesdays.  *Note: I would not recommend this Applebee's for carryout either. After giving Applebee's a break between 2005 - 2011 due to poor dining experience and the fact the place kept smelling weird (like mildew and old cooking oil), I started getting the food to go since the 2 for $20 is such a great deal.  Hubby and I liked it at first.  The to-go service was decent...our food wasn't hot when we picked it up, but at least it was prepared within 20 minutes and almost always correct.  Nevermind the pressure to leave the person who takes your phone order a tip. (Until we complained to the manager, whoever took your phone order would always end the call with, ""That'll be $34.52 after tax and BEFORE tip."" And heaven help you if you didn't tip them...sucked teeth, rolled eyes, dirty looks..) Anyhow, something changed because the last three times hubby and I ordered and went to pick it up, the food wasn't ready and we had to wait another 10 - 20 minutes. Keep in mind they'll give us a time like, ""5:35"" so we wait and leave the house around 5:40, get there by 5:50 and we're told, ""Oh, your food ain't ready yet. They still cooking the chicken/hamburger/putting together the salad.""  So we'd stand in the little waiting area w/the other people waiting for the food."
Lydia S.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",0,1,,1.0,9/4/2015,"This place is the worst Applebee's in existence! The customer service is horrible and the management is no better. I used to frequent this place often until I noticed high turn over in the staff. The level of professionalism is slim to none under this new management! I went in for a drink, sat at the bar..the bartender never acknowledge I was sitting there for about 8 minutes. She was entertaining a group of her own friends that had come to her bar to get a hook up on drinks as one of the seemingly uneducated friends yelled loudly, as if that is ok for the bartendar to do. Once she did acknowledge me I told her I would rather just sit a one of the bar tables, she said ok hour server will be right over. I sat myself at one of the bar tables and proceeded to wait 10 minutes for a server to come take my order. Then she brought half my order and not my entire order when she came back. I ordered a lemonade and house margarita..she brought the margarita and not the lemonade. I waited another 15 minutes, she never comes back with the lemonade. I then go to the bar and ask the bartendar to see a manager. I go back to my table and watched the bartendar to see if she was going to get a manager or not. I waited another 10 minutes, still no manager. I then got up walked to then kitchen and yelled ""Is there a manager in this place or do y'all just run it like wild animals""?? Come to find out there was a group of individuals huddled up not far from the kitchen and one of them just happen to be the manager. Who by the way was within ear shot of the bartender. The bartender never told the manager I needed to see her! I explained my frustrations to the manager and she said well I don't know what to say. I said don't worry..u don't have to say anything, I'll just go to Outback which is 5 minutes away & proceeded to walk out. The manager Sharina Mitchell then proceeded to run behind me demanding I pay for the $4 margarita I ordered even though my entire experience was horrible and my order was wrong! She threatened to call the police over a $4 margarita that should have been comped to me because of the shotty service I was provided. I kindly threw Sharona $4 on the floor for her to pick up, just like trash! I will never go to this Applebee's again and I plan to start a petition tonhabe them closed down and replaced with a more upscale professional restaurant that offers good service and care about the quality of work their employees put out as a representation of their poor business practices! Zero Stars! Negative zero stars!!!"
Benjamin S.,"Atlantic Beach, FL",10,13,,1.0,2/8/2015,"Waited 43 min for our food, waitress only came to our table once to clear our appetizer plate didn't even mention the long wait,  won't talk about the food because it is what you come to expect from Applebee's, pasta was luke warm, I guess they were to lazy to even microwave my pasta after it had been sitting somewhere, not to mention after we were served, waitress didn't come back until 15 min later to ask, after having walked past us three times, enough said"
Dell W.,"Washington, DC",86,71,289,4.0,8/9/2014,"Good service Carlton was attentive and polite.  Food was tasty, fresh and the sirloin was tender and flavorful.  Vegetables were tender, not over done. Overall atmosphere was comfortable and seating was comfortable."
Vincent K.,"Averill Park, NY",0,1,,1.0,10/3/2014,"This is the slowest Applebee's I've every been to, had to leave , 4 tables around us said they had to wait forever, to many other choices in that area."
Karim B.,"Atlanta, GA",32,13,,1.0,4/30/2012,"The worst restaurant in business. The only reason they are still running is because there are too many people that are accepting of horrible service because of convenience and price.  Some of the servers acted as if they didn't want to show up to work that day. One of the ""servers"" was walking around with cloth napkins and was dropping them down on random tables haphazardly. Also a server was walking around with her shirt not pulled down displaying her love handles while I was trying to enjoy my beer. Not exactly what I want to see.  The only reason I came here was to meet up with friends. I will never spend money on the food in this establishment."
Renata P.,"Baltimore, MD",2,14,11,1.0,4/27/2014,Awful. Placed an order and noone was at the take out booth.  They have me standing at side near the kitchen. I'm waiting. The manager passed me several times and didn't acknowledge.  Kitchen staff came and helped.  Dissatisfied.
Dawn B.,"Marietta, GA",43,152,12,3.0,11/21/2013,"Let me say this....this is not your typical Applebee's!  If your looking for family dining your better off at the McDonalds across the street but if your looking for a spot to have a GOOD drink and club like atmosphere then look no further.   All the previous reviews are correct.  The staff need customer service training (no lounging up from team) and the food is so so but I just wanted a really good drink without people stepping on my feet at the Club and guess what? I found it at Applebee's.....I hate to say it but although it's located in the suburbs of this is the hood style Applebee's .  If you want to hear great music (yes, hip hop fanatic for life) then walk right in, grab a seat at the bar and grab a Long Island and your on your way to real life Love and Hip Hop episode :)"
LaToya V.,"Falls Church, VA",84,23,1,1.0,3/19/2013,"I'm not a fan of Applebee's but one of our friends was really hungry so we went here thinking the service would be quick. There are definitely issues with the bar area. We sat at a table in the bar area and waited 25 minutes to put our drink orders in. My friend had to call the restaurant and ask to speak to the manager to let him know we had been sitting for over 20 minutes with no service. Then the waitress came over and did not immediately apologize. She looked annoyed that she had to wait on us. The food was alright (again not a fan). Then for the finale to this awful experience, she charged our tickets wrong when the tickets were clearly separated as to what tickets should be charged. Ugh! I will not be going back to this restaurant if I can prevent it."
