Sam W.,"Lexington Park, MD",3,124,44,1.0,11/13/2013,"Can't say anything for the food, but the three times my husband and I tried to eat here, we turned around and walked away when we couldn't even hear ourselves talk outside the restaurant over the incredibly loud music. I mean, seriously. This wasn't on a weekend, like Wends and Thurs night. I don't expect that from Applebees. Just another case of PG crapping over everything I enjoy."
Rob P.,"Bowie, MD",122,36,135,1.0,1/5/2012,Sat around the bar area were you should get faster service. We were coming from a long day of shopping. We got menu after 10 mins. Then sat for 25mins before we received the drink order I stopped looking at my watch. I just wanted to get the food and go. The Server seemed to be afraid of  the Bartender. Now this was not our 1st. Or 2nd bad experience with this Applebee's. And the only reason we were back this time was that they had just reopened with a new look and we hoped a new attitude. Well the place looks great.  There are on the 'C' list Cee ya! The TGIFriday's @ the BLVD is open now.
Paul J.,"Washington, DC",3,61,21,1.0,8/21/2012,This place stay away from it service is terrible  I got better service  at A Kkk picnic
Jasmine W.,"Suitland, MD",2,57,7,2.0,4/1/2015,"This location is ghetto and has poor customer service. I live around the corner so I have given them a few tries due to convenience, but I am giving up. They have slow service and are very unprofessional. When I order to go I can hear the workers in the kitchen cursing and calling each other niggers. I do not recommend eating here, especially at night. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because the food tastes ok."
Ashley W.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",96,2,,4.0,12/16/2013,"The service could always be better wherever you go, but at least they try to fix the mistakes. The music late night is a little urban for me but others seem to love it. I will definitely come back for the happy hour specials!!"
Santos D.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",10,12,5,2.0,11/12/2012,The server was getto!! The sliverware was very dirty! The food was good.

M B.,"Capitol Heights, MD",22,44,18,1.0,8/16/2010,"Horrible customer service.  Our waitress was slow and unprofessional.  I believe her name was Lissa S.  It took her a while to take our order, but when she did, she pulled her order pad out of a crown royal pouch! I knew from that moment that she was going to be a problem.   One of my friends ordered the chicken portobello but they gave him steak.  When we told her that it was wrong, she tried to argue with us that it was chicken and I quote ""That's how it's supposed to look"" It's sad when you work in the food industry and can't tell the difference between poultry and beef! We ended up calling the 1-800 number to complain and received $10 gift cards.  I will never go back to the Largo location again!"
Quint L.,"Hyattsville, MD",295,60,34,2.0,5/23/2012,this place is always unusually quiet  for me. If you wanna better brighter atmosphere try jaspers 3 minutes away. Since its quiet it's probably a good place to go when you're breaking up with your girlfriend. The butter knives do not have serrated edges.
Dale J.,"Fort Washington, MD",1,9,,1.0,8/31/2011,"We visited Applebee's Sunday, Aug 28th, the day after hurricane Ireane. There was no wait and it wasn't busy.  I ordered steak and eggs from the brunch menu and the eggs came back looking like they were cooked in some sort of dark teriaki sauce or just cooked too long and not scrambled at all but folded over. The manager told us this is how they cook their eggs and it wouldn't be any different if  they were cooked again.   The waitress gave us our drink order and we didn't see her for the next 30 mins.  No water, no refils, no attention.  My food came out before my childs food who only had pancakes and bacon.   Overall, it was a very bad meal and the service was horrible."
JaQuan H.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",2,3,,1.0,9/17/2014,"My family and I visited this location yesterday for dinner. We arrived at 6:15 and our order didn't arrive until 7:00.  There were approximately 40 ppl total in the restaurant so I didn't understand the hold up.  I was furious as we ordered two kids meals and two entrees.  Nothing special, just hamburgers for the children (2) and bourbon chicken dinners (2) for the adults.  40 freaking minutes to eat and th establishment is NOT busy. That's totally unacceptable.  I spoke with the manager and although he tried to understand my frustation, he offered NOTHING in return for the terrible service.  To say the least, APPLEBEES will never get my cash donation again. Service is horrible."
Leachim S.,"Nashua, NH",125,137,33,1.0,4/30/2013,Not impressed.  My salad came out the same time as my meal.  The nachos we ordered were made wrong and had to be brought back.  The balsamic salad dressing was not balsamic and the waitress didn't bother to inform me that it was something different... Still not sure what it was?!?
N S.,"Silver Spring, MD",8,26,1,1.0,12/14/2012,"Terrible experience. It was my first visit. The wait times were entirely too long for dine in. Tables were not being bussed to seat new guests. After 20 minites, we were seated. We immediately gave our server both our drink and food order when she finally came. Then we waited. We talked, caught up with one another, and were really in no rush that Saturday night. But 30 more minutes passed before getting drinks. We told the manager. We were just ready to leave. She said our food was free but I was tired of waiting. I filed an online complaint and received a call from a regional manager. He asked if I would revisit that location. I said no, and don't plan on it."
Anastasia C.,"Bowie, MD",14,25,5,1.0,6/5/2014,"WISH I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS  I went to Applebee's Largo last night for our weekly Karaoke night and was completely appalled. I was disgusted at how my table was treated. The service was terrible, the food was subpar, and the drinks were watered down. However that wasn't  even the worst part. After sending my drink back, the ""manager"" returned to my table with the SAME drink letting me  know that the bartender JUST made this drink--as if I would change my mind on how watered down it was. My friend received his drink and had the same problem and told our waitress, who proceeded to yell at us saying ""didn't I just ask you if you wanted to send it back when I was just here, I JUST ASKED YOU"". She says all of this while having very suggestive hand and body motions. I then spoke to the manager about the evening and explained to him that I will not be paying for this visit. Instead of asking me what was wrong he proceeded to storm off in a rage.  As I proceeded to leave the establishment I was confronted and told to pay my bill by our server, when I refused she told me that she would ""beat my ass"" YELLING across the restaurant at me calling me a ""broke bitch"". The situation then escalated when she charged at me and my group and called two of my friends  ""fucking faggots""--yelling ""get the fuck out of here faggot"". The entire time the ""manager"" is just standing in the room with his arms crossed SILENT, no intervening, no problem solving--silence. I refuse to support an establishment that is so disrespectful, unprofessional, rude, and nasty. I have NEVER in my life had an experience with a server like the one I had last evening. And will never be returning to Applebee's establishments."
Selisha T.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",0,4,3,1.0,7/5/2015,"If I could post with zero stars I would. I had the absolute worst experience last Sunday. We were greeted by a very nice host. We were waiting to be serviced for at least 20 minutes. We then let the host know and he let the bartender know. She was very busy at the bar but she did come over and take our drink orders. She was very nice. So we got our drinks and were then ready to order appetizers. The bartender came back to take our order. We noticed that there were a few employees sitting down including one of the managers. Another 30 minutes go by and we have not been assigned a waiter/waitress and we never received our food or drink order. At this point, everyone is fed up and ready to leave. Before we left, we asked to speak with the manager. The bartender called over to the ""manager"" who was sitting down eating. He slowly walked over to the bartender accusing her of not doing her job. He and the bartender started going back and forth. The manager refused to come to our table expecting the bartender to resolve the issue. Finally, everyone was fed up. With the manager standing there, we told the bartender to just forget it. We didn't feel like the service was worth paying for but the manager let us know that it would come out of her check. Those were the only words he spoke to us. He didn't chase us out to try to reason or anything. He just had the ""I don't give a fuck"" type of attitude. His name is Ron. He was so rude and nonchalant. I would never go there again. Good luck keeping loyal customers keeping Ron around."
Jasmin H.,"Hanover, MD",204,133,15,3.0,3/7/2012,"I prefer this Applebee's over the one in Bowie ANYDAY. I've always had friendly servers and prompt service. Although this locations is pretty tight/small, i've never had to wait a super long time to be seated.  Don't let the location fool you. Even when we came here after a event at FedEx field the service didn't slow down. Your def better off coming here than goin anywhere in BLVD or the Restaurant Park with the Ruby Tuesday."
Cathy A.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,3,,4.0,5/21/2012,"We had a good experience here. We went around 1pm in March of '11. It was neither too busy nor too empty. Our server took out orders quickly, and then our food was prepared quickly too. It was delicious- they had a 2/$20 option which fit our budget.  I hate to say I forget our waiters name, but he was good. Not too nosy and very polite. If I'm ever in Maryland for lunch again, I would go back!"
Andrew C.,"Vancouver, WA",11,35,2,1.0,9/7/2011,"Absolute worst Applebees (possibly worst restaurant) I've ever been to.  Served cold chicken breast, server could care less about her customers.  Avoid at all costs."
Mom To One B.,"Bowie, MD",1,17,,5.0,5/10/2013,"I must say I've had bad experiences here in the past. My recent experience was excellent. The food was great, it could have come out faster but it was ok. I would think being one of three customers in the restaurant you shouldnt have to wait long for food, but it was cooked to perfection so I didnt mind the wait. The chicken fajita roll up was delicious. Big and tasty, not lacking anything. The Bowie location served the roll up with pretty much just bread and it was cold. Our carry-out desserts were delicious too. I now prefer this location over the bowie location. I think this location is under new management and the service and food has improved greatly."
Tawny E.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",6,35,,4.0,8/15/2012,"So I know that this site is really to glorify the mom and pop's restaurateurs of the world, but I have to give it to America's Neighborhood grill for really stepping up its menu options. The weight watchers menu is excellent and the portions really help with America's expanding waistlines. My friend selected the grilled chipotle-lime shrimp and black bean corn salsa tossed with lime juice and chopped cilantro, served on a mix of grilled zucchini, marinated tomatoes, onions & red peppers with steamed white rice. She actually welcomed the smaller portion of rice. I ordered the most Amazing salad I ve had in quite some time. The fiesta chopped salad  with its black bean corn salsa, roasted red peppers & onions, tortilla strips, white cheddar and spicy jalapeño dressing, chimichurri glazed grilled chicken. I ordered a side of shrimp just for variety. The spicy jalapeno dressing is simply divine. I was so enthralled by this salad that I did not come up for air until half had somehow disappeared from my plate lol.  I had to tell everyone about how good it was and because I just wanted someone to experience what I already knew to be true I brought along my friend. Applebee's I have taken you for granted but no longer."
