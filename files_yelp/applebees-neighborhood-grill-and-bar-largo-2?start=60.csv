Aaron W.,"Alexandria, VA",0,43,,3.0,12/3/2009,"Arrived during happy hour. The bar was busy, but the dining area was not. Good service and great food. We had Bacon Cheese burgers and Steak. The only issue we had was that the music from the bar was toooo loud, gave my wife a headache. We asked if the music could be turned down, but no luck. We will go back, but either arrive earlier or later after happy hour."
