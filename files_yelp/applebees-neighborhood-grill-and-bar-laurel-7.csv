Khoi N.,"Silver Spring, MD",241,257,644,3.0,12/13/2017,"Used to come here for lunch once in a blue moon. Place has gone down over the years. Servers are not enthusiastic at all. We came for the $1 Long Island Ice Teas and some apps. Ice teas were a bit watered down as expected.  All in all food here is reasonably priced. You can get an app, entree and dessert for $20. Laurel has better chains and mom n pop restaurants in the area"
Blanca R.,"Silver Spring, MD",50,10,1,1.0,10/4/2017,"Mediocre. Food was just awful. Not worth it. I wish we would've just gone somewhere else.  I ordered grill chicken breast with bacon beer cheese topper the chicken was dry, and over cooked. The broccoli was so soft it was disgusting. The best thing we ordered were the mozzarella sticks. never again."
Sarah M.,"Laurel, MD",218,79,10,1.0,12/31/2017,Help me now. One and done. Never ever again. I came for $1 long islands. Served out of Lowe's igloo counters by a bartender with his entire butt hanging out and boxers showing. Also the bar is filthy fruit flies flying and the fruit tray is so sticky. I don't think this place has seen a deep clean in at least 6 months. Followed by a sewage leak and smell in the bathroom that would make You puke... which they solved by spraying perfume. Asked to speak to the manager which isn't here today no floor manager no kitchen manager literally no management.
Donald W.,"Washington, DC",0,2,,4.0,12/26/2017,"This Applebee's staff is always an issue.  The 1st waitress with green hair forgot about us.  After 30 minutes we asked her when she would be available for us to order our appetizers and drinks.  She said ""it takes her a long time to find things in the computer.""  Finally, we were given a different waitress (Meeka).  She was great!  The food sucks, the drinks were weak as well.   The manager was hiding in the back somewhere.  He/she never came out to see how things were going.  Won't go back for a while.  Hopefully, they'll get enough complaints to get the ownership to make changes."
Bob A.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,30,5,5.0,9/30/2017,"My wife and I just had an exceptional meal at AppleBees in Laurel.  Our server, Briea, was so friendly and attentive, and the Manager, Mark, checked on us frequently and suggested a dessert that was very good. This attention, combined with good food at great prices, in an ambience where I could carry on a conversation without shouting, will certainly bring me back again and again to this location. Very good experience (although the men's room smelled bad, both before and after dinner)."
Licha D.,"District Heights, MD",96,4,7,1.0,10/26/2017,"This is a really nice place. They close at 12AM but the mentality at 11pm is ""get out!"" The place is clean but I think the dishwasher is broke or on vacation because every dish from appetizer plates to water glasses were dirty. Major bummer on our date night hoped for better late night vibes. Wish I would've took a picture of my plate and margarita! Food was ok, service was rushed. But hey... it's Applebee's."
Kelay F.,"Washington, DC",4,19,8,1.0,12/1/2017,"We ordered the $1 Long Island Ice Tea and the 2 for $20. The drinks came out immediately but they tasted like unsweetened lemonade. After 30 minutes our entrees came but still no appetizers or silverware. We asked the host for silverware only to be told that they didn't have any clean silverware! We waited another ten minutes a d finally they brought us silverware and one salad. Twenty minutes after that we received the second salad. The waitress was nice but not very attentive. She took our order, apologized about the silverware and brought the check."
Ryan S.,"Bethesda, MD",39,1,,1.0,12/15/2017,"Service was terrible, the manager was rude, and there was a roach in my Cobb Salad. Beyond disgusting. Avoid at all cost."
Kevin O.,"Jacksonville, FL",56,123,35,1.0,1/15/2017,"This location is an unmitigated disaster. They are far too understaffed and the manager does not even help.  I sat there for 20 minutes then finally someone came by.  Then when the food came out, they had the wrong food (belonged at a different table).  The waitress said to me, when she could tell I was disappointed, ""Well, I can only do one thing at a time"". Not her fault though... whoever manages the schedule really does not know what they are doing.  My final problem however was the manager.  She just kept walking by and looking - why didn't she help?  She could have turned herself into a waitress fast and really helped. Both the customers and the staff would have appreciated that.  But, alas, she did not.  This is on my NO RETURN list."
John S.,"Silver Spring, MD",2,15,12,1.0,10/22/2017,"Stay away from Crapplebee's. Long waits, nasty food, food with hair in it. Anything that can go wrong goes wrong. Decent waiter service. You can tell there is only one cook in the kitchen by the quality of the food and wait times. We were one of about 5 tables dining and waited about 30 minutes for our appetizer. I hope they shut down and reopen as a better concept like Chili's or Cava. Save your time and money and go to Wendy's down the street if you're craving a late night meal."
Chelsea S.,"Washington, DC",26,146,92,3.0,1/11/2017,"I have always been a fan of Applebees, even back home in Florida. For some reason though my visits haven't been so great. The first time my husband and I ate here I ordered a house salad and the lettuce was rotten - it tasted horrible. I was so disgusted by that, that I barely touched my dinner. I didn't complain or say anything because our server was so sweet and I know it wasn't her fault that the food came out that way.  The second time was about a week ago, my husband and I went here to eat dinner and the food was better, but then the server wasn't all that great. She was handling the bar and high tops so she was always running around and took forever to get our refills.  Applebees used to be one of my favorite places, but the last visits I have had haven't been too great."
Oh W.,"Fairfax, VA",58,20,3,2.0,8/9/2017,"Last Thursday I had dinner w/a friend. The waiters & waitresses get 5 stars. But the food was awful & served cold. THERE WERE ANTS EVERYWHERE. Another patron said ""they always have ants."" My friend was smashing ants on the table while we ate. NEVER GOING BACK"
Li S.,"Jamestown, NY",44,233,715,3.0,8/22/2016,"It's been probably 5 years since I've stepped foot into an Applebee's. I'm typically not a fan of chain restaurants.  I came here for a work dinner and got the grilled chicken caesar salad. The salad was HUMONGOUS. I'm not sure if this was the standard size salad or if they thought I was eating for 4. The chicken was freshly grilled, and actually tasted like real chicken (always a plus in my book!) Dressing was way too heavy; I wish I had thought to ask for dressing on the side. Unless you like your lettuce drenched in dressing, get it on the side!  Service was great. Our server was obviously enjoying herself, and she was a hoot all night. I wish I remembered her name to give her a shoutout!  While Applebee's embodies everything about chain restaurants that I hate, my experience here wasn't so bad."
Jonathan S.,"Laurel, MD",32,4,5,5.0,12/3/2016,"Beyond the free wifi and good food, it's the staff here that makes this restaurant a good experience.  I don't particularly like Applebees, so trust me when I say that I was impressed with the service.  Hats off to Mika, one of the best and prettiest waitresses I've had serve me in a while. Excellent personality and very professional.  The food was prepared very well. Nice spacious atmosphere and very comfortable dining. Easy to work and eat food in.  By the way (bonus), if you come in during lunch time, proves are significantly reduced on most entrees. I'll definitely be back."
Urs M.,"Jacksonville, NC",282,234,1569,2.0,6/25/2015,"I don't really care for Applebee's, Chili's, chains like that where the bar gets way too loud at night. Good thing we went as soon as it opened because it was just my table and another. Our waiter was sweet and had a few jokes. He even cracked one about the couch stuffing coming out of the obvious hole I was sitting next to. I was starving. There was food... and it was food. Yeah. Food. I know how horrible that sounds, but it was true. I ordered the lunch special that included a soup and a main entree. I got the chicken tortilla soup and the mac and cheese with honey chicken tenders. There was no chicken to be found in my soup and it was salty, salty, and sour. I was very confused. And tomato-y. It was like super salty and chunky ketchup with a leaf of cilantro. Weird. The chicken tender was a joke. It reminded me of those pieces of bread you put in the microwave too long and they get hard and chewy. Also, it was like half of a half of a tender. Three pieces of chicken. I know it was a lunchtime deal, but y'all didn't have to do me like that. I must say that the honey that dripped from the chicken and onto the mac and cheese was delicious, though. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the flavour was lovely. Yep. That's Applebee's for you. Enjoy."
Clint N.,"Saint Marys City, MD",114,7,,1.0,4/1/2017,"I ordered carside to go but when I got there no one came outside.  After several minutes, I went in and was told that I have to call when I get there.  I've ordered at several locations and have never had to do that.  On top of that, my hot food was ready but I had to wait several more minutes for them to make my side salad.  The server had to ask them several times to make it.  By the time I got home, my food was cold.  I will avoid this place in the future."
Delly P.,"Beltsville, MD",236,4,,4.0,6/5/2017,I went 2 weeks ago with my husband and daughter. We got the Wednesday special steak and I thought it would be small but it was a lot of food I could barely finish it and it was only $10. I am amazeddd. The service was excellent. Our server was expecting but she was veryyy attentive and always one step ahead providing great service and we had everything we needed. Only bad thing was the marinara sauce for the mozz sticks. Not very tasty. Other than that I would defiantly come back.
Sassystuds B.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,6,2,1.0,8/6/2017,"I guess we should've read the reviews before coming here huh lol. We came in on a Sunday night about 40 min before closing were standing at the front waiting for someone to great us but that never happened. A heavyset lady was walking up towards the front yelling/complaining to her coworker/bartender. She approached us and said ""just two?"" I guess that was our greeting lol any way we followed her to the booth. Once we got to the booth she placed the menus on the table and kept walking didn't turn around to us at all.... just kept walking!!!!!! Super rude! After that we didn't even sit down it was clear that she didn't want us there so we left and went somewhere else to eat."
Hair C.,"Hyattsville, MD",679,10,36,1.0,7/9/2016,If customer service is what your looking for then you've come to the wrong place!! The staff is very rude lately! I've been here on enjoyable occasions many times but since the renovation the bar staff is HORRIBLE!!! I will Not be coming here again!!
Jeff H.,"Fairfax, VA",0,8,,1.0,6/16/2017,"Kept trying to find reasons not to post a negative review for them but i just couldnt handle it. First off me and 2 friends went in, got seated. Our server came shortly her name was Courtney. Keep in mind this is not our first time coming to applebees and i usually always get the same stuff. I ordered the same drink i've gotten from other applebees (the peach quencher ice tea) . 10 mins go by and we get our drinks. I first noticed my tea looked like my friends regular mango tea. My tea was supposed to come with peach slices. I asked her isnt my tea supposed to come with ""real fruit"" that it states on the menu. She immediately says No. i brushed it off no big deal. Right when we got our drinks my friend places a order for the $14.99 appetizer thing ahead of time while we look over the menu. 15 mins later Me and my friend decide to get the 2 for 25 . Our appetizer was onion rings..please tell me why the onion rings came out before anything. At this time we started eating the onion rings and i notice we didnt have any silverware no napkins and most importantly NO SAUCE?!  Like c'mon mannn just brought us a plate of onion rings?!? Wtf!  Still keeping my cool. Our server payed more attention to other tables beside us. As she walked away i had to yell her name just to ask her to get us some sauce. An hour goes by and still no $14.99 app thing we ordered as soon as we came in. Thought nothing of it. Mistakes happen. Then, our main food comes out. Yet , still no silverware.. i guess we're supposed to get our own? The server walks by and manager walks by and says ""oh i'll go get them some silverware""... didnt kno it was that complicated. The host at the door came by and asked us if we needed refills TWICE! I had to be a little rude and ask ""am i supposed to eat with my hands?!?"" He immediately went and got us some . Even after all that time and our food was cold i still managed to keep calm. I've worked in the food industry for 12years. I kno how it is but c'mon. Show some respect. Treat others how u would want to be treated. So what if youre tired. Get the damn work day finished. Dont halfass it .if it was you or your mother or father in my shoes.. wouldnt u give them the best service and want them to be respected... the server came by ONCE during our meal. Thats when my blood started boiling. I immediately asked for the check . Got the check and i couldnt believe it... never got the appetizer we ordered but we're still getting charged $14.99 for it. At that point i was pissed. The audacity. Told the server she went and checked .. and yes they forgot. Asked me if i still wanted it i said NO! Paid for my stuff and left. This visit really pushed my buttons. Oh and mind the fact that it was someones smartass idea to have a loudass art instructor teach a painting class of 30 people. All i kept hearing was the class. Simply retarded. People are trying to enjoy a nice quiet meal. I just want to say to these young servers ... GROW UP! DO YOUR JOB! Doesnt matter what kinda job , do your best! Act like u love the damn job.. dont have to actually love it. Just atleast pretend. Horrible meal thumbs down to this location."
Wendy M.,"Burtonsville, MD",0,4,,1.0,11/6/2016,I have been here in the past and enjoyed the food and service. Today there is only a handful of guests and the wait time was ridiculous. The food was terrible and there trying to over charge me. I feel like I've been waiting forever! Last time coming here!
Malin K.,"Greenbelt, MD",42,5,1,1.0,7/16/2017,This Place Is Absolutely Horrific!  Nasty Ghetto Loud Rude.  Hopefully They Will Go Outta Business And Open a New Restaurant In It's Place.  STAY AWAY !
David J.,"Beltsville, MD",0,14,,2.0,2/11/2017,I usually like Applebee's but not this one. The bar is off to one side directly in front of where you come in. This is the second time we have been here in the last year. Again the bar noise was very loud and affected the whole restaurant. They need to remodel this Applebee's and make it like the other ones there the bar is in a sunken area in the back middle. I have never minded those. I probably won't go back to this one.
Tanita C.,"Laurel, MD",23,1,,4.0,12/16/2016,We live areound by this applebee's and tonight we came just to get out of the house. Our server Stephon L. was a great server he made our little girl feel so happy and he kept checking on us. As long as he is here we will be back. Thank you Stephon L. for great service.
Joong K.,"Columbia, MD",0,3,,1.0,5/16/2017,We usually do not go to this location but we were in the area on Sunday (Mother's Day) May 14th. It should be negative star since we didn't even get serviced or greetings from anyone. We waited for a good 10-12 minutes in front of hostess booth for someone to come. Other waiters and waitresses saw us just standing there but not one cared. I do hope it's not like this all the time. This treatment never happened in other locations. I will not stop by this place again.
Ken M.,"Glenn Dale, MD",298,375,83,4.0,1/6/2014,"It's kinda ironic, really. I was just at the Applebees in Bowie two days before I met a friend here for lunch.  It happened to be convenient and centrally located so, yeah, Applebees it was. It wasn't overly crowded when we got there on a Saturday around noon which is really fine by me. Our waitress (Dani) was on top of things and super friendly with a great sense of humor. I went for the Signature Sirloin under 550 calories meal. (Watching my figure for the new year). Very tasty. Although, it has a slightly different configuration from the Bowie Applebees. Still, I enjoyed the meal. A plus - when I checked in on Foursquare and it tweeted out, Applebees connected to ask how lunch was on Twitter.  I like places that do that.   So, I'm good with this restaurant."
Jennifer H.,"Columbia, SC",0,6,1,5.0,9/17/2016,Great service. Our waiter was very attentive and nice. The food was delicious. Will definitely be going back.
Tina L.,"Arlington, VA",51,19,66,2.0,2/13/2016,"Normally I do not go to chain restaurants but months ago I went to an Applebee's in TN and I was impressed. When I came back to MD, I tried to go to one in my area but they permanently closed. This weekend, I made a trip to this location. I expected the same quality of food but the stirred fried shrimp turned out the food was on the greasy side, also their nacho's chips. I ll wait till they finish with renovation and try again."
Justin R.,"Hyattsville, MD",2,8,,1.0,9/10/2016,"I came at 11:50 PM when the website said they are open until 1 PM on a Saturday. No hours were posted on the door. When we walked in we were immediately told, ""Um, we are closed"" when the restaurant had at least 20 people in it. Clearly this place has a poor rating already, I shouldn't of expected more."
Robert P.,"Columbia, MD",0,38,167,3.0,4/29/2016,The two for twenty menu that comes with an appetizer is a good deal the food was good but the service was slow even when the restaurant was slow. I would go again because the food was good hopefully the service would be better next time.
Kelly B.,"Laurel, MD",0,2,,1.0,4/23/2017,"Save your money and time and go ANYWHERE else.   The service was horrible. My debit card never made it back to the table. The manager had our party stand up to check the booth, although I told him it wasn't in the book. His response, ""it was in there"". Fifteen minutes later the server appears with my card he found on the floor. Manager says nothing. Server supplies weak ""I'm sorry"".  The food isn't that great either."
Tyler D.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",0,1,,1.0,1/6/2017,Poor service. Got one meal for myself through take-out. Applebee's lost order. They took 30 minutes to fix my order while I waited. Oh...did I forget to mention there were only 8 people in the whole restaurant. Get it together Applebee's.
Shirelle K.,"Washington, DC",12,47,6,1.0,4/21/2016,Terrible service. Stood at the bar for over 15 minutes. The bartender and waitress totally ignored me! They did however recognize any regulars that walked in. I am not a fan of AppleBees anyway. I just wanted a few shots of 1800. I ended up down the street at TGIFridays.
Melanie E.,"Bowie, MD",4,43,20,1.0,9/20/2015,"Terrible service... Sat at the bar and had to ask to take my drink order. Bartender broke a glass in front of my boyfriends spot and only halfway cleaned up the glass. There was still glass on the placemat. Additionally, cocktails were 90% ice and maybe 2 sips of alcohol. I didn't want to be a bother because I know the one bartender was training and I'm sure the Saturday night was busy and stressful... But broken glass and $20 for ice is not acceptable."
Gladys M.,"Silver Spring, MD",10,101,52,3.0,8/23/2015,Did not leave the best first impression. My sissy wanted to try out Applebee's for her bd and I'm always up for steak. Ordered a 9 oz sirloin with mash potatoes and fries. The steak was okay. Not as juicy as I had imagine. The fries were lacking favor. And the mash potatoes were hard and stuck to the folk. My family also didn't like it. The food gets 2 stars. The server was friendly so she gets a star as well. Pretty pricy for food that we did not enjoy.
Le Don S.,"Beltsville, MD",144,1,,1.0,6/28/2016,The worst service ever took 40 min no drinks brought to the tabel and was profiled. Would not recommend that location to anyone. Very disappointed and upset
Kirsten P.,"Jessup, MD",0,7,,5.0,5/30/2016,"I thought our experience with this restaurant was exceptional. The waitress, Vanessa was very professional and took very good care of us. She made sure our meal was exactly the way we wanted it. She communicated to us when the kitchen ran out of lemonade and garlic mashed potatoes.  My husband and I ordered the Salmon dish with grilled veggies.  My veggies were undercooked. Vanessa took the veggies back to the kitchen and made them put it back on the grill. The second time it came out it was made perfectly to my liking. I would definitely go back there because Vanessa would make sure we are taken care of there and that the service was satisfactory. I definitely will be returning to this restaurant.  Thanks to Vanessa!"
Nicholas C.,"Yorktown, VA",2,6,,1.0,4/5/2016,"Waited 15 minutes by the bar, no one helped me. Haven't been to an Applebee's in years, won't be back anytime soon."
Krystal M.,"McDonough, GA",0,15,,1.0,5/7/2016,Don't waste you time. The food was OK. Server was bad we didn't get our drinks until the food came and then the server didn't even apologize she acted like nothing was wrong . The manager came around and I told him. All he said was thank you their are some things we need to work on.
Angela R.,"Broomall, PA",0,3,,1.0,11/1/2016,"My boyfriend and I ordered the appetizer special and a burger. It took 40 minutes to receive the food, which came out at the same time. The burger came out wrong two times. & when we got out of our seat to talk to a manager about our problems with the burger (because our waitress was no where to be found.) she said she would handle it, and than we again waited 15 minutes before anyone came up to his to handle the situation."
