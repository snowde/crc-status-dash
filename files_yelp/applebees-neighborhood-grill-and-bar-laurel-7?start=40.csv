Alexis R.,"Kohler, WI",5,10,1,1.0,12/26/2014,"Very slow service on the two occasions that we have been here. The manager came to check on us and offered a dessert menu. At least ten minutes pass by and neither the manager or our server come back to check on us. We were in a bit of a time crunch, and the lack of service is unacceptable. The food was average (what you would expect from an Applebee's,) though the wings we had as an appetizer tasted and felt like they had been reheated.  I'm disappointed especially since it was my decision to come here when surrounded by so many better options."
Barney S.,"Columbia, MD",0,4,,1.0,8/25/2015,All you can eat ribs were inedible. Mostly bone. The burger I got as a replacement was overlooked and sub-par. My friend's fajita chicken was chewy and bland. Buffalo wings were average. Service was fine.
Ashaad E.,"Severn, MD",250,6,2,1.0,11/28/2015,Meal was horrible. Yes it was the 2 for $20! Pay for what you get. The total bill with tip and 2 cokes still came up to $37. We will never return. I think they microwaved the food!
Jenna C.,"New York, NY",120,2,,1.0,2/20/2016,"The food was fine. The service was terrible. We never got our drinks. When we complained the waitress, Vanessa, got a nasty attitude with us. The managers were not helpful. They messed up our checks. Just a terrible experience."
Jerry S.,"Beltsville, MD",173,521,677,3.0,9/29/2013,"Pretty much as expected for a chain resturant. Steak was tender, tasty and cooked as ordered. Sides were also tasty but portions a bit small. Portobello cap stuffed with spinach was a nice twist. All the games on TVs in the bar - each had a sign indicating which game would be on when. Half a star off for lackadaisical service."
Jim S.,"Laurel, MD",168,239,105,1.0,11/8/2012,"Wow, how did this place get this bad? Once upon a time you could go to Applebee's and get some pretty decent food for not too much money.  Prices are highish to start with and then you take the quality into consideration and... F* this place. The boneless wings were not terrible, they just were not good. The steak was poorly cooked, the mashed potatoes were reminiscent of school lunches and the broccolli was just nasty. WTF???"
Christina W.,"Hanover, MD",53,7,1,5.0,11/25/2015,Good food and good service! The manager honored the vets day discount even though this particular location wasn't participating in the promotion. Two thumbs up
Simon T.,"Clarksville, MD",1,26,4,1.0,1/12/2017,"We had to wait a bit before anyone knowledged us. I ordered a water and my friend ordered a diet Pepsi, plus a strawberry limeade. We waited a long time for our ""strawberry limeade"". Everytime the waiter would come back she keep saying your strawberry lemonodie would take a while. At one point we corrected her but she said the 2 drinks were the same thing. When it did come it looked like a margarita or daiquiri and tasted alcoholic. We even asked another server but was assured it was a limeade as well. When our apps came the mozzarella sticks were cold, pretzel sticks were gross, and salsa & chips nasty. Salsa was very watery and almost half of the chips were broken. Our burgers came out and we both noticed the fries weren't cooked. Half way thru our meal my friend discovered a piece of debris in the bottom of his fries. We both got grossed out and couldn't eat anymore. Ended up contacting our server & a manager came over shortly. Manager asked whats the issue with the daiquiri. That was the issue we never ordered one. We also explained what the issue was with the rest of our orders. Ended up removing the apps and the one drink but felt like they should have done more. Felt like I got robbed $26.47 from you guys. Hope my friend and I don't get food poisoning tomorrow."
Sherrif A.,"Richmond, VA",80,1,2,1.0,8/2/2014,"Terrible, awful, I was asked to leave the bar because I had a vertical id, meanwhile I'm 24, bartender was a complete Jerk. And the waiter that served me couldn't be a more confused individual. And the food was below average. I should have just left and went to long horn next door."
Colleen M.,"Laurel, MD",0,5,,1.0,11/14/2015,"Arrived at 6:30 PM and were seated fairly quickly. We were a party of three and were seated at a booth in the back corner. Our waitress came around quickly and took our drink order. She came back without the requested decaf coffee and took our dinner order. She double checked our order to make sure it was right.  Things downhill in minute. We noticed that only one table in the restaurant had food. By thirty minutes after our order was placed, we still had no food. She came back and told us our food would be out in 2 to 3 minutes. Needless to say 10 minutes later we still had no food. The manager was simply busing tables and ignoring all customers. We were totally unimpressed with restaurant."
Katina B.,"Laurel, MD",0,5,6,5.0,11/3/2015,"I'm not sure why Applebee's has such a low rating, but I loved it! My husband and I ordered it to go last night and I want to order again tonight. Not only are the deals WONDERFUL, the food was delicious!  I ordered the 2 for $20 (yes for myself). I ordered two Cesar salads for the appetizer. They were a pretty good portion for a appetizer, not too much, not too little. For the two entrees I ordered the Smokey Chipotle BBQ Riblets basket & Three Cheese Chicken Penne. They were both so delicious, my mouth is watering as we speak! My husband ordered the Smokey Chipotle BBQ full rack of baby back ribs. Surprisingly he loved them! (& he's a VERY picky eater so I was VERY surprised and happy).  Great job Applebees!"
Kevin S.,"Silver Spring, MD",1,14,,1.0,10/15/2015,The service here is horrible. The waiter screwed up the order three times before we even got our food. After 25 mins one of four orders came out. Then two other orders came out still missing the fourth order. Ten minutes later the final order came out after one person was through eating. We then walked out.
Destinie B.,"Carver/Langston, Washington, DC",3,20,17,5.0,6/12/2015,The 5 stars are for our waiter Greg who was the absolute best!! He saw us sitting there waiting for service and even though we weren't in his section he provided some of the best service I've ever had. Definitely will be back and definitely will sit in Greg's section.
Cheryle O.,"Miami, FL",0,12,,1.0,7/9/2015,Awful at the very best! Food looked like it sat for a while before it was brought to our table! No flavor and small portions. The service is extremely slow and they don't much care about anything. Tables are sticky and old. Definitely not returning.
Giselle W.,"Atlanta, GA",317,159,110,1.0,9/9/2014,So the bartender Phillip sucks face please don't come here on Tuesday nights or any night Phillip the bartender is working he's rude and makes very weak drinks haven't received my food yet but have yet to see what it's going to be but as a bar I'll never ever come to this Applebee's again. ... so first off we sat at the bar and I ordered a frozen strawberry  margarita with patron he gave me one on the rocks secondly when I told him it was wrong he poured it in ice and made it frozen and it tasted just like water and ice so I ask him to replace it and he didn't use patron like  I asked  so he sucks all around. I've been to 20000 Applebee's and this one is one of the lowest
Janet W.,"Laurel, MD",0,1,1,1.0,4/27/2014,"I had lunch with my son's Saturday April 26,2014 and ordered Riblet basket to go for my husband, before my husband warmed up his food he saw a tick on the broccoli, I called the manger and he basically said they have no ticks. The To Go Box was not opened at all until my husband came home. We were really upset and to top it off it was as though we were lying. I'm calling the health dept first thing in the morning"
Dawn B.,"College Park, MD",0,17,,2.0,6/24/2016,"I understand the restaurant is busy and so the service was going to be slower than I would like. However, there are basics that I cannot overlook.  #1 Where's the silverware?  When the waitresses brought the food, she realized we did not have any utensils.  So, she goes off and brings back 2 forks, 1 knife (my meal had a knife on the plate) and 1 napkin.  Uh, can we get some more napkins?  --did I mention that the waitress who served the order was not the one who took the order?  #2 Where's the Chutney?  I ordered their special Pork Chop with Apple Maple Chutney -- I received a grilled pork chop.  When the waitress finally came by to see how things were (the waitress who took the order not the one who delivered the order), I asked if she saw any Chutney -- she offered to bring me some on the side (ok).  At this point, the meat was getting cooler -- I began to cut it in anticipation of the chutney.  She brought a small condiments cup with a creamy sauce in it.  It looked like thin applesauce -- I tasted it, it tasted like maple syrup.  Not chutney for sure -- maybe they don't know what the chutney is -- even though the picture of this special shows the chutney around the pork chop.  I understand it is not the waitress' fault that they are understaffed, under-trained, and have cooks who do not know what the food is to contain, so I did tip her the normal 15-20%. The management needs to do a better job.  I guess I should have checked ratings of this restaurant, but it used to be good."
Tisha S.,"Capitol Heights, MD",537,341,214,3.0,4/29/2014,Came here for a fundraising event. it was typical Applebee's. nothing to stand out. oh well there was a server who just kept interrupting convos and that we were having or when we was talking to one server he would jump in..
Jessie F.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,245,274,3.0,7/10/2012,"I've been to one of the Applebee's location in California but was not impressed with the food. I eat at this Applebee's location due to lack of good dining options around my hotel. I was hungry so I decided to give it another chance. The server was very new, but he really tried very hard to be helpful which was nice. I had one of the new 550 calories items on the menu. I was not expecting much but was somewhat surprised that the ""sizzling chile lime chicken"" was kind of tasty. The rice was a little dry, but the chicken had decent flavor and the broccoli was cooked well.  The quality of the food was just average, but it's a place you know what to expect when you're on the road and need a place to have a Ok meal."
Maxie M.,"Washington, DC",164,11,,3.0,4/17/2012,"I've been to this Applebee's several times as it's pretty close to my office, and it's always had the same experience: okay food, slow service.  The food is totally normal Applebee's quality, but if you don't have more than an hour to eat lunch, don't bother going here. The servers are generally friendly and have gotten my meal right everytime, it just seems to take forever for the food to actually come out of the kitchen, even when you sit at the bar and order immediately. It's also worth noting that I've never been during rush hour; usually between 2 or 4. Not sure if it would be better or worse during the actual lunch rush."
