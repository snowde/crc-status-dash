Amy V.,"Silver Spring, MD",128,16,19,2.0,6/12/2015,"We were seated for about 10 minutes before the waitress came and when she was taking our order, she was leaning all up on our table and balancing on the table. She never smiled. The chips for the spinach and artichoke dip was too stale. The untensils are disgusting, they weren't properly cleaned. We had to rub lemon on the utensils to clean them, even after getting a second set. Other wise, the food was pretty good."
Glenn J.,"Glen Burnie, MD",31,75,,5.0,7/20/2014,Went here for just a night out dinner we sat at a booth in the bar area are waitress was very nice and good with are order everything came out just as ordered and it was all cooked very good would definitely come back again.
Joss G.,"Washington, DC",18,47,15,5.0,1/17/2014,"Went late evening,  during the week and was seated fairly fast. The new FIT menu is good and staff was polite. Drinks were not bad pretty and had some kick to them. All and all I'll go back to this Applebee's."
Chris W.,"Rockville, MD",0,2,,4.0,5/1/2014,Great service from Iceis she made me write this review and the 2 for 20 was a great deal I had the chicken and shrimp it was very good with the Cajun rice and my girlfriend had the riblet basket and fires food came out fast and the spinach artichoke dip was delicious
O O.,"Washington, DC",4,14,,4.0,12/15/2013,"I was there around 3PM and tried there French Onion Soup, drank it down with a non-alcohol margarita, good combination. People are great at the bar, lots of jokes and a good place to watch the Redskins game with everyone participating with the touchdowns. I highly recommend this restaurant. Good food and good people in the area."
Su K.,"Washington, DC",229,428,582,2.0,8/7/2008,"Eating good (with hard nipples) in the neighborhood. I consider myself a warm-bodied dude, but even I could cut glass after being in here for about 15 minutes last week. Not a good place for a date unless for some odd reason, you want to show her where your nipples are. Food - I usually order the riblets ($10.99). It's mostly bone but the meat isn't too bad - almost good enough to put in those BBQ rib sandwiches from elementary school. The wife ordered the crispy orange chicken bowl ($10.49), which was ok. My favorite dish--and I use the term loosely--is the chicken wing appetizer, which they were out of the last time I went (BOO!). Among the chains in the style of Waiting, Friday's has JD sauce & french onion soup, Ruby Tuesday's has the chocolate tall cake, Bennigan's (RIP) had the Monte Crisco and baked potato soup, but Applebee's doesn't have anything distinctive. Location - Typical Applebee's decor and layout with the A/C on full blast.  In logic-defying fashion, there's generally a wait here after 7p.m. I once came after 9:30 on a Friday and we didn't have a hostess greet us for 10 minutes. We don't know if she ever came b/c we left at that point. I'd recommend eating at 3 Bros., Longhorn, Shane's Rib Shack, and even Shopper's Food Warehouse over this place. Service - It's Applebee's, which mean they're not as kitschy as Friday's but they're just as ""good"" - again, I use the term loosely. I'll give it an extra star b/c the scene from Talladega Nights was decent."
Michael S.,"Silver Spring, MD",19,195,4,1.0,7/31/2010,"Of all the Applebee's in the world, this has to be one of the worst. Customers are noisy, servers are inattentive, and food takes at least 30 minutes to come out. And when it does, it's cold and tasteless. Waited 20 minutes for our appetizers. Waited another 20 for the entrees. Had to remind the server for the check. At least the drinks came out at a decent time. This place wasn't even busy when I went, but our server was still pretty much blind. I think the rest of them were too. The overall experience was just really crappy. Stay away from this place. If they can't have decent service on a Saturday evening, I'm not sure I want to stick around for much longer."
Toni V.,"Washington, DC",8,11,18,1.0,3/19/2013,I'm just not coming back. Food was mediocre and service was wack. I honestly got the impression I was bothering the waiters when I asked for things like my goddamn food and eating utensils.
Latanya B.,"Baltimore, MD",4,8,11,1.0,8/29/2013,It would be nice to actually review the food at this location HOWEVER I was unable to even order food. I called and waited on hold for quite some time to make a to go order. I hung up and went in person instead and was told to wait at the to go desk. I waited for 3 minutes and no one showed. I asked a waitress if anyone worked there and she said they may have went to the restroom. I decided to leave at that point. Will not be visiting them again.
Gregory O.,"Halethorpe, MD",16,208,19,2.0,7/19/2010,"I was actually looking forward to Applebee's, since there aren't any close to where I live. Unfortunately, the meal was very blah and meh.  I have to agree with the other reviewers for the following reasons:  1) My wife got the wrong beverage  2) My wife's soup came out with her entree  3) The french dip sliders were mediocre  4) It took a long time to receive the bill"
Melynda C.,"Westlake Village, CA",107,3,1,5.0,8/18/2012,Isis this the best bartender in this establishment! She is always quick and her drinks are amazing!
Katie M.,"Laurel, MD",13,41,2,1.0,1/11/2012,"Umm, really bad to say the least. I have been here twice, once before dinner when it was super quiet, and once late at night (11 PM) when they had kareoke. Needless to say, it was very loud and like an amateur version of American Idol. As a vegetarian, I tried to order an entree on my latter visit, but none were available automatically vegetarian. I asked the server if it would be possible for me to just remove the chicken from the entree, and he appeared baffled and told me he didn't know if it would be possible. Honestly at that point, I didn't care if he just ate the chicken himself or picked it off the plate before he delivered it! Ordering food with minor alterations should not be that difficult. Once I did get the entree it was a combination of too rich and horribly bland, it definitely sat like a brick in my stomach. Their desserts aren't terrible, but give the whole restaurant a pass if you can. Apparently people love it on Fridays though, based on the turnout that was there."
Sara N.,"Rockville, MD",13,70,,1.0,12/30/2008,"How many vegetarian entrees can you find at Applebee's? Answer: None.  As a result, I did not enjoy my Applebee's experience. TGI Friday's had the 'veggie pasta' option, which I am not a fan of because it forces the veggie inclined to pay $10+ for a dish. (That's even assuming you like pasta). Still, it's better to have that option rather than nothing.  So I was forced to get a cheese quesadilla appetizer (asked for no bacon). It was basically like a pricy, bland cheese sandwich. I actually asked about it and Applebee's 'policy' is that they can take the meat out. Errr... a vegetarian diet is actually not 'the absence of meat'. You can make delectable dishes with the right spices, veggies, and (if you want) cheeses. If anything at least a restaurant can have a veggie burger option, which is apparently a common request.  I'll say one nice thing that the service was good and the manager was empathetic. He spent a while talking to us, which was cool of him. Still, with a policy like that vegetarians apparently don't 'belong at Applebee's'."
R H.,"Beltsville, MD",0,6,,1.0,4/21/2013,"Keep it moving. This place is a dump! I am a woman of color, so this is not about race but it is about the atmosphere created.....Coolio-looking types hanging outside the door and cursing loudly. You will think that I will keep going, right? Greeters looking at you and not welcoming you.  Old, rubber-like chicken that is disgusting. Staff chatting together idly and ignoring customers. Apleebee's should fire the manager or call in Gordon Ramsey, this restaurant should be closed asap."
Ricky J.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,10,,1.0,2/15/2014,"I bought a $50 gift card on Dec 23 & got $10 voucher to be used later. After Christmas, I went there alone for a quick bite, and was seated by a dreadlock waiter and told that he'll be right back. After almost 10 mins of waiting without menu, had to get up & help myself to a menu from a counter, then wait some more for him. Finally when he comes, I told him what I wanted to order & of the $10 voucher. He said not to worry and present it when check comes. I ordered something worth 12 & no drink. Food came in less than 5 mins, spich is very wilty & partially cold, as is the baked potato. Chicken is hard at the edges & rubbery in the middle. Forced myself to have few bites and wanted to pay, but no waiter in sight. I saw few waiters chatting away by counter when there is not a single soul in the whole restaurant, but they could care less than to check on me, when I'm looking around, so I had to get up, wave to them and still walked over to them, as they simply stared in my direction, instead of walking over to me. I asked for the check, which he brought & I gave him my credit card AND THE VOUCHER FOR $10. I got it back in 2 mins, placed on my table. When I opened it, saw that  they had  my cc $14 and not deducted the $10. At this point, since waiter was MIA, I got up, walked ove and asked to speak to the manager, who appeared after another long wait. He mumbled an apology about charge but no explanation about cold, wilty ""food"". He brought me another charge of $4 BUT NO RECEIPT FOR REFUND. He said the printer cant print receipt for refund buut it would show on my cc after few days. It never did and I ended up being charged $18, when I should have been charged $4. NEVER EVER GOING TO THAT PLACE AGAIN. THE FOOD IS HORRIBLE BUT THE SERVICE IS EVEN 10 TIMES WORSE. DONT STAY YOU WERENT WARNED."
Michelle O.,"Bowie, MD",0,1,,1.0,6/29/2013,The service was subpar and the food was just gross. The three Cheese Chicken Penne tasted just like pasta and hot water. I will never enter this establishment again.
Courtney J.,"Laurel, MD",0,1,,1.0,4/21/2013,Absolutely terrible.  We walked in only to be given a dirty look by the hostess who was completely unprofessional and lacked any personality something every hostess should have. Anyway we had a baby with us in our party and she looked at us like we were idiots when we asked for a high chair for the baby. Our waitress also lacked any personality and did not seem very friendly at all. She failed to refill drinks and anytime anything needed to be handled for our table she sent some other guy to do it! The staff was unprofessional yelling across the restaurant at one another! We have been to that Applebees before and had great service by one woman! Needless to say we won't be back unless she is working and we are sat in her section.
