jerry s.,"Avondale, AZ",82,11,,4.0,8/23/2017,"This place has lousy reviews but we tried it anyway  The food was great the service was was polite and friendly  Did not have any problems, will return when in the area"
Joe D.,"Laveen Village, AZ",17,11,18,4.0,11/26/2017,Went there for Thanksgiving it was my third time there. It was clean and the staff was very friendly. I tend to go in the afternoon or early evening on weekends each time I have been there and it hasn't been crowded. Thanksgiving dinner was really tasty.
Amy B.,"Tolleson, AZ",12,28,14,4.0,11/28/2017,"First visit here, the service was great and the server Felicia was very friendly and attentive.  Tables and lobby were clean, but the ladies room could use some work.  The food came out in a timely fashion the way we ordered it.  I had the peppercorn steak with grains from the lighter fare menu and Ben had a 6 oz sirloin.  Mine didn't look exactly like the picture so I was worried, however it tasted wonderful and Felicia took the time to answer questions about the types of grains in the dish. I would definitely come here again."
Aby G.,"LAVEEN, AZ",39,20,1,4.0,10/27/2017,This Applebees always has friendly staff.  The price is amazing with the $1 margaritas till the end oof the month and the half price appetizers.  The people and vibe in this Applebees is always upbeat and welcoming.  Two great appetizers to try are the boneless wings and the chicken wontons. If you live in Laveen this is a great place for Happy Hour !
Erika G.,"Laveen Village, Phoenix, AZ",31,12,1,4.0,10/27/2017,Great Price's! Fun people! The staff is usually very and honest. If you ask them what is good they will tell you they let you know about specials. Cristi is a great bar tender she will make you laugh she is very attentive. It's a fun place to go most of the time people are friendly. This is a great place to go!
Carrie G.,"Phoenix, AZ",39,22,40,3.0,9/12/2017,"This was not my first visit here but this trip was annoying. I use carside service on most visits. I usually wait about 3-5 minutes before someone comes out but I can see them acknowledging my existence and getting my food. This time I sat for 10 minutes and saw no one checking outside (it's dark and my headlights shine right in the door). The manager even came out the carside door as I was getting out of my car and kept walking to the back of the building. Alrighty. After asking the hostess if carside service was available she went to ask about my food. The manager came back with it. Yes. The same one who saw me get out of my car. He told me my total, walked away with my card and offered no apology or acknowledgement that anything was wrong. I left angrier at the whole place and thinking that maybe I just don't understand how carside service is supposed to work. And my husbands chicken was dry when I got it home.  It's not that I'm lazy. I'm not. But if I'm not prepared to go into a restaurant, my attire might reflect those of pajamas and it's annoying to be put in that situation with no remorse from the staff."
Francisco R.,"Laveen Village, AZ",0,2,,1.0,10/22/2017,Went yesterday 10/21 with my family of seven and was expecting for there to be a wait time since we went on a Saturday and we were fine with that. The problem came when after 20 minutes or so another party of 6 comes in and they start complaining of wanting to be seated. The two greeters AND the manager  told them that my party was ahead of them and they would seat them in 20 minutes tops. After the other party kept complaining they got seated before my party. I then ask to speak to the same manager and ask him why this happened and I get told that he doesn't have an answer to that. By the time we got seated we had waited for over 40 minutes after the party that came after us got seated. Just a word of advice if you do decide to go here you should complain you will be seated a whole lot faster then if you are not a complainer like i was.
Becca N.,"Phoenix, AZ",54,414,33,3.0,4/25/2017,Not bad. Standard Applebees's sit down restaurant  and bar. Hostess didn't know any menu items really at all. Our server wasn't very talkative but kept our glasses full. Seat was freshly wiped when we were seated. No knives til we asked. Could probably have just used their digital system and left but weren't really informed of that until the very end. We are so use to a paper check.
Zerik G.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,1.0,10/10/2017,"Ordered my steak medium well. Steak had blood on the inside and was bright red. Told them I ordered medium well there response ""that's medium well to our chef"""
Erica M.,"Phoenix, AZ",219,35,21,2.0,10/11/2017,I'm giving this place a 2 star simply because if it wasn't for the server working the tables around the bar actually listening to me and helping me this place would get a zero. The bar tender sucks. She's not intuitive to all her customers. She defiantly has her regulars that she tends to more. But let's face it. Regulars around the ages of 21-25 don't tip well. She never asked me how my meal was but that one waiter has actually attended to me more by just walking around this u shape bar. I came in to eat dinner and drink a hot tatee cause I don't feel good and this is the service I receive. I'm an out of towner to. And get this she never carded me. I always get carded cause I look like I'm 20. Yeah so what I'm 30. I ALWAYS get carded. And this woman doesn't even know me. I even had to grab pepper off of another table. The no meat no chz salad that I ordered too was so ice cold. The plate was even ice. It hurt my teeth eating it. My mouth was frozen. I took only two bites and had brain freeze thereafter. After a long day of work to this. Sorry Applebee's get it together. Back home our Applebee's is the shit. This place has great servers but a damn horrible bartender. She will not be tipped for she didn't wait on me. Noah is getting my tip and should be the bar tender cause he is way more personable.
Fabiola G.,"Laveen Village, AZ",0,2,,1.0,9/17/2017,We used the be regulars but they have terrible service now. Bartenders are all new and don't know what to do. This Adriana chick has three customers and is terrible. She doesn't know how to take care of few customers she has but can dance and run to vape.  Service has gone done and managers don't deserve anything to improve either. Won't be returning with Adriana working to give her a third opportunity take my money else where!
Celeste C.,"Tucson, AZ",26,29,14,5.0,5/15/2017,"I come often for happy hour to get 1/2 off wings. Great service. My waitress Ellen M.  was very nice! I ordered boneless medium wings and fries. The food tasted good and came out fast. It is always cold in here though, so bring a jacket."
Julie M.,"Glendale, AZ",46,24,31,2.0,4/24/2017,"This might have been a three if the entire experience matched up to the prices on their menu. But it doesn't. Applebee's is not an in expensive place to eat. They're fairly pricey. And for that high price our silverware Service included a single fork each and a single thin paper napkin each. Really Applebee's? You can't give me a knife fork and spoon? And more than one see-through napkin? I did ask for a knife and he did bring one but he wanted to know for each of us individually... really? And nice of you to have a catchup bottle on the table too bad it was empty and we had to walk halfway across the restaurant to get another one.  The food was OK. The service was OK. But I think it's unacceptable to pay $14 for fish and chips and then not get a full set of silverware, more than one napkin and a catchup bottle with catchup actually in it.  And really... Just keep my water glass full.  If we had depression era shortages I get it but you're charging an arm and a leg and I should not have to ask for every single scrap of anything in the restaurant...."
Tara B.,"Phoenix, AZ",36,1,,1.0,2/18/2017,Such an awful experience. Food is terrible and service is even worse. My shrimp was gray so i sent it back and asked for a menu to order something else.. and i didnt recieve and menu until my entire table was  finished eating. Long story short i took my business else where.
Mayan X.,"Paradise Valley, AZ",31,121,9,2.0,8/25/2016,"Last time i was here they were playing oldies. And some old man that looked like a retired gang member was singing to it ... drunk. Thats when i decided to start going to the bars in downtown phoenix.  The food is as expected. Good. I have not had a bad meal there, just bad service."
Britt C.,"Phoenix, AZ",95,123,584,2.0,12/29/2015,"I have to admit. The commercials touting Applebee's new menu got me. I haven't been to an Applebee's for probably 10 years. But the commercials were intriguing. Had Applebee's really changed their menu to remain competitive with changing tastes & to compete with newer fast casual restaurants that aren't chains?  The answer is yes, but it's not impressive enough to turn the chain around. My date ordered a beer- IPA for him that was flat, and I got a glass of Cabernet (8oz for $6 and was decent) then we each had soup- French onion for me, chicken tortilla for him- and it came out piping hot and was delicious. By far best part of dinner. For our main course we both had steak- he got the 7oz sirloin with a baked potato and veggies, and I got the Shrimp & Parmesan sirloin. They came out warm, not hot. The cheese on the shrimp was a solid mess, not the melty kind indicated in menu picture. Garlic mashed potatoes were terrible- nothing garlic about them and also just warm with giant chunks of potatoes in them. My sirloin was actually good- soft and melted in my mouth. Not tough at all and cooked accurately according to the menu (pink all the way through, warm center). My date complained his steak was tough.  Service was just ok. We had to ask for silverware twice and wait to eat our main courses (maybe why it was warm?) until we got them. Server wasn't readily available, but we also didn't really need help that often.  If Applebee's wants to compete with other fast casual restaurants, they will need to represent their menu more accurately, work on faster food expediting, and evolve their wine and beer menu. Only 2 red wine choices? Most beers on tap were domestics- Bud, Coors, PBR, Miller Lite... Only one craft beer & it was flat.  Will we be back? I'm not sure. With so many other options, I'm willing to pay more for better."
Jeongwha H.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,26,25,1.0,3/10/2017,Very bad service and food for higher price. I am surprised they are still open. We went three times- service and food were awful. Don't waste your times and money on this join. I don't think I ever seen anyone working there- even manager was talking and hanging out. No more.......
Liezel A.,"Kaneohe, HI",347,46,367,4.0,1/25/2015,We have our family dinner before we left to go back Hawaii.  The wait was so and so because we had a big party. Love the specials they have for dinner but the amount of food is a little. The deserts was a plus.   I'm a sweet tooth and I fell in love with desert over there.  The sad thing my brother food is over cook but  glad they didn't charge us and offer free dessert. Love the customer services. Thanks for fixing the problem.
Megan S.,"Clarksville, TN",103,28,6,1.0,2/24/2016,"This is an understatement. I work in the industry and communication is key even when you don't want to tell your customers there is a wait.... Patchy service from our bartender but it's applebees they're always understaffed so there's usually only a bartender at any location.  My friend and I played their trivia games to keep us entertained because apparently conversations from your bartender is forbidden. Two other people had their food before us and sat down after us. Each complained about their food.  An hour after we ordered still sitting there becoming hangry I asked the bartender to just refund our food and we'd pay for our drinks. She seemed very frazzled and I don't blame her.  The bartender and manager apologized but the manager wanted to argue with me about why there was a wait.... Apparently their computer systems were down and there's no such thing as paper tickets or communication with back of house. Sorry, I won't be back."
Natalie W.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,1,5.0,4/14/2016,"Annastasia, our waitress, was absolutely wonderful and accommodating for our hungry, impatient toddler!  Food was goood. But our service was great! Thanks Annastasia!"
Deborah S.,"Peoria, AZ",6,9,,1.0,4/1/2017,For the third plus time (shame on us) we sat for over :10 minutes with no one even asking if we want water. Good thing more restaurants are opening up near here. This place blows.
Marie E.,"Laveen Village, AZ",60,5,,2.0,6/20/2016,"The food is inconsistent.  I've ordered beef too many times and have not been happy.  I sent it back once because it was overcooked.  I asked for it medium rare/pink in the middle.  It wasn't pink.  The waiter tried to tell me it was. Except for the one time the waiter told me my meat was cooked to order, the wait staff has been friendly, We usually go here because it's close and convenient."
Alexiana L.,"Laveen Village, AZ",32,3,,1.0,5/18/2017,All I have to say is if you do NOT! Enjoy working somewhere please don't work there. People work hard for their money to go out and do things and have a little fun! Not so it can be ruined with a bartenders poor attitude. Another thing is that I'm so disappointed with applebees come on be reason and respect your customers and at least pretend your worried about their safety. There was a drunk person at the bar harassing other people there all in their face and using racial slurs! When does the manager take charge and call authorities and remove this person? Oh wait they would have never don't that because they were too busy pouring the person drink after drink. I'm al for a good time but applebees needs to remember that there's crazy people in this world and a fight could have broken out or even worse. Very disappointed and never going back. And don't recommended anyone to go unless your looking for drama and poor service.
Tee W.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,5,,1.0,5/9/2017,If I could give this place no stars I would!!!! First I come in with my family they have us waiting 20mins before anyone ever came to our table. So that instantly made me upset!!!! How rude and unprofessional remind you there where waitresses walking pass and never even acknowledged us. So after waiting those 20mins we finally get to order our food and drinks from the bar. Our drinks from the bar where watered down no taste our food was horrible we paid left and will never return. Such a horrible experience........if I owned a restaurant I would've never make someone feel like they don't even exist or feed them horrible food and drinks. Never again!!!!
Jozie L.,"Buena Park, CA",569,301,334,4.0,7/2/2013,"I almost feel strange giving this Applebee's a favorable review. Judging from previous reviews local residents hate this place, but I feel compelled to be honest. We were in town visiting. Decided to have an early Saturday night dinner. Pleasant looking restaurant. Inside the air conditioning did catch our attention. 120 degrees outside contrasted sharply with near 70 degrees inside. Brr-rrr-rrrr . . . But that wasn't a negative. Didn't take long to get used to the frigid atmosphere. After a pleasant greeting we were seated and within minutes our server took drink orders. Lemonade and ice tea arrived right away. Received a new lemonade from our attentive waitress when my glass emptied. We ordered Steak and Shrimp combo, Won Ton Tacos and Lettuce Wedge topped with Green Goddess dressing sprinkled with toasted Pecan & Bacon bits. Tasty shrimp. Tough steak. Tacos and lettuce to die for. We'll order the noteworthy appetizers again and again. Nice flavor, fresh and light."
Daniel O.,"Phoenix, AZ",93,49,,3.0,1/28/2016,Hit or miss each time...  I've had 5 star visits and 1 star visits here. Food wise it is very consistent.. Service wise amazing or just plain horrible!
Amanda J.,"Phoenix, AZ",37,38,22,1.0,8/4/2015,"I stopped eating at Apple Bees awhile ago not due to this location but due to other poor service and very poor food quality. I have seen lately that Apple Bees is trying to revamp and do more of a pub style menu which i think is good so my husband and i decided to give it another chance and see if it has improved...  Unfortunately everything about my dinner experience yesterday sucked..  First off the waitress was like a walking zombie, NO Personality what so ever. Didnt greet us, didnt tell us any thing about new items on the menu. Not a single smile. She CLEARLY wanted to be anywhere but work and we were obviously a huge inconvience to her evening... It made us feel very uncomfortable.  My chicken was over cooked and dry as a bone! I asked for ranch three times before the waitress remembered to bring it. My husband ordered a margarita and it came in a martini glass.. With an olive?.. It was strange and his burger was over cooked and flavorless.. Overall I was disappointed.. But really the awful and awkward service was the worst thing.. We were very uncomfortable around her. def won't be back. ."
Brian B.,"LAVEEN, AZ",1,9,,1.0,2/18/2017,"So went to Applebee's on 51st Ave last night to have some drinks and appetizers with two friends and got cut off by the manager after 3 rounds! None of us were driving as we had previously arranged for rides home and we explained that to the 'I've only been here 72 hours' new manager from Maine. Before he cut us off he came to our table introduced himself, shook our hands, and chatted with us regarding establishments being liable for serving patrons too much. We totally agreed and explained that's why all 3 of us were drop off and will be picked up at the end of the evening.  Long and short been there and received horrible service many times before so I would give them 6 months before returning and see if the improved but I think this  was it for me. Finished the evening at the Greathouse and had a blast, great drinks, food, and service."
Chrissy A.,"Goodyear, AZ",13,16,1,2.0,6/15/2015,"I work right by this Applebee's. I come here for lunch out of convenience. We just had lunch here today. Ordered chicken quesadilla appetizer for 9.99 and cheese sticks 7.99. The quesadilla came with 4 small quarter pieces. The cheese sticks came with 4 sticks. That is it. Price increase and portion size drop substantially. This is Applebee's. Not a high end place. There are way better places to eat then here at these prices. Ridiculous. Oh top it off, I open my napkin to dirty silverware with a fork that looks like it was used to dig a garden. All crooked. Not impressed and won't be back."
Jeff B.,"Phoenix, AZ",39,328,174,4.0,7/10/2014,"First time at this Applebee's. Had trepidation about the service, based on previous reviews. Service was just fine, with quick seating, friendly greeting and just the right amount of attention.  My wife ordered the Seasonal Berry and Spinach Salad and wine while I had the 4 Cheese Mac & Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders and a Strawberry Lemonade.  The salad was fresh and light but they forgot the pecans. My wife always likes crunch with her salads, so that was a key missing piece for her.  My entree was tasty but needed help. The cheese sauce was so thin that it didn't cling to the pasta. Also the chicken was SO sweet that the flavor of the chicken (and pasta) got lost. The breadstick was a nice touch, as it was very similar to the mouth watering Olive Garden bread. Not a bad meal, just needed some tweaking to the recipe.  We will try Applebee's again, but not the Mac 'N Chicken."
Scherie B.,"Laveen Village, AZ",165,36,29,1.0,2/4/2016,The food has to be prepackaged. There is nothing fresh about any of the food. Even the drinks seem to be prepackaged. It's gross and way to commercialized. I won't waste my money here ever again
Caroline R.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,33,4,2.0,5/23/2015,"Since we can't get Caso Dip any more we got chips & salsa. I've had MUCH  better salsa out of plastic jars. Yuck. The green was better but both were extremely gringo mild.  The meals, were ok. But we miss a lot of the menu items we used to love. It's close to home & not crowded anymore so sometimes its a place for a meal &  quick beer on Saturday night when you can't get a seat at the good places."
Andrew H.,"Phoenix, AZ",34,20,1,1.0,3/18/2016,"God this place sure has went down hill. Waited over and hour for food and all I ordered was unlimited soup and salad and a ""large"" lol house steak. Ive seen beef jerky out of a bag thats bigger then their large house steak. Lol"
Dot B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,6,,1.0,10/22/2015,"This is the worst Applebee's! This was the second time me being here and their customer service is the worst.  My family and I waited ten minutes expecting to be seated, waitress makes eye contact but completely ignores the fact that we are there. I walked up to the manager told her we had been waiting, instead of apologizing for the wait and walking us to a table she goes out of her way to have a talk with a waitress. I was agitated and never will I come here!"
M D.,"LAVEEN, AZ",144,42,59,4.0,10/23/2013,"Ok...here goes: We ordered the appetizer sampler and EVERYTHING WAS JUST RIGHT!! We have all had that one platter where some stuff is under-cooked and the rest mediocre, right? Not this time... My son ordered the Quesidilla Burger...nice presentation, I wish I had thought to snap pics before we all started. He said it was cooked just right. My mother had a turkey & avocado sandwich with fries...huge sandwich that I seriously doubt she will finish. (Great--there's lunch). I ordered something from the low calorie selections...don't remember it's name, but it had a steak, potatoes, stuffed portabello mushroom cap with spinach and Parmesan cheese. It tasted great. Overall I gave it 4 stars only because  1) the air was cranked up and I was cold most of the time 2) my plate didn't look as appetizing as it tasted..again steak was well seasoned 3) the calorie counts were on a sheet that the server had to bring to me....overdue for them to have all of that info ON THE MENU. But I will certainly come again!"
Nancy C.,"Phoenix, AZ",15,35,7,2.0,1/11/2015,"Got a snack with my husband here to hang out someplace pleasant but remembered why we don't like Applebee's. Nice environment but the food is awful. Got the onion rings and spinach dip with chips. Dip was good but the chips were old and the oil had gone rancid. Really? Get some fresh chips people!  The onion rings were factory made, frozen and cooked. They were all fried batter and cardboardy. The barbecue dip tasted like pancake syrup with coloring, garlic and smoky flavoring. We asked for Ranch dip and it tasted like something out of a packet from McDonalds. Nope. If you want real food don't go here."
Elisha G.,"Phoenix, AZ",168,73,70,5.0,10/23/2014,I am in town on a business trip and this place is awesome. The prices are wonderful as are the drinks. The quality of the food is wonderful as is the service that is provided. They are open late and even have karaoke! This will surely be a go to spot when I am in town for now on.
Ruben A. G.,"Laveen Village, AZ",0,4,5,4.0,7/1/2015,The manager Brenda and our waitress Erika exceeded customer service going over and beyond! All made for a pleasant dining experience.
Carla W.,"Laveen Village, AZ",0,3,,1.0,9/10/2016,"Lately they have been doing a little better. But the last time I was there the server got our order wrong and the hostess was eating the extra entree they brought to our table right next to us, as she was going back and forth catching up on gossip with another server."
Francisco P.,"Glendale, AZ",0,42,1,3.0,8/28/2016,"Not really bad, not really good either. The waitress was surprised I asked what cuts of steak they had, it so happens they only serve top sirloin, and it's not one of the best cuts, because it's not a marbled steak. Garlic fries were great. Service: Waitress was ok, but she wasn't really attentive or friendly(although she wasn't rude). They need to understand that we as customers don't know the menu, it's their job to be helpful."
