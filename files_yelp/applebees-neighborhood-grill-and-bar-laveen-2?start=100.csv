Angela E.,"Mackinaw, IL",6,20,5,4.0,11/8/2010,My husband and I have been here twice since moving to Laveen in July 2010.  Both times we had good waitstaff and both times we happened to arrive during the early evening happy hour and ordered 1/2 price drinks and appetizers.  The food and drinks were both good.  This is a typical Applebee's but unlike several of the past reviewers we have yet to experience bad service here.  We would probably come here more during the 1/2 price timeframes but we like to try to experience more local restaurants too.  We will definitely be making more trips here in the future.

Eric D.,"Maricopa, AZ",0,14,1,3.0,7/28/2009,"Typical Applebee's, nothing special. The service is pretty good; it has drastically improved over the last year. Happy Hour specials (1/2 off appetizers & drinks) seem to be a bargain. Perfect place if you're looking for something fairly cheap in Laveen and don't want to make dinner at home."
