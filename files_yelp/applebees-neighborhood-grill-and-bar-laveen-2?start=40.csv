Debra M.,"Laveen Village, AZ",1,11,,3.0,1/25/2016,"It's okay. Not bad, always busy so you never know what your food or service will be like."
George M.,"Laveen Village, AZ",15,7,4,5.0,8/12/2014,Great service! people are real friendly. Always have my drink filled  Great music in background Plenty of TV to watch games Management looks like they are involved and helping
Sandra R.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,48,,2.0,7/25/2015,Not as good as it used to be. The food has gone down in quality in the past few months.  Not sure if management has changed or what has happened.  Staff is usually friendly but it seems they are understaffed.
Uni T.,"Phoenix, AZ",84,45,,3.0,7/15/2015,I give it three stars simply on the service.  Nice folks and attentive.  Truthfully I am not a fan of Applebee's food is meh and honestly I have to look at the menu a million times before I settle.
Fav s.,"Laveen, AZ",0,2,,1.0,5/15/2016,"This Applebees has horrible service, had a drink waitress took our order like 3 times; manager took our drink orders and still we waited for over 45 minutes for drinks, finally we get our drinks, we order food, and we get our bill, we were charged for alcohol drinks as many times as they took the order... Bad service including management."
Julie C.,"Laveen Village, AZ",4,19,8,4.0,10/19/2015,Good place for a beer and cocktail. Open late too so good when most places are closing. Try the triple pork threar sandwich. Yum.
Ashley A.,"Laveen Village, AZ",0,7,,1.0,4/17/2014,The only reason they are getting 1 star is because you can't select 0 .... But their service here is absolutely HORRIBLE!!  We sat for 15 minutes with no one coming for our drink order even after going to the bar to ask for a waiter we waited another 5 minutes and all they did was stare at us.. Needless to say we got up and left . Spend your money some where else!
Dina G.,"Laveen Village, AZ",13,21,5,1.0,1/27/2016,"Service is hit or miss. Have been to this place a hand full of times. Received good service twice and bad service thee times. Steak was good, chicken salad awe full. Music was good. Will not be going back. Don't like Russian roulette with eateries."
Brooke F.,"Avondale, AZ",0,2,,1.0,1/25/2016,My husband and I just moved on this side of town and have ordered from this applesbees 3 time. The first time they got our order wrong and we had to drive back. The second time they got our order wrong and we had to drive back. And here now the 3rd and final time they got our order wrong and I am not even going to send my husband back we are just not going to order from them any more. Let's get it together applesbees. A rack of ribs and some fiesta lime chicken is not to complicated.
Sokuanthia R.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",24,3,,1.0,5/2/2015,I wanted  to give  it half a star. Service bad my food looks nasty and blt sandwich  doesn't  look  very appealing .  Bad bad bad.. but im hungry  and and its freaking  hot outside .  So i don't  have a choice  but let  my  kids  eat  and get the hell out asap. Never  again  i wanna  set foot  in this place .  Makes all the other  Applebee's  look bad.
Maribel C.,"Phoenix, AZ",47,1,,1.0,8/2/2014,"Service was really slow and our server didn't attend us much. Chips were stale and dip was cold. We got an incomplete appetizer plate. Our table was filled with empty glasses of water and plates because server wouldn't pick them up. Took 10 minutes to get a drink refill. Server didn't know the difference between the diet drink and regular that she had in her hand, so she sniffed the drink and gave us the wrong one.  Never again am I going to this location, it has been the worst service ever."
Ann L.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,15,4,1.0,5/29/2015,This Applebee's seems to think it is a night club at 430 at night music is blasting food is mediocre at best  time for new management the foxes are running the hen house
April V.,"Phoenix, AZ",67,55,31,1.0,2/6/2015,"Typically I have have always had a mediocre experience at this Applebees. This time however was probably the worst I have experience so far. I do not expect much out of this location however anything worse then my typical experience is unacceptable.  Wait time: anytime I go it's usually between 5 and 6 so the wait time is usually always around 15 minutes. This time the wait time was the same but the greeter didn't even greet me with a Hello welcome to Applebees.  Instead I had to go up to her and ask her to put my name down. Waitress: After being seated we didn't see our waitress for another 10 minutes.  This means we didn't even order our drinks yet. Finally when she made an appearance we gave her our drink order, ice tea and sprite. Took another 10 minutes.  Food: I get the same thing every time, steak and veggies. My 6 year old daughter got the 4 ounce steak from the kids menu. Medium rare for both of us. Took about 15 mins to get our food which was typical... but this time my steak looked like one of those processed steaks. Like the kind you buy in the bag at the grocery store precooked. It was done med well. My daughters 4 ounce steak, which looked like a small hockey puck,  was rarer than mine.  My steak tasted funny, I couldn't even finish it all. And it comes with seasonal veggies which happens to be broccoli,  ALL YEAR ROUND.  Half way through eating I was done with my ice tea awaiting a refill that never came. When we were done eating we waited for about another 15 mins for our waiting who I had not seen for at least 25 mins prior. I had to ask the buss boy to get her for me. My daughter really wanted desert and it was out date night so I agreed even though I just wanted to leave at this point. When our waitress finally came around I gave her the order we got the dessert soon after, and then we did some more for her to come back around so we could get the check. 10 minutes goes by again and she finally chose her face and asked if we want the check.  I did overhear her talking with the table behind us saying that she only started about a week ago, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to she was new. I still gave her a $5 tip on a 30 dollar bill only because of this reason. All in all I do not think I will go to this location again not so much because of the experience I had with the waitress but more on the food was less than mediocre this time and I couldn't even finish it."
V W.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,65,,1.0,9/7/2015,"Horrible lunch service yesterday. SLLLOOOOOWWW. Took over 30 minutes to get our orders, three of which were wrong. No pico, they added pico. Add bacon? They forgot. Med Well burger, it was pink. The restaurant was dead so I have no idea what was going on in the back but Manager was uninterested. Will NOT be back."
Cj K.,"Laveen Village, AZ",0,1,,4.0,5/1/2015,"I really enjoyed my dinner this evening at Applebee's in Laveen. I ate at the bar since I was alone and boy what a great idea that turned out to be! The bartender, Paxton, not only served one of the best dinners I've eaten in a while (peppered steak from the pub diet menu, high in protein, low in calories) but he also kept me entertained. All employees were working quickly, efficiently and were having fun doing it!     If it's been a while since you've been to Appkebe's, go back! Enjoy! lkk."
Tabetha S.,"Flagstaff, AZ",7,16,1,1.0,8/23/2014,"Horrendous and unfriendly service. Came in tonight as we had wanted Applebee's for some time now and thought it would be a good experience. The waitress was rude and short with us and everything but friendly. I get it, working in food service sucks but there's a reason you're working there. If you hate it then do something about it, don't treat your customers who determine your tip like crap. We will NEVER be going back here even if it is minutes from our home. How disappointing."
Rew P.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,17,2,1.0,3/20/2015,"I would always go on Friday for bone in hot wings and a cold beer.  They changed their wings to breaded and raised the price.  I sorry but they are nasty.  I don't know why these companies keep changing a basic item like wings, I guess they are looking for new customers...it's just dumb to turn your back on the ones you already have. If i wanted something different I would have gone somewhere else now you are forcing me to.  My wife would always go with me so they lost two customers just not one.  I think with tip I would spend about $2000 a year. Dumb dumb dumb.  At least I don't have to listen to my wife bitch about dirty silverware anymore."
Heidi W.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,8,,3.0,11/27/2015,"We went there recently. The steak I ordered was terrible so they cooked me another one, which was just as bad as the first one, so I switched to chicken instead. The manager was nice and took my meal off for us. However, it wasn't a good experience because they had to cook my food 3 times before they got it right! However, the appetizer wings were excellent - try the thai peanut wings - they're awesome!!"
Tavaro M.,"Phoenix, AZ",22,12,4,1.0,6/4/2013,"Im a huge applebees fan, only the happy hour tho lol.  I have been to alot around the valley and i just moved to laveen, and this one is the best one i have ever been to. this place is 2.3 miles away from man that's just amazing.... Not amazing anymore. Place has gone down hill"
Kym H.,"Laveen Village, AZ",34,6,,3.0,12/12/2014,"Ate here the other night, neighborhood spot. They now have jukebox and music was so loud we were at table in the bar closest to the juke box, don't recommend if your going to communicate don't sit at that table or near it. Service great food worth the money."
