Shannon R.,"Laveen, AZ",6,13,2,1.0,8/24/2014,"I would give this location zero stars if I could. I sat there for over 20 minutes as 5 servers helped the people around me, including folks who got sat after me and not once did any of them acknowledge my presence. It was not busy at all. I ended up walking out. I won't ever return here due to the terrible service."
Sharon T.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,6,,1.0,11/3/2015,"I sat for almost 10 minutes before my server came to my table. She stomped over like I was interrupting her day. She didn't introduce herself or ask if I was ready she just stood there with a scowl. Then every time she walks by me she glares at me. She smiled and joked with a couple behind me but she super sucks. The lady who greeted me was so nice and so was the lady who brought my food out. But the server is rude, her shirt is filthy, and completely inattentive."
Anitra H.,"LAVEEN, AZ",3,4,,1.0,3/30/2014,After reading the reviews written by others...I can't help but to think that at least it wasn't just us. Service is OK but the food is very hit or miss. When I moved to the Laveen area; I was glad that there was a recognizable restaurant so close to home but our first visit resulted in a glass/plastic shard in one of our entrees (salad). So we didn't go back for a long time but when we did; again the food was just poor. The 3rd time got us another salad issue (brown wilted lettuce) and a chicken entrée with rubbery rice. I think 3x is enough is say that this Applebee's is just never going to be a good place to eat.
Brian N.,"Phoenix, AZ",30,43,8,5.0,12/17/2011,"Meal came quick, hot and very friendly service. Got seated immediately."
Dave A.,"Phoenix, AZ",24,14,2,1.0,1/18/2014,Poor management and not at all customer friendly. Waited 20 minutes last night while seven empty tables stacked with dirty plates not cleared to make room for new customers. Left hungry and disgusted. We went across street to Native New Yorker where we were immediately greeted and given a table and drinks served quickly. The food and atmosphere was exceptional!  This Applebee's location lost my business and my respect. If I could rate zero stars I would.
Chris B.,"Laveen, AZ",1,1,,1.0,3/16/2014,"Horrible place to go, waited for seats and when we did get seated, we waited. No one took our drink orders, we had to ask for our waiter and she just walked right past us. I seen enough waiters to help but I seen one person working and it look like the manager. Poor Service, last time I'll ever go there"
E M.,"Laveen Village, AZ",0,18,3,1.0,7/8/2014,The service was horrible. From the general manager to our waiter. Our food was cold. It was not busy at all. The worst of it all is that it stinks when you walk in to the waiting area before you reach the hostess station to be seated. I will not go back. So sad we only have a few restaurants of this type in Laveen and this one sucks!
Mike C.,"Laveen Village, AZ",0,15,1,1.0,5/20/2015,"I used to frequent this joint but after the menu change, no thanks! No happy hours wing and the service is crappy. Go out of business and let Chili's take over."
Symantha E.,"Gilbert, AZ",72,3,7,1.0,1/23/2014,Terrible service from bartender. Order a perfect margarita came out tasting like water sent it back he says it will taste the same have her order something else. Fool I can hear you sorry ass. Will be taking my business up the street. Damn I loved this place crystal or server was outstanding. Manager is an asshole too.
Kelly O.,"Laveen Village, AZ",1,4,,1.0,4/20/2016,"Horrible....just horrible!  Three of us were sat in the bar at 7:45pm.  The music from the juke box was very loud. During our dinner we asked three times if the music could be turned down a bit.  We realize it's the bar, but we were yelling at each other across the table due to the music volume!  Our waitress took our drink order, delivered outlet drinks quickly, took our food order, then never came back to our table.  An appetizer was delivered quickly by another server, then shortly two of our entrees were delivered by yet another server.  The third entree wasn't delivered and out waitress was no where to be found.  After another 10 or so minutes, I flagged a bartender down and asked to have the last meal checked on.  Finally our server showed at our table and explained that another server had taken the entree to another table.  She apologized and took another 8 to 10 minutes to bring out the meal.  Meanwhile the two of us were done eating.  You, as well as us were wondering why we were never checked on after the first meals were delivered.  None of us will return to this location."
Jason H.,"Phoenix, AZ",34,26,19,1.0,12/5/2013,2/$24 deal sucked! I got the Cajun shrimp pasta. Noodles were old and were like eating cardboard. Server had bad attitude when I told him my food was not good at all. Boneless chicken wings were good. That's the only + I can give this place. Thi is my second time eating here since moving to Laveen. I won't be returning. GARBAGE FOOD!
Mark S.,"Glendale, AZ",0,1,,1.0,11/22/2014,"The food was terrible, and service was terrible. We were charged for food that we were never served nor ever ordered."
Amanda S.,"Phoenix, AZ",69,153,,1.0,2/25/2011,"Been there twice. First time we were served cold food very late and they couldn't seem to remember that we might want our drinks refilled while we waited over an hour for our food.  And our food was not ""sat too long"" cold, it was ""didn't bother cooking your shrimp"" cold. Second time we were greeted nicely, sat down in the same section, and FIFTEEN minutes later had not given our drink order or even been looked at.  The waiter AND waitress for that section both walked by numerous times. FORGET IT.   We left.  Smiled at the hostess and said we had yet to be seen. Last trip to that Applebee's."
Zipporah I.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,1,1.0,5/6/2015,"From the moment we entered the restaurant all were dumbfounded on how they were going to accommodate us. It was 2 adults and 5 children. Myself and my kids were visiting from San Diego looking for our final meal before hitting the road. Food came out separately instead of serving us all at once we ate in tandem. My kids food was not right. So much confusion on making the Margarita right, seating us in the restaurant versus the bar....umm no we have children with us we want to sit in the restaurant. This for me was a horrible experience. I will not be returning to any Applebee's anywhere."
Kyle B.,"Phoenix, AZ",127,26,6,1.0,1/19/2013,"Local residents in a small town 30 minutes south west of downtown Phoenix are ecstatic about the new changes that have been taking place at their local Applebee's in Laveen, Arizona. Super Official News stopped by the restaurant this weekend to investigate further what's making this hot spot so popular. Restaurant manager Paul Horner explained just a few of the exciting changes that have been happening. ""Every Friday and Saturday while we have our live Jimmy Buffet tribute band or gangster rap playing at full volume over the speakers from 3pm-2am, during breaks in the music, I've been letting my 8-year old son bang on his drum set that I just bought him for his birthday last month,"" Horner said. ""We also just got two new microwaves to cook all the food that is on the menu. We named them 'Chef 1 and 'Chef 2, Horner laughs. ""Preparing your steak how you want it will now be easier than ever! We also changed out the drainage system around the bar area so it doesn't smell like urine and human feces as much anymore."" Local resident Michael Spielman says he just loves the new changes at the Applebee's in Laveen. ""They repaved the parking lot and I even heard they added new insulation to the roof of the building. Also, they have installed new air conditioning vents above every table that blow out the coldest air you've ever felt in your entire life. It's like traveling to Antarctica, but you're actually in Laveen! How cool is that, no pun intended,"" Spielman laughs. ""Also I noticed there is more free mints and toothpicks when I walk in. Rip-roaring good times have come to Laveen!"" Gerald Byrnes who has been a server since the restaurant opened two years ago gave us some inside information on the appetizers and beverages. ""No longer will our cold rubbery cheese sticks and alcoholic beverages that have no alcohol in them take an hour to arrive at your table. We have cut all our times down to 50 minutes or less or you get another alcoholic beverage with no alcohol in it free of charge! How awesome is that!"" Horner was more than happy to explain their new menus and additional usages. ""Instead of 7-9 different menus per person we are now giving each diner 19 different menus of various sizes and colors to browse through. It will all be the same food but now just more spread out to make things more fun,"" Horner said. ""Also to keep our customers safe, we are upgrading the menus to a type of plastic recently invented by NASA that has corners that can cut through glass. If the need ever comes up to fight off an attacker, our menus will work better than a machete."" Assistant manager Joyce Barth explained some of the other exciting new changes that have been made to improve the restaurant. ""Our greeters and servers will no longer speak urban slang and other forms of language that make it difficult to understand when trying to order food,"" Barth says. ""We have put each and every one of our employees through a rigorous 36-week course on how to properly speak to a customer in a language that can be understood by both the young and old."" Barth continued, ""When greeted at the front, no longer will you hear the familiar shouting of, 'Oh lawd, it's you folks again! Well git on in here and I'll get your seats right now! Not sure what's good right now for sitting, lemme check real quick for yall. You hang tight and chill, I be back after I git this figured out. I'll hit up my girlfriend Yolanda, she's one of the dish washers but she always has the down low on seats that aren't already taken up by some other fools'. This will now be replaced by, 'Hello and welcome to Applebee's. Would you like a table or a booth?'"" Horner told Super Official News that because of all these great new changes at his restaurant, unfortunately there will come sacrifices. ""In addition to raising prices on all of our food* because of Obamacare and firing employees so we don't have to provide them with health care, we will also be forced to raise prices to cover all the costs of these new and exciting changes. But I think everyone in Laveen will agree that it's worth it the next time they come in for lunch or dinner or just to get a drink with no alcohol in it."" From Applebee's in Laveen to your family: We know in Laveen you have no options for good food so when you're starving, and you have no food left in your house and the grocery stores are closed, head on over to Applebee's. We'll make sure you have the worst f*cking dining experience ever!"
James T.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,1.0,9/5/2013,"Last night was the first time we went to Applebee's in Laveen, to sum it up quickly. Horrible. Appetizer = Microwaved buffalo wings that had turned cold again, served with old cheese stuck to the plate, when cheese doesn't come with the wings. Bourbon Chicken and Shrimp = Chicken tasted like salmon, shrimp was cold, and the mushrooms tasted like they skipped the cleaning process. We had 2 bites to eat and decided to ask for the check, waitress asked if we wanted boxes..... We quickly said no, she showed no concern to ask about if anything was wrong with our food, said okay and brought back the check. Put the check on the table and walked off, not a word. Came back and grabbed check with payment, not a word. Brought receipt for signature, not a word. Since she cared about our food and experience, I showed the same respect in her tip. We left, not a word more than I wrote on the receipt telling them to step their game up. We are not going to be going back to this Applebee's... I can't even say ""not anytime soon"" because it is beyond that and is now NEVER"
Mike N.,"Laveen Village, AZ",0,12,,1.0,2/15/2015,"Absolutely horrible.  Music is blasting super loud, probably why when I called in 2 orders of wings the take out person messed it up.  I was on hold for 7 minutes, figured it was just unusually busy for a Wednesday night.  She asked bone in or bone out.... I clearly said bone in.  Boneless wings are not wings in my eyes.  Nobody came out to curbside pickup, walked in to find out she thought I said boneless, and then told me ""well you said boneless so it's gonna be a longer"".  Done with this place.  This happens way to often....I like Applebee's food so I keep giving it a chance.  No more, family it and I will never return."
Paul F.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,1.0,2/6/2015,"Worst establishment I have ever been to. First off the service was very poor. Our waitress finally got my drink order right after 2 attempts. Who knew a water with lemon was so difficult to make? After that, I found a hair in my salad and when they brought me a new salad I opened up my silverware and the knife was filthy! Looked like it still had bbq sauce on it and it was stuck to the napkin it was wrapped in!!! Totally unacceptable. At that point I not only decided my family and I weren't eating dinner there that night, but I wanted to hear what the manager had to say about the situation. What I got was a weak apology and he then offers me a $15 gift certificate for my troubles. I would have given it 0 stars if I could have. I will never eat there again."
Lindsey H.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",5,9,,3.0,11/12/2011,"Crapplebee's....that's what my friends and I call this place.  Unfortunately, it's one of the only restaurants in Laveen, so we keep dragging ourselves back there, just because we are lazy and are sick of McDonald's.  Food is hit or miss.  You may wonder why they keep changing their menu, it's because their food is usually horrible, so they have to.  The food is not horrendous, and it's priced ok, so that is why we keep going back. Oh yeah, AVOID the karaoke nights.  Actually, no, if you wan't a good laugh, you should go.  It was a lot of Barry Manilow, and slow, soul music, and horrible music.  It gave my friends and I some well-needed drunken entertainment."
Luke B.,"Laveen, AZ",29,5,1,1.0,4/30/2013,"Living in Laveen I want to support the local establishments. However, I would rather drive to Apache Junction then eat here again. The food is over priced mediocre at best. The employees all speak and act as though your in some bad gang movie, all the time touting there new renovations. The place still screams nasty dark truck stop, the Appelbees Corp needs to get a Handel on this ASAP."
