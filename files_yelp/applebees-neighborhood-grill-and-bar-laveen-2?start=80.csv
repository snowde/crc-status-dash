Samuel V.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,16,1,1.0,1/28/2015,dam it. another bad one.. just have to say bad just bad. severs sucks and the bartender does not care about making a dime. If you like waiting a hour and a half for 1 beer and wings go right ahead and come here
Melissa G.,"Laveen Village, AZ",54,5,,1.0,11/26/2014,"Service was horrible tonight.  Very nice people just very slow.  Ordered appetizer and meal.  Meal came but no appetizer.  Manger came said he would put appetizer order in on him.  Appetizer came out without all the sauces mentioned and well after I was done with meal.  Received bill and should have received 10& off for veteran's appreciation....received no discount,and were billed for both meals plus the appetizer.  This place needs some serious work.  Nice people but severely lacking in service. Horrible since the options in Laveen are limited."
Lidia N.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,7,4,1.0,3/2/2014,"Terrible service! I had to ask the waitress for napkins three times, instead of bringing the napkins she went and sat at a booth with some customers. I had to get up and get my own napkins.  When I paid, she didn't bring me a receipt back and the change was incomplete. This place just keeps getting worse."
Aubrey A.,"Phoenix, AZ",42,13,1,1.0,6/6/2012,"The waiter was super friendly and nice however the restaurant was empty, took almost and hour to get any food, when food came sides were missing and one of the dishes had been reheated causing the cheese to harden horribly. In speaking to the manager, manager was pompous and arrogant towards my mother. Asked to get a comment card and manager got defensive and accusatory"
H K.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,45,12,1.0,7/18/2012,"Yuck, this place is gross. Not only is the food sub-par, cold, and flavorless.. it turns into a rauchy ""club"" on some nights. I don't know if all Applebee's are trying to do that or if it's just a horrid decision from this one, but I'll never go back. I wish it would shut down and a Chili's built in it's wake. If I'm gonna have chain food I at least want it to taste consistently good and NO nasty skanky ""club"" nights. *gag*"
Luke S.,"Laveen, AZ",8,56,12,5.0,5/26/2012,"I have gotten take out service a few times, the latest this weekend, and everything has been great. Food order was correct and warm, server was professional. No complaints."
Cupcake M.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,57,25,2.0,1/27/2013,"Exactly, Meh, I've experienced better. I really try to avoid negative reviews, but this one was needed. Your sit down choices in Laveen are limited to Native New Yorker, a handful of Mexican dives, and of course the local Applebee's (hurry up Barros Pizza!) Twice we ordered curbside and twice they got it wrong. Both times portions of the meal were missing, not only did we wait 10 more minutes than promised, we waited 10 more minutes for the missing food! Also disappointed potato skins were taken off menu."
David L.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,25,,3.0,10/17/2014,"I was a bit worried to go to this location because of the other reviews about the slow and bad service. The service was fine and timely. Just what you would expect at any Applebees, average tasting food at average prices and average service. I will return to this location."
Melinda H.,"Laveen, AZ",77,75,73,4.0,4/14/2012,"I go there most Friday nights with my husband.  We always sit at the bar.  Everyone is very friendly, and you never have to wait very long for your food or for drinks.  We take people when they come in for out of town, and they cannot believe how friendly all the waiters and bar staff are.  The downside, sometimes the welcome staff are not that friendly."
Sophia C.,"Vista, CA",76,31,65,2.0,1/25/2012,"So I'm sure everyone has been to an Applebees in their lifetime. This particular location has terrible customer service! I've been there a few times hoping their customer service improves and only because it is a close location to where I live and for their happy hour. When you walk in you normally have to eye down the hosts or waiters to know that you are there waiting. Rarely is there anyone greeting you. They take a while with their food even when it's not busy, and their food is typically really salty. I wouldn't recommend this location, only if you're desperate for some cheap drinks during happy hour."
Michael Z.,"Laveen, AZ",44,27,5,1.0,9/3/2009,"I am a very easy going guy, I have been here 3 times and this place was horrible. Most of the ppl I speak to have also had bad experiences. From cold food to never not once having a decent waiter. Every few months I will try again to see if there have been improvements and still nothing. Eat at your own risk."
Janine M.,"Glendora, CA",0,7,,2.0,11/8/2013,"I just left and man the server was so horrible!  I don't want to be mean or rude but I find when I have older server's they don't ""hear"" you good. I came to relax and enjoy a nice margarita with my meal. Ugh! I eas seated server took ten mins I gave her my order and waited another 15 mins for my appetizer to come still no drink ::Sigh:: couple min later drink comes..and eww the glass was sticky and dirty I had to pour my drink in the martini glass? Ok?  Serving a margarita in a martini glass?! Whatever .. let it slide.. then I'm sipping and then I swallowed something strange.. I called the server over she doesn't even seem to care nor believe I swallowed a strange object that was in the glass I had to ask her to bring me a new drink with a CLEAN glass.. another couple mins ..new drink. Glass is still dirty I had to wipe myself!  And its already been 40 mins no food call over the manager explains what happens. . Dude pulls server she didn't ""hear"" my entree... great! At this point I lost my cool i just decided to pay for the lousy margatini lol whatever that thing was and my appetizer . At least the manager just told me it was no charge for it. I would avoid going here lol I should of went to like native new yorker or chipolte. Sucks laveen has no nice restaurants"
Pebbles C.,"Waimanalo, HI",38,8,3,2.0,2/29/2012,Service wasn't great and very slow.  I ordered a simple plate of steak and potatoes. The steak was over cooked and dry. The potatoes were under cooked and bland. Only good thing on my plate was the vegetable sides.
Jay S.,"Phoenix, AZ",11,27,6,4.0,2/17/2012,Food was cooked well and the service was fast and good.  It was not very busy for a Thursday night so we were able to get in and out while still enjoying our meal.
T B.,"Anchorage, AK",21,295,24,3.0,11/12/2011,"OK, you should know what to expect from a chain restaurant. This location continues to deliver as expected, although the waiter staff can sometimes not be attentive enough and drinks go unfilled. It's OK food, nothing special, but again it is what you would expect. No signature dish they rave about."
alicia d.,"Tampa, FL",11,13,,2.0,9/13/2013,Waited 15 minutes for someone to even come and greet us and take our drink order.  Never a good experience here
Christina S.,"Tolleson, AZ",0,9,,1.0,7/25/2014,The reviews are on point! By far the WORST Applebee's experience EVER!! I did read the reviews but the place was recommended by a friend so I thought I'd give it a try. We got seated fairly quickly so I was hopeful but I realized it's because nobody comes here. I've never been to an Applebee's happy hour that was dead.  I waited over 5 minutes for beer and had to remind the server that I ordered it.Appetizers  were not brought out at the same time. Our friends got their wings before us. Not to mention they totally forgot about our Mozzarella sticks. Had to remind the server about those after our meals were brought out. Which also weren't brought out at the same time. The food was bleh. Waited over an hour for a sandwich!  There was no silverware on the table so when we asked for silverware the server said the had no rolled silverware. She threw napkins & silverware on table. Really? They couldn't have rolled the silverware? It's not like it was busy. I waited so long for my second beer that I actually had to go to the bar to ask for it. By far hands down the worst Applebee's experience ever! Do not waste you $ on this poor establishment.
Alex S.,"Surprise, AZ",1,11,4,1.0,10/6/2010,"i went to this place on Saturday night and the two ghetto hostesses  literally had their heads down on the front desk. I had to ask them if they were open and they responded rudely then stared at me as if they didn't know what I wanted. I finally requested that I have a seat and I sat waiting for several minutes when I saw the waiter who looked like he was either high or very tired and not interested in working there. After I saw the first 3 employees, I decided that I was going to leave. I will never ever ever go to that Applebees.  It seemed like the place didn't have a manager on duty. Avoid this place."
Marina D.,"Laveen Village, AZ",0,1,,4.0,5/1/2015,"I normally don't write reviews but this is something that is unacceptable. I saw that there were two new managers I asked where Rafael and Shavonda were because I normally talk to them in delight (my family eats regularly here) and I liked the new manager, the tall man, I think his name was Leon. But anyways the other one was a short Latina lady, and man was she rude, her name starts with a B or something. I saw her yell at an employee not once but TWICE on different occasions. She looks like she tries to please customers which is good but... it is UNPROFESSIONAL AND DISGUSTING to chew someone out in front of paying customers. She had a terrible attitude with them from what I could hear. I can't believe that a person would humiliate a server on the resteraunt floor. I've had years of experience as a manager at different food chains and I can say that seeing that was truly sad. I love Applebee's but I just had to write about it, I hope that they don't condone that behaviour in the future with her. Anyways great food and great music."
Cher T.,"Tempe, AZ",310,166,72,2.0,8/21/2008,"I'm sorry to give this place two stars, but seriously - I HAVE experienced better.  Growing up in Laveen, where there has never been anything but dairies and fields between my house and south Phoenix. To have four lane roads and stop lights is freakin' psycho to me!! Oh my gosh! Besides my Laveen novelty of the whole idea of having an actual resturant in our lil hick town... I do like Applebee's. You can see me there - very late at night chilling with my friends talking about God knows what enjoying appetizers and refillable sodas. Their drinks aren't anything to write home about - seriously, chili's get it better. Their appetizers aren't as weird as Chili's so I'm glad. Their decor isn't great - come on... I say Applebee's you know what I mean.  But what this place DOES have going for it is it's waitstaff. They are always friendly, quick and occasionally funny. I like their staff but once in a while they have odd lil grabass competitions that I have personally shouted at them to stop. Once they didn't quit and I complained and scored a free meal! (whoo!)  I think it's a nice place, but honestly - it's just your average Applebee's but trust me, there are some Applebee's where the servers are jerks, Thank goodness - this place isn't like that!! Hope to see you there! -Cher"
