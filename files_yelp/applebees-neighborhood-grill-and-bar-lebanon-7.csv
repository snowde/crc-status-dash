William T.,"Lebanon, VA",0,84,16,4.0,11/5/2012,"This location has taken some serious criticism over the past couple of years. Personally I've not found many problems or had bad meals here. It's a chain restaurant! No one expects gourmet fare.  However, we all expect prompt courteous service and consistent food quality and presentation. That's exactly what I've had here during several visits.  Yes, a couple years ago there were problems here. New management, new servers, less problems.  Tonight my wife and I had the grilled chicken with cheesy sauce, rice pilaf and spinach. It was very good. And healthy!  Their garden salad has been consistently fresh and crisp. Frankly, I believe this is among the best garden salad around...regardless of the restaurant type. The portion size is generous and it is nicely chilled.  If you're looking for good food (chain store quality) and reasonably good service all at moderate prices, the Lebanon Applebees could be a good choice."
Russ B.,"Big Stone Gap, VA",0,2,,1.0,11/27/2016,Food was cooked well. Server was garbage waited 10 minutes on a refill before my food while she stood staring at the kitchen staff and flirting with other waiters and waitresses...will not come back
James H.,"Rosedale, VA",0,16,3,1.0,11/28/2013,"Applebee's is a decent food chain for a quality meal at a reasonable price but this location is the worst of the worst.  I have tried this location multiple times because of limited choices in the area and I continue to find myself regretting going back.  Lack luster service and poor food quality dooms this restaurant!  Have not been back in about 6 months and everything else in Lebanon will have to be closed before I will go back again.  Sorry, but the truth is the truth!"
