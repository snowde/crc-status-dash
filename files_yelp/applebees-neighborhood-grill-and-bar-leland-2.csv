Damon W.,"Leland, NC",108,8,,5.0,11/10/2017,"Haven't been to this Applebee's in a while , my server was great! I can't remember her name but she had red hair and was on top of everything ! Got the 2 for $20 deal and the food was hot the three cheese cavatappi was really delicious. Really great experience"
Stephanie H.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",268,308,264,2.0,10/18/2017,"Went to try the widely publicized $1 margarita special. Was served a beer mug full of clear liquid on ice with no taste or flavor. When I questioned the waitress, I was told this is their special. I've tasted flavored water with more flavor. Total ripoff. The food is mediocre at best - only went there to try the special. Our server was great and tried to fix our drink issues, but the Manager told her no - this is what you get for a buck. Really? Why bother to do a special if you don't want to serve an alcoholic drink?"
Jerry C.,"Leland, NC",1,6,2,5.0,11/14/2016,"We were deciding between Fat Tony's and Applebees last week and the decision we made was Fat Tony's.  Let me tell you, we made the wrong decision and never going back.   3 days later we went to Applebee's.  They have a standard menu at most every locationaroung here but the food comes out quick, hot, and taste is very good.  All of the staff is very nice, always happy and a ours was very chatty which was nice.  She wanted to make sure everything came out as ordered, if we needed anything else, and if we needed any drink refills, etc.  She was very caring checked up on every so often just passing we she would say ""everything ok?"" (and it was) and she would go work her other tables.  I know this is a chain restaurant and the food is pretty much the same at every location, but the food was excellent and cooked just right.  Hats off to the General Managers at this location.  They run the Leland, NC location very well."
Billy G.,"Bolivia, NC",2,1,,1.0,7/30/2017,"Incompetent. Ordered a full rack of honey BBQ ribs. A half rack was delivered not once but twice. To make it even worse, they had no sauce on them. They took the two halves and slathered them with sauce and brought them back. By that time, my wife had finished her dinner. No discount offered. Will not be wait,g here again."
Laura H.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",32,2,,1.0,5/25/2017,If I could give a 1/2 star I would. We have eaten at several Applebee's and I'm enjoyed it but this one is horrible. The server Myron kept forgetting things and we'd have to ask more than 3 times. It wasn't even busy. Our drinks were empty so we set them on the edge of the table. Several of the other waiters kept walking by and they looked at it and didn't even offer to fill up.
Jocelyn O.,"Leland, NC",0,11,,4.0,5/28/2017,Great food and good service. Sometimes can take a while to get your meal if they are busy but usually not the case! Open late and takeout are very convenient for this area. The employees are awesome... Aly is great :)
Cameron W.,"Elizaville, NY",90,1,,5.0,4/21/2017,"Came in this evening with a friend and had awesome food and really enjoyed our server, Kassidy! Her bright smile and her great personality made us enjoy our visit! Thanks to her, we will be back."
Mea D.,"Annapolis, MD",1,5,,1.0,6/28/2016,"Service was decent, food was awful! Being a chain restaurant you can't expect anything too great, but the food is actually way worse than you would expect, like they just gave up on trying to make the food taste good. I don't know if it is just this Applebee's or if all of them have gone downhill, but I don't think I would waste my time trying to find out."
Jill J.,"Mint Hill, NC",60,4,,2.0,8/6/2016,Service not good. Waitress clueless. Salad looked good in menu picture but didn't come to us the same way. Supposed to have chimichurri on the steak but had to ask for it after getting salad. What we got wasn't chimichurri. Not even sure what it was. Won't be back
Nick P.,"Leland, NC",18,2,,2.0,5/27/2016,This review is based over several trips here over the years of living in leland. The only time we go there is when we're eating dinner late. I've never had anything good there. Drinks are always overpriced and underpoured. Food rarely has any flavor at all. Most has a bit of a microwaved and/or freezer burnt texture. I could understand if the food was much cheaper. Even if the food was good the prices would be on the high side.
Robert T.,"Chandler, AZ",0,11,9,2.0,3/13/2016,"Bartender friendly, cold beer, but food was awful. The veggies with the salmon were barely cooked and didn't have any flavor, spinach artichoke dip didn't taste like anything, mozzarella sticks were soggy, and the beer cheese was okay, but the pretzels were not. Second time visiting with the same results."
Ryan S.,"Wilmington, NC",9,30,20,5.0,2/20/2016,"Consistent experience each time, food is hot and taste good, service is attentive whether at table or bar top (bartenders are really fun), seems during every visit management stops by to not only ensure food and drinks are good but make sure entire experience and day is going well!"
Sherry S.,"Concord, CA",40,12,58,3.0,3/6/2016,The staff was great. The food wasn't terrible but it wasn't anything I'd write home about. We had to send the ribs back because they were undercooked. We were refunded our money immediately.
Mike H.,"Leland, NC",15,12,,1.0,7/21/2015,"I went for lunch in a Monday at 12:30 I ordered a sweet tea, I tasted it and it was definitely a day old, the server in the meantime is MIA, she returns at 1 with the food order. I ask to get a Pepsi and she is defensive but also states complaints about the tea. Furthermore the managers ignore patrons at the bar and ignore multiple dirty glassware. Fly's are a problem and just no professionalism top to bottom."
Casey L.,"Fairfax, VA",8,41,4,5.0,8/11/2015,"We went here for lunch while on vacation on 8/9/15. We were extremely impressed with our waiter, he was the best, even my three teenagers noticed!! He was so attentive, professional and just overall awesome. I wish I could remember his name! My girls ordered frozen lemonaid drinks and didn't like them. He removed from our bill and brought them sodas no problem. The onion rings were so good we ordered twice. I did the pick two appetizers & had the spinach & artichoke dip/moz sticks both great. My daughters had the bourbon street chicken & shrimp and the quesadillas. My son had the 7oz house sirloin with fries. We all really enjoyed our food, no complaints."
Phil H.,"Hayesville, NC",0,11,1,4.0,5/30/2015,Had a great burger. I would recommend the Triple Bacon Burger to my friends. It's a large burger and yet not too messy to eat. Plenty of bacon on this one with the flavor of bbq sauce. Really good taste together. Only down side was our server was a little messy with his dirty apron. Service was good though just not appealing to the eye.
Jax G.,"Oak Island, NC",2,27,14,4.0,12/6/2013,"We had gotten sat in an area where a server want assigned. After waiting about 10-15 minutes,I went and told the hostess..our server came right over and took our drink orders.  A short time after, the manager came up to us and apologized and offered an appetizer on the house.   Ordered the new pretzel bread and was good, but,I ordered the chicken and shrimp tequila tango and was less than impressed. I'll stick to the steaks"
Heather A.,"Southport, NC",0,9,2,2.0,5/8/2015,"Some things are really good here. Unfortunately we have been here twice within a few weeks of each other and they are consistently undercooking the food. Last time I ordered a steak medium well. When I cut into it, it was medium at best. Today I got a burger to go, asked for no pink, it was pink and I have provided both pictures here. I won't be back to Applebee's in this area, especially for to go orders, it takes us 30 minutes to get there and I'm not about to drive all the way back for an incorrectly cooked dish."
Patti P.,"Leland, NC",0,4,,1.0,7/23/2015,This restaurant does no do steaks well at all.  Both my husband and I did the 2 for 20 and the steaks were under cooked and mostly grissle.
Jeff G.,"Apex, NC",5,16,1,4.0,4/4/2012,Always consistently good food and service at Applebee's and this location is no different.  Very attentive and knowledgable  staff.  My fish and chip was freshly fried and tasty.  The boys devoured their lunches with no complaints. Thanks for the nice experience.
D F.,"Lincolnton, NC",0,4,,4.0,6/14/2015,Was good food. Good service. They did get rid of sauce that goes with Fried green beans.  Sara was good hostess.
Janet M.,"Bolivia, NC",0,4,,1.0,2/23/2015,Hardly any food on the plate. Did not have several items listed on the menu. This is the second time Ive been given the excuse that they are out of that food! Poor management.
Erika F.,"Petersburg, VA",251,205,310,3.0,4/30/2013,"I've been here a few times since my dad bought a house down in NC and it's a nice place. The food is good and the drinks are cold. It's a chain and they have it down. I think one of the main reasons this place is so popular is because it's one of perhaps 5 restaurants in the area. I'd love to see the area expand a bit with all the new housing but for now, this place will do just fine."
Dave B.,"Leland, NC",2,7,10,4.0,8/14/2013,Service was great. Games were on. Food was delicious. Steak was cooked exactly as I asked. Not a compliant.
Matt B.,"Winnabow, NC",37,7,,5.0,1/4/2012,"This store has great food. I go there about every night. They have awesome boneless wings and mozzarella sticks. They have good burgers as well. The staff are always professional and friendly. Since i am a regular, they let me sit wherever i want. They never let me run out of water and always check up with me to see if i need anything."
