Marina R.,"Dallas, TX",89,119,269,5.0,11/9/2017,"This is the first Applebees I've been too that I have YET to have a bad experience with. Each time I visit I'm seated promptly, I have a nice waiter/waitress, and my food is always great. It really helps that they have daily drink specials as well - usually I end up here after a bad day haha. If you want to live through me, here is my typical order:  Appetizer: Spinach Artichoke Dip Entree: 8oz. Sirloin cooked MEDIUM with double steamed broccoli  Drinks:  2 Washington apple shots (at least)  The food here is honestly not bad, and I think you'd be surprised at the flavor of their steak.  Parking here is amazing & plentiful. They offer curbside to go if that's your thing.  Visit this location - it's better than the rest.  Xo."
Jessika C.,"Lewisville, TX",0,6,4,1.0,9/22/2017,"Horrible experience. We got to the restaurant at around 9:30pm, ordered at around 9:45pm. It's now 10:40pm and two people in our party are still waiting for their meals. Our drinks haven't been refilled once the whole time we've been here. My order as well as my fiancé's was wrong. When we did get our food, we had to wait for utensils because they didn't have any clean ones. The food was cold. We had to get our own drinks from the bar. Apparently, it was our waitress's first night. She was trying but she was getting frustrated. Finally, another waitress who normally works at the bar came to the rescue. She knows my mother and she took care of things. After all of this, I'm not sure I will come back to this location again.  Side note: The time is now 10:55pm and we just got those two meals..."
Krystal W.,"Duncanville, TX",104,123,356,1.0,8/5/2017,"Nope. Nope. Nope.  Came here for lunch and should have turned around as soon as I walked in.  Our server was apparently new...and he kept reminding us of that every 5 damn minutes.  I ordered mixed veggies and a plain baked potato. The server came back 5 minutes after my order to tell me that they don't serve potatoes before 4pm. Smh.  So then I ordered a side salad with Italian dressing, instead.  Again, 5 minutes later, he comes back and says ""oh we don't have Italian dressing""....okay, I understand being new, but this is getting annoying.  Also, each time he came back, he never took the initiative to refill my CLEARLY empty glass until I finally mentioned it to him.  I gave all this a pass because he's new....but... The food was horrible too. How do you mess up a damn salad???  First of all, they brought me a salad with items on it that I asked not to have. (The waiter kept blaming the kitchen, which even if it was their fault, he shouldn't do that) Secondly, it was cheap ass iceberg lettuce. Thirdly, the lettuce was old, brown, and wilted.  I would never come back here or recommend anyone to come here either!"
Courtney J.,"Lewisville, TX",0,3,,5.0,12/29/2017,I don't know how this place only has 2 stars the manager is awesome waiters are great and the food and drinks are amazing! I go on a weekly basis and am never dissatisfied! Amazing quality and customer service!
Divya S.,"Fort Lee, NJ",41,1,,1.0,12/21/2017,Worst kind of customer service. Waiters or the managers do not u derived what you want. Never going to come back here!!!!
Kevin G.,"Grapevine, TX",0,13,4,1.0,12/9/2017,"Terrible. TERRIBLE. Terrible! Slow and unresponsive staff. Dirty utensils, salad was stems and who knows what else. Never coming back, you get what you pay for. Much better options in the area."
Jocelin F.,"Weslaco, TX",1,15,3,1.0,12/18/2017,"I would not be returning back here. I don't even know where to begin. First our waiter never brought our drinks or utensils. Then after everyone else in my table got their food i was left waiting about 45 minutes to get mine. The waiter never came to ask how we were doing or if we wanted refills. We also ended up paying more than we should have even after my meal was ""free"". Very disappointed that we did not get to enjoy our experience here."
Meg C.,"McKinney, TX",111,172,334,3.0,2/18/2017,"The reviews here flat out suck, but I've never had a terrible visit.  Though I've only been here three times in the last two years, both times have hit the spot. I think it's all about setting the correct expectations. Two out of the three times we've come in, we waited several minutes for someone to acknowledge or seat us.  Service once seated has always been quick and attentive.  I order the All Day Brunch Burger because you can't go wrong with hash browns, bacon, egg, and cheese on a burger. The burger patty is well seasoned and overall pretty tasty.  I also substitute sweet potato fries for the regular fries. Cleanliness is questionable and concerning - all three times there were several tables not bused and trash all over the floor.  If you can get past this and the spotty service, you should be fine.Be sure to check out their happy hour specials!"
LaToya M.,"Farmers Branch, TX",86,164,99,2.0,7/15/2017,"Every time I eat at Applebee's I'm reminded of why I don't eat here.  I had a gift card so a friend and I stopped for apps and a drink.  I ordered the steak quesadillas with no onion.  They brought out a crunchy quesadilla with just meat and cheese because I said no onion I was told that meant I didn't want Pico which also includes tomato, jalapeño, cilantro and lime.  I asked to bring it on the side along with salsa and sour cream.  While waiting I took a bite just to see how the meat tasted and it was dry and flavorless.  I can't imagine the meat was prepared that day.  It tasted like old meat that was in the fridge and reheated.   I wish I would have taken a picture to show how the meat and cheese was so skimpy that it only covered only the inner half of the quesadilla.  I ended up sending it back because there was no saving it no matter what condiments I added."
Rick M.,"Lewisville, TX",19,13,38,5.0,11/14/2017,"Absolutely no issues with food or service.  I had no wait at all to be seated or to meet my server. Appetizer hit the table in 6 minutes. And the food 5 minutes later. Aaron, our server was engaging and positive the entire meal. The place was not loud or obnoxious and the mix in the music was not enough to drive anyone running for the car. Overall a great experience that lead into an epic night."
Jonathan T.,"Dallas, TX",26,16,3,5.0,7/26/2017,"Ok, I've been an Applebee's hater for the past 5 years now, but they've redeemed themselves last night. Surprisingly, EVERYTHING was on point! After getting turned down at On The Border, because we arrived there a lil too late, we came down to the choice of either Razzoo's or Applebee's. Both have often let us down in the past, but we wanted to give them a shot again.  Applebee's won by a hair. When we got inside, it smelled better. It felt better. I knew it was going to be a great experience from that point on. Our waiter was polite, considerate, and attentive despite her workload, and the bartender made us some awesome margaritas. We ordered the beef nachos and wonton chicken tacos as apps and I had the 8oz top sirloin with a side of fried shrimp, bacon mac & cheese, and classic fries. Everything was hot, fresh, and actually tasty this time! I don't know if they got a new manager, better cooks, or if it was the better ingredients, but Applebee's have made it back to my list of potential restaurants again. Congratulations.."
Toni O.,"Mineral Wells, TX",0,9,,1.0,10/27/2017,"Absolutely horrible establishment!  I went today for my son's birthday for dessert. We ordered his dessert and a Margarita for myself. The waitress brings out drinks and served mine with a nice little disgusting bug in it! She takes it back per my request and returned with another Margarita. Now, I am pretty grossed out, but I kept my cool. I left the new Margarita at the corner of the table. The manager comes over, laughs and asked if I was served with a fly in my drink. I said,indeed and I don't want another as I know they make this pre-mixed and it could have more bugs. The manager took my drink and says, ""sometimes we get bugs in here""then, proceeds to take the drink back to the bar. The manner less bartender yells out what's wrong with this drink? I yelled if I didn't want the first drink with the bug,a second was not going to cut it! We walked out! Hungry, disappointed at our treatment, and disgusted by your environment!"
Martin B.,"Flower Mound, TX",1,15,,5.0,8/11/2017,"This review is for the Applebee's in Grapevine! We live in Flower Mound but like this Applebee's the best! Great Staff & Great Service given by all. I can't remember the names of all the great servers, but one name comes to mind, the awesome Courtney! Courtney is always outstanding! The food is also great too! Hope this location in Grapevine stays open forever!"
Terri K.,"Lewisville, TX",2,3,1,1.0,10/21/2016,"Went to dinner the other night with husband and a friend. It was about 8:30, we walked in and there was no one in front of us, but still had to wait about 5 minutes for someone to notice us. Our waitress was prompt in taking our drink order and then our food order. We ordered our meals and also a to go meal. She asked if we wanted that prepared so that it came out just before we left. We said yes.  A runner brought my husband's food, our friends food, our to go order, bagged and ready to go. But I had no dinner. My meal was not even prepared. By the time I got my meal. The others were already finished eating.  We also had to go hunt down our own silverware. It's really irritating to see our server standing around talking and chit-chatting while we are having to get our own silverware.  This Applebee's seriously needs to get new management and a lot more training before I go back again!!!"
Tricia M.,"Cuba, MO",0,1,,1.0,10/21/2017,"Our food was dry, and looked like it had been sitting out all day. It probably was and likely reheated in microwave. Absolutely terrible. It was bad last time too, but we wanted to give another try. No way are we spending money here again."
Adam B.,"Fort Worth, TX",23,6,12,1.0,10/10/2016,"Do not go to this applebees unless you want them giving away your property! Gave away my keys the day my grandfather passed away! They have cost me Hundreds of dollars to replace my keys! I went to this applebees because I had not eaten all day and just lost my grandfather and needed some food,I was distraught and left my keys on the table. So after getting back to my apartments maybe 3 minutes later down the street,I called back and asked to talk to the manager. He asked me to describe the keys I was able to describe them and produce an identical keychain with more of my keys on it, because I have a lot of keys. So he gave away my keys to someone that said they were his brothers keys, without asking to describe them! The story the manager told me made no sense! How did his brother get home without his keys? I asked did he get the license plate,no he did not he said. The fact that he asked me to describe the keys and he did not ask the person he gave them away to describe them was ridiculous! They are supposed to be paying me back but have just been blowing me off time after time. The owners of this restaurant are supposed to call me  as well but it has been well over 2 month's nothing! I'm really considering hiring an attorney and Suing this Applebee's!"
Eboni H.,"Irving, TX",149,3,,1.0,10/5/2017,"This place doesn't even deserve a star to be honest. Just left here. Sat at the bar, wasn't acknowledged for several minutes by Shantel (I think her name was) even though she talked to the guests sitting right next to us. I had to catch her eye and smile for her to speak. Then we asked for waters which we never got after 10 mins. We moved to a table. Horrible service there too. Waitress forgot to ring in our drinks until we asked about them after 20 mins and she replies what did you guys have again. Took ten mins for the waters. While we are waiting, her friend walks up to the table and says ""your man better tip my friend or it's going to be a problem"". We finally got our drinks. Waited another 20 mins for our food. Guy walks past us with our food, gives it to another table. He puts the food down in front of the other people, to which I'm sure they said it wasn't theirs. Then he tries to bring it to our table. I'm a server and bartender. If the food hits the table, it has to be remade. You can't give it to another guest. So we had to ask for it to be remade and it took another 20 mins. Manager was either sitting at the bar, sitting and laughing with servers or nowhere to be found. This is just sad. No excuse for this type of service AT ALL. At any time of the day."
Eric R.,"Arlington, TX",65,2,,1.0,6/3/2017,Was seated as soon as we walked in since it wasn't really busy. We sat down and waited 15 minutes for someone to take our drink orders to no avail so I go up to the bar and ask can we get a waiter to come over and 5 minutes later finally we get to order. Slow service on a slow night not a good look
Joe H.,"Coppell, TX",2,88,,4.0,5/17/2017,The steaks were excellent and the service was perfectly okay they agreed to turn the blaring music down and we had a very pleasant meal on a Mother's Day which I expected to be frantic. Place was clean as was the fresh Taste of the steamed vegetables
Mark T.,"Lewisville, TX",0,5,,1.0,6/30/2016,"Manager is rude.  He provides HORRIBLE costumer service. I hate coming to this location, just because of the manager."
Navid R.,"Western Hills/Ridglea, Fort Worth, TX",45,67,88,1.0,7/3/2016,One star given by choice I would have given negative rating service is pathetic servers are rude manager was ok will never return
Carolyn T.,"Euless, TX",51,5,,1.0,4/23/2017,Drinks were bad .Service. Was bad food Was Bad Funny Smell to it I will Not Go Back To Apple Bee's In Lewisville Tx Again  I Will Be Calling The Corporate Office Monday
Saif Ali C.,"Carrollton, TX",0,3,,1.0,5/22/2016,"Not even worth the 1 star rating. I really wish there was an option of a zero rating. Ambience- Bad,not clean sticky tables not good. Food- awful. Literally a really bad punishment my tastebuds. Staff- probably the only decent thing there. Bad Quality Food,with An unhygienic ambience. Two wrongs don't always make a right. This is the kind of place,if you eat here there's probably a really good chance that you're going to end up sick the next day."
Mary M.,"Grand Junction, CO",4,112,37,1.0,12/16/2016,"Worst service possible!!!!! After a long work week we decided against our better judgment to come to this place.. so walking in the door the host need some customer service lessons. We sat at our table for ten minutes before the waiter came to our table he took our order I ask him for a cocktail menu never got one our appetizer was given to the table next to us and she then put it on our table and said ENJOY really!!!!! We thought about leaving, but my husband is a little more understanding then I am.. by far the worst service I have received.. DO NOT WAIST YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE!!!!! So I finally just went to bar got our drinks still no food so we decided to leave . Oh did I mention the people next to us came in ten minutes after us got their food before we did so at that PO we just walked out."
John K.,"Lewisville, TX",31,24,4,1.0,9/24/2016,"Over the last 6 months, I have eaten at this location three times. With each time, the service has worsened and now, sadly, I must no longer return. Today, after several minutes, one of the assistance managers waited on us and took our drink orders before a waiter got to us. Then, after we received our food, the American Burger came WITHOUT lettuce, tomato, and onions (which we later learned had to be keyed separately to order!) . . . then, it took about 10 minutes to finally get the lettuce and tomato (after the burger and melted cheese got cold!) . . . we spoke to a manager who apologized. DEFINITELY never returning to this location! Yes, it has worsened!"
Kate H.,"Lake Dallas, TX",83,7,2,1.0,12/13/2016,Been here an hour and STILL don't have our food!   We experienced the SAME Thing but thot it was a fluke.  We WINT be back.
Chris I.,"Lewisville, TX",11,4,7,1.0,8/28/2016,"If you have an LTC do not go here. They will call the police on you. Nothing but praise for the Lewisville PD, the were fantastic"
Kayla C.,"Lewisville, TX",123,3,,1.0,8/21/2016,"The manager here is so rude and disrespectful! Our waitress was fine, overworked but fine. The manager not so much. Yes, we did have some issues with the check, but it was their fault as we were charged for three items we never ordered. If you can't handle people asking you to fix things than don't work in this industry. It is not okay to call people liars and tell them they can't speak to you and to leave your restaurant when all we wanted was to pay for what we ordered in the correct way. I will never return to this location EVER! Applebee's needs to train their employees and managers how to use proper customer service and the right way to handle difficult situations, because it is going to happen and there is a wrong and right way of doing things."
Nic G.,"Flower Mound, TX",44,151,16,3.0,3/6/2016,They have great happy hour prices so that has to be noted first! The service is slow and underwhelming as well as the managers seem to focus on the people they know (the regulars) which can make you feel unimportant! The happy hour apps and drink princes are the only reason to come here.
Neha M.,"Garfield, NJ",800,1048,369,4.0,1/14/2016,"This place does not have great food.  I mean it's typical bar food, nothing to waste your money on.  I come here for the drinks.  They have good specials on drinks whenever you go.  The service is okay, nothing special.  They do have cheap lunch specials though if you do need something cheap and are in the area for lunch.  Average food like I said.  Anytime I have come here the waitress has always been attentive whether I have a table of 2 - 6."
Bonnie W.,"Lewisville, TX",0,4,,5.0,2/23/2017,"When my daughters and I came in tonight we could tell that they were catching up from a busy night. It is income tax season after all, I received mine today. Our server was a very friendly, enthusiastic, energetic young lady named rachel. She wasn't acting fake...she is a genuine ray of sunshine. I usually tip around 15 to 20%, even if the service is horrible, just because I know the service industry. I never write reviews...but she deserves a shout out. My almost 15 y/o asked how old you had to be to work there...Rachel told her and then told her to slow down after my daughter told her she was wanting to make her own money. My daughter then stated that she would be scared to be a server and Rachel told her that could do it and that she believed in her. What Rachel didn't know is that my daughter has been having a hard time in ""teen"" life right now and those words meant more to us than she could ever know, even though she was referring to being a server. I am so glad my daughter got to hear it from a complete stranger that doesn't even know our situation. I left her a $50 tip. I know it's not really much but I hope it made her 1/2 as happy as she made me. I wrote her a little thank you note explaining the difficult times and thanked her from the bottom of my heart. She truly made my day. Again, thank you rachel...you have no idea what your words meant to us. Thank you so much!"
David L.,"Arlington, TX",51,89,137,3.0,6/27/2015,"This is budget priced American food that I brought my Gal to because of the fast attentive service I get in Ft. Worth.  My bad. The food is to Applebee's standards but the speed of service is such that luke warm food was what we got. I still believe that the chain is reasonably priced and a decent meal.  Service industries throughout America, as a whole, struggle for quality staffing, the empty glasses a dirty plates let me know Applebee's is American. The final blunder after ordering desert the server delivered the check BEFORE desert. I will go back to Applebee's in Ft. Worth but you can do better in Lewisville."
Kristin G.,"Allen, TX",369,8,3,1.0,11/12/2016,"So disappointing. This is one of the Applebee's that makes the blonde still. At the end of our date night all I wanted was a blondie. I called ahead to make sure they had them. We got there a little before 11 and I immediately sat down and ordered the dessert with an extra scoop of ice cream. After 20 minutes the blondie came out... without the extra scoop of ice cream. I told her about the ice cream and she immediately apologized and went back to get it. We poured the sauce on top that was so thick it was more the consistency of butter than the traditional syrup consistency and went to dig the spoon in and couldn't even cut a piece off. Immediately we could smell it was so burnt. She came back with the ice cream and I told her the brownie was black on the bottom. She immediately took it. The manager never came over and addressed it. He walked around looking like he was the maddest/saddest person alive. After another 10 minutes she brings out the next blondie. This time we got the same terrible consistency topping and it was literally a tablespoon worth (it usually comes with 1/3 cup ish). We spread out the topping and went to take a bite. Although we could cut into the top the entire bottom was gone. At this point it was getting late, we were tired and didn't see the waitress or manager. We cut off the bottom and ate it, paid for it and left. The attentiveness of the manager was terrible. He should always check on the table when an item has been returned. I still can't believe I paid for such a disgusting dessert. All I wanted was my freakin blondie. Guess I'll just head back to the McKinney location. Don't waste your time. Only positive, their hostess was super friendly and put a smile on our face!"
Christine T.,"Dallas, TX",1,12,4,1.0,8/18/2016,"This deserves 0 stars. Service was awful, I paged for a server to get notified to come to my table after waiting 15 minutes and still waited for another 5-10. I'm a pretty easy customer to serve and never needy, just would expect some decent service. I wish I had a picture of the food I ordered from the menu and a picture of the food I actually had delivered. Ever see one of those ""failed"" memes that people would try to attempt to make and failed miserably? Well Applebee's would be that failed meme with a picture of their food from the picture on their menu next to the picture of the food actually made for you. Even better, the person I was with didn't even get the sides he requested and we were pretty much done with our food by the time we got it. I never got a refill on my drink. The server brought the check over and didn't bother to ask us if we needed anything else.  I told him we may be interested in some dessert. So he walked away and disappeared again for some time. This place is a complete waste of money. Makes a lot of sense though, this place was dead during dinner hours."
Lance W.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,4,1,2.0,1/25/2015,"We were sat down after about 5 minutes waiting at the front. After being seated, are waitress tells us she's had a bad shift and asked if we wanted to know why. I said ""sure"" and she tells us that the kitchen staff just showed up. I don't think that's something you tell a customer but okay, we ordered.  After about 25 minutes the waitress comes back and says sorry, we're behind about 10 tickets. Our table all just look at each other as she left our table. We put 10 minutes on our timer and if no food came out in those 10 minutes then we would leave.  About 5-7 minutes later, our food arrived. Well, they brought the wrong food to our table but then brought our food. It's only 2 stars because the food was not that bad. I don't see Applebee's as a company being around that much longer. I think Chili's is taking over the space.  This Applebee's proved that they have poor management as we received no apology at all from a manager. Not to mention, a ""strike"" from the kitchen staff. Oh, and our water cups were plastic IHOP cups."
Nicholas M.,"Coppell, TX",9,11,2,1.0,3/23/2016,"I recently went to Applebee's for my third time here in Lewisville area an I continue to get horrible service for the third time! My friend an I was not greeted when seated. The waitress passed several times without taking our orders. I can definitely see that We were not her priority. Once I got my food it was okay, it came out in a timely matter. I tried to give her a break, But my friends meal had not hit the table yet. By the time my friends food got to the table I was done with mine. To top things off I didn't ever get a refill on my drink. I never ask for much when I go these low end restaurants, but to not get a refill is just breaking all principals. I'll never eat at Applebee's ever again!"
Sarah P.,"Carrollton, TX",160,240,3405,2.0,4/17/2013,"Very slow service.  My party of 3 was seated on the patio and we sat there for over 5 minutes while 3 different servers walked back forth helping two other tables on either side of us before anyone offered to take our drink order.  Went back another time late night and they were packed.  The service was a little bit better we had a large group of 11 this time and the waiter was doing his best to keep up but the wait for our orders was still extremely long.  They have have half price appetizers late night which is a big late night draw here.   They will let you order the lunch combo items but at night they add $2 or $3 depending on what you get.  I've given it a few tries, maybe I'll try another location if I'm in the mood for Applebees again.  The food isn't all that good for the price and time spend waiting on service."
Kate R.,"Dallas, TX",80,421,62,1.0,6/27/2012,"I don't think I'll ever be coming back to Applebee's ever again. Not just this location, but any of them... I stopped by this Applebee's about a week ago with my crazy friend M when we were starving STARVING. We were so hungry, we were about to start gnawing on our own arms.  So you'd think that with that level of hunger, anything would taste like the nectar of the gods/the most amazing thing ever/YUM FOOD GIMMIE NOM NOM.  Sadly, that was not the case.  First of all, when we walked in, we stood alone at the door for quite a while. When someone finally came up, we made our way to the smoking section (less crowded and slightly less noisy, until the hyena-woman in the bar area started cackling) and sat.  Our waitress was friendly enough, I guess, but she really didn't care. Our Dr Peppers were disgusting. The soda/syrup ratio was so so incredibly off that even in our states of absolute hunger and thirst, we couldn't force it down. When we brought it to our waitresses attention she was just like, ""ummm.. I can mention it..."" and offered water or another beverage instead. She just didn't care.  The menu is standard Applebee's underwhelming fare. I used to like one thing at Applebee's (it was so many years ago, I completely forgot what it was called), and of course they took it off the menu. Nothing on their menu strikes me as terribly unique. They DO have their ""Under 550 calories"" section, and I eventually picked an item from there since it seemed to be the least offensive item.  ...and it was gross. It was the Chicken w/mushrooms thing. Grilled chicken topped with mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, Dijon sauce (which I had them leave off), and an 'aged Cheddar'. The chicken itself wasn't bad. It was cooked well. the mushrooms were alright, but the onions were overwhelming. The cheese was weird. Cheddar is typically an excellent melting cheese. This cheese didn't melt. It kind of congealed and browned without melting. It had a weird flavor and a bad aftertaste. I removed the clump o cheese, the onions/tomatoes, and just ate the chicken with some mushrooms. That was alright. Not worth the $10+ I paid, but palatable. The small portion of potatoes was good. The veggies were decent, but more wilted than fresh-looking. Our waitress was mostly absent and when she was there, she just didn't care. She asked how everything was because she had to, but we probably could've said ""It tastes like death!"" and she would've responded 'great, great. let me know if you need anything!'.  Overall, it was a standard Applebee's experience. I am continually underwhelmed by their boring, mediocre, reheated from frozen food.  For what it's worth, the people behind us were smoking clove cigarettes which made me want to vomit the whole time they were there. Most places (that still allow smoking) don't allow anything other than plain cigarettes. Apparently, Applebee's doesn't care."
Reba G.,"Dallas, TX",567,688,556,3.0,7/14/2012,"Who knew that this place stays crowded late at night during the weekends??  I figured out why, they have half price appetizers and really strong drinks.  The service is always on par, and I didn't have to wait long to get seated.  This has been a stop in before a night out on the weekends."
Shawna M.,"Lewisville, TX",33,5,11,2.0,8/30/2015,"Not saTisfied at all. The manager brought us our food which makes this whole thing even worse becausE he allowed unsatisfactory food leave the kitchen. The fries came with salt and pepper, not Brown sugar.. gross!! The chicken in my boyfriend's pasta was so dry and chewy I had to come it down with water. My burger oozed so much grease the bottom bun was slightly soggy and the cheese was of a rubber type consistency. And it wouldn't hurt the waitress to smile!! Your voice is perky And preppy but you have a resting b**** face."
