Nathan P.,"Carrollton, TX",76,48,47,5.0,4/26/2015,Can't go wrong with $1 beers and decent food.  Usually a little quieter place to eat and grab a beer than most other places.
David D.,"Hot Springs Village, AR",65,380,26,2.0,1/29/2012,"Had a gift certificate and decided to pop in and use it on a weeknight.  First impression was that we walked into a smoking pit.  Normally, the smell doesn't bother me but at a family restaurant I was surprised at the strength.  We were seated and the booth felt like a hundred year old mattress.  Note to management:  Replace the cushions.   I will say this, the server was ontime and attentive, no problem with the service we received.  However, the food was less than good. Both my wife and I had a shrimp and steak dish and the shrimp were cold.  The vegetables were weak and overall very unappetizing.  We informed the server and she had the manager come over and address the situation.  The manager was very nice and offered remedies.  We don't normally accept discounts or offers to refire the dish because we don't want to appear that we are looking for something for nothing.  We just want the management to know of the problem, he was very gracious and talked to us for a couple of minutes and we believe that he will address the problem, too bad the qualifty control isn't up to par in the kitchen. Sorry, but unless someone gives us another gift certificate I believe we will choose to dine elsewhere."
Benjamin W.,"Flower Mound, TX",220,13,4,1.0,6/14/2015,Server was nice. Was told that the A/C was broken (was extremely hot in there) and the owner refuses to fix it every year. I'll head over to Buffalo Wild Wings next time.
Russell N.,"Lewisville, TX",20,7,,1.0,5/31/2015,"Don't go here, the managers can't even get your order right. They tried to cheat me on the food I normally order because they had a special going and the chips were stale."
Shay S.,"Dallas, TX",54,156,27,3.0,8/4/2013,"Eh. Nothing special. We dropped in for some appetizers and everything was mediocre. I think what I disliked the most was the fact that our waitress was so hard to track down. It seemed like they didn't really think strategically when placing customers at tables. She was having to go across the room and back and forth. But I give a 3/5 because the waitress got our drink orders wrong but then went a head and did not charge us for it, which I thought was nice. I was VERY unsatisfied by the side of shrimp. We just felt like munching so we ordered the 7 grilled shrimps. I was shocked when they brought out 7 tiny pieces of shrimp (the ones smaller than the ones in Chinese food or frozen meals). I have never seen restaurants serve food like that before. It was just very interesting.  I remember the lime salsa being so good but something was just off and the salsa was pretty watery.  This place was just ok. I wouldn't come here for dinner or to have a big meal."
Jerrell C.,"Dallas, TX",96,8,6,2.0,3/3/2014,"Food is hot, service is slow Guess I shouldn`t expect anything more, afterall it is Applebees"
QueeNesha W.,"Lewisville, TX",0,1,,1.0,4/26/2015,"I Am So Utterly Appalled ..Service Was Horrible Had To Ask Five Times For Lemons To Go In My Water. After Waiting Close To An Hour For My Food I Wasn't Given What I Ordered,  I Ordered Fajitas And Only Received The Meat ..30 Mins Later I Was Given The Rest Of My Order. Never Returning To Lewisville Applebee's"
Raymond O.,"Irving, TX",74,119,35,1.0,8/13/2014,"I used to come here frequently when I lived in Lewisville. Wouldn't you expected a more lively or fast paced service when half priced appetizers and drinks specials are available til midnight? I sure would! The kitchen took far too long to deliver the food. The funny thing is the bar tender brought out a beer faster than the servicer could bring out water. SOMETHING IS TWISTED HERE. I ordered some bone in wings hot flavoured. Where as my buddies got the chips & salsa and boneless buffalo wings. I guess their food was OK. Mine on the other hand... Gross! 10 wings $9.99, they were pretty small compared to the likes of pluckers or Hooters. The texture, dry and over sauced which wasn't at all spicy. Out of the 10 I could only muster the strength to eat 6 trying not to embarrass myself for having such a small appetite. Overall slow service, slow kitchen, awfully cooked wings equal lame typical neighborhood restaurant with a big corporate company name. Applebee's this location needs some new management or something."
Michael R.,"Lewisville, TX",6,12,,2.0,12/26/2014,Waiter gave part of our order to someone else. Ribs tasted like microwaved. So so for Lewisville; there are better restaurants about the same price within a block from this restaurant.
Mary B.,"Plano, TX",0,11,,4.0,1/22/2016,"All right.  The place was clean, and quiet for a Thursday night.  My son and I had Christopher.  He was great.  He got us refills and drinks to go too.  The best part was he drew a cute character on my receipt.  I want to go back now just to see what he is going to draw next."
Rick K.,"Dallas, TX",28,65,,1.0,2/17/2012,"Pros:  I didn't get food poisoning. I don't think anyone spit in my food. Oh, and it's cheap Cons: Slow, virtually nonexistent service, bland, inadequately prepared food.  It's not often that I drop the comparison, ""worse than Hitler"". But for Applebee's?  Nah, I'll save that for something else... Actually I equate Applebee's to those cartoons where the befuddled yet weary protagonist encounters a desert mirage.  Bugs, or whoever, discovers a palm tree oasis, only to ultimately dive face first into just another pile of sand.  Here in the 3D world, we sought sustenance after a drunken evening at the broom closet that is Hattricks (fodder for a future Yelp).  After 11pm most of the casual dining joints shut down in the Lewisville area.  The apple shaped beacon visible from the highway promised more beers and some quality grub.  Wrong. Wrong. Service was extremely slow, exacerbated by the fact our server had friends at a nearby table. We ordered several appetizers, as they were half priced after 11. It was readily apparent our order had been sitting under a heat lamp, significantly reducing the crunch and flavor of our selections. The onion rings were bearable.  I'm not sure if I've ever seen a manager at an Applebee's. Do they exist? Look, we've all been to Applebee's. We go for the same reasons. It sucks, but is a necessary evil on occasion.  Then why the hell am I penning this review to tell you what you already know?  It's just a reminder for me to seek grub elsewhere.  Bon appetite, and stuff..."
Matt S.,"Denton, TX",0,4,,1.0,9/12/2014,I love Applebee's but I will not be returning to this location.  Poor service and low quality food.  Spinach dip over cooked. Chicken tortilla soup looked like brown mush. Bun on burger was tiny and cold. Empty plates say in front of us until we left.
Michelle W.,"Irving, TX",138,56,34,2.0,9/24/2012,"This location leaves much to be desired. While other Applebee's locations I have visited as of late have really impressed me with their all around great food, service and atmosphere; this one may as well be an entirely different chain all together.  Upon entering the restaurant; the air is stale, and it smells like everything with a fabric surface needs to be throughly scrubbed. This location looks like it's long overdue for a remodel.  The service was slower than it's other Applebee's counterparts, but the food is actually the most disappointing of the entire visit. My soft drink was lacking enough syrup, so I ordered another variety of soda and it too had the same issue. For an entree I ordered a salad and pasta combo. The salad portion was fine, but it was the pasta portion that was most disappointing. I had ordered this same dish from another Applebee's the week before and it was fresh and delicious, however this one tasted like it had an over abundance of onions that were grilled for another dish. In the original incarnation of this dish, the onions were just an accent, whereas this time at this location, it's like they were added as filler and were not even intended for that dish. It was a big disappointment to be expecting something entirely different.  The service was incredibly slow, I felt like my waitress only checked on my as an after thought. Overall, it's as if this location is on a whole other page altogether. I do enjoy the Applebee's chain very much, but I highly recommend avoiding this location."
Masha W.,"Lewisville, TX",28,5,2,1.0,6/22/2014,"So with all the commercials that lured me back to the infamous 2 for $20 deal, I gave this toilet bowl of a restaurant, another sh*t, pardon me, shot..... Allie, our waitress, served with a smile. She was prompt with our drinks, and had a great attitude.  I ordered the 9 oz steak (medium well, slight pink), topped with grilled onions, with corn & red potatoes. Dude, 1st of all I am a corn lover. I can eat corn everyday in every way...tell me how that was the nastiest corn ever! My 8 yr old said it tasted like the cafeteria corn at her school! It was mushy and old...gross! I had 12 red potatoes that were disgusting too..So I asked for french fries instead, which came out 20 mins later. My streak was cooked great as far as it being medium well and juicy, but hell, it tasted so 2nd hand, and T.V.dinnerish...not to mention they forgot my onions, so when they did bring them, they brought me a bowl of the while damn onion grilled. Of course by that time, my steak was cold... My beverage was a sweet tea with kiwi flavor in addition to a Long Island.  My guy had the chicken tenders/fries...um mediocre. We had onion rings for an appetizer, way too breaded, not a good way to start off at all. He ordered a Pepsi that tasted like Root beer, and exchanged it for a Sierra Mist, which we all know is just a bootleg Sprite. Now....the 1st time we came to this location, was around last year....The grease they used to cook our food was burnt! So yes, the onion rings, chicken tenders was hella gross...The manager came out like he didnt care, went in the back in the kitchen and never came back out, so of course we left without paying for that garbage.  I am so disappointed with Applebee's. This used to be my spot about 10 years ago, hands down. Drinks, spinach dip, the sampler, etc. And now it's literally like a dump. If, and that's only if, I come back, it woukd have to be by invite, I'd only come for drinks.  When I told Allie about how my check was not worth friggin $52.00, she went and told her manager and knocked off $15bucks, still the sh*t wasn't worth $36, but I had to satisfy my curiosity that was misled by the commercials so it was partially my fault. Now normally management comes out when there is an issue and of course he/she did not, and I wrote on the receipt this same frustration.  I am a T.G.I Friday's girl myself, they are consistent and I've personally met the chef. Applebee's is a toilet. It pissed me off and it's full of sh*t.....Don't go....for real!"
Lee M.,"Lewisville, TX",2,1,,2.0,6/15/2014,Not the Applebees I'm used to.  Not very clean.   Old looking. Customer service too dead.  Food was not fresh.  Taste and look like it had been sitting for a while.  I ordered the margarita queso and chicken and shrimp. The shrimp weres dry.  My husband ordered the baby back ribs.  It was dried look like the cooked it yesterday and just reheated. The fries tasted as if they just reheated and add to the plate . Check this off my list
Rachel W.,"Dallas, TX",267,258,,2.0,1/31/2014,"Applebee's is one of those places where you go if you don't want to eat at Chilli's. That's my personal opinion. I am not impressed with their menu. The service at this location is very slow, and if you have a hour lunch break you literally have to scarf down your food."
Carol P.,"Carrollton, TX",8,16,2,1.0,11/7/2013,"WORST RESTAURANT EXPIRENCE EVER!!!  Just left this restaurant frustrated. Since I stepped in I waited for about 5 minutes, waiters were walking around and not even one came to seat me or at least tell me to wait. I was just standing there like a clown. When seated, the waiter came after 10min. And the food after 30mins. I was craving their chocolate cake with ice cream but it was another mistake because it took 30 more min. After waiting 30 min for dessert i decided to give up and leave. I try to talk to the manager about my horrible experience and he didn't even care to listen and didn't give any discount or courtesy for their horrible costumer service. Never coming back...and with a manager like that you now know why their costumer service is so bad!!!"
Daniel K.,"Coppell, TX",73,36,4,1.0,7/22/2010,"I've been here a few times and it its nothing special, but the reason I give this location 1 star is due to the customer service. I called inquiring about drink specials only to get answered by a young girl who refuses to answer my question and hangs up on me.... I called back again only to be hung up on again.... I called back one last time to speak to the manager and did I receive an apology? I don't think so.... If you ever have ANDREA waiting you or answering the phones, don't expect much...."
Laurie L.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,,1.0,10/10/2014,"We went to lunch today. There are not too many people , the hostess is very friendly but the waitress is not. Her name is Jexxx. We wait for almost 30 minutes to get the food . In the meantime, the waitress is busy serve other customer to ask put down the survey and looks very nice and friendly... to other tables. When we ask her could she check our food since it's talking too long and her answers is it will take around 11-12 minutes to prepare our meal and it's not that long since we just ordered. And she left and roll her eyes with other waitress . Very rude and unprofessional.  The food just so so and portion is small that's fine.But the service is the worst and the waitress is either discrimination based on customer's color or just she doesn't care her customer .... I was thinking to talk to the manager but i feel it's no use since i won't come back for sure"
Jimmy K.,"Addison, TX",43,6,4,2.0,6/29/2013,"Being in the service industry I know how busy a lunch rush can be... that being said, no refills,  forgotten entrees and I think our server checked on us once time throughout the entire meal... definitely won't be returning to this location... would be a one star but the food was good"
