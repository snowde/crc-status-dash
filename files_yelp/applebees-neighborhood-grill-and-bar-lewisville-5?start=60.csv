Amy S.,"Dallas, TX",108,64,15,3.0,2/17/2011,"Signature Sirloin with Garlic Herb Shrimp with sauce and bruschetta along with mixed vegetables.  550 calories!  It was actually very tasty.  The sirloin was cooked exactly as requested and the food was hot on the plate.  The only complaint I could possibly have is that the veggies were mostly just broccoli and some sad looking carrots...would have loved more squash.  Other than that, everything was fine.  Now, don't get me wrong, it isn't along the lines of Hoffbrau or any of those places, but it's Applebee's and for that type of food, it was good.    I sat at the bar and the company around me was great.  My friend and I probably talked more to the people around us than we did to eachother, but that's okay...her current text battle with her boy toy was boring me, LOL. Adrian was our bartender and at first she seemed a little gruff, but in her defense, the bar was rather busy and I think she just wanted to take the order and move on to the next.  It didn't help that my friend chatty-cathy wanted to know all the drink specials.  I'm just a beer kinda gal, so I'm an easy customer when it comes to that.  A little later on Adrian loosened up a little bit, cracking some jokes here and there, so it turned out to be a fun time.  I would go back!  Actually to be honest, my irritation lies not with the restaurant at all but with the customers with children that sit in the bar area and then complain about smoke.  Get over yourselves--YOU'RE IN THE BAR AREA!!!  Next time just wait the extra few minutes for a table in the nonsmoking area."
Oscar T.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,3,1.0,10/27/2013,"Horrible service. My family and I got there. No host or hostess. Finally after 10 minutes a host showed up. We got seated, then 15 minutes later a waitress stopped by our table, asked us what to drink without introducing herself, so we never got her name.  After 7 minutes, we got our drinks from another server. The 5 minutes later (total of 37 minutes), we decided to leave and never come back. It was our first and last time to Lewisville, Tx location."
Steven S.,"Arlington, TX",138,225,32,2.0,3/23/2010,"Service - 2 Star Food - 2 Star White Queso Dip - 4 Star So, if I don't like Applebee's and I'm EveryMan, how do they stay in business? Is my taste bad or do all the people to that go to Applebee's have bad taste? Conundrum. No answers have sprung forth, so I'll just get on with this review.  Service was a hoot. My waitress looked on either side of 50 and dressed like 19. Hair extensions like Pamela Anderson. Makeup like Pamela Anderson. Hair color like Pamela Anderson. Unfortunately, she lacked some of Pamela's more stand out-ish features. But then again, nobody got poked in the eye. Her attitude would have been better appreciated in a non-family type of restaurant. Her In-your-face friendliness came on a little too strong. Some people love it. I'm more a ""let's take things a little slower"" kind. But these are personal opinions. The 2 stars came from how long it took get our check, then the even longer time to come get our credit card. We finally had to dig through our three wallets to come up with enough cash to bail us out of there.  Now for the good and bad of the food.  The white queso dip was very tasty. There endeth the good. The steak sandwich was Okay, but lacked any dressing and none was offered. Cheese on top of steak on top of bun. It needed more. The french fries were about the saltiest I ever ate. I went through three glasses of their raspberry tea and was still thirsty. I had to leave about half the plate uneaten. (The raspberry tea was too sweet, even for a sweet-a-holic like myself. Almost syrupy). Maybe if the corporate conglomerate that owned Applebee's put some of its money and thought into the food it serves, they could cut back on their ubiquitous television commercial and we'd all be happier. I know I would."
Alicia C.,"Carrollton, TX",0,33,11,2.0,2/8/2013,Disgusting food and their drinks are SO NASTY and WATERED DOWN. We go here because it is really the only place that is open late (2am-3am). Service is iffy so please do not expect anything special when you come here.
Cathy S.,"Lewisville, TX",3,7,2,3.0,8/9/2013,"It's okay for a cheap meal. Not the best food, but its good. They do have great late night drink specials!"
Chad C.,"Denton, TX",35,255,50,2.0,10/3/2011,Applebees is Denny's with beer.  Cheap beer.  Know what to expect and drink your dollar beer.
Stef F.,"Dallas, TX",113,425,561,2.0,3/19/2014,"You will only see me here after 12AM and only if other restaurants I wanted to go to are closed. My gal pals and I would meet here for drinks and appetizers. They have great happy hours but I would never recommend their food. I think most of their food is frozen and most of the menu is something deep fried. Also, you'll see some of the sketchiest people come here. Also, not very clean, seats are covered with food crumbs. Yuck. Me thinks not!"
Jared J.,"Lewisville, TX",139,139,79,3.0,8/6/2011,I go here for the cheap drinks & appetizers. Plenty of TV's and a great place to catch the game if you want to avoid the crowd.
Trey P.,"Irving, TX",4,39,,2.0,8/28/2011,"I went for my birthday with my wife.  I had the old faithful, chicken fried steak.  This thing came out so blah I had a hard time not telling the manager how bad it was.  I've had frozen dinners that were twice as good as this CFS.  You have to be joking if you say this thing wasn't made at some processed food plant, frozen, shipped here, then microwaved.   The $4 margarita was good but it was over 50% ice. I also came out smelling like an ash tray and we weren't sitting by the bar area.  I'll think twice the next time I take my 2 year old there so she can suck up some second hand smoke."
Quinn S.,"Coppell, TX",100,4,,5.0,7/12/2013,"Food is decent. Beer is cold, prices are right. What sets this place apart from the rest is their custumer service. You can tell they truly care about their custumers."
Kathy C.,"Lake Dallas, TX",0,4,,1.0,12/30/2014,order to go burgers lettuce was bad the one slice of tomato was dried out burger was no better than the fast food places.Also ordered chilli chees fries the chill was burnt and the service was worse than the food when walked in to pick up order the guy said what u want and then we got sent to 3 different people and had to wait 15min more on top of the 20min they said it would take when called in will never go here again.
Brad M.,"Flower Mound, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/16/2013,"Slow service, incomplete orders, no refills round out today's experience.  I should have believed the previous reviews as they were spot on. The best part of the experience was the music, and it was too loud. We won't be back..."
A. T.,"Denton, TX",2,173,,2.0,5/15/2008,"I would not recommend ordering food at this place. That having been said, one of my fondest memories occurred here. I met with 2 friends after work and we had a great time. Maybe it was the alcohol consumed that made it great-no, actually it was the company. Funny thing is, we had long island iced teas, which I never order, but still I had a good time."
