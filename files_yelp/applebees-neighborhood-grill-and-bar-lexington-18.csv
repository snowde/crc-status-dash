Bob J.,"Lexington, KY",5,67,2,4.0,11/5/2017,"Let me be clear... this is to be considered a favorable review, although it starts off badly. It does not address the food or facilities; this review only deals with customer service and satisfaction issues. Upon our arrival this evening, my wife and I were greeted at the door promptly enough.The sound of the NFL game broadcast in the speakers at the door was so loud, I preemptively asked the host to seat us in the quietest part of the restaurant. I didn't go into it with him, but my ears are old enough that a lot of ambient noise makes conversation nearly impossible. He was callously dismissive of my concern, informing me that they keep all the speakers at the same volume - implying that there was no other option available. I explained that this may be true, but if I'm seated at a table and unable to carry on a reasonable conversation with my party, I wouldn't be willing to stay. He acknowledged my remark and proceeded to seat us... directly underneath a speaker that was every bit as loud as we hoped it wouldn't be. It was such a contemptuous move, I found it completely off-putting. As he walked away, I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt and allow him a few minutes to see if he was going to try to act on my request. He had nothing further to say to us throughout our stay. I was ready to leave but thought I'd make a quick appeal of his disrespectful attitude to the server. Upon her arrival, I asked her if the volume of the lone speaker blaring at us could be lowered. She began to explain that their policy is to keep them all about the same. I said that may well be their policy but if they have the ability to adjust it and simply choose not to, she need only tell me up front and I won't waste her time. She offered to take it up with the manager for which I thanked her and she quickly moved back into the kitchen/office area; in a couple of minutes, she returned to check on our satisfaction. It had been reduced, but only marginally and I asked her to please try again.  In a couple of minutes, it had been lowered to inaudible. The manager stopped by the table and I expressed my genuine appreciation. Shay, the server, and the manager won my complete satisfaction.  Let me be clear. I understand the very difficult situation these people are in; the party at one table wants a quiet place to have a conversation while the party at the next table is focused on the game and complains that the volume is not high enough. Granted... I'm sure the owners and management have to make their decisions about how best to handle this. The ""old days"" of separating clientele into smoking/non-smoking sections probably has its drawbacks, but I'd like to believe that simply telling customers that their preferences are of no concern can't possibly be the best strategy.  For what it's worth, even though the speaker above our table had been muted, nearby speakers were still loud enough that my wife and I were able to hear every word of the football broadcast... so it's not as if catering to our request had prevented other customers from hearing the audio portion. But it being muted allowed us to have a MUCH more pleasant dining experience and conversation. Because of Shay and the manager, we left with a high opinion of this store."
Sarah M.,"Lexington, KY",209,407,2016,3.0,1/7/2018,Always okay. Never outstanding. Happy hours give you a great deal on drinks and some appetizers but not generally a spot we enjoy going too without being gift card around the holidays to go to.
Courtney B.,"Lexington, KY",70,11,,3.0,8/26/2017,"The food is okay, service sub par & ready for something like Panera bread to go in with this closes!"
Lamin S.,"Lexington, KY",226,67,35,1.0,6/5/2016,"Worst restaurant experience I can recollect! No stars should be given. My girlfriend and I stopped at this restaurant for a quick bite before going to a event we were volunteering for.  Mid-Saturday afternoon, no restaurant rush. The hostess promptly seated us at a table and took our drink order. Another 15 minutes in,  a ""greenhorn"" waiter took our order. About another 15 minutes later- no side salads brought out or drinks refilled, the waiter asks if how I wanted my meat cooked? I ordered baby back ribs ... Drink still not refilled. Few minutes later, the waiter comes and ask what sides I would like (Should not this be taken with the initial order?). I asked what selections are available; he had to grab a menu ... then another waitress quickly comes out to tell us we could not make changes in our order, which never happen. Apparently, the new waiter got the order totally screwed up. Probably another 10 minutes and my girlfriend's entree comes out. She's teed off by now and lost her appetite and asked for the manager, telling him about our experience. Not inquiring about what happened nor providing an apology,  he tries to convince her to just take a to-go box to keep the order on the bill. Nope. Aaaaaah, now my entree comes from the kitchen. I go right in for the mashed sweet potatoes. They were the consistency of jarred baby food and cool in temperature. The baby back ribs felt warm, like the cook staff reheated the ribs for a minute in a microwave. The only thing that was steaming was the broccoli. At that point, it was a wrap; I didn't want to eat. We asked the hostess for a manager, same manager comes. We tell him about my dissatisfaction, and again he tries to convince to have my meal ready for a to-go box. Nope. We didn't (and was not) have to pay for the bill; leaving with a half-a** apology from the waiter and no apology from management.  No, I wasn't expecting the service of a Morton's or The Palm, but expected much, much more than received. We will not be back at this Applebee's."
Brian K.,"Lexington, KY",52,72,99,5.0,1/19/2017,"I keep going back hoping the service will get better.  Too our great surprise, we had a great meal and excellent service.  My wife and I are watching what we eat so sometimes we like to split a meal.  We selected a steak and two sides.  The waitress had the kitchen split the steak and served each with the side we wanted.  She actually listened.  I'm guessing they have new management or something.  Sure glad."
Rachel H.,"Lexington, KY",96,45,58,1.0,3/19/2016,"I've been here enough times now that I feel I can give a proper review. This 1 star rating is based on this visit along with my other visits that have ranged from 1-3 stars -- most often 2. My mother is allergic to shellfish. Luckily, she isn't so severely allergic that she goes into full on anaphylactic shock. However, her lips burn, she gets a migraine, feels like she can't breathe, and gets light headed. If left without Benadryl or if she's unable to get it within thirty minutes, we aren't sure what would happen and we don't intend on finding out. We were having dinner here and she got a burger. She starts feeling weird after eating half of it, so she looks at her food. A piece of shrimp falls out of the burger. It should be noted that this burger does not come with seafood nor does any variation of this burger. We ask the waitress about it, who had been lovely. My mother explained she was allergic, the waitress apologized and quickly went to get my mom another burger. My mother told her not to, but she did so anyway.  The waitress comes back with our check and the new burger in a box. We see that she actually charged us for both burgers! My mother politely asked if she could just take the new burger off, since she already told her that she didn't want it. We need to leave and get Benadryl. Let's just forget the fact that the last burger has given her an allergic reaction because of random shrimp in it and NO ONE should pay for that. The waitress has the audacity to get an attitude with my mother, raising her voice saying, ""Well, honey, you didn't *tell* me (when ordering) you were allergic to anything!""  Let me be clear, when ordering a basic cheeseburger, you usually don't need to preface that with your shellfish allergy. She continued to have an attitude with my mother. My mother feeling sick and angry left my dad to deal with the manager. While the manager took both meals off because of the waitress and the potential hospital visit, the service and handling of this situation from this waitress was unacceptable on many levels and we will not be going back to this establishment.  Even before this, we had long concluded that it is one of the worst Applebee's', often with subpar versions of the food, absentee service, air conditioning too high along with fans, etc."
Danny D.,"Lexington, KY",773,365,47,5.0,10/20/2016,"Paula is awesome. Ee come and do th 2 for 20.00 or 25.00.  Wife gets a beer, I play with the jukebox lol. Um we liveclose so we keep coming. This location has NO RAP music so we are happy. We never wait to be seated. Food is good."
Jason H.,"Lexington, KY",78,6,,5.0,5/22/2016,Food was great....Jordan B was excellent! Top notch. Did endless soup and salad man had too much to each.
Chad C.,"Lexington, KY",424,823,1602,2.0,4/12/2014,Stopped in here for lunch with a co worker and half way through i realized it was a mistake.  The service was horrible and slow.  She apologized for taking 25 minutes to take my drink order.  Then apologized for being 45 minutes or so to get the soup salad lunch special.  It wasn't even that busy to be a lunch rush.   The waitress tried to tell me that the reason for the chaos was that they got a new computer system and no one can use it.  Excuse after excuse. We didn't get a refill and we won't be back.  awful.
Mike P.,"Paoli, IN",2,17,12,1.0,4/1/2016,Went here for lunch. Stood at the waitress/waiter stand for 5 minutes for someone to at least acknowledge the fact that I was there. They didn't. I left. There were maybe 10 people in the whole restaurant.
Adam L.,"Lexington, KY",0,2,,1.0,10/4/2015,"I attempted to order some appetizers car side to go. It took two calls to get anyone answer the phone. The lady that took my order was not friendly. She informed me that I would need to come into the bar to get my food, car side to go is not active on Sunday's. Upon arrival I was greeted by three servers smoking on the ramp in front of the takeout entrance. My presence seem to irritate them.  I went to the bar as instructed to pick up my food. I waited on the edge of the bar for at least five minutes for the bar tender. She was in deep conversation with one of the four patrons at the bar. In five plus minutes she didn't acknowledge my presence or the other three patrons at the bar. I tried to find a manager to help me and they were no where to be found. I decided at that point to go elsewhere.  In the past when I was able to get my food, it wasn't bad. Their wings and appetizers are typically pretty good;however their service continues to be terrible almost every visit. I'm at the point that I cringe when people suggest meeting there for lunch or for drinks. The servers do not care about providing service at this establishment and as far as I can tell the managers do not care much either. If you are in the mood for applebees, it's probably best that you dine at the other Lexington locations."
Matthew B.,"Lexington, KY",58,74,47,5.0,1/16/2016,Absolutely LOVE going here after church for the Unlimited Soup & Salad. Was also impressed with the waiters suggested pairing of what goes best together. He was absolutely correct on each & every one.
Bill O.,"Alvaton, KY",0,3,,1.0,6/30/2016,"This could possibly be the worse place I've eaten .....and paid for just to expedite my departure.  Perhaps I could.give a better rating but why ...I often travel and work in the area and all 3 times in a span of 6 weeks, I thought surely it can get better.  Different shifts, waiters, bartenders....didn't change anything.   Maybe the management,  who knows?  All I can say is I'm not going back and cannot recommend this establishment."
Jacob S.,"Lexington, KY",0,14,16,4.0,1/4/2015,"This location opened a few years ago and was absolutely terrible. They have made some serious headway and I am loving the service. My gripe is with corporate and them taking a picture of the ""All-In"" burger looking like the toppings are mixed into the meat, where they are actually pressed into the top of the pattie. Should be renamed the ""On-Top"" burger. For that, they lose one star."
Josh M.,"Lexington, KY",87,183,181,1.0,3/10/2015,"Can I not give a place minus stars. Never been a fan but my daughter for some crazy reason tonight wanted tri-o so we worked out I have a beer and get take out for her and then me at another place that I liked. Win win until 50 min in of trying to have a beer and order just take out of couple apps. Order placed and beer in front but to make chicken taco's, boneless wings and pretzel sticks takes 45 min! Pushed call waiter button on stupid table at 25 min mark and had to push again to only see on its fancy screen my order of food never went in until my sec push of button and never spoke to a single person sense I got my beer at the 10 min mark of 50! Once she came back 50 min later she told me our order was taken buy another take out, but not to worry ""I made It fresh for you!""  Great lady, you made a take out order fresh of apps we orders 50 min ago, so good thing I did not get them right away, as they might have been too Fresh!! Maybe not even warm yet! I don't write negative reviews as I try not to be negative about a place, as everyone had a bad night, or not for me. But I wish I could write One more negative about this visit. At end of the day only simple take out order and its my fault I came back. Your beer can be free and it's too much for me to come back."
Ken C.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,2,1.0,9/29/2015,Worst good at super high price. Will highly recommend never go to this place for food.
James R.,"Lexington, KY",39,43,2,2.0,1/14/2015,"After all it is Applebee's so I cannot and do not expect much, BUT this is not great by Applebee's standards. You know how there are some nice walmarts and some that are scary.....same thing here, not great."
Heather P.,"Lexington, KY",1367,1367,6002,3.0,4/11/2012,"I don't like the fact that there isn't ""happy hour"" on the weekends. If you get the unlimited soup and salad special during lunch hours, the portions are small so if you order more than one you could be waiting a while. Whenever I get the appetizer sampler, something in it always comes out cold. All in all, it's conveniently located so I keep coming back despite the issues."
Joey M.,"Lexington, KY",0,4,,1.0,4/11/2016,"I've been to this location several times; when you walk in you have to wait for someone to notice you. There seem to be employees gathered in the corner  eating , on their phones that don't want to get up to wait on customers.  I went inside to pick up a to go order after no one came out to my car; employees gathered in to go area eating, on phones, could hear loud music and cursing from the kitchen--really unprofessional!"
Karintha S.,"Louisville, KY",77,4,,1.0,7/31/2015,"Dont go here...they have poor hygiene. Ordered a carryout order-got there and half my order was wrong. They offered to fix it, but failed to understand that while I waited the 15 additional mins for the corrected portion of my order the rest of my food was going to be cold. I asked for new fries for both orders, and while I was waiting I could see the line where they prepared the food. I saw the employee take his hands (UNWASHED AND UNPROTECTED) and dip them in a bowl of fries. He came back and preceded to hand my the food ""the fresh fries""-i immediately stopped him and asked if he washed his hands. After beating around the bush i told him to just tell the truth cause I clearly saw him do it...He finally iadmitted that he didn't wash them, but failed to see a problem with him taking his hands and preparing my food. He had the worst attitude with me as i did aomething wrong in asking him if washed his hands.HE WAS NOT THE ONLY EMPLOYEE TO DO THIS EITHER I witnessed two other people use their hands to get other people's fries. (Mind you they were old sitting in a bowl under heat lamps). The manager said he will make corrective actions, but I highly doubt it. It's pretty disgusting, and refused to take any of the food home-i simply just wanted my money back."
Ron M.,"Georgetown, KY",52,62,69,1.0,6/24/2014,"I came here on a Tuesday afternoon about 330 in the afternoon and when I walked in and there was no host to provide seating and I waited about 4 minutes and I saw servers waiting on their table glance at me as they served their tables. Never saw the host, and was never acknowledged so I walked out"
Laura L.,"Seattle, WA",46,248,4,1.0,10/27/2012,"There is one truth about chain restaurants: all of their food comes from a central warehouse, mostly prepared, and even the most naked of things (chicken breasts, steaks) arrive pre-brined and injected with ""flavor"" before they hit the grill.  This provides a standard flavor that should carry you from location to location, so your favorite dish stays your favorite dish. You don't walk into Applebee's looking for a gourmet experience, just as you don't walk into Starbucks for two expertly pulled shots of espresso in a warmed porcelain cup.  You may be surprised on the rare occasion, but at best, you come in hungry and leave fed. This experience, however, was one of dismay.  I was pleased to see Weight Watchers approved options, and even imagined that this meant that steamed broccoli and potatoes would taste light and fresh next to the steak.  Instead, I got a mouthful of MSG and diacetyl.  Mind you, it was probably natural MSG in the form of autolyzed yeast extract, but I'm near positive it was diacetyl (think Molly McButter) adulterating the otherwise limp broccoli.   Steak, broccoli and potatoes - these things are hard to mess up!  A little salt and pepper, a little olive oil (we're talking less than a tsp) is all you need to make these ingredients (if fresh) shine.  Instead, though, I was left with that dregs-of-microwave-popcorn aftertaste.  It wasn't pleasant. I will grant that they may have only been following the deranged recipe from corporate to the letter - but I kindly ask the cooks to consider nuance before covering the food in so much chemical enhancers. A little ""flavoring"" goes a long way."
Leah T.,"Richmond, VA",12,41,,1.0,9/26/2011,"Man, has Applebee's ever been good? I remember liking it back in the mid-90s, and I don't know whether my tastes have changed or whether it used to be better than it is now. At any rate, I go to Applebee's for two unconnected reasons: 1. To eat the maple butter blondie, which is probably the only reason the chain is still around. 2. To get an ego boost regarding my own cooking because everytime I eat there I say ""man, I could've made this same dish, only about 10 times better!"" Still, the blondie rules."
Elaine G.,"Lexington, KY",0,3,,2.0,3/18/2014,"The three cheese penne was disgusting and inedible, I only wish I had attempted to eat it while dining in so I could complain to management but unfortunately I got it to go."
Ernie D.,"Lexington-Fayette, KY",96,127,21,4.0,12/30/2011,"Since my original review, they seemed to have changed things up a bit. It looks like they put some money into brightening the place up and maybe hired a new manager or something. The wait staff is excellent and the two or three times I've been recently have been pretty good experiences. Nothing like my previous review."
Krista M.,"Lexington, KY",0,2,,3.0,12/31/2011,"Food is good, service friendly, but the music is playing so loud at this location that communication with your table mates is out of the question. Applebees, it's a restaurant, not a club. Please turn down the volume so it is background music."
