Malinee S.,"Lake Stevens, WA",211,298,833,3.0,10/16/2017,I had pork chop. It was ok. A little bit burnt but still not dry. The apple sauce was good. The side veggies were over cooked.  Strawberry Margaritas was weak and sweet.
Darlene T.,"East Burke, East Burke, VT",0,1,,1.0,10/22/2017,"My husband and I took our daughter and boyfriend out to dinner last night. We were told that it would be a 30 minute wait, the problem being is that there was at least 6 booths that were empty, a number of dirty tables and not one person attempting to make a effort to clean the tables. Finally after getting seated, our waitress came and took our drink order then took our food order when returning with our drinks. After waiting for over 25 minutes a different server bought the  appetizers but not the ones we ordered , then 5 minutes later our server comes over and tells us that someone took the wrong ones and it would be 10 minutes. Finally after getting the correct appetizers our meals finally come. We had asked for steak sauce and ranch dressing and had to ask 2 more times before receiving it. My husband had to stop another server to get another soda. I would never recommend anyone go here, the servers were not friendly and we so slow. There was a couple at the table across from us that had order 2 Salads and 2 burgers, the lady had to stop a server to if they were going to get their salads. When the server put the salads on the table and walked away. The lady then had to stop a server again to ask if they could have some silverware. Also there was a male manager who was walking around doing nothing. He and a number of the servers would walk by dirty tables and not pick anything up from the tables. This was an awful experience, we will never go back."
D W.,"Potsdam, NY",40,559,253,3.0,4/19/2017,"Easter weekend not much to choose from around here so ended up in this chain...the place was buzzing and the food was actually OK- drinks good too. Only complaint is the bartended NEVER wiped counter down after anyone left from eating or drinking... damn , I wish I would have known that before I sat down at the bar and ate...."
Elizabeth D.,"Lisbon, NH",0,11,,2.0,9/13/2017,"We always wait so long for food it's crazy! Staff is always nice and friendly. It's not worth it to skip the 30 minute wait at another restaurant to go here though because you end up waiting longer for your meal. Never a line to be seated and there is a reason. Food is really hit or miss here, so it's not worth the wait usually."
James J.,"Littleton, NH",0,4,,5.0,4/6/2017,My wife and I went here for dinner and were blown away by the server. She was very attentive and our meals were excellent. We will definitely be going back soon
Johnny F.,"Houlton, ME",5,171,102,2.0,11/6/2014,"Well its Applebees, typical chain restaurant, typical atmosphere,  typical, typical,  typical.  Only good thing is the large draft beers."
Aaron L.,"Concord, NH",19,41,40,2.0,7/7/2014,"Convenient location with decent staff. Food is ok, portions are smaller, reminds me of a smart one microwave lunch with fresh basil and tomatoes.  I have dinned here at least ten times and the food is consistently bla. Not sure if it is an Applebee's thing or a Littleton thing.  Service is decent on all levels. Every time I eat here I regret not going to the place down the street.. But the convenience makes me come back...."
Em F.,"Bethlehem, NH",2,35,56,1.0,4/6/2016,Been here before and the experience is always the same. Poor customer service. This time we walked in to a waiting person by the hostess station. So now there are 2 people waiting .... Then a third couple walks in. The whole time there are waitstaff and a bartender passing and NOT acknowledging us. By the time the bartender yells 'I'll be there to help you out in a second' we just decided to go to 99 across the street. Such a poor work ethic in Applebee's. They either need to get better management or smarter waitstaff ... Actually both would be better because compared to the crowd at 99; 99 blows Applebee's out of the water.
Raul L.,"Town N Country, Tampa Bay, FL",11,130,124,4.0,9/3/2015,"I most say I had good time while I was here. I ate their after the dinner rush hour. I was tired from the long day at work and our bartender took care of us with our food and our drinks. Now, now don't make that quick judgement it was a school night. Lol.  I look forward in going back here. The food was great and the hospitality was outstanding."
Raii T.,"Brockton, MA",0,47,,5.0,8/5/2016,"I hate Applebee's but the experience here was great.  Updated and clean areas. The staff was friendly, we waited a while for the food but the server checked on us regularly.  Would def go back."
Brian H.,"St. Albans, VT",53,271,74,4.0,9/18/2015,"Demoting my original review to 4 stars as it appears, on my last trip down, that the night shift here is almost a complete opposite of day shift. The service, the food, just about everything is so off once the dinner bell gets rung. So, if anything, come for the lunch!"
Matt D.,"Stowe, VT",2,19,1,5.0,6/28/2015,"Im quite surprised to see such low reviews for this Applebee's. It has to be one of the top places to go with my friends.The food is good,  it's consistent, and the service is good as well. It's a smaller restaurant, and I've never had any issues when it came to making a reservation. It's what I expect from a chain style restaurant. What more can I say?"
Shannon T.,"San Jose, CA",36,220,8,2.0,9/8/2009,"We came here because there was not much around but it was not good... I would say slightly less quality maybe because we're in a relatively rural area (it is new hampshire after all, lol).   And, as the only Asian patrons, we did get some funny looks when we went in.  Service was fine, but I did feel like a bit of a novelty."
