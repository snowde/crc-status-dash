Jessica P.,"Livonia, MI",33,60,3,3.0,8/27/2017,"Three stars because Applebee's has always just had mediocre food where its okay but Ive def had better elsewhere. It is a good place to go when nobody knows what to get because of the variety. You can never go wrong with their ribs and fries, it has always tasted good! Same with the coleslaw. The place is never busy and the workers are really friendly and helpful."
Hasan H.,"Farmington, MI",0,5,1,1.0,12/5/2017,"This is the worst restaurant I've been to. My wife and I ate there last night, and my wife got food poisoning from their food. She was throwing up at 3 am and I had to take her to the emergency room, the doctor said all her symptoms were of food poisoning. Also, we sat ourselves at a high top in the bar area, because we stood too long in the front. No one welcomed us or even offered us water after we sat down, I had to ask one of the servers if she wanted to serve on our table or not. Food and service are bad. Why even bother be open?! I'd give them 0 stars if I could."
Alex T.,"Livonia, MI",34,234,5,1.0,3/25/2017,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I am generally a fan of Applebee's.  I don't expect anything spectacular when I go, but I have been to them enough to know what to expect.  This Applebees dropped the ball in almost every way. A coworker and I went there to watch some NCAA Tournament games on our lunch break.  We showed up and there wasn't a single TV with the games on in the bar area.  It's the NCAA Tournament, one of the biggest sports events of the year, and nobody in the place was on top of it.  After asking to have a couple of the TVs switched so everyone in my party could see, it took almost 15 minutes. Our drinks (waters) took forever to show up.  Our waiter messed up our order, which took forever to arrive, and we had to remind him of what we had asked for several times. Overall, it was the worse experience I have had at Applebee's.  Generally, I believe Applebee's is a good value, but this one certainly is not.  It seems that a management change needs to be made because this restaurant has serious operational issues.  I will likely return to Applebee's in the future, just not this location.  There are too many better options within sight of this restaurant."
Erica F.,"Farmington, MI",65,62,11,1.0,2/4/2017,"Three strikes, you're out Applebee's.  Above the other two lousy experiences I had at this location, this one was the cherry on top of the cake that I refuse to ever come here again. Long story short, we ordered a couple meals from this location over the phone, we came to pick it up, they took the card, swiped it, we signed, we figured the transaction was done. Wouldn't be giving it a one star review if this was where the story ended. A couple hours pass and I believe it is around the time the restaurant must have been closing and we get a phone call from a 313 number so we let it ring. We then listen to the voicemail that was left... There was a few seconds of chatter between employees before the message was left where Applebee's asked us to come up to the restaurant WHILE they were CLOSING because apparently the transaction wasn't fully made. At the end of the message there was more talk between the employees of which I could clearly hear her say ""she'll call back, she was a nice OLD lady""...  We ended up calling Applebee's back to leave them with our phone number because there was no way we were driving up there in the middle of the night for a mistake that THEY made. They never called back, must not have been that serious of an issue.  Don't waste your time at this location. Not to mention, on the last review I posted I received an email from the GM saying to return to their location after 30 days and saying they would be ""back on track with delivering great experience like they should""... Maybe your workers aren't providing this great experience that you speak of."
Amanda G.,"Redford Charter Township, MI",71,122,32,1.0,9/29/2016,"I'm finally fed up with this Applebees. It's such a consistently bad experience every time I try to come here. We've seen it all, from waiters that smell like 10 packs of cigarettes burned at once, to waitresses families letting their kids jump in our booth while we're sitting there (repeatedly), all served with extremely watered down drinks. One time we walked in around lunch and the music was so loud we had to yell (I mean YELL) to hear each other across the booth. Since then we not-so-lovingly call this establishment Club Applebees.  Do yourself a favor and go next door to MOD and enjoy good service and food cooked in an oven instead of a microwave."
Erin B.,"North Charleston, SC",6,27,26,4.0,5/27/2017,"Good service & good food makes a good combination. I didn't give 5 stars b/c I did have to ask twice for extra dressing for my salad. And although my niece said her steak off of the kids menu was good, it appeared that she was having a tough time cutting it. No juice flowing from it at all."
Kwajalyn B.,"Warren, MI",84,1,,3.0,7/7/2017,It's always a pleasure the food is okay most of the time the drinks were watered down last time hopefully they've corrected that problem but the spinach and artichoke dip is a favorite of all time.
Erin D.,"Redford Charter Township, MI",50,1,,1.0,8/1/2017,"Terrible service, cold food & filthy restrooms! The only time the waitress paid any attention to us was to chase us out the door for 39¢ we owed after leaving cash on the table since we never got a bill. I thought this place was managed well but obviously not. Disappointing to say the least."
Malice M.,"Detroit, MI",27,11,,1.0,10/8/2017,"This place is brutal. Went there on Saturday afternoon to grab a quick lunch. Upon entering, there was one single customer in front of us waiting to be seated. The person who I assume was the manager greeted her and said she had to clean a table for her. The manager then proceeded to clean about 8 tables before returning to seat the single customer. I should add that this was around 1 pm on a Saturday and there were no more than 10 occupied tables. After seating the woman in front of us, the manager returned about 5 minutes later to say that she had to again clean a table for our table of 3. There were over 8 unoccupied clean tables and booths available at this time. By now we'd been waiting over 10 minutes to be seated so we made the educated decision to leave and dine somewhere else. This was only the second time we have tried to eat here and actually never made it to a table. Sorry I can't comment on the quality of the food, but the service is quite atrocious."
Jaki F.,"Livonia, MI",4,3,,1.0,4/1/2017,Sat for about 10 minutes. No drink order but asked to move since the child in the booth behind us was blaring a movie on her moms phone. Once moved we sat for 10 more minutes while waitstaff passed us by 5 times. Left and went next door. Unreal. Please just pick up this place and put it over the Detroit border because that's the whole attitude in there. East Livonia has turned into a pit.
Kelly S.,"Livonia, MI",71,2,,1.0,2/18/2017,"Horrible from the beginning. Staff was very unprofessional. Server didn't write order down, needless to say everything came out wrong. Fries were cold and could tell they were fried in old grease. Will not be back, unless managers actually take charge. Could go on and on what I witnessed."
Olivia W.,"Livonia, MI",0,9,2,2.0,4/16/2017,"I keep trying to give this place chances, but they keep messing it up. the waitress i got last week was rude, it took almost 20 minutes for our drinks when they weren't even busy. today i called for takeout and got hung up on, then i called back and gave a very specific order. they didn't do anything i asked and i checked the receipt, the guy didn't put anything i wanted on the order and was rude when he came to my car to bring the food."
Kate B.,"Livonia, MI",22,2,,1.0,3/18/2017,The WORST car side service. They don't put as much effort into take out in the first place and then make you sit and wait at least 20 minutes past when the food is supposed to be ready. None of the other applebees locations are this bad. I have fallen into this trap too many times. I am done with this location.
Crystal R.,"Westland, MI",123,24,3,5.0,5/21/2016,Even though we missed happy hour the drinks prices were more than reasonable. Chante was our bartendar abd she made us fantastic shots called chocolate cake. They taste JUST LIKE chocolate cake and super smooth. Will definitely go back!
Graziella B.,"Wayne, MI",146,122,183,3.0,11/20/2016,Service is real slow - so if you're not in a hurry to eat! We placed our order about 35 mins ago and still waiting
Jennifer C.,"Livonia, MI",1,5,,1.0,2/23/2017,"Horrible experience. Waited an hour for our food, then they served us a burnt hockey puck of a burger. Disgusting."
Cristina B.,"Chesterfield, MI",260,136,64,4.0,3/16/2015,"This brand new location is absolutely beautiful. Without a doubt the cleanest Applebee's I've been to! While the lobby is lacking, I've been here a few times already and never had to wait long so I don't mind. Service can be hit or miss, but I've given them the benefit of the doubt considering they are still a new location. This location has great TVs to watch the game so be prepared for a longer wait on game days! They also have great coupon specials so look for those as well. Applebee's itself is always changing their menu. My guy and I ordered a spicy shrimp appetizer last time and it came out kind of thrown together. Looked nothing like the picture but at least it tasted good! As for my chicken chicken wrap, it was thrown together as well and fortunately, I wasn't able to eat it as a wrap. The whole thing fell apart when the server set it on the table! I would've asked for a new one but I didn't want to bother our already busy waiter.  Despite this, my guy and I each enjoyed our meals and were happy with our overall service. Without a doubt, one of the cleanest Applebee's I've been to and the one with the best food."
Michael P.,"Livonia, MI",0,67,,2.0,4/29/2016,"Feels a little weird critiquing an Applebee's but felt the need since I've been to this one at least 3 times and the experience has been consistent. VERY LOUD!!! Newly built, they have Bose speakers throughout, and they love to crank them. It's more like a night club than a family restaurant.  On this occasion I opted for the tried and true Burbon Street Sirloin. When the manager asked how it was, I mentioned that it was not what I had come to expect. Manager stated in a condescending tone that it's because ""they now use a much higher quality beef."" Be it as it may, the old cut had much more flavor and tenderness.  Needless to say I did not finish nor take home. So long Burbon Street Steak! So long Livonia Applebee's!"
Jessica P.,"Livonia, MI",0,5,1,5.0,10/16/2016,"This was yet another great experience at the Middlebelt location. The dining room was fairly busy, but we were seated right away. Our server Whitney was very polite and prompt. Our meals were served hot and tasted good. I was disappointed when I was informed that the bone in wings were not available, however, I was satisfied with the entree I chose instead. Very happy overall. Keep up the good work!"
Virginia W.,"Trenton, MI",0,15,20,1.0,6/26/2016,"Came with my family for dinner. Experience was horrible. The wait time was ridiculous! As long as we were there  all we got was the appetizer and drink refills. When they finally brought our food, mine was freaking cold!!!! He offered to have it reheated but what do I want a cold plate reheated for? I had to tell him I want my food remade! I was not happy at all. Then for my replacement order, I had waited too long again and didn't we want it anymore! My prior experience at this location was great and that's why I came but they dropped the ball this time."
Timothy D.,"Livonia, MI",94,15,8,4.0,8/29/2015,We just moved into the area and this is the best Applebee's we have been too. Food is always like we ordered and delicious. Service is excellent and the majority of the time a manager doesn't round so you can get $5 off the next visit. (this occurred three of the five times we've been there) The atmosphere is fun and loud. The decor is based off everything Livonia.
Jim F.,"Livonia, MI",1,9,16,4.0,9/3/2015,"Top shelf long Island iced tea only $5 at happy hour. ..awesome,  so delicious. This place is awesome, the manager stopped by to make sure everything was good, that means a lot to me."
Andrew B.,"Livonia, MI",4,4,,1.0,4/7/2016,"Have ALWAYS loved applebees but this time permanately ruined this location for me. After finally deciding to get out of the house after a recent series of traumatic events, all we wanted was a burger and a beer. We are both pretty easy going and always tip well, being that we both used to be servers. Basically, our server ignored my request for water when I clearly needed it to take a medication before dinner and I made that obvious. Food took nearly 45 minutes and the burger my girlfriend ordered was wrong completely. When we told the manager she basically biffed us, and insisted the burger was done right. Whatever. She ate it and didn't make a fuss. I could go on but the main point is that the service and food was terrible and if we asked for anything it took forever to get it."
Jessica O.,"Macomb, MI",0,23,,5.0,1/17/2016,"I previously wrote a very negative review on this location over an obnoxious, lazy and completely inefficient bartender who we had a poor experience with on multiple occasions. I vowed I would NEVER return to this location but my fiancé convinced me yesterday to give it another try. I reluctantly did, and chose to sat at the bar after seeing there was a different bartender.  This experience was like night and day! I believe our bartender's name last night was Jamison- he was pouring drinks for not only a completely full (and quite large) bar, but also for the entire restaurant BY HIMSELF. He took our drink order immediately, asked if we wanted to eat, ensured we liked our food, and our drinks were never empty. He was so friendly and really made sure the customers were taken care of. I am hoping that next time we go back, we get him as a bartender because he did a phenomenal job!"
Daniel S.,"Redford, MI",25,50,35,1.0,8/7/2015,Horrible if I wanted to eat rubber I would chew on my car tire! Who eats this crap it was absolutely awful!!
Mel N.,"Dearborn Heights, MI",0,5,,5.0,6/8/2015,"Went in for late night snack attack with friends.  Server was nice, fun and offered some great suggestions for our appetizers and cocktails.  The Pearl Island is now my ""go-to"" drink there!  We couldn't decide on what we wanted so our server suggested their late night 1/2 off apps and their Build Your Own sampler which had a lot to offer. Food was delicious and we actually loved that the items came out separately which allowed us to share and enjoy the food while hot. Definitely a place we will back to very soon!"
Francis D.,"Detroit, MI",2,24,,4.0,4/28/2016,"Wonton tacos were great, lite and flavorful, the pita burger had great flavor as well. very tasty, I like that the burger was filling and tasty, great flavor, mushrooms, bacon, cheese, crispy pita bread, cabbage instead of lettuce great choice. The service was good, waitress was attentive and responsive. Went just after lunch crowd, so quiet and decent service. I have never been to Applebees in all these years and found the experience very pleasant. The prices seem to be fair. Did a 2 for $20 and seemed like a good deal. with a variety of options in that price range. I would recommend."
Karen H.,"Westland, MI",0,1,,4.0,7/12/2016,I came to this location with my parents and 2 children for my father's 74th birthday. My server was bre and she was really kind and sweet. She immediately took our drink order and offered us appetizers as we waited for my parents to arrive. My bloody Mary was really good and cheap. Our appetizer came out fast and hot. The food could've been better but over all it was pretty good. Jenna the manager stopped by and was very accomadating. I will be visiting this location again
Kenneth B.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",11,9,,5.0,6/11/2016,"Applebee's revisited... After speaking with a General Manager about my experience, he was gracious enough to give us a gift card to come back and give them another try.  We went to the location at 6 and Haggerty.  I must say the service was spot on, and the food was delicious.   I will continue to support this location while the other Livonia location gets their act together. Service A++ done by Rachel, and food cooked to perfection.  Thank you again, you've gained my faith in the wood-fire entrees."
Rick C.,"Canton, MI",22,2,,5.0,2/6/2016,"My wife, her friend, and I went in tonight, and it was packed. Still received fast, friendly service. Egypt treated us as if we were his only table when he clearly had sevel. If you ever eat here I recommend asking for him by name, you wont be disappointed. All food was cooked to perfection including my medium rare steak. I have been to high end steakhouses that dont get steaks cooked correctly, and this Applebee's always gets it right. Mel, the manager on the floor stopped by, and added to our experience with friendly conversation, and I love the drink reorder feature available at every table. Thanks to all of you for a great meal. My wife, and I will definitely be back."
Nancy B.,"Livonia, MI",88,2,,2.0,5/20/2016,"Barmaid was good until it was time for my bill, she told me that I had 3 drinks when I know my limit & how many I had..got an attitude b/c she needed to adjust the bill. Not pleased at all and I still tipped..probably more than I should've"
Tony C.,"Livonia, MI",86,297,55,2.0,5/16/2015,"I'm giving this new Applebee's 2 stars simply because the modern look is a pleasant refresh on all other Applebee's I have been to. I live less than a mile away and have been here about 6 times. I have had poor service every time I've gone there. The last time I went I waited 20 minutes to get a server. I was so fed up I complained to Applebee's on Twitter. Never saw anyone who looked like a manager to complain to. In terms of food--it's an Applebee's, it is what it is...."
Mel N.,"Dearborn Heights, MI",115,5,3,5.0,1/29/2016,One of my fave places to eat.  Love that there is a variety of dinner options and kids meals that aren't boring.  Staff is very friendly & we always get great service. I like that there is an portion of the restaurant that has TV's with sports on #DetroitRedWingsFanforlife
Geo R.,"Livonia, MI",32,18,1301,5.0,11/10/2014,Brand new clean hot food ! Friendly and courteous staff! Today was the grand opening and we were very impressed !
Sarah R.,"Redford, MI",60,201,87,3.0,11/11/2014,"The food is standard Applebee's fare, of course.  I ordered Carside-to-Go and they told me it would be about 15 minutes.  A few minutes after I pulled into the designated parking space, a girl came out and told me they had to make my salad over because they ""found something in it.""  I'm not sure what the ""something"" was (a thumb, a frog, a piece of lint, who knows), but I could have lived without knowing it was in my salad.  I appreciate their honesty, though."
Ascel K.,"Inkster, MI",5,37,12,4.0,10/24/2015,I liked this Applebee's. The food was good and came out on time and the waitress was very nice. They have a chocolate lava cake that is really delicious.
Austyn C.,"Detroit, MI",7,57,2,3.0,10/30/2015,"Let's not get crazy - it's still an Applebee's. The menu is the same as any other location, although they have tried to jazz it up with ""bar snacks"" and a small plates menu. This location goes back to when Applebee's used to be about the hometown feel with local items on the walls and local schools represented. It is a much cleaner and modern look at this location."
Tiffany D.,"Detroit, MI",24,21,4,1.0,1/30/2016,I wish I didn't have to select the one star I had to pick.. I absolutely wouldn't recommend this Applebee's to my worst enemy. The food is horrible and I actually got sick. I ordered the buff. And bbq wings I got sick. The staff was horrible including the manager. No customer exp. Whatsoever.
Lissa G.,"Mount Pleasant, MI",57,2,,1.0,10/25/2015,This was the worst experience I've ever had. Not only did food come out cold but at the end of my experience I watched a waitress who was cleaning up another table scrape some dessert out of a bowl that someone else had left and then she ate it. It was the most disgusting thing I have seen in a restaurant ever.  I will NOT be coming back to this location.
Delores G.,"Livonia, MI",18,3,,5.0,1/31/2016,"Special thanks to Kevin for the wonderful service you provided our group this morning. Your patience was truly appreciated. Even though we had some unusual requests, you made sure everyone's needs were met. Thank you!"
