Krista R.,"Warren, MI",2,4,,3.0,2/3/2016,"I was seated rather quickly.   Took quite a while for a server to come to take my drink order.   I got the green bean crispers for free for checking in today.   They were hot and fresh.  I ordered the cedar salmon.  It arrived in a timely manor.  Salmon itself was delicious the spinach, zucchini and potatoes it came with was a bit bland for me but nothing a little pepper couldn't fix.  I got my bill and noticed I got charged for green bean crispers.  I had to have waitress fix this mistake before I left."
Brittany R.,"Detroit, MI",55,228,102,1.0,4/11/2015,"i can't stand applebees, and this location reminded me why. my boyfriend and i went here on a saturday afternoon for lunch, and were greeted promptly by the hostesses at the front. when i got inside i was very impressed by how well they did with the decor for this new location.  we were seated and our waiter came to our table quickly to take our drink orders. it took me a while to figure out what i wanted to eat, but i went with the quesadilla burger and fries. we waited a while to get our food, while we listened to the waiters and waitresses complain about each other, and their job in general. i also observed that the bartender was working hard to get drink orders up, and had to keep yelling out to the servers to come get their guests' drinks. the servers would yell back ""I HEARD YOU!"" with an attitude. this place is just a hot ass mess! not to mention my boyfriend wanted to get a lunch combo in which the manager on duty told us ""Monday through Friday only"" which the menu does NOT state. between the servers being loud and complaining every 5 seconds, and the awkwardness of having to sit and listen to what they were saying, i don't think i will ever come back here. pretty sure this visit has ruined any more chances of me trying applebees again!"
Mandi R.,"Livonia, MI",43,29,1,3.0,5/2/2015,The food was alright. Part of it was cold. Our service was not good. We had to ask to get more water and never got our lemons. I've had a much better experience at other Applebees locations
Justin B.,"Westchase, FL",153,27,,2.0,3/5/2015,"Went last night after my daughters honor society ceremony. Was seated promptly, and the waitress greeted us quickly and had a drink order in before my coat was off. Then, we ordered.  We ordered an appetizer and 3 entrees.   The appetizers were being delivered as they were being made, but the wings took extra long.  Then, the entrees started to come out.  This was about 25 minutes later. The ribs were sent back because they were cold and extra dry.   The manager greeted us, apologized, and offered to replace them, however, they were the last ribs in the entire restaurant.  Had to choose something else, so I ordered a Parmesan steak and shrimp.  My wife also wanted Parmesan sauce for her steak.  This did not come out for over 20 minutes.  For Just the sauce! Completely unacceptable! I had them package my steak to go, because it took almost 30 minutes for a medium rare steak.    All in all, the food tasted good, and despite what some people say or think, the servers are generally pretty good.  They can't, however, serve food that the kitchen does not prepare, or is ill-prepared to deliver.  Too many servers pacing around tables with no food to bring them.    Fix the kitchen problems!"
Lauren K.,"Livonia, MI",2,11,,2.0,1/3/2015,"Horrible service. Left after 20 minutes of being ignored by the wait staff. People on both sides of our table were complaining to management about service. Not a great experience, tried to express displeasure with the server and it didn't seem like it wasn't received and processed."
Steven A.,"Livonia, MI",1,45,1,5.0,8/9/2015,"Arrived on Sunday 1500 hours. Store was moderately busy. Was seated quickly and the person sad very courteous.  The waiter came by with in 1-2 minutes. Brought our drinks very quickly after that. They accepted the coupon for free bar snack through yelp. Appetizers came out in 5-10 min while we waited to give our meals order. The appetizer were hot and fresh. Taste was great.  Service to this point is out standing.  Dinner came out hot and ready. The stake cooked just like I asked for. Perfection in the food and service. This place is great for family an I love the local school pictures.  Tyler worked our table and did an outstanding job. Check number, 7797-111418."
Melvin J.,"Detroit, MI",11,1,,5.0,8/31/2015,"I went there today and my waiter (Tim) was excellent. He made my children laugh by giving them riddles for free refills and even though my food took about thirty minutes the manager (Margaret) came over to check on us and update and brought out our kids food while we wait. The service there was excellent and I had a great time. Thanks again Tim and Margaret, I hope you guys get recognize for this."
Payge T.,"Westland, MI",0,4,,1.0,2/11/2015,"Went there during lunch time and had a pleasant experience. Have gone 3 times at night and every time has been a nightmare.  The first time we didn't get seated for 10 minutes because the hostess wasn't paying attention. Then they got my boyfriends and my food wrong so we had to send it back. The second time we went we were seated right away. My boyfriend ordered and beer, we saw it being poured then we saw it sit at the bar for 15 minutes. I had to ask our server if I should get up and get it or if he will.  The third time we went everything was good until we got our food. We had to send BOTH of our food back TWICE!  Won't be back!! Night staff is very lazy and unprofessional! The manager was the only happy/kind person we talked too."
Michael David P.,"Livonia, MI",42,16,11,4.0,11/10/2014,"Well they just opened today, steak was ordered med rare and it came med well and well done but they fix it and gave us the wrong ones to take home, I eat at different apple bees a lot so I'm sure the place would get better once they been open for a while, so I'm pretty sure that by the next time I be there it will be 5 stars. :-)"
Alicia S.,"Royal Oak, MI",0,19,,1.0,11/8/2015,I will not go to this applebees ever again. The first couple times i was there i had AMAZING service! I wish i would have gotten the servers name but she was awesome and prompt and really helpful as far as suggesting. But i came in for carry out the other day and i ordered online well i opted for the PICK UP not car side to go well when i went into the restaurant the i was told to go to carside to go... so i did sat in my car for about 5-7 mins and NO ONE came so I went into the restaurant again.. and told them i was there for a pick up... she said okay and then 5 mins goes by... and nothing... the girl didnt even get the name for the pick up so what exactly was she doing?
Liz B.,"Tampa, FL",0,59,19,2.0,6/4/2015,"I took my niece here for her high school graduation lunch....BIG mistake.  The food was not very good.  I ordered the Triple Hog Dare Ya sandwich with chips (at the waitress' suggestion).  The sandwich was advertised to have pulled pork, ham, bacon, cheddar, and crispy onions.  I didn't see any pulled pork on the sandwich at all, and the chips were overcooked.  When the waitress came by and asked if I liked the chips, I told her no and she just said, ""Well I guess it's just personal preference"".  She didn't offer to replace them with fries, like I thought she should, but whatever.  And before we were done eating, without asking if we wanted anything else, she brings out the bill and lays it on the table.  So I guess she didn't want us to order anything else.  I forgot why I don't like Applebee's, but today's lunch reminded me why I avoid this place!  I'll be sure to patronize another restaurant next time."
Amanda L.,"Farmington Hills, MI",1,29,17,1.0,4/7/2015,"Honestly disappointing. I've never been a huge fan of Applebee's to begin with , always felt like they had mediocre food with not so mediocre prices, but I had a great experience out in Grand Blanc once I decided to give this new one a whirl.  Our server was training someone and the trainee was really nice and attentive but the trainer seemed to care less. The food took a little while considering how slow it was but not too bad. Once the trainee dropped the food off we didn't see anybody for a long time and were waiting to order dessert. The trainer finally came back over and just offered the check, no asking how out meal was, which was pretty gross to be honest, no offering of dessert. Once we ordered dessert he seemed pretty irritated. While waiting for the dessert I over another table complaining about their pasta, which didn't surprise me at all after I read the rest of these yelp reviews. Dessert came out after a few minutes and he dropped the check off and never came back to check on the food yet again nor did he offer a ""have a great day, come back again"". I won't be back again. The service is absolutely horrible (and I've waited tables for 9 years so there is no excuse for this lazy complacent behavior) and the food is mediocre at best. Spend $5 extra dollars and have an amazing meal at outback across the street. They never disappoint."
Dennis M.,"Redford Charter Township, MI",0,4,88,1.0,2/11/2016,shame on me. this was my 4th and final attempt to eat at this new restaurant. on every visit my food came out cold or 40 minutes after I ordered my food. for a brand new restaurant they have certainly don't care to bring in new customers and keep them happy. TERRIBLE SERVICE and TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.
