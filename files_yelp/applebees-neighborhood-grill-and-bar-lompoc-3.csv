Olivia C.,"Lompoc, CA",4,5,3,5.0,7/28/2017,Finally had good service here after how long in business!? I'm sure it's the new staff! Yvette was amazing!
Kianna S.,"Santa Barbara, CA",25,23,28,1.0,12/14/2017,"Very disappointed with this restaurant. In December, they have these signs on all of the tables that say if your server doesn't mention buying an Applebees giftcard, you get a free appetizer for your next visit. Our server didn't mention it, so I brought it up to the hostess as we were leaving. She told us that because we stood up from the table they couldn't give it to us. That is ridiculous! It doesn't say that anywhere on the sign. Don't advertise something if you aren't going to follow through with it."
Elizabeth B.,"Santa Barbara, CA",4,101,108,3.0,9/18/2017,"We would have given our visit to this Applebees location 5 Stars....However, the service was AWFUL! We waited about 10 minutes by the hostess stand, numerous employees walked by not saying anything. We grabbed our own menus and sat down at a booth. We started using the electronic ordering system situated on the table to order. (We really liked this feature). Anyway, a waiter came over and asked if we were ready to order, when I told him I was using the electronic system, he briskly left and was NEVER seen again. Th only positive aspect of our visit was the food, it was delicious, 10/10! But, considering we received absolutely no customer service, we don't return on planning to this location:"
Michael G.,"Lompoc, CA",76,14,13,4.0,11/4/2017,Becca is awesome!!! I have gone to AppleBee's with my group about 3 times. Everytime we go Becca has always taken care of us with awesome care. Once I believe we weren't even in her section but she seen us waiting. The AppleBee's is like every other but I will always return because of the service given to us from Becca.
Amanda M.,"Lompoc, CA",0,3,1,3.0,1/5/2018,"Applebee's-- while I am terribly disappointed in the quality of your alcohol to full content ratio, I'm glad you guys actually hired some extravert personalities as hosts and hostess this time. Tess at the Lompoc Store was fantastic. Keep her around if you care about keeping your customers content."
Vincent R.,"Santa Barbara, CA",25,42,,5.0,9/29/2017,"My wife and I tried out Applebee's again on a Thursday night around 8pm and they've gotten way better.  Service was quick, the food tasted great, and it definitely exceeded my expectations of my last visit a long time ago.  I'm glad they were able to turn it around!"
Lisa J.,"San Francisco, CA",9,7,,5.0,4/18/2017,"We had the best experience At this Applebee's. Everyone from the hostess to the server to the guy who opens the door (yes, they have a guy who opens the front door for you and greets you and says good buy to you) was very friendly and professional.  Menu choices were great, food was delicious, the wait was not long. I had not been to Applebee's for a few years and I am impressed with how much this restaurant chain has changed."
Madison D.,"Lompoc, CA",0,4,2,4.0,10/28/2017,"The service is good, and the people are nice. The food is what you can expect from a chain restaurant. It never takes too long for our food to be ready, which is a major plus. All around, a pretty decent place."
Trey C.,"Lompoc, CA",47,4,1,1.0,10/7/2017,"The service here is horrible. It took almost 2 hours to get our food, and the server was not good at all. We had to ask for refills, food was cold, and mostly the server stood at the back waiters station talking to the other crew members. We won't be returning, besides the food there really isn't that great."
Yesenia D.,"Lompoc, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/27/2017,"While I normally I would not give Applebee's a great review because most of their workers are lazy do nothing , Jake at the bar has turned this Applebee's  reputation around. Jake makes the bar fun entertaining and just a great place to hang.I only come Sunday and Monday night because I know Jake will he deliver great customer service as a good time !  Also Brad is not to shabby himself !!"
N. S.,"Lompoc, CA",2,43,73,5.0,8/27/2017,Great service here and I've coming to this Applebee's for 4 years now. The staff were friendly and I love the steak and appetizers. I would recommend coming here for dinner. I like to sit in the bar.
Shy C.,"Lompoc, CA",2,12,2,2.0,8/18/2017,"It's great that this place is open so late, especially in a small town like Lompoc. Unfortunately, their food is inconsistent and their service is less than favorable. Big difference compared to the Applebee's I frequented in Phoenix."
Patrick H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,7,2,4.0,7/14/2017,"After a late workout nothing was open in Lompoc but Applebee's.  I was hesitant but ended up enjoying a steak salad.  The server was nice and explained the steak was only 4 oz when I ordered.  She let me upgrade the steaks size.  The food wasn't fancy, but it was good-like a high end Chipotle salad with steak that looked like steak. The restaurant was clean, the waitress was friendly, and I wouldn't hesitate to come again for a late dinner salad.  Four stars for the price.  Update:  the cedar grilled chicken and rice is really good also.  Chicken is juicy and the dish is low cal."
Juana F.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,2,1.0,4/1/2017,"Horrible experience!! Don't go to this restaurant we went with our family party of sixteen from the minute we walked in the door the host was giving us excuses on how are food was going to take long because we were a big group. Well it did but our server said it was because she had a problem with her other table and they were first , and nobody told her she would have to help with our table. To think we convinced our family to come here. Our first time here and it was horrible will never come again. We saw a manager once and he never came to say if he can help or are we ok."
Tami G.,"Greenville, SC",0,21,7,2.0,1/15/2017,"I was very surprised at how slow the service was at Applebee's; I live in the Southeast and have never had this poor of an experience. The server was sweet but the kitchen may have been poorly managed because our food took ""forever""! Our waitress was very knowledgeable to help manage my choices for my food allergies so many thanks to her."
Gene R.,"Hagåtña, Guam",0,29,,4.0,7/6/2017,"Went there on the 4th of July for lunch.  This was the most perfect time to go....no crowds, fast service, and great service too!!  I've eaten here on several occasions and never had a negative experience."
Jackie G.,"Lompoc, CA",0,17,2,1.0,8/20/2017,"Our server Yvette was really nice, but the manager was a bit rude. we showed our server a coupon that was sent to me by corporate. Our server validated right away then she came back and asked me if she could take my phone to her manager because she wanted to see it. I automatically told her no sorry I don't lend my phone to no one which she completely understood. I asked her to tell her manager that if she wanted to see the coupon she could come to the table. The manager came and immediately asked to see the coupon without asking how we were doing nor introducing herself. Then she proceeded to say that they didn't validate coupons because they were usually a scam. I then explained that it was sent to me by their corporate and had my name and the Applebee's address for here in Lompoc. I even told her I could open up the email for her, She continued to be rude and said she would make an exception for it this time. Rude manager!"
London T.,"Schertz, TX",50,7,,5.0,5/25/2017,"Jocelyn is our favorite bartender. She attentive, kind, and even on busy nights at the bar can handle a table or two. My boyfriend and I wish we knew her schedule so we could always come on the nights she's working! This place wouldn't be the same with out her!!!"
Daniel S.,"Conshohocken, PA",166,168,276,3.0,1/7/2017,"I like to watch sports here. Lompoc doesn't offer many sports bar options, so Applebee's will suffice. I get there boneless wings and 22oz Modelo's. Staff is kind and service is speedy."
Enrique F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,2,1.0,2/25/2017,"The only reason I'm leaving one star is because the server was really nice other then that it was horrible. Coming from LA you would think a small city compared to mine would have excellent food, but then again it is LOMPOC. Food was cold and it tasted like a frozen dinner. Whoever is the owner at the location should come and sit down on a Saturday night and study this location. Good thing I live in LA where a mom and pop shop or even a taco truck serve better food."
Steve D.,"Lompoc, CA",0,13,3,4.0,4/1/2017,My Aunt Helen and I frequent Applebee's often. Service is slow so you should know it's going to take time to get your food. We enjoy the 2 for $25 special and we enjoy their desserts. The staff are nice and check in on you regularly. Parking is great and you will find the waiting area is comfortable whenever there is a wait time.
Tawney N.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,1/17/2017,My family and I went for dinner here and I cannot believe how awful the food was! Our waiter was great and that's the only reason why I gave this review a star. The food tasted dry and I don't think they seasoned anything on any of our plates. None of our food had flavor what so ever. I had under cooked shrimp and pretty much had to force myself to eat the rest to make the trip there worth it.
Benjamin H.,"Lompoc, CA",61,5,,1.0,2/18/2017,I hadn't eaten at an Applebee's in years and now I remember why. The food looked nothing like the pictures in the menu and tasted like it was from the frozen food aisle. The service was also extremely slow.
Jeffrey S.,"Lompoc, CA",17,1,,1.0,12/14/2016,"Worst service I have had at any restaurant in Lompoc and on the entire West Coast. Myself and my wife took my Mom and Dad out to dinner tonight for their 54th anniversary. 1. I told the waitress 3 times it was my Mom and Dad's 54th anniversary and no one said happy anniversary, no complimentary ice cream or anything. Two separate tables near us had Happy Birthday sang to them. 2. The waitress told me the chicken breast was moist and very tender so I took her suggestion and ordered it. the chicken was charred on one side and dry.  3. The side dishes on my Wife and my Mom's plates were switched so they had to take the plates back and correct it. My Dad's french fries were cold and they had to bring him another order. 4. Our table was not cleared before we left. Nothing was cleared off the table while we ate. 5. They did not carry brandy for my Dad so he Had one Cognac for 10.50 and my mom had one glass of white wine for over almost 9 bucks get outta here at Applebee's are you serious. 6. The restaurant was not busy and it took 1 1/2 hours from the time we were seated until we finished eating because the service was very slow. Management should be ashamed of their selves. Thanks for making my parents 54th anniversary an experience they will never forget. Next time I want to share a special dinner with my family I will take my business to another restaurant."
Katie K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,2,1.0,12/31/2016,"If there was a zero out of five options, I'd give this Applebee's that.  The service was horrendous. It took the bartender several minutes to ask for our food order after being a giant dick to us when he took our drink orders. He never once asked if we wanted another drink while we waited a significant time for our cold and flavorless food.  He was fastest at getting us our check. Don't go here. Even if it's your only option."
Verenice A.,"Long Beach, CA",26,4,,1.0,10/30/2016,"Where do i begin?! Applebees; a well known food chain just seems to be going down hill in lompoc. I arrive to dinner with my family and notice no staff out in the dining area, it takes someone 5 minutes to greet us and take us to our table. I also notice 6 dirty tables that the staff just walk by and seem to ""not notice"". We wait thirty minutes if not more to receive our appetizers, which was within a short time interval to receive our main dish. To top it off the food is just flavorless. Will not be going back, i rather travel a longer distance for better service and food. I can go on longer but it's pointless because things won't change. Such a disappointment."
Jerri B.,"Lompoc, CA",56,1,,1.0,2/19/2017,"Ordered online my order was suppose to be ready car side to go. Went in a few minutes after the estimated time for pick up for was not ready. Workers didn't seem too friendly at all. So I wait for my food an additional 20 minutes after the time it should be done.  By the time I step foot out the door and in my car i check the food it is cold already and to my surprise my order was missing two sides of fries that comes with the chicken platter.  I go back in tell the server what happen she says oh ya I forgot your fries. Goes back to the nav for 20 more minutes just to get two sides of fries comes out they were not fresh so long story short had a whole bunch of cold nasty food,by the time I got home. This place has only gotten worste. Please hire a new start of people with better service and quality in the good food the serve. I will never return to Applebees lompoc."
Kat S.,"Lompoc, CA",0,2,,2.0,6/6/2017,"The service was fine, probably because my husband and I were the only customers in the entire restaurant, I ordered the caprese hamburger. It was dry (I ordered med-rare) and very very bland, pretty much tasteless, chicken and shrimp was unremarkable, except shrimp was tiny and mushy. Next time I choose Mac Donald's."
Ana M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/1/2017,"Worst service ever. The waitress Cora needs to be fired. If she doesn't like her job she should go back to school and find a job she likes. Instead of making her customers wait 1 hr without any silverware, water, or food. Waited for 1 hour before we decided to walk out with no food."
Mar G.,"Lompoc, CA",90,5,,1.0,1/14/2017,"I'll stick with just my drinks and steak Quesada appetizer ONLY  ...  since that's all that's good anymore the main course are terrible ....... staff is friendly and always amazing but as for food they need to seriously step up and quality check there food before it comes out if you won't eat It your self don't serve it to your customers I'm a regular were in  quite  frequent,  and even on slow days the foods isn't so good . Hope things change soon ...."
Anthony P.,"Pasadena, CA",14,9,52,2.0,12/10/2016,"Seriously.... no thousand island, no Italian dressing, no mini ribs... the list actually was longer. Took almost 10 mins to get order taken  in the bar area too boot!!!"
Philip M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",395,752,957,2.0,3/10/2015,"It is Applebee's, what do you expect? Decent turkey club sandwich + flat soda + horrible service= two stars for you!"
Mark M.,"Chino Hills, CA",7,14,4,4.0,5/24/2016,Went here despite the poor reviews.  Seems they have a new menu going on right now so was willing to try it out. I got the ribs with garlic fries and my friend got the sirloin steak wit macaroni and bacon bits.  All the food came out quickly and was delicious. My only complaint was that the fries were just a little soft. Cooked...but soft.  But my impression of the place was much better than the previous reviews. I'd say don't knock it until you've tried it in this case!
Jara Neriza M.,"Ventura, CA",137,194,357,1.0,1/29/2015,"Uhm. No thank you. You're better eating in the local's divebar, the thai place near by or the sushi places around town. We came here around 9pm after finishing cleaning the apartment in prep to move out. We were tired and hungry to say the least. We were seated quickly. But the good stuff stops there. It took 15mins for our server to come by. By then we were all ready to order. We just want to eat get out and rest. It was a slow night that day. So we're not being inconsiderate or anything. It took another 10 minutes for us to receive our drinks! Drinks! It was only coke. No hassle bustle drink.  But wait there's more. It took another half an hour for the entrees to come in. The bf had their burger and I got their fish and chips. We were ready to call it a night cancel our order and get out already. We finally got our food after flagging down our MIA server. The burger didn't have any seasoning in it no mayo, veggies or anything it was the patty and bread. The fish and chips were cold and limp. Bland and oily.  Needless to say it took another 15minutes for our server to come by and get our bill and payment. If bolting out of there without paying was an option without repercussion we would've definitely done so.  What a disaster."
Rosa M.,"Covina, CA",34,1,,1.0,4/3/2017,"Service? What service? Waited 20 minutes to be seated, waited 40 minutes for a server to take our order and 1 hour to get our food and drinks! This is ridiculous!!! We should have listened to the bad 2 out of 5 star rating. They blamed it on 40 people putting orders in at the same time. They should have politely told us they were not going to be able to help us. When we finally got the food, it was a complete disappointment. Steaks were cold, 1 of the 3 shrimp skewers were dry and cold. My sons grilled cheese did not have the cheese melted. We seriously thought that a discount was the least they could do for us, but to our surprise there was no discount on the check! My husband told the waitress that we wanted to speak to the manager because of the long wait and inconvenience, well the manager never came and instead we got an $8.00 discount of our bill. The problem with this place starts form Management! Oh and the waitress Cora should be fired, she has no customer service skills."
Codigo C.,"Santa Maria, CA",1,13,,3.0,2/27/2016,"Hi all yep im back with the spork report. Here at Appelbees in lompoc ca. Took my wife out for dinner. Soooo here goes... oh no pics this tym... sorry I am the general of foodies of the central coast. Ans i an fair but firm. I ordered ribblets n fries and quesadia burger n fries and boneless chicken wings for myself. My wife had the bug beef natchos, n the bannana cheese cake. 1st the bad. The FRIES OMG all the Fries i had Were 1 COLD and white (they should be golden brown n crunchy, Not tonyt folks, these are white, cold, and soft. Now if any of you foodies out there know about sides n fries there is only 2 ways this would happen. 1. Tooooo many fries in basket, outer ones are golden and all inner ones are basically steamed. Or 2. They have a set time that they need to keep as a minimum,  ans were just pulled early. Either way they sucked. Also the coffee service was slow, unreasonably slow. With a chain this strong this should not be happening. Coffee drinkers unite let them know im ordering coffee cause i love coffeel. So please i dont like to see the bottom of my cup. All the rest of the food was from ok to pretty killer. The quesadilla burger, beef natchos, n ribblets were killer i recomend.  Our waitress Marissa V. Was awesome i recommend pretty smile very nice manners,  polite, very apologetic about coffee service and fries. Offered to have some made for us. But i declined. So to all in all it was a 2star Marissa made it a 3star. Yes Marrisa after the fries and slow coffee service still saved the evening and earned 15% tip.  Restaurant's and customer no service be aware im back, and as always be fair but firm. No Mercy"
Sarah V.,"Lompoc, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/30/2016,"Terrible service, never will I  go again, we gave this place a few chances. Be prepared to wait over an hour for your food."
Lindsay C.,"Lompoc, CA",36,129,90,2.0,10/15/2015,"My boyfriend and I have mutually decided to not come here anymore. We have been constantly disappointed with bad service, bad food, and unpleasant visits. The hours are nice but, it's not worth it when the food isn't good."
Stacey M.,"Lompoc, CA",0,19,1,1.0,4/15/2017,"Comple fail. Called in an order for the family. Brought my food home and my order was wrong not once or twice but a third time and still wrong.  The food was horrible and way over,cooked. What a waste of money. Was better off going to Taco Bell."
Nancy K.,"Lompoc, CA",0,5,2,2.0,9/16/2016,"One of the most disappointing salads ever. Ordered the Southwest Steak salad and received a 2 oz piece of steak with maybe 2 cups of lettuce. Truly, there were 4 black beans and 3 kernels of corn and 1 tablespoon of chopped tomato found at the bottom. For 11.95 I expected so much more. Probably won't be back."
