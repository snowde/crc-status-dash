Ivan G.,"Lompoc, CA",131,11,,3.0,12/29/2013,"I live just a block away from this New Applebee's so I had to come try it out when they opened. I came like a week or two after it opened hoping it would calm down a little bit. It didn't. Nice environment, staff is kinda clueless especially when it comes to the menu and brain dead when it comes to the drinks. Overall okay what can I say it's an Applebee's :)"
Angela Y.,"Santa Maria, CA",71,7,,1.0,11/11/2013,"Customer service sucked! They all need to be retrained!! All they did was talk to each other and not to the people who will be paying them! We had to wait five minuets to be helped once we were helped it took a while for our drinks to come out. When we finally ordered our food, for some reason the server forgot how to take a order and just started writing stuff down or something. Our food came out wrong. Once our food did come to us they never came back to see how we were doing, or filled our drinks. So we sat with empty glasses. When we asked for a to go box he brought out the smallest box they had. When he knew my husband still had most of his food on his plate. When we asked for a bigger box he was unsure if he could even get us the bigger to go box. We will definitely not be coming back. Food was horrible too."
Stephanie M.,"Lompoc, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/27/2013,"I love the food here! I definitely recommend the honey pepper chicken and shrimp or their wonton tacos. Service is amazing, all the servers are friendly and cater to your every needs.Albert, Autumn and Sandy are the best managers I've ever come encounter with. All  the managers are friendly and professional. You can tell they love what they do. I will definitely be coming back here :)"
Ed J.,"Lompoc, CA",1,11,20,3.0,10/17/2013,The staff deserves at least four stars and the place is very clean and new but some of the food we had was terrible.  We will be back but we will definitely not order the Mac&cheese again. The chicken was Ok but the cheese tasted like it was from a box.  Next time I will stick to the ribs like I've had at all of the other Applebee's.
Nemie H.,"Lompoc, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/29/2014,"Went there for my husbands birthday this weekend and I was amazed at how bad the food was.  I ordered a BLT sandwich.  You'd think that would be pretty hard to mess up? Right?  What I got was wilted lettuce and over done bacon coated with some sort of cheese that had been microwaved to a plastic unidentifiable blob all served up on cold soggy toasted bread.  I've never in my life sent anything back to the kitchen... I couldn't get her to take the plate away fast enough. What made things even worse is when the waitress brought out our food and I lifted the bread and looked at the horrifying thing they called a BLT, she said... ""oh that looks gross!""  All I could think is WHY in the world would you bring it out of the kitchen then???  I wouldn't serve that to a goat.  So disappointing. Will not EVER go back there."
Brian V.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",51,10,1,5.0,10/14/2013,Nice! Excellent change for Lompoc! Friendly staff good food a+ Managers were friendly too they have a lot of pictures from Lompoc on the walls and it does not feel like a chain store.
Candice N.,"Lompoc, CA",0,11,,3.0,3/26/2015,"For Lompoc, this Applebee's is a good hangout spot. I have had some awkward customer service experiences here. Food is pretty good. I know they are a chain restaurant so pretty standard. Good alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages."
Nubia G.,"Mariposa, CA",9,12,1,1.0,9/5/2014,"Service was horrible!!! My boyfriend and I, went to Lompoc to visit his family for the weekend. They told us to go to Applebee's, so we both went. When we entered to building and waited for about ten minutes, then they decided to seat us. After waiting for 15 min for someone to take our drink order, the waitress and two others were fighting on who that tables for. After one of them yelled, "" I F$()ing take them. "" we saw our waitress Once. While we were waiting on our food I had a Bahama Mama, that was so tasteful, we noticed a lot off mistakes on food and no structure what so ever in this chain I restaurants. The manager wasn't paying attention on his staff only greeting and irritating the paying costumers. I mean we witnessed a lot that I will not state. But me as a restaurant manager and family owned business, this place isn't going to last with this kind of rude and non structured place. Ps, they only served certain things on the menu that day??????"
Edward V.,"Lompoc, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/29/2014,Me and my wife went to dinner at our local Applebee's and we had an experience we never had. Our server never came to serve us after we were seated the busboy took our drink order and our food order. Then thus girl showed up with our food 15 minutes later but never returned to offer us to freshen up our drinks. We noticed 2 couples came in were seated and left after not getting any service after 10 minute wait. I didn't get a name of our server but I did of the young man that took our order his name was Beau. Very kind and understanding this young man should be taking over our slooooooow waitress. I never leave a review about any eatery because I think things happen but not last night. Sorry to say but this young lady did not want to be there last night so I left her 1.85 tip. Sorry to say but I always tip good...
Rachel H.,"Lompoc, CA",26,41,46,4.0,12/13/2013,"Jocelyn, our server, was so sweet and efficient! The food was really good, I was impressed with the quality of my dinner, grilled chicken was thoroughly cooked and still juicy and the green beans were perfectly al dente! Well done ! Ps: I recommend the lemon drop martini on 5$ Friday!"
K. G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",49,98,39,3.0,12/11/2013,"It lives up to the everyday Applebees chain.  I am okay with going, but it is very busy most of the time, which I guess is good.  If you have been to Applebees, then you know what to expect.  The Sangaria was good."
Amber W.,"Lompoc, CA",1,8,2,2.0,7/11/2014,"I went in with my mom and 3yr old son on 1-29-14 at 1:45. We did not get our food until 2:30 and my sons food came about 10 min after that. I have been a sever / bartender for 15 years I can understand a busy place. This was not the case there was only 4 sat tables, I counted 8 severs( most just standing by the computer talking) I cant imagine that it takes 45 min to make 2 half sandwich and salads. If this place does not get it together it will not last. Oh and the two managers that were on duty were sitting in a booth two tables over eating and chatting it up with the staff that was not at the computer. Out of all the places I have worked I have never seen both managers sitting down eating together, unless we were closed. Good luck!"
ChrisnFrances B.,"Lancaster, CA",39,50,33,3.0,11/24/2013,Great service!!! The flavor of the food could for sure use some seasoning. The cooks need to remember that salt is foods friend. Other than the lack of seasoning our 2 experiences here so far have been great.
Lauren A.,"Lompoc, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/1/2014,The first time I was here the service was slow because it was so busy so I gave this place the benefit of the doubt. I went here again recently and found that the restaurant wasn't really busy and the service was horrible. I didn't even end up getting my drink and the waitress came up after 10 minutes and reiterated that I didn't get my beverage. The food arrived rather slowly and wasn't worth the wait.. The spinach on my meal looked wilted and piled up together so I skipped eating it.. I got sick from the food when I left and I don't think I will be coming back.
Terry S.,"Lompoc, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/5/2014,"Well went there a few weeks ago at 1:30 on a Monday. The place had more employees than customers. the hostess was nice, seated my daughters and I in a booth by bar facing kitchen entrance. Twenty minutes later finally someone shows up to table throws napkins at us takes our drink order and leaves. Ten minutes later(now 30 minutes seated no drinks employees everywhere, bartender four feet away) I decided they did not want to serve us so we left. Hostess says Thanks for coming opens door  and almost to car Hostess runs out sorry did not realize no one served you would you like to speak to manager. I replied no i am hungry. My daughter calls store to talk to manager and they say he is busy call back later. She is persistent kept calling and left message. I am at Sunset Auto(great place) my cell phone rings answer asking for my daughter(Applebee's) knowing  she did not want to give out her number I told this story to the Manager Brian i think he does the basic sorry sorry blah blah has me give my name address etc i will send you gift card. Nothing received and message clear Applebees does not want your business they have the worst service i have ever seen in my life it is deplorable and unacceptable. Chain store relies on commercials to draw you in and steal your money."
Megan R.,"Lompoc, CA",0,14,,1.0,8/9/2014,"The food is still decent, but they get one star based on service. This isn't based on one time alone, but every single time we have gone here (about 4 or 5 times since they opened). Don't think we'll be back again; service makes or breaks a place, and this place is broken. I'm so tired of being ""forgotten"" about, having orders screwed up, and the dopey manager doing nothing but blaming it on his servers. We didn't even get our messed-up orders comped or discounted. Frustrating. Stick with the Applebee's in Santa Maria or SLO (SLO is best, honestly)."
Bill F.,"Lompoc, CA",0,3,,2.0,10/28/2013,I have been to Applebee's a few times and had amazing service. But I went tonight and it took over 10 minutes to get the hostess to bring our drinks. Then 7 minutes later our sever came for the first time and took our order and that was the last time we saw him. Another server brought our food. Had to get the hostess to bring the manager cause our sever didn't come to our table at all. He seemed to go to every other table but ours. We got the manager and he took care of us and comped the meal. I hope to have better experiences in the future.
Damian R.,"Lompoc, CA",36,7,,1.0,2/8/2014,"Service sucks!! Been there numerous times and the service never gets better. Food is slow.  Wait staff walk by and don't refill water. Just awful!! If you really want to eat there, order everything the first time because you won't see your wait person until they bring your check. Very disappointed. They weren't even busy."
Kristen W.,"Lompoc, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/1/2015,Don't waste your time or your money. Have eaten in the restaurant several times and service seems to be on a downhill slide.  Have resorted to ordering food to go just to try and get it so that we could eat in a reasonable amount of time. Ordered food tonight showed up after the 15 minutes when it was supposed to be ready. Was told that I had to go wait at the back end of the bar for my to go food. Bar staff very nicely asked repeatedly if I'd been helped. Got the to go waitress. Was told on arrival that my burgers were ready but we are waiting on a sauce for an appetizer. 15 minutes later sauce finally comes out. Burgers and app have now sat for that long.  Made a comment that the kitchen was jacking the front of house and got told to have a nice night. Restaurant seems to think since they are one of the few games in town that we will all continue to stay loyal. Hate to break it to you we all are happy to drive out of town for better food and service.
Lori N.,"Lompoc, CA",0,13,,2.0,3/30/2014,"We were seated at a table that was literally dripping wet.  I warned my husband not to put his arms on the table and the person who seated us went and got a cocktail napkin to wipe it down.  The cocktail napkin was soaked well before the table was dry so she went to get something more substantial.  When our table was dry she forgot to leave menus.  We had to stop someone to ask for menus.  We were ready to order.  Both ordered side salads with ranch dressing.  Waited a long time.  The waiter came by, tapped on the edge of the table and said, ""I'll go check on those salads.""  Usually the waiters take care of salads, so I felt it was his way of saying, ""I messed up and I'll be right back"".  He sent someone else with our salads and they had blue cheese dressing on them.  Since the salads took so long in coming, my husband was not done with his before his meal came and by the time he got to his meal it was too cold.  We took it home and heated it up in the toaster oven.  My steak meal from the 2 for $25 menu was very good.  They do use a frozen steak that oozes brownish, grey goo, though.  That happens when you buy frozen meat that is infused with salt solution."
