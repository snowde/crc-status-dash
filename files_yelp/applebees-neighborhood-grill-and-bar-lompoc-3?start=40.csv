Raymond V.,"Lompoc, CA",83,4,,1.0,8/29/2015,"Absolutely horrible service, horrible food, horrible everything. I've been there 3 times in the last year thinking it might be different. Now I'm officially never going back. Food was stale, cold, and tasteless... I could have gotten a better meal at McDonald's for less then what I paid for this crap food.  I mean how do you mess up giving someone a condiment? Sour cream for ranch? I think they hired a preschool classroom for the kitchen, and floor staff. I can't believe this place still gets revenue... I really have nothing good to say about this place. I would decline a free meal from here. Definitely get the quality of your local dump at this place.  Ordered my meal online to hopefully be in and out. Spent 15 minutes waiting for someone to recognize me as a customer, got some help. ""Food is ready for you let me go get it"" another 15 minutes later and I get my food. Couldn't run out of this place fast enough. If you are looking for a job and have absolutely no skills or anything to offer. You are guaranteed one here. Eat at your own risk."
Gail G.,"Medford, OR",76,14,1,1.0,6/25/2016,"Three of 4 items came out cold and not matching menu description. I should have to ask for items that are supposed to already be on my plate.  Tables were dirty all over the restaurant, get a bus boy or something!"
Derek C.,"Santa Maria, CA",131,7,,5.0,9/3/2016,"We order to go here all the time and it's always great. It's ready on time, and the staff is always quick to make sure we get what we need and go. Very good prices, especially the 2 for  $20"
Random P.,"Lompoc, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/7/2016,"The rating is accurate, if not too high. Four of my last burgers were overcooked. The food doesn't come as advertised and lacks seasoning. The only thing worse than the food was the waitresses. This time the waitress knew she forgot something on my wife's plate (which came out ten minutes before mine) and when I asked about it she said it was coming out on mine ... She didn't even give us silverware. And we had to wait 10 just to be asked what we wanted to drink. I would be more upset of this was the worst experience we've had so far."
Dave N.,"San Diego, CA",7,19,14,1.0,7/2/2016,Underwhelmed. The margaritas were the worst I've ever had. I asked for a glass of water and my meal arrived first. Had to wait for my girlfriend's plate to arrive before starting my dinner. Why the orders didn't come at same time a mystery to me. (We ordered the same thing.) Even the presto system didn't work at my table. I can see why this place was nearly empty on a Saturday night.
Ernest B.,"Spring Valley, CA",31,25,1,1.0,5/17/2016,"Real low quality here. I've gone four times. Once, they offered curdled sauce on my lady's pasta. Once we got sick, and the last time I had the steak, veggies and potatoes I got a bunch of papery skins in potato mush, dried veggies and the roughest steak I've ever had. I judge fairly. I understand I'm at a chain restaurant and not a fine Italian bistro, but there's a limit. Never again. Also, the hostess was ridiculously awkward the last time. I've been to a lot of Applebee's as I've lived a lot of different places. Stay away."
Storm R.,"Lompoc, CA",0,7,2,3.0,2/9/2017,"I have tried various items there. I have found the only thing on the menu that I get that is cooked properly is the appetizers. The steak I ordered from here lacked flavor and it was cold with the rest of my meal. I ordered ribs and they were like shoe leather. I had coffee here and it was old and bitter tasting. So stick to the appetizers, after nine they are half price!"
B H.,"Santa Maria, CA",0,16,,1.0,10/28/2016,Went in for late lunch today. Hostess was too busy chatting with friends to acknowledge or seat us. We waited for quite awhile before leaving without being acknowledged or seated. Nearby subway was beyond customer friendly.
Al R.,"Alameda, CA",0,10,,1.0,1/2/2017,"I usually appreciate Applebee's for consistency, nutritional choices and a full bar at reasonable prices.   This store missed the mark on poor service and not having any clue about bar service.  They were out of much of the menu items.  Mentioned the bad experience to a local, and they said it's always bad and they don't go there.  Smart move."
Marcy H.,"Santa Ynez, CA",5,77,55,2.0,11/17/2016,"Decided to stop in for lunch despite my mom's advice not to eat here since she said the food here wasn't very good and to travel 30 min to the Santa Maria Applebee's instead.  I hadn't yelped this place before so I didn't read the poor reviews until now when I decided I need to share my experience. Anyway, we ordered the Cavatappi pasta with chicken, the shrimp stir fry, and the lunch special that included the chicken tortilla soup and a half chicken/bacon club sandwich. First let me say that we were the very first customers of the day. No other people in the restaurant and it was exactly 11 a.m. so I expected to: (A) Get good quality/hot food and: (B) To get it pretty quickly. I was mistaken on both points. The waitress was very nice and so was the host who greeted us however I really must say the cook in the kitchen is not very good. We didn't get our orders for a really really really long time. Exceptionally long for being the only customers in the joint. And when we got our food...well the soup was cold. And so was my sandwich. The bread looked grilled but it was super cold and the bacon was super duper uber cold; as if it was pulled out of the refrigerator and placed directly on the bread. The pasta was actually good however it was unevenly warmed. Very hot in some places in the bowl and very cold in others. The shrimp stir fry was next to terrible; lacking flavor and any sort of spice. Those frozen diet meals are better tasting. I told the waitress about the soup and the sandwich being so cold and she apologized and took them back. When she brought the soup back the crispy tortilla chips on top had melted into the soup and became moosh. Sigh...she really should have offered a percentage off or a free dessert or something. They wouldn't even honor the military discount on any of these meals. Anyway it's sad that Applebee's was so highly anticipated in Lompoc and instead of thriving it is seriously diving. So...as much as I would like to patronize my hometown businesses, I not be back. I will instead drive to the Santa Maria Applebee's since we have had only great experiences there."
James C.,"Lompoc, CA",1,120,70,3.0,3/14/2016,"I like this place.  This is the only regional or national-chain restaurant left in Lompoc, and it is almost always full of local folks.  This is a family restaurant that serves standardized menu items at great prices.  For us, the service at the Lompoc location has been really good, too.  The two for $20 meals are pretty good; the burgers and club sandwiches are great, the caesar and oriental chicken salads are very good, and I have enjoyed the salmon and shrimp dinners, too.  I am not crazy about chain restaurants, but I like Applebee's: it's good food and a good value."
Courtney G.,"Lompoc, CA",0,23,12,1.0,3/28/2015,Very nice server but food was really disappointing. I ordered the shrimp n Parmesan sirloin steak with veggies and mashed potatoes and the broccoli wasn't even cooked; just thrown on the plate with a couple other cooked veggies (that were warm). Cold mashed potatoes that looked like it was squeezed out of a tube but the steak was great. Basically wasted money tonight. Won't be back I don't think.
Mir M.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",0,9,3,5.0,4/11/2016,"I have been to this Applebee's several time when I visit and I have no complaints. It's Applebee's in Lompoc, one of the only restaurants that are open late. I chose 5 stars mainly for our service. My party of 14 was well taken care of by Rayleen. Our food and drinks kept coming. She also had good recommendations. Food came to us fast and the order was right. No complaint from a party of 14? You get 5 stars."
Daniel R.,"Lawndale, CA",83,3,,5.0,2/10/2016,Super bomb appetizers good service great ribs. I would definitely return to this location
Xiomara M.,"Lompoc, CA",78,16,4,1.0,12/21/2015,"*Disclaimer: there are a few competent workers there and you can clearly see who they are by the lost and annoyed looks on the face of the other employees*  Applebee's use t be good food, with bad service. Now its bad food, bad service. Server came out 10 minutes later to take the drinks and by then we had ordered our food on the tablet. 5 minutes later, another person comes out with drinks and 5 minutes after that, the hostess comes out with half our order, we remind her that were missing food and 5 minutes later(literally) another person comes back with the second half of our order-cold- starving, we eat it. Then we order dessert on the tablet because no one came to check on us, (4 brownie bites) they come out 10 minutes later completely melted and the hostess looks down emberassed saying we can remake these if you want. When we say yes, we watch her go tell the female manager that she needed to reorder them, she rolled her eys(the manager) walked over and just ordered new ones and walked away. We got our brownie bites 5 minutes later, only half melted this time. When we got the bill I was not surprised to see the brownie bites still on there. Sucks Lompoc doesn't have many things open late night, leaving our choices to fast food, pizza, or applebee's."
Christina Y.,"Lompoc, CA",3,13,5,2.0,9/6/2014,First time here since it opened. Service was eh. We waited a long time to be seated. Waitress took our drink orders right away but it took almost 20 minutes just to bring them out. It took another 20 for her to get our food orders. She never checked up on us unless we used the little tablet thingy on the table to call her over. Food was okay until I realized that the buffalo wing I was eating was raw. Totally put me off and just ordered drinks for the rest of the night. Not huge on visiting chain restaurants but there isn't much of a choice especially in Lompoc. Probably will not be revisiting this place anytime soon.
Shelly Y.,"Lompoc, CA",6,67,31,2.0,3/10/2015,"So what happened to the great service, fast food service and care? Bet they changed managers. Not impressed. Food was adequate, took us almost an hour to get the lunch in a virually empty restaurant"
Bobby K.,"Lompoc, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/3/2016,Horrible horrible and horrible. I do not know how they stay in business.    Service far below average   Food - outside of their appetizers their food sucks.
Dallas C.,"Honolulu, HI",219,46,64,5.0,9/14/2014,Always order the Fiesta Lime Chicken- it's THAT delicious! I also order the spinach artichoke dip & that's very tasteful as well. Been coming here since it opened & no complaints yet. :)
Christopher M.,"Mandaluyong, Philippines",131,57,169,3.0,1/25/2015,"This is a good quick place if you don't know where to meet up. When it first open i would of gave it 4.5 stars. But like alot of restaurants, after being open for a little time. The food quality go's Down hill. But is still a good place if you want to have a few drinks and grab some food on a Friday night with your friends."
