Choco L.,"Santa Maria, CA",0,48,1,1.0,8/9/2015,Appetizers are good. Food is crap. I could make better at home.
Deb W.,"Lompoc, CA",2,6,1,1.0,6/22/2014,"Continue to be disappointed. Slow, food not made to order, and poor food quality. Went for my birthday, since the menu has something for everyone.  husband ordered a burgers and the waitress repeated back -- no pink. Sure enough it was pink. The 2nd burger was even worse, and the manager took it back and the put it back on the grill, third time was a charm, but the rest of us were already done with our meal My salad was drowning in dressing, I couldn't eat it, and soup was too hot. They offered to bring a dessert for us to make up for the mixup with the burger, we told them it was my birthday and he said he was bringing it for the mixup. They brought the brownie with managers compliments and  Then they came out to sing to the table next to us -- gee thanks It's a shame that they can't get it right. Everyone was so excited something new in our little town. This is a great spot of lunch during the day, but service is too slow and they can not get us out in under an hour.  This is my third and last chance for this restaurant."
Sonia G.,"Solvang, CA",0,7,,1.0,3/21/2016,"The slowest service in town. Don't know why it takes them so long to come to the table even when it's not busy at all. The food is bland; all of it is reheated, but it's Applebee's, everyone knew that. One of the worst Applebee's I've ever been to."
Jessica H.,"Lompoc, CA",6,9,13,2.0,4/18/2015,"Tonight was not a good night to go out to eat. The service is usually really good at Applebee's but tonight was a flop. The waitress was just out of it and rarely came to check on us. Our food took nearly 30 minutes to come out and it was wrong. My steak was over cooked and tough, Chris' food was overcooked and he and Joselyn both asked for loaded baked potatoes and only got a little bit of butter and sour cream, not even enough to make it tasty. Plus we didn't even get any silverware until I asked for some. We weren't asked for refills on our drinks, I had to flag down another waitress to just get some water. And they took so long with our desert that all three of the kids fell asleep. And the manager was being kind of rude to his staff right in front of us. At least the desert was yummy."
Daniel T.,"Fresno, CA",0,14,8,1.0,6/29/2015,Horrible services here... Came here with a group of 16 and was sat for over an hour....Also another group was served before us.. Plus food was cold and waitress was too busy taking pictures of a table while we waited to be served...Last our orders for our drinks were taken not once but twice...Big NEGATIVE!!!
Cindy S.,"Phoenix, AZ",65,60,15,4.0,2/10/2015,"My husband and I decided to give Applebee's another chance since they're the only restaurant in Lompoc open past 9PM. We had a late dinner here on Saturday. It was relatively busy; however our server was very quick on her feet and was always at our table when we needed her (never had to use the tablet to call her over). Our meals were delicious and perfectly cooked; however, our appetizer was warm and not hot when it arrived. We hope that the food/service remains consistent and will be back again."
Elena K.,"Lompoc, CA",44,7,8,3.0,11/16/2015,This place is OK. It's not too bad. Sadly not too amazing. I've been here several times to hopefully find a better dish than the last I had. Still not too amazed by each meal so far... But like I said at least it's not terrible. I still haven't found a best dish of theirs though... I think I give up. Time to find another place? Unless Applebee's promises me with the most amazing dish they have...
Renee G.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,28,,1.0,5/4/2015,"Ummmm, no...the steak they thawed out and heated up was over priced and mediocre  at best. The chicken breast was previously frozen as well. That's fine if they were fast food. Nothing fast about the service here. Save your money."
Ann D.,"Lompoc, CA",10,2,,1.0,6/6/2016,"Manager Darrin told me he understood my not drinking in yrs, because he is 5 yrs sober, I said like that IS NOT the case, Im diabetic I can not drink.  smug little dude.   District manager Alan wasnt any better, he didnt belivie when I told him about the size of my steak, it was 1/8 inch thick 2 pieces. he said he was just at store checking on items, my steak did not look like the picture. Oh no he said that was not right, I told him to rewatch the video of waitress bringing my order.  So I know a few people that wont ever go to Applebees again. I tried to speak with Alana Garcia owner of Lompoc Applebees, called 2 times to have her call me back, but she has  NEVER CONTACTED ME. Poor management skills I would say.  I worked for 27 yrs with the phone company, & never would of lasted if I acted like these managers. Times have changed alot .  That was my expererince. wish i would of taken a picture of the meal I got, to prove the district manager Alan.  Wonder if action was taken. I dont think Im done with this."
Kori C.,"Lompoc, CA",56,8,1,5.0,5/13/2015,"Maybe I've just been lucky.. But my family and I love this Applebee's! The waitresses are sweet and attentive.. The bartender even remembers our drinks when we go in.  Service is good, drinks are good and we always leave happy."
Camron B.,"Lompoc, CA",6,1,,5.0,11/16/2013,"I went in with some of my Deaf friends last night. Our server was awesome! She signed to the group and made all of us feel welcomed.  The food and drinks we ordered were great and on time, the way I remember them :) The managers came by to check on us quite a few times, as well as the other servers. I strongly recommend this restaurant!!!"
Kathie M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",10,10,34,2.0,10/16/2013,So excited when they opened. So disappointed when I went. They have a lot to learn about customer service (paying attention to ALL customers and not just your friends and family) and our potato chips were served with over half the plate still raw.
John W.,"Lompoc, CA",0,9,2,1.0,5/20/2015,Slow! Slow! Slow! For such a big franchise the don't seem to care whether or not that their franchise here in Lompoc is very bad!  Pay attention headquarters because the residents won't go to this restaurant if this continues.
Clu C.,"Lompoc, CA",1,25,1,2.0,8/16/2014,"I like Applebee's food and in general, the decor isn't bad. I like being able to watch a hockey game there now and then also. We went there last night and ended up turning right around and leaving. The music was so incredibly loud that there is no way we could have heard one another talk across a table. The hostess was pleasant, she really tried, but there was no way we were going to pay those prices just to sit in a noisy sports bar/nightclub atmosphere with blaring music. If you want to listen to noise while you eat, this is a great place to do that. We went elsewhere instead."
Brian G.,"Lompoc, CA",9,9,1,1.0,1/22/2015,Been back recently. Still the same issues. Now they have table-side ordering machines.  We used it and stuff went to the wrong table.  The fiascos continue....
Thomas M.,"Lorne, Australia",1,1,,1.0,8/15/2014,"Hi, This was a disaster. I've been here before and it's always been very uneven food quality. Sometimes good and other time not so good. However today was a disaster. I send out the food twice and my wife did not eat her salad.  The funny thing was the manager came around and he told me that he would teach the cooks how to cook after the shift was done...  So they have completely idiots in the kitchen with no training?  I did not have to pay for the food and the drinks were good, but this is unacceptable.  Service was okay."
Chris U.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,12,,5.0,2/20/2015,"Great experience, the manager went out of his way to accommodate our large party quickly. The server named Twenty was super cool, knowledgeable and helpful. Tasty food. Love the ribs and love the Firestone beer!"
Patricia K.,"Lompoc, CA",62,4,2,3.0,10/27/2013,"Excited there is a new place in town! My fiancé and I went in for lunch. When we arrived I expected there to be a longer wait than just five minutes. The past few times we have gone to Applebee's there was a 30 min wait and we ended up leaving.  The place was busy and took some time for our server to come over and take our order.  I love that the art on the wall are murals of Lompoc and the area. There are murals of some of the local high school sports stars and the delta 4 heavy rocket that recently launched at Vandenberg. When she did come over she was friendly and helpful. We got our drinks very quickly after she left.   My only complaint was that it took quite a while for our appetizer to show up. And when it finally came they brought our appetizer along with our entrees. Kind of disappointing. If this hadn't happened the Lompoc Applebee's would have received 4 stars instead of three. I am hoping that with time they will work out these kinks.  We got our check soon after we were finished, and 10% off for my fiancé being in the military! We will definitely be back again!"
Rita C.,"Lompoc, CA",0,8,,3.0,3/13/2015,"I guess I've had luck with my visits here since I haven't experienced what most reviewers have. Maybe because I usually eat early dinner and always order the same thing...Oriental Chicken Salad, which is really good. Most of the servers have been great and the wait time for food is always decent. My biggest complaint is the air con. Why does it always have to be on full blast even on a cold day?! I mean who wants to freeze their ass off when trying to enjoy a meal? I think it's hilarious that I always make sure I bring a jacket when going to Applebee's. And whoever put those booths right behind the server's station was a moron! What an awkward and uncomfortable place to have to sit. So go early if you can, stick with what you know will be good, and don't forget to bring a blanket."
Jess M.,"San Mateo, CA",2,121,57,4.0,1/1/2014,"All I heard was a bunch of bad things about this place. I've been there 4 times mainly for drinks and a appetizer. The waitresses are always nice, friendly and extremely attentive. Note it was not super busy! The food and drinks were pretty good.  Even ordered to go and it was pretty good. I would recommend double checking your food before you leave.  I have heard a lot of bad things about this place but so far I don't have any. I will edit and add as I continue to go there and keep you all up to date."
