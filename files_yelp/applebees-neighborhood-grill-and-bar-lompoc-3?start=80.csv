Ben A.,"Lompoc, CA",37,87,115,4.0,10/17/2013,"I have to give the benefit of them being new but cannot use that as an excuse after a few weeks.  The place was packed when we got there, few minutes of wait which did not bother me at all. The servers are I would say excellent, they refilled our drinks when ours are almost at the bottom, good job! When we seated we saw at least 5 servers smiling and attending to serve our order.  I had the baby back ribs, 20% meat and the rest are bones. I love their potato swirl, and the sauce that came with it. I think I saw the manager 2 hours after their opening time, for a new business like this he should be there when they open it so he can see and correct whatever is needed of correction. Overall, I like it. I don't mind coming back here. At least I don't have to drive to SM if I get the cravings."
Russ R.,"Lompoc, CA",11,103,17,1.0,7/28/2014,"Third trip was just now (this evening) so they have had lots of time to iron out the bugs since opening. Arrived at 6:10pm to no one at the hostess stand. It only took a minute waiting and a gal showed up and seated us right away at a booth. She told us our server would be with us soon. Our server (Presley) came right away, very friendly and welcoming, asked for our beverage order.  I ordered a Sam Adams Boston Lager and a cold glass, wife ordered Water with a few slices of Lemon. The server brought out the Water and said she'd be right back with my beer. I opened my the knapkin that held the knife and fork, only to see food remains on both the knife, as well as the fork. When Presley brought the beer she apologized they were out of cold glasses, so offered to put ice in a glass to chill it before bringing it. Very thoughtful. I then gave her the utensils showing her the remains of someone elses meal. She apologized and grabbed them up. When she returned, it was with a clean set of silverware, a clean knapkin, and a chilled glass for my beer.  I poured it half way only to notice the glass was cracked all the way down and it had a sharp edge on the rim. I flagged Presley, she was embarrassed and apologetically picked up the glass. She asked if I wanted the remainder of the beer in the bottle, which was nice, but I waited for a new one and cold glass that came out in 2 minutes. So far Aplebees was not scoring well, but Presley was taking it very professionally.  We then ordered our meals. My wife ordering their Chicken Mac and Cheese (and the menu said it was ""loaded with Applewood Bacon),  I ordered the Bourbon Burger & fries. I was asked ""pink"" or ""no pink"", so I said ""pink"", since I order burgers medium rare. Food arrived within 10 minutes, and I could not help but to note that the $10 Mac and Cheese had just a few little pieces of Chicken and I would bet there was not even one slice of Bacon on top (it was chopped up so hard to tell accurately). I guess Applebees thinks one slice makes it 'loaded' with Bacon. Anyway, my wife didn't complain, she said it tasted good. My burger was a different issue. The fries were lukewarm at best, the ketchup container on the table was empty, and the burger bun was wreaking in grease and meat juices. it literally was inedible. I flagged Presley down again, pointed this out, and asked her to please bring me a new lower bun. Within 2 minutes she returned with it.   The only nice part of this experience was Presley. I felt she was very professional in the way she handled everything, and she needs to be working in somewhere less embarassing.  I feel the only reason Applebees is still open is because Lompoc has so few good eating establishments. Carrows was the same way, and they are now closed.  Our two meals cost $29, and with a $6 tip it came to $35.  I can go to Vons and for $35 I can make 4 fantastic gourmet meals for my wife and myself, so why go out only to get dirty utensils, broken glasses, and poorly prepared food.  Makes absolutely no sense.   This was strike 3, and sorry to have to say it, but they are OUT!"
Jose H.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",9,2,2,2.0,11/26/2013,"Went to applebees for the first time last Friday, around 8pm. Was not that busy, I was given the wrong food. And they didn't bring out an appetizer. Manager was apologetic about the food, but we didn't realize about the missing app until after we left.  I guess I would go again if I had to"
Hilary S.,"Santa Barbara, CA",18,8,,1.0,6/11/2014,"I have been there three times, each time at the bar for  food and drinks. Each time my order was either incorrect, missing something, or my glass was empty long enough that by the time she paid attention I was over it. One bartender in particular has given off the ""I'm annoyed and really don't care"" vibe. This is not true of all the bartenders, but I seem to get stuck with the same one each time. The food is ok. Service could use some attention. All I can say is if you order a side of ranch, that will take a while...for some reason that is really hard to do."
Brittiny R.,"Lompoc, CA",0,2,1,3.0,9/15/2014,People need to give applebees a break !!! Even tonight was hectic they kept their calm and tried to please the guest. Can't please everyone !!! Albert the manager had to do everything by himself so give him props !
Marissa A.,"Santa Maria, CA",0,3,2,1.0,8/26/2016,"Time after time I try to come here and give this location the benefit of a doubt. Never again. The first time our friend had fruit flies in her drink, twice. No concession was offered. The second time we ordered online for pick up, picked up the food and paid, came back to work to eat and we were missing half of our meal. We called the local applebees to have the charge removed and were told someone would call back - never received a call. No apology, I wrote to corporate and again, never even received an email. I emailed TWICE on your contact me tab on the website. The third time today I would have gone somewhere else but I had a craving for wings, I gave you the benefit of the doubt and what did I receive? A dirty box with sticky red goop all over it (I ordered nothing with anything sticky or red), a box of wings with no sauce on half of the wings, no celery, and I also order the pub pretzels with the dip - I received NO honey dijon sauce, the pieces of pretzels looked like they had been ripped in half to fit in the box but there wasn't that many and THEN to top it off they weren't even baked! The inside of the pretzels were still DOUGH! Sticky and gooey DOUGH.  You call this service? I wish I had never paid a tip for this. Completely unprofessional and disgusting. I will not be visiting your location again. Not even a manager to call and apologize? Unbelievable and horrible customer service."
Izzy P.,"Lompoc, CA",45,8,14,2.0,6/14/2014,"Some of the servers seem to still be learning the trade and can be a little slow at times. I've been here a few times with friends and when it gets busy it appears that the staff let themselves feel overwhelmed.  I like this spot since it's one of the food places open late, but wish they could keep up when you have three or more people in a group!"
Jason L.,"Lompoc, CA",36,15,6,2.0,8/14/2014,On the lower end of the Applebee's that I've ate at.  The service is always friendly but the food could use some improvement.
Tara S.,"Bossier City, LA",40,84,65,2.0,9/16/2014,"We had a horrible experience tonight. My husband, my children, and I stopped here for dinner to celebrate and our experience ruined it completely. They have new tablet things on the table. You can pay $0.99 cents to play unlimited games so I allowed my autistic son to play to keep him from being distracted by the happenings around us but the stupid thing stopped working ten minutes in. We waited over 5 minutes to have our drink order taken. I ordered the appetizer at the same time as our drinks (chips and salsa) yet it took 25 minutes to receive them. The server seemed so irritated and did not smile even ONE time the whole time we were there. Our food took forever, tasted burnt, and my husband's order was wrong and had to be sent back. We went forever without refills and they attempted to double charge us for the meal that had to be sent back. Our experience turned our celebration into a nightmare and we were in the restaurant for more than an hour and a half and I assure you with 3 small children that might as well be an eternity. They are only getting 2 stars for one reason and that is the bartender. My son forgot his favorite Hotwheel so I went back in to retrieve it and after such a stressful experience I stopped at the bar for shot. The bartender was so sweet, friendly, accommodating. She was more friendly in 45 seconds than my server had been the whole visit. I absolutely hate this restaurant and will stick to the Santa Maria Applebee's."
Ken C.,"Lompoc, CA",0,20,1,3.0,11/1/2013,"My wife and I were very happy to see an Applebees open in Lompoc. When we walked through the doors I was shocked to see all the cobwebs, but because it was Halloween I accepted it (kidding). The host took our name and said it would be about a 15-20 minute wait, which I couldn't understand because there were several empty tables. To our surprise, the wait was actually only 5 minutes. The atmosphere was nice, the bar was crowded and lots of TV's. The only issue I had was it was a Thursday night and being a huge NFL football fan I would have thought they would be televising the game. When we asked the host if he would have the channel changed to the game that was on the TV above our table, he gave us a fake smile and said yes....we both knew it wouldn't happen, and it didn't..he just blew us off. We finally stopped the manager and he finally changed it to the game.  As for the food and service, our waitress was very friendly and stopped by our table several times to make sure our food was okay and our drinks were always full. We both had the Parmesan Steak and Shrimp, the picture was on the menu and it looked really good. When we got our meals it didn't look much like the picture, but the flavor was good. The steak was good and cooked the way I like it, although the shrimp was a little overcooked. The mashed potatoes were awesome! I would have liked to have had a soup or salad, and maybe some bread with the meal.  I give our waitress and manager 5 stars, the food 3 stars, and the host 1 star for taking our name and -4 for snubbing us. Total rating is a 3."
Paul G.,"Lompoc, CA",0,7,,1.0,11/12/2014,"Since Applebee's was advertising a special for 11/11 (Veterans Day) we decided to give them one more chance to rectify the otherwise lousy food we have had there in the past. The place was loud and noisy but the waitress was polite and attentive and proceeded to serve us two 7 oz.. sirloins that were undoubtedly the worst we have ever had anywhere. They should have come with a chainsaw!  The veggies were OK but I could hardly taste any chocolate in the chocolate shake I ordered for my wife. I suppose I should not complain since there was no charge for my meal, and I should have sent my wife's back, but after 25 years of military service this was an insult.  No more Applebee's for us."
Jason L.,"Grover Beach, CA",2,12,,1.0,7/10/2014,"Very slow service!! Not even busy and it took  an hour to get our food. Ended up leaving as food came out. Server had an attitude and was pretty much a bitch!! Only reason this place will stay open is because Lompoc doesn't have shit for places to eat!!!! Oh, and the background music sucks, who listen Acs of Base anymore!!"
T G.,"Lompoc, CA",2,51,1,2.0,1/5/2015,The service is adequate. I'm not a big fan of their waiters & waitresses. The atmosphere was nice but I saw a lot of dirty tables. I wish they would frequently cleaned the tables as soon as possible! The food is hit and miss. Luckily you get a good amount of food on each plate. I wouldn't go here again.
Gracie C.,"Lompoc, CA",24,3,,1.0,12/12/2015,"December 12, 2015 about 7pm, I was in the bar section meeting with some business associates that were in the area. So it was a casual dinner and drinks.  Except as usual the service was slow. I had asked the waitress for another glass of wine, I just about finished my dinner and still no wine.  I went up to the bar and could not get the bartender's attention. I tried clearing my throat to see if I could get her attention but she never looked over.  I finally had to say ""excuse me"", she finally turned around with a look and attitude that let me know she was put out because I had interrupted her conversation with her friends. I finally got my glass of wine but not with a smile. I don't know why I keep thinking this place will change but it's a let down every time."
Eric C.,"Lompoc, CA",5,23,11,4.0,2/24/2014,"Applebees is finally getting their stuff together with the new store in Lompoc. Love too much stuff on the menu to list. But if you like burgers and bleu cheese they have an awesome burger worth trying. Steaks are good, even the kids steak my son and nephew love them as well as the sliders and pizza. Full bar is nice too... Staff are friendly and take care of you pretty good especially for being such a busy place. Try the large mud slide for dessert, HUGE and delicious!"
Jarrett M.,"Gilbert, AZ",22,79,21,1.0,2/23/2014,Sucky service. It shouldn't take 10+ mins to get drink orders in. Food was sub par kinda cold
Vince W.,"Lompoc, CA",4,8,,1.0,12/19/2013,"My wife and I went here tonight, we were seated at our table, then we sat for over 10 min as the wait staff acted as if we weren't  there, we then left when the people who were seated after us were being waited on. Probably won't be back."
Greg H.,"Lompoc, CA",0,1,11,1.0,10/5/2014,"Stay away!!! Stay away!!!! Stay away!!!!!! I wish I had an option for 0 stars. I am done with Applebee's. My wife and went there today for lunch an ordered 2 hamburgers ""pink"". We place our order just after 1pm. At 2:35 we received our food! And guess what, my order was wrong and my wife's burger was cooked beyond death. It was so dry and almost black all the way through. My burger was just wrong then when I complained and the poor waitress took it back to the kitchen the cooks sent the same burger back and said it was fine (even though it was not the burger ordered). It was not fine. I told her to tell the kitchen to make the correct burger and asked for the manager. The waitress returned and said the guys in the kitchen were being very rude to her and the manager would be out in a minute. I explained the issue and he took both burgers and said he would be back in 7 minutes. 18 minutes later he returned with fresh burgers. Mine was over cooked again but my wife's was fine. The manager thanked us for letting him know his kitchen staff sucks beyond belief. He removed the burgers from the bill but it still cost us for 2 ice teas. Why they didn't comp our entire bill is unbelievable to me. 2 hours to eat 2 burgers. Sadly this was about the 5th time this has happened and the 3rd time I've talked to this manager. He didn't remember me. They usually screw up something and then treat you like it's your fault. I am done with this restaurant. They just suck, their training sucks, their management sucks and worst of all their food sucks. Stay away!!!!!!!!"
Terrance O.,"Lompoc, CA",14,2,,2.0,3/10/2014,"I took the fam to Applebee's in Lompoc, after receiving the bill I paid with my card and left an $8 cash tip. After receiving my bank statement today I noticed the payment was $10 more then the bill. So I went there and spoke to the manger, she told me there WAS a $10 tip added. The manage said they will refund my money and the waitress will be fired. Gee, Thanks. The food was good though."
