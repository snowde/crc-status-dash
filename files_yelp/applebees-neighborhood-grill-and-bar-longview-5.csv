Lisa M.,"Warrenton, OR",1,17,6,3.0,7/17/2017,Food was great! Service was great but a tad slow.  Bathroom was a 5 out of 10 scale. Stall walls and toilet paper dispensers are dirty !!! Trash can over flowing. Waited almost 15min. Just for our ticket to cash out.Other than that it was a pleasant experience.
Naomi R.,"Eugene, OR",0,7,3,1.0,10/6/2017,"Worst. Restaurant. Ever. 4 cheese macaroni and chicken tenders forgot the cheese and the chicken. $10 Patron Margarita forgot the tequila. And when they advertise specials of 1 appetizer and 2 entrees for $20, make sure you specify that is what you are ordering, otherwise you won't get it. I'd give them 0 stars if I could. I haven't been to a chain restaurant in a long time, and this was a stark reminder to eat local!"
Bob F.,"Longview, WA",0,1,,1.0,9/5/2017,Applebee's  in Vancouver  on Mill Plain  great.  Service  and food liked it. Clean and service  was prompt. Applebee's  in Longview. If they closed the doors wouldn't  miss it a bit . I am not the only one that shares  this opinion  of the place.   Very dissatisfied.......... Will never go back to the Longview  chain.
Austin B.,"Hillsboro, OR",12,1,,1.0,12/29/2017,"The waitresses were extremely rude to myself and my girlfriend. Rolling their eyes just because I wanted to ask my girlfriend what she wanted to share for an appetizer. So naturally, we left. Horrible service."
I Am P.,"Ocean Park, WA",0,21,65,3.0,6/9/2017,"Haven't been here is a zillion years! Started with no one to seat us.  Ordered a fresh cup of decaf coffee, had to send it back even though she said it was a new pot. Used their machine to request a server about the coffee, did it again after no one showed up for 10 minutes, AND another server walked by us four times and ignored our blinking red light!  Salsa and chips were good.  Had the riblets and the brisket tacos. Both were good and hot  Had to ring up the server again to get the check.  Liked the server. Didn't like that they turned the light down by half at 4pm, could hardly see! Also didn't like how the server that ignored our help light but had plenty of time to visit with her friends seated behind us!"
Sara L.,"Federal Way, WA",44,15,2,1.0,9/6/2017,"Mac and cheese tasted like rubber. Nothing is freshly made, except for steamed broccolis. Disgusting place."
Prima B.,"Vancouver, WA",3,190,211,4.0,7/23/2016,"For years now, I took Applebee's out of my list of places to eat. It was always a disappointment. We were driving home from the beach. Not knowing much about the area we thought it would be better to eat at a restaurant chain. We were so glad we took the risk. We actually enjoyed our food. The servers were friendly and the service was quite fast. It's still definitely not a place for vegetarians. Hopefully they'll revisit their menu soon and maybe add some vegetarian dishes."
Dan B.,"Kelso, WA",0,6,,1.0,12/27/2016,"Applebee's is OK sometimes. Our most recent visit to this one was anything but. I'd love to review the food, however we didn't make it that far. When we walked in, the hostess told us it would be 5-10minute wait. That's fine. 15 minutes later we got a table, after perusing the menu for another 15 minutes without out any interest from a waiter we left.  Now, I can't say it was busy by any means as it looked like slightly over half the tables had anyone at them.  Typical Applebee's."
Sara R.,"Vancouver, WA",66,437,20,1.0,4/27/2016,"We swore off Applebee's years ago. My hubby wanted to try it because we were in town visiting in laws and needed to eat. They had a full rebranding and we thought maybe it would be a positive change.  Can't say it made a difference. Crowded, chaotic as hell. They ran out of cups, spoons, and plates. Our waitress was as good as she could be given the circumstances, but it was pretty difficult to get her attention. The food was again, mediocre at best. I got Mexican lime chicken (?) that was on a bed of tortilla strips and literally a slice of cheese on the chicken. Uhhhh WAT. It was awkward to eat and frankly not appetizing.  I will continue to swear off Applebee's until the end of existence. Ha."
Tari T.,"Rainier, OR",0,16,,1.0,11/14/2016,"This place has gone down hill..My husband and I would go here for lunch sometimes on the weekend and sit in the bar...we like the atmosphere and the cocktails and food were usually pretty good. I recently went with my son...The place was clean but the service and food were terrible.  What I ordered didn't look quite like the picture...and the steak was over done and tough. I couldn't finish it.  My son ordered a dish with chicken, and the chicken was dry and over cooked. After ordering our food, we never saw our waitress.   We won't be going back."
Donna R.,"Kenner, LA",0,30,5,4.0,9/26/2017,This review is for pick up not for eating in the restaurant. Ordered a 9.99 two appetizer quesadilla and a 2 for twenty appetizer and two entrees. We enjoyed the sirloin steak and also the shrimp and chicken. Service was pretty quick considering they were rather busy. Good value for the amount of food received. Used a 5.00 off online order coupon so all in all no complaints. Also enjoyed the garden salad that we picked as one of our appetizers.
Wendy R.,"Medford, OR",61,67,17,2.0,9/28/2016,"I'm always disappointed when we come here for food.... (any Applebee's.)  Service is pretty prompt and the establishment itself is usually clean. However, I can't think of one meal I've actually enjoyed.  I do love to have drinks here. Those are always on point!"
Frederick M.,"Downtown, Longview, WA",38,1,,5.0,4/12/2017,The customer service was awesome. Caleb was waiting on my mom and I. He was pick and pleasant. The perfect Margarita we got from him was stupendous. The food tasted just as great. Thank yoy for the service.
Braedie T.,"Kalama, WA",36,52,67,2.0,9/19/2015,"Typical chain restaurant. We like to sit in the bar area for Happy Hour which is 3-6pm, they have the machines at the tables to order, cash out or play games. If you opt to play games, they will add .99 to your bill.  The service is nice and fast. The drinks are good but not that strong. We ordered the All American Cheeseburger and the Bacon Burger, both came with endless french fries. The fries were ok, they put a house seasoning salt on them which has green specks in it (I think it's parsley?). My cheeseburger was pink/red in the middle which is a huge turn off for me. I wound up cutting it up and only eating the edges. My BF said his Bacon Burger was just OK. There are better burger places so I wouldn't order that again here. I have had their chicken salad before and it was good."
Becca K.,"Cathlamet, WA",0,3,,1.0,6/13/2017,"I felt so bad for the waiter. He was a very good server, but as we sat at our table, we watched him run around frantically trying to make up for the cooks mistakes. The food was absolutely disgusting. I was disappointed that there is only one vegetarian entree option, which is a veggie burger. My bun was dry. The lettuce was soaking wet. I got four onion rings on the side. My honey liked his burger, but his fries had the texture of cardboard. As if they were baked in the oven for a very long time. At one point, our server asked us how the food was and we just broke out in laughter. I will NEVER eat at Applebees again. The only saving grace was the poor gentleman that works for the establishment."
Mrs. S.,"Longview, WA",0,5,,2.0,8/26/2016,Got sick. Swore off Applebees. Tried eating there again recently and was disappointed. The server was nice but the food is just not that great.
Michael E.,"Grangeville, ID",3,54,2,2.0,8/10/2016,"I swear it must be a corporate chain thing - seems like the service, food quality, and cleanliness is nasty no matter where I have eaten (e.g. Boise or Longview, WA) it is all the same.  Food luke warm, service sucks, total pig sty as evident by the photo."
Walter J.,"Seaside, OR",0,8,8,3.0,9/27/2014,"Was OK.  Service was standard but nothing more.  Charged me for 3 drinks I only got. When I questioned it the server said, ""oh yeah I meant to fix that,  do you want me to take that off?"" I thought no ma'am I think I'll pay for it just for the shits and giggles. ""Yes please"" was my actual response.  .....? I still tipped 18% but to assume I'm going to pay for a mistake is just dumb.   Food was OK,  again standard but plate presentation was cool."
Cat P.,"Ryderwood, WA",0,3,,5.0,3/1/2017,"Ashley was fabulous, very attentive and friendly...the food, as always, was fresh and delicious...great atmosphere. I love coming to this location, they always take such good care of us."
Gary P.,"Chehalis, WA",0,2,,1.0,2/26/2017,"Had a very unusual experience at this Applebee's yesterday. 1. Stood at the door for five minutes waiting to be seated. (There was nobody at the reception and no signage indicating whether to seat ourselves or wait for someone.) 2. Once seated, a waiter came and took our order for drinks, then returned with the drinks and took our order for an appetizer and two dinners. 3. We were completely ignored by the waiter from that point on. 4. After approximately 25 minutes, an apparent manager brought our appetizer to the table. 5. After another 20 minutes, a different manager brought our dinners to the table. 6. I asked for the bill. 7. The manager instructed me how to pay the bill using the electronic device on our table. 8. The bill automatically suggested a 20% tip be added to the $53 chargel. 9. I asked the manager about the destination of any tip, since our server had apparently been deliberately ignoring us all the while he continued attending to other nearby tables. 10. Manager stated that the system in that  restaurant was to share service duties among all the staff, not just one server. (This clearly was not the case with the table next to us, however, as we observed that table being served multiple times by the same employee ... as is done in all other restaurants I have ever patronized.) 11. We paid our bill and left the standard tip of 15%, as the manager pointed out that we had at least been taken care of even though our waiter had completely ignored us once the order was taken. 12. We left the restaurant feeling unsure what problem our presence had created for the waiter that was so offensive that we were repeatedly not acknowledged by him and which caused management to intervene to serve us. 13. Won't be patronizing Applebee's anytime again."
Rick P.,"Longview, WA",0,9,1,2.0,2/3/2017,"Tried the online ordering/ curbside pick-up. That all worked great. I ordered boneless wings.  Wow, what terrible quality.  I've had them before and they were good, but not this time. The quantity was smaller too. Bad move Applebees."
Elizabeth J.,"Naselle, WA",0,7,,1.0,1/11/2017,"Applebee's has always been a place that will have something for everyone in your group.My husband and I ate here 1-10-17. It took some time to have someone come to our table. Wait staff not the greatest, maybe having a bad day. Getting to the food. I had a ""New Steak Salad"" Greens were okay, but the steak, it was like what you would trim off of a steak. And it looked like someone threw it on the plate. The steak my husband had was chew and chew with no taste. will not be back"
Eric S.,"Longview, WA",15,19,1,2.0,7/5/2016,"We were very disappointed eating here.  Even tho the menu had changed the steaks were dry and over cooked.  The new sides were just ok.  Drinks were just ehhh. Staff was all over the place, mistake after mistake after mistake. If you want good food and good service, don't go here."
liz p.,"Austin, TX",49,7,13,1.0,3/1/2016,"I don't know what I was expecting , going to a huge mediocre chain - however I was still sorely disappointed . From entrance to leaving we were there for 2 hours ( for a quick dinner ) on a Tuesday night ! The food was horrible and cold . So disappointed ."
Scott Y.,"Kelso, WA",0,1,,1.0,6/4/2017,"went there for happy hour Friday night and asked to look at happy hour menu they hand you a bunch of menus. the draft beer was 4.25 a glass for domestic beer highest I've ever seen for happy hour, so I decided to order a happy hour drink for 5.50 . I ordered a margarita and she brought it in a martini glass, after asking for the check and waiting for 15 minutes while waitress and male manager stood around visiting I walked up and asked the bartender for it, she quickly brought it but they charged me for a total different drink I'm thinking on purpose. it was 899 instead of 550 and she new I wanted happy hour drink. anyway we left upset and forgot my phone on table because couldn't see it under all those menus. we won't be back plus could here a kid crying the whole time that was sat right next to lounge booths"
James C.,"Longview, WA",96,8,,2.0,2/15/2016,"The star is for my waiter, who was just distant enough to not pry into my personal life and not be annoying while providing good service. Outside of that, it was all trash. The lady next to us kept forgetting to use her inside voice about the surprise party she was throwing (irony?). The food was a nightmare- we ordered the two for 20 deal they offer and got the monz. sticks as our appetizer; they tasted like ass. Then, being the degenerates we are, we ordered chicken tenders and they were burnt and also tasted like ass. For drinks I got a Shirley temple and there was so much syrup I spent the next 10 minutes in the bathroom spitting that shit into the toilet- don't worry I flushed. Just avoid it, support a local business."
B B.,"Long Beach, CA",0,20,,4.0,11/19/2014,Had a very nice late-nite (9:00pm) meal. Service was excellent-Brandon took good care of us. Had the chicken caeser salad and french onion soup. The place was quiet at 8:45 but by the time I left at 10 it was quite lively...
Hollie H.,"Longview, WA",113,6,3,3.0,10/30/2015,Bleh....glorified tv dinners....and the waitstaff is rude....not a place I would suggest
Rachel C.,"Clatskanie, OR",16,11,3,2.0,2/21/2016,"Either understaffed for the amount of costumers, or just really slow. Took us 50 minutes to get our food, part of that was just getting our orders taken. The food was okay, typical Applebee's."
Ata B.,"Bellingham, WA",133,62,16,4.0,9/3/2015,Stopped there with my girlfriend multiple of times. Great customer service and good food (if you know what to order!). Definitely good selection of alcohol beverages.
Julia H.,"Longview, WA",1,5,,2.0,2/6/2016,Very very busy and mis leading menus ! Food taste like its from the deep fryer than comes out cold !
Kelly P.,"Kelso, WA",1,14,5,1.0,6/6/2014,"The only star I'm giving goes towards the drinks and service...that saying, my food and my fiancés food was horrific. We couldn't stomach it...and we sent it back! This place is good for apps and a stiff margarita... So if you have a cast iron stomach and a lazy pallet c'mon down for diarrhea Watch the movie ""WAITING"" it's just like this place"
Tamara H.,"Olympia, WA",1,35,27,3.0,9/13/2015,Very busy place. Always great service. Seems as though the menu changes every week!? A little confusing. Drink are good but heavily over priced! Food is not as good as it used to be! The best microwave food in town!!
Dave-Kirsten P.,"Sandy, OR",12,93,79,4.0,7/31/2014,"This review is only for the Happy Hour menu and service. We came through tonight after dropping off some kiddos, and realized it was still happy hour time at Applebees. Walked in and seated ourselves, and then realized the people in the booth near us were headed out, so we took their booth. The waitress looked momentarily confused, but quickly recovered with our encouragement. The table hardly looked dirty, but she still brought a cloth and asked to please wipe it.  We shared the boneless buffalo wings (fine, could have come from a micro), husband had the sliders (buns were really soft and good), and I had the wonton tacos. It was all fine and good for happy hour prices. Waitress kept drinks full and things cleared. We were happy."
Colleen O.,"Downey, CA",6,21,10,4.0,7/23/2015,"Yes!!! We are NOT chain-restaurant eaters...however, the new Applebee's Late Night Happy Hour menu as well as their new menu, IS worth a late night visit!! We are impressed Corporate Applebee's!!! We will be back!! Service was outstanding! Appetizers 100% and our main dishes riveted at nice 'sit down' establishment!!"
Brian S.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,13,,1.0,9/10/2014,"Ordered online. Easy enough process. Set order for puck up at 5:30pm. I showed up 10 min early, but my food wasn't ready until 5:40. A 10 min wait is typically not a big deal, but..... Our food was not hot, bottom bun was soggy, order was wrong. Will not go back here again."
Jeremy S.,"Cathlamet, WA",426,283,2,3.0,12/10/2014,"We went by around 10pm for dinner because everyone else was closed. There was nothing really negative or positive about our meal. We both ordered shrimp, and it was a bit bland. The onion rings that we got for an appetizer were pretty good.  Our server seemed pleasant enough."
Kristie C.,"Longview, WA",0,63,5,1.0,9/30/2014,"Terrible, terrible service. It took ages for them to seat us, ages to bring water and menus, and ages to take our order. The place wasn't even busy. We didn't order and left. And we haven't been back."
Laura C.,"Kelso, WA",2,7,,1.0,9/27/2014,"We have been to this Applebee's quite a bit, usually for their happy hour deal. My husband and I met some friends there last night. The service was horrible. The waitress took forever to take our order then took another forever to get it to us. The place was not very busy. When she finally brought the drinks my husband wanted to order some food too. He started to tell her what he wanted and she turned and walked away. My husband wasn't very thrilled with her rude behavior. When she finally came back he told her he didn't want to order because he didn't appreciate her attitude. Rather than apologize she got the manager. The manager talked to us for awhile but she barely apologized either. I always thought the customer came first, but apparently not at this Applebee's!"
Shannah W.,"Warrenton, OR",0,4,,1.0,5/15/2016,"My family and I just had dinner here and I will start by saying Alex our server was very good and very nice. However,  our food was another story.  First I ordered sweet potato fries and they were out so instead of asking me what I would like in there place they just decided to serve me sweet potato mash. It tasted like baby food.  Both my green beans and my husband's broccoli were extremely overcooked and mushy.  Then we cut into our steaks that we ordered med rare and got med well to well I will say Alex got us new steaks but we didn't know he was doing that so we ate the overcooked ones we were served.  Then I got some broccoli in place of me beans just as I was chewing my broccoli I felt hair in my mouth and pulled out a piece of dirty blonde hair.  Alex removed my plate and cashed us out. He offered to send the manager. When se arrived several minutes later she asked me what the problem was I told her and she said well I took the steaks off your bill what else do you want. At that point I was in shock I just had dirty human hair in my mouth and I can't even get an apology.  Applebee's has great food. I will go again but sure as hell not there!  Check your food people.  Oh and Applebee's get a manager who cares about the customers."
