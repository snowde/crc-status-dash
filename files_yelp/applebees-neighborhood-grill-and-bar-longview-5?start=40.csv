Jill G.,"Camas, WA",15,14,4,1.0,10/25/2015,"Horrid, gross crapy food. My steak was like rubber, I told the server and they didn't offer to replace it, i figured they take it off the bill since it was hardly touched but they didn't. I never make a sink,  but maybe I should have in this case. Even the steamed veggies were bland and cold. I'm really bummed because we were excited to finally go to Applebee's. And my biggest pet peeve is ordering a soda and no one ever comes around to refill. Just a let down."
David G.,"Astoria, OR",12,5,8,2.0,2/17/2014,Not impressed at all. I ordered a cowboy burger cause on the menu it looked to be a nice size . When I got it what a joke. The burger looked like a slider and like 15 French fries.. About 3 bucks at McDonalds I would get more food. I won't go back . They false advertise.
Andruw F.,"Kelso, WA",3,133,,4.0,11/8/2015,"everytime i have come here i have enjoyed myself! now, i read that everyone says the meals arent good, and some say the appetizers are good. ive only ever had wings, which is an appetizer, and they have been delicious every time! some of my favorite wings ever! and the service is great! ive only experienced a little slower service because i always seem to go when its super busy."
Tasha P.,"Edgewood, WA",1,59,,2.0,2/9/2013,"Granted, it's been several years since I've been to an Applebee's, but I remember it being a lot better than this. The food is all greasy, and most things are more calories than a person should consume in a day, much less a single meal. There is not a single meatless entree on the menu (and the only things on the menu that are meatless are deep-fried appetizers).  The waitress was friendly enough, and happy to fill me in on the things that I was able to eat which were not on the menu. I left feeling like I'd eaten too much, and like puking might be imminent. (It wasn't, thank goodness!) Guess I won't be returning to an Applebee's for another few years. Maybe they'll figure it out by then."
Kathy H.,"Condon, OR",8,307,,3.0,11/5/2013,"After the Winco experience we stopped here for a small bite and drinks. The gin & tonic was a good pour, enough to blur the image of Winco from my mind.  The wonton chix tacos were good, honey wings just spicy enough and steak egg roll made hubby smile. Good choices, good execution. We would go back."
Dan S.,"Salem, OR",2,242,10,3.0,6/25/2010,"Actually not bad for an Applebee's. I think it's fairly new so it hasn't had time to get run down and old looking like most of the rest of the chain. And if you find yourself in Longview this is probably going to be one of your better options. The night we went it was pretty packed and it must have been Prom time because there was a group of high school kids all dressed up in formals. Yup, Prom night at Applebee's. Truly a Night to Remember. But that's how they roll in Longview. It's got all the usual Applebee's staples, and the service was fine, so this is a good stopgap until you get back to civilization (Seattle or Portland)."
Sheryl M.,"Salem, OR",3,10,,2.0,9/2/2012,"I usually love Applebee's, especially when we are traveling we know we will have a good meal at the local Applebee's. I was very disappointed to receive my classic clubhouse grill sandwich not grilled, even more disappointed to find the bread had been burned to a black crisp and then turned inside out so it didn't show except for the edges. Not a very good attempt to hide poor cooking, why not grill 2 more pieces of bread?"
Aaron W.,"Robbins, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/9/2013,"The lady in the bar was unbelievable. She was such in a hurry that she did not make time to make me welcome for dining at this establishment. After 15 mins we finally got our orders put in. We waited and waited for our food. No waitress. She did not take any time to check with us. We were so hungry by the time we got our food. We had to wait 30-40 mins, and by the time someone else brought us our lunch there weren't any silverware to eat our meal. We waited 10 more minutes, and the waitress was busy chatting with her friends than checking with her customers. We did not even get a chance to eat our lunch, so we walked out with the food sitting on the table. We decided to head over to Quiznos. That waitress gave a bad impression, so we will not be dining at that restaurant again."
Jon Y.,"Park City, UT",5,7,1,2.0,2/15/2013,"Foods alright, nothing special but inexpensive.  Service could be better, they were nice but kinda of clueless. There was a lot of people working but just seemed to be walking in circles. Only went there with my senior citizen parents who love the place."
Charise W.,"Vancouver, WA",6,23,10,1.0,9/25/2013,"Don't come to this restaurant.  My boyfriend and I came in for a late dinner around 9p.m. and the place had about 10 people in the whole restaurant and we stood around for 10 minutes  waiting to be seated. Eventually the waitress placed us next to a very loud and obnoxious table. We sat at our table next to these obnoxious people for about half an hour waiting to get any service, which was us asking to move to a different table so she pointed us to the bar. We went and sat in the bar and finally got to order a drink. We had one Dr. Pepper and one margarita. We sat and read the menus again and again and again. We finally got tired of waiting, so we signaled to the waitress in the bar to bring us our check and she still took a long long time to bring it over to us because she was chatting with her friends.  We paid for the drink we got and we left. No food was served to us.We ended up sitting in the restaurant with only our drinks for over two hours. Don't come to this place."
Joseph M.,"Portland, OR",0,9,,3.0,5/24/2014,"I don't live in Longview but ate there often when I visited my mother.  For the most part, the food and service was quite good.  The bad part was the bar.  If they can't afford hiring a mixologist, they should get the bartender a recipe book.  I've never had a good Manhattan there but the last time was unbelievable.  The drink came to me and was so pale I thought it was water.  It wasn't water but it was scotch not rye or bourbon.  There was no sweet vermouth or bitters in it.  I was told the bartender was new.  For once, I sent the drink back.  The replacement was not as pale but was just as awful tasting.  I'm not chintzy but I think being charged seven or eight dollars for a non-drink is dishonest.  I won't be going back because of that but I will miss eating there."
Trisha L.,"Kelso, WA",14,118,139,4.0,7/15/2010,Applebee's in Longview is a great place to meet friends and family for dinner.  The service  is always good and friendly.  The food is consistently good and at a great value.  Gotta love the half priced apptetizers during the hours of 4-6pm and again after 9pm.  There are options for whatever kind of diet you might be on - with weight watchers meals on the menu with listed points values as well as an under 550 calorie menu.  I would highly recommend the Asiago & Peppercorn steak from this menu - delicious!  The dessert shooters are a great ending to any meal - just the right size to satisfy your sweet tooth without overdoing it.
