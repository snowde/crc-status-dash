Ken S.,"Loveland, CO",2,158,38,5.0,9/13/2017,"There's a lot to like about this Applebee's; that's why we keep coming back.  We especially like the spinach and artichoke dip, which is included in the 2-for-$20 deal.  Everyone in the family can get something they like."
Andrew C.,"Castle Rock, CO",8,141,16,1.0,9/13/2017,Walked into Applebee's and there was no one at the front door. If I host was around she may have seen me because I waited over 30 seconds and eventually went to the bar and sat myself. I sat in one of the booths for over six minutes and every single server walked by me and none of them inquired if I was hungry or have been served. The bartender looked at me multiple times and still zero service. I saw a manager come out and do a slight walk around the restaurant and went back in hiding in the back of the house. I'm giving this one star because I had too. It was not that busy and someone could have easily asked me if I was taken care of. Not all but most of the servers had eye contact with me. After a total of seven minutes sitting there waiting to be served I left never to return.
Marie E.,"Loveland, CO",7,42,,2.0,6/3/2017,"Positives: Really friendly server, nicely decorated, good location near shopping center Negative: Ordered a shrimp stir fry that did not even come close to matching the picture on the menu. Menu showed large shrimp and good sized chunks of broccoli. What I got was a few miniscule rubbery shrimp and a few 1/4 broccoli pieces overloaded with shredded carrot and white rice. The sauce tasted strange. My daughter ordered fish and chips. The fish was hard on the outside (not the breading) and she couldn't finish it. Their fish and chips are frozen, not freshly battered and cooked. Husband liked the long time favorite oriental chicken salad. Paid $50+ for only three meals. Not worth it at all."
Diego R.,"Greeley, CO",215,17,5,3.0,8/13/2017,"I've had poor experiences with other Applebee's before but I was surprised by this location. Very nice decor and the food was even better than I remembered. Everything was excellent except for the wait staff. Boy, I take it tips aren't important to these guys for some reason. This crew could really use a class on customer service. It seemed like you needed a court order to get a smile out of anyone. At first I thought it was just our waiter, ""maybe he's just having a bad day."" But everyone working there seemed to be inconvenienced that they had to serve someone."
Reed B.,"Loveland, CO",0,4,,2.0,8/12/2017,It has been years since I have been to an Applebee's.  Went here for lunch today.  I have become a vegetarian recently and I was so disappointed with their lack of veg dishes.  Even the appetizers were majority with meat.   The service was prompt and polite.  My wife was ok with her burger.  Sweet potato fries were great.
David H.,"Fort Collins, CO",3,7,,5.0,6/4/2017,I like the joint. It's cozy and calm. All the staff is friendly and had a sense of urgency. Tonight they must have had the A team working as far as ladies. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. The lil Latina is soooo sexy. She knows it. The manager too. My gawd. Seriosuly smokin.The red head hostess. All them curves and me without brakes.  She is bangin. blonde hostess too. Sexy gal. The brunette slim waitress. Damn son. I mean dizzamn! The bartender. Goid lawd good lawd! Booty for days son! Hahaha. Face of an angel!  Seriously ridiculous! I'll be back for sure. Not because of them bit because service is always good and food is good. But damn. They are giving on that cake.
Aaron D.,"Loveland, CO",0,7,2,3.0,7/24/2016,"Slow service, was seated right away but then it took a good 10-15 Minutes for the waitress to come and acknowledge us. Then we were served a platter full of crushed chips with the spinach artichoke dip. After sending that back, the visit got better but not a very good experience."
Cameron M.,"Wellington, CO",5,3,,1.0,10/1/2017,"Okay so me and my girlfriend went there, we were greeted by a nice guy who took us to our seat and told us our server would be with us. We then sat there for over 15 minutes with no server, eventually the bartender comes around making sure everything is good, asks us if we have had our orders taken, we say no, she takes our order. She then starts running around making sure everyone is doing good while the waiters are talking in the back. When my food comes out I had no more than 10 fries on my plate, while my girlfriend had plenty (25+) so I'm like wtf is this!? Anyways, by far the worst service, the bartender was the only good person there. Super friendly. Whoever the girl bartending on September 30th should get some praise cause she was the only one I saw not only doing her job, but went above and beyond to make sure all of the tables were doing okay. Still by far the worst experience I have ever had, anywhere."
Christian B.,"Broomfield, CO",292,695,1702,5.0,12/24/2014,"Everything was in tip top shape at this location. Even though the place was pretty full that didn't slow down the service. The food was delivered hot, fresh and delicious. The mac and 4 cheese dish was creamy and the delightful. The chicken strips with the honey pepper glaze was crunchy and satisfying."
Laura B.,"Fort Collins, CO",2,61,2,5.0,12/13/2016,"The food was great and the wait staff worked together as a team to get our large group taken care of. Well done! A special shout out to ""Sally Jesse Raphael""!"
Alex R.,"Loveland, CO",2,18,6,2.0,10/25/2015,"Service was attentive. Drink refills were consistent. Food was subpar. Overly salted fries and ""handheld sandwich"" was a bit dry and salty as well. Inside is fairly dirty. Looks like it could use a thorough cleaning or complete remodel. Probably last time eating here."
Bob T.,"Loveland, CO",0,5,,3.0,9/11/2016,"Food good service OK. Happy hour states during and pro football game. We were there watching the pats cards game even though I pointed it out, the bill came... Full price."
Lisa R.,"Loveland, CO",18,23,5,3.0,1/16/2015,"This comment is based on the ""Car side to Go"" option. I ordered the 2 for $20 (2 side salads and 2 entrees - Fiesta Lime Chicken and 3 Cheese Penne). Granted, we ordered to go service on a Friday night, around 6:30 p.m, I am a little disappointed with the effort put into my meal. My salad was half of what they normally serve and my entree was missing or lacking portions, such as the lime.  I know that doesnt sound like a big deal, but when you have a prepared meal, all condiments that come with the meal matter and boost flavor which then amplify the taste of the meal leading you to want to order it again.  I also asked for forks and spoons, but that was not included. When I pay nearly $50 for food (I ordered a total of 4 meals) , I am paying for completion as well. I felt that Applebees lacked a little in this category. Food was still good, my first experience of ordering carside was great, which is why I went back a 2nd time. I'll give it one more go, one day, but if I am served half ass again then I will find another facility to order food when I dont feel like cooking.  That's all, folks! Till the next time..."
Michelle J.,"Berthoud, CO",0,3,,1.0,8/16/2016,"We were at this Applebee's on Sat. Aug 6. The restaurant was not busy when we got there. It took about 10 min for anyone to take drink orders / food orders. Then we waited about 45 min for  chicken salads. When asking where our food was, we got excuses - minimal staff, busy  - we reminded them when we got there they were not busy. About 15 min later the food came out - cold. Asked for a manager. said they would redo the food and it would be free. Waited about 15 min and got new food. in the meantime 6 other tables around us were mad about the same things - extremely slow service and cold food. We saw several people send food back and complain. The manager gave alot of excuses. i have never seen such terrible service in a restaurant. So many  upset about the service. There were a couple of waitresses trying to do their job and they were frustrated because of all the complaints and that management was not addressing the issues. I will not return."
Lisa D.,"Johnstown, CO",4,1,,1.0,5/10/2015,"Disappointed in their so called ""happy hour"" 1/2 price draft beers.  Only one size drafts, tall which look like normal size for 4 dollars. The brisket nachos were the biggest disappointment, where's the beef!?"
Stan T.,"Loveland, CO",5,9,1,5.0,12/4/2014,"This should be my Cheers Bar.  Love the staff and they are always going out of their way to please.  We've been there many times in the last two years and never had a bad experience.  Last time our family kept arriving and we outgrew the space we started in.  They promptly and politely moved us to another larger area and we enjoyed our time with our server.  Courteous service but not overly intrusive, just like I like it."
Erika G.,"San Antonio, TX",35,11,38,4.0,12/27/2013,We are not a fan of chain restaurants but we had a gift card so we have it a shot. I had a Weight Watchers Cedar Salmon and it was loaded with seasoning salt. So much for being healthy. I did get the artichoke butter on the side so I could eat what I wanted. They do give a military discount.
Pat S.,"Loveland, CO",0,8,,3.0,4/3/2009,Applebee's has a good  menu selection and a great happy hour but unless you like soggy chips swimming in chili then stay away from the nachos.
Marsha M.,"Loveland, CO",0,20,,4.0,5/29/2008,"They have a varied menu and affordable prices. Wednesday night is 99 cent kids meals. The Santa Fe Chicken Salad is my favorite, and I like it when they run combo dinner specials."
