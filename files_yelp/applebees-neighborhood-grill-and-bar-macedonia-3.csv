Lesley B.,"Benton Harbor, MI",48,3,3,4.0,11/30/2017,This is my favorite place in town to eat at! Love me some festa lime chicken! And 80% of the rest of the menu! The staff is super nice!
Ashley S.,"Bedford Heights, OH",116,41,101,2.0,12/23/2017,"Applebee's used to be a favorite for me and my family but they have made some menu changes that have really been disappointing! For example- The portion sizes on all of the appetizers that are part of the trio have gotten smaller. The soft pretzel sticks are skinnier than my fingers. The boneless wings were hard and not fully tossed in sauce. The only decent app was the spinach dip (and that had a rubbery layer of cheese over top they needed to be removed before eating. Rubbery, not warm bubbly melty)    They other app we ordered was the salsa verde beef nachos. Gross. Completely unseasoned hamburger meat on nachos with thick raw jalapeños rings. In the picture I had already chopped up the jalapeños into smaller pieces.  Also, the kids meal was $4.99 and was a single tiny cheeseburger with very few fries. Shown in the picture. Very disappointing. Save the money and skip the ciabatta bread bun and use regular cheap buns like kids prefer and GIVE 2 SLIDERS you cheapskates. Ugh.  I recommend only going for the cheap drinks and skipping the food. I hear they have $1 Long Islands this month."
Matthew M.,"University Heights, OH",83,2,,2.0,12/28/2017,"Was a busy night, only saw our waitress twice, once for drinks other for check, bartender came out and helped and was very helpful. Waitress forgot to bring one of our apps out."
Kim W.,"Corinth, MS",0,15,,1.0,1/1/2017,"This was an awful experience. The hostess was the only one who looked as if she had even showered, but she was pissed to be working. Our waitress had on leggings and slip on crocs. She had no clue as to what was on the menu. The waitress serving the table behind us was just as clueless with her table. There was a table with an unruly child, and the first couple got up and left because of it, within minutes they sat ANOTHER poor couple there. They moved. The restaurant was no where near full so there were several empty tables to seat people, but AGAIN they say more people at the adjoining table. We were so desperate to get out that we left a huge tip just so we wouldn't have to wait for change.  The food was wrong, and the shrimp had been nuked.... Definitely a letdown.  It would be amazing what a good manager could do for this place. A hygiene lesson to the waitresses and a quick lesson in professionalism. When you can sit and observe the majority of a restaurant suffering from bad food and bad service, it's the managements fault."
Debra V.,"Chagrin Falls, OH",45,472,1048,3.0,3/1/2017,"We like Applebees so no review there. But we wondered why Happy Hour only included beer and not wine. Also, the credit card machine now comes to the table. We thought it was to save time. We got our receipts with the totals hand written that somebody had to write accurately. Why?  The totals could have been circled or highlighted. We swiped our credit cards through the machine and signed. Then our busy waitress hurriedly brought us the receipts to sign again. Why are we signing the receipt again if we ran our own cards?  Seemed awkward, and our busy waitress seemed frustrated, but kind. Totally unnecessary. Perhaps this pay system needs to be rethought."
Darlene D.,"Stow, OH",0,40,,4.0,5/10/2017,"A wonderful lunch here with family. My husband ordered a beer ($5.29), along with the lunch combo of French Onion Soup and the Clubhouse Grille ($8.99) and I ordered the Sautter Home Cabernet ($6.25), along with the lunch combo with the French Onion Soup and the Cheese Chicken Cavatappi ($7.99). They delivered the smaller wine (6 oz) instead of the larger (8 oz), but the manager allowed me to have the first one and then brought me the larger one also, without an extra chart! Our waiter, Adam, was awesome and attentive!"
Craig K.,"Northfield, OH",0,4,,2.0,10/8/2016,"Haven't been to Applebee's in quite awhile before this evening.  Now I remember why.  Ordered a steak medium well and got medium to medium rare.  Steak was not hot, but the plate was.  Upon leaving there were piles of dirty plates on the high top behind the check in stand and dishes to be picked up on multiple tables.  Saw no management to speak to.  They have been walking around all the time in the past.  Won't be back until things change for the better."
Eric B.,"Cleveland, OH",5,54,3,1.0,6/5/2015,"I quit going to Applebee's years ago.  But my niece graduated and my brother and his family chose here for us to meet up after the ceremony.  We were a group of 14 so I already figured if they couldn't get me and my wife's stuff right that this had the potential to be a disaster.     It was. First it took forever for the food to come out.  But like I said it was 14 people so whatever.  I ordered the Triple Dog Dare Ya which was supposed to consist of a sandwich with onion straws, pulled pork, bacon and ham.  When they brought out the food I noticed that the onion straws looked burnt.  I tasted them and of course they were.  Visibly burned and there was no bacon.  Like why would you send that out?  Told the waitress and she took it back.  It came back very quick with a heaping of onion straws, like a comical amount like they were upset I sent the sandwich back.  I then noticed that there was no pulled pork on the sandwich.   How does one make a sandwich minus TWO major ingredients AND burned onion straws.  I talked to the manager this time.  I told her I don't even want the sandwich because clearly they don't know how to make it.  I chose just a regular bacon cheese burger.  Like they can't possible F this up. Well that took forever to come out.  I had to go looking for the waitress to tell her never mind because everyone was finished eating and I asked her if she was planning on charging me for it and she said she thought the manager was going to.   The manager had brought the plate to the table while I had got up to find the waitress and told my wife in this BS tone not to worry about paying for it. Applebee""s is a joke of a restaurant.  And the management had no professionalism."
Beth S.,"Macedonia, OH",30,230,281,5.0,3/21/2016,"I ate here with my husband Saturday night and had a great time. We went around 5:30 pm and was seated right away. Our waiter was so quick and attentive. He immediately took our drink order! Then I swear just as we decided on what we wanted he got our order. Food was a decent value. We both order the 3 for $12 appetizer deal. I had hot wings which were the best around. Which is saying a lot. I love wingstreet wings! I also had the beer battered pretzels. They were good. I would have like more than 2 though.... The mott sticks were great! My husband loved his won ton tacos, shrimp, and whatever else he had. I can't recall now. I really like that they now have a screen that can allow you to play games, get drink refills and call your waiter. We never used it for those options but it's nice that they exist. We did use it to pay. Which was fast and convenient! I even used it with my gift card and credit card. It even gave a option to split the check! So cool!"
Oghosa O.,"Maumee, OH",10,21,39,3.0,10/20/2015,"So I've been to Applebee's a billion times, but yesterday I went with my mom for the 6.99 burger night with a free refill on fries;that they have on Mondays. I ordered the brunch burger with sweet potato fries, and the burger was really good, but my fries I didn't care for to much. The service was pretty slow as well, and I kept having to search for my waitress when I needed something!  Overall, I really enjoyed my burger and some quality time with my mom."
Matthew M.,"Cleveland, OH",177,208,174,1.0,5/21/2010,"Oh, Applebee's, you predictable chain, you. Located in Macedonia, Ohio, otherwise know as the epicenter for hideous, soul-destroying sameness; how I despise you!  Oh, where to start? For one, how does this place or its ilk remain consistently busy? Is this or the unexplainable attraction to other similar chain restaurants somehow a reflection of society? Do the people patronizing boring sameness like this strive for anything above mediocre? Simply put, what is wrong with people?  Applebee's is the poster child for everything that is wrong with the overpopulated, over-the-top, un-original, flair crazed dining landscape of the mainstream American chain.  Cheesy, disingenuous, robotic, intelligent-insulting wait service. Crap schmeared and strung about on the walls in a cluster-fuck fashion. The place is too happy, too bright, tables too sticky, too many kids screaming and I haven't even gotten to the food yet! I struggle to understand how THIS has become an acceptable means of dining!  For whatever reason, most people fear the unknown, but find comfort in sameness. You KNOW what Applebee's offers even before you step foot in the door and what to expect. Your brain is overwhelmed with TV, radio and print ads announcing the latest un-inspiring ""Pick-'N-Pair"" lunch combos & ""Ultimate Trios"".  It's the same whether you're in Singapore or San Jose, California. To most, this is comforting. To any future readers out there, please, for the love of God, try someplace new next time you dine out. You may surprise yourself. Take Little Timmy and the family out to a local Mom & Pop eatery instead. You may feel better about yourself upon leaving. At the very least, part of your soul and dignity will still be in tact."
Bekki S.,"Northfield, OH",3,21,6,4.0,11/16/2014,"I am not an Applebee's fan, but my daughter wanted to go. It was a week night so it was pretty tame service wise. Everyone was very nice and attentive. The food was so so but it always is with Applebee's. The manager held the door open for us when we left and that was a good ending touch."
Jon E.,"Northfield, OH",235,10,,2.0,9/18/2015,Horrible service.......we told the server we were going to a movie at the theater next door. The other couple ordered a drink with our dinner as did I had to ask three different times for my drink and two separate servers. The other couple had there drink right away. The server brought My whiskey cocktail with the bill. I ordered one drink and had to down it to make it to the movie on time.  If I wasn't in a hurry I would have made them take it back and remove it from the charge but based on how slow it took to get I didnt want to be anymore late for my movie. Horrible since there were only 3 tables in My section filled.  My bill was 46.50 and I only tipped enough to make it an even 50 dollar. And I felt that was a little much. Really disappointed since we have gone there in the past and it seems to be going down hill.
Cameron S.,"Orlando, FL",1,22,4,4.0,2/26/2013,I was very happy with my steak it was cooked just as I asked and my waitress was very helpful . Nothing wrong with this Applebee's !
Donnell S.,"Cuyahoga Falls, OH",33,238,26,1.0,7/15/2013,Sat for over 30 minutes hoping to place our order.  Couldn't get service.  Bartender sees whats going on and says nothing.  Watches us walk out without an apology.  Door girl is oblivious and thanks us for coming in.  Forget this place.
Justin H.,"Fayetteville, AR",97,153,40,3.0,2/4/2011,"Chain chain chain, I'm a fool for thinking I would go here for a good meal.  But the menu has much improved.  Surprised by the grilled shrimp and spinach salad, with French dippers at a price not to kill your lunch budget.  Just don't get a pop.  Because pop is now gold.  It always gets me what places charge for pop vs the cost to them. So its applebees.  I will spare you the décor and style comments.  What makes this one different.  The wait staff is average.  It is usually pretty busy, but you can do the hour lunch."
Shelly C.,"Macedonia, OH",2,4,,1.0,5/9/2014,"Waitress rude. She took our order for drinks and not come back for almost an hour. My drink was sloshy. The appetizers were cold. Finally, at end, they add up the check all wrong. we won't go back."
Pritesh P.,"Coralville, IA",12,50,6,4.0,6/24/2010,"My first journey out of the house, after moving to this state yesterday, landed me at Applebees. The only problem was that it was 11:20pm... And they close at midnight! I felt like such a d-bag, strolling in that late and so near to closing time. BUT the staff didn't seem to mind... Or at least they were pretty good at faking it! Our food and drinks were delivered in record time.  As a recently displaced Chicagoan I look forward to trying all the different foods in the area. I realize Applebees is a nation chain and will have the same food everywhere, but I will still come back here because they served my food without spitting in it even though it was so near closing time, and, I don't want to turn Yelp into a Craigslist 'missed connections' section, but my waitress Melissa (W?) was awfully cute :)"
Charli T.,"Palmdale, CA",64,54,4,3.0,3/2/2011,"Not terribly bad for a chain restaurant. We had the same waitress both visits and she remembered us, our kids, and what our special needs were. We'll most likely be back."
