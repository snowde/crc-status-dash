Laura A.,"Fort Drum, NY",52,49,2,4.0,10/3/2017,"I was about to give you guys a terrible review but your car side to go server saved you. 2 car side to go spots and they are full with empty vehicles. Your poor signage makes for some lazy, selfish customers. This poor server said when they ask customers to move they say ""it doesn't say I'll be towed so why do I have to move?"" Selfish, lazy and ignorant Americans at All American Applebee's. I won't be back. Pathetic."
Eric V.,"Phenix City, AL",0,2,,1.0,12/21/2017,this is worst Applebees i have ever been to. the bartender is possibly the most hateful of tourist and out of town-ers. those the cant handle the the cold shouldnt go there. becuase the bartender will not serve you. these new jersey douche bags will only serve there own and disregard others. i came from the hotel next door and needed a warm drink i said i was from south Florida. Was automatically  disregarded and called a drunk since i was cold. this was most  disrespected i have ever felt in 30 states. no wonder new Jersey  is the bunghole of America and thr shit hole of the rest of the country. fuck that bitch i am still sober that cunt still wont give me a beer. fuck this town and its no left hand turns.
Octavio R.,"Hawthorne, NJ",28,55,,1.0,7/26/2017,Bartender male big nose pushes drink after drying every 5 min . And then the singing female bartender stick to your day job . Place has gone down hill terrible wings and nachos and terrible rude bartenders
Joanne C.,"Old Bridge Township, NJ",3,18,,3.0,3/30/2017,"The service was fine but if the portions get any smaller they will be non-existent.  I am not a big eater.  3 people shared 1 app, I ate a Caprese chicken entee, had room to share a desert and left hungry.  My plate was all onions and mashed potatoes"
Jen B.,"Manahawkin, NJ",0,52,,4.0,8/14/2017,"We come here quite frequently and have never had a problem with the food or the service.  We were in on Saturday for lunch and Alexis was our server.  She was very attentive and so sweet.  She told us about the drink specials on the patio and checked on us frequently.  The food was very good.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because the tortilla chips for the spinach artichoke dip tasted funny, like old oil. But other than that everything was great!"
Vincent P.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,21,,5.0,6/12/2017,On our way back from AC we needed a place to eat so we stopped here. 6 starving men aren't the easiest please but we were all pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. On top of that the waitress (Melissa) was not only great but beautiful to match. So all in all a great place...
Pat R.,"Oakland, NJ",0,27,,1.0,7/25/2017,Maybe tied with TGIF for worst food chain in the US.
Jamie E.,"Wayne, NJ",138,133,423,4.0,11/27/2015,"This restaurant is so lucky to have Erin on staff. Amazing personality, service and was super cool dealing with our family's needs and requests. I'm actually not an Applebee's fan at ALL..but as far as Applebee's goes, this one is great. The boneless wings with Asian sauce were delicious and flavorful. My husband's chicken dish off the special menu insert was very enjoyable and only $10 bucks. In a town with very few options, this served us well tonight. Thanks, Erin, you're awesome. Manager, take note!"
Jennifer P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",36,23,1,3.0,3/1/2016,"For a chain it's one I can stomach.  Typical bar food, but some decent burgers and the steak is OK. I like the happy hour specials and late night specials.  Comfortable atmosphere."
Chris s.,"Township of Stafford, NJ",66,13,,3.0,4/29/2016,It seems like every time I go to Applebees the menu changes also wth is with the new tablet on the table. You have the chose to play games with it while you wait for your food for an extra 3 bucks. I have my phone if I want to play games. I give it 3 stars because the food and service are good but the decisions Applebees makes on changing the menu sucks. And I dropped it a star because it seems like every time I go here there is always a little brat kid making a lot of noise with a parent/parents that don't know how to discipline their kids.
Molly M.,"New York, NY",0,31,,1.0,8/21/2016,Skip this place at all costs. The waitress was beyond rude to my sister and her wife. It's 2016 - get over your issues with same sex couples!
Patricia A.,"Tuckerton, NJ",5,35,14,5.0,11/14/2015,"Did the 2for $20 for lunch on Friday.  Waitress was very attentive , food was consistent and tasty. Price was great (2 Caesar salads and 2 entrees for $20).  I enjoyed my fiesta lime chicken. Love their Caesar dressing.  The steak must have been good, because my Mother-in-law did not complain.....for once!!!"
Billy Lauer M.,"Barnegat, NJ",64,3,,5.0,10/27/2015,Always have the fights and games on no cover charge. Waiters are also friendly. I would recommend this applebees over the lacy one. I will be back.
Justin P.,"Cape May, NJ",13,45,,4.0,4/5/2016,Great food at a great price brought to you by a wait staff that is both friendly and knowledgeable. The restaurant is generally very clean and the atmosphere is that of a typical sports bar. Definitely a great place to grab a bite.
Naina N.,"Hawthorne, NJ",6,73,6,2.0,2/14/2015,"Expect poor quality of food. The artichoke dip was try, fish and chips were dripping soaked oil, a simple order of fries for my 3yr old wasn't acceptable! The service was amazing. Servers are worth leaving a generous tip for. But the food...NAH!"
Joe S.,"Tuckerton, NJ",12,11,4,3.0,3/21/2014,The food is ok. When ordering wings (either with or without bones) be sure to order with extra sauce. Otherwise they can be pretty dry.
Erika S.,"West Creek, NJ",73,39,,2.0,5/20/2014,"Food was alright. Server was great, very personable, so he may have been the best part of the whole experience. My first drink was pretty good but the second one the bartender totally messed it up big time. It was horrible. The server even told us that the wait for it was so long because it was new and the bartender hadn't ever made it yet. Yeah.. I can tell. I didn't even finish it. It tasted like straight up lime and triple sec, no mango as the description on the menu said."
Devin L.,"Yonkers, NY",296,684,95,3.0,7/31/2010,"A typical Applebee's, but better than most locations. This place has a good bar and great apps. Good place for meeting up with old friends."
Papa Luke 1.,"Orlando, FL",13,118,1,5.0,11/28/2015,The service was excellent!! The server was very attentive and kind. Their cheeseburgers are to die for. The onion rings were the best Ive ever had in my life. The place was perfect unlike some Applebees Ive been to where kts too freaking loud in there. I loved my experience and food.
Tim M.,"Medford, NJ",25,12,2,1.0,7/28/2013,"Crap food, typical of chain restaurants. Wouldn't seat us in a booth, though many were open.  My fiancé's plate was dirty. When she picked it up, it had ketchup on the bottom of it with a napkin stuck to it! Ugh! Absolutely disgusting!  Stay clear. On a plus side, beer was cold, server was ok."
Jack C.,"Manahawkin, NJ",0,4,,4.0,4/11/2015,Food was good had bacon cheeseburger cooked perfectly   Also had sangria which was good. Wait staff was friendly and fast.
Jim B.,"Vero Beach, FL",18,208,19,1.0,5/30/2011,"It never fails. We have bad experience after bad experience but choose NOT to learn from our mistakes. This meal was horrid. Now I will admit I was impressed with the new sizzling plate items. I ordered the stackhouse chicken. It was absolutely burnt and to make matters worse the plate was so hot it continued to burn. Yes I understand ""sizzling"" but you do not burn items then sear them beyond edibility. My wife ordered a medium rare steak. Beyond well done. My dad ordered the stuffed meatballs. One was so hard it bent a fork tine during a demonstration to the server. Never again.... I think. Hey at least the beer was cold."
Louis L.,"Tuckerton, NJ",4,145,,2.0,5/16/2013,"I don`t expect much of chains.They usually fill a void of time & place and not something I purposely venture out for except sometimes its an only option. This location,the servers are always nice and thats what warrants stars,but the food is below par- rubbery chicken on more than 3 occassions. The place gets crowded with teens/young adults at 10 for 1/2 price apps and service then gets overwhelmed and rushy. I used to like the app deal until they take off my faves (potato skins popular but removed and sometimes back again)...Applebees in general much better but this is at the bottom of the chain"
Meredith M.,"Waretown, NJ",0,2,,3.0,10/8/2013,Employees are great here love to go to the bar and watch the games  no problems for me
Chrissy C.,"Stafford Township, NJ",3,61,,1.0,1/3/2013,"we both ordered burgers you should see the size of the plates they put the food on, theres more empty space on the plate  then there was food on the plate  thats what lead us to each count our fries there was at least 10 fries on one plate then 11 fries on the other (these arent large fries either) i just wonder did they just give us the remaining fries that were left instead of having to make additional fries to complete our order"
