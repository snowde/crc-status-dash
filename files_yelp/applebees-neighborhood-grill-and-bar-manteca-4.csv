Kristy I.,"Manteca, CA",18,44,,5.0,7/27/2017,"This review is strictly based on the carside to go. I quit coming here all together awhile back because of the poor service and quality of food inside but decided since I had a gift card to give them a chance and ordered carside.  I placed my order online through the app which was easy to use and convenient. Showed up when they said it'd be ready. We waited about 5 min and then Erica brought out my receipt for me to sign and quickly brought out our order. So the service was prompt and friendly and all around ready when they quoted.  We got home and dug into our meals. They were accurate, fresh, and nicely packaged so that they held up to ""to go"" status. Everything tasted great and everyone was happy!  With this experience I'm hopeful that things inside have changed. I may try giving the inside a chance next time!"
Audjeff E.,"Livermore, CA",0,6,4,2.0,12/14/2017,"I came here with my family and friends on Saturday. Long story short, EVERYTHING was drenched with salt. Fries, chips & salsa, chicken, wrap sandwich, chicken tenders, etc. I had to ""wipe"" my fries with a napkin before eating it to remove unnecessary amounts of salt. I don't mind a little bit of salt but half our food wasn't edible.  Our bill was discounted and we were not charged for my daughters plate.  Stars are for the really nice manager. He was very customer service friendly and apologetic. The waitress was equally as nice.  We won't be coming back to Applebee's. All that salt can cause high blood pressure and water retention."
Mar D.,"Manteca, CA",1,53,17,2.0,10/10/2017,"Hadn't been here in over 6 years because the food was just blah. Today I was invited by a friend for lunch and it's sad to see not much has changed.  My meal was overall flavorless. Even the lemonade was bland (I ended up switching drinks in the middle of the meal). The 2 stars are simply for THE SERVICE. Our server and other waiter who checked on us where both nice and attentive. If you want an affordable sit down, there are tastier places in town."
RC B.,"Manteca, CA",0,11,2,2.0,1/4/2018,"I haven't been here in years but I thought I come with the family and it was their first time in a while too. Anyways, slow slow slow service, it was quite irritating, plus it seemed like the waitresses had no clue what to do. The music, I know it's a restaurant, and the music shouldn't be that big of a deal, but I have no idea what the heck they were playing. 1. It was excessively loud for the type of music 2. It was just strange, like Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Nickel Back, and that Boulder song. Probably won't eat at another Applebee's for another 5 years."
Desiree J.,"Newark, CA",206,17,10,2.0,1/7/2018,"A friend of mine and i came in after a day of shopping and we live in Manteca so we thought we'd have a quick bite before we go home. Walked in, it was pretty busy, of course since it's a saturday night, but the host just glanced at us as we walked in and smiled as he stood there, no greeting or anything. My friend and i are looking around to find any open seating in the bar area but we just choose to wait for an open table, a few minutes later he then asks ""are you waiting for a seat at the bar?"" And we told him, we're waiting for anything. 15 mins later passed and a table finally opens and he then just says ""i would take it if i were you"" honestly... I've worked in the restaurant business and have always been in customer service and i know it shouldn't be that much of a big deal but it is when you're suppose to be a host, a greeter, the first person customers see and talk to when they walk in a restaurant. If i walked into any place with rude customer service like that, i would have walked right out but everywhere else was busy and we just settled. This is suppose to be a family restaurant and you just tell a customer ""i would take it if i were you"" when a table opens up, the least he could've said is that there's an open table and if we'd like to take it, we can. Being a host is the most simple job in a restaurant, the least you can have is common curtesy to customers when they walk in and not expect them to say something first."
Pamela G.,"San Lorenzo, CA",1,14,,1.0,12/31/2017,"THE most horrible time I've ever had at any Applebee's was today! We got a burger with no fries, my Grandson was not going to get his apples until the 3rd asking , I never got my lunch until after the 3rd asking and no refills! Wth?! My daughter got the wrong dressing .. come on!! Were these waitresses and cooks shipped over from some fast food dwelling ?  This was important to us since my son requested this place to eat lunch, as he is moving from us tomorrow and it made it an awful hour ."
Jenny D.,"Manteca, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/31/2017,"My daughter and I came in spontaneously on New Year's Eve & had the most pleasant experience because of the professionalism & upbeat personality of our server, Destiney.  Our food was delivered hot & fresh (props to the kitchen here) in a more than timely manner...  Service with a smile does not begin to cover this server's display of work ethic. I left beyond impressed & extremely satisfied with our overall experience. Way beyond my expectations and we will definitely be back!! -Jenny"
J P.,"Manteca, CA",12,26,2,2.0,11/13/2017,"I just recently started coming back to Applebee's because they finally had a bake potato now it's gone again and back to all the potatoes having garlic in them or tater tots. Some people can not eat garlic, what's wrong with a baked potato? The waitress was not helpful just thru her hands up and said I don't know why they changed it! I don't know about you but I like my steak with a loaded baked potato,guess I'll go back to sizzler"
Grant B.,"Roseville, CA",3,66,156,4.0,10/22/2017,Came here for lunch. Got the 2 for $20 deal. Food was pretty good. Service was friendly. Probably one of the better Applebee's I've been too.
Jennifer M.,"Lynnwood, WA",10,13,1,1.0,8/26/2017,"If I could give a zero I would! We've been eating here for over a year and never, never had any problems. So we order and appetizer and it never gets entered because another waiter clears out our waitress's orders. Hmmm . . . And then I bite into my bacon burger and bite right into a penny. How does that even happen! Â Don't eat here. I could have swallowed that and chipped a tooth or what if it was in a kid's food?"
Jenny G.,"Manteca, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/18/2017,This is probably the worst Applebee's I've been to. Customer service was okay but had three different waiters ask if we needed help.. once we asked how long until we got our food they never got back to us.. the wait for the food was ridiculous!! An hour wait AND the food was not that at all great.. extremely disappointed... should've just gone to in n out down the street SMH
Deniece B.,"Stockton, CA",119,263,85,2.0,3/31/2017,"I ordered the mozzarella caprese chicken and it was very good. The only thing I didn't like was the amount of chicken I got and tomato and mozzarella. I basically had more potatoes than anything.  My friend ordered a steak and it was not good. He could barely eat it without spitting it out. He reordered another and it took 20 mins or more to come out. Once it did, it was slightly better. I guess that's what happens when you order steaks at Applebee's. The service was good and the wait staff and manager were nice."
Jezelle S.,"Hayward, CA",142,146,313,1.0,10/14/2016,"Super spontaneous dinner date with Jessica. I randomly texted her I'm in town and said let's go out to eat. I wanted to eat at a sit down restaurant. Applebee's was the nearest! We came around 8:00P was seating in about 10 minutes and the lady told us our server will be with us shortly. SHORTLY.  This was the first time Jess and I hung out outside of work (weird story how we met) so we were really just talking and catching up on everything. Why did 25 minutes pass and I finally said, ""Where's our server at?"" to her. We both must've looked at each other like damn.. We really been sitting here for stupid long and nobody still has served us. So I stopped one of the workers and asked, ""Hey, can we get a server?"" She immediately apologizes for our long wait and said she's going to be right back to get the server. We go back to our conversation and we get a little into it and forget that another 15 minutes have passed. NO SERVER still? I stop a different person who works there and say, ""We've been waiting for almost 30 minutes now and still no server???"" Again, another lame ass apology and a ""I'll get your server right now"" Now we finally have our server. Got our drinks down and ordered the food. Another 25-30 minute wait for the food. We're over here starving like uh.. Why did we get here at 8:00P and didn't get our food until about 9:15P? Hmm... doesn't seem right to me. We should've left at 9:15P if anything. Ordered 2 for $20! Delicious and big portions. Server didn't check on us once. Had to stop him to refill our EMPTY glasses... hmph... We didn't leave until almost 10:00P. Sorry, but no. I always always always leave tips for people because I know it's a struggle, but I just couldn't do it this time. I really couldn't."
Jaime T.,"Manteca, CA",0,19,,1.0,9/26/2017,"This place is just not what it use to be. The service has deteriorated and so has the quality of food. Our waitress did not come to check on us, she brought us our drinks took our order and sje was MIA. Another lady ended up taking care of us. My salad was served to me on a dirty plate, it had spaghetti sauce and other food particles all over the bottom. The place is not clean either. The window was full of dead flies food pieces, broken crayons and the seats were dirty. Will not be coming here no longer."
Matt B.,"Stockton, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/13/2017,Went there this evening. Bill was $100 for 4 adults and 3 Children. Cannot believe they charged me .75 Cents for gravy on my mashed potatoes. Are they that hard up? Â What's next? Â Charging for the lemon in my water or the ice?
Marcos A.,"Seaport, Stockton, CA",40,1,,1.0,11/25/2017,The service was unpleasant. Took server over 15 minuets to get our drinks . Had to have a manager come after cold food was served to our table. Our waiter David was very disappointing for our visit. We hope they can reevaluate there current situation waiters. Faviana was a great help after needing to get a managers attention.
Michael L.,"Manteca, CA",87,1,,1.0,11/12/2017,"Usually have great service, but tonight was different, my wife and I waited for a server to greet us for 15 minutes. Obviously it never happened, leaving us no choice but to head to in-n-out for a meal. Just irritated that the service staff can talk and hang out and ignore their tables.. worked in the restaurant service for a long time... it just sucks to see servers ignore customers.."
Jordan Rey C.,"Lathrop, CA",54,5,,1.0,11/21/2016,"Probably the worst Applebee's I've been to.... Had dinner with my friend. The option we had was either Mikasa or Applebee's, which we ended up going to the latter. We were greeted as normally but we're told that there's no booth available, the store was half full when we came in, so we ended up taking the seats next to the bar. Sat down and everything, got our server and such. Our order was taken. About 30 minutes had passed and our appetizer wasn't served yet, which was the boneless chicken wings dressed with the spicy sweet asian child. And so it came, it was actually quite good, the only complaint I had was the sauce was super cold, in contrast to the warm chicken nuggets (less wings, more like nuggets). 10 minutes has passed, we were clearly done with our appetizer and our server was busy serving more customers. Another 15 minutes had passed and out main course has finally arrived, way after when the ones next to us got theirs (and they came in 30 minutes after us). I got my favorite which is the Crispy Brewhouse Chicken. The utensils weren't clean as I expected. My plate was sloppy, it was presented nicely but the side of the plate has drippings of sauce on it and I clearly saw fingerprints on it as well, like it was just reused and never been washed.  The food was good, always consistent. Mashed potato was not too salty, very silky and smooth. Onion rings were a tad oily - wasn't put on a strainer. Chicken was cooked done. I have no complaints on the food only the server was killing me, and the sloppy presentation. I love it when the server passed by our table and asked the table next to us if they were doing okay, but not us two. When the food was all set and done, we were just waiting for our receipt. And the server was busy going back in forth onto those two machines at the back and both sides of the bar. Passed by our table a couple times and never bothered checking my friend's water, which was gone.... What pissed me off the most is that when he just took our plates without asking if he can take or if we are done, which was obvious, gave us the bill ($44.40 for 3 plates -- my guy had a stake with two sides). So we finally paid and all, all he said was ""sorry about that"" and nothing else.  The server needs to remember the basics (last time I recall, he never introduced himself). You may have great food but inferior service will bring you down. Applebee's is only good, when it comes to great food, I've had way better ones. And as far I'm concern, it wasn't worth it paying $44 to have a dinner at a place with such horrible service. Most likely won't give this place another chance. Thus, this ends my review for this place.  P.S. - I want that server fired....good enough is never enough."
Michelle V.,"San Leandro, CA",2,79,13,3.0,7/8/2017,First time at this location. we use to go to Applebee's a lot back in the day down in the Bay Area and it's been while since we've been back. First the MENU is honestly ridiculous and has changed so much. Food was MEH.. margaritas were bomb though and our server was very nice (didn't catch her name). Step up the food guys!
Sarah A.,"Ripon, CA",15,21,3,1.0,7/10/2017,"My husband found a piece of glass in his drink. After letting the bar know and telling them they should clean out their ice-manager came over. Sort of apologetic, only comped our 2 drinks. Slow service after our appetizers came out and they switched our new server for a more experienced one. Disappointing-we used to come all the time, but stopped after many disappointing meals."
RT B.,"Manteca, CA",0,2,1,1.0,6/26/2017,"Really BAD experience at this Applebee's tonight. I ordered the top sirloin, it back over cooked. My wife's plate was cold and all they were willing to do was to take one of of the drinks. Manager never came to the table just the waitress. Guess they don't really care about pleasing their customers. I'm out for good."
Joe P.,"Honolulu, HI",1,96,85,1.0,12/7/2016,"First impression from the snubby girls working as greeters in the front, BAD!! Zero Stars. These girls are rude. No personalities. If they dont know you, they wont help you. They just gossip and dont even bother to answer your questions. All they told me and my family is that "" just eat by the bar"" Hell NO!, i got my two little kids. Then I was told that its going to be awhile. But the restaurant is not even full, There are open booths and tables. WTF. Second Impression, we finally sat and our waiter is very nice, very accommodating.  Thirdly, our food is not bad. No complain."
ray t.,"Saratoga, CA",2,59,,4.0,12/7/2017,"we had a group of 22 on a saturday night with no reservation and was still able to be seated within 35 minutes. our server was trevor and he was great...hard working, attentive, and friendly. as with any applebees, food was delicious. Â we had a great dining experience and would come again if we're ever in manteca."
Richard R.,"CA, CA",26,41,140,4.0,11/3/2016,Great great service tonight. Â  Food came out fast and was delicious. Â Happy hour drink and appetizers were great . Should have more meal specials for a 5 star rating . Â Blanca the server was 5 star !!!!!!!
Gigi S.,"La CaÃ±ada Flintridge, CA",0,9,,5.0,8/27/2017,"The reviews I read about this place just didn't fit. We were greeted warmly at the door, seated promptly and served right away. Our server, Eric was excellent telling us about the dishes we were interested in. The food was fresh and tasty and fairly priced. I'd go back again if I were in the area. PS. My husband just said this was one of the best restaurant lunches he's had in a long time."
Nichole V.,"Tracy, CA",127,16,18,1.0,1/17/2017,"So annoyed! It was a typical Busy Saturday night. The waitress came and took our drink order, she did not seem thrilled to be there and it was obvious in her tone of voice and body language. Other servers served our appetizers, Â no plates or silverware. My bf had a water which was refilled not one time. I ordered a pomegranate martini which I finished before dinner came and was not asked if I wanted another. After the orders were put in, I never saw our waitress again until we asked for the bill!!  The salmon came out burned, the soup had soggy tortilla strips in it and the soup was more of a ""spread"" texture than a soup. We had to flag another server down for silverware and napkins, we had to flag another server down to take the soup back (I just asked for it to be removed from the bill). Another server took it back and apologized. Our original server came and said ""what happened?"" And we told her of all the mishaps and how we had to flag others to help us, and she replied with ""oh, we are, down 2 cooks"". We just asked for the bill at that point. After giving our server cash for the bill, 10 minutes later a different server came and handed us our change.  It was a horrible experience, I just wanted to enjoy an evening out with my family because we rarely get to eat out, and it was a HORRIBLE experience! We will never return and I will let my friends and family know to pick a different place to dine. I never had this issue with any other Applebee's I've been to.  The manager never apologized or came to check on us and nothing was done to acknowledge the horrible service.  Ridiculous."
Cassidy F.,"Manteca, CA",80,29,42,2.0,12/31/2015,"We went in to Applebee's to celebrate my mothers birthday. She loves the chicken wonton's. The wait wasn't bad, only about 15 mins for them to prepare our table. We ordered several appetizers which were just average in flavor. Also along with the appetizers came dirty plates.  We ordered spinach dip, salsa, mozzarella sticks, and buffalo wings. The only appetizer worth getting again would be the boneless buffalo chicken wings. When our entrees finally came my ribs were nearly cold. I did not enjoy the cold ribs. Food overall below average  The customer services was also below average. It seemed impossible to get a refill on my drink. I noticed several waitresses see my empty glass and avoided eye contact with me so I could not ask for a refill. I even moved my glass around to ensure they would notice I needed it to be filled. Unfortunately eventually I will return to Applebee's because my stubborn family is refusing change and hasn't upgraded to Red Robbin or even Chilis. So the next time I come back I will just order the boneless buffalo wings. Even though I would still rather get them from anywhere else."
Larissa R.,"Manteca, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/25/2017,"our sever was David, me along with two others in our party arrived a little later and he took ten minutes to come over to take our drink order. then another 15 to actually get them to us. while we were waiting we could see him talking to another table and when he walked pass to ask if we needed anything else he remembered our drinks and quicker went to the back to get them. he then served us cold food to which we had to track down another server and the manager to get us fresh food & refills. after that David treated us very rudely, not even acknowledging us or asking if everything was okay."
Fernando E.,"Santa Ana, CA",49,7,1,2.0,2/11/2017,This place is not the way it used to be. Â Customer service sucks and the food is alright. Â I had a bad experience a month ago at this same location and promised my self that I wouldn't return. Â Today I came back because my kid's were bugging me to bring them well guess what customer service SUCKED again!! That is it not more. Thanks!!
Alfonso T.,"Manteca, CA",4,16,14,1.0,10/19/2016,"Howdy all; I have been regular since 2000, This is truly a good place to hangout with family and friends. And yes you can meet new friends here; however, for the past several months the temperature of all the draft beers has been warm....  No fault of the bartenders..  My belief is that the draft system in place. Holds the warm beer before the cold one comes out of the lines The beer needs to be poured out for period of time before it starts coming cold. So come in late to get a cold one, come in early for a warm beer. All managers and bar staff are aware of the issue. Not sure what they are doing to rectify the problem of warm beer. Comments anyone?"
B W.,"Stockton, CA",6,26,6,1.0,7/17/2017,"I know it showed an update from two days ago but I didn't, Â there might be a problem with the app, so I have came here a couple of times since last year without leaving a review, Â but I'll tell you it sucks now, we both ordered a steak I ordered mine med rare and my girlfriend ordered hers medium, Â hers came out black and burnt dry it was dark and dry on the inside too, mine looked ok kind of too rare, so I told the waiter and he left her plate, took the steak and ordered another so by the time it came she had eaten her cold mashed potatoes and cold broccoli, Â but it finally came it looked cooked right on the inside but burnt on the outside, mine was so stringy I couldn't finish it I was like trying to cut it and It was just too much work we were there nearly two hours, and I got a refill on water once, she got a refill on soda once, I had to yell across the bar to tell him about the steak because he would not look at us. I only hope that the rest of the Applebee's are not the same, but it will probably be a long time before I find out.. so if you want to get drunk and act stupid you will have fun if you want to get a dinner and get what you pay for I hate to say it but Denny's has a better steak and it's not very good, if it weren't late we would have went to black bear diner"
Chamar M.,"Tracy, CA",11,39,16,1.0,2/11/2017,"We were sat down and the seats were wet. Â I asked for some napkins to dry off the seat telling the hostess that the seats were still wet and the hostess seemed irritated and was like oh they're still wet, Â but with attitude like I asked too much of her. I didn't even ask her to dry the seats, Â just to give me some napkins to do it. Â My food was cold, Â I got the four cheese mac and cheese with the honey chicken, Â and the mac and cheese tasted watery and had no flavor, I got two and a half small pieces of chicken and was just seriously disappointed with the food. Â Restaurants like Applebee's keep raising their prices and the quality of the food and services continue to decline... Â I guess family night out will have to start including home cooked dinner. On a positive note they did take the food off of the bill, but that did nothing for my hunger..."
Debra F.,"Sunnyvale, CA",94,3,4,1.0,1/21/2017,"This place is horrible! Rude, Rude, Rude! You need to close! The service was horrible! I will never return to this destination again! I know it's just Applebee's but come on!"
Sue B.,"Lake Forest, CA",2,332,191,4.0,10/12/2015,"Don't know why this Applebee's has such low reviews. We walked over from my hotel and were pleasantly surprised with our service and our meal on a Sunday evening. Â We had the shrimp spinach salad and the shrimp Alfredo pasta. To our surprise, the shrimp was cooked perfectly in both cases. So many places over cook the shrimp. Â Our service was also fast and friendly. Prices are reasonable. It was a good meal and a easy walk from my hotel."
Deanna S.,"Manteca, CA",86,17,,1.0,6/25/2017,"Don't go here, you get seated pretty quickly however the service is never very attentive, and the food us always cold. I have never eaten there and gotten a good experience. Our appetizers and meal come put cold. Refills on drinks....forget it. And portions look like they were made for small children. Don't go here!"
Josh T.,"Lathrop, CA",0,4,,2.0,2/12/2017,"Dined here few nights, and I can honestly day this might be my last time visiting this branch. Me and my wife ordered a sirlion steak cooked medium. We had to send it back because it was lukewarm. And when we did get the steak, it was very dry and bland, lacked of seasoning. I will add a star because our waitress was very helpful and friendly. Unfortunately, we won't be coming back."
Erika M.,"Lathrop, CA",8,5,,1.0,9/27/2017,"Last night at around 730pm on Tuesday 9/26/2017 my family and I went to Applebee's for dinner like we do all the time. The restaurant was not busy we were seated immediately and were ready to enjoy our dinner. Then the series of unfortunate events took place. Â My boyfriends mom and dad ordered two perfect margaritas, being that there were only about 10 people in the bar area and a total of about 7 tables seated in the dining area, you would think one would get their drinks in a reasonable time, but this was not the case. It took about 10 min for the server to even realize that they hadn't received their drinks yet! And then another 5 went by and she finally brought them over to the table. My boyfriends mom got about 3 full pours and his dad barely even got one out of his! When he told the server that he didn't even have enough to fill his glass her response was, ""let me go get you a half a glass"", when the answer should have been let me go get you a new one. He politely declined due to the poor customer service that was displayed. The server was absent and not all there. Now Fast forward to when our dinner arrives at the table at the same moment we were thinking about just paying our bill and leaving. We ordered four entrees and one kids meal, which was a corn dog and cheese sticks, the four entrees arrived and no kids meal. Our dinners were not warm, probably because they had been sitting in the kitchen for so long because our server was so absent. So we waited...and waited.. and still no child's meal. Which should have been the first meal to come out being that it is pre made! So about another ten minutes have gone by and if we didn't ask for his meal the server would have never even noticed it was never given to us. My boyfriends dad then asked to speak to a manager when another server came by. The manager comes up to our table and before we even say anything he apologizes!!! We were all thrown off. My boyfriends dad responds to him by saying ""sorry for what?!"" And the manager says, ""that's how they train us to approach the table"", the manager was unprofessional entirely. When we explained what horrible service we had been receiving he apologized and said he wanted to make it right. My boyfriends dad told him I'm not looking to get anything free I just thought you should know the horrible service your restaurant has so you can make it better. The manager said thank you and then left. We will not be going to this Applebee's anymore due to the terrible guest experience this location serves. The manager was not on the floor at all the entire night, normally when we eat here the managers are always on the floor easy to see and going to each table and asking how everything is, this gentleman was absent and in the back until asked for."
Miranda M.,"Ripon, CA",167,4,,1.0,2/2/2017,"My boyfriend and I always love coming here for dinner. Last week I believe it was a Wednesday night we came for dinner and I ordered a steak with green beans and my boyfriend ordered the chicken and shrimp. The service was awesome but our food was TERRIBLE. I've never had this happen here. I asked for my steak medium rare and it came out so over cooked I could barely eat it, plus there was no seasoning on it what so ever. My boyfriends chicken was so charred and over cooked as well. We stuck with the mashed potatoes and luckily we had ordered an appetizer to fill our hunger."
Andrew S.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,12,4,1.0,11/27/2016,"Poor, horrible service and disgusting cheaply made over cooked dry food!! Need to send Jon Taffer out here! The kitchen needs some work! Waited over 15 mins to even get served a drink and the food order was completely messed up! Burgers were dry and over cooked! Alcohol didn't even taste like there was any alcohol in there! Manager was nice in the end but definitely left a fowl taste in my mouth!"
Alyssa C.,"Stockton, CA",54,17,2,3.0,6/22/2017,"In my opinion this place is clean, has quality food and crappy service. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and asked if we would like to sit in the bar area. We sat in the bar area thinking it should be quick since it was pretty slow. We waited about 10 minutes before our waitress asked what we wanted to drink. We ordered two drinks and an appetizer. Our drinks came back fast which was expected. The waitress said she would give us ""a couple mimutes"" & she would be back to take our order. 30 minutes later she finally came back to get our order and not to mention we haven't got our appetizer yet. So, we order and she just had a poor attitude. I'm not sure if she was having a bad day or not but I left her name out just in case she was. Our appetizer comes and we finish then waited another 5 minutes for our food. We both ordered the brewhouse chicken. It was delicious! Props to the cook! When we received our bill it was 50 bucks.. pricing sucks! We did notice a certain fee I don't recall what it was called but it was 2 dollars added. I asked the waitress what is was and she said ""you don't even have a tablet on your table I'll just take it off."" Not sure what it meant but I'm glad I looked. This experience is why I'm giving Applebees a 3 out of 5."
