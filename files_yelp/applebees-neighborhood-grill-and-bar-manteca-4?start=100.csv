Samantha P.,"Manteca, CA",1,29,8,4.0,3/20/2014,Love coming here!! Someone always opens the door for us when we come in and when we leave. Most of the staff is very friendly. The only nights that I  would say not to go if you want fast service would be Saturday night and Friday night. That's when a lot of people are out and they are very busy. They do play bingo which is kind of fun as you get a gift certificate. Overall we very much enjoy coming here.
Kelly S.,"Manteca, CA",0,9,,4.0,5/4/2014,"Sometimes the food is good and sometimes it's alright when it comes to buying a meal. The one thing I love is that you can go there with a group of friends and they have happy hour late at night for half off appetizers, which makes it's easy for everybody to have variety of all types of finger foods for such a good price. Buffalo wings are my favorite mmmmmm:)"
Nikka G.,"San Jose, CA",2,26,1,3.0,3/18/2015,"I cant really say this Applebee's is the best I've been to in my life because it seems like we ALWAYS get the same waitress and for some reason she always has to leave mid-waiting on us. This seems pretty rude and kinda weird at the same time, you always sick when we come in? You always gotta take your break ""all of a sudden"" right when you get to our table? Jeez Louise! Prepare your breaks BEFORE getting another table or maybe don't come help us for a minute then feel ""sick"" just don't take another group of people."
Ryan T.,"Manteca, CA",196,169,17,2.0,9/18/2012,I'd get better service from a Manteca bum. He'd definitely have more life than the service crew here. It gets 2 stars because I at least like the food here. It's just sad to me that the crew doesn't give a crap.
Angel G.,"Stockton, CA",43,66,75,1.0,2/21/2013,Ok just came for drinks and some appetizers. Not even a complicated order and they forgot my appetizer. Wow. Plus they didn't even offer anything else and just gave my check. I'll take Stockton's Apple Bee's any day.
Meghan M.,"Sacramento, CA",73,117,,1.0,9/22/2010,"SOOOOOOOOOOOO, just for the record I HATE applebees in general..... BUT a bunch of my coworkers and I were leaving a business meeting and it was the only ""real' ( and i use that word lightly) restaraunt in the area we were in. (which was the middle of nowhere). The food at Applebee's is just disgusting. I mean, i dont understand how they are still in business ANYWHERE.... it's overly salty, over cooked, doesn't taste good.. I mean COME ON!!!!! I give it one star because my Shirley Temple was on point...."
PAUL O.,"Monte Sereno, CA",2,21,,1.0,12/6/2014,Very disappointed in the service .music way too loud it's a mini wana be club.  I thought it was a eatery not a night club. Music is cool but not at this volume. If your gonna play music at least get good speakers to play thru. Sounds like shit
Susan S.,"Alameda, CA",302,170,6,4.0,6/10/2010,"I can't believe I'm actually giving an Applebee's a 3.5 star rating (rounded up to 4) but I had two good experiences there while out in exotic Manteca. After trawling up the main industrial strip, there looked like there were some great local Mexican restaurants.  There was one right across the street from the infamous ""Inn"" where Wild Child and I stayed. After we checked in our room, WC and I went by the front desk and I asked the front desk clerk if she knew of any good places within walking distance (since I needed a stiff drink after trying to find our hotel).  This clerk was very polite but didn't get my visual cues that my eyes and head were tilting towards the Taqueria across the street when I asked her that question. Much to my disappointment, she said, ""Oh, there's an Applebee's two blocks down across the street.""   ""Sh*t!  Sh*t! Sh*t!!"" I am thinking.  I should have covered WC's ears when I asked the question since he was the one who needed fueling before a grueling set of three games of soccer the next day.  He immediately perked up and said ""Applebee's, Mom!"" Note: much to the chagrin of my older two foodie kids, WC is my ""picky"" eater who loves places like Applebee's, which is incomprehensible to them since they love my cooking and eating at good local restaurants. It was a mystery to me why the Taqueria across the street wasn't recommended.  However, I have a couple of theories why the white front desk clerk recommended Applebee's even though, after the fact, I checked out the Taqueria on Yelp and it had some very positive reviews.  *sigh* Here are just a couple of theories on what the clerk was thinking: 1. A redhead and a blonde would stand out at such a local hangout like a couple of albinos in Spanish Harlem.  One would notice!  I personally could have cared less. 2. The parking lot was one of those big ones very close to the highway where serious sh*t could go down after hours and cars can speed away. 3. Being a Manteca resident, she was tired of great local Mexican food.  What a spoiled brat! So, what was great about having to go to this Applebee's?  Well, even though it was packed with people waiting, they sat WC and I right away since WC loves those high bar tables with the grownup highchairs!  They also make no bones on the kids' menu that they serve ""Kraft Mac and Cheese"" rather then acting like they make it from scratch. Just guess what WC ordered?   My ""cracked pepper and bleu cheese"" steak and the rest of the meal was just okay but they did get the medium-rare part right.  I have a theory that Applebee's steaks come from cattle raised in a bizarre Applebee's biosphere somewhere...maybe it's just me but you be the judge.. However, their featured margarita served in a martini shaker was surprisingly good, not at all watered down like so many Applebee's do to their cocktails.  I had a sense that there is some stiff (pardon the pun) margarita competition amongst bartenders in Manteca! AND, the best part is we got this waitress, with an unusual name that ran in her family..and I'm kicking myself for not remembering it but she was genuinely perky in a good way and super speedy and we never had to flag her down.  We even returned for a harried lunch the next day between soccer matches and happened to be lucky enough to get her again.  Sensing that we were in a hurry, she went in and must have charmed the lunch cooks into expediting our order to go amongst absolute chaos. Service: 5 lucky stars in our case.  Serendipity can be a wonderful thing. Food:  3 stars for me.  4 for WC *me trying not be look embarrassed here* Ambiance:  It's a frigging Applebee's.  What do you expect?"
Alisha H.,"Manteca, CA",0,12,3,5.0,11/11/2014,"Sat in the bar area and received service right before 4 so got to order the lunch special. Spinach salad was delish, the dressing was sweet and perfect with the shrimp! Love love love the French onion soup and buffalo wings. Went together very well. Service was friendly as well"
Janice V.,"San Francisco, CA",369,600,798,4.0,7/23/2010,"I've been coming here a few times with my family recently. I think the only reason why we love coming here is the 2 for $20 deal which is great. My sister and I usually get that deal with the spinach dip as our appetizer and 7 oz sirlon with mash potatoes and vegetables as our entrees. I take back what my previous review said about rarely having good servers. The last few times I've been here, the waitresses were great. They kept coming to our table to ask if we need anything, refilling our drinks, and giving us extra napkins even if we didn't need it. Like all Applebee's, there's a thing if the manager doesn't come by to your table before you get your check, you get $10 off your chek."
Courtney C.,"Modesto, CA",12,6,1,3.0,2/28/2013,I asked for salad instead of fries with my chicken sandwich. I waited about half an hour before my food even got to me. And my salad was in the basket with my sandwich. Worst Bloody Mary ever. I didn't even finish it.
Thomas P.,"Lathrop, CA",41,240,22,1.0,7/9/2012,The worst applebee's I've ever been to... you my friend deserve this rateing
Eric B.,"Hickman, CA",19,43,2,4.0,3/31/2013,I really like the waton tacos. the drink speicals are good. becoming a good place to hang out
Charly D.,"South San Francisco, CA",27,2,4,1.0,4/15/2012,"I'm sitting here as I write this review.  I've been waiting for almost an hour on my food,  it's taking forever for just an entree and the bad part is there not even busy. The place is not even packed.... I came here because I know I'll get fast service but instead I get the worst service! Would not recommend to anyone who's is short tempered with an empty stomach."
Robert S.,"Lodi, CA",63,195,179,1.0,3/6/2012,"Came here on the night my wife and me first met (first date). Wife had? (cant remember), I had steak n long hair shrimp. there was about a foot long hair in my plate. They comped the meal but really long hair shrimp, just knida runis the whole thing."
Ryan M.,"Hayward, CA",168,42,14,3.0,5/30/2012,I just drink beer here service can be slow that's why only 3 stars
Ling Ling R.,"Sacramento, CA",49,116,96,4.0,1/31/2012,Great happy hour!! And they sell jello shots! Great place to hang out and catch up with your girlfriends!
Fernando A.,"Manteca, CA",12,37,374,1.0,10/20/2011,Been here for 20 minutes and have not received our  appetizer. Waitress has zero personality and when The appetizer finally showed up  half of it was cold.The food was  average and everything was bland with no flavor. Will not return to this location because of the quality of the food and service.
Michelle L.,"Manteca, CA",66,4,,1.0,3/20/2014,"My co-workers and I spend a lot of money here on to-go orders. We received coupons for free lunch combos.. I called to place a to-go order with this coupon. After being placed on hold for roughly 8 minutes, somone answered and I informed her of my coupon. She told me the coupon was good for dine-in only. I told her I am at work whenever they offer the lunch combos and we are in a very busy season and asked if she coupld please make an exception.. since we order from them often.. she cuts me off and puts me on hold for another TEN minutes. then a woman who i assume is the manager called Kimberly answers the phone and with the worst attitude tells me there isnt anything they can do. The issue is not the concept, its how i was treated being a loyal customer that i am. Too bad for them. Lost a lot of business between me and my co-workers."
Ron S.,"Tracy, CA",72,331,289,3.0,7/28/2010,"Never had a bad meal here, yes it's a chain but it's one of the better chain resturants, they are open till midnight now which is a plus for the bar. The bar is big and clean I go there often just to drink. Today I got a fish sandwich, it's just like fish and chips but on a bun, tarter sauce was good, fish was crispy but not over cooked."
