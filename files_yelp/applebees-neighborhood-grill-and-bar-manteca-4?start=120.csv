Nette P.,"San Diego, CA",15,16,5,5.0,8/19/2011,Love the Manteca Applebees!! Always go for the late night happy hour.  I love the different game nights they have and the service is pretty good.  The food is pretty good and the atmosphere is local goodness!  I'd rather go to this one than the Stockton one and I live in Stockton!
Nate D.,"Manteca, CA",53,16,12,1.0,2/17/2012,Ordered the three chicken penne. Came out cold. When I told them about they took it back no problem. They microwaved it an brought it back to me. Now it's dry. The chicken came out completely dry. Very sub par. You come to expect a level of service and their actions show they give you otherwise. I understand your busy but your service should never take a back seat to being order takers
Christina R.,"Manteca, CA",0,3,3,1.0,6/28/2013,"I've been a customer since they opened. I've always gone to them for a quick lunch were tasty dinner. Unfortunately the last few times I went,  my food came out under cooked, cold, and tasteless. I will no longer go back in there after the service I received my last time. Our waitress forgot that she even have a job as a waitress there  and completely ignored her tables including mine and even decided to sit with another table for over 5 minutes. We received hot sodas and beers, cold appetizers, a raw and bloody hamburger, an entree that was completely wrong, and a salad with a zip tie in it. Manager for the night did not address any of the issues and our waitress gave such a horrible attitude that we ended up walking out. I wish I could say I want to go back, but I feel as if there will be no solution to their declining quality in service and food. There are lot of new faces in there from waitresses and managers. I hope they're able to better improve their staff. It's such a shame that there's not another place in Manteca like them to dine at. Please make good changes!"
Bob A.,"Vallejo, CA",166,425,796,5.0,3/29/2009,"definitely a 5 today my cousin and I ate a 2 for 20 deal meal. Bacon Cheeseburgers with onion rings and chicken wings. The food was good and the Amanda our server was excellent. The 2 for 20 deal, gives you a choice of two entrees and an appetizer for 20. Our server Amanda was top notch and made eating at Applebees pleasurable."
Crystal B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",294,61,6,4.0,5/27/2011,Margarita specials! yay!!!! I've been to this location and the one in Huntington Beach and they were both pretty tasty.  Strawberry mango margarita is the way to go for sure.
Frank D.,"Vacaville, CA",0,3,,2.0,6/19/2011,Bland food. Chicken had no flavor. Perfect margarita was far from and too expensive. For price other chains have better quality. Service was below average. Several years ago our family liked Applebees. Now we avoid them in general. Thus time we did boot have a better alternative.
Cindy Y.,"Manteca, CA",61,51,,5.0,1/15/2011,"Great food, I love the 2 for 20! Everything is always yummy, kinda generic food though, nothing really wows my palate. Love the artichoke spinach dip"
Sarah M.,"Manteca, CA",218,263,420,2.0,8/22/2012,I normally like Applebees but this location disappoints me. The service I get when I come is usually just ok (neither good or bad) and the food is well......not good. I came here tonight and got the Fiesta Lime Chicken which is normally a really good entree. Well this location has managed to mess it up. The chicken was very dry and there was hardly any zesty lime sauce on the chicken which was a major disappointment because that is a major part of the dish. My husband ordered the Three Cheese Chicken Penne and that was very bland also. He basically got noodles with tomatoes and chicken only; hardly any cheese or Alfredo sauce. The only good that we ordered tonight was the Boneless Wings with the Southern BBQ sauce. The sauce had a perfect mix of sweet and tang and that the only good food that we ordered tonight. Then for dessert I had one of those Hot Fudge Sundae Shots. They even managed to make that disappointing. They barely put any hot fudge in it and the ice cream was not that cold as if it had not been the freezer very long. All in all this particular Applebees is far less superior in quality to the other locations I have eaten at. I would recommend skipping this location and trying another one if you want Applebees.
Samuel C.,"Stockton, CA",54,114,58,1.0,9/3/2009,"rude employees, slow service, mediocre food, bad management enough said"
Cora C.,"Lathrop, CA",14,2,,1.0,4/29/2012,"This has got to be one of the worst places to go for lunch or dinner ever!!!!! The service SUCKS! The food isn't any better and I will never go there again and would never recommend them either. You have 6 servers standing around talking and not one came over even after 10 minutes to see if we wanted a drink,so we got up and walked out. Of course as we are getting up the server comes over to see if we need anything!? Really!!! Screw Applebee's"
Nicole A.,"Tracy, CA",47,7,,1.0,11/4/2011,"Horrible service. It took forever to get drinks even though there were only few people in the resturante when we arrived. Horrible food, our burgers where cold and the cheeze was not melted at all. Our waitress acted like it was the first time anything like this had ever happened, when she pointedly said she gave us extra fries for ""the wait""...will not be going back to this location ever."
Robert S.,"Manteca, CA",25,10,6,2.0,7/4/2010,"not too excited about the food here, service and speed can be kinda ""iffy"" and you may end up waiting a long time for your food during the slow times, but their Happy Hour? probably one of the best spots for sure"
Diane B.,"Manteca, CA",42,11,,1.0,3/1/2007,"My advice to anyone who must eat here, is to have at least one Perfect Margarita before you eat. (you can get about 3 drinks out of that cocktail shaker). Then when your food is just ok and your waitperson is completely incompetent, you probably won't even care.(and the margarita is actually great)"
Bonnie S.,"Buena Park, CA",420,440,825,2.0,12/24/2007,went during happy hour and ordered a bunch of appetizers and a burger.. but service was really slow even though waitress was nice...slow service is never good when u are hungry or thirsty.. so that kinda of ruined it for me.
Sarah T.,"Manteca, CA",1,4,,5.0,2/1/2011,I love this place 2 for $20 is great. If your gonna come here eat the Fiesta Lime Chicken! Its fantastic! All their food is great but that is one of the best plates ive ever eaten! I always order this and never get sick of this. Wonderful service always.
Brian H.,"Manteca, CA",4,37,,3.0,1/26/2007,"The food is ALWAYS cold from this place, and the wait is always at least a 1/2 hour to get in...go figure?!?! If you can get a competent server, then your chances of getting the food you ordered are pretty good, although it will still be COLD. However, if you are lucky enough to get one of their several incompetent servers, then, may the force be with you, cuz you don't ever know what you'll get from the kitchen."
Steve H.,"San Miguel, CA",1,47,1,3.0,6/24/2006,"I only gave it three stars because our server was very attentive and competant. The food was mediocre (I know, it's just Applebee's, but it all looks so much better on TV), and the margaritas were OK. It is what it is."
Rusty H.,"Manteca, CA",21,8,,4.0,10/12/2006,"So I was headed to Applebee's last night off route 120 with my boy Rodney, riding shot gun in the bandit and drinking a High Life tall boy (Red Carpet Liquors was fresh out out of Country Club and mom always says its bad for my teeth to drink from bottles whenever Rodney is driving).  Rick, our grit boss over at Pete's heating and cooling in Discovery Bay was taking us out for our annual top performer appreciation night. I have installed over 40 hvac systems this year.  I beat out Chuck. Chuck didn't get to go to Applebee's last night. So we get to Applebee's and they don't have Chicken Fried Steak. Who the f*ck doesn't have chicken fried steak? They didn't have Country Club either. They didn't even have high life, so I had to get a miller light in a bottle for $4. I guess I really don't like Applebees, but I hear the ladies like it and Rusty likes the ladies. 4 stars for the sluts I'm gonna bring to Applebee's after I get my Christmas bonus."
