Sammer H.,"Stockton, CA",6,23,23,2.0,4/30/2017,"Had lunch here today and had the worst ribs I've ever had!  Day old ribs or Way over cooked and dry AF, chef shouldn't have served this to a customer!    Our server was good and attentive, but won't be back!"
Dena C.,"Tracy, CA",19,5,5,1.0,11/12/2016,"This is the worst Applebee's' I have ever been.  First off, they have 10 open tables and we were quoted 15 minute wait. Then the waiters/waitress took forever to acknowledge us once we were seated. I have been to many Applebee's around the nation and I will never come back to this one."
Dave N.,"Woodbridge, CA",14,66,398,1.0,12/9/2015,"I ate here with my coworkers today. We had a party of 7 total and sat at the bigger round table (back left of the restaurant). We were greeted by our waitress Jessica after about 7-10 minutes sitting down. After everyone ordered their drinks, I spoke up and told her I think everyone's ready to order. I wasn't 100% sure if everyone was onboard and ready to order, but the people who were ready went first while the couple others made their lunch selection. I spoke up prematurely to get our orders put, because I had a feeling it'd take awhile to get drinks out. Where I work, we're given an hour lunch. We had come here a time or two within the past couple months and had always been able to get in and out during the hour. The food has always been decent and the service has always varied based on server. The 7-10 minute wait for the waitress to come up and introduce herself ended up foreshadowing an even greater waiting time for the food.  There was actually a point during this visit where I thought the Cooks in the back had died. Over 30 minutes had gone by and nothing was coming out of the kitchen. Not even any of our appetizers. I was looking around at what looked I thought was a non-busy lunch service and literally saw no food coming out onto any tables. Jessica continued being attentive and refilled our drinks, but never mentioned she would go check on the food for us. After 40 minutes of waiting a couple started joking around at our table, 'did the cooks go on lunch break?', 'are they on smoke break or something?' You could tell their sense of humor was showing through as a veil clothing the frustration of the waiting period. Around 50 minutes had gone by and there was no visual sign of any food being brought out, no manager walking around on the floor assisting staff, and no one giving us any heads up of what was going on in the kitchen. I don't know if a cook or two quit half way into lunch service or what, it came off like the kitchen was completely cold.  We flagged down Jessica as she was walking by and told her to tell the cooks that we needed to get the food boxed up and take it to go. We also needed help on splitting the checks 7 different ways manually because the Ziosk at the table wasn't working properly. Jessica went to the back and told them to box everything and must've not realized how much time had past. I'm assuming this because there was no apology about not getting any food to our table, and it hitting a point where we spent our whole lunch hour sitting around drinking tea, lemonade, and water. She informed us they were boxing it all up and got together everyone's checks split up appropriately. Finally onto the food here. I ordered the 2 for $24 with a co-worker. We both went with the chicken tender platter. The platter is an additional $2 on top of the standard chicken tender basket. You're promised a larger portion of food in the platter. After the even split, my tab was around $16 and some change. It was $12 and some change for the chicken tender platter and $2-3 for the drink plus tax. I mention the price for you to make a correlation with the image of the food I ended up receiving. The food was far from warm. When you're given fresh hot food in a plastic to-go box, the steam automatically starts fogging up the plastic container the food is in. The to-go container stayed clear the whole time and it had me wondering how long ago the food had actually been cooked. The icing on the cake here was that they forgot to include any dipping sauces for everyones meals. One in my party had ordered an oriental chicken salad and they gave him no dressing. They didn't even pack in any to go plasticware. To say this visit replicated my past visits here would be a lie. Obviously we saw this place as a decent spot to come for food if we had visited it a couple times somewhat recently. What's strange is the last time we were here, the staff seemed very cheery, jolly, and more than willing to teach the customers how to use the Ziosk's at the tables to help lighten your server's load. This time around it's like the place literally did a full 180 degree turn for the worst. I'm more than disappointed here. The portion sizes have always seemed fair and the food has always tasted fine. Not only did we end up wasting our time for horrible food, I felt ripped off paying a couple bucks extra to upsize my meal and get a laughable portion size. I'm not trying to come off cheap here. I want you to mentally correlate a $20 meal (when you include tip) with the food I received in my attached photo. If they continue down this track, this location won't be around much longer. I am beyond amazed at how you can have good service/food one day, only to return a couple weeks later and leave feeling like you should of just ordered at a jack in the box.  I don't plan on returning to this location anytime soon. I don't know if there's been major staff changes or what happened but this place is going downhill big time."
James N.,"Lathrop, CA",28,21,8,5.0,9/1/2016,Eat here all the time never yelped it before service always a pleasure never really have had a bad order
Cliff O.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/9/2016,"Had multiple terrible experiences today, our first restaurant for lunch was terrible, and the hockey game we went to sucked. However, our server Gianna at this Applebee's was quite possibly the best part of our day. Always happy and joking and she was able to get our orders out incredibly quickly."
Shaun F.,"Manteca, CA",20,21,39,5.0,11/8/2014,"Sara at the bar and Gabe as your server best duo to dine with! Jessica is known for getting the Buffalo wings, Ryan get the Asian sauce on his wings, Natalie gets the chocolate milk and Nana gets the iced tea!"
Peter G.,"Modesto, CA",1,258,41,2.0,5/18/2016,Service was above average. Server needs to be aware of current specials. A bit long waiting for out food. Took the lunch special and food was good but very small amount. Either have larger portions or lower the price.
Gio G.,"Stockton, CA",110,10,,4.0,6/6/2016,"Hostess was very polite, even opened the door for us. Noise level for a Monday night was okay. Sever was amazing! Erica kept checking on us and brought food very quickly. Great night!"
Estefania A.,"Stockton, CA",10,34,1,5.0,6/24/2015,"Went here for dinner with my boyfriend on Saturday night. We were told a 10-15 minute wait. We only waited about 10 minutes and were seated at a booth. Our server was wonderful and attentive but not overbearing.  There seemed to be a problem at the next table and the server told us food was behind. Our appetizer (hot wings) didn't take long to get to us at all, and it was hot and delicious.  The customers at the table next to us continued to complain, even after they got their food and the manager came out and apologized profusely. Our waitress kept apologizing for the wait but honestly, we didn't wait long at all for our entrees. My steak was medium rare, hot and yummy. My mashed potatoes were lukewarm, but it was no biggie.  I had a great experience here and enjoyed it much better than the Applebee's in Stockton. I thought the manager and waitresses were very professional on handling the difficult table and sadly their efforts were in vain because that table just could NOT be satisfied. Thank you, Applebee's of Manteca!"
Aaron W.,"Manteca, CA",24,66,3,1.0,3/20/2016,Waited for over an hour for my food. And this was not the first time this has happened. Even with a packed restaurant I never should wait that long for a burger and fries. Unacceptable.
John R.,"Manteca, CA",1,21,15,1.0,11/19/2016,"Horrible food, who creates the menu. I've tried to give this place a second try but same results. No more for me."
Latecia G.,"Lathrop, CA",0,12,11,5.0,10/24/2016,"I should have done this a while back, because I'm always treated with the upmost respect, but tonight I felt it was a need. It really bothered me to see a waiter be picked at for every little thing. Even after the manager came out and compensated them on the bill, they were still unsatisfied. The waiter even came and genuinely apologized on her behalf , they were still not satisfied and talked mess the whole time. By the time my waiter got to me I really respect her for keeping it together, although I could tell she was having a ruff time, she still approached me with a smile engaged with my daughter and put a smile on her face. This is actually the second time she has served me and my family so Jessica you did a hell of a job as always.... Thank you and never let anyone steal your JoY we Thank you again and again and I hope this review reach headquarters you deserve to be acknowledge because that crowd was very disrespectful and rude"
Pam L.,"Manteca, CA",1,5,,1.0,11/12/2016,"Just walked in to 4 tables and 3 booths empty. Told there will be a 25-30 minute wait. Ridiculous, what happened to customer service? Saturday night? Its a staffing issue."
Shelbi D.,"Valley Springs, CA",24,10,,1.0,12/31/2015,"Awful. The servers were SO slow. It really wasn't too busy. The cook couldn't cook a steak if their life depended on it. It was way overcooked twice, burned once. Ridiculous. Stockton Applebees is WAY better."
Ken H.,"Manteca, CA",7,18,,1.0,3/21/2016,"Worst restaurant in town...any town...anywhere. Unfortunately, only thing open except in n out. Next time, in n out. Applebee's still sucks after all these years. Now I know why I haven't been here in years. Plus...this building is too new to smell sooooooooooo old and dirty when you walk in. I guess one of the bonuses to microwave cooking is you don't have to smell that god-awful food."
Amy B.,"Manteca, CA",4,7,,5.0,4/18/2016,Went here Sunday night and had some fantastic service...and some blah service. Our server jessyka was fantastic. She was so nice to my son who was a little squirmy while we waited for our food. She actually overheard him say he liked croutons and brought him a little bowl of them. Those things count when you have a picky eater who can't sit still. She was so sweet. The server who took over when she went on break pretty much forgot about us. I asked the young man who was seating people if there was a website I could take a customer service survey to give Jessyka some positive feedback and the guy gave me a business card with a website to fill out a job application. Weird. The food was fantastic and so was Jessyka!
Nicole H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,4,,5.0,4/28/2016,I had an excellent experience today for lunch. My order came out incorrect. The manger Chris came right over and apologized for the mistake. He said they wanted my meal to be made fresh and it sure was! The chicken was grilled perfect and tasted delicious. Chris comped my meal. Our waiter Daniel was also very attentive and helpful. Great customer service!
C C.,"Stockton, CA",0,48,,5.0,3/26/2016,"Last nite we had quesadilla burger and chicken fingers basket 2 for$20 came with a salad. Food, service and atmosphere was great."
Louie R.,"Manteca, CA",26,4,20,1.0,4/11/2015,There a reason why this place has low star  Service sucks  No hospitality Menu so confusing.  Food is good  They have sone opportunity that they need to fix or they going lose more customers.
Debbie T.,"Castro Valley, CA",1,1,,4.0,7/25/2015,The food was good enough but half our order was missing?  They were very nice but did forget the utensils also were from out of town so we had our food but nothing to eat it with
