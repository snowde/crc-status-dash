Jimbo S.,"Calasiao, Philippines",2,19,,2.0,9/27/2015,"Well I've only been here a couple times....but when I came here today I found out they had no draft beer available. Might I mention it was a Sunday during the third week of football season?!! They weren't even offering discounts on other drinks to appease or try and make more sales due to the downed beer system. Lack of effort by management in my opinion. Other than that, my gf had a Long Island and she thought it was really good. The guy running the host stand def has a stuttering problem, probably not the best position for him as he is the first person to greet the guests. Again, poor management in my opinion."
John D.,"Manteca, CA",13,9,,2.0,8/24/2014,"We started coming to this Applebee's back in 2001,2002. It was our go to place. Food was good, prices reasonable, service really good. That all changed over the years. We would give it a break figuring new cooks and managers would be hired and we would try again and then kick ourselves and say ""why did we go""? The last time, my wife ordered their riblet basket. They came out with just a handful of riblets and they were so burnt you could not eat them. I ordered their meat loaf and it came with one skinny piece and tasted like dog food. Called the manager over and this 25yo pimply ""kid"" comes over and says the meal is on him. I ask him if he would eat those riblets or would he pay $12 for this crappy meatloaf. He goes duhhhh...ehhhh. Must be the black cloud over our heads."
Andriy K.,"UC Campus Area, Berkeley, CA",22,4,,5.0,2/7/2016,The food was good. The service was fast. The servant did her job well. I'd definitely recommend this place if you are looking for food during your trip.
Kelly M.,"Modesto, CA",26,66,14,2.0,10/20/2015,"I came here on Sunday afternoon. I asked one of the staff member if there was happy hour all day Sunday's because the riverbank location offers that, for drinks and appetizers. She said This one only has drinks on special no apps until late night :( so I was upset about that because I could of gone to the riverbank location and enjoyed apps drinks and football. The food we ordered was decent though. Wouldn't come back because they only offer half off apps for late night, which is too late for all dem carbs."
Annette S.,"Manteca, CA",100,32,9,2.0,11/10/2015,Seriously Applebees the one thong I can count on is for you to disappoint!! The side salad I PAY FOR has been downgraded to this little dish not much bigger than my hand!! Service slow & inattentive as usual.....This is why we haven't been here in awhile. Now I remember why.....
Brandy M.,"Camarillo, CA",1,14,1,4.0,7/19/2016,"Needed a cold beer and appetizers tonight after a long drive. Our server was super sweet. Unfortunately, I forgot to get her name but she had long light brown hair and did a great job. We sat at a high top in the bar area. Food was average applebees, but service was great!"
Perla O.,"Stockton, CA",88,17,,1.0,10/2/2015,"0 stars for Bad management. Waitress did not get our order right but management kept insisting that this particular waitress never gets an order wrong like what the hell ??!! She's not perfect !! She sure messed up big time. Management made us ""happy"" but waitress resulted in getting no tip! Thank you very much we will not be coming back at least for a while until new management takes over!!! Food was delicious as always !"
Nicki M.,"Manteca, CA",4,22,235,2.0,8/31/2015,I went to lunch with my grandma today and needless to say the food was HORRIBLE. The service was good and our waitress was very patient with us. I also came here last weekend and again the food wasn't good. I thought last weekend they were just having a bad day but I'd say it's not just a bad day! I don't know if this place got new management or what.. But either the manager or corporate needs to do something about their food.
Riza S.,"Tenderloin, San Francisco, CA",35,3,,2.0,12/22/2013,"I don't like to post negative Yelp reviews. I'm a hotelier and restaurateur. Negative reviews are damaging. But this is a chain and at a chain, I expect the sort of neighborhood service that Applebee's advertises. On 12/22 at around 2:15pm, I walked in with my mother. There was another couple of ladies waiting and apparently they had been standing there for quite some time. No one had greeted them. No host to be seen. We stood there for another 5-8 minutes. I know that 5 minutes doesn't seem like a long time, but when you're a customer ANYWHERE, being ignored for more than 30 seconds is not a good feeling. A server walked by and didn't say hello. The shift manager walked up to the desk and instead if saying ""Hi, have you been helped yet?"" or ""I'm sorry for the wait, can I help you?"" He simply looked at his clipboard and said ""Did she get your name yet?"" ...who?! There hasn't been anyone at the door! Poor leadership skills, there! Own your areas! And you could have seated the two ladies who had been waiting for over 20 minutes instead of saying ""Okay, she'll get you seated,"" take ownership and do it yourself! And to the hostess, I believe your name was Dayana (yeah, that's what name tags are for), usually the first thing you say to waiting people is ""hello"" or ""sorry for the wait"" and you know what? If you're having a bad day or someone's pissed you off or you hate your job, the guests can see it. Don't walk guests to the table as if it was the most deplorable thing you've been asked to do. There's other people in Manteca who need jobs and will probably do it with a lot more respect for the operation than you do. And I got a dirty plate. Lovely. No food on the table (we were waiting) but the share plate was dirty. Nice water soaked melted cheese attached to it. Manteca Applebee's, you're currently sitting at 2.5 stars. This isn't the only review that says service sucks. That's a sign. We're not here to deface you, we're writing yelp reviews to help you!"
Lorne P.,"Manteca, CA",69,5,,1.0,11/7/2015,"I decided to try their car side to go. It was the worst! Phone ran for ever before someone picked up. Then they fast talked me and transferred me to someone else. I kid you not I was on hold for over five minutes. I hung up and called back. I got the same guy and he did the same thing to me. Thats right you guest it, transfer to someone else. I will not call them or visit them ever again. The last time I dinned in they had flies in the window of the booth I was sitting in. I filled out the survey from the recite and never heard from anyone. Stay clear of this restaurant!"
David F.,"Manteca, CA",22,36,19,2.0,11/1/2014,"Tonight is Halloween and a Friday night do, we expected it to be busy at Applebee's.  We were greeted by the hostest who told us they are short on servers and it would be a ten minute wait. We actually expected to wait longer for a Friday night.  Within 10 mins we got our seat. We were sitting right below a blaring speaker and could not hear each other talk over the music. We got up and moved our seat with no problems.  My wife and I ordered our drinks and an appetizer. We waited over 10 mins to get our drinks and probably only got them because we had to ask for them again. We ordered a sampler plater as an appetizer. And didn't wait very long for it to arrive to our table. When we got the sampler plater we ordered our dinner. My wife other editors a chicken sandwich and I a mushroom Swiss burger. I asked for my burger to be cooked medium rare. We noticed customers who came in much later than us order and get their food before us. After waiting nearly an hour, we asked about our good. A server, who was not our server, brought us our food. The sandwiches were cold, fries tasted cold, stale and over salted. My burger was not medium rare. It was WELL done and burned on the ends.  This trip to Applebee's was disappointing because we are usually happy with the food and service. This won't deter us from going back because we do like eating there."
Lily I.,"Manteca, CA",173,5,,5.0,10/8/2015,Me and my boyfriend come here ALL the time and we've never been disappointed! Tonight we came in and our food didn't come cooked right and the manager addressed it right away. Along with the server. the manager was amazing for addressing the issue head on! We love this place. We come here for drinks and apps and the 2 for 20! We come almost once a week! We love this place
Deb H.,"Bend, OR",7,79,5,4.0,12/28/2014,"Pretty good for an Applebee's!  We went here with a very large group, and received great service and decent food, for a very reasonable price."
Mario B.,"Manteca, CA",0,5,,3.0,6/20/2015,Could be better. Not impressed with my food. Seems like it's not as good as it used to be. Wonder what the difference is?
Tony J.,"Oakdale, CA",4,42,14,5.0,2/15/2014,"We were looking for a familiar place to have a late lunch today and chose Applebee's. Wife had the Tequila Chicken and Shrimp, I had the Chicken Tenders Platter. Both items were fresh and delicious. Ample portions and hot. Service was fast, friendly and courteous. We picked the right spot for lunch.  Thank you!"
Cindy W.,"Manteca, CA",0,4,,5.0,4/26/2015,Won ton tacos with David!  Gabe is an awesome bartender!  We're here often and he waits on us the majority of the time!
Chris F.,"Gardnerville, NV",35,14,6,1.0,2/22/2015,Been to many of these restaurants for travel and this is the worst bad service food never cooked right and as I stay in town for four days  I try a different meal each night and never cooked  right . out of popular beers most of the time I have visited  if I was a manager here I would be looking for a new job.
Courtney R.,"Modesto, CA",3,65,5,1.0,9/2/2014,The service here is always bad. The food is consistently pretty good but the young staff here seem to always have an attitude. It's a shame.
Luke S.,"San Mateo, CA",477,1211,,1.0,6/28/2013,What happened to bingo night? ?
Calisse G.,"Manteca, CA",191,17,3,4.0,9/10/2014,"My dad  and I come here all the time and always get great service. Happy hour is the best deal, and don't get the new ""all you can eat ribs"" they are kind of gross. Other than that, good place."
