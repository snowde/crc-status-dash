Cecylia R.,"San Francisco, CA",12,12,9,5.0,5/27/2014,Great service from Kris ! Food is good and price is so low. Check out the late night drinks discounts.
Renee C.,"Manteca, CA",123,132,278,3.0,5/27/2013,The drinks are very good... If you drink enough the foods alright too!!!  Actually the tortilla soup is very good paired with the mango Long Island.
Robert H.,"Manteca, CA",32,3,,1.0,1/23/2016,Okay. If I could give negative rating I would.  Tried to make an order online and got to the end and it told me that it would not be able to take it and call the restaurant. Great. Spent 10 minutes. Called the restaurant and they put me on hold for over 10 minutes. What a great way to do business. Thanks for ruining my night.
Brett P.,"San Jose, CA",29,60,3,1.0,6/3/2012,"Cold food, rude hostess, rude waiter, took forever to even get someone to pay attention to our table. Look at the other 1-star reviews, and see that my complaint is definitely valid. Screw this place. Never again. Ever."
Gina K.,"Manteca, CA",3,40,32,3.0,9/19/2015,"Wait to be seated was a little ridiculous. Saturday night at 6pm, full lobby but several open tables??? Obviously bad scheduling. Was a little worried that it would only get worse once we were seated, but we were lucky enough to have Sara as our waitress. She was very attentive. Never went with an empty drink. Food was fast and good"
Ethan B.,"Manteca, CA",6,7,2,5.0,12/19/2014,"I love this Restaurant! Applebee's has good food and good service. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for tasty Burgers, Ribs & Fish and great beer."
Shelly M.,"Shasta Lake, CA",14,17,3,3.0,5/8/2015,Food and service are always really good here but they're always understaffed. Every time we've come to Manteca Applebee's there's all these open tables they never use because they don't have enough servers.
Jessica M.,"Tracy, CA",4,18,10,3.0,4/4/2014,"Waitress was great, friendly and quick. Pasta was cold, no cherry on my sundae shooter which is just wrong. Maybe the kitchen could use some motivation"
Michelle S.,"Manteca, CA",2,205,,1.0,3/9/2014,"Absolutely terrible. I felt like they served us leftover food! I honestly couldn't believe it. Our spinach artichoke dip was a disaster, served with stale dark looking chips. It tasted old! Our pasta was dry and cold too! The bread was stale. The Chicken looked like dog food. I will never come back! What happened to the quality of Applebee's? How can you screw up chain uniformed food?! The servers seemed nice, but whatever is going on in the back of the kitchen needs to be investigated!"
Monica A.,"Plano, TX",0,24,,1.0,2/14/2014,"This place is not clean. I came in on a Saturday about 3:30-4 pm. The front doors were so dirty I was shocked.  The restroom was just as bad if not worse. No supplies, dirty sinks, mirrors and stalls.  Would have thought the place would have been being cleaned for Saturday evening customers. And there were homeless peeps sitting on bench outside front door. This place has really gone downhill. Won't be returning."
Robert S.,"Manteca, CA",12,19,1,1.0,8/19/2014,Had the Napa Chicken and Portobello this past Saturday. Don't know if they ran out of the things that were suppose to be on it or new cook didn't know. It was tasteless. It only had an enormous pile of soggy white onions and what appeared to be canned chopped mushrooms. I don't believe there was any wine sauce. I didn't see any red onions or peppers.
Dona V.,"Modesto, CA",10,15,21,4.0,3/31/2014,"I love this place! I go in all the time and pick up for lunches. The best soup is enchilada soup! Im giving them a four star this time only because when I received my food, it was not up to par. My Enchilada soup had fatty chicken skin in it. I have never had that problem before! Ill go back but if I get the soup like that again I will have to stop ordering it."
Vivian C.,"Tracy, CA",10,10,2,2.0,6/11/2014,"We have gone to a lot of Applebee's expecting the same quality of food and service and this Applebee's was definitely a disappointment. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and the chips were soggy and stale. When we told the waitress about it, they replaced but charged us extra on our bill. I do not think I will be coming back to the Manteca Applebee's again!"
Greg T.,"Manteca, CA",143,39,6,2.0,11/6/2013,"We ate here last week. Ordered a apitieser, salad and meal. When wqiter came back he had out apitieser and salads at same time. I had 2 bites of my salad and he brought our entres. He looked at me and said. Do you want mecto put these under the warmer till yiur done with salads. You got to be kidding me."
A A.,"Manteca, CA",1,16,14,5.0,9/21/2015,9-17-15: Came in around 8 o clock to eat. Our waitress was Merry Y & she was very attentive. The place was slammed & we didn't end up getting out until around 9:30 but that was okay because we never felt rushed to leave & all the food was perfect. The manager was walking around checking everything & who ever ran our food to us was nice & made sure we were okay. Merry was friendly and always made sure we had everything we wanted. We will be back to this apple bees no doubt.
Julie T.,"Manteca, CA",16,44,24,1.0,3/6/2014,Food is way overpriced for the quality & quantity!!!! Never again... I have tried applebee's on more than one occasion and it just is not worth the price you pay for a meal.  Good for some beer during happy hour and that's it!
Raymond G.,"Anaheim, CA",0,7,,5.0,5/25/2014,"My wife and I had dinner here on 5-18-14,and as usual a great meal .Top that off with excellent service and you get another great night at AppleeBees.One of our favorite places to eat,as always the service and food is great!!"
Julie N Mike S.,"Manteca, CA",0,2,6,1.0,2/17/2014,"Took 35 min to get a salad. Service was terrible, I told waitress chicken was dry and she said oh and walked away! Manager did nothing to help. Will not come back!"
Maira M.,"Stockton, CA",2,2,,1.0,10/7/2013,"The drinks are good, some food is alright. But the service is horrible, I've been there twice hoping the experience would be different. The service is really bad, our server had an attitude with my table and we hardly called her over, but when I did she saw and just walked away. Second time, they didn't even put a to-go order in which we had requested when we first got there. I am no picky person but I don't recommend this Applebee's!"
Robert K.,"Manteca, CA",0,23,,2.0,8/1/2015,"If you want to go to a mediocre franchise that is heavily marketed to maximize profit, you've found the right place.  Prices are high, food is moderately reasonable, and you are ushered in and out quickly.  Not sure why Manteca struggles so with quality dining?  I've been several times.  The meals are consistently about the same, like a cookie cutter, and nothing to write home about.  Two stars.  I may go back, only because Manteca really has little to offer."
