Leeah H.,"Marysville, WA",0,2,,3.0,8/8/2017,"Just moved to Marysville and I wanted to try out the Applebee's and everything was pretty great BUT the food. I ordered a basic burger with nothing but lettuce and the burger was just absolutely dry and bland with  NO taste to it. It wasn't even a burger patty--just meat mushed together. I couldn't even finish it. And the fries were terrible. So much salt.  The only reason I gave 3 stars is because they did address the issue, and they made me a new burger and fries and took $10 dollars off the bill. Probably won't be coming back though."
Diane H.,"Arlington, WA",16,5,,2.0,1/1/2018,"While the service was good , our waitress was efficient , she got a simple burger order wrong , our food was on the cold side . She didn't give us our bill but instead had us use the table toy thingy , we weren't charged for the simple burger but the wrong burger they sent to our table . Very disappointed and most likely will not return"
Pinn S.,"Santa Barbara, CA",62,39,74,3.0,6/12/2017,"Got there super late at night and ordered 8 bone-in buffalo wings. The place was 80% packed, but by the time we could decide what to order, the place was half empty. It took about half an hour for my wings to arrive, a bit room temperature, so I guess they were sitting out for a while."
Nina M.,"Seattle, WA",54,53,91,4.0,8/29/2017,Ask for the guy with the sweet Asian ass or the sexy guy working the bar. He goes by the name of Adam. He'll show you a good time
Komal G.,"Marysville, WA",104,1,,4.0,11/4/2017,"I came here for my first ever date and it went very good. The food was delicious, the employees were super nice, and the place was really clean. Would recommend!"
Gavin C.,"Arlington, WA",96,203,113,1.0,12/17/2016,"Decided to hit up Applebees on a Saturday. We were sat fairly quickly. We received our food and I asked for some sauce for my burger, I never received the sauce and our ice teas took forever to be refilled.  When our bill came, the server offered dessert and then remembered that she had to mention the gift card purchase to avoid giving away a free dessert. This came across line she was just checking a box. Did not come across natural.  With all the new restaurants opening up around Arlington/Marysville, I'd suggest a little better service from Applebees."
Sally J Neiland N.,"Marysville, WA",20,9,7,3.0,9/30/2017,"Service today was lacking. Not busy. Food was typical Applebees, as to be expected. Good salads and appetizers. Service was off. Had to ask for essentials, salt, pepper, napkins and refills. Not typical. I am sure we will be back sometime despite the service. Our dirty dishes sat for 15 minutes until we closed out and left. Never picked.up."
Kay M.,"Forest Grove, OR",1,26,3,5.0,8/7/2017,"Excellent customer service from Sandy. She shows respect, goes the extra mile. Excellent food. She treats everyone with great service. The manager came by and was very gracious and made sure all is well at our table. Definitely recommend this Applebee's."
Kelly W.,"Lake Stevens, WA",60,2,,5.0,8/23/2017,"I visit this location 1 or 2 times a week after work, after many visits I felt compelled to write a review. The bartender, Oz is absolutely amazing. No matter how busy he is he always has a smile on his face. I've tried to recruit him many times, I'd love to have him working in my restaurant."
Jace S.,"Vancouver, WA",7,8,15,1.0,7/25/2017,Worst service ever! I placed an online order. When I arrived I went in the car side to go door to pick up and was greeted quickly from someone who told me they would send someone out with my food in a minute. I went between the two doors (staying in the a/c) and waited. An employee walked by me twice and did not even acknowledge me. About 10 minutes later I went back in and told them to just cancel the order (it should have been ready 20 minutes prior). The employee seemed surprised that I would just cancel and when I told her about just standing there waiting while another employee walked by me more than once it suddenly became my daughter because she did not know why I was standing there. Customer service 101 is to acknowledge and simply look up and ask me. Worst experience. On a side note it was a simple order of a salad and soda.
Steve M.,"Clarkston, WA",16,61,6,5.0,1/24/2017,"I don't normally go to an Applebee's, but this one was close to the Holiday Inn Express, and I wanted to walk. The meal was great, the staff was attentive and friendly, and the experience very positive.  Hands down the best Applebee's I have been to in a decade.   I had a 6oz steak, and it was really great.  The broccoli and green beans were cooked perfectly, not overdone.   Really a good experience."
Daniel K.,"Marysville, WA",25,120,83,1.0,4/10/2016,"Standard American Hamburger= overcooked bacon, burnt tasteless hamburger and disgusting processed cheese. Honestly one of the worst burgers I've even tasted.  Kids Mac n cheese, pathetic. Literally Kraft Mac n Cheese from the box. Only difference is they charge you $5 for it.  Applebee's takes no pride in their menu, the food is almost inedible."
Carla R.,"Marysville, WA",260,12,4,5.0,6/27/2017,"Oz is a gift from God. His ability to keep my beer glass full, my appetite satiated and a smile on my face is impeccable. If they gave report cards for bartenders, he would get an A+! So since they don't, I will give him a 5 star Yelp review. If loving Oz is wrong, I don't wanna be right. God bless Turkey."
Travis P.,"Lynnwood, WA",109,9,19,1.0,2/19/2017,"I am literally pulling out of the parking lot as I am writing this review because I feel like our dining experience was that bad...  Poor service, poor food...  Bottom line, they should not be in business.  3 out of the past 4 trips have been terrible.   Save your family the trouble of a ruined evening...."
Roads O.,"Lynnwood, WA",93,18,12,1.0,8/10/2017,their pick up service is a fucking joke! waited 28 mins for our food! when we were told 15 mins and the parking lot was empty!!
Wayne K.,"Washington, DC",0,1,,1.0,3/27/2017,"Racist, of the highest level directed towards native Americans, its on a res. My friend ordered 2 shots of evan williams, sunday evening  march 16th around 8pm . A bald guy broughr out a dirty glass for rhe bartender to serve my drink in. And he did. He even looked at it and made sure i got the nasty one. My friend is white and i was just telling him how disgustingly racist they are here. Pathetic, they should both be fired."
Davide M.,"Marysville, WA",168,1,,5.0,3/25/2017,"If you are a fan of the Bee, you're not gonna be disappointed from eating here. Totally in line with Applebee's standards. And quite frankly, amazing value for money and way above standards for a commercial casual dining chain."
Daniel T.,"Marysville, WA",67,1,,1.0,3/3/2017,"They forgot my fries, gave small portion of ice cream, didn't refill my water. Just really disappointed on customer service. And this always happens in this location in Marysville."
Sasha S.,"Lake Stevens, WA",1,9,1,1.0,5/30/2017,"I've tried to curbside to go twice now and I won't be giving it a third try. The first time I ordered from here they forgot the chicken in my chicken Caesar salad.. Manager gave me a gift card to make amends so I decided to give it another try. I made it so that my order would be ready for pick up at 4:45. Im a pretty patient person so when it was 4:50 I still gave a few more minutes, mind you I was on my lunch break at work and didnt have all the time in the world. When it got to 4:55 I called inside and the girl that picked up the phone said that she was making drinks and hadnt looked up at the screen to see if any cars had come for curbside. REALLY?! So I didn't end up getting my food until 4:58 and then had to rush back to work and couldn't eat my food. Awesome."
Courtney S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",78,90,53,4.0,4/23/2016,Always had good service here and never had much of a wait to get a table.  Car side to go was great and fast too on this particular visit. Probably one of the better Applebee's ive been to but things can get slow for drink refills or getting your check if they are short staffed.
Kandie M.,"Lynnwood, WA",11,167,103,3.0,12/8/2015,"Came here last night with my boyfriend. We waited 5 minutes before anyone greeted us.  When we sat down, we waited ten minutes before anyone came over. Our server had a very interesting personality.  I definitely won't be coming back.  Noone here smiles, and the customer service really is lacking.  The food I had was good, my boyfriends was very dry. He had to smother it in ranch just to eat it.  Idk.... Wasn't impressed.  We came on a Monday night so not sure why the service was sooo slow."
Shelly P.,"Snohomish, WA",0,1,,1.0,2/25/2016,We sat at the table for 20 minutes before a lady noticed we were there. She told us she would let our waiter know we were there. Then our waiter brought our check and we were not even half done with our food. He assumed we didn't want any dessert. He also never refilled our water. Food was great Jared was bad!!!!
Krystal S.,"Palmdale, CA",0,19,1,1.0,4/3/2015,"Similar complaint. I received chicken that was raw in the center. Not only did the waiter joke around about the issue, he had the audacity to offer a ""hot fudge sundae-because it's not cooked"".  The waitress who followed didn't even address the issue and we never saw a manager. The entree was comped but the way it was handled and our experience will prevent our return.  One star isn't deserved. I should have yelped this location before I went."
Monica S.,"Stanwood, WA",0,16,,5.0,1/11/2017,"This is my second time eating at this Applebee's in a month. This Applebee's in Marysville has been wonderful. We were seated very quickly and the food is wonderful, the service is excellent and the atmosphere is really comfortable and clean.  Our server, Kelsie, had wonderful suggestions and was very pleasant and friendly and she was right there with refills on our beverages.  We would definitely return again. I am pleased because in the past I have been to several other Applebee's locations and the service and food was terrible."
JV E.,"Marysville, WA",110,42,6,2.0,3/14/2015,"They dished out my potatoes and veggies first without my steak. Waited 10 more minutes then asked my waiter about the steak. He didn't admit it, but I'm pretty sure he forgot to put in the order for my actual steak. Waited another 15 for it, but had to send my potatoes and veggies back because they were already cold and hard. He apologized and brought a fresh batch within minutes.  Super slow, unorganized, but the servers are actually very kind. To be fair, the place was quite busy, but the servers either have great poker faces under stress or they didn't feel the need to hustle around a little bit. Not sure if I'll be heading back here anytime soon."
Amanda R.,"Marysville, WA",1,10,,4.0,6/12/2016,"First time in Applebee's in a few years. Was curious about the changes in the make over and I'm impressed. The cocktails and appetizers are tasty and the new additions are ever so tempting. Definitely not the Applebee's I remembered and partially loathed. Well done, Applebee's!"
Cree C.,"Everett, WA",0,12,,1.0,8/31/2016,On a wenesday at 6pm me and my husband went here to celebrate his new job at a law firm we experienced really bad service with the bartender. We walked in and there was no clean tables we politely asked if she could have someone clean one for us to sit she became really rude and attitudey. Our server finally came with menus 30 minutes later. We then ordered two drinks and an appetizer of mozzarella sticks which took 50 minutes to bring out the bartender has a no care attitude and really nonchalant. I'm never going here again
Jody D.,"Stanwood, WA",0,7,,1.0,4/28/2016,So I came into tonight and new menus of course and all the prices went up $2.00 to $ 4.00 depending on the item. Chinese chicken salad is $11.99 seriously this is not the Hyatt or Marriott menus . This caliber of eatery should be $7.00 to $9.00 at the most. They have just lost another customer . Also the menu is all Garlic this and that yuk Mom had fish and chips cooked to death and her baked potato is even bad. Don't go here!
Catherian X.,"North Vancouver, Canada",1,9,6,4.0,3/11/2016,"Been here twice , servers are very friendly , we got helped right away , we ordered 20 dollar for 2 deal . Very tasty and will come back again for sure . They have some new taste love them ."
Chris C.,"Marysville, WA",9,3,2,1.0,11/2/2015,"We will not be returning. I took my family here tonight. The server was pleasant, but the cooks weren't. My kids ordered the mini cheeseburgers,and one theirs were pink on the inside,so I showed manager, so, they brought one back to him, him being a child knew he needed two, cause obviously they were both pink, being they were cooked at the same time. I ordered the American brunch burger pink, mine came to me, med well and the egg was cooked to death, they re cooked the egg, but it was just a little better, I told manager, my 8 yr old could grill a egg sunny side up, they need to hire new cooks, if their not competent enough to grill a egg properly. On top of that, the lady who brought me the burger had a lousy attitude. Then with all the mess ups, we still had to pay full price, no comp desserts, nada! We will not be returning."
Jody W.,"Marysville, WA",21,41,66,1.0,4/1/2015,This place isn't even worthy of 1 star! The last few times we went our steak was cold full of gristle the waiter forgot to bring our sides we asked him several times for different sauces and he forgot twice he was more interested in balancing a chair on his forehead trying to impress some teenage boys that were there. also and never go there on Monday night to play trivia the gal that runs it works in the bar and she brings her boyfriend everyweek and their team wins 90% of the time. He shouldn't even be playing. This place is horrible. Never going back. Definitely a huge thumbs down.
James M.,"Seattle, WA",297,6,1,5.0,12/24/2015,"We stopped in at Applebee's after doing our holiday shopping for a drink. We had delicious food served hot, and great bloody Mary's.  The best part of our Christmas break  was our waiter Steve he's awesome.   Merry Christmas."
Amy W.,"Seattle, WA",118,341,66,2.0,1/6/2013,"I and one other were seated in the bar area, half of those tables were filled and no one at the actual bar, so it can't be that busy, but what do I know. I had the appetizer sampler, it was okay, but I could have sworn the chips should have been warm, whatever, it's only chips. The cheese sticks weren't warm enough so the cheese wasn't ""cheesy"". The chicken was more fried skin than meat. At least they got the celery sticks right. Why I'm bring it down to 2 starts instead of the ok-3: First off, why is it soo hard to get water or the check when it wasn't crowded like I started off with in this review."
Emily w.,"Granite Falls, WA",0,9,,4.0,8/20/2016,"Yummy chicken Caesar salad, Thai shrimp salad and fish and chips...Elijah was a great waiter.  The menu offers less options, but the food was better than the last time we visited a couple of years ago.  Appreciated the low calorie options."
K V.,"Marysville, WA",0,1,,1.0,6/18/2016,The food was good but the service was super slow! We waited longer an hour for our order!
Philip S.,"Marysville, WA",101,15,2,1.0,4/14/2015,Horrible service ill never return inexcusable ...here is a tip don't assume someone can't afford something ......
Kate D.,"Arlington, WA",0,13,,3.0,7/3/2016,"The service started slow, but got better throughout the meal.  Waitress became very attentive at the end of the meal.  I was super happy to see one of my favorites on the happy hour menu, so I ordered that and a green goddess salad.  My food was good, the fries were a bit salty (with me, that is saying something since I love salt). My fiance's food was pretty good.   The reason for the 3 stars...we ordered a cheeseburger egg roll appetizer and for 9 dollars, we got 2 eggrolls.  They were okay, but way too pricey for what we got.  Plus, he added a side salad to his burger.  4 dollars for a handful of lettuce and some toppings.  I remember the salads used to come in a bowl, and that was worth the price.  Salad shrunk by more than half and price doubled.  Then, my fiance was sick to his stomach within an hour of eating.  I tried some of his burger, which tasted good.  So who knows if it was the food?  Anyway, overall, pretty good."
Angela M.,"Marysville, WA",0,5,,2.0,4/28/2015,"I ordered dinner online from the Marysville, WA Applebee's. My son picked up our order from Carside To Go. The kids' orders were fine. I ordered a 7 oz sirloin MEDIUM RARE with garlic mashed potatoes and vegetables. What I got was a MEDIUM WELL 7 oz sirloin with garlic mashed, and NO vegetables. Applebee's is usually better than this. Tonight was disappointing!"
Sarah B.,"Stanwood, WA",15,24,3,1.0,2/8/2016,"I really wish there was a way to give 0 stars.  This was by far the worst dining experience we have had.  Superbowl Sunday..so as you would expect it was not busy in the restaurant. There were plenty of staff working, but we seemed to be ignored at every turn.  We waited 10 minutes before anyone greeted us at the door, 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged our presence at a table, and another 15 before out drinks came out. Finally drinks came out. Ordered food, another 20 minute wait. Then Ashley our waitress starts bringing out our kids dinners. While trying to set our sons dinner on the table, she spilled an entire glass of strawberry lemonade on our table...most of which landed right in my husbands lap..running off the table in EVERY direction, also getting our 5 yr olds pants.  She apologizes, hands him a single napkin, and then leaves to continue to bring more kids food out.  A SINGLE NAPKIN to clean up soaking wet pants and a dripping table.  We had to ask another server for a towel so hubby could clean his pants off. They were literally dripping wet. Kids food was all looked ok.15 minutes later my husband and my food came out. Our kids were done eating before we even got our food. I ordered the shrimp/parm/steak medium well with mash potatoes and veggies.  One end of my steak was practically mooing, and the other end was burnt.  Not sure if they get the concept of medium well....it was nasty and hard to eat...especially since only the 1/3 in the middle was done right. Potatoes were cold in the middle, and rock hard on the outside like they had been sitting under the warming light all day.  Hubby had a rack of ribs and fries. Fries were so cold they felt frozen, no seasoning.  As we were finishing up our meal, the waitress offered my husband a free little glass of chocolate mousse to apologize for the spilling the drink. I am pretty sure my mouth literally fell open, because she then went to get the manager that approved a 10% discount on our bill.  Still very insulting considering EVERYONES dinner was ruined, my son and husband were both wet and our food was terrible.  When we got the bill, all they did was put the 10% discount on my dinner (the less expensive of the 2 adult meals.  For our $75 dinner we got drenched, horrible food, and insulted. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE!"
Stefani B.,"Marysville, WA",12,29,17,5.0,5/23/2015,"I stopped in for a quick bite and refreshment sat up at the bar and watched some baseball . The bartender was very friendly and attentive , I asked her to create me a light fruity drink , she did and it was perfect ! Not sure of what to order want to keep it very small she suggested Kobe meatballs and brisket sliders both for 9.99 , perfect small portions the sliders were amazing a wee bit of heat and tang with little pineapple tidbits and succulent brisket , bun nice and soft . Meatballs tender with a nice tomato sauce ! Taking 3 meatballs home even what a great value and superb flavor ! Impressive food and service and I am very critical of service but I will tip  my hat to my experience here today !  Thank you Kristi"
