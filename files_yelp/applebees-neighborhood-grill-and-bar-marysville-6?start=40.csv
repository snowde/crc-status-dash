G H.,"Lake Stevens, WA",0,25,,1.0,7/29/2015,"I got my 2nd glass of wine AFTER I asked to speak to the manager...after asking my server for it...twice. They were only about 2/3 full, so it wasn't that the bar staff didn't have time to DO THEIR JOBS between chatting with each other. The manager was so embarrassed, he comp'd our meal (seems to be a lot of that going around lately). He said he can't fire the lousy staff without a lengthy process. So if you dare to go in...be prepared to be disappointed. And...my steak was rubber."
Sean D.,"Vancouver, Canada",4,43,9,5.0,4/11/2015,"I would give the food 4 stars.. But the staff was SOOO nice that I have to give them 5 starts.. We came in with our little girl and everybody was so nice to her! I would definitely come back here again if I am around! Amazing staff! Keep up the good work! Our servers name was Nicole, but all the staff was great tonight!"
Ginger A.,"Marysville, WA",0,17,24,1.0,12/22/2014,"I won't eat here after going with my husband. He likes it, I hate it. The final straw was the soup which I could have gotten better and cheaper from a Campbell's can and I can nuke a frozen veggie medley at home. Which I won't eat there either. It's sad, I do not remember it being like this when I had gone to the chain prior to one coming to Marysville. Does no one physically cut or prepare anything themselves anymore?"
Robyn N.,"Eleele, HI",1,3,,5.0,7/21/2015,"Last night at happy hour, we went there and had a pitcher of beer, chicken quesadilla app, pot sticker app, chicken wonton app,  brew pub philly and a maple bacon chicken piadini. It was the best food we've had at a restaurant plus the customer service was right on!!! Our server Casey A., along with Manager Jim Salud did an impeccable job with all their customers!!! We will definitely be going back for another happy hour or just a regular dine in!!"
Erica W.,"Lemon Grove, CA",13,14,1,2.0,9/23/2014,"The food and waitress were great. The reason I am only giving two stars is due to the unprofessionalism of I believe one of the managers. I think she was a manager because shr had on a pink shirt instead of a black one. While there were customers in the restaurant she was going around pulling decorations off of the walls. One of them, which was a snowboard, was halfway over my husband's head! Then to add to it, each item had four inch nails sticking out of them! Lastly, everytime she reach up to rip something out of the wall the bottom of her shirt came up all the way to her boobs! Purely unprofessional behavior. Wait until after hours to do that. A customer could get hit in the head or bump into the nails as you are walking by."
Chris J.,"Marysville, WA",34,33,1,2.0,10/17/2014,Slow service!!! They weren't even busy! They were constantly messing up orders! Not just mine but others. Worst service here ever. The food was good.
Tina G.,"Marysville, WA",52,66,1,1.0,8/29/2014,After waiting 15 minutes I flagged down someone to get a beer ..another 5 minutes another girl brought me water.   Then the beer came another 5 minutes after that. ... then she took my order. .. another 25 minutes and we have our food...  told the manager about the ridiculous wait and she tried to say they are busy... when there was no one here when we got here and after we ordered.... poor service with no compassion for them FN up.
Chad M.,"Marysville, WA",2,6,,1.0,12/9/2015,This place is garbage they pour Doubles here less then a normal shot it's so stupid and the mangers can give to fucks about anyone there they treat there staff like shit right in front of you the only thing they have going for them is there happy hour which is pretty good but other then that if you want crappy food and to be treated like shit it's the place for you
Corey W.,"Kure Beach, NC",8,48,8,2.0,4/26/2014,"What can I say... It's Applebee's on a Saturday. Service was horrible. Non existence server that we couldn't get a side of ranch from for the life of us and ended by charging too much for nachos. Food was ok, nothing special. It is what it always is but my wife likes a wrap they serve so that's why we came."
Kathryn N.,"Arlington, WA",47,184,60,4.0,2/19/2012,"So it's an applebee's, but for an applebee's it's pretty nice. My husband and I like to go for their late night happy hours. They have good local beers on tap, and I like the hot wings.  It is the kind of place you can bring an infant and a coupon to, so don't get to snobby, and you'll have a great time."
Ray P.,"Goldendale, WA",0,17,,4.0,8/15/2015,"Clean place, including the restrooms. Friendly staff, good with my kids. Food was good. Siracha shrimp app was really tasty."
Bill G.,"Marysville, WA",0,16,,3.0,1/16/2016,"sit at the bar, sit at the bar, sit at the bar.  if you want quicker service just sit at the bar, I always see a crowd waiting to be seated and walk right past them every time to go and seat myself at the bar immediately , I'm finishing dinner and walking out when their barely sitting down even on the busiest of days.  you get what you pay for, when you order a 10 buck steak remember its a 10 dollar steak.  play it safe and order bar food, burger, blt, apps, itll be ok."
S J.,"Soap Lake, WA",0,13,,5.0,9/11/2015,"Had  server named Dean, he was great. Really appreciated his service with special requests even thought it was dinner time on a Friday night and they were busy! Really no vegatarian options ( even the salads have bacon) and he made 1 for my daughter."
Sergey A.,"Marysville, WA",0,17,55,2.0,9/6/2009,"I'll give *** for food, but only * for service. Food was really good, but service was, well let say needs to be worked on, forgot to bring silverware then salad and when food was brought burger was still really red inside ( was asked for no pink ), had to ask to refill our drinks, seemed like waitress was not paying any attention. I'll give them second chance next time. I'll comment then."
Mo M.,"Seattle, WA",113,144,843,1.0,6/29/2013,"Gift card needed to be utilized. Dammit all. Tips for this Applebee's location: - Have a manager on duty. Like, physically in the building. - Train the staff to check on customers and give them hydration, like water. - Require the staff to say hello and even thank you, and KNOW THE MENU. - Explain to the servers they may want to check on and care for customers that are not their drunk friends at the tables around the strangers. - Teach the little aproned ones to write down orders so they get it correct. - Advise the minions that mistakenly deliver your food to another group that it is unsanitary to deliver such food to two tables after it has been touched. - Hire a jobless human to clean the disgusting sticky menus and condiments at the little stands on each table, they are ALWAYS FILTHY and dogeared.  - Stop brining your meats in salt solution so it lasts longer and saves you money. - Remove the dangerous preservatives, like sodium nitrite and MSG from all your sauces and dressings. Hello reaction! Oh, what the hell, hire a new manager or staffers who care about your brand and customers in general. Tips for yelpers:  Re-gift those gift cards.  Avoid unless drunk, underage and desperate on I-5. Those rumors about careless corporate suburban fare hold true in this location."
Jessica P.,"Menifee, CA",308,14,1,1.0,2/7/2014,"Every TIME I come here, the food is terrible, the service is never right. I have food allergies and every time they can't get my order right. I flat out WILL NOT come to this applebee's EVEN THOUGH it's my favorite restaurant. I will drive out of my way and go to the one in Everett, which so far has been great."
Melanie G.,"Bothell, WA",44,4,,1.0,5/2/2013,"Well, I've never been so compelled to write a bad review for a place. Our food was decent to say the least and I would be stretching it if I said that. I'm actually considering vomiting to rid my body of the disgusting food. My chicken and shrimp cajun plate actually resembled by taste, texture, smell, and appearence, airplane food. If I were to order this on a plane I would expect it to be exactly like this, no better, no worse."
Sean K.,"Marysville, WA",11,4,,1.0,5/16/2014,Every time I give this place a chance they never fail to disappoint. From forgetting appetizers to never coming back and checking on how food is. I hate this franchise chain. I won't come back and finally felt I needed to post a review. Terrible management and staff.
Kenneth H.,"Marysville, WA",0,11,,1.0,4/16/2015,"So tonight my wife and i went to Applebee's, we were greeted by a friendly hostess and that is were it ended.  We were seated promptly and i think we were greeted by the MOD also.  After being seated we waited for 15mintues for a server and nothing happened.  The guy who i think was the MOD kept looking at us and was giving me the ""One Minute"" nod like i will be right there and the girl who was the waitress was clearly not busy kinda acknowledged us but went in the back. So after 15 minutes of waiting we walked out and do you think they tried to stop me and keep me as a customer?  Nope the guy waved as i walked out. If you are the manager and reading this.  HOLD TRAINING WITH YOUR STAFF!  Horrible service and i wish i could tell you about the food but never got served.  If you are the manager and would like more info contact me and i will give you more detail's.  But i am not holding my breath after tonight.   360-813-8324"
Michelle W.,"Marysville, WA",11,131,17,5.0,7/5/2013,"Third time at Marysville Applebee's, and our experience was excellent!  Restoration time for this Applebee's location has come at last! Our wait was but a few minutes. Both mango and kiwi lemonades were excellent. Loved the French onion soup. Steak and a wedge salad were tasty, as were both the hot fudge sundae and yummy cookie sundae for dessert. Spent $50 without the tip for the two of us. Food came promptly. Michelle was our attentive server. I highly recommend Applebee's Marysville!"
