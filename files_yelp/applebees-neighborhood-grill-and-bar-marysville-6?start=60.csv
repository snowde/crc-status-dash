Cathy R.,"Lake Stevens, WA",24,9,12,1.0,12/24/2013,"We went during happy hour. After having owned a restaurant ourselves we could tell that the appetizers were fried in old oil.  It tasted it too.  We ordered two Long Island ice teas and had to send them back because they were so bitter.  There was no apology from the waitress, or offer to replace, just a ""Ok, I'll take them back.""  We left quickly and will never go back.  We did visit the Applebee's in Everett, WA and were very pleased at the difference."
Ron G.,"Everett, WA",4,30,5,1.0,12/10/2014,"Pretty bad experience. Poor, disorganized service, messed up orders and a manager that didn't do much about it when my order finally came 10 minutes after everyone else had eaten."
Patrick H.,"Marysville, WA",12,7,,1.0,8/2/2014,Food is comparable to airplane food. The bar keeps this place alive. Wish we had better restaurants in this town.
barry h.,"Marysville, WA",45,10,,4.0,5/31/2011,"This Applebees seems to have picked up a notch or two over the past year. I would have rated it a 2 or 3 in early 2010, but in 2011 the staff seems to be working in unison better and the food quality has gone up.  I suspect that were some behind-the-scenes changes that caused this (and I have no idea what they were), but the front-end facing side of the business is running much smoother."
Kristin B.,"Snohomish County, WA",228,367,26,1.0,4/14/2010,"Maybe not ALL Applebees are as bad as this one but come on folks...lets step it up a bit to do well for your customers. My husband asked for 3 different things before they finally had something ""in"" that day that he wanted to order. My Weight Watchers fish thingy was grey, tasteless and overall DISGUSTING. I ended up taking my leftover out into the parking lot and running them over with my car. After all of this, we both go sick the next day...most likely from the nasty food we were served at this horrible restaurant. Save your money folks and go eat at 7-11 across the street."
Fatima N.,"Kirkland, WA",0,20,,1.0,4/13/2014,"I have always liked Applebees and sent for their gummy martini. When we for there, the hospeda had a hole on the hip area of her pants and the restaurant was dirty, food all over the floor, the staff had their shirts half tucked in, etc. When I received my drink, it did not have te gummy worm that comes in it. My husband asked the waitress if the drink came with a gummy worm and the response was, ""I can't really see and the only way for me to tell is by sticking my finger in it and I can't because I am on shift. They may not have any gummy worms left."" We then asked for her recommendation on the quesadilla burger or ribs and she said that the burger was terrible and she didn't know what the ribs because she cannot get herself to eat ribs. When I asked her about the chicken penne with sundries tomatoes, she didn't know because she hadn't tried it. Then I ordered an ultimate trio, where the buffalo wings looked like they had been sitting out for a while and the pretzel looked like it has been warmed up in a microwave. The waitress had asked me if I wanted ranch or blue cheese, I am not certain why because she never brought it. The food and service were Terrible. I am writing this review for the ownership because if I were the owner, I'd want to know why I may be loosing customers."
Catherine F.,"Marysville, WA",0,42,,5.0,2/9/2014,"I like the food here. I especially like that they label the menu so well that you can find many low calorie selections that are great! The service is always friendly. They also have a ""take away"" service for when you want to eat those messy ribs at home in front of a good movie. Take away parking makes it very convenient and they actually bring the food out to your car. Ask what the total is going to be over the phone when you order. That way you can avoid waiting for change."
Alexander L.,"Marysville, WA",0,7,,4.0,11/11/2014,"They finally decided to remodel this place and it actually looks nice now. The food is good just like any other Applebee's, My favorite is the bbq ribs. But the service is slow, we always wait a while to get our table."
Jasmine L.,"Marysville, WA",0,1,,1.0,9/20/2014,"My boyfriend and I went on a date here today and I personally did not like it. It took forever just for us to get an appetizer and after we had finished that it took almost 45 minutes for us to be served our meals. I ordered a classic burger without onions. I also asked for it to be pink since the menu itself said they would be pink if you wished it that way. When I had finally gotten my meal the burger was burnt, and cold on top of that. There was no pink and the waitress did nothing about it when I said that it was supposed to be pink. There were very few people dining at the time yet we were barely spoken to or even acknowledged by anyone other than the hottest. My boyfriend on the other hand had s good experience aside from the wait. I may give this place another chance sometime in the future, but not anytime soon."
Jeremy F.,"Marysville, WA",6,46,11,3.0,12/16/2012,"My food was good but my wife's not so much. Her mushrooms and chick were cold and it took a while to come out. The service is good, but the temperature in the restaurant is colder then what it should be. Overall an ok experience."
Quita J.,"Cordova, TN",13,87,16,4.0,5/19/2012,"I used the ""to go"". It didn't take long at all on a Friday night. Employees are friendly."
jin b.,"Marysville, WA",2,19,28,1.0,5/5/2012,If I could give a negative review I would.  The food was terrible!  The ribs were of a kind I have never seen.  The bones were like shoulder blades.  I've never eaten dog meat but it tasted like I imagine dog would. YUCK!
Cristelle J.,"San Francisco, CA",173,226,20,3.0,2/23/2009,I went here a lot with my friends after we got off from work or from school at EVCC!!! (holler at a scholar!)  I love the happy hour special.....cheap good food. I like it!  One time we got our food for free including desert because they took a long time but we really didn't notice so I like them even more!!!
Kimberley P.,"Marysville, WA",46,9,1,3.0,5/22/2011,"Pretty stingy with the fries. An order of onion rings meant 4 onion rings. Burgers are great and cheap on mondays. Service is ok, but not great."
M P.,"Everett, WA",0,23,,2.0,9/13/2010,Not so pleased...  The service has been poor on several occasions. The food is not great. Drinks are over priced.  Only go for half off the apps and drinks from 9pm on.  Otherwise not worth your time.
John S.,"CARLTON, WA",0,42,,1.0,11/9/2013,Absolute Vile spooge!! not fit for human consumption. You're better off eating out of the hot case at the truck stop. NASTY!!! needs to have a minus star.
Leigh Ann K.,"Coquitlam, Canada",6,43,,1.0,12/13/2010,"I had heard about Applebee's because of the 1/2 price apps at night.  We ate dinner here for the first time when we went down for a shopping weekend at the Premium Outlets (Tulalip).  The place was packed - but I'm really not sure why.  The food was so-so.  The service was not so great.  The greeters were not friendly and courteous.  I usually tip very well but not that night!  Our waitress was very ""matter of fact"" and did not know how to engage in friendly conversation (as most do).  She was not very good with kids.  She didn't come by often to refill drinks or to check on us and I felt she was rushing us quite a bit even though the line up at the door was gone.  I was not impressed.  Will definitely listen to the kids more often when they say they want to go to Red Robin (again!).  :)"
Jasmine M.,"Seattle, WA",242,393,123,4.0,7/25/2006,"This past Sunday was warm, and I do mean WARM. My daughter and I were headed up to Marysville to help a friend with his garage sale. Traffic northbound on I-5 was light and we got up to Marysville in record time. Coming off the freeway, I actually stared longingly at Applebee's knowing it would be much cooler inside then outside, and I waaaaaas hungry.  Now I've only ever eaten at the Applebee's in Southcenter, and that was a few years ago and I don't recall it being the best atmosphere and food. I also tend to stand out a bit (I like to make eyecontact and I say please and thank you) especially when it's hot and I'm wearing shorts and a tanktop (my tattoos become quite visible) but upon entering this location we were greeted by two young ladies who promptly sat us.  Shane, our server, came right over to offer beverages. I ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast and I've got to be honest and say it was delicious. By far one of the best chicken fried steaks I've ever had, with my eggs over medium perfectly. The child order a hamburger and inhaled her fries once they were a proper temp, she did eat the buger too. They had flavored lemonade and I liked the kiwi lemonade best, the berry medley was bit too sweet. We didn't get a chance to try the mango lemonade. A nice, lowkey dining experience in a chain restaurant that if given the chance I will dine at again."
Ronnie G.,"Miami, FL",10,14,,3.0,6/21/2012,good foor at a great price
Clarence J.,"Marysville, WA",1,12,,2.0,9/11/2010,the place is like any other applebees. the food was ok but shouldnt really expect much. i've been there several times and some were great and others not so much. I order the boneless buffalo wings and took a bite out of one of them and it was totally raw. ugh
