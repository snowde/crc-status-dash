Adam H.,"Loveland, OH",27,83,113,2.0,12/15/2017,"So.........let me be honest.  We can do that here, right?!  We arrived to a dead Applebee's on a Thursday night.  It took a couple of minutes for us to be recognized by someone to get seated.  Once we were greeted, we were taken to our table.   Our table that didn't have a light bulb in the fixture. C'mon, your gonna choose to put us at a table that obviously didn't have a light!?  I picked up our silverware and menus and moved to the next table.   There was plenty to choose from.   These older restaurants that still have carpet in them....yechh.   The old tired furniture.  So gross.   I honestly couldn't wait to get out.    The waitress was nice.   Other servers were milling about and talking loudly about their personal lives.  Let's say I heard a lot more than I wanted to.  Food was ""A"" grade for the establishment.   But for general purposes, it was a C+ at best.  I won't return to this Applebee's or any other."
Jess C.,"Cincinnati, OH",81,180,90,1.0,10/19/2017,"DO NOT GO HERE! Here's your warning along with a TON of other one star reviews.  If you are staying at one of the various hotels in the area, save yourself the sorry and go elsewhere.  Applebee's used to be the place to be but unfortunately they have declined greatly. This place is now for the sad and lonely hearted and people who have a gift card like me.  I tried to pay it safe with boneless wings and salad. Salad was overdressed and so were the wings not to mention one of my chicken wings was RAW inside!!! If you do have to come here and use GC, get a beer and drown your sorrows. Fries were good and probably the safest thing you can get on the menu.  This is your warning. This place is overdue for a major overhaul."
Kamyia F.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,5,2,2.0,12/28/2017,Came a Thursday night. We loved our SECOND waitress. She was super cool but our FIRST waitress was a little rude. Also the food took a very long time to get to us. Our fries and chips were stale. Overall we loved our waitress buttttt disappointed with our food. C- at most
Jason P.,"Monroe, OH",17,36,9,1.0,12/2/2017,Arrived at 440pm. Finally received our meal at 610pm. Apparently our food was given away and had to be remade. I ordered a chicken sandwich. It. could have been remade dozens of times.
Chris A.,"Phoenix, MD",12,69,1,2.0,4/7/2017,"Bad Bad Bad We are out of walked out as soon as we walked in, that is what my intuition told me. Next time I will listen. The front entrance was somewhat dirty, the hostess comes over and a very disheveled ponytail and hoodie. It wasn't that cold to want a hoodie. We got seated at a booth, and waited close to 10 minutes for our server. While he smiled, his demeanor was condescending. It's one of those ""you get what you pay for"" regarding the food quality. Bad. I got the shrimp on pasta and I think the pasta sauce was nothing more than velveeta with siracha sauce mixed in  Tonight? Tazikis!"
Danielle Q.,"Middletown, OH",0,3,6,1.0,10/11/2017,"Service here is terrible, some of the workers need an attitude adjustment, and the cook needs to go back to school!!!!   I have tried several different times on different days and got the same things, absolutely nothing but drama!! At least if you have bad service have good food!!!! The manager is terrible too!!!!"
J Z.,"Loveland, OH",0,10,,1.0,7/5/2017,"Never again! Should have remembered from our last meal there. 1. Place was not very busy. 2. Took 20 min to get waited on. 3. Dining area in terrible condition. Food left on tables, floor and chairs. 4. Food tasted like it was re heated and condomints not on table.  5. Time to get check was never delivered to us and had to flag down manager. 6. Check was not correct. Had a $1.99 charge for playing games on their table computer which we never used..  7. We will never return.!!!!!!!"
Chuck J.,"Perrysburg, OH",0,1,,1.0,5/27/2017,Traveling from out of town- arrived around 9:30 pm. Only person in line at the entrance and did not get greeted from a hostess for 7 minutes.  Took another 7-8 minutes to have the server come to table. This was a Thursday evening and a very mild crowd.  Over  15 minutes from arrival to the time I placed an order.  Shrimp/ Steak combo - shrimp was small and the steak cold. Extremely  disappointed .
Emily R.,"Cincinnati, OH",68,90,1574,2.0,2/24/2016,"I've become ever more disappointed in this Applebee's chain restaurant. I used to love Applebee's, before I knew about my food sensitivities/allergies, now that I struggle with what to eat that won't make me feel sick or give me inflammation or headaches, the less I'm able to enjoy eating out at places like this. Applebee's has made some significant improvements, as of late, in their decor and menu presentation, but they need to spend more time and effort on what their core business is; creating meals and experiences that you want to keep coming back for. I don't feel like my input is welcomed and when about food alternatives, the manager brings me a huge 3 ring binder filled with an extremely comprehensive list of every item on the menu and each allergen marked with a black X. It's like a subtle form of discrimination against people with different dietary needs. I couldn't even begin to read through the list and opted to photograph as many pages as I could before the waiter returned. When I submitted my complaint to the manager she said I needed to complain to corporate myself, that others also complain and implied that corporate doesn't do anything to positively impact the situation. Even ordering food I thought would be""safe"" for me to eat has made me feel sick afterwards. Salmon is always overcooked, they don't even bother asking how I want it cooked. I can't get grilled cod fish, as it comes pre-breaded. Out of all their salad dressings only 4 are dairy free, and they don't provide any olive oil. They use vegetable oil to cook with, and probably cross-contaminate everything. On more than a few occasions the edge of my plate was filled with very noticeable finger prints, around the entire plate. I don't think the company cares very much about customer's needs anymore. They are just too focused on their image and they are neglecting the parts of the business that will make or break them. I suggest offering a section that is Made to Order and offer a variety of suitable substitutions for your main body of dishes. Instead of adhering to your distasteful food environment that pushes away a huge subset of people with different dietary needs, accept and adopt simpler solutions that invite more people to eat at your establishments. Stop pretending like you care and actually do it. Thank you."
Luke C.,"Loveland, OH",1,5,1,4.0,6/1/2017,"It's a great restaurant, we got lucky with a funny and lively waiter. The scenery is relaxing too. The only downside is that the food is a little on the pricey side there."
Brenda H.,"Morrow, OH",1,10,5,2.0,7/29/2017,"First of all too much salt. Second, the self paying - ordering machines at the tables need to be thrown out. Watch your receipt because there was an extra charge on our bill. When I asked to speak to the manager about it I was told they would have to call me back because they didn't have enough help that night in the kitchen. I am still waiting. Third, the vent above us was dripping water because of the condensation. The process improvement team should start working."
Holly S.,"Kings Mills, OH",0,6,,1.0,10/2/2016,"This place just keeps getting worse. Servers are friendly people, but disorganized. We sat for 10 minutes and were about to stand up to walk out before someone greeted us. Our order was a salad, a wrap, and 2 kids meals. (Nothing that needed a lot of cooking time). We got our items 50 minutes later. Well...The kids meals, that is. And the kids were 2/3 of the way done before the salad and wrap came out. Once delivered, the server never returned to our table again to check in or over drink refills. We won't be back to a place we've been going regularly for 13 years."
Jeffrey S.,"Near North Side, Chicago, IL",16,3,1,1.0,9/4/2016,Front desk lady is terrible and serving is way too slow! There were a lot of people waiting and the front desk lady was hanging around and wasting time.
Sarah D.,"Loveland, OH",41,4,,1.0,4/3/2016,"Don't come here hungry. You will be full blown HANGRY by the time you get your food. My family and I spent over an hour and a half here today at lunchtime. I don't know if service is typically that slow or if they were understaffed but it took a brutally long time to even get our appetizer. And then long after we had finished our (mediocre) appetizer we were told by our server 3 separate times that our food was on the way out, but still we waited quite a while. If you don't mind waiting an unreasonable amount of time to eat and enjoy just ""OK"" food, this is your place! However, if you would like good food in a timely manner, there are much better places around Applebee's. Wish we would've gone elsewhere! On another note, if you have a baby that you want to bring into the restaurant in their car seat, your only options are putting them in the booth with you or setting them on the floor. They don't have slings. Get with the times Applebee's. Every other restaurant we frequent has slings.  We won't be back."
Gary H.,"Morrow, OH",0,13,,1.0,7/8/2016,"Stopped there today and waited 15-20 minutes after being seated without seeing a server. No explanation, nothing. Won't be back."
Ed L.,"Erlanger, KY",0,7,,1.0,6/19/2016,Menu cut appetizers ' reduced in size still the same price to cut riblets they're cutting most of the menu for great service
Austin R.,"Morrow, OH",74,1,,5.0,12/9/2016,"My name is Austin and my girlfriends name is Miranda.I couldn't make it out of the parking lot without leaving a review.We both came in and got the 2 for 25$ meal deal and the food was very good.Although the main purpose of my review was the waiter we had.I believe his name was Devon.At first he seemed shy and quiet and a bit agitated but after a small while I noticed why.The rude highschool group to our left that was being loud and obnoxious and obviously knew the hostess,and were bragging about the hostess getting them free food.One,it's not fair to me to have to pay,when they just got four people their entire meal free,two it's not fair to me to go out somewhere nice to eat to deal with the immature crowd we sat next too,nor is it fair to anyone else or to the nearby,hard working waiters and waitresses.Devon stayed professional and was also running back and forth a lot for a different table but was very caring and did what he could to help us.I wanted to leave him a decent tip even when I don't have a lot of money myself,and waiting on my change,I decided he deserved a 12$ tip on a 28$ order.More then I had intended on spending on a dinner but I felt bad for him.Keep up the good work!I'll definitely be coming back just for him.He definitely deserves to get praised or a raise."
Heather L.,"Batavia, OH",71,469,579,2.0,4/30/2015,"Food was cold, took forever, out of many items. They were not that busy to excuse any of that or the poor service. My dinner mate said his food was OK."
Aaron H.,"Lebanon, OH",4,76,8,2.0,3/7/2016,"I remember when Applebee's was a great place to eat.  Unfortunately, not this time.   Our service was exceptional, so this review's silver lining is our server.  She was attentive to our party of 6, and she placed all orders correctly.  Unfortunately, the kitchen got ahold of our orders after the waitress did.  If there was a way to mess something up, they found it.  My wife ordered the mashed potatoes she loves so much.  They had too much time on the plate before arriving to the table, so they were very cold.  My father in law ordered the steak with a pink center. It arrived well-done.  He sent it back, and another arrived well-done (They did give him a complimentary upgrade, so he now had 9 ounces of well-done steak, instead of just 8 on the previous attempt).  By this time, everyone had pretty much finished their meals, so he just told them to forget it and the manager had it removed from their tab.  He offered an almost sincere apology, and he did offer a comp entree to go, but it seemed he was pretty good at this particular speech and just wanted to get through it.  I wanted to pay with cash, but their ridiculous remote control ""tabletop assistants"" have no way to accept cash, and by this time everyone had disappeared, so we were forced to put it on debit.  There are too many restaurants to choose from in this area, so we'll not be back to this Applebee's."
M S.,"Mason, OH",0,1,,1.0,8/11/2016,Horrible.   Extraordinary loud.  Off duty Servers' kid running around. really?   Shared the feedback with the manager and she was fairly condescending listening yet not hearing very disappointing. Not returning anytime soon.   good luck.
Phil M.,"Mentor, OH",31,48,13,2.0,7/6/2015,"10 min in and I already knew this was going to be a bad visit. Sitting at the bar I I'm getting no service. The place is a mess, at least ten tables full of trash and my water had stuff floating in it. When I asked for a new one she told me she will give me one of her glasses because they come out dirty from the back, didn't make me feel good about the food I ordered. I ordered a steak that took forever. The food was cooked correctly. Nothing special but after all it is a chain."
Ben C.,"Cincinnati, OH",2,23,4,4.0,10/23/2015,Food was ok had the 4 cheese mac n cheese with chicken. Didn't look like what was written in menu.  Steak was ok just expected better. Miss the all u can riblets.
Kelly K.,"Cincinnati, OH",17,8,1,1.0,4/3/2015,"My family and I just visited the local Mason Applebee's. The only reason for the 1 star is because the food was decent. Our waitress said 13 words to us the entire time! Not willing to admit she messed up when she didn't put our order of green bean fries in really upset us. When preparing to leave I asked (assuming they did) if they excepted military discount, she shook her head with a blank stair. I asked the hostess because we read they support the troops, she said yes. Needless to say the waitress came back with correct answer."
Kristen C.,"Lebanon, OH",0,32,,5.0,7/20/2015,"I sat at the bar for dinner here on a Monday night at about 5 pm and the service was exceptional.  Tammy the bartender was fantastic,  she kept a very clean environment- even rewashing glasses that weren't perfect without being asked to, but just because it needed to be done.   I didn't have to ask for a thing.  I haven't had the greatest service in the past at various applebees restaurants but this one was great tonight."
Caroline W.,"Mason, OH",37,118,13,2.0,12/24/2012,"Applebee's serves typical chain food - steaks, burgers, chicken tenders, etc. It's not my kind of place but every once in a while family demands that we go here and so we do. I never expect anything to taste out-of-this-world but I do at least expect to get what I ask for. I usually get steaks when eating at these types of places. I've had things like the bourbon street steak, but they always wind up doused with sugar - I just want a steak, not candy. This particular time I got the 2 for $20 to split with my husband. We both ordered the house sirloins with broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes.  I would have given Applebee's a 3 star if they would have cooked the meal right, but they didn't. My ""rare"" steak was so over done it didn't have a drop of pink in it, and the broccoli was crunchy and clearly not done enough. The mashed potatoes were just fine."
Katie D.,"Mason, OH",1,7,,1.0,9/12/2015,Normally we love Applebee's but this time was very different. First off we got to our table and it was very sticky. We got our food and it wasn't very good at all. I got the chicken fajita roll-ups and it was lukewarm when they brought it out. My husband ordered some shrimp-noodle thing and his shrimp and vegetables on one side were burnt and the other side was not cooked. And his noodles were soaked in butter. We ordered our son the pizza bread and it was more sauce and cheese and just clumped together. And the mini cheeseburger we ordered for our daughter was also burnt on one side. The waiter took our order and got our drinks....he never asked if everything was ok. My husband talked to the manager but he said he was too busy for him at that time so he had a few minutes with him. My husband even asked the waiter if he would eat what he was and he said No. We will not be going back to that location.
Justin W.,"Harrisburg, PA",41,52,5,3.0,11/21/2011,"Stopped for lunch. Apparently lunch guaranteed in 14 mins or free. We were given stop watch . Our meals arrived at about the 11 minute mark. I've avoided applebees (in PA, and GA) for quite sometime because of the less than stellar service ive received in the past..  Today I enjoyed my dining experience at Applebees. Furhermore I would like to acknowledge corporates efforts to address the time it takes  for meals selected from the lunch menu to arrive in a timely fashion.   I recommend the orange chicken bowl."
Michael H.,"Cincinnati, OH",395,96,6,2.0,6/24/2011,Yaaay for sodium!! Why does everything on the Applebee's menu taste like someone dumped the salt shaker into the pan while it's cooking?
Rachel R.,"Cincinnati, OH",499,539,286,4.0,2/8/2011,"The Margarita's are done fantastically at this location! But again, typical chain food.  They're normally good with turning tables and I've never had to wait long, even on a busy night. There have been times that I've watched people sat after me get their food first, but that happens sometimes. The only problem I have with this location, is that they don't seem to be consistent with their steaks AT ALL. I've gone in on separate occasions and gotten some form of steak (either itself or with the fajitas) and I order it Medium. Had to send it back once, and the other time it was so well done it was ridiculous. That and its always so salty!! Seriously, let me salt my own darned food. Other than that the staff are friendly and the bartenders know what their doing!"
Christine B.,"Warsaw, KY",0,4,,2.0,11/20/2014,"Bahama Mama is delicious! Male Bartender at night is a pretty cool but the lady server Tammy has a bad attitude and seems to hate her job. I wasn't even sitting in her section and I overheard her whining. I'm sure she's a nice lady but jeez, get a grip."
Erinn L.,"Kansas City, MO",38,35,,2.0,1/4/2010,"The food at Applebee's is typical chain restaurant food. Burgers, fries, sandwiches, salads, etc. It usually tastes decent, but is nothing out of the ordinary, and there have definitely been some nights when my dish is not up to par. I have had many servers who did a really nice job and were extremely polite, unfortunately the majority of the staff there seems to not really care. They just want to get the job done. This is particularly a problem when I'm out with younger people as opposed to taking my parents out to dinner. They seem to automatically assume anyone under the age of 30 is going to be obnoxious, even if there's only 3 or 4 of us.  My worst experiences here have been with groups. I understand that large groups can be frustrating and they require more work and patience, however, any group of more than five seems to come with the assumption that the people are going to be obnoxious. I've even had an instance where the server came back to the table with separate our separate checks and just tossed all of them at me. I don't mind distributing the checks amongst ourselves, but throwing them was just unnecessary.  I'll still go here if I'm with a friend who wants to eat at this particular location but it's definitely not my first choice."
