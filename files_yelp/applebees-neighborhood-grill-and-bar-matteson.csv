Joe B.,"Chicago, IL",181,871,161,2.0,9/29/2011,"Never in my long and illustrious drinking career have I encountered so much difficulty in procuring a singular beer until coming here.  Neither the bartender nor her manager were inclined to believe that the handsome creature featured on my valid and current Missouri driver license was actually me.  I was 25 at the time, and 23 at the time the license photo was taken.  I offered a wallet-full of other IDs, but only after being heckled by other patrons for stalling my Blue Moon, the manager relented.  But not before subjecting me to border agent-level scrutiny. I can't fault a business or its agents for following the law, but there was a definite breakdown of professionalism in this case."
C O.,"Crete, IL",0,1,,1.0,1/19/2013,"We had not been to this location in a while, and now I remember why.  In a word, SLOW!!!  Both service and kitchen staff here take forever - we waited over twenty minutes just for our drinks (non-alcoholic) to be brought to us.  Our food took another fourty minutes after that, even though we had placed our order at the same time we gave the server our drink orders.  Won't be visiting this location any time in the near future (if ever again)!"
