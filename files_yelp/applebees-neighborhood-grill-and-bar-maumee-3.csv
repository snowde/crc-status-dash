Rosa G.,"Toledo, OH",40,3,,3.0,8/27/2017,"My fiance and I went here on a Sunday evening. Was not busy at all. Our server was ok, not bad but not great. We ordered a steak medium rare and it came out well done. Fine, server asked if we wanted a new one which we said yes. The manager brought the new steak out. He did not apologize, all he said was "" Is this rare enough for you?"", and he walked away. I am a manager in the customer service field and I feel like this was a terrible interaction with a dissatisfied customer."
Maria M.,"Cincinnati, OH",252,163,190,2.0,12/22/2015,"BLAH is the only way I knew how to describe my experience at this Applebee's tonight.  Service: waitress was nice but forgetful and everything seemed to take a long time to come out (even drinks).  Food: probably the worst food I've had at Applebee's. My house salad was okay, but I got the house sirloin & a baked potato for dinner and it was bad. Steak wasn't really cooked correctly and it was super hard to cut. Seemed old. I came to the conclusion my baked potato was super old as well. I hadn't eaten all day so I sucked it up and ate it. I was confused because I don't remember Applebee's steak or potatoes being bad.  The only plus was that they had half off certain apps because it was after 9PM... I discovered this by looking online and was only told when I asked the server about it. For the money I was disappointed and will not return in the near future."
Des C.,"Barrington, RI",94,267,18,3.0,6/25/2015,"After a long day of driving and meetings we decided to go to the restaurant in the adjacent parking lot, it happened to be an Applebees.  Typically I steer clear of eating good in the neighborhood, however we decided the convenience was key tonight. We were sat quickly and handed a menu that appeared to be new and a bit more exciting.  This location served Yeungling which gave them a good mark out of the gate.  Our serves was very friendly and attentive.  Believe it or not the food was actually pretty good!  Would I seek out an Applebees in the future...definitely not, but in a pinch it's not a bad idea.  Food was good and the service was great.  Nice job!"
Stefanie W.,"Addison, IL",33,193,62,2.0,4/15/2016,I know...  You're staying at a hotel nearby and Applebee's is RIGHT THERE and you feel safe because it's familiar.  But Don Juan's is also RIGHT THERE.  Go there instead.  I tried both.  ;-) This is Applebee's.  I expect it was like any other Applebees.  Disappointing food that didn't live up to the menu puffery.  One member of our party didn't get his meal until we were nearly done.  No explanation.  No discount.  And they overcharged us for two bottles of wine.  I know...who orders bottles of wine at Applebee's??  We did.  Shut up.
c g.,"Winnetka, IL",20,219,21,5.0,2/18/2016,"Excellent. Well staffed with like able people. I got to go from the bar and the Chicken was tender and tasty, mashed potatoes where creamy and had a spivey kick with jalapeño and the wedge salad was fresh and crisp.  The bartender was nice and they had a selection of national brews on tap and one local - Yuengling. I enjoyed two of those as I waited for my food.  Glad I came here. When I Yelped it did not pop up as an option but when I walked out the hotel door and saw it I found it to be very convenient and a solid option due to their success tonite. I will be back."
Charlotte S.,"Addison, IL",156,140,180,4.0,6/25/2015,"Applebee's is Applebee's when it comes to appearance and food no matter which location you go to with little variation, so it is up to the server to define the establishment. Food was fine, the presentation was appetizing and neat and the flavor was good. The long island ice teas were very good, makes it into the top ranking of long islands I've had. Our server, Chris G., was awesome. We were a party of 6 who came in about half an hour until close for post-wedding drinks and hors d'oeurves (11:30pm on a Saturday), a time when many servers would be a**holes just wanting you to get out so they can close quickly; instead, Chris happily served us with no air of a rush. He checked on us frequently, got our food and drinks to us in a timely fashion, exchanged some friendly chit chat, and all in all represented Applebee's well. You've got yourself a good employee there. This Applebee's is located right next to the County Inn and Suites of Maumee, so guests staying at the hotel get a 10% discount when they dine here. Yes, this is just another Applebee's, but Chris earned them the 4 star."
Laura G.,"Waterville, OH",0,7,,5.0,1/13/2017,Apple bees is one of my favorite places to eat I could stay here and eat. The sauce here is rare and its amazing. fries are great to and the waiters are always nice. Always clean and I'm proud to say that I love apple bees
Sarah P.,"Sylvania, OH",47,5,7,5.0,3/24/2016,The quesadilla burger was amazing. I love Applebee's and this was a great experience.
Nicole B.,"Sylvania, OH",0,14,,2.0,3/29/2016,"Went to Applebee's for dinner one night with my husband & we ordered margaritas.  I showed my waitress my ID & as with all Applebee's, it has to be checked by management.  I am 25 years old and although I look young, I didn't expect to have a situation with my ID.  The manager came over & rudely stated that he would not serve me because, ""this doesn't look like you, it looks like your mom.""  Never heard that one before!  He stated he only was going to serve my husband because the eyes matched.  I have been a bartender before & I COMPLETELY understand people have fake ID's, but it was real as could be! I even took out school ID's, my Sam's Club Membership, ANYTHING with a picture on it to prove that it was me. The manager was incredibly rude & finally stated after coming back to our table 3 times, ""I'm going to humor you, and decide to serve you...but only because your waitress is pushing it.""  It did not humor me in the least.  I would give 5 stars to the waitress due to the amazing job she did - she cared about making customers happy, and that was awesome.  It was a TERRIBLE experience for me, as I've never encountered someone that incredibly rude to patrons - so be careful if you order alcohol there, you may have a fake ID & not even know it!"
Ace B.,"Long Beach, CA",24,20,7,2.0,8/24/2014,"Worst Applebee's yet, they took multiple things off my order as it was just plain bad. The staff was cheerful, my complaint is the kitchen and management, or lack there of. Bar is ok just don't order food."
Krissy C.,"Maumee, OH",3,24,9,2.0,9/15/2014,"Walked into applebees on a friday around 6:30 pm.  Was told there was a 10-15 minute wait...as we crammed into the 'waiting area' (there is none), I looked around the restaurant and saw about 7 tables empty ready to seat people.   15 minutes later we were seated at a booth right next to where we were left standing for 15 minutes.   The hostesses thought this was funny as I saw them laughing right before we were seated.  I have worked in the food service area for 10 years and that is NO acceptable.  If your hostess doesnt know how to seat people....she shouldnt be a hostess!  Our meal was ok...nothing special.  Our waitress was good.  All and all, I dont think we will be back. $86.00 is not worth spending for dinner at this Applebees."
Shelley A. D.,"Chicago, IL",6,119,,2.0,1/6/2015,"My family dined here on Christmas Eve, 2014.  Staff was polite and lovely.  We were surrounded by regulars that they greeted with cheer.  My children had burgers and they were happy.  I ordered from the under 600 calorie option--- which was a chicken/quinoa dish.  It looked like the picture.  However I believe my chicken breast was dusted in either sugar or msg.  I was unsatisfied-- so I ordered a second course of steamed broccoli (which was perfect) and sweet potato fries (which were tasty).  Final word:  if you are on a road trip, need a place to stop with friendly staff, and love burgers & sweet potato fries-- this is your place.  If you want high quality, fresh food that is well prepared-- search elsewhere. #chifoodie #familyfriendly #roadtrip"
Terry W.,"Pittsboro, NC",86,709,1995,3.0,12/23/2010,I have been to many Applebee's around the Country. They serve a consistent menu. You can always depend on what they offer. Always a nice bar area with friendly service. The food is of course chain quality but you know what to expect.
Jen L.,"PRINCE, NY",10,118,6,1.0,9/25/2012,From start to finish the worst service ever. starting with messing up the drink orders to no straws the whole stay there :( To waiting 35 minutes from the time we got there to get our appetizer... :( To 2 more minutes getting our food and 8 more minutes taken away by a pushy blonde server trying to hurry up the customers out for more tips. She took my sister whole half rack of ribs when we said we didnt want boxes and my pasta barely eaten. PUSHy and horrible service.
Tyler S.,"Indianapolis, IN",42,10,2,4.0,6/8/2013,"The waitress was very cheerful and happy as we entered the restaurant. We went and ordered our drinks and received them in a timely matter, the lemon that was supposed to be in my sweet tea accidentally got put in my girlfriend's water, no biggie though. It took a little bit for our food to come out but that was because the grill was having issues, which the waitress explained to us politely. My drink never reached empty, she constantly filled it up, as well as with everyone else in my party. Likes: speedy service, friendly waitress, tasty food. Dislikes: prolonged food delivery because of grill, lemon was placed in the wrong drink."
B G.,"Liberty Center, OH",24,106,,3.0,1/11/2010,"I never feel more like a middle-class, Midwestern, white dude than when I go to Applebee's.  It's like the Gap of chain restaurants.  This Applebee's has been open for ages, yet no one has reviewed it yet.  Hmmm, I'm guessing that's because it's freaking Applebee's and everyone knows what to expect.  I mean really, who checks out a review for Applebee's before going there?  This particular Applebee's is just like all the others you've seen, and you know exactly what you are going to get: mostly decent food (not bad but nothing truly memorable or outstanding), generic chain-restaurant atmosphere, and service that could be all over the board depending on the people employed that week.   Over the years I've had tons of stuff from the menu, and I can't say I ever recall really disliking the food.  On the other hand, I also can't recall ever leaving there thinking my food was awesome.  For instance, the chicken tenders are fine; exactly like chicken tenders you can get a million other places.  The burgers are fine, just like a million other places.   My point is this: nothing sets Applebee's apart from all the other chains to get me exited to go there.  I don't think I'll have a terrible meal there, but I don't have any special incentive to go there over somewhere else.  Take Chili's for example; it is essentially the same type of restaurant.  However, they have a few of items that are great, and I look forward to having them again.  (Bottomless Chips and Salsa, oh how I love thee!)  Applebee's doesn't have that killer item for me.  I'll tell you when Applebee's IS the perfect restaurant choice.  When you're traveling and you need to stop along the highway for a bite, and you don't want to gamble on some local place about which you know nothing, Applebee's is your go-to place.  You know the meal will probably be halfway decent, even if it's not actually exciting and memorable.  Applebee's chief virtue is that it won't be terrible."
