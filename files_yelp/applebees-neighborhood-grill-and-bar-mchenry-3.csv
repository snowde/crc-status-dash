Randy G.,"McHenry, IL",0,3,4,3.0,1/2/2018,"We haven't been to Applebees in a while. I had a small steak with shrimp, my wife had the riblets, and my son had a burger. We all had the French onion soup.  I just want to know when a dinner for 3 at Applebees cost almost $100 with tip. This isn't the drop in for a quick affordable meal anymore.  The food was good, the waitress was nice, but we will think twice about going here again because of the cost."
Guy F.,"Woodstock, IL",0,1,,2.0,1/7/2018,"I want to start off by saying holy guacamole this service was bad, our server was good but the wait times were atrocious. I've put off this review for several visits hoping this was a fluke but sadly it was not we went to the restaurant 2 hours before I had to leave on a big trip leaving time for eating and travel of course and we got our food and finnished with 10 minutes to get to the airport which was 40 minutes away. I'm disappointed in the monotony that is the franchise of Applebee's it used to be such a good and reliable source but now everytime I go there I feel let down and hassled by the workers I can't stand the food or the service I'm disappointed with you as a franchise Applebee's not just as a location sincerely guy F."
Kim D.,"Walworth, WI",79,22,11,1.0,5/19/2017,"Horrible Food over Priced service.. ok. We walked in and were told there was a wait, fine. Well wait at the bar.. hostess ""let me see if thats ok theres a mandatory wait.. ? Really ?  U want to force us to stand by the door instead of letting us spend more money while waiting?.  Finally allowed to wait in bar, bartender had NO clue how to make a rum and. Coke. Wow Then we finally ordered.  Spinach Artichoke Cavatappi with Chicken.  More like frozen creamed spinach with precooked chicken strips.. disgusting!  $60 for bad cold food..."
John B.,"Woodstock, IL",0,3,,3.0,2/17/2017,"Stopped in late on a Wednesday for half-price appetizers. It's Applebees - you know what to expect, but this location did it well. Although the location was relatively slow, the service was prompt and friendly. We tried the wings (boneless and bone-in), pretzel sticks, some kind of wanton appetizer, and mozzarella sticks. We both enjoyed the wings - cooked well, crunchy but not overdone. The mustard with the pretzels was outstanding, but the beer cheese tasted (and had the consistency) of a thin soup. The mozzarella wedges were not particularly flavorful.  After drinking water, our overall bill for 2 was $25. Reasonable price, but would not be worth it without half-price appetizers."
Elaine P.,"Concord, CA",18,492,,3.0,7/18/2015,"It has been years and years since we have been to an Applebee's. We were pleasantly surprised by what we found.  Our salads were fresh, although the chicken on mine seemed a bit ""processed"" as if it were not grilled in house.   Can't recall the last time I had a decent glass of wine that cost less than $6.I avoided the Sutter Home and chose the Walnut Crest cab at $4.It is a Chilean wine and was a pleasant surprise ... very drinkable. Ended the meal with a $2.49 brownie bite: a small wedge of brownie topped with walnuts and served with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.  Perfect size. For the most part the wait staff was on the young side. Our waitress was pleasant and helpful, all while pushing the specials (but not too much)."
Jennifer P.,"Addison, IL",383,943,2285,3.0,4/5/2014,"So, options for ""good"" food in McHenry is pretty limited.  That said, my mom had received an Applebee's gift card and wanted to treat me to lunch last Saturday, so who am I to decline? Similiar to TGI Friday's, it's difficult to find NON-chicken or beef options on the menu.  The only seafood options I located on the menu were a Shrimp Pasta, a Fish and Chips basket, and Grilled Cheese. I had the latter, which also came with a small cup of tomato soup.  My mom had the Bleu Burger. In all, it was alright.  I think I expected more flavor since they boasted a trio of different cheeses, but found nothing notable as far as grilled cheese goes.  My mom enjoyed her burger.  Despite the place being relatively empty, the service, overall, was kind of poor.  Our server did pass us several times to attend to his other tables, so it did make it easier to flag him down for refills or to ask a question.  He was also nice about getting me change (since we didn't realize Mom had so much money on the gift card and it covered the entire meal). In all, if I had to go to a chain, I'd prefer to go to Panera across the street, where the have some healthier and less-heavy options."
Kelly C.,"McHenry, IL",0,8,4,2.0,4/17/2016,"Have not been to this Applebee's in quite awhile. Cannot believe how low class it's gotten.  Bar filthy, sticky! Employees' dress looked sloppy. Garbage swept to pile behind bar. And this was at opening.  Ordered the Club sandwich. It was advertised to have ham, bacon and turkey. When I opened the sandwich to find the meat I saw ham, a piece of bacon, and wedged between the ham slices was a tiny piece of turkey. Like one bite.  Will not try again, don't recommend. Lots of other options around this area."
Jeremy O.,"McHenry, IL",37,5,,1.0,10/16/2016,"Slow service, flies buzzing around everywhere, no a/c and the bathroom smelled like it hadn't been cleaned in ages.  Awful experience...never again."
Thom W.,"Leesburg, FL",0,2,,1.0,7/24/2016,"Do not eat here!!! The staff is rude and the food was gross, cold and tasted like it had been sitting out.  Worst dinning experience ever.  Even the manager was rude.  Stay away."
John G.,"Lake Geneva, WI",7,158,113,5.0,3/31/2016,"I have not been in Applebee's in quite sometime, I was pleasantly surprised, the service was good, the Quesadilla Burger was fabulous! I recommend checking them out again! The food was really good!"
Pam O.,"McHenry, IL",3,29,1,1.0,9/10/2016,Lisa the manger is NO MANGER!! You complain and she comes over like your bugging her. Came in on a Saturday afternoon to have a drink after shopping and waited 10 minutes to be acknowledged then we were told she would right with us..of wait then the phone rang that was another thing more important than us sitting at the bar cause we are too much trouble to be served. An elderly couple asked if the bartender could put the baseball game and bartender had to give another tude that she has to make sure other people weren't watching...now there were 4 people sitting at the bar 4 including me and my mom...6 TV at the bar and every one on the save station so yeah j could see how you couldn't change one that would've been terrible! Come on!!! This Applebee's has gone WAY down hill!! Now after I complained the bar tender leaves the bar so if we wanted another drink we are shit out of luck!
Deb T.,"Cary, IL",0,17,,1.0,7/22/2017,"I think it is just this location because like other reviewers I had a good experience in Decatur, IL.  Also like other reviewers I was sent two $5 coupons for a previous bad experience at this location.  Our waiter said I could only use one per visit. I told him no where on the  coupon does it say that.  The manager came over and when I told her they were for a previous bad experience she said okay I'll take them but I'm not suppose to.  I asked her for my itemized receipt which I did not get.  She came back with a very crumpled receipt.  Then she said the only way she could use both coupons is to void and redo the receipt.  I said okay void it.  She was gone a long time with my card and came back to show me she took both coupons off.  I said okay but I need the voided receipt.  She said yes, of course.  When she came back she said she couldn't print one but not to worry it would be fine on my credit card. She had torn up the voided purchase receipt.  This seemed very unprofessional not to be able to give me a voided receipt.  Two table around us also had mistakes on their bills.  I left there with an upset stomach with the suspicious way she handled it.   She was not very apologetic and did not give me her name.  The service was slow and where we sat it was not very clean.  The only good thing was the food was good. Obviously, I will not be returning and do not want any more discount coupons."
J D.,"Woodstock, IL",7,93,8,3.0,3/11/2015,"I dunno, OK? I guess? A-OK? Basic family-style bar/restaurant (though ... I didn't SEE the bar ... is there one?). Menu had a quite a few two-of-this-and-two-of-that-and-one-of-this combinations ... OK, nobody told me there'd be math, but the options were actually quite useful. Went with two lunch specials. And, now I know. Lunch special means small portions. I mean ... NORMAL portions. Gosh, I am way too spoiled by serving platter sized portions, aren't I? The soup was a normal soup bowl, the three cheese penne pasta was a ""side"" portion, my friend's sandwich was half of one (though plenty big enough to tell the truth). We arrived early for lunch and the soup wasn't particularly hot - was this reheated from last night? Probably. Kind'a tasted like it. Boo! The pasta was very good (if only I'd had a full serving!), my friend's sandwich looked very good (though the 'flavored' mayo took her by surprise - she's not a menu fine print reader, I guess). Waitress was good, gave us time when we needed it, came over when we needed her, friendly and helpful. Food came out fast and as ordered. Price of the special was terrific. Another family-style restaurant option to go to ..."
Glen D.,"Chicago, IL",0,10,2,1.0,12/7/2014,I would also like to add that a person at applebees corporate contacted me. They said they will resolve the issue with gift cards and pleaded to me to give them another shot.  Also giving the excuse for the server not knowing the menu saying this was a new item I had ordered. It was the wrong item delivered............................... She had sent me a 25$ coupon coupon with proof of purchase attached to it. Well I apologize but why would I ever go to your establishment after my last experience? It does not make any sense unless it was free.  And the coupon does not include alcohol. I would have to drink to deal with applebees again.  So to review I had complained about my worst experience ever at a restaurant. Applebees corporate counters with a 25$ coupon with purchase.   So the big corporate company does not care about the small town customers. Or listen or take care of the issues plaguing this terrible awful company period.  Your neighborhood grill- I dont care about your neighborhood period.  Reviewer- telling hundreds of people how awful you are. By hundreds I mean the 1k plus people on my social network. Twitter facebook linkdin  I have single handedly stopped at least 30 people from going to that location by word of mouth.  Small town customer
Penny L.,"Kenosha, WI",3,8,,2.0,3/19/2016,Cheryl our bartender was amazing. Her customer service top notch. However the shift manager who was african american couldn't tell you his name because he was too good to wear a name tag. I apologize for having to refer to him like that.. He was standing around swearing talking about things that were not appropriate. To top it off the front door was getting backed up and he's screaming on the radio. Hey how bout you take your butt up to the front and help out your staff. The food left much to be desired. I will not be back
Janet D.,"Ringwood, IL",131,34,11,5.0,7/18/2015,"Applebee's in McHenry did a fantastic job at the Multi-State Mixer serving appetizers for  8 Chamber Executives and business attendees of over 220 in number, June 2nd 2015. There were so many compliments on the food and service, many of them are going there for luncheons to conduct business. Thank you McHenry Applebees! Your the best in this community!"
Adam L.,"Island Lake, IL",103,182,158,1.0,3/21/2015,Posted soft target zone. Since you can barely trust Applebee's to get your order correct; I hardly think they're going to be responsible enough to ensure my safety.
Court T.,"McHenry, IL",0,3,,2.0,7/6/2016,"It was ok, service was slow and they forgot the bacon on my burger and thats a big no no!"
Rick W.,"Crystal Lake, IL",0,8,,1.0,6/19/2016,"We've been fans of Applebees for 15 years, going almost weekly until they were bought by IHOP. With that, the menu immediately began to change with our favorite appetizer being one of the first to go. When that happened, we stopped eating there as often going only once or twice a year. Over the years, the menu has steadily declined with favorite dishes being replaced or changed. Our visit tonight made us realize that this was not the restuarant we loved 15 years ago and would never be that restuarant again. So we bid goodbye to the IHOPed Applebees. We will not be back."
Ger A.,"Barrington, IL",123,497,93,3.0,7/29/2013,"I know FRANCHISE, but the Dundee Palatine location was GOOD, & this is now the closest Applebees to us (30 miles!) after some kind of reorg & sale and closing of a lot of NW and Western Illinois Applebees (tax & lease losers). I think at least eleven closed and I just FINALLY got the Palatine Applebees flagged CLOSED and off the open Yelp intertubes but you best call first because Yelp is really slow at Flagging closed busynesses imo. Maybe YELP likes to pump up their numbers like some elites? I like to take my reviews DOWN when the busyness closes. Very close to the intersection of Route 31 & and 120 In McHenry. HUGE parking lot and looks like all the other Applebees, a little bit like the old Cheers Bar. Lotta wood, and dimly lit. I strongly recommend either coming early or late at either lunch or dinner because the peaks can overwhelm the staff. We like to go late for dinner and, bonus, appetizers are half price during the week after 9pm, and after 10pm on weekends. I like their 2 meals for $20 that includes an appetizer, and I tend to stick meat and potatoes here, like a burger or one of the small sirloin steaks. The boneless chicken wings are a good appetizer and the Oriental Chicken salad is pretty good. They have some under 550 calorie meals and they are better than you might expect; there are dinner specials every day. They try hard to accomodate any diet preferences you might have, and they can always back off on the salt shaker imo. They have a pretty lively bar, and drink specials every night so this is a good place to remember for that solo dinner with a lot of big screen tvs when that special someone is out of town. The bartenders can take your order, serve you, get drinks AND pretend to listen to your story. Try it. A-OK"
Scott W.,"Wood Dale, IL",1,3,,1.0,6/24/2015,"This is the second time in 6 months we have been at this location and its been horrible, for the most part the staff are like extras from the walking dead, tables are always sticky (we had to ask our server to rewipe the table),the food took to long even though we had only ordered appetizers, this is not to say all Applebee's are like this because they're not just the one in Mchenry, Illinois. The ONLY good thing was our server Kyle M was very good. The food was just OK but all in all this will be our last time dining at the Applebee's."
Rose L.,"Woodstock, IL",0,52,25,1.0,2/28/2015,"Horrible. Never going back to this location. In the past, other Applebee's have been ok, but our experience with the McHenry location has ruined Applebee's for me. Food was tasteless and service was horrible. Our server took 30min+ to bring our drink order, then sat with patrons while she enjoyed a drink and never offered us refills or checked if our meals were ok.  Manager was nowhere in sight. Do not recommend!!!"
Simone C.,"Chicago, IL",0,27,19,5.0,7/12/2013,"I have eaten here probably four times when visiting family in the area.  The food has always been very good--well served and presented.  The drinks are generous, well-poured and properly served.  Staff has always been attentive, knowledgable and friendly, without being intrusive.  The place is spotless and welcoming, too.  I have never had a long wait for service or refills.   Recently, I left behind a beloved jacket.  Most places (chains especially) would have stood on that ""Not Responsible for Personal Property"" mantra but the staff went above and beyond the call of duty in order to get it back to me.  Kudos to this Applebees!"
Chris R.,"Lakemoor, IL",0,2,3,1.0,9/2/2014,Stopped in tonight went to the bar and didn't have anyone great us for over 10 minutes. Decided to move on to the next spot in town where we were welcomed right away.
Amy C.,"Wonder Lake, IL",0,3,,1.0,8/8/2015,It had been years  since my family and I have been in this one.... We were very disappointed when we eat there the other day.  First of all the bar tender was  to busy taking to her coworkers to make a strawberry lemonade!  Finally got it and it was so bad it tasted like water with strawberries in.  Then we ordered mozzarella sticks and received them they were so over cooked there was no cheese in them.  The manager came out and said sorry but at Taft point it was to late and the diner finally came it was ok!! But would not run back there again anytime soon! Very disappointed
Dominik S.,"McHenry, IL",4,20,2,4.0,3/14/2012,"I try not comment on chain restaurants.  I don't order from here often, but the $4.99 burgers, fries, and drink special was cool. We picked up in the ""carry-out"" and service was good. Our order was ready in 15 minutes.  The burgers were excellent!"
Jennifer E.,"Pleasant Prairie, WI",1,76,12,5.0,11/4/2012,This Applebee's has the best service....ask for Meg or Samantha...they are by far THE best servers we've had...we eat out often and wish there were more like them! Try the Nawlins Skillet...it's both mine and my hubby's fav!!
Holly S.,"Crystal Lake, IL",54,3,,1.0,1/18/2015,"Awful service.  Waited I over an hour for a salad and chicken dish.  Had to ask for utensils, server didn't even acknowledge us For 15 minutes.  He said the kitchen was ""backed up.""  People that were seated after us had their meals and left before we got ours. Only reason we went was because we had a gift card.  Wouldn't pay for that!"
Howard D.,"Spring Grove, IL",14,7,2,1.0,8/23/2014,Had to wait even with three tables open. Kitchen was extremely backed up and staff kept telling us that they were sorry. Chicken was dry. Bourbon glaze was missing. Had to ask for silver ware. Never going back. Mismanaged!
Angela E.,"McHenry, IL",34,4,,1.0,8/18/2012,"Just pretty bad. About a year ago we went here, we got the waitress who must have been a local celebrity because she chatted with everyone. But us. She took our order and she was gone. Saw her again when she brought us the bill. I just wanted to leave but it took her 20 MINUTES to take my boyfriend's card. She was too busy chatting with the next table over. Tonight we tried going here again. I was told if I ordered a special beer or margarita I could get free chips and salsa. I ordered a pomegranate martini and she hmmed and hawed because it wasnt on the list of ""specials"". But she said ""yea I think we can do that"". They brought me a margarita from the special menu instead of what I asked for but I didn't get any chips or salsa plus the drink was full price! She was attentive to every table but ours till we got the bill. The other waitresses weren't very personable either. I guess that's why they work at Applebees though. My boyfriend and I made a pact to never go back, no matter how desperate we are for a cheap date night."
Suzie S.,"McHenry, IL",0,21,,2.0,12/1/2011,"Haven't been very impressed, the food is alright but nothing special. Wait staff is usually pretty unattentive. There's better in town!"
Jaelene P.,"McHenry, IL",0,2,,1.0,12/8/2012,"My boyfriend and I were having a date night tonight, and we were going to go to Chili's but they were packed. We saw the Applebee's and I realized I haven't been there in ten or so years. Now I know why. We sat at the bar where there were two people working; Brandon and Victoria I think. If you sit at the bar, ask for Brandon as he was the ONLY one doing their job. Victoria on the other hand messed up my drink.(Which was Sierra Mist.)after I told her twice I didn't want Pepsi. After giving us our drinks she walked away, so Brandon got me a new drink with no attitude or problem. About twenty to thirty minutes later Victoria comes back and takes our order with anything but a smile and nice attitude. She prints out our recipt(goodbye dessert!)and walks away again, even though my boyfriend and I needed refills. The entire night she was telling Brandon to make the drinks as she texted, checked her Facebook, and gossiped with all the other waitresses standing around. Finally someone brought the food, and for a seven dollar burger you'd expect some sustenance, not a flimsy burger, three pickle slices, and cold fries that taste like Burger King. The entire time we ate every time Victoria looked at us she did so with a dirty look. Maybe it's a new age thing where you treat customers with utmost disrespect, or maybe she had a bad night, but typically you don't treat customers as rude as she did. Brandon on the other hand was so nice and was doing basically all the work that needed to be done. If, for some reason you have lost your mind and decide to go here at least ask for brandon. I wonder if Victoria ever thought that if she were nicer and did her job without complaining in front of customers she would get more than a $2.50 tip which was left out of pity."
Mike J.,"Wonder Lake, IL",9,26,,4.0,10/31/2010,"Nice place.  Staff are very nice and attentive, the food was hot and fresh, the service was very good.  Lots of parking due to the way the lot is and the environment is nice but a bit noisy (typical Applebee's)."
