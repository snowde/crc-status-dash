Phelan R.,"San Diego, CA",37,48,54,4.0,9/23/2017,"We stopped by Applebee's on the way to the mountains. They have the 2 for $20 + appetizer deal so we got the Caesar salad, shrimp and chicken deal. The plate comes with grilled mushrooms and onion, garlic butter and pesto sauce.  Everything was tasty. Server was helpful and on point. Standard Applebee's food. Would come back when driving through Menefee."
Marco R.,"Sun City, CA",0,88,8,1.0,12/29/2017,"Shockingly bad, where do I begin, first they gave us potato's instead of green beans, then the chicken pasta looked half eaten with 3 slim sliced pieces that wouldn't even equal a quarter of a chicken breast. We added extra shrimp to the other meal and received about 5 total, so how many came with the dinner? 2? Then the chocolate dessert they initially forgot to bring us at car-side to go, came with ""hot fudge"" turns out it was BBQ sauce and ruined the dessert because you couldn't tell from how dark it was and thinking it's meant for your food we just poured it on top. When we called to complain the Manager had the nerve to tell us to call back tomorrow and they will see if they can do something for us. Unbelievable. What's the Manager hired at this location for? Obviously not overseeing orders, and not providing customer service when something goes wrong.  This are needs new food options but not like these."
G G.,"Menifee, CA",92,24,6,2.0,12/15/2017,"Mediocre food which would have been tolerable if it weren't for the snotty server. I just can't do attitude. It's not that hard to be nice. Shawn seated us, told us appetizers were 1/2 off. He didn't say it didn't include chips and salsa from the appetizer part of the menu. There is another menu for happy hour appetizers we found out later. When the bill came the appetizer has full price. Joel was our server. I told him I wanted 1/2 off like we were told . Please don't act like it's a hardship to take $2 of the tab. His remark was that he would take it out of his own pocket. I'm not stupid. He discounted the tab $2. Second, silly issue: I only  had leftovers. Joel gave hubby the.box.and me the bill...eh?"
Katia K.,"San Diego, CA",62,25,223,4.0,9/23/2017,"They have a good deal going on - 2 meals for $20. I had chicken and shrimp. The buttery sauce was great! Excellent customer service too! Thank you!  The place was a bit dirty on the floor, bread crumbs, otherwise a strong 4 stars!"
Jeff And Laurie Q.,"Saint Paul, MN",2,24,19,4.0,12/2/2017,"We usally do Chili's but chili's is too far of a drive if you have a couple beers. We like the food  (2 for $25) and the bartender was very good. The grilled vegetables were really good.$1 off drinks during happy hour is lame, should be 2 for 1 since the drinks are so weak."
Joe G.,"Menifee, CA",0,15,3,1.0,12/6/2017,"So we walk in at 5:40pm on 12/6/17.  They have 18 tables open.  I asked the hostess if we can take a table in the bar, she said no, they are wait tables.  Over the next 5 minutes nobody left the restaurant yet she walked away and said if you want a table in the bar go ahead and take it.   Soooooo not sure how it all works but I feel most people don't understand when half the resturants empty why you have to wait."
Jason L.,"Wildomar, CA",191,40,,1.0,10/17/2017,Pass on this place !!   Service was bad Cold food I should of known better! 2nd time I been let down.  But moms wants it. Never had a server say I'm sorry so many times.
Nadyne L.,"Menifee, CA",0,16,,1.0,10/16/2017,"WHAT HAPPENED?  I know it's been a long time since they first opened, but OMG what a HUGE difference.  Service is lousy.  Hostess staff is self-absorbed and pay little to no attention to guests. Their post was loaded with silverware stacking - tubs of silverware, napkins, etc. Right at the door!!!  They can't sit at a back table somewhere to do this?   When leaving I asked for a bag to carry our boxed leftovers - we waited and waited and waited - finally I just said ""forget it"".  We left.  ""Sorry."" they echoed. The food???? OMG  We were excited to get hamburgers that night - really had a taste for a great burger.  (Should have gone to Red Robin or BJ's)  We asked for rare, as pink as possible.  Was there pink?  Nope - no shade of pink.  Dry!  The bacon wasn't fully cooked, so it was chewy.  Our waitress was a ditz.  She forgot a couple things we asked for, we had to ask other staff walking by for our needs.  When I asked again for the lemons she forgot, she looked irritated.  Attitude stunk.   Big mistake not going to one of the two others noted above. We might try it one more time for anything but hamburger.  Mind you Applebees USED to be one of our TOP favorite restaurants.  Once more and that's all."
Drea G.,"Sun City, CA",14,5,,5.0,9/12/2017,"Sean is the best waiter I have had hands down! I work in customer service and am a manager of a hotel and after having a long stressful day, he was my waiter and was very attentive and recommended great drinks and fantastic food choices. He had been my waiter before on different occasions and he's always so pleasant, patient and kind. He is someone that will go far. Thanks so much Sean, you definitely turned my day around and made it wonderful! I will definitely always ask for him when he is there and I always let my guests know if they want awesome food and great customer service head to Applebee's Menifee and ask for Sean."
Theresa S.,"Perris, CA",0,13,22,5.0,10/5/2017,"We decided on Applebee's in Menifee for my birthday.  I'm so gad we did, the prices are great and the waiter we had was amazing!!!!  I never had an empty glass of tea. The restaurant was nice and clean and the food was yummy!!!  This is now our go to place.."
Andrew R.,"Riverside, CA",121,129,59,2.0,1/19/2017,The only good thing about this experience was the triple chocolate meltdown. The server was miserable and the food was terrible.
Tammy L.,"Menifee, CA",12,5,3,1.0,9/7/2017,"About 8 months ago, I went to Applebees with a party of 7 people. They informed me the wait would be up to an hour because they only had 1 table to accommodate but we could split the party into 2 and sit at opposite ends of the restaurant. I asked to speak with the manager and the nasty lady said, she's too busy. We left and went elsewhere. Fast forward to this morning/early afternoon. It's been a while and me and my husband just came from getting lab work, I had been fasting for 12 hours and hungry, he suggested we give Applebees another chance, maybe they got new staff...we walk in and it's not busy. There are approx 5 patrons and we stood at the waiting area 10 mins not being acknowledged or asked to sit. This place sucks and they should go out of business. My blood sugar was low and they are ridiculous, never giving them the time of day, ever again."
Liz B.,"Sun City, Menifee, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/19/2017,"second time around both times we've been here its been poor service and cold food, all along with a nasty steak. we tried to give it a second chance."
Alyssa U.,"San Diego, CA",8,13,,2.0,7/15/2017,"I asked for my steak medium rare and they brought it out medium well. The waitress knew it was over cooked and she said to me, "" do you want to order it rare so it comes out medium rare?"""
Bard M.,"Canyon Lake, CA",3,85,1,1.0,11/20/2016,"My wife and I came here to have a nice dinner out. My wife is on a restricted diet and other restaurants are great at accommodating her but this place is definitely not. I ordered a burger with lettuce and she ordered a steak. What we got was not worth what we paid. On top of that, our server, Joel, was the absolute worst! When you get a burger from other places, they give you a bunch of napkins. This guy did not. He didn't refill my drink and he didn't ask what restrictions my wife's diet included.  The management needs to step up their game here. Training your wait staff to be considerate of guest's needs is big. Not to mention having the staff knowledgeable about specific diets. This is our last time eating here and it makes us wonder about corporate stores in general.  If I could have not given the any stars, I would have."
Matt B.,"Temecula, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/13/2017,"First time curbside order, received unsatisfactory food, second time now 3 months later and got tarter sauce with my salad instead of blue cheese. Did not realize until I got home. Disappointment especially when options in Menifee are already limited, hope they improve with some training on customer service and quality."
JR H.,"Novato, CA",0,16,13,5.0,7/13/2017,"Came in and as soon as we sat down, the server asked if we would like something to drink. Which was great since the weather was hot outside. We received excellent service, the loaded pork chop and the burger my husband where so delicious and had great flavor. The times we have come here, we have always received great service."
Mia S.,"Perris, CA",30,14,2,3.0,7/8/2017,Happy hour awesome..... Watermelon. Sangria needs some real watermelon​..... For the most part its good.
Lma O.,"Mexicali, Mexico",0,26,23,2.0,9/18/2016,"Came here for dinner with my wife and son. I really only have one complaint and that's the server. She wasn't horrible per say, but she came around twice throughout our visit. I had to actually ask her to do things instead of being offered. Maybe she was having a bad day but I wasn't pleased with the lack of attentiveness. Food was alright. I'll probably avoid this location."
Marie M.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,8,2,5.0,9/22/2017,Jessica at the bar is fabulous and Alyssa is the greatest waitress   High 5 to both for making our evening
R.Scott H.,"Canyon Lake, CA",84,140,211,4.0,4/4/2016,We went to Applebee's for happy hour and sat in the bar. We had margaritas that were decently priced and pretty good. We also had the won ton tacos that were dang good. We also had the chicken wings and chips and spinach dip. The spinach dip tasted like it was frozen and warmed up but was just ok. The service on the other hand was spot on and management was more than accommodating . We will return to try some of the other bar fare
Cassie B.,"Menifee, CA",16,4,,1.0,2/27/2017,"Food was terrible  potatoe cold,steak was tough as rubber. Ordered medium rare. Waitress acted like it was a bother to serve us.  Won't be back."
Sean S.,"Menifee, CA",20,55,1,1.0,3/19/2017,"Glancing through a few other post's I have  noticed a recurring theme... Poor management.  I really do like to Yelp about chain restaurants...They are what they are food wise.  As far as customer service goes, some are better than others.  This particular ""Crapplebees"" is one of the bad ones.  My wife likes one of the salads they have here... Me, I would rather have soggy cat food."
Oscar T.,"Vista, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/9/2017,"This is my favorite restaurant to go out with my family and friends, sadly though I came to this Applebee's with my family. The service their was  quick, the waitress was kind and got seated in a clean booth. My brother ordered a whiskey burger and the burger was just ridiculous. The burger beef was too big for the bun and as soon he started eating it, it started to fall apart. I ordered chicken tenders from the $20 deal menu where you order some food and get a free entree. (That whiskey burger is also in the $20 deal.) As we were done eating, my brother had to use the restroom and I had just finished eating me meal. My brother came back from the bathroom and told me that he had puked in the bathroom. He told me that he thinks it was the burger because he felt really nauseous after taking four bites. As I finished, I too felt nauseous after eating. I was really disappointed with the food, the service was great but the food was terrible."
Antonio S.,"San Diego, CA",148,17,56,3.0,3/20/2017,its what you would expect from them. i wish i just got takeout. its not worth going to lunch alone there. the drink and tip put this in a range you dont want to pay. burger fries and soda shouldnt be $15.
Valencia P.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/7/2017,This place is disgusting. If I could give them 0 stars I would. My steak was uncooked and nothing how I ordered it to be. My Long Island was sour there was nothing sweet about it. The Service was very bad. Never again. This place is a straight waste of money. I advise you to not eat here unless you want to be upset.
Pablo H.,"Temecula, CA",142,2,2,1.0,11/22/2016,"Honestly doesn't even deserve one star, I don't normally do this but my family and I had by far the worst experience here. I've never had an experience like this in my life We arrived at this location a little after 8pm. Jeff was our waiter. My wife and I ordered drinks for ourselves and tea for our two kids. Also ordered a combo appetizer. Roughly thirty minutes go by before we address our waiter that we are ready to order (we had to ask in between ordering a second set of refills for our kids because he did not ask us if we were ready to order) We finally receive our appetizer along with a third round of refills. Two hours go by and we ask the hostess where our waiter is because we still haven't gotten our food, finally our waiter comes by and asks how we are doing. We tell him we've been here for two and a half hours and have not received our food. He says he's going to check.  Now I'm not one for walking out without paying but with refills and a appetizer spent over sixty dollars that's just insane! And still left with no food!! I'm not blaming our waiter or even the cooks but management for not taking initiative and training their employees properly. Along with this review I will also be filing a formal complaint to corporate!"
Cindy W.,"Carlsbad, CA",2232,1937,4290,4.0,9/14/2014,"Another business added to this city, can't say it's a bad thing that they're bringing business and jobs to Menifee. Opens at 11:00 am, you can come here for brunch, lunch or dinner.  We wanted to support the place even though we've been to an AppleBees before and pretty much know what the food is like.  I was impressed though, I must say, that while we were waiting to be seated, they were offering everyone frozen strawberry lemonades and even seconds if you wanted some. The hostess was very friendly with my kids and she seemed like she enjoys being at work, something you want to see in a host.  We got seated and realized the place isn't that big at all, but the ambiance of dedication to Menifee was very interesting and kind of cool. They had these computer pads at the table for you to look at the menu, play games (for $0.99), reorder your drinks or even pay your bill. Nice touch, Applebees!  Our waiter was Jimmy, he was nice and knowledgeable of the menu but clearly was nervous, that was fine with me. Still great service! He made sure to put in our entree order a few minutes after putting in our appetizer so that we would have time to eat our appetizer. Which we got the honey barbeque bone-in wings, not bad, but not great either. Maybe we should have went with the buffalo wings instead.  For drinks, I got the frozen strawberry lemonade because it was so hot outside and it was that good, I had to order it. My husband got the blue agave margarita and that wasn't too bad, not strong though.  For my entree, I got the margarita queso chicken and shrimp, very good, but the chicken was a bit dry and the shrimp was cold. Hence why i took a star off. My husband ordered the 7-oz sirloin with mashed potatoes and vegetables, it was good. My daughter got the corn dog and applesauce packet to share with her sister.  Food wasn't spectacular or anything but it wasn't bad either. Service made up for it and I really like the ambiance in there. Good going, Applebees! Welcome to Menifee!"
Stefanie E.,"Menifee, CA",0,24,3,4.0,3/11/2017,"I like this location. Everyone is super nice and the food is delicious as well. They do seem to always be busy which bodes well for them but not for speed of service. Really, my only problem is parking. The parking lot is so tiny for the amount of businesses there. It's hard to maneuver most of the time and you end up parking in the boonies or by other stores."
Sabe N.,"Sun City, CA",0,19,8,4.0,3/3/2017,This undated is mostly for Channel . We used the Car to go service and her customer service is beyond what you expect at Curbside service . Thank You Channel your service makes us want to go more often . Salad was good as well
Wendy W.,"Sun City, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/9/2016,"This was truly the worst service I've had in a really long time. I sat there for an eternity waiting for someone to even acknowledge me, and when my order was finally taken and I got served, neither my waitress nor any other server ever came by to check on me. I had planned to order (at least) another drink, some bread to eat with my meal and a meal to go, but I was so mad by the time she finally asked if I wanted anything else (after sitting there with an empty glass and my plate pushed away for, again, a ridiculously long time), I just wanted out of there. I asked for a comment card and she said they don't have any. I've been to other Applebee's and have always been treated well. I won't be coming back to this one,  though. P.S. I overheard the table next to me complaining to the manager when I sat down, so I don't think it's just me.  : ("
Abigail C.,"Anaheim, CA",330,158,131,2.0,10/11/2015,"They had a promo up that said they have a new drink: the Mango Margarita.  If the server does not offer it, then you get a free appetizer on your next visit.  At the end of our meal, our server still had not offered it so when we got our receipt, we asked for the free appetizer. She looked at us like a deer in the headlights, then started explaining that they had a new drink. Afterwards, she just looked at us and asked if we wanted to order one. We were like no our meal is done... is this you offering? We would like our free appetizer please! She then looked at us irritated and went to get the manager to give us our free appetizer voucher.... Awkward!!!! Applebees is mediocre food.  Their prices are decent but the food is nothing special. This location is fairly new so the interior is nice but the service usually sucks.  They usually serve the regulars well (and it really shows) and everyone else usually gets put on the back burner.    Many other restaurants within a mile (In n Out or Red Robin if you want a burger, Texas roadhouse for ribs and steak, BJ'S brewery for cocktails, beer and appetizers) so I would recommend going elsewhere!"
Alyssa G.,"Murrieta, CA",241,2,1,1.0,1/21/2017,"The service was literally horrible. Server took 20 minutes to even give us menu's. Had to keep finding another server to let us order drinks and food, since ours was MIA. She looked just as miserable as our server. Manager delivered our food.. He didn't smile once either. Food was not very good. Not eating here again."
FoodyNews 1.,"Temecula, CA",24,89,32,4.0,3/14/2017,"JoJo made  ABZ GREAT again.  Other STARS are Jennifer and Beth.... last nite I had server JoJo ROCKED, tall dude with cool glasses.   Actually he always rocks it. What I  asked for he delievered 100% right from the beginning.  the $25 deal.  with a tad more salsa with my spinach dip and minced garlic ,  I casually had my appitiser and when I was ready I had him fire my main meal, perfe..ct timing, also my special Parmesan  cheese sauce came right out with my meal and a lot of it as I asked so it covered alllll my bites, not just a tiny dollop.  The manager also had me try the asian soy sauce, wow yummmmmmy mixing the two, also as it hits the red hot iron plate it SIZZLES STEAMS yummmmy goodness into the air...foodie aroma therapy on my chix n shrimp.   Only do this if you Love  RICH Coastal restaurants. otherwise just get the kinda bland reg style. UPDATE LOW FAT STYLE, under 200 calories and 2 gram fat if even that.  swap out potatoes for FIRE GRILLED veggies,  also instead of sauteed mushrooms have raw, then pour the soy sauce over it all and it caramelizes to TASTY YUM YUM...  NO BUTTER AT ALL."
ashley a.,"Menifee, CA",0,11,4,5.0,8/16/2017,Cam & Sean run the bar great! They always make it a fun and enjoyable environment. Food is amazing and drinks are always nice and cold.
Tim M.,"Temecula, CA",264,248,2112,1.0,10/5/2016,"Don't waste your money or time. Food is over seasoned and horrible. Go to BJ's it may cost a little more, but it's worth it."
Jessica S.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",102,34,1,1.0,11/26/2016,This has got to be the worst Applebee's I have visited.  The service was horrible. They took forever to bring our drinks.  My husband ordered a beer but he got mostly foam. We ordered appetizers and asked two different waitresses to bring some plates out....took them almost 15 minutes to bring them to us. The food was horrible.  We ordered boneless buffalo wings...they  were extremely dry.  I  had to ask for buffalo sauce on the side.  Fries were cold.  I do not recommend  this place at all.
Ruby H.,"Menifee, CA",16,58,44,4.0,11/4/2016,"Great food: steak was cooked medium just like we wanted, bbq ribs were falling off the bone & full of flavor. Service was great. Thank you Kelly for keeping our drinks filled & bringing everything so quickly."
William R.,"Menifee, CA",23,13,,2.0,7/29/2016,Slow service Smaller than expected portion Will not return.  Over priced for the quality.
Luis P.,"Temecula, CA",8,252,20,4.0,4/13/2017,"After visiting, and enduring, and finally regretting several mediocre franchises, I must say our outing as a family to our local Applebee's was a rather pleasant one. From the service, by the very capable Brittney, to the food from the 2 for $20 menu, everyone was at the very least, content. Even the wallet. After reading several bad reviews, I was singing the song from the Clash: ""Should I stay, or should I go?"" Well, happy we all went. Place was busy at around 7:30 PM, and everyone seemed to be enjoying the time. Food from the limited, but none the less, very acceptable menu was certainly good enough for our hungry crowd. Even though we were only 5, we ordered 3 of the 2 for $20, so some food returned home with us for a later midnight snack! Only water was asked for, and even that was nicely delivered with Brittany's friendly smile. The bill came out to around $67.41?, which was kind of enigmatic, and had me trying to decipher the actual tax being charged, but now a days there are so many surcharges that I simply took it with a grain of salt. 17% was given to our server, surely deserved, and we walked away $74+ less. Is Applebee's on the rebound? 4 Stars."
