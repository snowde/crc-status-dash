Maria H.,"Perris, CA",1,7,4,1.0,12/30/2015,"Check your account if you paid with a card this weekend our waitress tipped herself  $10 and  $30 on my cousin's check she turned a 5 into an 8, I always cross out the tip part on the check when I'm gona tip cash so theirs no way she could of gotten confused."
Jeff D.,"Menifee, CA",76,21,,1.0,4/18/2015,$4 for a strawberry Lemonade? With no refills?  Really? Service is slow and food is overpriced for what you get.
Eric S.,"Tustin, CA",0,13,10,5.0,12/10/2014,Wedding dinner with wife and kids. The crew (elana) and manager (moses) were very good and very friendly I will definitely come back. Oh food was very good too.
Alex C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,43,11,2.0,5/25/2016,"My Mom, my friend and I went here and we couldn't believe that the food was like microwave food on a plate. There was absolutely no flavor to anything what so ever. I mean I can say I didn't get sick, which is great and I'm happy about which is why it got 2 stars. The food was cooked right but somehow all the taste was cooked out of the food. Oh well I was happy to try it but I will not be back. There isn't much more I can write about this place."
Tommie S.,"Temecula, CA",47,6,,1.0,2/25/2015,Service was rough. Looked like the staff was having a party at a booth in the middle of the restaurant which included the manager. Bummer.
Chassidy G.,"Tampa, FL",94,56,24,5.0,8/8/2015,"Always seated quickly, wait staff is very friendly, quick to fix mistakes on order, manager is always very nice, food is always good."
Christopher C.,"Menifee, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/11/2015,"Nice, Applebee's. You offer free meals for veterans on 11/11, then closed all day!  I feel so honored."
Jacob F.,"Sun City, CA",19,3,,1.0,11/11/2015,"This place is absolutely disgusting food wise and service had been mediocre the two times I've been. It's even worse than your typical applebees. Eat anywhere else. When this place fails, hopefully we'll get something good put in."
Irene F.,"Torrance, CA",0,5,,5.0,6/3/2016,"I was surprised to read negative reviews here. We went to Menifee to visit our friends that moved there recently and went out for dinner to this Applebee's. We do not have one close to Torrance where we leave. The service was excellent, the server was quick and brought kids meal first even we forgot to ask him for it. He checked on us several times to make sure if we needed anything. He did forgot to bring my husband's salad but apologized several times and it was on a house. When we went it was really busy and our group was not small. The food was great. It was tasty and fresh. We tried Applebee's in Colorado first and love it since then. We are happy we can go to this one when we visit our friends."
Jim H.,"Menifee, CA",1,51,13,5.0,5/5/2015,"I love this place. I am a happy hour type of person.  I frequent the Murrieta location and this location is no different.. Cold large beers, great atmosphere , friendly staff. The bartender had a busy night when I was there with friends, she got the bills mixed up and we paid someone else's bill.  Other than that ,all was good.  For a chain,  for some reason it  feels like a local watering hole.  Always a top choice to visit when I have the money to splurge a bit."
Stephen E.,"Wildomar, CA",8,56,,2.0,1/1/2015,"Great bar service. They made sure our drinks were refilled and were taken care of. Food quality needs to be adjusted. To think I don't know what fresh chicken tastes like. To insult my taste buds with frozen chicken in a penne pasta with very little cheese and no sauce. The pasta seemed to not been drained properly. Whoever is behind this culinary mess needs to rethink what they are  serving. The salads were not much to talk about.  The bar staff was very helpful. However, the service level can not overcome  the need of quality food. We will not be returning."
Veronica R.,"Winchester, CA",18,40,66,2.0,12/9/2014,"Two stars for service our waitress was friendly, but no stars for food. It is edible if you enjoy a greasy mess. And being literally starving at the time ANYTHING I ate should have tasted delicious. Looking back I was better off walking across the parking lot to flame broiler or jersey mikes.. My stomach hates me right now. I think I will stick to healthier options."
Carrissa W.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",21,18,5,5.0,2/24/2015,"My husband & I have been here a few time. We got really lucky on our first visit because our service was amazing! Our server was Nathan. We request to sit in his section if he's working. He told us that we could get unlimited games for our son for $.99 cents  instead of paying per game. He told us based off our request for food what we could do to make it cheaper. We just felt like he really enjoyed his job & went above & beyond to make sure we were happy. We both worked in the restaurant business in the past , so it's really hard not to be critics when we eat out. We were just amazed by the great service! Food wise: we usually get the appetizer that you get to choose your items & we like the wanton tacos, boneless hot wings & spinach artichoke dip. The house salads are really good as well!"
Sarah G.,"Mineola, TX",31,68,109,1.0,10/27/2014,"Well; we finally tried Applebee's here in town and are less than impressed. Which should be expected for a chain such as this. We ordered the buffalo wing appetizer which came out very quick but I had to ask for extra hot sauce twice and the waitress didn't bring it out until our entrees were done. She left to get us water and seemed to forget; because I watched her walk all over the restaurant, the bar, in the back etc. and still never brought us water. We ordered the fish and chips (lame) and the cowboy burger (double lame, Red Robin is SO much better). I don't think we'll be going back."
Sandy B.,"Sun City, CA",0,9,,2.0,9/30/2016,"We went to Applebee's tonight.  We always go in the side entrance because I am handicapped.  I noticed several booths available in the back and asked if we could sit at a table in the back.  As an aside, whenever I have gone with a friend in the past, we have always been told that we can sit in the back.  Not so this time.  Basically we were told we would have to wait at the entrance because there were quite a few people ahead of us.  We were offered a booth on the bar side and took that.  Mind you, we arrived at 7:40 p.m.  Absolutely NO ONE was seated at those back booths the entire time we were there, and we didn't leave until 9:20.  So much for trying to accommodate a handicapped person.  They were actually willing to have us walk out and go elsewhere.  Secondly, I ordered the grilled vegetables as a side dish and was given 2 huge pieces of squash and zucchini.  It was as if the cook cut each piece of squash into thirds and I got 1/3 of each.  I have never seen grilled squash served like that.  I am quite sure I will not be returning to this restaurant again."
Mel D.,"Sun City, CA",0,3,,2.0,10/6/2014,"1) We tried the NEW Applebees at Menifee, and was overwhelmed by this big square  SPORTS BAR. Like the entire focal point was this noisy BAR! It was too LOUD... too many GAMES on.. everywhere...  2) The menu was plentiful, but limited in sides unless you PAID for a green or any veggie with your meal....  That was dumb. The ""wedge"" of plain old iceberg lettuce was 5 bucks! I was stunned. 3) The appetizers are VERY pricey too. 4) Got the Double Whiskey Steak... basically 2 pieces slightly bigger than a silver dollar... along with red mashed potatoes. The potatoes were outstanding. Thank you, But the steak(s) were tough... and dry.  Don't think we'll be going back....  it's basically overpriced bar food. If you want to be able to talk, and not surrounded by a thousand screens playing, look elsewhere."
Johnny L.,"Eastvale, CA",0,37,17,5.0,7/28/2015,We went here for the first time recently and the atmosphere was nice and quiet. It was very clean. The staff was very professional. The food was excellent. It was a very enjoyable experience! We will be going back there for sure!  Good job team Applebee's
Thomas G.,"Hemet, CA",0,32,4,5.0,4/17/2016,Took advantage of their 2 for $20 menu. Had the lemon chicken and whisky chicken. Delicious. Ashley is a great server.
S K.,"Wildomar, CA",12,26,10,1.0,9/16/2014,"Finally. A new place to eat in Menifee. Lets give it a shot. Really?? I mean..REALLY?!  Talk about  bombing a first impression. I'll chalk a little off to this being a newly opened location but being in the food service industry myself and knowing how chain restaurants supposedly ""train"" and ""screen"" before they hire I'm not giving any more than a half a star leeway. So..if I could..this review would only get half a star. After sitting at the bar for about 40 mins my roommates' and my food finally showed up....COLD. Plate was hot though. That's a neat trick that I could teach you but I'm a better person than to do that to my guests. Veggies were thrown into boiling water for 30 secs and served..hard...and raw. Chicken was cold and my roommates supposed ""medium"" steak was not medium. Only reason we both stayed and not complained is we had not eaten all day and were in no mood to wait another 40 mins for fresh food and then worry about what the dishwasher/cook did to our food once he/she heard we complained. After throwing our money on the counter hinting we wanted a fast exit..it took the 2 ""trying to look busier than they actually were"" bartender/waitresses about another 15 mins to finally cash us out.  In closing...save your money..wait and try this place in a couple of months and see if the training/food improves."
Aaron H.,"Hemet, CA",12,44,432,5.0,1/21/2015,"Having gone to my fair share of Applebee's, this one is easily the best. I know it had a rocky start after opening but they've definitely ironed out some kinks. The food was incredibly fresh (it's been a long time since I had to wait for a burger to cool off) and the drinks were very good. Service was fantastic and accurate most of all. It was a very pleasant visit, Brie was our server and she truly earned her keep. I will definitely come all the way to Menifee to eat rather than the local Applebee's."
