Augusta F.,"Sun City, CA",5,15,,2.0,9/13/2014,"Came here for dinner the day after the grand opening. Although the service was good (which is the only reason for the 2 stars) the food was HORRIBLE. First off, my husband ordered a 4 cheese pasta/chicken dish that tasted like frozen food and had no cheese flavor whatsoever. I ordered the chicken strips meal and the fries that came with it were burnt and tasted like someone dumped a bucket of salt on them. I couldn't even eat it. We didn't complain because we knew they just opened and the restaurant was busy so we figured the kitchen staff was overwhelmed. Still though, we'll probably never eat here again."
Flo S.,"Quail Valley, CA",0,22,1,5.0,4/4/2015,"came here for lunch today and had the fish and chips they were great also had the spinach and artichoke dip , the only complaint that I have is I am almost sure that the serving size of the spinach and artichoke appetizer was much smaller along with the very small cup of salsa ( like a shot glass of salsa) ,..... the thing that most inspired me to write this review and turn a 4 star review to a 5 star was the staff... the host ( I believe his name was Martel ) was excellent he was very friendly and was by far one of the best hosts that I have been greeted by in an establishment in a long time, also our waitress Beth was very attentive and also made this trip to my local applebee's extremely pleasant .  Great Job, I will be back soon and I hope that the management gives kudos to their staff. Well deserved."
Major P.,"Sun City, CA",4,7,,1.0,9/21/2014,Waiting...... Been here for over a half hour??? Perhaps next time they plan a new restaurant tables/ chairs should be considered? This is horrible!!
Mark A.,"Menifee, CA",0,2,2,2.0,10/25/2014,Dont go for football sundays
Laura P.,"Sun City, CA",160,53,11,3.0,11/10/2014,I've only been to this location once and it wasn't very good.  Our order was messed up and the food was mediocre even for an Applebee's.
Daniel M.,"Sun City, CA",5,4,5,3.0,9/12/2014,"Nice place, lots of TVs. Open till Midnight or later everyday, that's a plus! Everyone is very friendly, but with Texas Roadhouse across the street, it's hard to enjoy the quality of Applebee's food."
C W.,"Sun City, CA",0,80,23,4.0,2/21/2015,"The place is fairly new & squeaky clean.. Staff very welcoming. Has all the new stuff coming to all the restaurants including ""Ted"" a tablet you can order from if waitress is busy or pay your bill. It even has games for the kids ($.99-charge for the all the games). The food was what I have come to expect, fresh wholesome food. I had the new grilled club (Turkey Ham & Bacon) with French onion soup for 8.99 - Yum..! Love their lunch specials... You can pick 2 items from different priced lists for a lunch special (6.99 7.99 or 8.99) Lots to chose from & you can mix & match to create your own perfect combo. Lots of flat screens to watch your fav. sporting event on. Look forward to coming back for dinner. Am so glad we have another Great restaurant in town to choose from. This Applebee's would be a great choice for any occasion"
Jess R.,"Menifee, CA",1,14,8,5.0,2/28/2016,"I came with a party of 9 on a Sunday afternoon. We were seated right away and waited on immediately. Our waiter, Michael, was absolutely fantastic. He was so sweet! All our orders were correct and the food and drinks came out quickly. He received some assistance from the woman with short dark hair and the dark skinned male. They were both also extremely great at serving and customer service. My whole family had nothing but good things to say about our entire experience. Very impressed. And love the pictures of Menifee around he restaurant. Really makes you feel at home."
Tara C.,"Sun City, CA",7,27,1,3.0,12/30/2014,"Our food came out hot and tasted good. Our service was not the best with our waitress not really caring about our table. I will say that the other waiters and manager did pitch in and helped us out with any questions we had. Overall, it is an ok place to eat"
Cynthia G.,"Murrieta, CA",0,8,,1.0,2/1/2015,My friend and I came in at 10:20pm. We sat at the bar area and waited 10 minutes and servers don't even approach us. Two of the waitresses glanced over but continued to roll napkins and the other continued to talk to the bartender. One server heard us talk about not having our order taken yet and didn't say anything to her coworkers. Its our first and last time going to Apple bees. And we will never come again. We should have checked all the other yelp reviews before coming. We decided to go to Bjs instead.
Jess M.,"Murrieta, CA",0,67,,1.0,5/18/2015,"Count your tip money, then grab a lemon with your filthy hands and throw it in my water? Wonder if she passed the food handler's test? Lost my appetite. Enough said."
Allie K.,"Murrieta, CA",85,3,,1.0,6/22/2015,Never got a chance to eat here. We waited in front for over 10 minutes with nobody helping us. Just got stares from staff and even a manager. There was nobody else waiting. We figure if service started out this bad the rest would be worse. So after almost 15 minutes of waiting we just walked next door to five guys and enjoyed an amazing burger
Stephanie R.,"Sun City, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/22/2015,"Applebees has sure gone downhill.  We thought we would try the new Applebees in our area and give them one more try.  It was AWFUL, the food, the service.  There were several servers and even when we went early to miss the crowd we still had bad service. We had to wait and ask several different times and different people for extra napkins and even for our check.   Their old menu seemed to have better choices it used to be my favorite restaurant. On this visit I ordered the mac & cheese with chicken and it was so sweet I couldn't eat it and left most of it.  It was like they poured too much sauce and it overpowered everything else.  They might do better at happy hour for drinks and appetizers."
Jameela A.,"Menifee, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/16/2015,"Came into Applebee's on my BIRTHDAY expecting to get a drink and appetizers before I hit the bar however Natalie and Leslie ruined that for me!!!!! I waited over 10 minutes before even being acknowledged by Natalie and once I did she asked if we had been helped. We said no and she said that sucks let me get someone and walked away. This is not the first time me and my friend have dealt with Natalie and her rude remark therefore we decided to leave. As we we're leaving we walked back to get her name and another waitress who was laughing at the matter, and we're told ""make sure you spell my name right "". Meaning this review!!!! They have forced us to not come back and to spread the word about the horrible service that goes on at this location."
Marjie T.,"Menifee, CA",0,43,,3.0,10/18/2014,"In to the bar tonight for a quick bite.  It was very crowded and we weren't in the mood to stand around and wait.  Made friends with the bartender and our wine and beer were good.  We are headed to Outback tomorrow night so no red meat.  We both ended up with entree salads.  A Thai shrimp salad and a chicken Caesar. I didn't care for the chicken, it was dry and salty.  The dressing was no where close to tasting like what caesar is supposed to taste like.  More like a tangy ranch.  Disappointing.  Husband was fine with Thai shrimp salad.  We will go back and explore the menu further.  Caesar is my favorite salad, hope I can get past that."
Michael P.,"Riverside, CA",0,41,10,2.0,12/12/2014,"Sorry for the 2 stars however I don't know how to put 1 1/2 stars? This is our 3rd time here since the opening, the first time there were a few mistakes which we figured was because they were brand new, the second time not only were our meals wrong but when I sent mine back it took forever to come back and was still wrong. The party of 3  that sat behind us on the second time, their whole order was incorrect and one of them never got the entree ? The waitress kept offering them appetizers in place of their food, good thing they got a free desert !! We thought we would give it another try tonight , and once again one of our meals was totally wrong. During our meal we heard numerous tables complain about their orders ? My wife had a margarita and it came in a mixed drink glass (tall & skinny ) and was way under par, I ordered iced tea and I had to continually asked for refills ? You couldn't have ordered a easier entree then mine to make and it was so wrong that I changed to something different. I settled for the (new)  peppered shrimp and broccoli pasta plate , OH NO ! Never again! Seriously the junior Master Chefs on TV. ( 8-12) year olds would have given more flavor then that. I find it hard to believe that the chefs or the person that expedites taste the food prior to leaving the kitchen. Just so everyone knows we are big fans of Applebee's just not this one. Hey chefs learn how to blacken shrimp, it's not just covering them in chili powder !! Merry Christmas......"
Jill W.,"SUN CITY, CA",69,11,10,1.0,10/5/2015,Very upsetting. All servers kept saying they were new. It took a hour and half for my friends food and my food came 15 minutes later even after I cancelled it. The server was very polite. Informed us it was his first nite with no training. Really Applebee s menifee mgmt get together!!
Rogelio B.,"San Jacinto, CA",0,9,,5.0,11/30/2014,Leslie is the best bartender. Simple as that. Always come back and feel treated like a friend. Thanks Leslie!
Taylor H.,"Temecula, CA",13,17,3,1.0,1/1/2015,"My family and I went there tonight; my mom was really looking forward to enjoying a nice meal at the new Applebee's!!! Unfortunately, the dining experience was not great. The food was mediocre at best, and the service was just terrible. I believe our waiter was overbooked with tables, but that didn't overrule the neglect of service we received. He wasn't very attentive at all, and my brothers girlfriends meal was left in the back while we were all waiting for it, so we could eat.I highly recommend going to a different Applebee's if this is the restaurant of your choice.   Also to add, my brother accidentally left his phone at the table when we were done, he came back twice and even spoke to the manager to find it. The manager seems very bothered and did not care to be honest, finally after the third time going back to the table a busser found the phone under the table.This one desperately needs a turnaround, it's sad because it's brand new."
Keith H.,"Battle Creek, MI",0,9,6,5.0,11/11/2014,Great service my waiter was Joshua and he was outstanding. I also noticed the manager Moses was going out of his way to ensure everyone had great service.
