Erin R.,"Corona, CA",0,13,,1.0,12/27/2016,"I usually enjoy Applebee's, especially the wonton tacos which are my favorite. However, this is the WORST Applebee's there is. The service is terrible, and the food is not cooked properly or with any care for the customer what so ever. We tried to go there twice in one week and both times left angry.  The first time we were seated fairly quickly, but then we just sat there unattended for 15 minutes. At no point did we see a waiter, and certainly I wasn't going to continue to wait around with my 3 children while no one cared about our business for their restaurant. We walked out without ever taking even a drink order. So another few days go by and I really wanted the wonton tacos and they have a burger special on Mondays, so we decided to give them one more shot. There was a 20 minute wait, with half the restaurants tables empty (This is obviously a staffing problem they need to fix). Then we finally get seated only to wait and wait and wait. After 20+ minutes I saw a table seated after us take their order, and that was the last straw. I talked to the manager and he sent over a waitress to take our order. After placing our order she was nice enough to give us free chips and salsa for waiting, however the food took an astronomical amount of time to receive. We ordered 3 appetizers, and a burger yet it took well over 30 minutes to receive them. Once we did receive the food the boneless wings had Asian zing sauce instead of honey bbq and luckily I thought it looked weird and tasted if before I gave it to my 6 year old!! She cant handle the heat, and I would have gone through the roof with anger. They exchanged those for honey bbq after a little bit of a wait, and then the shrimp was cold and OLD but that never seemed to come back out ever again. Nothing we ordered came out right besides the burger. Everything took forever, and I can guarantee we will not go back. Next time I want applebees I will gladly travel to another city to eat there."
May K.,"Temecula, CA",0,11,,5.0,10/26/2016,I just left and I am writing this review because we are so satisfied with the service and food are awesome!! Let me tell you how nice our waiter Zach was!!  He is so bubbly nice friendly guy who make sure we have what we need every time he comes around. We never even once had to ask for anything and we really appreciate his excellent customer service!!  We live in Temecula but we don't want to go to Temecula one and come all way to Menifee location for great service and food taste better also!! Thank you Zach for being so awesome!!
Natasha O.,"Oceanside, CA",172,8,,2.0,12/1/2016,"The ONLY Reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because our server was amazing and so was the hostess and some of the staff!! The food was terrible! I'm not the biggest fan of Applebees, however, they have a select few go to menu items I can choose when I do go if a friend wants to eat there! This one is in Menifee is by far the worst one I've EVER Been too and I will NEVER eat at Applebee's again!!!"
A L.,"Menifee, CA",0,4,18,1.0,6/5/2017,"Went to apple bees in menifee for the first time yesterday. Was disappointed. Our server only came to our table a grand total of 4 times in over an hour visit. (would of been shorter had he came to serve us. 1- take drink order, 2-order and I ordered a lemonade at this point but never got it , he even said if he has time he'll bring it over. The restaurant was not busy (7pm dinner). 3 check back 10 mins after food arrived and only 4th time bc we ordered our desert off the table console since he never came back. We were out of drinks had to ask another server to get it. Had to ask the bar for extra spoons we already asked for. 3/4 of our food was cold (cold enough to give it straight to my 1.5 year old). The hot one was on the skillet. My mac and cheese was dried out on the sides. The manager visited the tables around us but not us. After there were hardly any people inside and the server and manager were stating they were getting fresher beef for the ribs and how they just got it in. Meaning my father in law was right, his seemed a day old and just added more sauce for today."
Odie O.,"San Diego, CA",2,1003,63,2.0,2/19/2016,"Excellent service, nice atmosphere, great lunch deals! Mac and cheese with honey tenders tasted fantastic and a large portion too, clubhouse grill is delightfully crunchy and filling. Food was super fast, car to go is an interesting option as well. Honey chicken tenders were tasty but we both got indigestion and tummy trouble after eating them."
Alicia F.,"San Bernardino, CA",41,11,3,1.0,9/6/2016,"Food was the worst I have had in ages. You would think food would be suitable as it is a chain....definitely not so. Potatoes were one step away from rancid. Manager assured me that the oil was due to be changed Tuesday...guess what today is Tuesday and you got it old oil. Reassured I won't get sick. Tell that to my nauseous stomach. Be sure to come here if you are one food poisoning episode from the perfect dress size. Would give zero stars if able to. Waiter was attentive, place was practically empty, wait was long."
Maribel S.,"Menifee, CA",6,24,13,2.0,2/14/2016,"Customer Service : consistantly good, adequately friendly server. Atmosphere : typical, restaurant/bar type Cleanliness : adequate  Food: my particular dish - cold ribs on top, warm ribs below; mashed potatoes average; sons cheeseburger appeared dry, appetizers (pork nachos & chicken wanton tacos) were decent; sons grilled cheese average. SUMMARY: When it first opened,  food was ""surprisingly"" good. Quotes around surprisingly because after a few more times of going, this Applebee's met the reputation of every Applebee's in the State of CA that I've particularly been to (and I've been to quite a few, hoping for a different /better food experience). I went tonight because my first option was exceedingly busy & I didn't feel like waiting."
Heather D.,"Menifee, CA",18,10,4,1.0,9/28/2016,"We usually love this place, but tonight was by far the worst experience we've ever had. The waiter was not all that attentive, and was very forgetful. The steak came out burned when ordered medium. It took over 10 min to even get checked out. It will be a long while before we return."
Mary Ann G.,"Menifee, CA",0,2,3,1.0,7/9/2016,"Ordered food to go and it came with a fly!! I was almost all the way done eating my food when I noticed the dead fly, so who knows what else I ate besides pasta!! Disgusting!!  Not only that, every time I order a blondie its always hard as a rock. Will probably not be coming to Applebee's again. Team Chilis all the way!!"
Jennifer M.,"Carson, CA",6,4,4,5.0,8/26/2016,"I don't understand why people are saying their service is slow. If you went during a time where it's crowded, of course service is going to be slow. I went for dinner at 9:30pm and obviously that's not rush dinner time so my servers were very attentive and nice. Happy hour food and drinks were delicious! We ordered over both the server and the machine and the food made it a decent amount of waiting time."
Hehica E.,"Bellflower, CA",3,2,2,2.0,1/9/2016,"Horrible, horrible! Even if you're starving DO NOT come here! Thank goodness I had order my 5 year old's food before we even got our drinks and her food came an hour an half before our waitress came to say that our food would be here shortly...really?!? Really?!? We waited to be seated for only 20 minutes and 3 times longer for our food. Other than molasses slow for our food and some issue with the back making the orders wrong the waitress was very pleasant!"
Nick B.,"Quail Valley, CA",0,12,3,2.0,10/13/2015,"Beware. On 3 different occasions we've specifically ordered the happy hour margarita and even specifically told the waitress ""we want the happy hour margarita special"", and despite that, were charged for the full price margarita on our bill. All 3 times I've had to ask them to adjust the bill.  I do not think this is a mistake, I think it's a purposeful error.   I finally figured out that the happy hour margarita comes in a different glass, and the 4th time it happened I had them switch it out. This is not an accident, so if you visit the bar section during happy hour, make sure to check your bill."
Chris M.,"Temecula, CA",1,15,,2.0,9/4/2015,"I know they're a huge chain that focuses more on low cost than the best experience, but I've always been impressed every time I've gone. This is the first time I went to this location though and I was pretty disappointed.  First off, the service was way too slow. It's all bar food so it doesn't take long to cook, and we weren't there at a really busy time so there really was no reason for everything to take so long to come out. Our waitress was nice enough about it but just didn't seem to really care much.  Was unimpressed with the shrimp salad I got, maybe seafood just isn't Applebees thing because I do usually get something simpler like a burger. But if it's on the menu it shouldn't be disappointing, and it definitely was.  Will definitely be returning to an applebees at some point, but probably not this one."
Anthony A.,"Riverside, CA",63,61,183,1.0,6/23/2016,"The service here is constantly bad. I've been here several times and I've not had decent service once. I've timed it and had to wait up to 20 min for drinks while I can clearly see a manager and multiple servers standing around the bar. I wouldn't mind if the place was busy, but when there are 4 people at the bar and its 11:00 pm you would think the service would be a bit faster. I would personally avoid this place, but options are limited in Menifee. The quality of the food is good, can't really complain about that. Bottom line is service sucks! Updated!!!!! Back again since Menifee is limited on restaurants. Nothing has changed, service still sucks, drinks are a joke, and now if you want to order happy hour you must order a drink. Lucky for this place, this is a small town and we don't have a lot of options."
Torrey H.,"Menifee, CA",0,13,1,2.0,10/19/2015,"I went to this Applebee's when it first opened here in Menifee. The service was so bad. We basically never saw our waitress and my drink never got refilled. They were allowing a child (who even knows where her parents were) run around the restaurant yelling. They simply just smiled and let her go around.  The menu sucks, frankly. I don't eat meat and there is only one item I could get without meat. The meal was nothing too special once it came out."
Shannon Z.,"Temecula, CA",0,10,3,5.0,2/17/2017,I have to say we got the best service at dinner tonight ! Our servers name was Ashley W . Every time we go in we request Ashley and she does an awesome job. She is our favorite server out of everywhere we eat. We live in to Temecula but drive all the way to Menifee just because she is there. She always provides excellent service and takes great care of us. Even my  3 year old daughter loves her and knows her by name. I wish they had a server like her at every restaurant! ! ! We need more Ashleys in the restaurant business. If you're eating at Applebee's definitely request ashley W as your server. Applebee's if you're reading this you need to keep her a song as you can !  She is a gem.
Barbara Z.,"New York, NY",492,206,130,2.0,5/26/2015,I've been here a few times. The service staff is friendly but slow.  The food is just terrible! It doesn't live up to the standards of Applebees at all.  I'm very disappointed and wouldn't recommend this restaurant.
Samantha B.,"Menifee, CA",8,10,12,1.0,5/9/2016,"The only good thing about this place is the happy hour, the food here is just trash. I'd rather go to Chili's"
Bill L.,"Sun City, CA",0,7,1,3.0,7/15/2016,Service not to bad  but food served cold and incomplete  steamed were hot all side cold.    Won't bring the family here again.
Brenda B.,"Menifee, CA",42,53,53,2.0,5/4/2015,"Two stars because of the good happy hour. $3.75 for an adios or a Long Island?! Yes please! But the food is okay. If I wasn't lazy I could go get some Tyson Any'tizers from the frozen food section, throw that shit in the oven, and I will have the exact same wings as them. The spinach and artichoke dip was pretty good. Did you actually make that? Because the salsa next to it tastes like Tostito's salsa. Lol Applebee's stop."
