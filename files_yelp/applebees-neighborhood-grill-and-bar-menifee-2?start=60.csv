Gaby T.,"Riverside, CA",280,11,3,1.0,5/14/2015,1 star because the happy hour drinks are good. We sat in a booth in bar area 3rd times the charm last time my hot wings where cold literally under cooked. That was 2 weeks ago. Last night my boyfriend's food was cold and they brought the food and appetizers and my salad all at the same time my food sat there and got cold. His breadstick wasn't even warm he sent back the food and they microwaved it brought it back the fresh tomatoes on the pasta where now microwaved instead of making him new dish. 20 min later they bring him a new breadstick. Oh and didn't finish my salad there was someone's hair in my salad I was so grossed out the manager took it off my bill but all together we decided to drive farther for better service. And the waitress wouldn't even come by to check on drinks. Horrible service. Never going back again.
Heidi S.,"Murrieta, CA",34,5,,1.0,5/24/2015,Been here a few times and always had good service and good food.....tonight on other hand was awful and of course we had 2 small kids with us. Waitress seemed to get lost at the beginning and she assured us she was going to take good care of us...she screwed up the order and forgot to put my son's order in so when food came out he sat there and watched us eat.  We had to ask the 2 different hosts to check  2nd time they got manager. Our waitress  came over to ask how things were and asked where his food was and she said would check on it..she proceed to turn around and take another tables.  Food wasn't even that good as it usually is.. If we ever go back I will not sit in her area... By the way you order spicy pickles....not pickles just cucumbers with tons of onions
Cristine P.,"Menifee, CA",113,113,25,2.0,4/19/2015,Two stars is being generous IMO.... We went to dinner here yesterday. Here were the problems: 1.) The Green Bean appetizers were not cooked. They were still frozen. 2.) The steak was not Medium Rare it was Medium Well at best. Super tough to cut and fatty. Meh. 3.) The mixed veggies were not fully cooked.  4.) The Garlic Mashed potatoes were not hot enough for me but my SO did like them so that might just be me. 5.) SOs salad was drenched with dressing.  I'm disappointed in the food. The service was fine but the food was not good.
Samantha R.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",97,8,2,5.0,7/6/2016,Our server was amazing and so was the food. I would much rather come here than BJ's down the street. Plus they had such a good variety food. I recommend the mozzarella sticks. The crust is amazing and they are cooked to perfection.
Charles C.,"Riverside, CA",361,21,12,3.0,5/3/2015,Applebee's is missing something. I'm looking for more tastier foods. Their food seems so generic and bland. Also it doesn't taste as fresh as other food places in the same category. This Menifee location is very nice and brand new. I just wasn't wowed.
Kim K.,"Menifee, CA",44,3,,1.0,12/29/2016,Waited forever for undercooked steak. Half the table food came then waited 7 minutes for the rest. Server was overwhelmed and did not even check back for drinks. Very disappointing. Waited another 9 minutes for manager to come and take steak off the bill.
Justine D.,"Perris, CA",64,6,3,1.0,3/8/2016,Went in for a family night out restaurant was not busy and we were seated after 20 min no one came to get our drink orders so i had to approach the bar where all the servers were hanging out and ask them to serve us. Management came to apologize. When the food order finally arrived over 45  min later after the order they forgot to bring one of the meals i had to go to the kitchen area to get the meal and that took 15 min more. Although the staff was very friendly it upset me that they discount anything and i put in 2 calls to the numbers on the receipt and no calls back from management i reported my complaint within the 24 hour period but you cant get calls back from the managers . Will not return.
Mike A.,"Temecula, CA",241,10,39,1.0,5/1/2016,"Our server was good and courteous so was the manager on duty. My complaints with this establishment lies upon the quality of the food. First and foremost there wasn't any complimentary bread or refreshments. The appetizers were not hot, we ordered cheeseburger egg rolls and mozzarella sticks. Imagine eating those under temperature. When the server took our order I was surprised that my over priced entree did not come with a soup or salad.  It was an add-on. I ordered 3 kids meals for my daughters it was pizza bites and yogurt. The pizza was actually 2 half slices of garlic bread with way too much tomato sauce and cheese sprinkled on top. My kids only ate their yogurt and did not touch their ""pizza"".  My son and husband ordered burgers and they were not impressed. I ordered a brew house crispy chicken and after one bite, I could not get myself to eat another. The chicken was questionable and tasted gamy. I immediately was disgusted. The food was less than mediocre. I want to emphasize that the service was excellent but the food was not up to par."
Gary R.,"Sun City, CA",0,3,,4.0,12/16/2016,Left BJ's due to lack of service. Applebees excellent service and food was not bad! Much better tonight.
Annalisa A.,"San Diego, CA",16,10,1,1.0,4/24/2016,Ordered take out. The burgers were under cooked the steaks over cooked. Missing items but didn't feel it was worth the effort of driving back down Newport. I won't be going back to this location.
Uh'oh U.,"Menifee, CA",0,22,3,3.0,10/23/2016,"This place was a good spot at one point. But since then it has died down. Food is ok. Drinks are still good. But the atmosphere here is just blah. Anytime you go it's just an ehh crowd. Before this place was one of the places to go in Menifee. Fun and energetic. Since a couple of certain people left, it has just become another ok average restaurant. Miss the old one."
Patrick S.,"Los Alamitos, CA",89,365,235,3.0,6/1/2015,"I cannot give a 2.5 star so 3 star will do, I have been to Applebees Hemet, Murrieta, and finally here and this one needs some improvement in the food category. I went here to have a snack and beers with my friend after doing some work. The bacon mac and cheese was oily that my friend had and my salmon was ok but the vegtables were slightly dry. Sricha shrimp was only good food I had here and tasted as it should. Beer was alright but could have been colder. I have been here on a seperate occasion to get some ribs for takeaway and they were chewy and tasted off. I hope the owner contacts other Applebees or the Bar Resue guy for help. I only come here for beer now."
Wendye R.,"Sun City, CA",18,6,1,5.0,5/8/2016,Had a great dinner with my Hubby. Our waitress was Beth. She was awesome!  Definitely will be back soon. Food was good and we didn't have to wait very long.
Alysha H.,"Menifee, CA",59,1,,2.0,12/14/2014,"I'm giving a 2 star. Which is very generous considering this visit. First time at this location. We were seated fairly quick which was good seeing how busy it looked from the parking lot. Our server Braelynn took literally 6 minutes and 23 seconds to even approach the table (I timed her from the moment we sat). Took 4 minutes and 39 seconds to get just one water and she said the bar was backed up thats why the beer didn't come with it.  We moved to the bar where we met Kristen who took care of us the moment we sat down. Unfortunately the food was below standards. When I got my tortilla soup I knew it had been sitting a while before it was delivered because the tortilla chips were mush.  My stepdad ordered a bacon burger but his burger was delivered with no bacon. My mom ordered the sliders with no sauce, yet they came with sauce. It wasn't Kristen's fault because on the ticket it shows she definitely put the order in right.   I most likely will not be back!"
Theresa S.,"Perris, CA",57,27,11,5.0,7/29/2015,"Excellent service and food here !!!  I highly recommend . Handsome Rob is great !  Drinks always full , food amazing , staff great"
CC U.,"Sun City, CA",50,32,29,4.0,3/18/2016,"Love this place, bartenders are awesome along with the staff!!! Food is fabulous as well! My only complaint is the bathroom stalls--- you have to step beside the toilet just to close the door.....SUPER tiny space to get into and I'm not Huge person!! Bigger stalls guys!!"
Jane D.,"Los Angeles, CA",434,37,4,1.0,10/11/2014,"And another failed business in customer service! If a place doesn't have customer service than u get in and out fast! That's exactly what we did.  Came here for the first time and last actually, unless I'm pretty desperate. Hosts where rude and didn't even greet us, only one out of 3 was good. So a 10 to her!:) Took the bartenders 10mins to acknowledge us and It wasn't busy of course....drinks tasted like juice and not alcohol.  My friend got the burgers, it was over cooked and burnt a bit. Hope this place gets better but with the staff, I doubt it"
Cole Y.,"Menifee, CA",238,7,2,5.0,3/18/2016,"Just stopped to have lunch while out and about. Beth was phenomenal. I haven't had that quality of service in over a year ANYWHERE I have been. She was so kind, helpful, on top of anything I needed and even considerate of my to go food. Thank you Beth for a great lunch experience!"
Nancee Q.,"Colton, CA",5,51,20,4.0,1/24/2016,"Stopped by this location on my way to San Diego. I hardly ever eat at an Applebee's. This was a nice restaurant, food was great and our server Jessica P. She was very nice and sweet :)"
Daniel R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",143,8,2,2.0,3/7/2016,"I have been here a good amout of times the past year since I go to school down the street, I always bite my tongue about the service here but it is always the same people working here and they are very selective of who to ask if they're doing ok or if they need another drink. Even then they still have regulars lose there patience. Tonight the bartender just walked away for about 12 minutes without explaining where she was going and the 4 of us sitting at the bar (that I do not know at all) are sitting wondering what is going on, bartender returns and laughs about it. Not the best service. Nice, but not very mindful of costumers it seems like."
