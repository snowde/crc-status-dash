Michael C.,"Menifee, CA",13,25,42,3.0,9/29/2014,"I have been to this Applebee's twice now, once when it opened for my birthday and a second time a week later. The staff is very friendly and attentive. It looks like the are still trying to work some of the kinks out as they just opened. I can see this being a great place to come back to once they have. Only issues we had were fries being to salty and the potatoes being under cooked."
Barbara B.,"Menifee, CA",1,9,,4.0,2/27/2016,I come here often. I really enjoy the food and the service is really good too. The only thing I don't like is that they don't have a Bud light in a bottle. Other then that so far they have been great!
Sonja M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",11,28,,1.0,11/7/2015,Went here for the first time and will never come back. We sat in the bar and waited awhile and the female working was to busy talking to a guy at the bar to ask for our order or even a drink. Keep in mind the place was not busy. Horrible experience and advise anyone to go somewhere else!
Pamela W.,"Menifee, CA",275,87,35,5.0,1/4/2015,I was so pleased with the experience my family had at Applebee's! We were seated shortly after we arrived and greeting warmly. Our server was awesome! We wanted for nothing! He was always their to check in on us! I had my two grandboys with and they were entertained with crayons and coloring sheets. They also played an electronic game that they provided for the kids! The meal came out quickly and so delicious! Thanks to the management and staff for making our dining experience pleasurable!
Jordan H.,"Sun City, CA",1,40,6,5.0,1/5/2015,High five to Robbie!!!! Love this guy. You can tell he really enjoys his job and he took great care of us. He knows his menu and is the energy of the restaurant. Kept us beyond happy the whole time! Thanks Robbie! The happy hour is awesome but you make this place rock!
Angel Y.,"Ridgecrest, CA",3,26,2,3.0,1/18/2016,"Honestly more of a 2.5, but that's not an option.  My rating is in comparison to other similar restaurants in this category (Friday's, other Applebee's, Chili's etc.).  I have been here several times and It is okay enough to go back occasionally, but I wouldn't make it my go to spot, and they never really upset me or anything, but they pretty consistently have messed up the food orders or brought the food out at different times due to some issue in the kitchen.  They are fairly quick to fix things, but after having eaten at this location several times, you kinda expect them to mess something up, and that shouldn't happen.  I typically don't get real upset over them messing up,as long as they fix it, but others might find it annoying.  I would come back, but definitely not bring someone here you want to impress."
Wendy G.,"Corona, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/15/2015,"I've never been an Applebee's fan...mostly because the quality of food is poor.  I've been to this location 2 times.  First time after they just opened,  found a small hair on the rim of the glass.  Gross.   Second time 2 days ago, daughter found a black hair in her mashed potatoes....she's a brunette.  Told the extremely nice waitress, who got the manager.  The manager could only say that she would speak with the kitchen staff.   Hmmm.....not good enough for me.....what's really going on in the kitchen?  Glasses not being washed???   Hair not being kept in a rubber band????   My only advice.....take a good look at your glass and your food before you eat or drink it......."
Mary J.,"Moreno Valley, CA",58,17,6,1.0,11/11/2015,"I took my husband there for his Veteran's Day dinner and this place was so unpatriotic and unwelcoming. We were told we would have to wait over an hour to be seated, but there were many empty tables. We left and went to the Applebee's in Moreno Valley where we were greeted with a smile and waited less than 20 minutes to be seated. I will never visit that Menifee Applebee's again."
Gene W.,"Sun City, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/6/2016,"Im 60yrs. Old and have never been to a worst resturant in my life! Theres a game on the table that says PLAY ME, than when you get the bill they try snaking $1.99 on the menu! Not the money, just nasty gettin taken! The food was not what we ordered and was cold anyway!!! This was labor day 2016. Just the worst. I'll give 1 star because I must put something. Ive called my friends and they have had a bad experience also! Avoid at all cost. Thank you, Gene Walker Menifee CA."
Denver C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,40,,4.0,6/4/2016,"The house chips are to die for.  Nice and greasy.  They used to be all you can eat for free, but they cut that out.  Combine that with a Philly cheeseburger and you have death on a plate, nutrition wise, but it is oh so delicious. They do have more healthy fare.  I love to eat there.  Everything I've had has been very tasty. Plenty of parking available and most of the waitresses look pretty good."
William S.,"Menifee, CA",39,1,,5.0,1/1/2016,"Great service, food came fast, it was all delicious! The staff were polite and attentive. We even had someone offer to hold our baby so we could eat with both hands. My wife, Son, and I will be returning soon. I recommend the Buffalo wing appetizer."
Lisa Lisa S.,"Winchester, CA",12,17,4,2.0,8/10/2015,"I've been here a ton of times. My family and I decided to have a few drinks here after a long day of moving. We actually ate before we even arrived and just wanted to unwind and have a few drinks. After a few rounds and chips & salsa they asked us to order food before they would serve us another round in the ""bar area"". I totally understand that they don't want anyone drinking and driving. My husband was the one who stopped after two drinks and ate a dessert there. I was so upset at how the manager treated us. We've been there plenty of times and NEVER been treated like this! If you are wanting to unwind after a long day, do it somewhere else. This is strictly a ""family"" establishment now and don't even understand why they have a BAR AREA."
H N.,"Sun City, CA",3,37,3,2.0,6/26/2015,"I met with a aquentance at this location for lunch today and was very disappointed that our fries came to our table on a large plate , not on our plates with our meals ! I was not comfortable eating fries from the same plate of someone I barely know ! It would have been rude to make an issue of this in front of my aquentance .  When someone orders a meal that comes with fries , those fries should be on their plate or a seperate plate. The Food was tasty , our waitress was friendly . But this type of food preparation by your Chef is disappointing."
Brittany A.,"Murrieta, CA",114,21,10,1.0,5/15/2015,"Wow!! I cannot believe my experience here tonight. I brought my friend in for her birthday to go sit at the bar for drinks and appetizers.. we sat at the bar for 10 minutes only to be completely unacknowledged. Natalie finally came to us and said have you been helped. I said no we've been waiting a while. She replied, ""oh that sucks"" let me get someone to help you. And walked away. We got up to leave after her rude remark. Reentered to get her name and the other waitress who was laughing at us, Lesley. And when we asked for it she said make sure you spell my name right. I cannot believe how Rude these employees were to me and my friend.. thanx for Completely ruining my friends birthday! I have never experienced such horrible service anywhere.. I'll make sure to spread the word"
Jessika S.,"Sun City, CA",94,48,30,1.0,7/1/2015,"Last night we went to have dinner and drinks ! First off I must say our waitress Jessica was wonderful , friendly and as prompt as she could be considering the extremely slow kitchen and extremely slow bar! Took almost an hour to get our food ! And 10-15 min between drink refills from the bar and the place was dead! The bar tender was so slow!!!!! Their shots are watered down and I asked why and it's because they put ice in the glass pour shot over ice and by the time you get it it's watered down  so gross!!! It should be shaken in ice and poured in a cold glass !!!! Absolutely no reason why it took so long to get our food , not to mention we had salad !!! When this place opened it was great and now it's dead and I see why ! Very disappointed ! All the staff is very nice and friendly which is a plus and our food usually tastes really good but they need to work on speeding things up !!!"
Suzie B.,"Murrieta, CA",0,19,,4.0,6/16/2016,Had a wonderful experience. Zack is an attentive server. Bar seemed a bit slow but the rest of the service was great. Food was just as tasty as you could want. Been here several times. Always have consistently good service and food. Live nearby so will be back often.
Irene C.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",36,26,19,1.0,6/15/2015,Not very good.  Service is terrible.  Expensive for what you get.  I ordered a yummy salad and it was mostly lettuce and in the picture it looked so good.
Destiny K.,"Winchester, CA",46,75,21,5.0,9/2/2015,"I've only been to this location a hand full of times but my experience has been nothing less than great every time. The wait is always short if there even is a wait. The service has been good every time also. Not to mention the food and drinks come out in a timely fashion, and they space out the time in between appetizers and the main course well. I like the decor in this location also. All sports theme and I'm feeling it!"
Steve B.,"Wildomar, CA",190,12,29,5.0,9/7/2015,Let me tell you about Kelly. She is the best waitress. So personable and attentive. She will give you great service and the food is delicious and reasonably priced
Art J.,"Sun City, CA",0,1,,2.0,6/24/2015,"How do you f-up chips! Soggy  chips  .we have been here before the food always sucks so we ordered spinach dip and chips to be safe cuz we came for the drinks , long islands for $3.75 ,the chips where soggy .. even the waiter said gross...."
