Chris V.,"Glendale, AZ",38,162,49,3.0,8/7/2017,"Overall not a bad experience.  I like their new menu with the toppers.  My GF got the steak topped with the fried Bacon Onions.  The broccoli looked a little old and the steak was a little tough.  Overall I believe it was $13.99 which isn't bad.  She got the 6oz steak. I got the Shrimp Asian bowl thing.  I asked for no Muchrooms but of course a few snuck in.  It tasted a little bland, not like I remembered from the other Applebees in Phoenix.  Waitress and manager came over and they did a great job.  Place was nice and clean.  It was a Saturday around noon so we were sat right away. An average lunch.  Tab came to $40 as we did get an app."
Brandon N.,"Gilbert, AZ",16,2,1,1.0,10/28/2017,"This place is awful!! Margaritas taste terrible, our chips came out WET!!!  Asked for water and took three other trips for the waitress to remember it.  I recommend skipping this and going to peter piper pizza next door, at least you get games with your food there."
Jane K.,"Gilbert, AZ",205,160,120,4.0,7/23/2017,"After reading the reviews, I realize that it all depends on who is serving, who is cooking and what you order.  We had two nice experiences here. Burgers on Monday are very good and inexpensive.  Most people were taking advantage of this special. Another special was 2 for $20 or 2 for $25.  We got the 2 for $25 and started with artichoke dip and chips. Then we got bourbon chicken with onions and mushrooms which was very tasty and firecracker shrimp with spicy noodles. The shrimp were sparse but the pasta was surprisingly good! We had left overs for the next day too. Their desserts are good too, especially the chocolate cake with ice cream. We used our gift cards and were very happy.  The server in the bar was friendly and attentive.  He served us quickly and with a smile and gave us drink refills right away. I'd try this restaurant on a weeknight or weekday rather than a crowded weekend night."
CeeJay L.,"Chandler, AZ",1,6,3,1.0,10/26/2017,"How the h*** does it take 45 mins for a salad to come out. Food takes so effin long to come and our server keeps saying that ""it will be out shortly"" or ""i will put your order in"" B.S! In between our meal of (ALL YOU CAN EAT) we asked the server to bring us another set and he said that ""I will put it in the system"" finally our food is done and server came back asked if we wanted a togo box...WTF OUR 2nds has not come back yet so we asked him about it and he said he FORGOT to put it again in the system so THAT MEANS we had to wait for another 30 effin mins for our soup and salad to come out... WTF... FML.... kitchen made me a cold food that also comes with the 2 pieces of fries (over exaggerate). Remember this day 10/26/17 and time between 2pm-5pm NEVER COME TO EAT AT THIS PLACE AT THIS TIME!!!"
Justin F.,"Gilbert, AZ",6,71,313,5.0,7/21/2017,"We love Applebees for dinner. Lots of options available for meals and drinks. The food is always pretty well priced an the staff is pretty nice. The staff seems to changeover often at this location, not sure why, but that does bring a learning curve to the staff. Overall, highly recommend."
Ian M.,"Mesa, AZ",11,22,24,1.0,4/3/2017,"My wife ordered 4 Cheese Mac and Cheese with Chicken Strips, and I ordered the Firecracker  Shrimp Cavatoppi. What I received was mac and cheese with some tiny fried shrimp on it.  It was bad.  I sent it back and ordered ribs, because who can screw up ribs.  Well it appears Applebee's can.  The ribs were dry and tough.  And to make matters worse, my wife found ants at the table.  However, they did give us $5 off (LOL). This is our first time going to Applebee's in 10 years and we won't be back."
Summer Rain H.,"Mesa, AZ",0,6,13,5.0,3/24/2017,"What a pleasant experience! I came in for lunch with my 8 month old daughter and we were instantly seated, our waiter Rob was extremely attentive to us! Came back multiple time to check if we needed anything else. He went above and beyond to service us! Very knowledgable about the dishes (even the new ones). Food was delicious and I left very satisfied. Defiantly will be bringing the rest of my family in."
Alan Z.,"Glendale, AZ",0,3,,3.0,9/9/2017,"Good food, don't have to wait to long, playlist is all out of whack (one minute you're at a rave then your thinking about your ex), children friendly but overall good service."
Mick N.,"Gilbert, AZ",12,373,15,3.0,2/28/2017,"The only reason I'm here is because of 3 gift certificates my daughter gave us.  Service was fine, our bartender was good. Disappointed in their corporate beer selection though. I hate the standard beer selection. Do I want a glass of crap light or glass of that crap light.  Food was surprisingly decent, we did the 2/25 deal. My wife got the chicken over rice, and I got the shrimp. The one complaint I have..........ok this is a family and corporate establishment. When you have 2 guys across from one another at the bar having a loud and vulgar conversation, this is where the bartender or the management steps in and says, hey.......one more F bomb and your going to have to leave. Don't get me wrong, I use the word at least 12 times a day, but I don't shout it across the bar to my drunk counter part in conversation. They both even made jokes how they've been asked to leave before because of their language. If I had my kids with me, we would of had a different situation on our hands."
Matthew B.,"Mesa, AZ",0,10,,5.0,12/21/2016,"Had dinner there tonight after driving by and seeing the packed parking lot. We hadn't eaten there for a long time and we were hungry so thought we'd try Applebee's again because, after all, all of those customers couldn't be wrong, right?   Right!  Food was great, a really good value, price, portions, etc. and atmosphere and service were exceptional too. We were very pleasantly surprised and will definitely be back again soon!"
Lisa K.,"Chandler, AZ",6,100,21,4.0,3/9/2017,Service has been good here.  Food has been decent.  I like going there because it is pretty much consistent.
Josie K.,"Gilbert, AZ",14,44,5,1.0,4/1/2017,"Another garbage experience! Got easily the WORST waitress ever (her name is either Fabi or Fabio? her name on the name tag said Fabi). It took her forever to get a simple ice water out. And even then, she managed to mess it up! How hard is it to remember no lemon?? She managed to be slow and incompetent the whole time we were there. My shake took forever and I was really thirsty. Food took forever and we were actually ready to leave when it finally arrived. Our waitress was so awful that another table was angry at her too and were pretty much telling her off. I salute that other table, because boy did I feel a type of way about her. While service may have been slow prior, we never got crappy waitresses that took forever with everything. A new low for this Applebee's. That waitress definitely needs to be fired if she isn't already."
James M.,"Mesa, AZ",105,2,,2.0,7/10/2016,"The staff was friendly and the service was great! That's why they are getting any stars at all.  Usually we have a good experience at other Applebees, but I won't be back to this location. None of the food looked very fresh and it was pretty greasy. I had lemon chicken on rice and it taste like the chicken was old and the rice was a solid clump like it had been sitting in a pot and stuck in microwave.  Sadly, the worst part was the condition of the restaurant. The tables are cracked and falling apart, the floors were so dirty and the bathroom was disgusting. My shoes stuck to the bathroom floor and the toilets were all full and had not been cleaned. Do not recommend this restaurant."
Christie M.,"Gilbert, AZ",73,2,,5.0,7/21/2016,"Just got home from Applebee's. We took advantage of the Thursday wing special and reverse happy hour. Food was 3.5 stars... Although a little well done, they were very flavorful. The spicy Asian chile is delicious!  Our awesome server, Demetri, was the main reason for the 5 stars. He was super friendly, attentive, pleasant, helpful, knowledgeable and accommodating. Best service I have ever had at any Applebee's."
Steven S.,"Mesa, AZ",4,64,166,1.0,7/14/2016,Had to wait well over 35 minutes for food and then it was cold. And staff seemed annoyed with life in general.
Selena A.,"Mesa, AZ",0,1,,5.0,1/25/2017,"Happy hour in the evening was amazing and the waitress we had was so awesome and nice always checking up on us, had great drink suggestions and was just the best. Andie was her name! Request her and you'll for sure have awesome service! She suggested great drinks and we had a blast!"
Lisa H.,"Chicago, IL",2,155,13,4.0,4/18/2017,"I like this place on weekends , the food is good so the prices,service needs some improvement."
Aaron R.,"Queen Creek, AZ",335,65,84,2.0,10/24/2016,I had a customer who really wanted to come here for lunch.   I was hesitant but went along for his sake.  The waitress got our waters and order.  The food take over 15 mins and my burger was barely warm.  She never asked to refill my water and seemed too busy! Will not come back!
Nathan D.,"Mesa, AZ",0,5,1,1.0,3/12/2017,"Well this place sucks. I ordered stir fry and they brought out mashed potatoes and meat. Sent that back then they sent out a plate of cold stir fry. The vegetables were not cooked, the meat was cold, and the rice was under cooked. My fiancee ordered pasta and the noodles were under cooked. Save yourself the trip and go somewhere else."
Mykelti R.,"Gilbert, AZ",38,15,4,1.0,10/29/2016,"Server Jonah took forever to come to the table, I already was ready to give him the food order when he came for drink order (10 minutes of waiting) he took so long to bring the drinks and when the food FINALLY came out it wasn't even him who brought it. Food was cold and it was obvious it had been sitting in the window. Fries were colder than room temperature and the wings were not even warm. My elbow accidentally knocked over my pink lemonade (which I had only taken a few sips of) server Jonah finally walked by and I had to stop him and tell him I spilled my drink. He was beyond irritated and told me if I spill it again next time there WILL be a charge. (As if I did it on purpose to get a free drink) the experience was horrible... will not return"
Marcus T.,"Mesa, AZ",64,10,,2.0,3/6/2017,"Had an awful experience here. Our waitress never spoke to us until the food came and when it did it was overcooked and dry. The ribs had no meat on them at all. I like Applebee's, but this was terrible."
Pauline S.,"Mesa, AZ",0,2,,1.0,6/19/2017,"9 clean tables in our view with a 25 minute wait!!  This is not the first time I have seen this here, but definitely the last!!"
Tyler B.,"Mesa, AZ",64,4,,2.0,12/15/2016,A few friends and I went out for a drink and some appetizers. We are asked if a high top table is okay we say no we'd prefer a booth the greater then proceeds to look frantically for a booth then asks again if a high top is okay again we decline... she finally seats us and then we wait for about five minutes and press the call server button.he comes over asks us for our drink orders we then tell him we'd like to order our food as well.. when the food finally arrives half of it was cold. We had to wait for our server for quite awhile before he came to check up on us. There were only 2 tables on his side so I'm not sure what he was doing. Overall I felt like he could have had better customer service and he could have checked up on his tables more frequently.
Valerie S.,"Mesa, AZ",157,4,,1.0,8/17/2016,"I am apart of the industry (bartender) and I was completely disappointed on the service I got here tonight 08/16 Tuesday night at our neighborhood bar and grill Applebee's, I came to enjoy a late night after work beer and snack with my significant other and sat down at a table in the bar which is self seating. We sat down going over what we wanted on the small menus in front of us.. 15 minutes rolls by and NO service yet. We could tell the bartender noticed us when we took a few minutes looking for a place to sit realizing there was no room at the bar so we took a table in the bar.  And she never approached us or said hi or welcomed us. As we're sitting there Aaron one of the servers at your location came up to us because he noticed we've been sitting here for awhile now. He asked if we were waiting for drinks and if we've been helped yet. He made sure we got everything we needed and had to go let the bartender ( Ashley) know we were sitting here. Aaron went over the reverse happy hour with us and apologized again for our wait. I am a mom so I know about patience. The girl that was serving us still let us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome like we were an inconvenience for her because we couldn't sit at the bar. So we didn't leave a 20% tip like I usually would because I am in the industry.. Honestly we should've given it to Aaron because he showed us we were welcomed here. I know we are 2 out of thousands of people that visit your restaurant location, but your bad reviews adds up. I understand why you guys are a 2 1/2 star we probably won't ever come back and won't recommend your location to anyone else we know."
Esther L.,"Mesa, AZ",0,3,,1.0,5/23/2017,"Been coming here for years, convenient.  Today husband and I ordered: Husband: steak, ribs, green beans and fries: Ribs and fries hot  delicious. Steak and green beans cold! My meal: steak, garlic grilled shrimp, brocolli, onion rings. Onion rings hot and delicious. Steak cold, brocolli cold and shrimp cold! No more! How can you serve cold food? Yes, food came out picture perfect, but not not good. Our server was very nice and very embarrassed!"
Kim R.,"Mesa, AZ",1,14,6,1.0,5/11/2016,Do not eat here my fries were really oily and my mac and cheese was cold and wings were cold!! I have given this applebees enough chances will not ever ever return even out of desperation to eat!!! I even informed the manger of how messed up the meal was and he did even say anything and smiled like an ass!!! DONT eat here i would give them 0 if i could !!!!
Jen L.,"Mesa, AZ",58,175,4199,4.0,12/13/2015,"I have been a frequent visitor of this location in the past year.  The last time, we ordered carside to go on 11/28/15,  My son decided on a full pepperoni French bread pizza with a side of yogurt and strawberries.  I decided on the shrimp pasta from the low calorie menu.  The other adult purchased the steak and potatoes meal.  We also ordered a ""choose 3 appetizers"" sampler platter: mozzarella sticks, wonton tacos, and smores churros.  Everything was cooked, there was condensation on the plastic containers, and the food was as decent as if we orders at the restaurant."
V H.,"Mesa, AZ",0,7,,1.0,8/19/2017,Went to applebees to wait for a appointment we were to early for. We went straight to the bar and sat. In front of my seat on the bar was a big puddle of brown liquid not a good start. The bartender was very pleasant and said she would clean the puddle. She made my husband and I a drink and never cleaned the mess.  We sat and visited and my husband said I needed to drink up it was time to go. The next thing I hear is what the h*ll. I look at my husband and he is pulling something out of his mouth it was glass. It cut the roof of his mouth and tongue. The bartender came over and saw the glass and my husbands tongue bleeding. She got manager and he saw the glass was chipped . He said he would cover our drinks and asked if we needed to file a report. We were so done and just walked out. If my husband would of swallowed glass it could have been really bad. This place is not clean or caring . Avoid!
Jerry L.,"Chandler, AZ",183,20,1,1.0,1/3/2016,"I've eaten here several times and quite frankly I'm surprised to see so many bad reviews. Tonight was definitely not their night. It took forever to get service and once our food came out I knew it would be cold. I just told the kids, they are having a bad night lets go.  Bathrooms are a mess.  Service was terrible and slow.  This place needs some serious help. It's a direct reflection of the management or lack there of.  The stereo was way too loud for a family type atmosphere."
Sophia S.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",122,112,235,3.0,1/18/2016,The service is very  slow...... By the time I get my meal  I will be 80 years old. The food  tasted good
TJ H.,"Chandler, AZ",652,242,348,2.0,10/10/2015,"K and I had just dropped C off for rehearsal and because a storm was headed for the valley we decided to duck into Applebee's for the great Monday night burger deal. Our server was Candy and she was really very pleasant. She did a great job of being around when we needed her but was not suffocating. K and I both ordered the Brunch Burger ($6.99 Monday only). We both loooooove this burger. It is my favorite burger from Applebee's. They sear bacon and onions into the patty and then top it with crispy hash browns, a fried egg, American cheese and ketchup (which I omit). K gets the burger with the ketchup and we both ordered it medium rare. Candy brought us our drinks and our burgers came out in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered chips with mine and K had ordered fries with hers. Both burgers were a bit overcooked. Not enough to send them back, but enough to lessen the ooowee goooey goodness. On both the fried egg was also a bit overdone. I love this burger because I want to cut into or bite into the egg and have it ooze all over the hash browns but both these eggs were past the runny stage. Bummer. The funny thing is the hash browns could have been cooked a bit more. They need to be crispy. Not just because that's what's in the description, but because that's what works with this burger. However, since our eggs were not runny, it didn't really matter. The fries were also just o.k. Not done enough if you ask me. Fries by nature should be crispy. I'm not talking over fried but they have to have some tooth to the texture. These did not. The chips were ok. Nothing special. If the burger was cooked right, and the eggs were runny, and the hash browns were crispy and the fries were a bit more cooked I would give this visit a 4 Star because Candy was such a good server. But because the burgers were not I have to drop it to a 3 Star. Average. But... here's where this visit looses another star. These burgers are supposed to come with endless fries. When we asked Candy for another order, hoping that maybe the second order would be a bit crispier, she told us that the Monday night, $6.99 Any Burger Special did not come with endless fries.  Now, those who know me know I hate having to correct people when it comes to THEIR business. Both K and I knew that wasn't true so we asked her when the policy changed and Candy told us that one of the Manager's at this Applebee's told the employees that the $6.99 Monday burger deal did not come with endless fries. O.K. So I pulled up the Applebee's website and found the TV ad that showed free refills of fries with the $6.99 Burger. I showed the Ad to Candy and she went back to tell the manager. She came back with another order of fries and told us that ""this manager agrees with you"". In all of this, Candy was very pleasant and continued to apologize for how our experience was going. Agrees with me? It's on your f*&^#@# Television Ad. It's NOT my idea. I'm not making it up. Why don't the Managers know corporate policy and what's being advertised on TV? Wow. Great server, Average burger, crappy fries, manager without a clue. 2 Stars."
Stephanie L.,"San Diego, CA",3,3,3,4.0,8/1/2016,"Went on a Monday night for my husbands birthday. Atmosphere was good, not too many people eating out on a Monday. Nate, our server, was very attentive and always checked up on us and kept our drinks full. Food was delicious! The Mac and cheese was phenomenal highly recommend. The only problem was that I ordered my steak medium and it came out rare which I can usually handle but it was just too rare for my liking. Nate was with other customers but luckily the manager, Amy, checked up on us and I was able to send my steak back (which I don't usually like doing). Thankfully it came back really quick and it was the perfect temp. I will return next time I'm in the mood for Applebee's."
Joel H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",37,4,,4.0,9/22/2016,"It's great as always, I mean you get what you pay for. Service was good always checking up on us. Food was good we had the chicken and shrimp. Only thing beer took the longest but I understand. But for a quick snack this it the place, been coming here for few months and so far I enjoy it."
Gillian C.,"Gilbert, AZ",92,108,285,4.0,9/8/2014,We were seated within minutes.  Awesome waiter.  Took our orders and everything came out correctly.  Couldn't ask for a nicer evening.
Penni B.,"Mesa, AZ",0,6,,4.0,12/20/2016,Great happy hour and the half-price apps great deal. Loved the wings and tacos. Server was prompt and friendly.
Jody E.,"Mesa, AZ",3,33,151,1.0,8/8/2015,Service was mediocre. Food was average. Tables were sticky. Dishes dirty. I was not happy. Complained to manager. She gave me my limeade free of charge. I won't be going back to this location again.
Rachel G.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,1,,1.0,12/28/2016,"I ordered carside to go and arrived two minutes after they said it would be ready.  Sat there for almost fifteen minutes with no one acknowledging me before calling the store.  Dustin apologized, but still didn't come out for another ten minutes.  All and all the whole thing took about 40 minutes.  I had my one year old and four year old with me otherwise I would have gone in.  I probably could have gone inside, sat down, and ate in the amount of time it took.  Got home and my daughter's apple slices and yogurt were all mixed together so she wouldn't touch them.  Very disappointing.  I only stopped there for the convenience (I've always thought the food was overpriced and hit or miss).  Don't bother if you're looking for something quick."
Jim R.,"Gold Canyon, AZ",0,5,,1.0,3/15/2015,"This is the first time I've ever gotten up and left a restaurant without paying. The waitress was bad and took 10 minutes between refills. When my meal finally came it was so cold that I ate only a few fries and 1/4 of the burger.  I waited another 10 minutes for the waitress before I got up and asked the hostess to see the manager. She went in the back and said he'd be right out. I waited another 5 minutes for the manager before I finally just gave up and left. I was too hungry/pissed to waste my time any longer. Applebee's is a good place to eat, but skip this location. I'll drive another 10 miles out of the way to avoid this one."
Mark T.,"Chandler, AZ",409,574,963,2.0,2/4/2012,"Rachel Ray says if you see a restaurant with a line, it's a good sign the food is good. Restaurants know this too and I think often they create a false perception by making people wait. When a customer walks in, sees a full lobby, and is given a short wait the expectations are increased. When I arrived I noticed the parking lot was not that full. Multiple parking places up front and on each side. I walked in to see 5 people waiting; I gave my name (table for 1) and was told maybe 3 minutes. A couple of other people came in behind me and were added to the list. As I looked around between the row of tables on the right side of the restaurant, the main dining section, and the area on the left there were 8 empty tables I could see, plus half of the bar was empty. So what's with the wait? My 3 minutes turned into closer to 10.  The hostess sat me at a table and said the server would be right with me.  A few minutes later and he wasn't there yet, so she came back and took my drink order. She returned (still no server) and she asked if I was ready to order. I asked about the soup and she had to check (which is fine since she isn't a server and doesn't need to know what the soup of the day is currently). I ordered the soup and a salad - which normally would be the $6.99 lunch special, but only until 3pm. Finally the server showed up with the soup and he said he thought the salad was almost finished. It's a salad - the smallest one of the menu and shouldn't take that long. The soup and salad are also on the 13 minute lunch menu so it should be quick. He returned one other time with a refill on the drink I finished the soup and salad, yet the server was not around. The empty plates and drink cups sat there for nearly 10 minutes. He when he came back I asked for the check and it was another wait. All in all it was an hour dining experience for a cup of soup and a small salad. As I left, the lobby was full with people waiting for a table - but once again there were several open tables.  It wasn't that busy, especially for a Saturday night, yet the lobby was full when there were plenty of seats available and the server was very slow.  The one redeeming factor was that it wasn't karaoke night. That usually is a horrible experience."
Lillie H.,"Chandler, AZ",122,141,389,2.0,3/22/2014,"Ugh.. Either the quality has dumped or my tastes have matured too much for applebees. Fish tasting fishy just doesn't seen right to me, but hey, IM no Gordon Ramsey.. The wait was insane for fish on a Friday during lent.. Tisk tisk.."
