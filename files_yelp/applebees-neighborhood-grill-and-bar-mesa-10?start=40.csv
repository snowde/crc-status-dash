Debbie S.,"Chandler, AZ",4,16,27,5.0,11/9/2014,Nice frIendly place. Always great service. The food is really good. I have tried several items on the menu and have always been happy with everything I have eaten. We love to go here to watch football on Sunday while we have lunch.
Linda M.,"Queen Creek, AZ",0,4,,3.0,4/4/2016,"We ordered off the lunch menu.  The chicken tacos were very good, the bourbon st chicken and shrimp not so much.  The food seemed over cooked.  The service was mediocre.  The waitress was very dingy."
Kenny S.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,125,4,5.0,2/24/2015,"8/6/17 -  my wife and i have been eating at this location for about 3 yrs and it is the best happy hour around. Hands down! Great prices, great food and good service. Try the salsa verde nachos!! Awesome!!"
Tonya W.,"Mesa, AZ",24,27,3,1.0,9/11/2015,"It was past lunch time & we had 35 min. to eat. I remember when Applebee's had 12 minute lunch options so my husband & I headed over for a quick bite to eat.  We were seated behind a mgr. interviewing a waitress which was a first for me. It was a bit strange because I thought maybe that should be done somewhere private or at least NOT directly behind a booth of customers so who can overhear the questions & answers.  We ordered & received our drinks in a reasonable amount of time. HOWEVER, we ordered a chocolate lava dessert (for me) & an all you can eat soup & salad (for my husband) and after TWENTY MINUTES we did not get any food!!! I ended up having to cancel my dessert order & leave to pick up our children from school & drive BACK to the restaurant to get my husband since he chose to go ahead & wait for the food because he really likes the tomato basil, french onion & chicken tortilla soup (he also likes it at Chili's) and the oriental chicken salad as well as the fiesta chicken salad.  While I was gone he moved to a table in the bar area to see the ""game"" on TV & told me the bartender was friendly. However, I don't plan on going back here for a LOOONG time. Especially since today we went to BJ's Restaurant & Brewery on Superstition Springs & Power where they have all you can eat soup & salad for only $7.95 as opposed to the $9.99 price at Applebee's.  Thinking back I do remember having a problem at this location about 5 yrs. ago when we went for a family dinner with my parents & they sent us a gift card in the mail because of the problems we had then. I guess they haven't improved much in those years. :/"
Ashley M.,"Waukesha, WI",3,95,71,4.0,1/10/2015,"Typical applebees. The host is crazy and talks too much, the food is reliably good and consistent."
Tam Y.,"Mesa, AZ",5,6,1,4.0,5/6/2015,For being extremely busy the staff was extremely good at communicating wait times and apology for having new staff. Hey everyone has a first day and they did great. I am always greeted with a smile.  We can always count on Applebees for a good time
Christopher L.,"Gilbert, AZ",177,5,,3.0,1/29/2016,Well they food is good but it takes forever and forever. Also you see them just standing around not sure what they are doing in the kitchen
Evelyn C.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,22,2,2.0,12/15/2015,"I ordered appetizers and drinks with a friend, which were great, but the service SUCKED. Kyle was our ""waiter"", and I don't know what drugs that kid is on, but he needs to share with his customers if he would like to be deemed SLIGHTLY tolerable. He didn't put our drink order in until we were served our appetizers (I was wondering why he kept asking me if I wanted lemon in a water I didn't have), AND he kept relaying our drink order incorrectly to the bartender. He would come to ""check"" on us with, ""is everything OK? "" only to rudely turn around and walk away before we could get a word in. He did this literally 5 times.  Unfortunately, I have had comparable service at this same location so I doubt this will be an option for me in the future."
Eden G.,"Mesa, AZ",0,5,,1.0,11/23/2015,"Went here on a whim and will probably not go back. It was a weeknight. Ordered the 2 for 20 special car side to-go.  Got two burgers and fries.  Ordered the burgers pink but what I got was pretty charred on the outside and could only be considered very well done.  My burger and fries were also cold. They quoted me 20 minutes,  I arrived in 20 minutes.  Not worth $20. I would give less than 1 star if I could. I should.have saved 9 bucks (with tip) and got fast food; it would have been faster and better than this!"
Kara W.,"Mesa, AZ",35,19,182,3.0,9/21/2014,"I ordered the Bourbon chicken and shrimp. It tasted super good. I was disappointed a little, because it comes with sautéed onions and ""mushrooms"". I got no mushrooms"
Erica W.,"Mesa, AZ",28,44,,2.0,12/1/2015,"The positives are that the service is great. We were seated quickly and our server was very friendly and helpful. Now the negatives...I feel like the menu options are very limited and the prices are too high for the type of food they serve. I find it strange that they do things like serve a dish with two grains and no vegetables, that they will exchange fries for a salad without telling you that it costs extra, that they only cook burgers rare or well, and that they only serve VERY large salads and no longer offer smaller portions. I used to be a huge Applebee's fan, but I do not like the changes that they have made in recent years. I won't be back...sorry guys."
John S.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,11,9,1.0,5/15/2015,"We decided to go to Applebees for a couple drinks haven't been there in a while ordered the $8  twofer ordered nachos and the sweet potato fries sweet potato fries were okay the Nacho on the other hand were horrible, that's also supposed to have green chili beef  there was no meat at all on the nachos except for a bunch of fat. When I mentioned it to my waitress she was concerned she said she'll talk to her manager she came back and said sir you only get 3 ounces of meat on your nachos and I told her that's fine but it wasn't meat it was pure fat and disgusting. They took a dollar off my tab. The $3 Long Island iced teas we're OK should have just stayed with the drinks"
Jean S.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",26,124,34,3.0,7/26/2015,Lunch was good.  However my first table had ants crawling (by the window)  We were quickly reseated.  Applebees is good for a quick meal.  I had the shrimp thai salad.  Our server was attentive and kept our glasses filled.  Valerie had a burger that was perfectly cooked as well.  All in all I do like Applebees.
Lori G.,"Mesa, AZ",2,16,,2.0,3/22/2015,"Ate at the bar on a Sunday after work. Got the French onion soup (very good) and the brisket nachos. The nachos were listed as having queso cheese on them, but when I got my order all I had was a weak smattering of melted shredded cheese. As I was picking at them, I asked the bartender if I could get a side of the queso since they forgot it. After checking in the kitchen, she said they were out of the queso, but the manager would come by and probably give me a discount. The manager DID come over, but just gave a weak apology and reiterated there was no queso. No discount. He did ask if I wanted something else, but by that time I just wanted to leave. If you're out of something, let the customer know before you make it so they can order something else. The manager just didn't seem to care about anything. I won't rush back."
LeAnn M.,"Azle, TX",8,10,2,2.0,8/15/2015,If expecting carside to go don't count on it.  I waited 20 minutes before going inside and finding out my order was ready. They asked for the type of vehicle I drove and the color and last time I ordered online I went for just to go and they didn't ask that question. I waited there and they never showed up so I went inside to get my food and it took them 2 minutes to get it. Seriously I asked for Carside to go and they don't even apologize. I still like Applebee's but the chances of me coming back to this one is a No.
Veronica B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,2,,1.0,5/28/2016,Place is disgusting.  Staff at bar falling over and being obnoxious while in uniform.  Found hair in my food on several occasions.  Drinks were terrible. My advice. ...go somewhere else!
Mo G.,"Beaverton, OR",2,71,16,5.0,6/13/2014,"They have ""reverse"" happy hour after 10pm and 1/2 price appetizers plus drink specials. They also have Karaoke on certain nights of the week - in 2011 they had it on Tuesday nights but as of 2013 they've been doing Karaoke on certain Fri, Sat, Sun.  They also have Bud, Bud Light, and Coors on tap for $3 ALL DAY LONG.  This is as of Dec 2013.   To all you fuddy-duddys typing bad review on this place, you should realize that this location is on one of the busiest corners in the Gilbert/Mesa area, so cool your jets and stop acting likely fat grumpy self-important little pigs. (run-on sentence, I know) Apple Bees is suppose to be a fun place to eat and spend time with friends/family or a drunken stuper.  I eat here often enough to know that your servers are constantly hustling to get your order out to you. They don't want to piss you off - they need your tips.  So be kind to your servers where ever you go....or they'll spit on your food, or worse...TRUE TAT! P.S. I'm not in the food industry but know plenty of people who are~"
Mary H.,"Mesa, AZ",0,59,9,4.0,2/27/2015,"If you sit in the bar area, you shouldn't have a problem.  One night we got stuck at a table outside the bar because every seat was filled and had the worst experience ever. Waited 15 minutes for water, after waiting 10 minutes to be acknowledged..... Yeah, ..so just -1 star for that experience. But if you go sit at the bar with AJ or Kaleigh and you will be in good hands."
Andrew S.,"Mesa, AZ",7,24,41,4.0,5/7/2015,"Me and my wife are regulars here! Its a fast meal when I dont feel like cooking so I make sure to swing by after physical therapy (AFC) to snag some food on the way home... We had a great time and i was going to post something last night but my battery was dying... The server was great, some rocker chick, I forget her name cuz we were drinking, she was awesome!!  We had the two for 20 meals... I ALWAYS get the rib basket and wifey always gets something that sounds healthy... Food was spectacular, but the salad was awkward because of the hot bacon vinagrette dressing, it wasn't for me...But all in all great time EVEN though it wasn't happy hour... Was cheaper then I thought... Sorry no pics... I was spending more time with my wife then the electronics and basketball game that was going on!! We love Applebee's!!"
Nancy L.,"Rio Rancho, NM",19,143,1,3.0,5/25/2013,"Went to this restaurant for a celebration with daughter, s-i-l, and granddaughter.  Got seated quickly for a large party, and our server was great.  The problem was the kitchen. I ordered the house special sirloin, medium rare, which is my usual order.  When the steak came (and it was the last of six plates out of the kitchen), the steak was vastly overdone - it was WELL done, and would have been inedible.  I asked the server to take it back, and by the time it came, everyone else had finished their meal---I don't believe that the kitchen put the right emphasis on replacing it.  When the second steak came, it was so full of gristle that I managed to get about 3 bites out of it...I left the rest of it on the plate.   This is truly the first time I've had a problem with Applebee's, and I've eaten in locations from Arizona to Tennessee and back.  I wasn't very impressed with this one."
