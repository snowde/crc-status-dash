Marcel L.,"Mesa, AZ",0,1,,1.0,2/9/2016,Terrible service. Terrible meal. Our meal took over 30 min. to come. Our sandwiches were very dry like they used stale bread. The place was almost empty.  Love Applebee's but not going back to this one on Baseline & Gilbert Rd.
Kimo K.,"Phoenix, AZ",22,241,45,2.0,10/17/2012,"This is the second Applebee's that I tried in the last year.  I went again to this one for a simple lunch with a friend, and we decided to try the 2 for $20 special again.  Once again, I was disappointed -- so I must remember to honor the old saying, ""fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice shame on me"".  We shared the one appetizer, and we selected the fried mozzarella sticks.  They were bad and hard.  My friend order the SW shrimp and pasta dish and that looked pretty bad (I did not get a chance to taste it).  I ordered the three cheese pasta and grilled chicken.  There was some cheese on the pasta -- I could taste it, but there was no sauce or liquid -- just dry, cooked pasta, that tasted cheesy.  And my chicken was burnt and dry and overcooked.  The whole dish was disturbingly dry and bad!!   I know that what they show on their TV advertising and on their menus are ""doctored"" and ""made up"" dishes to make them ""show"" better for advertising purposes.  But what they actually serve is pretty bad and that is a travesty.   I think the other ""semi-fast food"" places like Olive Garden, Chili's, and Red Lobster, have better food.  And I think Applebee's would be better off (or perhaps their customers) if they provided small salads instead of the sickly ""one appetizer to share"" option. So if anyone ever sees me write another Applebee's review, slap me up against the side of my head!!"
Stacey A.,"Tempe, AZ",62,2,,1.0,11/14/2015,"I'm not one to complain very often when it comes to restaurants and service, because I too have worked in the industry and know how tough it can be. My friend and I were in there a week ago, received horrible service, cold food and our appetizer (the spinach dip) was so over cooked, that the entire dip was crusted to the sides of the dish. After making a comment to the manager, we had a slight compensation for the evening. So, I decided last night, to give them one chance at redemption... worst decision! Not only were my boneless chicken wings cold, they tasted as if they were fried in old grease. To top it off, our spinach dip was very runny and also under cooked. The ""perfect margarita"" tasted as if it was made entirely of sweet and sour and the ""Bahama mama"" tasted chalky and gritty. I can handle when service isn't that great, but when I get food poisoning from their lack of QA, that's where I draw the line. Never again will I return to this location!"
Kyle B.,"Phoenix, AZ",4,6,,1.0,7/13/2014,"Came here twice, service sucked both times... Don't recommend this location. Tried to order the crispy orange chicken the second time we were there and even after waiting and some of the ingredients were recalled! Waitress tried to help me out with figuring out a new order kinda similar to my original but I was still upset. Don't come here"
Charity C.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,18,5,4.0,5/16/2014,I've never been a huge Applebee's fan but I have gone here three Thursday nights in a row!  I bring a buddy and get chips and salsa during their karaoke time. Servers are super friendly.
Lauren P.,"Mesa, AZ",0,8,,2.0,10/7/2015,Waited 10 mins for drinks. Waited an hour and 15 mins for dinner plus it was not hot at all and there were only a few other tables.  The waitress was very scarce. I had to go to the bar to get silverware after waiting for a bit for the waitress to come back around.
Steven R.,"Mesa, AZ",0,8,3,2.0,1/18/2014,Place works very slow the severs keep playing around and when I got my spinach artichoke dip there was noodles on the inside of it.
Liz S.,"Hutchinson, MN",3,88,,4.0,5/1/2012,"I've been to Applebee's many times before and their food and service is always average. Nothing to write home about but not necessarily poor. This location was just that, average.  We were seated in the bar and we had a friendly server. The food was surprsingly good. We wouldn't have come here except for the fact that we had a gift card but I was pleasantly satisfied with the entire dining experience.  Keep in mind, they do half off drink and appetizers during happy."
Ben B.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,92,5,4.0,8/31/2013,"I love this place.  It's in the same strip mall as the Fry's I am now going to and also Ace Hardware, Anna's Linens and a few other places I buy stuff at when needed. I go on Saturday mornings at 11 when it opens - which is in half an hour from now, lol - there is a bartender named Monica in there, she is the bomb. She makes GREAT margaritas and I have no problem at all with the food there.  I try something different every time and I haven't been disappointed yet.  The service is good and the wait staff is very attentive."
Mandy B.,"Mesa, AZ",9,10,4,2.0,6/11/2014,Very POOR service. One person in the party got grilled cheese and the cheese wasn't even melted. Waitress seemed out of it and didn't care AT ALL. Ordered a medium well cowboy burger. It was RAW!! Wasn't the first time food has gone back here and the fact that 2 out 3 orders in one sitting went back was ridiculous. It wasn't even a crowded night.
Dawn S.,"Mesa, AZ",51,53,1,4.0,10/18/2011,"We went to eat here on a Wednesday night. Kind of crowded, but still we were seated within about 10 minutes (party of 2). We were seated, then we waited.. and waited. Finally another waiter came to take our drink and food order, he said the assigned waiter was too busy. We gave him our non-complicated order: appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 drinks. Our assigned waiter finally came around, oblivious to the fact that someone else already took our order. Food came out fairly quickly, could have been a bit faster. Our assigned waiter brought out our entrees - no appetizer. I was a bit frustrated, but we began to ate our meals anyway. After awhile I think our waiter know how irritated we were, so the manager came by. The manager apologized (which was great), ordered our appetizer and brought it out immediately and offered us a dessert - all on the house! I was very impressed with their ability to sense a problem and quickly correct it. For that, I will definitely return!!"
Mary C.,"Mesa, AZ",0,3,,1.0,12/14/2013,"My husband and I go here all the time. The food is pretty good, service is typically great, prices are reasonable!  We like it well enough because it is right around the corner from us. We brought our son, daughter-in-law and 2 grand daughters for dinner on a Saturday night. It was my grand daughter's 3rd birthday. Sadly, we were quite disappointed. When we arrived, it was early -  4:30pm - and there were only 2 other tables with customers. Quite empty, which we thought was good as we figured service would rock! Not so. While the server brought the mac 'n cheese out for the girls immediately, the rest of our meals took over 25 minutes to arrive. I had the salmon - it was overcooked and the vegetables were, well, awful. My daughter-in-law's combo appetizer plate was amazing - (grilled chicken wanton tacos-to DIE for!) but clearly her plate held up the rest of our meals. It was fresh and piping hot! All of ours were cold. We mentioned it to our server, the manger came to our table and apologized, took the salmon off our bill. Nice gesture but then the birthday sundae came to our table about 10 minutes AFTER my husband got his triple chocolate meltdown. Try explaining to a 3 year old why she had to wait for her ""birthday"" sundae! The servers sang the happy birthday thing and it was nice. THEN.......we waited over 15 minutes to get the bill. Finally, all of us except my husband left. He had ""words"" with the manager about the bill coming so late. Again, we were quite disappointed and will probably not go back again."
Cheri B.,"Mesa, AZ",0,12,,1.0,9/29/2013,arrived at restaurant at 1:30 and waited 35 minutes for salads.... drank ice water... server never came to see if we were ok or to apologize for slow service.... the place was not that busy. Finally our salads arrived with medium cool lettuce and the chicken on top was like ice (it was grilled chicken) so.... we walked out after one bite... not exactly a dine-n-dash... wouldn't recommend this one!!!
Joanna M.,"Chandler, AZ",0,2,,2.0,3/21/2013,This place got two stars only because the manager our server was the worst ever I had to ask for water three times and he was really rude about bringing it back. We had to flag him down the third time because he was not coming to our table. If it wasn't for his manager being so nice we would have left.
Phillip W.,"Mesa, AZ",0,4,,1.0,7/15/2014,"Well my wife and I used to come here every once in a while for their happy hour, however they just changed their menu and the choices are awful. No more boneless wings on the happy hour menu and the prices increased to boot. The 2 for $20 mwnu continues to be subpar and they even moved some items to the 2 for $25 menu. Needless to say, we will not be back for a while. Nothing there that would keep us coming back like before."
Caroline B.,"Mesa, AZ",0,1,,1.0,10/20/2014,I went to this location for lunch and I was with two other people when they brought our food my food was fine but the other lady with me ordered a strawberry and avocado chicken salad. The arugula was soggy on the whole salad. She said she did not want the salad and asked the server to take it back and get something else instead(NOT salad). So all the while we were eating our food she sat there waiting for the waiter to return to order something else. By the time she finally returned to take her order we were bites away from being done. Disappointed because the time it took to get back to her she told the server never mind they are all ready finished with their lunches. The server said okay. When the manager came around he offered to order another salad which she did not want because of the first one. The manager in a joking manner said well I have been so busy sorry I was not there to watch all the food coming out and said the salad had been taken off our bill. I was very disappointed that he approached it that way. Of coarse the salad should not be on our bill she had to send it back because the arugula was no good. He was not doing us a favor be taking it off the bill. Going out to lunch is a treat and not something we get to do all the time. This was a horribly customer service experience and resulted in her not even getting to eat lunch with us. I will not return to this location again.
Richard M.,"Mesa, AZ",0,1,,1.0,2/26/2011,The servers are way to slow to handle hour.I dont know if it was just a busy day for them or if they are horrible all the time.
