Gillian C.,"Gilbert, AZ",92,108,285,4.0,10/25/2017,"We were seated within 5 minutes, just in time to order 1/2 price appetizers.   For some reason, our table didn't  have the ""pay at your table""/Game-play things.  I asked for one and they quickly complied.  (I hate waiting/paying for a check.)  They dropped it off and informed us there is a charge to play the games (I knew this already as I like to play the quizes-obviously i dont know my spouse very well....i always guess the wrong thing, BAHAWAAA) We ordered the appetizer combo-Happy Hour 50% off.  It was 5:45pm.  Correct price on the check (yippy)and Totally delicious.  They even brought the correct bleu cheese dip. So many places get that wrong but not here. We ordered the 2/$20 whiskey burger with fries.  My husband thought the meat needed more seasoning.  I took a bite and I thought the combination of the whiskey bbq steak sauce, crunchy onions, bacon, and cheese was incredible.  With all the mixture of flabors, the meat doesn't need a great deal of extra ""umph.""  Ehat I liked about the burger was the little bit of ""crisp"" surrounding the meat pattie As for my meal.  The chicken with white sauce covered with crunchy onions, baked tator and i got a ""premium"" side of bacon mac-n- cheese (at an extra charge.)  I think I like the mac-n-cheese the best.  Very cheesy with a creamy sauce, add in the cruch of the bacon-home run.  As for the chicken....not sure how they managed it but it was both rubbery and moist.  I took most of it home for leftovers.  ""Lunch tomorrow!""  Not sure if for me or my dog....depends how good it is.  But hey, the dog eats anything...including my shoes and hair brush. :) The waiter we had was awesome.  Did everything right.  Checked on us often but not too often to be a pest.  Was friendly without being flirty.  Sometimes Im in the mood to be ""chatty"" but tonight we were in a hurry.  It was time to bowl so he quickly brought boxes.  As he was bagging up the meal, I was paying for the meal.  Multi-tasking.....I love it.   Overall, 4 stars.  Only due to the rubbery chicken.  No real complaints and we had a wonderful meal.  Will go again."
Bailey C.,"Mesa, AZ",64,17,,1.0,1/7/2018,"OH WOW!! THIS WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE AND INSULTING EXPERIENCE!!!! I chose this location to have a family lunch to send off my daughter back to school. I was sooo excited for the all you can eat riblets. I'm not even going to talk about horrible our server was, his name was Christopher.  The manager had to fill out refills because Christopher was nowhere to be seen, and this is a small store. It took 25 min to get our food,  they did bring us chips and salsa. But there were no plates and napkins. My God I'm ranting!! I ordered the ribs naked with sauce on the side and they arrived fully sauced. I explained that they were supposed to be naked and sauce in side. My family ate all of their food and I still didn't get my plate. After 40 min. a kid showed up, but come on, no thank you send them back. The manager didn't even come by to speak to us. Christopher wasn't even aware I sent the food back when I asked him to remove the item from my bill. I told him that this was a horrible experience, he shrugged it off. Server came back and informed me that the manager removed the ribs from the bill. But no manager came to visit the table, guy sucks at his job. But, I was given a to go box with 4 ribs,  How Effin insulting,  I went in for all you can eat, and their solution was to give me a box of cold ribs.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH APPLEBEES!!! NO STARS!!!! I spent $70 and didn't eat."
Carter H.,"Chandler, AZ",2,28,34,2.0,12/24/2017,"Apple bees is normally good. They have good food and service. Though this time it wasn't. 3 out of the four of us got burgers. We got: 2 American classic's, a brunch burger, and chicken cavatopi pasta. First thing that was wrong was that I ordered the American classic with nothing but cheese,bacon, and pickles. It came with secret sauce on it. Next they forgot the chicken cavatopi. We waited for a while and had to remind them. The only reason this place isn't getting a 1 star is cause of the amazing service. If you go there request John as your server."
Maricris H.,"Chandler, AZ",0,2,,1.0,12/8/2017,"Visited today with my whole family. We Waited for a while no server came in. I asked for  the manager to come to our table but he didn't show up. Server ""Ray"" stepped in to help us. We were ready to walk out. Thanks Ray"
Libby L.,"Mesa, AZ",11,12,7,5.0,9/10/2017,"I had a nice time here for my birthday.... the staff, service and food was awesome... They sang happy birthday to me and made me feel special on my birthday.."
Courtney M.,"Queen Creek, AZ",205,177,345,3.0,10/4/2017,"I was never a big Applebee's fan but when I was younger my mother and I would always go to the Farmingdale multiplex to watch scary movies with her co-workers and then eat at the Applebee's right there so it holds a special place in my heart. However, I only ever went for 2-fer's or  1/2 price apps after 10pm after that and was never really satisfied with their food so I abandoned Applebee's for TGIF. Well, TGIF's are few and far between in Arizona (there's literally two) and for some reason, a lot of places I hated on the east coast are WAY better on the west coast so I decided to give Applebee's another chance. My husband and I had been going to one closer to my mouse and I loved that one, no complaints, so when we spotted this location the other day while driving around, we gladly stopped in. This Applebee's is a little run-down. Our table was a little sticky and the leather seating had a big cut down the middle which irritated my legs. Our waiter was really friendly though, I told my husband he looked like an old-time Cowboy movie star and based on this piece of info alone, if you ever go to this location, you'll know exactly who I'm talking about, lol. My husband ordered the boneless wing appetizer as an entrée and I ordered the smallest sirloin they had with a size of fries (to give my husband) and a side of bacon macaroni and cheese.  Our food took a while to come out, especially for a Saturday afternoon when the restaurant wasn't particular busy, but we just played some games on the table kiosk so no big deal. I ordered my steak medium and it came out well down with some char around the edges. I wasn't going to say anything but I decided to just mention it to waiter since usually they stay around and have you cut into your steak to check the cook on it. He asked if I wanted to send it back which I declined because it had taken quite a while and then asked if I wanted to take a brand new one home. I accepted his order and he actually had the kitchen remake my entire order so I got a meal to take home. I was super surprised that he did that since I ate my macaroni and my husband and I devoured those fries.  He even had me cut into my steak before he bagged it up for me to take home. My husband said his wings were so-so and commented that he preferred the other Applebee's better which I do too but the service at this Applebee's is great. The manager came around to check on us as well as she was apologetic about the steak. Overall, we probably won't be back to this location because it's so out of our way but even though my first steak was off, they went above and beyond to fix the mistake and the service was excellent."
Griselle R.,"Phoenix, AZ",103,140,256,4.0,5/29/2017,I love my Oriental Chicken Salad..sorry I forgot to feature it's beauty for you. So sue me. I got hungry. They forgot to bring out the appetizer but made up for it by taking it off the bill. Greg the waiter was mediocre at best. But the food more than made up for it.
Leslie B.,"Chandler, AZ",50,156,355,4.0,5/22/2016,"Clean restaurant , friendly staff , food was decent , prices are very affordable .. Especially if you can hit them up at happy hour ! We split an order of onion rings (best part of the dinner )  I had the 6 inch steak, garlic mashed potatoes & broccoli . Steak was ok, mashed potatoes were great !! And broccoli was steamed and tasted like broccoli !? Lol.. Reuben had the baby back ribs with fries and broccoli . He said it was good , not fantastic but he ate the whole thing. We ordered our food from the 2 for $25 section so our dinner came with an appetizer . Again very affordable &  larger portions .  I think I will stick to ordering appetizers and drinks during happy hour . Their apps are always fantastic !"
Christine L.,"Chandler, AZ",52,157,17,4.0,9/2/2017,"Although I just ordered water and an appetizer, I can't say much about this place food wise. Our server was very nice and fast too. We came in for lunch and was about in about 30 minutes. The hostess greeted us at the door with a smiling face. The appetizer that we ordered were pretzels and it was pretty good. Came with 4 long sticks and there were 2 dipping sauce which was honey mustard and their beer cheese. My favorite was the honey mustard. The beer cheese was alright, a bit on the salty side. Will come back again whenever we need a fast lunch."
Sue C.,"Tempe, AZ",95,566,,4.0,9/30/2016,"Applebee's just underwent a major revamp of the menu so I thought this would be a good time to update my review. The current effort seems to be to transform Applebee's into a steak house along the lines of Outback Steakhouse. They have a rack with hunks of wood and a sign touting the Wood Fired Grill items in the entry and steak knives that look identical to the Outback Steakhouse.  I had seen an ad on TV for their wood grilled sirloin steak plus two sides for just $9.99 for a limited time (it will be $12.99 after the initial promo). I had a tasty 6 ounce sirloin steak grilled just the way I like it and garlic mashed potatoes, and broccoli. All the food was very good and the steak was even tender. Service was friendly and snappy.  Overall, the meal was a great value. I just question whether the Valley needs yet another steakhouse chain."
Chris L.,"Mesa, AZ",0,21,4,4.0,6/3/2017,Went here for lunch on a date.  Had the steak soup and new spicy wrap. There was no food descriptions but our waitress made sure to define everything for us.  Once I received the soup it was great. The taste was spicy and zesty (going perfect with the new wrap).  We were both very cold. I would suggest turning the AC to around 75-78. Felt around 65-70.  Thanks for a great lunch date and tasty food.
Splatter P.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,1,1.0,3/30/2017,"Bland American traditional with a healthy side of apathy! Went in at 11PM on a Wednesday to kill some time, and killed it was. Less than 10 tables with guests, and a few at the bar, but we waited almost 10 minutes for a server to notice and find us a table.  But it got better. Appetizer arrived with no plates or silverware. We asked for some. Then entres arrived, still no silverware. We asked about silverware again. The server rolled her eyes, then stopped at 2 tables to take orders before finally dumping 2 forks for 3 people on the table. We asked for an ETA on our drinks and maybe a third fork; we were told that the bartender was swamped (3 people sitting at the bar). So our server meandered to the back and maybe had a nap. We never got the third fork, but luckily the appetizer came with a spoon. Our 2 mixed drinks arrived after our entres were nearly finished. And it was all ice..."
Calvin M.,"Chandler, AZ",0,3,4,4.0,8/21/2016,"My wife and I have been coming here since 2008 when we moved to the area.  It's a good place to relax, have some nice food & drink. The staff has always been very nice & attentive. Food has been consistently good. We enjoy trying new & different places but regularly come here a couple times a month. Grilled Chicken Wonton Tacos are my favorite appetizer. Clean, nice atmosphere and a cool juke box you can play from your cellphone."
Tammie S.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,16,,2.0,2/26/2017,Would have been good if my steak had come out the way I ordered it but was tooo rare for me so waiter took it back.  15 minutes later I asked what happened to my steak?   Oh???? Every thing else on my plate had been eaten or was cold.  Steak came out hot and over done.  I am done here!  Service was good that's why 2 stars.
Kelsey A.,"Mesa, AZ",30,7,,3.0,3/14/2017,"Love the people at this location. Always super friendly and helpful and we live right around the corner from here. However, whenever we order steak here we NEVER get the right cook of the steak. Today was my husbands birthday and we did a curbside order and normally I don't complain but the steak was well done instead of medium rare like we both ordered. Really hope they can get that part down because we really like this location but I am pretty disappointed today."
Bryan B.,"Mesa, AZ",0,19,21,4.0,3/6/2017,"I haven't been to an Applebee's for a while, and had never been in this specific location, so decided to try it out. When entering, the first impression was positive, as the restaurant had a warm and comfortable decor. We opted to sit at the bar, as we sometimes do when there are open seats available. (This is a seating preference, even when not consuming alcohol, as was the case on this visit). The chairs at the bar were actually quite comfortable, as they were swivel chairs with padded seats and full back support. We were promptly greeted by the bartender/server and received our beverages very quickly, as well as 2 full menus and a smaller ""happy hour menu"".  We opted for the wings, which were on special for happy hour, as are ""half price appetizers"". We also decided to get some spinach artichoke dip and chips, since they were half price.  The wings came out of the kitchen surprisingly  quickly, and they actually arrived before the chips and spinach dip. (I think the dip took longer to prepare, and it was very yummy when we did receive it, just a few moments after the wings). The food was prepared well and was tasty. We chose 3 different flavors of wings, and each were appropriately seasoned. They weren't the best wings I've ever had, but they were good, especially for the price.  The server provided good service, as she checked in with us regularly, kept our beverages refilled, and also offered to give us ""to-go"" cups when we were preparing to leave. All in all it was a pleasant dining experience, and with the happy hour prices, the tab was actually very affordable. I'm giving it 4 stars, as even though there was nothing spectacular that really made a strong or charismatic impression on me, conversely there was nothing negative to prompt me to rate it any lower."
Sam K.,"Chandler, AZ",83,40,,2.0,7/22/2016,"Went there last night and lets say, they used to be better.  Maybe it is the location as the one on GIlbert and Baseline is a LOT BETTER. Service Staff - I give an A+.  The service was really good. Waiting to get entrees, D-.  The appetizers came out quickly and it seemed it took LONGER for our actual food. Portions - it is amazing how much SMALLER they are getting.  The Spinach Artichoke Dip is at least 2 to 3 oz smaller over the years, or it seems.  This time it looked a little over cooked and blackened around the corners like it was OVER cooked in the microwave. The Caesar Salads, WAY TOO MUCH DRESSING.  There was MORE DRESSING than salad.  The steak, this time, WAS TOUGH AND CHEWY.  At least they had A-1.  My wife has Chicken and Shrimp which, lets say didn't sit well. My daughters, a little better with the pasta and fiesta lime chicken. If you want a steak, GO TO A STEAK HOUSE.  At least you know it will be A LOT BETTER THAN THIS PLACE.   Do I plan on going back, NOT ANY TIME SOON."
Toni Y.,"Chandler, AZ",1,107,15,5.0,9/2/2016,"I haven't been to this Applebee's before and was greatly surprised. The location was nice, clean and updated. It was busy and there was plenty of waitstaff, we didn't have to wait at all during dinner rush which was nice. I love seeing the many neighborhood locals who know each other as I got seated, I love that feel.  Our waitress Ashley was quick to greet and get drinks and appetizers going, she did a great job to check in frequently since we wanted some happy hour pricing drinks. The menu had great simplicity and variety, our kids actually ate all their food for once, and they stayed entertained with the tablet. I tried a new brew house dish and hubby had tasty wings. The manager was so sweet, she brought out our dish and noticed the fries looked like it sat out a while so she brought us new fries. That was very kind and I love her high expectations for quality and appreciate that. Our server Ashley was great, she was sweet and attentive. I will be back soon just for the fact that the staff were all great and the menu is something my kids will eat. No complaints at all."
TJ H.,"Chandler, AZ",652,242,348,5.0,1/15/2016,"Another Monday night and K was jonesin for a burger. Applebee's here we come. We were greated by the hostess who took us to a table. Our server was Raymond. He was awesome. Spot on, got the job done. Wasn't intrusive and carried on a conversation when appropriate. Kudos. C got the Classic Burger w/ Cheese and pickles on the side. ($6.99 Monday). The patty was a perfect medium, the cheese was ooey gooey melted good stuff. He ended up with 17 pickles on the side. Nice. C gave it a double thumgs up. K ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger ($6.99 Monday). Again, the patty was a perfect Medium Rare, the Swiss was completely melted and there were a lot of mushroom slices. K said this was one of the best burgers she has had here. I ordered the Brunch Burger ($6.99 Monday). This is my favorite burger. And tonight, it was done as well as it can be. The sunny side up egg was perfect. When I sliced through it the yolk ooozed down over the hash brown. The patty was a perfect Medium Rare, seasoned just right. OMG I love this burger. Spot on tonight. I do have to note that in the past the fries were unlimited, as per the commercial on TV. Evidently there was a lot of grief about it and so according to the manager, no more unlimited fries with the Monday night $6.99 Any Burger special. Really, no big deal because none of us really wanted or needed any more fries. Our drinks were $2.49 which is totally fair. Great Service. Great Monday night Burger special. Great Food. Great Prices. 5 Stars."
Peter J.,"Mesa, AZ",0,2,,1.0,6/11/2017,Went in for 6 oz sirloin with salad and fries. Received salad. 10 minutes after ordering. New I would get dinner just after. I took 2 bites. Steak was poor quality with strange taste and fries cold. Server was slow to get any thing I would ask for. Lost my business. I would stay going to Outback. Better quality and price.
Janice R.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",82,14,3,5.0,7/27/2016,"Great food, great service, excellent manager name Frank running this place. Server was very friendly, my food was not what I expected, however it was really good. Frank made sure we were completely satisfied before finishing our meal."
Megan S.,"Phoenix, AZ",49,9,,2.0,10/3/2016,"Service is very VERY slow. It took 20 min for us to even order our food. The restaurant was empty at 1:30 in the afternoon, so it was not due to an overwhelming amount of customers. Will probably think twice before coming here. Make sure you have time to spare."
Elaine V.,"Scottsdale, AZ",47,160,419,3.0,8/29/2015,"It was a very busy Friday night there ,we stopped in for a quick appetizer.  I haven't been to a Applebee's in a while. We got waited on pretty quickly. I had the fried green beans. Which were pretty good. What we didn't like was the restaurant smelled bad. But our waitress was friendly and quick. Oh I looked up the calories on the green beans 920calories wow!"
Chuck G.,"Mesa, AZ",7,6,15,1.0,1/22/2016,"Happy hour margaritas were good, but mostly ice Wings were delicious but we got charged full price... Played with the tablet at the table, got charged $2 for a stupid game. What a rip off!"
Lisa K.,"Chandler, AZ",6,100,21,3.0,5/27/2016,Good food decent prices and consistent service. No matter what time of day or how many people I go with always decent.
Bob B.,"Mesa, AZ",0,15,,1.0,12/21/2016,I agree with a few others who wrote that the drinks are watered down. If I wanted a cup of ice I would ask for it.  We are not coming back  once you loose a couple you loose them forever.
Jasmin S.,"Mesa, AZ",1,9,,5.0,3/17/2016,Best Apple bee's i have been to since my recent move to the valley . Fast prompt service  the manager was excellent with service and taking care of a mistake made on receipt .
Efren M.,"Tempe, AZ",22,84,,1.0,12/27/2015,"The food has certainly improved since my last visit but what disgusted me was the service that we received from Ashley. After ordering ginger ale she tried to give me the bar's cheap alternative to it without letting me know (soda water with a splash of coke) ok.foul tip. After asking for 7up, she gave me Sierra mist without telling me. I then asked for an ice tea in hopes that there would not be any more misunderstandings(3rd times a charm). A little Communication goes a long way and I would just  like to receive what I ask for,instead of having an alternative chosen for me. The icing on the Crapplebee pie was that she had to  correct the bill after our party was charged for appetizers individually vs.(The way we ordered them) The pick your meal deal."
Austin h.,"Chandler, AZ",45,190,51,1.0,10/6/2015,Very horrible food I order a burger no pink damn cooks didn't listen and was loud and annoying I told gm about it didn't do anything we waited like 40 minutes for your food and I said it was pink took it back and it was still pink worst place ever
Corey E.,"Buckeye, AZ",6,40,359,4.0,1/17/2015,"Par for the course. Really like any other Applebee's I've been to. Food was good.  Our server, Lisa a very kind and attentive. Saturdays before 7 and after 3 must be ""Seniors Nite"". Was like I was at Ferns."
K P.,"Chandler, AZ",5,84,,3.0,2/1/2015,"After years of swearing this place off like the plague, I went back Friday night.  Why?? A gift card for Christmas. The good part is it wasn't the ordeal I remember.  Actually I hadn't ever been to this location before, but definitely smile every time I pass the CLOSED store in Chandler. Food and service were as expected.  I didn't expect much and they fully complied."
Teleitha I.,"Mesa, AZ",2,36,2,5.0,6/7/2015,"I come here a lot with my family! And my kids love coming here! They are usually really busy on Friday and Saturday nights, so the wait to be seated is usually longer than usual. But it's not too bad if you come during the week. The food is great!  I usually have a pasta or a streak meal. And you can't go wrong with the 2 for $20 special. There is also karaoke on some nights which is pretty entertaining to watch and listen to during your meal."
Tammy M.,"Mesa, AZ",0,2,,1.0,9/16/2016,My husband and ordered the two for $25.00 rib dinner. It was awful the ribs were dry and the texture of beef jerky. Very small portions. Won't be going back anytime soon. Would have rather spent more and gone to Longhorns. The service was bad and nothing about the meal was good.
David I.,"Vancouver, WA",867,449,459,3.0,10/16/2014,"Service was good at the bar.  The food was normal for Applebees.  I decided to try the bottomless crosscut ribs.  Don't waste your money, they are the same riblets that they have served for years and not worth it."
E M.,"Mesa, AZ",7,25,77,2.0,4/2/2016,"Usually a great place to enjoy great food with great service. However, Thursday nights must not be the night to come. Service was horrendously slow with only a few employees actually working and not talking or watching tv. Although, not busy, tgats not excuse to treat what customers are there as inconviences. Our appetizer was yummy but how can you get fried mozzarella wrong.  It was the entrees that left us all regretting not going somewhere else. Food was bland (Quesadilla Burger) or overcooked (Chicken Fingers). And....burger was served without the fries. Our server said they ran out and was making more but after waiting 15 minutes, WE had to ask where they were. Server completely forgot our ""forgotten"" fries. Fries were then over seasoned and ""cold.""  This was such a bad experience that I'm left shocked and hoping it was just a bad night and not what this location now feels is  acceptable."
Alexander S.,"Queen Creek, AZ",85,17,9,5.0,2/24/2016,Love this place. Go here every couple weeks with business associates and always have great service and great food. Keep up the good work!
Dean C.,"Tempe, AZ",5,15,1,1.0,6/12/2015,"We did a car side thing. Which they told us would be ready in 15 minutes. So I drove 15 minutes there.  And not only did I wait another 20 minutes waiting in my car. But the food was burned, bland, and horribly cooked. 25 dollars wasted. Horrible food. I hope this place gets shut down."
Bryan S.,"Tempe, AZ",3,17,,1.0,1/9/2015,"The food wasn't all that great and overpriced for what it was.  I had the 4 cheese mac n cheese with honey BBQ boneless chicken tenders.   The mac n cheese part was not bad but the chicken was really greasy.  My wife had the double shrimp which was really greasy too.  We're both a little queasy from all the grease.  They even charged us for an extra side of ranch for dipping the fries in.  And she didn't even end up eating the fries. The service wasn't too bad considering we went there on a Friday night and they were really busy.  Overall,  we were very disappointed and most likely won't be back."
Mark D.,"Chandler, AZ",0,6,,5.0,6/1/2016,"Great food, service and customer care. Many thanks to the kitchen for preparing our delicious food; to Janielle for her awesome service - perfect combination of professional and personal (just a genuinely kind person); and to Ken for making our celebration extra special by acknowledging our kids' piano recitals with free meals for them today and coupons for another free meal each!"
Jalecia W.,"Mesa, AZ",61,18,6,1.0,6/12/2015,"Terrible. Don't ever go to this restaurant. My fiancé and I thought it would be convenient to order online and do car side pickup. When we arrived to the location, I had to get out to get my food. Not only that but they didn't have some of the food ready. I always already waiting an extra 20 minutes just to get my bag, which they offered no compensation for the additional wait. Upon getting the food, the ribs were burnt; the fries were limp and tasteless; the chicken penne was rubber and not made with penne noodles and the mozzarella sticks were hard. I will never ever eat here again."
