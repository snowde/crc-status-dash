Aimee B.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,2,1,5.0,9/9/2014,"We took our 5 kids (yes 5, crazy I know) to eat spur of the moment. When we arrived we were greeted by a nice hostess and an amazing ballon guy!  When we were seated The waitress informed us that kids eat for .99 on Tuesday and I thought I had heard her wrong. She said no that's correct. I up front apologized for anything bad our kids may do and Laura our AMAZING waitress smiled and said no worries everything will be fine and not to worry. Just as she said the night was worry free and Laura made us feel welcome like the balloon guy did. The attention we were given tonight reminds me the power of GREAT customer service with a smile and we WILL dine at this location again. I only hope that our monitory gifts showed them how much we appreciate them doing their jobs with a smile."
Nate D.,"Mesa, AZ",36,90,,4.0,5/21/2015,"Food isn't bad for what it is. My service was quick and food was good. I tried some kind of smores churros which I definitely wouldn't order those again, but besides that everything else was good my service was good, the food was hot and the beer was cold which is what wanted when I came in."
Nina H.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,40,1,4.0,4/3/2015,"Just recently went to an Applebee's after years of not being to one. I was pleasantly surprised. Their look has changed and so has the menu, in good ways. Don't get me wrong the place was still filthy but it's changed. And the food was not disappointing. Had the steak with shrimp and it was delicious! Will probably come back and try their new items."

Amy Michelle Mosier M.,"Tempe, AZ",43,117,322,4.0,3/30/2013,"I really dig their two-person specials with dessert for like $20. Their cheese and broccoli soup is super creamy. They have every flavor of tea imaginable so when I come here, I make mine pomegranate.  Our waiter was chill. I ordered ""penne"" and explained that saying it makes me laugh because while it's pasta in Italian, it also means ""dick"" in Spanish at which he laughed and went and told everyone who works in the back.  Well, everything's filling. Come hungry."
Dylan H.,"Chandler, AZ",0,1,,3.0,3/28/2016,"The service here was great the first times we came, but now it's terrible. There is only one person serving customers, and the others, are standing around, talking, and watching TV. Just go somewhere else, save money, and hours of time that you are wasting waiting for your food."
Kevin T.,"Boise, Portland, OR",48,5,4,5.0,1/23/2014,"Love my bartenders. No bars close enough to home, so I started stopping in here and I love it. Common courtesy will get you far here."
Alan H.,"Chandler, AZ",11,119,61,3.0,10/1/2014,Tried the Thia chicken salad - it was good portion little small some spicy. Service lacked though waiter was friendly.  While not my worse visit to any Restaruant it just fell into so-so! Only ate here because I was in the area. Wouldn't make it a must destination - maybe again if in the area.
Tracy E.,"Mesa, AZ",39,12,,2.0,12/9/2015,I took my 9 yr old daughter to lunch- I was happy to see new sandwhiches added to the menu-- hostess pointed out kiosk on table - my 9 yr old immediatly scans it and checks out the kids games link -said to me O it says 1.99 I tell her O don't touch- we ignore - of course bill comes there is $1.99 charge snuck on there- waitress seems annoyed I asked for it to b removed- beware of these table side kiosks it's a rip off scam and it's completely redicioulous- food was  good- server was ok-
Robert L.,"Mesa, AZ",138,20,1,4.0,10/3/2014,"I had a business meeting here ( Arizona Business Connection) with Bob from Minute man cleaners & Jens The handyman,  I think it it was a good choice for the meeting, I had the Fiesta chicken chopped salad also a good choice but the other guys sandwiches looked better.  Over all a great meeting, good service and good food."
Helen C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,9,2,5.0,3/17/2014,My experience here was quite pleasant. My server was very polite and attentive. I got my tea and water in less than 1 minute and I got my food within 10 minutes. The food was amazing and the service was awesome!
Meagan S.,"Gilbert, AZ",49,54,27,1.0,12/12/2013,"I've been here before, an it's the last time. I have a gluten allergy and each time I come in, it seems to be an issue. Not sure if it's the wait staff, the cooks or management that are not educated, but they've lost this customer for sure. I won't be back."
Melinda C.,"Mesa, AZ",3,12,1,4.0,11/8/2013,"I used to avoid going to this location at all costs because of bad food and poor service, however I gave it one more try and was pleasantly surprised. I sat in the bar and had great service and delicious cheap margaritas. New late night spot!"
Scott R.,"Seattle, WA",8,44,1,1.0,3/3/2014,"This was a terrible experience. The waitress was very nice and have no complaints about her. However, the food, was just awful. It was so terribly generic and flavorless I don't know how Applebee's stays in business. Why do people go there? We had a gift card and that's the only reason. Of course, we forgot the gift card...but ya know what? We aren't going to go back to use it because it was that bad. I really don't understand why anyone would go there. The food was so generically terrible I don't know why someone would spend money on it."
Jaime F.,"Sacramento, CA",264,79,,2.0,1/13/2011,"The boyfriend inexplicably received an Applebee's gift card from one his aunts that takes too many pictures and never throws anything away.  Those last details were entirely beside the point.  He never expressed any out of the ordinary interest in this famous chain, but nonetheless we were left with a 25 dollar gift card and no choice but to man the crowded booths of our local Applebee's.  It's odd when you never go to chain restaurants how much you notice the differences between them and other places we normally eat.  We went on a Wednesday night and there were people waiting for a table.  Two million restaurants in Phoenix and these assholes are WAITING for mediocre chain food.  There were only two of us so we were seated promptly at a two top near the kitchen and instantly were mesmerized by the completely muddled,  incoherent memorabilia that lines the walls of this place.  A photo of Marilyn Monroe, next to a Route 66 sign, next to a football helmet, next to a baseball hat, next to a picture of Johnny Carson with a cigar or someshit.  Perhaps it is difficult, or rather simply unnecessary, to provide your restaurant with an easily deciphered theme.    Not that anyone who is eating at Applebee's gives a fuck.  Another thing I noticed about the ambiance is that this is certainly a watering hole for those afflicted with that whole ""obesity epidemic"" thing here in America.  And I'm not being a bitch, man, there were just a lot of fat people there. Our server, an over weight Latino man with a raspy voice and  purposeful speed takes our drink orders right away.  We both get Long Islands which are served in an obscenely sized goblet straight out of the 18th century.  I am small and I don't work out and I hate when drinks are fucking so heavy that I have to use two hands.  I understand that it is now a trademark of these types of restaurants to make their drinks large, colorful and spectacular- but I can't help but pretentiously think as I lift the four pound concoction of watered down syrup and ice, ""this is just fucking retarded."" We order a few appetizers; the spicy bone-in wings and mozzarella sticks.  The wings are dinky and under salted but not disgusting.  The mozzarella sticks were... mozzarella sticks.  You can't really go wrong or right with fried cheese but they got cold fast and the cheese hardened.   The redeeming quality of our Applebee's outing was our likable and attentive server.  While we never really make our way to chain restaurants (as there is just so much other good shit Phoenix has to offer), it was sort of nice to have a friendly and non-hipster server.  A guy not concerned with spouting off specials and showing us the wine list and judging us if we order domestic instead of premium,  just a giant Mexican dude probably with a family of four at home trying to make some good tips.  And I guess that's always the nice, homey thing about chain places; it's all just so average and normal and sometimes that feels like comfort.  I can't honestly say that I'll return to Applebee's anytime soon unless we come across another gift card from another relative that takes too many pictures and doesn't throw anything away, but I can say that it was an overall interesting experience to be out of our comfort zone, talking and watching the hoards of middle Americans order their steak and shrimp or chicken fried steak and shovel it in their mouth while they talk about how the fuck they're going to pay the mortgage this month. Maybe our server can pay HIS with the giant tip we left him."
Mary H.,"Mesa, AZ",9,80,,1.0,5/14/2013,"My chicken was burnt, the side that was black was facing down to hide it! I sent it back and ordered a rare steak. It came out  well done and full of gristle. Their idea of making amends, was to ONLY charge for the burnt chicken, but took off the steak! Unbelievable! We won't be back!"
Jessica S.,"Dallas, TX",347,376,36,2.0,8/4/2011,"besides o.k alcohol prices during happy hour... the food has disappointed me more than once now... I'm sorry Applebees but we are officially breaking up. we had our moments but they have come and gone...disappoint me once and I will forgive you but twice then i just become a bitter girl that I even spent my money here... goodbye Applebees and hello Chili's !!( i know its mean, but breakups are hardly ever nice )"
Brain S.,"Portland, OR",8,13,8,1.0,11/18/2013,"Burbon street stake was sizzling so hard when I got it that it popped me in the face with hot grease. It tasted great after waiting 5 minutes to feel safe to eat it. I orderd it medium rare. It was well done, not even pink in the middle. If that grease had left a mark on me, there would have been hell to pay. that's why you get one star. Though the waitress was very pleasant."
Katie E.,"Mesa, AZ",104,72,1,1.0,11/13/2012,"Weak drinks and overpriced bar food make this place very low on my radar. However, we went with a group of friends for the Veteran's Day deal where they provided a free meal to veterans. I was meeting someone for lunch later so I only had a drink, everyone else ordered a meal(including the veterans in our group). Here we are 2 days later and every single person, that ate there all have flu symptoms. I feel fine and coincidentally I didn't order anything to eat. Some line cook was probably sick and they wouldn't let him call out since they were busy for the holiday. Way to give some veterans the flu with their free meal Applebee's!"
Mo G.,"Beaverton, OR",2,71,16,4.0,6/6/2011,"Good place to hang out with friends after work or on a late weekend night. They have ""reverse"" happy hour after 10pm and 1/2 price apappetizers and drink specials. This location does have outdoor dinning."
