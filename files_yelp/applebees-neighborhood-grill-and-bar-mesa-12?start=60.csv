Robert M.,"Mesa, AZ",260,8,18,5.0,12/30/2010,The food and service is always excellent at this Applebee's!  My favorite is the Bourbon Steak & Shrimp.  Also try their signature Mudslides - top notch.
Mary C.,"Mesa, AZ",0,3,,1.0,12/14/2013,"Burgers are great! Classic turkey sandwich is amazing - real turkey, not lunch meat. We go here all the time! However, went to restaurant this past Saturday, at 4:30pm with my husband, son, daughter-in-law and 2 grand daughters. It was empty!!! Yet it took over 25 minutes to get our meals. Mine - salmon - was overdone, vegetables were awful and potatoes were lacking. Pushed my plate away after tasting the salmon. Shared ribs with my husband - they were ""okay'  - not great ...BUT the chicken wanton tacos were AWESOME!! (my daughter-in-law shared!). These were piping hot so apparently all of our dinners were cooked first and waited on the wanton tacos. After voicing my dislike for the salmon, manager came to our table, apologized and moved on. He did take it off the check. . Dessert then came late...they brought out cake/ice cream out WAY before they brought the sundae for my grand daughter's birthday. WHAT? Then it took over 15 minutes for us to get the check.  It was awful and we won't go here again. So  sad, cause it's right around the corner and convenient. But.....bad food, bad service? No thanks!"
Micah D.,"Tempe, AZ",28,54,,3.0,10/19/2007,"We stopped off for a drink here on our way out to other things.  She had a strawberry daquiri which wasn't bad at all.  I was inspired to drink something fruity and ended up drinking a strawberry pina colada which was terrible.  I don't know what I was thinking.  The Pina Colada song started playing in my head and I felt compelled.  Rest assured it's a compulsion I will be able to resist until I'm on a beach in the Bahamas.  Which will be like, never since I'm not a big tropical beach person. Big D had a martini and said it wasn't so great.  A wave of whimsey crashed against the rocks of my disappointment (or perhaps chunks of ice) in my pina colada, and I had a craving for broccoli cheese soup.  It was edible, but nothing spectacular.  I think I'm too hard on such things.  Cheese soups aren't easy to get right I suppose, because it seems to fall below my expectations at most places, but when they get it right I am in cheese laden nirvana. The only reason I gave them 3 stars instead of 2 was that the service was excellent.  Our server was always checking in with us, asking about drink refills, talked with us about menu items - in an informative and non-pushy way - answering all of our questions and making conversation rather than suggestive selling.  She was just very attentive and very nice which always makes me happy."
