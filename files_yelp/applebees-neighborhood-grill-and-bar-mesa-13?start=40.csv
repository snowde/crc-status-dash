Judy B.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,5,1,5.0,2/10/2014,"Thank you, Manager Frank, for covering our entire bill yesterday, including beverages, after our order got lost and we waited a long time for our food. The food was good, too. Try the new grilled chicken and honey pepper shrimp over cubed potatoes and green beans!"
Holly J.,"Mesa, AZ",0,6,,1.0,7/2/2012,"Worst Applebee's every. Took 10 min for someone to get my water. Placed my order and when they brought my oriental chicken salad the chicken was hard and dried out, a drizzle of dressing. My soup bowl was completely cracked, so then I couldn't eat anymore, lost my appetite. Guy asked me once how I was doing, and didn't even give me a chance to talk. Never again!!!!"
Elorie K.,"Mesa, AZ",172,4,,1.0,12/10/2013,"Let me first say that this is a review of this restaurant in particular, on this specific evening, not overall of Applebee's.  We come to this Applebee's several times a month, whether it be for late night happy hour or for Kid's Eat Free on Tuesdays. Mostly on Kids eat free Tuesdays. I'm a single mom and on a budget, so we go a couple of Tuesdays a month and I will get a half price appetizer and a drink and my son will eat for free a $3.99 kids meal. It's a great deal when both of us eat for $10 including tip. Not tonight, though. Although I've never had an issue before, my bill came back and I made the server aware that my son's meal was not taken off. He said he'd speak with his Manager. The manager, Jamie, came over and was confrontational from the start. She stated that this is a business and that I can't have my son's meal for free because that just doesn't make sense because his meal is the same price as mine. She said that it was free with an Entree and that the sign out side said so and that I could go check. I let her know that I wasn't aware that the policy had changed since the last time we'd been and that I had to order an entree (which I've never had to do in the past).  She continued to say that I'm lying that I've been before on Tuesdays because she does inventory and she's here every Tuesday. She continued on in front of other patrons stating that this is a business that needs to make money. I paid, left embarrassed and will probably never return to this Applebee's again, if any. Our server was a doll, the food was just ok as usual, but the nightmare of this manager was enough to say no thank you to ever returning.  As I was leaving, I checked the sign outside, and of course there is no mention of ""free with purchase of Entree"" anywhere on the building. Sooo I took a picture to post of that sign too."
James P.,"Clearwater Beach, FL",0,27,,3.0,8/26/2013,"Exactly what you would expect.  The food is not great by any means, but the service is great and so is the happy hour specials.  I will occasionally walk to here to meet some friends for happy hour because it is so close but I prefer a few other places around the area."
roger s.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",5,43,3,5.0,7/6/2014,We ordered the 10.99 special with steak. The steaks were the perfect size for us and they were cooked perfectly. I had a delicious wedge salad and my wife had the best spinach salad ever. It came with garlic spinach. Yum. The steak came with a really good vadalia onion sauce. We have eaten at several all over the country and we get the small sre
Gloria T.,"Mesa, AZ",0,4,,3.0,9/20/2014,"My dinner was plentiful and good.  However, Oriental Orange chicken should have more sauce,at  least enough to cover each chunk of chicken.  The bed of ""oriental vegetables"" was mostly carrots, onions, red bell peppers, celery and mushrooms.  Two edamame didn't quite qualify as making it oriental.  As I said,  good tasting, but NOT oriental."
Rebeccah E.,"Clarksville, TN",0,44,,3.0,3/17/2012,"This Applebee's isn't bad. The servers are all pretty nice and friendly but the food has kind of gone downhill. The last three times, I've had garlic mashed potatoes; two times they were ice cold and the third time, they were so runny that I couldn't eat them. Whenever I order a salad, I order extra dressing and I never get it. The steaks and hamburgers are very good!! All in all, not bad for the money."
Ray A.,"Everywhere Branch, MO",2,10,,5.0,8/8/2014,"I ate here 8/5/2014.It was a Tuesday, the second Tuesday in a row. As far as Applebee's go this location is my favorite. I am not normally a fan of this chain but they tend to have good food for the value. This location however is So Cool. So Tuesday July 30th my daughter wanted to come here for her birthday. We tried to make other suggestions but this is where she wanted to go. We met Jamie a manager here. She was so fun and invited us back the following week when they were having a Disney dress up day with the staff. Tuesday being kids night we were happy to return. They have the best balloon guy I have ever seen. He is just amazing.  Disney Tuesday was so much fun. Jamie played the evil queen and had my kids cracking up.   The food was wonderful and for the second week in a row the service was perfect. My kids no longer ask to go to chuck e cheese and we have a great meal at a great value. Thank You Jamie for making this restaurant a fun experience, not just a place to eat."
Kathleen T.,"Mesa, AZ",2,8,3,1.0,5/8/2011,"Worst service ever. Went with a couple of friends and got smushed into a little booth. Got a horrible, rude waitress who didn't let us enjoy our time there and shoved us out the door. I love applebees, but this one has crappy service."
Tierra B.,"Mesa, AZ",2,3,,1.0,5/8/2011,"This is the worst Applebees I have been too. I went with 5 friends and our waitress was really rude. We all already had two beverages and we did buy food, when we asked for a third round she questioned how many drinks we had, and said well I guess you guys can have another one since you bought food. Then shortly after I received my watered down jagger bomber the waitress came and said are you ready for your tickets? ... right after we received our drinks, we were basically shoved out and didn't feel welcomed at all. Every other Applebees I have never had a problem but this one is just horrible!"
Sherrie D.,"Honolulu, HI",18,91,131,1.0,12/8/2012,"serously my son and I had the chipote steak, it was so salty I couildn't eat it.  yuk"
Karen F.,"Payson, AZ",3,41,,1.0,12/8/2011,"Lunch on 12/7/11...a bad choice. Not crowded@ about 1:30 p.m. We always sit in the bar area. Not a good idea to have the bartender wait tables. First...ordered a glass of Sutter Home Pinot Grigio. Was told ""we don't have that now"" and was offered Little Black Dress Pinot. I asked if it was the same price as the Sutter Home..told it wasn't but was advised she would ""give it to me at that price today because I was having a bad day"". Why should I pay more for an ""upsell"" when they didn't have what was on the menu?  Ordered sandwich with fries. Received my meal and the fries were old, shriveled and barely warm..so were my husband's. Obviously, we were given the leftovers from lunch that had been sitting under the heat lamp. Asked for and received freshly made, hot fries. The manager approached our table asking how everything was. I let him know what had transpired. He seemed totally disinterested but he did comp my lunch. The bartender/waitress came with our check and she basically admitted that we were served the ""leftovers"" from the early lunch service. This Applebees has gone downhill in the past several years. We used to have lunch here quite often in the late 1990's but we will not be back. Things have steadily deteriorated the past couple of times we've been here. I don't think it's too much to ask for hot fries and to have an item you offer on the menu. Another example of the lack of quality and concern by chain restaurants!!!!'hmmm"
