R C.,"Metairie, LA",0,3,,1.0,8/4/2014,"I just got back to my computer after eating  at this place.  I walk in and it took 10 minutes to get a table, and there were about 20 tables available!  They seat me at a ""high table""...I am by myself, nice to be put on display for all to see.  The waiter comes over and asked what kind of drink I would like.  I told him I was ready to order.  I ordered a 9 oz. house steak ""medium"" and baked potato with sour cream and butter.  He said they only had broccoli for a vegetable.  I asked if I could substitute with a house salad and he said no substitutes.  Not everyone likes broccoli...I like raw broccoli with dip, but cooked is disgusting to me to begin with.  I have no options.  I've never been to a restaurant where you didn't have more than one choice for vegetable.  Amazing!   The meal is served 20 minutes later.  All half cold.  My steak was well done not medium, the baked potato only had a small amount of sour cream, and one broccoli stalk with small buds on the ends.  If this were marijuana, you wouldn't have enough to even catch a buzz.  This was my only choice of vegetable?  I cut off the stalk of the broccoli which was tough to cut even with a steak knife, and at the three bites of broccoli.  I had already waited 30 minutes to get the food, and experience has taught me that if you send your food back, guess what?  Yea, you get the replacement 15 to 20 minutes later.  At the point of seeing everything that was wrong, I just wanted to get the hell out of there.  The centerpiece that holds the salt was sticky when I turned it to reach the shakers.  Oh yea, of all the empty tables available when I came in, they seated me at a dirty table.  I told the waiter about it and he handed me 2 napkins.  WTF!  I got all this aggravation for the price of $16.00.  I could have had a great meal at Copelands for that price!  Sorry I made the mistake of eating at this place.  Amazing! I read every review of this restaurant and noticed that everyone said it sucked.  They are all correct in their assessment of this place.  What is even worse is that I'm sure the upper management and owners at this ""establishment"" read these complaints and choose not to do anything to correct them.  Not only should the restaurant manager be fired, the upper management should be also for allowing this to degenerate like this.  I hadn't eaten in a place this bad since Juarez, Mexico many years ago.  No, wait a minute...I think Juarez was better, and they actually put liquor in their drinks.  Amazing. To sum this complaint up, as long as there are low-standard expecting people eating here, it will remain in business.  My god, what do they eat at home to think that this place is "" really good""?  SHAME ON APPLEBEES...NEVER AGAIN WILL I EAT THERE!!!!!  Amazing! By the way, I had to put one star on this site or I couldn't continue.  It deserves NO STARS!!!   Close this dump!!!"
Lyndsie O.,"Covington, LA",0,3,,1.0,10/1/2012,"Horrible. Horrible food, horrible service. I just stared at 4 un-bussed tables piled high with dishes next to me. Watched 7 employees including the manager walk right passed them without glancing at it. This place is pathetic."
Eric S.,"Arabi, LA",29,173,74,2.0,6/11/2012,"Have had better at other places, a typical low grade chain restaurant. Normally i don't like to go to big chain restaurants because of the lack of individual personality. I went here for a Charitable Animals rights for life event where they got 20% of any flier brought it. Seating didn't take long, but on the way to the table you could smell a musky smell, like wet carpet but i blew it off. Our waitress was very nice and pleasing we got our drinks fast. We split the trio between 5 people, and i wish it was bigger i got a bite of each thing just enough to make me even more hungry for my main meal. I ordered the Shrimp and Steak under 500 cal meal w/ Broccoli n potatoes, Nearly everyone at the table ordered the same. We waited the normal time for our food to start arriving, everyone got there food except one. One persons food was little cold, other sauce was cold, my food was ok, but my steak had a odd texture like if it was over processed. we were nearly done our meals by the time the last persons food came out, and even then it wasn't fully heated. Ow everyone ordered med rare steaks and we all got medium to med well. I know i wont go back to this place unless its another Charity event. The staff is very nice and pleasing but that place needs a good cleaning and kitchen staff needs a refresher course on cooking."
Trent T.,"Kenner, LA",0,4,,1.0,1/15/2013,"My wife and I ate here with our 2yr old for dinner.  I ordered a Burger, my wife ordered a steak and our 2yr old had mac and cheese with chicken.  When we were seated the table was still dirty and the hostess just tried to cover the crumbs with the menu from what it seemed. I had to ask her to wipe the table for us.  We ordered and asked for our sons food to come out first.  It did, and the spoon they gave him was dirty.  We asked the server for another spoon and she brought  us plastic-ware which was nice... maybe she was thinking all the silverware would be dirty? (I'm glad she took the extra step to bring us something she knew would be clean.)  My burger was pretty good (a little on the small side but taste was OK.) As for my side dish of broccoli... a few bites in and I see a long hair... We asked for the manager and she took off my wife's meal as she did not eat much before losing her appetite from seeing the hair.  After explaining all of our issues to the manager she looked like it was a normal everyday thing.  The only positive thing I can say about this place was the server.. I don't remember her name for sure, but I think it was Jessica if I had to take a stab at it.  She did everything she could to correct the issues and was very sorry about everything.  Will not be back... If you are looking for a big chain restaurant to eat at, head up the road as there are others.."
Christopher W.,"Lafayette, LA",2,100,,2.0,2/16/2010,Applebee's has OK food and at a nice price. The waitress was friendly and helpful but the burger was to be desired. Avoid their burgers and go for the pasta
