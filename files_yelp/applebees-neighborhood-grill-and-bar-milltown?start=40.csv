S N.,"Old Bridge Township, NJ",0,10,3,3.0,3/13/2014,"Went for lunch, had the 2 for 20 with spinach and artichoke dip appetizer (nice and hot) my wife had chicken and I had the basket of ribs, not bad considering the price. Fabio, our server was efficient without really impressing, he dropped off our check without offering dessert. You have to adjust your expectations to where you are, we would go back."
Clinton A.,"East Brunswick, NJ",0,20,,1.0,12/11/2013,"Still on my boycott list. 5 to 6 years ago, their nacho's gave bad food poisoning. Filed a corporate complaint, only to be called by the owner, and deny that their food caused me to miss two days of work. Don't eat the nacho"
David S.,"East Brunswick, NJ",0,15,,3.0,8/31/2012,We've been here several times since moving to East Brunswick.  We've never had a bad meal or service.  It's the place we'll go to when we just want a reliable meal and don't have a specific cuisine in mind.
