Julie H.,"Ontario, CA",29,204,1396,4.0,12/7/2017,"It was surprisingly busy for a Wednsday night. They tried to sit us at a tiny table next to the kitchen. But we didn't want that one. So we got one next to the door. Boo! Lol. There were a couple other booths open but for some reason they wanted to give us the crappy tables. Oh well. We ordered drinks first which were Captain Bahama Mamas. They were really good. I didn't even taste alcohol in them, which must mean they're water down, because I hate the taste of alcohol, and most drinks are usually too strong for me. We also ordered one of the blue Hawaiian Long Island Iced Teas. I could taste a little alcohol in that one. It was a good drink though. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer. They give you a ton of chips and a tiny tiny bit of dip. The dip is very good though. Has a huge glob of mozzarella cheese on top, which I accidentally ate in one bite thinking it was a big piece of artichoke LOL. I ordered the barbecue brisket tacos. Those are pretty good. They had some crunchy fried onions on it, some salsa, and a little sauce. I added sour cream. You got three of them and they're good sized. They come with fries which were absolutely amazing. They are seasoned fries, and I loved them. And a tiny little thing of coleslaw, which was okay. Nothing special. Hubby got the six ounce steak with the fried mushrooms and onion, although they forgot the mushrooms and just put onion. And he added a butter sauce to it which was really yummy. It came with steamed broccoli and hashbrown casserole, which wasn't the best thing ever. Had an odd taste to it. It was nice inside. Super busy, but not super loud. I think it was a little louder for us, since we were right by the door. Our server would disappear for long periods at a time, but she was very friendly. She was busy so it was understandable. It was a good meal and we will be back."
Rick R.,"Corona, CA",41,55,25,4.0,11/26/2017,"Haven't been to this location a while, even though it's right near my house. I usually split a two-for 25.00, or however much it is, it's usually great deal. Feeling a bit under the weather just for soup today, I ordered the chicken tortilla soup. It was just ok and the portion was 1/2 a cup at best. Not a good value.  On the other hand, my server, Brandon F made it a good experience. Only because he was fast, very friendly and seemed to genuinely care.  I'll go back, but not for the soup..."
Aiden S.,"Brea, CA",0,144,53,5.0,10/11/2017,Got the 2 for $20 deal. The burger and the chicken breast plate.  The burger was juicy and had lots of flavor. The chicken plate was moist and the sides were delicious.  4 cheese Mac and Cheese was prepared just right. The mashed potatoes were fresh and good. Overall had an excellent time. Our server Jessica was attentive and great! Will definitely be back soon.
Jennifer D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",3509,545,5983,4.0,1/5/2018,This location is very convenient right off of the freeway. I met some friends in the bar area and did not have to wait. We had super fast service and the food was good. I like the new menus and healthy selections they offer. The garlic green beans were yummy. Everything is reasonably priced and you will not break the bank if you take your family. The restrooms were well maintained. Overall good experience.
Adriana G.,"Eastvale, CA",64,123,222,4.0,6/22/2017,"Applebee's is a family staple, and having frequented quite a few across the state, this Eastvale location has proven to be one of the best.  Like many Applebee's, this restaurant is located in a shopping center - the Eastvale Gateway, to be exact.  Either before or after your meal, you can enjoy a Target run, grab some tech at Best Buy, shop the deals at Kohls or TJ Maxx, or catch the latest flick at the Regal theater just a few steps away.  Parking is generally adequate, however due to close proximity to a Carino's restaurant, it can get busy at peak ""eating out"" times (Friday/Saturday/Sunday evenings).  Given its newness, the facilities feel updated and there have even been some minor furniture renovations in recent years.  The decor features the local culture of Eastvale, which is fun given that the city was incorporated in 2010. The menu is clear and easy to read, boasting a good variety of foods.  Something Applebee's gets right is the inclusion of calories with every menu item.  The definitely helps me make better dinner choices and I appreciate the gesture and wish more restaurants would do the same.  They frequently refresh their menu with rotating items and there are always a few good options regardless of your calorie intake.  There is even a smaller-portioned dessert - the brownie bite (360 cal) - for those who have a sweet tooth but don't want to waste a whole meal's worth of calories on it. Options for kids are pretty standard and they do offer healthier sides, although my children always opt for the fries. The service is usually great, and sometimes there are standouts, like Ginger who was extremely kind to me and my children this evening.   Overall, you can't go wrong with this Applebee's, although we do like to avoid the busiest times so as not to have to wait for a table."
Anthony M.,"Ontario, CA",3,50,21,1.0,10/11/2017,"We came here to have appetizers and a drink only to find out that the New manager here had taken away all bar seating. The only option you have now is to wait for a seat in the whole place or eat and have a drink on the bar. We can't stand that type of dining and drinks. Sitting at a bar and having to eat there is kinda gross to us.  Taking bar seating away from people who come to the bar to have a drink kinda defeats the purpose. We could have sat at a booth where we were only taking a spot for up to 4 people, but instead put us on a table for 6. Not very smart"
Joe G.,"Eastvale, CA",407,550,5221,4.0,1/23/2017,"I remember when Applebee's was all the buzz. It was a place I would frequent with college classmates and eventually became a regular rotation for the family. The Eastvale location has been a regular part of my family since moving here 6 years ago; offers a simple and easy menu to please every eater. It has been a long time since eating at this location, probably since I have been into Yelp, so this place doesn't offer that excitement like most new spots. Kids wanted to eat here, so I decided to entertain their idea since they usually accompany me on most of my Yelp adventures.  Restaurant is family friendly and offers a separate bar area for those who want to escape the dining area. I like to dine in the bar area but now there is a waiting list when it is busy inside. Service is usually a bit slower because there are only a couple of servers covering about 15 tables. The bartender covers the bar area, people sitting at the bar, and the restaurant.  Kid's meals are simple and do not come overloaded with food. I think it is the perfect amount for a small child. I do enjoy the lighter calorie meals. You can even get a semi-decent steak here for under $15. I like the portion sizes for the regular meals as well. I like to get the salads and ask for the dressing on the side because the cooks usually drench it and you will have lettuce that floats.  Happy hour menu is just okay. I have seen it evolve over the years. The HH menu was great back in the day but now they have limited to just a few items. I tried the won ton tacos. The tacos were surprisingly good but would easily fit in the palm of your hand. Everyone is nice at this location. In fact, I do not think I have ever had a negative experience at any Applebee's besides the wait time on food. Whenever they are semi-busy it seems to take forever for your order to show. Drinks are good. Nice to see they still had my good old friend Brewtus. This location is cool. Easy place to grab a bite and see some familiar faces working. Inexpensive place to feed the family. Try them out."
Carrie T.,"Corona, CA",42,17,8,1.0,11/2/2017,I  order to go and this women kaylin forgot have my order I waited. 45 min she said it would take 17 min. What kind of place is this
Manuel N.,"Corona, CA",50,39,2,1.0,12/6/2017,Place was not what I expected don't know if it's the area of what but service was horrible. I'm a big fan of them but certainly not his location. Service and food was bad. Got my hot wings 25 minutes after I ordered and they were cold. Seemed as they didn't place them inside the microwave long enough. Sorry but besides the drink I had I won't be out in Eastvale's Applebees again!
Kaitlynn P.,"Jurupa Valley, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/11/2017,"I had a horrible experience. I was served by a bartender named trista. She was very verbal about who and what she was doing to the point where me and my husband were bothered. We were finally greeted by her after she ""took the time"" to say hi. We felt like we were an inconvenience. We let the lack of attention go until she started talking about he sex life and white supremacy. We felt like we had no place like we had to leave because we were in her bar and if we didn't like it then oh well. I'm sickened and completely disturbed and we are more bothered that nothing is going to change for her to not be able to do what she is doing. That is not ok"
Yi J.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,17,220,4.0,2/8/2017,"Always go here late night for some appetizers or a light meal. Service is always good and the food is great. Except one time when the ribs were overcooked and with minimal meat. I've had their Honey BBQ Chicken, Chicken and Rice, Wonton chicken/beef Tacos, Sweet Potato fries and American Burger. (Been always ordering the same thing.) All are delicious. Some days tastes better than others.  The wonton tacos would be the one thing that I recommend. During happy hour they're half price for $4 and you get 4 pieces. Sometimes they require you to order a drink.  Long Beach Ice tea is good if you like Raspberry Ice Tea.  Great place to go for a late snack!"
Kyri D.,"Riverside, CA",90,3,,1.0,10/21/2017,The manager Julio is a disrespectful jerk. I had my ID checked by my waiter and ordered a beer. When they ran out of the beer I asked for his other manager lied about it (Hispanic lady didn't get her name) and then asked to see my ID again. When I refused he refused to give me a beer. My waiter Brandon was great and definitley has a better capacity to manage than punk ass racist Julio. Here we are an hour later after arriving at 12 with no food and having to fight for a beer. Julio sucks fire him. I personally know managers at other Apple Bees and they never disrespect thier clients this way. Terrible experience! Fire Julio!!
Ana Liz L.,"Los Angeles, CA",100,42,55,5.0,4/8/2017,"I love this bee's, they have excellent customer service. Everyone here is polite, nice and on top of things. I receive my drinks quickly and the servers check on you frequently.  I have had a few minor requests and they were quick to honor it.  Anyway i love this place!!"
A M.,"Corona, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/10/2017,"Was here last night and manager was more concerned about having his employees work than the health and well being of his staff and people dining. The person I was dining with and I overheard a female employee telling the manager she didn't feel well and had the chills. He told her she could go home but later we saw him make her take more tables even after telling him she had been getting sick in the bathroom!!!! This is not okay!!!! I do not want to risk getting sick because the manager can not handle letting someone go when they are THROWING UP on their shift! That poor waitress needed to be sent home immediately and not made a hazard to everyone's health!! Will not be going here again, horrible!"
Dwayne S.,"Glendora, CA",40,46,16,1.0,7/20/2017,"This Applebee's service totally sucks! Trying to call in a phone order for my wife and daughter was a 15 minute nightmare! Unfortunately this store seems to be run by a bunch of children and when you speak to the manager, You would think they would have some sense to step up to the plate and handle your order, maybe even give you discount? No, not here! No more business for this place! After trying to explain "" lettuce wrap "" with a hamburger and the response I got was,""a hold on I can't find it in the computer!""  We do this at all the Applebee's but I guess this one is just too young and too naïve to do anything about handling the customers! What a shame! IM VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
Giselle V.,"Irvine, CA",213,282,1594,4.0,7/26/2016,"I'm really happy that Applebee's as a franchise has changed its menu significantly over the years to offer food that would seem more appealing.  Unfortunately the food still isn't that great, but I don't think that has anything to do with this establishment in particular and it's more of a franchise issue. The appetizers are pretty good, but the main courses leave a lot to be desired. However, the service here is great. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure that we had everything we needed the whole time. The manager even replaced my daughter's meal after she had gotten it because she ended up not liking it.  This would be a good place to come to if you wanted to get some drinks and appetizers."
Bea P.,"Eastvale, CA",29,9,4,5.0,9/15/2017,"Vanessa was our server & she is AWESOME! She is attentive, makes recommendations & makes things right if they wrong. The Eastvale Applebees is different than the other Applebees locations. The vibe is fun & energetic. Have tried the other locations w/friends & always come back to Eastvale for a good & happy experience!"
James E.,"Norco, CA",10,70,2,5.0,1/25/2017,"Pretty great service and food! I think the lady who served us was named Aioa? I don't remember as it's a hard and unique name (in a good way tho!) She was just amazing. She was able to handle all 5 of us, which isn't an easy task for usual waitresses. She was nice and a great listener! The food, was spectacular. The best chicken I've ever had, the best sauces, the best salad, even the best strawberry lemonade! My wife didn't really like the taste of her plate, she thought it needed more salt or something. I believe it was a chicken Alfredo. But everything else was just amazing and my whole family loved it! Will definitely return again! My ONLY complaint is they didn't really handle bringing out things too well... They brought all the drinks, but didn't bring my lemonade until minutes later. Then, everyone's salad came but mine, and no one brought it! Next thing I know everyone is done with their salads and they're bringing out the main entree's and I'm like, uh, I never got my salad! The waitress quickly brought it but it was a bit upsetting nonetheless. Other then that, keep up the good work!"
Robert V.,"Upland, CA",3,21,16,5.0,6/30/2017,"Larry is the man! The second time we came in, he remembered our favorite and since then has given us exceptional service. We tried an other applebees but Larry has spoiled us. Their happy hour is amazing and even when they are busy, Larry takes care of you."
Ana C.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/21/2017,I'll just copy and paste what I sent to corporate  Hi I visited one of your restaurants in eastvale I ordered the chicken quesadilla appetizers and when I bit into it it had a faul taste Immidiatly rushed to the restroom and threw up my food I asked to speak to a manager and she told me it was bacon that it comes with bacon and told me and there was nothing else she could tell me i told her none of the other pieces have that smell or that brown stuff in them Then asked her if she could smell it bc it didn't smell like baconshe refused and went to the back she came back and said it was seasoning I told her it's really hard to believe it smell like a bunch of chemicals and grese it made me throw up  and she was being extremely rude and told me i didn't have to believe her. I'm contacting you because I don't wanna have to go threw a lawyer i will contact news channel as I kept the quesadilla and will have it tested if you can't provide me with a solution to this situation. What was in my quesadilla was not edible!! The managers name was huyapa
Hany A.,"Los Angeles, CA",85,21,60,4.0,1/31/2017,"Hanging there with my family for a lunch, Great place to go, people there are smiling & helpful. Foods we ordered were yummy! Will come again sure!"
Sandy P.,"Norco, CA",19,6,,2.0,5/8/2017,"Pretty disappointed in this establishment. We've stopped coming for a while due to the uncleanliness of the restaurant, but decided to give it another try. We sat at the bar, ordered drinks and opened our silverware... my fork still had rice remain between the prongs and my guest had lettuce wrapped theirs - gross. We asked for plastic cutlery (like the ones they give the take out orders) and even that had been previously opened. One bonus star to Larry who accommodated us and brought us another -unopened-set. When the beers finally arrived I noticed there was still lipstick marks on the rim and enough fingerprints to supply a lifetime of Clue games. Bartender was cool and swapped is for ""fresh"" new glasses... at this point we were ready to say screw it and leave, but Larry assured us and the food was already on it's way out. Luckily we just had a couple appetizers.  Long story short- this place isn't what it used to be and hasn't changed much for the better in the past 10 months."
Stevan M.,"Riverside, CA",21,1,,5.0,7/19/2017,"I come here all the time! Happy hour is awesome but nothing beats lunch with Lyndsey she always makes my girlfriend and I feel at home, she knows the best foods on the menu , like the quesadilla burger and she always makes sure we are completely taken care of. It's always clean and the staff is great. We will definitely be back!"
Hannah L.,"Corona, CA",0,2,,2.0,10/5/2017,"Omg the service here is ridiculously slow. Came in on a Thursday before 5 pm and it wasn't even packed. It took about ten mins until someone finally came to the table, we immediately ordered because who knew how long it would have taken until someone finally would come back. It took over an hour just to get our food, you would have thought they went to kill the cow with the time they were taking. Hands down this was the worst Applebee's experience I have ever had and will never come to the eastvale location. Oh and to top it off the food wasn't even properly cooked."
Rita A.,"Mira Loma, CA",15,47,4,1.0,3/26/2017,"This place keeps getting worse and worse. I went there on Friday for a coworker farewell dinner and our server was a total airhead. I'm not going to mention her name out of respect, but seriously, not only is the food disgusting but the service sucked! Maybe Eastvale city can have Applebee's leave and we can get a better one such as Chili's."
Scott C.,"Corona, CA",0,42,,1.0,7/17/2017,Haven't been to Applebee's in years!  Can't figure out why I don't eat here more often.  The food and the service was great and I really truly always enjoy it.   Again can't figure out why I don't come more often because I do eat out a lot  Update...!  What a nightmare this place was this time. No staff to get anything done. I feel like we are hassling the server if we ask for plates or silverware. He's acting out out because they can't get their act together. Been here a hour and still no food. And yes it's been a full hour.  Saw two people walk in and they left because they weren't ever even greeted or led to a table. What a stark difference from before. Not sure what happened but there's barely and customers here and yet they still can't have even a 1 out of 10 when it comes to service.
Estefania S.,"Covina, CA",73,23,14,1.0,2/18/2017,"One of the worst sirloin steaks I have ever had. For the past few visits this place has been getting my order wrong when I order a sirloin steak. I ask for a medium well I get overly cooked. I ask for a medium rare I'm practically eating the cow as soon as they butcher it. Who is managing this kitchen that the chefs don't realize they have clearly over cooked my steak. They do they just don't care and don't want to waste money on starting on a new piece. As a customer I feel cheated because they are pretty much saying ""hey you ordered a medium well steak but we messed up so here you go. Enjoy!"""
Mrs. B.,"Riverside, CA",20,114,83,1.0,3/27/2017,"The food here was disgusting! I've never had Applebee's until Sunday and I was not impressed. I ordered some new fire cracker shrimp pasta it was like warm not spicy like the waitress said it would be and it was tasteless. The food taste old wasn't fresh at all, I'm shocked because my grandma always talks about how great the food is we were better off going to home town buffet I'm disappointed"
Brett M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,98,36,4.0,8/13/2016,Stopped by this afternoon with a bunch of families and boys with a soccer team.  We showed up before they opened and once they opened they took care of us so very well.  Very courteous and patient and made sure we were well taken care of.   The waitress was absolutely wonderful and had a smile the whole time.  Took care of all of the checks separately and did it with a smile.   My only complaint was I ordered a sirloin salad and the meat was very tough.  And there was not a lot of it.  Salad was decent.  Lots of dressing.   But very impressed with the service.   Most places get grouchy when a team walks in.  This place was great.
Watchman K.,"Corona, CA",82,94,566,5.0,1/14/2016,"We are regulars every Thursday, we have had ok service to horrible service but now... it's amazing.... We have our regular server Trista in the bar area.. If it wasn't for her service and her attentiveness we would not have been back. She knows what we want before we even ask! She always has a smile on her face.  Her tentativeness is very appreciated after a long work week.  Keep up the great work Trista!! Much appreciated..  Thursday regulars! Torres family"
Destiny M.,"Pomona, CA",72,16,3,5.0,1/21/2017,Sydney is AMAZING! I will totally come back for the amazing service from her. She made sure that we left the restaurant happy and for that I can't wait to return
Megan U.,"Diamond Bar, CA",303,22,,5.0,12/19/2016,Sara is wonderful! I have been here a few times since my bf and I have moved to the area. Coincidentally every time we come here Sara is the bartender. She is attentive and sweet. She is so fun to talk to...which is the best part of going to a bar right! Hehehe
Jose U.,"Rialto, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/1/2017,"Hey All,  Although I have never really been much of a Yelp reviewer, I felt that this particular experience at this Applebee's warranted coming onto this site and making an account.  On January 29th, 2017, I decided to meet up with some old friends for food and drinks at this location. Although, admittedly, Applebee's food and drinks don't necessarily blow me away, we figured why not, considering it was on the way to our destination. The reason for this review is for one thing only: TO PRAISE OUR SERVER MARK! In the 23 years that I have been on this Earth, I have never had a server as attentive, funny and just downright good at his job at this guy. As soon as we walked into the restaurant, we were greeted by the host and Mark immediately stepped in, asking us how our day had been so far and showing up to a table large enough to fit our group. Upon being seated, he was quick to offer up some drink recommendations and even quicker to input what we had selected into the computers. I ordered the BBQ wings and our group ordered a combination of platters, other flavors of wings and several types of drinks. I don't even think that 10 minutes passed before our food started arriving at our table. Out of all of our orders (there were 7 of us), Mark didn't even miss one thing... not even getting one of the orders of wing dry with the sauce on the side (you'd be surprised how many restaurants mess this little thing up). The entire time that we were waiting, Mark checked in on us a couple of times and always made sure to refill our waters. This was probably one of the few times that I haven't felt like I was dying of thirst before my server refilled me! As we ate, drank and caught up with each other, I could see that Mark wasn't just attentive to our table, but to everybody else's as well. Even when a customer complained that that she had received the wrong drink, he had no problem going right back up to the bartender and bringing back a correctly made (and probably stiff!) drink. A couple with a child came into the restaurant a short while after my group and Mark kindly asked us if we could scoot our two tables over to make room for this couple and their baby, which we did. In the end, my party was there for a few hours and the entire time, Mark never let our continuous calling of him to our table frustrate him or obstruct any aspect of his workflow. If all servers were as professional as he was, Applebee's would rake in the big bucks.  At the end of the day, I hope somebody from management sees this and rewards Mark or something! They'd be wrong to not do something for I will forever consider one of their best employees."
Ashley S.,"Norco, CA",44,43,59,5.0,12/31/2016,"Vanessa is the best! She knew we had a short timeframe and got us ordered and served, swiftly! The food was great as well!"
Britney M.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",217,625,1057,4.0,9/26/2015,"So I'm not a huge fan of Applebee's but the service was good and the food was decent. We stuck just to happy hour specials so the check was super cheap considering all the food we ordered! I believe we ordered like 5 different appetizers; mozzarella sticks, chicken tacos, buffalo wings, artichoke dip, and a kids meal pizza with fries. The bill was so freaking cheap since happy hour prices are half off! Wooohoooo. Pretty awesome. Our waitress was very attentive and food came out pretty quick and was nice and hot. Overall good experience! Oh yeah we did desert the butter cake with nuts and frosting. Soooo good it melted in your mouth and was like eating buttery heaven!"
Stephanie V.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,12,,4.0,3/13/2017,"The 4 stars is for the food in general, I've been here a few times and it was either a hit or miss. Best thing I've tried here was the chicken with tortilla strips. The service, however, 5 stars! Our waitress was Ginger and I loved how positive she was. I'm picky when it comes to service and of course I'm not expecting the best for a place like Applebees, but Ginger really made the top of the list as for service wise. She had such a bubbly personality and gave great suggestions and told us what she liked off the menu and she didn't seem to be in a hurry to leave us (even though she had other tables) which makes the customers feel important. Definitely will be asking for Ginger whenever we decide to eat here and really recommend her to be your waitress!"
Aluxa C.,"Henderson, NV",69,48,41,4.0,9/11/2016,"Best happy hour, great place for us to stop and watch the game and have a few drinks the food was quick atmosphere not very inviting will be back had a great time"
Erica M.,"Jurupa Valley, CA",17,7,,5.0,3/30/2017,"I absolutely love this Applebee's. They always have the best service. Especially a tall blond that is a server there. I am just sad I can't remember her name. She was amazing. Very quick, sweet and friendly. Made my family and I feel very welcomed. Their mud slides are the best!!"
Diana B.,"Long Beach, CA",0,40,5,1.0,5/14/2016,First time here in a long time lastnight . This is one of the few places to go at night in Eastvale other than BWW anyway wait was okay . Service was horrible ! I don't know if our waiter was overwhelmed or not but he did not pay attention to us our food took 25 min to arrive he didn't check on us at allll we wanted another drink it took home about 20 min to come and ask us if we needed anything drinks took along time to Come we literally waited about 15 min maybe even 20 seemed like forever when we would ordered more drinks he said the bar was backed up well I suggest knowing there is nothing to do in Eastvale you know Friday and Saturday is going to be busy be more staffed . My steak was tough over cooked I ate it I figured why send it back it'll take another 30 min just like it did the first time .
Karla G.,"Pomona, CA",4,5,1,5.0,8/5/2017,I love coming to this Applebee's everyone is always so nice especially Ginger we always seem to get her as a waitress and she's outstanding. She is so sweet and polite.
