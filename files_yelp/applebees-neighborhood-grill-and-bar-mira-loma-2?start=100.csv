Danae J.,"Chino, CA",0,11,3,1.0,10/17/2015,"Horrible service takes 10 minutes every time just to get your drinks. It's my fault for trying it again. Three times I came three times they messed up the order forgot stuff,  how hard is it up cook a burger well done without soggy pink limp bacon. It wasn't even the right burger either."
Star M.,"Eastvale, CA",108,26,2,1.0,6/4/2015,Customer Service has little to be desired slow and forgot basic ice tea for my mom had to ask 2x for hers food is  so so
Brian P.,"Anaheim, CA",149,53,186,1.0,3/5/2015,"So the food has not changed, still low grade terrible food which was no shocker yet a real disappointment.  Was hoping to come in with fresh new food with an increase in quality.  I was let down. Service was great but let's be honest I'm here for the food, after all I'm spending my cash.  Applebee's this will be my last and final try with you.  You just serve crap quality food."
Harold G.,"Ontario, CA",0,12,,1.0,9/1/2014,Places is the worst.. services i guess is discretion on who they feel they want there..you guys are still  lucky to be in buisness i guess the trademark mashpotatoes  is the only thing keeps u in buisness.
Crystal C.,"Norco, CA",34,31,17,3.0,4/27/2015,Not necessarily horrible but not all that great ---at least they get your drink order correct...... Three stars for the sports bar area definitely entertaining
Steven D.,"Fullerton, CA",98,18,1,2.0,3/19/2015,"Every time I come here I always regret coming after my meal, service was good not amazing but it's Apple Bees what else do you expect. The food is the main concern nothing is good with the exception of the chicken wonton tacos which are mediocre at best."
Tiffany N.,"Westminster, CA",27,52,38,1.0,3/16/2015,"My girlfriend and I entered the building and we were greeted with a smiling face - what a good  hostess, probably the best employee there. We were promptly seated and the hostess was excited to tell us of their custom tablets that could be used to order appetizers and desserts, or even pay the bill. Our server came over and this is when it all went downhill. She was friendly and smiling the entire time through. She offered us FRESH strawberry lemonade, my girlfriend's favorite, with strawberries in it. She took my order as well, a root beer. She came back with our drinks and informed us the restaurant was out of strawberries (really? At 3pm? The restaurant was practically empty), but instead of asking us if we wanted something else to substitute the drink, because the fresh strawberries was what my girlfriend had been hoping for, our sever just brought out pink lemonade from the tap and still charged us the full price. She also brought raspberry ice tea. Not even close to soda, and put it on the bill as ""pepsi"". Then we went to ordering ""2 appetizers for 9.50"" the menu said. Our server failed to tell us that the tablet didn't have the option of doing the combo deal so we ordered two regular sized appetizers thinking we would still get the 9.50 deal. Then I ordered the pepper crusted steak with whole grains, medium rare. My girlfriend ordered the chicken tenders platter for her sister that was with us (literally the ONLY thing they got right). Our server left, another table was seated in front of us, business went on. The appetizers were alright. Spinach artichoke dip had very thin chips, every single chip broke as you tried to dip them, not to mention they were unevenly salted (one would be bland the other would be just a thing full of salt). The siracha shrimp was alright. Nothing special. It was fried shrimp with a very salty, not so siracha flavored coating.  Then the table in front of us got their food. Excuse me? We had gotten there first, and we both ordered steaks, different kinds, but how does your kitchen work when a customer who orders practically half an hour after you get their food first? Anyway. Our food eventually came out. My steak? Well done. I asked for medium rare. I had the food sent back. The chicken tenders were made perfect fine. My steak came back out. Medium well, close to well done again. I said ""forget it. Sure my steak is fine"". I took a bite: chewy and not seasoned at all. I took a bite of the rice and spinach and tomatoes that came with the dish and it was disgusting. I can't really describe the taste for you other than it was very chewy, the spinach tasted over cooked, and the tomatoes were filled with the seasoning but in juice form.  Absolutely tired and disappointed with the food, I asked for a box when the waitress came by. I paid while I waited. The box never came. The server was off helping 2 other tables. Let's talk about the service. Like I mentioned the hostess was great- friendly, energetic, a smile the entire time. Our waitress was nice as well, but not very helpful. She decided to check on us either too frequently at the wrong time, or not enough at the right time. She asked us how our food was, but our appetizers hadn't  been on the table for more than 2 minutes. Then she wasn't very courteous about placement of food either, she shoved and placed the plates wherever she felt she could put them. Then she asked us again in a very quiet, mumbled voice,  5 minutes later with our mouths full. I had to ask her to repeat herself. Then when our actual food came out, she was no where to be found. She did ask how it was and proceeded to walk away when we hesitated to answer about the incorrect cooking of the steak. She politely took the plate back and got a new entree done. Two minutes after receiving it, and putting a small piece in my mouth, she came up from behind and asked ""how's your steak?"" - somewhat creepily. I was startled and had a mouth full, and just answered ""oh it's fine"" before really getting to taste it, but she scurried away. The steak actually was under seasoned and medium well, close to well done again. Then we never saw her until she passed by us to help another customer. When I confronted her about the appetizer deal, she tried to explain it as ""oh the deal has smaller portions..."" and I said, ""The tablet doesn't have the option... It just says what you can order"". She looked flustered (even though she knew we were going to order appetizers since we sat down and TOLD her we were going to order them from the tablet) and proceeded to try and scurry away to try and attempt to get someone to help her. I just was over it at this point and said ""it's fine, though"". Though next time, they should tell their customers that since the tablets are KNEW, they should feel free to ask the server for help or just have the server take the order. Not a happy customer. We will NOT be returning to ANY Applebee's restaurant."
Jason P.,"Corona, CA",112,36,15,1.0,4/4/2014,"So....I am not the type of person to write a negative review, but our experience at Applebee's in Eastvale (on Limonite w/15 Fwy) was absolutely horrible! My wife and I went there with our 2 boys, plus our friends and their son.  It was semi busy, wait time for a table was about 10 min and the server was friendly. But honestly, I think he and all the employees were overwhelmed.  We ordered our food and first, they brought out a wrong order. Our appetizer never came out. 6 out of the 7 meals came out and the last one finally came out 10 min later.  My 2 year old sons Mac n cheese had a long, black, curly hair in it....it was mixed into the food!   The manager on-duty came by, apologized and knocked off $10, but we weren't looking for a hook up, we were looking for them to say something like ""we are sorry that is a hair from the line"", but instead, he said ""wow, we don't do that""!  Really?!?! Anyways, hope your experience isn't as bad as ours...."
Janelle A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",96,70,12,1.0,2/15/2015,"Really disappointed that this place does not offer ANY vegetarian alternatives other than a salad. Although our server was really sweet, she did not seem to have a clue as to whether or not there were any vegetarian alternatives. We waited for 10 minutes for her to tell us that they no longer even serve veggie burgers. Yard House has an entire vegetarian menu, Johnny Rockets, Denny's, even Farmer Boys has plenty of vegetarian alternatives. AppleBees definitely needs to catch up. Hoping to see a change of heart sometime soon."
Patricia G.,"San Francisco, CA",14,43,15,1.0,1/29/2015,"Horrible experience!!! Had no clue thy put onions in Mac and Cheese. Not impressed at all. Server told the manger, more then half way through my co workers meals I was offered another dish. But by then I had no interest in ordering anything else, plus we were running late already. Only took off a few bucks off the bill. Not from the area and will never come here again or recommend to my any of my co workers! Go somewhere else not this location."
Purple K.,"Chino Hills, CA",37,38,126,5.0,1/8/2015,"love the bartnder in eastvale, ca... larry!"
Kay B.,"Corona, CA",21,47,7,4.0,3/7/2015,"I have had a lot of not so great experiences with Applebee's, but I have to say that I like this place a lot the servers are very nice the managers are really good on making sure that everything is going well for you. Good job. Love this place. Can't wait to be back for another meal."
Jay M.,"Ontario, CA",7,16,,2.0,3/7/2015,"UGHHH. So, my friend and I get to applebees and are seated promptly. We waited a little over 15 minutes for a server (We had to call one over to our table.) So, we order drinks and are also ready to order food but our server walked away once he took our drink order. Having to wait about another 15 minutes so we can order. We finally order and the food is fine. We get ready to go and my friend asked for a box. (I knew that was going to be another 15 minutes.) Sure enough, I was right, the waiter completely forgot and was chatting with another employee and went to go sing, ""Happy Birthday"" to another table.. Patiently waiting still no box (I'm ready to go.) So after a couple of minutes I just get up and ask someone else for a box.  Our server seemed very dismissive towards us and I felt like we weren't getting the same quality of service as other tables."
Darryl M.,"Eastvale, CA",60,95,107,5.0,10/11/2013,"As far as I'm concerned.. Applebee's in Eastvale has turned it around! Maybe they were having a bad day on my last visit, but this time everything was excellent. I had the Signature Sirloin with Garlic Herb Shrimp and and both the steak and shrimp were excellent. Steak was tender and cooked perfectly, the shrimp was fresh and not over cooked. My wife & kids had the Checken Tenders Basket and I had a few pieces of that and the Honey Mustard Sauce is addictive. In addition to the excellent food, the service was excellent as well. Greeter opened the door for us and sat us promptly. The dinning room and restrooms was very clean too. We will be back soon, thank you Applebee's for the nice dinning experience!"
Jay R.,"Corona, CA",118,60,127,5.0,12/7/2013,"We eat here all the time "" lunch combo "" salad and half a sandwich ..... But today I wanted Steak and OMG  the garlic potatoes is to die for you have to try it"
Tanya K.,"Ontario, CA",16,6,,4.0,2/9/2015,"Love this place come here all the time for happy hour,  would be 5 stars, but they are always slow no matter what  day of the week you come. Food takes a while, thank goodness for those drinks."
Cassie C.,"Jurupa Valley, CA",0,38,,4.0,2/15/2016,The service here has steadily improved. The food is always good if a little overpriced. We usually sit in the bar area and are well taken care of.
DeShon H.,"Corona, CA",0,29,8,4.0,11/19/2014,My family and I eat here about once a month the food is always good. We have never had any issues that could not be fixed. The staff is very attentive and respectful.
Cassy G.,"The Strip, Las Vegas, NV",61,3,,3.0,12/24/2014,"Hubby and I went last night, food was good but the service was just ok it was a little slow she was just rude and seem like we where bugging her for coming in, but since it was the holiday I give her a break and still tipped over 20% to hopefully make her day. But don't think we will be going back anytime soon."
Madison P.,"Riverside, CA",56,80,9,5.0,9/6/2015,"My family and I went in for lunch, and received the best service I've had at this location..... And when my son forgot his toy car at the table, the manager actually ran it out to our car before we left. I think his name was Raphael? Thanks so much!"
