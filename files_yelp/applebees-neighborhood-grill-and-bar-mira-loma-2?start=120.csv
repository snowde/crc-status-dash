Blog S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",5,40,3,1.0,11/23/2013,"Price: Affordable, Starts at around $10 to $15?) Food: 1 to 2 star average (It's gross) Service: Somewhat slow and rude at times Decor: Contemporary with bar on the other side, night club conducive View: Parking lot and streets Outdoor seating?: Don't know Parking?: Plentiful Noise Level: Noisy What is up with the gross ass food?  It doesn't matter which Applebee's you go to, they pride themselves with preservative laden, too salty, gross stank food.  If you were to ask corporate about their food, they'd give you politician lie drivel.  Will never eat there again . I don't even go if people invite me.  Last time I was there I asked for lemonade and the waitress brings me something made from a packet mix. Really? People are supposed to be satisfied with that? How much freaking trouble and why is it too much to ask to squeeze a lemon and put sweet water in a glass? The mix tastes disgusting. Gee the bar has tons of lemons, so the lame excuse of a response, "" Oh we can't do that"" is not only lame, it is rude. Their menu is strange and for some reason seems very limited in choice. And they don't like substitution requests or modifications, not even simple ones. Some of the food at this place is ok, but not outstanding, and some of it is gross and has too much of a chemical taste. I believe restaurants like this are trying to weed dining customers out and focus on and expand the bar, because that's where the real profits are. You certainly don't go to places like this for the food, or do you? And if so, why? It's gross, one preservative or another and far too much salt The ambiance is urban sprawl casual with views of the parking lot, street and stores in certain corners of the restaurant. There is a huge bar on the other side. The design inside reminds me of The Outback, (same company?)  but I like the Outback. Applebees? No. ______________________ Most recent  visit was in November of  2014 for Veteran's Day.  After the chubby waitress spilled iced tea all over the table  and  my friend, she had the nerve to charge for the splash of cranberry drink I ordered on top of my iced tea (50 cents) Seriously Applebees? If it were up to me, she wouldn't have gotten any tip. As usual the food wasn't all that great The highlight of this visit was the distinctly nervous male host. That wasn't unpleasant though, it was just funny."
Tran D.,"Corona, CA",14,11,,4.0,10/10/2014,"Family outing happy hour at 9 pm tonight.  The place was packed and we waited 10 mins only.  It was way shorter than expected 25 mins wait :).  The waiter took our orders foods and drinks at the same time so we got our foods really fast.  They forgot our wings order so the manager came by, apologized and deducted it for us and got it packed Togo for us.  What a great customer service they have here.  I will definitely come back here again. My kids love the apps games here to and we had a great time tonight playing with the photo app."
Phillip M.,"Fontana, CA",7,4,8,5.0,10/3/2014,Nice and chill environment. Bar is nice and food comes out pretty quick. No complaints.
Lauren K.,"Mira Loma, CA",0,23,,1.0,10/2/2014,"Their food is usually undercooked and almost always salty. I don't know why I continue to come here, probably because of convenience, but I am disappointed in my meals almost every single time. This location really needs to improve on the food they send out."
Ami F.,"Corona, CA",13,21,17,4.0,4/19/2014,We went here for dinner tonight and ordered 2 new items from their 2 for $20 menu and was impressed with the quality of food and service. Our waiter Daniel was polite and made sure we were taken care of.
Bonnie P.,"Jurupa Valley, CA",180,342,83,2.0,2/25/2012,"Three Strikes you're OUT! I hadn't been here for a couple of YEARS as my past experience was AWFUL FOOD.  So just stayed away. A friend of mine wanted to meet for lunch and said ""how about Applebee's""  I was VERY skeptical but thought ""it just HAS to be better""!  It wasn't Greeted immediately and seated-that was the END of the service.  We waited and waited and waited for a waitress...who finally arrived. We noted there were NO prices on the menu for drinks...I asked for the price of a soft drink and she said, with a blank look on her face ""2 dollars and change, I think"" It went downhill from there. We ordered and when it finally arrived--one entree' was complete incorrect...then we waited some more...entree' delivered and it was lack luster and blah! The manager stopped at the table -as our waitress decided she was now on a mission to avoid our table and never returned.....he was a dopey little moron (in a word!) I have learned my lesson--NO MORE APPLEBEE's - EVER!"
George G.,"Mira Loma, CA",3,7,1,4.0,11/19/2014,"Great place to go for Sunday Football. Local games are always front and center with volume on! Love that!  I usually do the Sunday bar scene here and the bartenders are great, the beer is cold, and the local games take priority! All wins."
Maria A.,"Corona, CA",6,3,,4.0,7/11/2014,"Close to home,  good price,  They have Wi-Fi! (For the kids, that is) the drinks are superb!"
Jerry G.,"Mira Loma, CA",6,38,34,4.0,11/12/2012,"Thanks to Applebees for honoring our veterans with a free meal, I had a great shrimp and fries dinner!!"
Heather S.,"Corona, CA",85,1,,1.0,9/21/2015,The only reason why you got one star is because there isn't an option to give you no stars this is my second bad experience at Applebees the first time the waitress cussed in front of my kids and gave us attitude this time was my birthday don't know why I chose this place but the food was great as always but the service was horrible my husband salad was brought to him on a dirty plate with old stuck on food on it and it took us two waitresses every time we wanted a drink to be refilled our food took forever our waitress was nice but barely there it took us two hours from the time we got there to get our food eat and leave are you still love Applebees but if I get bad service two times in a row most likely I won't be back
Stephanie O.,"Riverside, CA",2,7,2,3.0,9/4/2014,"Good food. Waiter has no people skills & rushes through everything... Otherwise, the place works"
Nate S.,"Corona, CA",83,6,,5.0,9/18/2015,"Intro service was dope,waitress was very informative and friendly, Manger was very courteous and recognizes previous customers.  And the food omgosh  was amazing . Got the burger with an egg on it which was so good and ordered a side of mac and cheese ,but ordered the appetizer pretzel and like beer cheese. Hear me out dip the mac and cheese in the beer cheese,I'm lost for words when I tried it :). Overall love the experience and the food would recommend for family time"
Tamara E.,"Riverside, CA",0,66,4,2.0,5/6/2014,"Went there today for lunch with my 1.5 year old and mom. I can't say the experience was bad, but it was definitely strange. The hostess sat us quickly and at first our waitress was friendly enough. I always order for my daughter upon seating and she put in the order and brought out her juice very quickly which I appreciated. So definitely a good start. The weirdness started after. My mom went to order the wonton taco's but then realized she could get them in a trio special and sample a couple other items. I heard her tell the server instead of the tacos I want the trio with wanton taco, pretzels, and a steak quesadilla. Easy enough right? Wrong. They bring out a plate of wonton tacos and the trio. That's a lot of freakin wonton tacos for one person. When the server came by she told her about the extra order and the server said I thought you ordered both. My mom is way nicer then me and told her she didn't but it was fine. The server replied okay good and walked away. Umm.....we were both dumbfounded. Then not even five minutes later she brings our check and places it standing up between my mom and I who were talking. We weren't half way done with our food. She claimed it was for convenience. Once again ummm... Then she went to check on the table next to us turned around and asked if the check was ready to go. No, I've taken like three bites. I laid down the book so I can talk since you obstructed my view of who I was speaking too. So odd, and so rushed. It's not like we take our sweet time, my daughter was well behaved and it wasn't busy. We seriously had just gotten our food an for as much as it is id like to have enjoyed it. We were also charged for the wontons that weren't ordered. I wanted to speak to the manager but like I said before my mom is super nice and doesn't like making a fuss.  Overall the food was tasty. No complaints there and the service started strong and midway through got bad and rushed. So so so strange. I am very disappointed to say the least."
Miguel G.,"Hesperia, CA",1,7,,3.0,6/12/2014,"This is my opinion about the bar area. I was greeted well, the bar area was semi busy its a thurs evening n the spurs are playing the heat in tge nba finals .  The food was great I have no complaint I did the 2 for 20 deal n was satisfied . Now the service couldve been alot better n this is why I gave it 3 stars , it took 10 mins jus to get our beer order even tho the bar area wasnt packed n another 10 just to take our order, mind you there was two bartenders .  Id come back but only if your ready for half ass service , good food tho"
Matt A.,"Riverside, CA",95,33,11,4.0,12/7/2011,"Pros: Service, Atmosphere, Happy Hour Cons: Average Food Been to many Applebee's their locations can be hit or miss. I know the one in Corona is horrible, however this one closer to home is actually enjoyable. Their food compared to most major chains is below average. Its comparable to Dennys. But Applebee's like Dennys are always busy, so people must keep coming back. So to me the assumption is, you should know that going in and not be surprised right? Knowing the food is going to be average at best, I haven't tried something there I didn't enjoy. Their appetizers are equivalent to bar food, but my wife and I really enjoy the chips and salsa. You get a lot for like $2 and they're actually pretty good. What separates this place from most Applebee's is the service. From the people who greet you when you come in, to your servers in the bar area, we always show up and leave happy there. Also I love how the place is decorated in local memorabilia including historic photos of our towns history. As someone who was born and raised here it definitely scores points in my book."
Alycia W.,"Eastvale, CA",39,37,,4.0,4/8/2014,"The last time I went to Applebee's was back in 2013 and it sucked. The food was meh. I don't know if they've made a deal with the Devil but we went in again and the food was fantastic! I had the cedar plank salmon, and my husband some pasta dish and he loved his too! We looked around to make sure we were indeed in Applebee's and not somewhere else because most of the food places in Eastvale suck. Bottom line, give them another try if you thought they sucked before."
Scotty W.,"Eagle Mountain, UT",186,409,107,5.0,2/17/2012,Had a great time. Food was good I didn't need A-one on my steak so ya it's good. Service was good even though it was crazy there. Nice job guys!!
Xiying L.,"Corona, CA",0,1,,5.0,8/5/2015,The content of dish is so large that I cannot eat   is satisfied that the server asked if you need box to package the food.  food is delicious .
Angela P.,"SYLMAR, CA",63,17,7,4.0,3/29/2014,"Me and Mom went there for my birthday.  We were seated right away.  The server was knowledgeable about the menu, courteous and promptly brought out our food.  I ordered the shrimp and steak sirloin cooked medium and to perfection.  When I didn't like the drink she suggested another the frozen strawberry lemonade which was fantastic!  For drinks, an appetizer and two entrées, I spent less than $60 bucks, a great price for the experience.  We'll definitely go back there in the near future!"
Jose P.,"Corona, CA",3,5,2,5.0,4/15/2014,My wife and I ate here food was great!! You should try the citrus lime stake delicious! The manager Ebony was awesome. Our waitress Ginger was very polite. We enjoy our self every time we go there!! :-)
