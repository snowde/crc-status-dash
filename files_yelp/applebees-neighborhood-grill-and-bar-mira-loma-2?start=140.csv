Adrian R.,"Mira Loma, CA",3,24,5,3.0,6/15/2012,"I've been going to Applebee's for many years, mainly because my wife and daughter like it.  I  don't really care for their food but the bar is cool, roomy and screens all over, so you can get a good view from almost anywhere you sit. This place is usually very packed so that's another reason why we normally sit in the bar area.  It's quicker. I had the cajun shrimp pasta and it was surprisingly good.  The sauce had a good flavor and they give you a good amount of shrimp, which were also very good.  Overall, I really enjoyed it.   The service sometimes is not that great here, but if you sit in the bar area, hopefully you'll get ""Michael"".  He's really attentive, helpful, and doesn't treat you like a number.  We usually come here once or twice a month, and whenever we get lucky and he's our waiter, he always gives us great customer service."
Sandy M.,"Ontario, CA",9,9,2,5.0,2/20/2014,By far this Applebee's has the best customer service! I have never been seated and greeted so nicely! There manager Robert is a very attentive and very nice person he definitely takes care of his customers! Definitely will make this Applebee's my number one choice!
Patrick V.,"Tustin, CA",6,12,2,1.0,1/30/2011,"This Applebee's has the worst service in the 951 area code. We were seated by a very nice, polite hostess ... then were proceeded to be ignored by the wait staff for 5 minutes. We had to *ask* for menus! Yet, the server, who was Latina, immediately served the group of Latinos who came in several minutes after us. We found this very conspicuous considering we are made up of Vietnamese, Chinese, and Indian people.  After finally getting menus, the server still didn't swing by to take our order! We waited another 5 minutes before the hostess happened to walk by and noticed we hadn't been helped. She apologized profusely and said she would get someone to help us. It took almost 15 minutes before someone took our order! Needless to say this was the start of a horrible dining experience. The food took forever to come out, we never received items like napkins we asked for, and the server never checked in on us after we received the food.  This doesn't even take into account the only-average-tasting food for fairly above-average prices. We will never return to this location again, and maybe never to another Applebee's. If I could have given this place a ZERO out of 5 stars, I would have."

Elle A.,"Corona, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/15/2014,"For the people who visit applebees on limonite, I LOVE applebees and have been living in Eastvale since 2005...unfortunately my last experience at applebees ruined everything for me...there's a psychotic woman working there and I don't know if she's just doing it to me or does it to multiple people so be careful! This woman has stalked me for 4 years, threatened to physically hurt me and my 1 year old son..she's so psycho that she chose to work at THIS applebees by my house when she lives close to moreno valley. Please be alert this woman is sick in her head. Threatened me to murder my unborn child and myself before. I went into a panic attack when I saw her serve my food at applebees when she wasn't even my waitress but of course went out of her way to get close to my table, gladly my son wasn't with me and as soon as I saw her left without touching anything. Now I don't feel safe in my city that I've loved to this point. Be very careful especially if you're expecting a baby!!!!"
Bobby M.,"Chino, CA",3,12,626,1.0,5/9/2011,"This place is not good at all for Asians. Went there with my family, waitress had that ""not happy to see you"" in her face. Service was bad, food not the way I expected to be considering the taste and the portions. I added $2 for the steak to have a bigger size but seemed like I still got the regular or even smaller. It seemed like they based the order on the size of the person ordering it. Then the main man greeting the customers, asking how they liked the food, didn't even approached us. Also noticed did the same thing on the other asian customer seated near us. Then as we left our table, my wife asked for the special $10 mother's day certificate and was told that it was given only in the morning. That was really bad! Won't go here, EVER!!!"
susan m.,"Crestline, CA",1,38,2,3.0,4/5/2014,"Steak was good.  Service was good  Manager very nice. No green onions or chives in the restaurant which is a staple for all restaurants. Not good. Steak was good. Baked potato microwaved,  not baked and not done. Had to send it back. Probably won't return."
Karen V.,"Corona, CA",20,51,22,5.0,5/18/2013,"Servers are always friendly and quick, food is always good and consistent"
Abigail M.,"Corona, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/9/2014,"Ok.. my husband and I stop by to watch the game and have a few drinks.  The place is a little busy but mostly short staffed. We see our server one time in 45 minutes, so we ask for the manager. After explaining the situation he basically blows us off!!! After a month we head back with the whole fam blam. This time we are seated and sit for 15 minutes with out anyone offering water or an acknowledgement. So done with them. We own and operate our own business and understand staffing but this is pathetic."
Barton M.,"Eastvale, CA",38,38,25,4.0,11/6/2013,"Applebee's is what it is. Very American fare, not upscale. Just good comfort food. They do this well. Their menu is varied and the staff well informed and trained. Management was on the floor and made sure that our experience was satisfactory. Good place to eat. Like I said nothing special. However, good food, great service and great ticket time for service."
Peanut B.,"Riverside, CA",10,51,85,5.0,3/11/2013,"They've earned my 5 star rate. I went yesterday and I was 100% satisfied with the food and service by my waitress Rae. What I loved the most was my food was nice and fresh and out of the oven, my waitress was on top of things with the refills and anything  else I asked for. Thanks for the delicious food I will definitaly come back soon! Most of all I was stoked my lakers won!"
Amber Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,12,6,2.0,7/20/2012,"The customer service here was so bad.  Let me start off by saying that this was my first time ever coming to an applebee's and probably my last time.  When my boyfriend and I came in, the lady sat us in the bar area...I was kind of turned off by this atmosphere because I was just expecting to eat at a nice restaurant without any neon lights and tv's all over the place. It was just loud and not what i was expecting.  So, the waitress comes over and asks for our drinks and while she's doing that, she's blatantly flirting with my boyfriend. I don't know bout ya'll, but that kind of ticked me off. Anyway, I got over it and was just trying to enjoy myself.  It was kind of hard hearing my boyfriend in the bar area because there were tv's with their volumes up and older people kicking back after a day at work. My boyfriend asked another waiter if we could switch to the other side and the waiter was like ""why..."" and my boyfriend replied ""well it's just too loud over here and the other side looks a lot more quieter"" and he replies, ""well, its not that much quieter over there, it just seems quieter because it's a bigger space."" ....what? Like, what kind of logic is that? After a couple times going back and forth he finally said ""alright, then"" and seated us to another table. It honestly felt like we were such a huuuugeeee burden to him when we just asked to move tables. I work in the retail business and deal with customers all the time and if they're unhappy about something, I do anything in my power to make sure they walk out satisfied with what they purchased. I just dont understand why he was so irritated when we asked him to move. Isn't that his job... to make the customers have an enjoyable experience. The other side of the restaurant was not even half full. I'm the type of person that doesn't really complain while I'm there, so to get that kind of reaction kind of ticked me off.  The food was mediocre but when I got home, my dad told me that applebees just unfreezes a bunch of food in the microwave and deep fryer. So, I'd say if you wanted that kind of food, just go to a fast food restaurant and not waste your money and time going here. there are a lot better places to eat and that deserve your money in the area, trust me."
Gina W.,"Ontario, CA",74,14,,5.0,11/14/2013,"My husband and I love this Applebee's, it has been our ""go to"" since we moved to this area 3yrs ago. We've gotten to know most of the staff and managers. It is a training location so there are always some new faces. The atmosphere is so welcoming, family friendly and comfortable. Anywhere you go you are bound to have an uneasy experience but the good surely out weighs the bad. The service is great and food is wonderful!! Highly recommended!!"
Cindy G.,"Ontario, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/6/2016,"I cannot stand going to Applebees first and foremost. I think the service and quality have decreased over the years. I went today per a request of someone I was with. The waiter instead of placing the drink on the table hands it ti my 8 yr old granddaughter to grab, asked fir ranch for her chicken tenders and by the time it was brought she had ate all 3 chicken tenders, not to mention my granddaughter ordered a sprite not a pepsi. A manager came by luckily and I had explained to her, the waiter came back said he was sorry they removed her kids meal 4.99 there was a miscommunication (which made me upset)? Then just so happened I dropped the receipt on the floor and there was a needle on the floor. I spoke to the manager again and had told her. The GM came to my table I had explained to him what had happened as he was not aware of the service just the needle on the floor, he took care of the bill. I was appreciative of that but was still not happy with the initial service and how the waiter stated a miscommunication when how can you miscommunicate, needing Ranch and asking for Sprite and not Pepsi and not bringing Ranch fir over 5 mins. No more Applebees for my family."
Dave R.,"Orange, CA",0,53,,4.0,1/4/2014,"I read that some customers feel like the service was bad, but the one and only time I visited the service was fast and friendly. From the host to the busboy. I really appreciate the quality service."
Khelyn C.,"Corona, CA",3,101,35,3.0,10/14/2012,"Eh, okay food, okay servers. Their spinach dip is pretty good though but it wasn't the best. This place is kinda boring. I wish their servers were more lively."
Kirstyn H.,"Moreno Valley, CA",44,4,1,1.0,4/24/2013,"Terrible food...how you screw up a club sandwich is beyond me, but they figured it out. No meat, butter drenched bread, and bbq sauce. Gross. The Burger Was Greasy And Cooked Wrong."
Rick H.,"Montebello, CA",0,20,2,1.0,3/23/2014,"Service is terrible. It took them 15 minutes to bring me steak sauce. Never came back for refills. We were stuck slurping melted ice water for almost a half hour. And a personal pet peeve of mine is when the waitress sits down next to you take an order. Sorry Lyndsey, but that is rude IMO. Never going back. Also, the food sucks."
Richard M.,"Montclair, CA",0,2,,3.0,7/7/2013,Usually ok but went there on july 4th for lunch and it took over 30 minutes to get 2 sandwiches. It was not crowded.  No explanation or apology.
Aaron L.,"Fullerton, CA",164,171,19,2.0,3/13/2012,"The food here is terrible. Like really really gross, except for the appetizers. But the staff are all super friendly, which keeps this from being a 1 star review. Given that the center it's in is one of the few plazas in the area with food, alcohol and entertainment, it's pretty packed on Friday nights. Lot's of HS kids around too thanks to the Edwards Theater around the corner. I'd get there early, or really late, or you're gonna be waiting in line for a while. The inside is like any applebee's, mid level restaurant chainish. Thankfully they have a separated bar area so you don't need to be bothered by screaming children while you're trying to get your drink on."
