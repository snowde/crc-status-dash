James L.,"Fontana, CA",143,30,,4.0,5/4/2013,the 2 for $24 is a great value. I go here pretty often. Rae is a sweetheart :)
Annie D.,"San Diego, CA",179,491,639,3.0,12/5/2011,"There really aren't many dining choices in the area, but if you're looking for mediocre food at a good price this place is it.  We ordered the 2 for $20 which is a pretty good deal with the Spinach Artichoke Dip, Oriental Chicken Salad and the Chicken Carbonara Fettuccine, and our friend ordered the Garlic Sirloin medium well.  Besides the fact that it was almost too dark to read the menu in there, they had a nice fun casual atmosphere and service was good.  As for the food, the Spinach Artichoke Dip lacked texture, but the chips were excellent. Thin and Crispy.  The Oriental Chicken Salad was Salad with Chicken Strips cut up on top,  but the dressing was good. Like a Honey Mustard. The Chicken Carbonara Fettuccine was good.  I really enjoyed the dish. And my friend's Garlic Sirloin was well portioned and it came with lots of potatoes and veggies. Only thing was although it was low fat, it was not low sodium.  The sirloin was very salty.  This place gets a 2.5."
TN L.,"Corona, CA",0,21,13,1.0,2/22/2014,"Our waiter had a very negative nonchalant attitude. We waited an extremely long time for my daughters milkshake so was already annoyed. Then our food took extremely long to arrive, without apology or empathy. The waiter later brought cheesesticks to say ""for the troubles"" however as confused as he seemed I think they were intended for another table. Finally our food arrived and my steak was more than well done when I asked for medium well. I spoke to your manager onsite (white, older, salt and pepper hair) and he seemed less than concerned. He told me he'd stop by my table which he did to only offer to recook my steak after I had already told him we waited too long. I reiterated that we've waited too long by that point and declined his offer and asked for the check. He came back and said hed comped us $10 when my meal was $17.99 unbelievable!!!! I've never had such terrible service but to have two employees not have much concern for their lack of performance was beyond disappointing. We definitely won't be back to this location and most likely not to any of other locations."
Ryan C.,"Oakland, CA",183,596,3,3.0,10/12/2009,"I guess if you find yourself at Applebees, you probably weren't looking for great food in the first place. This is my first time visiting the place in over 10 years, so I can't compare it to other ones.  Everything is so All-American in this place. They play really popular songs. The ""Chinese chicken salad"" uses breaded fried chicken. The broccoli is soaking in butter. Everything is big and salty.  I'm really glad they give nutritional info (look in the dessert menu), but dang, sodium overload!! Service was decent. They remembered our orders but I had to ask for a water refill. At a place like this, you should really drink more water."
Jeff C.,"Corona, CA",4,9,1,4.0,2/1/2012,I tried the new sizzling chili lime chicken and it actually was pretty good. I would definitely order it again. Service was kind of slow though
Trina S.,"Eastvale, CA",44,33,65,4.0,11/1/2013,"this is our regular ""spot"" because its local (eastvale), they offer happy hour specials on food and drinks, and they also have a pretty decent menu and selection. the bar area is the best place to sit cause the service is quicker and they have tv's."
Tony G.,"Murrieta, CA",5,64,,1.0,2/28/2013,"Inedible, horrible swill...this place has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. We ordered the chicken fried chicken and the Bourbon street steak. The chicken had obviously been left in the microwave too long, and the steak had some sort of chemical tasting sauce that tasted like it was made from a concoction of ingredients found under a kitchen sink. When the waitress asked us how the food was we told her it was bad, we did not want to go into detail on how awful this mess that they called food was. The waitress went to the manager who in turn came to our table, and literally got down on his knees and asked us "" what you had that you not like""...Uhhh, first of all, stand up when you are talking to me, second, the food we not like, and third, we also didn't like the little act from the second waitress who delivered the so called bourbon street steak...yes, they did not bring both meals to the table at the same time....the waitress who brought the steak had to go through a painful routine of smelling the food, waving her hand over the food like she was fanning the elegant aroma into her nostrils , and asking me if I "" really want the steak, it smells so good""....Really?, it smelled like ass you twit, now stop molesting peoples meals when you bring them to the table. The manager decided to take the food off the bill (good thing because I was not going to pay for this garbage anyway), and told us that next time, he would personally ""walk us through the menu"" , Ok, first off, there will be no next time Franky, second, why on earth would I need you to ""walk"" me through your menu?...I am sure I can read far better than you, lord knows I speak better English. The only good thing about this experience was leaving ...farewell applebees, never again."
Nick T.,"Riverside, CA",247,28,98,5.0,4/17/2011,Awesome food friendly staff! The 2 for 20 is the best deal out there the steaks here are made to perfection. You cant ask for more!
Bren a.,"Riverside, CA",0,27,,1.0,3/8/2010,"We tried the car service (take out). Ordering went smoothly and the food was ready when we arrived. The server was cheerful and helpful. That was the last good thing I can say about our experience. We ordered two entrees. The steak was full of gristle and cooked way beyond ""medium rare,"" all the way to ""well."" His vegetables were disappointing. The garlic was nonexistent in the garlic potatoes. My ribs were OK. BUT, the rest of my meal was missing. So, all I got for dinner was ribs.  The dessert was even worse. It was supposed to be their ""lava cake"" with ice cream and hot fudge sauce. Well, the ice cream contained numerous large ice crystals. The cake itself was cold (had never been heated to make the center flow as the menu had stated). And, the hot fudge topping was (you guessed it) missing. Never, ever will we eat at Applebee's again, even if the meal were free."
Ivan L.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,199,27,3.0,11/12/2010,"Showed up for a lunch meeting with a colleague. The staff was super friendly and I enjoyed my dining experience there. They refilled my glass of water 5 times and I didn't have to wait very long.Their new 2 for $20 was pretty darn good. Great value and tasty food. We had the spinach & artichoke dip which was really good, fresh and hot from the oven. It was served with some salsa and some freshly fried tortilla chips. I ordered the Ravioli w/Chicken and my friend ordered the stuffed meatballs with Fettuccine. I can only speak for the Raviolis, it was really good. I am not too big of a fan of cheese sauce but it was really good. I only wish it didn't have so much sodium... My frustration is the fly infestation.... It was pretty gross. I was informed that the fly issue is a problem in the city more so than the restaurant itself. There were likely 20+ flies flying around the window (on the inside) where we were sitting..."
Chunk C.,"Los Angeles, CA",114,107,58,4.0,4/16/2012,"i hadnt been to this applebees in a while.  i regret going on a sunday night because of all the kids that were running all over the place and being loud.  i get that its a family restruant but its no excuse to allow kids to run up and down the aisles or for them to be so loud.  i really wish management would control that more, then i would probably go back more often.  other then that my service was pretty good, although she always forgot to bring wtvr i asked for such as refills or boxes to go (i dont remember her name). i give it a 4 star because of the loud annoying kids."
Nellie L.,"Norco, CA",3,7,,1.0,1/2/2013,"I love applebees, but this one is horrendous. We walked in and the hostess did not have a friendly attitude, like I was inconveniencing her by coming in. Then our waitress took forever to take our drink order. Our food was okay at best. The queso was bland, the lettuce on my salad tasted funky and the french onion soup my friend ordered was super thick which for a brothy soup is awful. I will not be returning to this applebees ever again."
Diane L.,"Corona, CA",0,12,,2.0,8/6/2009,"I felt so ripped off after going here for lunch.  The portions were so small, I had to go to the Farmer Boys in the same center to buy a burger after I ate here.  That's even after I ordered the skillet apple pie dish for dessert.  I'm not a big woman with a big appetite, but honestly the portions were so disappointing. Service wasn't that great either.  It's so hard to find a good restaurant in Eastvale, but I will keep on trying."
L. W.,"Corona, CA",1,20,,1.0,8/7/2012,"I agree with a earlier reviewer...Three Strikes Your OUT! Have had many terrible experiences at this location with mainly the service, but with this last & final visit it was service and food! It won't take long once your seated to see that it does not take brains or customer service skills to get hired as a waitress at this location! They all act unprofessional and can't even get orders correct. Gave this location one last try since it was close to our house, it was late & we wanted to get dinner before a movie.....well, needless to say, never made the movie because our waitress was ""missing"" for the majority of our time there and when she did come around, she was serving the wrong food & taking it back, while more wrong food coming out! she knew we were not happy with her, but did not once offer a discount on our bill, a dessert, a manager...nothing.....so Bye-Bye Applebees & your horrible food & service!  Also, is it just me or is the portion sizes shrinking more & more by the especially on that 2 for $20.!!!"
Mike L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",83,1291,17,4.0,1/11/2009,ordered a Fire something burger. It was pretty good. The meat was cooked great and it wasnt your regular hamburger meat. The waitress was really good also. I usally dont like the chain places but i would order this burger again
John L.,"Brea, CA",47,86,,1.0,8/10/2008,"This Applebee's makes me face palm. I'm not the biggest fan of mega chain restaurants, but I don't think they're as bad as people whine them to be. They're usually satisfying so-so meals that'll get the job done and have something for everyone at a reasonable price. But this Applebee's seems to try hard at sucking. I went to this particular location a few times. There aren't too many sit down restaurants closeby in the area, so people are pigeonholed with few choices. But at the same time, I suspect it gives some business proprietors a reason to suck, since they know people don't have a choice to go somehwere else. I think this Applebee's uses the same tactic. Their foods are overcooked, improperly seasoned, put together with haphazard presentation, and generously served on consistent platters of fail. This place can't even follow the tried and true mass production methods their parent company devised for them.  Case in point? Chicken breast dishes (several of em) that are all dry and shriveled. Steaks that haven't been trimmed for gratuitous gristle and are cooked above or below what you ordered. Appetizers that are half-assed and look like they were cooked with the help of an EZ-Bake Oven. Avoid this place at all costs unless you're going there to enjoy a beer or drink at the bar casually. I'm sick of these Norco restaurants thinking they can get away with serving second rate food to people they suspect won't bother to go elsewhere (and with gas prices the way they are and the alluring comfort of a place closest to home, I can understand)."
