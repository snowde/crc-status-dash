Lesley B.,"Carson, CA",150,28,1,1.0,4/2/2016,"This was a complaint from my friend. ""So we used a gift card at Applebee's that my mom got as a reward from the bank. When we used it, the server took it, came back and said there's no funds. My mom was like no can't be its from the bank. So we ended up paying and my mom called the bank about it. It was cashed out where we were at.""  A cashed out gift card is never returned to the customer. So you definitely know there's something sketchy about this chain. I'm so disappointed to hear my friend had such a bad experience here and to top it off, get hoaxed on their gift card. I will write to corporate about this. Not a good practice for a business with how they train their servers and customer service. Won't recommend to come here."
Michelle M.,"Upland, CA",15,55,55,3.0,5/2/2015,"Let's start with the good. I really like the look and feel of the restaurant. Very fresh look, like the lights, colors and decor. The hostess where nice and personable, as was our waitress, Amy.  The not so good... The vents are very dirty and the ceiling is reflective of that (see photos). Most of the knives are unsafe to us and when I informed another server, she could have cared less and did not replace the ones I requested. Additionally, we were a large party and the appetizer plates remained on our table the entire time, taking up a lot of space w could have used.  Just needs attention to detail."
LaDonna N.,"Norco, CA",69,3,,1.0,2/29/2016,"Service has increasingly become worse. Every time we think about giving them another shot, they prove us wrong. Every. Time.  It's not even big mess-ups, they just can't get their sh*t together. I am not a picky or hard to please customer. It takes 2 things to make me satisfied: food arriving on time (not 30 minutes to receive Diet Coke and a appetizer salad in the bar) and courteous service. Applebee's can NEVER get it right. Food is mediocre at best. Not enough to bring me back. I'm done with this location."
Selena D.,"Chino, CA",3,57,35,1.0,3/21/2016,"I came in around 11:45 12 took about 5 mins to get our drinks put in. Then another ten to get menu's. I was very excited to order a chicken tender basket but I will never do so again. My order took around 20-30 minutes to come out and when it did the fries were old, cold, and soggy. My chicken tenders were also cold and seemed like had been sitting on the counter all day. I sent my food back and asked for a whole new chicken basket. About 15-20 mins later my food came back, nice and hot BUT it the was fries from the first one as well as the same tenders except now they were burnt. I couldn't even finish my food and I will never order here again. Its very unfortunate as our server told us that after a certain time the cooks clock Out and wont listen to anyone but only yell at them. I will continue to come back but ONLY if/when Nancy is working the bar."
Alex V.,"Corona, CA",0,4,,4.0,1/4/2017,"Food= 2 stars, Service= 5+stars!!!  I'm not going to say anything about the food, however, I feel obligated to mention the fact that our server, Vanessa, was great!!!   Her great smile+her great service =wanna make us come back and try a different dish!  Thank you for your help and attention Vanessa."
Sy M.,"Southern California, CA",35,74,659,4.0,6/12/2015,"The service is always okay in the bar area. However, the managers are really nice. They always check on you to make sure everything is going good.  Today the appetizers we got were the Grilled Chicken Wonton Tacos (Delicious!!!) and some Mozzarella Sticks (not bad).   For my husband's main course he got the Triple Hog Dare Ya and he loved it!! He said he'd definitely order it again.  I got the Oriental Chicken Salad with Crispy Chicken and it was so good!!"
Lilibeth G.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,3,,1.0,8/18/2016,"Waitress was initially super friendly. She did come by a few too many times while we waited for the other half of our party to see if we were ready to order. Once she took our order and brought us our drinks everything went downhill from there.  The food took forever. She brought out appetizers without bringing any utensils or plates but we were starving and just used our fingers anyway and didn't mind too much. Then it took a really long time for the entrees to come out. Steaks were burned which I get its not a nice steak house or anything but don't bother asking how I want my steak done if they are all going to come out medium.  Water was never refilled once during the whole meal. Asked for a drink refill and waitress acknowledged it twice but didn't bring it over until the end of the meal. Ordered 2 sides of sweet potato fries to go along with the steaks we ordered. Sweet potato fries arrived well after we were done with the meal. One of which arrived cold and unappetizing to which I wondered why the hell did we wait so long when the fries were just sitting back there?? After we informed the person that brought the fries (who was not the waitress) that we had two orders the manager personally came by and brought the fries and apologized for the ""few minute delay"" but never apologized for the terrible service. My brother asked for a frozen lemonade refill and the manager said they don't refill those to which my brother replied I thought you were the manager? He said he was. I couldn't help but laugh because the measly refill could've prevented the bad review. It was an opportunity to reverse a customer's poor experience at his restaurant. But nothing. To top it off the waitress finally came back and said here's your bill and check it thoroughly to make sure you know what you're paying for. I expected a comp on something, anything. One drink. But again, nothing. I should've left nothing on the tip but I've been in the service industry. I paid the 15% but left feeling quite angry, enough to wake me from my Yelp slumber. This was a major customer service fail for me."
Jessie A.,"San Diego, CA",50,117,70,2.0,1/23/2016,The only reason why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because the happy hour prices are a great deal and the food is average. The bartender gave awful service. She gave us our food and we sat there for probably 20 minutes trying to get her attention because we had no silverware or napkins. By the time we got the side of ranch and silverware our food was cold. She completely ignored our side of the bar. I work customer service and I understand if it's busy but it was super dead and she was organizing all the alcohol on the shelf instead of helping her customers. Next time I'll sit in the dining room.
Jesse S.,"Corona, CA",45,22,131,1.0,12/31/2015,Usually I can give you guys five stars but today I'm very disappointed I ordered my usual two for 20 and but today I was disappointed they messed up my order it was almost a 45 minute wait no utensils I'm very disappointed I would give zero stars if I could
Wayout S.,"Miami Beach, FL",1,8,4,5.0,10/6/2016,Called and ordered in the bar tender was taking orders not sure what her name was but I felt so unrushed and she was very kind just made me want to leave a good review on her
Melissa E.,"Corona, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/16/2016,"I put only one star because the appetizer and drink came out quickly, then we ordered our food and it my kids food finally came. Waited 10 mins and finally my food came. Once we started to eat my son noticed something brown things  in his Mac and cheese and of course he didn't want to eat it anymore. Next thing I ordered a cheeseburger well done and it was pink in the middle, so after I decided to order desert to go after waiting 10 mins they bring it out but not to go. After waiting another 10 mins we finally left horrible wait staff will not return this Applebee's again"
Karie F.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",260,600,450,2.0,9/28/2015,"Uggggh...HUGE disappointment! My friend and I were really looking forward to a good meal after working a long day at a festival in the Riverside heat. I ordered the Chicken Penne Alfredo pasta and he ordered the Brunch all day burger. My dish was so disappointing! Barley any chicken, and hardly any sauce whatsoever! Noodles were chewy and overcooked. The bread stick (On the menu as ""garlic bread"") was hard and stale! When I asked for more sauce, the waitress replied that it would cost an extra $1.50. WHAT?? Charge me for something that wasn't there in the first place??? When she saw my expression, she said ""let me ask my supervisor"" and came back with a side ""free of charge"" LOL..Thanks, I think? My friend's burger came with ""all you can eat fries"" and Thank God for that, he needed it after his burger came out with about 10 fries total on his plate. But getting them would be another task. Kind of like getting refills...scarce! Either the kitchen cooks didn't know what they were doing or they were instructed to SKIMP on portions....I believe the latter of the two because our drinks weren't refilled in a timely manner either. This visit sucked. Maybe it was just this location?"
Adrian Q.,"Jurupa Valley, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/26/2017,Use to always come here won't ever go back now . Manager accused us of leaving last time without paying on a 100 check .. really lol would come here at least twice a week why would I do something like that and go back?? Rude ass people here don't come
Jamie E.,"Corona, CA",0,19,4,4.0,3/28/2017,"Food was yummy, our server/bartender Larry was awesome!   Very friendly and cordial!  The brisket tacos were very good.  The chicken and shrimp was also good.  Service was fast and the food was still hot.  Good experience.  Thank you Larry."
G M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",11,185,450,2.0,6/2/2016,"Came in today for lunch , was about 1145 , the place was packed, looks like graduation parties , ok. So we sit at the bar , quickest service rite ?? Wrong , took about 10 min to order and our food took almost a hr to come out ,I get it , there slammed , it mite take awhile , BUT why was other people's food who came after us coming out sooner then ours!?!! Hmmmm .... So overall horrible waiting to eat ."
R M.,"San Diego, CA",1,60,,2.0,4/16/2016,"Mark B is terrible. He has a big attitude and was rude the entire time. Never smiled once, except for when he was talking with his coworkers. He would laugh and smile with them but never with his tables. At one point a food runner brought out our food and asked if we needed anything else and we told him that one of our plates never came out so he went over to tell our server and we witnessed him rolling his eyes. One of the worst experiences we have ever had at a restaurant. It was very uncomfortable when he would come to the table because of his attitude."
Gigi P.,"Corona, CA",41,27,13,3.0,8/3/2016,The food and customer service were great as always but the direction of the manager in training to sit every large party before seating parties of 2 and 3 with open booths was absolutely ridiculous. Literally having to wait for larger parties of 10 AND 15 was crazy!! I don't get the process.
Liz D.,"Riverside, CA",0,5,1,5.0,9/14/2016,"I came here with my boyfriend for our third attempt with Applebee's. The first two experiences were not satisfactory. We went to two other locations, downtown riverside and Corona near McKinley St. Both had very poor service and food. However, this Applebee's experience was much better. Our waiter was great, and the food was amazing. When you get here say, ""where's Waldo""?. (Our Waiter) Overall one of the best experiences we've had!"
Kelly D.,"Upland, CA",0,11,1,5.0,11/29/2016,"I'm always a little skeptical of chain restaurants, but was pleasantly surprised by this Applebees! I sat at the bar alone getting a couple beers and a few appetizers and I was served very quickly. Larry was just the right amount of attentive and even asked if I needed a holiday gift card. Next time I'm in the area I will keep this location in mind!"
