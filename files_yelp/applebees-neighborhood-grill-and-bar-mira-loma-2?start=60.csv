Edith R.,"Ontario, CA",35,49,47,2.0,9/3/2015,Ok... where do I start... I was dragged to this place after a while desided to give it a try again. Totally disapointed  service  sucks at any time of day or night. To make a story short we were not even worth a lame birthday complanetary cake... if you are not a Fat PTA house wife don't waste your time going.. I am not even going to use the  racial card!
Larry M.,"Corona, CA",4,10,,1.0,2/20/2016,The service and person at the front desk are idiots.. Took forever to get seated. Had to complain twice. Then waited over 40 mins to get our food and it wasn't even correct..!! This place sucks.!!!!
Kyle J.,"Riverside, CA",12,2,,5.0,2/19/2017,Great service! They accidentally put Onions on my burger after I asked for no onions (happens wherever I go it seems).The server was very kind. The manager came out to ask if I wanted a free soup or salad while I waited. The new burger came out in no time. Very courteous service and well managed.
Alicia W.,"Ontario, CA",44,2,7,1.0,10/14/2016,"We have been going to this Applebee's for years and have never really had a bad experience until today. My son turned 9 today and wanted to go there for his birthday (shake and bake!!) and we told the hostess that it was his birthday. She couldn't care less and acted as such. The server was inattentive, and after my husband and I ordered off the 2 for $25 menu - literally only came back to the table once. He obviously didn't think we were going to help his food and drink averages (as former servers he should have hung in there - we could have helped his tip$$$ average). So after having to stop various servers and management for plates, silverware, and eventually boxes, he came back asking if I wanted another drink (after letting me finish a lot of my meal with no ice tea) and dropped the check at the same. No offer of dessert, no acknowledgement of my son's birthday, no attention to service, no f$&@s given. Oh - and wait - for that, no great tip either."
Aaron A.,"Corona, CA",0,31,2,2.0,10/27/2015,One step above fast food but 5 steps above the price of fast food  My $15 entree was worth about $3  Mad me stand there waiting for a receipt because they decided to go digital on their checkout. My waitress never asked how the food was because I would have told her how gross it was.
Katie P.,"Corona, CA",23,10,1,1.0,3/24/2016,"I'm a server at a similar restaurant and I often analyse service I receive when I go out. Our server Trisha in the bar needs to reevaluate her customer service skills. Our food came out correctly, but her attitude was very unwelcoming. She didn't introduce herself and while ordering she made us feel rushed and she didn't smile. If we questioned any of her actions (like id-ing my 60 year old dad) she would give us a sneering attitude filled response. Will not be back to this location specifically because of her."
Octavio C.,"Fontana, CA",5,7,4,5.0,3/24/2016,"I recommend Trista as the best waitress at the bar section . We show up every Thursday as a family night with friends . As soon we show up she knows are drinks , and appetizers. She on top of her game to make the best experience ever for us . I all always look forward to be at Apple bees on Thursday . Great job Trista best waitress every awesome sauce . So if your in Eastvale go the apple bees and ask for trista ..."
Zoe G.,"Oxnard, CA",0,3,,4.0,7/1/2016,"Really good service, amazing triple bacon burger. Nice and friendly atmosphere. The kid's pizza I would not recommend, (my brother didnt like it and it was soggy) but other than that it was amazing!"
Phil O.,"Palm Springs, CA",77,102,99,4.0,3/12/2016,This Applebee's has a separate bar area for adults to enjoy their grow folk activities. I enjoyed the bar service and appitizers.
Amy G.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/19/2016,If I could give the service I had no stars I would. I went to Applebee's on the 17th of this month around 4pm and the server I had named mark was absolutely horrible and inattentive. He had so much attitude and the host helped me out more than him. This isn't the first time I've gone and have had him. He is the worst server I've had at any restaurant by far. I am very disappointed.
Alex C.,"Riverside, CA",1,24,19,5.0,9/3/2015,Everything is yummy love this place perfect for date nights .rcommend to go 9pm-1am happy hour
Stephanie L.,"Anaheim, CA",297,12,12,4.0,12/10/2015,"Came in for happy hour with some friends. And let me say they have wonderful service here. The happy hour special is reasonable and great! Got some Long Island, and an appetizer...oh and appetizer are half off.! Had a small problem but the managers came around and fixed everything and made everything right.! That right there is great service!! Will def return to visit Trista she was amazing! =]"
Jasmine G.,"Rowland Heights, CA",0,4,1,1.0,5/15/2017,"Our appetizer came out fast, food took a little longer but nothing bad. My husband ordered a MEDIUM steak which they brought out and came out WELL done. Btw this is the second time since we've been there they've done that to him. Alerted our waitress we wanted Medium she took it back and left his sides. So my daughter finishes her food. I finish my food and then 5 extra minutes go by and final here comes his steak in the managers hands who just apologized. It was just the way he wanted it. So not  much to complain about right. So our 2 for $27 came with free brownie bites. So we ordered that to go because my daughter wanted to leave... btw shes 1 so yea she cant sit still for too long. We pay on the little machine. And 10 minutes went by... so i took my daughter outside to walk while my husband waited. We were outside for A good 5-7 minutes and still nothing. We went back inside and i just said ok lets just go it's ridiculous to wait for a brownie for over 15 minutes. I told the waitress were leaving. But she look confused and ran to the back and came out with our brownies and tiny sides of icecream. She apologized of course. But once i looked inside the bag seriously took over 15 minutes for a literal brownie bite and its also stone cold like all they had to do was bring it out of the fridge. I seriously used to like applebees but not anymore. Were never going there again. Totally ruined it for us. And the waitress didnt even say let me get the manager for you to see what he can do or anything special like that."
Lisa A.,"Moreno Valley, CA",10,94,44,5.0,1/2/2016,Sitting in the bar area me and my collegues received very quick service from begining till we left. The waitress was very friendly and the food was delicious.
Mary F.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,26,14,3.0,9/21/2016,Went here a few times cuz I  like the food but the service really sucks. They sat us at a small table near the waiter's station and we kept waiting for one of the dimwits to bring us a menu and take our drink order.  No one even acknowledged we were there. We waited 10-15-20 minutes and nothing!  I went and talked with the manager and told her to train the dimwits how to take care of the customers. There was NO excuse -it wasn't busy.  A few booths  were filled and the bar had about five patrons. So if you have plenty of time to spend waiting and don't mind being ignored then this is the place for you
Valerie Z.,"Corona, CA",71,22,4,2.0,2/15/2014,"Very disappointed with the portion of Savory Cedar Salmon I received tonight via Carside-To-Go. See picture I posted.  This portion was similar to that of what I would get in a diet frozen dinner... You know the kind where you feel you should eat 2 because only 1 leaves you still hungry. The flavors weren't bad.... But here I sit, still not satisfied. Definitely not worth the price. I mean it's Applebee's! C'mon!"
E. L.,"Fontana, CA",3,37,28,1.0,10/28/2014,"I had left one star review for this Applebees before and thought i would have a better experience tonight and reward them with an extra star....... However who runs out of Bud-light (#1 selling Anheuser  Bushon Beer in America) on aTuesday night when there is a World Series ( sponsored by Anheuser Bush) Game 6 going on and a Laker Game. Being the beer enthusiast I am i was obligated to purchase my second favorite Shock Top for a dollar more. When my table is drinking 10 more beers for a dollar more x the rest of the Budlight crowd do the math  why should we pay for this restaurants poor order writtimg on its kegs. Live up to your business model ""Applebee's restaurant Grill & Bar"""
L J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,222,20,5.0,2/4/2016,"I came here a couple of weeks ago and I just wanted to say the customer service we received was honestly the best I've had in a while. I believe our server's name was Ginger (I think that's it!) and she was super friendly, sweet and attentive. The food was good and came out pretty quickly even when it was busy. I'd go back to this location based on customer service alone."
Latte B.,"Ontario, CA",31,83,6,3.0,2/19/2016,"Portions are smaller for more money, not quite cooked to order, and not pressure tasting.  Unlikely to be back."
JD O.,"Jurupa Valley, CA",1,185,76,5.0,11/3/2014,"Went there yesterday to have lunch with my wife. We have never been there before, so this was a first for us. I ordered the steak and shrimp meal with baked potato and steamed veggies, wifey went with the shrimp linguine dish. Our server Gerardo was on top of his game yesterday....superb customer service...and a great guy...really attentive and patient, seeing as how we had never been there before...good job Gerardo. Drinks were filled when empty, customer service was great...we might just make this a weekly thing.... Just one thing before I go. Those little computer tablet things need update games or something....kinda boring...even though it was .99 cents....That is all!! lol!!"
