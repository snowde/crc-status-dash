B U.,"Riverside, CA",20,43,16,2.0,10/15/2015,"Very slow service, food was cold ribs taste like processed meat our waiter never even checked up on us after she dropped off our food. I wanted some extra barbecue sauce there was no one to ask for it. I won't come back here again. Go elsewhere"
Sophia L.,"Chino, CA",223,259,124,3.0,8/29/2014,"Applebee's is very kid friendly, so we like to bring our kids here. This is the first time we've been to this particular one and the service was SO slow. It was the middle of the week and the restaurant was no where near full, so I don't know what was going on. Our server was attentive and the manager even came over to ask if everything was ok. (He knew the food was taking FOREVER) The food is always good, not great and it's decently priced so that's why we continue to come here. The best part about this place is the full bar. Drank drank!!"
Maria R.,"Fontana, CA",188,95,41,1.0,10/8/2015,"I'm kinda disappointed.  My sons reaction after seeing and tasting the food.  He said ,'I guess Applebee's don't care if their food suck as long as the photos nice.'.  He was sad although he loved the churro s'mores.. Oh well it seems like every time I dine in there's always a problem, bland food, servers not taking care of you.  Honestly curve side was the best when my husband and I had curve side service food was amazing and the person was really helpful and nice."
Kelly L.,"Riverside, CA",0,24,,4.0,3/7/2016,I enjoy this place during happy hours. Great prices for decent amount of food and liqueur. Plus when happy hour starts there's less people so no to loud or crowded.
Vero G.,"Thornton, CO",0,55,1,2.0,1/20/2016,"Service was great unfortunately the food wasn't! I'm a huge fan of Applebee's but this one was a disappointment! I asked for medium well steak and it came out extremely well done and salty along with salty sweet potato fries and my veggies were soaked in butter they are suppose to be steamed veggies, they looked soggy and old. The other plate we ordered was the American burger it was missing the bacon and the fries with that order was ridiculously salty and my mom likes salty food."
Roxie B.,"Upland, CA",95,21,33,5.0,12/16/2014,Great food and location. Customer service as well. I haven't gone to Applebee's for years due to poor experience with food preparation and food taste in Arcadia ca
Holly K.,"Mira Loma, CA",20,6,6,5.0,1/17/2016,Our youth group did the Applebee's Flapjack Fundraiser yesterday and we loved it. It was a fantastic experience from start to finish. The manager Rafael and his staff were very friendly. The food was fantastic and everyone had a good time. Thank you Applebee's for helping us raise money for youth camp.
Claudia B.,"Jurupa Valley, CA",7,3,,1.0,7/28/2016,"Food sucks !!!!! Never go to this Applebee's in Eastvale, horrible service and food taste nasty ."
Jaime M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,79,51,3.0,8/15/2015,"What can i say..... Everyone has pretty much been to an applebees. Its not the greatest place but not the worst. They have a variety on the menu so theres quiet a bit to chose from. If your looking for a descent place to catch a meal and maybe have a drink, then this is your place."
Quoc T.,"Corona, CA",162,19,2,1.0,5/6/2016,Carside to go requires you to go inside. What's the point of asking for the make and color of my car if I have to go inside anyways? Have the option when you order online to pick up inside or have someone come out. Sat outside for about 5 minutes and went inside to find my order just sitting there behind the counter.
Kathy K.,"Mira Loma, CA",0,28,,5.0,7/6/2016,"My husband and I had lunch at Applebees today and it was very, very good. We especially liked the new menu and their efforts to raise money for children with cancer. We also like how the restaurant is trying to become part of the community by posting pictures of various schools and sports team. Staff was friendly and efficient. I ordered the Oriental Salad and Mac. & Cheese from the lunch menu and it was perfect size and super delicious. Well done Applebees!"
Danmo H.,"Montclair, CA",231,590,1953,2.0,2/16/2015,"It's your typical Applebbee's.  We usually get the 2 for $20 and order the cedar plank chicken which is surprisingly good and one of their healthier entrees.  We were first time visitors to this location.  Food was fine.  The reason for 2 stars is because of service and the company's attempt to take that away -- on the table was one of those electronic devices where you can place your own orders, etc.  While a server did come to our table to greet us and get us started with drinks, etc., it was clear that he was overloaded with tables and had difficulty getting around and refilling drinks.  More staff was needed.  Sure there's that electronic device, but it can't answer questions about the menu or make substitutions to dishes.  It's also very impersonal.  And if you used it and received next to no service, why would you tip.  It's definitely going to hurt those servers.  Sometimes you just can't replace people with computers and or machines--this is one of those areas."
Heather D.,"Corona, CA",1,3,1,1.0,11/1/2015,"Server was unfriendly, didn't introduce herself, walked away while taking our order, didn't smile. I think because we got the 2 for $20.00 deal she didn't care about us. The app hit the table and she never checked on us. Someone brought our dinner and still no server to check on us. I would've ordered a drink from the bar or maybe even dessert but none were offered to me. When she brought the check she didnt say thank you or ask if we wanted anything else. Such a let down. Definitely don't recommend this location at all."
Katie D.,"Riverside, CA",4,3,,1.0,9/11/2015,Decided to go here with my husband and give this place another chance even with our bad history of them messing up our food. We waited quite awhile for our server and when she finally came she had an attitude. I asked to substitute the side for my steak for rice instead and she rolled her eyes and said she will ask and brought the manager out to clarify what I wanted because she couldn't grasp I wanted rice instead of quinoa. They undercooked my husband's greasy hamburger and didn't not refill my drink even after I asked for it twice within 30 minutes. Will not be back.
Dave S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,37,4,1.0,10/16/2015,"So the All-Day Breakfast burger it is for myself and the wife. Both arrived about 15 minutes after we ordered and both were wrong. Nowhere on the menu does it say pickles are on the burger (we verified). We both hate pickles so we asked the server (Jesse) if this particular burger was supposed to come like this. He says ""oh of course, all of our burgers have the pickles."" So great, now we have to send them back while the kids eat and wait. Both came back looking and tasting terrible. We notify the manager who apologizes.  Long story short, even though both burgers were terrible (wife ate less than half and I ate even less), the server drops the bill off and says ""we took both burgers off, sorry about that."" I was relieved, I didn't have to pay for something I didn't eat. WRONG, he lied. He took one off and left the other. When I asked him, he pulled a used car salesman tactic and began circling things on the itemized bill and ran off. As he left I said ""ok, so you didn't take off two right?"" to which he replied ""both are off, yes."" Um, ok.  Times must be tough for Applebees. They really needed that additional $10.99 to stay in business I guess. Well, I guess I'll have to stick with one of the other 17 restaurants in the area from now on. There was absolutely nothing good about this visit. Thank you manager and Jesse for nothing."
Monika H.,"Ontario, CA",19,12,64,5.0,3/14/2014,"I had the roma pepper steak (550 cal menu) and it was AWESOME! Portion looks small but I actually didn't finish. With dinner came a coronita margarita and that was also really good! Friendly service all around, the manager even came and removed the last of our dinner plates. That is definitly something you don't see every day :)"
Richard G.,"Corona, CA",3,10,28,3.0,5/31/2012,Went to Applebees for lunch today. Was not my best experience here. Now i have to say it wasn't really Applebees fault. Our hostess and server were both very friendly and prompt. We were just seated next to a couple of screaming kids that kind or ruined my overall experience here. I like kids just not screaming in my ears while I'm trying to eat.  As for the food........now first I have to throw out there that I'm the worlds most pickiest eater. I ordered the new fried green tomato and turkey sandwich. The sandwich sounded like a somewhat healthy pick but it was actually very greasy. Probably from the fried green tomato im guessing. The rest of the foods and drinks were good. Ive been here a bunch of times and had both really great experiences and not so great experiences but this rating is based off mt visit today.
Valerie R.,"Corona, CA",17,64,4,5.0,7/18/2015,We had Dayna as our waitress. .she was the BOMB! !!! LOVE her..she suggested great food. .ask for her..oh please tip her
GL L.,"Riverside, CA",0,23,7,1.0,7/5/2015,"Bad service! I ordered a salad to go and it took one hour for my salad to be ready, turns out they had some ""miscommunication"" between staff members so my order was never processed."
Glen C.,"Carson, CA",1431,290,544,5.0,12/11/2013,"This particular Applebee's popped my Applebee cherry after a long day of promoting with my girlfriend and some street teamers years ago.  The ambiance is like a dark version of Tchotchke's.... the restaurant that Jennifer Aniston's character from the movie ""Office Space"" worked at.  I was like ""DAMMIT!"" when I couldn't find anybody acting like a Brian, to tell me about the steak fajitas and that I had a case of ""The Mondays"".   Applebee's looks like a place where random horders left a bunch of their stuff around the damn walls and walked away for months so they can buy even more stuff to put around their walls.  The food is AWESOME.  Damn near everything at Applebee's is delicious.  Parking is cool abundant since it's within a huge stripmall off a freakin' freeway.  I wish there were more Applebee's around the Carson/Torrance area though.   5 stars for this one!"
