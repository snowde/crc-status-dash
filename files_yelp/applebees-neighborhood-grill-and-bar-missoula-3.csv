Randy P.,"Missoula, MT",433,204,1086,3.0,7/4/2016,"I see the reviews here are not very flattering.  We came here last week for dinner. Our server did an excellent job our drink were always full and if we asked for anything he was right on it.  The food was good for a chain restaurant, we had the 2 for $25. Your choice of 1 appetizer and 1 entree. We chose salad for appetizer, good size salad and then we had sirloin stake and BBQ  ribs with there mac and cheese as a side and broccoli as the other side. No complaints on the food. Drinks were not that good. :("
Sheila C.,"Quilcene, WA",4,29,14,3.0,6/23/2017,"The three stars are for the staff! We had to wait almost 25 minutes for the food then it was wrong! How do you confuse a burger & fries with Mac & Cheese. My grilled shrimp Caesar had far to much cheese it was glued to the lettuce which by the way was all white stalks, very little Romain leaves. This  Applebee's should take a look at the Sequim WA restaurant great service & food."
Anna M.,"Bellflower, CA",0,14,,1.0,8/29/2017,"Would definitely not recommend this location.  Went on a Tuesday afternoon.  So it wasn't busy. Hostess was too busy on her cell phone at the front counter to greet us or to even notice we left.. Our server was nice.. but smelled like he hadn't showered in a week and while the food runner was bringing food out, while he was blatantly chewing Gum with his mouth open. Over the food. So disgusting!! Just moved here, but won't be back"
Scott E.,"Missoula, MT",1,3,,2.0,9/29/2016,"Let me say simply No Gluten Free offerings.  They said they could do things to support it, but cross contamination was everywhere, and honestly I don't just want to eat a salad every time I go visit."
Barbara M.,"Missoula, MT",0,19,3,2.0,3/12/2016,"I ate here last week and was yet again disappointed.  The food was ok and our server was pleasant.  But there is no flexibility of the staff who are seating customers.  It's always noisy  there and even though we ask to be seated in a certain section where it is not so noisy we are always told they have to save those tables for larger parties - that by the way- never show up.  Plus their bathrooms are dirty, and that's always a turnoff. We will not be going back because that's two times too many."
Sarah M.,"Missoula, MT",17,17,,2.0,6/28/2016,"I've been to several other Applebee's locations that have been consistently great in every way, but for whatever reason the Missoula Applebee's is a huge let down.  The service is pretty slow regardless of how busy they are, and the waitstaff often has other employees take food and drinks to tables for them, even when they're obviously not that busy.  My friend ordered an overpriced cosmopolitan and got some opaque, Pepto Bismol pink concoction with a lemon garnish instead of a lime.  It didn't look or taste like a cosmo, which isn't a difficult drink to make.  My Oreo shake was full of tiny bits of ice and yet was still really runny, like they don't use real ice cream.  It was like drinking watered down, icy cream, and it was honestly so unappealing I couldn't finish it.  I ordered baby back ribs and they were not tender whatsoever and very difficult to pull apart.  The meat was tough and stringy.  On a previous occasion I had ordered one of their low calorie dishes that was so incredibly salty I couldn't finish it.  Save your money and go somewhere else in Missoula that has better food, better service, and better prices."
Jason T.,"Missoula, MT",29,16,26,2.0,12/20/2015,Went to enjoy lunch with family friends who have young children. The kids were excited to see the tablets on the table. While in conversation all 3 kids were playing games. We were shocked to learn that it was charging 1.99 per tablet to our bill! There was a small disclaimer on the tablet that the kids skipped by when hitting the play now button. Though the waitress was nice enough to remove the charge from our bill when we explained our situation how ridiculous that they use this as a cash cow. Obviously children see iPads and want to play on them. How about you make food and sell it to us and let the atmosphere be a bonus to your customers. Not impressed!
Jessica A.,"Missoula, MT",11,67,98,3.0,7/22/2013,"We went there for happy hour and ordered the new pretzel with beer cheese dip which was tasty while it was hot after it cooled down it became this thick brick of processed cheese so eat it fast..      The service was good as was the rest of the meal, I haven't eaten here in quite awhile but the food doesn't seem to taste as good as it used to."
Meg G.,"Missoula, MT",20,41,,2.0,5/21/2015,"The service here is ok. However the food here is overpriced and under portioned for said price. Can I get more than half a handful of fries on my plate? My food is never hot here either, it is always luke warm."
Morbius K.,"Missoula, MT",0,12,,1.0,4/8/2014,"New to town, we've had good luck with Applebee's in other cities so we gave it a try. Wow... We took our kids with us, not realizing its more sports bar oriented. It was incredibly loud on a weekend (understandably) but we were seated after a 30 minute wait and then ignored for 45 minutes. We had to flag down a random waitress to ask for drinks and a random waiter for our food. My wife's food was bland, our kids' and mine were cold. The drinks from the bar were fantastic. First time I've left change for a tip, we won't return and don't recommend this place for families or people who want to eat and not drink."
Curtis M.,"Missoula, MT",25,92,69,2.0,3/8/2014,"Bland and expensive. Pasta and fish dishes are $12-$15 each and are thrown together without flavor. Pricing is confusing and it is easy to accidentally order wrong. Twice now the servers have not guided us through their various specials to make sure we were getting the advertised price (which was high to begin with). Also, they don't have lunch on weekends so out lunch was $20 for 2 people. Seriously you can do better than this place."
Rhonda S.,"Missoula, MT",46,11,,1.0,6/23/2014,"It has been 5 years since I've had the horrible dining experience in Missoula, Mt known as Applebee's....and I still shudder at the thought.  As a transplant to Missoula from Kansas City, I was thrilled to find Applebees (since Applebee's is headquartered in KC) Most horrible dining experience ever, slow and  below average food, and for desert  the chocolate cake that was supposed to be served with a side of ice cream.....was not...not apologies offered BUT they did not forget to charge us for the expensive mediocre coffee. So embarrassed that we hail from the same place. I will NEVER go back unless I'm in Kansas City. You've been warned leave this restaurant alone!"
Brandon W.,"Missoula, MT",17,31,4,2.0,7/30/2011,"Food is always the same. I know it's a chain, but you'd think they might have a little more to offer at this point. The last time I was there our waiter seemed to be too cool for school. It seemed as if we were a second (or third) priority for him.  Sub-par food + lackluster waitstaff = find a new place in the neighbourhood"
Don I.,"Clinton, MT",12,301,3,1.0,2/23/2013,"after a good experience i went back and ugh, what a shonda  Ate at Applebees in Missoula Montana with my wife and child on 2/15/13 . I ordered the fettuccine, wife ordered steak and chicken nuggets from childs menu. The waitress was slower than molasses, finally she took our order which would not come for another hour. I ordered the fettuccine without shrimp. I did not think it was a big deal, apparently the chef added  shrimp and had to remake it. But no one told us. so we waited one hour for our food. I am sure my wife and child's food sat while they remade my fettuccine. Which by the way was way overcooked.   I had to ask the bartender what happened to our food as our waitress vanished into oblivion. She did not bring back a pepsi refill to my wife until 20 minutes later. So here we are an hour plus 5 later and our food arrived. My child's food was cold, my fettuccine was much and my wife's steak was cold. We complained but were told that it was not their fault because they were short staff. What?  I paid the $26.36 bill and left a $4 cash tip that she did not deserve. I called and complained to a manager later in the day and was asked  not to contact corporate and he sent us a whole $20 gift card.....wow how generous.....  This was truly a horrible experience......."
Forrest V.,"Fargo, ND",1,11,1,1.0,7/13/2014,Ordered a chicken Caesar salad didn't think it was possible to mess up the taste of a salad but Applebee's managed to
Gary C.,"Missoula, MT",0,3,,1.0,11/22/2014,"Last Saturday evening, November 15th, I ate at the Missoula Applebee's in a group of seven. It was fairly busy but by no means packed. I hadn't eaten there for awhile and was quickly reminded why. Service was barely adequate and somewhat slow. I had the Cedar Plank Salmon. It was the worst salmon I've ever had in my life. I could have cooked better in my sleep. Usually I suffer in silence but no more. It's expensive to eat out these days so when our waiter made a rare appearance I told him it was awful and I couldn't eat it. This left some mouths hanging open at the table. The waiter was helpful in figuring another option which left mouths hanging open at the table that I took him up on it. I ordered the Portobello Chicken which was more palatable at least. In the end, no thanks. This restaurant has sub par service and food and I'll spend my hard earned money somewhere that cares."
Amanda A.,"Missoula, MT",1,22,,1.0,2/2/2012,"Usually I'm up for eating at Applebee's but the one is Missoula is not worth it.  I have yet to experience good food here.  Often times the meat is overcooked and the pasta dishes seem to lack any taste.  My last experience included a horrendous waiter who was so concerned with a group of young girls that he didn't even look at my group while we ordered.  I suppose I should be greatful he took our orders at all, the table next to us didn't even finish ordering before he tried walking away.  To further annoy me, he brought our check within minutes of our food arriving.  I had barely two bites of food and he was trying to push me out the door.  Needless to say I got my revenge when I finally paid the bill and gave him the tip he deserved."
V L.,"Missoula, MT",2,6,1,2.0,5/22/2011,It smells funny in here. Like sweaty shoes. And waitresses are blunt liars. Food is sub par.
Ray E.,"Missoula, MT",0,1,,1.0,11/13/2012,"Poorly cooked food.  We had to send our steak back three times.  The result?  A charred sirloin steak that was still purple in the middle.  Last time, the chicken breast was overcooked.  We had boneless chicken wings for an appetizer; and the celery was old and limp.  Poor effort by the kitchen staff.  Our server tried hard and the manager comped our meal.  But we're done going to Applebee's for a very long time."
Bobby B.,"San Francisco, CA",267,215,16,3.0,11/28/2008,"I am having trouble writing about Applebees, why you ask, because the Missoula Applebees is like almost every other one across the US, some dishes OK, others not so good.... If I was rating all Applebees at once I will give them 2 starts, the Missoula one is getting a higher ranking because the staff is very friendly and the portions somehow seem a little bigger than some of the others I have been to. They also were very quick to refill my ice tea and that is something I have had bad luck with at similar places. I have been to this Applebees many times over the years and will continue to go back when I am in town, however I usually stay away from Applebees when I am not in Missoula so I guess it must say something for this place, or the lack of decent places in Missoula."
