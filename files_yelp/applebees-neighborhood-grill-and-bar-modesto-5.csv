JT T.,"Riverbank, CA",263,3,,5.0,11/30/2017,"Wow, I had such an amazing experience at apple bees for the first time in a long time. I just came in for a few beers and some 1/2 off appetizers. Nonetheless, I was very impressed by a particular server. His name, I think, was Bryce. He was very prompt, fast, and friendly. He made my Applebee's experience awesome. I will definitely attend this specific Applebee's again!"
Halley P.,"Gridley, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/7/2017,"A couple days ago, I had a good day. I went to my classes, I passed an exam, and I did some online shopping for Christmas presents. A couple friends wanted to hang out so, I mean, of course I obliged! We went to the mall, walked around for a bit, did a little more shopping, and worked up quite the hunger. (Note: This is when mistakes were made) We decided on Applebee's because of the location, affordable prices, and the Monday burger deal ($7.99 burgers and fries).  I am quite the bacon connoisseur (not really...I just love bacon) so I got the triple bacon cheeseburger. It. Was. Delicious.  The cheese was gooey, the patty was juicy and NOT pink, the bacon was crispy. It was overall quite good. I said goodbye to my friends, headed home, went to bed, and woke up for class the next morning.  An hour into my class, I felt some gastrointestinal distress. I am lactose intolerant so I am no stranger to this, but it was different this time. I excused myself and went to the bathroom. I sat there for nearly triple the amount of time a bathroom break should take. I finished up, went back to class, started to die inside, then eventually left the class to (unbeknownst to me at the time) SIT IN THE BATHROOM, DYING, FOR 90 MINUTES.  After the intense diarrhea and nausea, and after the toilet seat imprint felt like a permanent body modification, I tried to drive home. I ended up pulling over multiple times to regurgitate my dinner from 10 hours ago. I spent my entire day in a repetitive circle of vomit and diarrhea because Applebee's does NOT STORE THEIR MEAT PROPERLY. I know I don't have E. coli because that takes a couple days to arise, and I am not a medical professional, but this restaurant did not follow food safety protocol.  Either they let their beef patties sit at room temperature for too long, only to be frozen and reheated later and served to an unknowing guest, or their staff does not wear gloves/wash their hands/who knows. I cannot go back in time and ask, nor can I change the past. But I can let the fellow food-eaters who look at these Yelp reviews know about this location and the food they serve.  If you enjoy being in gastrointestinal distress, by all means, go here and enjoy a cheeseburger. --Management will be contacted--"
Len Len S.,"Tolleson, AZ",6,9,35,2.0,9/18/2017,"Came to eat up after a long day at the mall with a friend!  Got a whisky bacon burger, bourbon street chicken and shrimp, plus 3 appetizers (boneless wings, wonton tacos, and mozzarella sticks.) it was the 2 for $20 so we thought why not split.  Our server was great, she was so nice! She didn't mind us being loud haha.  - So the whisky bacon burger was..... ok.... nothing special about the meat at all. The only flavor I really got was from the bacon, but the whisky sauce that it came with was REALLY overpowering, like a weird BBQ taste. I took one bite and couldn't finish the rest.  - the bourbon street chicken was something left to desire; The shrimp was so tiny but it came with garlic butter and it really was packed with flavor. The chicken  Was so juicy and tender but it was TINY! Literally the size of my palm. There's no way I would have been able to get full with just that. Lastly, the potatoes that came with it were flavorless and dry. so I would probably skip on this.  The appetizers were jut plain old appetizers to me, the only stand out thing to me was the wonton tacos! The chicken seating is questionable and was a little cold but as soon as the coleslaw hit the tastebuds it just.... made sense! Seriously so bomb. I'm kind of mad they only gave us three!  Peach tea tasted like green tea with peach syrup, so there's that for you guys.  Don't think I'll be coming again very soon!"
Berryhill 3.,"Modesto, CA",21,11,6,1.0,11/15/2017,For my birthday Applebees reward club send me a coupon for a free dessert. So I decided to have my birthday dinner here. The waitress Lilybeth argue with me about my coupon on my email sent from the restaurant. And then the waitress sent me a joke dessert instead
Deborah S.,"Modesto, CA",47,3,,1.0,12/14/2017,"Service was good not so much food.ordered steak with shrimp came with fries and green beans. Ordered steak med, halve the steak was red other halve well done. Fries cold and soggy from juice of steak and beans cold. My husband ordered a hamburger med and got well done and tasteless. Manager did not seem to care and just said some people dont like runny steak juice not addressing anything else."
Tiffany M.,"Manteca, CA",1,32,8,2.0,4/5/2017,"Although I enjoy the convenience of Carside-To-Go, I feel like the last few times they've shorted me on food. I recently got a lunch combo (wrap and salad) and although the salad came in a decent sized container, I opened it up to find it a quarter of the way full. I went back another time for dinner and my fiancée got the three cheese chicken cavatappi and there really wasn't that much in there; you could see the bottom of the container it came in.  I would rather eat the first thing I found in a trash can than go back to Applebee's."
Terry C.,"Modesto, CA",76,59,10,4.0,11/6/2017,"Food was pretty good. Atmosphere was a nice surrounding. Waitress was good, she needs to show just a bit more hospitality but other than that, pretty good place to eat."
Mckenzie B.,"Modesto, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/14/2017,"First off I want to say I was looking forward a great farewell dinner with my friends before I departed for Europe. When we arrived we were told it was a 25 minute wait to eat at the Applebee's. We waited for approximately 30 and went to check in and be sure we had not been skipped. Matter of fact we actually had... When inquired with the manager she said that they had called our name ... we had been sitting within ear shot but our name was never been called. Perhaps there was a mixup of names. Either way there was absolutely no effort to correct the mistake and we were told that her weight has now been extended to 45 minutes. There is a terrible example of customer service, and absolutely no effort to rectify the situation."
Braulio B.,"Stockton, CA",76,4,,5.0,9/24/2017,"When you go, make sure you ask for rico, even though he's a Niner fan we had a good time! Great service!!"
Cookie M.,"Modesto, CA",7,63,,1.0,1/8/2017,"The most recent visit was definitely a disappointment!  When I called to see if they still had their buy one, get one free entree, they said yes.   When we were seated the waitress said they didn't have that promotion anymore.  That was only the beginning...She was rude and inattentive! We had to wait for refills several times, our food was cold and burnt.  The manager on duty didn't seem to really care about our complaints.  We will not be returning to Applebee's!"
Monica G.,"Modesto, CA",33,2,,1.0,8/5/2017,"Was totally disappointed. Went and stood at the hostess station to get on the waiting list and was ignored. There were no less than 3 servers standing around talking, without even acknowledging our presence. This went on for a couple minutes. It certainly wasn't terribly busy (especially for a Saturday night at 7). Finally someone came over to take our name, but we were so irritated that we left without being seated."
Calandra M.,"Modesto, CA",82,6,,1.0,8/12/2017,First of all why is that two parties that were here after me order was taking before mines. I sat here for 30 minutes with no sliver ware I have not been asked if I wanted water and he waiter act like he scared of black people. This is very disappointing
Agnes A.,"Turlock, CA",435,11,1,5.0,8/12/2017,I had the burbon bacon chicken sandwich and it was delicious the service was good as well.
Justin v.,"Long Beach, CA",1,5,,1.0,11/12/2017,"Just came here w my son. We ordered an appetizer and waited 20min for it to come out cold, we get are food 10min after that. By the time my food got there I had no drink and I asked the waitress to get me a refill and 20min go by and still no refill, she comes back to my table twice still haven't gotten me a refill and still hasn't brought my kids milk shake that we ordered when we first got here. So let me sum it up appetizer cold, fries w meal cold, shake brought at the end of meal and I had to go the bar to get my own refill after 30min of waiting for a refill! This place sucks and I'm so pissed I wasted 40 to go out to eat w my son here ohh and by the way they charge you for using the games on the tablets but hey don't tell you they just quietly add it to the check and hope you won't notice the $2.00 fee"
Ali L.,"Ripon, CA",14,34,7,4.0,10/31/2017,"I eat here quite frequently. It's a great go-to lunch spot. Great menu, the prices are awesome, never had any issue with slow service or staff. I'm honestly surprised by the number of complaining reviews. I've even been here when we have to wait because it was a busy time and find it far more pleasant than the waits we've experienced elsewhere. Applebees has great Honey Mustard, I always get some if I have fries! My only qualm is that I always ask not to be seated on the Sisk side of the restaurant. For some reason, the way noise gets amplified is overly irritating to the ear."
R. U. H.,"Clearlake, CA",0,24,4,4.0,6/22/2017,"Service was attentive, food delicious, and enjoyable. Five stars!, except for slow to get food. The waitress noticed and provided free chips and salsa! I'd easily go there again. I enjoyed my healthy food, but there was a bit more greasy food on other's plates- like the sandwiches had 'buttered' toast. That's what Americans like."
April D.,"Modesto, CA",0,14,1,1.0,10/8/2017,"I could not believe how poor our service was we first walk in to ask for a table of 5 and a baby and the girl was not happy she was really upset and said ""well it can take about a hour or 45 minutes (rolling her eyes)"" I can tell they were busy so I told her it was fine we could wait then we sat waited for our table as soon a we sat down I can tell the waitress was  under the influence she had to come back to our table 4 times to ask my fiancé what he wanted to drink brought the beer super late she almost tripped 2 times bringing our drinks and appetizers the waitress didn't at all come and check on us she went on break without telling us we had to call the manager he didn't really care and acknowledge the situation they brought us the appetizer without any utensils like if we were suppose to eat with our hands  then we asked for utensils and  we didn't get any still, we literally ate with our hands  then when our food got their I noticed that my friends food was taking a while it took them 50 minutes to notices they didn't receive their food I called for the manager he finally noticed the we were being treated very poorly never in my life experienced this kind of poor customer service"
Tanvi G.,"Modesto, CA",42,43,83,3.0,11/8/2016,"I've recently been going to the carside to go at this restaurant. It's great. You get the restaurant quality food without getting off your car. I do online orders and they are pretty accurate. My problem is that every time, they somehow mess up the order. Sometimes they forget an item and sometimes they put the wrong one. Once the chicken tenders I ordered tasted horrible and I was unable to finish it, which was sad, since the plate wasn't exactly cheap."
Cyndy H.,"Modesto, CA",1,18,7,1.0,1/29/2017,"Apple Gilroy Inc should pay better attention to their individual restaurant ratings on Yelp. If they read any of these reviews AT ALL, they would surely be motivated to do a little housekeeping at this location. IT'S INEXCUSABLE to operate a store with such horrible ratings, poor service and bad food. And the worst part is, they really don't do much cooking of their food at all....so how is it possible to get it so wrong? Cold coffee, burnt decaf coffee, ridiculously slow business, dirty tables/booths all over the restaurant, and they ran out of clean spoons....(seriously....the server brought us PLASTIC spoons because they ran out of clean ones at 10pm. How does this happen at a restaurant??) I've eaten at several Applebee's, but rarely in my own hometown. We will NOT be returning here. This is not an Applebee's-quality store and both the Manager and Apple Gilroy Inc should be incredibly embarassed. They should try out their own restaurants once in a while and see what it's like as a patron.  Disappointed...."
BaNaNa B.,"Modesto, CA",1,153,,1.0,1/20/2017,"The food here is not bad when they serve it hot, but the service really sucks.  I have had decent service from a few waiters on rare occasion, but those times are not the norm.  My last visit here my waitress must have went on vacation during the time I was there.  I even asked other servers to ask my waitress to come to the table and still she was MIA.  When she did return, she acted as if we were bothering her.  I asked to speak with the manager and he really did not give a damn about the poor service and botched food order.  I see no reason to return to this location."
Patricia V.,"Atwater, CA",1,9,1,1.0,2/18/2017,"This was our first time at this applebees & they suck! We waited 30 minutes to get our plates, they forgot our dinnerware & nobody came to check on us at all during our visit . Our food wasn't well done & the workers are snobby. Zero stars! Every single worker went to the back corner instead of helping us customers ."
Sammy S.,"Antioch, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/5/2017,"Cold food, looked nothing like the menu pictures. Salad that was ordered was soggy. Just overall disappointment. No coming back."
Richard B.,"Henderson, NV",63,15,3,5.0,12/6/2016,"My first time here,  was just passing through. Was greeted at the door. Got a table quick, Ozzy took my order, got my drink to me fast and kept it full, food came out fast, right after my side salad.  Was full enough to pass on dessert, the Presto made it easy to pay and no sweat. Will definitely be back when I'm in town.  Highly recommended."
Helen M.,"Modesto, CA",22,5,1,2.0,7/23/2017,Ordered the steak southwest salad and the steak was tough and chewy. The worst was the salad greens that were wet with some type of dressing mixed in with shredded yellow cheese and thin tortilla strips. I got old lettuce that was turned dark on the edges and the whole salad part was one mushy pile. I brought it to the attention of my waiter and he just shrugged his shoulders. I'm pretty sure I won't ever be going back.
Aaron F.,"Modesto, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/11/2016,"Wish I could give it no stars...two hosts and ten servers walking around...half empty tables...and then they told us it would be a 45 minute wait because corporate does not allow them to split up the party and then sit them in the same section of the restaurant at the same time..needless to say they didn't want our business, so we left...off to Chili's!!"
Barbara R.,"Oakdale, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/19/2016,So far just had spinach dip and chips. Chips very stale. Rest of lunch ok. They did give credit for chips and drink.
Ana R.,"San Antonio, TX",1,12,,1.0,8/5/2016,"Upon arrival, the first thing you notice is that the place smells dirty. I was unimpressed with the my meal. The mashed potatoes were obviously microwaved and my chicken was over fried. It was almost black. The spinach dip appetizer was also obviously microwaved as well. The ladies restroom smelled awful and had sticky floors. Totally gross here. Save your time, money, and calories. Go someplace else!"
Paige J.,"Modesto, CA",5,12,4,1.0,1/11/2016,"My husband and I aren't really picky when it comes to restaurants or service, we're pretty relaxed but this place was a dump. When we were seated, our booth (and the surrounding tables and booths) had large food droppings and dirty napkins under them. I had to clean off somebody else's grilled chicken from the bottom of my shoe when we left. Our waiter left half way through our meal, which isn't really a big deal. But he didn't tell us he was leaving. Then when we got our food, our plates were barely half full. The other staff were a bit unprofessional as well. One waiter was telling customers he needed extra cash as he gave them their bill. The other waiters were talking to each other about the football game from across the restaurant. We had to stop our conversations while they were talking because the whole thing was so distracting. The whole visit was a disappointment."
April W.,"Modesto, CA",0,15,7,1.0,9/3/2016,"Wow! We used to come here a lot back in my 20's ( about 10 years ago) so when I stopped in with my kids today I was expecting roughly the same experience. I ordered the Brew Pub Philly sandwich. The meat tasted like it had been microwaved and was almost all gristle. The little cup of blue cheese dressing that goes on the burger was literally congealed into the cup. There was no ketchup on the tables for the fries. No sugar packets for tea. My kids ordered the Mac n cheese, and it came out dry and looked like it had been cooked several hours before. I was disgusted. Applebee's needs to up their game, because this place has gone seriously downhill. :("
Jimmy S.,"San Jose, CA",7,4,3,1.0,4/19/2017,"Horrible!!! Still waiting at carside after I already placed an order online ,waited in the carside parking spot for over 15 minutes before I called the store to see if they even knows I'm here. Managers even if you guys are busy someone still has to come out and acknowledge that we are here and someone will be with you as soon as possible."
Oscar P.,"Madison, WI",0,25,5,5.0,7/19/2015,When I first saw the stars on this place I honestly did not want to come but my friend said it was good so I figured why not. We got there and in less than a minute we got seated at a booth which is exactly what we wanted. After that it took less than 30 seconds for a waiter to come to us and give us the menu plus take our drink orders which was pretty great. I also spilled my drink on accident and guess what!!!!!! He popped out of no where ready to clean it up and he even suggested the type of burger I should get and it was amazing.  The food was pretty good I've had better burgers but I am a burger person tho so I have a high standard and this burger was good enough for me to Like plus the fries were pretty good also.  I do have to say that I have been to places where the food is bigger and you get more fries but all in all I could say that I would probably be back and to give this place 5 stars is a big deal to me because I don't do that often.
Itssss Me I.,"Modesto, CA",0,7,1,1.0,2/19/2017,Lame! My family and i went to celebrate me graduating from school and the lame skinny  girl with the headband on her head was lame. She made us wait over one hour while she prepared our table! She kept starring and me while she threw the menus and spoons/knifes on the table! Have never seen her before in my life. She told the waitress something about my group and the waitress did NOT bother to ask everyone in my party what our order was going to be. I had to YELL it to her! Lame....Pathetic. You should be great full You have a JOB! You have NO good Customer service.
Stephen S.,"Manteca, CA",2,19,5,5.0,8/1/2016,Wow! I have been to several Applebee's and I would have to say this one rocks. Our server was the best ever! Her name was Mahera. She was the reason I gave this place FIVE Stars! More restaurants need employees like her. She went above and beyond! She was very happy and smiled the whole time. She was patient with me and my family. She always made sure our drinks were topped off and checked on us frequently. A+ service from an A+ employee!!
Matthew B.,"Modesto, CA",2,35,2,1.0,7/15/2016,"Well, the place was pretty busy. The waitress was polite-ish. The food is why I'm here. I only ate my appetizer, and seriously felt nauseous. We got the mozzarella sticks; I mean they were good, but too greasy. After, my table ordered their four cheese macaroni with chicken on top. Looked good, sounded good - it tasted like a spoon full of &$%*& sugar. I didn't even want to know what else could come out of the kitchen, I don't think I could've stomached it. So I pushed my plate off to the side, paid and walked out. First time I've been to Applebee's in a VERY long time, and it will definitely be the last (no hard feelings!). I mean, how do you mess up macaroni and cheese?"
Jamie T.,"Modesto, CA",143,103,255,2.0,10/19/2014,What can I say... I don't often have a good experience at Applebee's but continue to go there on occasion out of convenience like today we have family down so it was a big party.  I got the strawberry and avocado salad which I asked for the dressing to come on the side and it didn't but I'm not much of a complainer so just took a few bites and left not satisfied.  The service was slow we asked for napkins and it took over 10 minutes to get them. Our drinks were refilled slowly.  Our server was nice though. That's about it. I'm sure I'll be back someday even though my experience is never 100%.
Lily S.,"Modesto, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/1/2017,"We were out around the area and decided to order my daughter a kids chicken tender meal w/ fries & a strawberry shake. I placed the order online for take out. I ordered at 8:15 & the site said it would be ready by 8:30. We got there at 8:24, my husband went inside to pick up our order & did not come back to the car until 8:50. He was in there waiting for 20 mins more than the time stated the food would be ready by. As soon as he got in the car, I opened the container of food to feed my daughter & everything was not even hot or warm. I'm just saying but if it they kept us waiting for 20 mins longer than our expected time of pick up, the food should've been hot like it was freshly made. It was almost as if they had just forgot about our order and gave it to us when it was already cold. & the food was not even worth the wait honestly. If I could, I'd give this place 0 stars for their customer service."
Marco D.,"Modesto, CA",139,13,,1.0,10/28/2016,"Ordered food and they forgot my side of garlic fries. When I told them about it, they came out like 2 minutes later with a side of fries. The fries were so stale. They tasted like mcdonalds fries microwaved the next day. Could've made a much better meal at home and I usually go out to treat myself to something better. Not coming back."
Allen S.,"Modesto, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/7/2016,It was alright food but service is atrocious food took so long to get to our table but I can't blame it on the employees the restaurant was packed with people but they could've tried harder it smelled bad in their restaurant the floors were nasty looking and sticky but the restaurant seriously smelled so bad it smelled like gym socks and stinky feet and my aunts steak was so dry she said it didn't even taste like steak I definitely recommend not going there on less you want to try really crappy food that will most likely make your stomach hurt and the employees acted like they didn't even care about the customers it was one of the worst experiences ever in my life and one of the worst dinners I've ever had please do not go to this Applebee's instead go to a way nicer restaurant for the sake of you and your family do not go there Thank you for reading my review and goodnight
Chamar M.,"Tracy, CA",11,39,16,1.0,1/7/2017,"So, I call Applebee's at about 630pm to place a to go order. They place me on hold for 17 minutes. The only reason I got off hold is because I drove to the restaurant while I was on hold! I get there and have to wait an additional 10 minutes just to place my to go order.  I'm ordering dinner for myself and a few CO workers and we're all paying separately. Something we've done numerous times at this location. I inform the curbside to go order taker Cameron that I'm placing multiple orders that are going to be paid separately. He says ok, I give him the orders and 40 minutes later the manager comes out with some song and dance about not being able to accept the CCs in using for payment because the other people aren't here! I've now been here an hour. I work in a 911 Dispatch call center and don't have time for BS like this! They've taken rejected payments this way every other time but now they can't. Then Katie the manager has the nerve to rush me after wasting an hour of my time when they should've informed me of their policy which they've never followed before!"
Tim H.,"Turlock, CA",0,4,2,1.0,1/19/2017,"Stopped here on our way back from the Sac Sports Expo...What a mistake! I see why they have 2 1/2 stars, go the extra few miles to the Turlock Applebee's (it will be well worth it). We sent our meals back 2 times and on the 3 the time the wings were finally warm via the manager. The nachos were another story stale chips strike one, strike two and strike three ( same as above) but at least this time the toppings were warm on the 3rd time out. We sat down at 9 pm. The waiter (Nick) had an attitude as he seemed to not believe us even after I told him "" you try it"" and was told he can't eat the food on the floor."
