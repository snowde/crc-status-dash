Liz W.,"Boston, MA",136,276,227,2.0,6/1/2011,"I used to like this place better, and came here on a monthly basis because it was so good!  But when we came here this weekend, it basically sucked. To start off, the spinach & artichoke dip was great tasting and the portion was large, but it was only lukewarm, when it should have been straight out of the oven!   #2, both steaks that we ordered we asked for ""medium""...and seriously the chef does NOT KNOW what medium means!  One came out well-done and was rather chewy, and the other was rare, bleeding in the center.  Plus, both were salty as hell.  COMPLETE FAIL. #3, I wasn't too hungry and had their soup and salad combo with french onion soup and chicken caesar salad.  The french onion soup was the saltiest soup I've ever had and I could only manage to have a drop of it before I wanted to puke, and the cheese was coated on so thick (but it wasn't fresh and like a layer of rubber).  Also my caesar salad BARELY had any salad in it, and too much dressing and cheese on it, I had to dig for the precious lettuce leaves. bleh."
Steve W.,"Modesto, CA",68,23,5,2.0,5/19/2013,This place sucks I've been there twice and the same exact experience I got a blackened shrimp Alfredo pasta which had no flavor the portion was small . Makes me wonder how this place is still in business .  The service was a lil bit better . If you want a good experience you'll find it somewhere else
Walker S.,"San Diego, CA",13600,511,2167,5.0,2/27/2013,"Excellent service and wonderful food.  Good place to eat.  Our waitress Vanessa help us with our selection and offered advice on sides to allow a split of one sandwich that was perfect for lunch.  While eating the manager Mark Farinas came over to our table to ensure we were being taken care of and, yes, we really appreciate the extra attention.  Highly recommend this Applebee's both for food and service.  Give it a try and tell Mark and Vanessa we sent you."
Eddie A.,"Modesto, CA",0,12,2,5.0,3/23/2014,"This is for the Modesto location- Great food, good atmosphere and very friendly staff.  We'll definitely be back-"
Angkham K.,"Modesto, CA",17,33,15,3.0,11/26/2013,Sucks that you can't call in an order and eat there. They only allow you to call in for to go orders. I explained that I only had a 30 minute lunch but that didn't matter. I guess me and my 6 coworkers will spend our dollars elsewhere.
Jack K.,"Modesto, CA",21,63,34,1.0,8/21/2011,"Well the truth be told I don't usually eat here. Have had bad experiences before. But my Sis-inlaw sent a gift cert for my birthday so here we are. That having been said.. It was terrible yet again. Wife.. Chicken carbonara, chicken and pasta as dry as the paper napkins.  Me, rib basket, ribs have obviously been sitting around and were thrown on the grill to warm (or in my case get burned in places) Sauce has reduced so much that it's overly salty. Fries look like they have been under a hot lamp for a week and taste about as bad.  Service, if you have a large 15+ office party going and the place has many open tables WHY would seat others by them. Could hardly hear ourselves discuss how bad everything was.  So you might be saying.. Why didn't you ask for the manager?? Because all I'm gonna get is the ""opportunity"" to not want to eat here again.  (Sis I love ya all the same) Stay far away.. Corp food would be a compliment for the place."
Omar J.,"Seaside, CA",68,184,157,2.0,1/4/2011,"Ok, Yes I know that this place isn't really the best place to go and have dinner but on NYE I went to the one in Riverbank and had there new  2 for $20 and was really impressed especially with there appetizers. So last night 1/3/11 we went to the Modesto one for Happy hour to celebrate her 21st b-day. WHAT a mess. Did you know that you now have to wear a fucking wrist band if you want to drink.. YES it doesn't matter if your sitting at a booth or the high top tables. A WRIST BAND.. WTF.. Are you kidding me. Im sorry last i checked i was at a restaurant not the water-slides... The drinks were so so and the service was half assed... I dont think i will be patronizing this establishment  any time soon.."
Olivia M.,"San Mateo, CA",108,5,30,1.0,4/11/2015,"Horrible plates and servings..I ordered the same dish I have multiple times, and it's usually great, but this plate was literally 7 bites worth of food..I mean I could see the plate without moving any food..even other plates in our order were scarce..cheap cheap cheap..and a Terrible wait..One waitress was nice but the other who took over for her was pretty much nonexistent..terrible place all around.."
Monique G.,"Patterson, CA",10,118,30,4.0,10/12/2013,Came here at 11pm on Friday night. It was packed. The service was great considering it was so busy. Food came out very quickly. I ordered the honey chicken and shrimp which was surprisingly good. I'm not really an Applebee's fan but since few restaurants are open after 11 I'm sure we will be back.
Karen G.,"Turlock, CA",307,611,7,2.0,9/3/2008,"I've tried to like Applebee's.  Really I have.  Each time I've been here, I've had a bad dining experience for one reason or another.  I won't go into each incident in this review.  One of the times I ordered a salad with chicken and the chicken was still raw in the middle.  Eww.  I totally lost my appetite after that.  I will say though that the servers have always been friendly.  That is worth at least two stars. Despite that, I won't be ""eatin' good in the neighborhood"" any time soon."
Jeannie C.,"Stockton, CA",27,2,,1.0,10/19/2012,This place is horrible! Food feels like it had been microwaved. Doesn't taste fresh! Came out warm. I'm eating their food as we speak.
Gee G.,"Atlanta, GA",0,10,,4.0,10/21/2013,"I traveled from Atlanta to San Fransisco for a conference.  I wanted to spend some time with family members in Fresno, so Modesto was the midpoint.  The food was decent.   Everyone ate without complaints.  The service was good.  Also, the food was reasonably priced (I foot the bill). Applebee's is Applebee's. It's not my favorite restaurant chain, but I have never had a horrible experience either.  It is typically a 2-3 star option. Anyway, I gave four stars because of the manager, Chris.  I was exhausted from traveling, and once I returned to the Bay area I realized I forgot my debit card at the restaurant.  I spoke with Chris, and I received my card quickly with no issues.  He went out of his way to make this possible, and I appreciate it.  An average restaurant coupled with honesty and integrity= happy customer!"
Cyn C.,"Modesto, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/26/2014,"This place is a joke!! Got there had to sit on a dirty table which I ended up cleaning myself since no one came to see if we were ok. But we went there to get a few drinks with friends and as a ""mandatory policy"" (which he called a law) we had to have wrist bands in order to be served a drink. This is understandable but the couple we were with were clearly older then 21 years old. They were 66 and 78, one didnt have her id on her and the manager refused to budge on the ""rule"".  Are you kidding me? They are not 19 year olds trying to get a quick drink. So we left without hesitation to go to the Applebees in Riverbank which has better service anyways. What a joke policy. I would have given you 0 stars but I had to give you 1. Horrible business and just stupid rules all around. Never going there again!! So if your over 50years old be sure you take your id because you will need it to drink."
Sharan S.,"Modesto, CA",123,46,22,1.0,7/23/2010,"I was here earlier this month and had a downright bad experience. The food is bland, but what decided the lowest score was the bad service!  A friend and I changed our mind from a deal to another before we had ordered a dish, and the not-so-kind waiter informed us that his hands were tied because, 'Oh, it's already in the computer and I, uh, can't fix it.' It just seemed like a lazy man's excuse. He did not once consider asking for help. He just came off as a jerk. I guess chomping on his gum while serving us food only helped to reinforce the unhygienic image of Applebee's service.  I don't plan on going back anytime soon."
Gabriel G.,"Modesto, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/25/2012,This place sucks worst service ever we walk on the host is digging thru her purse talking on her cell phone didnt even gave us a menu or silver ware and they took forever to re fill our drinks and gave our food hella late the food was cold just bad all around
Jay M.,"Modesto, CA",0,31,,4.0,7/23/2014,"Of the Applebee's that are near me, this is my favorite. If you have been to Applebee's before, you know what you are getting.  Quite honestly, this place can be hit or miss depending on when you go. I am kind of a regular there so the wait staff all know me.  If something isn't quite right, I let them know and they fix it right away.  Most of the time I go for a quick drink and snack at the bar. It is mostly been very good.  Haven't been here in awhile for a sit down meal with my family.  I can say the bartender here is exceptional but would recommend Chili's down the street for the non bar experience.  They are just a bit more consistent.  The manager has made an effort to check on me from time to time so this is a big plus in my book.  I do get the feeling that this is the better of the three Applebee's near me. I can endorse the place particularly  if it is for happy hour."
Pete S.,"Modesto, CA",9,89,5,1.0,12/16/2009,"Another example of nationwide chain food hell. Bland, Dennys food at time and a half the price. A long wait for a badly made, watered-down drink. And, slow service masked by a corporate mandated, painted on smile.  I try to stay away from the mega-corporate restaurants, but, in north Modesto at 10pm, choices are limited for sit-down food and drinks. Next time a stop at a grocery store for a 6 pack and food to prepare at home will be a better option then Applebees."
T N.,"Stockton, CA",13,52,8,1.0,1/6/2012,This place has the worst service and slow servers. It doesn't deserve a full star.
Alma R.,"Sacramento, CA",323,243,185,3.0,12/4/2009,"My experiences at Applebee's have been quite varied, but tonight after class, it was of the 'good' variation. Took a few minutes to get seated, but once we were, Brooks (our server) was super friendly and accommodating the entire time.  His smile actually lit the room...no joke. :) Anyway, it took forever to decide what my friend and I wanted because not everything sounded overly amazing, but I opted for the BBQ Pork Sliders with a side of fries (and honey mustard sauce...yum!).   My first bite into those babies and I was greatly surprised to find such juiciness and flavor packed into those sliders....it was quite nice!  Probably the best sliders I've had...hands down.  Anyway, the location in Modesto is nice because its near the mall, but other than that, nothing too special, aside from our awesome server."
Marcos S.,"Fresno, CA",0,42,8,3.0,5/31/2014,The food and service at this Applebee's has always been better than the rest of the Applebee's that I've been to. Only the staff the last 2 times I went would group up and look around at the customers talk like a group oh high school kids.
