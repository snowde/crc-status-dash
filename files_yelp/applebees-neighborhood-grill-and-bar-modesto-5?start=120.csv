Germaine C.,"Salida, CA",71,7,,1.0,7/7/2014,horrible food and horrible service. I hate this applebee's. I had food poisoning from their shrimp and I had a waitress talk bad about our group. I was horrified from everything that happen. Worst place ever....
azuritereaction a.,"Modesto, CA",12,8,,5.0,9/24/2011,"people behind us were talking shit about metal, people to our left were hipsters to the max, took 15 minutes from ordering drinks for them to get there, and then they forgot my friend's second drink order for the rest of the night as well as at least 20 minutes for them to take our payment for the check however the fries were the best i'd had in my life anywhere so 5 stars"
Roxy L.,"Stockton, CA",51,258,232,1.0,5/25/2011,"Horrible service, as usual. Boring, dead food. Arent cooks taught to taste food before it goes out? Don't go for happy hour or your birthday because you will be deeply disappointed. only good thing were my friends thar accompanied me on my bday night out.luv them!"
DJ S.,"Modesto, CA",1,25,,3.0,5/30/2010,Just had a fair meal but was next to a family that were noisy rude and drunk.  Happy. Hour should be renamed rude and crude sharing. Just saw their new menu at my last visit.  They have some good options so I am upgrading my rating.
Tyler M.,"Newman, CA",3,86,,1.0,2/22/2011,I don't know  why ppl like this place so much.  The food is awful and isn't priced to what it tastes like the only reason this place gets 1 star is because it has a full-bar
Teresa P.,"Salida, CA",1,18,1,2.0,7/6/2011,The steak was cold. The tables are sticky. The menu pages are sticky as well. I had the stuff meatball it was so good. The boneless chicken regular was tasting salty. I like the music that's playing takes you back.other then that I will not be returning.
Amber A.,"Sacramento, CA",112,12,,2.0,12/30/2010,"My food looked like it was just thrown on the plate, and it didn't taste much better. The service was mediocre, but at least the bathrooms were clean. I'd rather not visit again."
Katrina A.,"Grass Valley, CA",0,11,,2.0,1/12/2013,"While the service was very good, the food was just soso."
Jose M.,"Modesto, CA",0,11,,3.0,8/7/2013,"First lets start by saying this is apple bees, their menu isnt the most creative out there. With that said I enjoy their food most of the time. I usually only go here if friends suggest this place. Avoid going on weekends(Fri-Sun) because all the younger people go out and drink as this has become the new hot spot for young adults. No idea why there are much better places to go spend time with friends drinking than here. Anyway, avoid weekends because their Slow service becomes even more slow and its super noisy as everyone is usually drunk."
Janice V.,"San Francisco, CA",369,600,798,1.0,6/5/2010,"Out of all the Applebee's in the Central Valley, this one is the worst. I came here recently and we the lady opened the door for us which was nice. We got seated and got our orders taken pretty fast which was good. Me and my boyfriend got the 2 for $20 special. It's a good deal because you pick an appetizer along with 2 entrees. I think the deal is only good if you're gonna share it with someone else. We got the spinach dip as our appetizer while I got a 7oz sirloin with mash potatoes and vegetables along with the riblet basket. After being there for a while, we were still waiting for our appetizer. We didn't get our appetizer after the people next to us got their food and they came there hella later than us. We were so mad because we were waiting for 20 minutes already. Within 5-10 minutes of getting our spinach dip, we finally got our entrees. The food was good but I just didn't like the fact that people were getting their food before us when we got there first."
Sonha M.,"Modesto, CA",22,3,,1.0,12/13/2013,"NEVER NEVER NEVER will I return to this Applebee's!! My husband and I have been to this location many times before. But we have noticed that their portion sizes are very small for the price we end up paying and we ALWAYS have to ask for ""extra"" sauce for all of our pasta dishes. How do you serve a pasta dish so dry that it looks like rice? Our truck got broken into and all management had to say is ""it's that time of the year (xmas) and other customers have had the same problem too."" ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! So other cars have gotten broken into and you do nothing about it? At least have a patrol car out there around ""this time of the year"" cameras or SOMETHING! This place is a joke we will take our business elsewhere from now on."
P E.,"Salida, CA",318,335,875,4.0,1/7/2011,Cool place to hang out at the bar. I usually like to eat at the bar area because there's beer and booze. I like to catch a buzz before I eat.
Elyse R.,"San Francisco, CA",155,20,,3.0,9/30/2012,"went here for their 2 for 20 deal after seeing it advertised on tv for a while. food was pretty decent, not bad. got 1 appetizer (spinach & artichoke dip) and 2 entrees (shrimp fettuccine and steak). this is a great deal and perfect amount of food for 2 people - no complaints! we also ordered drinks - white peach sangria and a strawberry margarita - these were pretty good priced as well at about $6.50 each!"
Ana D.,"Lathrop, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/31/2013,"I went here with a few co workers last night and got decent service while our food and drinks were being served. When we were all in the process of leaving, the manager (Chris) approached our table accusing two of my co workers (that had already left) of not paying their tabs. He then began demanding that one of us cover their tabs.I explained to him that I saw both of the girls place cash in their bill folders before leaving. I also saw an Applebee's employee take the folders. I then got on the phone and called one of the girls who ended up coming back to Applebee's and paying both tabs AGAIN. The manager was extremely rude and had about three different stories of what he thought might have happened. On top of all this two different police men arrived who said not one word. The entire situation was extremely embarrassing for everyone. I will never return to this disorganized Applebee's again."
Aleenia A.,"Roseville, CA",15,29,17,5.0,2/17/2013,"Applebee's is one of our favorite places to eat!!!! Although we go in Sacramento because that's where we live this time we got in this one. I got my favorite fiesta lime chicken. My partner got some type of burger. Then we got few desserts one them was Triple Chocolote Meltdown which was deliiiicious as usually. I had a little issue there which was immediately fixed by our waiter Oscar T. and the manager Joel. Joel was extremally professional and made me feel as a valuable customer. Oscar was really helpful when I was trying to count the callories and carbs, he brought a whole list with that info. It was busy night, the invirement was friendly, fast service! We will deff be back!"
Brian H.,"Catheys Valley, CA",74,444,1,1.0,12/14/2008,"Welcome to Applebee's.  We serve bland, homogenized, pre-packaged food.  But you will ignore that because we have lots of cool crap on the walls and a lot of young people frequent our establishment."
Charlie O.,"Waukon, IA",776,1198,210,3.0,12/24/2008,I have to give this one 3 stars at least. The service was excellent. I ordered the southwestern chicken salad. There was plenty of kick to it and that's what I like. Ordered a cappaccino and that's why the 3 stars. It was the worst cappaccino I have ever had. I consider myself an expert on that drink. I would go back for the salad again. At least my chicken was cooked unlike Karen G.'s
cory c.,"Turlock, CA",43,21,21,1.0,3/31/2010,"Ok so my wife and her sister went here for dinner. I decided to order there new Skinny Bee Margarita. Upon receiving it I take one sip and notice it taste like lemon water with a hint of sugar. No alcohol taste at all. So I call the waitress over and ask  ""Why is the Skinny Bee Margarita so watered down?""  Her answer was, ""Because its made with water and its not sugar based. I still will feel the effects but never taste it."" lol WOW!  Next thing was my sister in law ordered a 9oz steak. When it arrived it was so small and turned out to was the same size as my wifes 7oz steak. Again I asked the waitress for an explanation. Her response was, ""It most likely shrunk because of the heat of the flame so its still a 9oz just a little smaller cause of the cooking times"" lol I can see this a tad more but even so the 7oz steak would have shrunk as well and it didn't.  I am not going to say we will not be going back because my wife seems to like this place for who knows what reason but beware of issues like this."
