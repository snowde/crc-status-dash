Abby S.,"Denver, CO",3791,2015,5525,3.0,3/7/2014,"Little known secret: I used to work at the Collinsville, IL Applebee's back in college. If you're ever driving through I-40 between IL and MO, you'll see it from the road. Sexy, huh? One would think that after seeing the same dishes over and over again (not to mention coming home smelling like it), that I would never want to eat at an Applebee's ever again. Not true, I do enjoy a visit to the neighborhood bar & grill every now and then. I especially like their mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. Don't ask me why, I just do. While on a recent rural road trip, the +1 and I were deciding which chain restaurant should be our pit stop. Can you believe that he's never tried Applebee's?!? Everyone has to try it at least once... Just as I predicted, the joint was jumping on a Friday night! It really is a hotspot in small towns, and rightfully so since the food is relatively inexpensive and drinks pretty good. Seriously, I bet their perfect margarita would win in a blind tasting. The menu hasn't changed too much since the early 2000's. Which kinda makes it comforting, probably one of the main reasons why chains like Applebee's have stuck around all these years. People like to know what they're going to get, whether it's in Southern Illinois or Northern California. Our total bill for a steak, shrimp, salad and drinks was less than $40. Pretty sure nothing on our plates was locally sourced or craft anything, but it was salty and filling. And sometimes that's OK... assuming it's a ""once every few years"" sort of thing."
Alex G.,"Modesto, CA",0,14,,1.0,3/20/2016,Yea the waitress was great but you guys need some new cooks! I asked for rare on my steak and it was so overcooked that it was led well. Big disappointment when it comes to ordering a steak. They also messed up two other orders on our table and were a group of 4. So 1 out of 4 sorry you guys dont get a good review. Fries came out cold. No napkins. We had to ask for utensils. Overall not a good place to go eat. Maybe just drinks. But I think the manager needs a reality check when it come to their employees. We had a 40 minute wait and watched all these tables open as we waited. Definately not run proffesionaly. Thank you applebees for making me remember why I dont go. Dont Recomend. But the waitress like I said was really good. She could get a better job elsewhere
Teresa B.,"Modesto, CA",0,51,39,2.0,5/20/2016,I don't like the order pay at table machine thing they have now at many restaurants it feels like a automate not a nice feel.
Kevin S.,"Modesto, CA",69,114,159,5.0,7/25/2015,Lunch/dinner was super light meal cedar lime chicken . This is a must ! Great choice from your waitress Tara.  Your awesome Tara . Very helpful and sweet ! Sorry we haven't been here for awhile. But we will be back
Lakeshia J.,"Modesto, CA",26,161,34,4.0,7/9/2015,Let me start by saying I hate Applebee's. However this one is pretty good. The service was nice even though the waiter seems like he hated his job.  I took off one star because all the table tops on the bar area were dirty and we had to wait for one to be cleaned to sit down.
Peggy P.,"Ceres, CA",15,18,2,1.0,6/15/2016,"Food was so cold the butter wouldn't even melt on the baked potato. The fire grilled veggies were barely grilled, very hard. Not worth the 10 minute wait for a table in 1/2 empty restaurant. Haha. She didn't even produce a bill, just took our card and brought us the sign slip. This is a very screwed up Applebee's. Try turlock or ANY other Applebee's than this!!!"
Kris W.,"Modesto, CA",1,14,5,4.0,8/21/2015,So far so good. Just got here. Waiting for my date in the bar. Waiter is nice and making sure I'm taken care of. Love the watermelon margarita.
G R.,"Modesto, CA",0,12,1,5.0,11/13/2016,"A resounding thank you to Applebee's on Sisk Road in Modesto for your free meal for Veterans, your kindness, attentiveness thru out the meal, and respect you showed to all veteran that came in, making sure we didn't have to wait too long for a table even though your place was packed. The salmon I order, and the free beef entree my husband ordered was delicious. And the waiter gave my a $5. Coupon for next visitI've spent a relaxing non cooking Veterans Day, thanks to Starbucks, Chipotle, Applebee's, among the other restaurants that honor all vet"
Yullanda W.,"Modesto, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/28/2016,"Every time we come to this location they are on point!  Our server was Awesome and super polite and the food was delicious ;-) Never came during happy hour though, but it was still fun. The atmosphere was explosive with graduates there celebrating and people just out having a good time. I will definitely be coming back during happy hour for the half of appetizers and atmosphere! Thanks"
Gina J.,"Tracy, CA",0,10,7,1.0,4/26/2016,"When we arrived it took 10 min for anyone to ask us if we need help. Then we got seated.  Are waitress sucks! she keeps forgetting our drinks, let's see how order  dinner is!  I won't be coming back to this location."
Shanon W.,"Stockton, CA",77,2,,4.0,5/22/2016,Our waitress was Katelin she was very nice and helpful. We were seated in an area that was closed and she had seen that no one was helping us and took very good care of us..
Joan T.,"Modesto, CA",18,7,8,1.0,2/5/2015,"Applebee's has very friendly employees, but this is NOT a good place to eat. The food is terrible. The tower appetizer looks good, but no flavor. The fish and chips were way too oily. The batter on the fish was bland, and my fries were cold. My girlfriend ordered the shrimp pasta, and it seriously looked like one of those frozen dinners from a bag. I've heard that Applebee's Turlock and Riverbank are a whole lot better when it comes to their food; unfortunately, I was so disappointed with the Applebee's Sisk location that I will not be returning to any of their restaurants because it would be a waste of money."
Kellee Y.,"Salida, CA",0,21,,1.0,7/15/2016,"Dirty tables, flavorless food, way too expensive for low quality food. This place has really gone downhill. Years ago it was pretty good, but now it sucks! The appetizers are discussing, salad dressings and sauces are low budget, from the bottle, and the salads and burgers are just bad! Don't waste your time at Applebee's. YUCK!"
Amber M.,"Modesto, CA",0,19,7,1.0,7/8/2016,I haven't been to this location for about 10 months. My mother and I both ordered the Mac n cheese with pepper honey chicken. Our plates were brought out to us cold then we had to wait another 10 mins for our meal replacements. Very disappointed in this experience.
An K.,"Modesto, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/20/2016,"Terrible service. Waited an hour when we only ordered appetizers. When we received the food the order was wrong and they had told us it would be even more of a wait, maybe half an hour or more to correct our order. People that came after us got their food half an hour to forty minutes faster than us. The waitress didn't even come to tell us what was happening. The manager did nothing to correct the situation or make it better, horrible experience and never coming back."
Stan P.,"Modesto, CA",1,13,6,2.0,4/25/2015,"I got it gift card, so thought if take the family out for dinner. The wait was decent, although there was some confusion between the customers in front of us. We were seated at a huge booth for two adult, child and infant. It was a bit odd, but we managed. The wait for the waitress was less than five minutes, but the good was a bit more. Our waitress clocked out for lunch before our food arrived, two of the meals were correct, and two were not.  My ribs were delicious, the kids could care less about theirs, and my wife said her steak tasted burned. We didn't bother to return it. We cut our losses, waited another rather long time for the check (why places wait to get your money is beyond me), left the remainder of the gift card as a tip so as to avoid a return trip. Hopefully, future birthdays and Xmas gifts come in the form of a Chilis gift card."
Johnson Y.,"Turlock, CA",165,99,24,3.0,11/13/2014,"im not a big fan of the food at apple bees but This place is only good for their happy hour that they have, which starts after 9pm and is half off on the appetizers and drinks... its good for the people who want to go get a drink and have something small to munch on at nights and dont know where to really go this would be a great place to go."
Mehndi M.,"Modesto, CA",48,255,271,3.0,2/13/2015,"Just like any other Applebees. Just another chain restaurant that lacks flavor. Sometimes when my family wants Applebees, I pick it up from the Curbside-to-Go service. It's great! One of the best I've ever experienced! The boys working curbside are always friendly and fast!"
Emily T.,"Sebastopol, CA",0,3,,4.0,3/27/2016,"Typical Applebee's, you get what you expect from a chain restaurant. I can say the service was very surprising. Our waitress was very attentive and even able to joke around with us. Even though there were no garlic fries on the menu the waitress was able to talk to the cooks and got us some pretty good garlic fries. Food was normal quality for an Applebee's and exactly what was expected."
Chelsea E.,"Ripon, CA",2,11,41,1.0,3/17/2015,"Me and my husband came here and the server was very nice and he did a good job. Unfortunately the food was terrible.  They canceled my favorite entrée that I used to order and don't even have the ingredients to make it anymore. It was chicken fried chicken which was really really thin breaded chicken cooked perfectly, With homemade Redskin mashed potatoes that had so much flavor, Side of broccoli, and the best Gravy I've ever had. I am now a vegetarian but if they had that entrée I would get it once in a while because I loved it that much.  So my favorite entrées gone but we still decided to come anyway. And I just wanted to order the Redskin mashed potatoes and a side of broccoli. The Broccoli tasted like dirt very very bad. The mashed potatoes had absolutely no flavor and they were so disgusting. My husband ordered a pasta dish which was pretty much the only thing he could order because he's also a vegetarian. Pasta dish tasted like something frozen that was  microwaved. And they gave him a garlic bread which was disgusting and I don't know how they messed up garlic bread because I am obsessed with garlic. But that seriously was the worst piece of bread I've ever had my life. And it was just pasta with the sauce no meat or anything and it was like $12!! We were regretting not going to Olive Garden instead.  We would've paid less and had better food! Also something I found very annoying was right when you walk in the host tells you can sit either in the bar and get appetizers half off or sit in the regular seating you don't get the discount. So we sat in the bar area. Now the host told us that all the appetizers were half off. So we pick 2-mozzarella sticks and onion rings. But when the waiter went to take our order for the appetizers it was so confusing even he was having a really difficult time and it wasn't his fault it's just the  new menus. Currently there's like four different menus for appetizers. And for some reason there's the half off appetizers in the bar area but onion rings isn't included in that. Which the host at the front door told us all the appetizers are half off. Then there's another menu which appetizers are two for seven dollars. But onion rings wasn't on that one either? So the waiter gave us mozzarella sticks and then substituted something for onion rings and rang us up for two orders of onion rings for $.50 each. It was very confusing and a hassle especially for the waiter. Waiter had to go put the order in and then come back to the table like five times to try to write up and charge correct amount for the appetizers ect.   I felt bad for him. because again it wasn't his fault.  Then for some reason to separate the bar and the dining area they hung up clear sheets and when we walked in I thought they were under construction because it doesn't look like curtains or anything it looks like they're hanging up plastic wrap for construction!! Overall I am very disappointed with Applebee's.  Before they made all these changes and took away my favorite entrée I tried to come here as much as possible because I absolutely craved that chicken fried chicken entrée. Now that it's gone I really don't think I will ever eat at Applebee's again.  Everything there tastes like some frozen crap that's been microwaved not worth your money!!"
