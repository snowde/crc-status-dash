Stella J.,"Paint Lick, KY",33,39,37,5.0,1/18/2015,"A great place to stop by after work for a quick meal and drink! Nick C is the bartender we always come to see. Excellent customer service, great food, spot on drinks!"
Carrie G.,"Manteca, CA",3,2,,1.0,10/18/2015,"I order the salmon it was good.... but the veggies were ice cold... and George the server hands me my beer by the brim where you have to put your lips....no etiquette.... I could only drink half my beer cause it grossed me out ....I asked for a discount cause of the food and service....I use to be a server in a steak house...so I'm speaking from experience.... I've noticed in manteca, Ripon,and Modesto there's not a lot of etiquette in most restaurants in these towns...I'll probably giv this ace one more chance..."
Arjun R.,"Chicago, IL",57,27,2,2.0,12/24/2014,"Was going to Yosemite from Fremont, and stopped at this place for dinner. We should have checked the reviews before stopping by. If you want to experience worst service, then this is the right place.  I will think thrice before I go to any Applebees in my life !!!"
Christina T.,"Modesto, CA",134,8,3,4.0,1/13/2016,I'm usually not a fan of Applebee's but we visited for a friends going away lunch. Joseph was our server and I thought he was great. As a restaurant manager myself I always have a habit of keeping tabs on servers when I'm dining out. We had a party of 8 and a baby and he did a great job. We were in a rush and so I didn't get a chance to really thank him so I figured this might help!
Fernando A.,"Manteca, CA",12,37,374,4.0,9/12/2014,This location is much better then the manteca one. This service and food were both good. Our waitress was on top of it from beginning  to end. I had the triple bacon burger and it was delicious. The onion rings were very hearty and tasted very fresh. I would visit this location again.
Caligirl C.,"Modesto, CA",13,50,122,5.0,9/21/2014,"Here we are with my 2 friends just having drinks  3rd drink omg , work tomorrow , this is't  good ... Having fun though"
Yanchik G.,"Bay Area, CA",14,21,43,2.0,5/18/2014,"I'm not coming back to this place. The table wasn't clean. The straw in my glass was smell funny(bad). After the meal we requested one dessert. In a second the waitress brought a bill and no word of our dessert. The bill didn't include the dessert but...we didn't have a time to ask her about, we just were disappointment about this service.  Also, my plate with the chicken and mushrooms had 1/3 of  onion..."
Jenn D.,"Ceres, CA",573,22,6,1.0,9/3/2015,Horrible service and wasn't even busy! Never received plates and Silverwear with our appetizers that we asked for twice! Our entrees were also cold! We're a family of 3 who was there late at night when everyone else was drinking. Our waiter made us feel unimportant and unwanted!
Martha M.,"Ceres, CA",1,39,4,5.0,10/6/2015,I love this Applebee's. The bar tender is super nice. Always gives me the best margaritas. Not too loud. Good crowd. I love their happy hour for appetizers and drinks. I come here about 2 xs a month.
Eric B.,"Fresno, CA",498,99,103,2.0,4/11/2014,"The place is really only good for happy hour since it is so cheap but with cheap food comes cheap service. Only had a dinner salad and when we asked to do our checks split a certain way the bartender got all weird and have us a big attitude after as if we were speaking Chinese. They might want to realize we were on a business trip and that's why we had to split the checks a certain way due to expenses. O and the ""trivia"" game really needs to go or teach the employees how to use a microphone because sounding all muffled and non understandable it's annoying trying to enjoy your time with that game going on."
Sharai S.,"Patterson, CA",1,49,24,1.0,10/8/2015,Food is not ever hot always cold or over cooked almost like they use a microwave. The only thing i don't mind getting is the artichoke dip and thats when the chips aren't stale. Come on applebees your food used to be good a few yrs ago.
Stephanie T.,"East Bay, CA",279,204,59,1.0,10/11/2013,"I've never really liked nor hated Applebee's.  It's your generic, run of the mill restaurant chain.  However, my experience with their ""corporate policy"" today has changed my view of Applebee's to unfavorable; hence, the one star. Went tonight with a friend to enjoy the late night happy hour.  Ordered one round of drinks (margarita and vodka cranberry); everything was good.  Second round, ordered two long islands.  Mine, upon first sip, tasted faintly of something chemical-ish (like a cleaning product).  I tried cleansing my palate and taking another sip; tasted the same as before.  I couldn't drink it at all.  Mind you, we've both been to this location before and have ordered their long island.  It has never tasted like what I had today before.  My friend agreed. We called the waiter over to ask about my drink, in which he then calls the manager.  Manager comes over explains that it is ""corporate policy"" that they cannot take a drink off the tab.  Ok, I'm not asking to take a drink of the tab; merely swap it out.  He said he could get me another drink, but I'll be charged for it.  Honestly, what kind of service is that?  You'd force your patron to pay for a drink that does even taste like it should?  A loss for one drink is better than a loss of customers.  And, Applebee's, you lost two customers today."
Paul Jr P.,"Modesto, CA",8,5,1,3.0,3/29/2015,I been coming to Applebee's for few years now don't love it nor hate it. The food is just average.  The Modesto location is ok little greasy & service slow but the drinks were ok it's good place to hang out with your friends and have a drink
Jason R.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,5,,3.0,5/9/2016,Went here for Mother's Day. The food was ok. The service was ok. Ricardo tried his best. Not the worst experience but not spectacular either.
Esteisy G.,"Modesto, CA",36,7,,2.0,8/14/2015,They always take forever for everything.. I been here many times and it's always usually bad customer service! The last two times I was here they were rude and took forever so I stop going! The food is just okay
Kaitlynn P.,"Riverbank, CA",6,1,,1.0,9/27/2016,"We came in late last night 45 minutes before closing there was still a good amount of people in eating. Immediately your hostess Sofia was rude due to the fact that we came in she said ""We're closing in 30 minutes"" no hello nothing even remotely friendly. She told us to go have a seat so my party of 4 start walking up the two steps she then snapped at us saying we needed to wait for her to go in front of us but her tone was horrible. We were sat down and ordered our food and during the wait another party came in and Sofia was just as rude! We couldn't believe she told these two women that the needed to wait until she walked in front so she made the women walk back down! We had gotten our food and left before closing let alone half the people in your store before us. My younger sister and I were so uncomfortable by how rude and unwelcoming we will be sure to not come in during the late night again!"
Susan M.,"Modesto, CA",0,8,2,5.0,1/8/2016,I don't usually come to Applebee's but went there for dinner with my husband. We Will go back again due to the great service from this manager 'Big Larry'.  My husband had a steak and it was really good!  The customer service from this staff including Ozzy was fabulous. I had a Thai shrimp salad and it was also good. Looking forward to going back!  Thank you Big Larry!!
Patricia C.,"Modesto, CA",0,5,,1.0,10/5/2016,"Just left there for dinner, isriel was our waiter. After our food arrived we realized we had no utensils. sarah walked by and I asked her for them and she walked back to the kitchen. She came back empty handed and walked to her host station. Isriel came back about that time to our table and we told him that we needed utensils and he walked away laughing. I raised by voice by then and sarah walked back to the kitchen and came back empty hand the second time and still avoided eye contact. Sarah walked back to the kitchen the third time and came back and told us that they had no clean silver wear and dropped plastic silver wear packets on the table and told us to use them. I asked for a manager at that time. We asked Asriel for silverware and he told us that there was no clean silver to give us and walked away. The manager came and gave us a lame explanation about how her told them to give us to-go silverware until clean ones arrived. Our food was cold we had a toddler with us and whatever his excuse was we really didn't care. He gave us some % off our dinner. This happen on 8/28 @6:57pm. Check #9120-1163157"
Madison S.,"Riverbank, CA",0,7,8,3.0,6/14/2015,Came with my husband and little one. First off... There is nothing worst than walking into a restaurant and the hostess giving you the fake hi after finishing her conversation with another leaning employee. The entire time we were there I saw her say bye to 2 tables and let probably 10 walk out without saying a word. As someone who has trained restaurant staff for a living... She doesn't cut it. Sorry Lauren. Her leanin friend Mariah I think it was brought us our food and left a bunch of plates on the table. Luckily Angela was awesome and the food was good!!
Jesus O.,"Turlock, CA",0,2,,5.0,3/31/2015,Dude with the long hair is fucking awesome... Inspired me to grow out my hair. I love you man. Keep doing you.
