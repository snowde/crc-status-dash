Lucas T.,"Modesto, CA",111,17,14,4.0,1/4/2015,Lately I've really been enjoying their Happy Hour. Great sliders and super friendly staff!
Alex S.,"Ceres, CA",357,93,8,5.0,1/25/2015,"Breanna was amazing. She was very friendly and prompt. Food was good, overall Great service!"
Chris T.,"Modesto, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/27/2016,"Well. There's no option for zero stars, unfortunate when grading the Applebee's on Sisk rd. This was not our family's first trip to this location. We eat at this restaurant on average twice a month. I don't have much positive to say. Our visits and dining experiences here have been in constant decline. First, cleanliness, rather the lack thereof is profound. I would expect even a casual dining restaurant to have at least the basics of sanitation standards down. Not here by any means. The bathroom is dirty. Walls, floors, sink and countertops. Clearly there is little to no attention paid in at least the men's restroom. I cannot speak for the women's restroom. The sticky table tops, the dirty appetizer plates, the dirty flatware. It's truly bad. The 'water' ordered with a meal tastes more like a Clorox cocktail, every time. I'm sure they do not provide filtered water and if by some shred of a chance it is filtered, the company that services their beverage stations or Applebee's themselves should be embarrassed at the glasses of 'water' they serve their guests. When I send back the chlorinated water and dirty app plates I'm met constantly with a general malaise that is reflective of the overall service in general, never an apology or any real acknowledgement of the issues. I would like to pause to acknowledge the one quality server at the location, a very charming young lady, taller with short hair that has always handled business. Back to the grim reality. I haven't visited this location without witnessing a manager apologizing for some aspect of a patrons meal, sometimes multiple patrons on the same visit, anything from incorrect orders to and I quote an alcoholic beverage 'tasting of ammona.' The FLIES. Flies come from maggots, maggots are attracted to filth. The amount of flies in this restaurant is an atrocity. It's easy to understand why this place is full of flies due to the grime and filth. I can't imagine what the kitchen and back of house must look like. I didn't mention anything to staff at our last visit, which will in fact be our LAST visit. I didn't want the manager to come comp some part of my check, that's not what this is about. I want to like Applebee's, my kids enjoy Applebee's, but I also don't want food poisoning, disentary, or some other microbial infection for my family or myself. I hope somehow this review can begin a process of change for this store. That will not be possible until the very basic tenets of a properly run dining establishment are met. I rescind the 1 star I was forced to give Applebee's on Sisk rd. I give zero stars, I find it truly unbelievable how this establishment is allowed to continue in this fashion. I'm suprised nobody has been made severely ill from the conditions yet."
Casey T.,"Modesto, CA",0,9,,4.0,4/6/2015,"We decided to go to Applebee's the other night on a whim. Haven't been in a few years so decided to try it again. It was pretty busy being that it was a Saturday night during happy hour. Service was not lacking. Our waiter was very attentive. We only order appetizers, but they all were super yummy. The sriracha shrimp was bomb. We will definitely be returning."
Gerald E.,"Modesto, CA",0,5,,1.0,10/2/2015,"My wife ordered food online, to be picked up at the restaurant So I can't comment on that part. This is what happened from right after I walked in to pick up the order. When I got there, the hostess ignored me for a while, then had me wait, and then helped a couple who had just walked in. After she finished with the couple, I approached her and tried to make it more clear that I was still waiting for service. I told her that I needed to pick up the food that my wife had ordered. The hostess then told me that somebody would bring the food. I told her that it was ordered but not paid for, and she said not to worry. The person bringing the food would be bringing my receipt (receipt for unpaid for food?). Along came a young man holding my food, who apologized for taking so long. I told him not to worry, which was met with complaining from his end on how busy he is. ""This is just crazy, I've got so many orders going out."" He then handed me my food, which was quite a bit, filling both my hands with bag handles. Now that my hands are incapable of doing anything short of dropping the bags, the young man shows my a printout of how much I owe him and proceeds to wait. After a couple seconds, he realized that I couldn't pay him with my hands full. He said, ""Oh, I shouldn't have handed you all that"" and then offers to take a (1) bag. With one hand, I pulled out my wallet and slid my card out. I handed him the card in his free hand, and he gave me back the bag. Now my wallet is out because I didn't get a chance to put it away before he ran off. I waited for him to slide the card at his terminal and come back. After about five minutes of waiting on the act of sliding a card through a terminal, I decided that I would take the food out to my car and come back. This made me uncomfortable, as I didn't want to leave the premises without having paid for the food. After I came back from my car, the man came back to me, telling me that he ""had to redo everything"".  What is ""redoing""? I don't know. Why I couldn't have been informed that swiping a card was too hard for them, and they had to do it twice to get it right once? I don't know. After all of that, I signed for the charges and left (to the sound of the guy still complaining about how busy he is) I drove the 3 minutes it takes to get home, and ate stale, soggy fries. The cheeseburger was ok, at best. For dessert, I had ordered strawberry cheesecake. The cheesecake was curdled. At least I am guessing it was curdled. It looked curdled and tasted sour. Applebee's failed me on every step that I was involved in."
Debbie D.,"Napa, CA",57,20,11,1.0,9/5/2014,"I ordered the rib let basket and they talked me into the upgrade for about $2.00. what I got for that $2.00 was about 2 tablespoons of coleslaw with my food. My French fries were un-edible. Obviously the oil hasn't been changed in a while. Also, the salsa with my artichoke dip was spoiled. I'm very disappointed"
Chanmary K.,"Rocklin, CA",32,157,25,2.0,11/2/2010,"Wow~ Applebees has GONE down the DRAIN. Its not like the good old days anymore. We used to come here for ALL OCCASIONS when we were in high school. They certainly down graded a bit or A LOT. 2 for 20. Got some buffalo wings. Don't you guys remember when they used to provide celery and carrot sticks and a side of ranch with your buffalo wings? Yeah, not any more. Like I said DOWN GRADING. Service is always mediocre or below. They changed managers or something, the atmosphere and energy is below the norm. The whole restaurant was probably 1/3 full and we had to wait a good 15-20 minutes for a table!? Right when we were about to walk out they seated us. And they didn't even give us utensils when our foods came out. I used to enjoy this place...its kind of sad. Feels like part of my adolescence years have been stolen from me. :(   (a little dramatic!) But Ill take my money else where."
Joie M.,"Modesto, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/28/2015,The last two times I went to this location the service was terrible! The last visit was about a month ago and I have not been back since. The last two visits I used their carside service because I have an infant and I thought it would be more convenient. It was not. The same girl served me both times and both times she provided poor service. What happened at the last visit made me decide to not go back to this location. I waited in my vehicle for twenty minutes with no sign of anyone. I finally had to remove my sleeping infant from the car and go inside to get my order. When I went in I explained that I had been outside waiting. The girl said nothing. She offered no apology and showed no concern. To top it off she also got my order wrong.
Sessalie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",127,36,29,1.0,12/21/2015,"If I could rate this place zero stars I would. I went here on a Saturday night and the quoted wait time was 15 minutes, but we were sat sooner which was awesome. However, our server didn't come take our drink order more than 5 minutes after we were sat. We weren't actually acknowledged until almost 10 minutes actually. We place our order and let him know which condiments we wanted as our dipping sauces for our mozzarella sticks and our onion rings. I ordered the oriental salad and my boyfriend ordered their American Standard burger with onion rings. We also ordered Mozzarella sticks as our app. When they brought out the mozzarella sticks we let the food runner know that we ordered them with ranch and asked if he could get us some. He said of course, but then we never saw him again. We had to hit the call server button on the tablet that they have on the tables. Finally our server came and we asked him for ranch and he later brought it out. He brought our food and I asked him for the dressings for the salad, but waited a little under 10 minutes for him to come back with them. He brought out my BF's burger that was overcooked, when he ordered it with some pink. The burger tasted like a MCD cheeseburger and was poorly thrown together. We had to call our server on the tablet twice more for napkins that were never given to us and our check. I wasn't offered a refill until after we paid our bill. I will not be coming back to this Applebees. Worst service ever!!! The salad was good, but the horrible service isn't worth it. The manager went to all the tables around us, but skipped our table. I've been to this place with my mom because she lives right by it and they've always given bad service. This was the last straw."
Juan C.,"Salida, CA",11,165,82,5.0,1/15/2015,Love this place to eat at also a good bar at nighttime. The food here is delicious and the employees are nice.
Kaylie W.,"Concord, CA",22,10,3,4.0,11/4/2012,"The rating is for the service we received by the manager.  As far as Applebees go, you can count on several things: the food will always taste the same and usually, the service is pretty bland. We ordered take out, and the guy who brought our food out was super friendly. We got home, opened up our food, and the steak that we had ordered well done was almost purple with how rare it was. It was missing several other key components as well, and we called up the restaurant. The manager and bartender took really good care of us when we came back in, and an entirely new order was up in less than ten minutes, a free dessert thrown in as well with everything else we wanted. Fantastic service for Applebee's standard.  For anyone used to five star food and service, go elsewhere: they messed up a very simple order and did what was right to fix it."
Jeff M.,"San Jose, CA",56,181,327,3.0,6/1/2014,I feel the strawberry chicken avocado salad  is over priced at 10.49 for what you get. I enjoyed it and it is a good low cal item proper price point is no more than $8.00
Luke S.,"San Mateo, CA",477,1211,,5.0,3/24/2013,You can always count on applebees for a great happy hour .             The sangria was booomb I loved the watermelon shots an long island ice teas. The appetizers were really good as I kept drinking tho an got pretty drunk those appetizers were used as props to make embarrassing photos of me
Chris B.,"Modesto, CA",155,33,2,5.0,8/7/2014,"Great hot wings,  appetizers,  and every main dish I've ordered has been great.  Very clean,  fast service and I've never had to wait to be seated"
L M.,"Modesto, CA",0,42,19,2.0,11/23/2015,"Giving the two stars based on this specific apples bees service. (I always go to the riverbank Applebee's and get great service and delicious food. I love the 2 for 20$ deal and the appetizer happy hour!) The only good server I've had at this location is a shorter gentleman with glasses. He is so helpful and friendly! This last experience was terrible. I recently came here after work with friends because I was craving half price wings. I didn't want anything to drink but the waiter said if each of us didn't get a drink he would charge us all full price for the apps!! Company policy he said, but I've been to applebees so many times and usually as long as one person in my group orders a drink they allow us the discount! He was very rude and I could tell he was just trying to up the tab to get a better tip, which is what bothered me. So we all had to order drinks and his service was sub par. Not coming back to this location again."
Kara B.,"Sacramento, CA",353,521,739,3.0,8/17/2012,"Gettin' crunk at the Bee's! That's what we call it, at least. Where in the hell else is there to go?"
Veronica D.,"Oakdale, CA",0,14,,2.0,11/21/2015,Been a half an hour wait they told us it would be. 20 minute wait so we put our names on the list .they let a party of 6 go before a party of 7.tell me why is 6 more important then 7?! Rude staff bad service I just wanted a beer .do not recommend to anyone I'll stick to the anyone in riverbank .decided to give this place a second chance after a bad experience previous when they left our table dirty but won't be givingn them a 3D!
Angie R.,"Modesto, CA",241,15,196,1.0,11/9/2014,"I haven't been to Applebee's in a really long time, obviously for a reason. My experience last night 11/9 was by far the worst I have experienced. My friend and I walked in to the bar around 12 am for a late night dinner and drinks we were seated by the host/busser named Robert,  after us being there for a few minutes Robert came by to ask if he could get us started with some drinks, I actually wanted an alcoholic beverage but I didn't order that from him since he wasn't our server. We were ready to order by the time he came back with our waters, so he took our order. I guess our server ""joyce"" had told him he could just take care of us. Really? He's a host/busser she never came by to our table once, avoided walking by us, so I actually was happy she wasn't our server. I overheard her say she's tired of that place. Maybe she should find another job! Best believe we didn't tip her, we left Robert a generous tip for taking the initiative to take care of us. I also called the manager to tell him about my experience and compliment Robert, maybe they will move him up to a server. Well there you have it. What can you expect from Applebee's servers. I will not be Going back there anytime soon"
Laura B.,"Riverbank, CA",43,27,9,5.0,5/21/2014,This is one of my favorite resturaunts. If you want a great steak dinner fir 2 for $20.00 this is the place to go. The atmosohere us pretty nice at times unless someone is celebrating a soecial occation.
Molly N.,"San Jose, CA",2,36,,4.0,3/3/2014,This review is for this Modesto location only.  3 star food and 5 star service.  The manager is a cool cat.  Keep up the good work!
