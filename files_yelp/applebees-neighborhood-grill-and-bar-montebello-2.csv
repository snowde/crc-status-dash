Gary M.,"Montebello, CA",168,611,649,5.0,12/29/2017,Food chains are a thing of modern day society and if you go to one you have expectations that need to be met. When judging food chains I look at 3 things: Consistency: The food was prepared well and the quality was spot on for an Applebee's entrée and appetizer. In regards to the food I receive her in my multiple visits I have never had a complaint or a reason to turn any food away.   Cleanliness: Bathrooms are always clean and the dining are looks well maintained and the bar counter is never sticky. Service: The bartenders are always attentive and the servers never let me wait long and lastly my cup of water or soda is always promptly filled or replaced. So in conclusion this is a great Applebee's with quality service and I will keep coming here whenever I want sit down service at decent prices.
Karina C.,"Montebello, CA",1,8,4,5.0,12/10/2017,"I personally have never been disappointed at this Applebee's in Montebello. I almost always order the Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken. I also love the Four-Cheese Mac & Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders. For appetizers we always order the Mozzarella Sticks & Spinach & Artichoke Dip. Delicious!  We always go late so we get seated pretty quickly. And have never had an issue with a server. My daughter loves the Cedar Salmon with Maple Mustard Glaze and the French Onion Soup. And my favorite drink is the Perfect Pomegranate Margarita. Yum! My son on the other hand would probably give it a different rating (but he'll have to get his own Yelp for that). They always mess up his steak. He likes his steak a little bloody so he orders it medium rare, and every time they bring it medium well to well done. We send it back and get it a little closer to his likings. I recommend order rare if you like your steak a little bloody."
Louis G.,"Downey, CA",2,24,1,1.0,9/8/2017,"They told us it would be 25 minutes to be seated- we were seated in 60 minutes. Once seated it an hour to get our food.  They forgot one of our appetizers.  Shrimp was burned. steak was over cooked, I ordered 2 veggies and they only brought one. This is the second time we had poor service.  Too many restaurant choices to go back."
Rick M.,"Monterey Park, CA",106,17,5,1.0,1/5/2018,"Crappy service at its best. The hostess with the ""just got out of a car wreck"" face wins the shittiest hostess award for 2018... all you other crappy hostesses just quick now... she won. Asked for a few dipping sauces and got jack ISH!!! Maybe she thought it was foundation and applied it to her face. If you want crappy service with a long wait, this is the spot for you."
Anthm H.,"Fullerton, CA",126,2,2,1.0,12/31/2017,"Don't bring your family here! Come here for drinks if anything. Slow rude service! Spoke to the manager and she apologized but advised us that the food was slow because we ordered slow... she failed to realize appetizers took over 30mins to come out. We were a party of 8 and they sat a party of 7 w/ a baby so close to us that our chairs were touching, all the while them having extra couple feet on the opposite side. Sub par service sub par food mild apologies and nothing else.  Do not come here"
Jaime T.,"El Monte, CA",87,210,91,3.0,7/19/2017,"Parking:  Great, easy, free I ordered Three-Cheese Chicken Cavatappi which was 1280 Cal.  That was a lot calories for the portion.  It wasn't too much but the food itself was heavy.  So, it felt more for bang for the buck.  Total was $13.  I ordered it to go to take into the movie theaters.  It was a tightly sealed plastic container so it made it easy to transfer.  No complaints about service here. Would I go again? Yes if i was craving for their alfredo-like pasta"
Adelita V.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,127,160,5.0,7/20/2017,"I'm happy. Healthier choices on the menu, nice views, and good service. We fed 2 for under $30. Alfred gave us great service and we're off to watch a movie.  Enjoy your meal!"
Savannah M.,"Rosemead, CA",60,34,19,5.0,12/7/2017,"Awesome service from server Rebecca. We were seated quickly in a nice little booth with a great view of the city. We visited on a Tuesday night and it wasn't too pack. We just came for apps and drinks. We ordered the 2 for $9.99, we chose the spinach artichoke dip and mozzarella sticks and my daughter just got an order of fries. The dip was so delicious and they provided us with a small side of salsa. We finished the dip so fast that the server gave us so more chips and salsa for free which was super sweet. My sister ordered the pomegranate with Sierra Mist drink and I ordered three Long Island iced teas. For the month of December they're promoting them for just a $1 each and the drink was pretty strong btw for only $1 ;) Everything was great and Rebecca was super attentive and social even though we only spent about $20. We had a great time at Applebee's that night."
Oscar A.,"San Fernando, CA",0,2,1,3.0,11/4/2017,Misty was great our bartender but the food was undercooked.  I don't know if I would come back to eat here again. However Nelly the manager came and discounted our bill for the trouble
Wesley W.,"Monterey Park, CA",1204,727,10,1.0,8/26/2017,"There are very few chain restaurants that I patronize regularly.  Applebees is not one of them.  Came here Friday night because someone gave me a gift card.  We ordered the 2 for 25 deal.  1 app, and 2 entries.  It's a pretty good deal.  For the app, we ordered the Mozzarella sticks which were pretty good.  I had the 1/2 rack of ribs with cole slaw and steamed broccoli.  Cole slaw and broccoli were good but the ribs came the scrawniest pig ever slaughter.  The ribs were dry, tough, and mostly bone.  I was imagining the pig being emaciated then killed to put him out of his misery.  We also had the Bourbon Chicken and Shrimp.  This was actually kind of tasty because of the sauteed onions and mushrooms.  The kid ordered chicken strips and fries.  The fries were good.  So why the low rating, service sucks.  I felt like I was rushed out of the place.  In addition, the waiter was just plain rude.  My wife wasn't listening when he read off the side options for the meal and she asked me.  I was spacing and the water was just standing there rolling his eyes as I stammered.  I eventually just asked him to repeat.  Normally, servers jump in and are very helpful.  This one was a D--k probably because I wasn't ordering drinks and getting dessert which explains the rush job.  The ambiance is actually nice especially if you're there for drinks or watch a game.  The food is subpar and service even worse.  Sorry Applebees..but you really need to do some quality control."
Monique W.,"Lancaster, CA",0,8,,4.0,10/22/2017,Took about 30-45 minutes to be seated. But it was worth it because Brenda was a great server. She was super cool and nice! Thanks for your service!
Connor F.,"South El Monte, CA",0,6,,4.0,12/4/2017,"I went here a few nights ago.. I have never been a fan of the food or the service at this place but my friends and I were in the area and decided to grab a few drinks and appetizers... although I still didn't care too much for the food.. our bartenders were amazing! Stacy was very friendly and knowledgeable! She provided swift, excellent customer service! Will most definitely return.... to the bar :)"
Genevieve G.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,65,38,1.0,2/20/2017,Horrible do not go. Waste of time waste of money  This location sucks  We went because it's down the street from us but seems like no one wants to work there ! I told manager what's going on here - she just said sorry - food took about 45 min and we just ordered burger and salad - don't go ! Restaurant was really empty that was already a sign in itself.
Elia O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,5,1.0,6/22/2017,"Didn't care for it one bit. Sorry but Applebees is not what it used to be. The wait was okay, service was mediocre.... but the food?!well it was next to disgusting and disappointing!!"
Vivian A.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,10,30,3.0,8/13/2017,A pain in the butt to say the least.  Service is very slow and manager is useless! This place needs to go under new management & fire all those lazy ass servers! So many ppl looking for a job and w/desire of ACTUALLY doing their job.  Took 30 mins to get a drink. Food was bleh so story short? Save your time & Money!
Crystal B.,"Whittier, CA",307,55,102,5.0,6/24/2017,I really like our server Hector he is super nice  and informative. Seems like he really likes his job here The food came out right on time if anything it came out early.
Valerie R.,"South El Monte, CA",53,16,15,5.0,1/22/2017,"Even though this is the closest Applebee's to my house, I love it. Great, friendly service. My order is always correct, sometimes the wait is a good minute only because they have a full house. They are all so courteous, and attentive with their customers. Definitely underrated."
Vivian C.,"La Puente, CA",4,9,11,5.0,8/31/2017,Met a couple of friends for drinks and appetizers. Great service. Gabriella was our waitress - so patient as we decided on everything - great suggestions. Fast service. So relaxed never felt rushed. Classic appetizer combo and beef nachos - lots of food! Second visit here and the service is still very attentive. Manager checked on us to see how we were doing - very pleasant woman. We will be back.
Paola M.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,89,130,4.0,8/6/2016,"Clean place a little to loud for me but great for people who want to watch sports and have a drink. The food i ordered was pretty tasty. I had the steak salad which was a suggestion from our waitress. No regrets it was a perfect choice. I also had their french onion soup not the best but it was also a good pick to go with my salad. The waitress was super nice her name is Nicole, she has a great attitude so she made the visit pretty pleasant."
Gerri M.,"Downey, CA",214,75,66,4.0,2/4/2017,"Ate late lunch today with my boyfriend and we had a great experience! Our server was professional, friendly and just cool. The food was delicious. It was a great dining experience. No complaints whatsoever."
Jackie D.,"Rosemead, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/8/2017,"I have never had a problem with this restaurant till now. My friend n I were excited to have appetizers and drinks there before our movie but when they told us if they can see our IDs (which we gave them) the crew member said she couldn't take my friends source of ID. My friend is from Argentina so he didn't have a California state ID and she said they couldn't take it. So we asked for the manager and the manager was no help either she said because of ""new laws"" she couldn't take his ID. I work in the restaurant business and there is no law saying you cannot take an out of state or out of the country ID. He even showed her his passport and both had his birthday on it. I will never be going back to this restaurant. How dare you refuse service to my friend. And btw BJs across the street approved his ID and we had a better time there."
Mei M.,"Monterey Park, CA",750,120,3805,1.0,8/13/2015,"When a restaurant states it will be open a certain time I expect it to be open at that time. I do not expect it to selectively open its doors to only certain patrons. As was the case here. Doors were manually open to let patrons in as opposed to being unlocked and allowing all patrons to walk in on their own.  There is a nice little iPad like tablet on the table. This tablet allows patrons to play games for $0.99/game, order appetizers and desserts. Entrées can only be order through your server. Tablet also has the option to notify your server if you need them. We pressed the server button and it took a while to actually have someone come for us. Servers were seen hanging out around the hostess podium talking amongst themselves but they didn't come when we dinged for our server. After about 10 minutes another server, not our server came to ask if we needed something. That was a bit irritating. To me that goes to show that the tablet isn't doing it's job. It would have been faster to have just flagged someone down. Secondly, in observing other servers, I learned our server was a bit lacking. Other servers seated their patrons and explained to them how to use the tablet. Our sever did no such thing. We had to figure it out ourselves. That was disappointing. Lastly, food was just average. Nothing I would come back for.  Neither service nor food would ever get me to come back."
j. r.,"Montebello, CA",3,40,33,3.0,7/7/2017,"Came here, got our drinks, ordered food, got our appetizer , finished our drinks, placed empty glasses at end of table...food arrived. I thought waitress would see them and refill them. 40 minutes later still no drinks. Other waiters never stopped either. My baked potatoe was not well done either but no one to tell..no big deal...i ate it like that.Finally after we are all done, waitress stops and asked if we want desserts. We decline and tell her we were waiting for drinks and no one asked if we needed something. She looked at us and says ill get you containers to go and left! No apologies? She returned with containers and now being nice. Too late no tip for you ...i think name was Megan. Please check youre clients at least once to make sure everything is fine. You see empty glasses, offer a drink. Someone complaints..apologize and make it right. THATS IT. If you would have said sorry, i wouldnt have not been writting this. I use to like when manager would stop at youre table to see if everything was wife, i guess thats not done anymore."
Scott D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,4.0,8/7/2017,"Needed something different then the same old Westwood restaurants, so decided to take a drive. Traffic was killer, so stopped in this Applebees for lunch. The food was typical Applebees good, but the service was incredible! Thanks Hector for your attentiveness and exceptional service! Any restaurant would benefit with you on their staff."
Juan Carlos S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,9,,5.0,8/6/2017,Came to have dinner here today with my daughters we had a very great experience our waitress Vivian was very attentive nice and polite she made our dinner more delightful
Erika V.,"South El Monte, CA",47,3,,1.0,9/24/2016,Shitty shitty shitty The food was terrible The employees are horrible  We waited for our food for an hr the server didn't come by to ask if we were fine or not and one of our meals never even arrive I would never recommend this place to anyone!!!
Yesenia S.,"San Gabriel, CA",15,11,3,1.0,7/10/2017,"I came here for dinner with my kids and Husband. Was seated right away, but 15minutes passed and no one came to take my order 30minutes came still no one, I tried asking for help no one bother to come take my order or nothing. I just got up and left. Worse service ever."
Ivanna S.,"Alhambra, CA",23,22,8,1.0,12/26/2016,"Not as I expected. Having a good time coming here but getting our order wrong? Either they deaf as hell or stupid. 1 order of boneless hot wings which never showed up, 1 cheeseburger well done and a side of French fries w/ no salt. None of them came out right. They redo the burger 3x for my friend and it's still not well done. My other friend has an alergic reaction because of the salt in the French fries. That is some fucked up shit. Lucky we ain't suing them for health issues. My wife ordered a hot wings and never showed. This is a bad place to go and your order might get wrong. Be cautious on what your waiter or waitress wrote down. And the chef. They still don't listen to specific things."
Julian K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,3,5.0,12/31/2016,"So after dining in couple of places... my wife and I decided this applebees  was far better than the outbacks, cheesecake factories, chilis etc that we have been to. We came back for new years eve dinner and my.. were we satisfied  beyond any doubt. After getting a tour of the restaurant (bcus of no seats available ).. we got a table and our server, Hector M ,  took our order. Our food came out in timely fashion and we enjoyed the food. Honestly, our server was too nice and i hardly ever saw someone as attentive as him in a long time... thank you so much Hector for the awesome service and happy new years!!!"
Jonathan A.,"Whittier, CA",0,21,12,1.0,6/9/2017,The worse location ever!!! The servers are not well trained and very unprofessional. I had to walk out with my family after waiting for our drinks and never arriving and after letting someone know still no service we decided to just leave.
Bruce A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,87,,2.0,5/22/2017,"We have not been here in many years due to terrible service and average food. We decided to give it one more chance and unfortunately same, bad. Three of us arrived about 11:00pm, we had to wait, but there was only about 3 tables occupied in the dining room. The bar area and tables had many people. One of us got the Classic burger without lettuce,tomatoes, I got the American Standard that is about $2 bucks more. The burgers looked IDENTICAL.  I asked the waitress why and she said the ""fixins"" are in the meat of the Standard.  What ?????????? We also ordered salads, came out minutes before the food. We did not want to eat salad with our meal, it should have been served way before. Many many of our friends and family do not eat here and we also will not be back. When we are deciding where to eat in Montebello Applebee's is never never remembered or considered."
Mandee F.,"Raynham, MA",142,51,2,5.0,5/5/2017,"I can only speak for take out service as that's my only experience with this location. However, I wanted to say that the hostesses who assisted me on 5/4 around 7pm were great! (I think it may have been Angie? This is the only name I overheard.) All of the ladies at the front were very helpful and friendly, and the girl who brought my order out within 8-10 minutes even brought me a large water with my food and invited me to eat out front as she knew I was on my way to a movie shortly. Very nice people! 2 thumbs up for a great take out experience."
Darla D.,"San Dimas, CA",166,885,685,4.0,4/2/2017,I like Applebee's in general. This is a good location. The weekends are usually quite busy. Parking can be a bit busy sometimes. Food and service is good. I don't mind coming here when I am in the area or in the mood for the food here. I do got to say they do have a good glass of Sangria here.
Joy M.,"Laguna Hills, CA",456,821,577,3.0,2/11/2015,"I genuinely had a nice time with the boo and service was pretty good. Drinks were always kept full. The food was the only after thought. We came during a Laker game  2 for $20 deal: -artichoke dip- as per usual, solid order. Server even asked if we wanted more chips and salsa! -7 oz steak with double veggies- half of my broccoli was barely cooked. My steak was over cooked. I asked for medium rare. Didn't complain because I mean.. I wasn't expecting the best steak ever. We're not at a steakhouse so my expectations were not high. -tequila lime chicken (something like that)- he didn't like it at all. The chicken was super dry.  Conclusion? Sit at the bar and order appetizers and drinks. Proceed with caution when ordering entrees."
Nathan S.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,22,4,5.0,11/20/2016,"Had a great dinner here, couldn't be happier about the experience. All of the servers were friendly, even noticing other people being waited on. Our waiter was very attentive and was always checking in to make sure everything was good. We got the 2 for $25, both getting a steak. It was cooked just right, and the food was delicious. I wasn't expecting much to begin with but we left stuffed and happy, everything from the salad to the mashed potatoes were delicious. Won't hesitate in coming back again."
Avo D.,"South Arroyo, CA",4,6,,1.0,6/25/2017,Meals came out before the appetizer. They took the food back and returned with the appetizer. The food was then re-served 20 or so minutes later. This is my second Applebee's negative experience.  The food looks good in pictures and commercials only. I would not go back.
Victor R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,8,2,1.0,5/8/2017,"Horrible service, ordered through the curb side service, get there our order wasn't even cooked yet had to wait an additional 30 mins for my food, ask the manager named Ferre or something like that, to at at least adjust the bill, he said he couldn't do that but he can give me a dessert, lol, really??? Never ordering from here again"
Jonathan P.,"Whittier, CA",36,22,9,2.0,8/28/2016,The service was okay kind of slow not to helpful or friendly. Almost crashed into a waitress with an alcohol tray she was looking down while walking. Good thing I was paying attention. Let me tell you about my experience with ordering beer in the dining room area. So i order a coors light (it was happy hour) and it was not topped off so i asked the server why it was missing such a large portion and she said thats how they serve beer there.  I asked her if she could have them top it off and they topped it off with suds. As a person who loves having beer with my dinner at a restaurant i was pretty offended. Im posting pictures that'll explain it all. And my friends ordered a alcoholic lemonade that comes in a pitcher and said it was weak with alcohol. I give it 2 stars because the food was good i just wouldn't recommend this specific location.
Damian J.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,47,,1.0,6/9/2017,"When patron orders variety of food from barbecue, grill, or fried, he expects mostly everything to be tasty and near perfect, especially when an eating establishment has been around for years to refine their cooking.  Well, my barbecue short ribs were partly burned to blackness and dry, grilled carnitas were untasty and dry, and finally fried chicken entrees (3) were greasy and hard.  We only returned to dine here because my son wanted to--to watch the various sports.  I didn't want to further spoil my family's happiness by staying the obvious about the food here--they briefly critiqued."
Christina B.,"Bellflower, CA",0,5,1,1.0,9/22/2017,"Food is not as flavorful as it looks. I ordered my meat well done and it still had blood dripping out. All of our meals were not good, including the kids (plus it had a bug on his plate)."
