Fay G.,"Pico Rivera, CA",26,33,34,3.0,12/28/2013,Three stars for the food pretty good once it gets to your table. Service sucks they need more ppl working or better communication even management agreed with us.
Diana V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,18,,1.0,4/16/2014,Went in having high hopes from another Applebee's I had attended previously only to be let down. The food was only somewhat warm (ordered pasta) I asked for red crushed pepper they gave me what I'm pretty sure was left over pepper from someone else there was less then a tea spoon in there and half of it was dried up stuck to the sides of the little cup my boyfriends steak was also some what warm. The service was okay waited a while just to relieve cold food.
Candie K.,"Rosemead, CA",5,46,32,1.0,6/20/2013,we will not be returning to this location again. I ordered my 4oz steak medium well and it was well done. I sent it back but of course could not enjoy it with my meal. My salad was drenched in dressing making me feel like gagging. Not even a minute after getting our dessert some little boy vomited right in front of our table and it got on my boyfriends feet. The wait staff did their best to clean it up but come on! They Could have At least offered to take the dessert off my bill. Who wants to finish eating with vomit at their feet?! I got told sorry five times about the meat but not once about not getting to enjoy my meal because of vomit boy
Rich G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,1,3,1.0,12/18/2013,We have come here a few times and have had somewhat of good service until tonight. The waiter who got our orders down did only just that. After he took our order we did not see him come to our table again throughout the night. We only saw him attending to other tables. The manager was the one who brought our food out. My whole family got there food in good time and I got my side order in good time but when it came to my actual dinner I got my food after my family was already done eating. It would have been longer if I didn't ask the manager to check on my food. After asking him it took another 15-20 minutes for me to get. He came out and said that he had a new steak made for me because the first one looked old which was good but my mash potatoes were ice cold. I did receive a coupon for my wait but I'm sure we won't be back to this location for awhile. Very poor service.
Francis R.,"Chino, CA",7,35,,3.0,3/28/2014,"I am a regular at this place because it's at a convenient location when I commute home. So on Friday Night's I often stop by when I am finished banging my head against the steering wheel. I order the same thing every time, a 9oz sirloin steak because I need protein baby! Look, this place is Applebee's, the steak is mediocre. The Cosmo's are mediocre, but the staff is friendly and it's a great place to relax before I get back on the road again. And again..."
Anna C.,"Rosemead, CA",197,193,423,2.0,4/22/2011,"I went on a date here with my boyfriend. It was our first times ever at an Applebee's and we were disappointed. It was Valentine's day, but wait time wasn't too bad. We got a seat outside. Actually we were the only couple outside and what do you know? The waiters completely forgot about us. We sat there for what might have been half an hour. We were furious and were tempted to leave, but you know... it's Valentine's day and we're already here. Plus, it's on our list. BUT enough about us. My BF made eye contact with some waitresses, but they did not come out to us. That is horrendous service right there. We finally got some help when my BF waved to a waiter. He was one of the best waiters I have ever come across, so much so that we actually handed a generous tip. I wish I could remember his name.... It started with an 'E,' I think, but yeah. He saved our night. The food was crap though. Maybe it's just because we have a strong taste preference for fast food and Asian food. The non-alcoholic drinks were pretty good. I forgot what I had because it's been a while (Sorry!), but yum! Some kind of sweet tea, I think. Anyways... to compensate for their stupidity, the manager took our onion rings off our receipt, but I'm still never coming back here. Probably never going to any other Applebee's ever again either."
Michael W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",76,46,25,2.0,4/17/2014,Food was good as usual. I like the 2 for $25 deal. The riblets with the spicy sauce is always good. 2 stars because our server was not friendly and unattentive. Seemed overworked.
Melissa D.,"Monterey Park, CA",21,6,38,3.0,4/16/2015,"Bar area takes care of you but if you sit around on the outside of the bar area, service is slow.  Happy hour is cool though  especially karaoke. Still sitting in the area around the bar and no  one has come to take care of us. So sad. Enjoyed our time but service sucks."
Cynthia A.,"Montebello, CA",2,11,,4.0,4/7/2014,"Accommodating,  great Happy Hour deals and best of all you don't have to sit at the bar. Best Mozzarella Stix. Great baked potato. The servers and bussers are on their game.  :)"
Andrew G.,"Whittier, CA",0,1,,2.0,4/3/2015,"Where ever shall I begin.  Randomly dropped in with my beau on a Thursday night, to our enjoyment it turns out to be karaoke night, which is enjoyable within itself. As we look around we se a great number of intoxicated patrons of whom should have been cut off a loooong time beforehand. To our surprise, we see what could have been a drunk waitress partaking in karaoke and actually sitting at a table with highly intoxicated patrons.  Next issue, I'd say there was a 1 to 4 ratio of ""cholos"" who were highly highly intoxicated and appeared to have issues with a handful of different guests and employees.  Understandably you get this anywhere but at this particular time we felt very unsafe and out of our element.  Nonetheless. Food was delightful as always, service was good a slight negligence due to the high census (apparently) a few delays in beverage refills and initial food entry.  I definitely do not recommend coming back anytime after 9pm (happy hour)  any time before and up to you'll have a dandy time and a delightful meal !"
Natalie T.,"Alhambra, CA",22,90,242,1.0,10/31/2011,"My friends and I just came from an event we were helping out at, and we waited for probably over an hour for a table, and we were STARVING. I'm not even kidding. It felt like every other minute, someone was going ""I'm so hungry, they need to hurry up!"" One of my friends even told me there was a huge seating section open when he looked through the window while he was outside. They kept letting in groups of two or three, but never made room for us, even though we got their a hell of a lot earlier. I don't think it was until that same friend joked ""Well, they're not getting a tip!"" aloud that they cleared a table for us. L O L I've only ever eaten at the Applebee's on Main Street, and I usually get decent service and food over there. Um, I ordered the Fiesta Lime Chicken and I got the RUNS. Not once, but twice- the second time from leftovers. It wasn't until that second round of eating it that I realized that something was wrong with the food. So, thanks Montebello Applebee's. Because of your lousy food, I missed out on Halloween because I was too busy running to the toilet every 10 minutes."
Aracely T.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",4,19,11,1.0,8/2/2013,"The service is about a 3.  If you sit at the bar beware!! The managers watch you very closely, so close that you cant even enjoy your drink!  They need to ease up on babysitting clients and worry more about serving faster and correctly.  If they dont like how much you are enjoying your happy hour they cut you off!"
Haik K.,"San Francisco, CA",412,474,13,3.0,11/26/2013,"I've never really had a bad experience here, in fact all my experiences are great. The food is always great, the drinks are great, the specials are great. I always get the fish and chips and a drink or two and catch the game. Service is always friendly and quick. I'll definitely keep coming back...but in the end...its still...an Applebees..."
Sally S.,"Whittier, CA",21,3,,5.0,1/5/2014,"Went to Applebee's for dinner on a busy Friday night and had a great time. Food was great, service was fast and enjoyed the atmosphere. Our server was very friendly and accurate. Look forward to returning soon."
Sandra F.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,11,3,4.0,9/27/2014,I've always had a great and friendly experience while dining here. I would give it 5 stars but at times the wait time is over 25 minutes. Try the new wonton tacos.. Just need some siracha sauce.
Cesar C.,"Montebello, CA",56,39,14,1.0,12/4/2012,"I am a local in the city of Montebello, I enjoy spending time with my family when we can but this Saturday has to be by far the worst experience I have ever had. We came into Apple bees around 7:30pm. We where a party of 12. We just wanted to have dinner with the family, they told us the wait would be around 40mins since they where busy. We said thats fine. An hour later I asked if our table was going to be ready soon since I seen partys of 2-5 being seated and they waited 20-30mins. They said they where waiting for tables to clear so they could combine two together since it was a big family, they also said some where paid for and I asked myself arent we paying customers, I found that very offensive. After 1:18 I asked to speak to the manager and asked for the name, they immidately said that our table was ready and they walked us to the table. After sitting in the table they did not take our order until another 10min. I didnt care about the 10mins but we had already waited 1hr 18minutes, plus another 10mins that made it 1hour and 28mins waiting to get food, mind you after taking our order we did not end up receiving our food for another 15-20mins, that almost made it 2 hours that we waited to get served. The waitress was was very attentive but after waiting that long, I left with a sour taste in my mouth. I will definately not go back. THE SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE! after requesting to speak to the manager (Jim) he was a NO SHOW! the service is a reflection of the Manager and it trickles all the way down to all employees.  After reading all the other reviews I am not the only one  expressing how the service is in this location."
Anthony U.,"Montebello, CA",162,165,41,1.0,10/19/2010,"Due to the fact that there was a gas leak at the first restaurant we went to and noone felt like going very far plus the fact I didn't have to pay I didn't really care much so off the four of us were watching the fire trucks go by in response to the leak. Crowded in the main section but not so much on the outskirts or outside so I thought there might actually be a chance the service wouldn't be so bad I WAS WRONG. Plenty of staff on hand but unfortunately everyone was drunk and possibly huffing paint because as we already had waited a while and were all wondering where the food was the waiter informed us that our orders were not transmitted into t he system because the ticket machine ran out of paper so we waited longer and longer. They are soooooo lucky I had at least eaten a salad prior or I would have had us all dine and ditch that bitch it was so bad. On top of all the nonsense the waiter kept coming back around NOT taking the empties off the table and not bringing our drinks fast enough. Three people delivered four drinks all at seperate times over like a span of ten minutes ughhhhhhh. I hate the steaks here but I wanted one I ordered fried shrimp instead and regreted it. Crap came out all soggy not cool. Bad food, terrible service all the way around."
lei-ru m.,"Montebello, CA",49,28,6,1.0,3/6/2011,Never never again. This place is horrible. I guess this is where 19 year olds come to train our have failed on their costumer service. I went to applebees with my younger siblings and the waitress was rude. I asked for two milk shakes to go but she brought them in a glass cup. When I told hey I wanted them to go she brought me two plastic cups so I could do it myself. Worst place ever.
Byron A.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",42,131,17,3.0,2/4/2013,Applebee's has become my go-to spot whenever I'm in this area. It's an Applebee's so nothing spectacular about it. I usually come for the Happy Hour and half-off appetizers they offer during that time.
Gil O.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,36,135,5.0,10/13/2013,Great place to eat. Came in early with family and they check on you frequently. I would highly recommend anyone to come and enjoy lunch. Thanks.
