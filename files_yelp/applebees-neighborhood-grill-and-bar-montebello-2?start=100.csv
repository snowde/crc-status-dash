Wendy C.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,2,,4.0,9/10/2015,"The My husband and I decided to return here, for one last try.  Our two previous trips were very unsatisfactory,  rude waitresses,  unskilled bartenders, long waits for food.  What a difference.Hector is my new favorite waiter in the whole world! He was very friendly made  sure our needs were taken care of. When one of my husband many special requests got overlooked in the kitchen, he caught it, and corrected before it got to my husband.The food was very good.  Manager Julie (or julia?) was immediately at our table giving apologies for the mistake in the kitchen, and asking how she could help. The young woman at the hostess desk was very friendly and helpful. It was a enjoyable experience and we will be back."
Evelyn L.,"Montebello, CA",318,67,265,4.0,12/2/2015,"My friend and I came for dinner and was greeted by the hostess. Our first impression was not a good one because the hostess didn't bother to ask if we cared to wait for a table in the bar area. So as she walked us to a regular table in the main dining area, we asked if we could wait to be seated in the bar. The hostess rolled her eyes and said, ""ok, you're gonna have to wait"".  We let that go and we got seated within 10 minutes. Our server Rose, came to greet us promptly. She was very friendly and warm. I ordered the shrimp linguini and my friend ordered enchiladas.  Our food came at a descent time and it tasted excellent! I was very impressed with the taste of the pasta because previous times I have ordered pasta at other Applebee's locations and it always comes super over cooked. This time, the linguini was perfectly aaldente.  My grind really enjoyed her enchiladas. During our meal we ordered two margaritas during happy hour they are $3.75!!!  Rose came often to our table and made sure we were ok!  We ordered desert at the end; my friend ordered the ""sweet chimichanga"" desert; it was delicious! And I had to go for the molten lava cake which I thought wasn't as moist as I expected it to be. Over all, I really enjoyed my meal and the service was 100%!"
Marco M.,"Bell Gardens, CA",42,10,,1.0,4/15/2016,"Took 30 minutes to get just my appetizers, a couple who came 20 minutes after us received the same appetizer literally after we got ours. Im 40 minutes since i sat, and still waiting for my entry. The waitress is nice, but food took too long."
Karla A.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/12/2014,"Horrible SERVICE and management.  Waiter brought me my water, but didn't ask my fiance if he wanted anything to drink. Basically ignored him. A good 15-20 minutes pass & Waiter still hasn't came to get our order. We were starting to get agitated especially since we had our 7 month old, so our time to eat is very limited as he tends to get fussy. Manager comes and asks if everything is ok and I tell him no, we still have not been able to order our food as our waiter never came. The manager still hadn't sent anyone! Another waitress sees us getting impatient so she takes our order & gets our food out pretty quickly. As others have said, mediocre food & expensive for such simple food. NEVER AGAIN WILL WE DINE HERE!!!"
Christy M.,"Montebello, CA",7,36,17,1.0,3/24/2016,Dislike the service because of a rude bald Caucasian bartender (who was working a Tuesday night 11pm shift) I will never come back to this Applebee's and its 2 minutes away from home!
Emelia J.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,17,12,5.0,1/2/2015,Great food. Great service. Family friendly.  Just wish there was one closer to me. But it's always worth the 25min drive.
Ray M.,"Whittier, CA",0,17,,2.0,5/5/2016,"Stopped by on a Thursday night and it was busy. Service was pretty bad. I understand servers are busy and probably over worked, but atleast attempt to give decent service. Drinks but no straws, no silverware, appetizers but no plates, Order taken but came out wrong. Food was cold, probably because it was sitting for awhile before anyone got around to dropping it off at the table. I couldn't help but over hear every other table in our area have a complaint about atleast 1 order that came out wrong at their table. you can't avoid getting busy, but you can attempt to give decent service. The food was below average too. i've had better tasting food at other applebee's locations. I think this particualr location is just lacking all around."
Erica M.,"Monterey Park, CA",19,13,13,2.0,3/25/2016,"Came here for date night with my bf and decided to head to Applebee's first and maybe catch a movie. It was busy since it was happy hour and had to wait 30 mins. No problem, decided to go walk around and check up on movie times. When they took us in they seated us at a table for 8 people, which I thought was funny since there was only two of us. Our waiter was very nice and attentive, took our order and kept checking up on us and see if we needed anything else. He is one of the reasons this place gets a star and the other star goes to that quick order and pay machine they now have on the tables which we used to quickly pay and get out. Drinks: I order the HH $5 Bahama mama and my boyfriend order the BlackBerry and mint drink. When our drinks came, it was pretty disappointing. My mama had just one cherry, looked like some spilled over on the side, and weak. It was like I was just drinking orange juice. My bf drink was a lil stronger but the straw kept getting clogged up and not a pleasant feeling when you have a bunch of seeds stuck in your teeth. Didn't order anymore drinks after that. Food: we ordered the 2 for 25. Our spinach and artichoke dip took 30 mins to get to us. When I saw the dip I automatically knew it was gonna be cold with the sides looking nice and hot and middle had unmelted cheese and looked chunky. Mixed it so it would be at least Luke warm. After an hour of waiting my bf food came first which was the honey chicken and 4 cheese macaroni. I had to wait another 10 mins for my food to come in which my waiter kept apologizing and my bf food was getting cold since he didn't want to eat without me. My half rack of ribs finally comes in with a side of veggies and coleslaw. I think the best part of my meal was the coleslaw. The rib meat was very thin and my veggies were drenched in butter. The bf enjoyed his meal and I was meh on mine. We were going to order the churro s'more dessert but seeing how long it took our food to come, we didn't want to chance it.  Checked in at 9:30 and walked out by 11:30. So 2 hours we were here and didn't end up catching a movie.   It was really busy night and could tell all the waiters and waitresses were stressed and busy so I don't blame them. I think best to come here is not weekends or nighttime Happy hour."
Psycho C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,30,13,3.0,2/13/2016,"Meh... Just meh. Drinks are good.. Service is crappy.. Servers are nice, though. I was patient.. Nothing special."
Raul M.,"Monterey Park, CA",4,7,2,1.0,10/4/2014,"Let's start by saying that Applebee's  it's my favorite restaurant/bar but for sure not this one, the service is bad I've been at this location 3 times before posting this review. It went from bringing  my steak before the appetizers to being seated and waited 15 minutes till our waitress  approached us. Not to mention that she only Stop to ask me if I needed anything when I was almost done with my meal. Even though they have lots of staff the service is bad. You want good service... go to the Alhambra location they have awesome people working there !!"
Chef MG G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,72,65,5.0,2/7/2016,"Service was awesome!! Liz and Alexis are great servers very sweet and well trained made our night. Food was really good as well, love the 2 for $20 deal. It was very filling and satisfying. The manager came at the end to make sure everything was going good and he was very polite. Will definitely be coming back."
Letfaith D.,"Alhambra, CA",47,3,,1.0,3/29/2017,worst applebee's i've ever been to. my shrimp was undercooked and my cousins steak was way over cooked. customer service sucked from the moment our party of 9 walked in. never coming here again. giving 1 star because i have to. my daughter's celebration turned into a major disappointment
Ana V.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,4,,1.0,11/28/2015,"Today's service was horrible. I have never had an experience like today's. The food was tasteless, and cold. Definitely, would not come back to this location."
Eric S.,"Montebello, CA",21,73,110,3.0,1/3/2016,This is your everyday Applebee's. I thought the portions are pretty small then again I can eat a lot but still think they're smaller than average. The food is what you'd expect I mean I don't wanna be too negative but my review about this Applebee's is; its an Applebee's.
Kenneth S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,39,127,4.0,8/20/2016,Nothing wrong with having late night happy hour at Applebee's. Food was pretty good and enjoy the new look of the restaurant and the additional TV's for watching football.
Susan O.,"Montebello, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/9/2016,"The Labor Law should investigate how Applebee's treat their employees working in the kitchen. They make their employees forfiet breaks and lunchs. Work long hours, no bathroom or water breaks.  Please help these people they treat them like slaves."
Heather V.,"Long Beach, CA",0,11,6,4.0,10/15/2015,Had a good experience tonight..will be back during happy hour. Liz (hostess) was extremely helpful! Hopefully they keep the same deal for next time. Definitely recommend the Wonton Tacos!
Sandra Y.,"South El Monte, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/28/2016,"Earlier today a friend and I went to have a small dinner date, while we were there we were served by one of the best servers ever. Her name is sophia. She really went the extra mile and was always consistent with every table (including our own) and went the extra mile with each and everyone of them. Honestly, if you want a great service with a smile, I recommend Sophia as your waitress. Thank you Sophia for making Gladys's and I evening go really well."
Sandra M.,"Montebello, CA",1,14,1,2.0,1/22/2016,"Called in an order of fries to pick up and was told they would be ready in 15 mins. Got to the restaurant 15 mins later, informed the host that I was waiting, and stood there for an addition twenty minutes until I asked if they could check on my fries. A nice man came out and said he wasn't aware that I was there waiting because he was never informed. He was very apologetic, but nonetheless I waited 45 mins for some sweet potato fries to go. Definitely the last time I would come here being that the fries were ready when I got there and because the host did not bother to check on them or inform anyone that I was there."
Jose B.,"Rowland Heights, CA",65,26,6,2.0,5/30/2016,"It was a Sunday night, about 11pm and the place was really busy. They actually seated our party of 5 fairly quickly. However, once we sat down no server came by to greet us. We waited for a good 10 minutes until a woman who I believe to be the manager came by and asked us if we had been helped yet and we of course answered No. She proceeded to take our drink order. I ordered a beer and handed her my expired drivers license (it had been expired for ONE day). I also had the DMV print out in my wallet, just incase she asked for it. Which she did, now this is the weird part. She didn't except it due to the printed copy not having a picture. It matches my ID 100%. Why ask for the printed copy if you're not going to except it? Lol and I'm 32 not 22. I don't look like a baby. Whatever, I was going to let it go but the people in my party weren't so we got up and left. The lady didn't really seem to care lol. Maybe because it was less than an hour to closing time, but we had a movie to get to at the AMC next door within 30 minutes. We weren't planning on being there too long. Meh"
