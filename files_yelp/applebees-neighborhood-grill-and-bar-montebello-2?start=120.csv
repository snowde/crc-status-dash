Amber P.,"La Puente, CA",904,51,35,1.0,9/6/2015,Parking took forever competing with the AMC crowd! The inside of the restaurant was very muggy and uncomfortable. The hostess was very rude and sat us at a table that was very sticky. So we asked to be seated outside and they completely forgot about us! Sat outside for 10-15mins and nobody came to see us. And when we told the hostess about the lack of service she rolled her eyes and continued to be rude! We walked out and headed to BJ's now I understand the horrible star rating on this location where I will not return to!
Zuri H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/3/2016,The girl that's in the front taking names and the number of parties she was so rude they wanted us to wait 2 hours when down to olive gardens they took us in 10 min no wonder there's bad reviews here
Martha G.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,103,112,4.0,10/24/2014,"Great, friendly, attentive servers. All seem to be fast-paced in an efficient way. It's refreshing. Had a great experience tonight. Didn't even know that a game was on tonight (baseball), otherwise I wouldn't have came anticipating long wait times and no parking. We actually got a parking spot and had no waiting time. They had a full house and we were seated immediately. People complain a lot about the food, but must I remind you it's APPLEBEES?! I go for the one and only plate I don't ever change - the Roma Pepper Steak. OMG. The servings are tiny, as they're on the ""healthy"" side of the menu, but if you get an appetizer and a soup ... you are beyond full. My boyfriend and I are BIG eaters, and this plate is soooo good that we don't even mind the small portions. The Roma Pepper Steak is amazing - and I'm picky. It's small but thick, and I've had it a three different locations with no problem. It's so tender and juicy, and the tomato REALLY compliments the flavor. The potatos are great, simple with some herbs on them, and a large portabello mushroom filled with some kind of cheesy spinach artichoke filling. SO GOOD! For soups ... the tomato basil soup is decent, could be creamier, but it does the job. I personally like the corn chowder topped with cheese and tortilla chip strips. The soup is creamy with corn and potatoes, and it had a mild little spicy kick to it. Very good starter, especially for a small-portioned meal."
Theresa L.,"Arcadia, CA",163,4,,3.0,12/16/2015,Applebee's should consider adding Vegetarian friendly menu options. Nothing to order except a veggie burger. Even the enchiladas came already prepared with brisket in it. Wine was great tho. Especially happy hour.
Steve G.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,87,52,2.0,10/18/2015,I don't know why I bother coming to this Applebee's the hostess can't even manage the tables right ! Unbelievable!!! Do yourself a favor don't order the nacho that's almost 11 dollars they are so skimpy on the meat your better off going to Pepes and getting a bigger nacho plate with a lot of meat for 9 bucks
Rocio G.,"San Marino, CA",1,19,8,1.0,4/29/2014,"If there were a way to give this place negative star rating, I would use that option. This has got to be up there with one of THE WORST dining experiences I have ever had! I would have had a better meal at the Carl's Jr. located in the same shopping center.  I ordered some low calorie chicken entree and the description didn't live up to the actual dish. Gross and tasteless rice that was laced with soggy canned mushrooms and lets not forget the wilted spinach that was buried underneath. The chicken was ok and the only thing I ate just because I was hungry. The so called cheese pizza bread I ordered for my daughter was nothing but a soggy piece of French bread smothered in canned tomato sauce sprinkled with cheese (which wasn't even melted). I could have made a 100 time better meal at home! I don't get how this place stays in business serving the crap that they serve. The food is one step above school cafeteria food and one step lower than airplane food. Don't waste your money! When we were ready to leave we practically had to go on an expedition to find our server and ask for the check. He checked on us once and as out dirty dishes piled up they weren't even cleared away. Wtf is wrong with this place!"
Abe B.,"Pico Rivera, CA",2,17,2,1.0,4/7/2015,"I rarely give out low ratings because I usually like to spread the good word of a place that I've enjoyed. One of my pet peeves about Yelpers is handing out 1 star because they weren't treated like royalty. Because a waitress didn't smile enough or because the food didn't come out fast enough. Know where you are and where you're dining.  With that said, I'd like to give a fair warning about this place. On one trip, me and a couple of friends stopped by for a drink. We went to the bar area which was virtually empty and sat at a table. We watched waitress after waitress pass by without acknowledgement,  okay no big deal, I'm a patient guy. They must be busy, right? So we went up to the bartender and ordered our beers which he promptly served us. ""Thanks Dude"" we pay him and we return to our table. Still no waitress comes to us or acknowledges us but the manager certainly did make her presence known. In an almost a scolding manner she explained that we cannot order drinks from the bar then sit at the tables, that the waitresses were to serve us. It was so ackward even the bartender gave us a look like ""Sorry dudes. I didnt know either."" Were we depriving the waitresses of tips by helping ourselves because the barkeep got his? Like I said I rarely complain about service but don't treat people like vagabonds that came in to sully your establishment. Needless to say we left shortly after that. One a second trip, to be fair was at a different location: We had gift cards we wanted to use so against my better judgement gave it a another chance. As we walk in, we headed to the  empty bar but someone stepped right in front of us and stopped us and said they were expecting a big party and we had to sit in the dining area. Fine. Well we waited patiently, got seated and eventually were served our bland tasteless food. Before paying out our bill we noticed the bar was still as empty as before. We asked the waitress about the large party they were expecting and she said they weren't expecting any large parties that she knew of. Hmmmm not cool. Applebees will certainly survive without out my patronage but last time ever, anywhere."
Steph R.,"South El Monte, CA",0,2,1,3.0,6/20/2016,"Haven't been here in years and decided to stop by before my movie started. Won't be coming back, as soon as my dish was placed I was greeted with hair on my lunch. The manager did stop by to apologize and give us a free desert, which was appreciated. But I'd prefer to pay for my desert and get a hair free lunch."
Linda P.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,39,3,5.0,6/11/2015,The manager made sure the staff knew our movie start time so they would hurry :) I'm very happy with the customer service at this location. The bar is a big plus :) especially happy hour. Great place to stop by before your movie. My boyfriend and I will be coming back.
Vince V.,"Pico Rivera, CA",591,1310,4322,3.0,4/30/2012,"How long has it been since I ate a Blondie. A Tupac hologram would say, ""All I need in this life of sin, is me and my Blondie"" Stevie Wonder may sing about his ""Blondie Amor"" and even Prince may say this desert is the most Blondieful desert in the world. I see many low ratings for this establishment and many Apple Bees but I think it is because people come here for the food, don't! This store has very relaxed seating, dim lighting, plenty of televisions with sports on and an enclosed sense of privacy. It is very clean and presentable. I never had an Apple Bees entrée or side which really impressed me but I do like their Blondie desert. Sometimes, when I go to a restaurant I think, I am not here for the food. This was no exception, I was only here to pick up a desert, customer service was quick, friendly, efficient and my consumer experience was pleasant. Parking was decent, near 60 fwy, only two curbside spots, no biggie. The Blondie to go was not as good as the softer, warmer and moister Blondie you get when you eat inside, I took it out to go. Still, I ate it in my office and enjoyed the sweet flavor. No matter how many times I eat a Blondie I never get bored of it much like what Hi-Five thought of performing and creating music back in 1991. Song parody of Hi-Five's 1991 hit song ""Kissing Game"" All winter long I've loved your flaxen And it always taste so good Cause when I eat you You're such a good time (yes it is) And when I eat, ecstasy You make my heart beat fast You break me with your golden smile When your blonde is shown So smooth live a dove And I can't get enough  (I like the way) I eat you like I'm playing an eating game (I like the way) You keep me looking forward to Blondie day You taste so good Even better with cream My Blondie dreams Desert is our time This was not meant to be Just you and me Make me feel new So young in heart My Blonde dream come true Like a flaxen glare I love your sweet flair (I like the way) I eat you like I'm playing an eating game (I like the way) You keep me looking forward to Blondie day Yeah (I like the) You keep me looking forward to Blondie day  (I like the) Blondie day  (I like the) Oh I like (I like the way) The way you make me feel, blondie (I like the way) The way you make me feel, blondie  (I like the way) I eat you like I'm playing an eating game  (I like the way) You keep me looking forward to Blondie day I like (I like you) the way I eat you like I'm playing an eating game I like (I like it) the way (You keep me looking forward to Blondie day) I like the way (repeat till fade"
Vanesa G.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,25,22,1.0,6/21/2015,"Wow worse way to celebrate Father's Day.   We came from BJs after experiencing a horrible time, had movie tickets at 10:45 arrived at 9:45 food arrived at 10:33 an it was COLD everything app, entree worse experience worse service ugh can believ I actually tried this place again ugh"
Nancy Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,7,12,1.0,9/28/2014,"Waited for over a half hour, near the host, only to find out they gave our table to someone else! Seriously, they were like it was no big deal! Left and came to BJs across the way better service sat us in 5 minutes!"
Karen C.,"Walnut, CA",34,53,44,2.0,3/6/2015,Ok I came here one night to have some drinks and get some food. I ordered a margarita and when they brought the drink it had a lipstick mark left on the glass!! Really!!? They didn't even bother getting a clean glass to serve a drink in. I'm sorry but that is so disgusting. They made a new drink supposedly and brought a new glass but I was so paranoid that I couldn't even enjoy it lol. But really though...it was just gross.
Ann H.,"Alhambra, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/9/2016,"I usually dine out with my son and daughter once a while before our family movie night, we decided to come to Applebee's and chose to order steaks. for my daughter 's steak I specifically mention medium well but came out well done and one side burned. while waiting for waitress set our orders on the table she explain that our last order steak was accidently drop down the floor, so i had to waited another 20 minutes for my order. i complaint to the Manager, he offer to me a makeover but we don't have time to wait for food so he promised my makeover steak will be ready to go by 10;00pm for me to pickup. After movie i went back to Applebee's 10:00 o'clock, surprisingly my makeover food was not ready!! well, i will not visit applebee's ever again!"
Luis D.,"Los Angeles, CA",333,153,72,1.0,1/25/2014,Very disappointed. Maybe the last time I come here. Food was way below par. Mediocre service. Prices expensive for such simple taste.  I won't bother coming here anymore.
Laura C.,"Bell, CA",95,76,49,5.0,11/22/2012,"Rainy saturday night, it was a bit full but they said 15-20 minute wait and didn't even take 10! Staff was nice. Server was prompt with everything. We got the 2 for $20, spinach artichoke dip, chicken penne pasta and 7oz sirloin. It was all great, including the steak (delicious)."
Adriana I.,"Temple City, CA",8,4,1,2.0,2/28/2015,Asked at the desk how long the wait time was and they said 30-35min.  Waited over an hour just to get seated.
Ruby M.,"Pico Rivera, CA",27,25,21,5.0,3/8/2014,Had such a great experience tonight!  It was a Saturday so I already expected there to be a lot of people (and there was) Although I was pleasantly surprised when   the wait was no longer than 20 mins.  I had been eyeing the menu meanwhile my bf and I waited ... so by the time we sat I knew what to order.  The service was excellent! The hostess who walk us over was very humorous and our sever was very kind  and helpful.  I ordered the new Chicken and Shrimp plate... I wish I could remember the name ...it had some avocado sauce that was delicious! Oh and we ordered Mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and I had a Stella for my beverage.  The food surprisingly arrived extremely fast and tasted wonderful. Overall it was a pleasant experience I truly enjoyed how the manager walked around frequently asking how customers were enjoying their meals.  Great job :)
Maria P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/28/2015,"I went last Sunday, terrible service I order pasta and salad the waiter brought me something else. The restrooms were out of service. As I know any restaurant can't be operate with no restrooms. Never coming back again."
Lynette T.,"Los Angeles, CA",379,823,2408,4.0,10/27/2011,"This is one instance where the experience was better than expected. Two longtime friends and I got together for a Girls' Night Out and they chose Applebee's.   I had heard so-so stories and read the reviews before going last night. 2.5 star average?  Yikes. Food was good, our server Mayra was very attentive, and the atmosphere was comfortable enough that we wanted to take our time and hang out for almost 3 hours. This location seemed to be a popular place.  Most of the other tables were filled.   There were several other large parties (8-10) people and they all seemed to be accommodated pretty well.  I took note of that for future get-togethers.   Carole & Carolyn both chose salads that looked really interesting. I eat salads all the time at home and wasn't too hungry so I opted for some French Onion Soup and an order of Honey BBQ chicken wings. Loved my soup and I nibbled on 3 wings which were pretty good! (Brought the rest home for the boys to snack on.) I wouldn't mind coming back here every so often! I'm glad to be proven wrong on the preconceptions.   p.s.- Thanks Carolyn for treating us!"
