Jorge V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/9/2015,Horrible experience never going back .. people from Guatemala don't go to this place they don't he t the consular ID .. They only accept Mexican consular ID (nothing against Mexican people l) just sling that this place discriminates because both consular have the same information birth date passport number ..
Fabio G.,"Rosemead, CA",78,13,1,1.0,12/21/2013,"One star for being ""Applebee's"" -100 stars  for this location. Super empty and  after 20 min we could not even get our drinks order in. Just walked out!  This location is horrible starting with management to the employees."
Sanjay P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,10,3,1.0,1/5/2014,"Went to this location on a Sunday with family. Got seated right away. That was the only good thing. The server took our order and disappeared....we waited for 1/2 hr, tried to get other servers attention but they just walked right past our table. I know they heard me and saw me since I got up from my table to get their attention.  We finally asked for a manager, one came, we asked for our food, she said she'll check on it immediately, she too disappeared...still no food. Another 10 minutes later as we were about to leave our food is brought. It was cold, since it had been sitting in the kitchen waiting on the server to bring it to out table, guess she FORGOT! Never returning to Apple Bees EVER again.  BAD SERVICE!"
Jess S.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,120,177,5.0,5/2/2014,Wow! Food was delicious and huge portions. Yes it's a little pricey but the food is crazy with flavors.  Our waitress was easy going along with the casual server asking if we were ok.  Tgey have really pretty girls here (wink wink) for all the Single Guys lol ... it's on the noisy side so don't expect a quiet lunch or dinner ...
Johänna O.,"Murrieta, CA",122,48,40,2.0,12/10/2013,My fiance and I came to watch the Cowboys game so of course we wanted to sit by a tv. The hostess was nice enough to let us take the big booth next to the tv. Good start. Then we sat there for about ten minutes just to get our drink orders taken and thank God we ordered appetizers at the same time because our waitress didn't show her face again to take our orders until the appetizers came out. We finished our drinks twice and had to wait for refills. Honestly they didn't seem that busy and they had runners taking out the food orders so what else could this girl be doing.  I'm not really a bad review person but please make sure your waitresses are ready to be serving on their own without constantly asking for help at the register.
Marguerite M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,14,1,2.0,3/23/2016,"Applebee's happy hour and drinks are the reason I come here and because it is the most local one. I do not know what is up with the staff. Obviously if it's busy, everyone is in a rush. However, that should not make their customer service fly out of the window! The managers are always nice and go out of their way to help the hostesses and servers. But the hostesses and servers always seem to have an attitude problem."
Sexy R.,"Montebello, CA",2,12,1,5.0,5/11/2016,i have no complaints here i love applebees service is good. food is good. the spinach dip out of this world. i literally love the to go ordering when i just feel lazy and dont wanna go anywhere there it is. 5 stars and i willl keep coming here
Gracie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,70,21,4.0,6/21/2015,I would consider this my neighborhood bar. Great for a late night quick bite and a drink to whine down the day.
Ivy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",462,375,844,2.0,9/9/2011,"Easy parking. Turn into the same plaza where the movie theater is.  Decent happy hour (different specials on different days), nice selection of good ol' American food including burgers, steaks, sandwiches, seafood (& of course pastas), yummy (but expensive) desserts, and lots of awkward and close seating. I rarely order the entrees because their dishes are bland, but my usual includes any of the appetizers. The appetizer sampler (Mozzarella Sticks, Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Cheese Quesadilla Grande, and Boneless Wings) is perfect to share between two, and it gives you a good 'taste' of what Applebee's is all about. The dip for the chips is BOMB(dot)com. The cheeseburger sliders and Quesadilla Towers are a-okay, nothing special. The potato twisters looked delicious in the photos, but they weren't crunchy like I had expected. Mine came out a little soggy, and I ended up only eating a few pieces. I haven't tried too much of their alcohol, but  my favorite is their Spiked Lemonadoes (strawberry)! It tastes like McDonald's frozen strawberry lemonade with a HINT of alcohol. The beer is beer, but they charge 2x the price. Their desserts are decadent! The blue ribbon brownie is moist, served fresh and warm with generous portions of ice cream on the side. It's extremely sweet which also means it's extremely filling at the end of a meal. Worth the $$! Dessert shooters are more like mini-bites, and although they are tasty, I don't believe they're worth what you're paying. Friendly waiters and attentive service. They were always there for refills before we even asked, and the host/hostess generally tries to open the door for us when they see us walking in and out. I did notice once that when someone had asked to switch tables during its quieter hours, the hostess irritatedly waived him off, so he moved himself and left his trash on the table for her to pick up... For this location, I've come both on weekdays and weekends. I've only had to wait once for all the years that I've been coming here, and it was a bearable wait time of ~20 minutes. All in all, the food is acceptable, the drinks are average, but the prices and seating arrangements are turn-offs."
Christy M.,"San Gabriel, CA",1021,356,4410,4.0,10/28/2011,"Service was mediocre, but the portions are bigger than expected during happy hour. Hooray!"
Ernesto G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,22,13,1.0,9/24/2014,"SAFETY HAZARD/Horrible Service: Went to the Applebee's in Montebello this past Sunday and the service was horrible!!! We had to keep reminding our food server about our order. On one occasion, we asked for A1 sauce and 10 minutes past by with no A1 sauce delivered! Instead, my dad got up from the table and asked the host for A1 sauce, in which the host immediately obtained the sauce from the room right to the left of the entrance! 10 minutes after my dad got the A1 sauce, the food server brings the sauce and says, ""I had to walk the entire restaurant to get this sauce."" So what she's telling me is that it takes 20 minutes to walk the small-sized restaurant to get the ""only"" bottle of A1 sauce for the entire restaurant? The food was still warm when it came came but got cold really quick because we were eating right under the AC vent. Not once did the server come to see what else we needed. I had to call her to get napkins and refills for our drinks. You can tell that this particular Applebee's has not received a visit from the Fire Marshall in a while because they have put their customers and employees' safety at risk by blocking 2 of their emergency exits on the main floor with 2 dining tables. The only people that would be safe in an emergency would be the people sitting directly in front of the emergency exit door. The people sitting on the other side of the table would have to push the table and chairs out of the way to try to exit. Come to think about it, i would have had to do that that Sunday night if there was an emergency because I was sitting on the other side if the table that was blocking one of the emergency exits, along with my wife and my 2 year old son!!! This is just pathetic, Applebee's."
Shirley K.,"West Covina, CA",52,11,3,1.0,3/3/2016,"This is the Worst Place to eat!! Dirty an Gross! The tables feel gross!! Service is BAD! i asked to speak to the manager Julie. My server said that she was Busy an would get to me as soon as she can.. well that never happened. APPEBEES WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU??? Never coming back, theres alot of other good restaurants to enjoy an spend my money!!"
Nalleli C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,4,5.0,3/21/2016,It's the first time I'm here since they re-do the restaurants look. Service was great! Our waiter Ali was very nice and kept checking on us every she had a change. She gave us a lot of suggestions And wasn't pushy at all. Over all a great experience. Thank you Ali for making our night enjoyable.
Adonis B.,"Pico Rivera, CA",78,6,4,1.0,7/4/2015,"Horrible food. I threw up immediately after taking my first few bites of the sirloin. My gf ordered some chicken, it also was horrible. Tasted like it was sitting there for a while. Never again Applebee's. But the sriracha shrimp appetizer was good though. Not enough to bring me back though"
JC C.,"Montebello, CA",1,70,9,3.0,6/26/2015,Waitress was friendly and awesome! The food was okay. Restroom's were very dirty. Don't think I'll ever come here again.
Dr K.,"Rosemead, CA",180,663,248,2.0,12/12/2011,"Food sucked. Everyones food didn't taste as good this time around.  Also, they messed up on my bros order. Service was okay.  Atmosphere is ok. When I went to the bathroom I heard yelling in the kitchen."
Kassy N.,"Los Angeles, CA",105,8,1,3.0,5/5/2015,The only reason I have rated this place 3 stars because one the food is okay but way to overpriced. I mean seriously the appetizers were better than the actual food. The service was nice but I don't think me and my boyfriend are going back anytime soon.
Dianna F.,"Montebello, CA",2,17,29,5.0,1/31/2015,Went in Saturday around 2-3 pm we were seated promptly . The restaurant was clean and  waitress was attentive and helpful. We never had to ask for drink refills we had one waiting as soon as our glass was half full. The food took a little long but was overall good and worth it . We will be to visiting again .Overall my husband son and I had a pleasant experience . I would recommend a friend thanks Applebee's ! :)
Abel B.,"Los Angeles, CA",396,84,1363,4.0,2/2/2013,"Didn't like Applebee's a few years ago. But there menu has gotten better. Last night had the fish and chips a lil to battery and not enough fish but good anyways. Also had the house Bloody Mary I guess the bartender thinks everyone likes chilli I like them spicy but I don't want to have a glass of water to cool my tounge. Waste of the drink right? Service was quick and good also got military discount, nice!"
Gracie B.,"Chino, CA",1,11,1,2.0,4/19/2015,"The value and quality of the food was fine. With the exception of how it is brought to the table. I would think if I order a salad as an appetizer, it should come before my meal and not at the SAME time as the meal. Then our waitress Vanessa was not very attentive. After we finished our meal as well as a long wait we asked her for the check, which she brought but then once again she never came back to pick it up. Once again after a long wait my husband and I both decided to go up to the front to pay for our meal, the hostess was nice enough to track her down and handed her my credit card. Again we still waited on Vanessa, and only after I asked the hostess if she can get my credit card from Vanessa because we got tired of waiting did she come back. Felt like we were at her mercy to leave, if it was not for such an inattentive experience due to Vanessa, I could have given it 4 stars."
