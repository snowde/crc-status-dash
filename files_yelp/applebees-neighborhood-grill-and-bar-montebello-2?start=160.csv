Susan Delarosa R.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/29/2015,"I came in here today at the height of their dinner rush. Went into the bathroom. No toilet paper. No soap. Broken napkin dispenser. I go to front desk and inform the two youngsters there. I'm a coma-like state, they respond, "" ookkaayyy"" Really? ....."
Emily G.,"Long Beach, CA",281,2,,5.0,3/10/2015,"Our experience was a great one at Applebee's.  We were seated promptly,  our food was served in a timely manner. I would definitely come here again."
Sergio Z.,"Monterey Park, CA",4927,521,7192,4.0,6/28/2014,"It's been a very long time we haven't be at this Applebee's in Montebello in ages.  I remember this Applebee's always get pack on the weekend but this weekend, I thought is going to get here due to Transformer movie the movie theater is next door.  My wife and I decided to get something to eat to before the showing 11:30 showing, we got seated right away we decided get the two for 25 we both got the baby ribs but I decided to get the full rack that's $2 more.  The appiziter we order was the boneless wing  with honey BBQ we love great flavor plenty of sauce on the boneless wings then the waiter brought us the ribs wow we say those ribs look fricking awesome.  One bite of the rib I was telling myself Houston we BBQ rib problem the ribs weren't tender enough it was good but meat didn't came off the bone like traditional ribs cooking for hour let meat be tender.   Overall the ribs were very good next find a BBQ place that they know how to cook ribs one thing their Cole slaw was alright it little bit of flavor but to much French fries it like a heart attack on a plate but our waiter was good he warn us what meals to avoid that's a good warning system."
Ruthie R.,"Henderson, NV",11,30,4,3.0,1/8/2015,For an Applebee's this place was good. The service was friendly and quick! No waiting a for cold food. I applaud the crew and Manager.
El N.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,4,,2.0,5/17/2015,Long wait time for food during lunch hours on weekends.  :(  wtf happened to the portion size of spinach/artichoke dip/chips???!!!!
Izzy P.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,22,27,5.0,1/1/2015,It actually improved the quality of food. I was worried about ordering the ribs and they were amazing.the cheese sticks also perfect and the chicken and shrimp nice and juicy
Cintya P.,"La Quinta, CA",190,441,517,1.0,2/18/2011,"If you are going to seat a party at a table and have them wait for about 16 minutes and not take any notice of them until one of the the customers raises their hand to grab someone's attention, that's just absurd! That is, that's very bad customer service and a lack of communication among the front of the house staff. So that gives you a preview oh how the night began... I came here on a Friday night and it was kind of pack. Applebee's was the backup to BJ's because BJ's was packed! I was out with my coworkers for ""happy hour."" It took about 35 minutes for us to be seated and an additional 16 minutes to get noticed. I think if I had not raised my hand to get someone's attention my party would of been waiting there for an additional 10 minutes. Our waiter was not the most upbeat and looked kind of annoyed because he was working on a Friday night. He kind of rushed our orders. I ordered a ""mango margarita,"" but what I got was a SOUR TART tasting sugary slush mess.  The food did not take too long, which was great. Good job back of the house! I split the $20 dollar menu deal with a coworker. We had the boneless buffalo wings which were decent. I had the three cheese penne pasta  and my coworker had the Sirloin Steak. I had to ask for hot sauce for my pasta because it had no real flavor, even after adding some salt and pepper. The chicken, on the other hand, was cooked perfectly and juicy. I really did no dig the way they served the pasta in a mix match bowl.  Surprisingly, the manager came to check up on us for  a bit. (After a while I saw that the manager had accidentally spilled soda  at a table and completely drenched a customer.) The server did not come back to check up on us to see if we wanted dessert. He just came to tell us that Surge was going to take over. I had raised my hand to ask who Surge (since he was not there to be introduced) but I was ignored. I left a penny as a tip..."
Lisa R.,"Montebello, CA",30,22,1,4.0,12/28/2014,We received a $50.00 gift card for Christmas and decided to use it last nite. The restaurant was pretty full but the wait was about 10 minutes.  As soon as we sat down we were asked for our drink order then dinner order. The wait for our dinner appetizers to come took a while and the dinner order was maybe half hour. When the food finally came it was warm not hot. The people at the next table said the same. I had a special burger and it was very delicious.  My husband & son had the $20. Plate of chicken tenders and fries that they said we're ok nothing special. Even  the everybody was very nice I don't think we will go back.  As long as it took to get our food it should of been hot but that was not the case.
David Y.,"Temple City, CA",355,18,75,5.0,3/27/2015,What can I say about this place? I am somewhat of a regular here and always have a good time. Went here last night with my college bff for their karaoke night every Thursday night from 9pm to 12:30. A big shout out to the bartender Stacie for always makeing my visit's to this establishment a enjoyable one. I will most definately be back along with the AMC Montebello 10.
Travis C.,"Whittier, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/3/2015,"Best service ever.. Very respectful, fast, got my hole order..water..soda..apps..and my lunch in less than 35 min...awesome job guys..also gave a 50 tip..woot woot"
Bea Witching B.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,25,13,4.0,6/10/2013,"I came here when it first opened, it was horrible.  NOW, is a different story, it was busy due to graduation evening, but service was good, food was good, they were very accommodating as far as trying to get our party of 14 seated quickly. We ended up outside, but they had the heat lamps, didnt forget about us. It was a good experience compared to our first time here. Will definitely be coming back."
Girl G.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,113,46,4.0,11/28/2015,"At 1st I was debating whether I should go in because it looked kind of shabby & at a corner.  Since there were no other better choices in that plaza, I decided to give it a try.  Ordered a Salmon w/ potatoes, & it turned out to be pretty good!  Coffee was better than expected, too, w/ constant refill.  Service was good w/ polite & helpful waitresses.  This place is high-tech w/ self-pay machine on the table.  Very convenient!  There's actually a bit of a view at this location.  Would go back if there's a chance."
Alfred H.,"Huntington Park, CA",40,75,139,3.0,12/15/2014,I think this place is cool for dinner and a movie as the theatre next door is relatively small so if you get their reserve your seat then hit up the 2 for $25 to full for $15 popcorn and you can just enjoy the buzz at the theatre
Marjorie H.,"Pico Rivera, CA",10,28,9,1.0,6/28/2014,"SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!!!! I came here for the sole fact that I had a giftcard.  No one ever came to our table to see how we were doing.  Never got any type of refill on our drinks the food was OKAY (just average) if you want to be ignored, eat average tasteless food and have your time wasted come here"
W D.,"Diamond Bar, CA",25,38,19,1.0,8/2/2014,"Worst service ever! Poor service and poor customer service especially from the manager, Julie. My friend had a salad with a gross produce sticker and Julie decided to do nothing about it even after we waited 30 minutes just to talk to her. Very disappointing and you probably have better service at the other restaurants in this plaza like taco bell, Carl's jr, or yoshinoya!"
Yarira R.,"Montebello, CA",10,14,26,3.0,9/4/2014,"I like to go there with my family . Good price, good service, nice place . And near to my house. Nice to hang out with my husband and watch sports and eat. Have some good time there:)"
Almas A.,"Alhambra, CA",187,27,5,2.0,5/30/2015,The service was great but unfortunately the kitchen could not keep up tonight. I came to celebrate my new job and everything was cold and after it came back blasted in the microwave. I don't know if I'll be visiting again. They should've at least taken a percentage off the bill.  So sad.
Art Y.,"Commerce, CA",100,67,22,1.0,6/23/2014,Let me start by saying 1 star is too many. Service was horrible the food was not good at all. A lot of the staff seems very unhappy to have a job a few of them we're complaining about customers as they walked by us and our server didn't seem to worried about giving us any type of good service. If you look for a manger 2 of them are outside smoking for over 30 min ( maybe they were at lunch ) but I would think that there # 1 concern is keeping paying customers happy ( I could be wrong ) I will never go back to this Apple bees or to any for that matter - 5 stars for the place
Francis M.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,182,663,2.0,11/27/2012,"Not good this time around tasteless and unappealing. Service is ok but could be better. Dont plan on coming back for along time, food calls else where....."
Rachel M.,"Rosemead, CA",60,16,7,1.0,10/24/2015,"OMG..you have got to be kidding me!  No gift cards really! I just came here for my 5th time and sure enough I was right Applebee's did not deserve a second chance! I had a blonde culy hair (I'm a brunette ) wrapped around my tongue from my salad. I asked for the manager, a male wearing a burgundy shirt came grabbed the salads apologized and sent another manager back without returning and assuring it would be properly taken care of. Now tell me why the next management staff offers me something else and I say I no longer have am appetite neither does my husband after me gagging and spitting my food. I ask for a gift card to later return and she says they do not have gift cards. So she talks us into taking a desert and lies to us saying they have nobody working in back with blonde hair after our waiter said there was a female cook with blonde hair! How can you eat where people  (management ) lies and can't be ACCOUNTABLE OR TRUSTED! (NO INTEGRITY ) TO it all off I needed the restroom and it was completely flooded with toilet water.  This was the year after Applebee first opened that I decided to give it. Another chance as for the first few times I thought wow what a great change,  FORGET IT!  DISCUSSED AND DISAPPOINTMENT!"
