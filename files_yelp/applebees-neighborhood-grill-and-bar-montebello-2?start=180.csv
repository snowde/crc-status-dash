Regina X.,"Los Angeles, CA",260,29,10,5.0,11/17/2014,Good food :) waiters where nice food came in quick didnt have to wait too long. Love the setting
Vicky D.,"Pomona, CA",5,8,,1.0,7/21/2012,"Pshhh what a lousy ass establishment I seen a roach in my food told the waiter he was rude made me feel like I was crazy spoke to the manager what an idiot I guess you have to pass clown college to be one, he was rude and classless his name was fernadno I would never recommend this dirty horrible establishment to anyone poor service and rude staff."
Tito L.,"Monterey Park, CA",53,8,1,5.0,10/11/2013,Applebee's is always special.. Best food and service. 
Adel D.,"Duarte, CA",50,43,55,2.0,8/22/2014,"So lets begin !! Came on a Friday during afternoon happy hour pretty busy for being early only reason I can imagine why that was is because there is no other good restaurants within same complex. But there happy hour is no comparison to other chain restaurants, such as TGIF . Applebees happy hour limited menu is too limited with food & especially there beer. Ordered the two for 20 and food is descent but nothing special. Our waitress was pretty busy seen her all over the place so I guess they where short staffed which doesnt leave a good experience for a customer. The manager was nice she ended up honoring a late happy hour drink yet it was within the time, but wasnt punched on the clock soon enough so she had to approve it either. Not looking forward to coming back anytime soon."
Jessica C.,"Pasadena, CA",0,5,1,5.0,11/16/2014,Went to dinner to celebrate my sister & my birthday on a busy Saturday night. Had a great server Nathan!!. He was very helpful choosing drinks. The lady's greeting were very nice. Over all great night.
Linda G.,"Lakewood, CA",5,33,44,3.0,10/7/2014,"Food yummy. But hard to really enjoy while staring at ugly gross Halloween decorations. What's wrong with a couple pumpkins and some fall leaves, etc."
Maggie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3683,2700,11555,2.0,1/30/2010,I went to Applebee's with a co-worker for lunch.  I am not a fan of this restaurant but it was special because I got to spend time with my friend. I got french dip sandwich and french onion soup.  She got mashed potato and something else.  I can't remember what she got..sorry. Applebee's is not so yummylicious!!
Olivia U.,"Whittier, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/13/2015,"This place is horrible! Waitresses (rose) and management are so incredibly rude. The food is mediocre. I would not spend another cent at this establishment ever. Worst eating out experience ever. No customer service skills at all! Get it together Applebee's Montebello, you guys suck!"
Walter N Lupe E.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,65,53,1.0,7/11/2015,"7/11/2015 1 star and that's being too nice... the service was really horrible. Waited way too long to get our appetizers and our dinner. Waited too long for simple refills. The Waitress moved slower than a turtle... I had to go get us plates to share our appetizers. We also asked for A1 sauce it never made it to our table it was so embarrassing but I asked other customers for theirs. We were having dinner with our nephew who is in the military service and he is leaving for 2 weeks. When he asked for his military discount the waitress came back saying ""the manager said you already got a discount for ordering from the 2 for $25 and we can only give you a discount on a pepsi""??? Like serious we weren't begging for money we went out to eat because we can afford it and he asked for his discount because he deserves it!!! He was surprised but didn't say anything. Too many youngsters working here seems like they don't give a F*&^ about customer service even the manager!!! #Neveragain $103.00 bill for the worst service ever. Upper directors need to change the Management at this location."
Fern X.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,181,325,3.0,4/14/2010,"Surely anything with the word ""apple"" has to be good, right? I noticed some (or most) of the reviews of this location have been less than stellar so my expectations were greatly diminished when I walked into the Applebee's. I had previously won a free giftcard to any restaurant at my choosing for being the top performer of the month at work so I choose Applebee's since I have never tried their famous BBQ Ribblets and what a better occasion than to enjoy them at no cost. So I ordered them and to my surprised I actually adored them, though the rumor is I haven't even tapped the essence of how BBQ ribs can truly taste but to reiterate - they were free. I'm certain Lucille's has them beat by a long shot. A few things I did noticed was the overcrowded restaurant and the long waiting time to be seated but then again, you name me a restaurant that isn't filled with customers on a weekend evening. All in all, I'm not sure if I'll eat here again if it came to the matter of me paying from my own pocket but the food 'was' acceptable so no complaints there.  P.S. They no longer accept Visa/Mastercard giftcards so be warned!!"
Ron M.,"Montebello, CA",66,240,13,4.0,7/18/2012,"Some good late night happy hour deals. Don't be fooled, Applebee's is a step above Denny's, Carrows, Coco's and insert favorite breakfast/lunch place here. Would you go to any of those places and order a steak and expect it to be on par with Flemmings, Ruth Chris or Morton's? Exactly! You want beer and mixed drinks for a decent price? You want a burger and fries, maybe some appetizers? Then come to applebee's! Don't come to applebee's expecting melt in your mouth steak, pasta dishes that are out of this world or any of your must have favorite foods. You want to get your drink on? Then this is your place! You want something that's a tad better than Jack n the Box or McDonalds? Then come here! Don't complicate things Son! Late happy hour starts @ 9pm!"
Annie S.,"La Puente, CA",86,123,11,4.0,7/23/2012,The place was nice for people to kick back and chit chat. The service was pretty good. She was pretty attentative.  The food was pretty decent. So I recommend anyone who wants to kick back and either watch a game or just kick it with friends.
Chelsea V.,"Rosemead, CA",5,2,,2.0,7/26/2015,"Service was terrible. My husband and I just got home, even though it was a Sunday night it wasn't too busy there as we were seated right away. Everything the waiter, Alfred, did tooked forever. We had to wait 10-15 minutes to get anything,  including a drink refill. People that were sat after us got better service from the look of it. I mean, we even asked another waiter if we can get our change or figure something out, and all that waiter said was he'll look for Alfred for us. Finally after it took Alfred almost 15-20 minutes to get our change from our receipt he admitted he ""forgot"", but then he then didn't even give us the correct change. Every time I looked for him he was chatting it up with a girl, and he didn't even took notice of our table unless one of us got his attention even though we sat right by his serving station booth. What was suppose to be a good date night turned into frustration and regret for choosing to go here. The only thing that saved the night was the fact that the food was decent."
Antonio O.,"San Jose, CA",3,2,,2.0,4/3/2014,"Waited 30 minutes for a Coronarita. Never again. I asked three times. Also, I just don't like the food. It's cheap reheated frozen food. Its everything that is wrong with America."
Tania T.,"El Monte, CA",9,6,1,3.0,4/2/2014,"I Love AppleBees and I've always been to this one but this last time that we went the service was not so good. The server or waiter was really nice but she was kind of slow. She would forget things. That's all I can say about her but overall she was nice. The one that really pissed me off I believe was the manager. The waiter was taking to long to come around so we asked (the manager) if we could get our check. So I was like ""excuse me can we get the check please"" and this was her response. ""I'm not the waiter n I'm training him right now"" some guy that was next to her. I was like r u serious? She was very rude she could of said ""I'll get some one right now"" or something. But I didn't like her attitude! A recommendation to Applebee's, please get another manager please! That lady was very rude and unprofessional. That's all I have to say!"
Stephanie G.,"Rosemead, CA",1,17,,1.0,12/21/2013,Only because I have to leave a star.  Service is horrible. Manager has no management skills. Waiting 15 minutes for server to come while people came in after and got drinks and their food. And the place is empty. Really.. What's your excuse. Get it together
John T.,"Montebello, CA",20,25,,1.0,10/28/2015,Place sucks it's all true! Hugh turnover of staff and management because they all suck.
Sonny S.,"Montebello, CA",31,114,145,1.0,2/6/2014,"The only good thing of this place is that you're seated fast lol I have ate here three times with my gf and all my visits were the same. My gf has already vowed never to come back and I agree. Every visit I had a different server and from the moment I ordered my Dos XX It took a long time to get it! 7- 9 minutes! The first time the server didn't bring me a lime wedge and I wasn't able to request one from her because when I received the Dos XX she passed by my table quickly and just dropped off the pilsner. I drank half of my Dos XX until I was able to get the server to bring a lime wedge. The menu is pretty simple Applebee's sells burgers, pastas, sandwiches, steaks, and salads. I always ordered the Cowboy burger and I can't say it was anything special. Both of my first visits I didn't receive the burger they way I wanted it and on the third visit the meat wasn't fresh. If a manager doesn't visit your table you receive a $10.00 certificate good for the next visit. The manager does pass by but he isn't very friendly and isn't professionally dressed. All three times the same man visited my table and just asked if everything was ok. On the first visit my gf ordered her steak medium well and received it well done. The second visit she ordered the cowboy burger and received raw onions and tomato when she told the server she didn't want them and the third visit she ordered the steak again but wow oh wow it took 23 minutes to receive our plates. Her steak was nice and fresh but my plate wasn't. Plus the margaritas are weak. I wouldn't recommend you eat here."
Kim G.,"Pico Rivera, CA",175,853,122,5.0,12/26/2013,"Came here on a friday night, and we sat at the bar.  Place wasnt that packed. Service was good, as well was the food.  Good overall experience."
