Elvin C.,"Monterey Park, CA",218,269,187,1.0,7/3/2010,"More like a 1.5, but here's why: The atmosphere bothers me. The people around this area, the people that work here (the service isn't too bad actually), the food they serve, everything! I actually came here like 2 years ago or so and I remember it vividly. The place looks like a crowded sports bar, but it wasn't crowded full of people, that's just how everything is, clumped together to make it feel unnecessarily small. The food here just makes me feel like a fat redneck and I hate it. My friend told me that I had to try the maple blondie or whatever. Oh God, I felt groggy after eating that disaster. Never again. The whole existence of this place just makes me cringe."
Rosquete B.,"Belmont, CA",17,950,366,4.0,11/22/2010,"Very helpful food service One appetizer plus two entrees for $20 specials e.g., baby back ribs Nice Chinese chicken & apple and blue cheese salads Nice mini-desserts"
C B.,"Burbank, CA",1,76,,2.0,4/14/2013,"Was nearby, and hadn't checked out this location, so I figured what the heck. I probably would have been better off going to the Alhambra location. Parking was pretty awful and the restaurant was PACKED... which, I guess is good for them, that they must not totally suck? But, the crowd made it to be that most of the staff felt super rushed and stressed, and clearly overworked. I know they were trying hard, but, it seemed more times than not, we had to flag people down. The crowded atmosphere... again, I know it's Applebee's, I'm not expecting fine dining... made it somewhat uncomfortable. I'll probably just leave this as ""I've had better."" Our wait to be seated, by the way, was around 10 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. Not too bad, but again, I've had better."
Howard T.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",242,323,74,3.0,5/8/2008,"Other than the BJ's across the street, this is the only half decent restaurant you'll find in Montebello.  If you're there with a friend, just go straight to the bar. The service seems faster and better. There can be a long wait so try to get there early for dinner.  Food: I used to love their tortilla soup, but then we noticed that they were watering it down. It used to be thick and tasty.  (-1 star) The burgers are good, especially the brutus burger. Along with a Brutus beer and you'll be good to go. They have a trio meal deal thats pretty decent. I usually get the mini burgers, shrinp, and quesadilla.  Service:  The bartenders are cool. Some of the old timer servers are nice too but the noobs are quite rude and unattentive. The food wait can take forever! The bartenders make sure you're taken care of. Say hi to Rocky! She's cool.  Bad: Restaurant entrance is next to AMC's dumpster. Smells horrible and its the first thing that hits you when you get there and the last thing you smell when you leave.....horrible location"
Bill E.,"Orange, CA",98,166,21,2.0,10/6/2010,I visited this location a few weeks ago. I have only eaten at Applebee's a few times and each was decent but nothing special...  This place is just like Chili's except not quite as good. When I am in the area and looking for a chain restaurant; BJ's is very close and my preferred choice
Denise S.,"Pico Rivera, CA",119,60,60,1.0,1/27/2010,"In the words of Garth--this places spews.  Total suckage...you could hear the suckage from outer space. service sucks. food sucked--ribs were dried up pieces of jerky. crowd sucked. only reason they get 1 star is the booze is cheap...but our server sucked, so I couldn't even spend the money I wanted to."
Gee L.,"Monterey Park, CA",3,63,184,3.0,7/18/2012,"Only reason I go is because it's local.  My very first time here, the experience was horrible, but they had just opened.  With time, they've gotten better.  The staff are friendly now and if you are having specials like $20 bucks for two people, you can't beat that."
Mauricio M.,"Pico Rivera, CA",46,5,1,1.0,3/3/2013,"Very disappointing experience. My wife and I were seated immediately and our drink and food order were taken in the same fashion. The problem came when my wife's foo arrived but not mine. Since we were seated outside our waitress never came by to check on us. My wife finished her food and I still did not get my plate. I approached the restaurant manager and she offered her apologies and told me I will not be billed for my plate (which never came anyway). This restaurant failed twice, first they did not bring my food and two the manager did not remedy the situation. This is definitely my worse restaurant experience and its a shame since I had been giving this Applebees my business for years now."
Ralph C.,"Chino Hills, CA",1,4,,1.0,12/14/2009,"Ok, I've been here twice. The first time, I can't remember what happened. So i guess that means it's kinda forgettable. The second time, our waitress just ruined it. She was just really pissy-looking.  We ordered some $20 deal and thought it'd be a good idea. Not so. The food was just crappy. I had some burger that had no taste whatsoever. But I ate it. Because it was there. The fries were cold. I just wasn't happy.  Oh, and I had ordered a beer. It was in their menu. A big picture of a Sam Adams Winter Lager I've been wanting to try out. And she brings me a regular Boston Lager. She didn't understand the difference. So I told her I wanted the Winter Lager, and she said they don't have it. So I ordered a Newcastle. Later she came back to tell me that they DID have the Winter Lager... That just got me really upset.  And all the gaudy crap on the walls. Why?"
Saira A.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,16,3,1.0,12/5/2011,"So I went to this Applebee's almost a year ago with my husband and kids and I never forgot the experience, so I decided to finally write about it today.... There was a waitress named Carmen, she took forever to take our order and when she did, she took forever to bring our drinks. She never asked us if we needed anything else and when my step-son dropped his hot chocolate, she passed us and didn't offer to clean it, even though she saw us using up all of our napkins. When we finally asked her for help, she threw napkins on the table and left. I was sooo upset.. I have never had this bad of service in my life. The food is ok, but I will never return, I would much rather go anywhere else. This B**** pissed me off!! UGHH!"
Eric R.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",30,22,14,1.0,12/20/2009,"I ate thier with a friend on thursday and have been sick with stomach flu, diahrea ever since.  I would never eat there again. my friend had the same symptoms. we had the artichoke cheese dip, bacon cheeseburger, and riblets and 2 margaritas."
Vizion B.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,28,3,1.0,7/17/2015,"Went here for my cousin's birthday.  I asked where she wanted to eat at and I suggested 2 places close by. so she picked Apple Bee cause it was closer to my house.  Got there and had to wait due to business,   Wait for 10 minutes the waitress called my name  and seated us.   She says,  The waiter will be with you.   Took 5 minutes since the person came and give us the menu.  I was interested in a steak and was very hungry.  As I was looking through the menu I see no T-Bone or Rib Eye .  Just some steak don't know which part of..   My cousin said she wanted the 7oz.  steak.and the strawberry-lemonade and  I wanted  the 2 4oz steak with mushroom and onions.  As we were waiting for the waiter to come back another 5 minutes.  This place need to organize their waiter and waitress.  Our waiter had to go back and forward both side of the place,  He finally got our order.  Waited 10 minutes to get her steak first.  I told her to eat first.  She order the steak medium well.  but when it came out I told her to check if its medium well.  As she cuts it in the middle it was well done.  After one bite of it she told me it was too salty,   So she try the veges and mash potatoe it was ok.  Then my steak came in a sizzling plate.   I wonder why they do that cause I order the steak medium. The mash potatoe is cooking too due to the sizzling plate.  I cut my steak and it was 70% done.  I tasted the steak and it had too much black pepper.  If you know steaks you don't need A-I sauce.  Just salt and pepper will do.  Trying to get a waiter here is hard.  Then the supervisor or manager came by and asked how we were doing.  My cousin told about the steak it was salty.  The supervisor or manager says they could cook another one if you like.  My cousin decline.  We don't want any extra flavor on our food.  I just say my food is ok just don't want a new one with extra flavor and a waste of time.  I just finish my food cause don't want to waste any food.   My cousin save the steak to give it to her sister's dog.  I paid bill and left.   This place needs to organize better.  Waiter and waitress running around.  Late getting orders and getting the item..  Not much variety of steaks here and they are small too.  Not coming back due to less variety of steaks and small..  Other thing they need to be organize.LIke Abe said smile won't hurt..  Might have given another star for that."
Lee N.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,12,,4.0,10/22/2012,"Visited here after a tennis match.  My friend recommended it despite the bad yelp reviews.  We ordered off the low calorie menu.  I had the garlic sirloin steak (medium).  She and my wife had the parmesan chicken.  Both dishes were outstanding.  I would just let the savor the beef as long as I could in my mouth before I even started chewing.  It was that good. Unfortunately, the reviews were somewhat correct about the service staff.  They were very inattentive.  I know it's probably a min. wage job.  But, it seemed like they just liked to hang out at the reception area and chat instead of pay attention to the customers.  In other words, it didn't feel like they wanted to be there. HOWEVER, the (new?) manager seemed like he was really trying his best and we had a nice conversation as he was taking our order.  In fact, when I walked towards the restroom, I noticed him trying to get the staff back in line with a stern (not screaming) voice when we mentioned the lack of service from the staff.  I kind of felt sorry for him. All in all, the food matters #1 to us and that really made up for the lack of service."
Craig L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",3,9,1,1.0,3/16/2014,Got seated right away and it was all down hill from there. Didnt get refills and had others helping instead of our waitress. We were ready to go but had to flag down two of the other waiters for boxes and bags. Waitress would walk by and look our way but didnt check in on us. We had to wait to get our bill after waiting and waiting and waiting... Its not like there were 10 people up front talking at the entrance instead of waiting on customers... Ph yea thanks for the well done steak when i asked for medium rare! Never again.
Desireann A.,"La Verne, CA",14,16,10,4.0,7/7/2012,"Me and my girlfiend meet up here at this applebees for drinks after a rough week and t0ok the night to vent and the place was packed and with it being happy hour and karokee night. We were seated right away and since the waiter was not able to serve us the drinks because i think he was too young, the cute manager him self came over to our table right away to take our order, and the watress for the night was very prompted and courtous to constantly keep checking in on us for our drink refills and clearing our table. The manager Fernando went around to all the table to make sure all the customers were being taking care of. He came over to our table sharing good laughs well needed for the bad i was having and he was saying how he had been there since 11 am and was gonna be off at 10 that night not even realizing that it was already 1030. For a very young manager he was running a his ship top notch and everybody was having a good time with the kareoke.  Thanks Applebees!"
Karina E.,"Fullerton, CA",0,71,,2.0,4/4/2011,BLah. Everything tastes the same and nothing is really fresh.  I would only eat here if I was given a gift card or something.
S Y.,"San Dimas, CA",9,222,4,1.0,7/3/2011,"Eh... I didn't like this place.  The food is all the same.  Applebee's has the ""right sized portions"" or something like that.  So all portions are small.  It's a gimic so you order more things and run up your bill. The waiter should have just pushed us out the door.  They sat us by their wait station which was gross!!! Last but not least, I ordered my meal with no cheese, and that's the first thing that had to be taken care of.  No apologies or anything by the staff.  I'll have to pass on going to this place every again."
Maynard T.,"Arlington, TX",25,96,99,1.0,12/9/2011,food is ok. Waited for refill. Wait staff did not check on us if we need anything else. Boo on this Applebee location. C- nothing special about this place.
Rosaline Z.,"Azusa, CA",183,132,28,3.0,3/22/2011,"Went here last weekend after watching movie at AMC montebello which was literally only a few steps away from this place. Originally I just wanted to have some drinks and appetizers. After flipping the menu several time, I saw their 2 for $20 deal and I was like ""heck yeah."" Sounds like a good deal to me! So my husband and I ended up having dinner there. For appetizer, we had their fried cheese sticks--surprisingly good Main main entree was cajun flavored shrimp pasta--yummy My husband tried their BBQ riblets and fries--super tender and delicious For drinks I tried their pomegranate sangria--the alcohol was kinda weak I usually don't like chain restaurant, and I couldnt believe that I'm saying this.... But I actually love this place I mean you got the bang for your buck It's not the healthiest place to eat, and it doesnt have the best quality in the world, but cant complaint with the amount you're paying I forgot the name of our waitress too, but she was super nice and friendly On the contrary, the manager who ask how we were doing doesnt seemed very sincere Bet he's doing it just to avoid giving us the $10 coupon.... so obvious!!! boo!!! At applebees they have this thing where you'll get $10 coupon when the manager didnt ask you about the quality of the food"
Stephanie B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,27,6,1.0,1/23/2013,I went there once and was my last. All three of my friends and i got food poisining! Horrible.
