Natalia R.,"Venice, CA",26,322,224,1.0,9/18/2008,"Guess what? I won't be going to that place anymore! If there's something that I really need to see when I go to a restaurant (or a friend's house to eat)is their hygiene. Once, a kid who was eating there threw up. The parents called the waitress and asked her to clean up. She then asked somebody else to do it and said ""If I do it, I will probably throw up too!"" So the another waiter got some wet cloths and wipe it out the carpet very fast. And that was it.  Enough for me to never eat there again. Gross."
Michael T.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,65,,2.0,10/13/2008,"Its actually a pretty decent place, considering I've only been here 1-3 times.  The food is like any other applebee's of course, nothing special. Service is so-so...sometimes tends to be very packed out of the blue though!"
Police Lives Matter ..,"Greenville, SC",0,187,17,2.0,9/1/2011,The Bourbon Street steak was kinda bland.  I don't know what they did differently but the steaks are better at the other Applebee's. I would not make a special trip back there.
David K.,"San Gabriel, CA",14,118,120,3.0,8/12/2008,"Pretty decent for an Applebee's, better then the other onces I've been too. Actually this is the first Applebee's I've been to that didn't give me food poisoning. The combo type specials are pretty good, though don't expect a large dessert or appetizer with it, the portions of those kind of remind me of something you would get in a grade school cafeteria.  Like the tiny ""cup of key lime pie"", Pie in a cup? Plus it tastes more like key lime cheese cake. The best Appetizer is probably the boneless buffalo things."
Ali D.,"Tulsa, OK",0,7,,4.0,1/14/2014,Took my two small children there on a busy Friday night and surprisingly we were seated immediately. Service was great! They did mess up with our order and my soup was cold but the manager was so apologetic and corrected our order. She even brought my kids free ice cream and credited my bill. Will def be going back! :)
Michael P.,"La Puente, CA",284,44,182,5.0,7/22/2010,"Enjoy the $3 Long Island, Long Beach, Beer and 50% off appetizers 3-7 & 9-close!  The brewtus was reduced in size from 23 to 20oz"
Juan V.,"Chinatown, Los Angeles, CA",1,10,,4.0,10/2/2013,I enjoy coming to this place for lunch and dinner! It's awesome people are usually friendly service is cool. Except for today we came to celebrate a birthday and we got a rude waitress. Hopefully the rest of the night isn't ruined. Other than that I would defiantly recommend this place and I'll be coming back.
david h.,"Irvine, CA",63,15,,3.0,11/20/2009,"I had a bacon avocado burger here last week and it was pretty good. The bacon was a chewy, the avocados were fresh and creamy. Yum. The meat itself though wasn't too good. The waitress was nice and the price was pretty good, hence the 3 stars."
Ashlee T.,"South El Monte, CA",73,84,5,1.0,12/29/2012,Food are disappointing. I found lunch menu was decent. I went during dinner time with my friends but host & waiters/waitresses were rude and slow service even though they were not busy. But Asian lady works there (waitress) were really nice! I would give her FIVE STAR for her service only.
Jenny L.,"Monterey Park, CA",234,735,400,1.0,3/24/2007,"I knew there was a reason why I can't stand Applebee's. They hire lame staff and their chefs would rather pick their butts than serve up food quickly and efficiently. This particular location has proven to be LAME OF ALL LAMES today. Yeah, go somewhere else. Like Carl's Jr. in the same area. Drive thru, get one of their Chipotle Chicken salads because it's good and it's $6 and you don't have to deal with stupid people."
D C.,"Whittier, CA",0,9,,1.0,10/20/2012,"My family and I tried our first experience at Applebee's and it was a very unpleasant one. We first got seated, our orders was taken. All of our order came EXCEPT my wife's. The waitress said her food will be coming soon. Our children ate BUT I refused to eat my food until they bring my wife's food. 10 minutes passed and still nothing, 20 minutes passed and nothing. All awhile I sat in front of my food NOT eating looking angry, our waitress not even once bothered checking up on us not EVEN the assistance manager who was passing by us at least 3 times did not bother asking how we are doing.  Clearly everyone around us was looking at me BECAUSE I wasn't eating my food. We stat in the middle of the restaurant so it looks very obviously what was going on. Our waitress was just standing and talking to her co-worker. Finally after 30 minutes my wife ask the waitress ""where is our food?"", 5 minutes later she brought our food, but my food already got cold, and we told them we're leaving.  The waitress had made an excuse and blaming the chef for not getting the food out earlier. My biggest peeve about this is the assistant manger saw us and NOT once asked us how we're doing ESPECIALLY since I refused to eat my food without my wife eating her's.  NEVER, EVER, will I go to this place again."
Thomas N.,"Montebello, CA",59,46,,3.0,3/14/2009,"This Applebee's Is ok, I mean the food is.. Well what do expext from a Chain? Its ok(the food).  They used to have a burger called the black and blue, which had this Blue cheese suace that was bombay, but to my dismay they removed it from the menu and for that alone they get 2 stars.. Now the reason for Three stars is their Beer on tap.. Mmmmmm A Brewtus of Hef aawwggg!!!(Drooling on all my paper work) and that and only that is the reason they get 3 stars, and the staff is cool, some of the Waitresses are cute, but awwhhh yah not cute enough to give them another star.."
E M.,"Montebello, CA",0,50,14,1.0,7/24/2013,"Our casual go-to local place is Chili's in Pico Rivera, but we didn't feel like driving much so opted for Applebees. We've been here before when it has been crowded so we thougth the service would be better on a Monday night. No football. No special event. It was practically empty. We thought we'd get better service. We thought wrong. Our waitress play a wonderful disappearing act. Our appetizer plate arrived cold and seconds before our main meal. Refills never came and we had food on our table for over 30 minutes after we finished. I finally got up to pay at the bar since our waitress was, yet again, missing. Of course after seeing the look on my face the manager asked if everything was ok. I said that I just wanted to pay my bill so I could get out of there. Guess who appeared? My waitress! All smiley and happy to see me as if we were the best of friends! Ugh. Never again Applebee's. Never again."
wolfie g.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,388,22,3.0,9/14/2008,"All you can eat riblets- $15.99 Not worth it. The pieces are fat. The meat is thinner than the bone. The taste is all uniform, a honey bbq. Bit salty. Not fall off the bone. Gets tiring to eat it after the first plate. Not worth overindulging. All you can eat chicken fingers $9.99 comes w/ honey mustard, ranch, n bbq sauce. Side of fries, side of cole slaw. The chicken was all white meat breast w/ a thin layer of breading.  Decent taste. But not worth overeating.  Service pretty quick when you re-order though. Wouldn't get this deal again. Btw, Mondays & Thursdays now they have $3.99 boneless buffalo wings and nachos appetizers. They're normally $7.99 for boneless wings. Some NFL or sports night specials...not sure when the promotion ends"
Kelly M.,"Long Beach, CA",21,54,32,2.0,12/28/2008,"It's an Applebees, so have no expectations of fabulousness. I have to say though, I was surprised on two separate visits. I was impressed enough to go back several more times.  I had the Tyler Florence buger and it was fabulous. Of course they have since changed the menu, so it's not available anymore. I tried the quesadilla burger a couple days ago, and was really shocked at how good that was.  Overall it's a great alternative to the office cafeteria."
Davis G.,"Montebello, CA",0,14,4,3.0,7/28/2008,"This Applebee's is located next to the Montebello Town Center Mall overlooking the 60 freeway.  Not too romantic when you are seeing tons of headlights zooming by.  The ambiance was a little dark.  I couldn't see all the details of my food.  The pricing is fair.  I ordered the trio combo which included the boneless buffalo wings, an asian chicken salad with dressing on the side, and a strawberry cheesecake for dessert.  The combo was $12.99(a decent deal for a good quanity of food in today's ecomomy).  I did enjoy the buffalo wings and chicken salad but wasn't too happy having my cheesecake served in a cup(very awkward!!!)  Overall, if you want a decently priced sit-down meal, then Applebees is your place to go.  There's an AMC theater next door so it's convenient to catch a dinner and a movie with your significant other."
Lisa P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1198,1166,,4.0,1/31/2008,"I have always liked Applebee's. I would go to the ones in Fl all the time. I just happened to find this one today. I was happy. I got the lunch special. Wasnt bad, but expected more. My friend got the lunch special also, but she got more. I am not disappointed with this location. I would go back again."
Valerie S.,"La Verne, CA",0,1,,5.0,5/22/2013,"great place, new management has really made a difference.  g.m., jim is doing a great job.  keep it up."
keith B.,"Ontario, CA",0,2,,4.0,3/10/2009,"I have eaten at this location since they opened in 2005. Pretty nice place with all things considered. The food is pretty good value, the staff is always very friendly and the bartenders and management have always been out going! I understand that this is the busiest Applebee's in California, they must be doing something right! I usually go twice a week for lunch with the guys, they have specials that start at $5.99 for lunch. My wife loves the ""Perfect Margarita"" and the value of the ""Two for $20.00"" which actually is a savings of at least $9.97. My teenagers prefer Applebee's to BJ's since there is always either a loud crowd or a fight in their Bar. Applebee's bartenders seem to control the crowd quite well, BJ's needs to learn from them. Keep it up Applebee's"
Laurie t.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,10,,1.0,2/26/2011,"Two weeks ago we went in.  Only there once prior when they first opened.  First time didn't leave a good impression, second time around was worse than the first time.  I really do not think this place will last much longer.  If you go there, hope you have a better expierence than we did.:("
