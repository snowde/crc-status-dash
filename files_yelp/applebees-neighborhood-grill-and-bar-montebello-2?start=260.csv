Olivia J.,"Montebello, CA",74,364,73,3.0,2/23/2009,"I haven't been to an Applebee's in 10, maybe more years and this was in San Jose.  My husband and I were hungry last Friday night and it was already 9:30.  We figured not many places were open any more.  We literally live 2 minutes from this location and I never really had the craving to eat there despite the closeness.  Ever since Yelp came along, I review the places I will eat or going to eat before eating there.  I looked up this place and it was an average 2.5 stars so I read some reviews and it was mixed so I decided to just try it since we did not want to drive far and it is open 'till 1am!!!  I was quite shocked that we had to wait 10 minutes for a table and I was shocked even more that our waitress was extra friendly.  Everything came quick!!  We ordered the $20 combo deal...1 appetizer and 2 meals...not bad.  Oh, but their strawberry lemonade, not so good - so minus 1 star.  Overall, this place is NOT bad at all.  It seemed crowded when we arrived but I think it was due to the Lakers playing."
amy k.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,22,,3.0,6/9/2010,Food is just Ok.  Servers are more attentive and friendly during lunch hours.  Horrible service during dinner time. We had to wait long time for waitress to come by to refill my sodas.
Yvonne M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,2,1.0,1/5/2012,"My friends and I came here for our monthly ""girls dinner"" and I have been here several times before (and I actually enjoy coming) but not this time. They sat us in the corner behind a short wall and forgot about us, finally after 15 min I got up and asked who our waiter/waitress was and finally after I complained they moved us and the ""manager"" came and took our drink orders. Of course they forgot one drink (alcoholic beverage) and when I asked the ""manager"" about it he seemed to be bothered and made a face. We finally ordered after 35 min of being there, they must of changed our waiter 3 times. So VERY DISSATISFIED with the service here and wont be returning for a long time. Needless to say one of my friends called the district manager and he seemed not remorseful at all stating they were doing inventory....ok? so what does that have to do with your paying customers?  so she proceeded to call corporate and whoopie.... we will receive 6-$10 gift card which pays for half of our $120 bill that night.....I'm sticking to B.J.'s across the way!!"
Andrew D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,52,,2.0,6/20/2007,"I've never been impressed by an Applebee's.  But what can you expect from a chain restaurant, particularly one that so strives to be something different (such as pictures of the local little league, or how this location features a whole wall featuring Montebello native Edward James Olmos).  Their food was okay: not particularly interesting, but filling.  Their service, likewise, was mediocre.  It's been awhile, but I remember it taking much longer than I anticipated to receive my order.  Overall, I can't recommend Applebee's, particularly with many better choices in Montebello and nearby Pico Rivera."

George K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,,1.0,2/3/2011,"Stay away! seriously! I would rate this place a negative 5 if I could.  Me and my wife decided to go after the mall.  We got an appetizer which was good (of course its not fresh, just frozen stuff any idiot could make) The wait staff and host/hostess crew was good.  The manager seemed like a jerk who liked to just hang out at the bar.  I ordered a steak, side of potatoes and vegetables (cant fuck that up)  The steak was cold and seemed like a really cheap cut of meat. The steamed vegetables were under cooked and cold.  The mash potatoes made me throw up at the table.  I took one bite and it really tasted foul and rotten.  My wife tried a small taste of them and noticed the same foul taste.  These were also cold (tho it didn't matter at that point lol)  I managed to make my way to the bathroom to spit out the rest into the toilet rather than in front of all the other customers.  My wife had explained to the waiter about the mashed potatoes.  He could not confirm if they were fresh potatoes or flakes.  He offered to take it back and get me a fresh order but I declined in fear of making another horrible decision.  The bread that came as well was a bread stick resembling that of another crappy restaurant believe it or not the olive garden bread sticks are at Apple Bees lol  So one crappy restaurant sharing something in common with another.  Both just sharing the commonality of having a great wait staff with horrible food.  Manager was not sent over as I was hoping.  Left with a upset stomach.  Not worth the cash.  Will not return.  I know a small hole in the wall where I can get a fresh steak, garlic mash, bread and a beer in a Stine for $8 but this place isn't it.  No wonder the place was empty at 7 o'clock at night."
