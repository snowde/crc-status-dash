Chauntelle W.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,56,25,1.0,7/24/2016,"Seriously standing here with several customers other than myself and my daughter waiting for a table. They had the Audacity to tell us there are no seats available along with 9 other customers, yet clearly there are seats available. They would not serve anyone drinks, appetizers amor drinks to accommodate.  This was all said Per JENNY"
Antonio S.,"Los Angeles, CA",59,4,,4.0,5/15/2017,"Went to have dinner with couple friends before our movie started, Hector our waiter was on top of everything, great attitude, great service, we tried items off new menu and the food was cooked just right, very delicious and it was full house due to Being Mother's Day.  Being my friends and I all work for various restaurants ourselves , we all agreed we got very good service.   We will definitely come back soon."
Evelyn C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,44,14,1.0,11/14/2015,"This place is so horrible No toilet paper in any of the stalls. Service is horrible . Food took about 40 minutes plus it's the smallest portioning ever and hardly any flavor. Still waiting on the ranch after 15 minutes so I just started reviewing now.  I wish I could just get up and leave  Do yourself a favor, don't come here. Your better off at Taco Bell across the parking lot ."
Charlie L.,"Roseville, CA",245,249,273,5.0,2/4/2016,Not too bad. My husband and I used to hate Applebee's but now its pretty good for the type of establishment. I would put Applebee's the same as Chili's. You never know if its going to be great or not. My parents invited us for dinner and we really didn't  care where. Service was smooth for a very packed place. We came in the middle of the panthers and cardinals game. The waitress was attentive and so were the other staff members.  The food was OK. My parents and i had the baby bavk ribs with rice and hubby had the fried Mac and cheese thing. Would I come again? Sure if I really didn't have the energy to pick a place.
Maddy M.,"Long Beach, CA",175,160,366,4.0,9/16/2015,"Applebee's! There was never one near me where I used to live. Now that I've finally dined at one. I can timidly admit that I have been here twice this week for lunch...  One particular dine in, I had a delicious penne pasta and an artichoke dip. Everything was delicious. Service was wonderful. Maybe we got lucky with a waiter, but he sure added to our visit being very satisfying. My mango lemonade was very yummy and my boyfriend was also very satisfied with his food.  They have some great 2 for $20 deals that include an appetizer!!!  Check that out you won't regret it!  My boyfriend and I had a very fun date thanks to Applebee's and their touch screen quizzes!! We found out that we knew each other quite well and bonded as we looked over our answers.  Not only is the ambience very relaxed and fun. You can feel everyone's good vibes, I swear to you. But the bill is easy on your wallet and the food will bring you right back!!  Thanks Applebee's. I'll be back!!!"
Khanh N.,"North Hollywood, CA",91,253,79,3.0,10/31/2015,"Holding onto Applebee's gift since 2013. Finally got to use them up. They have these new in table consoles to order, drinks, appetizers, and make payments. The food is OK. My friend and I ordered the two for $20 menu and got mozzarella sticks, four cheese mac & cheese with honey pepper chicken tenders, and rib let basket. To utilize the console, we ordered the sriracha shrimp. Now that was delicious. It tasted like a honey walnut shrimp from your local Chinese restaurant yet spicy and crunchy.  The service was very dry and the food was bearable."
Paola B.,"Historic South Central, Los Angeles, CA",1,4,,1.0,7/30/2017,"We've been coming to this location for years. used to be our favorite go to place for lunch or dinner, affordable and the food AND service was good. had early dinner today and not only was the ""8oz prime sirloin"" OK but so overpriced for what we got. ordered a margarita that tasted only like lime juice and salt which also took a while  to get to the table. the service was horrible, our waitress looked as if she was not in the mood to be there (i get it, i'm a waitress myself) but at least try to play it off. we got charged for a game on the tablet that my son didn't even touch. Definitely not coming to this location anymore."
Jorge C.,"Whittier, CA",251,8,3,2.0,7/31/2016,It took  about an hour to get our appetizers and when our food came it was super cold . I asked for medium rare on my steak and it was as white as my plate. The fries were bland with no flavor. I was super disappointed with the service but the manager was very understanding and respectful. I wouldn't recommend to come to this location.
Jack M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,5.0,5/14/2017,"I don't usually write thing on yelp but today is mother's day so the place was busy and end up waiting 10 mins for a seat. I believe our waitress was named Gabriella and she was most kindness worker there as we sat at the bar side and ask us if the seat was difficult for mom to seat then she will find a seat but we sat there anyways. My mom had trouble and needed a cushion for her back, she said that there was no tupe of cushion for her and she went out her way to  please my mom with the back situation and grab a bunch of apron from the back room to comfort her...On a busy day, she took our order and kept on coming back to see my mom was enjoy everything... at the end my mom need a take home container...I could of help my mom buy she went out of her way and help my mom with the container by place the left over food in the container. We was so please how outstanding the service is on a busy day. I want to give 10 star to the waitress that service us as well as giving 5 star to Appleby in having great service in employee like we had. I recommend to all that this is a great place to go too.."
Haruko S.,"Monrovia, CA",3,24,55,1.0,5/10/2016,Really busy - took awhile to be seated. Another wait for drinks and to give our order. Worst thing? Music was blasting so high we couldn't even hear ourselves. Even the waitress couldn't hear us as we tried to order.  The table next to us were seated after us and they got their food before we could even smell ours. :(  Luckily we had nowhere to be. Except hungry - it's been almost 1 1/2 hrs since we've set foot in this place. Still no food.
Ana A.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/29/2017,"Horrible. I went through the interview process for a hostess and the main manager told me I got the job and to call back for orientation and training so I did but the employees kept giving me a run around and telling me that the manager isnt in, the schedules aren't up & I finally got tired of it and called again and an employee told me nobody hired me and gave me attitude and then hung up on me. Goodluck to anyone looking to work for applebees because it seems as if nobody has it together and they're all liars."
Elizabeth C.,"Pico Rivera, CA",43,19,7,1.0,5/1/2016,"I stopped here with my son and was thoroughly disappointed.   The service was very slow. It took 45 minutes to get our food as the waiter told us the kitchen was a bit behind in orders.   It wasn't particularly busy, so I don't understand what the stall was.   When our food finally did arrive, it was tasteless.   The macaroni and cheese lacked sauce and salt and was tasteless.   Needless to say, we won't be coming here again."
Ana O.,"Montebello, CA",0,5,1,5.0,1/17/2017,"I love eating here , whether we dine in or pick up to bring at home, the food is always delicious and their boneless wings are really good as well , my kids love their mashed  potatoes."
noemi j.,"Montebello, CA",30,28,30,5.0,9/27/2015,"I don't know why this place has poor reviews.The service could be better but you can use the little touch pad to place orders, call service and even pay bill.  Be ready to place your order when server comes, get it all in the first time and ask for double drink because you may sit dry if you don't lol The food is pretty good for what I expected comparing it to Chili's the food here is gourmet.   Also they close at 1am on Saturday and you can literally walk in at 12:55am and they will serve you telling you to place order quickly due to last call and they let you enjoy your drink and food, they don't rush you out. I liked that."
Logan M.,"Montebello, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/16/2017,Confusing how this establishment is still open with absolutely  horrible customer service. Definitely would never want to work here.
Melissa F.,"La Habra, CA",2,42,8,3.0,5/4/2016,"The food was actually really good but since I came to have the riblets and tempura green beans since that's what I was craving and they have been discontinued I was let down a bit. We had the 2 for $25 with the boneless buffalo wings, the shrimp and half rack ribs. All were really good and came out quickly.  The problem we had was the menus were dirty, the silverware was old and my knife handle was broken. But the waiters and hostesses were really nice too. So, would I go back? Probably not. Would I pick up an order to eat at home? Yeah probably."
jesus c.,"Pico Rivera, CA",131,46,34,4.0,10/22/2016,"Had a great time at Applebee's. Got there close to 11pm, of course crowds were down. Our server Carmen B. was great. Very attentive to our needs. I had the Salmon plate with fire grill veggies with mustard sauce. Enjoy there new menu options. Will be returning."
Vvvv C.,"Walnut, CA",0,20,1,1.0,6/9/2017,"The date I was at apple bees. May29,2017 time 7:00!!!! If I can give them ZERO stars I would ! Service was incredible BAD ! The waitress took our Appetizer order and she even asked us do you guys want chicken or beef and our entree order and she said should would be back with our appetizer. 30 minutes pass by and another waitress brought our food . I told the new waiter we're is our appetizer, he said oh let me go check and then he came back and said oh sorry she forgot to put your appetizer in !!!! He asked us do you guys want your appetizer still , I was like no thank you ! I order the classic burger with everything , no cheese , so when I opened my burger it was plain ... no lettuce no tomato no pickles . I seen it I was so mad !!!! I didn't seen the waitress name , i wish I did so I can put it in this review . She did it in purpose , she made it to obvious !! If she dosent like her job she should go apply some were else . It's not my fault she hates it !!!!!"
Jonny C.,"Los Angeles, CA",75,103,1,1.0,3/5/2016,"Dirty plates and place settings, food took 25 min to come out (even though we ordered off the quick lunch menu), waitress' presence was scarce during our visit, and the sorry excuse of a manager needs to go to customer service school. Most of the things I mentioned are excusable with good reason, but the manager, Michael, was simply awful.  When we brought these issues to his attention, he blamed it on a large party in the back (it was past the lunch rush), and said that we should have told him ahead of time or called in before we arrived that we had a time constraint.  He simply did not care, did not listen, and was unapologetic for the piss poor service experience. Sure, this isn't a high end place, but you can get much better service at a Coco's or Denny's even.  Save your time, money and mental energy from the frustration of this place and go somewhere else."
