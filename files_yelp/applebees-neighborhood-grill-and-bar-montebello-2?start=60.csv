Mace D.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,104,1,1.0,6/7/2017,We have been coming here for awhile now and feel its time to review this place.  Service is always pretty good.  I love the appetizers but please say way from their dinner specials. Especially the 2 for $25.  The Macaroni and cheese is tasteless and the cheese is watered down.  Definitely stay away from the bourbon chicken and shrimp.  It was just plain horrible.  Dried out chicken and the shrimp was just god awful.  The waitress was outstanding through.  If I come back...it will be for appetizers and beer only.
Sheryl H.,"Fairfield, CA",135,199,617,3.0,9/27/2016,I get it. It's football Sunday. So the RAMS get to be on every tv inside of Applebee's after I requested to watch the Seahawks vs 49ers game. No big deal. I turned my head around and they played the Colts game - after I asked if I could watch my game. Anywho! I have pros and cons. My server was awesome! She took our orders and it arrived within 20 minutes. She came back to talk with my boyfriend and I. She made our dining experience amazing. She had an upbeat attitude. I wish I caught her name! I would come back for that lady. I actually came to this location about 1pm 9-25-16! She actually knows who I was because I wore my Seahawks jersey :) but she was amazing! Downside - a couple next to me were seated down before my bf and I and they waited over 35 minutes for a sampler but he seen my bf and I have ours within 20 minutes. I had stopped another waitress who was cleaning that the couple didn't receive there food. I was so shocked and bummed out. The guy has spoke to the manager but still... That's embarrassing. Hoped I helped him out.
Clos M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/8/2017,"The worse location to go to! It took a while for the female server to come and greet not just that but we waited for our drink order and it never came out after waiting for a while . I then got up to tell another server about us waiting, and they didn't do anything about it so we walked out after a long wait. This was the worst applebees I've ever been to !"
Lulu M.,"Glendora, CA",1,7,2,1.0,6/20/2016,I love me some Applebee's....but this one has to be the worse one I've ever been to. Service was slow. Took forever just to order a drink. Been waiting a good while for food. No one smiles. Really? Step your game up Montebello.
Ann G.,"Whittier, CA",430,457,9214,1.0,10/17/2014,"Came for a quick bite before catching a movie next door and was disappointed with the food.  I know, it's Applebee's. The nachos were okay, I guess.  The real clunker was the Thai chicken salad. The man friend deemed it inedible and sent it back. The star of the show was Gaby, our waitress! Wonderful service, great personality, and very friendly. She gladfully knocked the salad off the bill and asked if we wanted to try anything else. She was definitely the highlight  of our experience."
MIchelle A.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",103,2,,5.0,10/22/2016,"Shout out to the manager tonight. Aside from her stopping by several times to make sure we were ok and everything was ok, I left my wallet at the booth and she so genuinely and kindly returned it with everything inside of it . Good karma shall be passed on to you and may God bless you and your family . She had an amazing humor and she made us laugh. The food was amazing and our server was awesome! The drinks tonight were also better than they usually are. Dined in from 3:30-5:30PM October 22, 2016. Sat at table 13."
Rizzomar ..,"Arcadia, CA",0,20,5,3.0,7/9/2016,"I ordered online 5 hours ahead of time for Carside to go. When we got there the parking spots for that were full (only 2 spots) so we didn't mind getting off the car and going inside to pick up. We were there for about 45 minutes even though we had already placed our order several hours ago! Even the long line of people waiting to be seated disappeared before we got our complete order. We were given food we didn't order, incomplete meals, and no drinks. We tried to be as patient and calm as possible in correcting the waitress/their mistakes in our order (which were correct on the receipt she gave me but not in the bag of food she was giving me) because we could see the waitress was overwhelmed and running back and forth, also it was pretty busy but our experience was a complete inconvenience and disappointment. The food did not make up for the wait either."
Patty H.,"Norwalk, CA",45,65,31,1.0,7/2/2016,"Meat was under cooked ,chicken was ruberry,mac was cold. Orders came all at different times orders were sent back  twice not good at all today... Shrimp was raw.  Today was just a bad day. Customer service was still great."
Marissa L.,"Whittier, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/4/2016,We got there about 45 min after they opened and no one paid attention to us. The building was empty and several employees were just mingling with each other towards the back of the restaurant. Eventually they sat us down but left us there for 20 minutes without drinks or even menus. We left after feeling disrespected..I will never go back to this Applebee's.
Cristina A.,"Whittier, CA",87,71,25,1.0,8/17/2016,I always love coming to this particular Applebee's server's are energetic well attentive and management is never far away. Food presentation is always very nice but there was a disappointment they are not serving crispy green beans anymore. What a big disappointment. One of the main snacks we would go there for. So I bit the bullet and tried the cheeseburger egg rolls. THAT WAS THE NASTIEST THING I EVER HAD. Everthing else was great. But they should have never taken off crispy green beans. Big mistake. I will miss you Applebee's.
Rosaly E M.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,25,229,1.0,9/20/2015,"This place is a Joke. We waited one hour even after the manager, Julie came out to speak to us, failed to inform us that we would not be getting our food even after we had ordered. This demonstrates poor management and lack of communication. I would recommend not to go to this applebee's due to their lack of professionalism and lack of customer services. This applesbee's is the worst applesbee's you could go to, they left two children hungry for an hour just because they didn't know what they were doing."
Diana C.,"El Monte, CA",100,21,6,1.0,7/23/2016,"What has happened to Applebee's over the years?! ;( Ordered a well done steak with bacon cheddar potatoes and grilled vegetables. Steak came out med-rare, FLAVORLESS! Sucks just chewing on a piece of meat that is not juicy and lacks flavor. Potatoes were somewhat still firm in the middle and also very bland. Same goes for the grilled vegetables. Pay the extra bucks and take yourself to a Wood Ranch for some real food! #TakeHerToWoodRanchSoSheKnowsItsReal"
B M.,"Montebello, CA",0,5,,2.0,5/25/2016,Long wait to be seated...long wait for food...bad service and it takes for ever to get your drinks! When I finally got my margarita it was tasteless! It tasted like ice....no flavor i asked for a replacement & to top it all off they forgot to bring me the replacement! Couldn't get any employees attention so I grabbed my cell phone called the restaurant & asked them for my margarita lol! The manager then brings me the margarita very casual and a bit rushed and asked if there was anything else he can get for us... no thank you for your patience. ..no apologies for the delays...NOTHING! I don't know what happened to this place but in the past year this place went from good to just bad.
Pat L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,,1.0,8/9/2015,"This place has the worst service and food I've ever been to. Waitresses were on us every 2-3 minutes asking if we were ready to order, rushing us through our appetizers. Then forgot an appetizer, entrees arrived wrong, fries were hard and old...  We don't recommend this place at all!!"
Joel B.,"Montebello, CA",41,61,532,5.0,11/15/2015,"They're making concessions for our large group of 16 enjoy the ambiance, food is really good......THANKX TO THE EMPLOYEES FOR TAKING CARE OF OUR GROUP!!!  I got the Brisket Enchiladas....I must say I like the rice....even though bland....not much seasoning....but to my liking......salsa was really a good touch.....the Brisket Enchilada....were....in a word......""Awesome""!!! the only negative....for me....and not really a negative.....the portions....smaller than most places.....perhaps a good thing.....I don't like leaving a place ""Stuffed to the Gills""....or leaving hungry....even two hrs lateran uncomfortable feeling! Perhaps beans,  a bit more salsa, or 1 more enchilada would make it perfect!!!     If I were to evaluate this dish on a scale of 1-10, 10 being best......I'd give it a solid 12"
M P.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/28/2017,Would give zero stars if I could. This location is the worst. Rude employees and unprofessional management. I'll just stick to the Alhambra location.
Martin D.,"Long Beach, CA",80,14,64,2.0,6/21/2016,Very disappointed food was cold and when returned very dry like it was microwaved fries were stale steak was dry no flavor and to top it off it wasn't even crowded or busy.
Lina L.,"Alhambra, CA",217,157,152,2.0,9/21/2015,"What can I say about Applebee's?! it is definitely not what it used to be. The food is bland, drinks are watered down, and wait time for tables are ridiculous as well as the service. Why we keep coming back here? Because it is the only restaurant that is walking distance to the AMC movie theater. On upside Applebee's Churro S'mores were great to end the evening"
Nataly C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,9,5.0,6/28/2016,First time coming here got seated right away great food and great service from NATHAN S
Kelly M.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,24,17,5.0,1/4/2016,"Good time! Walked in and greeted like old friends! Waitress was over immediately for drink service, wife and I had the Chicken tortilla soup, I had the Chicken Oriental salad and wife had the Shrimp Spinach salad, food was fresh, portions good, and our server Jessica was the best!"
