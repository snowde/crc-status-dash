Katherine L.,"South El Monte, CA",2,10,10,4.0,6/18/2016,Just had lunch here good deal 2 for $20 I got the riblets and my friend got the burger . Decent experience but they seem to be short on servers and depend on us to use the tablet to order and pay.
Angie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,71,34,4.0,5/30/2016,"Good lunch, perfect before our movie.. food was good, good portions and reasonable price. Place was clean just a little slow with the order .."
Lizzie H.,"Montebello, CA",12,17,26,1.0,9/14/2016,Bad food and service staff and management is incredibly rude! To top it off someone broke into my car luckily there was no damage and nothing of big value was taken but when i told the manager he looked very nervous and suspicious which is why i should have just gone with my gutt and called the cops but at the time i felt there was no point in making a report since they didnt take much and manager had offered to call me back because he was gonna look at the cameras to maybe get the person on tape and maybe a license plate to report. Yeah that never happened i kept getting the run around each time i would call to follow up or go in. Like it never happened and i was crazy. I believe he knew who did it and was part of whatever was going on. I hear a lot of cars still get broken into so be careful.
Desiree C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,3,,1.0,6/20/2016,Worst service ever! Will never come back to this Applebee's again staff isn't friendly and the wait to order drinks and food is horrible.
Patty And Sergio R.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,364,5,1.0,7/7/2015,"Mediocre at best!! 5 guest (3 of them are elderly), 5 entrees, 5 drinks $160  That is ridiculous for the quality and amount of food that you get served  Our artichoke dip and chips were so stale we refused to eat them,  Cedar salmon: miserably served about 3 oz of salmon a scoop of under steamed vegetables  Cedar chicken: scoop of rice and 5 oz of chicken  This place can shove their salmons up the ying yang  This is forever the last time we will come to a chain restaurant.  I hate to give 1 star because our waiter Terry was wonderful, he was very helpful and patient with my great grandparents"
Beatriz R.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,47,5,2.0,3/4/2015,"Well this was a disappointing experience. Came in on a Wednesday night...not many people but the service made it seem as it was. Yes, my food arrived rather quickly but the ranch never arrived for my appetizer. My bbq sauce never came...had to eat the ribs all dry and burn! Yup, the ribs were basically charcoal. Can we get this service and food together? Im paying for good quality food and not something i can burn myself."
Mark T.,"Los Angeles, CA",174,13,5,1.0,4/2/2016,This place should just become a full time bar because the drinks are the only thing that are delicious and filling! Because the food portions suck!!!! I ordered the 3 cheese Chicken cavaprri thing and the plate was a joke. They only put like three little pieces of grilled chicken on a giant bed of pasta noodles. I could have gotten more Chicken in a kids meal at McDonald's. And the Alfredo sauce was so watered down it looked like watered down milk??? The best part of this meal was the appetizers! The wonton tacos were the bomb! Applebee's needs to step it up because I think I will just keep going to Chillis.
Michelle R.,"Chino Hills, CA",46,112,70,5.0,7/12/2015,Staff here are so nice. They greet you once they walk in.. Loved our waiter Carmen B she was so nice and super energetic. Very attentive. . Food fantastic. Their boneless wings for appetizers are so good..
Alicia A.,"Los Angeles, CA",84,8,6,1.0,5/3/2016,"We decided to grab some lunch prior to our movie. Hostess sat us in a section no one was working in. In 10 min, I watched 4 servers look our way with that, ""hmm. Is that my table? Nope not my table."" look on their face rather than come and ask us if we had been helped yet. Manager and 3 servers chatted near by. Had to point out to hostess that NO ONE had come to our table to greet us and that possibly she has sat us in an closed section. She then persuaded a server who was not working that section to serve us. Finally took our order and the food took forever. It actually tasted like it was made immediately but then sat under the hot lamps for 20 min. And since our server was working about 2 section over, we were not attended to at all after we received our food. Will not be coming back."
Patrick T.,"South El Monte, CA",681,26,46,2.0,3/27/2016,"Line wait on a Saturday night: about 20 mins for a table of three. The pictures of the food were very deceiving. Everything looked so good until we got the plates. I wish we would've taken pictures of the actual plates compared to the pictures on the menu. The prices are kind of ridiculously high for a small portion of the food given. Service was ok to good. Ordered a steak, asked for medium-well. They give me an undercooked meat that would barely fill me up and I'm skinny and don't eat a lot. They also gave me half an onion. Free refills and there better be for the soda costing about $2. Wouldn't eat here again. It wasn't as good as it used to be. Either that or they got crappy chefs in the back."
Herman O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,12,1.0,1/14/2015,"Horrible service, got drench with a martini the waitress brought, she said sorry as she walked away..WTF? at least she yelled from across the room she was going to get me another drink...my steak was well done, which I had asked for medium rare...they ruined my dinner experienced, I will definitely won't be coming back.."
Justin A.,"Whittier, CA",8,50,64,5.0,4/9/2016,This place was great I went last week during happy hour 9 pm and had a blast the food was great and the service was perfect. .. I am definitely going back this is probably the only Applebee's I'm ever coming to ... and I was not a fan of the restaurant chain till I came to this location..
Vanessa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,29,28,1.0,1/9/2016,"Excuse my language but this place fucking sucks!! I'm so pissed off!! We came & waited 30 minutes for a table, once we were seated we waited another 30/40 minutes for a waiter to come serve us. We just walked out!"
Jean B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",17,253,65,1.0,3/23/2016,Seriously ... I called and they wouldn't tell me the wait time! What!? Zero stars for customer service!
Alex B.,"Monterey Park, CA",85,10,,1.0,4/15/2016,"My girlfriend and I wanted to try this place for our first time. We waited about twenty minutes to be seated. Then we waited about ten minutes for the weiter to ask what we want to drink. They brought my drink and forgot my girls drink. We try to flag down anybody to help us but all the did is smile and ignore us. We waited another ten minutes. Finally the waiter saw that he forgot about us and took the order. After all that, we waited another 40 minutes. We decided to talk to the manager. The manager was nice and offered us free food but we denied it. Its not about getting a free meal. Its about a great experience and great food.  We will never come back here again."
Carol C.,"Montebello, CA",0,6,5,2.0,4/30/2016,"Food tasted good Service really sucked!  Main food came out before our Ceasar's salad.  It took 35 minutes to bring out the Ceasar's Salad!  Come on, really?  Did they have to drive to Salinas to get the romaine lettuce?  Super slow service! Thumbs down!"
Melissa G.,"Montebello, CA",2,12,11,1.0,4/13/2016,"This place has the slowest service! I sat for a half hour after we ate just waiting for the check, ridiculous! And theres servers just walking around doing nothing...worst service ever"
Irma V.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,20,,2.0,2/14/2015,"I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in an entire meal. I can not name one thing that was seasoned or actually tasted decent. Wait, no, the tortilla chips were ok and at least they had some salt. The spinach and artichoke dip they came with, however, was runny, tasteless  and made me feel bad for the poor artichoke that gave their life for the dish. Then came a plate of chicken with grilled potatoes, mushrooms and onions. I really can't cook too many things but I know how simple it is to make grilled potatoes taste good. Butter and some SEASONING. Even some salt would help. But that's too much to ask here. The chicken was over cooked. The poor mushrooms had no taste. The plate was so blah it hurt. My friends dish was bad too. It was their mac n cheese with honey chicken. It was basically a plate of honey with some pasta in it. I'm not kidding, this place sucks. Bad. Two stars for yummy drinks and decent service at the bar."
Marsha S.,"West Covina, CA",35,14,,4.0,2/16/2015,"Was there for a quick drink and appetizers after a movie as we celebrated ""Galentines: Day and a bday.. A big thank you to the host who accomodated our party so quickly. And a HUGE thank you to our super amazing server! I wish I had written down her name. We were sitting in patio around 6ish.. This lady deserves a raise! Superb service!   Will definitely return again!"
Maria A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,6,1.0,12/23/2014,OMG   Where do i begin Had a couples night.  there was my husband and I and four of our friends.. we waited to be seated about 30 mins. The waitress came to take our orders and seemed confused when we were ordering our food. I ordered a pink lemonade and a midori sour with no ice because i had a very bad cough. My friend ordered a margarita on the rocks......... time went by and the drinks were no where to be found...... Finally the waitress brought us a midori and pink lemonade WITH a shitload of ice and a BLENDED margarita...... I told her that the drinks had to be with no ice and the margarita had to be on the rocks....... This time the manager brought us our drinks and again they were the same ones...... the third try she finally got it right. the waitress never checked in on us or anything. we had to hunt someone down to get the check. It was horrible... will not be coming here again.......  NO TIP WAS LEFT ...........
