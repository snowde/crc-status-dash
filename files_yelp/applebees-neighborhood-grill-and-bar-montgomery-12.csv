Bobby C.,"Tallahassee, FL",33,8,,3.0,9/8/2017,Went here last night it's been a while since I've been here. Had the brunch burger and was very dissatisfied. The egg on the cheese burger was all dried out including the yolk which should be the best part. I would say though my daughters 4 macncheese with honey pepper chicken was good. So maybe it was a off night for the burger not sure but if you order the burger you might request that the egg be wet
Brooke D.,"Lilburn, GA",7,18,17,1.0,9/24/2017,"Was assaulted by 3 drunk pregnant woman, and the only thing that they did was say it should have been on Facebook! Horrible service and horrible people! Still had to pay after the women ran off drunk! I'm 9 months pregnant wanted them to be respectful in front of my mother and asked them to stop saying the B word, next thing I know I'm being assaulted! WILL NEVER BE BAK!!!!"
Usha K.,"Fremont, CA",71,45,138,3.0,4/9/2017,"I have been to this place numerous time. The 2 for 20 deal is awesome. The staffs are friendlier, not too fond of their drinks."
Martie E.,"Pike Road, AL",1,38,3,3.0,8/29/2017,"We stopped in here for dinner. It had been several years since eating st Applebee's and we're looking forward to trying it again. We had the spicy buffalo wings for an appetizer. They were very good, but not as spicy / hot as we expected. I ordered the Thai Chicken Salad and was very satisfied with it. My husband ordered the grilled pike chop topped with shrimp, grilled fresh vegetables, & steamed broccoli. It was very good. Our server was very good, asked about refilling our sparkling water without been no prompted by us. He was courteous & efficient without hovering. We will return again."
RC T.,"Montgomery, AL",8,115,86,4.0,8/28/2017,I bought carry out. The food wasn't done at the time they had given.  The waitress who bought it out was great.  The food was hot and as expected when I got home.
Antionette G.,"Montgomery, AL",17,25,1,4.0,5/11/2017,The appetizers are good I don't usually come here to eat full course meals just something light. I went one night when it was karaoke night and I could've sworn I was at club rose. I was confused but full. So  just go for the food . lol
Robin L.,"Montgomery, AL",24,9,,4.0,6/18/2017,"I was pleasantly surprised by our experience. We haven't been to an Applebee's in years and I'm so glad we tried it again. The service was impeccable, the food was delicious. We will definitely be back."
Votie M.,"Enterprise, AL",0,123,11,4.0,2/16/2017,Went there for lunch and had the fajita wrap lunch special.  It came with fries.  Everything was very good including the service.
Morgan J.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",0,8,,2.0,1/29/2017,The music was blasting when we walked in it felt like a club. When the host sat us directly under a speaker I asked if we could be sat somewhere farther from the speaker. The host said no we will just turn the music down. The host did not turn the music down. The only reason I couldn't give it one star was because our waiter tried his best. When I asked him to turn the music down he did. Right as he was back at out table to take our order the music was blasting yet again however they changed the genre to Adel and Taylor Swift (maybe thinking we'd like it better?) but that's not what I asked I wanted quieter music doesn't matter what type is played. Every time our waiter tried to get the music turned down someone turned it right back up again. It was a very uncomfortable experience. Not worth the trouble.
Stephanie P.,"Montgomery, AL",0,12,4,3.0,7/13/2015,This location can sometimes be hit or miss on service. On food there is usually great. They have one of the best cheeseburgers around. Very crispy and they use a thick bacon. Fries have always been great here too.
Nathan C.,"Montgomery, AL",1,4,1,1.0,5/11/2015,"The service was excellent, however the food was dreadful. There were only grille marks on the top, I asked for my steak medium well, but it was cooked all the way. It was tough, and chewy, seemed to be microwaved, and had no juice. The fries were good, and the boneless wings were fine. Over all the food is bad. Don't come here unless you are planning on buying doggie treats."
Jerry S.,"Wetumpka, AL",3,11,1,3.0,3/5/2015,"The food was as typical for Applebee's, not great or horrible. The service was pleasant enough. A couple things I would change:  If the service staff is going to eat and/or socialize, I wouldn't let them do it amongst the customers. I would have the wait staff be more knowledgeable about the menu, meaning that, I asked what a 'Brewtus' was and got a mumbled response regarding the drink menu. Also, I never got asked 'How is everything' or anything close to that, by anyone."
Kiana R.,"Roswell, GA",2,4,,1.0,7/3/2014,Went in got seated immediately .... server came to our table finally she could not answer any questions about the food .....my server brought my food to my table with the same hands that she wiped snot off her nose spoke with David the manner he was rude and the whole experience was awful bathrooms were Disgusting never eating there again
Marlon S.,"Springfield, VA",9,48,,1.0,3/2/2013,"Walked in and waited 30 minutes, but there were at least 8 empty tables. Half the tables were dirty the entire wait. Once seated it took forever to get silverware and orders taken. 10 minutes after orders were taken, was informed that they were out of soup. Once food and drinks arrived, drinks were watered down and no one liked their dish. Serve checked on us only once after food was delivered. Total embarrassing experience. Total time 2 hours. Health department score was in the 80s. You cannot see the score unless you are leaving the restaurant. Do not recommended this location for any reason."
