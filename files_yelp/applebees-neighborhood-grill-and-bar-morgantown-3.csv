Tim S.,"Burke, VA",20,7,,4.0,8/12/2017,"Very good Applebees, clean,  friendly and attentive staff. I ordered the steak salad, the was cooked to perfect medium and was served within 15 minutes of ordering our meal."
David B.,"Morgantown, WV",0,57,88,2.0,12/13/2017,I do not plan to go to this Applebee's again. The steak was not good and and replacement hamburger was dry and unappealing. The potato thingy was like glue.
David S.,"Pearland, TX",0,10,2,5.0,4/22/2017,Ate there tonight. Food was good with nice staff. My daughter left her purse and they had put it in their safe. Over $300 in it as well as a lot of other valuables. Great experience in every way!
Brendan B.,"Atlantic Highlands, NJ",20,74,97,5.0,11/8/2015,Your average Applebee's.  Normal service vice you would expect at an Applebee's but I honk this one does good ticket times in food and food comes out in a very timely manner.  It gets slot of its business from the hotel right next door
John M.,"Miami, FL",0,29,,4.0,4/15/2016,Redid the menu and love it now. Tacos and blue cheese wedge is great! This has become a place I actually want to go eat at now. Lunch and dinner both. Drinks usually good too.
Jamie P.,"Washington, DC",17,170,16,3.0,10/7/2015,"next to our hotel, easy pick! views of tvs around the restaurant and actually a totally decent burger! Great service by our waitress. Trivia night left a lot to be desired... but we were there for food and football :)"
S M.,"Morgantown, WV",51,5,1,2.0,6/26/2016,"I ordered carside to go from here.   I ordered a steak and baked potato and broccoli.  I ordered my steak rare.  They told me 15 minutes.  I got to the parking lot and I waited.  Then a girl came out and said that she was sorry but the kitchen just told her that they were out of baked potatoes.  This was at 7:50 at night and they close at midnight. When I called they told me 15 mins.  I waited 40 minutes.  They steak came out medium well.  Not rare.  Not even medium rare.  It came out medium well. The manager who brought it out said ""i see pink"".  I said are you kidding.  It is cooked.  There is no pink. And rare shouldn't even be pink.  It should be red with red juice (blood) running out of it.  He just said It was rang in as rare.  I sat there in awe thinking are you kidding me?   It does not matter how it was rang in, it was waaayyyy over cooked.  I gave them back the steak and asked for my money back.  I then called Longhorn steakhouse and ordered as I should've done in the first place.    I will never try to get steak at Applebees again.  Big mistake."
Scott I.,"Martinsburg, WV",0,2,,1.0,6/27/2015,"The only thing this restaurant chain is halfway good for is its drinks and appetizers. The entrees were loaded with salt. All I can say about the steak I ordered is bizarre! It sort of looked like steak, but the texture and taste were way off. It almost tasted like ham in some weird way. This is the first time in several years that I've eaten at Applebee's and it reminds me why it's been several years. Note to self, never again!"
Adam B.,"Morgantown, WV",59,37,4,1.0,6/26/2012,One star for a great happy hour drink special but otherwise it's your normal chain food.  Too many local options to even consider this nightmare.
Charles W.,"West Chester, PA",3,6,,3.0,12/12/2012,"We stopped for dinner on November 24, 2012 after visiting the Ronald McDonald House nearby.  Good food.  The staff sure asked us if things were alright - perhaps a few too many times.  But, I guess that's good."
Janet F.,"Morgantown, WV",29,197,,2.0,1/6/2011,"I should have some endearing thoughts toward Applebee's. I met my spouse at one. I used to go to EMS happy hours at another one. But wow, the food is bland at best and the service at this one is just slow. We were the only group in the restaurant and it still took forever for the five of us to order and get our food."
Amanda D.,"Morgantown, WV",3,20,,2.0,6/25/2008,"The food is fine, but the last couple times I've been their the service has been extremely sloooow. It wasn't even like when I went it was really crowded, but there were very few people in there. I would just go somewhere else because you can get like the same kinda stuff at other chain restaurants that are all over Morgantown."
