Adam S.,"Vallejo, CA",21,3,,5.0,8/5/2017,As long as Jordan is my bartender everything is great because she makes sure of it. She always checks to see if our food is good and makes sure it comes out in a timely manner. It's service like that is why Iam a return customer here
Jordan W.,"San Francisco, CA",45,12,6,1.0,9/29/2017,"This was the absolute worst dinner I've ever had here at Applebee's. I'll start off right away by saying that we didn't even get our appetizers, we waited and waited and finally our entrees come out and we're sitting there with a dumbfounded look on our face... So what about our appetizers? Next my wife bit in to her dinner and she deliberately stated that she didn't want any spice, her whole meal was covered in spice, she couldn't even eat it without feeling sick. My food was good enough, but the mashed potatoes were cold and she didn't even bring steak sauce. Finally we told the manager and she did nothing, she was rude and disrespectful, so we asked to talk to the General Manager Clemente... He was far worse! He didn't do anything except stand there and say. ""I don't know what to tell you"" our entire meal should have been compensated for such a blatantly disgusting use of customer service.  Steer clear of Applebees, you can always go just a bit further into American Canyon or Vallejo and find something there. It's not worth it coming here!"
Lily W.,"Napa, CA",110,172,34,3.0,11/30/2017,"Often quite busy in the late evenings (when many other local spots are closed or about to close), there's usually at least a moderate wait to be seated.  On weekdays, there seems to be a shortage of servers since there are usually plenty of tables open, but the line by the door is still pretty long.  Food and service is average as expected of a chain restaurant, but the servers are always polite!  Restaurant is clean with an abundant menu available.  I often crave the spinach-artichoke dip, which is admittedly quite salty, but it hits the spot! It's a reliable place to go for a no-frills late night dinner."
Skank H.,"Napa, CA",0,12,,1.0,12/11/2017,"Don't buy appetizers if you don't like them to be thawed out and unfrozen prior to eating them . Utensils and plates came with water from the dishwasher still on them . Unaware if they had any cleaning agents on them . Had to wait 30 mins to get one entree dish redone because of that .  If you like real spirits DONT come here they look and are artificially colored . Stick to rum and coke, gin and juice , ETC burgers are done well rare when you ask for well done anougher time we came here . Never coming back again ..."
Cynthia L.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",21,4,,2.0,11/19/2017,"Food was good. Brownie bite was outstanding. Service was mediocre at best. Food came before or salad and appetizer. Our server seemed distracted and somewhat overwhelmed. If the restaurant had been busy I could understand her inattentiveness. However, it was very quiet for a late afternoon Sunday lunch. Very disappointing."
Mary V.,"Stockton, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/25/2017,Hi my family and friends all enjoy applebees  However tonight we went to Applebee's in Napa CA. and we're disappointed. We took our 17 yr old out so they can si g happy birthday to her. The waitress was kind enough and brought an ice cream Sunday but was sorry to say her manager doesn't  allow time to sing happy birthday anymore. I told her that's why we came here tonight the applebees in other cities still do so. She brought over the ice cream and sang with us. Great waitress poor manager customer service ! Don't go if you want to be sung to too celebrate your bday!!
Douglas B.,"Murrieta, CA",0,65,6,5.0,11/13/2017,Went too this Applebees on veterans day with a group of four. Three of which were veterans. They gave us three free meals from a special menu without any question. The service was great and the food was delicious! I was really impressed and felt appreciated.
Caroline S.,"Napa, CA",1,18,4,1.0,10/21/2017,"Last weekend we were seated a party of 5 asked for drinks, wine and sangrias.  We decided we wanted a shot so got up went to the bar as the manager came to our table we went back to our tables to get our id's the manager informed us we are only allowed three drinks and that if were bothered with our service since we got up to go get our shots.  How is that even a thing.  Paid our check and left."
Connie B.,"Napa, CA",19,19,2,1.0,4/21/2017,Today we had the worse service ever in my memory. Not busy at all. Servers hanging around  Talking. Ordered food and waited for 50 min. Called for the manager. She said it would be out in 15 min.  What? Two other patrons who came in later already had their food. Never going back. Do not recommend. Left without paying for our food that never came. This is the Napa Valley. A service oriented city. Unacceptable.  They don't deserve even 1 star.
N G.,"Vallejo, CA",2,61,2,1.0,3/7/2017,I'm sitting in the restaurant still as I write this. It's been an hour. Still haven't received our appetizers. Everyone's finished their drinks almost twice over. Don't even seem to see any food going out to anyone anywhere near us. This is beyond sad. Update: appetizers served after 70 minutes followed immediately by our main course. No real time in between. 2 of our dishes had missing items. Final update: I'm now home puking my guts out. It was either caused by the boneless chicken wings or by the French onion soup. Yeah. I'm not coming back.
Tyler F.,"Fairfield, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/6/2017,Never coming here again. Waited over 30 min in curbside to go. And the employees are literally laughing at the issue.
Ricardo S.,"Newark, CA",0,20,59,5.0,6/15/2017,"We are originally from down south Long beach Ca , we both work in the service Deparment, were very polite since we know how a simple thank you goes a long way. With that being said its our first time here and what can I say but positive things, Peter greed us right away as he maid eye contact with us, he then told us that Danielle will be our server. Danielle was up beat and very energetic made us smile due to her great smile and positive vibe. Every time she pass by our tables she made sure we where taken care-off. Due to her excellent service will be back more often she's a keeper"
Jay D.,"Rohnert Park, CA",222,17,,2.0,8/6/2017,"I did the carside to go online and it took them over 20 minutes AFTER the time quoted for them to get me my food. After 15 minutes of waiting in my car I walked in and told them my situation. ( actually the guy in the car next to me did, he was waiting just as long as me and was frustrated as well) My food wasn't even done yet so I waited a bit longer. One of the managers said that they would do something about my check and give me a discount for waiting. A new manager came back with a $5 off coupon if I spend $25 or more for next time.... I'm not a huge complainer but I feel like that situation wasn't resolved the right way. Why do I want to come back and spend more money when I didn't have a good experience the first time... not only that, I was led on to believe I was getting a discount....the hostess was nice but was poor customer service by the management. :( sorry"
Jim E.,"Redondo Beach, CA",30,622,,5.0,10/3/2016,"What 5 stars for Applebee's Well yes and no, Applebee's gets 3 stars for the food, the extra 2 stars are because they supported special Olympics on the night we were there with the Tip a Cop fundraiser. We walked in and the place was full of cops, City cops, Highway Patrol, County Sheriff at least one from every jurisdiction in the area. The cops help the staff, serve the customer, some were better at it than others but they took time out of their evening to support special Olympics and give more to the communities they serve and make a difference with a very good cause. So extra stars to the staff for working harder The cops for their time and dedication And this location for helping support a worthy cause Highly recommended even on a non-fund raising night"
Stacey S.,"Napa, CA",1,40,2,1.0,7/18/2017,You shouldn't offer curbside pickup if you don't have anyone to work it. Ordered by phone and was told 6 minutes till my order was done. I got there in just under 10 and sat for over 5 minutes in curbside pickup then went in only to wait at least another 5 minutes because the bartender was busy and the other staff said I had to wait for her while you were just standing around when my order had already been done. Napa staff should visit Vacaville and take notes.
Van H.,"Napa, CA",118,171,594,4.0,5/23/2016,"Applebee's is pretty standard restaurant dining across the United States. Their menu & food offerings are the same. Probably your big difference you could appreciate in Applebee's would be in customer service. You can get good, as in real good - - or you can get bad as soon you sit down in the booth. The Applebee's on Socol, in Napa, has very nice staff and they treat you well."
Shylene L.,"Napa, CA",63,16,,3.0,10/11/2017,"We went in last night at 1045. A full hour and a quarter until close. It was not busy at all. There were probably three servers for ten tables. Our server was disinterested. It took him ten minutes to even greet our table. Drinks took another 15 and two came melted (they were frozen) and the one strawberry ""dolarita"" we ordered cam regular flavor. When we flagged down our server to tell him, he took it to the bar, put a couple pumps of strawberry in it and brought it back to the table without even stirring it. When our dinner came out my daughter and I ordered the Bourbon Street chicken and shrimp. This dish is touted to have crispy potatoes sauteed onions and mushrooms chicken and shrimp. The ""crispy potaoes"" we're stuck together and not seasoned properly. Everything else was over seasoned and super salty, and there were absolutely no mushrooms anywhere on the plate. Now, I could understand this being a possible problem in the middle of a dinner rush. Unfortunately, this was not a dinner rush. The restaurant was nearly empty, and we are in the middle of a natural disaster. We had all had a long drawn-out day number 2 of the Napa fires and just really wanted to relax and have a nice meal. Our host who sat us was amazing. He asked us if we were personally affected by the fires, we had a nice conversation about our experiences, and he wished us well."
Sean M.,"Napa, CA",12,2,,1.0,7/27/2017,"The service here is underwhelming at its very best.The food is what you would expect.The prices are good for the quality but the lack of service kills the overall experience.It feels like it would be easier to pick your drinks up at the bar rather than waiting for your waiter or waitress to bring it to you,the same goes for the food service."
Marc D.,"Napa, CA",1,2,,5.0,7/16/2017,"Steve our waiter was awesome today. He dealt with difficult patrons, served us well and was on top of everything."
Amber L.,"Fairfield, CA",21,34,,1.0,5/1/2017,"Terrible service and food.  We were the first ones in the restaurant, along with a few other patrons.  We were sat immediately and our order was taken.  I told the waitress that we were on a time crunch.   Our food took forever (like 45 mins) to come out.  I ordered the pork chop and it was super dry.   I had to take a drink with each bite.  The waitress Che ked on us once and my companion asked for more napkins.   They never arrived. Nor any refills on drinks.  It's safe to say this will be my last experience at an Applebees"
Cathy W.,"Napa, CA",41,51,96,3.0,12/10/2016,"Yesterday my friends and I had lunch here. The Chicken Tortilla Soup and Fajita Wrap were really good. One of the gals I was with ordered a salad and the French Onion Soup. The soup was disgusting. She made our waitress, Amy G.  aware of the problem, and it was promptly replaced with Tomato Basil which was good. I just wanted the thank Amy for her professional and kind service. She is a very sweet girl. Applebee's should be so honored to have her as an employee."
Danny L.,"Porterville, CA",19,1,,1.0,7/13/2017,"Had one of the most horrible dinning experience in a long time, was left waiting for almost 30 min for service.  Then when the waitress did come over she was kind of rude. This spot in Napa gives Applebees a bad name"
Eric M.,"American Canyon, CA",75,92,29,5.0,5/21/2017,Our Server was Sophia. (pretty sure that was her name) She was very friendly and attentive. The food was delicious. No mistakes and everything was timmed perfect.
Angelina S.,"Napa, CA",85,14,,4.0,6/17/2017,"Ordered online tonight. Quick, easy and good service. Thank you peter and casey, good job."
Haley C.,"San Leandro, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/4/2017,"This place is a joke. I ordered carside pick up, they were a little late and all the carside pickup spots were taken and I had to call and tell them I was there. Lo and behold, when I got back to my hotel, there was no dressing for my salad and no utensils, LOL. Yeah, really."
Emily S.,"Napa, CA",1,5,,1.0,1/7/2017,"Brenda lied to us and said there was a 30 to 40 minute wait to be seated at 11:30pm despite the fact that there were obviously open tables and nobody waiting. She purposefully turned away our service despite the fact that I called beforehand and they told me the kitchen closed at 11:45, which is probably not even true since they close at midnight. Very disappointed. Do not appreciate being given the runaround. I have worked at restaurants and I know when people are just trying to go home, but why work at a late night establishment if you are not willing to stick it out? Went to Denny's instead. Thanks for nothing, Applebee's."
Linda W.,"Napa, CA",9,108,,5.0,3/13/2017,"Yes, 5 stars for Applebees!  Living in Napa Valley can be very hard to afford going out to dinner.  They have some great food if you know what to order.  The quesadilla burger is amazing!  Really.  Compares to ANY high class restaurant....And believe me, we've been to them all!  We always start with a wedge salad with their green goddess dressing...so good.  Ask for the dressing on the side since they tend to put too much on.  The candied pecans, bacon bits and blue cheese crumbles add just the amount of salty sweet goodness!  We always share one and Applebees is so nice to split it and give us our own plates!  If the fries are fresh, they are so yummy and flavorful...I think they put crack in them!  Lol.  Oh!!!  And get the chicken wonton tacos! Those were little, crunchy bites of heaven! All of their drinks are too sweet for me, but if you get a gin and tonic you will be happy. Last week we had Brian as our server.  Greatest smile in Napa!!!  His whole face lights up!  He was super attentive, friendly and hospitable.  And to top all of this off, I left my MasterCard there. If you've ever lost your credit card you know that horrible feeling you get in your gut. A couple days later I realized maybe it was at Applebee's where I left it.  I called right away and the manager said it was in the safe! THANK YOU, BRIAN!!!!  I went right down to pick it up!  So, give this affordable restaurant at chance.  If you get what I suggested, you will be one, FULL, happy camper!!!"
Léa V.,"Napa, CA",90,1,,4.0,9/1/2017,"The food was very tasty for a chain restaurant. Service was excellent, Kim gave us great recommendations for meal and wineries to visit !"
Kim M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,35,7,3.0,10/5/2015,"They shouldn't even get 1 star! Service is absolutely horrible. They hardly do anything. They certainly DO NOT give you a refill on your drink. I've left the restaurant 3x not finishing my food because I was thirsty. I had to suck on ice. It's ridiculous. Food was ok but not great. It's so much better at other locations. I called the manager and she hung up on me. Way to handle it there manager! Now I know why this place is so bad. She could've solved my problem immediately with a to go drink! Duh! UPDATE I received a call from a regional manager named Ryan. He seemed very concerned about my bad visits to this restaurant and heard what I had to say. He was very friendly, apologetic and genuinely seemed like he wanted to fix this problem.  So because of his call I will give it some time but I will try this restaurant again. I appreciated his concern!"
Yosh H.,"Napa, CA",4,4,1,1.0,12/12/2016,"Alright, let me just start with saying that the Applebee's Menu is absolutely barren. I have memories of there being a lot more on the menu, what gives? My dad and I went in here this evening and we had an atrocious experience. We ordered our appetizers and were seated rather quickly, but I couldn't find a damn thing to order beyond that. I decided to settle on the Fish and Chips. Our Appetizer came quickly, which was about 7 chicken tenders covered in buffalo sauce masquerading as wings. Don't get me wrong, they were tasty, but this is probably the only good part of the meal, as it all went downhill from there. When the fish and chips arrived, it looked fine at first. I bit into the fish and chips, and, it was fine. At first. The further I proceeded into the fish, the flavor immediately died, and the entire fish had essentially fallen flat. Thinking it may only be this one, I bit into the other one's midsection. Same problem. They hadn't cooked any of them thoroughly enough to get the flavor in. The fries were fine, but they're fries, it's hard to mess that up. After my lackluster meal was complete, I decided to have dessert. I had a Hot Fudge Meltdown, which is also known as lava cake and a scoop of ice cream. The server warned me, however, that they had no hot fudge, which immediately baffled me. They would be able to serve me a CAKE, but had no ability to make FUDGE HOT. Don't they microwave all of their food before sending it out, regardless? The food aside, there were other things that were strange and confusing about this evening were the way that service was done. There were no napkins. Anywhere. There were no dispensers to obtain napkins. We had to ASK for napkins. And what napkins we got were essentially drink coasters. Thin, little measly pieces of paper. We also had to ask for silverware, which didn't even come with our food in the first place. Speaking of the food, it was all in strangely small portions? None of this would justify to me that our meal would be worth 65 dollars. Will not be going again."
Andy W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/26/2017,"Had to send a lunch wrap back due to excessive salt. Waitress was nice about it, but then sent manger out who seemed offended by us calling out the salt bomb of a dish. She did agree to send out another which was decent. When I received my bill the amount was correct, as it only charged us for two entrees. However, after they ran my credit card they had added a third entree and increased the amount to reflect that. After pointing this out they brought out a different bill with a different check number to reflect the correct amount. Not sure what kind of funny business is going on here, but I advise you review your receipts carefully when visiting this establishment."
Crystal M.,"Napa, CA",536,13,2,1.0,3/26/2017,Coming here the food is decent for the price. I always enjoy their orientalist chicken salad and wonton tacos.. their happy hour is great.. their service AWFUL!!!!!! We had a waiter our orders were ALL wrong... took a long time for our orders to come out and we ordered salads... he wasn't really around and he seemed nervous and just not with it. Maybe the kitchen was short staffed but we had my grandmother with us who has a dietary restriction and we said to leave out the corn off the salad and guess what there was corn... my salad had dressing on the side and I didn't ask for that.. and unfortunately it was overdressed..... the soup i got was warm.. not hot.... I mean yeah what do you expect it is applebees.. I think they need to revisit how they train their employees .. but I expect a little more attention to detail and a little more consistency.... very disappointing visit..............
Maddy B.,"Vacaville, CA",142,114,144,4.0,1/25/2016,"Eeeeeee! Seriously the best apple bees I've ever been to!  Teika was our awesome server. She was extremely friendly and upbeat. She was mindful when I made a comment about my husband and I watching a movie and brought out our check with our food just in case we need to rush out. Cool! Our food was so tasty! My husband ordered the won ton shrimp over rice (600 calories) & I ordered the 7oz sirloin with grilled onion and potatoes. (610 calories) These lower calorie meals were better tasting then anything I've ever tried here!!  Our food and drinks came super quick and we were able to leave the place with more then enough time to go watch our movie. (:  Thanks again, Teika!"
Gerel P.,"Napa, CA",76,4,,1.0,8/10/2016,What a horrible place to eat. I had gotten the new steak grilled salad. The lettuce was wilted and looked like it had been made 2 hours ahead. The steak was so full of Gristle you could hardly cut it with a knife. When I ask the server about it she just said sorry I'll show it to them in back. I will definitely not be back to this restaurant.
A M.,"Napa, CA",0,9,,3.0,3/2/2017,"Friday night dinner with my family - place was packed, but oddly enough the noise level was low. I figured that it must have been due to the fact that the noise level was very low! First off the manager - rather than a server - served us our drinks, then it took a while for another person to take our order. Our food arrived 10 minutes longer than expected, and was disappointed with the presentation  and quality  of the food. We order the two samplers, and were charged individually for each, rather than the ""2 for $10""(?), which costs $5 more. Of course we complained, and received a 50% discount on those items. Overall, service was poor, food was ok, and wait time was awful. They get 3 stars because I understand that they had a full house, and apparently were short-staffed. Otherwise, it would have been a 2!"
Mayra C.,"Napa, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/1/2017,Doesn't deserve a star. Terrible over the phone service. They leave you on hold for a long time and don't even check in. Horrible. The employees are probably making out with hotdogs
Toby C.,"Panama City Beach, FL",13,14,5,1.0,8/15/2015,"Restaurant was only 1/2 full. Drink order was late coming out. Ordered an appetizer and after a 30 minute wait the entree came out and the appetizer never arrived. Waitress did not come by to refill drink until meal was finished. Lousy, lousy service.  There are a lot of eating options in Napa. Skip this Applebee's and go elsewhere."
Misty S.,"Napa, CA",62,8,3,1.0,5/4/2016,"If there were an option for no stars - That would be our pick; hopefully this review gets attention as the online contact us page was not working yesterday or today so Yelp it is! We just left this establishment very unhappy (5/3/16 8:35-9pm). Our server took forever to get us our drinks, had awkward conversation and never tended to us. We waited and waited for about 15 mins to place our order, then we were going to attempt to use the machine at the table but was giving her the benefit of the doubt when my husband hit the ""page server"" when she was bringing another table stuff she then finally asked if we were ready. Wee then ordered our app buffalo wings and mozz sticks ribs and the philly. After 20 more mins another person brought the cold food. Whilst this was happening my husband finally scopes out the manger who looked straight back at him, never came to our table - he was talking to an employee who had her food eating at a side table. After he looks back he ends up bringing a table other than ours ( our drinks were empty) another refill and still never made his way over in the very unpacked restaurant and this table he visited was two tables away from us, same section. Mind you after making eye contact with my husband. My husband ended up having to go up to the mngr Marc, explain the situation how he felt disrespected and didn't accept the comp meal based on the service he was overseeing and providing. We both have worked in customer service with pride for over 10yrs so we know good, great, poor and really bad service. You may assume this is one of the worst experiences we've had based on taking out more lost time to report this. Keyword: training. Never coming back"
Dusty N.,"Emeryville, CA",21,219,13,2.0,6/5/2015,"Each time I come in here there is no host/hostess standing at the front and I'm left standing there for a few minutes twiddling my thumbs wondering if I should stay or go.  The food is mediocre, it's the best you can get when there isn't a Chilis nearby. But for Napa it's the best neighborhood bar and grill we can get for now I suppose. I've never had bad service but I have had a cold order of boneless buffalo wings and a really tough steak that looked and tasted like a hockey puck. Definitely recommend the two for 20 deal so you get your money's worth.  Great happy hour specials in the bar area. Not a whole lot of parking when it's busy so you may have to park in the Home Depot/Target parking lot and walk across the street."
Susan T.,"Napa, CA",1,30,2,1.0,12/29/2016,"Last Tuesday night we wanted to have dinner at Applebee's before going to the movie theater.  We arrived one hour before showtime thinking that we'd just order a hamburger, then hop over to see our movie (a couple blocks away).  We were seated within 5 minutes, but, had to wait for another 10 minutes to get a menu.  We both ordered the 'American Standard' hamburger with cheddar cheese (instead of American cheese) and water.  The water arrived right away, but, it took 35 minutes for our food to arrive.  The waiter put the plates down and left.  We had 8-10 minutes to eat and there was no silverware on our table - aaaaaannnd...there was no waiter to be seen!  Then, we looked at the plates.  On the plate was a basic hamburger (not at ALL what we ordered) with American cheese and nothing else on the top or even on the side.  The fries weren't even warm.  We frantically flagged down the waiter who seemed completely overwhelmed) to tell him what was going on.  His response was, ""let me look at your order"" (while he was digging to find what he wrote down). He was insinuating that I ordered the wrong thing.  We were so disgusted, we just got up and left.  We had a gift card to use but are unsure if we EVER want to go back. Rotten, terrible service and food."
