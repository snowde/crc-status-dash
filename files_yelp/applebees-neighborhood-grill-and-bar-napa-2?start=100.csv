SoCalSkippy ..,"Victorville, CA",0,202,28,2.0,8/15/2012,"We came here on a Sunday night after 9PM for their late night happy hour and we waited almost 5 minutes before the hostess finally showed-up to her little booth to greet us! The place was pretty busy, the margaritas were real watered down, the service wasn't that great and the appetizers were just ok."
Bob A.,"Vallejo, CA",166,425,796,3.0,6/6/2009,Can'ts say I hate the place quite like neal e.(although his review really had me laughing).  The drinks are cheap and you get free chips to absorb the alcohol. Mainly I stop by this location for drinks and appetizers and so far I have not gotten ill or served watered down drinks. At every visit the servers and bartender have been polite and food was served in a timely manner. Also the food has been good and the place is clean. Therefore Applebee's gets a strong 3 star rating.
Amy L.,"Vallejo, CA",100,4,,1.0,12/20/2013,"I called earlier today to discuss with manager if I could make reservations. He said they don't take reservations and said to me to come in half an hour early to place my name on a table. I said I needed to be at a graduation and heading straight there so I didn't think I'd be able to come in early. He proceeded to say that he'd let me do this just this time-which a logical person would assume ok we'll make an exception and let you make a reservation. I said we shouldn't be more than 15 people he said I'll put you down for 20-I said ok. We come in at 9pm and talked to the hostess she says we don't make reservations and I said the manager let me for tonight-she went to talk to him and he said we only had a conversation about it but we still needed to wait (which is not at all what my understanding of the conversation was). I said ok that's fine-35 minutes later I'm still waiting-and they still have not told me how long it's going to take or checked in with us about the wait at all. We could've just went to a restaurant in Vallejo if the manager just told me they don't take reservations-I would've been fine with a simple ""no"" and moved on. I have a 21 month old and 4 months pregnant-I'm exhausted from a 2 hour graduation and waiting here. A"
Karen F.,"Napa, CA",21,1,,1.0,6/23/2015,Its the second time we visit this restaurant and like the first time we sat down and waited for15 min for someone to come and ask what we wanted to drink 15 min later the drinks came i could se my server talking and talking everywhere serving everyone else with the biggest smile she had but with us she was a complete as****** im sorry but its true !

Don H.,"Sonoma, CA",0,109,126,4.0,2/20/2011,"I am not a huge Applebee's fan because I love Chili's. However, I have to admit that I am addicted to the wings. I've been to Wing Stop and other places that are wings' experts but I have to admit that there's something about their wings that keeps me coming back."
Ham S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,92,12,1.0,12/24/2011,"Steak and garlic shrimp @ 7:43 pm - 12/3/2011. Horrible seating. Was greates then they walked away. Server never checked back. Steak was waaaaay undercooked, Sierra Nevada pale ale tasted horrible here; and I'm a huge fan of s.n.p.a.. Finished meal currently going on my 15th minute of waiting for the check. Finally got the check, server took my credit card then proceeded to take two orders on his way to the kitchen..... Will not be returning until new management comes about."
Joe P.,"Suisun City, CA",0,41,,1.0,3/30/2014,Decided to stop in a grab a quick bite to eat. My moms dish had rice that was hard as cement. My wife received the wrong dish. My hamburger was tough and crispy.
Karen H.,"Napa, CA",238,15,69,1.0,12/15/2013,"Today I took five foster youth out to a holiday lunch at the Applebee's in Napa and they were so thrilled to go out to lunch... as we opened the utensils we were surprised to find dried on food on the first fork; then the next person had chunks of food on their knife; we gave these to the server who made no comment and just brought several more  sets of utensils and left the dirty ones on the table.  Then I opened mine and there was a huge piece of dried lettuce or some green vegetable on my knife about an inch long.  At this point I called the manager, I believer her name was Cheryl, she seemed discussed with the dirty utensils, took them all away and brought us back clean knives and forks.  The food was fine and we enjoyed the rest of our meal; however, I was surprised that there didn't seem to be much of an apology for this disgusting situation.  We would have thought that she would have come back to check on the table or to offer something -- a dessert to share, a small discount off of the bill, an apology as we left.. but, nothing.  Trust me.. to lose the business from all of us will cost them more than what she could have offered today to make us feel that we were ""heard"" and acknowledged..Oh well, Applebees..."
Sarah S.,"Emeryville, CA",101,358,47,2.0,10/18/2011,"I'm not a fan of Applebee's, but my co-worker and I pulled in here out of desperation and fast food avoidance. The service is still the same as my last visit 7 years ago - friendly but robotic. I was so bummed that the free wi-fi advertised didn't work the entire time we were there. One server suggested that it might work better if I went and stood by the bathroom. Sure, that doesn't look creepy. I ordered the steak and potato salad. Not too bad, but the steak was well done and I ordered it medium. By that point I was so hungry I didn't care."
Katrina F.,"Napa, CA",1,17,,1.0,10/20/2008,"Have you ever seen the movie Waiting? Everytime I step into Applebees I feel like I just stepped into that movie. Ew.  Screaming kids, pissy waiters that stand around and make you feel like doing there job is a huge inconvience, bitchy people who think Applebees is fine dining so you have to sit there and listen to another patron bitch about the stupidest thing which may be the reason why the staff sucks so hard. My last trip was the last time I will ever willingly dine at an Applebees. My chicken tasted and looked like it had just been heated up in the microwave, thrown on a plate with veggies, followed by a drowning in an unknown sauce. My water glass sat empty most of the time, our waitress was never present. We saw her floating around not really doing much of anything. I actually had to go to the bar to get my water refilled.  I could go on and on about how you should not spend your money at this crap hole, go to Marie Callenders or even Dennys is better than Applebees."
Sandy G.,"Napa, CA",0,9,,4.0,3/18/2013,"Compared to Dennys across the street,  this is the place to go! The guy that served us gave us excellent customer service! The food did take a while but not too long! I love the little thing they have on the table that you can play games while you wait it was great for my daughter! Food was good as well."
.Hon H.,"Oakland, CA",239,1249,,1.0,5/20/2007,"Went here out of sheer necessity - I hadn't eaten anything since lunch the previous day, traffic was hellish and my parents were with me.  Had the Mediterranean chicken salad.  Lost the Mediterranean chicken salad in a hasty bathroom stop 30 minutes later. 'nuff said."
Richard G.,"Provo, UT",145,112,5,1.0,12/20/2007,"Applebee's holds the distinct honor of making frozen dinners look fancy. Last night, when everything else in Napa was closed, we decided to grab some food here.  It looked promising, there were tons of people there after 9, but what those poor, desperate people were doing in that place, I'll never know!  Don't people get it?!  It's not really any cheaper, people!  There are plenty of decent places with actual FOOD that has been PREPARED by a CHEF! No point in giving you a blow by blow account of the food, but here's the gist of it:  I ordered the orange chicken dish, an applebee's ""favorite"" according to the menu.  I wondered out loud as I began to dig in if perhaps the chicken was the same chicken used in the ""boneless buffalo wings"" (aka. fried chicken nuggets).  ""Yes indeed"", came a voice from behind me, my waitress who was loitering nearby, ""but they are tossed in our signature orange sauce"".  Hmm.... well, how can I fault them for that?  Take some chicken nuggets, serve it with some frozen rice pilaf, double the price and Voila!  you have a ""Mandarin Chicken Bowl"", served on a plate. Oh, and seriously, save your money on the nachos.  They are EXACTLY the same as 7-11 nachos, with minced up meat gravy and congealed yellow cheese sauce. If you're really hungry, just get 2 or 3 from 7-11 and you'll still save a bundle.  Better yet, upgrade your nachos and go next door to Taco Bell.  At least they have better hot sauce."
Kayla M.,"Napa, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/20/2013,"One star for the food being good, but the service was terrible. Our server took out drink order but forgot a water had to ask three times before my husband finally got his water. Our food came out pretty quickly but wasn't brought by our server an then our server never came back, everyone at the table needed refills and the only reason we got them was because we got up and asked a manager, even after that the manager told our server then our server came over and asked if we needed refills we said yes then a minute later the manager came back over and figured out what we were drinking, still the server didnt bring back anything. Then we waited again for the check for what seemed like forever and then had to wait again to get our cards picked up, when she never came back we just left cash and ran out, another table left at the sane time as us after waiting for the same server for over 30 minutes and never got there order taken"
Robert S.,"Sacramento, CA",2,16,,2.0,7/27/2010,"The service, food, and atmosphere are nearly the same at all Applebee's that I've been to. The only one worth mentioning was the one in Cameron Park, CA. I would go there once or more a week after classes to grab some wings and a beer and the bartender there was fantastic. Otherwise all Applebee's are meh."
Nae E.,"Napa, CA",0,104,13,4.0,2/3/2012,Was there on 1/31/12. Our waitress don't recall her name but she was a middle aged Caucasian lady she was great to us! Was very friendly and professional. Was satisfied with her service.
Inigo M.,"San Francisco, CA",35,2400,69,3.0,11/5/2006,Your typical Applebee's but service was fast and attentive. Chicken Wings were dry.
Chuck B.,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/23/2010,"Typical Applebees, pleasant waiters, decent service, but nearly everything was extremely salty.  It was as if the cook went crazy with the salt shaker. Out of nine dinners, seven were excessively salty--even the steaks!"
Russ B.,"San Francisco, CA",18,100,20,4.0,6/28/2008,Ya know what it is Applebees........  They have a nice happy hour special after 9pm.  There is always a place at the bar and with TV's playing sports.  You can really tell that this is a place that the true napa locals hang out and eat.
Brice C.,"Vallejo, CA",11,246,1,3.0,12/24/2007,Didn't please my colon but the food was pretty good. Didn't seem like the food was worth what we paid for but hey a friend is leaving for the Air Force and I had $50 in gift cards.
