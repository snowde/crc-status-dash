Kathy D.,"San Francisco, CA",1,12,7,1.0,4/13/2016,"Bad food, bad service. Ordered by phone for pick up from Samantha H. Left out my husband's order so had to pay for room service and we were going to pay with a gift card. I asked for bbq sauce for my son's meal and didn't get that. As far as the food, I was craving  beef brisket and that's what the menu described - ""SHREDDED beef brisket"" and got a flat out burger patty  so disappointing. And the flavored ice tea was like 80% syrup. Didn't even get ketchup for my fries. They need training for small tips, like reading orders back, and as a refresher that they work in the hospitality business and people pay to enjoy their food and not the type of job to just clock in."
Veronica C.,"Napa, CA",0,4,1,1.0,1/13/2017,"Came to dinner with a group of girls and had the worst service ever. Not only did we get a drink spilt all over everyone's faces,  when we asked for one of our missing items she said okay and than came back telling us we never ordered it when clearly she repeated our order. The manager on duty Mark laughed in our face when we advised him on the horrible service we just had! Who taught these people customer service! No one in their right minds laughs in anyone faces. So disrespectful never again!"
Amanda C.,"Napa, CA",1,2,,1.0,2/16/2016,"For my birthday dinner, all I wanted was this salad from Applebee's. I love the Asian chicken salad, so I thought I'd give them a chance since we quit going there a few years ago due to bad service. I placed the order online and the site crashed multiple times. After twenty minutes, I finally got it through. The meal was to be ready for pick up at 6. At 6:05 my husband pulled up and waited in the designated parking spot. After 5 more minutes, he went in and asked about our order. They said,""oh, just two more minutes."", he went back to the car to wait and get back to the kids. 10 more minutes later, they finally come with the food. Once home, we distribute the food only to realize that none of the 7 drinks were there. (He didn't know I had ordered any.)  At this point, he gets really irritated. Between the food not being ready on time, the unprofessional service, and now part of our $75 order missing, he had enough. After explaining the situation, the manager offered a $15 gift card. There is no way I'm going in there again. Even with the gift card. Why would I want to put myself in a frustrating situation again? It's not worth it.  To make it even worse, as my husband was on the phone with the manager, I took a bite of my much anticipated birthday salad and got a mouthful of plastic! A big chunk of a plastic bag was mixed into my salad. I'm glad it wasn't a finger or something worse, but still... Not awesome."
Dione G.,"Napa, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/11/2017,"Don't get curbside to go and expect it to be ready at the time you say. After waiting in the car 20 minutes past the time I was supposed to have my food I called (I was in pajamas or I would have gone in) and they put me on hold for 5 minutes before I hung up and called back. The guy told me they were ""bagging it now"" and it got to my car another 15 minutes later. To top it off the food was cold. And the order was missing onion rings. I gave up and went home. Last time I will go there."
Bryan R.,"Hayward Highland, CA",0,43,17,5.0,11/2/2016,"I'm going to give this place 5 stars for there service man, Was i impressed. I didn't even have to open the door they opened it for me and the person I was with. In fact they opened both doors for us it was simply welcoming. Our wait for our table was short like 4 seconds short the place was fairly full and they moved things around to sit us at a booth. The server was very professional checked up on us as needed, recommended food, and  was attentive to us by bringing more water filling up our drinks and bringing sauce with out asking. The food was nice and warm It was my first meal that day so I enjoyed very very much!"
Yissel L.,"Napa, CA",2,63,96,5.0,4/23/2016,I gave 5 stars for our waitress Linda...she was amazing! Food was good too :) went there today for dinner with the while family. My kids loved their food and their surprise Sundays :)
Julie Z.,"San Francisco, CA",144,101,37,4.0,2/7/2015,"Napa location: Never had to wait for more than 5 minutes to get a table. Friendly waitstaff and decent food for the price. They have really good weekly deals and food is consistent. Reminds me of a TGIFridays, just better. Applebee's has a very different selection of mixed drinks; I like to try a new one each time I come; never been disappointed."
Erin B.,"Napa, CA",18,6,,4.0,3/18/2016,"Ok ... it seems Applebee's is getting a handle on things.  The food is getting more consistent and the kitchen seems to be running much smoother.  I would like to give a shout out to Teika for great attention to detail - always.  Hats off to Miranda and the newest additions Destiny and Emerson for handling the bar with expertise. They had big ""shoes"" to fill and have managed to transition in quite well. Way to go Applebee's!"
Yul T.,"San Francisco, CA",24,5,2,1.0,4/17/2016,"Very bad services.  We had group people of five and order four dishes and two appetizers, two drinks and one birthday gift of sundae.  The last dish of shrimp and chicken took too long to come.  We almost wanted to pay bill then the waitress came with the dish.  And we asked for the sundae at the middle of our mealtime but it finally didn't come.  The bill did charged on the sundae.  Called via the little machine on the table to asked service but no one showed up.  The restaurant was not crowded, and there were empty tables.  It was Very Slow service, and the service not acceptable.  Bad eating experience in this location."
Miranda T.,"Vacaville, CA",28,31,10,3.0,5/5/2015,"I love coming here but sometimes certain items need serious improvement. I'm sorry but the half rack of ribs are subpar. I got 0 to no meat of the ribs. it was mostly bone which is funny because for 14$ I could go to walmart and get their ribs (3-8$) which are more moister and pack full of meat on the bone compared to applebees.  Other than that the meat that I did have (barely) was moist and fall off the bone. Loved the asian chile sauce though, it had a nice kick. Service overall is great if not excellent. Staff is always helpful and full of smiles. :) Wish my water was filled more than once."
Brooke M.,"Napa, CA",54,17,3,5.0,5/8/2016,"Wanted to say thank you for the great service today. It's Mother's Day and the first one I have ever had off and not serving others. My kids picked Applebee's because we always have a good time laughing and talking. Today we had the pleasure of having Madison as our server. My kids thought she was a Disney Princess, she is that nice and kind and when she picked up our plates I swear she was humming a song. She treated us as if we were her first table and we were her last. I have been in the industry for over 25 yrs and for the last 16 yrs been a mom taking care of other moms on this day. Thank you for your great service!!! Good food, good times!!!"
Jeremiah L.,"Napa, CA",0,2,,2.0,10/10/2016,Applebees when will you get it togather!Every time I get boneless buffalo wings I specifically ask for extra wing sauce in them because you guys never do it right!!I shouldn't have to go to the manager EVERY TIME and they do it right so I'm gonna take a picture of what you always do and one to show how they should look get it right applebees!!!
Cristian H.,"Napa, CA",16,73,11,5.0,10/11/2014,"Applebee's is a great place to eat with your friends or family. You'll always have a good time here, and more if you get those great servers that know what they're doing.  Great food, great price. Go for it!"
Rick R.,"CA, CA",930,32,54,2.0,9/9/2015,I have given Applebee's a few try's. Service is normally good. The bar is great and the wings are always good. The problem is all the other food. Not good. I mean awful. Their new burger with an egg on it looked great on TV. Not in person. I may stop by for a beverage and a wing. Just can't do the food.
Dustin O.,"Napa, CA",4,8,,1.0,1/23/2016,"The Napa location has at least one half of an idiot that I in countered on my night out with my wife. I was told a 5-10 minute wait for a table which was fine, considering it's Saturday night. This half a retard seats 2 parties of 2 that walk in 5 minutes after me, then she asks if we've been helped and I say yes, we're waiting, and she says right this way to another party of 2 that just walked in the door!!! Nothing says well wait some more quit as well as that. I give them 1 star....... because I'm required to."
Vanessa R.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,49,21,3.0,8/25/2014,"I come into Applebee's for two reasons. Late night food service & Linda. (Who is amazing) She is always good to us.  Last night we went in hoping to see Linda but she wasn't there. After a full day of cleaning up after the earthquake we are hungry and tired. And need something small and quick.  We originally sat in a booth and the waiter walked by us 4 times without saying anything so we decided to go to the bar to get better service. What a mistake!!!  The bartender name brian, wearing an orange shirt was the worst service I have ever gotten at a bar- period. I mean you have one job - Fill drinks, get food orders, and stay behind the bar. If You are in the weeds with 8 patrons sitting at the bar, you shouldn't have a job. Ive work in restaurants for years. If someone is trying to talk to you to ASK for service then you have FAILED. I know when I'm being ignored on purpose. When I asked for waters and it takes 5minutes to get them while he went to someone who ordered AFTER me and make them a drink just annoyed me. (Hint: It is noticeable) it is a bar. Your moves are on display. He couldn't even bus the dirty used glasses off the bar nor did he say thank you or your welcome. Shitty attitude with shitty service. Again--- it was NOT busy. If you can't do your job, you shouldn't have one.  I give 3 stars because of the late night hours to get food other than in and out and also for Linda. --- Brian and the other incompetent waiters... STEP IT UP."
Seph V.,"Temecula, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/14/2015,"Had a terrible dining experience here. We came for happy hour drinks and appitizers. The food was fine and our second server Amy was kind (although she ordered us a $9 dollar lemon drop martini instead of the $4 lemon drop shot, however the extra cost was removed from our bill.) To start we ordered 3 jeager bombs and 3 kamikazi. They brought 6 glasses out and our fist server maxi said they were the jeager bombs. Literally every other applebees and every other bar for that matter comes with a glass with the red Bull and a shot glass full of jeager however these were just glasses. Jeager bombs come with two parts so we assumed they were to be mixed and then drank. We waited for the 3 kamikazi we ordered and eventually asked where it was since maxi never came back with a second drink. The manager a thin woman with long dark hair then very rudely and aggressively came up to our table and said she ""knew for a fact that we got two drinks already"" as if accusing us of lying and trying to get free drinks! When we tried to explain we thought the two glasses were for the jeager bomb she condescendingly told us their chain doesn't allow for them to have people drop the shot in because the glass could break therefor their jeager bomb comes premixed. Like I said no applebees or bar I've been to does that they all have plastic cups for the shot. On their menu they even have a picture of the red plastic shot glass that goes with a jeager bomb. If I had know that we wouldn't have ordered it period yet they offered no apology, they didn't remove the drinks from our bill, and they were aggressive and rude on top of that so we had a ruined jeager bomb/ kamikazi mashup. It was only a misunderstanding but the manager was extremely rude to us and the entire experience was bad because of her. None of us will be returning again that is for sure."
Antoinette J.,"Vacaville, CA",110,11,,1.0,4/9/2015,"Seriously, Applebee's in general is getting so over rated.  Your drinks are way too expensive and I'd rather go to BJ's and have dinner and drinks.  We had 1 drink a piece at the Napa location and our drinks alone was approximately $25.00!!!  Who does that?  What's the purpose?  It was such a nice place to go to be with good friends but like I said...it's soooooooo over rated."
A Marie D.,"Napa, CA",38,65,50,5.0,4/7/2014,It's Applebee's .. Family's first choice to sit and eat when they're lazy and don't feel like cooking. Mixed drinks are always good - because it's poured 'by the book' 2 for 20 is getting a little bit better Thumbs up for presentation .. beats the trays that were used prior.  Great job on the sides for the kids .. finally some good ones!
Morgan J.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,14,,2.0,1/17/2015,We waited 10 minutes after we were seated for a waiter to approach us. When our food finally came out the order was wrong and we had to ask for our water to be refilled. Again we had to ask for our bill and when it finally came it was wrong too. The only reason it was given 2 stars because the food was good. Otherwise don't bother coming if you are wanting a decent service.
