Janinja T.,"New Braunfels, TX",18,44,16,3.0,6/20/2015,Its Applebees! We got lucky with a short wait altho it was shift change. Food average as usual
Jake B.,"Vacaville, CA",1,14,2,1.0,4/16/2016,"We had a party of 13 for my grandmothers birthday. There was no excuse for the service we received but I stuck around to ask for one... Let's breakdown the visit. Our server didn't introduce herself, asked for our beverages and didn't see her for 15 min. Let's set the plot, literally 3 families dining at this time, 3:30 pm. Brought our drinks which wasn't completed due to her forgetting some drinks. She took our order. We requested from our table device, service to refill beverages which didn't happen. Our food comes. A member of our group didn't receive her dinner salad she ordered and our waitress excuse was  ""oh someone should've brought that..."" Really! I believe that is your sole purpose... Doesn't refill our beverages after two different requests, oh and there is food in front of us but there are no napkins nor silver wear which was requested prior of the food arrival. We had to request silver wear once more to start eating. While she was bringing everyones food my wife asked for silver wear and her response was ""I'm trying to get everyone's food out first."" In a snappy tone. Our waitress had a horrible attitude and seemed inconvenienced by us choosing their establishment for my grandmothers 86th birthday because she loves Applebee's. Finally we get settled and she never asked how our food was, didn't refill our beverages but chose to talk about her personal life with other lackadaisical waiters which included cuss words. All of us were in ear shot of the conversation. All in all the service was the worst I have experienced. I received an apology from the manager and the excuse of that she was new. I will not be returning to this Applebee's and any Applebee's for that matter. Very disappointed. The servers name is Emma so if you get her section good luck. The hostess on the other hand was extremely helpful and accommodating her name was Kailey. I wish I could rate this establishment zero stars. I'm seeing a lot of business go under so Applebee's needs to step it up or close the doors."
Julie V.,"Placentia, CA",180,14,,1.0,3/30/2016,"Bad food and even worse service, never come back here again. I feel sorry for the manager our server was awful."
Enzo N.,"Walnut Creek, CA",37,46,,3.0,8/16/2014,"The food here is pretty good and they offer good deals such as the 2 for 25 deal. I love their 4 cheese Mac and cheese and their spinach and artichoke dip. It can get pretty packed sometimes, but their service is usually pretty good."
Niall M.,"Antioch, CA",16,320,60,4.0,2/21/2012,"Normally when I stop into an Applebee's it is because, well, it is there. You know, you need a meal, have no idea about anywhere else and you see the Applebee's sign. This time was no exception. Actually the food in Applebee's is fairly decent but the beer selection is usually really bad. Not here. I had a Laguanitas and Judit I cannot remember - Anchor Steam maybe? We ordered a dish to share and there was no issue. I do not remember what it was but it involved steak. and it was nicely done as ordered. Service was good.  On a scale where three stars is ""as expected"" it earns an extra star for the beer."
Diane S.,"Houston, TX",306,948,153,4.0,1/19/2013,I celebrated my birthday here in napa and although it was just a normal apple bees I had to write a review about their cool tablets at the table with a touchscreen menu. You could see pictures of the menu items as well as prices and even order. Also you could pay at your table pretty cool stuff!
Misty J.,"Vacaville, CA",3,29,23,1.0,7/16/2015,"WORST SERVICE EVER. Actually, no service is a better description. Honestly, the worst Applebee's as far as service goes. And this was at a late lunch, 1:30. I'd hate to see them at happy hour! Rude greeters, just looked at me when I walked in. I chose to sit in the bar, since I was hoping to get an easy lunch by myself. Waited 5 minutes before someone came by. She asked ""Is anyone helping you?"" Stupid question since I'm sitting there, with nothing but closed menus in front of me. I asked for water and she said, ""That's it? No alcohol?"" Then when I told her what food I'd like, she tells me I can just order it through the little kiosk and walked off. At this point, I should've just left but I was starving. My food came out, delivered by someone else, with no silverware. The food was good, so that's the only thing this place has going for them. I never saw my server again, no one checked on me, not once, so I paid my tab through the little kiosk, laughing at the default 20% tip recommendation, and chose to leave 3%. I guess Applebee's in Napa doesn't have to worry about service because people who deserve good service don't choose Applebee's."
L.B. M.,"Boulder Creek, CA",0,106,24,4.0,4/14/2015,"Probably the best Applebee's I've been to, and they have very good food. For appetizers, get their mozzarella sticks with marinara dipping sauce. I don't really have any recommendations for entrées, just go for it! The service is also really nice."
Chelsey D.,"San Diego, CA",58,38,5,2.0,12/22/2013,"The staff is less than friendly (won't make eye contact even when it's obvious you need a refill on your drink...because avoiding us will solve the problem...) and are certainly lacking in the necessary skills it takes to be a hostess and/or a waiter/waitress. Ordering was a pain, we were confused whether to order from their Presto tablet device or deal with the stress of a socially awkward server. Once we placed our order electronically it took foreverrrrr to arrive! Also, a new cook is a poor excuse for bringing us lukewarm food well after its expected arrival time. The manager spoke with us while we discussed the lengthy wait time but successfully avoided our table the rest of our visit, but boy did he seem busy! The rest of his staff hung around the front hostess station. Maybe this place will get its act together but today nothing seemed to be going right."
Julie L.,"Turlock, CA",0,4,2,1.0,3/19/2015,"I took my little family out here for dinner and OMG they are so rude. We sat outside because it was a beautiful day. The waitress brought us some water and told us he will be back to take our order.  He came back with some new people and seated them and then came and ordered their food. He did not come back and take our order, he acted like we did not exist. We waited for 30 minutes and then decided to leave. Customer service was horrible. I did not get to try their food so I cannot rate that but just the customer service."
Nicole T.,"El Sobrante, CA",0,31,1,1.0,1/10/2013,"You only get a star for the  fact that the place was clean. Unprofessional. I felt as though the staff was rude, racist & arrogant. I will never go to OR spend a dime here again. 1) When a customer waves you over don't pretend like you don't see them 2) I tip but you lost out by acting snobby 3) If a customer asks for something don't go gossip about them to your coworker & pretend like you forgot and they can't see you 4) If you want quality customer service don't go here  5)The food was dry.....I don't have these problems in Pinole....maybe you should take notes"
Val T.,"Napa, CA",2,67,11,5.0,11/30/2013,"Great, great service.  Our server, Juliana, was attentive and on top of everything.  She was always checking if we were good.  Homegirl deserves a raise. Even Martha, the GM, dropped by the table and checked on us and brought us extra napkins.  Best service I've had in a long time!"
Melissa T.,"Saint Helena, CA",30,1,1,1.0,5/29/2014,This has got to be the worst Applebee's I have ever been to! Waited 10 minutes before being approached by our server. She never said hi or introduced herself or checked on us. The bourbon street steak was so salty and over seasoned I couldn't finish it (bringing home to my dogs). The napa chicken portobello was bland and under seasoned! Basically this is a hangout for old men gawking at the female bartender and other employees hanging out with them not attending to guest. Needless to say I will not return here.
arlene n.,"Fontana, CA",76,111,115,2.0,11/4/2014,Okay so it was five of us and we only got the mozzarella sticks on time our Cesar salad never made it to our table until the hot food was there! We were starving and it would of made a big difference if they would of kept our mouth busy with some food instead of all the drinks we had.
Jenelle G.,"Oregon City, OR",291,119,68,5.0,5/30/2013,"I love this Applebee's! My boyfriend and I come here all the time for the Happy Hour half off appetizers! This last particular time was the best. The power had gone out at Applebee's so their ""presto"" was not working which is what we typically order and pay on. Because of the power outage, the tab kept being incorrect. It took 3 times of sending the tab back to get it correct. Which you would think would be horrible service, but the waitress had such a nice and real attitude that it made up for the mistakes.  I will always go back here."
Kathleen W.,"Oakland, CA",417,1556,90,3.0,6/21/2010,"It's not right to have one meal over the weekend at the Culinary Institute of America and then another at Applebee's. Since the Peruvian was demanding the World Cup soccer game and didn't have a better solution, we ended up here. They graciously seated us 15 minutes before they were even open.  The food is what it is ... deep fried and mediocre.  But we got to *watch* the Brazil vs Ivory Coast game while listening to Phil Collins. I ordered the strawberry perfect margarita ... which was terrible.  It was too sweet, too tart and no amount of ice / watering it down was going to redeem bad tequila and cheap strawberry flavoring.  The wonton pulled pork tacos offended me so much, we had to order them.  It's like if our friend's Jenny (Chinese) and Erik (Mexican) had a child together.  Bad combo.   It serves no further purpose for me to talk more about the other food we ordered - since the rest was pretty average.  Still, the service was nice and friends were happy since they got to watch the game and have a Blue Moon (on tap) so I'll give it 3 stars.  It would have been worse to have a nagging Peruvian complaining about her soccer game so I'll take average food any day."
Elena B.,"Sparks, NV",202,215,44,4.0,1/2/2013,"Not bad for an Applebee's. I hate this chain as a general rule having gotten sick at the Davis location twice, but the Napa Applebee's is pretty nice. The club sandwich and salads were solid and our waiter was great. I also hear the bars pretty good too."
Jamie F.,"Napa, CA",3,4,,5.0,8/30/2014,Brian is an awesome bartender. Very friendly and gives great service! Need more like him!!
Tirthankar C.,"San Jose, CA",27,17,1,3.0,5/2/2013,"We went to Napa for a Winery tour and we were fascinated by the ads of Applebee's on TV and they definitely did not disappoint! The waitress staff was really friendly and restaurant and bar looked great! The food was reasonably priced and tasted awesome.  The only downside was that there were 4 vegetarians with us, and there was next to nothing vegetarian on the menu, although in fairness they said they could make anything without the meat or with a veggie patty.  Definitely want to go back!"
Nichole G.,"Vallejo, CA",64,29,7,4.0,2/27/2013,"Very very surprised!!  Ok, so I must say that I am entirely impressed! I use to work for Applebees back in 2007-2008 and their food has totally improved! After working there and finding out how unclean they were.. I was a little hesitant to return. At one point, at the Vacaville location, I did get food poisoning from the nachos. It stopped me from eating there up until yesterday. I'll try and keep this short.. My family and I decided to come to this location because it is close to home and we were celebrating my step dads 50th birthday. Because of my last experience I wasn't so thrilled but agreed to go. We walked in and were greeted by a really nice hostess. She asked how many and my grandparents were unsure because my family is huge and we never know how many is going to show up.  She was understanding and waited until we were ready to be seated.  She set up two tables and our server was over in a very timely manner.   He pointed out that we could order from the menu or the ""Presto"" machines on the tables.  Those things were cool! I ordered my food and within 15 minutes my food was brought to my table.  My dinner was delicious. I had a Chicken sandwich and fries and my family enjoyed their dinner as well. Overall, I'm glad I gave this place another shot. Friendly staff and good food at a decent price :)"
