daniel p.,"Napa, CA",50,25,54,5.0,6/15/2014,"This applebees has something that no one else has... Linda W. Is the best server ever!!!!! We like to visit applebees for the French onion soup and hot wings.  Tonight we were graced with the fine service of Linda, one of the best servers we have had anywhere.  She was fast, pleasant, and knew what we needed before we knew it ourselves...that's top-notch service.  I, myself, am a restaurant manager, and service is key.  The manager even stopped by our table to make sure we had a good time.  We will be back, and if you find yourself in the mood for the best French onion soup, ask for Linda...tell her I sent you! :)"
Jordan W.,"Napa, CA",7,22,15,5.0,8/1/2012,"Normally, any other time Applebee's would have scored a three or lower; but the service tonight was immaculate, and the food was hot, and everything was well timed as far as how quickly we received it. Gotta give some love out to Teika, she is a shift lead here, and if you ever catch her on her shift, ask for her for your waitress. Absolutely a lovely individual. Bazinnnga!"
Kenny R.,"Napa, CA",337,165,215,2.0,9/28/2009,"Why did we go there?  For the large quantities of re-heated frozen food?   The ambiance?  I know, just kidding. The servers were very nice and seemed to enjoy being there.  That's always a plus.  But the money spent and the time that elapsed while trying to get my fill wasn't worth the experience the menu was printed on.  A stiffness was present in the air in that place and I couldn't shake it.  Denny's across the street at 2 AM has a better atmosphere.  Well, I think I appreciate the clientele better at Denny's.  They are there to get away from somewhere else, not to fill up on food that will leave you feeling emptier than when it all started."
Rev. M.,"Hayward, CA",0,86,,2.0,11/11/2014,"Went here on a Veteran's Day.  In several areas in the restaurants it smelled strongly of homeless (unwashed clothes) smells.  Would never go here on Veterans Day.  The grilled cheese does not taste anything like Fairfield's.  Fairfield's is delicious.  They overcook the fries in Napa until they taste hard like tasteless powdery pretzels.  The Thai dressing on the shrimp salad was way too salty and strong, thereby, destroying the salad.  The service was good."
M C.,"Napa, CA",7,17,1,2.0,12/22/2011,Applebee's is awful. You can keep reading if you want but the first sentence sums it up.  Twice in three weeks had an awful meal here. Service was not bad but the food was crap.  I would love to write an extended review but...why?  This place is horrible.
Izah O.,"Vallejo, CA",53,8,1,3.0,2/22/2014,"So.. Ate here tonight, and it's been the second time I ordered Savory cheddar salmon, served with a very small amount... The first time I had it, it was a good serving and not dry at all.. They either need to fire the chef or hire a better cook! Other then that, our server was awesome! Her names Linda, very good customer service, she deserves a promotion!"
Robin J.,"Sonoma, CA",4,2,1,1.0,9/2/2014,"I walk into any applebees with the expectation somewhere slighty above that of a Denny's.  It's a moderately nice place to dine when you have a large party like we do as our extended family gets together for birthdays or any celebrations with the standards that we're not going to break the bank, and we aren't going to get food poisoning.  Last night however, both my son and my niece, ordered the french bread pizzas.  Everything was going as expected our waitress was superb and even mentioned that my son's pizza was burnt as soon as she brought it to us.  I'm not usually the one to complain and I never send anything back, but burnt french bread to this degree is basically inedible and when the entire meal is comprised of this bread with cheese and tomato sauce its hard to overlook.  I accepted her offer to return the meal for a replacement of an actual edible french bread pizza.  The rest of the meals started rolling out of the kitchen to our party of 13 and my son recieved his replacement pizza.  One of the last to come out was my nieces french bread pizza which was basically drowning in cheese.  We pulled back the cheese only to realize it was the same pizza we had sent back earlier, completely burned but camouflaged with cheese.  Needless to say it was a slap in the face that they were trying to pawn unedible pizza off on my 3 year old niece.   We made it aware to our waitress and she was appalled by the cooks who resent this off to the table.  She took it back into the kitchen and by this point we were all looking at our food differently, what else do the cooks resend from the kitchen?  The manager was sweating bullets when he arrived to our table and offered to comp the $5 pizza of our $200+ bill.  That was not nearly enough to regain our business especially when they regained the money by charging us for our birthday ice cream that is supposed to be free.  Our waitress was great but the food was subpar as was the experience.  Napa Applebee's you will not be getting our regular $200+ business again."
Karen C.,"Napa, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/9/2014,"Supper bad service! my husband and I went to dinner with four other friends. The hostess said your server will be with you shortly boy was she wrong! We waited for 30 minutes and no one seemed to care to ask us if we needed something to drink or eat! The same two waiter's walked by about ten times and never bothered to help us. On top of that the restaurant was dead for a Saturday night only about eight tables in total with a full staff, so they can't say it was to busy to help us! They will not be seeing us for a very very long time!"
Ashley E.,"Napa, CA",4,12,,5.0,8/17/2014,"I've been to this Applebees many times and typically its just ok, but a few nights ago my sister and I stopped in and it was really good! We both got the honey pepper chicken and mac and cheese, which is always delicious, but I think what made the difference this time was our service. Nick, our server, was very attentive and he always kept our glasses full and made sure we got everything in a timely manner. We'll definitely be back!"
Ed W.,"Saint Helena, CA",29,24,1,1.0,2/3/2014,Ate at Applebees yesterday afternoon with my family. Finished the meal which was delivered at the same time as our appetizers so no room on the table. Food was OK and the initial young man who was the greeter was inattentive and seemed unprofessional. The silverware was dirty. WORST OF ALL my wife left her Droid Smartphone on the table and we noticed a block away from the restaurant. We came in and asked the manager and employees if they had it and they said no. No one was seated at the table we were using nor even seated around it. We tried calling it and someone hungup.  It appears that one of the employees took the phone.
Christina G.,"Napa, CA",2,18,,1.0,1/11/2014,One star because I like the mozzarella sticks and the staff is friendly most of the time. I wouldn't go there for anything other than a drink. The food is just DISGUSTING at any Applebee's really. It doesn't taste like real food like they advertise on TV. I no longer go there except for if I'm invited to some social outing. I'd rather have a TV dinner and i hate TV dinners. I've found hair in my food multiple times. If I were you I'd take a laxative after. You'll need it.
SairUh B.,"Napa, CA",33,20,2,2.0,11/8/2012,"Everytime I eat at Applebees, I always have a bad experience with their food. This time I thought to be safe I will stick with a salad. I tried their new jalapeno spicy chicken salad that the menu and waitress described as being really spicy. I don't eat a lot of spicy food and it was not spicy at all. The chicken was chopped up into the size of a piece of corn and couldn't get it onto my fork. On top of that, it was a very sweet sauce that just did not mix well with the flavor. Was very disappointed again with their quality of food and the description on the menu matching what you actually get."
Jamin H.,"Napa, CA",5,26,15,2.0,7/30/2012,"Went there on a monday night, the place was okey busy, two stars at the max, had to wait a while until we could order, the food was petty good except for few things, ordered side of fries which never came through, pecan spinach apple salad came with no pecan and apples, later found out they were out of Pecan and just forgot to add the apple in the salad lol jalapeno shrimp had everything but the spiciness and jalapeno flavor haha, i guess this only happens at Applebee's, nope not going back there again."
Chelsea H.,"Sacramento, CA",502,34,33,5.0,5/12/2012,Our 5-star rating is completely due to Jen our server. We were hungover and simply too lazy to go anywhere else. She made the trip worth it with her personality and humor. The only way we'll come back is if she is our server.
Cindy B.,"Napa, CA",2,2,,5.0,10/22/2014,im so supprised  this place does not have more stares i love applebees great service and good nice place to have a get together with friends.
Samanta V.,"Petaluma, CA",323,873,80,1.0,1/27/2011,"Came here while killing time in Napa with two friends. Good Cherry Lime aid. That's about all I can say good about my trip.  FIrst off we waited almost 15 minutes on a Wednesday night.  The place was ""busy""  but not packed.   And certainly there were a lot of seats, but instead, we, and several other people were held like cattle at the front door.  Seated, the server popped over, and then forgot us.  then he popped back, and forgot us.  Then one of us got the salad he'd ordered, but it was 15 minutes later (and the arrival of everyones food) before utensil's were brought to eat the salad. Everything that was fried, Chicken Sandwhich, Fries, Won Ton Tacos, Motz Sticks, boneless chicken wings, tasted of Freezer Burn. Not just a slight hint, but really bad, which tells me they probably aren't sealing up their bags before putting them back in the freezer.   ICK. ICK. ICKY.  I wonder what else is in the kitchen...  After all this, we finally found the server to get our check.  A trip to applebee's shouldn't take nearly 2.5 hours on a Wednesday night.   Won't ever be coming back here."
Ruiqiu K.,"Loma Linda, CA",32,580,7,4.0,8/1/2010,"I give them an extra star for their excellent wait staff who remain pleasant and professional when you ask for separate checks. I know it's a pain, but when they graciously say yes without complaining, I am more inclined to tip more than my usual 20%. As for the food -- I wish I could like it more. I mainly come in to decompress after a hard day. Their mozzarella sticks leave much to be desired. Their spinach/artichoke dip was overly greasy from the cheese. Their burgers are good -- standard fare. And I did try their orange chicken: Crispy, the way I like it. But I also happen to be the type of person who likes my food drowning in orange sauce. If I were to order again, I will ask for more sauce. I don't drink, so I can't say much for their alcohol. But I did like how their ""perfect margaritas"" come with their shaker containers. My friends love their beers on tap. I had a plain lemonade on a hot day , so that was refreshing. I am embarrassed for all of the birthday greetings the wait staff has to do when there is one. I don't come for the food, but for the people I'm with. And when we're happy, that's what counts."
Ed R.,"Livermore, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/21/2015,"My review is not based on food nor food service, but on policy. I work close by and usually bring my lunch to work. Recently I forgot my lunch and briefcase and decided to enjoy a more leisurely lunch break with a more substantial lunch. After entering the bar area and being ignored for five minutes by a bartender who was engaged in a heated discussion with the ""regulars"" about a construction project, I ordered a beer. I was told I needed an I.D. I am 64 years old... I look 64 years old... I act 64 years old...I did two tours of duty in Viet Nam... My wallet was in my briefcase, so a half hour away at home. Yes, I was told it was a ""policy"" to require identification. Yes, it is not the bartender's fault, but there should be some reasonable application of this policy. I left the restaurant, deciding to vote on this policy and treatment with my lunch dollars and will not return, nor will I recommend it to anyone (I work in a hotel close by and am often asked to recommend easy,convenient restaurants). In fact, as a cranky 64 year old who could have probably USED a beer, I will also expressly tell people to NOT go to Applebee's. Management needs to put some reasonable parameters on this stupid policy."
Lewis A.,"Sonoma, CA",48,37,6,5.0,12/17/2012,I eat here serveral times a month and each time I get great service. It nice to be able to get in and out within 30 minutes. Food is alway hot and tastes great. I tried the new electronic ordering and bill pay last week and everything was correct and it knocked about 10 minutes off my visit by being able to pay at the table.
Mark H.,"Napa, CA",3,23,2,4.0,12/29/2011,"We stopped in at the Rutherford Grill but were told there was an hour and a half wait. Too bad for them and their stuffy overpriced food. We decided on our old favorite, Applebee's. You can't go wrong here, the food is great as well as the service and the price. And one more nice thing is every time we go there something new is on the menu to try. Good job!"
