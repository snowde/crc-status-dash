Corey M.,"Neenah, WI",3,11,1,3.0,5/16/2014,This location is very hit or miss.  The food is generally consistent at about a B+ rating.  The service is either amazing or slow and poor.  I've had problems with my salad coming out with my food or right before. When we've had complaints the management staff has not returned phone calls.
Keri B.,"Appleton, WI",2,20,17,2.0,9/14/2017,I was driving back home with a friend and we both needed to grab a bite to eat.  Decided to stop at Applebee's right off the highway.  It was around 4 p.m. so we got seated right away.  Waitress (Rebecca) waited on us right away and and brought us our drinks (I had water). We waited for about 10 minutes before she came back for our order. We ordered 2 for $25 and we ordered boneless wings for the appetizer  and we both ordered  the ribs. I try to stay away from potatoes so the options were green beans and broccoli. I've had broccoli there before and it was bad like it was cooked too long in the microwave.  I did order the green beans and asked if I could get a salad as a side and she said it would be $3.50 as my 2nd side. Sorry I'm not going to pay $3.50 upcharge as my second side of lettuce. Rebecca recommend that I should get a double side of green beans so I did.  The Boneless Wings was good but there was a lot of breading and not much chicken. Our entree came a few minutes later so we weren't done with our appetizer. My water was empty so I was hoping she was going to bring me some more water but she didn't. A few minutes later she came back and asked if everything tastes good and I told her the rib taste good  but the green beans were super watery. She didn't say anything so my friend said yes and the green beans are very blah for having garlic parmesan and bacon on it and Rebecca laughed and walked away. For her recommending me to order double green beans and wouldn't even offer something else what's not a good sign.  We both got done eating and the waitress brought us the bill. She took our plates away and seeing that half of my plate was still full of watery tasteless green beans she still never said a word about it but she finally did ask me if I wanted some more water. I did say yes but  it was a little too late because we were leaving.  I'm sorry but I don't think I ever plan on going to Applebee's again.
Phillip S.,"Oshkosh, WI",42,29,1,1.0,5/15/2016,"I have been in this location often. Tonight's experience was the only time it has been bad.  Ordered the 2 for $25 sirloins and paid the extra $6 to make them each 8 oz instead of 6 oz. Shared the mozzarella sticks. I had the garlic mashed and broccoli sides. Friend had the bacon cheddar red potatoes and the rice blend (don't remember exact names). I also asked for butter for the broccoli.  Mozzarella sticks were out in less than 5 minutes. The were not hot and the crust was hard like they had been sitting under a bad heat lamp for quite some time and just thrown in the fryer long enough to re-crisp the breading.  Friend's steak was great. His potatoes were so undercooked he had to cut them with a knife and ended up sending them back and getting a baked potato instead. His rice had several clumps of rice that were stuck together so as to not even be thoroughly cooked.  My steak was a mass of fat and gristle that was undercooked and tough. It did, however, have good flavor. Mashed potatoes were warm but I couldn't taste any garlic in them. The broccoli was cold (as in close to room temperature) and did not even take the chill off the butter I attempted to melt on it.  Not saying I won't go back but it will be a while."
Catherine J.,"Neenah, WI",3,12,,2.0,4/10/2016,Ordered nachos no jalapeños ! Bite into them . Tasted the jalapeño juice . Must have picked  the jalapeños off before serving it !  Shame !  Some individuals can't tolerate those food items . Mentioned something to waitress was ignored .  Ordered ribs cold . Same behavior . What a shame!
Andy W.,"Neenah, WI",1,22,,2.0,2/22/2014,"While the staff is great, the food isn't so.  The mozzarella sticks were pretty tasteless, and the orange chicken was spicy in some areas yet bland in others.  The portion size was large enough however.   Seems to be way overpriced for the level of food offered."
Zoey D.,"Oshkosh, WI",0,4,,1.0,2/28/2016,"Stopped for dinner last night, took 20 mins for our server to come so we could order drinks party was ready so we ordered right away since it was taking her so long, two of us got salads as an app and one got chips and salsa which took another 20 mins to reach our table. Waitress came back a few minutes later to ask if we wanted our food held under the warmer or brought told her to bring it didn't see her for another 10 mins . Had to ask multiple passing waitressss for refills, straws or condiments ."
Mateo J.,"Oshkosh, WI",17,9,1,3.0,2/21/2015,"Very nice waitresses. Eaten here many times. And only had one issue which I personally received a phone call, and the situation was resolved with care. They could however could hire more experience Cooks and bartenders.  Overall a good atmosphere."
Shawn V.,"Neenah, WI",0,28,6,1.0,10/25/2014,Go easy on the salt.  God everything here must come premade and want is with putting my small piece of chicken on color chips? So many better places to eat... try tbell if you are drunk and looking to make a bad decision.  This place will just make your $40 in drinks come back up.
Jeanna G.,"Neenah, WI",21,21,1,2.0,11/17/2012,"I know, I said I wouldn't eat at an Applebee's again, but when you have a coupon for a $5.99 burger, fries and a beer you can't go wrong.  Also, this Applebee's was in a different state and city. Should be better than last time, right? Hostess was friendly, and we didn't have to wait long for our server. She (her name was Noelle, something like that) was nice, until we told her we wanted the burger deal, then the attitude started it seemed like. The only (and I stress, THE only) exclusion was the beer, you could only get Bud Light or Miller Lite, no cheese exclusions, or so I thought. Well,  THEN she told me I couldn't get anything else but American...!? I requested Swiss on mine, and she rolled her eyes at me. Nowhere on the coupon did it say you could only get American cheese. Then she dropped off our beers without saying a word, and walked away. After my husband requested mayo on the side for his fries,  we never saw our server again. What if there was a problem with my burger's doneness? Oh, and that's another thing - this was the first Applebee's where I was asked ""pink or no pink"". Every other one I've been to always asked how you would like your burger cooked (medium, medium well, etc).  When we got our food, our original server didn't even serve us.  The good thing, I will say is that I did see the manager in a pink shirt, floating around checking on everyone. That's a huge plus, but still not enough for a 3 star and above review here.  There was a server in the section we were in, checking on her guests quite often (cheerfully I may add - complete opposite of ours), but we were the ones that were ignored. I even saw our original server, checking on OTHER guests except us.  It wasn't even that busy, so there should be no excuse whatsoever to forget about a table.  The food was good, cooked to order. I've had the burgers before and they always come out correct. If it wasn't for the food this review might have only received one star. The second time I saw the manager, I stopped her and asked for the check. Also, I wanted to let her know about our server not really doing her job. The manager apologized, and told us that she would have a talk with our server to let her know that forgetting about us was unacceptable.  Then we get the check, from our original server (hmmm, what a surprise), with a fake smile on her face. When we got the check, we were not offered a dessert or anything like that. The other server, happily suggested desserts to her tables. I feel like, just because we wanted the special, and one ~tiny change with the cheese, doesn't mean we should have to be treated differently. Seems like every time I come to an Applebee's, the service gets worse. Not the managers but the servers. Work on that, Applebee's. You might lose a customer for good if you don't."
Heather L.,"Des Plaines, IL",67,245,44,1.0,4/3/2011,"I know I know, no self described foodie should ever eat at an Applebees.  But when you're driving up to the great north woods and you want something right off the highway and you don't want McD's there aren't always a lot of options.  And I can't say I recomend this one. I  haven't been in an Applebees in probably 15 years and it will probably be another 15 before I return.  This one has wierd decor that doesn't know what it is.  Photos of 80's tv stars, framed high school uniforms, motorcycle photos and photos of family boating on the local lakes. I ordered the 550 calorie mango shrimp and rice.  It was ok but I remember Chili's has a better version or at least they used to a few years back.  The Skinny Margarita was just awful and at $6, I regret not sending it back after first sip.  It tasted like canned lemonade with no alcohol.  My daughters mashed potatoes off the kiddy menu were the highlight of the meal, creamy and yummy and my Mom's spinach salad, while overdresssed was hearty and yummy.  The one bite brownie was burnt and inedible but it was only a dollar so I just didn't care. The service was excellent!  In fact, they were so nice, I hated to complain about anything.  But I can't say I will go back.  While driving through Neenah I would stop by Soleil off of Bell Street instead and get Mexican."
Amy H.,"Neenah, WI",1,1,,2.0,3/3/2015,"I normally don't have any problems at this location, and I had absolutely NO issue with the wait staff, but tonight I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, and the ""chips"" that came with it were nothing but a grease ball of tiny tortilla particles.  I got maybe 6 large ""chips"" and only about two of them weren't glistening with whatever oil/grease they're fried in.  When I order chips, I hope to get chips.  I don't really think that's asking too much."
Amber E.,"Neenah, WI",31,21,,4.0,6/9/2014,"I've had good experiences doing the carside service. It's super easy to order online and pick it up. I don't even have to get out of the car. This last time, I ordered for the office because it was our manager's birthday. I made a note on her order that she was the birthday girl. The Applebees staff made it extra special by drawing smiley faces on her box and even included a small sundae. That was so nice and thoughtful! It's the service that will bring me back here. (the food was just so-so)"
Chase G.,"Neenah, WI",129,3,5,5.0,4/22/2011,It is only another Applebee's but this one in Neenah is a stand out. The steaks are normally cooked to the correct temp and always timely. The servers are nice and always seam to remember me and my drink (long island for $1.99 but no pepsi sub cranberry) I normally stop in for drinks but a late night half priced app always hits the spot. Ryan the GM is delightful and friendly he seams to really enjoy his job and you can see it in the staff and the food. For only an Applebee's it sets the bar for the rest of them.
Haafsah F.,"Menasha, WI",0,1,,4.0,5/3/2014,"Service was great and the food was average but honestly DO NOT get the orange chicken, the rice tastes so bland and all the chicken tastes like it was fried then slathered in spicy barbeque sauce and the vegetables taste cold and dull. So word for the wise go  , but don't get the orange chicken."
