Gwo S.,"Hyattsville, MD",0,45,149,4.0,12/24/2017,"No complaints about this Applebee's. Our Server Payton, was fantastic. Food was great. Grilled Veggies were done perfectly. Ribs were meaty and very tender. Specialty sweet potatoes were tasty but maybe a little too much butter. $1 Long Island Iced Teas with no limit. They obviously weren't the best, but for $1, how could you complain???"
Veronica R.,"Wilmington, DE",13,19,1,1.0,12/7/2017,Every time I come here I am dissapointed. This will be my last time giving them another try... This is the worst chain Restraunt in the area...The portions are always SMALL and expensive. Everything tastes bland and previously frozen.. nothing I have ever gotten at Applebee's has ever been good ....  don't waste your money here !!! You will not be satisfied .
Tony J.,"Tokyo, Japan",238,430,40,4.0,9/18/2016,"My dad wanted to get dinner one night. He suggested Applebee's. I'm not a big fan of these large chain restaurants, so I tried to resist, but to no avail. He loves Applebee's. LOVES it. So we went, and I wasn't expecting much. But I was incredibly and pleasantly surprised by the food and the service. The appetizers (I guess some call them apps, but that just confused my dad since he thought we had to download the app to order some things) were pretty good. The chicken pasta dish I got was very nice, and the sirloin dish my dad got was nicely cooked and well-seasoned, though he had a bit of trouble the next day since he doesn't usually eat a lot of meat. The service was also spot on. So this Applebee's has to be the best Applebee's I've ever been to. I'll be back since my dad loves this place. And now with the 2 for $20 dinner meal, it's incredibly affordable as well."
Zwany C.,"Boston, MA",0,11,13,1.0,5/10/2017,"One star because I had no choice. Wow oh wow I don't know where to begin! I dined in with my mother on 05/07/17. Our servers name was Lindsey and she provided the WORST service I have ever experienced dining wise.   I'll try to keep this review as short as possible. Lindsey introduces herself and asks us what we would like to drink. Mom gets her usual sprite and I opt for the Mango drink. Shortly after she brings us our drinks, we begin giving her our appetizer order. Boneless wing bites and beef nachos please! During that time I also ask for two waters. Eight minutes later she comes back to our table and asks "" Did you guys order appetizers?"" --really? Our response ""yes about 8 minutes ago""...she flips through her note pad and finds are order. Ok weird. Whatever, she must have forgotten. Five minutes later we receive our apps, but wait a minute, there are NO plates or utensils to enjoy these apps with. I get up from the table and hunt Lindsey down for some. Strike one. As we are enjoying our apps with great conversation we realize that we havn't received our waters yet and at the point it had been about twenty minutes since we asked for them. Here comes our server ready to take down our entree order when I inquire about the waters. She repeats "" oh, two waters also?"" and I reply ""yes the two waters I ordered 20 minutes ago."" ( I know I was a little snappy with my response but at that point I was getting a bit frustrated) To be fair she did apologize. Strike two. As we begin reading out  our entree orders, I inform her we would like to do the 2 for $25 deal. Mom gets the 1/2 rack baby back ribs and I ask for the Sirloin stir fry. Lindsey asks what two sides I would like for my stir fry (found the question odd since I ordered a stir fry but I play along since ""she the server would know better then I"") and opt for broccoli and mashed potatoes. A different waitress brings out 2 1/2 rack of rib dishes. I tell her that I didn't order ribs. Lindsey approaches us after over hearing the mess up, apologizes, and goes back to her note pad to recheck what it was I ordered. ""6oz sirloin with mash and broccolli"". Like OMG. No, I ordered the stir fry not the sirloin. I then went to tell her that the sirloin wasn't even a choice entree for the 2 for $25 deal. Come on! Finally a gentlemen (most likely the manager) brings out the stir fry ( mom's almost done with her dinner) and ugh the broccolli was still partially raw and there was little flavor to the dish. I didn't eat it. At this point I'm soooo frustrated I start tearing up. I mean $50 dollars for this dinner experience was so dissapointing. I quickly ask Lindsey for to go containers. I proceed to wrap up the leftover apps and stir fry. Now for the cherry on the ice cream sundae to top off the worst of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. As Lindsey shows us how to pay for our bill using the little tablets they have on the tables, she accidently spills my mango drink all over our table. HAHAHA. Like the the night wasn't awful enough that you had to go ahead and finish the job. All she could say was sorry through the whole dinner. I know this is a harsh review but, she was very forgetful and disorganized. What a sin. She did offer to remove the drink from my reciept. Oh jeez thanks. As we were leaving they sat another table in her section behind us. They were there for 5 minutes when we started hearing her say sorry to them. Uhh ohh here we go again."
Brandon V.,"Kingston, PA",128,7,,1.0,10/13/2017,"Staff was friendly, but seemed not happy to be working. Ordered a 12 oz top sirloin, with bacon green beans and mashed potatoes. Beans and steak were cold, over cooked when ordered medium. Chocolate brownie wasn't worth the wait for dessert. Overall unimpressed and would not return. Visited 10-13-17."
Paul H.,"Chester, MD",1,47,7,2.0,10/31/2016,Been here for an hour and 3 people either got their food served wrong OR poor waitress service.   Don't come here. Lol. Poor at best it's sad too since applebees has a decent reputation oh and they have the AIR on.... really ?  It's 50 outside
Tyler B.,"Newark, DE",0,13,,1.0,9/29/2017,"The manager sat us at a table, we sat there for 10 minutes no one ever came. Moved to the bar food took 45 minutes"
Brianna W.,"Newark, DE",23,14,3,3.0,5/17/2017,"Been to this location plenty of times! Definitely an average place to eat so I never expect to be dazzled. There was no wait and we received service immediately the waitress was attentive and outgoing, the food however was not hot when we got our meals.we asked the waitress if it could be heated up, which she did for us. The meal itself was pretty good but since it got reheated it didn't taste the same, it was a little drier...."
Jamie K.,"Naples, FL",72,614,5,3.0,7/25/2016,"Went to Applebee's after trying to find some other restaurant,  but could not locate anything else, to be honest. Spinach dip was not too good, microwaved and bland, cold in the middle. Stirred it up and it was fine. It came with a film on top from the heat lamp. Beer cheese dip with pretzels was ok, microwaved again. Salad was good and fresh. Kids meal was a good deal. Service was very good. Just a fair experience overall. Never been been a huge fan of Applebee's and still am not, only when I am in a bind."
Someone H.,"New Castle, DE",0,24,2,1.0,3/5/2017,"Service is terrible, you may see your server when you first get there....then when they want your damn money."
Mary M.,"Winchester, MA",32,16,,4.0,7/31/2017,"On a recent trip to Delaware, we visited Applebee's 3 times!  The food is good, consistent, service is good, drinks are good, great value and plenty of seating.  We ran in for a drink, had dinner twice.  Something for everyone!  Would go back in a heartbeat!  We don't go to Applebee's at home, but we sure have to try it based on this one!"
Deborah G.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",36,15,12,3.0,6/2/2016,"Stopped here for lunch. Had the hot shot whisky chicken with cheddar jalapeño mashed potatoes. Was all okay, nothing great. Would stick to fiesta lime chicken next time. Service was very slow for lunchtime and not many people dining in. Table was sticky. Had the option to pay at the table on that little machine which let the waitress know I was done because she never checked on me after receiving my food. Oh well! Typical Applebee's."
Luke T.,"Finksburg, MD",0,7,,1.0,9/10/2016,Wow.  My wife and I are staying at the Hampton Inn and wanted a quick drink.  The staff is clearly having a bad night.  It was some time before we were noticed and barely greeted despite the restaurant being nearly empty.  We ordered a Long Island Ice Tea and Margarita.  Awful.  Pure sticky sweet and truly disgusting.  Neither drink was suitable for human consumption and both were poured from some stale mix pre made and sitting in a white plastic bottle for who knows how long. We waited several more minutes in vain trying to order beer.  No luck.  I wanted to talk to the manager but my wife pulled me away.  We left $10 and walked out.  The bartender didn't say more than three words to us the entire time we were here.  Avoid.
Caitlin L.,"Ashland, OR",0,5,,1.0,8/7/2016,"Never again.  Our server was young, but eager to please. Absolutely no problems with our server.  The bartender however, thought she ran the place.  After a very long day (my brother in law is currently fighting for his life at Christiana Hospital) we decided to eat a late dinner at Applebee's, located next to our cheap motel.  My sister waited at the bar, politely saying ""excuse me"" whilst the bartender intentionally ignored her. My sister waited patiently and again said ""excuse me"" the bartender said ""what?"" Chris politely asked if they made a drink, to which she replied ""no"" and walked away.  My sister left the bar, and returned to her seat. Our server took our orders, and drink orders writing down what we wanted to make sure she didn't miss anything.  When my father got his martini, it was not made correctly, when my father informed our server we all noticed that she felt bad, and intimidated to talk to the bartender. So my father went to speak to the bartender. The grumpy bartender quickly pushed blame onto our sever claiming ""she wrote it down wrong"" then looked at the server and said ""I made it how you wrote it down"" (it doesn't matter who's fault it is, it's wrong).  I had ordered a mango, jalapeño, margarita. Which was tasty, so I ordered a second one. Our server was busy with her other tables, so I went to the bar to order my second drink. When I asked the bartender for a second drink she rudely and abruptly said your server will take your order, and walked off.  Another server apologized for the bartender and ordered me a second drink, at the point I had, had enough of this woman's attitude, and apologized to the server for having to deal with the bartenders attitude. To which she replied ""oh she's nice, once you get to know her."" When my margarita arrived, she bartender intentionally put in too much jalapeño mix, to the point where my throat was burning, eyes were watering, and my face turned red. I asked mr father to take a sip to see if he thought it was too spicy. He did.  I was so angered by this little b!tchy bartender that I immediately asked for the manager, and informed her of her rude bartender that intentionally try to burn me. As well did my sister. The manager assured us that she would have a talking to with the bartender and credited us $30 on our bill. I hope that bartender lost her job, and respect from her coworkers.  Wish I could remember her name, but she was a heavier gal, with brown hair, with a bad attitude."
Rory S.,"Buffalo, NY",1,33,20,4.0,12/7/2015,"I had the chicken quesadillas, a Caesar salad and a dessert. Chicken quesadillas were very good. The Caesar salad would have been better if the dressing was served on the side because there too much dressing on the salad. I got the butter pecan Blondie dessert. It's a vanilla brownie served on a hot skillet with a scoop of ice cream with pecans sprinkled on top. And that's not all! There's a hot cream cheese maple flavored syrup served on the side also. That dessert is to die for!"
Anissa Z.,"Leominster, MA",85,64,95,5.0,3/17/2015,Fish and chips are great. Excellent service from Matt. They also had a st. Patrick's day themed drink menu!! Awesome
Andrew K.,"Bear, DE",0,5,,1.0,7/30/2015,One of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. The staff was extremely slow. It took them at least 7 minutes to refill my glass of water. As well as 30 minutes to get the appetizer out and 50 to get the actual meal out. I arrived at the restaurant at exactly 9:00 PM and I didn't leave until 10:14 PM. The restaurant wasn't packed with customers either there were about 3 other families that I could spot in my side of the building. When I did get my meal which was a well done Sirloin. It was nothing but tough and cold.
Christopher M.,"Newark, DE",0,16,8,1.0,4/14/2016,"My wife and I went to this Applebee's around 11:15pm, and upon walking in there was no person to greet us, so we got some menus and sat next to the stand where the greeter should be posted. So there was one server at the bat another one serving tables, not one of them even acknowledge us or asked were we being helped. So we sat in the front until 5-8 minutes later 5 servers including the manager (Jana Litwa) where she was at the bar and she also didn't acknowledge us  nor the other servers including the ones I spoke about at the beginning of this review, so my wife got up and went to the bar and asked one of the servers who is manning the front and the server looked at my wife like she wasn't suppose to ask her that and had a very negative attitude. So when the server came back out I was so angry with the lack of service I asked for the manager. So Lana came out and my wife made a complaint about the lack of service, she didn't take ownership but she was making excuses to where I finally asked her for her name a the cooperate phone number. We will NEVER EVER go to this Applebee's AGAIN, and as a veteran I will tell all my follow veterans not to eat there."
Reggie D.,"Bear, DE",0,5,,2.0,1/23/2015,"sat at the bar, server was lukewarm. ordered a half rack of ribs which were allright, but it came with the saddest pile of fries that had obviously been sitting around for a good long while. asked for more fries and finally got some more that were hot and fresh.  would not recommend."
Nicole B.,"Newark, DE",19,453,331,4.0,2/9/2015,Stopped in here for lunch with a co-worker.    We each got a burger.   Had the cowboy burger which was delicious!  Co-woker had the quesadilla burger which he also thought was delicious!   It was very quick and we had plenty of time to get back to work.
Catherine B.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,15,,1.0,4/2/2012,"Applebees ""CORONARITA"" was a Joke! And WAY OVERPRICED. $7.50 for ""beer and water""??? C'Mon, Applebees!!! We expect better! I got a better value at OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE for a mixed cocktail containing Rum, for only $6.25, The drink was $5.25 and the rum shot was $1.00.   I'm only getting Ice Tea from Applebee's in the future! (:"
Tynisha H.,"Washington, DC",203,118,705,4.0,3/13/2013,I haven't had Applebee's in years but surprisingly it was GOOD! My server was really nice and happy and very efficient. I had the bourbon chicken and shrimp and it was really good everything was cooked to my liking! My bill was $28 I had 2 entrees a appetizer 3 margaritas CAN'T BEAT THAT!!!
