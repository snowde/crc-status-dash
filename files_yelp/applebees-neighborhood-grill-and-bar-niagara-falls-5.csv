Geno T.,"Canton, MI",2,21,171,4.0,9/18/2017,Apple bees wasn't so bad. My girlfriend and I shared a ordered of  the kitchen sink for breakfast. It's was enough for the both of us.
kozue a.,"Streamwood, IL",113,6,34,2.0,9/3/2017,"This was probably the worst  service we received in Niagara.  Our server Marie is either racist or has some kind of discrimination against non-caucasians or couples as we had to ask for coffee refills and couldn't even get a thank you out of her when she gave us a check while she was super friendly towards two older Caucasian ladies around her age that walked in. A different couple even walked out after ordering coffee.  This would usually earn a 1 star but other employees seem friendly and maybe she personally has problems. Anyone coming to Niagara,  be weary of certain individual's poor service.  As for the food, for the amount I paid,  I think fast food serves much tastier food and selection compared here. If anything,  this place should just stick to lunch and dinner."
Drew M.,"Waterford charter Township, MI",108,30,14,1.0,7/2/2017,"Apple Bees is generally a safe bet when on vacation and looking for a quick bite to eat. Boy, were my boyfriend and I wrong when walking into this Apple Bees. The food tasted awful. I got a chicken fettuccini dish if some sort. The cheese tasted wrong, like it was not meant to be eaten.  Not only was the food awful, but the service was awful. We ended up sitting in this place for THREE HOURS. They were about busy because it was a Friday night and apparently some of the staff hadn't showed up. Ridiculous. We would have left immediately after tasting the food, but after giving them our card to pay, we hadn't seen our waitress for an hour. We were furious.  Stay away from Canadian Apple Bees folks."
Megan K.,"Rocky Hill, CT",297,391,1502,5.0,9/6/2017,"We had an amazing experience at this Applebee's. We stayed at The Oakes which is connected to the restaurant, and walked in with our breakfast vouchers, not sure exactly what to expect since in the US Applebee's doesn't do breakfast.  I had some of the best toast I've ever had in my whole entire life, the bacon was perfectly crisp, the potatoes were deliciously seasoned, and the sausages.  I typically don't eat sausage, but I ate the ones on my plate they were so good.  My one complaint is my eggs tasted old and dry, but other than that, it was very enjoyable."
Rami R.,"Los Angeles, CA",183,8,2,1.0,9/24/2017,"I am not surprised that place has 2 stars only !! I went for dinner last night with my mother and son we are visiting from Los Angeles. I been to Applebee's all over the world! The waitress was so Rude and condescending to my Mother a sweet lady !! cause her English is not that good. The waiter is not the problem she is probably a spoiled Ignorant Girl. The problem is the passive manager was no leadership skills and the Management that don't provide good training for theirs staff to deal with different gender, SEXUAL IDENTITY and  RACE!! Especially in a Touristic area like Niagara Falls."
Mark L.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",63,29,5,1.0,8/17/2017,Not even sure how they are in business. I got a coffee it's the  dirtiest cap I ever seen . I asked the writer why is like that she said that is how she poured it .
Thomas K.,"Philadelphia, PA",27,71,52,1.0,11/7/2016,"I was there tonight. Ok, it is not main season and restaurants and streets are empty. It was my first visit at this restaurant chain and maybe my last one. I ordered a steak Sirloin. I ordered medium rare and the was more medium or medium well.  Price for a beer and steak for this quality was too high. I was the only guest at the bar and tried to have a conversation with the bartender...no chance. I was ignored. Interesting experience. First time at this place and never again. If there is an excuse because it is out of the season, they should maybe close during that time."
Edward J.,"Toronto, Canada",50,235,2575,2.0,7/10/2016,"Desperation causes one to do silly things. Going to certain chains guarantees consistency. Decent surroundings and perhaps in a safe neighbourhood could be the reason one visits an Applebee's.  The food is definitely and unequivocally below par. However, my over easy eggs were cooked to perfection. The potatoes were fine. Unfortunately, if you can find the bacon, they were over baked. Too bad restaurants don't fry them anymore. As for the toast; it was fine - however, I am particular with my jams (read Fortnam & Mason), this didn't help my review (but I shouldn't be so picky)."
Nina B.,"Torrington, CT",38,9,,2.0,10/16/2017,"We arrived around 530 pm on a Sunday. The restaurant was pretty deserted. Waitress was good and efficient but not overly friendly. Food was decent but overpriced.The reason for the low rating is the fruit flies. They were everywhere, on the walls and flitting around our drinks. It was gross and unsanitary."
Lindo S.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",91,2,6,4.0,6/11/2017,"2 days in a row coming here and its been a great experience. They were VERY nice & the food was good. I recommend sitting outside when the weather is nice, specially sunny."
Lilly P.,"South Amboy, NJ",2,21,20,4.0,7/30/2017,After walking up the hill from the falls we were thirsty and wanted drinks. Applebees was advertising $5 drink and half off on appetizer. Waiters was unaware of special but the manager Jeff came over and was very pleasant and honored the specials he diffidently made the end of vacation a good experience.
Terri B.,"Martin, OH",0,33,1,1.0,6/21/2017,"I wouldn't even give one star but my iPad made me do it. So I ordered to go the 4Cheese Mac n Cheese dinner. It was a decent portion but they forgot the cheese. When I called to complain, they said it was a gravy type cheese.  Whatever, unacceptable! Then he said 4 other people ate it that day. What? Really? Only 4 people? Gee I wonder why?"
Danielle C.,"Philadelphia, PA",142,36,40,3.0,5/30/2016,The food was good and the service was great. He outdoor patio is a bonus.  Ordered a steak and friend orders a burger. The steak was a medium-well. But I asked for medium rare. No biggie
Shantanu B.,"ON, Canada",35,121,255,3.0,7/2/2015,"Feeling nostalgic we decided on having dinner at the Canadian Applebee's. Holly molly what a disaster! Good stuff: Free 2 hr parking and service. We were served by Jeff who reminded me of much revered capitalism which makes spending money fun in States. He even said to get out before 10pm fireworks to avoid traffic. Much appreciated man! Thanks if you're reading this. M'eh stuff: Built a sampler for $23.99 including Jerk Chicken Tacos, Thai Peanut Wings and Sriracha Shrimps. All good. Decent Margaritas. With a refill. Bad stuff: Fiesta lime chicken roll up. Worse than supermarket cold cut rolls. No taste and they have it listed under 'Spicy' stuff. Accompanying fries were dull n lifeless. And ended up paying $90 for all of this! Avoid, avoid, avoid! Cross over to states instead."
Chris D.,"Sharon, Canada",0,2,,2.0,10/9/2017,"Service is good, food was good until we found a long strand of black hair in the pasta. Case closed."
Brenda J.,"North Augusta, SC",0,8,,1.0,8/12/2017,I am thinking lately all Applebees should be shut down since they have no idea what customer service is.  We walked into a nearly empty restaurant and had to wait nearly an hour for food because there was only ONE waitress on the floor.  They had 3 or hostesses.  Why is that even necessary?? I asked the hostesses if anyone was working over than the one waitress and they responded that the rest of them was not OLD enough to serve food because they could not serve alcohol.  Why not actually employ people who can serve food since you are a restaurant? There's a clever thought.
Sandy S.,"Raleigh, NC",0,7,,2.0,6/11/2017,"Despite being tired and hungry from traveling, we were disappointed by the bagged salad greens, the bottle-poured dressings and the level of cleanliness of this Applebee's. My daughter did enjoy her burger and the fries were good. Not the refreshment I hoped for as we continue to travel toward Toronto, but ... we can say we've been here."
David F.,"Bronx, NY",4,5,,3.0,4/27/2017,"Generally, I love Applebee's, I go there a lot with my family. They have great burgers, fries, and mozzarella sticks. Also, my dad's one most favorite appetizer here was the tomato soup. That was one of the biggest things that was lacking from this place here in Niagara Falls. You should've seen the look of disappointment on my dad's face, he was dying for it! If you have been to Applebee's and normally go for one specific food, I suggest first looking at the menu for this specific place to see if they have it, if it's not there, give them a call to find out. If they don't have what you expect them to, then avoid this place!"
Denny V.,"Pittsburgh, PA",50,152,270,4.0,11/28/2015,No 'breakfast' till 11:00...?  But I have this voucher and all I wanted was a glass of tomato juice... With a little something splashed in...  But sadly- I was turned away.  Guess I'll go back in an hour & 10 minutes...
Hinna H.,"Toronto, Canada",0,4,1,4.0,2/27/2017,I really enjoyed the breakfast at this Applebee's location. The waitress was very accommodating and nice. Everything tasted great!
Chantal O.,"St-Jerome, Canada",1,13,4,4.0,10/12/2015,"We were a bit worried about all the negative reviews this Applebee's received but we decided to be brave and try it anyway. That was a wise decision. We were seated as soon as we walked in. The waitress was nice, service was fast and the food was good. All 4 of us were very satisfied with our choices."
Elki C.,"Jersey City, NJ",43,15,4,1.0,5/30/2016,"Beyond horrible.  Here is the summary. In the Fallsview almost everything is a chain. Perhaps other chains are better than this one. Try them. Don't waste your money here. You will absolutely regret it.  Food- dry, over cooked and took an extremely long time to get out to tables.  Drinks-do not get anything that doesn't come in a bottle. We tried so hard to make this work. Ordered margaritas. Each component was bad. The alcohol was forgotten. Then we ordered two shots of tequila to add in, and the tequila was foul and also extremely watered down. It was sugar syrup in a cup with a few ice cubes and some salt around the rim.  Prices- atrociously high! Almost four times as much as a normal non tourist Applebee's .  Servers- the only reason this post didn't get a zero. The most terrible thing about this experience was the fact that the servers here were busting their butts running around to serve, greet, take care of customers and keep things going. Kudos to them."
Mia O.,"Portsmouth, VA",53,63,65,1.0,7/3/2016,"I had the chicken strip plate with fries. My fries were hard and burnt. I should of taken a picture. The ranch sauce was disgusting. On a positive side my waitress was just ""ok"" and she made sure to add her automatic tip. I wouldn't recommend this establishment."
Robert D.,"Clifton, NJ",66,18,,2.0,1/9/2017,"We were very disappointed at our experience here, I must say the server was very polite, but inattentive, we were done and waited about 20 minutes to get a check, we also waited very long for our food. We had the chicken quesadillas which were good, along with the sizzling shrimp, which was ok, and the dry BBQ ribs which were ok as well. The cherry on top was that we were charged for a dish we didn't order. I did not review the bill till I got back to my hotel. I did call the establishment and was told I would have to go back to get a refund. I just feel that considering the restaurant was pretty much empty I expected a better experience."
Chris P.,"Tustin, CA",60,26,25,1.0,9/24/2016,I would have expected a half-decent breakfast from a chain at a tourist location but was unpleasantly surprised by the expensive low quality meal.  The french toast seemed like it was old bread barely dipped in an egg wash... dry and nearly tasteless.
Chris G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",70,7,,1.0,9/3/2016,"Tourists beware!  We went to the bar and got a few drinks before headng out for the night.  The bill came to $16.49 CAD.  When I asked the bartender what that was in USD she told be it would be $15 even.  She lied!  With the exchange rate the bill should have been $12.69 USD.  I paid her $15 plus a $2 tip and now feel totally exploited! I should have been more aware of the exchange rate, but this is unacceptable and everyone should be warned ahead of time."
Zachariah M.,"Washington, DC",0,4,9,1.0,3/16/2016,"Worst Applebee's I've been misfortunate to eat at.  The price for a Cesar salad is 18 dollars and it's just romaine lettuce with croutons.  That's like 40 cents at the market.   Plus the rotting leaves aren't really my thing Went back a second time for breakfast. This time we used this coupon for couples.  My guess is that Applebee's here is owned by the Oakes hotel.  I basically felt like I was being punished because the Oakes tells me that I had a free breakfast with my stay and then when I go to Applebee's it's limited to two options which would somehow cost 20$  Since when does 3 eggs, 2 slices of brown bread, and potato cost 20$?"
Preety L.,"Brampton, Canada",0,10,3,2.0,3/12/2017,"Had never been to Applebee's for breakfast was given coupon from the hotel so went to try. They don't have a lot of options, I'm a vegetarian so felt the menu wasn't as great. Also had food for my kids they wouldn't aloe me to feed him, as he had allergies couldn't eat anything there. So we left! How ever did go back for lunch after feeding my son at the hotel, the lunch menu a bit better got pasta with marinara sauce super sweet felt like it had sugar in it, got a veggie burger was undercooked! Cost is ok, decor nothing good carpet smelled funny."
Junito T.,"Natick, MA",20,17,3,5.0,7/12/2016,We came here for a quick bite to eat before our long drive home. We enjoy our time here and the meals. The Burgers were good and so was the Service. I have to give recognition to our server she remembered everything we order without writing it down. I tip my hat to Natalie.
Phil A.,"Minneapolis, MN",11,221,12,1.0,7/21/2015,"Carol the bartender was AWESOME.  Great personality, great vibe.  The T.G.I. Friday's across the street let me sit for 15 minutes at the bar so I came here.  However, the bar steals from you.  The employees concede the owners put this ""TIFF"" stealing charge on your bill.  I will be contesting this with U.S. Bank.  Because if nobody stands up to this then nothing gets fixed.   Also, the chicken wonton tacos had almost no chicken, what garbage.  Carol was great managing the whole bar and running food, she cannot be asked to do more or be complimented more, and this was my first time in here.  But #1 STEALING from the customers with the fake stealing tax and #2 the bad appetizer...  ...Applebee's needs to talk to the owner.  And compliment Carol.  (Nice cold beer!)"
Amy G.,"Mountain View, CA",100,749,737,3.0,5/8/2014,The fish and chips is a pretty solid choice--huge portions!
Baldo L.,"Toronto, Canada",13,32,15,1.0,4/8/2016,"The worst breakfast experience ever! The serving of food was poor, unappealing and without any taste. Avoid at all cost!"
Nicholas P.,"Oakville, Canada",45,204,118,3.0,5/19/2014,"This was my first time at Applebee's. There isn't any in the Toronto area (as far as I know) so when I was in Niagara this weekend I took the opportunity to give this place a try for a late lunch.  I ordered a burger from the menu (there was a lot of dishes to choose from but I ended up going with a burger) with a side of mashed potatoes. My girlfriend got the steak (9oz). Both the meals were good, but it was on par with other restaurants like kelseys. There was nothing really differentiating this restaurant and thus I am giving it an average 3 stars.  Overall I would recommend that you give this restaurant a try but just don't expect too much!"
Charles R.,"Mississauga, Canada",14,120,4,3.0,2/17/2014,"On a recent Niagara Falls visit, we had the opportunity to dine at this Applebees for both Dinner and Breakfast the following morning.  We have dined at this location easily 15-20 times over the last 10 years. Dinner was after a day of sightseeing.  It was moderately busy and all the booths were taken so we had a table for our family of five.  I had the Santa Fe Chicken Salad.  For me it worked quite well.  Yum Yum.  Only downside that I have with most restaurant salads is that there was way too much dressing in it.  I should have asked for the dressing on the side and easily dropped 40% of the calories off of this 1200 calorie behemoth. I spent too much time coaxing my younger daughter to eat to notice what the rest of the family was eating.  The daughter had the kids pizza which tasted decent, based on the one bite that I had.  I know my son had Mac and Cheese, which disappeared quite quickly. The food is all standard fare.  We were happy Our server, L, (I won't say her full name) was awesome!  She dealt with the 1001 questions from my three year old daughter like a champ and still remained energetic around her. Breakfast we had J as a server.  We had two orders of pancakes, 1 of fruit loops, 1 omelette, and I had the french toast.  My wife liked her omelette.  My french toast was blase.  It was just bread, with egg wash.  Every chef, except the breakfast chef at Applebees, knows that you put cinnamon in French Toast. Though breakfast here was bland, at least they didn't try to financially rape me like the iHop down the street tried.  For that, we will continue to come back."
Nancy B.,"Lincoln, NE",0,17,2,5.0,8/29/2016,"Fast, friendly service and great food. This is an express restaurant so they do not have all the items that regular locations have but they had our favorites."
Kris U.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",2913,1219,3534,2.0,12/10/2012,"This review has been sitting in my queue for awhile and after avoiding it for sometime I decided to go forth and write it. Ok, so Applebee's this review isn't a reflection of your staff or service to me they were aces. This review is a reflection of your selection and quality of cusine when I visited several months ago for breakfast.  To clarify I used to live in Windsor, ON and I enjoyed many a lunch at the Applebee's there as well as the occasional dinner. Breakfast is certainly not your strongest suit. I had a standard bacon and eggs breakie with rye toast and to mee all but the eggs really fell flat. My request for soft bacon was ignored and I got crispy with a nice tan of black and the Rye toast was cold and saturated with butter (or butter spray - not sure). The over-sized portion of deep fried french fried potatoes didn't do very much to make up for anything either.  While the staff provided some great service, the cafeteria style breakfast felt mass prodced, overdone and with little care or attention. Hard to believe you were empty when we walked in....  My helpful hint: You've done great work with front of house, now time to whip your kitchen into shape. You're in a major tourist area, too many meals like this and people wont be back. I'll give you another shot when I'm back in town next summer - always about a second chance."
jacob m.,"Hamilton, Canada",18,40,1,2.0,12/30/2015,"It's a nice family restaurant but the food is subpar. I watered a $25 steak and it was pretty small portion on sideplate with a couple of potatoes and a few scattered vegetables. It was pretty disappointing. Pizza like it's ordered and tomato sauce right out of the can on it. You can't beat the proximity to hotel if you're staying at the oaks, but walk a little further you can get to a nicer place."
Kit A.,"Toronto, Canada",12,116,12,1.0,11/21/2015,Terrible terrible food and expensive too. Just greasy and blah and we ordered drinks too and they were so watered down. Got chicken and mushrooms and it was awful. Never again.
Sarah S.,"Chicago, IL",4343,2412,14756,2.0,8/20/2012,"What a depressing restaurant along the Fallsview Street. I'm sure there are much better places to eat in the tourist zone, go anywhere else. Seriously when I walked in, it just felt sad inside. Applebee's was right next to the Oakes Hotel we were staying at which meant less than a minute walking to get there. They advertised a $6.99 breakfast special on the sign so we headed on in. When we went in the waitress told us that people staying at the Oakes get 10% off, score! She gave us a breakfast menu with a page of way overpriced items all about $10 on it. The $6.99 special that lured us in was nowhere to be found on the breakfast menu. When I asked about it, she told us what it was, then seemed annoyed when I ordered it. Eh, okay? She wasn't very friendly the whole meal and then forgot to give us the 10% off. We didn't even bother reminding her, just paid our $21 bill (including tax & tip) and got the heck out of there! $6.99 is about as cheap as it gets for breakfast in the Falls, but to advertise it outside, then not on the menu, then get agitated when people order it...seems a bit shady to me! It's dreary and way overpriced! Trust me when I say, this is not the place to dine."
K M.,"Herndon, VA",0,41,,3.0,7/28/2016,We had a good experience here.  Michelle was our waitress every time we went and she was great.  Friendly and efficient. We had the $5.99 breakfast a few morning and it was great. Cheap and just enough to hold us over until lunch time.  We got some appetizers to carry out one night and they were great.  The poutine was good and the Bahama mama was great! It was nice to have it so close to our hotel.
