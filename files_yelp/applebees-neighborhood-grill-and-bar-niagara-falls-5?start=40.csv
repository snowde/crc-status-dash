Zuleika P.,"Bronx, NY",1,55,115,2.0,6/4/2014,"I had breakfast here because it was included in my room fee. The breakfast was horrible. I never expected this from Applebee's. They have a standard meal for customers who's meal is part of hotel rate ( oakes hotel) The eggs were hard, bacon under cooked etc.I was very unhappy and the waitress knowledge this by asking,  why I didn't touch my meal. Never COMPLAIN About Your Food!!!! I doubt I will do breakfast again."
Jorge R.,"Martinsburg, WV",0,5,,2.0,6/8/2016,"Food is too expensive for quantity and quality. I ordered a hamburger and couldn't be order medium well because is their policy, burger was burned on the sides. Service was poor, had to ask for refill and napkins. Won't recommend this one."
Jerry E.,"Honolulu, HI",11,273,1166,1.0,8/25/2012,"Foods are not bad, but the place is filthy!! Not sure why they don't bother to clean the table promptly. Moreover, sweeping carpet after each customer is a must. The whole place looked like a garbage dump, and that is no exaggeration. This place definitely is off my revisit list."
Darren G.,"Vaughan, Canada",6,7,,3.0,11/10/2014,"The service was great but the food not so much.   It did arrive in a timely manner but the quality was far from good.  The kids ""pudding"" was a of the shelf  supermarket chocolate putting .... a bit disappointing for the girls.. We ate there in the past and it was much better. I had a shepherds pie ( to heavy and not so good) , My wife choose a steak and didn't eat it. we are not usually picky."
Alyssa B.,"ASTORIA, NY",188,245,137,3.0,12/3/2013,"I'm not a fan of Applebee's. Never have been and probably never will be. We ate breakfast here because it was conveniently attached to our hotel. They had all the basics.. eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, bread. The first day I ordered eggs over medium with 2 strips of bacon and wheat toast. It came with home fries. They actually cooked my eggs to order, which I think is a very rare thing when you order ""over medium,"" so kudos to the chef for that. The bacon and the toast were standard. My potatoes were seasoned well, but they weren't really cooked all the way through. The second morning I ordered the western, which is like an omelette sandwich. It was huge! and it was actually packed full of peppers, onions and cheese. The potatoes were actually cooked this time.  I wish they offered something a little healthier - such as egg whites, although i'm sure you can ask for that. Maybe a cup of fruit would be nice. Also, I would prefer real milk/cream with my coffee rather than those little plastic creamer cups.  Overall, I think Applebee's met my expectations, but they weren't very high to begin with."
Fred L.,"San Diego, CA",47,100,144,1.0,1/21/2015,Not worth it at all. Many better choices in the area. The food was basic and the portions were small. I had the ribs and my friend have a steak and with no drinks the total was over seventy two dollars. Taxes paid a big role in that. The two taxes added a little over 19% to our bill plus the tip. Total rip off. I would suggest if you have a car drive a few miles out of the rip off area and have a decent meal for a decent price.
Matt M.,"Waterford Township, MI",0,3,,3.0,4/4/2016,Not too bad. Actually good food for an Applebee's. Limited options due to food voucher but you can't beat the location's proximity to the Oakes hotel and the deal with the vouchers.
Niki B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,8,2,1.0,2/21/2016,"This is the worst experience I have ever had at Applebee's. I have eaten at multiple Applebee's and the staff here is the worst staff I have ever seen in a restaurant. First, the barback took our drink order because the bartender was too busy on her phone to notice that we had sat down at the bar, we were literally the only people there. On top of that once the barback told her our drinks, she still took 10 minutes to bring our drinks. We ordered mozzarella sticks; they took 20 minutes to come out. They were cold and tasted awful. The inside was cold and chunky like cottage cheese instead of stringy like it is supposed to be. It took us 10 minutes to get the bartenders attention because she was too busy socializing with her co-workers and gossiping loudly about person issues within the restaurant. Once we finally got her attention and described the issue, she simply said nobody else has complained so maybe it's just you. My boyfriend was pissed at this point; he asked to speak to the manager. After 10 more minutes of waiting the manager never came out. We cancelled our order and left. It was literally the worst dining experience I have ever had. AVOID this place at all costs.  Terrible food and WORST staff."
Julie C.,"Buffalo, NY",93,428,8,1.0,3/18/2011,The food and service is ....well....crap.  I buy here(not really but read the following) because I recieve gift cards.  There is  nothing that appeals to me. Food is cookie cutter variety.  I've tried a number of dishes and all are sub par.  Maybe it's a drinking establishment. I don't know and won't waste time worrying.
Anoj S.,"Black River, NY",6,8,68,2.0,11/29/2014,"Beer was flat. Long island was horrible. Bartender was on his personal phone while he was working. Kitchen was good though, food was good and came out in timely manner."
Jennifer A.,"Flushing, NY",159,272,440,3.0,9/28/2013,"We had 2 breakfast vouchers for Applebee's. It is just like any other Applebee's, there is nothing different really, Canadian or American, they all look about the same, and the food taste the same.  Anyways, if you have the vouchers, you can take your breakfast to go! My mistake was eating in there the first morning. Nothing much to see. Second morning however, we had our breakfast to go, and ate it in our hotel room next door at Oakes, so we can enjoy the Niagara Falls and eat at the same time. Such a nice relaxing way to have our breakfast versus being at Applebee's. Don't waste your time, take everything to GO!"
Jay D.,"Dover, NJ",0,84,33,2.0,2/10/2013,"Our Family came here for breakfast on vacation in June 2012. They lure you in with the $6.99 meal. In order to get eggs you got to order an additional meal or order ""The Sink"" which has it all for $12.99..add a drink and you are at $17. Not bad..but I have had much better.  You are better off eating at the hotel ...breakfast buffet for $20 at Marriott Fallsview Terrapin Grille.  Would definitely skip this establishment for breakfast if I were you."
Chepa W.,"Toronto, Canada",1,8,,1.0,7/15/2014,"I have ate in quite a few Applebee's in the USA and liked all of my experience there, so last night we went there for dinner. There are 4 of us, we were so tired, so we decided to just came out of the hotel and get into the closet restaurant. OMG, it was horriible. This is high season in Niagara Falls, so the place was busy.  The service was slow that I understand: too busy. But all 4 entries: two main-dish salads and two sea-food plates were all terrible in taste and in presentation, yet there were  over priced compared to other Applebee's restaurants I tried in USA.  I do not recomend anybody having dinner there. My 3 friends and I will never go back there for sure."
Sharon G.,"Toronto, Canada",0,106,,2.0,10/20/2014,"came here for breakfast as it was close to our hotel and it looked like it could rain. We have been to Applebee's in other locations many times for lunch or dinner and always enjoyed our food. Staff were friendly and the restaurant was clean. The restaurant must have a relationship with the Oakes Hotel next door as we were asked if we were guests (which we were not). We ordered omelettes and while they tasted ok, we were disappointed by the way they were made. It seemed that instead of mixing our options in, they had prepared a basic cheese omelette and then wrapped/folded this around the rest of the meat/veggies we requested (ie my husband had a whole strip of bacon in his vs bacon pieces). Not we expected for a $13 omelette. Had we known that this would be the case we would have picked something different off of the menu. Thank goodness the coffee was good!"
Manuel Y.,"Mesquite, NV",0,153,37,2.0,10/2/2015,"Very nice wait staff hampered by ""just OK"" food. I do understand that this place is located where a LOT of tourists come so the prices are higher. This point would be fine if they could just kick up the food quality."
CH K.,"Markham, Canada",0,1,,1.0,9/1/2015,"This place was so bad, all the waitresses carries such an attitude. Food wasn't the best and hard.  The service charge was forced onto the bill.  Go spend your money elsewhere."
Fred S.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,32,113,1.0,11/26/2013,"Applebees at the Canadian Niagara Falls  - I'd read the bad reviews about Applebee's but took a chance since there're not a lot of good options at this tourist trap. The other area restaurants also have less than steller Yelp reviews too e.g. Ruth's Chris Steak House, Vinny's, etc all of which were within walking distance from the hotel. It's pretty obvious that the area businesses aren't counting on repeat customers.  Food quality - The food tasted so-so. Those of us that ate fried stuff didnt suffer but my son ate coleslaw and later served penance by kneeling before the porcelain god. Presentation - The presentation is unappealing and that's putting it charitably. Ambience - The interior looks better seen through the windows from the outside. Inside, the seats are uncomfortable and point source lighting over the tables were glaring instead of warm and mellow.  Service - Got seated promptly as the restaurant was relatively empty at dinner time. The service was basic, the server got us what we wanted and then left us alone, only checking back once. It took a while to pay and leave because none of the staff were to be found. Price - Poor value for money.  I'd rather spend $10 more per steak and have a better meal at The Keg (N.B. Didn't try the Keg at Niagara, went to the one in Calgary). Verdict- Fail. Visited on 14 Nov 2013."
Janice T.,"Hercules, CA",224,589,2832,3.0,8/5/2009,"After an 8-hour drive to Niagara Falls, we were so famished that we decided to eat at the restaurant nearest our hotel (Oakes Hotel).  I really was not in the mood for burgers or steaks so I looked for a menu item that included rice.  I settled for Applebee's signature (at least in Canada) Crispy Orange chicken. It was nothing great.  I was not able to finish it even though i was really hungry.  My husband's order of short ribs was okay but the noodles that came with it fell short of his expectations.  Our aunt was not impressed with the noodle tower, she found it to be undercooked.  The appetizer sampler, the baby back ribs, and the cheeseburger were good though.  Moral of the story, when ordering, stick to their specialty.  Why did i even bother ordering a chinese dish in a place that specializes in grilled items? duh!"
Karen S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",59,6,,4.0,6/27/2013,"We ate here before returning to the Oakes hotel.  It was probably a pretty typical Applebee's experience, which I feel is pretty important in this town because I thought many other restaurants were so expensive and served such low quality food in comparison to the ""normal"" locations.  This was pretty much what I'd expect from a family style chain.    The kids got your typical kids' meals -- 2 ordered pizza and 1 ordered mac and cheese.  The price (I believe it was about $5.99) included a drink and dessert.  The dessert choices would have been ice cream or chocolate pudding but unfortunately the were out of them.  The waitress offered applesauce as a replacement.  They weren't hungry after eating most of their dinners, so we declined.  If perhaps another more tempting dessert had been offered I'm sure we'd have accepted!   My husband and I ordered from the 2 for $25 menu.  We both got the Fiesta Lime Chicken and shared the Queso Blanco appetizer.  It was pretty good.  I will definitely try to replicate that chicken recipe at home.  We also each had a beer.   The plates were terribly hot -- not only an inconvenience but also a reminder that the food has been under heating lamps.  However, the food was tasty regardless.   The decor was typical Applebee's -- busy and bright.  The table was a little sticky -- clean but could probably use a refinishing.  The service was extremely friendly, attentive, and helpful. Again, this isn't fine dining but especially with the prices that reflected those outside a tourist district, we were pleased.  We'd definitely be open to coming again."
Steve F.,"Dearborn, MI",0,18,,1.0,7/4/2014,Very expensive! I was surprised how many people walked in and walked out. We were very hungry and got food here. The food was as expected but since it is close to the falls the cost is 10-20% higher than average.
