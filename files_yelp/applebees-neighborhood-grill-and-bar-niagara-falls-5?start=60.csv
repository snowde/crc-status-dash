Josie T.,"Whitby, Canada",0,7,,1.0,1/21/2015,"This place is a dump!! And so are the staff. We went in for breakfast. The place was empty.  Finally after standing there for a few minutes we get seated. . The bench was ripped with cotton sticking out everywhere. So I said to the girl, can you not sit us anywhere else in this restaurant. Cleary the bench seat is torn.  So she sits us somewhere else. So we start looking at the menu and about 5 minutes later another couple comes in and gets seated right behind us. Right away they are asked if they would like 2 coffees. Meanwhile we haven't been asked if we would like 2 coffees and we have already been here for almost 10 minutes now. So we looked at each other. Put our menus down and got up and walked out the door. The girl who seats the guests at their tables says have a nice day! We didn't say a word.  This place is definitely boycotted in our books. What a disgrace!! And if been forced to put a star. Far as I'm concerned they don't deserve a star!"
Kylie H.,"Avon Lake, OH",0,12,4,1.0,7/5/2014,"Absolutely horrible. The food was okay, but everyone was rude, the food came late, there were waiters throwing things around to each other, laughing loudly, making disturbances. It was horrible, do not go here."
Mic M.,"Livonia, MI",36,155,23,3.0,8/1/2010,"Well as the other reviewers said, the prices here are crazy expensive considering this is a chain and since we all know what the prices in the states are. That being said, the location is good, and the service was decent. I found the soup to be quite tasty and the rest of the meal was fresh and good as well. I would come back to this location if in the area, at least I know what to expect."
Kari J.,"Chicago, IL",5,7,1,1.0,6/14/2011,"I don't usually bother with chains, but this experience was so bad you have to review it just to hopefully help others behind you avoid the same bad experience.  Like others mentioned - the prices and service are not good here. Waitress was surly and rude, put off by customers' apparently annoying questions, and was so extremely slow, despite just a few diners for a 12:30pm tuesday lunch. Had I only had a decent wi-fi connection, I could have checked yelp first and not made such a bad decision for lunch.  Here's hoping you're reading this before you've made your dining decision. Good luck!"
N W.,"Cambridge, MA",0,24,,1.0,11/28/2011,"Disgusting!! We had never eaten at Applebee's before, but it was disgusting! Ribs from non-castrated swines..yuk! A pasta with not fully cooked shrimp and a sauce that tasted like puke..yuk! Tried the strawberry cheesecake shooter to have something in my stomach after dinner..yuk!  Don't go here!"
Lady T.,"York, Canada",34,43,9,1.0,4/24/2011,"DON'T EAT HERE! This is the first bad review I've ever written. Usually, I ONLY feel compelled to write after a great dining experience but I must warn people abt this place. Maybe they know that since this is a vacation spot they will always have foot traffic and they don't have to care about attracting customers to come back.  I ate here with my boyfriend after walking around niagara to wait out the line up at the border to do some shopping in buffalo. When we walked in to this place it was dark and tired looking but we still decided to stay anyways. We were greeted and seated right away by the hostess. I ordered a Tropical Chicken Salad and the bf ordered a Asian noodle dish. The food took a long time to come and when it did I wished it hadn't. The salad wasn't made with fresh lettuce tasted like old iceberg and romaine lettuce from the discount rack, the balsamic dressing tasted just like pure white vinegar and the diced fruits were mushy and flavourless (how does anyone get fruit wrong?). The asian noodle dish was incredibly small that had we of measured it, it would have been at 1/2 cup in a measuring cup the green beans were a mushy dull green consistency like they've been recooked more than once. It was so bad that I had to wonder the only way u can get food this wrong. well I can only think that it almost seems deliberate. The whole time I was eating i just couldn't help but think i  could have gone to Wendy's for a chicken salad @ $8 that would haved tasted 10x better.  The experience felt like we were dining in a runned down nursing home where people deliberately send their hated parents. All in all the service was decent but whoever makes the food here have lost all passion as a cook."
Binu C.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,18,7,1.0,1/7/2014,"Very expensive. Portion was too small. Almost $20 for a steak plate with 3 small blocks of steak is not acceptable. To take the order the waitress took 10-15mts, food arrived after 30mts. The taste of the food was average. Never again. Please avoid."
Catherine T.,"Toronto, Canada",0,4,,1.0,3/18/2011,"I went with my husband and son and was seated where every time the outside door opened we had to endure a cold wind. Our meal took forever to come, we were ready to leave. I had fish and chips and the fish was oily and the tartar sauce awful! Instead of fries I had a cesaer salad and it was bland. I also ordered a cherry limonade that was sour as hell.  My son had teriyaki shrimp with noodles and there were hardly any noodles and no taste. The Oreo milkshake was good. My husband had a fettuccine dish and the sauce was watered down and not nearly enough for the dish. This is a never again restaurant!"
SteveH H.,"Buena Park, CA",0,48,,4.0,5/30/2014,"I think this Applebee's is the best in Niagara Falls area (that's mean the rest of them are pretty bad!!!).  Ask for the meal for 2 menu, which is cheaper, more for your money.  The service was nice."
Dave B.,"Oakville, Canada",1,37,3,4.0,10/2/2011,"The food was not bad. I paid $50 for 2 entrees (coconut shrimp & a bacon burger). The deal also allowed for a free apetizer which was delicious, the standard spinach dip. However I was kind of dissapointed when I showed my hotel room key and the 10% off deal did not apply to me due to the 2 entree deal for $25. All and all not too bad, just a little expensive. Then again it is niagara, yet it was applebee's"
Deena R.,"East York, Canada",0,1,,1.0,1/15/2012,"How shall I start... we ordered a couple of chocolate milkshakes and were given vanilla ones. When we questioned the waitress, she insisted they were chocolate (even though they were pure white and tasted clearly of vanilla). The dishes for our appetizer were coated in remnants of someone else's meal.. The ribs were not a wise menu selection.. they were overcooked and there was very little meat on them. Walk past this one, even if it's cold out...."
Danial S.,"Mississauga, Canada",6,1,,1.0,6/24/2011,Terrible. Bad food. Expensive. What is 'American' style food? There's no character. This chain clearly doesn't know what it wants to be. Very very disappointed.
