Teresia B.,"Sherwood, AR",0,1,,5.0,12/27/2017,"Great service at the bar!   Love Adrian, JJ, D, Angel and Jamie have always provided the best service each time I come!  Make me feel at home and love the $1 LITs!!!"
Guillermo C.,"Rockville, MD",74,86,47,5.0,6/8/2017,"Corporate. Is a word that has a negative connotation behind it and should rightfully be thought of that way. Shawn my bartender completely through that out the window for me. I'm from D.C. and in Little Rock for a business trip that has been absolutely brutal. I came here for a meal and a drink and walked away with so much more. The beers were nice and cold and the listening ears were wide open. What a great bartender. He was attentive, caring, and a true professional at his craft. If you are ever in Little Rock come to Apple Bees and make sure Shawn is your bartender."
Glen G.,"Arnold, MO",5,103,,2.0,4/23/2017,"I'm about done with Applebee's.  It seems like it's always something at one of their restaurants.  Whether poor service or disappointing food. In the case of this one in North Little Rock, it was a dinner that failed to live up to what the picture showed on the menu. I had no issues with the service which was pretty prompt and the food arrived in a fairly timely manner but when my Southwestern Steak salad arrived I was pretty disappointed,  In the menu photo you'll see 6-7 slices of steak with plenty of corn and black bean mixed in.  What actually came was about 4 - 4 1/2 slices of steak and the plate piled up with salad greens and tortilla strips.  Somewhere under that was a smattering of of the corn and black bean mixture.   Don't get me wrong, the salad itself was quite tasty but I got an awful lot of lettuce and tortilla strips and not a lot of the better stuff shown in the picture of the dish. This isn't the first time I've had this happen at an Applebee's, in fact, one of my previous reviews from West Memphis had a similar issue.  Despite the good service and the overall good taste of the food I don't feel like I got what I paid for when it came to the meal.  It was basically a very overpriced salad.   I don't think I'll be frequenting an Applebee's anytime in the near future."
Paul P.,"North Little Rock, AR",237,71,12,1.0,12/12/2015,The pictures of the sign should tell you everything you need to know about Applebee's here. They don't even care enough to bother to turn on the lights. In all honesty I can't review the food because no one ever bothered to even come to our table. When we walked in the server was working on something in a folder and it took her a few minutes before she looked up at us. The restaurant was less than half full. She then turned to one of the waitresses who was sitting on a stool talking to somebody and asked if she was working. The waitress said yes everybody's working. The could've fooled us because we never got anyone ever come towards I will. We even hit the call button where you can call for a white or waitress. No one showed up so we had to get up and leave.  This restaurant obviously need some management ASAP.
Samantha G.,"Minooka, IL",80,1,,1.0,7/22/2017,"Horrible service! My now wife and I went to this Applebee's the day after I proposed. Yes it was weird to want Applebee's to celebrate such a special occasion but my wife loves the food. It was the day after Valentine's Day and the place was pretty empty. We had a few different servers and each server was worse than the one before. We got our food about an hour after we ordered and when the server gave us our food she said ""you guys are brave to come in here the day after Valentine's Day"" I was in shock that was the excuse for the slow service. The bread on my wife's sandwich was soggy and disgusting so she asked for a new dry slice which they never brought her. The service was horrible and we haven't been back since!!!"
Patrick P.,"Springdale, AR",155,119,16,2.0,1/10/2016,"Went there on a Saturday night. They were not busy but seemed understaffed. The server had quite a few tables but was doing his best. The manager was too busy flirting with the 16 year old waitress to help his staff, then he sat down at a table. The food was just average too. The server did a good job all things considering. If they don't make some changes they won't be in business much longer"
Ashli N.,"Maumelle, AR",127,3,,1.0,7/11/2016,This place is fucking ridiculous to say the least. Server was nice but people after me were sitting & munching on entrees while I was still waiting on a drink and appetizer to come  . I ordered a quesadilla burger  with bacon cheddar fries and I got something that looked like a grilled cheese sandwich with plain fries . Waited on manger for 15 minutes and she never came out. Please don't come to this dump!!!
Tae B.,"Jacksonville, AR",0,19,5,2.0,11/10/2015,My boyfriend and I went Saturday the waiter was nowhere to be found obviously he wasn't insight of his tables because we didn't even get our drinks. One of the waiters said he didn't know he had a table which I don't think is very good service..we ended up going to carino's where the service and food were excellent!
Daniel R.,"Houston, TX",1,19,2,1.0,12/27/2015,Very disappointing. Waitress took so long to go to our table that by the time she came by everybody knew what they were going to order (6 people) took at least 15 minutes to get my salad and the food took so long that we left before getting out food.
Skeeter T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,1,1.0,5/22/2015,"Food was good but very disappointed in the service. Our server/bar tender, a girl by the name of Ryan T I think, had the worst attitude I'd ever seen in someone working in the restaurant business professionally. I don't know what personal problems she was having but you don't bring them to the work place. She didn't even acknowledge I was there, when I'd make an order she made no eye contact or said anything. I think if you're gonna be like that don't get a job that deals with customers, somebody needs to put that chick in the back killing rats and taking out trash. She sucked, left 0 tip and if she's ever working there I'll never ever eat there again... Hey Ms. Attitude, smile more, life is short :)"
Christina B.,"Baytown, TX",132,568,542,3.0,10/8/2011,"If the word ""meh"" ever had a place..it would be for this restaurant.  We went in kinda late after a 7 hour car-ride and we were starving and needed something with alcohol in it. I ordered a sour-apple martini and my husband had a good ole' Heineken. My martini was not sour..at all. It was straight up vodka (which, surprisingly, I was okay with),  I ordered the ""cowboy burger"" with fries and was so disappointed. The burger was huge, well-cooked and had plenty of toppings, but it just tasted wrong. I was expecting it to be a little like heaven in my mouth and it just didn't please me at all.  Our waitress was friendly and efficient. Everything was clean and we had a pretty good time, but we probably won't be back. For 40$ for two meals and two alcoholic drinks, I expect some pretty darn good food and this just did NOT hit the spot. Overall, it was alright, just not for us."
Amanda G.,"North Little Rock, AR",2,5,,1.0,9/30/2014,"Tonight we went to this place for dinner and I can safely say we will NEVER go back. It took thirty minutes to get our drinks, another thirty minutes for our appetizer. Then finally our food came and it was stone cold! This place served me cold icy cold shrimp, which is a health code violation. My children's food to was ice cold. My husband has worked in the food industry for most of his life and is ""serve safe citified"" he knows the dangers of eating under temp fish as should the guy running this place yet when my husband showed him the cold food he acted like he could care less, it's no skin off his nose if I got sick with Norwalk virus from their food.  That man has no business running any restaurant if he's going to allow people to be served cold food!!!! Plus my Long Island iced tea was just water down lemon juice and a splash of water down rum, guess the bar tender was to busy shooting up meth by the back door to do her job correctly.  The only good thing about this place was Taylor our waitress, she was slow but the only person in this place that knew how to do their job.  We will be reporting this place to the health department in the morning..."
Suzuki T.,"Jacksonville, AR",0,13,,3.0,11/2/2015,"The table we were put at was not wiped down. Additionally, we waited at least 15 minutes for a server to come get our orders. Furthermore, we did not get silverware. I do not know if they're short on staff but definitely not recommending this particular Applebees. The service needs to get better. Food wise...it is what you expect from chain restaurants."
Brian S.,"Smyrna, TN",0,10,7,5.0,6/25/2014,"Had the Artisan Grilled Chicken Ciabatta sandwich and it was awesome. Very moist chicken, great artichoke spread, and the chiabatta bun was very soft and tasty. Paired it with a Sam Adams Summer Ale and it was a great lunch. On a side note even the fries were tasty."
J P.,"Coweta, OK",18,1,,1.0,4/12/2016,"The worse service I have ever had, the food was great though.  We came into the restaurant on April 12, 2016 at around 3:30 there were two other tables besides us.  Our server did not seem to be well trained, she didn't even know what balsamic dressing was, so I settled for ranch, brought us sweet tea, we didn't say sweet tea, another server finally brought our salads, our server Danielle brought our food and that was the last we saw of her.  She was sitting at a table eating and rolling silverware.  We finally went to the bartender (she was the only one to apologize) to ask for our check, she told the manager or supervisor, a small blonde lady that we needed our check, she yelled at Danielle to bring our check, never asked us how our meal was, never got refills, etc, etc.  It seemed like most of the employees were having a get together at a back table in the bar area. I have been a restaurant manager for years and I would not tolerate this from any employees and I am not even a hardass, but do you see anything wrong with this picture?????  So disappointed."
T. C.,"Sherwood, AR",73,91,33,4.0,7/19/2011,"This location is my ""Cheers""..ok they don't know my name but they know my face.  This makes me happy; along with the fact that my jello shots are right there as I take my seat at the bar.  Of course there are always bad and good servers, but I have always had a great experience here.  Because this is a chain all the dishes are standard most people that dine here already know what they like. The quesadilla burger is my friend, the won ton tacos delish.  I go after 9 because the appitizers are all 1/2 price as well as a brewtus for only 2.49."
Bob S.,"Coventry, RI",4,104,8,3.0,10/29/2014,"Just an average Applebee's, mens' bathroom was disgusting, lunch service wasn't that speedy either"
John H.,"Webb City, MO",0,35,,2.0,10/29/2012,"We arrived and the hostess seated us and told us who our waitress was and took our drink order.  My beer arrived a little over a half hour later and my wife's coffee about 10 minutes after that. The waitress said there were only two people waiting tables and it would take a long time for our dinner to arrive.  It did.  We were warned. Finally, a manager started serving the meals that were backed up in the kitchen while the waitresses took orders. The manager brought us our meal and the steak I ordered was supposed to be medium rare.  It was overcooked. We decided to have the brownie bites for dessert.  The waitress returned to tell us they were out of brownies."
Deb T.,"Jacksonville, AR",10,9,,1.0,8/9/2014,On my birthday after 20 minutes couldn't even get a waitress to come to our table. They were only 6 other customers in the place. Hostess had BAD attitude. Ruined my day completely. Walked out due to NO service at all. To busy cleaning windows than taking care of their customers. Never going back there.
