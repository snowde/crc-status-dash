Cerena P.,"San Marcos, CA",339,188,1966,4.0,11/3/2017,"The dollar margaritas during the month of October brought me here so much! The service here is fantastic, the bar tender is on top of it as well.  Everything I've ordered has been so delicious. It's applebees; it's casual and average, but this location has always been really great. The steamed broccoli and ribs are surprisingly really good and tender.  Great drinks, friendly service, great food."
Lin D.,"San Diego, CA",224,157,27,2.0,10/26/2017,"This place is one of the BEST non-customer service I have ever experienced! It was a Wednesday. Not too busy.  Coworkers and I sat down for some drinks and food after work. We sat at the bar, since we were only doing appetizers and really just wanted to have a couple drinks. (Trust me, you'd want a drink after our work days too) We were fair warned by another patron at the restaurant about how bad the service was. We left it go, ""maybe it will be different with us."" 15 minutes after sitting down, still no one. (Not even for water) We set our menus to the side and continued our conversation. 20 minutes later, FINALLY, someone came. We made our drink order, server was nice, no complaints. Except our drinks took a little too long. I'm unsure if they had to go to another country for the tequila, or if they were just........ slow. Margarita's WEAK btw. I know this, so I ordered a beer.  Order food. Came out normally. I had to ASK FOR NAPKINS AND FORKS. Didn't ask how we were doing. If we needed anything else. Just drop food and turn around and go. That's what robots do. They also don't get tips. Choose wisely servers/runners. (I used to work in a restaurant over 10 years ago, so I know how YOU are suppose to be) Drinks came out slowly but it was probably a good idea, since I down beer like water.  Long story short, we talked to the manager and he was kind enough to give us a discount and apologized (this was excellent since a lot of places don't; please see other reviews). Will I go back? Let's just say the time I went to this place before this time was over a year ago. So it may be about a year or so before I go back. There is better restaurants with better service.  This place needs to teach their servers that their job is to SERVE/SERVICE. SERVER = SERVE/SERVICE. If you don't like you're job, you should probably get a job at like Walmart, because like the honey badger, they don't give a s*** either."
Mimi S.,"Laguna Beach, CA",651,497,522,4.0,5/23/2017,"I am giving it 4 stars because Alexander, the server, was phenomenal but the menu is lacking!  Where is the strawberry coco smoothie and the cajun shrimp pasta? These were the reasons I use to come here and it has been a while because we don't have a location South Orange County but I am sad.  It seems like the menu was altered to fit some kind of low calorie agenda.  Their watermelon margarita was so so....Dave & Busters has one that is much better.  I liked their chicken tortilla soup but they didnt include lime wedges and the chicken tasted canned.  Anyways, I was dying to have a blondie but I was too full and skipped dessert.  Their bathroom were disgusting and needed cleaning and the paper towels were out. Again, this is a 4 star rating because the server was great!"
Dino F.,"Oceanside, CA",150,24,10,4.0,9/6/2017,"My wife and I were out and about doing some shopping for a new fan during the little heatwave we had.  After finally finding one, we realized that we skipped right by lunch so we decided to give Applebee's a try as I have not been to one in many years.  We had the Firecracker Shrimp Cavatappi and the Double-Glazed Baby Back Ribs - HALF RACK.  both entrees came with salad and we topped it off with iced tea and a black berry lemonade. The service was outstanding and the food was delicious.  Ribs and pasta were a nice surprise the next afternoon when I realized that nobody had eaten our leftover in the house.  A day later and it was still delicious."
Amanda S.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",50,11,3,1.0,12/19/2017,"I don't normally review nor do I come here because I knew this would happen but this place sucks. Bartenders are not real bartenders. She acted like she's never opened a bottle of wine before, service is slow. Multi tasking is not a thing there.  Hopefully this isn't their only prospect in life... and she just rolled her eyes at us after she charged us the wrong price and we had to prove her wrong. Kthxbye.  The attitude on this girl is unreal. PAM is her name. I'm embarrassed to be reviewing APPLEBEES, but I'm a server and have been in the industry for a long time. This is insane.... dammit Oceanside...."
Dawn H.,"Oceanside, CA",2,17,8,5.0,12/26/2017,"I totally love this place. The prices are really reasonable, the staff is friendly and attentive, the menu is awesome, and the food is always great. I've never had a negative experience here."
Dama P.,"Oceanside, CA",23,17,3,5.0,1/5/2018,"Great service and great food!!! I came here to just have dinner and was greeted by all the friendly staff!!! The manager Francisco Lorenzo provided such a great service to each and every customer in his restaurant by continously asking every customer in his location if the food and service was good and at there expectations, which no manager is required to do that. Being in management it really amazed me that Francisco was able to handle a really bad situation with a customer that apparently just wanted free food,  Francisco multiple times tried to fix the issue with great patience and providing great service. The bartender Sophia was an amazing bartender she provided great service and great drinks!! Micah was also a great server went unfortunately he had to deal with unhappy and ignorant customers. Overall, I usually would go to chilis for food and drinks  but honestly after observing the great  service and how amazingly the staff are able to multi task and handle situations out of there control I will BE COMING HERE ON A DAILY BASIS AND BECOME A LOYAL CUSTOMER NOW BASED ON THIS EXPERIENCE!!! AGAIN GREAT SERVICE AND GREAT MANAGEMENT!!!"
Danii Q.,"Carlsbad, CA",72,1,,1.0,12/9/2017,Overall terrible food and service . Hostess looked bothered seating us . Food was  really bland and cold Mac and cheese . the salad had maybe 3-5 pieces of lettuce . Will not recommend to anyone.
Eva L.,"Oceanside, CA",230,180,485,1.0,7/9/2016,"I'm not a huge fan of this Applebee's unfortunately. My husband and I recently moved to vista and we met one of his buddies here because he was leaving the Marine Corps to back home. It looked a little busy and the bar was empty, so we chose to just sit there! Okay - so the only positive is that the bartenders/waitresses are awesome. Both experiences with two different ladies have been wonderful. Their very attentive and always checking up on us & I appreciate that.  The negative was that our friend arrived a little late (15 minutes per say). We had ordered our food before him. He came, sat down, ordered....And he happened to get his food before us (Given he ordered the same plate as my husband). I would've been ok if we got it shortly after, I'm not impatient. But we waited about a little over 30 minutes for the food. Now I'd say that's a little bit too long. And, it's happened both times! It's a little frustrating but given we don't eat out a lot, we probably won't be coming to this location again :( Definitely try something else!"
AShley H.,"Vista, CA",88,136,71,2.0,9/21/2017,"I enjoy this place a lot. I was very unimpressed with my service I received on Tuesday. It was not busy, very quiet. I was brought drinks promptly, ordered promptly, and was told that I would receive my appetizer within minutes. Everyone who came after me was served and had left. She was nowhere in sight. 45 minutes later, I receive my app and my food at the same time.  What is the point of the app? I usually would speak to the waitress and state I would like to speak to her superior, but she just ran by and put the bill on the table. Very disappointed with the service I received from Yesenia. I will continue to come here, I will be asked to sit in a different section."
Jordan A.,"CA, CA",128,2,,1.0,11/10/2017,Awful service from Alex and super super slow. Took more than 20 min just for a refill of water. Absolutely ridiculous amount of time for any food whatsoever. And then he puts in for an appetizer that no one at the table even ordered. Very disappointed in everything. Will not be back.
Heidi I.,"Oceanside, CA",373,515,1161,5.0,8/8/2015,"Ok, so we go here when it gets too late to get dinner pulled together and we have had a long day at work and with whatever million things we have to do after work.  The food is pretty solid and so are the drinks.  We particularly like Jennifer the bartender, and Keith  she works with when we are in there normally, and  SOPHIA is amazing. She's what they call The Bomb Dot Com.  They have a late night happy hour, lots of specials, and new menu items are pretty good.  Sriracha Shrimp is on the rotation now, as well as the fancy version of nachos with pork on top.  The wonton tacos are good, we usually get apps to share.  Drinks are good, etc. We always sit at the bar now, as service has not always been quite as dependable if you're not at the bar top, although that could just have been our experience...servers have bad days too.  We've never had BAD service, we've just found it's better at the bar top. The biggest reason we go here, is because Chili's is also right there, actually equidistant from our house.  And whenever we're up in the air, as happened earlier this week, we decided to go to Chili's because we had not been there in a long time, we've frequented Applebee's on those work nights when we are too tired to make dinner....and now we remember why we always end up at Applebee's.  We walked into Chili's and sat for 5 minutes with no greeting at a bar table.  Moved to the bar top and the bartender also ignored us for a full 5 minutes.  So we left and went to Applebee's.  Sat at the bar and were helped immediately.  It's a similar restaurant model and the service is WAY better at Applebee's.  We consistently get bad service at the Oceanside Chili's. Thanks for not sucking, Applebee's!!!"
K S.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,1.0,9/11/2016,"Clean, we'll managed Applebees. I had two problems though. One was with the smoothie...the bartender poured syrup around the glass then put the smoothie in switch made the smoothie overly sweet to say the least. (I saw him do that to a few other drinks too). Second was I ordered my burger pink and it came well done, the American cheese reminded me of a cheap fast food burger and my egg was far from runny. The manager seemed very irritated with me trying to prove me wrong. Funny enough, she was the first person I noticed when I sat down and she seemed very unhappy. I can't see myself coming back here for food again. 3 stars for appeal and cleanliness. I'm adding to this since this afternoon to report that I have food poisoning from Applebee's. I am 90 percent sure that it was the burger when I asked for medium they gave me mooing cow that I ate 2 bites of it before I realized it was very rare. Definitely changing my 3 star to a 1"
Katlyn C.,"Oceanside, CA",0,5,1,1.0,7/15/2017,"I'll just start out this review by saying the table right behind us had a used NAPKIN in their salad. How does that even happen?? The manager came over and tried making excuses for why it was there. In the end, they still had to pay for their food, which I thought was bull. Now for our table, my husband ordered a steak stir fry, or whatever it's called. When it came out, it was literally just rice, broccoli and steak. No sauce, super super dry. It's supposed to be a stir fry?? We told our waitress and the manager came over and asked what was wrong. After we explained it to her, she sarcastically asked if our water tasted okay. Super rude, not professional, I would give this place no stars if possible. Overall, I'm never coming back to this restaurant."
Svetlanna V.,"Oceanside, CA",0,6,,4.0,11/5/2016,"I really enjoy the selection they have here. If you're on a diet, they still have a lot of healthy options and customizable dishes. The service is nice, always refilling drinks and accommodating. Only issue I have is that one time I got a steak, medium well and it was super dry. I prefer just cooking juicy steaks at home."
Audrianna H.,"Casa Grande, AZ",0,9,3,5.0,4/16/2017,"Honestly, this 5 star review is mostly because I was thrilled to death at the service. Vacationing in Carlsbad, we'd tried several To-Go options and every time something was wrong with the order, not ready for a long while or things missing all together. So when we pulled up into the Curbside designated parking spots, we were not hopeful that things would be going our way. However, we were pleasantly surprised that upon parking someone was immediately out to the car (I accidently the out the receipt, but I believe the girl's name was Falascity - forgive the spelling of its wrong!). Food was out quickly, but most importantly, was 100% correct. Will eat here again."
Kristen W.,"San Marcos, CA",0,31,,4.0,5/5/2017,"Had dinner here last week with my daughter.  Had an awesome server named Jordan.  She was very friendly and professional. Extremely attentive to us throughout our dinner and made our dining experience the best it could be.  Thank you Jordan, you are an awesome sever.  :)"
Lenae C.,"Oceanside, CA",91,3,,1.0,1/7/2017,"I've been here a few times and usually had no problems, but that changed the last two times I went. The second to the last time I went with my husband I was pregnant and asked the waitress for a virgin strawberry daiquiri because I was craving the taste and when she told the bartender you could hear him very clearly say ""so they ordered a smoothie."" I know it doesn't seem like much but I thought it was rude. The last time my husband and I went the waitress was so focused on him she almost completely forgot I was there. We had ordered and my meal came with garlic bread. She forgot the bread and said she would bring it out. Well again she was so focused on him she would come and refill his drink without it being half way gone and ignored that mine was empty until I said something and took about 20 mins to get the bread out by then we were already about done with our meal.  Haven't been there since and don't have any desire to return."
Madeleine W.,"Fallbrook, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/29/2017,"If I could give a negative star I would. Food was cold, service was ass. When I say ass I mean ratchet sweaty cottage cheese ass. It was happy hour and the waitress recommended their new watermelon sangria So I ordered it. I ended up not liking it at all. The taste was overwhelmingly sweet. I told the waitress and she blatantly gave me attitude and rolled her eyes as she walked away to ""see what she could do"" about getting me a different drink. Some Betty Boop looking ass manager came over and asked what was wrong with the drink and when I told her I couldn't possibly finish the drink she proceeded to make me feel guilty for wasting the beverage. Whatever happened to ""the customer is always right"". I can deal with shitty food but being hospitable to you're customers is of utmost importance and I definitely didn't get that here today."
Reginald S.,"Oceanside, CA",33,6,,2.0,3/5/2017,This place use to be good. Went today with the wife and first our appetizer came out frozen in the middle so they take them when they came back half of the filling was gone in most of them it was the cheeseburger egg roll. Then my wife meal was well done when she asked for medium and her vegetables were cold. Then the server decided on the tablet that she rated a 20% tip. Not will not be going back.
Perez P.,"Oceanside, CA",0,1,,3.0,5/19/2017,"Well I'm a loyal customer to this Applebee's for a long time !!! But on this day may 19 we came to this location and found ourself with bad customer service starting with the host Alice she wouldn't let us sit in our usually spot near the bar even though the tables were completely open! Even though it's open seating at the bar! Then she brought the manger to me which was zack he didn't have any customer service he couldn't even tell me that I couldn't seat there even though we always sit there with no problem but today wasn't lucky . But, the bar tender was very friendly and made my evening great with her great costumer service Sofia is great! She always has a big smile on her face and makes it all great again!"
Kenny V.,"National City, CA",14,26,8,1.0,6/6/2016,"I ordered food from applebee's in oceanside to take home with Kenny Vazquez (my husband) and there was a spider running around in the bag. I personally hate spiders and ran as soon as i saw it. My husband looked in the bag and killed it when he found out what it was. We immediately called and asked to speak to a manager, we were  transfered to someone who asked us what was going on, then said it was impossible to have a spider in their bag as their bags are laid flat in a box. They said we could drive back and they would look at it then maybe make our food again. It was late we were both tired and to have that simple of a response just solidifies the decision to never return there. I am no expert in spiders but I know it was no normal daddy long legs either ."
Marie M.,"San Diego, CA",2,41,4,1.0,2/20/2017,"The first time I got foo from here I got food poisoning- vomiting the whole 9 yards the next day.   This time I got the toughest piece of meat I have EVER EVER been served in my entire 31 years of life.  What, was the cook (and I use that term loosely) too busy trying to get their next fix and left my steak- which I asked for medium rare- to look after my meat?  Also they didn't give me steak sauce OR season my steak even though I asked for the steak w/ the Cajun seasoning.  Useless swine."
Chelsea C.,"Oceanside, CA",175,5,1,1.0,1/21/2017,"This experience gets one star for the bartender Kristen that took care of us, she was great and she wasn't the issue at all. My husband and I went in on Saturday Jan 21 at 1pm and sat at the bar. We ordered Buffalo Wings (which were great), I ordered a burger and my husband ordered a steak. He ordered his steak Medium Rare and it came out Medium Well, so he asked for a new one. The second steak came out cooked on the outside and COLD on the inside. YUCK! Not only that, the bar had the smell of mildew so I had to move seats and the Hostess Alice had her blue phone in her back pocket and would text any chance she could get. The Manager Jose was nice and removed the steak from our check. Needless to say, we will not return to this Applebees again. Unprofessional and not well trained staff."
Shmee M.,"Santa Ana, CA",26,17,,3.0,11/29/2016,This place has pretty good food!!! Happy hour too. Hit the spot!!! I will definitely eat here again!
Lynette B.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,1,,1.0,6/30/2017,"Took my father out for a birthday dinner with family and friends. The waitress Brianna V. ruined the entire experience, and that's saying a lot since it took us 45 minutes to be seated. We were understanding of the wait since we had a large group. She proceeded to take the orders of our preteens without checking if they were on the same tickets so there was confusion when my son and my best friend's kid had the 2 for $25. Then it took an additional 15 minutes for her to bring my 1 year old a juice box and everyone had gotten their drinks and getting seconds. She brought my friend a watered down long island and when he ordered top shelf it was even worse. So she called her self talking to the bartender who proceeded to literally put 2 drops in it as they both laughed, not knowing we could see them. When questioned she became speechess. We then requested to speak to the manager as she tried to lie and say that's not what happened. Our food was cold, and the manager Zac tried to make it right. The only problem is the night was ruined and appetites were lost. They tried to offer free deserts but not even the kids wanted to be there any longer. It took forever to get our to go boxes and checks. I don't recommend this place for it poor customer service, but if you go avoid Brianna V."
Chelsea B.,"Carlsbad, CA",41,68,10,2.0,10/4/2016,"I didn't expect much, since it's Applebee's, and casual dining. It certainly needs a facelift, but doesn't hider the dining experience. The restaurant was a ghost town. Everything was standard... however, the touch screen game things on the tables have a credit card swipe spot ... indicating if you want to play you have to pay. My son was poking around on it, I wasn't watching, because how could he spend money if I didn't swipe my card? Oh, because they add it on to your bill. He tapped a couple of games, didn't play, and we still got charged. I dont think games or screens need to be on each table, that's not why families dine, and that's why I didn't pay for one. Automatically charging on our receipt, without warning or mention was not appreciated. We won't return. It's been about 10 years since we've dined at an Applebee's and I'm remembered why."
Laurie S.,"San Clemente, CA",8,76,148,5.0,1/26/2016,"Sophia! So attentive & such a hard worker! She gets 5 stars! She created this amazing dessert for me. Thank you, Sophia. You are crazy, cool, & an amazing bartender!"
John F.,"Irvine, CA",6,80,89,3.0,2/22/2016,"Came here for school fundraiser.  The ranch dressing for the gross boneless wings was awful. My kids fries took forever to get to the table. The chips and spinach dip was soooo salty . The won ton tacos were a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm trying to nice with this review,  they deserve fewer stars actually.  I'll never eat at another Applebee's again . Yuck. I'm sure I'll have a headache from all the preservatives and chemicals I ingested today. Yuck.... did I say yuck ?  BTW,  chilis is very close and their ranch is awesome :)"
Tom V.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,7,,2.0,12/1/2016,11/29/16 When we walked in we were seated promptly near the front door. Both my wife and I went to use their restroom and noticed a foul order coming from the restroom. When I was in the restroom it was real strong and the same thing with my wife. While sitting in our booth close to the front door we would get that aroma periodically all the way from the back of the restaurant. The food and service was good except that the smell kind of made the meal unsavory. Hopefully it was a one time issue as we have been to this one before and never had the issue and the food was always good.
Jennifer W.,"Fallbrook, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/10/2017,"My husband and I went into Applebee's last Thursday night and sat at the bar. We started off with a bartender named Alex who was very on top things and very helpful. Great bartender. Then Sophia, his relief came in. Wow, she was amazing. Very personable and she had my husband and I in tears we were laughing so hard. We had such a pleasant experience and will be back to see her"
Courtney K.,"Laguna Hills, CA",325,116,86,5.0,11/29/2015,Great food as always with great customer service! Alix was very tentative & constantly checking in to make sure everything was good with our group of 6 (2 children). She was the bomb! Got 1/2 off appetizers & drink specials since it was Sunday! The mango jalapeño margaritas are amazing! & my oriental chicken wrap was delicious as always! Whenever we're in the area we always come here!
Tracy S.,"Oceanside, CA",13,74,54,2.0,3/8/2016,"Applebee's has always been my favorite resturaunt. I got a ton of gift cards from Christmas to use up, so my boyfriend and I were coming here 1-2 times a week for at least a month. And wow the food is so mediocre now. To the point where I wish I had just cooked at home. Dried out boneless wings, skimpy ceaser salad, the list could go on forever. I would say you can definitely tell a quality difference in Applebee's within the last year. I'm sad, it used to be my favorite. Now I'm hard pressed to go back."
Ben B.,"Vista, CA",0,26,,2.0,9/25/2016,"The food here has really gone down, and the service is pretty bad. If it wasnt for the bartender i probably wouldve walked out. He had to keep taking care of the Waitresses (essence i believe her name was)  work and it wasnt even busy"
Crystal D.,"Oceanside, CA",100,7,15,5.0,6/15/2016,"Jennifer was awesome!! She was attentive, fun, cute and stayed busy.. The food was amazing!!!! Steak with butter garlic shrimp on top the best garlic fries ever and broccoli!! We will be back."
Abby S.,"Oceanside, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/18/2016,"Probably will never go to this Applebee's again Wait was so long, Waitress was a complete BITCH her name is Celina L. ....after showing her specifically what I wanted, they come and bring us our food (guest of 3)  and my friend and I both let the girl who brought us our food know that, that wasn't what I had ordered. Manager comes out and she apologized and let me know it was going to be another 10 mins to get my food if they could get me anything she said as very nice but mind you, I'm pregnant and HUNGRY so I just told her I would wait for my food. I was fine with waiting if that was gonna be the case bc I didn't want to get full off anything else BUT what I had been craving. The manager comes bac almost right away with my food and said it was already made it was just a misunderstanding.  Anyways, the waitress didn't even apologize, instead gave me the dirtiest look as if I'd done something to her...it took her about 45 mins to come around and refill my friends drink but not mine...I was so thirsty that I just asked her if I could get a refill, she just looked at me and before she walked away I said ""thank you"" (she didn't say anything)  She goes back takes a good 10 mins before she and her manager come out with drinks I'm like cool here she comes...she walked right by me didn't give me my drink instead walks around the whole restaurant, to the back and 2 mins later comes back to give me my drink. I STILL thank her and she says NOTHING at all!! I couldn't believe how bad her service was! I have NEVER been treated that way and I would NEVER do that to anyone! this is the first time I give a bad ""review"" but I just feel like I had to say something so that hopefully nobody else gets treated the way I was treated by her again.  The steak that I had along with the veggies and mashed potatoes were DELICIOUS exactly how I was craving it, it was just too bad that 1 person killed it all"
Leon H.,"Oceanside, CA",25,37,102,3.0,9/4/2015,"Our host sat us and told us it was happy hour but didn't realize it was not 3pm (the time happy hour actually started). So we put an order for appetizers because they were half off for happy hour and asked our server for happy hour priced beers and she let us know it was not happy hour.  Long story short, they gave us the appetizers and beers for happy hour prices for the confusion of the happy hour time.   Our server was very sweet but was not very attentive to our table. I can tell that's he was hustling and bustling with her other 2 tables but her absence at our table made me feel like she was ignoring us assuming that we were only there for happy hour. We ordered our food (not from the happy hour menu). It came out at a decent time and was delicious. I ordered the shrimp scampi and Caesar salad from their lunch combos. Enjoyable!  The service could have been a lot more better but overall the visit was good and left with a satisfied stomach."
M D.,"Oceanside, CA",0,2,,4.0,1/9/2017,"Our experience started off great thanks to our sweet server Nessa. Very attentive and did I mention she was a sweetheart? Thanks girl! Me and my boyfriend were upset with your bartender Sofia (Sophia). She was being very loud and obnoxious. Not to mention she embarrassed a guest by yelling out saying  she was in the middle of something and couldn't get his table some waters. I felt bad for the guy and his date because even though  I wasn't by the bar, I heard her yelling at him and then yelling at a different server/busser to get the waters . The time it took her to yell, she could have been filling up the waters an satisfying her guest. Customer service is everything and she not only failed in that, she disturbed me and my boyfriend in a different section. Other than her everything else was great!"
Erik A.,"Oceanside, CA",75,4,,2.0,3/30/2017,"Went in to eat after a long day at work, needless to say I was starving. My family and I decided to go out to eat at Applebee's and enjoy our evening.. The first thing we see when we walk in is a sign saying  something about if you don't donate you're helping kill a baby..( I'll get to that)  anyway I ignore that as much as possible because I'm in a resturaunt I'm here to eat and enjoy myself not be foot tripped like that. So someone sat is down and as we waited for our food I see this lady walking around the store giving lil green custom made cards asking for donations and then outta nowhere she  popped up at my table and I honestly thought it was the waitress.. Seeing her and her baby along with her card for donations just didn't sit right with me and it looked like the manager was behind her barely removing her after she looked like she'd been there a good thirty minutes. I just felt bothered by the experience that's all."
Sindy P.,"Oceanside, CA",32,31,,2.0,7/31/2016,This location unfortunately is a hit or miss. Some days your food will be out on a timely manner and others it will take 45 minutes for a to go order. Just depends who's working I guess.
