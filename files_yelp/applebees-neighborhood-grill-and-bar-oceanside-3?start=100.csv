Megan D.,"Oceanside, CA",336,200,147,3.0,1/24/2014,"We always get the 2 for $20 deal when we come here. Food is usually pretty good and a great deal. I recommend the Honey Pepper chicken and shrimp with broccoli instead of green beans. Best item they have on the menu. Most of the servers are great but there is one manager who is just terrible. He is a short possible marine? He helped us with substituting an item into the 2 for $20 but then when we got his attention to get a coupon for a free dessert because our server didn't mention any gift cards ( a promotion and sign they had on the table around the holidays) He told us sure no problem, then never came back. Then we had to ask someone else to talk to the manager. He came back and told us sorry for the wait and he had to print us a coupon (It was obviously not just printed). Then he went around the corner and laughed and told an employee how he lied to us. Really unprofessional."
Steven S.,"Vista, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/6/2014,"Very disappointed with this place. Caught an employee not washing his hands after using the restroom. Service was slow. Wrong food was delivered to table. Flies all around dining area. I will not be back and will tell all of my friends about my terrible dining experience. This happened at 4:30 PM, not during peak hours. Adios!"
Carroll S.,"Sedona, AZ",86,46,,2.0,2/3/2013,"These folks were nice enough to offer a free meal to vets. I was going through a bad patch so i came, bringing a friend. (She paid, we tipped well.) I assure you I will NEVER return. Crap."
April R.,"Oceanside, CA",492,979,200,2.0,12/19/2011,"I am always disappointed when I go to Applebee's.  Even judging it for what it is I never leave happy.  The food is low quality even for a large chain that you don't expect much from.  The drinks are never that great, service just ok.  If this is the type of restaurant you are looking for I would recommend going to Chili's instead, its just a few parking lots over."
Delia J.,"Vista, CA",0,5,,5.0,6/12/2015,"First time here at aplebees with my husband and it was overall great. We came in yesterday at around 9:30 and were greeted right away. They tried to seat us at a table but asked if we preferred a booth which we did. It was pretty busy so naturally their tables were full. They cleaned up a booth for us right away and seated us. Our waiter was super nice and asked if we would like drinks.  Which we did. We ordered a Pepsi and an angry orchard! Amazing! They actually have angry orchard on tap! And the manager quickly brought them out. We got the Siracha shrimp appetizer. It was good but would be better with more Siracha  or less mayo. When we were ready to order the waiter came back and took our order, she was super helpful. We order the Philly sandwich with chips and the Parmesan steak with shrimp. The food took a little longer than expected but it was busy like I said.  Food was great. Staff was great! Beer amazing! Definitely coming back!"
Kyle K.,"Solana Beach, CA",7,28,1,1.0,9/7/2011,"Updating past review. Will never come to restaurant again... Due to server Randi. Not all men are pathetic and can see through you blatant attempts at flirting, giving out telephone #s etc to get better tips, esp when she has a BF... Hire more morally sound employees... I wanna eat, not be hit on for a bigger tip. ** Side Note: While I was in the restaurant, Randi convinced me to write the previously review, and brought me out a free dessert for it."
Armando G.,"San Marcos, CA",53,115,44,1.0,4/25/2009,"This review is not on Applebee's but it is on their Curb Side to Go. IN 2 words DON'T GO. What a waste of time and a gift certificate.  So were do I start, On the phone at the end of my order the girl taking my order said it will be ready in 15-20 min. (That's a normal amount of time for a pick up order). It takes me about 10 min to drive to the restaurant so I left and figured I'd have to wait maybe another 10 min before I got my food. When I got there I was greeted by a girl who asked me my name and she said that she would get my bill. 15 min later she came out and handed my bill. We waited and saw another car drive up and get their food right away, time clicked away and we stayed hungry. until the time of 7:40 pm hit finally the girl (the second girl with our bill not the one on the phone saying it would be 15-20 min before the food would be ready.)came out with our food.  When we finally got home we got our food out and I was kind of upset seeing that my wife's side salad was bigger than my apple walnut chicken salad. Please keep in mind that the apple walnut chicken salad was a full dinner side, not a side salad. The food was ok and nothing to brag about.  Please don't waste your time on the curb side to go."
Melisa M.,"Vista, CA",400,7,1,2.0,7/10/2015,Came here tonight we were to lazy to cook it was a group of 4 everyone's food was cold besides mine our waitress was a little rude good thing is the happy hour on the drinks though
Sarah Z.,"Killeen, TX",16,6,6,3.0,1/17/2014,You definitely have time to sit and chat for a whole before you eat!  The food is good though and the waiter is super cool!! Manny much props!! :-)
RaShelle M.,"San Diego, CA",141,27,1,5.0,4/10/2012,I have been to this location 2 times for late night happy hour. The food is always good and the drinks are great!  I love their long beaches :) also their boneless wings are really good too!
April W.,"Oceanside, CA",72,293,116,3.0,11/13/2013,This place is so hit or miss. Almost always a long wait. And the food can be great. Service so depends on what server you get. It's kind of on the dark side. But lots of TVs  to watch just about any game.
Sarah M.,"Oceanside, CA",182,36,12,2.0,10/24/2013,"Service was sooooo horrible!! Yes, I get it it's a weekday but really... 2 hostess and a busboy were all chatting it up while waistresses are nowhere to be found. Customers are waiting to be served and its not even busy!!!! Finally, our waitress introduced herself and all she did was took our payment. Food was good though."
Katy M.,"Bonsall, CA",7,37,20,4.0,12/20/2013,Happy hour 3-6 every day and the margaritas are good! Our server Andrew was awesome! Perfectly attentive and our food came out decently quick. And the food? OMG! Bourbon street steak and napa chicken are A-MAZING! My boyfriend and I were completely satisfied. We have a new favorite dinner. Only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because the drinks were made a bit weak.
Charles W.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,11,7,1.0,4/14/2011,"Lousy greasy food. Fish and chips didn't look like fish, more like flaked and formed cat food. Chips(fries) were soaked in cooking oil. Service was about what I expected; not the best but not the worst. I got two gift certificate cards to this place - used one for dinner and gave the other away to a homeless guy - hopefully he enjoys it better than me. This was my first AND last time at Applebees"
Arielle R.,"Oceanside, CA",0,9,5,2.0,3/12/2014,"Only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of one was because the food was pretty good. Unfortunately I can't say the same about the service. There was barely anyone there & things were forgotten repeatedly & the waiter barely came to check if we needed anything. We never got water refills which I had to get my own water from the bar in the first place because mine was never brought to me even after asking twice for it. Anyway, good prices & good food just crap service."
Jordan G.,"Vista, CA",107,50,4,5.0,8/28/2013,My husband and I are regulars here. They consistently have great service and great prices. I recommend their happy hour... Amazing prices and a good list of choices for both food and drinks.
Queen Claire B.,"Carlsbad, CA",326,278,628,4.0,9/3/2010,"I have had variety of different experiences at this Applebee's location. I'm glad to say that my most recent experience here was a pretty good one.  My family along with my mom and sister had dinner here for my birthday. We probably arrived around 6:30 PM. Shockingly, enough it wasn't that busy. We were seated right away and our sever, Randee, greeted us shortly after.  Randee is definitely the best server we've encountered in a very, very long time. She was really nice, down to earth, and overall, has a pleasant disposition. Her job isn't easy but she doesn't show any sign of crankiness or stress. That is awesome!  My fiancé and I had their two full sized entrees with an appetizer for $20. For the appetizer we had a plate of honey BBQ chicken. We both opted for the the Oriental Chicken Salad. When they say full entrees, they mean it. The portion size was huge. The veggies were fresh, the chicken was crispy, and dressing and almonds really made the salad a thousand times better.  Overall, we had a great and fulfilling dinner. I hope our future visit(s) is mote like this one."
Rita A.,"Torrey Pines, San Diego, CA",55,18,2,4.0,9/21/2013,Good food and service. I really liked their 2 for 20 deal. An appetizer and an entree?! YUM
A J.,"San Diego, CA",2,36,,2.0,12/8/2012,"Applebees, Applebees...what happened to you? Anyway all I can say is this place sucked. The salmon was dry, the side broccoli seemed like it was microwaved. My husband ordered the burger and man...can the burger get any smaller. I don't know if it's this place or just the restaurant itself. All in all...thumbs down."
Sandy M.,"Santa Maria, CA",0,60,1,1.0,7/31/2013,Very slow service when it was not very busy.  My biggest complaint is why would they seat three young jocks who thought they were gods gift to the world next to a family with 2 small children. There were plenty of other places for them to sit. Having to keep my kids from hearing the F-bomb every couple of minutes just ruined our night. NEVER AGAIN!!
