Chade m.,"San Diego, CA",75,75,3,3.0,8/13/2010,"I am really not a big fan of Applebees. The service is always good. The restaurant is always kept clean. But the food is just ok.  My moms sister gave her a gift certificate to Applebees for her birthday. We haven't eaten there for a while, and once we left Applebees that night, I had realized why. I order the chicken alfredo, and my mom ended up getting the applebee's riblets. The riblets was tough and chewy, the alfredo was drench in sauce. Our drinks were good. She orders an apple martini and I a Cosmo. If you do decide to go their, you should order something from their weight watcher menu."
Judy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",130,766,552,2.0,1/24/2013,"I don't know why we keep coming here.  The service was ok but the food?  :( our boneless buffalo chicken was so heavily breaded & hardly had any sauce coating it which made it really bad.  my bourbon chicken was tender but the flavor made my stomach sick.  not sure if it's a certain seasoning but I couldn't stomach it to the point my daughter traded her food for mine.  she had the riblets.  used to be our favorite, not anymore.  it would help if the meat was coated well w/ the bbq sauce.  not sure what the deal is in the kitchen, bad lighting or running low on sauces??  annoying.  my husband had the cowboy burger... must be a emphasis on the 'boy' cause when we saw the burger we thought it looks nothing like the picture & it was small!  overall it was the worst meal we've had lately... I don't think we'll be back for a while..."
Chris K.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",1,1,,1.0,12/23/2013,"Had the chocolate shake.. May as well call it chocolate milk, couldn't even tell if it had ice cream in it. Food was mediocre at best just another reason I wouldn't choose to go here unless forced."
Pamela F.,"Carlsbad, CA",17,84,57,1.0,5/5/2013,"I have always gone here when I want a lagit burger. Last visit was ""eh"" at best but last night was last. The drinks were AWFUL, the food was ok but the service was the worst! We were 10 feet from the bar and had to wait 20 min for a beer. It sat on the bar till I asked the MANAGER to get it......THEN we were overcharged $10 for those awful drinks. The waitress conveniently noticed when she saw us looking at the bill THEN told us they were out of what we asked for so they substituted. Prolly why the drinks were so bad. Shiesty....I love to compliment (read my other reviews) but none for this place. I'll find another burger spot I guess. Suggest u do too!"
Cynthia A.,"Long Beach, CA",417,535,108,4.0,3/27/2012,"I'm always excited to eat at an Applebee's because I see the commercials all the time but I live in LA and there's really not one near me. It does remind me a lot like a Chilli's which is cool because its typical American food...burgers, sandwiches, pasta, salads. I really enjoyed myself at this location recently, the blue cheese burger was AMAZING, the Berry Sangria was delicious, and our waitress was hilarious. I wish I remembered her name because she really made our dining experience fun. I like the set up of this place, makes for good sports watching."
Mia N.,"Oceanside, CA",42,6,,1.0,9/16/2014,"We hadn't been here in awhile and chose it because they had inexpensive, yet tasty steaks. It also looked as if they have remodeled or redecorated and it looked great inside, very open and spacious. Unfortunately, now we know why we never come here! First off, we had one server take drink orders, then a few minutes later we got another server...no explanation why. We also did not get any napkins or silverware, we had to grab them from another table. Then it took 20 minutes to get my frozen lemonade when there were only 4 tables with customers. I was willing to overlook that, our server was very nice and my daughter had her frozen lemonade so I sipped some of hers. The appetizers were pretty good, except the wings which tasted frozen, overcooked, and looked like cat vomit. It just got worse from there. My fiancé's ribs were pretty much all bone and he got original sauce when he ordered the chipotle sauce. My steak, which was ordered medium, was well done, fatty, gristly, and tasted like breakfast sausage. I only ate a few bites. Needless to say it was a very disappointing experience and we will not be back."
Aja J.,"San Diego, CA",9,76,105,4.0,8/17/2010,"FYI they upped their prices, the wings are now $4.99 at Happy Hour.  Less Applebee's for us. lol"
Laura A.,"Bullhead City, AZ",12,35,9,2.0,3/9/2012,"The service at this Applebees was pretty good-- but I was dissapointed with the food quality. Everything seemed to be fried! My hubby ended up getting the fish and chips- and it was just so-so. Overall, I think the prices are too expensive for the food."
Nancy L.,"Carlsbad, CA",283,400,663,3.0,1/29/2010,"HG Jr. & fellow gamers (video that is) requested we vacate the house because GIRLS had agreed to a DVD night with them.  We made the most of our banishment by going to the movies, and since Burger King didn't seem ""date night"" enough, went to Applebee's (usually reserved for late nights with the kids so we can sit in exactly the same place and order exactly the same thing). This Applebee's always seems dirty to me, and it was even more so since the evening was young, and while I wasn't, at least I was relatively alert.  Of course the menus were correspondingly grubby, but I pushed away mental images of the kitchen's state to concentrate on the latest special.  They always have a gimmick - this time it was two entrees and an appetizer for $20 - if they'd thrown in a dessert I'd have been hooked.  They still offered the assemble-your-own Ultimate Trio which HG selected, and I broke my rule of not ordering chicken in a restaurant because it's not special enough, and got the dijon chicken and portabellos.  I shouldn't have strayed - the steamed vegetables and little red potatoes were great, but the chicken, while moist and flavorful, just wasn't that exciting, and the pieces of mushroom were very small.  The $2.99 add-on salad was surprisingly good (excellent fresh croutons) and large - much more attractive than its Denny's counterpart.  HG chose too many fried things, but felt fine due to the mango peach sangria which refreshed us though the more traditional one may have stood up to the ice better. A couple of managers stopped by to see how we fared, and it didn't occur to me to say, ""Your place is dirty"".  That would have been just rude - I already knew going in."
Pamela R.,"Oceanside, CA",26,76,22,2.0,2/22/2014,"We never go to Applebee's...we try to stay away from most chain ""family"" type restaurants but, we were in the area and hungry and didn't want to do fast food.  We started at Chili's but there was a 25 minute wait at 3pm...even with the restaurant half empty...so, we drove down to Q's...ew! Turned around and walked out quickly...So, Applebee's it was.  We were seated right away...there were a few families with small, screaming children...yikes!  Luckily, they were at the end of their meals...phew!  The music was loud...80's stuff (I'm old, I liked it!).  I gave two stars because the food was actually good...we both ordered the Cheddar Bacon Burger...except I had Swiss...we weren't asked how we wanted it cooked but it was cooked well and juicy.  Fresh lettuce and tomato and pickle slices.  No mayo or any type of dressing...So, we waited...and waited...and waited for our server to return to ask for mayo.  And then we waited...and waited...and waited for it to be delivered to our table...Needless to say, our server was too busy chatting with the other employees to do his job...However, even worse than being able to see him chatting and laughing and not working...was having the manager come to our table, our table with three empty drink glasses stacked up across the front, and not ask if we wanted refills!!!"
Kristine T.,"Oceanside, CA",5,5,,3.0,10/21/2012,"I really liked the all you can eat lunch they used too have, Now the lunches are very small and really are not worth the money.  The food is still good, service the day we went for lunch was not great, we seat in the bar and I think that why the services was on the slow side.  When we go back,  we will get 2 for 20 deals. I think we will stick with going too Mimi's and Chili's for Lunch, they just have a much better Lunch ~with good size servings."
Felicia G.,"San Marcos, CA",91,281,19,2.0,4/10/2009,"The only reason this review is getting a second star is because the food this time was actually worth eating!! Surprising very surprising!  The girl who seated us was nervous for some reason and asked me 3 times how my day was going all three times I answered good thanks WTF else was I supposed to say was this a trick question did she want me to make something up each time??? Then at the end she says gosh the weather looks bad outside its supposed to rain, isn't it? Well my freakin' gosh to holy hell anybody could answer that damn question the news on the TV at the bar was broadcasting it.......................hello!!!  My god can we get somebody who can actually hold a conversation here????  Let's move on........................ So I know  through current friends that I have said I look intimidating at first site,  what can I say I'm a big girl with dark features and people just think I'm tough, I say hey let them think what they want but ya know what don't fuckin' sit me at a handicap booth because of my weight the damn table was so far away from me I had to sit on the edge of the booth seat just to get the food into my mouth before it got cold because I was sitting so far away!!! Errrrrrrrrrrrrr Our server was OK she seemed to be trying to hard to please us for some reason, I don't know maybe she felt bad because she thought there was something wrong with me??? I dunno??? The manager even stopped by to see if ""everything was OK""?? In passing not even making eye contact.......................whatever!!!  Hey lets get to the food it was good enough said............................I ordered off the Weight Watchers menu and I loved my meal very satisfying!!!"
Amanda C.,"Oceanside, CA",126,23,19,3.0,2/14/2012,Love the happy hour specials! I ordered a surf and turf thing but my steak was really tough and indigestible. When I complained I got it for free so the service is very accommodating. Umm this place isn't too impressive? I'm not into the whole sports bar thing
Eartha H.,"Oceanside, CA",27,78,2,2.0,2/9/2009,"I used to like this Applebees location but now whenever it is suggested to eat there I just say no. The service is always excellent, never had a problem there, but the food isn't prepared very well. I seriously get better meals at Denny's. Most things that I've ordered are just too greasy and look like they are thrown onto the plate with no care whatsoever.  I mean, I don't order the healthiest meals but I don't expect everything to be super greasy either. The fries are horrible too. The funny thing is, every time we drive past, there are people waiting outside to be seated and I laugh because there are so many better restaurants in the area to eat at. The place is ok but don't expect much in terms of food quality."
Raymond G.,"Carlsbad, CA",9,2,,1.0,8/29/2011,"HORRIBLE SERVICE! - Called an Order for CARSIDE TO GO at 7:21 pm.   - Picked up at 8pm (the promised time was 15 minutes, I gave 40 minutes to make sure they are done).  Found out THEN that the Order DISAPPEARED!  They could not find the order anywhere. - Manager did not apologize, pretended that nothing happened, and casually retook the order. - When we got home, found out that the dressing for the Salad order was MISSING. Not sure what kind of operation they are running in this store, but this is absolutely ridiculous.  I wish there is a NEGATIVE star.. They don't even deserve 1 Star!"
Marvin B.,"Oceanside, CA",21,157,3,2.0,8/18/2009,"OMG this place is horrible! Okay well maybe it's not that bad but it's definitely not good. I've been here several times and this time the food was been less than mediocre.  I went there and I ordered the  8oz sirloin steak and potatos. It was lousy! Watered down and no flavor (or liquor for that matter). I can see why it was on the 2 for 20 deal. I will say that on a previous visit I had a cheeseburger that was excellent. One star. I ordered the fish and chips which was disgusting. The fish was so greasy! It makes my heart hurt just thinking about it. The saving grace of the meal was the dessert. I had the Chimicheesecake. It was absolutely delicious. One star.  The server started off pretty good but he gradually lost interest in us. He actually brought the check out before the dessert! AND the dessert wasn't even included in the bill. So when we tried to get his attention to alert him to this error he came over and said ""Wuz up?"" You should have seen the look on my face! lol Overall, this Applebee's sucks. The food is disgusting, the drinks and the service are hit or miss. I say you'd do better going to KFC.  Again, I did not pick this place."
Meghan J.,"Oceanside, CA",228,130,51,3.0,3/14/2011,"I like this place. It's good for a good meal, a beer and maybe watch a game. I ordered the riblet basket and my boyfriend had the steak with veggies and mash potatos. My ribs were just ok, less bone than I had expected but my boyfriends steak was amazing. The wings aren't bad either. Quick and friendly service, even on a packed Sunday night!"
Scott G.,"Oceanside, CA",0,10,,1.0,10/13/2013,"Had dinner here for several years and things have been better. Seems like the service here has gone down hill in the last year. Tonight my wife and i had a decent meal but the service on a Sunday night sucked. Waitresses standing around and gossiping and had to tackle the staff to get refills and anything else. Once again, Applebees has backslid to ranking right up there with Dennys. Now if only Dennys had Sunday Night football."
victor b.,"San Marcos, CA",54,28,3,5.0,3/11/2011,dam i haven't bee to an Applebees in about 10 years. My biggest pet-peeve is running out of a soda during a meal...i drink about 3-4 cups...the waitress never missed an opportunity to refill my cup..The manager. Justine came over and introduced hims self and ask how our experience was....that was cool. we'll be back
Penny Lane S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",164,155,21,1.0,12/30/2009,"Yikes.  If you want a side of the runs with your meal, this is the place to be.  The spinach artichoke dip was tasty.  The ribs were dry, there was a creepster staring at my sister and I the whole time.  I have to say this place blows.  I should've known not to eat here.  If we weren't waiting for a NAV to get installed at Best Buy, I would never have even considered Applebee's."
