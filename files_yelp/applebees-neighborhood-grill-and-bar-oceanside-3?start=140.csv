Craig N.,"Oceanside, CA",2,18,1,4.0,10/3/2010,"One of my favorite chain resturants.  I've had family, friends ,coworkers, and wife eat here with me, and always a pleasant experience.  I love the grilled shrimp and spinach salad with the bacon dressing.  I recently went on a diet, and had the Asiago Peppercorn Steak at 550 calories, and it was pretty good too.  Mom had the fried shrimp which were huge and very tasty.  Never had a bad server, but some more genuine than others.  I can't say all the food is awesome, but you learn to pick your faviorites after awhile.  The only negative I have is a minor one and kind of petty, but the forks are the worse I've ever used... thin, cheap, and with sharp edges.  I know I'm picky, but thats also why I like this place."
Mary H.,"Oceanside, CA",1,28,,2.0,9/6/2012,"I live in the area and because of the convenience we have been regular customers at this location.  With that being said......I have noticed that their food quality and portion sizes have gone down and their prices are up.  Our last visit was probably our last for a while.  We love the service and sitting at the bar and chatting with the bartenders and maybe will go there just to drink.   I ordered a burger and have to say it was the worst burger I have ever had.  I swear I think the cooks reheated a mistake it was that bad.  How can you screw up a burger.  it was crusty greasy, soggy and the cheddar cheese had the worst taste ever. It was like I reheated leftover in the microwave.   We ordered a skillet dish and it was so salty and a burger and one beer and it was 29.00 without tip.   I know all restaurants have bad nights and sometimes a decent cook makes the difference, but I ate almost the entire burger and wanted to throw up later!!!!! My husband for some reason likes Applebees and I usually have gone along just because of the consistency and prices.  After this experience, not throwing money away anymore."

Jessica M.,"Oceanside, CA",6,58,,4.0,8/13/2008,"I don't know what day that guy below went on but everytime I've been here, it's been pretty good. The wait staff has always been attentive (sometimes a bit too much for my liking actually) and friendly. They respond well to the eight billion times they have to fill my Grampa's iced tea cup when I've gone with him. I usually order the same thing and it's always good.  My only complaint is that the menu options seem to have shrunk drastically over time. And they totally screwed up the house salad. It used to be fucking awesome and now it's just like any other house salad, nothing special."
Robert R.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,46,19,4.0,2/14/2011,"wow, the sizzling steak with chesse is the best! this place is a bit dirty but other then that, the food here is not too bad, i guess its like any other place, its ups and downs that is. the serivce was good and so was the manager, and o yea, happy hour the tallest glass they have for bud light, 3 dollars! woohoo! wanted a other one but i couldnt, had to drive back home, will come back for sure!"
RJ P.,"Oceanside, CA",0,18,,1.0,9/10/2007,"If you're a fan of restaurant chains, then Applebee's may very well be the place you're looking for.  Well, if Chilil's, Spoons, Macaroni Grill, Mimi's, and every other chain restaurant in the area is completely busy and you don't want to wait in line.   But if you're like me, and you like food that is both edible and doesn't totally suck, well, you might want to skip Applebee's.    Not sure what happened here, because at one point in time the place was actually decent.  During it's first year of operation the place was actually worth a visit.  Somewhere along the way a Chili's (with a much better location) opened for business, and it was all downhill for Applebee's.   It is quite possible that the worst dining experience of my life occured at this location.  Thanks to the incredible mediocre service, horribly prepared food, and the unwillingness by the management to work to remedy the situation, I doubt I'll ever hit this spot again.  Actually, I'd rather walk across the parking lot and eat at the McDonald's located inside Wal-Mart before I went back to Applebee's.   If I could give this restaurant a lower rating, I'd do so without hesitation. I guess I'll make myself feel better about the star by convincing myself that the bathroom had hot and cold running water and it isn't open 24 hours, therefore a single star is justified."
Luis R.,"Oceanside, CA",23,1,,1.0,5/18/2013,u guys  suck...... I will never go to your place ever again... your service is the worse I bought 4 jager bomb's and they refuse to sell me more  !!!! I wasn't causing no problem's
