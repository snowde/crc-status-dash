Jen B.,"Oceanside, CA",8,10,3,1.0,10/20/2015,"Have to sadly agree with those who said the customer service is bad!  I had an issue with online ordering which took 20 minutes and still wouldn't work and called to talk to the manager after waiting 5 minutes on hold, this would make it a whole hour from when I started to when I'll bring my food back home to my poor hungry hubby. Cindy was unapologetic and told me it wasn't her fault that I couldn't get it to work right."
Debbie M.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,4,,4.0,2/23/2016,"Great customer service ! Very good food, not great, but for the price it was perfect. Amazing Banana Cheesecake."
Shiella M.,"Sacramento, CA",5,12,19,4.0,7/19/2016,Love it keep coming back great time with the family. All the way from sactown to SoCal always fun to go
Allison W.,"Oceanside, CA",0,19,,5.0,4/2/2016,I had a horribly stressful day at work today. I wasn't excited to go to Applebee's but my friend insisted and I'm glad I caved. we sat at the bar and we had Jennifer and Keith. they were amazing! they looked like they were having so much fun and they included us in their fun. their enthusiasm really helped to make my night. they kept the drinks coming and were very accommodating and nice. they definitely turned my night around! I really appreciate how nice they were and we will definitely be coming back soon!
Katie S.,"Long Beach, CA",266,15,18,1.0,7/14/2015,"Let me start with this...I understand this is Applebee's, not a 5 star, high end restaurant. However, the lack of customer service at this location is horrendous and the food was ""eh"" at best. They sat us quickly, which was nice since we were here with my 89 year old grandmother.  Secondly, where my grandma was sitting, the sun was glaring straight into her eyes from one of the windows, so another server closed the blinds for us. So, we'll attribute the 1 star to those 2 things. To make a long story as short as possible, our server was anything but attentive. Our drinks would become completely empty before she would refill them and we had to ask most of the time. She wasn't helpful in recommending anything or guiding us through the menu (i.e. showing us where to find the drink options). Also, our food took almost 35 minutes - let's take into account the fact that we were one of 4 tables when we ordered and I'm pretty sure there were 4 servers on duty.  The food was fine, but definitely very small portions and did not look as pictured or described (much smaller in size). Also, we asked our server if they did anything for birthdays, since we were celebrating my grandma's birthday - she said yes, little did we know, they charge for the dessert - mentioning that to us would have been nice. My father asked to see a manager when the bill came mainly due to our food taking so long and that's when the server told us they were short staffed in the kitchen - she could have mentioned this/apologized for the delay due to this during the 35 minutes we waited for our salads and sandwiches. When the manager came out, he didn't even know which table he was supposed to be going to and just started approaching every table in our area before finally getting to us and realizing we were the ones that had requested to speak to him. He didn't introduce himself either, which just seemed unprofessional. He did apologize and said he would supply a discount, but didn't specify what that would be - no big deal, we appreciated that we would be getting a discount. Once we got the new bill, he told my mother that he had taken off one of the lunch specials (he picked the cheapest one out of our 6 meals) and the birthday dessert...this is when we found out they had planned to charge for this. It was a pretty cheap way to provide a discount as an apology for the complete lack of customer service. All in all, we left a very minor tip, will not be returning and wouldn't recommend that anyone waste their time or money at this restaurant."
Ashti S.,"Oceanside, CA",0,9,,5.0,3/18/2016,"I come here all the time just to see Sophia! She's the best bartender and is just amazing! That's the only word I can use to describe her!!   another amazing employee is JENNIFER! She also works at the bar with Sophia, her customer service skills are amazing. I strictly only come here to see these two lovely women!!!!"
James G.,"Oceanside, CA",38,8,,5.0,6/23/2015,"Took the family here last week. We'd never been to this location before and that always makes me a bit nervous. The place was busy, which was a good sign, it was a week night. The hostess was very polite, if robotic. Our server was extremely friendly. He kept tabs on everything we needed, even cracked a few jokes, and was very attentive. The restaurant and tables were clean. I had the Fish and Chips, which was delicious, and a rather large portion for the price. My wife had sizzlin' chicken fajitas, which were to the normal good standard. Mozzarella sticks and green beans for a starter to share, those were so tasty. The kids had there usual butter pasta and healthy vegetable snacks with juice and milk deal. We finished off with a nice ice cream sundaes to share. great value with service to match. All in all this was a great place to be, at least on a weeknight. I don't know what weekend staff is like, or how busy it would be. I would definitely be back again to this location for another applebee's fix."
Rob P.,"Jacksonville, NC",70,289,239,2.0,3/29/2014,"Had lunch here today, the table was still dirty so my wife had to use a baby wipe to clean it off ourselves.  Waited almost 15 minutes before anyone came to take our drink order.  I ordered the trio appetizer and it would be nice if they made even half of an attempt to make the food look like the picture.  My boneless wings were luke warm and could tell that they just through them in a microwave.  The chicken wongtons were drowning in a weird coleslaw, and to top it off, the southeast egg rolls were not egg rolls at all, instead a smear of small steak pieces with tons of cheese in a TORTILLA!! Then someone half attempted to make it look like an egg roll by cutting it diagonally.  Oh and that was also microwaved.  I would have sent it back, but at this point we had already waited 45 minutes.   I used to love coming to Applebee's to catch a game on tv with some nice beers and a trio appetizer, but this location has gone down hill real fast."
RD H.,"Oceanside, CA",2,89,92,5.0,8/14/2015,"Our server, Kyla, was friendly, helpful and cheerful.  The 2 for 25.00 was just what we needed tonight,  with leftovers for tomorrow!  After a stressful day at work, the perfect Patron Margarita is tasty and lets me have an extra glass with more salt! EVEN on a busy Friday night,  they were able to seat us promptly and in a comfortable booth! The reviews for this location do Not do it justice!  Try it yourself and you will see."
Liliana D.,"Perris, CA",137,3,,1.0,1/5/2015,"I came here on New Years Eve  To celebrate my 2Month wedding anniversary plus it also was Our Honeymoon Dinner an well Dinner did not go well.. First off I found hair in our Wonton Taco which went in my mouth, second they came to me at the last minute to tell me they ran out of something that goes with my dinner.. It ruined my night... I am not usually one to complain but I will never go back to this place!"
Billy B.,"Carlsbad, CA",7,210,3,2.0,2/5/2015,"Clearly I'm missing something here....  a 20 min wait?  Really? Pros: Full Bar, lots of TV's, cute waitress.....and that's about it. Cons: Food, really odd.  Pasta was cheap brand, chicken is processed. Fish and chips was Pollock, not cod, mushy fish.  Hamburger was dry, cheap bun.  Seems like avg prices but for the quality over priced. I could go on but you get the idea.  Fun atmosphere but a stomach ache in the end.  Sorry, no return trip for me."
Tricia C.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,59,30,4.0,3/7/2016,"Took a drive from LA to duo personal business and do date night and had an amazing time. I met up with one of very close friend's and very glad that I stuck around tip visit. We jag appetizers and drinks, the chicken quesadilla and buffalo wings were satisfying and loved that they're half price for happy hour. Only $4! However, their drinks tasted as of it was kool aid that I made from home, zero alcohol in neither drink we ordered. Couldn't really complain on account of it was only3$ and$5. We had a great time, can't wait till go back again."
Christine S.,"Oceanside, CA",3,33,46,3.0,5/16/2015,"Appetizer: Ordered Potstickers for appetizer. They are small and seems like it's a frozen menu. I had frozen potstickers from groceries before and they are way much bigger and tastier than Applebees. The soy sauce that came with it was delicious, however the thai peanut sauce taste like straight from a bottle you buy in a grocery store. Main Course: Bourbon Street Steak. Meat was cooked good. Sauce was too salty for my taste. The onion and mushroom side was pitiful. It didnt deliver like the ""picture"" on the menu. On the picture, you can actually see mushrooms. Our ordered seems like they went really cheap and gave us jillian cut mushrooms. In addition, onions were burned.  All-American Burger. My husband actually like the burger. However, he feels like he got cheated on the amount of fries he had on the plate.  Service: We had Brian as our server. He did a great job and was checking on us constantly. He is very knowlegedable about the menu. Must keep!"
Daniel L.,"Vista, CA",1,8,1,5.0,11/25/2015,Yes. Good service. Good food. Good prices. Locating off the 5 and 78.  Parking lot is huge and overall cleanliness of the restaurant was great. Knowledgable wait staff and interactive management.  Short wait for a Saturday at 6pm. The 4 cheese Mac was really good. Sweet and savory due to the honey and fried chicken.
Danger A.,"Redwood Falls, MN",0,23,3,4.0,3/26/2015,"Cons: the crust on my quesadilla burger was slightly burnt but didn't bother me that much, my girlfriend said the fries didn't have ""the seasoning"" on it Pros: service by far, it was somewhat packed but our waiter/ server guy, I think his name was like Andrew or something (bald guy with beard) was real nice and had an upbeat attitude, food came out quick for an Applebee's and my pet peeve is waiting for the check forever thankfully this wasn't a problem today, so yes I'll be back."
Melissa L.,"Bremerton, WA",2,37,6,1.0,7/29/2015,"I usually love going to Applebee's but this one is the worst I've ever been to. Our waitress took over 20 mins to get my husband a bottled beer and she never offered us another drink. I tried to flag her down several times and was ignored. the food was terrible. We got an artichoke dip appetizer, it no longer looks like the pictures. We got about 20 chips, barely any dip and the chips are so thin they keep breaking and can't even hold up. I got ribs and my coleslaw was only about 1/4 of the way full and I was also shorted on fries. Slow service, terrible food, and not worth the price. I will not be going back and this is the first time I would have honestly given a restaurant zero stars if it would have allowed me to"
Delaney M.,"Balboa Park, San Diego, CA",31,33,4,4.0,9/15/2014,"My family and I take out my great grandmother to lunch every Sunday and maybe once or twice a month she chooses Applebee's.  This location has lots of friendly servers and managers and the food is consistent with what you'd expect from every Applebee's. The large windows bring in a nice light and keep the restaurant bright and lively. There are a couple servers and managers who go above and beyond and give spectacular, personalized service, but there are also a couple who need to relax a little bit. Overall, this is a nice location, with lovely staff and consistent food and I can almost guarantee my great grandma and I will be here again next Sunday."
Lindsey M.,"Vista, CA",204,252,320,2.0,6/8/2013,"Haven't been here in years (eh, 2 or 3 years to give you a general idea of time) and now I remember why... Friendly staff, always a plus, however, service overall was slow (granted it was a Friday night; the establishment as a whole wasn't exactly bustling) My meal was mediocre, but my beverage was phenomenal: I got the strawberry Summer Squeeze, bacardi lemonade, more-or-less -a refreshing little drink :) Wouldn't call it a family spot, better for groups of friends or couples on a date. Wish I had more to say, but sadly, much like the Applebee's menu, not a lot of variety is offered (seriously, the menu is quite short and your options are limited)"
Douglas R.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",0,6,1,1.0,9/5/2015,"This is my fourth attempt dining and at trying to find something good to say about this restaurant.  Horrible food!  Steaks look and taste pre-packaged.  Costumer service was strange as I felt like I was secondary to the staffs fooling around and jokes with each other.  Very unprofessional.  A dishwasher or line cook walked up front and stood at the bar asking other wait staff for a cigarette while twirling his hair.  His appearance was appalling and made me feel uncomfortable.   The male bar tender said to the female bar tender ""do you want the shocker?"" Referencing some kind of sick sexual joke that was not only inappropriate but degrading in front of other customers.  I don't know that corporate understands what is taking place in this location but it has made me never want to return."
Oliver V.,"Henderson, NV",21,11,1,1.0,11/21/2016,For ALL the people that read reviews before going to a spot to spend money. This ONE is for you. So I came here to Applebee's for their food and decent service. Well not this one. Me and my family came in from Las Vegas and we were greeted fairly quickly. As we sat down the hostess told us VANESSA will be our server. So we waited about 20 min before water was out then ordered our food. I was about to leave but i realized there was only two servers so I understood the situation. Food was decent but what put the icing on the cake and sealed the deal about NEVER coming to this location before was when I asked for to go box and waited about 10 min then finally asked the hostess to get one for me. When I passed the server she had no idea that I was waiting for to go boxes. Not once she apologized for taking a while to get our orders and that she forgot to get me my to go box. So I hope people won't experience what I did but much goodness at least say sorry or acknowledge the fact that you're taking a long time for SHIT to be done.
