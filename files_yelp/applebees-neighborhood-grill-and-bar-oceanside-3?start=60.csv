Alice P.,"Oceanside, CA",15,6,7,2.0,1/2/2015,First time here. There's no shrimp Alfredo such a bummer  the pasta I ordered wasn't yummy but the many lemonade is amazing
Priscilla L.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,10,3,4.0,10/22/2015,Food is always good service is always a good my food always comes a bit on the cool side though unfortunately
Laurie B.,"Vista, CA",216,208,4090,1.0,7/23/2015,I've had a bad experience not once but several times and each time I ordered something different with the same result of not liking this place. The last time I was here was maybe 4 or 5 years ago and I got sick. I had the chicken pasta. Not sure if it was because they don't change their oil frequently or what but it tasted like other flavors in my meal and maybe that's why I got sick. Who knows I never went back nor will I go back and give them another try. Avoid this place chilli's is better.
Donald R.,"Oceanside, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/21/2016,The urinal in the men's bathroom is located in a most precarious position adjacent the door to the commode.  This configuration does not allowing for privacy for the individual standing as the other exits the commode area.  I felt like I was back in the high school locker room and that was over 50 years ago.  Reconfigure the men's room is the only solution.
Rhomel D.,"Oceanside, CA",801,364,82,3.0,7/12/2012,"I dont really like family restaurants that much espicially if im going in for a drink. But i thought about it and drinking plus people watching...this place is too easy lol. The bar is pretty huge, the bartender was friendly and cracking jokes which lightened up my mood. How the bar is setup its smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. its a real cool vibe, the only thing that was bothering me is the people that do go to the bar are pretty much creeps or weirdos that cant stop staring at you. Their food is pretty good, just a little pricey for a small amount i say. Service is great and friendly and i would come here again, but this time with a big group so i dont have to be stared at awkwardly."
Bri G.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,3,1,5.0,4/14/2016,"One word and one word only. ""SOPHIA"". This woman knows how to run a bar. Every time I come in , whether a good or bad day of work, she will ALWAYS know how to put me (and everyone else at the bar) in a good mood. You know a good bartender when she has the whole bar engaged in conversation, making good jokes and commentary. Her drinks are on point and always come out quick and easy. She knows how to work under pressure and still have a sense of humor. Such a sweetheart and a hard worker. She provides A+ service. If you are looking for a delicious drink and a good conversation, go to the bar and see Sophia"
Kevin M.,"Oceanside, CA",74,2,,2.0,1/20/2015,"My family and I go out to lunch every Saturday and we decided to try Applebee's for the first time.  We will not be going back here again. We arrived and were told that it was about a 15 minute wait to be seated, which I am used to because I understand how busy they can become at sometimes.  The problem was that there where about 10 tables that were open and available for customers.   After about 10 minutes of waiting, we were finally taken to a booth.  I had to make eye contact with our server 3 times, over a 5-7 minute period, before he stopped at our table to take our order.  We decided to order a couple drinks from the bar as well. Another 10 minutes passed and we still did not have our drinks from the bar or even the water that we ordered.  We heard another couple behind us complaining of the same thing so I turned around and asked them how long they had been waiting.  To my surprise they said they had been waiting almost 15 minutes for their bill and that they had asked to speak with a manager. We decided to get up and leave the restaurant because after almost 30 minutes of walking in the door, we still had not received anything.  When I got to the car, I contacted the restaurant and spoke with a manager over the phone because I felt like i should explain myself as to why we left after ordering and before receiving our meal.  He did apologize and told me that they are understaffed at the moment. I wish I could write a review on the food, but I didn't have an opportunity to try it.  Good Luck to anyone that decides to venture here. The reason I gave a rating of 2/5 instead of 1/5 is because the manager did apologize when I called."
Emily H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/12/2016,This was the worst experience I've ever had. My husband and I were greeted by our waitress who didn't give a shit. She didn't care to introduce herself and just asked what we wanted. After we ordered our food the manger came over and dropped out food off. When I say dropped I mean dropped the plates on the table. And said I'm assuming the plates go here and walked way. It was completely unprofessional and extremely rude. My husband food was so cold and was absolutely discussing. I will never return.
Melinda C.,"Vista, CA",43,6,,5.0,11/8/2015,"The food was amazing!! The bourbon steak my husband had was awesome and i had the bourbon chicken and shrimp delish:) My daughter loved the kids steak it was perfect!!! We had a super amazing waitress Maggie i highly suggest asking for her if you go in. Also, being my husbands birthday they brought him a treat supper yummy and sang and the timing on everything was perfect. She is a very attentive and fast waitress. We had a blast hope you all go and try it out:)"
Christine C.,"Vista, San Diego, CA",3,7,,4.0,5/18/2016,I love this place so much . Was there Sunday and I am all about lasagna and to add ravioli to it is even better.
Ricarda O.,"Austin, TX",1,7,1,2.0,7/25/2015,The fries were good... But that's it. :( never order the Steak Medium... It actually looked and tasted boiled meat...And the steamed veggies... I think I almost broke my took on a carrot. Smh
Aaron E.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",5,127,71,5.0,12/13/2013,"Love this place. The team here is super nice and treats me very well. They quickly remembered my name and made me feel like I've been coming here for years. The service is quick and really on point. I've noticed the managers really seem to work and not just stand around. I really appreciate this team and this location. Jennifer, Harrison and Rebecca are super friendly."
JV P.,"Oceanside, CA",1,9,6,1.0,1/1/2015,Waitress acknowledged us 15 minutes after sitting down just to get our drink order but services her other tables two to three times before actually coming to us
Dave F.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",15,10,8,1.0,3/17/2015,The food is too salty.  I ordered their most expensive steak in their menu and it was too salty. My husband complained that his burger and fries are salty.  Never going back. I rather eat mcdonalds and eat bigmac.
Tiffany M.,"Fallbrook, CA",14,21,3,1.0,2/22/2015,"I've been here before and didn't have a good experience, but tonight my family invited me and I thought I would give it another shot. First off this has been the worst visit ever. 1st they gave us tortilla chips that were cold and it took 4 times asking for salsa then only got 1 for a table of 5 people. The salsa should of came out with our chips. No one in our family even liked the chips because they were too greasy. 2nd my sliver-wear had food on it when I opened it up. 3rd they brought out my ribs and they were cold, as well as my vegetables. The ribs weren't worth the price at all. 4th thing is it took almost 10 minuets to get a refill on my drink. Yes the manager gave us a free dessert but she should of took my meal off the bill. This was by far the worst service I've ever have had here. I will never be coming back after the service my family and I had tonight. Didn't have a good family dinner here at all. Don't come here if you are looking for great service. The manager was nice but that's the only good thing I can say about our visit. We have been here two hours now and have been done with dinner for awhile now and still haven't gotten our check. Just say no and go somewhere else."
Eddie C.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",43,1,,2.0,8/2/2015,Poor customer service. Waiter was not attentive to our needs.  Appetizers took nearly 20 mins to come to the table. Entrees didn't come out at the same time...hated this experience!
Karen F.,"Oceanside, CA",0,10,3,2.0,11/22/2014,Came in from out of town to have a nice diner with my parents and sister they had some dance group took up 5 tables and one man yellin to the group. Management allowed this man to yell across the restaurant disturbing everyone's diner will never come back
Stanley R.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,21,7,4.0,9/26/2015,"Good service, clean establishment, and great menu options. Im on a low carb diet and they were very accommodating to meet my needs."
Doug D.,"Oceanside, CA",0,26,6,1.0,5/17/2015,Just ate here and my family and I are very disappointed. The waiter was bad and checked on us only once. Our appetizer was brought after our meals where almost done because they forgot. The manager gave it to us on the house (just the appetizer) and when the bill came they charged us for items we didn't even order.. Thank god my wife checked because I just handed the card off to pay without looking. Make sure to check what your paying for.. I could have paid an additional $20 by accident. I'll go to chilies next time since it's right up the road.
Travis T.,"Mission Viejo, CA",186,197,26,2.0,7/27/2013,"Walked in with a party of 5. Not very busy. Took about 5 minutes to get seated because they had to clean off a table.  I ordered Steak / chicken fajitas with the steak cooked medium rare. They did a good job on that. Mucho margarita was just not good though, could barely taste the alcohol and the flavor was just weird. Then I had an Applebeetini and lost all remaining manliness I had left, and even that tasted very weak.  I don't know, I'm not usually one to complain too much, but it was just a sub par evening for the place I think."
