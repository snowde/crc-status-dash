Jonescarp J.,"Oceanside, CA",1,51,2,2.0,11/19/2013,"I hadn't been to an Applebee's for 15 years and was invited along to a friends birthday celebration. They had a couple menus with alot of the same items. Many blackened and cajun spiced items. I can't do dank spices so i ordered fish and chips The service was good.  the utensils were clouded up and two of us had to ask for replacements. They brought the others in our party their food and it became clear they had forgotten to place my order. They began eating and there I sat.  A manager came over and asked if we were missing a meal. When I said yes, he offered a Ceasar salad on the house. By the time I'd taken two bites, my meal came. The fish and chips were good. the desserts were good. I wish my order had not been forgotten but, sh*t happens. I would not go back again anytime soon due to everything on the menu being spiced. I want to taste my food, not the spicing."

Jenna H.,"Oceanside, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/14/2016,They forgot to put dressing on my oriental chicken roll up... Very disappointed as I did car side to go and couldn't get it added on. Wrap and fries were extremely soggy as well. Oh well.
Becca L.,"Vista, CA",12,18,1,5.0,11/12/2015,"Went here for Veterans Day so my dad could have his free meal and be happy for the day! Im the adult daughter so of course Dad told me to go in and see how long the wait was. I didn't understand that there was a table outside calling out numbers, so I asked the hostess inside how long the wait was. She said ""well I don't know. We're not telling people how long it is going to be"" without any further explanation without me pressing her. She acted fairly rude to be honest, however I understand it was really busy and I'm sure I wasn't the first person to come in and ask which can be frustrating. (However she was much nicer when we finally got seated). I went outside to get us a number, and the outside hostess who was very nice told me it would probably be a 45 minute wait which was really no problem seeing as we were trying to go to Olive Garden before, and had been told that it was at least a 2 hour wait. Anyways, got sat down, was greeted very nicely by our server Alex (who I think my dad stressed out a little, sorry!!) and he got our drinks very quickly, and refilled them really quickly when we had finished them. Alex, thank you so much for your kind service and making my dads dinner special. I would also like to reach out to you and say thank you so much for being so kind to my little sister and giving her a refill; she is a very picky eater and will only drink that one thing. Excellent service like always. I hope my dad gave you a nice tip, you really deserve it. As an ex waitress, I understand the struggle."
Dani J.,"Vista, CA",301,232,282,1.0,12/5/2012,"This one time, a few years ago, I went to Applebee's for steak (why...whyy???), and got so grossed out by the bloody, purple artery-type thing jiggling its way out of the meat that I swore I'd never eat at another Applebee's again.  One night a few weeks ago, our friends suggested we all meet for dinner. One of them was craving the queso at Applebee's, so against my better judgement, I obliged rather than pleading nooo. What a mistake that was! We got the aforementioned queso, and much to her disappointment, it was smaller and colder than she remembered it being.  Entrees arrived, and I seriously couldn't believe what I saw. I ordered a burger, thinking hey, can't go wrong with that. It was a small greaseball, and looked like it was thrown on the plate with a small handful of fries. I could have had a SUBSTANTIALLY better burger and fries (and soda!) for half the prize at Carls Jr.  My boyfriend got chicken fingers thinking the same thing, can't screw up chicken fingers. Wrong again! They were tiny (notice a trend here?), so overcooked they were hard and chewy, and once again, a small handful of fries thrown on the plate. They should start using smaller plates, at least it wouldn't look so barren and sh*tty. He was starving, and he didn't even eat half. Which in Applebee's portions is like a tablespoon of chicken fingers. Also, their honey mustard is gross. I don't get how people eat here. With choices like Chilis, BJs, etc. where the food actually tastes good, it is just a mystery to me.  You know what the worst part about all of it was? Paying $40+ for 2 small crappy meals, a soda, a beer, splitting an app that is just chips and dip, and leaving hungry. If you are questioning whether you want to give Applebee's another shot, maybe it's changed, maybe it's better...don't do it!!!!  Only positive is that the server was a sweet woman."
Adrian L.,"Oceanside, CA",15,2,4,2.0,1/14/2015,Will probably not be returning to this location ever again. Over 40 min between placing my drink order and actually getting food. The service here is second to none in Oceanside in a bad way. Food was average but could honestly have made my wife's burger at home and would have came out way better. Definitely not worth the waste of time and aggravation.
Sayaka B.,"Waynesville, MO",52,105,50,3.0,6/21/2013,"It was nice that I didnt have to wait more than 5mins to eat on saturday. people working there were friendly, food was ok but I am not so fun of eating here actually since nothing seemed to be special or original."
Jenelle J.,"Sacramento, CA",111,421,102,4.0,9/29/2014,"Decent food, the four cheese grille with tomato bisque was really good. Not worth $9 though. But everyone liked their food, the service was fast and friendly, and the tables were always clean. Thanks for the late night dinner after a long day of work."
karla P.,"Carlsbad, CA",1,17,,2.0,12/30/2014,"One star for a nice waitress and a good manager, one star for a great house salad. However, the mac and cheese was so gross I couldn't eat it. No cheese and some kind of honey sauce mixed with onions.  Shrimp had the poop vein still in it. Bread stick was stale and bland. Ugh.  I don't care if it is a chain, they should have some pride in the food.  It needs a lot of help. The manager was  very nice, staff was just great. They offered me another dish, free dessert or to take it off the bill, but I didn't want either, I just wanted them to know why I wouldn't eat there again.  The manager still took it off the check.  I left the waitress a tip as if they didn't.  Hard to post a negative when staff was amazing, but the food was  worse than the hospital cafeteria and that is why we pay to go eat. We want clean, good food."
Jessica R.,"Oceanside, CA",49,50,6,4.0,3/27/2013,Haven't had food here but there happy hour is awesome. $3 for a long beach tea.. soo yummy! Staff is ok not the best but I just love the $3 long beach tea..really good!  Wednesday night they have trivia too which I want to try one time!
Mike M.,"Oceanside, CA",307,24,22,4.0,8/29/2014,The host Michael was very friendly and helpful.  Had a cowboyburger and boy it was good!   The artichoke dip could of been better.   Overall good experience!
Yojaynat C.,"Vista, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/8/2015,"We got the 2 for $25 steak meals. My steak was yummy and came out as ordered, medium. The mixed vegetables were not dead and overcomes. They were still crunchy, broccoli was green."
Jeremy C.,"Vista, CA",27,30,21,4.0,3/14/2011,"Not bad. I ordered the cajun shrimp pasta. It's new and looked pretty delicious in the 13 pictures of it through out the menu. I was expecting spicey... not spicey. Service was pretty slow for a random thursday evening. But I really can't complain, gave me ample time to chat it up with the girlfriend. Over-all, it wasn't the best dining experience because of that what I already mentioned. But I wasn't expecting (or wanting/caring) to get five star service. Drinks were delicious and our service was great!! Those two things alone earned three stars in my book. Sometimes I'm just very easy to please. This was one of those nights."
Leslie R.,"Vista, CA",9,9,,4.0,11/22/2015,"I went to applebees last friday nov 13 with 8 other ladies from my senior mobile home park. the service was very good - they kept checking on us to make sure all was ok - and the other ladies seemed to like their dinner choices. i had the triple hog dare ya which was very good. i substituted onion rings for the fries at an additional cost but was disappointed at the small portion of rings. even the other ladies noticed the small amount. they know i love onion rings. other than that, i would give it 5 stars."
Liz L.,"Charleston, SC",147,466,27,2.0,1/11/2010,"You can tell how bored I am to be reviewing Applebee's.  What do you think Applebee's is going to be? Just like Chili's or Friday's or (insert chain name here) with a different theme?  Exactly. We went to Crapplebee's (Greg gets credit for that one) because we got a gift card.  So: The server was really, really, really nice.  So there is one star for that.  The other star is for their dessert shooters which are great because they are cheap and not huge and perfectly satisfied my craving for chocolate mousse and oreos.   But oh man. I got the chicken/steak fajita combo and got rid of it as fast as I ate it if you know what I mean. Holy goodness it made me sick.  It tasted good while I ate it but I would never, never eat it again. They are nice (stupid?) enough to publish their nutritional content in a booklet at the table. They have dishes that are over 2000 calories per dish.  Should that be legal? Do they REALLY have to make it that awful for you?  I think you'd be better off going somewhere else."
Bob J.,"Oceanside, CA",109,382,34,4.0,5/5/2014,"Casual dining like every other Applebee's, but that's the point - I know exactly what I'm getting.  The food is good, portions reasonable, and pricing fair.  I can almost always find something on the 2 for $20 menu, and I'm pleased they added a salad option (House or Caesar) instead of the usual fried appetizers,  You can get out of here for under $30 with a pretty decent meal.  Service and ambience varies with time of day.  It can be noisy and slow sometimes, but not intolerable."
Susanna H.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,18,,5.0,3/7/2015,"Colton is an awesome server! 10 stars! Very laid-back, but attentive! Only bad thing thing I can say is that the male bartender tonight seemed like a total a**h***, but Colton almost made us forget about the poor drink service! Will totally be back!"
Realtor Karl B.,"San Diego, CA",59,1973,16,4.0,10/6/2012,"2 for $20 deal totally fills you up, you may even take some food to go. Only gripe is that this place is really busy on the weekends, be prepared for a long wait.... I wish they had more dessert options."
Jennell F.,"Oceanside, CA",0,3,6,5.0,9/21/2014,Outstanding. Personal service. Attention to detail. Exceed exceptions. My thanks to the manager Michelle for overseeing what turned out to be one of the best dining experiences I have had in a blue moon!  Can you say freshly prepared Won Ton Tacos!
Cortney S.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",0,23,1,2.0,9/20/2014,"Decided to eat here because it was something different and I hadn't been for a very long time. We ordered our drinks and burgers quickly. The service wasn't bad but the burgers were EXTREMELY greasy. We were not impressed at all. It was by far the greasiest burger I've ever eaten, and I don't plan on going back any time soon."
