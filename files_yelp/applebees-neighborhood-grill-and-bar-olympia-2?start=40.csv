Tori C.,"Issaquah, WA",0,3,,5.0,7/5/2015,"Curtis was our server tonight, the exemplary service he provided right off the bat set the tone for the night! We got our food in a good amount of time and our specifications were all met. Will 100% return when home boy Curtis is working."
Shannon M.,"Olympia, WA",0,12,,4.0,4/6/2016,"I have in the past had horrible service at Applebee's, so I didn't go there for several years because of it.  I decided to give them another chance and was very happy with the service I received!  They were friendly and attentive, food was good.  They have redeemed themselves for me and I will most likely be going back."
Jennie H.,"Olympia, WA",25,14,27,1.0,3/15/2015,"Low-calorie meals shouldn't mean low portions!!  Last I checked, Romain lettuce doesn't cost that much.  $11 for the portion of a two-year old!!!"
Violet V.,"Olympia, WA",61,15,,4.0,2/22/2013,"Excellent steaks, attentive service and REALLY good prices. Came here on a Friday night, they very busy but we were able to get a seat in the bar right away. Decided on the 2 for $20 deal, and both ended up ordering the same thing: sirloin steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables. Shared the buffalo chicken ""wings"", which were the only ""eh"" part of the meal. Weren't terrible, but wouldn't order again. The steaks were PERFECT, tender and juicy. Vegetables were cooked well but bland and could have been fresher. Not bad though. All the wait staff were very friendly and attentive, really awesome service.  Only complaints: Upon being served, waitress asked us to slice into our steaks to check if done to our liking. Although it was nice of her to make sure, this resulted in a lot of juices running from the steaks. :( Would have preferred to let it rest a minute first, but didn't want to refuse the request. Seems like this  practice is Applebee's policy, should be reconsidered in my opinion. Girlfriend wanted a beer, but selection was limited. Do people actually drink Coors? 0_o Anyways, she went with a Pyramid Haywire which ended up costing $5.50!? Way too pricey for a mediocre beer, will definitely hit happy hour or skip beverages next time. Overall, the service, really yummy food, and great value mean we will definitely be back. :)"
Steve L.,"Olympia, WA",0,22,,3.0,12/20/2015,"Average food. Very friendly and welcoming staff. Social atmosphere. Pretty efficient, but uneven at times."
Nicki G.,"Elma, WA",0,4,,3.0,1/20/2016,"We had a late lunch (1:30-2:00 pm) on Tuesday Jan. 19,2016 the restaurant was not busy so we got good service and the high-lite of the meal was the really hot, hot platters the sirloin steak was served on I ordered rare and it was a little tough my husband order med. rare and his was wonderful. Two things turned a great meal into a bad experience at this restaurant. There is a computer contraption on the table which the waitress was showing us how to look at the desserts so while waiting for our food we were messing around with this thing only to find out when we got the bill there was a $2.00 (that's right Two Dollars) charge for using this thing. These either need a very large notice that there is a charge for touching or remove them from the table. Talk about a sting that surely was one. The cheese cake banana cracker jack thumbs down."
Leah S.,"West Deptford, NJ",6,2,,5.0,9/5/2014,"Well I just had a great experience, I went in for the endless ribs and they were really good (I liked the asian sauce the most). The servers were awesome, always getting us napkins, sauces, filling drinks, and just making sure we were okay. Once I got done my first plate of ribs they had a second one at the table. Props to this Applebee's, they really worked together and made our experience fantastic. I am definitely going to applebee's again, most likely for their late night happy hour."
Jon Y.,"Olympia, WA",0,4,,1.0,2/6/2016,"I have been going to this Applebee's for well over 2 years now.  It used to be great you walk in get a seat relatively quick and service with a smile and they were always willing to wrk with you.  What true service should be.  I don't know if this place is under new management or they just don't care anymore, but I had my worst experience in a restaurant that I have ever had yesterday.   First they could find a place for us to get service.  Mind you that it was just me and my wife.  Then the beat they could come up with was for us to sit in the bar area.  So we take a seat get comfortable and her come the bar tender to take our order.  She ask for our ID.  My wire is in her mid thirties and I am in my mid forties.  My wife did not have her ID and they said they had to move us because it was policy to ask for an ID.  Oh we were not ordering drinks either just food.  Then we moved and sat there for around 5 to 10 minutes in a restaurant that was dang near empty and not one server came to the table.  The bar tender could have work with us a talked to a manager to make an exception but instead they wanted to inconvenience the customer.  So we left went next door to the Olive Garden and receive the service that everyone should get when going to a restaurant.  I will not go to this Applebee's again."
Monty H.,"West Seattle, Seattle, WA",40,45,56,4.0,12/28/2013,Stopped in for dinner. The place was packed and we got in really quickly even with a party of 6. The food came out piping hot and was very tasty. There are several restaurants in the area but we choose this place because of the short wait.  Next time I'm in this area I will stop here again.
Tess S.,"Detroit, MI",146,302,523,3.0,6/1/2012,"Just your average Applebee's, not as busy as the one in Lacey. Prices are decent enough, alcohol prices only worth it during happy hour. Happy hour also brings selected half price appetizers! And the 2 for 20 deal isn't too bad either. Long story short...  it's way more fun if you sit at the bar."
Matt R.,"Olympia, WA",1,11,12,5.0,6/5/2015,Genesis is fantastic! So fun and great to interact with. She treated us (a table of cackling 20 y/o's) with respect and humor!
Kayla W.,"Olympia, WA",8,16,6,5.0,2/23/2013,"The best Applebee's I've been to! The food was so good and so was the service! Everyone was wry friendly and I liked how the manager actually took time to stop by every table and make sure things were good. Since the remodel, the place looks fresher and nicer!"
Sarah E.,"Olympia, WA",67,599,71,2.0,10/24/2012,"I used to love Applebee's....when I was a kid. I came here for a kid's b-day party and even though we had a large group, they seated us and waited on us very quickly. The reason why my review is so low is the food. It seems like everything served here comes out of a bag or can and NOTHING is fresh. I seriously can't imagine how much preservatives and high fructose corn syrup is in their food.  They do have a great dinner deal for two people where you share an appetizer and each get an entree for $20. We tried their buffalo wings, which were 99% breading and 1% chicken so it tasted like a bread ball drenched in buffalo sauce. Eh gross. The entree selections were dominated by shrimp, which I am allergic to so that eliminated 5 of the 8 possibilities for me. We ended up trying the riblet basket and the oriental chicken salad. The salad hardly had any lettuce, and was mostly dried noodles and almonds. Weird, and gross. The riblets were good. The BBQ sauce was alright, and overall it was OK. They were having happy hour, which is a pretty good deal. I had a hurricane and it was very strong and delish for only $5. I needed all of that booze to get me through the crap food. Overall the service is great, but the food is gross. I ended up paying for it later that day."
N A.,"Washougal, WA",5,20,,2.0,10/24/2011,"Waiter was great and attentive, but the food was just off -- fajitas overseasoned; jalapeños on burger were sweet (never had that before); a special order of fajitas (without meat) came half-size (you'd think they'd give extra veggies); and it took way too long to arrive.  Just stick to simple food and read the menu carefully and maybe you'll be alright."
Jonathan F.,"Olympia, WA",4,6,1,3.0,2/29/2012,"I imbibed the mack m jacks which came in a particularly frosty glass, it also had a excellent head. As far as food goes I ordered the bourbon street chicken n shrimp the flavors where pleasing to my palate though the chicken was a bit dry."
Linda C.,"Raymond, WA",0,25,,1.0,2/7/2014,My husband and I went there yesterday afternoon for lunch. We were startled by the hostess who opened the door for us. I would rather do that myself. She asked if we wanted to be seated at the bar. We chose our own table. The service was less than I expected. The food was also less than I expected. my husband 's club sandwich was sloppy and did not look like a club sandwich. No choices for vegetarians and the food all looked like it came out of a package. The coffee was terrible. Overpriced and under served and we will not be back. We had to wait too long for our check as it was not very busy.
