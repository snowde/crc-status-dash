Jennifer V.,"Orlando, FL",40,2,,3.0,12/7/2017,"Food was great and our server Keysha and David were just amazing!! However, we had a really bad experience as soon as we walk in, we were wanted to seat at the bar and the bartender on duty (Shelby) did not want to take the table, she was just ignoring us and screaming to the hostess (in front of the guests) because he let us sit on there. Besides that everything was good."
Steve V.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,22,,1.0,12/5/2017,"I read some reviews that rated service at this location as very poor, but it was 9:45 PM on a Wed night and we need to get dinner. The ""greeter"", wearing a baseball cap and smelling strongly of alcohol fumbled with the menus and led us to a table.  After about 5 mins Sarah arrives.  IMHO she was as high as a kite - rambling loudly on, telling us her life story....except the part where she could not remember whether Los Angeles was in California or not. She takes our drink orders and disappears for 5 mins, stopping by to say the drinks will be ready in a minute.  This seems odd as there were only two other couples besides us there.  Eventually, she brings our drinks but tells me that mine was not mixed correctly, but she thought I would like it better this way.  What????  I told her to take it back and have it mixed correctly, which she did. The food arrives (15-20 mins after ordering) and it is typical Applebee's - not flashy, but it tastes good.  Our only issue was with the servers. Management needs to get a ""secret shopper"" in there ASAP and see what is going on.  There is a reason for all the poor reviews and why Chili's down the street is full of people and they are practically empty. Do yourself a favor, until it is re-staffed, go elsewhere."
Linda R.,"Port Orange, FL",0,6,1,1.0,10/7/2017,Place is empty Still an hour wait  Short staff lol The executives should visit there restaurants  Maybe they won't go out business  So stupid. Left and went elsewhere
Mitch W.,"Orlando, FL",102,32,,1.0,1/2/2018,It's an Applebee's... should have been my first clue but me and my husband were starving and just saw it and said what the heck. It looks brand new inside on first glance. Very nice. But as we passed empty table after empty table (at dinner time...) we saw that none of the tables had been cleaned from previous guests. Nasty. Our server was actually really rude and never refilled our drinks once. Took our orders and brought the food out with no explanation about missing ingredients from the meal. When asked he just goes 'we're out'. Would have been nice to know before we got our meals with sides missing and no sauce....  no apology or offer to fix the issue at all. The server just walked away ... anyways won't be returning
Shaunty C.,"Jacksonville, FL",30,49,210,3.0,4/9/2017,I came here to get something to eat after sight seeing and fun times in Orlando. We came in and no one was at the desk. We had to wait for someone to come and seat us which is fine. The waiter was nice and food came out in a pretty timely manner. The food was seasoned really well. It just sucks we had to go search for our waiter because we was ready to go. The experience could be better since it wasn't super busy at the time we came but the food was good.
Vanessa C.,"Orlando, FL",955,147,632,5.0,7/13/2016,"Just visited this place for lunch, brand new, they opened last Monday.  Beautiful!  Nice decor, super friendly & knowledgeable staff.  We were sat and the host present us with the day specials and mentioned it is Ladies night so gave us the information on it and the time it will start (4pm).  They have all drinks specials on the table so you wont miss a thing! I really liked the menus, clean, pictures are great, food really look delicious and to my surprise, when lunch arrived, it looked exactly as it did on the menu (we all know that doesn't happens often). For been a lunch plate the portions were just perfect and it tasted delicious and very fresh.  Our server did a great job and was super friendly.  I will be back for happy hour for sure and hope I have the same great experience I had during lunch."
Mikey R.,"Atlanta, GA",0,5,,1.0,12/3/2017,Service was very slow. Servers stood around like they had nothing to do as I sit with a empty glass. Food took over 30 mins Then when I got my check the server said tips not included. Well duh but do you really need a tip . I wouldn't recommend going here unless you want slow service
Nicole G.,"Orlando, FL",111,1,,5.0,11/16/2017,If you come here go see Victer! He's amazing he makes you feel so comfortable and bet bartender I've ever seen. He could be busy and still make you feel like you're the only person there. Every other bartender is bleh.
John C.,"Concord, NC",144,107,430,1.0,11/13/2016,"I can't begin to say how disappointed I am with the service and food quality that Applebee's gave me today. We ordered some appetizers and 2 meals. I am not exaggerating that within 1 hour the only thing we had received was our cups of water.  Finally, when we were tired of eating the lime from our water, the food arrived! The appetizers and the entrées got there at the same time. I got the chicken and it was pretty good.  My gf on the other hand did not have anything near a ""pretty good"" meal. Her soup was cold. Her Steak quesedilla literally had one peice of meat and her burger egg rolls were the only thing that came out warm.  The waiter was too serious and seemed like he wanted to go home already. He was also extremely forgetful and not tentative to detail. If I were a waiter and I had to warm up someone's food because it was cold, then I'd make sure to be on top of it and make the rest of the experience the best, but he did not. Very disappointed."
Robert C.,"Orlando, FL",16,22,2,2.0,10/28/2017,"We are regulars here and our lunch experience last week was terrible mostly service the hostess was never to be found the manager had to come up and seat tables while the hostess would be walking around talking, we saw our server once never got a refill had to ask for the check and then we waited and waited until we were told to use the on table tablet to pay ....I really missed that refill could not anyone's attention to get one to go"
Mandy T.,"Fairless Hills, PA",0,3,,1.0,12/1/2017,"My car side order was late and wrong but the mistake was caught while there. The guy that corrected everything was super nice and I thought we were good to go until we got back to the hotel. Sandwiches were good, but the fries, mozz sticks, and onion rings were nasty so we didn't eat them. My kid's ""Mountain Dew"" was not Mountain Dew. I didn't allow them to drink it since it was a mystery. Bad first impression."
Gary H.,"Okaloosa Island, FL",3,1,,5.0,2/11/2017,I ordered baked French onion soup.  It was brought to our table half full I complained and I guess that's the way they serve it now  So I paid $5.00 for a half bowl of soup I was ticked
Andrew N.,"Davenport, FL",7,3,,1.0,10/28/2017,Saturday night....10+ tables available and nobody seating the crowd of 30 people taking over the restaurant. And no manager present or explanation. What a joke. Don't go to this Applebee's. Horrible customer service.
Carol G.,"Reading, PA",0,9,2,1.0,11/13/2017,Visiting family in area... gave this place 3 chances for simple late night cocktails. DONE! This place will NOT make it... too much competition around. The manager needs to WAKE UP ...  I am a frequent Applebee's fan but this place is off my list!
Scott S.,"Washington, United Kingdom",0,1,,1.0,8/18/2017,"Blown away by how poor the service was here. The server we got was clearly on drugs and in a real mess. The fact that his supervisor was letting him deal with the public, and in particular young families, was a disgrace. We ended up leaving without eating. Been to Applebee's before and enjoyed it but last night has put me right off!"
Leslie C.,"Miami, FL",277,85,426,2.0,11/12/2016,"Where do I start? First of all, our food took forever. Second, my food was cold. Third, when they took my food to warm it up they completely forgot that they had taken it until we asked them the soup was missing at which point everyone was done with their food. Fourth, the food was terrible. The steak quesadilla had one piece of steak for each tortilla and the soup looked like water with pieces of vegetables. Lastly, when my soup came in, it was still COLD! Oh and the waiter seemed like he wanted to go home, extremely unenthusiastic and serious. I love Applebee's, but this one was the worst I've ever been to. He seemed clueless about what's on the menu. Let's see how long it takes for us to get check. (Yes I wrote this while still eating of how disappointed I am)"
Brenda S.,"Medford, MA",1,35,16,4.0,3/22/2017,Very good food servers can be a little more attentive but all and all it's very good not busy quiet atmosphere
Valentina P.,"Southwest Orlando, Orlando, FL",67,1,,1.0,9/14/2017,"This is probably the worst place to eat. It took 30 minutes to get my food. Also my chicken taste like frozen chicken, no taste at all. I'm leaving so sad, I was really  hungry. Btw the manager and bartender are really nice. The problem was te kitchen, obviously the most important thing in a restaurant. Sorry Applebee's I never come back again . Thanks"
Paige C.,"Houston, TX",15,14,1,5.0,1/22/2017,"After a full day of travel, regretfully this was our only option for dinner. Turns out it was amazing- our waitress Ashley was so nice, our food came our super quick, and the drink specials were just what we needed after a long flight. Definitely recommend!"
Sabre T.,"Town N Country, Tampa Bay, FL",138,47,32,1.0,7/30/2016,Setting was OK.  Servers food without utensils.  Had to ask 3 times.  Still only got got 4 of 5 settings.  Couldn't get a refill to save my life.  Had to repeat my order several times after being ignored at the table.  And the food was like a school room cafeteria.  My buyer tasted like a frozen soybean burger.
Curtis A.,"Columbus, GA",26,4,,1.0,8/10/2017,"Placed a to go order, two salads, what could go wrong?  Got back to my hotel and there was absolutely nothing on the chicken Caesar salad except chicken and lettuce!  Not a single drop of dressing.  The southwest chicken salad had chicken so dry and burnt that I simply threw it away.  Terrible!!!!  Don't order take away or be prepared to throw your money away!"
Tatyana S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",6,3,2,1.0,1/1/2016,"I order from the menu online the Asiago sirloin with potatoes and vegetables and this is what I got. 4 very small slices of meat,  some over cooked spinach, 4 pieces of mushrooms and some grains.  I called back when I saw it and whoever picked up the phone was rude and argued with me.  Lesson learned. Won't be back."
Raul G.,"Orlando, FL",129,9,31,1.0,10/29/2016,"The star is for the food. The service was horrible. It started as we walked through the door and asked for a booth (the place was empty) and they said no, ""the waiter wasn't here yet"". We waited for about 20 minutes before we had to get up and ask for someone to assist. Drinks took another 15 minutes. We had to ask another waiter to get out waiter about 3 times. Just turn around if you are considering eating here."
Karl S.,"La Jolla, CA",0,14,1,2.0,9/13/2016,"It appears that the waiting staff is completely clueless when it comes to good customer service. First, our waitress forgot to bring us the utensils. Then she brought the wrong order (chicken instead of shrimp). She also never filled our water glasses or checked on us.  The food was okay."
Jess M.,"Orlando, FL",0,7,,5.0,5/17/2017,Went in on Mother's Day and had a great dinner . This place has always been nice and clean.  We had Manny as our server he was the best !!!! Very caring and made us feel welcomed . He was also funny .
Mike N.,"Grand Rapids, MI",50,13,1,5.0,10/7/2016,"Usually not a big fan of Applebee's, but since we were at the tail end of Hurricane Matthew,  not much was open. Considering the amount of people waiting, and the amount of wait staff was working, they did an awesome job!! Service was great, food was hot, and we had a great time!! Daniel was our waiter, and he was great along with everyone that dropped food off to the table. Drinks got refilled, and he checked in several times. Well done Daniel and the staff at Applebee's.  You made this family happy!! Recommend this location!"
CAROLINE T.,"Orlando, FL",8,19,,1.0,7/20/2017,"Our server was Brittany and my check number was 7690-59685. I was with 2 other people. There check is probably the one either before mine or after mine in the queue. They had 2 of the 8.49 lunch specials. It took our waitress 6 minutes to bring drinks then she took the order. Their meal which is gauranteed in 15 minutes or under came at minute 19. My meal was originally the Apple cranberry chicken dish for 11.99. It came out tasteless and the chicken was severely overcooked. I sent it back and asked to change to the 8.49 Caesar chicken salad. She said sure. The salad came. No crutons and barely any cheese. The chicken was again extremely overcooked. I was not.offered a drink which comes with that offer. I had a water already so i guess she thought that was all i wanted. We asked to see the manager but she stated he was in the kitchen cooking. I would have gotten a better salad if i went and bought a fresh express prepackaged bag and added canned chicken. The service and the food was very disappointing. There should have been whatever compensation is applied if the 15 minute meal is late for my friends check. That restaurant needs retraining, apparently a chef and to learn the correct way to take care of a customer."
Veronica L.,"Winter Park, FL",0,2,,1.0,12/21/2016,"Got take out with a coupon. Was still a gip. Ordered the burger with all the trimmings and pink in the middle. The burger was overcooked and had no trimmings--no tomato, lettuce, onion, pickles. It was completely inedible. Will never return."
Jonathan D.,"San Diego, CA",79,6,3,2.0,4/4/2015,The service sucks! You would expect for such a prime location that they would be efficient and turn tables over. But we stood and waited while so many tables remained open and dirty waiting to be cleaned and reset. Hire more staff!!
Lynn T.,"Ankeny, IA",70,20,15,1.0,1/5/2015,"Would recommend this location if you like slow service, and your server handing you a dirty dish to feed your baby off of it. The bourbon steak tasted horrible accompanied with a side of burnt grease taste. Delicious. I've been to plenty of Applebee's but this location was downright dirty/unclean and service was incredibly slow."
Lance A.,"Statesboro, GA",0,3,3,2.0,2/7/2015,"On the whole, I'm waiting for my shot at a Universal Studios cosplay position. Or so the attitude of the staff seems to say. When we walked into a mostly empty restaurant (at the height of the missing lunch rush), the bartender, hostess and one of three wait staff were crowded into the far corner of the bar chatting. They looked up, went back to their conversation, then the hostess reluctantly, brusquely and without eye-contact led us to our table. The waitress seemed to get lost after each visit to our table.  The food?  Oh you know, it's pre-fab, unfab Applebee's. It was sufficient, but does not inspire one to repeat the experience, except for the quinoa/rice mix that we received too little of. Go, if you must, but go elsewhere I say."
David G.,"Tampa, FL",2,12,,5.0,9/5/2016,"Very nice place, new building, new restaurant, my family went to this place on Friday, it is little busy, serves is good , food is delicious, my son is very happy to eat his spicy chicken wings, he ate clean, I will comeback."
Perry A.,"Sudbury, Canada",14,4,,2.0,1/10/2016,"Although the service was excellent, the food I had here was less than stellar and not worthy of the Applebee franchise!!"
Danny S.,"Port Charlotte, FL",0,2,,1.0,2/25/2017,"We stopped at this applebees and the greeter tried to seat us at a high top. We requested a booth and she sighed like it would be a problem but then she had us follow her to a row of empty booths and told us our server would over shortly. after waiting 5 minutes a waiter walked past us delivering food, we looked up at him expectantly and he asked if we had a server. He then said he just walked in and would come right back. 5 more minutes went by. Two managers walked by and asked if we were being served. We explained what happened and they said they would send someone out. That same waiter came out and tossed 2 napkins on the table then turned around and said he had to get his pad. He was showing attitude at this point, and as he passed a waitress he said ""I just came in and  walked into a nest"" . A few more minutes went by and we decided this was not going to be a good experience, so we went back to the front to find the manager or hostess and no one was in sight, so we left. We will never go back."
John W.,"Orlando, FL",0,4,,1.0,6/19/2016,"A complete mess, stay away....no one knows whats going on and i love applebees but not here again"
Paige M.,"Pemberton, NJ",68,35,19,5.0,3/22/2014,Went here for training day and everything went great :) our server yashy was attentive and awesome :) definitely on the map to come back to.
Julie R.,"Cedar Crest, NM",0,8,1,3.0,2/7/2015,Food very good. Service slow though. Extremely rude hostess started the experience off on a bad note.  Manager must not be here today.
Jarvise A.,"Orlando, FL",1,8,,5.0,1/29/2015,"January 29, 2015 (5*) - My server was bartender Savannah D. She was AWESOME! Served my food on time and made some kick ass margaritas.. Restaurant is spacious and the bar is roomy, lit, and nice. There weren't many customers when I came in around 5pm. It stayed that through my entire dine.. I would definitely recommend and will definitely be back!!"
Sami T.,"Orlando, FL",0,7,,5.0,3/5/2016,"Wow, this Applebee's goes above and beyond. They have great food, great drinks, great service."
Jeremy P.,"Downtown, Saint Louis, MO",17,5,14,1.0,7/10/2014,"Wow! I know most chain restaurants do not specialize in higher quality food, but this was by far the worst meal that my family has ever experienced."
