Arianna M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",17,48,28,2.0,6/10/2014,"At first I thought that the establishment wasn't as crouded because of the poor weather as we were arriving but.... Quickly found out why. The place looks clean and nice and the staff were friendly. We were sat right away and within minutes the waitress took our order. Food came out fast. Presentation was poor, more on the sloppy side look. It didn't taste great either. I guess my expectations were a bit higher than they should have. Never have been an Applebee's fan."
