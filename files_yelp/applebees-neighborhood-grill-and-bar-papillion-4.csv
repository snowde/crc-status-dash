Ryan H.,"Papillion, NE",21,40,49,4.0,6/4/2017,"One of my favorite places to go when I'm in the mood for a nice chicken pasta or a good time with friends. Service has always been friendly, not too many issues with them. Some times I you may get someone that is inexperienced, but so is life. Food deals are wonderful and the prices are overall fair. Never had an issue with size proportions and time after ordering -- always comes out on-time. Food is great too!"
Lianna N.,"Omaha, NE",361,1033,7522,3.0,12/19/2017,"I mean...it's Applebees. You should know what to expect. The service at this location was better than others around Omaha that I have patronized.  Nice staff, timely food service, and clean bathrooms and tables. We usually only crave Applebees a few times a year and mainly come for the 1/2 off apps when we're in a junk food binge. I always enjoy the spinach artichoke dip and the mozzarella sticks!"
Natasha S.,"Papillion, NE",44,82,137,3.0,3/10/2017,"Went here for lunch, was pretty empty and got seated very quickly. Restaurant was very clean, server was ok and surprisingly enough the food was pretty good. I had the cedar grilled lemon chicken and my husband had the stir fry. All in all, nothing stood out great, and it is what I remembered of Applebee's before in the past."
Mike S.,"Papillion, NE",4,69,,3.0,2/25/2017,"This is an average Applebee's. Foods fine, prices are fine, service is usually fine. Every once in a while you get a server who doesn't want to be there, but otherwise it's ok.  Restaurant, tables and silverware are always clean, so there's that."
David T.,"Bellevue, NE",20,25,5,2.0,8/10/2017,We usually love this restaurant. Friendly faces and good food. Nice and clean.  Tonight we waited for 40 minutes after being sat before leaving. Our server took our order after about 25 minutes and we never talked to her again. We know she was new but after waiting 15 more minutes without ever seeing her again we had to leave. Hopefully next time will be better.
Maxine L.,"Papillion, NE",71,9,10,5.0,5/22/2017,"My family's go-to place for comfort food! We keep coming back because we have always loved their food and service, and their prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity. In fact, we have never ordered anything we did not enjoy.  They have fantastic pasta selections. My favorites are: Spinach + Artichoke Chicken Cavatappi, Three-Cheese Chicken Cavatappi, and Four-Cheese Mac + Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders. I actually just order any of those three because they are that good! I don't know why, but I noticed that they are twice as yummy when I reheat my leftovers at home. So don't finish all of that pasta and leave some for those to-go boxes! (But I can't blame you if you can't help but finish everything.) If you have never dined at Applebee's, you are missing out!"
Christye G.,"Iowa City, IA",231,476,1272,5.0,10/23/2016,This is my special place to eat with my mother. We always get the Chicken Fajita Roll-Up. We call ahead so we don't have to wait.
Meredith M.,"Vancouver, WA",69,184,,3.0,9/25/2016,We placed a very large to go order for a family dinner.  Aunt wanted Applebee's so we put together our order and my husband called it in.   I give them credit because it was an order of about 7 different entrees some with very special preferences in terms of toppings etc.   My cousin and husband went to go pick it up and it was ready.  They made the mistake of not checking the entire order to make sure it was all there.   One of the entree's was missing so we had to go back and pick it up.    The food isn't that bad considering but keep in mind it's nothing gourmet.
Ben S.,"Omaha, NE",104,5,,2.0,6/30/2016,"We just waited 15 minutes for our waitress, so draw your own conclusions about the place. I'm giving two stars because I have faith in the mozzarella sticks we're waiting for. *Update* Mozz sticks we're good. Not enough to bump to three stars though."
John P.,"Papillion, NE",0,65,,1.0,8/18/2017,Have you heard the expression.....3 strikes and your out.....well a third visit....same results.....poor quality food....high price for what you receive and services that would rank below a fast food restaurant......The ad agency should receive a bonus for their marketing of Applebees.....no truth...just hype.....in today's market there are numerous restaurants that are good.....this is not one of them.
Jennifer P.,"Denver, CO",68,257,748,3.0,11/23/2015,"I have never really been a fan of Applebee's and didn't really want to go on this particular occasion. But, my husband wanted to go since we hadn't been in a while. We were seated promptly and got our drinks right away. Pepsi. (Yuck!) Then we sat there and waited at least 10 minutes for our server to come back to take our order. And we finally had to flag down another server and ask to send ours over. We got the 2 for $20 deal. For our appetizer we got the mozzarella sticks which were good. I got the chicken tenders with fries and my husband got the riblets with fries. I thought the food was good, but the portions seemed pretty small compared to the 2 for $20 deal that you get at Chili's which we get often. Overall the service got better. I think because our server knew I was severely agitated for the wait earlier. I think it will be a while before we go back."
Clint W.,"Bellevue, NE",29,3,,1.0,7/16/2017,"I've had good luck with car side to go at other Applebee's locations around the metro, so I decided to patronize this location. I ordered two orders of wings, two orders of shrimp and spinach dip. I showed up 5 minutes prior to my scheduled pick up time, and somehow wound up getting cold food. The wings were soggy and tasted sour, and the shrimp was under sauced. I get mistakes happen, but I find it hard to believe that my entire order was accidentally given to me cold. Won't give this location another chance."
Jeremy S.,"Papillion, NE",0,2,,3.0,3/12/2017,I usally come here often and its a good time. This time me and a buddie sat down and it took 15 or so minutes before we gave the waitress our order. We sat for about another 15 to 20 minutes just to find out that our order was never put in. We then waited the usual wait time to get our food.. the main thing i wanna say is thanks to dani everything got figured out we ended up having a decent time
Cyndi B.,"La Vista, Omaha, NE",40,67,88,1.0,1/10/2017,"This place is literally 3 minutes from my house so it is convenient. We never got great service but the food has been ""okay"" and if we are busy then it's a place we go. I know it's Applebee's so I don't ask for much, give me my food, get me my drink, as long as it tastes ok then I'm content and will tip 20%. Tonight however our server was very inattentive. As everyone else got their drinks I waited. Appetizer came and went. No margarita yet. My food arrived, no drink. I'm thinking, well, the drink has to be next since they are not busy, there's only 2 ppl at the bar, and we already got everything else. Waited few more minutes and then asked the server if I could have my drink. She replied ""drink?"" Yes, my drink order that you took. All she had to say was sorry about the wait and she'll get it now or something but instead she just turned and walked away. Few minutes later she brought my drink. I said thank you of course, but she didn't reply and walked off. Really? I'm not looking for a chatterbox, but you can't say ""you're welcome"" or ""sorry about the wait"" or something like ""need anything else""? Just anything thats shows that you appreciate your customers coming here instead of Chili's down the street? She never stopped by to see if we needed anything the entire time, I had to stop her in her tracks to ask for things a couple of times and even then it's like a big inconvenience to her. She'll just walks off after I ask her politely for something, and drops off whatever I asked for later, and walk away quickly. I always got the burger before and today decided to try the ribs. Those were some dry and tough ribs!!! Nothing like Chili's juicy fall-off the bone ribs. I mean a couple of pieces I can't even get the meat off the bones. Whoever ran that kitchen tonight should be embarrassed. Even with extra BBQ sauce there were pieces I had to swallow whole or just not eat it. It was just a very bad experience. We came here to spent our hard earned money in light of all of the other options close by and we don't deserve to be treated like a nuisance. Total deal breaker."
Curtis P.,"La Vista, NE",4,41,8,5.0,9/19/2016,It's definitely a lot better than the past. In my opinion they have shook off a bad rep from the 90s. We like most of what we have tried and like the rotating menu.
Jason S.,"Papillion, NE",11,27,9,5.0,4/1/2015,"First time I can say that I was able to give ANY Applebee's 5 stars. To start it wasn't overly busy but then again it was Wednesday evening. Our server Christopher was super friendly and was very knowledgable about their new menu. The new menu included their revamped appetizer menu which had quite a few new items including their brisket nachos! Holy crap those alone deserve 10 stars! Gooey cheesy smoky goodness topped with pico, smoked brisket and jalapeño.  Starting today and only on Wednesdays they have $9.99 all you can eat boneless wings with French fries. They start with a full order of a dozen then half orders there after. Worth the price! They have a new system called TED that sits on your table. You can reorder drinks, view your bill and it even has $.99 unlimited games like trivia and games to keep the kiddos busy during the lull between apps and entree.  Big kudos and thumbs up to them and Christopher. We will definitely be back!"
Chris B.,"Bellevue, NE",1,87,11,4.0,2/21/2015,"Great experience. Our server was really on point. Drinks stayed full, food was hot and fresh, and the atmosphere was extremely comfortable. The manager on duty was very involved...delivery food, drinks, stopping by tables to see if everything was up to par. This manager was not something you see often nowadays. He definitely cared about his store. Made for a great night."
Azrael R.,"Bellevue, NE",1,10,,4.0,5/24/2016,I came here with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised when the service was good...and the main course was delicious.  One thing I will mention...the cheeseburger egg rolls were not exactly good. I took a bite and ended up spitting it out. Other than that...great place to eat
Mark J.,"Omaha, NE",2,5,1,5.0,5/2/2014,Great food and good servers. Wednesday night Karaoke is a lot of fun. The Black and Bleu hamburger is one of my favs.
Jayne M.,"La Vista, NE",0,3,,2.0,4/7/2016,"The menu is so ""busy"" Almost everything I thought looked good had an element I didn't care for but they have a hard time with ""no this"" or ""no that"" so I stuck with the Green Goddess wedge salad (excellent) and the tomato basil soup (tasted good but definitely not freshly made).  I could tell immediately that our server was new (even before he told us) and after working in the restaurant industry, I'm always willing to overlook and over tip a new server when they're trying. The problem I had was that a restaurant that puts such an emphasis on appetizers can't bring the apps before the entrée.  Even worse, when they started putting my husband's and son's steaks in front of them, I said we hadn't gotten our appetizers yet and the second runner put the apps down in the middle of the table.  I said we wouldn't be needing the apps since our meal was here, the runner didn't even acknowledge the fact that I had said anything and said our server would be right over to check on us and ran away.  I felt for the poor guy (it was obvious that he didn't have adequate training) and didn't make a fuss, but I did tell the hostess on my way out that I was pretty upset.  So, here I am posting about my disappointing experience for all."
Trekkie M.,"Omaha, NE",5,149,37,3.0,5/6/2013,The service is better at other Applebee's I've been to but it was not horrible.  The ribs i ordered were a little burnt but cooks change out all the time or get better as they go.  No hard feelings and I'm sure I'll stop again.
Josh S.,"Omaha, NE",0,183,15,3.0,2/28/2012,"I live close-by so the convenience factor of the car-side to go pickup is pretty unmatched, but unfortunately the consistency of food quality leaves much to be desired.  I usually get the baby back ribs, but they are seldom cooked perfectly.  Most of the time they are overdone and not as tender as they should be.  The meat never falls off the bone.  I would probably never order a steak here, the chefs just don't seem to have much talent.  Sides are meh, nothing special.  Prices are just average.  I am not compelled to go here on a regular basis, but when I am running late and don't feel like cooking, it is very easy to place an order and pick it up on the way home."
