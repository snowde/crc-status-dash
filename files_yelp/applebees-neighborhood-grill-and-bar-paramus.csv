Praksshal D.,"Hoboken, NJ",26,6,,5.0,12/11/2017,"I went to Applebee's this weekend and had some appetizers with my family. The staff helped my table out through out the night and gave me everything I asked for. Will be coming back, highly recommend!!!"
Gina M.,"Township of Washington, NJ",136,1,1,1.0,12/27/2017,"Bar tender is very rude. Very inconsiderate and disrespectful to all bar guest. I'm never going back here ever again. Their ""policy"" is ludicrous. This was the worst experience I have ever had. Never returning.  & the bar tenders both don't know how to make drinks and dress like slobs why would I ever want to be served by a women who looks like she dug in a trash can?  I was forced to order a drink that I didn't want!! FORCED!! My friend's plate was dirty... disgusting.   Also the bartender did not have a name tag... isn't it ""policy"" to have name tag??? Let me know, Applebee's."
Alyssa C.,"New York, NY",73,168,15,2.0,12/13/2017,"Applebees is Applebees. I'm not expecting much aside from the usual commercialized fare that i'm used to. In this regard, this location delivered. Our server was very nice and accommodating, albeit a little slow. The food was good. We ordered raspberry martinis because we don't mess around, and I truly hated it. I had to water it down because it was so syrupy. It tasted like a melted lollipop. Then, at the end of our meal, we overheard the server next to us offer his customers $1 long island iced teas. We had no idea that this promotion was going on, otherwise we would not have ordered $9 syrup drinks. We tried to express our disappointment to a manager who kind of just stared at us and walked away. 2 stars for mozz stix."
Emma R.,"Waldwick, NJ",67,9,2,1.0,1/4/2018,"Let me start of by saying the manager is terrible. My boyfriend and I went to dinner last night. We ordered the 2 appetizers for 10 something. Chicken wanton tacos and the beer pretzel pub. We got 6 pretzels delivered to our table. We start eating and the waiter comes over and tells us that the appetizer was only supposed to come with 4 pretzels, I'm going to have to bring 2 pretzels back. Let me just say who brings food to our table and then says they need to take it away. We then ask to speak to the manager. The manager made our server try to take the 2 pretzels away. She then comes over and tries to take the pretzels away and we argue and argue and then she charges us for three appetizers for 14 something instead of two appetizers for 10 something. She should of just gave the 2 pretzels to us for free. It was there mistake on there end. BAD SERVICE. THE MANAGER IS NOT IN ANY POSITION TO BE MANAGER. FIRE HER! Everyone doesn't like her. Read the other yelp reviews. If the owner of this apple bees wants to keep his restaurant running then he/she needs to make some changes."
Paris B.,"Westwood, NJ",175,2,,1.0,12/27/2017,"Extremely rude bar tenders and wait staff, flocked with underaged alcohol abusers lookin for ""half apps"". I understand the circumstances of a crowded and overwhelmed bar however my food was served on a dirty plate and half of It was cold. Disjointed."
Chelsea M.,"Emerson, NJ",1,5,,1.0,12/27/2017,"This is the worst service I've ever encountered in my life. First, the manager, Will, would not seat us at a table in the bar section. Second, the bartender Kim refused to serve us unless everyone in our party ordered something. I have been coming to this establishment since I was a young child and I have never heard such a ""policy"" in my life. Third of all, the plates were dirty when they were given to us and we had to send them back. After we sent our plates back it took about 30 minutes for us to receive our food again. Bad service, the staff was not well dressed and our food was disgusting. My LIT looked like a darn Mountain Dew!!! Didn't know LIT were supposed to be neon green. DO NOT COME TO THIS LOCATION EVER!!!!!  IT IS SO DIRTY AND THE WORKERS ARE RUDE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Corey J.,"Forked River, NJ",0,9,2,1.0,12/12/2017,"Went in last Thursday for half-apps. Online It says half-apps start at 9 during weekdays. The manager SCREAMED in my face when we were being seated that we would have to wait until 10 if we wanted half-apps... My friends and I were so startled and taken back that we just sat down and ordered off the regular menu. Being screamed at by a stranger after a long day for literally NO reason is not what I go out to eat for and looking back we should have just left but we were hungry and intimidated. Never returning because of incredibly rude service and of course, their mediocre food."
Jessica M.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",14,293,6,3.0,10/8/2016,"This is a decent Applebee's location.  The hostess who seated us was very nice, as was our waiter.  The spinach dip was yummy, but it would have been even better if they gave us enough chips to eat all the dip. My boyfriend ordered the fiesta lime chicken, and I had the sirloin and grains. We both enjoyed our entrees."
Raul M.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",0,6,4,4.0,9/10/2016,"Wanting a classic cheese burger & a beer, We chose this fun looking place to have lunch. Noticed the front line help aren't the friendliest, But who cares, My wife & I were starving.  My wife ordered the grilled salmon that was over cooked & it cut like cardboard. However, Being hungry, She ate with no fuss.  Our waiter ""Gus"" made us feel comfortable & was very attentive. He made sure that we stayed content throughout our meal. Forgot to mention that my burger was fantastic..."
Jon S.,"Clifton, NJ",3,8,,3.0,10/21/2017,Second visit in 2 months. First time was perfect. This time now so. They were half full so no excuse for the very S L O W service. Food was fine though. Spicy chicken and the sirloin with mashed sides and string beans. The Raspberry lemonade was fine as well.
Nick C.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",325,963,1662,3.0,3/24/2015,"It's Applebee's. For once, I actually had something other than their half price appetizers since I was there before 10pm. We were seated quickly and had our drink orders taken.  The menu has changed significantly since my last visit to an Applebee's. It looks like there are a lot of new appetizers. But I had the Napa Chicken and Portobello entree. It was OK.  I still would only wanna do Applebee's for the late night deal."
Patricia S.,"New Milford, NJ",2,11,14,4.0,10/26/2015,"I'll probably be the only sucker to write more than a 3 star review. The only reason it's not 5 is because no Applebee's I've ever been to could possibly be deserving enough of a 5 star review. Came here with co-workers with big appetites on one of those busy highschool football game nights. (Friday or Saturday usually) it's quite the mess of juvenile obnoxious kids during these days BUT Applebee's was able to keep up with service, refilling our drinks and bringing out all our food which filled an entire table for 6- and quite promptly I might add. What else could a hungry party ask for really? I would pick this Applebee's over another in the area in hackensack."
Catherine L.,"New Milford, NJ",0,1,1,5.0,3/4/2017,"I mean it's aight. The food is bangin' when you hungry. I was with man homies and we got charged like maaan come on my dude whatchu charging 1.99 for? We ordered some chicken and salads, it was delicious. Customer service is chill"
Ashley A.,"Westwood, NJ",117,192,440,2.0,4/18/2016,"Nope! waitress had a poker face, wasn't friendly at all and was as stale as the chips that came with the spinach artichoke dip we ordered. My cheese burger tasted weird so I only had a few bites. And the bun was burnt black on the inside. The fries that came with it were really the best thing on the table and they weren't even all that. My bf's plate came out cold, and he ordered a pint of beer but was served a bottle. I asked for extra sauce with one of our dishes, that never came. And my utensils that came wrapped in a napkin were missing a knife. To top it off the restaurant was freezing cold, and for me that's rare considering I'm always too warm. Very disappointed in our meal and just the dining experience in general. Very depressing to part with that $65 ""meal"""
J C.,"Paterson, NJ",0,38,13,3.0,6/15/2017,"It's a chain restaurant, so the food is frozen. But it's a nice place to hang out and catch up with friends. Just go for the half priced apps. Get soda because the alcoholic beverages are watered down. I've had Hawaiian Punch that tastes stronger than Applebee's sangria. On the weekends this place is packed with high school kids. Blah"
Nikhil B.,"Ridgewood, NJ",0,3,,1.0,6/3/2017,"Worst drinks ever. Margarita was nothing other than sweet sugar syrup with a hint of lime. Complained to the manager and server. Response was we follow a formula. Right OK, that's OK then. Absolutely no effort to remedy. Customer service ..what's that?"
G D.,"Paramus, NJ",0,2,,1.0,6/2/2017,"Unfortunately 0 stars is not an option, or else that is certainly the rating I would choose. I'm extremely disgusted and disappointed with the service that I experienced tonight during my Applebee's visit. As a frequent customer the past 4 years and having spent an obscene amount of money here during that time period, it is a shame that one of the managers (the tall fat one with the long slicked back greasy hair and glasses) felt the need to be one of the rudest human beings I've ever met. After eating normal dinner elsewhere, my friends and I came here because our friend wanted to get her favorite dessert for her birthday. We nicely asked our waiter to sing to her and when they didn't we asked the manager why. He said and I quote: ""Maybe if you guys actually ordered some food instead of sitting here and taking up space (note that there was nobody waiting to be seated at this time) then we could do that for you"". 1. Two of my friends ordered a dessert which they were paying for and 2. If singing was such a problem he could have put it in a gentler, nicer manner considering he is speaking to customers. Last time I checked that isn't the correct way to do so. Telling us that we're basically a waste of space is just a bit insulting, don't ya think???"
Peter M.,"Township of Washington, NJ",42,8,,5.0,11/24/2016,"Amazing service, tasty food. Good prices i always go there and they are super clean , such a polite staff"
Dani S.,"Paramus, NJ",144,159,325,2.0,1/21/2016,"""I'm not saying I don't want to go to Applebee's with you"" - Couples Retreat.  Let's be honest - its Applebees. I think when you go to this place your expectations are not too high to begin with. You know exactly what you get in theory! This place is located in shopping center which is really the only reason you would swing by this place. I am sure if I was 16 again I would think this place is great but sadly I am way past that age. To be this place is just not hitting the spot. Plus I always feel like everything is sticky (menus and tables) and needs a good cleaning. The food is just blah - you know they are heading it up in a microwave in the back. Strangely their wings are the only thing that actually seem to be good but then again you only need to heat those up. If you are in a pinch and just need some quick food - or are with kids - this place will probably work for you. However being on Route 17 were there are 100 other options, I would suggest another one. I will say the service is always nice and friendly!! They are very attentive and always super quick which I can appreciate if I just need a quick bite to eat."
Robert H.,"Newark, NJ",19,19,5,2.0,3/15/2016,"It's dead in here, but it took 10 minutes of our waitress standing there, waiting for bar staff to pour a beer. Horrible service, I understand why it's empty in here."
Tim F.,"Ramsey, NJ",0,2,,2.0,9/21/2016,We're having dinner right now and I'm having the fish and chips. My son is having the chicken tender macaroni and cheese dinner. His meal has the 3 smallest pieces of chicken tenders I have ever seen for $14.95. mine is ok at best. The service is good.
Jason K.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",104,10,70,3.0,1/3/2016,"Good Service , Clean environment but the Food is below average compare to other Applebee's! Not coming back no more !"
George C.,"East Orange, NJ",111,64,3,1.0,4/6/2015,"Went here on Friday night and you would have thought they were screening the new Fast and Furious movie by the amount of preteens at this place. I was expecting to see Chris Hansen pop up and bust a potential child predator. I'm a creature of habit so I order the same thing every time I go there (American Standard Burger). It's not too bad but I don't understand why they don't have Angry Orchard on tap like other Applebee's locations. It's close to my job and convenient for the late night hunger craving.  Pros:  - Food is okay when you're hungry, it's late, and you have nowhere else to go. - Location and Parking. Cons:  - They seem to give less fries than they use to give before. Another Visit:  Went there today 5/2/15 and ordered a Triple Bacon Burger w/ Sweet Potatoe Fries to go. I get to work and opened the bag to see they put my fries in this little bag (similar to what Starbucks uses for pastries). There must have been like 13 fries in the bag. I guess if I was a Hobbit or a triple bypass surgery patient this would be enough but 13 fries really? Yes, I counted them as I ate them. There were small tiny pieces in the bottom which were the burned ones I guess. I remember when they used to give you a sizable portion of fries. Gone are those days."
Ronnie S.,"Paramus, NJ",0,2,,5.0,12/9/2016,"Applebee's is a wonderful place to eat!  Fine food, and great people. They aim to please. Try it!"
Robert A.,"Rochelle Park, NJ",19,114,5,3.0,8/29/2016,Not a big fan of the place but stopped in for lunch with some friends and they actually delivered some good tasting food.  Previous visits were not so good so I avoided this place for several years.  I don't know if they improved the food or I was just luckey.  I will have to try algain and see if it is still ok.
Jeanna G.,"Paramus, NJ",438,627,2800,4.0,1/20/2014,"God I can't even remember the last time I've been here. When I was a mall rat I would walk here with all my other mall rat friends to make it for the half off appitizers at 10pm. I think it is safe to say I may as well been on the payroll I was there so much. Mind you this was when I was about 11-16 years old, after we stuffed our faces we'd wait for our parents to come pick us up and drive all of us home.  It was my friends suggestion to come here and I was very happy he made us come here. We were a little annoyed with how our waiter had an attitude but watever we didnt let his negativity rouin our experience. We started off by ordering our drinks and looking over the menu for our appitizers. We chose to order the spinach artichoke dip which is one of my favorites mmm along with the potatoe twisters that come with a cheese dipping sauce. We also ordered the build your own samplers with the pretzels and beer cheese dip, bonless buffalo wings and the tower things that sucked womp womp.  All of our food came out promptly for the appitizers at least. We ordered our meals I got the 9oz sirloin with mashed potatoes and a side salad it was very good. Two of my other friends got the 4 cheese mac and cheese with chicken fingers atop it. My other friend ordered a french onion soup it looked delicious.  I honestly cant wait to go back and eat some more food especially the tripple chocolate meltdown !"
Paul M.,"Tampa, FL",0,14,,3.0,9/4/2014,Try the Cali Grill Chicken disk under 550 calories for dinner.  It was amazing since I was counting calories on this trip.   Lunch time bar staff was not as friendly as the dinner. Luckily for me I knew the cooks would accommodate my request to have items removed from meal. Menu definitely should be cleaned more often. Dropped from 5 to 3 due to lunchtime experience.
Michael L.,"Waldwick, NJ",48,358,136,2.0,8/9/2012,"Egad, how can you mess up beer?!? My number one gripe here is that something is wrong with their taps.  I've had skunky beer,  water down beer, warm beer, flat beer, and yes, frozen beer.  (Frozen flakes floating on top of the beer.)  I order Stella, Sam Adams Boston Lager, Sam Adams Seasonal Beers, Blue Moon, Bud, etc, and I get messed up more than I got it right.  Fix the problem already! Everything else is Applebee's food.  If you expect anything else, then you're off your rocker. The service is okay, no one going the extra mile, and the occasional wrong order showing up at the table.  It's a good place to get hired if you're looking for a job to hold you over this economy.  The place already developed a reputation for mistakes, so new hires are just as competent as the veterans.  It's designed to be a teen and college hangout.  You can see with the decor of the local high school memorabilia.  If you're looking for a bar grill for adult flare, go to Glen Rock Inn at Glen Rock, or the Village Grille at Waldwick."
Cy C.,"Ridgewood, NJ",58,24,,1.0,4/29/2015,"Waiting for alterations to be ready next door at lord and Taylor, so popped in for a ""quick"" bite. But after sitting at the bar for 5 minutes and not even getting a menu or seeing a bartender/waitress I gave up and left. Didn't expect great service, but did expect to HAVE service!"
Lynda C.,"Peoria, AZ",2,8,2,2.0,7/16/2015,"After being seated, our waitress came over quickly. Immediately ordered the pizza bread for our young son and drinks. Took 10 minutes for our beverages. I asked for a gluten free menu as I have celiac disease. After watching her, the bartender, other waiters and finally the manager search the place for another 10 minutes, I was handed a binder (obviously intended for employees) that was such a pain in the ass to read. If we were smart we would have left but I opted to read thru the binder as quickly as I could to order. They offer little to no gluten free food. I ended up with a rib appetizer that had a sauce that was GF. My hubby ordered a burger. By this point our son should have gotten his food. 30 minutes at least passed since we put in his order. Within 10 minutes our food is delivered, no meal for our son. We flagged our server down and she said it would be right out. Obviously it was over looked and was left sitting.  Without going on and on..... Everything was terrible. We sent back our the kids meal, it was inedible. My ribs were gross, hubby said the burger was okay.  The sangria both peach and apple were a disappointment and wouldn't recommend.  Bottom line, service, food, and the lack of knowledge of food allergies were unacceptable. We won't be back and I suggest you go some place else too."
Red Y.,"Manhattan, NY",2,38,4,3.0,5/31/2015,"Was expecting the worst after reading these reviews, but was relieved since it was far from awful. We went as a party of four for late night appetizers and were seated immediately. Two rounds of beers and four appetizers for 60 bucks! It's not the best food -- too salty -- but what do you expect? Juan our server was great. It got a little busier around 11pm so get there a little earlier if you want a seat."
Wai W.,"Waldwick, NJ",119,448,203,3.0,12/22/2013,"Nothing fancy or special but you can grab an OK meal quick.  Service most of the time is good to acceptable. Like the new appetizer of pretzel sticks.  If you like burgers and wings, it is a good choice and option.  I would not suggest getting any steaks as they are small and thin so you are not going to satisfy you beef hunger. The ribs are another good option if you wanted something meatier than burgers."
Vincent F.,"White Plains, NY",0,11,,2.0,9/10/2015,Food ok. They charge .79 for refill. First time ever in an Applebee's . They said it's normal.
Tom M.,"Newark, NJ",376,609,342,2.0,10/14/2013,The Service was great.  The 7oz sirloin I had was not good. The meat was tough and not good at all. Terrible quality meat.
Maxine M.,"San Francisco, CA",4,10,,1.0,7/22/2013,"I wouldn't normally bother writing a review of a chain restaurant--you pretty much know what you're gonna get when you walk in--but I had an especially interesting experience here.  I came here with my boyfriend when we were visiting his family in New Jersey.  We saw the Onion headline (""New Ad Urges Hipsters To Go To Applebee's Ironically"") about Applebee's and started reminiscing about going to Applebee's in our high school days, when we visited much less ironically.  So we get here and get seated quickly.  Waitress seems nice, if a little slow.  I start browsing the ridiculous drink menu and order some cocktail that has a name like a city in the Spongebob universe. Nuclear Baja Azul Ginsplosiontini or something absurd. My boyfriend orders a beer.   This is when things get weird. The waitress takes our IDs, studies them for a good minute or so.  Not really sure why we had to help her find the dates of birth, that's the most prominent thing on the ID.  I'm from California and my boyfriend is from Washington state, neither of which are podunk states.  I imagine she's at least seen a California ID before.   So she goes off to get our drinks.  A few minutes later she returns and asks to see them again.  This is a little odd, I don't like giving anyone my ID and letting them run off with it, but whatever.  Also I'm 26 and my boyfriend is 29, so we're not exactly the spitting image of youth. Then five minutes later the manager, who looks younger than either of us, comes over and tells us he can't take them.  ""Why?"" I ask, as I'm sure you would have. He goes on to explain that some element of my ID was slightly wrong or off and my boyfriend's ID had some tiny discrepancy between how his book said it should look. ""They're real IDs,"" I say, as I'm sure you would have at this point.  ""Did you put them under the blacklight?"" ""Yes,"" he says, which was likely a lie.  ""Okay,"" I say, and then we argued for a minute about it.  We were only 15 miles from the most cosmopolitan city in the world, it seemed unusual that a Paraman would be incapable of recognizing an ID from CALIFORNIA, the largest state in our country population-wise.  At this point I didn't even want nor care about my Thermonuclear Gin-tanamo Torturetini™ anymore.  It was all about preserving pride. Anyway, he went on to insinuate that we were attempting to scam them, and said they'd call the police and have them confiscate our IDs.  As funny as it would have been to see the mental midget of a manager get his comeuppance, we didn't have the patience for that, so we bounced.  As an added pleasantry, the manager shouted ""good luck using your fake ID elsewhere!"" as we walked out. I'd be so curious to actually talk to the manager here and hear what the hell they were smoking.  While an apology might be nice, I'd settle for an explanation."
Adam J.,"Paramus, NJ",0,6,,1.0,3/4/2016,"Place has really declined. Went and ordered a 2 for $20 meal and an additional burger during happy hour sitting bye the bar. We got a $4.50 Long Island Iced tea, a house Merlot, and a Mountain Dew. Well the Long Island was absolutely disgusting, hardly a drop of alcohol, the Merlot was a given to us as a Chardonnay. That's just the beginning. When we asked the waitress for a Merlot, as we originally ordered, she got a nasty look on her face. We then ordered dinner, the 2 for $20. One being a small sirloin steak (Med Rare) which clearly says its $2 extra on the menu with loaded mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. Well the small amount of cheese and bacon was also $2 extra and not mentioned bye the waitress or menu. The steak was completely raw. I sent it back while the waitress scooped the steak off my plate with the sides still on it leaving it for me while I waited a good 10 minutes to the manager bringing me a new plate with fresh sides on it. He asked me if I would like to cut into it while he was there, and I did, and it was even more rare then the first one. I mean who can't cook a medium rare steak, I do it every week and I'm not a chef or cook? I said I'm done I'll just take a burger to take home medium cooked. Well, when I went to eat it later it was also raw. I'd never order anything but an appetizer or sandwich at this location. Absolutely horrible service, drinks,cooks, and entrees!!!"
Carla L.,"New York, NY",120,240,22,1.0,1/15/2013,"The food here is disgusting. Considering that it's Applebee's and the majority of the food on the menu arrives in the kitchen pre-packaged, pre-cooked, pre-seasoned, etc., you have to be a really bad cook to screw things up. Yet they do.  Tonight, I ordered my favorite thing on the Applebee's menu - the chicken wonton tacos appetizer - and there were large chunks of burnt grizzle in the chicken, the cilantro and cabbage topping which should be on and in the tacos, was haphazardly tossed around the food. It's also supposed to come with fresh limes, but they gave me lemons. Major difference when it comes to Mexican, or pseudo-Mexican food. It was the kind of food experience where you question the cleanliness and safety of the food that you're eating which is never a good thing... I've eaten here a few other times before this and the food is always sub-par compared to other Applebee's. Tonight was most likely my last time coming here. Avoid it if you can."
Rob E.,"Paramus, NJ",9,16,20,5.0,9/17/2014,"My wife, daughter, and I use Applebees to meet and catch up with my parents. My daughter loves it there. The food is great, the service is incredible no matter who serves you. They are terrific with kids and the manager always stops at the table to say hi. We know we will have a great experience when we go to the Paramus Fashion Center location ( we have not had good luck at the Hackensack location, poor customer service, no personalities, no management presence). Always a great experience at the Fashion Center location in Paramus."
Joseph F.,"East Hanover, NJ",23,32,12,4.0,11/8/2014,"Sometimes you have to wait, but that's with any restaurant. Pretty speedy service. It's your typical grab-n-go family restaurant. Good boneless wings. Never had a problem here. They used to do a half price appetizer time; not sure if they still do it, but I think it's a chain-wide thing."
Dexter M.,"Hackensack, NJ",14,78,14,1.0,4/14/2012,"This Applebees is an absolute waste of money for overpriced food and crap portions.  Kimberly, the bartender, is a B***H! Aside from her, the wait staff is usually garbage. They'll take your order, bring you your food, and then disappear. You literally need to hunt them down. This has happened with multiple servers. If you're over 21 and enjoy an older crowd, AVOID this place. Any night of the week, it's filled with high school and college kids."
