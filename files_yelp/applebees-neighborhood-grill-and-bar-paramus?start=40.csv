Lisa S.,"Oakland, NJ",25,108,21,5.0,7/26/2014,We were seated very quickly. Our waitress was extremely attentive and answered all of our questions. The food was great and very reasonably priced. Will def return.
Anthony L.,"Paramus, NJ",4,168,,1.0,10/13/2015,"I would give this place 0 stars if it would let me, considering I found not a single loose hair in my food, but what looked like someone's eyelash trimmings in my order of chicken fingers. After that I refused to go back, unless it was for drinks only -- and even that worried me! The food is sub-par and the liquor/beer selection is awful."
Suzanne G.,"Westwood, NJ",1,29,,4.0,8/1/2015,We have always had a great time here.  Servers are always positive and well trained.  Management should be commended for excellent training.
Jeff W.,"Hillsdale, NJ",92,434,33,4.0,9/24/2011,"I usually sneak in with the lunch crowd on a day off to relax and wet the whistle! So while I can't speak for the evening service, I can talk about the day's! Very friendly greetings as you walk in, doesn't seem fake like other places. Sure it is their job, but still...credit where it's due! Bartender seems to be on top of things but the other day I ran into one that was always putting a napkin under my drink....it was a little weird.  I usually order a sandwich, my friend usually gets the boneless wings. Wings are always fantastic here! Again, it's a chain, I know! I had the chicken and bacon sandwich which was a first for me and it was spot on...except for one thing. When you say smothered in bacon...2 pieces is not adequate....besides, who doesn't like bacon? Aside from that....I shall return!"
H H.,"Parsippany, NJ",9,236,30,4.0,2/6/2014,"Friendly and prompt service. Ordered the quesadilla, boneless wings, wonton tacos, and sliders. Quesadillas and wings were great. Tacos were a weird flavor. Sliders were bland. Water tasted funyy. Definitely needed a lemon. All in all, fun night. O yeah...half apps."
Logan M.,"Glen Rock, NJ",328,139,31,2.0,4/4/2013,"It's Applebee's, you can't expect greatness obviously, however the half priced appetizers have me coming back every now and then. I wouldn't recommend eating dinner here but for a quick social event at night, it does the job."
Joseph Y.,"Glen Rock, NJ",16,28,22,1.0,12/31/2012,"Gone way down hill. Food is terrible, prices absurd for quality of good. Service is like handing a kindergardener a tray and asking them to serve people. If this is ""eating good in the neighborhood"" I'm moving!"
Gwen M.,"Waldwick, NJ",34,5,1,1.0,7/11/2013,"This used to be a family favorite but recently the service and food  have changed that.  The food is eh, either over or under cooked.  Serving sizes on the same meal vary and the staff is borderline rude that is when you can even get someone to help you.  I am not a food snob but I should not have to wait 30 minutes for a drink order to be taken or clear my own appetizer dishes off my table as they serve the entrees."
Susan P.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,14,,1.0,11/22/2012,"I am only doing a review for this Applebees. (I like the other ones). You CANNOT get a bottle of wine in this place!! Absolutely ridiculous. You ask them what they have in a bottle. When you order it, they tell you they don't carry it anymore. Then you ask them again what they do have. They come back and tell you they ""just ran out."" It's pointless. If you want wine, you have to order it by the glass, and then you're lucky if it's fresh. Yucch. Don't even get me started on the lack of service. I spoke to the regional manager, who was very nice and assured me that he would address this issue. I don't really think the store manager listened. I went back again and the same exact scenario played out. Never again!"
Mark W.,"Waldwick, NJ",1,10,1,2.0,1/20/2014,"Half Apps are a great deal, the food is horrible. Unfortunately I get dragged there a lot with friends and their food is horrible but the value of Half Apps is not. Staff is usually friendly and the place is always crowded. All I can give is 2 stars!"
Capricornia M.,"Hackensack, NJ",8,8,,1.0,8/18/2014,Kim the bartender is Extremely rude. This is my second or third time here and having her as the bartender.  This will be my last time at this location. She is very rude
Jessi T.,"Maywood, NJ",286,351,201,1.0,3/8/2007,"What can I say, it is what it is. Half priced appetizers are the ONLY reason to come here.  I repeat, THE ONLY REASON.  TGI Friday's should follow suit."
Amy N.,"Paramus, NJ",53,11,,4.0,4/8/2013,I have been coming to this Applebee's for quite some time. Staff is always friendly and good is generally good. My new favorite combo is the pretzel appetizer (especially after 10pm when it's half price) and the sangria. :-)
Kate L.,"Hillsdale, NJ",48,214,,2.0,10/22/2009,"While I've never had a terrible experience here, I've never had a great one either.  I met my cousin for dinner and drinks tonight at her request and the place was packed.  We scooted into two bar stools and parked ourselves for an hour.... An hour. That was it. While fussing like teenage girls over the announcement of her engagement, the bartender barked at us ""What do you want for drinks!?!""  We paused, looked at each other and ordered. Then went back to fussing.  Not much later, ""Are you ready to order!?!?"" We had barely looked at the menus and asked her to come back.  ""Are you ready now!?!?""  And so the scene continued every 5-10 minutes for the next hour when we were hurried out the door at 8pm as the restaurant was beginning to empty. Had we been taking up a table or just sitting at the bar not eating/drinking, I could understand the bartender wanting to move us along. But we ordered drinks, apps, dinner and dessert in under an hour.  If she kept refilling us/spaced it out better, we would have been there much longer."
Jessica K.,"Hillsdale, NJ",21,349,53,3.0,2/22/2010,"The appetizers & bar are the best reasons to go to any Applebee's, but especially this one. In my experience, going on Sunday afternoons, the bartenders are usually friendly, quick to attend, and ensure ordered food comes out on time. If you chose to (and are able to) sit at the bar like I did, it really maximizes the relaxed, casual vibe I think the establishment is going for.  Of course, most of the main entrees are covered in sauces and unnecessary extras. If you can go without something, I suggest making that request when you order your main dish.  Again, anything fried is superb here. I can't get enough of their mozzarella sticks (10 individual sticks in one order!) and buffalo wings. I never fail to wash'em down with a pint of beer."
Linda M.,"Nanuet, NY",8,46,21,1.0,8/5/2010,"What an absolute nightmare.  I have never had such a bad experience at a chain restaurant.  This was the first time I was at this place, and I'm sure it will be my last.   We went on a Thursday night.  The place was busy but not packed.  We were seated immediately.  The waitress took our order.  And about 10 minutes later, she came with our drinks.  We were a party of 2... so 2 sodas....BUT only 1 straw.  So I waited, and waited.  Finally she came back and I asked for a straw.  Apparently she had dropped it on the floor.  So she took another out of her apron and handed it to me.  Then, she pick up the one off the floor and put it back in her apron.  YUCK!  20 minutes later, our appetizer came out.... but no plates.  So we just ate.  Then our entrees came out... but no utensils.  I was getting kind of frustrated.  So I asked the waitress for utensils.  It took her 15 minutes to get back to us, but on the way, she left utensils at the wrong table.  So we waited again.  It took her an additional 10 minutes to finally bring our utensils.  By this time, our food was cold.  Drinks were empty.  I asked for a container to take my food home.  What else is new, it took the waitress an additional 10 minutes to fetch a container... yet our check was brought to us immediately. I really recommend you go elsewhere unless you have 3 hours to waste and love cold food.  This place is horrible."
Essa B.,"Paramus, NJ",0,20,,4.0,5/15/2012,"This location did a crazy, amazing turnaround.  The service is so much quicker and the staff is constantly coming around seeing if you need anything else.  I really only go in after 10PM on weekdays, but food is good, service is good and the price is good!"
David Q.,"Paramus, NJ",1,9,3,1.0,9/7/2009,The service is slow! Food delivery and finding our waiter.  Looks like the place is ready to go out of business!  I Will never go back
TaketotheRiv R.,"Paramus, NJ",9,20,,3.0,8/19/2012,"its applebees. plain and simple. so if you wanna get a burger and stare at hot girls, then go here. im pretty sure they'll only hire young blondes with fake body parts and extra tight pants....i cant really say i have any complaints. havent had any problems in a while. half priced apps is whats up!"
Roberto M.,"Anaheim, CA",8,29,,1.0,1/8/2008,Everytime I go to this location I always have to wait extra long for something. If it's not the waiter then its the food. The last time I went the person that brought out our food pretty much threw our food on the table. Gotta love the service.
