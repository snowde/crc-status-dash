mike j.,"Bergen County, NJ",0,9,,3.0,10/21/2009,"Hadnt been here for a very long time so was kinda curious how their football setup was for sunday. Boy was I pleasantly surprised when I walked in and realized they had added 7 brand new flat screen HDTVs along with Sunday ticket. The wings were good the beer was cold and the deals were great.(20 wings for 5 bucks, 2 dollar pints)"
