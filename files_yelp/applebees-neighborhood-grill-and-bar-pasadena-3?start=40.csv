Heather H.,"Pasadena, TX",25,29,,3.0,4/28/2013,"My boyfriend and I went had had dinner after I got off of work, around 9 pm. So a plus that they stay open till 2 am so we didn't have to rush. The hostesses seated us and  everything has good but it took about 5-7 min to ask for our drink order. And even longer to take our food order and there wasn't many customer like 2 or 3 tables"
Chris F.,"Pearland, TX",0,3,,2.0,8/31/2014,"The ribs were good, but the service was slacking. The table next to us had to wait 15 minutes to get service."

Laura P.,"Houston, TX",0,13,,3.0,2/8/2012,"You know I really want to like this place, but just didnt enjoy my visit. We went in at lunch on 1-24  and service was slow, atleast i wasnt in a hurry. The salad i got was almost warmnot chilled, like it was under a heat lamp for a minute or two. The  waiter seemed overworked abd didnt keep my glass filled. Might be a while before i go back."
Nayelly G.,"Pasadena, TX",0,3,,3.0,3/17/2013,Good atmospheres but bad service the last time I went.. Girls don't have good service there...Entrees came before appetizer.. Our waitress didn't even bring out food or never came back only at the end to charge us..  Another waiter had to help us
