Jeremy R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",101,24,7,5.0,8/11/2017,"Came in real late , almost closing time. We were welcomed by Sam our waitress. She had a huge smile and an amazingly friendly personality. She never mentioned the time or made us feel rushed. Sam was spot on the food and drinks. Fast!     We also noticed the other employees where smiling and having pleasant exchanges.     This team works impressively well together!        Thank you Applebees team.    YOU MY BOY BLUE!"
Michael L.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,2,,5.0,11/30/2017,Location is closed. Looks like a leasing issue. Note on door says property has been takin over by landlord.
Spencer E.,"Cave Creek, AZ",448,2,1,1.0,2/3/2017,"I only go out to eat once a month and I decided Applebees was it.  I only gave it a star because it require me to rate it but I feel it deserves a half stare. After eating here I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.  It started with a phone call. They said there was no wait. That should have been my first clue, for a Friday night rush. When we get there 3 mins later there is actually a 15 minuet wait. You cannot tell me that in 3 mins 4-5 tables came in all of a sudden.  Then came the ordering. The waitress messed up my drinks, also had to ask for water 3 times before I got some. We ordered appetizers when we ordered drinks.   Appetizers took an hour to get and 1:3 were cold and only a partial portion 3 tacos and not 4.  At that point my table asked for a manager. The manager said it was a coaching experience for the waitress. Did not apologize and blames the computer for the issue. And rudely said (eye role heard in her voice about the partial appetizer comment) ""let me go get that last taco for you.""  When our food was arriving the waitress said the potato would take about her 5 min. The person who got the potato said ""I don't want a potato microwaved"". I agree with her statement. If you go out you should not be getting a potato microwaved.   The steak was hard as a brick and the grilled veggies were solid half slabs not sliced and they were raw in the middle.  The waitress said there would be 4 grilled veggies and the woman only got two labs of squash and 3 red pepper slices.  So the ""manager"" said ""I'll go back and get you another side"" in the most Obnoxious tone I've ever heard. I have no idea how she can be a manager. I feel like our waitress was more a manager than the actual manager even though she was slow.  As soon as she realized our irritation  she became more attentive.  In the end we got one meal taken off which is the least they could do.  I will never be back to this one. I know a better one in central phx I will be glade to drive an extra 30 mins to go to."
Michelle B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",129,7,,1.0,10/21/2017,I'll give this one star because I have to but honestly they deserve not even half a star. My boyfriend and I just sat in this restaurant for almost 25minutes and didn't even have waters yet or have an order taken. Took10 minutes for someone to even greet us and I was amazed considering how many employees were standing around (including managers) and not one was providing any help or appearing to be a team atmosphere. Especially considering there was maybe 3 tables in there and over 7 staff members standing around talking. Coming from someone in this industry I can say that I am beyond disappointed with how poor this place is ran. 90% of a restaurants reputation is the service provided and in 25minutes I can say the lack of service speaks for itself. Step it up and look into new staff.
Daniel R.,"Deer Valley Village, Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,1.0,10/27/2017,"First time here and waitress named Sam gave terrible service and was a complete bitch, talked to me like I was stupid. Worst service I've ever had."
James M.,"Phoenix, AZ",1178,188,285,2.0,3/16/2017,"2 for $20.00.  Caprese Mozzarella Chicken and artichoke dip.  Omg.  Delicious.  Mellow music, refreshing beverages and great company, makes a great casual night out.  My stomach is full and my heart is content.  Food was slow to come and refills on drinks had to be asked for.  Bummer."
Tracy S.,"Glendale, AZ",6,1,,1.0,9/16/2017,"The food was cold , I asked for lemonade and they gave me sprite, and I asked for a spoon and they never gave it to me."
Kim P.,"Phoenix, AZ",41,26,,1.0,10/28/2017,"We went here last night for dinner, and I have to say our waitress was horrific! She did not check on us once, had a very nasty personality and was very rude and snippy to our entire group of 5 and a infant. As we watched all the other servers make rounds and smile and be kind, our waitress had a stone face and her personality sucked! in fact, she did not even tell us her name. I personally had a burger, and  the bun was very burnt and hard. my daughter did not like her meal at all, it was tasteless and bland. We waited 20 minutes to ask about our bill and a box for take home for the dogs. Today, I wake up throwing up with severe stomach pain. Horrible food and service."
Mary H.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,18,3,1.0,7/24/2017,So I came here for dinner tonight and I just wanna say the service here is beyond ridiculous.  We got here at 9pm and the place was dead. Ordered our drinks right away and didn't get them until 930pm ONLY because I had to wave down our waitress (who spent most of the night talking to the bartender). She apologized and said she forgot. Yeah because she was so busy in a deserted restaurant.  Are you kidding me? Our food came out and looked like it had been sitting out for awhile. The manager looked like a moron just walking around with his thumb in his ass. All in all the place needs to get it together and get formal training in customer service. So disappointed. I'll never return to this location EVER. Stay away from this location.
Chris B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,8,,1.0,11/18/2017,Went there and was seated immediately. Waited 15 mins for the waitress to come just to take out drink order. The place was empty. Maybe 8 customers between two waitress. Food came out and part of it was cold. Would not go to this place again.
Jeff B.,"Phoenix, AZ",39,328,174,2.0,9/3/2015,"First time at this Applebee's and most likely, my last. I arrived at 11:45 on a Thursday for lunch and there were about 8 other guests.  I was greeted/seated right away and Jenn took care of me with all the proper etiquette. The food was the disappointment.  I ordered the Lunch Combo Signature Special: Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad plus French Onion Soup. It arrived in about five minutes. Hmm, a little too fast? The soup was decent: it had all the right components such as good broth, onions, big crouton and cheese. Thankfully it wasn't too salty like many places. The salad was awful. It arrived with a stale, tasteless breadstick and the dressing was so scant I actually thought the cook forgot it and had to look under the first layer of lettuce. The chicken was boring and all around, would never recommend the salad."
Jasmine J.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,5,13,5.0,8/16/2017,Greeted as soon as we walked in the door and asked seating preference. Strawberry margarita was great. Way better than the camelback and central location!
Jamie F.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,4,3,1.0,6/11/2017,"Unbelievable service and drinks, I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. Even the manager was NOT helpful"
Daniel S.,"San Diego, CA",0,24,1,2.0,10/20/2016,"Third and last time I come here.  Walked in and was greeted immediately which is a first for here and I thought a good sign.  No, I was being escorted by the host and mentioned I was going to sit by the bar. Once he heard that he'd walked away without saying a word. Very rude, he could have said something simple like thank you and sit where you want. Every time I come here there is a funky smell in the building. I thought it was coming from the bar but last (2nd time I was here) I sat away and it smells throughout the building. I ordered the steak with parmigiana shrimp, it was tasty but very poorly presented. It looked nowhere like the picture in the menu let alone the garlic mashed potatoes were from a box.  Overall disappointing on many levels. Poor customer service, funky smell and ok food. Definitely avoid this place there are many other options locally that have better reviews."
Ana P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,5.0,8/5/2017,The manager Ben greeted us when we walked in and at the end of our dinner he came to our table and introduced himself. Very nice guy and gave us coupons for our next visit. Good customer service
Yi T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",14,93,66,4.0,10/21/2016,"I had a one time experienced hat was not good but spoke to the Manager Chris  , he is very professional,and I will come back to visit again!"
Krystal G.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,10,1,1.0,9/9/2016,"Probably the WORST restaurant experience my entire family has ever had. We waited for over 30min just for our appetizer, then 30mins later they brought out 1 plate of food to a table of 4. And the food was BURNT! So burnt they shouldn't have even brought it out. So we send it back to the kitchen. We wait ANOTHER 15min, finally decide to get up and head to the TGI's around the corner from this place. They offered to cover the appetizers and apologized but there was no excuse for such crappy service when the place was more than half empty. Will NEVER Come back! Save your time & money people, go some where else!"
Jaci U.,"Phoenix, AZ",37,25,2,1.0,2/7/2017,"Order a drink... you will need it to choke down the terrible food. From horrible tasting food to poor service, you'll get it here. We were not given menus when sat, our kids plates were so hot that I got burned, and very long wait times for a very small portion. Our waitress was nice but not attentive. I do not recommend this location."
Corey L.,"Pine Bush, NY",58,66,75,2.0,8/30/2016,"This was the first and last time I go to Applebee's. We wanted to go out for a decent dinner and figured a chain like Applebee's would be good. As we first walked into this place the smell was not so good. I could not recall the smell but it was not that of a restaurant.  We get our seat and look at the menu.  The waitress takes our order, and then goes on to explain we chose great meals. She wishes she could afford what we ordered. She also gave us a sense that she did not like her job. So I assume the pay at Applebee's is subpar, or her productivity is of the same level. As she walked away she looked to the hostess and said I need to smoke lets go. I'm sure the management does not have a clue of how bad you truly are.  I ordered a medium steak, to my surprise I get a rare steak. My wife orders a medium well steak and gets a medium. This lets me know the chef has no idea what he is doing in the back and the training program is below par. I would have sent it back but this place looked to like one of them that you would get more than you asked for.  As we go to pay, which now is a machine because the waitresses are so busy talking crap about everyone to take my payment. Anyway, they tried to charge me double on my drinks. The waitress went back to the manager 3 times before they finally took my credit card and manually ran it with the proper bill.  I am completely unimpressed with this Applebee's. I also assume that this chain has fallen off the caring list. There is a lot of work that needs to be done. If you are looking for a nice dinner and good atmosphere please look elsewhere."
Olivia R.,"Peoria, AZ",21,5,,1.0,3/15/2017,"I have visited this location on multiple occasions and every time the experience has been horrible. Last night was the final straw, this place is definitely in need of new management and a visit from corporate. Yesterday the place was an igloo absolutely freezing. The crew members were supervising the store with no manager in sight. The food took 50 minutes to be served to us, and came out ice cold. Overall, avoid this place at all cost."
Nancy F.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,11,2,5.0,5/6/2017,"Great atmosphere, great service, got a lot of attention. The drink was good and service was fast. Can't find anything else other than I will come back in the future."
Rubbie S.,"Manor, TX",59,516,2074,1.0,11/1/2015,"Ok where do I start...  The table Looks clean but when you put your hands on it . It'sticky...Eww!! We were seated right away. Offered different places to sit. Not many people in restaurant. It was about 1145 am on Sunday morning. We placed our orders  person #1 French onion soup  & Ice Tea person #2 Bacon Cheese burger  ( No onions ) with Fries and Ice Tea Person #3  The Brunch Burger ( No Onions & No ketchup ) fries  & Pepsi Person #4 Burger  ( No Cheese ) fries and Ice Tea 20-30 minutes go bye. We watch people walk in after after us and be serve their food before us and we're still waited for our food.  When we were finally served we were not served all together. Person #1 had to wait for no reason Person #3 Fries were luke warm and egg shells in burger Person #4 Burger had cheese  ( Even though they specifically asked for no cheese) fries luke warm. Person #2 Burger was missing they were only given fries 7 minutes later the burger was brought out with NO Bacon. The waitress accepted responsibility in the delay in our food.  How ever between missing the  bacon on the bacon cheese burger. The waitress said she was going to send the manager over so we could speak with him.  The manager Never came over and spoke with us.... so much for Customer Service. The waitress (christine) is not sole blame for bad service or food. I felt  ignored and purposely over looked by the manager Chris. Who had no problem stopping at other tables but ignoring ours.  Instead the waitress gave us the bill for the food. Thankfully  minus the charge for person #2 burger.  How ever I still feel slighted or over looked because the manager never made an attempt to check on us or speak to us. The waitress apologized numerous times but her apologies didn't make the food come out any quicker, or stop the missing items. By the time she was attentive to our drink refills we were already upset and they took the path of ignoring us instead of facing the problem face on. I don't write negative reviews on a regular basis so this is probably the worst one I've ever written. I will never visit this restaurant ever again I do not recommend it to anybody else.  Unless your in to being ignored, over looked or food being served to you not the way you order it! So rather then throw a fit or demand to be seen and heard I brought my words and opinions here. I am not the type of person to not leave a tip. for $39.00 bill I left a $5.00 tip (Begrudgingly) But followed through by sharing my experience here on Yelp and Facebook."
Tobi B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,13,,5.0,11/27/2016,My husband and I went in last night for half price appetizers. The food was good but what stood out most was the outstanding service we received. Lessa and Spencer were both serving us and they went out of their way to make our dining experience fantastic. I haven't received that level of excellent service at fine dining restaurants! We were both blown away. Thanks for a great and very affordable date night!
Aj F.,"Orem, UT",0,4,,5.0,11/27/2016,"Applebee's is Applebee's right? I don't think that it happens often enough that the people doing well in their service roles get the credit they deserve. We love going to this location because of two employees in particular. Lessa and Spencer ALWAYS go above and beyond what would be expected of a server. They seem to have an innate sense of exactly how often to check in on a table. It never seems forced or over the top. They are always genuine and proactive about making sure everything is perfect. Doesn't matter what time it is or how many tables they are handling. As long as these two are here, we'll be coming back often."
Nick S.,"Kayenta, AZ",0,1,,4.0,7/10/2017,"I went there with my daughter for lunch. Everyone was nice although our waitress was a little inconsistent in servicing our table. We took a little while to order which may have affected how we were serviced. The food was good and prepared nicely but I did not at first get what I ordered. I ordered a shrimp stir fry dish but it came with steak. Our waitress apologized for the mistake and the manager also came over to the table and apologized. I received a small bowl of grilled shrimp so I had steak and shrimp; but, I only ate the shrimp. My daughter said her food was prepared well and tasted good."
Stacy F.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,21,,5.0,4/5/2016,"I absolutely love this place. This is my late night go to place (addiction). We are always greeted when we first get there. The bartender Michael sometimes has our beverages at the bar before we finish sitting down. Everyone is friendly and the service is quick. I am addicted to the wonton tacos, but I have tried many of their new dishes and they are all so good."
Henry S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",67,46,51,5.0,4/27/2016,I came to Applebee's just to relax before going to play a game of pool.  The bartender Micheal was very helpful in tell me the local pool halls.  The atmosphere was very nonchalant and casual.  It is certainly a family resturant this time of day but enjoyable.  This Applebee's is a little smaller than I expected but they make up for it in service.
Katt T.,"Murrieta, CA",1,25,2,5.0,9/4/2016,After our sucky experience at Mellow Mushroom the staff here made it amazing!  Got our drinks immediately and ordered our food. Since they are closing they blasted awesome music. Ending this night perfectly! Thanks Applebee's
Miss C.,"Phoenix, AZ",21,138,189,2.0,4/8/2015,"You get what you get and you don't throw a fit.... But you seriously, why are all Applebee's soooooooo bad? You used to at least be able to count on them for a cheap happy hour booze & food wise. Not so much any more, there are barely any choices & it's mostly stuff people don't want to drink. Service was impeccably slow, 45 minutes to get our entrees. Margarita tasted like the kind that comes in those Capri Sun like pouches.  Everything tastes as unfresh as it is. The only saving grace was the French fries were fresh, even if only one sad, lone fry came seasoned. On the upside they have great S&P shakers to fix that."
Gerry. Boehr B.,"Glendale, AZ",0,3,,1.0,5/3/2017,I haven't eaten at an Applebee's in years and I will never go back to this one again. The mixed drinks were awful and the wine I ordered was fine but when you went to drink it the wine glass smelled musty. The food was mediocre and the service was horrible. I'm surprised this place is still in business.
James T.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,24,4,1.0,5/21/2016,This is what $20 gets you.  2 pieces of broccoli and tiny steak. At least the potatoes are decent portion. Oh and all the staff out at the dumpsters are smoking pot.....
Leslie M.,"Phoenix, AZ",113,176,574,4.0,9/22/2015,Stopped in on a weekday afternoon. We were seated promptly. I ordered the Thai Shrimp Salad with the dressing on the side. Food was ready quickly. Everything was very fresh. I really enjoyed the salad. Will order it again when we go there. It was delicious!
Angel A.,"Glendale, AZ",6,81,14,1.0,7/17/2016,This place is awful! I waited and waited for water and lemon.... If the wait for water was an indication of the wait I would be having for any food I'm not waiting! Sorry this location just lost our business for life!! Sorry not sorry! Not sure the servers name however you suck dude it was only water! There are much better places to give my money to around here!!!
Christopher U.,"Phoenix, AZ",9,13,1,5.0,7/24/2016,"Me and my family came here for lunch.  Have not been to this location before.  We all had the Philly cheese steak with the beer cheese.  Very delicious.  Our waiter Spencer,  was outstanding.  Very friendly and helpful.  He is part of a dying breed of waiters that actually care about the customer.  I would definitely come back again!!"
Brad W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",203,1514,1940,4.0,6/14/2015,"This chain has about five menu's as well, but I was here for lunch, so you just simply head to the back side of the menu and start picking your combo. Your lunch will either be $7-$9 depending on what combination of items you pick. I think I nailed it with my selection of the chicken cheese penne bake and the chipotle chicken wrap. They are lunch portion sized, but it filled me up quite nicely. The pasta had nice strips of white chicken grilled on top and wasn't overly cheesy while the wrap had enough flavor on its own, but was helped by an orange dipping sauce (chipotle). You can get out of here under $10 for lunch, but the quality all depends on what you pick. Applebee roulette, sometimes it works, many times it doesn't."
Thomas S.,"Phoenix, AZ",21,85,7,4.0,11/5/2015,"So this was a tough review to write. About 10 years ago, I got a very bad case of food poisoning from an Applebee's. I was violently ill for about 48 hrs.  Needless to say, every time I heard the name, I would think of the Asian chicken salad I had ordered, and how something didn't seem right with it.  Then, I think of the pain I was in, and the violent vomiting and bowel movements I had for 2 days. Again, it goes without saying, that I avoided Applebees for a very long time. My ex finally convinced me to try it again, as their menu had changed a lot, and had some new items on it. So I gave it a try. WOW.  I ordered the all day brunch burger.  Did I say wow?  That burger was the most flavorful, juiciest burer I have had in a long long time.  The hashbrowns on it, with the fried egg....YUM!  It comes with ketchup...but no one in their right mind puts ketchup on a burger.  Gross. I had them put their special signature grill sauce on it.   Perfect. Even the French fries were really long, hot and crisy. Ill be back for that burger."
R G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,32,,1.0,12/8/2016,Wow what a terrible meal at Applebee's. Most Applebee's locations have always been consistently good. I and my friend both ordered their new southwestern salad. Big mistake. The presentation of the salad on the plate was the worst I have ever seen.  simple iceberg lettuce with some slight additions and the lettuce was wet and no dressing.  I would've told them to take that back to the kitchen but didn't want to embarrass my friend who's plate looked just like mine.  The chef must have been hallucinating by putting that out.  Really bad !
Rebecca M.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,10,,5.0,6/24/2016,"We are always greeted by Julia with such genuine care and smile, when she is working. The food is prepared the way you like.  I would recommend this restaurant."
John G.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,1.0,12/20/2016,Horrible experience. This Applebees doesnt know how to cook a steak. Sent it back twice. Manager did nothing.
Margi L.,"Bow, NH",0,3,,5.0,6/23/2016,We had a terrific meal and the staff was very attentive and available! Great place to grab a bite!
