Nicole W.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,1.0,12/30/2016,Worst service I've ever received! I've worked in a restaurant for three years if this kind of thing happened they would've been written up or fired! Took server forever to get drink orders and just as long to get drinks. Appetizer came out cold. And server had food in their mouth while making sure they were warm enough. Food took way longer than should have to come out. Waited for server to pay she was no where to be found. Had to ask a server that was sitting up front on their phone where the host should have been to get our server still didn't come for a while and when they did they smelt of cigarettes and said they thought they showed us to pay on the device left on the table. When leaving host was coming inside from vehicle. Very disappointed used to be a favorite restaurant hadn't been in years won't be coming back.
Sandra C.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,3,1,5.0,5/18/2015,"Ask to see Michael's smiley face tattoo  He may be quiet but you can get him talking! Best time I've had at a bar in Applebee's. He even talked about football, basketball, and taught me a thing or two! Thanks Michael!"
R.N. K.,"Glendale, AZ",0,18,2,5.0,8/18/2016,"We love this location. They have great staff and yummy food. Very helpful when we called in our order. We arrived before the order was ready, so we went in and sat at the bar. The bartender was friendly and attentive. When they brought out the order, they told us that our cheesecake was on the bottom of the bag so it didn't get heated up by the other food. What attention to detail!"
Amber L.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,1.0,2/26/2017,"Don't ever go to this applebees you will regret every moment of it. If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would. Server seemed like she was on drugs. Which whatever I don't care about that but my friends boyfriend ordered a burger and asked for guacamole and when she brought our food out she said thy ran out of it. Later did we find out they don't even have guacamole on there menu. I ordered fish and chips it was horrendous. My friend ordered the beef and potatoes the beef looked like dog food not even close to what beef should look like. Let alone when we asked for the manager just to inform her that the kitchen should put out food that is enjoyable since it is a restaurant. The manager snapped and started yelling. I've worked in a restaurant that holds over 200 people and I have never seen a manager treat a customer such as the manager we have received tonight. I am in amazement. Don't ever go to this applebees you will regret it, it every way possible."
Megan R.,"Tempe, AZ",1,44,10,5.0,5/8/2015,"Bar tenders are very nice, good food and cheep beer. Blue moon on tap, good appitizer"
Zion B.,"Phoenix, AZ",56,39,3,2.0,2/22/2016,"Really bad food. Only two stars because the server was nice. Had a featured spicy lime salad and chicken tortilla soup, and it winded up costing me 17$ before tip!"
Nicole C.,"Peoria, AZ",56,66,15,1.0,2/22/2016,Slow and inaccurate service. I don't understand how you get orders wrong when there is only a few other customers. And we have gone back 2 other times and it's nearly the same way. I wouldn't recommend this location.
Aubry S.,"Glendale, AZ",0,22,18,2.0,2/9/2016,"Went on a weeknight - hardly anyone there so we thought it'd be fast service. We were seated promptly, but then waited 5 min for the waitress to make her way to our table to see what drinks we wanted. Then 10 min go by.... We ended up walking out before she even asked us if we were ready to order."
Cassandra P.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,21,7,1.0,1/13/2016,"Um, Applebees, we know you. We know we're getting a semi okay meal and a cold drink. You're familiar with quick service. But when none of those things are right, mama ain't happy."
Kelli-Jo H.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,26,5,1.0,2/13/2016,"This location has got to be the worst I have ever been to, ever. My husband, brother and I came in on a Wednesday night at about 10:45. There were only a few other guests there, mostly sitting at the bar. We were sat quickly and the waitress took our drink orders, she came back quickly to take our meal orders. My husband got the Standard Burger, the waitress asked him ""Pink or No Pink"" to which my husband responded ""No Pink"" and even followed up with ""Well Done"". Personally, I would think that meant he wanted the burger cooked all the way through. We got our food out and my husband cuts his burger in half... Low and behold the burger is pink throughout.  We call the waitress over to the table, show her the burger and remind her that he asked for well done. She responds with, ""it's only a little pink, but I can put it back on the grill."" My husband verifies that she plans on putting a but in half burger back on the grill, with all of the sauce and cheese already on it...  She then says, ""oh, you want a new one... Okay.""  Meanwhile, my brother and I have our food and are done eating. The manager brings his new burger out to us and explains that we will not be charged for the burger, we ask for it to go and the manager has an attitude about it and walks away while my husband is APOLOGIZING to him for the extra task! (If the food was cooked the correct way in the first place this would have been a non-issue) We then get the food to go and tip the waitress (for what I am not sure) and are walking out, all the while the manager is glaring at us from the bar. Never, EVER will I come to this location again."
Robbie G.,"Orlando, FL",593,357,1300,4.0,6/29/2014,"We went here for lunch one afternoon.  I got the Cowboy burger, and my wife got her usual, the quesadilla burger. We had two servers, Leah and Madison, and both were great. The food came out hot and fresh.  It was pretty standard for an Applebee's in my experience.  The place was clean and the service was fast.  This is definitely a location I would go back to."
Jovanka G.,"Phoenix, AZ",118,23,3,2.0,7/21/2014,"Sitting at the Mellow Mushroom right across the street, just keep asking myself why didn't we do this the first time? We wanted to get something to eat like a small app and a cold beer, and we really happened to have a gift card for this place. We entered, smelt like burnt oil, bar counter top was gross and not clean at all... onion rings were okay, but the mozzarella sticks sucked. You've done it again, Crapelbees. J This is the second time I've been to this place in another state, and yet it disappoints. Service was okay."
Steve C.,"Phoenix, AZ",25,34,2,1.0,11/20/2016,"So I've eaten as this location several times over the past year and never had an issue until tonight. It appeared that our waitress was covering half of the tables by herself while the other 4 waitresses we saw shared the other half. This on top of having more than 1 table that didn't speak english, making it harder for her to take the orders, could have been alleviated with a better distribution of waitresses. It took us far to long to be served (not our waitresses fault) than it should have. Finding out that there were things on the menu that were no longer being sold was kind of a bummer but not the end of the world. We ordered an appetizer and the kitchen forgot to make it. My wife's salad looked like it had been sitting out waiting to be served since the morning and was missing a few of the normal components. My meal was fine but seemed to have been tossed together compared to usual. It seems like service and quality have gone down hill very quickly at this location and it should be addressed immediately. It's Applebees so I'm not expecting what I would at Ruth's Chris, but I always knew what I was getting and was never disappointed until tonight."
Haley S.,"Phoenix, AZ",39,2,,1.0,5/12/2016,"Usually Applebee's is one of our favorite places. We're new to the area and decided to have a date night for once. It was horrible. We had to buzz for the waitress to take our order.  There was only four other tables in the restraunt so it was not busy at all.  The waitress was nice but got our order wrong, then offered to fix it and still brought out the wrong thing. The steak was really dry and mine was not well done like i asked. I had to ask for water twice and then finally got it, but never got the a1 i asked for. Overall it was the worst date night and we don't get many of those. $40 i would have rather spent somewhere else. Im mad at myself for not getting the receipt because I'm doubting that was correct either. It's really a shame because we love Applebee's. We'll definitely not go back to this particular one anytime soon."
Amrita M.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,32,22,4.0,8/21/2015,The desserts are just awesome.  They have a deal  2 for $20 which is a great offer and various items to choose from. The ladies serving are very polite.  Ambience is very nice
Chris G.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,40,,2.0,7/28/2015,"Horrible service, and the food is never done right when we go there. The waitress we had the last time made us wait 45 mins for DRINKS. If that wasn't bad enough, she got ALL of our orders wrong in some way, gave major attitude when we told her they were wrong, and then she just...never came back to our table. I will say that the management did apologize, gave us a free dessert, comped our entire meal, AND gave us some free drink coupons, which is the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1. Plus this place stinks like burnt fries and fish."
Jade W.,"Goodyear, AZ",18,321,20,2.0,1/4/2015,"Met a friend for dinner here the week of Christmas. It wasn't very busy at all so I guess everyone was out shopping. I ordered the three-cheese chicken penne with no tomatoes. The pasta wasn't very hot when it came out. There also wasn't a lot of chicken on it, which was fine with me, but others might find it to be skimpy. It tasted alright and I ended up eating it all... should have taken some for leftovers as the sauce is heavy. The garlic bread that came with it was not very good... it wasn't warm and tasted borderline stale. They really need to serve better garlic bread. We also got the chocolate chip cookie sundae for dessert. It was pretty good. But overall, not my favorite meal."
Aaron A.,"Phoenix, AZ",225,426,61,3.0,1/4/2013,"Very clean and good location. Been here several times, usually for happy hour, and have never had a bad experience. Nothing super special but the Bees is a good solid choice for food or drinks when you don't feel like thinking about where to go.  They recently got Kilt lifter in which is a bonus! Honestly its a solid place for those trying this budget thing out.  There are many specials and the food is always decent enough.  Service is friendly, but at times can be sketchy.  But since they are rotating servers all the time, I can't hold that too much against them. Its a solid 3 star place.  But remember, its applebees, so you should know what to expect."
Jene J.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,19,22,2.0,1/16/2016,"I really don't know where to begin.. I wish I would of looked on Yelp before we stopped in. My grandparents are in town and this is one of their favorites back home so we decided to stop in tonight. We were seated fast and the waiter came taking our drink orders right away.. He came back about 2 minutes later with our drinks..we were not ready to order a yet (group of 6) so he said he would come back soon and check with us again..it took him 15 minutes to come back and take our order..lucky my kids were playing with the tablet they had on the table and lost track of time.. He came and took our order and to my surprise he didn't write down one thing anyone said .. He just kept saying ""yes sir"" ""ok"" so at that moment I was a little worried if he was going to get everyone's order in correctly. We waited another 30 minutes for an order of Spanish dip and mozzarella sticks..which he never brought us any plates for. 25 minutes later half of us received our main dish. My grandfather ordered baked potato and was given fries.. He let him keep them and went and got him a potato. He said the kids meals and my husbands chicken and shrimp were coming.. We ask for another round of drinks.. He said he would be right back.. Another women came out with my husbands meal but didn't know about the kids orders.. We waited another 20 minutes for my kids food and our drinks to come. Everybody else was almost done with their food..They had chicken tenders and fries and a cheese pizza and fries. Of course it took another 15 minutes to flag him down for our check.. 75$ check I only left a 8$ tip.. Trust me I didn't want to leave that. But I will say the food we received was good.. We all did enjoy our food...just wish we could of enjoyed it together. This experience was a real big disappointment for my family.. We just wanted a nice evening with our grandparents and it turned in to a frustrating long night. We love Applebee's and this location is close to our house but sadly we will never return to this location after tonight's experience."
Barry B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,4,,1.0,12/26/2014,Sad sorry service. If you want to drop a few pounds this is the place to eat lunch as the soup and salad lunch deal is one time only and that is so small that my girlfriend and I laughed out loud. Never even offered a tea refill after waiting 30 min for our tiny lunch. No wonder I dislike this joint.
