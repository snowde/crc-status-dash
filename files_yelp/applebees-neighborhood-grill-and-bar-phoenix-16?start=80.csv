Sarah C.,"Chandler, AZ",4,38,,3.0,10/5/2009,"It was ""ok."" We got the two for $20 deal. The artichoke dip was good, but not great. The ribs were surprisingly good. We ordered two (SMALL) apple margaritas, and I was stunned upon getting the bill to find that they were almost nine dollars each! A bit ridiculous to me. Our waitress was really not engaging, but the service was prompt."
Andrea T.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,18,,3.0,3/28/2011,"I would rate this particular applebees a 3 only because of the good service. If it was based on my food that was placed infront of me it would definatly be rated a 1. My boyfriend and I went out to eat here last Saturday night, we got a table immediatly and our server was right there to get our drink order. He was very fast and very good. However our food was horrible. We each ordered a steak (at about $15.00 a piece) - I ordered mine medium rare and my boyfriend ordered his medium. I honestly think that those steaks were on the grill for not even five full minutes. My boyfriends steak was so so so very much rarer then mine and mine was what can you say almost raw. no where near medium or medium rare. My boyfriends mashed potatoes were eehhhh flavorless i guess you could say, and as for out mixed/seasonal vegetables- well it was just a big stalk of broccolli. I didnt really even eat and we did not dare to send our steaks back although we definatly should have, however I have worked ina restaurant and I know you do not send your steak back to be recooked. Very disappointing experience. Will not go back."
