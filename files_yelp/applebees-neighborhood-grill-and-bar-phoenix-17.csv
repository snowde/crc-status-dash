Jean S.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",26,124,34,4.0,9/22/2017,"My original review was for a location in Texas.  This one is for the Phoenix one at 24th and Baseline.  It was excellent.  We chose it for the new lunch pairings.  I had tomato basil soup and 1/2 club sandwich.  It was hot, crispy and well flavored.  It is not often you can get away with a decent lunch under 15 bucks!  The server was also top notch!  I think her name was Breanna.  Thanks Breanna!  Your location is top notch."
Sara G.,"Chandler, AZ",158,7,,1.0,1/3/2018,"A family in here was visibly harrassing a server and management did nothing to protect the employee. The family was causing a scene and even told the server to meet them outside to fight, while everyone near them had to hear the altercation.  The family should have been asked to leave, but instead it looks like they got their meal comped or taken care of... which is probably what they wanted. The manager should GROW SOME and back his employees, especially when they are being threatened. The food took forever, had to ask for everything twice, came out hard and not enjoyable. 0/10 do NOT recommend.... unless you're looking for Jerry Springer type fighting at a family restaurant."
Rey C.,"Albuquerque, NM",3,26,16,2.0,10/9/2017,"Great bartender however, my food order was SW Sirloin Salad which I had numerous times and always was one of favorites go to although, the steak had to be remade because it was over-cooked , 2nd time the steak had no flavor and way to much dressing.  Furthermore, sometimes you need to stayed because the atmosphere  was happy and festive and they turn up the  music and just have another Seasonal Octoberfest Beer!"
Diana V.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,6,1,1.0,10/13/2017,Service is the worst. I like Apple Bees but not at this location. Stay away from this location.
Angela R.,"Sedona, AZ",33,79,236,5.0,6/9/2017,Me and my co worker stopped here for lunch. The staff was very friendly. We sat at the bar ordered our tortilla soup and oriental salad they were both delicious. The sangria is really good here and so is the bartender. Definitely recommend you stopping by.
Jose H.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,4,2,1.0,10/13/2017,"Food is good service the worst I live 1 block away from this place and I rather drive 20 minutes to a different location than this one they serve you food with out utensils no napkins and they don't even let you say something they just walk away. My wife was drinking a margarita and wanted another one, my daughter wanted dessert but waiter just brought us check and walked away. Take my word this place is awful we have been here previously on a week night and service is just as bad."
Chef J.,"Laveen Village, AZ",0,11,1,1.0,3/2/2017,"Should be a -5 (minus) star. A complete waste of money. Never, ever, have I seen such a disgraceful presentation of a 1/2 rack of ribs in my frikin entire life. You should be ashamed of putting that on a plate to serve to a customer. I feed my Toy Chihuahua bigger portions. Looking at the size of the ribs were compared to what my dogs ribs looked like. Funny my dogs ribs had more meat.  Mr District Manager, you need to check whats going out on the plates. If you sitdown and order this meal, you would be just as disappointed as my wife and I were. Both of us being in the restaurant business for a total of 80 years combined, cooking and managerial,  we know if you wouldn't eat it, don't serve it. Your people need to take ownership and speak up when they see something wrong. I just cant believe this was allowed to be served. It looks like it was boiled all night and then re-heated in microwave. It was as tough as jerky. Shame, shame, shame on you. The funny thing about this ordeal is that I made the mistake. I was supposed to go to Chili's for the ribs which looked good on tv, and I mixed up the names and went to you guys. Never again."
p t.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,19,1,1.0,8/3/2017,"Sad that this is one of the few dining options in this area. The service gets worse every single time. Food isn't great eiyher. Came here for lunch and had to ask for every single thing, including silverware. This is the last time we dine here."
Ainee B.,"Phoenix, AZ",340,269,697,3.0,9/20/2015,"The foods was average but still great, with little bit above average price if I compared with the other restaurants around this area.  The services was great and fast although you need to wait a while for foods! The atmosphere was casual, family style with a lot of TV screens everywhere and most of them in sports channels.  The have happy hours around 3-7 PM."
Brian J.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,98,158,5.0,7/17/2016,"We had a wonderful experience with this place! We've eaten at Applebees in the past and have never been let down; however, up until now, we had always dined at the restaurant. This time, we decided to try something new so we placed our order online. As you can imagine, ordering online turned out to be a very simple process. We got to pick specifically what we wanted with each meal and appetizer. For example, I ordered a burger so I got to specify how I wanted it cooked, what toppings (including sauces and type of cheese), and I even got to specify that I wanted my fries seasoned with garlic. We then set the time for when we wanted the food to be ready. At the specified time, we drove to the restaurant and parked in the space designated for car-side pick-up. Within minutes, a very polite gentleman approached us and asked to confirm our order. Soon afterwards, he brought us our food, which smelled absolutely wonderful on the ride home. The food was terrific. My burger was just fantastic. It was made exactly as I had ordered. My wife had the chicken tenders (which I sampled) and those were awesome too. We also got the boneless barbecue wings, which also rocked.  I can't wait to have Applebees again!"
Edward C.,"South Mountain Village, Tempe, AZ",50,3,,4.0,6/2/2017,This Applebees is hella chill. Came here to get drinks and I was really impressed. Will definitely come here again to drink again.
Lucero R.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,7,,2.0,4/4/2017,I just recently came here was expecting to eat real good because I was just starving my steak was medium the way I like it but didn't have much flavor I felt like my whole dish was just poorly made. I was not satisfied and I had paid a lot for something that was not worth it. Pretty sad about it.
Renee D.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,2,,1.0,7/11/2017,We live in one of the gated communities on south mountain. Been eating at applebees probably once a week. Lately we have been going in and leaving without even sitting down. Seems to be a weird and aweful smell and can not stomache.
Joshua M.,"Mesa, AZ",19,46,2,1.0,12/18/2016,"The customer service was absolutely horrible, we waited for over 25 minutes(while she was talking to another coworker) for our server to come around and even acknowledge us so my kid could get a refill, when you upset my kid because you could not perform the responsibilities of your job, I will tell you exactly how I feel and make sure every hears me...DO NOT IGNORE YOUR CUSTOMERS....People will get pissed, I hope she was terminated immediately"
Belle C.,"Phoenix, AZ",347,77,728,2.0,3/23/2015,"What is it about Applebees that makes us keep coming back to this chain?! Maybe the reasonable prices, the happy hour... but I always leave feeling under satisfied. The food is mediocre. I can think of so many other local places that serve quality American food but for some reason, we find ourselves at Applebees at least twice, maybe 4-5 times a year. It's a safe choice for late light munchies. And this location has friendly, attentive staff. You'll always be seated right away. And one of their charming bartenders does magic! Try to find him. See ya next time, Applebees."
Imelda G.,"Tempe, AZ",34,1,,1.0,12/21/2016,"I have given this Applebee's the benefit of the doubt, not 1,2ce, but 3 times and I just have to say something because I've had enough.  We ordered and paid for the food online, thinking it would be much faster and I'd be able to just pick up and go, but it took close to an hour for it to be ready.  This is especially slow service considering the website quoted 20 min.  However, the length of time it took to get our food makes sense considering my steak was bland and well done.  I had asked for my steak to be medium rare, the garlic green beans were over cooked and the sweet potatoes looked like slop.  At best, this reminded me of my high school cafeteria food!  How is it possible that they think it's ok to sell food like this, especially for the price that they sell it for?   I couldn't even justify that the reason it was less than good was because they were busy.  that was not the case.  I would definitely not recommend even my worst enemy to eat there and I'm not one to be so opinionated or share my experiences so openly."
Chris S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,1.0,3/4/2017,The service sucked when we first got there the little  girl who was the hostess didn't know what she was doing she sat people who came in after us we only had a party of 4 and she was sitting everyone else who had a party of 4 or more as well!! We finally got seated took the waitress a while for her to come get our drink order!!! The food was good and came out pretty fast!!!! When we needed refills she didn't come to the table probably because she was to busy talking to another waitress and not paying attention to her tables
Joey A.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,5.0,1/25/2017,I love coming to this place. The staff is really nice and quick. I have had a great experience every time. Jenni is the best. She is always smiling and is very attentive to her tables.
Merissa T.,"Glendale, AZ",68,35,179,1.0,2/19/2016,"I came to meet a friend here since I was visiting from California and brought my one month old baby. I had to use the restroom to change baby and when I opened the changing table a bunch of green flakes came flying down and onto the table, which to me looked like marijuana. I told my waitress, she just apologized and said she was going to tell the manager. The manager did not come to our table to apologize and tell us that they were going to take care of it and thank you for letting them know. I have never been to a place where the manager does not take responsibility for something that they are managing!"
Deena C.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,22,6,2.0,2/14/2016,"Plenty of seating but still told there was a 25-30 minute wait time. We sat at the bar and watched the 3 couples ahead of us get seated and then 2 that came in after us. All the while there was 3 dirty tables in the bar. Asked the hostess if someone could clean one of them and she said  no, they were for people waiting. The bartender Monica was super sweet and helpful and got the manager. He had a table cleaned for us and the hostess put someone at it. Fine we took the next table. It took our server 10 minutes to get to us and while waiting for our food my bf noticed something floating in my drink. GROSS... Then when we got our food our server didn't give us any silverware or napkins. THANK GOODNESS for Monica. Again she came to the rescue. I wish I could remember the managers name. He was super helpful and very apologetic. 1 star for Monica and 1 star for the sweet manager."
Abmti A.,"Glendale, AZ",11,2,2,2.0,2/1/2016,"To say the quality of this restaurant has gone down would be a serious understatement. We went for lunch. We ordered the unlimited soup, salad, and bread for $9.99. The salad was ok. I guess that is hard to mess up. The soup was not soup. It was the consistency of tomato paste. It glooped off of my spoon. When I asked for another, the waitress said ""well it's the same soup, so..."" And then just kinda shrugged like I was the problem. Then I asked for our bread which we didn't receive. She said ""we don't do that anymore. If you want bread it's a dollar extra."" I explained that it was on the menu. She said ""well, it shouldn't be."" Real nice. My advice, go to Chilis."
Kennyatta P.,"Phoenix, AZ",44,44,30,4.0,6/14/2015,IDK about this place. Hit and miss I guess.  The server was very nice which is always a plus. I had the lemon chicken meal which was nice. It had a very lemon flavor but nice. Now the cheese cake shot was crap. Very grainy and I was very disappointed it that.
Monica O.,"Tempe, AZ",883,941,3095,1.0,3/18/2013,"Dropped my daughter off at her in laws house in South Phoenix and my son and I had some time to kill before we had to pick her back up, and I wasn't into driving back into Chandler. I asked my son if he wanted to go visit our old Applebee's.  We use to live in South Phoenix for 8 years, and Applebee's on 24th st & Baseline became like a family/friend hang out for us. So off we went, it was 7pm on St Patty's Day but only had a 15 min wait, which we thought was pretty cool.  When we got to our booth, we talked about the times we had been there , and how one time my son was just being a jerk and the rest of us were starving and he only ordered celery, it was fun talking about the old memories. We went with the 2 for 20 deal, and the food tasted great, our service was friendly and fast, it was the end of the meal and we just paid and then my son looked down on the floor and just said oh my, I looked at him because he doesn't say that that much and I said whats going on,  he said mom, just move fast and lets leave a mouse just ran by our feet...I said WHAT!! He said yes, it was this big showing me with his hands and said just move carefully and lets go, let me tell you I wanted to puke my dinner up right then....but I didn't, I left the tip, because she was good, and we left. Yes I did tell Patrick the Kitchen Manger that my son had saw a mouse, he told me that they come from across the street and that he will notify his pest control guy. BUT OMG!!! I hate mice, I will not be coming back, I know it happens more often than I would like to know about, this was a place that held some fun memories for us, but I am not looking to go back any time soon."
Anthony G.,"Phoenix, AZ",30,12,2,1.0,11/20/2014,"Worst Applebee's ever, this location reminded me why I stopped eating at this chain period. First the wait for the food was long and they weren't even busy second we asked for medium rare on our sirloin and all our meat was well done. drinks never got refilled we ordered mixed drinks that took over 30 min to get. Oh and the manager asked us what kinda sauce we wanted and I guess he forgot to bring us the A1 cause he never came back. Our waitress wasn't attentive. Applebee's is not the spot like it use to be years ago. This location sucks take your business somewhere else!"
Rick G.,"Phoenix, AZ",998,396,11390,1.0,4/13/2015,"My wife and I have frequented many a fabulous Applebee's across the country and have always been fascinated by their ability to offer very good food, great atmosphere and some of the best service of any chain eatery around.  Something really wrong seems to have happened at this location. Food was just okay, and the service atrocious.  With multiple tables clear and available we were told there was a twenty minute wait.  When asking about the tables that were clean and clear, we were told they were reserved - at Applebee's? Another family ahead of us, made the decision to go next door to IHOP!  We eventually did something we've never done before, we confiscated one of the various empty tables.  By the time dinner came around, we found the servings were adequate, but the taste and apparent quality of our fare was less than noteworthy!  At this visit we tried the Club Grill Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries which was nothing to write home about, and the Fish & Chips with French Fries.  As a traditional Fish & Chips lover, and often ordered at Applebee's, I found the fish and its batter was considerably bland, unlike many others I've enjoyed over the years in many another Applebee's.  Although the server was nice and very apologetic for the inconvenience, and the on duty manager also apologized, we found the incident very discomforting and aggravating to experience from what usually has been a favorite. Hopefully this a one-off incident, but it may take a long time before I frequent this Applebee's again. Consommateurs d'être prudents."
Marva C.,"Houston, TX",14,16,12,1.0,6/14/2015,"I called at 9:15 pm on a Sunday and told them I wanted carside to go. I was told after ordering my simple meal that I would have to come inside to pick it up! Huh? It's carside to go! The young lady told me that they were unable to come outside after a certain hour. Ummmm, ok.....then after a certain hour you should offer TAKE OUT not curbside to go! Do not go to this Applebee's if you want the convenience that they say they offer!!!!"
Ashley M.,"Phoenix, AZ",94,5,3,2.0,7/9/2016,"It was a busy night. Therefore it is obvious that service and food may take a little longer than usual.   I don't mind having a busy server as long as they have a good attitude.  Out server was great. He was not the problem. Our wings came out extremely dry and crunchy, it is obvious that it was thrown into the frier a couple times. The wings were so dry and and crunchy they were clearly old wings.  The fries came out a while after the wings and we're dark brown. Clearly those were refried a couple times and they tasted awful.   This has been about the third time I've come and each time the wings come out tasting very old. I will not be coming back and would not recommend this location.  Food is awful.  Except for the Wong tong chicken tacos. Those are the bomb. Also, I had a Pina colada and the drink was extremely watered down.  The drink tasted more watery than it should've been.  Could have been due to the fact that the server was busy and it may have been sitting at the bar for 15 minutes.  It came out shortly before dinner was out."
Viridiana R.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,6,4,5.0,11/17/2015,The food here is great every time I have came here to eat it has been a great expletive with good costumer service. I don't have a complaint about this place. Have been going to the same location for years. Highly recommend.
Rick B.,"Phoenix, AZ",46,3,,1.0,2/11/2016,"I left a pair of my sunglasses on the table because I was gathering all of my 5 month olds stuff up. I understand it was my fault I didn't pay much attention and I had to call back later to ask for them back. (The only people that would have touched the table after I left would be the waitress picking up her tip or the busser cleaning the table up). The manager Kenny then told me that they weren't there. I work in customer service too and people leave things in my store all the time and come back looking for them, we on the other hand actually give the items back instead of letting our employees keep them. Sure, I left them on the table but I didn't think that makes them fair game for the employees to keep!!!!!   I called twice and ""Kenny"" was not helpful at all. He let me know when I asked for corporates phone # that he didn't think they would do anything for me then spit the # at me as fast as he could then hung up. I will definitely be calling. And posting this review everywhere I can."
Will E.,"Festus, MO",0,4,,2.0,9/6/2015,"From one visit to the next some things have not improved. This time it was the Sizzling Double Barrel Whiskey Sirloin ordered by our guest. He ordered it medium rare yet it came out sizzling well done! Now what? It was more than 15 minutes until his medium rare steak was delivered. So I had another drink! Now the bar tab equals the food bill. Lacey, our server was nice enough but not familiar with the wine menu. Luckily, no problem ordering whiskey on the rocks for me. I tipped $20. on a $77. check. We get gift cards from time to time and will go back hoping against hope for that great experience."
Deanna S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,2,,4.0,8/4/2015,Me and my boy friend ate here a few days ago. And we loved it. There was a problem in the kitchen with our ticket but our waitress took action immediately to ask us what we jad ordered and theyd make it on the fly. And for having to wait a few extra minutes she braught us a free desert. Our waitress made the wait bareable and it ws nice to just sit and pend time out of the house. Thank you personally to India W. Who was our waitress that evening.
J. G.,"Henrico, VA",1,22,,3.0,1/3/2015,"Food is pretty much what you'd expect from Applebee's, can get pretty lod on certain  nights.  Michelle, Celeste, and Jen  are awesome  can't say enough  good things about them.  Manager  izzy is a real douchedbag though and  not very smart. However manager Patrick is awesome!   Check it out for your own opinion."
Mala H.,"Washington, DC",45,191,673,2.0,5/19/2013,"Ok for a quick lunch. The server was nice, but the food was average at best."
Cindy L.,"Phoenix, AZ",15,12,,1.0,8/1/2013,"If I could go negative, I would and I am usually a big fan of Applebee's! Had the same experience with the gift card fiasco as someone else reviewing and it didn't impress me.   Called in car side yesterday and showed up at time they said.  Sat in my car with another customer beside me for over 5 mins, no one came out. I called the store and they sent someone out to get my name and order!! Um, didn't you get all that PLUS make n color when I ordered?!? He had to then go back in to get it.  I was livid by now so I just gave him the cash and drove off.  Never again will I go to this one.  I will drive outta my way next time..."
Sam V.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,6,,1.0,8/25/2013,"Awful experience. My girlfriend and I just wanted a quick bite that wouldn't make us feel like crap, so we fell for the Applebee's ad for low calorie options. We got there and we're seated near the door despite there being plenty of room in the restaurant. They seated a man who appeared to be homeless and providing his own beverage choices (he poured a clear liquid into his water glass).  We didn't get to order for about 15 minutes. We both ordered an under 500 calorie meal and neither of us finished it. It looked like a diet microwave meal dumped on the plate. Some of the shrimp were overcooked and rubbery while others were undercooked and translucent.   Not going back, even though it is just down the street."
Young K.,"Tempe, AZ",0,2,,1.0,1/7/2015,I was with my bae and the waiter asked us what we wanted I asked for a water and he looked at me like I was crazy sohe resumes asks my bf what he wants to drink he replied Pepsi and when I made my order of food he then looked at my bf asking him what he wanted he replied nothing the guy asked repeatedly if he was sure then gave him a dirty look like if he was poor but shitty service please don't go here
Kanisha S.,"Phoenix, AZ",94,71,,2.0,3/29/2014,This Applebee's is so crowd I hate going there. The wait is alway ridiculous. Which I don't really understand why. The food is bland and cold unless you get a skillet steak. The happy hour is okay bit even then it still classified as bar food at best. My recommendation is find another place.
Paul V.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,10,,5.0,11/15/2015,"I went to Applebee at this location on veteran's day and experienced the best in food and service of any place that day. The worse was the sizzler. Applebees really made me feel like a guest of honor. I am grateful for the experience. I would recommend this location to my friends, family, and fellow veterans."
Caroline F.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,4,,1.0,10/25/2015,"The food is great, but I don't like going to that place anymore. Every single time i've been there, something is always wrong with my orders. Either they forget a certain or they just give the wrong food. Last time I was there, I ordered the Hawaiian burger that they have.. but they gave me a burger that had nothing but mushrooms on it. And the waiter STILL had the audacity to try to convince me and keep the mushroom burger. I kept on insisting on the original burger I ordered, it was a huge hassle. The service there is just terrible."
Anna G.,"Mesa, AZ",52,5,,1.0,3/19/2014,"The good was TERRIBLE! In addition to that the service was even WORSE! No ice, the food was not cooked properly as well as it took forever for anything to finally make it to our table! We will never return to this particular place AGAIN!"
