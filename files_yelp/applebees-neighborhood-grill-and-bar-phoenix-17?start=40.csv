Zach K.,"Phoenix, AZ",187,5,2,4.0,7/13/2015,"I really enjoy Applebee's. The food isn't quote on quote amazing, but for the price, it's enjoyable. I personally enjoy the oriental chicken salad. It's something different than most restaurants have and makes Applebee's stand out. I don't recommend coming to Applebee's to get a steak because of course for the reasonable prices it's not going to compare to places like outback. If you want a reasonably priced meal, some food that will satisfy you, I recommend going to Applebee's."

Vince F.,"Phoenix, AZ",414,16,18,2.0,2/15/2015,"This is a chain and with any chain food is a 7.5 at best. It's more so convenience rather than preference. Now there is a 5 at this location and its a waitress I cannot recall her name but she's mid 30's blonde hair, heavy set woman. She is the best server in the place. Usually if I can sit in her section I leave. Other than that today when we went the food came out pretty fast but what made me quite upset was how long it took on refills and the young man seemed like he didn't want to help us. The best thing on the menu to me is the 2 for 20 or 2 for 25 you won't be displeased with anything on that section. Now my wife likes the pub grill diet salmon but I've never had it. I get ribs or the sirloin and for a chain the steak is pretty good. The management is quite friendly ironically they speak and are very cordial but quite a bit of the wait staff is impatient, rude, and could condescending."
Lisa B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,6,,1.0,3/27/2015,"Poor service! The food however, is great! I suggest calling your order in and picking it up. You will receive better service, avoid the wait and avoid the inattentive/unprofessional staff."
M G.,"Phoenix, AZ",29,164,16,4.0,5/17/2013,"Food at Applebees tis just okay, got their soup and salad which is a good deal.  Caylee was our server and she was great so that is why they got 4 stars!"
Michael G.,"Phoenix, AZ",11,6,,5.0,1/12/2013,"I always love a trip to the neighborhood Applebee's in South Phoenix when I'm in town. The recent remodel looks great. Service, drinks, and food were excellent tonight!!!"
Cupcake M.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,57,25,3.0,8/10/2011,"No more breadstick for you ...    My co-worker and I went  to Applebee's for lunch, it was after 1, so we figured the rush would be gone. We each ordered the USS (unlimited soup and salad). While we were eatting our server asked if we wanted to have another go around of soup and salad, while I love love soup, I am not big on salad, so I said I would have soup and another breadstick, he said sorry we are only allowed to give one breadstick per USS deal. What? Really? Yep, if you want unlimited breadsticks you better head east to Olive Garden. I will say that it is a good deal for the $6.99 price, if you are a salad fanatic, then you will love the 8 varieties to choose from and the cup of soup is a hearty portion."
Anthony S.,"San Francisco, CA",36,15,,3.0,8/28/2012,"The Applebee's on Elliot is a Big NO for me. Service is very slow & they didn't even give me the correct amount of food I paid for! I will say that I do go to the Applebee's on 24th & Baseline quite frequently. It's good for a quick drink, food is average, service is ok! Go during non-busy hrs to avoid the crowd. Drink of choice is the Blue Moon or Long Island Iced Tea"
Greg M.,"Phoenix, AZ",30,190,100,3.0,12/30/2012,"It's applebees what can you expect. The server had too many tables, the drinks were slow due to the bartender serving too many guests. I sort of expect it though. That's why I normally sit at the bar and will from now on. The Happy hour is nice though."
Stacy G.,"Laveen, AZ",8,15,2,1.0,3/26/2012,This food sucks. I would rather spend 20 cents on ramen noodles because I would end up happier. Even when a coworker drags you here just pass on putting any of this in your mouth. No matter how hungry you are!
Ed P.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,76,34,2.0,1/4/2013,"Ok, it's been a while since I've been to any Applebee's (6+ years) but I think it will likely be longer before I go back again.  I brought my niece who was visiting Phoenix with her husband and kids figuring it would be easy for everyone to find something on the menu they could enjoy.  Things started out fine with the service and we ordered some appetizers.  Food order was taken and we were enjoying our visit.  It wasn't very busy but yet a different waiter brought out the first few dishes of lunch and asked ""who had the shrimp?""  Several of us ordered a shrimp dish but my niece said ""I had the wait watchers shrimp.""  ""Ahhh, this must be yours then"" said the waitress.  After a few bites my niece realized it was not the shrimp dish she ordered.  The remaining plates had still not arrived and we explained to the waitress the error when she delivered the remaining plates.  We asked for a new meal to be prepared for my wife and she left with the plate.  Now this is where it gets good.   Our waiter then comes back to our table with the original dish that my niece had eaten from and proceeds to place it in front of my wife saying ""this one's yours, right?'  We agreed that was what she ordered but that my niece had been mistakenly served the plate and had taken a few bites from it.  His response????  ""That's ok, your all family right?""  He seemed shocked we asked to have a fresh plate created.  Family or no family that is quite an assumption to be made!  My wife had never met this part of my family and being a registered nurse has a little thing about proper preparation, etc of food.  Wow, was all we could say.  He reluctantly went to the kitchen and 10 minutes later returned with a fresh (hopefully) dish. Food was ok but nothing to get us to overcome the odd service."
Ambrosia M.,"Phoenix, AZ",45,57,7,4.0,1/5/2011,"I always receive good service here, went yesterday around lunch time and was seated promptly.  Food came out in a very decent time frame.  2 entrees and an appetizer for only $20 YOU CAN  NOT BEAT IT!  And the food was excellent Also, there is karaoke until around 2am, I'm not sure exactly what nights besides Friday's and Saturdays, but it's always entertaining! Check the location out for sure :)"
Catherine C.,"Tempe, AZ",23,50,,2.0,4/17/2011,I have been to this location 2 times during lunch because it is close to my work. I didn't think the service was that great either time. The food is good though. I will probably be back to this location unfortunately because there is not much around this area to eat when you only get an hour for lunch.
Tim D.,"Glencoe, AL",0,29,,2.0,5/16/2011,I went on Thursday which is Kareoke night loud and drinks are 1/2 price. Food isn't any good though
Devon G.,"Phoenix, AZ",41,18,12,1.0,9/14/2012,Horrible! Waited 40 minutes on a Wednesday at 2 pm. there was a line out the door and only 3 tables were taken. no one came up to us for 15 minutes and he was rude and dirty. waitress was rude and had dirty fingernails. she kept sighing and grunting and would just throw stuff on our table. hamburger was served raw. Literally RAW. Won't even go on about it. Ruined appledbees for me forever. Stay AWAY!
Heather D.,"Wilkes-Barre, PA",95,245,9,4.0,7/16/2008,"I've been here twice during my busy lunch break, and I've been very happy with the service.  The price is also great.  I really love the 3 veggy sides; I usually do the macaroni and cheese, house salad and french fries.  You can't beat that for $5.99!  I'm also very impressed with how fast and attentive the servers are during this busy time.  I found the host to be friendly and quick to seat us as well.  I would come back any time for lunch!"
Alexis B.,"Sun City, AZ",0,2,,1.0,11/5/2013,"Applebees is a restaurant that serves American style food, such as burgers and salads and soups.  The food is mediocre and not the highest quality that I have ever had.  I went out to dinner with two friends before a movie we were going to see.  We had arrived an hour and a half earlier then the movie would start ensuring we would have enough time to eat and make it to the movie on time.  We were seated in a decent amount of time.  The server took about 20 minutes to come over to take our drink orders.  Once we had ordered, she came back 30 minutes later with our drinks.  At this point we were a little frustrated with the service.  We asked if we could order right away because we had a movie to get to and she was aware of this.  She took our order and said it would be out shortly.  We waited for 40 minutes before we started to get impatient.  After about 55 minutes we grabbed another waitress, since ours was no where to be found and asked her what was taking so long.  She said she would go check on our food for us and came back to inform us that our order had not even been placed.  We were furious.  I immediately went and complained to the manager about how horrible the service we had received was and how our waitress had taken over an hour and had not even placed our order.  The manager apologized profusely and said that she would get our meals out right away and that they would be on the house.  We were so angry and disappointed in the service and once our food was finally brought out we were continually disappointed by the low quality of the food.  Once we had finally left the movie had already started and we were forced to wait until the next showing of the movie.  Ever since that experience at Applebees,  I have not been back to the establishment and will never recommend it to anyone."
Chilon K.,"Berkeley, CA",0,35,2,4.0,9/28/2011,Excellent Service. I am usually not a fan of Applebee's food. Of the corporate chain food restaurants Applebees has great deserts but usually below par for dinner entrees. But this Applebees has amazing service and an excellent staff. Definitely the best atmosphere of any restaurant in the area and definitely a much better bar than any in the area. I would recommend going here before any other Applebees from California to New York. The bar staff has excellent service.
Michelle S.,"Mesa, AZ",0,5,,1.0,9/11/2012,"Horrible... I ordered car side to go because I was in a hurry and thought it would be a good way to save time. I placed my order with a server who didn't know anything about the menu or lunch specials. I was told my order would be ready at 1:30 and asked what type of vehicle I drive. Pulled up in the car side spot around 1:40 and continued to sit in my car and wait another 8 minutes. Finally walked in the side door to a server who was standing there talking on the phone. He acknowledged me while still on the phone and I told him I was picking up an order to go. He looked at a few tickets and didn't bother to check the bag that was sitting right in front of him, said it would be a few minutes and then moved to another station to get on a personal phone call. Waiting another couple of minutes another server came out bringing drinks and asked what I needed. Finally he was able to get me my food that was sitting at the station the whole time. I let him know I was out there waiting 10 minutes and that there was another car there waiting too. This is just ridiculous whats the point of car side. I may be able to understand if it was busy but the place was dead and servers seem to care more about their personal phone calls then their customers agenda."
