Jess B.,"Punta Gorda, United States",1,55,,3.0,6/4/2014,"This Applebee's is quieter than the one in Murdock so if you want talk to family and have them hear you, you might want to bring them to this one. I would avoid late Winter/Spring season because flying ants infest the place. You will be covered in flying ants sitting in the window booths. Gross!"

Reviewer M.,"Clearwater, United States",0,21,1,4.0,2/7/2013,"I did not even recognize this Applebee's from the reviews. Lovely professional staff and piping hot good food, not expensive, and served promptly, characteristic of the best (examples of) Applebee's I have been to. We like the chain,and this was not atypical. Exceptionally nice and helpful staff and manager. We were en route from Sanibel to St Pete and it was a lovely experience, glad we stopped."
