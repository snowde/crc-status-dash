Latara M.,"Griffith, IN",288,145,333,5.0,10/3/2017,"This is one place I will grow to love more and more over time. I've had some really hard times in my life and I've mourned them here. Good times and celebrated them here.   My first date with my husband was here. The day we got married we stopped in here. And many years later..... Here again just for lunch. This place has seen me through all times in my life. I love it. We have such a wonderful relationship with each of the managers. They are so nice they come up to us just to chat. Gotta love it.   I always fail to do a review on the places I go to the most and I feel so bad. But it's like they are family so I tend to forget.   Service is always excellent. Courteous, prompt and knowledgeable.   Prices are lower than any other place to get food. Guaranteed.   Location is so convenient. And it's always so chill.  And it's always clean. Every time I've ever had to use the restroom I haven't cringed so. That's a plus. The food has definitely improved over the past few years. I'm going to continue to come here until I physically can't anymore.   I do recommend! Location: excellent 5 Prices: way below average 5 Cleanliness: exceptional 5 Customer service: 5 Quality: excellent 5 25 out of 25=5stars"
Herman T.,"Seattle, WA",215,61,87,3.0,9/13/2017,Service is pretty good. Food is alright. There is nothing here that will surprise you good or bad. Just what you expect.
Jackee M.,"Chicago, IL",180,185,248,3.0,11/8/2016,"Stopped in because I was starving and had a long drive ahead of me and didn't want fast food. While the food was what I expected, the service was insanely horrible and slooooowwwww. Ordered soup which took easily 15 min. I ate it and when I finished waited another 15 for my food. My dirty plates that clearly symboled ""please take these away"" sat in front of me for another 15 min.  Almost wished I had stopped for fast food so I could be almost an hour ahead of where I am now. And that's all I have to say about that.  Jackée"
Jeff M.,"Union Mills, IN",12,27,28,5.0,8/2/2016,"After reading some of the reviews here on Yelp, was worried we had stopped in here.  But what problems they may had in the past, are gone.  All of the staff are very pleasant and helpful.  Appetizers were very tasty. Cheeseburger Egg Rolls and mozzarella cheese sticks, both very good. Served in a very timely manner and hot.  Lunches were all very good. Also served very timely and hot.   Give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."
Chloe H.,"Near North Side, Chicago, IL",0,3,1,1.0,2/20/2017,"Pretty sure, I would have been more satisfied with a Kid Cuisine T.V dinner.  It was pretty comical how disgusting everything was. I forgot my I.d. I'm sure that would have made my experience a little bit better. Server was decent."
Phil M.,"Portage, IN",0,10,,2.0,6/23/2017,"This place used to be great, now it has the odor of despair. Once a restaurant and bar, the bar has become the focus. We ate here recently and what a change - the waiter wasn't paying attention and perhaps couldn't read his own writing - of the 8 items we ordered, 3 were incorrect. My baked potato arrived loaded with sour cream - no thanks, the broccoli was half yellow, and my steak was, not sure how to best describe this...mushy. He didn't know how many ounces were in the various draft sizes of beer, only three silverware setups for four people - The dirty appetizer dishes were never removed after entrees were delivered. Throughout the meal we were serenaded with overly loud ""music"" ranging from head-banging  crap to something with somewhat obscene lyrics. Not an overall pleasant experience. This might be what happens when the drunks at the bar control the jukebox. Even though we saw a manager on duty, he never stopped by to check our table. Darla, where are you when we need you?! Turn down the music, retrain certain wait personnel and check your steak quality control. The sign in the front window says Grill and Bar, but seems to becoming a bar with a grill."
Alan H.,"Aurora, IL",0,9,1,3.0,3/14/2017,Normally the service and the food are very good. Tonight there were problems from the start. It turned out our waiter was somewhat absent minded. We ordered some cheese sticks as an appetizer which the waiter forgot to put on our order. We sat and watched him passing the time of day with a woman in the next booth before we realized something was wrong. When we asked the waiter for our cheese sticks he said he forgot. The manager came out and said she took the cheese sticks off the bill. My wife's order was wrong. My order was medium well steak. The steak came well done and was inedible. We were sorry that we had a bad experience. We may think twice the next time we decide to eat out.
Justin J.,"Chino, CA",115,210,50,1.0,2/24/2016,Can you say yikes?.. This is by far the worst Applebee's I have ever seen. Poor management leads to lazy servers and poor attitudes towards customer service or even making simple dishes. This Applebee's is nothing like you would expect from other locations. All bar tenders are not even the least bit knowledgeable on basic bartending or mixology and the food is always full of extra sweet ingredients which absolutely destroys even the simplest meals. If you just want a beer and chips I recommend this place. But if you want food or an actual drink I recommend you make it at home. Thus place tastes like sad.
Lori U.,"New Lenox, IL",14,5,,1.0,9/10/2016,Served a hamburger raw in the middle plus was on a kid size bun disgusting bad service yuck
Roseann M.,"Chicago, IL",122,453,94,3.0,8/26/2014,"The three of us came to Applebee's in Portage because I asked my 82-year-old aunt, who lives in Hobart, where she would like to go for lunch. Although it was a hot day, the air conditioning on my Civic was working well, so we drove down Route 6 until we found National Vendor Row in Portage. it was a Monday, and the restaurant wasn't busy at noon. I was surprised to see the advertisements for alcoholic beverages when we came in. That didn't fit with my image of a family restaurant, but I've seen many articles in the last year that discussed how Applebee's fortunes have been on the decline. Maybe they added alcoholic beverages to entice more diners. It was lunchtime, however, and none of us were inclined to imbibe. The menu is very large and requires some time to peruse. My aunt very quickly found an Asian Chicken Salad that appealed to her. For me, as a vegetarian, the menu was a problem. There is almost nothing -- literally, ALMOST NOTHING --for a vegetarian. And I eat milk and cheese. If you're a vegan, maybe you can get French fries. All I found was a 4-cheese grilled sandwich with tomato basil soup. Mind you, the temperature that day was 94 degrees, and it was humid. I asked our waiter, could I substitute a salad for the soup? He checked, and said sure, for another $1.59. I went with the soup. My friend ordered the same thing as me. She's not vegetarian, so maybe she was trying to empathize with me. Anyway, I have to say, the grilled cheese was really good. It wasn't your ordinary grilled cheese. And the tomato soup was good, too. Our waiter was a young man who said it was only his 3rd day on the job. As a long-time restaurant worker, I could tell he had prior experience. He may have been learning the new menu, but his service was professional and friendly. Would I return to Applebee's? Only if my aunt insisted on it. It's 2014, Applebee's. You need to have menu options for vegetarians and vegans. Sheesh, even the macaroni and cheese had chicken in it! Whoever heard of such a crazy thing! Add a veggie burger. Add a pasta without cream or meat. It's not that hard. While the experience was okay for service and atmosphere, I can't return to a place where I have only one menu item to enjoy. Even if it is good."
Maryann M.,"Portage, IN",28,3,,1.0,8/28/2016,"Terrible service, waitress sacked. Order medium/well steak came out red inside and bled when cut into, that's not medium/well. Returned steak came back was not charcoal and like eating beef jerry. Get some people who know how to cook"
Jim W.,"Chesterton, IN",3,36,8,2.0,4/21/2015,"Chain restaurants have an Achilles heel of zero control over food quality, so I'll say this about the food: average.  Not even sure why I went there, with quality option all around. Variety, I guess.  Anyhoo, nice decor and decent service. The price was way too much for the product.  Itch scratched. No need to go back."
H C.,"Maple Park, IL",0,2,,1.0,8/14/2016,"Yelp, please add an ""0 star"" review option. Worst Apple bees in the nation. Bad service, nasty management. Food taste like garbage. Close this location out. Just close it."
Tiffany N.,"Valparaiso, IN",18,60,283,5.0,8/27/2016,We went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. We sat in the bar area to watch the football games. The waitress was attentive and the manager even came to see how things were or if we needed anything. We got the 2 entrees and an appetizer for $20 which was a deal. We looked at their happy hour specials for weekdays and we may come back to take advantage of that.
Mike S.,"Michigan City, IN",2,34,6,1.0,10/30/2015,"No real quality control. I had a steak here that tasted and looked artificial. It was maybe the worst thing I've ever put in my mouth. To top it all off I have to look at a huge mural on the wall of Portage cops.... made me just wanna puke ! I'll never come back to "" the neighborhood "" lol...."
Karen B.,"Portage, IN",17,2,,1.0,12/27/2015,10 open tables and we have to wait 15 to get seated. Really!!  And I had my handicapped mother with me. And the menu has changed. More expensive and can't find anything I like to order.
Victoria M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",932,468,310,1.0,5/23/2012,"Not a huge fan of Applebee's but I ate lunch here with friends and family while on a visit to my hometown.  My husband ordered a sort of french dip sandwich; he was the only one who enjoyed his meal.  I had an oriental chicken salad and french onion soup.  The salad was good (how can you really mess up a salad?) but the soup was so thick with blobs of runny onions, it was as if it had been sitting there for days.  Ick.  My friend ordered the Southwest Chicken salad and said it was just so-so.  My mom had just eaten, so she went for the Maple Butter Pecan Blondie. Our visit was going smoothly until Jennifer, our waitress tried to poison my mother with melted plastic from a container of what she called ""sauce"" for the Blondie.  When she delivered the dessert to our table, the sauce comes in a plastic cup on the side, which she set on the hot plate obviously by mistake and it melted, dripping ""sauce"" and plastic all over the plate. At first, she tried to play it off like everything was fine, saying, ""oh, it's just the sauce that spilled out.""  She even set the plate down in front of my mom and started to walk away with the melted plastic container!! We couldn't believe our eyes!!  There was black plastic melted, mixed in with the sauce all over her dessert!!  I called her back and pointed out that the plastic melted in with the sauce and I can't believe she expected my mom to eat that!! Upon being ""caught"" she offered to bring us a new dessert.  I sure wish I had caught this on video... Terrible."
Sean L.,"Valparaiso, IN",101,13,,1.0,11/22/2015,30 min to get our appetizer . Came out cold. Food was just ok. Terrible service .avoid this place if you don't want to wait forever. Bull shit
Ashara P.,"Merrillville, IN",1,4,,4.0,12/9/2015,Love the wings!!! I usually get the boneless classic wings and they are breaded and sauced to perfection.The service is great as well!! The best time to go is late evening as it's not overly crowded!! The prices are definitely reasonable! They usually always have 2 for $20 deals going on.
Brian S.,"Portage, IN",1,23,5,1.0,12/12/2015,"Ordered French onion soup and split a lunch. Upgraded to the French fries since nine bucks for a lunch isn't enough to include fries here. We were asked if we would like the soups before the lunch. We said yes. We got the soup and less than a minute later, our lunch arrived. Soup was warm, not hot. Tried a fry and they tasted like they were made the day before. We let the waiter know and he got us new hot fries. The wrap was also not very hot, but that could have been because it came out at the same time as the soup. One of the issues here is that each time we God something from the kitchen, a new person brought it out. Very disorganized. I used to like this Applebee's, but with so many new restaurants opening in Portage, I won't be back."
Shawn R.,"Portage, IN",8,163,273,3.0,8/2/2014,"I have always liked this place.  The food is decent and their salads are fantastic.  The one and only draw back is they are WAY overpriced.  I am willing to pay a little extra for something a little better but Applebee's is WAY WAY overpriced.  I mean the prices are outrageous.  The food isn't that good.  There isn't any reason I should have to pay over $60 for two, drinks not included, for slightly above average food.  It was nice knowing you."
Mary B.,"Hobart, IN",880,620,497,2.0,12/28/2008,"I don't care for this chainy restaurant anymore, the food is usually just eh.....the only thing I like is the sizzling apple dessert they have. Other than that, I'd rather go and find someplace else."
valerie t.,"Olympia, WA",11,21,,1.0,12/4/2007,"First of all. I used to like Applebee's. It's cozy, has cliche junk on the walls and I could always count on it for a good time with my family. No complaints there.  Until I became a vegetarian and realized that the only vegetarian thing on the menu was some pizza hors devoure item. Now, I am not some elite vegetarian, not every restaurant has to have a full section of meatless meals. But I expect to find something reletively healthy for us vegetarians or at least flexitarians out there who want to enjoy a night out with friends and family and not have to starve.  Strike two against this and any other Applebee's I have had the displeasure of visiting is thier wait staff knowing close to nothing about he menu. ""Does this have chicken in it?"" (Blank stare and shrugs shoulders) Know your menu for those of us that need you to!!! Applebee's should realize that it needs to cater to the very large portion of its guests who choose not to eat meat."
Samantha P.,"Portage, IN",0,62,2,3.0,9/26/2011,"Sadly in Portage, the land of chain eateries, Applebees ranks high amongst competition The food is bland, the bar is mediocre and the place is in need of a good deep cleaning but still clean enough that I don't get the heebie jeebies eating here. I don't go here unless I'm out with friends and they insist on going here because they all love Applebees (yuck) but I give it three stars because the staff is friendly and the manager is an amazing guy who really seems to love his job and enjoy trying to please his customers. He is also really great at trying to organize community projects that his store participates in. I worked a pancake breakfast that they recently did for the homeless shelter and he was so nice and even though he made nothing off of it he really pulled out all the stops making the breakfast the best he could. I have to say if all people did their jobs like this and did the best they could places would run so much better. As much as I dislike chains I'll rate applebees in portage higher based off his pleasantness alone, wish I could remember his name."
