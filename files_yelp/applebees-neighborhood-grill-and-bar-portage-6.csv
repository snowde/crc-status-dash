Katerina N.,"Vicksburg, MI",33,66,297,4.0,9/20/2017,"I like Applebees because no matter where you are in the country you can count on Applebees to be what it should be. They have a bit of something for everyone and I enjoy the fact that they keep those classics even while they try out new things on the menu.  They have probably the best kids meal options I've ever seen. And it's a decent amount of food for kids portions. I love that they have the 2 for 20$ menu. Everyone should be able to splurge and go out to eat once in a while and this menu helps ensure that a date night is affordable for everyone. That means a lot to me.  This location is one of my favorites. It's always clean and the staff seem to like working there. My server today was hilarious and kind. It's always appreciated when they make a point to connect with their guests. It really makes for a great dining experience.  Any time I've ever had an issue they have gone out of their way to ensure it was corrected and I was happy. They care about their customers and the experience they have. I know it's a chain but I appreciate that each location was redecorated to highlight the local schools,  sports teams, police and fire stations. It makes it feel like they appreciate the communities that keep them in business."
Sherry F.,"South Bend, IN",73,49,49,5.0,1/25/2017,"Stopped in for lunch around 12:30. Restaurant was moderately busy. I was seated right away, waitress took my drink order and delivered it immediately.   She took my order, checked in on me several times, food was prompt and cooked as ordered. Overall pleasant experience."
Antonio R.,"Kalamazoo, MI",24,184,1289,3.0,11/22/2015,Came here with my family after months of not coming to this place and it was a good surprise! Food was great! I ordered the 4 cheese mac & cheese with chicken strips and it was delicious. Service was a little bit slow. Be careful on the game screen you have in your table. If you use it they charge you $2!  However I got a free bar snack from Yelp. Great!!!
Danny K.,"Lawton, MI",0,16,2,4.0,3/19/2017,"Good service, Good food, Big Tv's, great environment. They had good waiters and it felt like more than a chain restaurant. It was a lot better then the last Applebee's I went to. Definitely coming here again."
Sarah G.,"Portage, MI",0,45,3,2.0,8/17/2017,"service is so-so, food is not amazing. been there twice in the last couple of months because we had gift cards, not impressed either time. yesterday the music was ""peanut butter jelly time"" followed by something current/pop-y, followed by ""dueling banjos."" very odd. also quite loud."
Veronica M.,"Grand Prairie, TX",31,27,129,5.0,8/29/2015,Enjoyed much needed family time n Kazoo Applebee's. We ordered appetizers from half off list. Ended up being a lot of food
Rich M.,"Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco, CA",3,13,2,3.0,4/25/2015,Food was good.  Salmon was very good.  Lemon chicken was good but a bit over cooked.  Steak was OK. Silverware and plates were dirty...multiple sets.  Very concerning. Service was good. Price was reasonable.
Susan P.,"Kalamazoo, MI",0,9,,3.0,5/15/2016,"The service my sisters and I received was good. The only complaint is have is with the menu. It seems like it's gotten a lot smaller than it use to be.  I would love to see some more options added back on.  With as small as the menu is now,  I'm not site I'll return, at least not for some time."
Shawn B.,"Mattawan, MI",56,152,115,5.0,12/31/2014,"Stopped for lunch on a Sunday, it was really busy and that surprised me. We were seated  quickly though and our server Allison was very quick and friendly. Generally I  don't even remember the servers name, but she was really good considering how packed her section was. I used a Yelp check in offer for free onion rings, I've used these check in offers quite a bit and usually they bring a manager over to check on it, but this time after one quick glance we were all set. Food came quick and was great."
Puck H.,"Portage, MI",10,10,2,5.0,7/29/2014,Lunch menu is good and decently priced.  Some good selections to mix and match.  Even ordering off the normal menu the food has come up in a quick and timely manner.   I had come once previously a week prior and multiple staff members have greeted me friendly and remembered my previous visits.   The Tvs available are good to have a nice casual dining experience on lunch while watching a sports event either on replay or live.
Katie B.,"Chaska, MN",502,2,,4.0,7/7/2015,"After the first few times of going to this location, I was very unimpressed. I expressed my displeasure with the service a few days ago and am very impressed and pleased with the timely and professional response to my complaints. I am optimistic that some changes will be made with in store customer service. Applebee's has been a family favorite for years!"
Kelsey C.,"Bettendorf, IA",0,1,,1.0,7/2/2015,Waited for 20 minutes and no one came to serve us we left without service would not recommend this Applebee's.
Alexandra L.,"Kalamazoo, MI",1,10,,4.0,10/23/2013,"Love the food here, my fav are the boneless bbq wings. This applebee's service is really good, a lot of young people work here w/ lots of energy, but the last couple times I went there the booths have been left with left over food on it and the tables were sticky with messy floors too....other than that the food is really good"
Roland S.,"Kalamazoo, MI",2,2,,1.0,5/3/2015,"Service was great, atmosphere was pleasant, drinks and appetizers all good. That 'steak' however was NOT steak, it was some weird spongy meat product molded into the shape of a steak- seriously i could see the seams on the damn thing. I am not at all a snob about where I eat, and I'm not trying to pretend to be some elitist food critic but honestly I cant believe they serve that to people and no one else has taken notice of their weird reconstituted meat 'steak product'. Ive head microwave salisbury steaks that were better than that 'sirloin' they served us. Not cool applebee's. Not cool.."
Jeff T.,"Portage, MI",228,464,64,3.0,10/22/2012,"Poor Applebee's, getting such a bad rap.  Let me preface this quick review by saying I've been to an Applebee's in 3 different states and probably 12-15 different locations.  I used to go to one in GR about 3 times a week since it was close to my work and they gave us a punch card for freebies.  Anyhoot.  I really didn't see too many issues here.  Everything we asked for was given to us with a smile, even though our 18 month old was on the brink of destroying the place.  The food was decent, I had the french dip sliders, wife had the tomato soup, kid had the mac and cheese, and we all shared the spinach dip.  I really thought it was a solid 3 star performance."
David S.,"Madison, WI",3,2,,5.0,3/31/2013,"The 5-star rating is with regard to my overall time there, and reflective of the service.  I think people know what kind of food Applebees has and that rating the food is not of too much use here. I follow a strict vegetarian (""vegan"") diet, and I came here today after church on Easter.  My family (non-vegans) really wanted to go to Applebees.  The waiter was nice, friendly, talkative, had a good sense of timing with regard to checking in on us, and overall good-natured.  What is more, is that the moment I mentioned I needed advice on if I could construct a vegan item or if there were any options, he responded professionally and willing to help.  He retrieved his manager, and she was lovely.  Super nice, and understanding, even made a friendly note about how if I modify some entree they would compensate with extra veggies and make sure it ""tastes real good.""  I had mentioned I would be willing to do vegetarian if I had to, but she did not use that as an easy way out, which was very welcomed to see her trying to help me not have to break my diet choices.  I asked if any soups would work, and immediately she knew they had a chicken stock base [all of them], I appreciated it.  In the end, I ordered the Grilled Jalapeño-Lime Shrimp without the shrimp (i.e. flavored grilled veggies + white rice), and it was totally fine for a lunch item.  The veggies were fresh, crisp, and prepared with enough care, and the subtle flavors were refreshing. Nice portion size too.   On our way out, someone was holding the door open for us (this is common practice at Applebees I think), but rather than another employee it was actually the manager again.  She asked me how everything was, and I told her it was great and that I really appreciated her help.  I did.  People like to joke or complain about Applebees, but let me say that being someone who follows a diet like mine -- I am used to people not really caring too much about trying to help me figure things out.  I have not been treated as well as I was at this Applebees very often at other establishments.  Thanks guys, it was memorably positive.  This Applebees is a nice one."
Karen M.,"Gobles, MI",2,59,,1.0,10/12/2011,Had a long wait.... and the dinner was basically cold when we got it.  Had to send back the fries.  Not sure what the deal was.  It was not busy and we didn't order anything special.  Bad experience.
Ted P.,"Kalamazoo, MI",0,5,1,1.0,9/9/2010,"First of all, the waiter was basically nice. I feel kind of bad treating him poorly since the food sucked so bad. My girlfriend was correct that he did not make it so I made an effort to be nicer. The ONLY reason I would go to Applebees is because we had some gift cards to use up. I already knew what to expect from prior experiences. We got the trio of apps and a quesadilla burger. The apps of queso, dyno shrimp and wonton tacos: queso, meh; shrimp, where's the sauce?; tacos - not too bad. The burger was disgusting though. Again, what did I expect. The highlight was the beer and that they even left me a bit ticked since there was about 2 inches of no beer from the top."
Laura S.,"Kalamazoo, MI",0,13,,1.0,6/19/2008,"I have not yet experienced good service at any Applebees location.  One time, the server put in my party's order and forgot mine.  Another time, the waitress completely ignored us and we ended up getting drinks from the bartender.  Another time, my husband's order came out completely wrong (not at all what he ordered).  When we've complained, the management doesn't seem interested in making the situation better.  Skip it!"
