Beck C.,"Portsmouth, NH",114,79,10,5.0,1/23/2015,"There are two main visitor types at Applebee's during lunch: children and the elderly.  It's hilarious. Great lunch today with my hubby and our youngest.  They really cater well to families.  They have these dessert shooters now which are PERFECT for little ones.  Instead of a giant two-pound slice of pie, you can get a shooter filled with a few bites of something sweet after lunch."
Nick L.,"Durham, NH",0,2,,1.0,10/6/2017,"I honestly have no idea how this restaurant is even still in business. The margaritas tasted like water (which the bartender informed us of as he gave them to us), they took 40 minutes to get us our food (2 of the orders were wrong), burgers were all well done when requested they be medium rare, and the waitresses were nowhere to be found the entire time. Its like they weren't even trying. Do yourself a favor a go to one of the other 200 restaurants in the Seacoast, and save yourself the nausea and over priced frozen food."
Doug P.,"Wells, ME",36,83,11,4.0,1/21/2017,It's Applebee's.. they do a decent job with service.. food is always hot and cooked well.. we only visit this chain a lot because it's kid friendly and my daughters love the oriental chicken salad.
Alan B.,"Providence, RI",2,34,,4.0,10/15/2016,"I've been here 4-5 times in the last two months, since it's right around the corner from my work. Pretty decent atmosphere, clean, friendly waitstaff. The service is usually plenty attentive, though I tend to come in at off-peak hours. The food is good, pretty typical of what you would expect at an Applebee. I'd give the place 3.5 stars if I could: 4 star waitstaff and atmosphere and 3 star food. I'll probably keep coming back because of its convenient location."
Brie S.,"Somersworth, NH",13,5,2,1.0,3/30/2015,Waiter was inattentive and hovered as I tried to punch in my tip on our little computer thing.. I find that extremely unprofessional DO NOT COME HERE FOR LUNCH!
Nancy O.,"Portsmouth, NH",0,10,,3.0,9/24/2015,I would be Giving 5 stars for the bartender who made me laugh after a long day and provided amazing service!!   I have ordered takeout a few times on my way home from work or during lunch and I always wonder why the portions are so much smaller than when you eat in the restaurant??? Either serve the same entree size or charge less for take out.
J F.,"Poland, ME",0,10,,1.0,4/17/2016,The food was great the person who seated us was great.The waitress came twice to take the order and the bill I literally had to push a button to get a refill on a day they weren't busy and didn't get it until my meal was done.
Kate B.,"Cleveland, OH",403,386,161,5.0,4/21/2011,"I'm giving this Applebee's a rating of five by grading on an Applebee's curve. Meaning it's really good FOR AN APPLEBEE'S. But it's still AN APPLEBEE'S. But seriously, the service here is great. The people are really friendly & quick, from the hostess to the busboys to the manager who sometimes stops by to ask how things are going. The food is standard Applebee's fare, but I've never had anything awful or even bad, really. The Carside To-Go service is convenient & quick & again, friendly service.  If you feel like Applebee's, this isn't a bad one."
Gary C.,"Stratham, NH",2,1,23,1.0,2/22/2016,Went there with my wife and 4 kids. The food was bland and the carrots which came as a side for my daughters were so old from being in the fridge they were white and dry. The French onion soup was tasteless and very greasy from the mozzarella melted cheese on soggy bread. The Coke had no fizz. Won't be going back.
Melanie G.,"Lawrence, MA",0,2,,5.0,3/29/2015,"Love this Applebee's. was seated promptly, food was excellent, service was great, prices were reasonable, and the temperature was perfect. So I'm not sure how many people  notice the temperature in most restaurants? It is usually cold. not sure why I have to freeze threw a meal but not here which is a big deciding factor for me. Very family friendly"
Amar P.,"Newport, RI",36,124,20,3.0,10/19/2014,"Good service. They made me something vegetarian, please add veggie options to your menu."
Nicole W.,"York, ME",0,4,,1.0,1/26/2016,will never go back! food was horrible chicken ceaser salad was burned and my husband hamburger was over done french fries was burned. the service waitress was great!! this happened not once but twice!! horrible horrible!!!
Emily M.,"Corinth, VT",0,6,,5.0,1/23/2015,"I eat gluten free because I am sensitive to it and it's always a challenge eating in restaurants. Applebee's is one of those places that doesn't even have a designated GF menu, but if you know how to spot gluten, you can find a number of options that are virtually GF! I just ate here and had the Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken with Quinoa off their new ""Pub Diet"" and it was amazing! I also had the Sweet Potato Fries as an appetizer, the Green Goddess Salad Wedge as a side, a Shirley Temple for a drink, and a full size Hot Fudge Sundae for dessert. BEST GF MEAL! Thank you Applebee's! Also, the people are really nice at this location!"
Zoey D.,"Eliot, ME",0,4,,1.0,9/6/2015,Don't go to Applebee's to often. It is right around the corner and could be a great costumer and convenience. The sign says that you carry Amstel light. THEY DIDNT HAVE ANY!!!!!!! Don't advertise something that is not there. Also steak was over cooked and burned. No greetings when we came in. The waitress over used the term sorry. Needless to say we will not return. Overpriced for the quality received.
Jeff G.,"Portsmouth, NH",0,1,,4.0,12/29/2013,We ate here on Thursday night.  The service was great. I loved the chicken tenders.  It's nice to see how many items they now have under 550 calories.  The chicken salad had a bit too much dressing but was tasty.
Will P.,"Portsmouth, NH",643,322,1327,2.0,9/29/2012,"Nice people, really salty mediocre food Sorry but the new look does not improve the grubb."
Rachel G.,"Somersworth, NH",17,40,18,1.0,9/14/2010,"This place is lousy.  They have nothing vegetarian, you can get a salad where they take the meat off (but still charge you for it), or a pasta dish with the meat (and therefore any seasoning) removed. Don't waste your money."
Stephanie V.,"York, ME",41,326,132,5.0,12/10/2012,"Love, love, love the grilled shrimp on spinach. The dressing is fantastic. The shrimp is perfectly cooked. My family loved their pasta and chicken dinners as well. The ""choose 3"" appetizers was great! Service was impeccable as usual."
Wayne M.,"Portsmouth, NH",98,14,13,3.0,10/12/2009,"Applebee's in Portsmouth is just that. An Applebee's.  Food and service has never disappointed. Normally we start off our meal with the Sampler. Which has buffalo (or bbq) nuggets, Mozzarella Sticks, Spinach & Artichoke Dip, and Cheese Quesadilla Grande. Then we have whatever we feel like for meals. I normally go with one of the pick a few. So the 2 for $20.00 or the pick three. I got sliders, steak quesadilla towers, and some parmesan encrusted chicken fingers last time. It was fantastic. My friend got the Shrimp and parmesan steak and it was pretty tasty. All in all. Nothing to rave about but good food every time we go."
