Debbie K.,"Glendale, AZ",44,47,14,5.0,11/25/2017,"My husband and I enjoyed a late lunch. I had the original burger. I went with the side salad instead of fries. The side salad is good size with cherry tomatoes, romaine, bacon, large croutons, spinach.  All ingredients were fresh. The oriental vinaigrette dressing was delicious. The original burger comes with pickles, onions, tomato and lettuce.  The patty was juicy with an outer char. My husband said the 6oz steak was average. The cut of meat could have been better.  Broccoli and delicious loaded mashed potatoes were the sides. We are at the bar and enjoyed good service."
Nicole P.,"Tualatin, OR",38,3,,1.0,8/25/2017,"Terrible experience. I took my 3 kids there. A petite 12 year old girl and 9 and 11 year old boys. Not overweight kids by any means. They all order of the kids menu for ""super hungry"" kids aka the big kids.... When it comes I thought it was a joke. Their ""angus"" steaks looked like a piece of charcoal on a plate with 12 fries included. The stakes were literally half the size of a card deck.... it was what I would give to about a 3 year old child. And for $5.99---- if you take the kids to Red Robin or Texas Roadhouse they would get ATLEAST 3x to 4x more... hell, a kids meal for little kids from McD's would be drastically more.  I was mortified and so were my kids. I will NEVER go back. EVER."
Rachel H.,"Prescott Valley Units, Prescott Valley, AZ",41,2,,5.0,1/5/2018,"Eric was a wonderful server the staff was especially nice and the food was out in 12 minutes. I never had such great service at Applebee's before, I would recommend this place to everyone"
Rebecca H.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,3,1,5.0,1/2/2018,"I went in for some late night apps last week by myself after I got off work. I cannot remember my server's name but she was fabulous! For it being so late at night, she was so upbeat and attentive (I'm a server also, so I completely commend someone who is that positive when a late night one top comes in!) Wings were amazing as always. Great and welcoming service here"
Jaimie L.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",45,5,,2.0,10/31/2017,"Our expectations weren't any too high starting out, it is Applebee's after all. They managed to not even meet our minimal standards. Our waitress was annoyed by our presence. Long story short, food was subpar at best and it took about ten years to get it along with the check at the end. Bathroom was filthy and didn't look like it had been cleaned at any point in the past several months. Save yourself the hassle and find another with not great food."
Teena D.,"Prescott, AZ",1,4,,4.0,10/2/2017,My son and I come dine here for the Monday burger special after hiking Thumb Butte. The bacon cheeseburger is $6.99 and comes with fries. Our server Philip is attentive and the food is always prepared to perfection.
amanda r.,"Los Angeles, CA",98,30,,5.0,8/20/2017,"We came into town from the grand canyon to go to costco, and decided to stop for dinner. Mind you, this was the 3rd restaurant we walked into. It was originally my first choice since we dont have one out where we are, but i decided to try a local place. The first restaurant made us feel too young,  and then we were going to try augies. It was awful before we ever even got drinks... so applebees it was. I was a bit leery with all the bad service reviews, but the service and the food were great. The hostess and the waitress couldn't do enough to help us. If the other two local establishments were highly rated, I'm clueless as to what constitutes good service in prescott"
Karen B.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,6,1,5.0,8/25/2017,We went here for lunch yesterday and we had some of the best service. He was so friendly but not too friendly...if you know what I mean.  I just had to give this place 5 stars!
Vanessa H.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,2,,3.0,11/9/2017,Food was great.. Took a while for it to come out though.. Waitress was really nice. Would recommend
John R.,"Dewey-Humboldt, AZ",0,7,,1.0,8/6/2017,It took 30 minutes to get our meal which obviously sat under a heat lamp for 10 or 20 minutes based on how tough and dry our chicken was. The mac and cheese was missing one ingredient....cheese. The service was horrible. We wrote this place off years ago and now we remember why.  I'd give zero stars if I could.
Emma G.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,4.0,10/2/2017,"My service was great! And in the past my server at the time had made mistakes, but doesn't everyone? Welcome to being human! The servers and bartenders are mostly fantastic. And if my food was wrong, they checked on what happened and informed me they would bring out a new one! Customer service is amazing."
Sally E.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",18,18,,2.0,9/11/2017,"My kids and I went to Applebee's on Saturday the eighth of September. Was so disappointed, I had the fish and chips and a regular salad and my daughter had a chicken pasta dish with a salad, and my son chose three appetizers and salad. The waiter we had was great!!! I think his name was Al, he has the long gray hair. He was so attentive and friendly if the food wasn't so bad we would go back a lot just for his service!!! The salads came on a good size plate but the salad was the size of my palm, it has tiny cut up tomatoes and looked like bacon on the top. If I knew it had tomatoes and bacon  like that I would have asked them to not put them on. I just cleaned them off and ate my tiny salad. The next thing was the fish and chips, three pieces, good size but the breading on them made the fish taste and feel slimy. I took the breading off but the fish on the top was slimy. My daughters pasta dish had no flavor but she got a good amount and my son said his was alright but it was not the best. We have been to a lot of these restaurants and have not had a problem but we sure did this day, I was very disappointed I will not be going back. I hate to write this but it was true for us!"
Mary B.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,38,,2.0,12/10/2016,"My husband and I stopped in for a post-cinema meal at about 9.45 pm. The food was ok. The service was so bad it was almost funny. It WAS funny. The best part was when the server asked if we wanted dessert and in the middle of my husband's order she just walked away. When he finally did get it ordered, she brought it (ice cream) without a spoon and we did not see her again. My husband had to eat his ice cream with his water straw! Very funny - for me anyway! Entertainment notwithstanding, we won't be returning anytime soon."
David V.,"Flagstaff, AZ",18,7,,1.0,8/3/2017,"Unimpressed yet again. I like to places a few chances at redemption but I regret this one. Food was alright but as I said unimpressed. The service is pretty bad, even as I sit here on my phone writing this. We were seated directly under an air conditioning vent freezing us out. We requested to move just after ordering and were met with rolling eyes and no interest to accommodate. We moved our own drinks to a warmer table. We received our food promptly but had also within a minute after our check as well with a statement of ""of you need me let me know"" then had no other contact not even drink refreshers. We also paid the two dollars for the games at the table and they had reset the machine cancelling our games and leaving us with no way to pay. Needless to say we won't be back. Ever."
Jonathan S.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",39,9,1,1.0,11/4/2016,"We are watching a waiter smoke outside our window in front of the Restaurant. We got the bourbon chicken and shrimp that was covered in garlic butter 4 tiny shrimp. No bourbon taste at all. Two waitresses walked past my empty glass 6 times and it's not even busy. I hate eating out to experience lackluster food and poor service. I have to say watching them waitstaff smoke out front was the nail in their coffin though. I've had better food on an airplane. The waitress asked if we liked it but we stated it was not very good. At that point she asked if we wanted to talk to the manager but I just won't be eating here again, oh and the water tastes like plastic.....so wierd."
Khund S.,"Tempe, AZ",43,7,272,1.0,11/19/2016,Horrible food but great service! The fries were super salty and steak was not cooked right. Broccoli was over cooked. Never dinning at Applebee's again.
Mark H.,"Camp Verde, AZ",2,3,,5.0,7/14/2017,Took my family for the first time to Applebee's tonight. I am actually shocked at the bad reviews I see on here because our food was delicious. The staff were so friendly and helpful that in the end my wife and I decided to up the gratuity to 32%. That's a good tip for great food and service. My family and I plan on returning and we hope it will be just as good as it was this time!
David V.,"Prescott, AZ",0,7,,1.0,6/12/2017,"No reason to return. Gave it two attempts a month apart. Neither time was it busy. First visit had a horrible server. Second time, no less than 6 different employees attended to us, but it seemed like none of them could figure out if they were responsible for the table. Only really pleasant one was the greeter. Food took way too long to arrive, as did drink refills. Not a single decent item on the menu for non-meat folks ... except the crappy pasta dish sans chicken that cost more than $10, and sized more like a kids meal.  Several better choices in the area."
K H.,"Prescott, AZ",0,12,,1.0,2/11/2016,Food is very mediocre but the reason for this review is my wife ordered Piña colada. She then stated it's the worst she ever had in her life. I then advised the manager who advised me that he is aware and advised they are pre-packaged Piña colada's 8 dollars for pre-packaged Piña colada's.  What type of place serves PRE-PACKAGED PINA COLADA'S ?  goes to show the quality of Applebees they spend all there money on advertisements not the food or alcohol expect everything you eat and drink to be very low quality
Melissa F.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",10,8,3,1.0,8/24/2016,"Horrible service! Sat at bar and thought the bartender was on drugs. She was acting like she was going to fall asleep. TOO MANY TIMES BAD SERVICE AT BAT AND WONT GO BACK. Also manager looked like a total dick!!!Use to love thus place, sooooooo down hill. Use to love now me and my boyfriebd will never return. Also will spread word of how awful it is with service."
Andrea M.,"Flagstaff, AZ",18,9,2,1.0,12/30/2016,"Today we took my grandmother to Applebee's due to her 91 birthday being a few days ago. I cam up from Phoenix and met my dad and grandmother there when they opened. We here the 2nd set of people in the restaurant. It had just opened, manager was vacuuming and I had to walk past him in order to get to the bathroom. Our waiter finally took our order and brought or beverages. Eventually he took our order. Simple 2 burgers and wings and onion rings. By the time the food finally came we were nothing but disappointed. All my 91 yr old grandma wanted that day was a burger, she got a hard bun over done burger and wouldn't eat it. My dad never got his onion rings and didn't like his over cooked boneless chicken wings. He said he would take them home for the coyotes, maybe they would eat them. After waiting another 10 minutes for our check we left. I then had to take grandma somewhere else to get lunch. Thanks Applebee's"
Melissa F.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",2,8,,1.0,7/24/2016,"Went last night. Bartwnder was horrible, no personality at all. My drink had no alcohol and he never asked if it was ok. Won't be going back anytime soon. Manager seemed like he was rude as well!!"
Kelly H.,"Laughlin, NV",34,11,4,1.0,6/7/2015,"Horrible service, server looks like she is moving in slow motion. The staff and management is running around as if overwhelmed however there were only 5/25 tables seated. Margarita tasted like moldy rotten skunk dishwater. Ordered a burger that had toppings, came out with meat and cheese only. This is not the first time that I have had a less than acceptable experience at this Applebee's location. I will not be back. Thank you"
Terri B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,21,,4.0,6/3/2016,The happy hour appetizers were good and the margaritas were just a little too sweet but the service from Cam was awesome. Thanks Cam you helped make our meet up group's happy hour fun.
April R.,"Mililani, HI",93,65,24,4.0,3/25/2016,We enjoyed the food here. We got the 2 for $20 what a great deal. There was also 1/2 off appetizers... We will be back here again when we are vacationing in Prescott. Great service too
Marvin C.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",0,5,,5.0,12/1/2016,This place has really changed.  It is so much better.  They are remodeling and have a much better staff.  I  go there a lot.  Usually sit at the bar where the people are friendly and the bartender Jason is always happy to mix up whatever you want.  Best bartender in town in my opinion.  He normally works weekends and I usually go in on Sundays because it's slower paced and I can enjoy the company.  They have new beers on tap too.  The menu has changed and the hand cut steaks are great.  I just explain how much pink I want and let them tell the cook rather than just saying medium ect.  I  seen the bad reviews and I have seen some of the old staff but this place is getting better all the time.  Still some hiccups but I go to have fun and not to look for a bad time.  Hope you enjoy this place too.
S C.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,20,,5.0,1/8/2016,"Dani was our server. She was very kind, attentive, patient with my complicated order, and always on top of it. Love this applebees. It was nice to see a new working face in there."
Roddy B.,"Prescott, AZ",9,164,323,3.0,12/3/2014,"I have to give credit where credit is due. Went back with a group, but not because I wanted to. The service at the bar from Breanna was very attentive and super friendly. Orders were correct. No extended waits. The various promotional food and drink items were very low priced. Unlimited fries that were very good. Desserts were very good too. Restrooms were fine. I guess I won't dread my next visit. Let's hope it stays this good."
Chandra S.,"Stanton, TX",8,19,4,1.0,11/8/2014,"I debated about the star level on this review for a bit. The service was great! Lisa was pleasant and attentive. When we had an issue, Chris took care of it. The good, however, is far outweighed by the bad. My husband's burger had longer hair than me. The tortilla on my wrap was rubbery. The Blondie he had was tasty but it was too little too late. I read another review where someone found a hair.. shake I didn't check before we went. It's been a year or so since I've been to Applebee's and it week me longer before I go back. Shame."
Barbara F.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",0,2,,5.0,2/27/2016,"I love this Applebee's because it is truly a neighborhood restaurant and bar. I love that the staff knows my name: Jason, Cameron, Breanna, Hannah are all ver personable and friendly and make me feel special. The food is excellent and their is always a new entree to try! The management always takes time to visit: Holly, John, Teresa, and Drew are very professional"
Anastasia F.,"Prescott, AZ",28,21,9,1.0,6/10/2014,"I can't give zero stars. This place is awful.  And apparently we are stupid because we keep coming back. But I can't remember the last time they got my order right. Or the last time the food actually tasted good. Not to mention THE FREAKING HAIR MY HUSBAND FOUND IN HIS FOOD.  Never going back. Ever. Seriously, I'm not picky. This place just actually sucks."
Mrs R.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",21,30,6,2.0,8/13/2016,"Went for lunch here today with my husband because we both like the Oriental chicken salad.  Well, we were handed our salads before our silverware and drinks.  So we sat there just waiting for the rest until I waved down the seating hostess and asked her for our utensils and drinks.  She was kind.  Our server proceeded to move the furniture around us to vacuume under the tables while we ate.  Also, had to ask for dressing to go atop the salads. My husband said the men's room smelled like urine, tile falling off the wall and very dirty.  This is sad... this place used to be a lot better.  Maybe a change in management?"
Jana M.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",2,4,,5.0,5/16/2016,We had the new fire grilled steaks yesterday. They were delicious. Our server was very friendly and helpful.
Woody W.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",28,7,,5.0,9/5/2015,This place is great. Burger night every Monday. PBR special and great menu. Great service.  I really love this Applebee's
Melanie E.,"Prescott, AZ",54,7,3,1.0,1/21/2015,Your hometown Applebee's has terrible quality. Service is very slow. You wait 15 minutes for drink refills. The food is of poor quality. Fries are over salted. Entrees are very low grade. Management does not instill good customer service skills to their servers. I don't know why I even go back...
Desert R.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",0,87,2,4.0,12/10/2014,"We had the 2 for $25 meals and were pleasently supprised.  The meals were serrved hot, not warm which made a real hit.   We were a little hesitant based on other reviews but did not find anything negative there.  Our server was a student, really frendly and provided great service.  We will have no hesitantancy about going back again...."
Dave L.,"Prescott, AZ",0,1,,1.0,4/22/2015,"Service so-so. Food was edible, but not prepared well. Wait was over an hour. Then, they brought me the wrong lunch combo. Ten minutes later, they brought me the right item I had ordered. Then, the bill was inaccurate, I told our waiter who said it was correct. Then, I said to him, give me menu and I'll show you. He said I will get the menu and SHOW YOU! (me). I pointed out where he was wrong and to make a long story shorter -  this place is ugly. Long waits, rude waiters, lousy service, and the food wasn't that good. I'll not go back."
D J.,"Prescott, AZ",0,34,6,1.0,9/12/2015,"This was the worst meal ever! After waiting over an hour we got nachos! I guess if you want nachos go to a Mexican restaurant! Ours had burned chips and no cheese on it for 10.29. We talked to the waitress, who was wonderful, and she got us a different order of nachos. There was a tablespoon of meat and 1 chip had cheese on it! It was piled high with lettuce so they had the appearance of being a large order. I don't ever want to go back!"
Tara B.,"Fallbrook, CA",25,72,12,1.0,11/26/2015,"Linda....what a ray of sunshine...NOT! A needed a few more minutes and told her to go ahead and put my husband's order in first. We had ordered our child's meal as soon as we sat down since we hadn't eaten since breakfast. When I said I needed a few more minutes, she rolled her eyes! What adult does that? She's lucky she got a tip at all! 10% was being generous and that was only because it was Thanksgiving, not her birthday. We had to ask for refills, a box, and our check. I'm not sure that she even checked on us once. Now, let's talk about the food. Mediocre at best. Everyone's fries were cold. My husband's brisket enchiladas were pretty good. I ordered appetizers. The sirachi shrimp were good, but the chicken wonton tacos were not. I ate them, but only because we hadn't eating since breakfast, we'd been hiking, and it was Thanksgiving so I knew I wasn't going to be eating again anytime tonight. When we gave her the money for the bill, which included her gracious 10% tip she looked over at our table and glared at us. Some nerve. We should have asked for our change and only left her a penny! Management must really suck at this place. We saw workers with their hats all sideways, looking like gangsters, and the hostess half laying down while standing at the hostess stand. As a former food service worker, this would have been completely unacceptable at any of the establishments that I had bartended or waited tables at. Applebee's sucks and I won't be going back to another one, ever! I'm also sending this message to Applebee's on their website. The owners need to know."
Mary C.,"Mayer, AZ",0,4,,1.0,1/10/2016,"The service was absolutely horrible, the food took an hour and a half to come. My drink was empty for about a half hour before the waitress bothered to come check on us. I then notice that she had been out back smoking I usually leave pretty good tips but I only gave this lady a dollar which she didn't even deserve"
