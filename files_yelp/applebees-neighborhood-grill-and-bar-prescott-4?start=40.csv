Ian J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,2,1.0,3/1/2014,Just because it comes on a plate doesn't mean you should eat it. The waiter had a cool mustache. $50 for bad food. Not worth it.
Kathy R.,"Prescott, AZ",0,21,,1.0,10/30/2014,"We have tried this place three times over a 4 month period. Each time the service is either poor or nonexistent. Last Sunday we went in for lunch and sat at the bar in the hope that the service would be better. The restaurant was less than half full with only  four other people at the bar. Sat there for six minutes and never saw the bartender. Two different servers came behind the bar to pick up glasses, looked at us sitting there empty handed, and went on their way. We walked out. I asked to speak to the manager and after waiting four minutes on her to show up, I finally left. When you can get it, the food isn't that great anyway."
Dharma B.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",0,48,5,2.0,11/26/2014,"I so badly want to have a good experience here, I really do.  The atmosphere is comfortable, and the waitstaff is really friendly and nice.  But the management is so lacking, every time.  Even when it's not crowded there are many unbussed tables, so the hostess needs to run back and clear one off, but the others stay unclean throughout our visit.  This should not be something the hostess has to do.  Please hire more people!  Last night another waitstaff mistakenly grabbed my entrée from the kitchen for their table, so our waiter was very apologetic and resubmitted the order, and it took another 10 minutes to be served while my friends felt awkward eating without me.  Their women's restroom often badly need attention too.  Honestly, their food is quite good, their drink selection is great, and there is a wide variety overall.  I think their issues could be solved simply by hiring a few more people."
Cindie B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,23,1,1.0,6/30/2014,"So here's the deal with the ""all you can eat"" soup and salad for lunch...... you order, it takes forever to be served. You order more, and it takes a good 20 to 30 minutes to get it. The service is SO SLOW that you really only get one serving of the soup and salad. Not worth it. We've been there 3 times, just to be fair before writing a review, and it's the same every time. There's really no excuse for not bringing the all you can eat items out in a timely fashion. We're not going back."
James C.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",0,7,2,1.0,8/24/2014,"When we first sat down, Lindsay took our drink order - there's nothing special about ice water without lemon ... However, apparently the request of NO lemon was lost on her ... when I asked for another water w o lemon, she simply brought me back the same water out of which she had simply plucked the lemon wedge - with floating lemon particles still in the water! Do people seriously think the taste of lemon is no longer in the water?!? The all-you-can-eat ribs was certainly not worth the wait. They took almost as long each time to come out as the first time, not to mention I was never asked which flavor I wanted. I stopped asking for more simply because I was tired of waiting so long.  Another portion of our food came out stone cold. Lindsay refused to touch the food to test the temperature, claiming it would violate her status as a vegetarian. Good grief ... Overall the food was edible (for the most part), but the service was horrible and severely lacking. When we complained about the temperature of the food, no manager ever showed up to our table. Definitely NOT worth the time or money."
Mike V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,21,,1.0,1/16/2015,The service was terrible. It took about 10 minutes to get a beer. Then another 20 minutes to get someone to take my order. The food was mediocre. Then to top it all off some guy comes up to me and asks me if I have taken Jesus Christ as my lord and savior. I don't want to be bothered by that whole I'm enjoying my drink. Not sure if this resteraunt allows this type of behavior but it happened. Needless to say I will never be returning to this establishment
Kari D.,"Camp Verde, AZ",49,92,,2.0,12/14/2010,"I know, not very imaginative!! We were out Christmas shopping, it was convenient, and we didn't want anything to heavy.  The hubby and I both got the all you can eat soup and salad. I like this because you can order a different soup and salad every refill.  It was nothing special, exactly what you would expect from Applebee's."
Sarah S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",12,82,18,2.0,5/8/2012,I know what to expect here and that's why i go. Over happy service but decent most of the time. terrible mixed drinks. Just stick with beer or wine. and food that is hot from the microwave and over seasoned to hide the spoil.
Barbara H.,"Prescott, AZ",0,2,,2.0,12/28/2013,"12/28/2013   Very slow lunch service .  Don't know if the problem was in the kitchen or because of understaffing waitresses/waiters.  A mild complaint to the pretty blonde (manager?) who strolled by asking ""how was everything""?  brought no results. Maybe she needs to pitch in and help out when one waitress is serving one large section and getting behind. And oh yes,  we were celebrating a birthday but there was no birthday dessert offered.  Oh well.  Maybe times are tough for appleby's."
Thelma W.,"Casa Grande, AZ",1,4,,4.0,5/12/2013,Love this place. Our server was Steven and he was great. The food is always great and the staff is friendly.
Herkemer F.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",2,37,3,1.0,9/26/2013,"Lackluster service, bland food, ordered med rare steak was cooked med well. Yawn!"
Mike S.,"San Diego, CA",0,20,4,4.0,5/21/2013,"We were staying in downtown Prescott the last few days and got back late last night to find that all the food in downtown Prescott was closed at ~9pm. We ended up finding this Applebee's ""open late"" we were very thankful! Our server was great, food was standard Applebee's food, we enjoyed our meals and drinks!"
Fred B.,"Chicago, IL",7,59,142,2.0,11/20/2012,why are we reviewing an Applebe's ? If you want a beer and a salad and nothing good is open you go to Applebee's
Sonja K.,"Chino Valley, AZ",0,11,,1.0,4/23/2013,"Been there  many times, but today the drinking glasses were NASTY and FILTHY. When I mentioned it to the Manager she gave me some story about hard water, but hard water stains don't come off with a wet paper napkin! If they have a problem with the Dishwasher maybe they could hand wash the glasses, it's been done before! No wonder they only have a  Star Rating! I hate dirty Restaurants!!!!"
