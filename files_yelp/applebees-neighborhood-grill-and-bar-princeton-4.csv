Rick W.,"Green Cove Springs, United States",2,18,2,3.0,21/6/2010,"Food was ok as expected, but was very dissappointed with dessert, brownie was stale and did not taste good."
Deb W.,"Princeton, United States",1,7,,4.0,6/9/2009,"Just ate at Applebee's yesterday evening. The food was good, our server was delightful, and the desserts were to die for. I've known this Applebee's to go through some years of having really delicious food and some where the quality dropped way down, so I was glad to see they're cookin' good these days."
