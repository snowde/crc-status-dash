Olivia T.,"Boston, MA",1,1,,5.0,10/5/2017,"Applebees... the dollar margarita one stop shop.  After a very busy night and one bartender quit during this shift in front of the entire bar, we met Lindsey. An awesome bartender/ server who really stepped up her game in the busiest month of the year. She was kind, honest and had a wonderful attitude throughout the the entire night. We really appreciated her service.  Also a nod to Kristen the other bartender who really put in the work to keep the service bar afloat. Thank you. We had a great time.  Barbera, You were wonderful. With the stress of three teams playing in one night and the short staff that you had, we commend you for your leadership and hospitality.  All in all, we as guests understand the industry and how challenging it can be. Thank you for a wonderful night!"
Einar H.,"Quincy, MA",3,31,4,1.0,9/14/2017,"My wife and I stopped in on a Saturday night around 6PM. We were seat in less then two minutes. Then we sat there for almost 20 minutes just starring at the menus. And no wait staff even came by at all to find out if we wanted anything to drink! Then another couple were seated right behind us. The waitress came right up to them took there drink orders and got them for them while we sat there with nothing at all!  So I said to my wife. We are out of here! Then on our way out the door the hostess asked if we enjoyed everything! And I said not here! Applebee's is now on our ""C"" list as in SEE YOU NEVER AGAIN!!!    This chain of places has never impressed me at all. I was a Chef for almost 30 years and I never have seen service this bad!!  Like I tell everyone when you find a good restaurant you tell your friends and family. And when find a bad restaurant you tell everybody!"
Jess M.,"Cambridge, MA",43,257,31,2.0,8/13/2017,"Service was great, but everything else was mostly disappointing. I got steak, green beans, ""shrimp topper,"" and mashed potatoes. We also got spinach and artichoke dip. Our dip was super late and the waitress told us that it was given to the wrong table. She handled it super well and got us chips and salsa and brought the dip out later plus didn't charge us for either. Salsa was really good, spinach and artichoke dip was okay. Most of my entree was cold, except for the mashed potatoes (which are fantastic!) I ordered my steak medium and got it very very well done. Inedible. I said something and our waitress offered to get me something else but since I already ate everything else and was full I asked for a chicken breast to go. She ended up throwing in sides to make it a full entree, so that was super thoughtful. Yeah and the ladies room was very very gross and I stepped in pee. Yum. Summary- go somewhere else."
Young P.,"Boston, MA",224,346,388,3.0,9/22/2017,"Your average Applebee's. Nothing fancy, just average in terms of food, service, and just overall experience. Monday - Burger Night ($6.99) Wed - Steak Dinner Night ($10.99)"
Anhthu M.,"Dorchester, MA",0,20,33,5.0,7/25/2017,"We come to this Applebee's location quite often, about twice a month on average. The food has been consistent although the service can be a hit or miss if you get any of the new waitresses (more often miss). However, Angela, the bartender is a gem. She is friendly, fun and quick and she knows us.  The bacon wedged iceberg lettuce, spinach artichoke dip, boned in chicken wings, and molten chocolate lava cake with ice cream are always among our top choices."
Giovanni F.,"Readville, MA",165,11,,1.0,10/25/2017,"This is absolutely the worst Apples bees. The manager, Barbara refused service to me and my to family members stating that she would not service us because we smelled like alcohol. I was not drinking, but we are black.  People like her are ruining the world. Absolutely, my worst experience at an food establishment."
Dominique N.,"Rockland, MA",0,3,,1.0,10/3/2017,"My friends and I just went to this location because we saw that it was $1 margaritas for the month of October. We went to the bar and said ""three $1 margaritas"" the bartender replied ""okay 3 perfect margaritas"" and served us. She neglected to tell us that the perfect margaritas weren't $1 they were $9.50 each. Completely mislead us. Do not go here. Very sleezy."
Jessica T.,"Norwell, MA",0,14,6,2.0,7/18/2017,"When people say, ""they don't make em' like they used to,"" I'm sure they are referring to Applebee's. We only came here for their old chicken finger baskets and they are now hard, crispy chicken crusts. Slow service, bizarre mix of food, and poor quality just about sums it up. The mozzarella sticks were basically cheese sticks rolled in salt, the steak was salty and soggy (not sure what that was about), and I was very confused by the gourmet/pub style plates. I almost died of dehydration on the drive home. On the bright side, you can pay the bill at the table with the least possible tip and run away within 3 minutes."
Kimberly A.,"Boston, MA",321,374,,5.0,1/18/2017,I usually come here later at night because I often work the late shift at work and this is one of the few places in the area that are actually open by the time I get off. The menu is pretty good sized and there's always something for everyone on it. The service is always quick and the waitstaff is very friendly. The food is very good for a chain restaurant. They offer select appetizers at half price after 9 PM so sometimes I will opt for some appetizers as a meal. Their mozzarella sticks are a good choice and the marinara sauce that comes with them is tasty. If you want dessert but don't have room for anything big they do offer brownie bites which are a mini version of a brownie sundae and it hits the spot. This is a nice family restaurant so if you are wanting to get out with family and are looking for a place to go this is a very good option.
Deige A.,"Brockton, MA",28,124,380,2.0,7/29/2016,"Customer service itself was good but let's get to the food. Now usually when you see a lot of menu items, it's a good indicator that some of the food is frozen and simply reheated. That's fine, it's a chain restaurant what do you really expect?. I had the ordered the new menu item: Mac and cheese. This was honestly terrible, tastes straight frozen; you could taste that ice melt. My steak? Absolutely no flavor or juice even with it beginning cooked medium well. This is my third time all together trying Applebee's as a chain and probably my last time"
Amr S.,"Quincy, MA",79,6,,4.0,3/2/2017,"I like this restaurant because of its location and price. The food quality is good, but sometimes the service is bad. It really depends on who is serving you. Overall a good option for a quick dinner plans with decent prices."
Baldemar R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",102,151,127,4.0,5/18/2017,Came here for the first time ever..wow what a deal 2 for 20..salad was great and I got a chicken pasta dish that was also great..it's currently 93 outside and this location has great AC..will come back
Ashley A.,"Allston, MA",191,169,404,4.0,3/26/2016,"Bar food is predictable, maybe on the smaller side but for the price it's reasonable. I got the combo: a combination of honey pepper chicken fingers with onion soup and fries. Since it's the first time I had the soup, I was not crazy about the look of the bread, but if you make it through that layer the soup is ok. The sauce on the wings is definitely particular, if you have a sweet tooth and like fried chicken then this is the dish for you. The best part was the Perfect Margarita in strawberry flavor. Strong, and for two drinks I would say the $9 is definitely on the extremely cheap. I may go again just for the Perfect Margarita -and I don't even like regular margaritas like that."
Robert V.,"Hingham, MA",9,60,,5.0,8/7/2017,Ive ate some meals here and I must say the new menu is a big improvement.  The staff is very nice.  The chicken dish I had was packed with flavor and the wood fired grill is a nice change.  The beer is ice cold and delicious.  They have about 10 taps which is adequete.  They make a good cocktail.  I see a lot of negative reviews and I can see why.  Despite the improvements some of the customers are not the best.  In applebees defense these customers giving two star ratings wouldnt know good food if it hit them in the ass.  There idiots and people should know applebees is on the comeback trail.  I give it two thumbs up
Jeanie T.,"Quincy, MA",43,34,12,3.0,10/27/2015,"Applebees definitely got better after their renovation a few years ago. My girlfriends and I only come here because it's close by with a parking lot. They also sell pitchers of sangria for cheap. The only down side is that it's so watered down it just tastes like juice after. Applebees like to fill their pitcher up with ice first then add wine which is probably why it's only $15 dollars for it. As if that's not enough, they add ice to your glass as well.   Food is mediocre and nothing special but for a quick cheap meal during girl talk, I really don't mind it. I also didn't mind that time when the cops were called because a guy was doing crack on the men's toilet. That's the most exciting thing that's happened to me on a Friday night for a while.  Before you leave, remember to order a dessert! They have a pretty good selection and it's soooo good! Even if you're too full to have dessert, they offer brownie bites for $1.29 and it comes with a small scoop of ice cream. Trust me, you won't regret it. Oh yeah, they also have a new kiosk on each table where you can split the bill evenly with your group and pay with your credit card without having to wait for your server to hand you the bill during busy hours. So convenient. Oh, technology these days......"
Nancy C.,"Key West, FL",6,168,95,5.0,2/23/2017,Tried it again. Burger was delicious and the mashed potatoes were awesome! I'm glad to see they finally got some more knowledgeable and friendly waitstaff. Miranda is an awesome additional to this restaurant. Keep up the great work! Anxious for the summer menu.
Jonathan B.,"Weymouth, MA",1,20,,1.0,11/13/2016,"I've been here a few times and the food was horrible on every visit.  On the last visit the food, my usual for coming here on Veteran's Day,  All American Bacon cheeseburger with fries,  gave me diarrhea from hell.  I ordered the burger well done and it was no where near well cooked.  It was very greasy, and it didn't get served by the waitress, but the cook, which I thought was strange.   You would think on Veteran's day the food would be better than usual, but it was the opposite.  I guess you really do get what you pay for, here anyway.    So in conclusion, three strikes and you're out.   I will never dine here again."
Jill M.,"Quincy, MA",0,3,,4.0,9/1/2017,"I eat here a lot with my family. The key is to understand that this is a chain family restaurant and that you should not explect a gourmet dining experience. So... get the chowda, a salad, burger, or something hard to mess up. If you get a ""steak"" be prepared to send it back because it's overcooked. Drinks are fine, waitstaff is way more competent than most, manager is wonderful. 'Nuff said."
Noelle P.,"Dorchester, Dorchester, MA",0,1,,5.0,3/26/2017,Frank Barbara. And Jen are amazing !!!  Frank and Barbara are very considerate of their patrons and they care and want to make sure that the experience is one that will bring them back !!!     Barbara today was understaffed when we first walked in and she was great at accommodating and even waiting the tables at the same time to make everyone's experience a good one !!  Frank came over and asked us how everything was cause he remembered us from before and he was very welcoming as always smiles and friendly !!!     Jen our waitress we have had many times and each time she is amazing!! Smiling making conversations and she is amazing with children she plays with them and jokes around !!! She has a great personality and our children love having her when we go here !!! Keep up the great work. Food is amazing as well.
Wendy H.,"Braintree, MA",0,12,,1.0,10/27/2017,"Not my idea to come here so here is the review. We got seated right away and it took about a long 5 minute for a waitress to come take our order. Came here with two other people so we got an order of boneless buffalo chicken and three entrees. I went to the bathroom  after putting our orders in and I see our waitress texting on her phone. A different waitress brought out our boneless chicken appetizer. The celery sticks had dirt on it. No one brought us plates to share the appetizer. Then two of our entree came and guess what? A different waitress brought it out. Then I saw our waitress came out of the bathroom. To remind you, it takes awhile out food to be cooked and that was how long she has been in there on her phone. She came over to our table and ask if all the food came and we told her one entree is missing. She went to check and said someone gave our entree to another table. Of course because you were in the bathroom for 15+ minutes. All in all, worst customer service ever, food is nasty, and this place smells awful."
Bill W.,"Quincy, MA",0,2,,1.0,6/16/2017,"If I could give zero stars, I would. I just left there at 9pm, June 16, 2017, and have to say you have the absolute rudest barmaid I've ever encountered. When she's not gossiping with the locals, she's bad-mouthing her fellow employees. I'm sure no one at this establishment cares enough to address me or her about her rotten attitude and general laziness. I never rate restaurants. I either like the food or I don't. If I don't, I just don't go back. I liked my burger, but given the hostile environment your barmaid wants to create in this particular restaurant, I will never return. Isn't it her good fortune that she was born white. Shame on her for her comments about people who work at Applebees, but don't look like her."
Amber C.,"Milton, MA",0,15,,1.0,3/22/2017,"Awful service. Our credit card information got stolen and we had to deal with fraud charges all because our waitress put our card on the wrong table. When Applebee's gave us a gift card as a sorry we ordered take out. They then got our take out order wrong. We called back and we're told we wouldn't be able to get refunded unless we drove back to the restaurant. I'm sorry, we have to go out of our way for your multiple mistakes? And deal with filing fraud charges because your waitress wasn't trained properly?? Awful awful service."
Weronika W.,"Quincy, MA",60,72,21,1.0,5/30/2016,"Awful service !!!i asked for gluten free menu since I am celiac .ordered food like I was supposed to .asked for appetizer that was on the menu list .got wrong appetizer ,food was not completely cooked -grilled veggies were raw and looked like they out them on a grill for less then a minute .server Kristen didn't even care about checking on us and food .my food that was supposed to be gluten free wasn't ,now I  gonna have to deal with my reaction to it .never again !"
Clifford J.,"Manhattan, NY",296,37,42,3.0,8/10/2015,I have been to many Applebee's in my time on earth and this is just like the rest. There wasn't anything that stood out to me other than the new menus!  I think the only thing that stood out to me as better than the others was the waitress that I had serving me. She was cracking jokes and making me feel welcome. I came in an hour until closing so I was unsure about the response I'd have from the staff but it was definitely pleasant.  This Applebee's has half-priced appetizers (select kinds) after 9:00pm (if you order a beverage). We came for the apps! I ordered mozzarella sticks and boneless buffalo wings and a margarita and my check came to less than 20 dollars. The apps were less than $10 total! It is a great deal if you don't want to spend too much money on a full dinner at another restaurant. I loved my experience here and would definitely come back again.
Tiger S.,"Boston, MA",297,19,3,5.0,1/15/2016,"This is a great place to bring your family to. Friendly service, good food, and great prices. I also enjoy coming here to catch a game in the bar area. They run many specials from half priced apps to drink specials. Come on Mondays for their burger specials that won't break the bank. Their desserts rock too! The Crackerjack Banana Cheesecake is a must try!"
Helen S.,"Braintree, MA",9,11,565,1.0,10/11/2015,"I also have appetizer went so wrong it had stuff in my sauce like someone had dipped into it.Then i sent the sauce back for a new one but ive then order a  burger and it had 3 hairs in my burger and the second time it happened again, not only i didn't eat the food I've notice my waitress disappeared for a very long time .This just means the kitchen was not clean and needed to be mentioned to the manager, cause it's disgusting and how unclean my food was 3 times in a row. To the Applebee's company if u manage to stay in business please be aware of the message to this , if u want to stay in business. Cause u just lost a customer and I do yelp on the restaurants that needs improvements. You will never see us again that's the message."
Heather B.,"Dorchester, MA",0,14,,4.0,9/10/2016,"Always excellent burgers but in my opinion, fries are always dried out but my bf likes them. When you have a to go order, the process is easy and they give you a lot of fries. The customer service is always good but the steak is so so SO bad, I compare it to a dog toy; tough with no flavor at all! If I stick with the burgers, I'll be happy with this Applebee's. Their sangria's are very good too."
Stef R.,"Boston, MA",2,10,2,3.0,1/6/2016,"I like this place a lot although is part of a chain ,I feel what set them apart is the customer service and the nice atmosphere. Went here with my elders and my teen kids ,our waitress Charlene was wonderful, very patient with my handicap mother and their new menu is really good."
Julia R.,"Quincy, MA",1,5,,1.0,7/20/2016,"The food is terrible.  I ordered chicken and got a piece of rubber.  The waiter apologized, saying many customers had similar complaints about the chicken!  The service is terrible. On another occasion, the waitress sat down at the table to take our order.  The appetizer should be called 'heart attack on a plate""; full of grease.   Even the woman at the bar couldn't make a decent drink.  My drink was mostly water.  Gave this place a few tries but that's it.  Won't be coming back."
Moumita B.,"Quincy, MA",65,109,54,3.0,7/26/2015,"Everything here is kind of average, not the best neither the worst. The cocktails just dont have that extra kick or taste which would make me say YUM .. the food too were okayish in taste. Can be visited again though, as this a late night spot."
Anderson V.,"Quincy, MA",6,1,,1.0,10/31/2015,"My first time was lovely, but on the second time the waitress got angry at us because she didn't understand the order of the other couple, but she didn't understand mine either. I asked for 2 plates of steak with mash potatoes and I didn't know what to add to the mash, so in the end I decided to have french fries added as the second side for both plates.. She misunderstood, she thought I said no mash and only french fries. I told her the plate was wrong and she got angry at me telling me I asked for 4 sides of fries.... She ended up making the mash for me, but I got home I ended up with diarrhea. The whole time she was talking to us she sounded upset as if our table was treating her badly, but we keep saying please and thank you, I guess she just hated us because we were different perhaps, we tried to be nice but she even mocked us twice."
Robert H.,"Quincy, MA",90,678,959,2.0,5/31/2014,"Well, the mozz sticks were ok anyway."
Jesse M.,"Milton, MA",80,3,,3.0,10/16/2015,Went the other day friendly service and really enjoyed the food and drinks. I recommend the $5 burgers which is every Monday night it's a really good deal
Keisha W.,"Boston, MA",2,6,3,4.0,4/14/2014,I just went there with my family after church and for me it was great. The waitress was Tiama so if you get her you're in for great service. She was attentive about getting me what I wanted even when my first and second choices weren't available. She made sure to get EVERYTHING we ordered in complementary order so we really enjoyed our meal. It was quiet so noise level was none and her section was small and the party she had left and even with that she tried to make sure we were ALWAYS comfortable. Plus the management was gracious from door to floor and helped clean and do what was necessary. I used to be a waitress so yes these are things I look for but nonetheless expect as a regular paying guest and treating my server with the same respect I want to get. So that being said go for the $5 burgers cause theres pretty decent and enjoy some time out with whoever you're with.
Rara A.,"Boston, MA",40,4,2,1.0,3/16/2015,"I wish I can give NO stars!!! My waitress Sarah had the worst customer service ever. I had to keep asking for help because she never came and checked on us and had the worst attitude. Told manager of course he did nothing and didn't even apologize for the service. NEVER GOING BACK, THANKS FOR THE EXPERIENCE!!"
Patti M.,"Boston, MA",5,7,,5.0,2/28/2015,"I sat at the Quincy Applebee's on Saturday night, and could not believe Angela the bartender could handle the volume of customers at the restaurant. This girl needs a raise!"
Stacie B.,"South Boston, Boston, MA",9,24,60,5.0,7/9/2013,"In Applebees we only eat wings with Perfect Margarita and Stefanie (hopefully spelling is right) makes it a bomb!!! If you sit at the bar you will get the best service ever. The amount of margarita is more than enough for me to get tipsy, plus you can always watch a game. Since it is not far from my residence , it makes it best choice for casual night."
Brooke W.,"Boulder, CO",2,34,10,2.0,8/8/2012,"I've been to this Apple Bees many a time for drinks... although the sangria is pretty weak it is delicious. The food is not appetizing. What is more I found a piece of plastic in my burnt fiesta lime chicken yesterday. This is one of their signature meals labeled with ""'you'll be back' taste"".... supposedly. The rice was dry, the pico de gallo was more like chopped unripened tomatos. I hate to say it but the tortilla strips were the best part of the meal! Also my friend who is vegetarian was with me and brought to my attention that there aren't any legitimate/hearty vegetarian options, even the salads are topped with meat. EDIT: Despite my unhappy review above, a friend of mine holds a special place in her heart for Applebees and got me to tag along for dinner recently. She and I both got an Asian crispy chicken salad. I never thought I would be saying this but it was so delicious. Alas, I add a star to my review."
Lauren F.,"Quincy, MA",1,14,,1.0,6/14/2015,"Had a bad experience!  The server gave us an attitude the entire time and barely came over to us because we didn't want to order alcohol. The spinach and artichoke dip was disgusting,  it has to be frozen and processed. The four cheese macaroni with chicken also tasted like a microwaved dinner with no flavor. It was gross. I will NOT be back."
Cyndi C.,"Boston, MA",62,38,158,4.0,7/13/2014,"I gave it a 4-star for the excellent customer services received from the manager and our waitress. They were very attentive to our concerns and courtesy to their customers. That will be our only reason to go back. Not too familiar with Applebee's menu(his mom gave him a certificate), we'll give it a try since its been sitting in his wallet. The food: appetiter sampler came with an array of faves...chix tender (wish we chose some other flavor besides bbq honey), mozzarella stix, Spinach dips, quesadilla...all not bad. We got the 20 for 2 meal deal. I got the 7oz steak (was craving for Steaktips for weeks, but didn't see it on the menu.) Medium rare came out well done.However, the mashed potato and steam veggies were good. The waitress gladly exchanged the steak to my liking. My guy's meal was the chicken penne, which he ate some of the pasta,which he liked, but then we noticed the translucent  redness on the sliced chicken strips. Yes, they were sliced! Didn't the cook or the sous chef paid any attention to the quality control of their cooking? The lady manager came by (I noticed she's been greeting and checking every table...Applebee's need to take notice, she deserves a bonus for her customer care!). She was so courtesy and concerned that she kindly exchanged a new one. We addressed our problems so the establishment can improve, that's what they need for their kitchen. We packed both meals to go since we both were full from the appetizer and Caesar salads.  When the bill came, they took off a portion of the bill, which was very nice of her. Weren't expecting that at all.  We would still go back since the atmosphere is clean and the staffs are nice and professional."
