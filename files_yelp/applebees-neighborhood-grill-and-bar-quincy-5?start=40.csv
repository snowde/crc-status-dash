Caroline F.,"Somerville, MA",2,8,1,1.0,7/4/2012,"The food, cleanliness, and service during the meal was okay. And yes - the amount of salt and butter doused on every item of food is enough to season an entire family of four's meal. But all this mediocrity I expected. What REALLY annoyed me however is the fact that the waiter (Matt) did not give us our change back for the bill and just ASSUMED that the remainder was his tip. He did not consult with us whether we wanted the change back, which is standard practice! Usually, the waiter usually just gives back the change and the guest then leaves a tip, unless the guest requests no change is necessary. This ""restaurant"" needs proper payment-acceptance etiquette; its ""service"" isn't so fantastic that it can disregard standard tipping practice. No, you do not dictate your own tip. Whether the tip is $200 or $20, it's a matter of principle!"
Yesenia R.,"Brockton, MA",320,30,71,4.0,12/2/2012,For some one who never ate at an Applebee's I had a good time staff  was nice  bathroom was clean very cleanly food was delicious  made me feel good
Erin P.,"Quincy, MA",20,9,,1.0,8/6/2014,"I ordered the nachos, about halfway through it tasted like someone dumped a pile of salt on them.  The bartender was nice but I feel that because I wasn't a regular I didn't receive the right amount of attention.  She tried to offer me a half order of nachos to go, tough to reheat I said to her.  In the end she didn't do anything to please me, probably won't be back there anytime soon."
Adrienne T.,"Atlanta, GA",140,814,120,3.0,4/6/2010,"Went to this Applebee's for the first time last night.  I don't do Applebee's often,maybe annually, but when I do, I usually go to South Bay. Anyway, this one wasn't crowded, service was incredibly efficient and friendly, but the food hasn't changed.  It's just yuck. Bland. Blah. It'll probably be another 2 years before I show up at any Applebee's again."
Kasem W.,"Boston, MA",6,222,10,1.0,5/2/2014,"Been here three times and every time we had problems with food and service.  Overall grade: F Service: F (the server lost our credit card, but we found it) Food quality: not many choices if you have allergies = F There are many better choices in the area."
Joe B.,"Quincy, MA",16,26,,2.0,3/5/2013,"Even after reading a few reviews on here and other places we decided to give it a go.  Fail sauce.  The first impression pretty much set me off.  We walked in to an empty reception area and waited.  And waited.  My partner went to the restroom, I stood at the hostess stand and downloaded a few games onto my new phone..   Worth noting, the manager was in my eye sight having a personal conversation with someone not in uniform (I assume a friend) and I made eye contact with the bartender and a waiter 4 tables from the door...  And we waited....  After 7 minutes, I walked into the bar and waited.  And waited.  Finally after a full 10 minutes in the doors, we were acknowledged by an employee.  We were seated at a somewhat clean table and given menus.   Our server arrived, offered the mandated margarita (if they don't offer one, you get a free appetizer).  We placed our drink and app order.  Drinks came and we ordered food..  So far so good.  Our appetizer arrived and so began the decent of the meal.  We ordered the pretzels with craft beer cheese sauce.  This is an appetizer that T.G.I. Fridays made popular last year and since then, it's popped up on chain restaurant menus everywhere.  Once you've had the pretzels at Fridays, don't try them anywhere else.  They set the bar way too high.  Every other place I've tried them has missed the mark on the recipe... Think ""new coke"" vs ""classic coke"".   Anyways, the pretzel part was decent,  the vat of congealed cheese sauce on the other hand left much to be desired.  A little parsley or scallion or anything not urine yellow colored  would have gone a long way towards making it not look like a vat of mucus.   The food arrived in decent time.  Contrary to other reviews, other than our initial greeting, the timing of everything was going well for us.... At that point.... My ""Cajun Steak"" was insanely over cooked.  I ordered medium, it was pushing well.  There was also no discernible Cajun flavor on the plate.   I was going to ask for some Cajun seasoning but little did I know, we wouldn't see our waitress again for quite some time.   Once I'd eaten my potatoes and shrimp (oddly enough, the shrimp were cooked perfect, something I never expect from chain joints) I decide to eat my steak in its current form in hopes that even though the flavor was off, my body could still gain some nutrition from the animal.    My meal : shrimp perfect, steak way bland and way over temp.  Potatoes : think hospital cafeteria. My partner ordered a bacon n blue burger with fries, side of ranch.  His burger was cooked perfectly, fries hot, thumbs up on his side.   No ranch dressing  on the side though.. and as she never checked back, it remained the only downfall of his burger  As we were ""celebrating"" our first date some 2 years ago at an Applebee's in Cupertino CA (great meal), we decided to order dessert.  We looked over the menu and settled on a few small bite options..  We stacked our dinner plates and placed them on the edge of the table... And we waited... And waited.. And waited.    Finally we gave up on dessert in favor of going home and decided to ask for our check.   Our waitress was right in front of us the entire time we waited...  About 20 feet away at the front door hostess area WITH the same manager who had ignored us earlier.  They were engrossed in conversation for some 5-10 minutes as we finished our meal / wanted dessert.  We interrupted this seemingly personal conversation, got our check, paid and left.  I've spent over 10 years of my life as a waiter..  A damn good waiter. I've always been an over tipper but struggled with even leaving 15%.  The place wasn't busy which can bum a waitress out.  I always saw it as an opportunity to provide BETTER service to increase my tips from the few tables I had.   Certainly not the strategy in play this night.. In the end, we left full of regret and hungry for dessert. I've purposefully not named the guilty parties, but they know who they are.  My partner phoned and spoke with the manager about our concerns. She seemed annoyed.  Offered us a gift card which we declined.    In the present economy, going out to eat is a treat to many.  If the staff put forth some effort, then the patrons would have a more enjoyable meal and leave better tips = staff has a more enjoyable shift."
G H.,"Quincy, MA",8,25,1,4.0,3/15/2014,Thanks to my boss for a nice lunch..food and service good..manager even walked around to make sure all was well.
Shirley L.,"Quincy, MA",269,45,45,1.0,11/10/2012,The food is horrible and the service is terrible. My bf gave it a couple of tries...not just one but a couple. No improvement whatsoever. The ribs he ordered was dry and burnt and the pasta was very bland. And the one time we went with friends the waitress threw the drinks menu at our friend. RUDE! No wonder this place is empty most of the time!
Captain B.,"Weymouth, MA",6,65,21,1.0,1/30/2012,We ate here in January 2012 and found this place to be extremely dirty and dog eared. Bathrooms were filthy and had trash overflowing from the trash can. Bathroom smelled of old urine and needed to be mopped very badly. The toilet had not been cleaned in what looked like days and there was toilet paper on the floor and feces smeared across some of the wall. The womens room was also disgusting and both bathrooms had gang graffiti on the walls.      The restaurant has a smell to it quite probably from the filthy carpets that look like they have never been cleaned. Debris dropped by children including food and such is left under many of the tables. Our table was sticky with not thouroghly cleaned barbecue sauce from a previous customer.       The food was not of good quality and seemed to have been microwaved. Taste quality was bad and not worth the money. There is much better food two blocks away at The Ninety Nine Restaurant so dont waste your money here.      Service was slow and drinks were not refilled in a timely fashion. Management were unresponsive when these issues were brought to them. We do not recommend this restaurant for an enjoyable dining experience
Dan C.,"Abington, MA",0,18,1,1.0,10/8/2009,"Greetings, I have dined at this establishment for the last time. In both scenarios, the steak presented in the $2 for $20 menu could not be cooked to a ""medium"" temperature. In fact, it was served to me ""rare"", and then ""medium rare."" To add insult to injury, the manager never approached our table and the waiter told me directly that ""I hate our cook."" To top it off, the vegetables were saturated in enough butter to send a middle aged man to the ER!  This is yet another example of a corporate restaurant's maketing image failing miserably to match up with the local dining establishment. What is the use of spending millions on televisons ads if the customer suffers are the hands of the service staff (Yes, that includes the kitchen)? Adivice to others, ditch this place. Dining out during this recession shouldn't have to be this painful. Kind Regards, A-C"
Mimi H.,"Quincy, MA",94,128,90,2.0,1/11/2010,"Eh, I go here a lot because it's close and I'm on weight watcher's (and they have weight watcher's endorsed menu items).  It's near my work so sometimes we go for drinks here. Sometimes there's a guy making balloon animals. And it's annoying. (but sometimes it's good looking girls)  I went on a date here the other night. I got a side salad. The veggies were old. My bf felt sick after he ate his burger.  The dessert shooters are bomb and the quesadilla burger is possibly one of the greatest inventions of this century."
K M.,"Braintree, MA",5,57,,1.0,7/7/2009,"This is the worst Applebee I'd ever been to.  We were there for lunch and had the worst service.  Given the fact that Applebees isn't anything fancy you would imagine a decent service would be nice!  We had ordered an appetizer and by the time our entrees came out, the waiter didn't even bother taking away all the finished appetizer plates.  Not to mention, our order came out wrong and when we tried to flag the waiter down, he went MIA-- knowingly he was by the bar talking to his co-workers.  Seriously that was uncalled for.  Poor service!"
John S.,"Pasadena, CA",7,44,2,4.0,7/23/2011,"Most people giving bad reviews here has unreal expectations from a place that serves 2 for $20. The truth is the place provides excellent food and service in relation to the price.   The burgers are very tasty and the staff is very nice, except for one old guy with a goatie, I don't know what his problem is."
Shannon O.,"Boston, MA",0,4,,3.0,5/13/2014,I was kind of impressive with the service i had lastnight. the lady was very nice and service was A ok! better then most time i visited with my boyfriend. drinks! I always go with the frozen strawberry margarita with sugar on the rim! ;) they make gd drinks here.
Caitlin C.,"Boston, MA",122,29,13,1.0,8/19/2013,"So I went here with my boyfriend a few weeks ago....and we were seated in a booth on the dining side. Following us being seated, several other customers were seated and served their drinks around us. 20-25 minutes later we still weren't even asked what we wanted to drink or greeted by a waitress/waiter and so we stopped the hostess while she was walking by and let her know. We ended up getting the entire meal for free since we were ignored......i mean are we invisible? Really."
Barry R.,"East Weymouth, MA",0,17,,1.0,7/6/2014,"We went there yesterday afternoon, 7/5/2014.  Were seated and waited 15-20 minutes no waitress, although there were plenty working. Meanwhile the group sitting behind us had their drinks and food we still haven't seen a waitress. So we finally asked the girl who was the maitre d to send someone. Finally someone shows up to take the drink order but we are not going to take a chance so we order our food also. Took quite a while for the drinks to show up. The food arrived from a different waitress, doesn't really matter. No one every asked if we needed more drinks. After the meal my daughter was going to take her left over's home. Again we waited and waited and waited, nobody, we almost left without paying. She finally showed up asked the usual what can I do for you,  screw the left overs, my wife says ""Don't leave this table till you give us the check. What a disaster. I love the food especially the ribs but never again. I'll go to the 99 where waitress know how to take care of a table of 4."
Jenn B.,"Norfolk, MA",5,37,,3.0,7/20/2009,"I just moved to quincy and tried this applebees before i read the yelp reviews.  It's almost never busy and yeah the service isnt great (sitting near the bar helps to get better service, thats where the staff hangs out)  but they have great deals and decent food depending on what you get. i really liked there appetizer and 2 meals for $20, thats unheard of, and its a FULL meal! i would suggest if you go here to get the burgers or salads and there dessert shooters are delish and just the right size. STAY AWAY FROM THE RIBLETs!!!!  its mostly bones, i was disappointed with those"
Sylvia C.,"Quincy, MA",0,8,,4.0,2/6/2013,"I think the food is great, ,the service is good depending on who you have we ask for specific staff,they give free refills on non-alcoholic beverages and there 1/2 price appetizers are awesome and inexpensive for date night! They have no problem with special requests like eliminating ingredients if you ask. The host are nice, always open the door for you. The only thing I suggest is ask for a seat away from the windows when its cold,very drafty .I've requested many times and they have no problem with special requests,they're very accomodating."
Anna F.,"Boston, MA",0,7,,4.0,10/9/2013,This is my favorite Applebees.  The food is always delicious and the service is always great.  Love the mini cheeseburgers =)
Richard Y.,"Boston, MA",60,2,,2.0,4/9/2014,"I went here recently for lunch. When we got there, the place was empty besides the staff (that should have been a sign of things to come). While I was not expecting a fully packed restaurant for lunch, I was expecting for there to be at least a few people going there to eat at that time. We were seated immediately to our table and the waitress took our drink order. It took over 10 mins before she came back with our drinks (quite a while when we are the only ones there). All we ordered for drinks was water and a soda. For the food we went with their 2 for $25 menu that includes an appetizer and 2 entrees. For the appetizer we split the Boneless Wings with Spicy Buffalo sauce. According to their menu, it was suppose to be lightly breaded. Not in the least. Every bite tasted more flour than chicken with a hint of buffalo sauce.  Once, our appetizer was finished and we ended up just sitting there, waiting for our entrees. During that whole time the waitress never came to check on us on anything, not even to check if we needed any drink refills or to clear the appetizer plates. The entrees appeared about 30 mins after our appetizer. We had ordered everything at the same time.  I ordered the 4-Cheese Mac & Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders, which was decent for mac and cheese but the honey pepper sauce mixed in gave it a weird flavor. The order also came with a bread stick, which was clearly burnt and charred on top. I am surprised they sent it out like so. My friend ordered the Double Crunch Shrimp. I had tried one of the shrimps and that seem to be the only thing that turned out well throughout the whole time we were there. They do give you a lot of food. However, it seemed a hit or miss depending on what you order. While the food and price were decent, I can't get pass the slow and almost lack of service. We were there for almost a complete hour and more than half that time was of us waiting for our foods and drinks. I would understand if they were packed but to be one of the only few tables seated in a pretty much empty restaurant seems unreasonable. Next time I will take my money and go to the many other restaurants in that area than back to this one."
