Mrs. G.,"Boston, MA",27,101,6,1.0,3/13/2010,"THE WORST MEAL I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!! SO NASTY. How do you screw up steamed vegetables?????! It tasted like they were soaking in crisco? The steak was hard as a rock as well. A friend of mine worked there in Hadley, MA and she told me everything is microwaved and she told me not to ever eat there. One night I was starving and stopped in for a quick dinner and left absolutely disgusted. I didn't even eat my food. And the service was super slow and awkward. I will never ever eat at an AppleBees again!"
Tammi M.,"Quincy, MA",16,56,,3.0,10/1/2012,They just renovated so it's not as dark and dingy as it used to be. Food has been more consistent and it seems like there's a whole new waitstaff in place.
Jon G.,"Quincy, MA",3,55,1,1.0,5/31/2009,"Not that I rock the corporate casual dining circuit that often, but this place was shockingly bad and deserves its due. It was nearly empty, yet the staff was apparently overwhelmed by one large party; there were customers who had been waiting like an hour for their food, going berzerk. And the hostess got into a screaming match with our waiter, accusing him of stealing tips or something, I don't know. They were actually SWEARING at each other! Outrageous. The food, when it finally came, was, y'know, Applebee's food."
Christine B.,"Quincy, MA",3,27,,1.0,3/7/2009,"This is the worst applebees I have ever been to!  The service is bad, the food tastes like rubber.  And it's eerily quiet....lots of people dining alone."
angela c.,"Quincy, MA",13,22,,1.0,4/11/2008,"My sister and I went here last night with her two kids.  By the time we got there, it was about 7:00, and was relatively busy with families having gone there for Thursday night dinner.  We were seated within five minutes of arriving, and then proceeded to wait for almost 15 minutes before our waitress even acknowledged that we were sitting there.  She then left to go to the bar to get a drink order for another table.  When she brought out their drinks, she proceeded to go take the drink order at a table that had been seated after we were.  That was only the beginning.  My niece and nephew were very hungry, having not eaten since early afternoon, and it was about dinner time for them anyways.  My sister got up to ask to speak to a manager who ended up being our waiter for the rest of the night.  He was not, however, that much better than our waitress.  We ordered an appetizer, and an entree per person (four total, two of which were kids meals that we requested be brought out with the appetizer).  When our waiter brought out the appetizer, the kids' meals were nowhere in sight.  When they finally came out, almost 10 minutes later, my niece was on the verge of tears because she was so hungry.  My sister and I got our entrees, but they were not that much better.  My pasta was not heated completely through, and I heard from at another table none of the food was warm.  I had been to this location before, and not experienced problems as bad as this.  But truthfully, I'm never going back there again."
Julie F.,"Weymouth, MA",9,102,,2.0,7/6/2005,"I am never, ever, ever impressed with Applebees. Every time I see an ad for what looks like a good new item or promotion, I stop in, thinking that this time will be different. But the food is just so mediocre, and they manage to screw up even the burgers. Service is always less than stellar, and it's pretty much a guarantee there will be a screaming child throwing a tantrum somewhere in the restaurant while you're there. For all that, I have no idea why they are always so busy. Quincy is chock full of such good local restaurants, do yourself a favor and choose one of them instead of this 'eh' chain."
Nausheen M.,"Boston, MA",11,44,,1.0,10/15/2006,"I don't know why this place is always so busy...their food is not good atall...everything tastes like as if it has just been thawed out and microwaved.  Nothing here is tasty!  And on top of that you have to wait a long time to be seated--this place is a big waste of time, appetite and money!"
c c.,"Boston, MA",0,7,,1.0,2/18/2010,"Upon arrival I was greeted cheerfully & expected to have a good experience. I assumed wrong, not only was the atmosphere very shifty, but the food choices were slim and mostly unappealing. Finally i chose a simple bacon cheeseburger, the meat was well cooked like I asked for but the bread, burnt to the crisp. I honesty took one bite, I ended up paying money for 2 handfuls of french fries and a cup of sprite. Seriously after talking with my friend who accompanied me, I've decided mc. Donald's is a better place for valentines dinner."
Mei C.,"New York, NY",44,32,10,2.0,2/25/2008,"The new trios menu is terrific!  However, due to poor management, they forgot to serve the appertizer and they did not even bother to make another order to serve it, they just forgot about it!  They also gave me the wrong dessert!  The tables are dirty and my waitress was running around like a wild goose.  I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone, do not go!"
Corey G.,"Boston, MA",5,64,,4.0,11/6/2009,This is for the red apple sangria. I've never eaten here but OMG the sangria is sooo good!
Ame k.,"Quincy, MA",13,181,,3.0,9/3/2005,"i been there few times, the food is ok, nothing surprising great about this place."
