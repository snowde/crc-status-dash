Chris K.,"Wake, NC",24,6,,5.0,4/23/2012,Always a good time in the neighborhood.  The staff is always so welcoming and hospitable as if I am one of the family.
Denise B.,"Raleigh, NC",87,447,378,4.0,6/17/2012,Not one of my favorite places to go but they can have good drink specials.  When we left a credit card here they were very accommodating in saving it until we could get back to retrieve it.
Anna L.,"Raleigh, NC",2,7,,3.0,7/6/2014,"I work at a restaurant and I decided to try an experiment. Being a vegetarian, it is hard to eat out at places like Applebee's but this location was fabulous. The food was good (except the mashed potatoes, I'm really picky about them) and the service was amazing! If you go to this location, ask for Maggie! She is an amazing server and really will do anything to make sure you have a great time and service. I recommend this location if you are in the Raleigh are."
Sonja B.,"Raleigh, NC",0,16,,2.0,7/21/2015,"Ate here today for the first time with my daughter,  the meal was okay.   Never saw the waiter other than him coming by with a refill that I didn't ask for which was okay.  Not one time did he ever come by to ask did we need anything.  When we finally got his attention to ask for a box to go and bill he did that.  After bringing the box, her never gave us a bag to carry the container out the store, yet when he bought the bill, he lingered around the table in close view waiting on a tip.  Your tip is contingent upon the type of service received,  not because you feel you deserve it.  Customer service is everything.   And never knowing a waiter's name because he never said is so unprofessional when you're serving.   And not sure why a duplicate receipt was given after giving the original with my money.  Being all about the surveys on a receipt is a must.  Therefore, this is the reason I'm making this post on Yelp.  Leon, serving table #15 needs more training."
Ehren W.,"Wycombe District, United Kingdom",0,51,,2.0,1/11/2015,"I don't know how the food is at this location, because I didn't get a chance to even order so much as a water. After waiting almost  over 10 minutes for some sort of service, I stopped a passing water and asked ""where is my server, no one has been to my table at all. The waiter replied ""Oh, he's coming"".  Ten minutes later, nothing.  I actually had the misfortune of working part-time at an Applebee's,, so I understand that no matter what was going on, my server should have/could have, asked someone else to greet us and get us beverages (like the waiter who had the tables right besides us), if he was going to be detained doing whatever And even if he hadn't, the server I spoke with should have gotten our beverages at least. . My companion and I told this same joke of a waiter that we were leaving since no one was interested in serving us and he said ""ok"" and walked off. I went to a neighboring restaurant and had great service and food, so thank you Applebee's."
Police Lives Matter ..,"Greenville, SC",0,187,17,4.0,2/19/2011,Consistent with other Applebee's. Steak had to me re-cooked but 2nd one was very good. Highly recommend.
William T.,"Johnston, SC",0,1,,1.0,9/27/2013,"Some of the dirtiest tables I have ever eaten on. Sticky and greasy. Food is pretty good. Service is spotty. I have eaten there frequently since I visit RDU airport often and this is close by.  However, just will not continue to deal with the dirty table tops."
Mishelle N.,"Tracy, CA",808,242,303,4.0,3/9/2011,"good service and good food, stop in here from the airport on travel. quick and to the point they  let me  eat  off the kids  menu because i dont eat that much ( maybe 4 bites) and im  done."
