Christopher W.,"Calgary, Canada",13,307,182,3.0,12/16/2008,"I like Applebee's and will go there again soon. We stopped in for a snack and a beer and the service was quick. They have a good menu, with lots of selection and Applebees stands out for their quality food. They have a good pick and match deal and the prices are more reasonable here than other chain restaurants. I'll be back for a full meal next time."
Chad G.,"Division No.  8, Canada",2,13,4,1.0,4/29/2012,"We stopped in for lunch with the family. The restaurant had many empty tables but we still had to wait to be seated.  After about 20 minutes somebody came to take our drink orders. When our drinks came we ordered appetizers and the main course.  Approximately an hour later the appetizers showed up.  Watery spinach dip and chili cheese nachos that appeared to have been microwaved, as they were soggy.  Dinner came 45 minutes after that,  however without fries as 'they were out of fresh ones'. The fries showed up at the end of the meal after my entree (microwaved by the taste of it) was already finished.  No discount,  no apologies.   I feel like I was robbed, I knew going in it wouldn't be spectacular,  but this is a new low."
Jenna G.,"Edmonton, Canada",24,49,15,3.0,5/5/2012,"I popped in here for dinner this evening with a friend. It was right in the middle of the Friday dinner rush, but we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. Once we were seated, someone came by quickly to take our drink orders and answer a few menu questions, as we had never eaten at an Applebee's before. We settled an a pair of appetizers -- Chili Cheese Nachos ($11) and the Chicken Wonton Tacos ($9). For the price, you get a fair amount of nachos, but the tacos were much more tasty (unfortunately, much smaller, however). Still, with chatting, we were probably in and out of the restaurant in about 45 minutes -- pretty good for a Friday night!"
Gary C.,"Stony Plain, Canada",68,138,3,4.0,8/12/2011,My wife and I visited this location today for supper.  Service was very quick and the food excellent.  There is a special on right now that involves two meals plus an appetizer for $25.00.  This is an excellent value for two people.
September L.,"Red Deer, Canada",7,45,,4.0,10/22/2011,"I eat at Applebee's regularly. Their service is standard fare. The food is ALWAYS delicious and ALWAYS consistent! My favourite has to be the scrumptious, yet very sloppy, quesadilla cheeseburger! It has a little zing to it, for those who like to avoid anything spicy. The ambiance is very eclectic; full of old signs, old pictures, & antique items. With those walls, you could take a few minutes to look at things over several visits."
Brandi H.,"Winfield, Canada",0,11,,1.0,11/10/2013,"Below average meal. Food was lukewarm, fries were cold. French onion soup was disgusting, my husband and son thought it tasted stale. I had the skillet fajitas, rice was very spicy but flavourless otherwise, and the steak was tough, fatty, and a bit rancid tasting. Tried this place a few times, but won't be going back again. Oh and it's no longer Applebee's, its been renamed The Bistro."
