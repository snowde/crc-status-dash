Krista F.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,8,,5.0,8/28/2017,"Went to this Applebees on Saturday for lunch and had a fantastic lunch!!  I had the pork chop with the Cajun shrimp topper, with garlic green beans with bacon, and garlic mashed potatoes.. YUM !  All of it was perfect and delicious!!  Ordered a Perfect Margarita, it was also perfect!  My husband got the baby back ribs and steamed broccoli..he said both were delicious!!     A huge shout out to Manny who was our server..  He was attentive and checked several times to make sure everything was the way we ordered it, and delicious. Definitely a top notch server. Thanks Manny!!  Everything on their menu looked amazing and since we had not been there in quite awhile it took us a bit of time to decide on what to get.     We will definitely be back there are several more items I would like to try!!!   **Applebee's PLEASE bring back the garlic bread you used to have....it goes perfectly with the Oriental Chicken Salad!!"
Mike D.,"Bakersfield, CA",10,43,,1.0,12/29/2017,"Gawd awful...dropped in with daughter and 2 granddaughters for a late afternoon lunch and food was terrible, altho service was fine.. The food: I ordered the chicken bacon cheese sandwich with onion rings and the chicken (I think that is what it was) had the consistency of a hockey puck..No taste what-so-ever and it tasted like it had been frozen since 1979..daughters chicken wrap was the same..granddaughters chicken strips were over fried to the point of tasting like leather...only good thing was the sliced apple wedges (hard to screw that up)..I am done with Applebees..$50 waste of money..."
Beki A.,"San Bernardino, CA",74,11,1,4.0,11/25/2017,The hostess was very clearly spoken and polite and seemed like a good well-rounded person. The waitress said she was new. Her name is Limber. She was also awesome. The food was really good. There could be more slaw on the chicken tenders platter but the food was good. My husband also liked everything. The price was decent for what we got. That was our first time going and we'll be back.
Joseph S.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,6,4,4.0,9/9/2017,"Edited:  Second visit much better than the first.  Got the correct sauces and the meal was excellent.   Original Review:  Ordered online to pick up to-go in the restaurant.  Food was ready fast and service was friendly BUT portions were small for the larger size meals we ordered and they made mistakes on the order that we did not discover until getting home.  Called the restaurant and manager said she'd email me something to make it up to me and to give them a second chance.  We'll see how it goes.  If you are willing to give this Applebee's a try, the onion rings appetizer is really good."
Shane G.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,6,,5.0,10/23/2017,"The lady and I went here last night for some dollar margaritas and an appetizer and had a very positive first experience at this location. The bartender and manager serving us were friendly, polite, and provided great customer service. There was a guy sitting at the bar with his friends who seems to have had one too many beers and would stop loudly cussing and ranting angrily with homophobic slurs and the manager was pretty prompt and professional in handling it, whereas in my experience in other family restaurants that serve alcohol, the situation will just be ignored until it has already escalated too far. Anyway... great staff, great service, good margaritas, good drinks. Will definitely be back."
Yolanda O.,"Long Beach, CA",26,18,3,5.0,6/5/2017,"My family and I stopped by just to grab something to eat and a cocktail. Brandon your service was great, the drink were good and the food was HOT and fresh! Thank you! Thank you! For GREAT customer service."
Roy B.,"Redlands, CA",3,34,2,5.0,1/30/2017,"I avoided Applebees for years! I was somehow under the impression that it was a white trash type of place with crap food. I wasn't completely wrong with what type of people this place brings in but the food is good! The drinks are super cheap during happy hour/Sundays and they have enough tv's to catch any sport I'm trying to watch. I'll be honest, my wife and I have to be in an Applebees mood to eat here. This means that we don't care what kind of service we get, we don't feel like spending much more than $30, and I may or may not be wearing slippers so that I fit in with the other guests lol. Only on a few occasions do we not sit at the bar. Some of the local oldies seem to like to try and chat with everyone at the bar no matter how far away you sit. All and all, we like having a place to go where we have zero expectations and want something cheap. We have found multiple things on their menu that we end up craving. The mac and cheese with chicken strips is so tasty. As long as nobody we know sees us walk in there we will keep eating here. Just kidding!"
Steven T.,"Beaumont, CA",34,2,4,1.0,5/31/2017,The worst service I have ever had. Food was late took 3 and half hours to feed the kids. Waitress was confused on what we ordered and what happened to our order. Waiter was rude. Manager had to step in and she was pregnant carrying three trays while her crew just watched. Said meal would be comped still ended with a bill well over 250 bucks. Worst experience of my life at a restaurant. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!
Greg T.,"San Jacinto, CA",15,14,11,5.0,11/26/2016,"Excellent service today with Jason our server. My wife and I both ordered the Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken and it was the best thing I've had lately. My wife's plate came with much less of the delicious rice, but when I pointed it out, they brought more out for her without question or problem. I highly recommend this location for the food and the service. Thank you Applebees!"
Danny V.,"Rialto, CA",562,71,49,3.0,11/16/2016,"I'm in a bit of mixed feelings with Applebee's to be honest. I'll try to be as unbiased as possible but still bringing up my tastes and distastes with them.  In the past, I have had extremely horrible service mixed a bland menu or maybe just my luck catching bad cooks on duty (In my opinion based off 10 years of memories). My definition of bad service: not refiling my drink; forgetting about me at the table; waiting an extended period of time to be seated, take my order, or just check to make sure I'm still alive. I will state a huge award winning thing that they do is show MAJOR support to military veterans. Myself being a disabled veteran I often find that companies off other discounts but elect to lookover veterans. Thank you Applebee's for being a huge supporter in supporting the troops and veterans. My most recent visit to Applebee's (the visit at this location in Redlands), I ordered Pomegranate Lemonade and the Three Cheese Chicken Cavatappi. First I'll speak on the ordering system, I absolutely love it, it makes ordering quick and easy, as well calling over a server as respectful as possible at the click of a bottom rather than at the snap of your finger. Even upon checkout paying on the system. Being seated and bringing the food and drinks is the only true thing the server has to focus on (the most important part of the experience next to their knowledge on the food if there is any questions.) My Pomegranate Lemonade was great. The balance of syrup and lemonade was very even. As well, the syrup having fresh Pomegranate pieces in it. Very refreshing. As far as the Three Cheese Chicken Cavatappi, I don't have much to say.. Not a good thing but not a bad thing. It was just ok. Sauces consistency wasn't as thick as I'd like it to have been, was a bit thin (in my opinion but as it cool it thickened to what I would of wanted when it was hot.) Additionally, it was very light on chicken, cheap option to save a bit of money? Possibly. They chicken was nicely blackened, I did enjoy it. Overall the pasta was decent. Not the best but no the worst by far.  I waiting a bit before getting seated but over all the service and servers where awesome. One complain I do have, although, I understand for profit reasons. The manager asked (trying to convince change my selection) me to change my lemonade to a margarita. Myself being in recovery from drug/alchole addiction I wasn't to please with what seemed to be pressure to drink an alcholic beverage. I have no issue with declining but I know others that are fresh in their recovery that may not be able to. Other than that, service was great. It's Applebee's. Great for lunch and happy hour. Enjoy!"
Markita L.,"Loma Linda, CA",0,41,26,1.0,4/7/2017,Don't go here. The food is awful. Just hop on the 10 fwy and go to chilli's off of hospitality if you have to choose between the two. At least you'll get better food.
D W.,"Riverside, CA",0,42,7,3.0,10/22/2017,"Service was great, servers also very courteous, order 2 for $20.00 good choice for us, salad and chicken, a shrimp dish, everything ok except chicken on the dry side. We enjoy our time there. Great location."
Carlos A.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,8,4,5.0,10/8/2017,Came to Applebee's Marie was our waiter everything was good had one issue but was taken care of Trish the manager came and took care of us really good will definitely come back we got tooken care of here manager had to get involved but was fixed right away
Terri Y.,"San Bernardino, CA",64,55,57,3.0,8/23/2016,"Came here for lunch with my family on a weekend. We ordered their lunch specials which were for ""weekdays"" only. But they hooked it up so we can have it. The manager was friendly. The onion rings are always great here."
Belinda H.,"Hemet, CA",27,4,18,1.0,5/27/2017,"It's first time from us eat Applebee's in Redlands ... first I really disappointed about the service. Second, they try lying to us ... the menu said that you can have unlimited fries refill but when I try asked and order they said no refill and get charged for it. Third, I ordered combo steak and they not tell us about ounces so when I pay they charged us for 6 onz until I argue with one of them and she gave me discount for 4 onz. I appreciate about her but I thing still feel dissatisfaction about service. Combine service taste and price!!!"
Randy J.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,4,,5.0,5/27/2017,"We enjoyed another excellent meal this afternoon at Applebee's in Redlands! Our waitress Jade, and Chef Tello made our lunch extra special! Our food was excellent and  beautifully presented."
David B.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,4,3,5.0,5/3/2017,"Food is always good , my girlfriends favorite place to go eat, they never fail to surprise us"
Chacon L.,"Riverside, CA",4,256,7,5.0,1/28/2017,Best service I've ever received at an Applebee's. Ruben at the bar was polite and attentive. Heather is not only beautiful but totally awesome! Great staff here.
Ben H.,"Banning, CA",0,4,1,5.0,9/26/2016,"I went for lunch with my wife and i requested a substitute on my meal with server Adelma and she put in order. She never let us have an empty glass of soda which was awesome.   When we received our food, Mihila was the gm on duty, and she came by as our food brought to our table and asked how things were. I noticed my substitution was not applied and I told Mihila and right away she fixed the problem.   It's costumer service like this that keeps us coming back.  Thank you"
Mark W.,"Santa Monica, CA",39,1,,1.0,12/6/2016,"Terrible service. First and last I will ever go to this establishment again. First, I arrived at 8p.m. had dinner and waited for happy hour. Second, I ordered drinks which never got there. I Waited 20 minutes after ordering and was told "" There's only one bartender working tonite "" which is ok however I personally observe other people who recieved there cocktails after I ordered mine. Someone is definitely dropping the ball at this place. My evening was ruined seeing that I was visiting from out of town and choose this place over others."
Dave H.,"Highland, CA",20,33,,4.0,1/6/2017,"First time eating here and overall was a good evening. The only bummer of it was the two year old child seated behind/next to us with her two siblings and inattentive mother. Almost ruined the evening. Who brings a toddler to a bar and grill anyways? Anywho, the food was good (but wasn't necessarily as advertised in the menu... and changing potato sides cost extra? ... why?)  However, we still enjoyed ourselves. The place was rather loud but that's to be expected."
Marcia G.,"Las Vegas, NV",99,348,396,5.0,11/24/2016,"Went for a late lunch and I ordered my favorite salad, Oriental Chicken with a side of extra dressing because they don't give you enough. My son ordered a chicken finger basket, these 2 entrees were the best options for the 2 for 20 deal, which comes with an appetizer. Our server was great and checked on us for refills. Then a manager checked on us and they had a notice on the menu holder that if your server doesn't offer one of their gift cards to buy then you get free dessert. We brought that to the managers attention, and she said that he hadn't checked us out just yet with a bill. So basically, give him a chance. So we did. He came by and we did order dessert. After that he brought the bill, in which the manager was with him. Still he didn't say the offer. The server said, he wasn't aware of that, even though the notice is on every table. The manager took him to the register, and she apparently took the dessert charge off. Thanks to my son, who was on it because I didn't even want dessert. I say all this to commend Applebees to sticking to their word."
Joy Beth W.,"San Bernardino, CA",4,128,107,5.0,4/25/2016,This is a good location not crowded and not noisy. Good food too. Marie was our sever very kind and she was always ready to refill the water and tea. This is my favorite location and I've ate at a few in the area
Ramiro C.,"Anaheim, CA",93,120,5,1.0,2/18/2015,"I use to love the happy hour...the staff are all pretty cool I know 2 of them personally.  What really kills me is not the lack of service but the lack of quality. Bonless wings have come out Luke warm the last 3x But this last time just did it for me I ordered a Long island ice tea and on top of the lemon wedge they put in the drink was some sort of big insect.  The waiter was like ""oooh yeah thats a bug should I call the manager?""  And I was like ueah and call the Orkin Man .... Manager on duty was very apologetic ...she said I wont charge you for the drink.....I never even took a sip, so that was obvious.  I had a quesadilla and she didnt charge me for that $4 on happy hour and I said ok.   What wasnt ok was that the 2 other people were only half way done with the plates they ordered and they didn't want to eat no more.  Nothing was done about that...just sorry and a free quesadilla they didn't charge.  I didn't make a big deal out of it, they got our $75 but we wont be back again"
Keyantta H.,"Redlands, CA",0,11,,1.0,11/6/2016,"Worst experience tonight at Applebee's. I placed an online order and the site said my food would be ready at 7:11pm. The site even asked for my make, model and color of my car. I thought awesome, I will pull up they will bring my food and home I go. Well not so. I arrived, server comes out confirms order and goes back inside, server comes back out brings check and I sign, says they are putting it together and it will be right out. I sit and wait and wait and wait. I go in 35 min later, they get the manager and she said oh we were getting some boxes and we just have the bread left to box up. I am dumb founded like seriously what kind of restaurant are you running, needless to say I went home frustrated."
Scott S.,"Napa, CA",193,118,190,1.0,12/9/2014,"I don't know you well enough to tell you the story of how I ended up at this Applebees, so let's just skip over that part. THE STEAK: My god, the food here sucks. I ordered a sirloin steak that was advertised on the menu as either 8 or 9 ounces (I don't remember exactly which). Part of the problem with picture menus is that the pictures show a BIG beautiful steak shot by a professional food stylist in a studio set up. What I got on my plate instead was the saddest, misshapen piece of low grade beef I think I've ever seen. If you look at the picture I posted, you'll see that the size of this thing barely qualifies as a chicken tender. And it was basically slapped on a plate and previously frozen French fries thrown on the plate. After dinner, I asked my mom if I could pop one of her muscle relaxers because my jaw was so sore from gnawing on this piece of meat that had the texture of rehydrated beef jerky. THE TABLE: As I was praying to God to make me a bird so I could fly away... far, far away... I looked up, and on the wall of our booth was a big collage of pictures of the local police department. Okay, I get that this big corporate giant is trying to fool people into thinking that they're a local community restaurant by posting pictures of local firemen, little league teams, etc. But honestly, this is the most awkward, inhospitable, and unappetizing thing you could put on the wall, just short of pictures of local morticians. You can see from the pictures I posted that I was looking up at pictures of SWAT teams, a militarized police force, and even a picture of some cop in full tactical gear on the side of someone's house with an HK MP5 submachine gun raised and ready to kill someone. Applebee's, thanks for reminding me that the community of Redlands, California isn't much that much different from Fallujah or Kandahar."
Kathryn H.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,10,4,2.0,6/3/2017,The bartender Jade is terrible! Zero interest in her customers and I had to ASK for a menu. She didn't even offer. Was more interested in the males at the bar than females. This place needs to bring back bartenders who get to know their customers and take pride in good service. Two stars because the drink was at least good.
Nicho S.,"Redlands, CA",16,661,411,4.0,2/10/2016,"Not bad for an Applebees, first time to this location and I was pretty impressed with the variety of good, well priced food that they offer. The food is good, great service, great location and very affordable prices!"
Gabriella S.,"San Bernardino, CA",5,15,3,1.0,3/30/2017,Won't return here ever. It's been about 7 years since I've been to an Applebee's and now I remember why. Service and cleanliness. Last time I was here I received the dirtiest silverware ever and my artichoke dip was freezing. During my last visit tonight (my friends suggestion) the floors were all disgusting and dirty with food and debris. Seating areas were all dirty and stained with old foods. Nadia the very pleasant and polite hostess seated us and took our drink orders at 8:58pm our waitress (who we understand was overwhelmed) did not see us until 9:14 -I was on my phone once she arrived. I understand it's just a Thursday but perhaps staffing should be amped up when it comes to your happy hour. She was dealing with too many tables and had no problem expressing that to us as we wAited for her to take our orders. I got a 4- cheese mac and cheeses with chicken fingers. IT WAS FREAKING COLD. Even had my friend try it to see if I was being dramatic and she called the waitress to have it reheated. I gave the waitress the plate with 5 chicken stripes and two spirals of macaroni taken out. She returned it with  3 chicken strips and the entire plate in disarray. I let it go for my friends sake. But I will never return and never advise my guests to waste their time/money  on this place. I should've stuck to my seven year strike on this establishment
Brianne S.,"Riverside, CA",55,54,,5.0,9/26/2016,"American fare.... good prices. We mostly come foe the 2 for $20 or 2 for $25 deals.  The staff at this Applebees is always super friendly. Tonight....Jerrad made our visit. He was running the show... waiting tables and tending bar; a jack of all trades. He was warm and friendly, and made us laugh. A truly great server makes you feel like you went to dinner and a show. He even brought me and my adult daughter coloring sheets and crayons, simply because he could.  I ordered the 6 oz. Steak, with garlic green beans, and crispy cheese and bacon potatoes.... one word.... yum."
Wait N. SE E.,"Redlands, CA",30,25,156,4.0,8/6/2014,"Tonight we called in some desserts for the crew. Unfortunately, after 9 p.m.  the employees are not able to deliver curbside.  Despite that, Mayra was awesome in assisting with my order. Excellent option for a rainy night! Everything in our order was accurate and the food was great! This makes up for a previous trip, where a waitress(who shall remain nameless) accidentally dropped an entire plate of food at our table, landing on my husband. She simply was not paying attention as she was focused on another conversation.  I chose not to write a negative review at that time because the manager was on top of the situation and acted accordingly. Generally we have a great experience overall and end up with servers such aa Brandon, who is attentative, swift, polite and friendly. Overall, we enjoy this location."
Jean R.,"Ontario, CA",12,15,76,5.0,3/5/2015,Fully satisfied my boyfriend and I left the restaurant with food comma. Andrea G our waitress was superb loved the fact that she was always looking out and making sure we were happy. Second time I come to the one in Redlands and food is licking good.  We both had the 9oz Sirloin steak with shrimp over warm cheese with mashed potatoes and vegetables. i ordered there onion soup that was exquisite. love it.
Marko A.,"Redlands, CA",11,12,3,2.0,3/10/2017,"Not sure if this place is under new man but customer service has seriously gone down hill.They always used to be welling at the door and even open the door for us. Now they just stand there watching you come in with a dirty look on their face. The past few times we've been seated and we didn't have any dish ware up the to point when the food arrives we still didn't have spoons or forks. This last visits some young lady walked passed our table very quickly and dropped off the spoons and forks but slamming it on our table and walked away saying nothing. How rude was that!? We always seem to have two to three different waitresses though out our course of dinner. There's no bond with one waitress when you just got 3 different people bringing you food, drinks and appetizers. Food is never hot it's warm as well. This Applebee's used to be great and it's gone seriously down hill. I don't recommend it unless your just going to the bar to drink."
Laurel G.,"Redlands, CA",40,2,2,2.0,12/14/2015,The food was subpar. The pretzel came dark and never saw a piece of salt. Hope you don't want the amount of cheese they show in any of their pictures because it's not going to happen.  And don't even think about asking to omit an item off your order. Check before you bite. Especially if you have an allergy.
Diane C.,"Redlands, CA",0,71,7,2.0,7/29/2016,Late dinner here on a Friday night. Steak Caesar salad. Steak okay but so much dressing on salad couldn't eat it! Then waitress rounded up my bill shorting me some change. Not a lot but still really annoying. Not sure I'd come back here. There are a lot of good restaurants in Redlands so many other choices.
Victoria A.,"Redlands, CA",0,26,,5.0,7/15/2016,I go here every so often usually the service is great but yesterday I was unhappy with the service the only thing worth wild was the food
Frankie J.,"Hesperia, CA",1,2,1,4.0,3/22/2015,Awesome service best apple bees I've ever been too. Awesome servers and great staff. Definitely will be coming back
Laura C.,"Pomona, CA",4,3,,2.0,3/6/2016,"The Bartenders were nice but the manager is not nice. I was asking who was going to serve us and she reply she was the manager not a server and that the bartenders would serve me, she was not professional at all... I don't like her at all she doesn't Make you feel welcome"
Sara B.,"Highland, CA",0,10,3,5.0,4/8/2016,Our server Mark was amazing. Running around bringing us drinks and making sure everything was perfect! The food was far better than anything I have ever tasted. Lemon chicken with rice and quinoa and cranberries. Oh my gosh it was heaven on earth! The drinks were perfect. That rum punch was to die for! There were three of us and it wasn't too pricey. Best Applebee's I have EVER been to! I will definitely return and recommend! Thank you Mark! Your earrings were on point! :)
Josephine C.,"Calimesa, CA",1,22,2,5.0,5/7/2016,"What started as a bad experience got significantly better when the night time manager Brittany stepped in..Me and my boyfriend were getting ignored by our waiter and when we finally got our order in it came out wrong....we did not even have to say anything Brittany noticed us looking at the plate oddly, fixed it as fast as she could and apologized very quickly. She talked to our waiter and even comped part of our meal for the bad experience. There was nothing more she could have done to make our late night dinner better."
