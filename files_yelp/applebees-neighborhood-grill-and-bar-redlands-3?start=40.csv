Joe G.,"Torrance, CA",92,231,230,3.0,7/8/2015,"Came to Applebee's on a random Tuesday night for dinner.  It's been awhile since I've been to Applebee's and it seems as if their menu has changed.  For appetizers, we had the kobe meatballs.  They were ok.  I also had their Pepper-crusted sirloin for my entree.  It was an under 600 calorie entree, so I didn't have much flavor to it.  All in all, a standard meal at a chain restaurant."
Fantastic F.,"Chino Hills, CA",4,58,3,1.0,4/24/2015,"This is by far the worst applebees I Have ever been to.. The service is extremely slow.. Bartender inattentive, food portions are mediocre, food quality- always burned..( we decided to try try try this place again and it never fails ..) alcoholic drinks seem non alcoholic because such easy pours.. When I think redlands I think quality and this place is definitely not quality.  Definitely not up to other Applebee's standards. They should really re evaluate this location"
Corinna B.,"Highland, CA",0,41,16,5.0,5/10/2016,Went here for Mother's Day not crowded at all service was great! kept our drinks full at all times checked on us frequently I had a perfect margarita it was perfect the steak and potatoes were perfect too. My whole family was satisfied with all there meals.
Marie M.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,6,,5.0,10/18/2015,We have been here a few times and its always been great ! The staff are very friendly and very attentive. The food is always good and tasty.  We always go in the early evening. It can get a little loud at times but its not bothersome.
Mark M.,"Loma Linda, CA",16,59,3,3.0,1/30/2015,"Uniqueness in food is a major quality i'm after. There are so many places with the same type of food. I would come back for their swiss burger. The service in this specific place is good. The servers are attentive.  But like I said, i gotta try more food at this place til i'm hit with something that'll just keep calling me back. The probably plays a major factor when I'm rating a place. Who knows, i eat here again and some food on the menu item gets me to raise the ratings."
Shirrl E.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,9,2,5.0,5/25/2016,"Our server, Mark, was awesome! He brought refills when needed and was super friendly! The food was excellent as well. We ordered the bourbon street chicken and the sirloin steak, both cooked to perfection & delicious!"
Char P.,"Colton, CA",77,95,64,5.0,3/8/2015,Very clean establishment. Very generous portions. Really great price deals. Really outstanding serious for a busy Saturday night. Even the Bar was fast with making drinks. Joey our waiter was excellent. The Manager came over to see if everything was ok with our meals.
Marcy R.,"San Bernardino, CA",43,8,4,1.0,10/10/2015,"This past Wednesday  me and a couple of friends and family were celebrating a very special celebration and decided to go to applebees and enjoy some drinks , we had two drinks and one gummy bear shot each . When we tried ordering another the waiter informed us that his manager said we can not due to the fact that there is a 3 drink policy . The manager came to talk to us and was just no help, she was very rude when questions were asked and informed us that her options were to either call a taxi or the police . (* Not knowing none of us were driving*) bottom line is applebees needs to have it in fine print if this is seriously a rule of yours. I will definitely not be coming back to this location ever again . Neither will anyone I know ."
Acela G.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,14,1,5.0,10/17/2015,"This Applebee's location has amazing service, even the hostess was very kind. Food was brought out very fast and our waiter took very good care of us. Once we were ready to leave the manager walked us out and thanked us. I will definitely be coming to this location more often."
Rebecca D.,"Loma Linda, CA",0,21,17,5.0,1/5/2016,I love Applebee's. They are pretty consistent with their food. You can count on it to taste the same every time you come. There happy hour is a great time to come with lots of good deals. So many appetizers to choose from and great meal options.
Evan R.,"Redlands, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/21/2016,"Horrible, horrible, horrible.. Ordered a oriental chicken salad and the lettuce was old and discolored, the chicken was overcooked, and the beer I ordered was flat and odd tasting even though it was a local craft beer(due to lack of cleaning the tap lines). The only decent thing was the fries which I had off of someone's plate in my party in which they ordered along with some tough to eat riblets. Definitely won't be coming back. The only reason for deserving a single star was the waitress being nice and courteous.."
Claire S.,"Redlands, CA",154,5,1,5.0,6/4/2016,"*** could not post on my account so I'm posting from a friends*** I never write Yelp reviews, in fact this is my first but I figured this visit would be a great first review. For starters the service was excellent. Our server Mark made sure we were completely satisfied with our meals. I made the unfortunate mistake of order a burger that had pork in it, I dont eat pork but had told Mark not to worry about it. When my company was finished with her meal another employee named Josh I believe (super cute, colored eyes, light skin) noticed I had only taken a bite of my burger and offered to bring out a new one or comp our bill. The manager who's name slips my mind but she had short hair came out and apologized, service was great and everyone was so kind. I'm very pleased with this visit. - Sarah Gillespie"
Ross T.,"Highland, CA",2,118,88,3.0,7/16/2015,"Was hungry like a muscled up GIJoe after a long day in the chopper. Order service was prompt. Boneless wings  and ""hand battered fish"" with fries. Fries were salted like it was a prank. Were they potatoes? Couldn't taste them through the salt coating. Fish tasted like cliche frozen fish. The last time a hand battered them was probably many months ago and thousands of miles away. Wing were average with heavy honey barbecue sauce. Employees appeared to really want to serve our needs."
Darla D.,"San Dimas, CA",166,885,685,3.0,2/25/2015,This location was meh! I did have a sangria margarita which was tasty so that's why they get the three stars for the bar. Our server was busy and ended up leaving during our order so someone else took over for her. In general service was just ok and food was just ok at this location. Nothing really was tasty and seemed a bit bland. A smaller location compared to some others. The bar area seemed to be a nice size. It looked a bit run down and not so clean to me. Again my opinion. I would probably not choose to come to this location again ...
Letty O.,"Palm Desert, CA",5,94,45,1.0,7/16/2015,"We arrived for a late dinner. the waitress says she couldn't speak very well. but two tables next to us, she was speaking just fine. She was rude. we ordered soft drinks but were not impressed with her service; we walked out. but hostess or manager ran after us and asked if everything was ok. we said yes just to avoid complaining to her because we were hungry and ended up eating at IHOP which was much better."
Jessicca R.,"Rialto, CA",27,8,,5.0,2/9/2015,"5 stars for great service, Happy hour..! Thanks Marie you take good care of us..! We usually go to Riverside but changed that real quick when we came across you..! Now Redlands is our new spot...!! :)"
Kamille D.,"Fontana, CA",6,7,,4.0,7/21/2015,Bill (the manager ) was the best part about my visit to this apple bees ! I could not Have asked for a better manager to come to my table . Bill was very professional and I really really appreciate his help
Paul A.,"Redlands, CA",22,21,28,1.0,1/2/2015,"I've been coming here for years normally I have little minor issues but since its the only one near me I suck it up and still come UNTIL now..bought the whole family over for a new years eve dinner,the service was ok and the food was typical nothing to brag about anyway they really screwed me later that night, they charged me twice on my bill which happens that's not that issue, the PROBLEM was when I called them to fix it, they gave me the run around with fake ass numbers to call and excuses as to why it happened.. I didn't care why or how it happened all I wanted was my money..so after all that s**t I gave up and just called my bank to block those charges and got my refund through my bank and have them deal with Applebee's.. Anyway I'm done and never going back..which is too bad because I'm a great tipper."
Christian P.,"Loma Linda, CA",3,40,122,5.0,6/28/2015,"Really good service. The food is good. The service is fast. And whenever they give us the wrong order, they prepare the correct food fast. I would recommend this restaurant."
Jay N.,"Loma Linda, CA",79,75,133,3.0,6/5/2014,"Okay service, okay food, but the mango lemonade was refreshing! I don't have anything to complain about, just a regular restaurant chain so don't expect too much."
