John R.,"Redlands, CA",6,11,4,5.0,12/4/2013,"Food was good, but our server Katie H. was a true blessing tonight for my wifes B-Day.  She made the end of a good day great. Thanks, so much."
Jennifer T.,"Riverside, CA",0,11,1,4.0,4/17/2015,"I closed the book on Applebee's years ago, but my man talked me into coming this evening with the promise of interesting bar food during late happy hour. Our server, Brandon, made our visit an excellent experience. I really enjoyed the 1/2 price margarita and we sampled a number of their new appetizers. The brisket nachos were a winner. We'll be back for late night foraging."
Jerry Z.,"Redlands, CA",14,15,2,5.0,8/19/2015,"I don't know why this Applebee's is only a 3 star average.   Drinks, food, and service were great!  Napa chicken for me  and Thai salad for the wife  Both delicious!"
Kirari S.,"Colton, CA",303,181,691,3.0,3/3/2012,"This place is always the hang out at night. But at lunch it's pretty good for it's price and if your looking to count your calories and/or on weight watchers.   This place is like a step above Denny's/IHOP and below BJ's. So in essence, it's like a Red Robin or Chili's. While some people think that all American food is the same everywhere, it's not.   Every time I've been here the service has been good. It's not like they drop off the face of the earth but it's not like they come every 10min checking up on you either. Their lunch menu is good and is decently priced. This time around I tried their Weight Watchers menu and had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with rice and spinach. It wasn't bad. The spinach was a bit dry (on top) and had no taste so I had to squeeze lemon on it and mix it around so it got all moist again. The chicken was juicy and a good size and was pretty good. It's made for WW points so don't expect like major uber flavor. It's chicken that was seasoned well and had flavor (but something that can be made at home for a lesser price).  In my previous visits the spinach and artichoke dip is always good and for sharing.  This place is great for late night happy hours (for those $5 silver shots) and appetizers and great for big parties. And just to let some know: Chili's uses boxed Velveeta mac n cheese and a majority of their food is never fresh and always frozen. I've heard so from the employee's who work there and don't even eat there. Also the cooks are not trained cooks. At least at Applebee's I've had better food for cheaper price."
Jerome D.,"Forest Falls, CA",0,3,1,3.0,7/12/2014,Great place never go wrong with the 2 for $20. Bourbon steak kicks ass cheesecake chimichangas awesome. Service is great people are friendly
Brian K.,"Division No. 1, Canada",46,53,16,4.0,11/1/2014,"Great host at the front.. very friendly and checks back at your take to make sure everything is well.. the food is better than other Applebee's I've been to.. I'm not giving 5 because the waiter was a bit forgetful, I had to repeat what I wanted few times but other than that it's all good.. nice dinning experience. Will definitely come back."
Nikole G.,"Ontario, CA",8,3,1,1.0,4/18/2015,Really bad service even on a Saturday in the early afternoon. Food was gross. Mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box and the steak tasted like it cam from the dollar store or something. Will not be coming back.
Armand W.,"Riverside, CA",31,20,6,4.0,3/7/2015,"For an Applebee's this was a great night!  The appetizers were extremely good, the drinks well pored and the dinner was good.  Our waiter, Joey, was attentive and enjoyable!"
Carolyn R.,"Riverside, CA",10,170,93,4.0,11/26/2014,"Not a general fan of Applebee's anymore, but I had a gift card. Haven't been here in years, and it seems they've tried to change things up a bit. Were there for Happy Hour, so can only speak to that. Appetizers were 1/2 off with great drink specials! Chicken quesadilla was excellent and had enough for leftovers. Wedge salad was nice, service was fine. Restaurant was clean and well managed, so honestly, I'm thinking of visiting Applebee's more often, especially during Happy Hour."
Collin H.,"Yucaipa, CA",75,4,5,4.0,5/27/2015,Service was excellent! Joey did a great job and took good care of us. Food was excellent!
Haylee E.,"Redlands, CA",178,218,3,4.0,7/20/2014,"Applebee's has really cool lunch specials! They have a two item combo option, and various soups, salads, sandwiches, and pastas to choose from. The service is always great. I come here for lunch from time to time, and it doesn't take much longer than 30 minutes for me to enjoy a meal here."
John D.,"Yucaipa, CA",6,53,26,5.0,9/19/2014,"Not trying to be snobby,  but I'm usually not a fan of Applebee's,  but they were open late one night,  so we gave it a shot. This particular store in Redlands blows away the other Applebee's in the vicinity.  The food is cooked perfectly and actually very tasty for corporate food and Joey is an excellent server. if you have given up on other Applebee's restaurants, give this one a shot. They try so much harder,  really make you feel like family and will have you wanting to come back soon. Make sure that you ask for Joe's section.  He is always right on point."
Mandy N.,"Colton, CA",74,51,554,5.0,6/11/2014,"After a horrid experience at Buffalo wild wings tonight,  we ended up at Applebee's. Which happens quite often,  MOSTLY because I get treated like crap everywhere else,  but here,  it's like cheers. Everybody knows your name (or at least your face! ) I can't even say how many people on staff are just amazing. Amanda and jess at the bar are simply amazing. Armando the manager,  very welcoming,  always makes it a point to come say hello. I'm ALWAYS greeted with a happy face. Being in the service industry myself,  that means the world to me. I only want to be treated the way I treat my clients. (Like you have some importance in someone's life! )"
Steve G.,"Redlands, CA",0,5,,3.0,12/14/2015,Food isn't close to the pictures. Ordered beer pretzels came with a small cup of cheese different than advertised. When asked about another cup of cheese they informed my it would be $2 extra. Wouldn't mine the extra but that's excessive for a $7.50 appetizer. The manager Heather came up to our table and seem very concerned about our meal. She apologized for the mistake and made things right. We will go back again. Change my star rating to three
Isaac L.,"Colton, CA",86,1,,5.0,6/24/2014,"Been coming here since I turned 21 and it's always been great. Great customer service specifically Hala and Katie and very fun and social manager that engages with her customers to make them feel at home, thank you for that Brittany. The food is always good and the place gives a clean feel over all, recommend for anyone in the area."
Cassie J.,"Los Angeles, CA",105,33,2,4.0,5/4/2012,"First, I wanna say CHILLIS IS NOT ALL THAT everybody seems to big up chillis like it is the end all and be all of restaurants in redlands. I went there with family and my experience wasnt worth the hype. It  was second best because we couldnt Applebees that day.  We was already in the area of Chillis. Chillis look like a abandoned old ass ship from the little mermaid. I will save the other comments for the Chilli's review. Now on to Applebees :), So me my daughter and sister went to Applebees and we had a good time. Decor is nice the atmosphere was up to my standards. Lots of festive colors and lighting, the bar in the middle. The plasmas up everywhere showing the lakers game, what more can you want. The appetizers were awesome, my favorite is the potato thin crisps with the spinach aritchoke dip, the boneless buffalo wings, Of course we did the 2 for 20 deal. The meals was good on my end, except my sister ordered a steak and it wasnt fully cooked, basically not as it was advertised. But the staff was cool about it and didnt interrogate my sister. They simply came over and apologized and gave her a second order and it turned out to be of her liking.  They didnt charge us twice.  HAPPY HOUR IS ON POINT! 3 bucks for cocktails such as long islands long beaches and stuff I enjoyed that very much :)  it wasnt watered down. OH YEA WE CAN ACTUALLY DRINK AT THE TABLE UNLIKE CHILLIS' WHERE YOU CAN ONLY DRINK AT THE BAR! wtf The staff had good chemistry with each other as well as the customers. It seem like the manager knew the ppl personally and went to their tables and held meaninful and cordial conversations Never treated us any kind of way, very considerate. We came few more times after that , still was great service despite the busyness of the restaurant. We will be coming back again really soon. They should know us by name and faces by now."
Virginia S.,"Pinon Hills, CA",38,2,,5.0,10/16/2015,They are the best . . . go out of their way to please even with special requests.  Best waitress is Adelma and the manager is special too!  I highly recommend them.
Jackie H.,"Long Beach, CA",0,24,6,5.0,5/3/2015,"It was a great experience. My first time visiting this location. Every team member that we came in contact with said hello and was friendly. We got seated right away and our server was there in seconds. Our order was taken and our drinks came out quickly and our food followed shortly, which tasted great, the drinks could use a bit more alcohol or more flavor. They had happy hour and they have one of the cheapest happy hours out there. I had no complaints. The manager even stopped by a few times to see how we were doing . I liked it there because the employees walk by you acknowledge you and are not afraid that you might ask them for something, like a simple refill or extra napkins."
Juliet K.,"Mentone, CA",11,74,5,2.0,1/4/2014,"Just horrible service! After waiting for 30 minutes after we were told 10-15, we noticed that they took 2-3 party's to be seated before us even though they came after us and when we asked, we saw that he crossed our name off and we were not even seated! I understand that accidents happen but for the guy to not even offer an apology is just terrible! The manager did not seem to care either. The food was was not even hot and it was just microwaved frozen food. This place is a waste of money!   I will never eat an an Applebee's again!"
Fidel M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",67,15,1,1.0,10/22/2013,"Normally I get good service at Applebees, however at this location the service was sub-par. It was a slow Monday night, that should have meant even better service than normal. However, although seated at the bar tables, our party was not greeted at the door, we seated ourselves and the waiter did not offer menus. We ordered from the happy hour flyer that was on the table. I had to wave down the waiter to get a refill on my drink. Although I left a tip, it was not one that was deserved."
