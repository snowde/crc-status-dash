Xihuateteo M.,"Redlands, CA",42,57,108,4.0,1/18/2014,"Service was good even though it was packed inside. Ordered the steak medium-well and came out decently good. Overall the food was good although my meal looked like it was burnt, lol."
Paula K.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,17,,3.0,1/13/2012,"Friendly service, they were short staffed so the wait to get our food was a little long. Don't know if this is a regular thing or not at this location.  Meals- we had the bacon cheeseburger and substituted the onion rings. Burger was thick and juicy, bacon was a little overcooked but overall thumbs up. Onion rings were limp and worn out looking. Tasted alright but not worth paying extra for. Caesar salad was excellent. Just the right amount of creamy dressing and thinly sliced pieces of Parmesan cheese. Rivals what you get in much more expensive restaurants. Definitely worth the extra $2.50.  I ordered from the under 550 calorie section. 7oz sirloin steak was tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. Came with some roasted potatoes and a big mushroom with with a creamy spinach filling. It was perfect when you don't want a heavy meal. This place is perfect when you feel like a casual ""I just want to sit down and get something to eat that is not fast food"""
Mike C.,"Houston, TX",471,299,292,3.0,12/30/2008,"The GF and I were pleasantly delighted to find that Applebee's has a great $5.99 lunch menu (mon-fri).  She starved me that morning because she wanted to beat the holiday traffic on our journey from San Diego; so I was good n hungry when we arrived.  When our hostess handed us the menu, she was quick to point out the $5.99 combo special.  They all looked yummy in the pictures.  You can mix and match them too.   ""Create your favorite combo. Choose a soup and salad, soup and sandwich, salad and pasta-whatever pair you love."", Applebees menu. I ordered the Three-Cheese Chicken Penne + Caesar Salad.  The salad was typical but the penne was delicious.  I could have easily gone for another plate just for the taste.  I was surprized though how I was satisfied from my combo.  I was thinking, ""Ain't no $5.99 lunch special gonna satisfy me unless it comes with a free prime rib steak"".  But yes, I was full and happy that I didn't bust my diet. The GF had the Tomato Basil Soup + Grilled Shrimp 'N Spinach Salad.  I tried so hard to resist gobbling her salad; it was so damn good.  Next time I'm gettinnat fosho.. fosho!  Oops, just had a Superbad moment. Only beef I have is with my waitress.  She was one of those, ""Hurry up people.  Eat your food and get the hell outta here so I can stand around in the back of the room and BS with my co-workers"".  It was lunchtime on a Wednesday so you know the restaurant was less than half full.  My waitress started removing my plate while I still had food in my hand.  She also never refilled my water.  Grrrr.  Oh well.  I guess they all can't be like Flo.

Jaime V.,"San Bernardino, CA",3,4,2,3.0,2/9/2014,The server was great. The second one that came that is. The food was not so good though. Love the happy hour menu Lol.
Kristen M.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,9,6,1.0,4/12/2015,"DON'T EAT HERE!! Service was great!! Food was absolutely horrible. Kids Mac n cheese was dry and disgusting looking. Carrots were white and dried out. We didn't want our kid to eat that crap. We were served old mushy fries. Even the manager commented on how bad they looked. ""Melted"" cheese BLT had unmelted cheese and half a head of lettuce on it. (How do you screw up a BLT??)  Talked to manager, brought us a new one which was exactly the same. Offered us a free dessert. Got the kid a vanilla shake. At least that wasn't messed up. Surprisingly! Gave the extra BLT to a homeless man sitting outside. Tried to make something good out of this bad experience."
Araceli R.,"Riverside, CA",0,1,,5.0,3/28/2014,"I had the best service ever! Our server was Alexis, she was great and pleasant. I will be definitely be going back! Thank you so much!!"
Ralph O.,"Chino Hills, CA",253,620,67,3.0,8/31/2012,"I've come here several times, the last time I came here I got the berry and spinach salad for lunch.  Besides spinach, the salad had blueberries, strawberries, grilled chicken, blue cheese, and pecans with a strawberry vinegairrete as the dressing. I have to say this was a very good salad, the only complaint I have is I wish they had more chicken.  They offer a full and half portion, I got the full portion as decided by the waitress.  I guess I looked hungry. Service was still good overall, food came out timely and my drink was refilled.  Price was on the high side but I think everyone is raising their prices due to the high gas prices."
Sam O.,"Orange, CA",129,272,100,1.0,7/13/2010,"Q&D:  One step above my microwave. Long & Blah: Applebee's will never be Chili's, no matter how hard they try.  Their menu is eerily similar to Chili's and I don't think that is a good thing.  I love Chili's food and think they have some great stuff, but Applebee's took their ideas and made them worse. I don't currently work in customer service but I have worked in restaurants for over ten years and most of those jobs were at corporate style Applebee's-esque type places and I can tell you that it's not an easy job.  The managers make you memorize scripts, you are always afraid of being ""Shopped"" by a secret shopper, and you have to kiss ass constantly so as to not get a complaint, it sucks!  That is why I feel for the workers at this place. As soon as you walk in to this place you can feel the cheese, and I'm not talking food here.  The staff has been programmed so much that there isn't any feeling left in ""Welcome to Applebee's!""  They should have a robot up there to do it or an automated sound that say's it when you open the door.  This happens at every level too.  The servers are sing-songy and talk to you like you are a retarded child.  The managers are just as bad and seem beaten down and abused by forever having to lick the tangy buttholes of geriatric seniors on a Sunday, it's sad. The food here is not very good but it's not bad either.  It would be nice if there was some FRESH chef specials that were offered that you could only find at that store.  It's sad that you can't get anything unique at an Applebee's.  Everything they have has already been done by Chili's, TGIFriday's, CPK, (insert corporate chain here).   I'm no snooty Foodie, I mean I like fried crap just as much as the next guy but Applebee's can suck it!  I don't understand how they stay in business.  The people that work here are good people and it's not their fault, it's the upper management that is really retarded.  Can't they see that people want something other than what they think we want?   Would I go here again?  Oh, I hope not. Should you go here?  Only if you are forced at gunpoint. How you like them apples? Sam"
angelica g.,"Inglewood, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/6/2013,Applebees Was my #1 place where i would hang out with my pals n family.. Food is great cant lié about that..good service always too..

Bullshit dont know what is the reason
Nahathai C.,"Redlands, CA",4,27,18,3.0,8/31/2014,"Mark is a very genuine server, although it took a while to get our water refilled. The food is consistent a 3/5. The manager however...... always show up at the wrong time--not when We're waiting for our drinks, our food, but always when we JUST got the food that we are waiting for, interrupting our conversations, and they must have had a lot of cheap customers as they always comp out meals and repeat FREE FREE FREE when something goes wrong. No, I didn't want my appetizer for free.. I just want the RIGHT order."
Gretchen H.,"Panama City, FL",28,138,11,3.0,5/20/2012,"It's okay, and the service is ok. The waitress really need to invest in Deodorant. Man we were her first table and she was already smelly. So i feel bad for anyone else who had her. She was nice but slow and stinky. The food was quick and not bad for the price.....but i really would say the service was good..."
Brian H.,"Redlands, CA",0,4,,5.0,12/14/2014,"My wife and I are regular customers this is our favorite place to eat after work we love the servers all except for the one we had tonight,her name was Hala couldn't quite hear her because of the brief interaction we had with her; she was not very attentive and seemed to be bothered by us so tonight service got 2 stars. I wouldn't recommend coming on Sunday nights when their top servers are off duty."
Elwood S.,"Los Angeles, CA",84,53,110,4.0,11/22/2012,I would say that this Applebee's is on par with other Applebee's out there.  The food is allright but not anything to boast about.  The fish is decent and the steak is ok.  The ambience is a little loud because everyone is having a good time I guess.  One thing where they could improve on is the service and wait times--it gets quite slow especially during lunch and dinner.
Gabriel R.,"Colton, CA",5,4,,3.0,5/15/2013,Food was good. Service was good but employees need to discuss their operations strategy not in front of customers especially when customers are trying to get a table. Management need to step it up.
Robert S.,"Riverside, CA",13,9,2,1.0,7/20/2014,"Went to Applebee's on 7/19/14 for lunch with my gf and her daughter...it started with the waitress screwing up the kids order, then they bring out two salads that were suppose to be covered with chicken, avocado and strawberries...it looked like a pile of grass trimmings with a couple of everything. I told the server that I was very disappointed in the two salads and showed her the picture from the menu of what it was suppose to look like...she disappeared for like 10 to 15 minutes as I was sitting there waiting for her to bring me more toppings so I could get what I paid for...we waited so long that we lost our appetite before the manager finally came over to say they were making us another salad. I refused the replacement and we just left. This Applebee's has always been inconsistent with it's food and service. The only thing worth going here for is drinks, other than that it's a crap shoot on eating there. Won't eat there again."
Eric O.,"Colton, CA",17,108,1,1.0,7/2/2011,"Avoid if possible. Went here for a work party, I enjoyed the company, but the food seemed like it was just reheated. Nothing special at all."
Lil D T.,"Upland, CA",0,10,,4.0,10/15/2012,We didn't have a server for a while and the manager gave us a discount. Made for a nice time here. Thank you
Sherry S.,"Colton, CA",0,94,,4.0,8/2/2013,"Went tonite a Friday nite, very attentive hostess. Got seated right away and was sorry I missed Happy Hour wish they had it until 7 instead of 6 pm. Dinner was good, the manager stopped by great customer service."
Matt S.,"Portland, OR",17,13,,4.0,8/28/2010,"As someone who works until about 11 o'clock every night, it's very difficult to find somewhere to sit down and eat that is not fast food. Applebees is open until midnight or later every night and serves good food at a reasonable price. Their happy hour is great! Cheap beer and quick food that won't break the bank. The Redlands Applebees has a great staff that is very friendly. I'd definitely recommend this location to anyone that is craving some late night food and drinks!"
Fred Z.,"Angelus Oaks, CA",0,8,2,1.0,11/19/2013,"worst food, horrible dirty mens bathroom, toilet had caulking smeared all over the bottom, dirty inside, floor had caution cone inside, will not be back to the Redlands applebees, they won't be in business very long!  only about 3 tables had people eating, my wife got sick, and is still sick.  Horrible experience"
