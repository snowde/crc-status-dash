Avery M.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,7,,3.0,8/13/2017,"My lunch at Applebee's was alright. Our server was okay, but not very friendly. The food took a surprisingly long time for being relatively empty on a Sunday lunch.  The only huge complaint I have is that they were playing some show that was slightly disturbing during our meal.  It showed murder and blood spattering onto character's faces. Interesting!"
Sydney C.,"Cotati, CA",176,8,8,1.0,10/7/2017,"I give MOST of the staff 5 stars!! So cheers to ALL of you ESPECIALLY Carolyn the bartender last night 10/6/17. She not only keeps us coming back as often as we do. But with this $1 margarita promotion/fiasco she kept her cool and made sure we had everything we needed and that we were happy as could be the whole time we were there.  Now, the reason it's NOT a 5 star review and it's only 1 is because the manager last night, Socorro, did not do anything to make our experience better or worth coming back in all honesty. 1 her attempt of helping was more damaging then if she had not even tried..because she started to confuse everybody else and then makes their jobs harder. 2 my arm had hit my margarita glass and the 1/4 of the drink that was left in the glass had spilt on the counter top. (Oops!) She stood there and watched me while I was cleaning it up with one white little napkin... until I rose my arm and asked her if she could assist me by getting me more napkins, sense she was just standing and leaning on the bar spacing out doing nothing while EVERYONE ELSE was bussing there butts! She then wiped it down, but didnt even offer to grab me another drink! I also want to be very clear, I WAS NOT trying to get anything for free... but an offer to get a paying customer at THE BAR for another drink would have only made sense right?  Side note: Socorro turned down a group of people who wanted to order about 10 shots of patron..... she also made them feel like they were being the problem by asking for that quantity of shots.. even though they were a big group. You could tell the one woman talking to her seemed very offended and confused. now that's just blowing off business and loosing money... Now, back to when we first arrived. She wrote our names down, my boyfriend and myself, then walked away. After waiting about 20 minutes (which we had no issue with the wait. It was crazy busy. We get it.) BUT THEN a group of 3 walked in and ends up knowing some employees there or maybe even worked there, but IMMEDIATELY got sat and skipped the wait that about 10 other parties were patiently and fairly waiting for.  I've been in the serving industry for almost 10 years, so I get that if a coworker or close friend that comes in and if you can possibly sneak them in and have them skip the wait, then do it. Depending on the circumstance. Let me just say this was NOT the right circumstance lol. & To do it in front of ALL the people waiting AND to do it after looking at the reservation sheet seeing me and my boyfriends name next, but not knowing or seeing our party size (2) is not okay. Due to Socorro not doing her job..I politely approached the host after my boyfriend walked out and told the host to take us off the list and brought it to her attention how I noticed she allowed her friend/coworker to sit first... she was apologetic asked for my name and saw my name was next but didn't know the party size, but immediately said she could seat us right away. which all comes back to Socorro not doing her job effectively and writing down that one detail.  Not to mention while I was waiting to speak with the other manager on the floor that night, I over heard multiple servers complaining about Socorro being more of a hassle then helpful. I was informed she was new to FOH managing and usually manages in the back of house. But from the experience I had last night with her ""running"" things and being in charge and ""trying"" to help may not be a good fit and didn't allow us to have our usual great/smoothly ran experience.  We love Carolyn and Jason! Those two are the reason we will continue to come and give our business! So make sure to give them a huge high five from the both of us!  I usually never take the time out of my day to write this long of a feedback or any feedback in general whether it be good or bad. But in this case, it needed to be communicated. And it's also about time I give my two fav Applebee's employees a great shoutout! GO JASON AND CAROLYN!"
Mark H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/12/2017,"I NEVER write Yelp reviews so you can believe me when I say this is the worst place I have ever been served at. It's sad to see that in times like these, where one's home has been destroyed and all we need is a place to eat, that there are people like Socorro R running this place that refuse to serve a meal. I'm appalled and disappointed that THIS is the only Applebees that people can now go to."
Michele B.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,13,,2.0,11/14/2017,Went to meet a friend for the so called Happy Hour not so happy 2 cranberry Sky vodka in maybe a 8 oz glass one IPA and a house margarita over 30$$  Ridiculous never again
Lorena C.,"Rohnert Park, CA",3,54,10,5.0,3/18/2017,"This Applebee's is the best I've ever been to. I always get great service and great food! Mitchell and Carol are great at the bar, so attentive and always there to refill my drink :)"
Bridget C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,4,5,1.0,8/22/2017,Applebees is always a hit and miss. Its either alright food or just bad. I got food poisoning there and it was the sickest I have ever been. I will never eat there again!
Oliver G.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,15,,5.0,5/15/2017,"The service and food here is really good. This applebee's can get busy, and Ive been there several times when they were busy and they have a very good staff. They always manage to work well under the stress and pressure. The food has also been very good, fresh, hot. Sometimes....not so much for the fries, but no biggie. Had very good drinks. The servers are very good about getting the discounted prices too for happy hour. Never had an issue over charge. Really, I keep going back cause it's all so well done."
Paul P.,"Rohnert Park, CA",29,147,1070,3.0,12/19/2016,Not bad the portions or not as I expected them to be could be better just three stars this time better luck next time
Mary B.,"San Rafael, CA",0,83,26,4.0,10/18/2016,Our waitress was sweet and adorable. Our dinner took a long time to get although it was very quiet in the restaurant. The food was good but very salty chicken and roasted potatoes were not hot enough. My husband had the ribs and was very happy with them.
Shayna O.,"Rohnert Park, CA",46,47,10,4.0,10/9/2016,"You know, I'm not a huge fan of Applebees, personal reasons and I'm not gonna bore you with that.  But last night, I was pretty impressed and satisfied with how well they handled our group (about 30 of us, unannounced). We all came for a post show celebration and were all hyped and starving! Yeah, food and drinks didn't necessarily come out in order, and we were waiting for our orders for a good amount of time, but hey! 30 people! You gotta expect that. Food was delicious! Sangria scrumptious and strong!  A huge shout out to Ryan for keeping his cool, same with the rest of the staff who got our people fed and kept them jolly! This was a great experience, better than my past experiences at an Applebee's.  Thank you!"
Chuck D.,"Rohnert Park, CA",1,37,,1.0,7/27/2016,"Have not been to Applebee's in a long time because we did not like the food. Well, it still sucks. Ordered a classic hamburger and got a hamburger with over cooked meat on a small bun and all of the fixing were on the side instead of on the burger as I expected it to be. We are done with Applebee's!"
Violeta G.,"Rohnert Park, CA",2,45,1,1.0,2/4/2017,Ordered food for pick up and the service there sucks. 2 meals were missing from our bags and when we informed the waitress she kept insisting that food was in the bags. We took out the boxes and showed her that was not true. Paid extra for onion rings which you get 5 small rings Manager basically gave us 5 dollars back on my giftcard which I am just going to toss since this place is a joke. Got home and the wonton tacos that were suppose to be steak were chicken. Smh never again.
melissa b.,"Petaluma, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/27/2017,"Ordered almost an hour ago and still haven't gotten our meal. Claim they are having ""internet problems"". Since when do you need internet to cook the food?!?!"
Jason Z.,"Petaluma, CA",156,305,184,2.0,11/29/2014,It's not good at all.  Real c rap of food. It's a shame how lame this place is. I would be horrified if I came back.  Te food blows so bad and the monkey service blows too.  What a waste of time and money. Don't come here. It's white t all the way. They should be ashamed on who over runs this place. Good lord it is bad.
Kirito A.,"Rohnert Park, CA",2,25,14,2.0,2/7/2017,"For an Applebee's it wasn't that bad, but the food took a really long time. My wife's dinner came out room temperature, so they microwaved the plate. The server was friendly, but not impressive food at all. Probably will not go to any Applebee's for a long time."
Keith N.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,13,7,5.0,3/5/2017,Great service and good drinks. Love mushroom burger... And looking forward to coming back with my family next sunday.
Mama L.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,19,,1.0,1/14/2017,I was very disappointed with the food and service. Applebee's was good in the past with their old menu. The new menu is just awful. The waitresses are slow and behave as though they would rather not work there. The drinks are so bad and over priced!
Ray L.,"Sebastopol, CA",28,426,54,3.0,2/19/2016,"This is a great middle of the road meal. Way better than Denny's but not a high class place either. Meals are decent, service usually pretty good and prices well worth it. A must try is their frozen mudslide. YUMM!"
Hiroko O.,"San Francisco, CA",9,3,1,4.0,1/16/2016,"Wow I don't understand why everyone hates this place. I have only been to an Applebee's maybe once about a decade ago, but my husband got a gift card here so we had to use it. I looked up the reviews here to get some recommendations and saw everyone just hated it here! So I was expecting crap food and horrible service but I got the opposite. I walked in on a fairly busy Saturday night and was immediately greeted at the door by a friendly host. I told them I was looking to order something to take home and they gave me a menu to look at and a few minutes later a friendly girl named Caty came over. She was really patient and gave me great recommendations. I told her I had a $25 gift card and with her help I got out of there for $25.54, perfect :) As I waited, I was asked at least 3 times if I had been helped yet by obviously busy waiters who just happened to see me on their way to the kitchen, but they took the time to stop and make sure I was taken care of. There were quite a few people running around. I saw many waiters checking in on guests at tables to make sure everything was alright, all of this completely contrary to what other reviews on here have said. Granted, I did not stay in and dine at a table, but there isn't a whole lot to do while waiting for food so I just people watched and saw all around great service. Caty was especially friendly and attentive. I didn't wait too long for the food and when I got home and ate it with my husband we were both pretty happy with it. I wouldn't say it's the greatest food in creation but it's pretty damn decent. I'm especially a fan of their many options of flavored ice teas that don't seem to be sweetened very much, if at all. Perfect for someone like myself who doesn't drink soda and tries to stay away from overly sweetened drinks. And all the beverages were only $0.99. The only negative thing I could possibly say is that they have a special to go entrance that I parked in front of, but the door said ""use other entrance,"" so I walked all the way around to the front only to be told that I should have in fact gone in through the to go door. Pretty silly but now I know. I didn't mean to write so much, and I don't super love the place, but it really doesn't deserve some of these other reviews so I just rambled on sorry xD"
Cobra M.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/28/2017,"Let me clear my throoooaaat. Order the make your own masterpiece with the ribs...ended up getting dry half rack and dry potatoe and three pieces of veggies.....i make better masterpieces on the toilet. I asked the server ""you only get half a rack for 19.99??"" He responds with ""its all we had preped"" translation....ribs been sitting and we dont wanna open the new box of frozen ones. Ive had more meat in a can of denisons chili... they did give me my ""fresh , other half rack...still dry and masked with sauce....atleast the beer was good.... this is why tips are overrated"
Melissa T.,"Sebastopol, CA",16,11,7,1.0,8/13/2016,I've always been aprehensive to go to Applebee's because it's usually always so slow but tonight really took the cake! After waiting 15 minutes for my drink I was told (as they set my sisters drink down) that they were out of the alcohol to make my drink...and I'm wondering why he didn't tell me this before my sisters drink came out? The point of drinking and eating is that you do it together.....duh no plates for the appetizers and 20 minutes later still no drink.....this is my very last trip to Applebee's. You won't be breaking this heart again Applebee's! Goodbye
Michael G.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",0,20,,1.0,6/24/2015,"Never again. Stopped by for a Tuesday lunch and was very disappointed. The service was bad, they tried to jack up the prices when I wanted to make a substitution, they didn't have the basics, and the food was inedible. No 1000 Island dressing? What restaurant doesn't have 1000 Island? Then, when my waitress ignored my request for a refill of tea yet again, a different waitress told me that they *did* have 1000 Island ""in the back"" but you have to ask for it.  I told her I *did* ask for it and she just shrugged. No Splenda. What restaurant doesn't have Splenda these days? I asked and was told ""Yeah we get asked all the time, but it is too expensive."" Shrug. Really? Ordered a steak but only got gristle. I couldn't finish it. No bread comes with the meal, BTW. The veggies were OK. I asked for melted butter, but got a cup of what looked like cottage cheese. At this point, I was afraid that they were spitting in my food, so I just paid and left. Look at all the one-star reviews. Why would anyone risk this kind of experience? Never again."
Sherrie C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,66,1,4.0,5/8/2016,"We stopped by after seeing a movie and wanted to try their low calorie options for dinner. I had a wonderful Thai shrimp salad. OMG it was excellent! A little overdone with the sauce, though.A little less would have been better. A nice mix of greens and the generous portion of Tiger shrimp was fresh, fresh, fresh. Only 360 calories if you can believe it! My hubby had the grilled onion sirloin and he said they cooked it perfectly, another hard trick. Hanna stopped by quite a few times to make sure we were happy and that our coffee cups were filled. We splurged and had two shooter sundaes and still felt virtuous at the end of it. Very pleased with the fast service and the clean bathrooms. Will definitely try it again!"
Trisha L.,"Rohnert Park, CA",9,29,,4.0,4/26/2016,My favourite Applebee's. The wait is close to nothing and the waiters have a good personality.
Everth P.,"Novato, CA",0,3,2,4.0,7/28/2014,I like coming here for happy hour. The price is right and the bartenders are friendly.  The boneless chicken wings are my favorite!
Adam D.,"Beaverton, OR",0,2,,3.0,7/31/2016,"Okay. I had food; a hamburger. I thought it was a good piece of food. And I had Pepsi. The fries were salty. The server, she was a person. I was hoping for a cat. And I chewed on my straw. And during me eating my hamburger I got a refill and it was Pepsi again."
Melissa H.,"Rohnert Park, CA",37,94,8,3.0,10/13/2014,"I wouldn't usually review a chain restaurant because you pretty much should know what to expect and what type of food and service you will receive but I had a really weird experience with our bartender Saturday night. We came in at 10:45, this is an hour and 15 minutes before they close. We opted to sit at the bar and the bartender could not make it anymore obvious that she was really irritated with anybody who dared show up and order something. I understand she may have been having a bad day and being a bartender is not an easy job but you have to be a little less obvious because it's not the customer's fault that you hate your job or things are a little rough. I've worked in food service and been there before, exhausted and working at a fast food restaurant at 2AM and rushing to get everything done and cleaned so I could just go home but I never treated my customers crappy as much as my job sucked. Don't treat your customer like a huge inconvenience because your customers are your wage and tip. What felt the most awkward to me was being treated as if I had come in 10 minutes before closing (we came in over an hour before closing!). I can understand why bartenders and waitresses would feel overwhelmed with having customers arrive 10 minutes before closing and expecting to have 5 star service when the employees just want to get everything done to go home on time.  To the manager, your bartender needs a little more coaching on good customer service. To the bartender, I understand you were probably tired and it was a rough day but don't make me feel like I'm a huge hassle simply because I showed up."
Tyson E.,"Rohnert Park, CA",53,71,27,2.0,3/3/2015,"Well you know it's Applebee's... So what is there to get excited about? I'm not too sure... But I figured I'd give it a try for the first time. I was tempted by their incredible pricing for steak and so I decided to give it a shot. Took avenges some of their creative drinks, enjoyed the Company, and eagerly awaited the arrival of the most inexpensive piece of beef I've ever ordered in a restaurant. Sadly, as soon as additional arrived I realize that it was not a deal but tit for tat. Probably the smallest piece of fillet that I have ever seen, with out any substantial sauce. But I thought hey for this price I'll give it a shot that's alright. But after my first bye I realized it would be my last visit to Applebee's... For food anyways. Dry and surprisingly flavorless.  I recommend coming here to take advantage of their drinks and the bar situation never for dinner... That is if your hungry for you know, food."
Joe P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",116,150,32,3.0,1/5/2016,We had little to no service when we ate here. The waiter eventually came and took our drink and food order and eventually came back with the food and drinks. At the same time. He never ever came back. I paid with the machine on the table with a gift card. Hopefully it went through. I don't know since nobody ever came by. Maybe they were short staffed that night?
Elizabeth V.,"Sebastopol, CA",73,3,,1.0,2/28/2016,"Waited forever for dinner. Small portion of actual entree, nasty tasting rice. Became ill about an hour afterwards. Next day still suffering repercussions. Service was terrible. The drink was good that's about it. I'll never eat there again ever."
C M.,"Petaluma, CA",29,20,1,1.0,5/24/2013,"This is the worst Applebee's I have ever been to. Last we were here, we were seated and 15 min later, no staff had stopped by our table. In a nearly empty restaurant. No one even noticed when we got up and left.  But, being in the area, we decided to give it another shot. Everyone has an off night, right?? Other Applebee's have decent service, so what the heck?!?  Ummmm no. Sucked again. Initial service was ok. But then our food came and our waiter disappeared. Never were we offered drink refills or asked how our meal was. I flagged another waiter down for help, who proceeded to not do what I had asked. (Seriously, you can't turn one of the 5 tvs in my line of vision to the Giants game?? Really??) Disappointed again. As was our waiter with our tip, I'm sure. Every wait person starts at 20% and adds or subtracts by the service they provide. You subtracted well, my friend."
Julia O.,"Rohnert Park, CA",71,25,1,1.0,3/20/2016,"I wish I could give negative stars as this place deserves it. I hate it here so much and avoid going but my step daughter really wanted to go so I sucked it up and hoped that maybe since its been a few years, they may have improved but it somehow got even worse. The service was very lacking. Our waitress passed us many times without checking on us, messed up our order slightly and switched me from diet to regular Pepsi when she refilled my drink. Our food was disgusting. It was actually inedible, probably the worse restaurant food I've ever had. I ordered their four cheese Mac n cheese with honey barbecue chicken tenders on top. The pasta was very overcooked and mushy, the sauce didn't taste even slightly cheesy and was just kind of slimy and the chicken was over cooked and tasted like it was just coated in honey. My son wouldn't even eat the kiddie Mac n cheese I got for him, and my husband's meal was just as disappointing. He tried to eat as much as he could but left about half his plate, and I left almost a full plate because of how horrible it was. My step daughter liked her chicken strips and fries, but that's all she ever orders and they were pretty standard chicken strips and fries... And she's the one who wanted to go there. I'm typing this review with a stomach ache from the little food I did eat and I have a renewed vow to never ever eat here again."
Tommy Rainier C.,"Rohnert Park, CA",8,21,4,4.0,1/8/2016,Only restaurant that has no wait time in rohnert park on Fridays.  lol well I guess that's a good thing food is good. Hosts are very attentive. Service could do better.
Alexa M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,18,5,1.0,3/4/2015,If I could I would give this place no stars! We were waited an hour for them to take our order then had to flag a waiter down after waiting 20 mins for our drinks then 45 mins later our food finally came and it was cold and not cooked very good so we sent all our food back and asked for a discount and they refused to give us one. We're never going back and I don't recommend you going here either.
Gianni M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",659,51,11,1.0,1/18/2015,Well I tried one more time and it was just as bad. Horrible service and crap food. Applebee's I'm done with you.
Shireen H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",15,18,6,1.0,5/21/2015,After being stuck in traffic for an hour we got hungry and thought it would be a good idea to stop at Apple bee's for dinner.  The place was busy...we are a party of 5.  The girl said we would have to wait 15 minutes.  We saw a booth available and asked the girl...she told us no...that table is for 7 people...and we would have to wait for a table.  In the meantime a party of 3 was seated....a party of 4 was seated...we were waiting and no party of 7 was showing up.  I've never heard of a restaurant holding seats like that.  A party of 7 on a Friday night would expect to wait for seating.  Crazy that this booth is empty and we are waiting! We are not impressed with the service.  Disappointed so far...
Melanie S.,"San Francisco, CA",89,16,4,1.0,10/4/2015,"Stopped by for lunch. The service was horrible. Once we got seated, the waiter came by to take our drink order. Took him another 15-20 to come back to take our lunch order. We ordered an appetizer (breadsticks) another waiter brought it over. We asked him for napkin and plates. He walked away and right when I looked up he was at another table taking an order so I walked up the the front to ask the lady for napkins and plates. Still nothing. Already 20 mins trying to get some napkins. So a manager walked by, I asked her for the same things and she brought it right over. But really? 3 different people just for some damn napkins and plates? I definitely will not be returning. Applebee's, words of advice....Pick up the pace and never mess with hungry people."
Haley M.,"Rohnert Park, CA",2,9,4,5.0,1/14/2015,This place has really changed for the better. New food  on the menu and some what decent service. Been going here for a long time and used to not be a fan now I go here regularly. It's a college hang out place for sure but an awesome late night place.
Jeff S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,9,,1.0,3/20/2015,"The chicken was moldy less than 18 hours after dinning in. The only explaination is that my take-out must have been cooked and then refrigerated for a few days. Do not to eat there, unless you like getting sick..."
Tina H.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/22/2016,"We got the 2 for 25. Ordered the spinach artichoke dip and 4 cheese mac and cheese with tenders and the half rack of baby back ribs. The spinach artichoke dip was serve just below room temperature and with stale chips. Somehow they manage not to have any flavor in the 4 cheese macaroni,  and also served at a below room temperature. The Ribs were dry and fries that came with were the most amazing shade of white. Every table around us was having food sent back for issue with their plates as well. Save your $25! Terrible food and staff."
