Susie W.,"Penngrove, CA",2,9,,2.0,12/6/2015,Just needed to eat! Ugh!  Zucchini was spoiled all the way through!  I pointed it out and was told it was grill marks. I'm 71. I know grill marks!  There were corn kernels and onion rings in my wedge salad!  Come on Applebee's pay these people and up what could be good''. Our server Kelly was good!
Kira W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",90,104,28,2.0,8/18/2012,"I think our bartender was hungover but the service was just plain frustrating today. We were starving after dealing with consumer hell in Rohnert Park and desperately needed quick nourishment to keep going (and a beer to wash it down with). Our bartender was very out of it. He was about to take our food order when the phone rang - so he took the phone call while we waited. After the phone call he ignored us for about five minutes (we were sitting right in front of his computer terminal). We kept trying to catch his eye to remind him that we never got to place our order. I finally piped up and said, ""We're ready to place our food order,"" but he was too busy talking to the manager about some shift switch to hear me. My husband finally got his attention and we were finally able to place our order - but I think there was some palpable tension after that. I felt like we were suddenly ""rude customers"" or something. Before we sat down, there were a few items leftover from the people before us. The bartender had grabbed the glassware but never cleaned the bar area so I was sitting at someone else's sticky mess. My husband had to ask the bartender to clean up the mess so I could eat in a clean environment. I've been served by this bartender before and it was okay - which makes me think he was out of it - but Hubs and I were already on edge with the shopping hell and the service was pretty vacant."
Amelia E.,"Rohnert Park, CA",170,129,18,1.0,7/3/2014,"Came here late at night, 11:30. The service wasn't the best... She didn't seem like she wanted to service. Actually, as if she was mad that we even came in. that wasn't comforting. As soon as my boyfriend and I ate our food, we left. We came with a group of 6 people. They stayed until 12:30. Or so, the food was alright too. I learned my lesson on coming to a restaurant so close to closing.... Shit service and crap food."
John K.,"San Francisco, CA",64,68,10,4.0,10/7/2012,We have ate here a few times now over the past month or so.  We have found the service prompt and friendly. We have pretty much stuck to appetizers and drinks so far since we visit after a movie or after running errands....but the food has always been good.
Sandy P.,"Corte Madera, CA",0,10,,2.0,1/17/2015,We lunched at Applebee's in Rohnert Park today. While the help was very courteous and the food okay except my Won Aton Chicken Tacos we were so spicy I could hardly eat them.  My main complaint was my knife was dirty (quickly replace by our waitress) and after a couple of bites I realized that my plate was also dirty.  I should have said something but we were in a time crunch and I was afraid a new lunch would take too long.  No more Applebee's for me
Melissa M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/16/2015,"DISGUSTING! I was forced to give it at least 1 star. Everything was beyond over cooked, it was welded! It was also only slightly warmer than room temperature. One person in our party ordered the Oriental chicken salad and there was hardly any salad in it. It was mostly those canned crunchy noodles. The chicken on top must have been left by a previous customer, then chopped up and thrown in the ""saladless salad"". Somebody else ordered a portobello mushroom burger and she struggled to find the mushrooms. I hadn't been to Applebee's in years... ever since my mom and brother got E.coli from there. I guess all that's left to say is... Wish us luck!!"
Generation J.,"Rohnert Park, CA",189,19,22,5.0,5/20/2015,"I'm five staring this on their chocolate mousse shooters alone. It's like 50 shades of chocolate all up in your mouth.  Oreo cookie crumbles,  mousse,  whhhhipped cream and maybe a few other drizzles of deliciousness.  I come here for the dessert. Oh and maybe a strong cocktail."
Scott A.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,6,,2.0,1/13/2016,"I should give them only one star as they are not great.  Food tastes like it can out of a microwave oven.  The staff is always changing which leaves me to believe they are rough on the staff, under paid, or poorly trained to do the work.  Big chain like this should get it together."
Crystal D.,"Napa, CA",50,10,856,2.0,8/30/2012,I came her for lunch with my sister Megan. We decided to split a two for 20 with two teas. My sister and i both got the chinese chicken salad with side spinach dip that comes with chips. Meals was good just nothing spectacular but good. $16.55 meal and happy face seeing the sis at a nice place. Fast forward to me today I am mad and not happy with them. Received my credit card bill and they charged me $16.55 plus another $13.55 wtf? What's the $13.55 for? My meal was $16.55. You getting a mad call for me later.
Wayne S.,"Petaluma, CA",0,277,,3.0,8/4/2012,"We've eaten here a couple of times out of convenience.  It is located in the same shopping center as Target.  It seems to be a youthful crowd because of SSU here.  I enjoy it.   The food is good, and service is okay.  Nothing great, but we get our food in a timely manner.  Its just like every other Applebee's"
leanne d.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,13,4,1.0,6/4/2015,Service is terrible. One time was hair in wings. Next time was piece of glass in my mouth from my drink. And charged for both things. Unreal. Never go here. It's awful
Bern V.,"Tucson, AZ",10,68,20,2.0,8/15/2013,When someone else is paying sometimes you just go along. The people are nice and I wish them the best but there is nothing distinctively Nor Cal about Applebees. It's the same bland food as it is everywhere else.
Clare O.,"Cotati, CA",17,18,,1.0,2/4/2015,"Never again! Came here with my 3 year old and he started playing with the tablet on the table. Next thing I know, I'm getting charged for a disney game. The waitress kind of implied it was my fault but said the games didn't require a password. How ridiculous! Food absolutely sucked! I had the Chinese Chicken Salad and it was tasteless. My son didn't touch his dinner and he usually eats everything. What a total waste of $30+."
Shayne M.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/6/2015,"My roommate and I went to this place on a Saturday night and had the worst experience ever .It took the waitress 15 minutes to take our drink order ,after that we placed our order and waited we waited for 40 minutes to be exacted. After flagging down our waitress she  said that the kitchen crew stops cooking at 10pm to clean the kitchen .She then came out with what looked like my roommates food with her thumb in the side of the bowl .The question was asked Has this been sitting under a heat lamp while they were cleaning?  She said heathen proceed to tell us that all of food was under a heat lamp because her order got bumped again the kitchen crew was apparently cleaning as well . So Fed up we left and went to Carl's Jr"
Amanda K.,"Sebastopol, CA",3,4,,1.0,9/20/2014,"I can't post this without at least one star,it really deserves zero. This Applebee's sucks so bad! After rejecting a valid ID that banks accept everyday, the service just got worse and worse. The girl was just a bitch. Took forever to bring us water and soda! Appetizers took to long as well, I got my appetizer with my dinner!!!?!?!?? The girl didn't even apologize once for the wait. I saw people who sat down after us eat before us. Seems like the waitresses weren't fairly servicing each table. As we were not even half way through our dinners, she brought us our checks and didn't even ask if we wanted anything else or dessert! At that point I didn't feel like ordering anything from this place. The check was incorrect and She took even more time to fix it. The manager who was helping her correct it, did not apologize and neither did the waitress. This place is poorly managed. At least the rohnert park location. Horrible customer service!!! Do not go to this location. The food isn't great either."
Eric G.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,3,,5.0,5/6/2015,"Food was awesome. My waitress Erin was very courteous and brought my food and drinks out very fast. Don't go here often, and have read many bad reviews about this place, but I don't have one complaint. Will definitely go here again!"
Mel T.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/4/2015,"The food was so gross. I had the signature 9 oz steak with potatoes and veggies. The steak was so over cook I could only eat one bite. Not to mention it was a poor quality cut. The potatoes looked and tasted like they mixed instant potatoes and chucks of red potatoes together, and the veggies were still frozen on the inside. I took a bite of each and had to send it back. Normally I will suffer through a bad meal, but this was just to terrible to eat."
Clu C.,"Novato, CA",56,49,33,1.0,6/15/2013,"all THREE of our meals were cold. that's all I can really say. we ordered lunch, the three of us....everything brought to our table was cold, room temperature, including the ""soup of the day"". it really wasn't that busy..did they just forget? I will never stop at an applebees again. so terribly disappointed. I let the waitress know all meals were unsatisfactory. she apologized, she knocked a few bucks off the bill. I reluctantly paid...we barely touched our food. a serious let-down. left a restaurant HUNGRY. never again."
Wulfstan C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",21,427,,1.0,8/26/2010,"Well, I feel obligated to post a review of this place even though it's a massive chain and not the type of place I normally even think of going to, while I'm sure most people have had some experience with a branch.  This review is essentially the same for both the other Applebee's I've had the misfortune of going to - one in Salem, Oregon, and in the Natomas area of Sacramento.  I must note that the first time I went to one (Salem), I had never been and also saw nowhere else to eat at the time while the other two I went to because I was meeting others there.  I hope never to be back. This place is a chain, and pretty much a paradigm of what I detest about so many chains - cardboard, cookie cutter and horrid in every way.  First, the food is absolutely terrible, bland, salty, and characterless - mass produced crud that tastes mass-produced.  Second, much of the food is pseudo fancy, sounding like haute cuisine made available for the masses yet mass-produced crud using salt, fat, etc., to make up for anything resembling character so that one would be far better off just ordering a burger and those are utterly mediocre.  Third, the place itself (each one) is disgusting and off-putting - fake, mass-produced ""neighbourhood"" ersatz-idiosyncrasy made to look like a genuine, idiosyncratic local place that has accumulated memorabilia over the years but in reality is a cookie-cutter copy of some corporate marketing ploy.  Since it is so obviously fake, yet tries to immitate that sort of individual character, it is far, far worse than if it were a just plain, obviously no-frills diner appearance that didn't try to mask its mass-produced nature.  This place, and all Applebee's I've been to, deserve negative stars in reality.  Avoid these places at all costs."
John K.,"Virginia Beach, VA",76,41,3,1.0,7/6/2010,"I used to love Applebee's food but the quality has gone down a lot in the past few years.  I still enjoy going to have the sampler platter and some drinks.  Recently I went to the Rohnert Park Applebees with some friends from work (all of us are military).  The sampler was yummy as always and the drinks were great.   The reason I am giving it only one star is because of what happened when the bill came. As always I ask if they offer a military discount.  In the past (at this store and others) I was given the managers discount.  This time when I asked I was told ""Absolutely NO military discounts"".  I am fine with not getting a discount, but the way she said it I found to be very rude.  When I told her that I was given discounts in the past she told me that I don't know why they didn't and they shouldn't have.  If she would have had said ""I'm sorry we don't have one I wish we did"", I would have be fine with this. Is the absolutely NO military discount thing come from corporate? And its not as if I'm expecting a discount, but the attitude was all wrong. In the past I had always gotten a 10% discount, so pretty much I didn't have to pay tax.   I won't be going back to this Applebees, mostly due to the attitude from the manager."
