Christian H.,"San Rafael, CA",145,233,408,4.0,6/15/2010,"So...Hmmmm.  How, or why, does a ""Yelp Elite"" write a review for a Chain Restaurant in Rohnert Park?  Because sometimes life changes, and somehow I find myself ending up at this place because I have a 10-month-old nephew that only a place like this could tolerate.  Combine that the bonus (from marriage) another niece and nephew of about 11 years of age and 6 years of age.  Life changes. Cue Rohnert Park Applebees on a random Monday morning.  We just became a table of 5 that I would never want to have back in the day when I used to serve tables.  Baby in a high chair throwing cereal.  (Although he IS cute!).  Kids meals.  Demanding tables next to us wondering where their server is so that they can change their order after they already ordered.  Ridiculously demanding customers who don't realize that... ...This place is pretty good for what it is.  Actually, an amazing value.  I ended up getting a new item, the Sizzling Chicken Fajitas, which the quality far outpaced ""fajitas"" that are currently being served at places like Baja Fresh...which I used to love.  The Sister-In-Law had a Bacon Cheeseburger with perfect fries on the side which I couldn't help but keep stealing.  The kids had meals which satisfied them, (the one in the ""in between age"" got the Pulled-Pork-Sliders off the regular menu and was stuffed!).  The niece and nephew got some chocolate shooters for dessert which were only about $1.99 and made them extremely happy.  The total lunch bill for 5 of us was about $45...which is honestly a joke considering my history in San Francisco Bay Area Restaurants (many of them with far snobbier prices, obviously!) All the while we trashed the place (mostly the fault of our 10-month old...at least we can pass the blame on him...)...and the servers were smiling.  The hostess and the staff were ""cooing"" over the baby.  We felt at home.  Like it or not, this place had suddenly become a new part of my life.  And I actually can tell you that I like it!  The Northgate Applebee's pales to compare to this place...so now I know where to go if I want to hang with my new ""infant/toddler"" gang!"
j b.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,27,1,1.0,2/3/2013,"They have downsized. Their hamburgers used to be full and delicious. They changed their buns into a much softer, delicate bun for a much smaller hamburger patty. We were actually still hungry after the meal. Not the larger mouth watering hamburgers they used to serve. Applebee's is cutting corners and by doing so they just cut this customer out."
Rashawd H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,12,3,4.0,4/13/2013,I had the bourbon bacon blue burger. Tastes great with a blue moon. Nice dinner while watching the A's game. Waiter was good too.
Bill B.,"McMinnville, OR",0,30,,2.0,10/21/2014,"I'm giving it two stars because the service was good as was the food. We walked in at 11:30 on Saturday October 18. The restaurant had just opened at 11:00 and there was only one other table seated, My wife and I noticed that the floors had not been swept, still with debris from the night before. The tables had been bussed but were not clean. I have to wonder what the kitchen looks like. We won't be back."
Kaala S.,"Sonoma, CA",0,18,,1.0,2/8/2013,"Wow. It's Applebees- we weren't expecting much but our experience was truly awful.  When we entered the restaurant the hostess ""Rachel"" ignored us, she seemed to be busy with a family waiting near by, no problem... We waited and when she seemed to be staying at her little desk thing I made a point to make contact, smile and say hello. She said 'hi' and then turned around and wandered across the restaurant where she got silverware and seated the family. She then began gathering menus and sort of... doing I don't know what? Nothing? I've never been ignored like that- it was just bizarre! My husband and I just stood there, wondering what to do. About a minute later some guy came up and sat us.  The food was not memorable (our own fault- it's Applebees) After waiting for new sodas for our whole meal we ended up requesting our check and then our waiter brought us soda refills... and then some other guy brought us two sodas. 4 late sodas.  What the hell is going on over there Applebees? Strange. Not going back."
Lorraine M.,"Rohnert Park, CA",75,34,42,5.0,10/6/2013,Five stars for great service!  It is consistently good at this Applebee's.  I enjoy how they keep each one's decor local to the neighborhood they are in.   I had a great Margarita and the chicken fajita roll up on my last visit.  I like that I can bring the whole family.  My only complaint is how salty the food is. It tastes great but...  I always wake up the next day feeling bloated.
Summer B.,"La Grange, CA",9,6,11,3.0,1/11/2012,"Great place for a cheap priced meal and the food isn't to shabby but i wouldn't order steak there ever again cause i feel that beef should taste like beef and it tasted more like pork to me. Plus, medium rare turns out to be more on the well done side and that's been more than once. I'm a firm believer in giving more than one chance cause it could always just be an off day and serving people can be a difficult job. The service is usually great but sometimes not so much when it comes to the greeters. Its a decent enough place and i love the 2 for 20 deals but if you're looking for high class this isn't in your destination plans. Its good for kicking back and not worrying about spending an arm and a leg for not great but decent food."
Barbara R.,"Cotati, CA",7,13,,1.0,7/19/2012,"Used to go to this Applebee's a lot.  Tonight was my last visit.  Service was okay, however, the food was the worst that I have ever had!!!!  Everything was dry, and I always order the same thing.  The portions became so small, That I couldn't even share with my 5 year old, which I always do.  Every meal that we ordered was dry and we were unable to eat them, yet we were still charged for the entire meal...Not asking for a free meal, however, they should have comped something or re made our dinners."
Ann S.,"Campbell, CA",0,32,,1.0,9/21/2011,"We were looking for a place to catch dinner about 9 pm on 9/13/11.  We decided to go to Applebees because we have tried other Applebees and they have always been consistent.  Wrong!  We were greeted promptly.  Our waitperson came quickly.  From here it goes down hill.  I ordered a Sangria and it came without the garnish which our Waitperson recognized and said she would fix.  I didn't care so I told her not to bother.  I ordered the steak and potato weight watcher salad which I have ordered at other A and really like.  This one was almost inedible and if we had not been tired from driving, I would have sent it back.  Meat tough and cold.  Spinach looked like it was left over from someone else's dinner.  Disgusting!  My husband ordered a Santa Fe chicken salad which was equally bad.  Honestly!  This was the worst meal in a restaurant ever.  You would have thought with us being so hungry that anything would have tasted good.  Our waitperson also seemed to be distracted and I believe that she was disgusted with the kitchen, but didn't want to say anything to us about them.  We did not complain because again we were really tired and wanted to go back to our hotel.  It was so disappointing because we were looking forward to a glass of wine,and satisfying dinner. Let me say again that I don't feel this way about the past A that I have gone to.  My husband summed it up when he said "" they have no quality control."""
Lacey C.,"Rohnert Park, CA",2,1,,1.0,1/11/2013,Hostess sat us at a dirty table and then argued that it wasn't dirty. Then proceeded to give us an attitude. Finally moved to another table but overheard the hostess and server talking about us being picky. Just decided to leave. We will not be going back. Have given this place numerous chances and they just keep screwing up.
Jason C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,8,,3.0,8/10/2012,"Came here cause couldn't decide what to eat. Food was good, atmosphere was cool, but service could use a little work. Server took to long on drinks and didn't check back to often. At least to food was hot and fresh. Will go back if I can't decide again"
Shmuel H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",25,60,24,4.0,11/15/2009,"Good service! My friends have celebrated their events here and I must say they're  quick in accomodating a large party. Keep up the good work.  Why not 5 stars? Just not quite there... 4 is good, too!"
Jax J.,"Rocklin, CA",100,74,14,1.0,9/18/2014,"When we arrives we waited Atleast 10 mins to have a server or even be acknowledged by a bartender. Finally we were greeted and ordered cocktails which took so long that we were walking out as our drinks arrived we felt bad so decided to stay which was a very poor decision! I might add I ordered water when we ordered drinks and an appetizer. Salads came way before our app which we ordered long before our entrees. Then our app, still no water and all drinks are empty for quite sometime. Finally when the entree arrived it wasn't even close to what we ordered. At this point we are so over this visit I didn't even want my food and boxed up my daughters and husbands and just wanted to leave. So the server told me that he would take off my entree since  I didn't want it anymore. Buy what he actually did was take off a beer and a kids meal??!!!! What ever we were so happy to be done and never return or have anything good to say about Applebee's! Had a similar experience at one in the Sacramento area. A manager never came to our table or tried to make things right!?!  I work in a restaurant and I am in ahhhh that this one is still open considering there were only 3 tables when we walked in."
Kayla F.,"Novato, CA",2,14,,2.0,10/12/2013,I will not eat here again. I had eaten here a few months ago and my food was not very good but I went back again recently and it was disappointing once again. This is the worst applebees I have ever been to. They do not follow the food that is on their menu. The first time I received a burger without onions on it and was told that it did not come that way yet both the picture in the menu and other applebees have always made it like this. This happened again yesterday when I ordered a chicken dish that was supposed to come with pico de gallo. Both my friend and I ordered the same thing and neither of us had pica de gallo on our chicken. It was also covered in some kind of a mayonaise like sauce. I have ordered this from other applebees as well and it has never been like this. The food was not good. I will not come back!
Tracy H.,"Dunedin, FL",17,40,5,1.0,12/21/2011,"While I didn't expect to get something surprising from Applebee's, it is the holiday season and I was looking for an in expensive but tasty meal to share with a dear friend. The minute you enter the restaurant you are not welcomed by their greeter, If anything I found her less interested in doing her job and more focused on her phone. I don't mind if you text, if you can. at work, she obviously is not capable of multi tasking. Her rudeness is throughout any interaction she is forced to have with you. And if that wasn't bad enough should you happen to have the bad luck of getting Makayla as a waitress you can expect an attitude. She greeted us with the scribed none inventive greeting to only then rush away without even waiting for an answer. A machine would have more heart. If she hadn't proved at that first moment she didn't want to spend more time than necessary at your table she then asked if she could bring all the food at once. Then she brought the wrong order, offered me a menu so I could pick another dish out, dropped the menu and left without waiting. Mind you my friends food was in front of them. I sat and watched them eat their entire meal and had to call her back. She asked if I wanted to place another order. I WAS IN SHOCK! Was she so out of touch with what her job description is that she didn't realize the table was done eating. Serve me prepackaged frozen meal, this I expect, the attitude that rains supreme in the Rohnert Park Applebee's must be a reflection of poor management, lack of supervision or poor hiring either way if you want me to spend my money give me the experience. I would rather go to Mac Donald's."
Ben S.,"Tucson, AZ",0,5,,2.0,2/14/2010,"This applebees blows. I went here for some time until it began to go down hill about 2 years ago. Now this place is just a joke. I was dragged here today because sone friends from out of town wanted ti go. The service was fine, nothing extraordinary, but what to be expected at a casual dining place. Then the food came. I had a burger that was well done instead of medium as requested. It had 1 piece of see-through lettuce, one slice of tomato and three slivers of onion. My pickles were hidden under my fries. This brings me to my next point; the fries. I got 8 fries. That's right, 8. I counted. I looked around the table and saw generally the same thing with the rest of the orders. I paid $10 for this crap. Do yourself a favor and visit chilis a couple of miles down the road, it's totally worth the money AND they include dessert in their 2 for $20. I hope the owners read this."
Angela Y.,"Fremont, CA",36,253,22,2.0,12/22/2007,"I would say for an Applebee's, this location is above average. Our waiter was nice. We got a table fairly quickly for a Friday night. The food is average. They have a new menu and it is pretty much dumbed down to the basics. There are not many selections. The pasta was flavorless and overcooked. The burgers were average, but the fries are good. The drink menu was very limited, but they do have a bar.  This Applebee's did its job and got us in &out fairly quickly without any complaints."
Ramon V.,"CA, CA",5,114,77,3.0,1/23/2008,"If you're looking for decent food at decent prices in Rohnert Park, and you're tired of Chili's, Applebee's it is! Consistently decent food, good service, and reasonable prices."
Adam W.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/10/2013,"Very pleased with my visit, the food was quick, and good. The manager stopped by the table to make sure we were doing fine, he recommended some dishes. The baby back ribs were great, and the chicken pasta was very good too. I eat at expensive restaurants in the city plenty, and the pasta compared to many of them. I ordered a shot, and it was filed to the brim, unfortunately we missed happy hour! People are to harsh, there is plenty of bad food establishments in Rohnert Park, this isn't one of them. Waitresses were fine too, in reading some previous reviews I read about poor service from the staff, however one must remember they are in a college town, and kids serving adults seems to work about as good as it sounds!"
