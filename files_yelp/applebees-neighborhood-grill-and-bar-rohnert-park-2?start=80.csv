Peter C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",7,116,,4.0,4/29/2009,The waitresses and waiters are unassuming and friendly.  The wraps that I usaully get are usually quite tasty and cooked very well.  They fill my drinks regularly.  It seems to be fairly popular during lunch time.  There is a nice family atmosphere during both lunch and dinner.  The staff seems younger than other Applebees that I've been to.  Once I had to get takeout.  It went smoothly.

Christopher G.,"Long Beach, CA",0,10,,2.0,5/30/2009,"This place could do a lot better, the food was average, the service was average, nothing really stands out at this location.  I have had better food and service for much less. I wold think again before coming to the place again."
