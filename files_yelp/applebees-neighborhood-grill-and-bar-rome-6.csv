Olivia V.,"Mount Berry, Rome, GA",0,14,1,4.0,8/19/2017,"I had a great experience here! I came alone and my waitress was so kind. She offered helpful opinions about the food and drinks, and she didn't rush me. It really was a pleasure to dine here!! I had a lemon chicken with quinoa and rice! It was so good and the perfect portion size."
Frank B.,"Cave Spring, GA",5,131,67,1.0,1/15/2017,Stopped in after church for a quick snack/lite lunch. Ordered the nachos. Very bland and SUPER greasy (see photos) the pico is mostly onion and all that I can taste now.  The service was slow and inattentive.
Adrian B.,"Rome, GA",20,7,,1.0,6/30/2017,This Applebee's used to be really great but last time I went here I had to wait 45min to be seated I ordered a 16oz steak that was smaller than what I ordered the steak tasted like it was frozen and did not have any flavor at all when I asked is this really a 16oz steak was told yes that it's a value sized steak the waitress barely came around to refill my drink and the juke box was blasting music I could barely hear my friends talk. Also you are a steakhouse your steak should be on point and be really good if I want a steak I can go to Walmart and get my steak and grill it myself. I honestly don't see this establishment staying up and running very long if so it's just for the alcohol. Not worth the time or money I wouldn't even leave a tip
Misty C.,"Silver Creek, GA",0,11,,1.0,10/12/2017,This place has been steadily going down here for the past 3 years.  I visited there a couple weeks ago and it was the worst yet. After being seated it took 15 minutes for a server to come and get a drink order ( we arrived around 4 and there was maybe 8 tables of customers).  So we go ahead and order when she finally brought the drinks because who knows when she would have came back.   We get the food in about 30 minutes and she is never seen again.  We had to get refills from the bar and pay the check thru the bar
Samiah Y.,"Delray Beach, FL",150,70,18,1.0,6/27/2015,"After the Braves baseball game is over, restaurant options are very very slim in Rome. Needless to say we've been to this Applebees ALOT after the games end.  Literally each time we go, the service and waitresses are shitty. Occasionally the food isn't that great either. Tonight we got stuck with yet another slow waitress with horrible manners. I also watched the host ask every table around us if she could get them anything- everyone except our table. We ended up asking for to-go boxes not long after the food arrive. Our original waitress never seemed to even come back to our table (3 other waiters came by) until we asked for our check. That took another 20 minutes. It didn't help that we were seated next to a family with unruly kids (not Applebees fault- but it further put me in an irritable mood). I ended up leaving to go wait in the car before I told someone off.  We're usually pretty chill and understanding. Like, we know how it is when it's a busy/crazy night. We get it. But tonight wasn't that busy, so what's the excuse for such poor service?  I'm never coming back here again. I'm just over this place. I mean, it's clearly not going to get better. I'd rather get McDonalds or just head over to Walmart and buy ingredients to make my own damn meal! Cheers!"
Brian P.,"Orange Park, FL",0,6,,1.0,3/26/2017,"I went here for dinner and the service was below average and the food was mediocre. Besides the food and service there was also LOUD music that was playing. There was this box that you could choose your songs, and this couple picked classic rock (I don't mind) but it was blasting very loud like I was in a club. I couldn't even converse with my family. This ruined my appetite"
Jennifer D.,"Atlanta, GA",211,207,295,3.0,5/26/2013,"If you've been to one Applebee's, you've been to them all. Can I get a witness? Look, Applebee's isn't anything wonderful. It  won't knock your socks off. If you had guests coming in from out of town, Applebee's would not be anywhere near your ""Er-mer-GERD you gotta try this!"" list.  Still, it's inoffensive. It's like the Maroon 5 of restaurants. Everyone can handle it as background music, but I bet you don't know any truly rabid fans. Applebee's works the same way. Chances are even if you were traveling with a group of 200 people, every single one could find something unobjectionable on the menu. Their Perfect Margaritas come pretty close to living up to that title, and it's nostalgic for me, because when I was an undergrad at Berry, Applebee's really was the only show in town if you wanted something other than beer. The food has that familiar chain restaurant quality of tasting like it was probably frozen and warmed up, but what the hey. That'll do, Pig, that'll do."
Edward L.,"Atlanta, GA",318,371,105,4.0,5/25/2013,"So there are plenty of chain restaurants in Rome, Ga, but this place is by far the best. I have never been to. The service is by far the best. Ask for Sasha, she's the best waitress there.  If you are a college student, I suggest coming here for drinks and to enjoy half off appetizers! Their perfect margarita is the best in town!"
David M.,"Rydal, GA",0,12,1,1.0,5/30/2015,"I will never eat at the Applebee's in Rome again. Tonight me and my wife went out to have a date night. We got to the restaurant and had to wait for our waitress for 10 mins before she showed up to our table. We then ordered there new two for 8.99 appetizers. We were brought there beer cheese pretzels and had to wait on our salsa verde nachos. When we got our nachos my wife noticed that they were covered with rotten lettuce. We asked to speak to the manager who was polite, and apologetic he tried to explain that the lettuce was just heated so it looked like it was bad my wife then pointed out that the lettuce was cold to the touch. So the manager then took the nachos back to be fixed when he returned they were missing half of the toppings the first set came with. We were hungry so we let it slide. After we finished our appetizers we waited 20 mins for our main course to arrive. When our meals came I was excited to try the new brew pub philly! So I decided to dig in. I took my first bite to bite into some of the meals prep paper. I immediately requested the manager to come back. After waiting for 10 mins he finally came to see what was wrong with my meal. He started off joking about how the kitchen staff had it out for us, which I thought was extremely rude then offered to fix my food for the second time tonight. I told him that I didn't trust them to get it right and comped our meal. I will never eat again at the Applebee's in Rome. You will probably have better luck with gas station sushi than the Rome Applebee's."
Raven C.,"Sparks, NV",0,3,,1.0,6/10/2016,"Even more awful service and wait time than the typical Applebee's, which is a hard feat to manage. Our waitress was completely rude to me and even disrespectfully tried to flirt with my boyfriend to the point he had to shut her down and note that he's out with his girl. Before that she came by and filled his 75% full cup of water while mine was empty and ran off as I tried to hand her my cup. So rude."
Red S.,"Huntersville, NC",0,12,,1.0,4/9/2015,"Last Applebee's I go to. Bartender was loud and obnoxious  (flipping his tumbler around like he was Tom in ""cocktail"", and hooting like Rick Flair. ) also, like Chili's they took chicken fried steak off of the menu  (should be a crime in the south to not have that in any restaurant ). I am boycotting all restaurants that give you a receipt longer than my arm. Seriously, I will not be going to your stupid website and filling out some silly survey. Plus it's hard to keep your receipts organized for work when there is a miles worth of paper to keep up with."
Julie P.,"Broomfield, CO",0,3,,1.0,2/6/2015,"They suck ock with a C... especially  the bartender Hanna!! Apparently  she likes flirt with peoples husband's and ignore their wifes.... ummmmmm yeah.... can we all say hore..  just add a W!! So yeah..  ask for a drink with a shot on the side.... it'll be in your cup ""apperently""... but taste no alcohol....  then order a dr.pepper.... and you get a dirty half glass with no ice!!! Yeah check please!! Unfortunately a character like this could ruin a Applebee's  experience!! Sad to say! Cheers!!"
Danielle C.,"Evanston, IL",530,2329,682,3.0,5/22/2010,"A good Applebee's.  Yes it's a chain restaurant but that's okay.  I guess you could just expect the same food quality that you get at any Applebee's.  Service was decent, and the hostess seated us quickly. Their lunch menu was kind of disappointing and only offered Monday-Saturday.  They do, however, have the 2 for $20 deal (two entrees and appetizer) which isn't bad.  The spinach and artichoke dip is pretty creamy and good."
Melissa G.,"Rome, GA",0,5,,1.0,4/18/2014,"The music was loud. It was hard to carry on a conversation without feeling like I was in a night club. A waitress was complaining and cussing in front of customers about the small tip she received from another large party, which is inappropriate and unprofessional. The food was fine and my server did the best job that she could but I was highly disappointed with the overall service and climate of the restaurant."
