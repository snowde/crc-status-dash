Denise M.,"Edmonds, WA",31,30,53,3.0,11/13/2017,"I haven't been to Applebee's in awhile. It is always a sure bet on the food scale. I love to get the Oriental chicken salad. So this is what I ordered cuz it sounded so good. Unfortunately it wasn't as good as I remembered it being. I'm not sure why, but it did have a lot more of the torn lettuce in it. I enjoyed it even so and will possible try it again someday. I think different locations are better than others and this was our first time at the one in Roseburg. My husband said the ribs were fair ( not as good as mine!). I spoil him.  Not a stand out meal so I have to give it a 3."
Craig J.,"Roseburg, OR",14,16,,2.0,8/22/2017,"We were pleasanty greeted by their hostess, who seated us quickly and made sure were comfortable with our location.  Once our waitress arrived however things went down hill. We ordered 2 peach margaritas on rocks, and our server Ashley took it upon herself to make them top shelf. We sent those back for the house margaritas and got peach Koolaid mixed with HFCS and a couple drops of tequila.  For our food we got salads and the 3 cheese chicken with cavatapi.  Hardly any cheese. High points of this visit, the salads had great croutons,  the pasta was cooked nicely, and the water was filtered. #nevergoingback"
Ron S.,"Creswell, OR",30,76,62,3.0,6/20/2017,"Stopped in on a hot day to cool off, eat light and hydrate. We were seated right away but it seemed to take forever to get a drink going... so thirsty... The blackberry tea and blackberry lemonade was good...  couldnt get enough...  so...  thirsty... Waitress just too slow...  (it wasnt even busy) $10 buys a 5 pc chicken strip and what equates to a medium fry. Food quality was above average - service brings the rating down."
Trena R.,"Oakland, OR",0,43,,2.0,1/9/2018,"A group of us went to Applebees for the endless bbq ribs which were delicioius. The reason for the low score is not the taste of the food but for two reasons.  The first batch of ribs we all got were cold. Yes, lukewarm in some places , refrigerator cold in other places on the ribs like mouth fulls of refrigerator cold ribs.  Second, the waitress kept wiping her nose from customer to customer she waited on she was constantly rubbing her nose on her sleeve. we were wondering if this was a habit of hers so much so she was not aware of doing this or what.  As we got batch after batch of ribs they got hoter to the last one which was really hot. We ordered the ice peach tea too. It was ice tea diluted in so much ice with chucks of canned peaches in the bottom and ones that were canned in water not syrup. i about got nauseated and did not drink mine. the cost was 4 bucks a person for the tea. so that is why the restaurant gets a two stars. Also the waitress flipped from customer to customer ignoring us at first we sat for 15 minutes before she even addressed us."
krysta l.,"Pahrump, NV",15,12,1,1.0,10/28/2017,"Heather!  We were like your only table this afternoon when we were there!  I know this is only Applebee's, but man, a visit from the waitress at least once after taking our order isn't asking for a lot, is it?  The food was fine, typical cuisine you'd expect from this neighborhood chain restaurant, but Heather!!  What happened??  You took our drink order, lunch order then disappeared. I could have used a refill on my drink, my son wanted a to go box for the remainder of his meal, but you were no where to be found. You didn't even bring out our food!  Manager brought the appetizer, some rude, in a hurry, and seemed annoyed to have to do your job girl brought the burgers, stating you'd be here to see if we needed anything else... I wanted mustard, but no Heather. Thankfully those little machines are on the tables to self pay & skedaddle, so, your tip was a reflection of your service.  So, that's my experience with this place"
R And L T.,"Sutherlin, OR",0,34,17,5.0,8/8/2017,Love the appetizers. 1/2 price during happy hour and always the two for 20.  Never had a bad meal here. Always a great selection. Don't forget the drinks.
Bruce B.,"Walnut Grove, CA",43,775,1001,4.0,4/15/2016,"Service is fairly fast but attentive. Staff are very friendly. Had appetizers for easy meal. Cheeseburger egg rolls, awesome flavor but the sauce rocks ! If you enjoy mustard you will really like this sauce. Sit at the bar where service is ultra fast. My second appetizer is wonton tacos. They are very tasty with a nice amount of spice. The wonton shells are really a treat.  My server at the bar is Tauni who knows how to treat customers. She is fast and efficient. Watching her make drinks proves that she is a real pro master mixologist.  Thanks!"
David M.,"Dallas, OR",1,25,,1.0,9/23/2017,"Consistently poor service and bad food.  I've tried to eat there 3 times, thinking they were just having a bad night.  I've given up. Don't waste your money."
Ginger B.,"Sutherlin, OR",0,3,4,1.0,3/3/2017,"Went to the Applebee's restaurant today, so hungry. We happen to be seated with a direct, not close to, view of the restroom. I noticed that every time a waitress went in, she never took off her apron! That's gross! Imagine all the fecal matter on those aprons as well as on her receipt/order book, straws, pen...etc I'm sorry but won't return to that Applebee's anytime soon!"
Jean Paul R.,"Miami, FL",0,13,1,4.0,11/18/2017,"On the road for a month and needed real food with vegetables, Salmon on bed of Spinach with ""fire grilled veggies"" and Garlic Mashed Potatoes was perfect and delicious, Heather, an efficient waitress with cool colorful tattoos jumped in and took care of us when she saw our original waitress said hello but never came back"
Jim B.,"Lyons, OR",34,90,20,1.0,3/31/2017,"After a full day of driving the open hi-ways heading north and checking into motel for the night did not wish to search for a place to eat since this was in the same parking lot.  Should have......   The staff most excellent, great service and fast..  cheerful and friendly. The watermelon sangria also outstanding.  Wish I could have said the same for my dinner. Ordered bowl of clam chowder along with fish and chips. The soup was dehydrated because the potatoes were still dry and very chewy. The fish. Had the wipe and soak the grease off.  But the drink,,,, most excellent"
K S.,"Eugene, OR",0,14,,3.0,8/15/2017,"Same as any Applebee's.  If you like their menu, you'll have a nice experience.  Wait staff is attentive and friendly."
Ashley P.,"Winston, OR",24,42,23,5.0,1/28/2017,"I rarely come here but after this experience I am coming here more often. The service was spectacular. They always made sure that we were okay, and kept keeping us informed of when our food would arrive. Now to food, the food was fantastic. I got the BrewHouse Chicken and it was delicious. I finished the whole thing and I rarely ever finish a plate of food. O also got a brownie bite for dessert and it was warm and fresh. I loved the entire experience. Good job."
Margo B.,"Sutherlin, OR",0,4,,1.0,3/3/2017,Came at 2:30 on a Friday it was not super busy and they appeared to have plenty of help. It took about 20 mins for the waitress to ask for our drink order. It took about an hour for the food to come. Others were served who arrived after us.  Noticed the waitresses going in and out of the restroom wearing their aprons - not sanitary!  Additional 20 minutes to get the check when they clearly saw we had finished. Over all the service was not great and there was no apparent reason (not busy or short staffed). Food was ok.
Lucia A.,"Portland, OR",1,35,,5.0,8/8/2017,"I knew when ordered the beef salsa verde nachos (1170 cal) that they'd be the worst I'd ever had, and they were. I knew there'd be ridiculous drinks to choose from like the Corona-Rita (290 cal) or the Blue Hawaii (230 cal) that I'd regret ordering and consuming, and I sure do. I was hoping my server would be even half as sweet as ours and we lucked out with a real gem. They had stocked restrooms and delicious ice water, bonus!! Expectations were met and even exceeded. 5 stars, never coming back."
Bill M.,"Roseburg, OR",1,14,7,4.0,2/5/2017,The food was GREAT and the waitress was pleasantly friendly and helpful. I had the Brewhouse chicken which was delicious! My only negative experience was the hostess which was kinda rude and had a condescending attitude when we ask to not be seated at a table with a defective light. Otherwise it was great!!!!
Sandy R.,"Riverside, CA",8,5,24,1.0,10/27/2016,"DISGUSTING! Hair on my food!  So we went there for the second time with my family We order the 2x20 entrees and when brought our food my plate had HAIR so they took and ""supposedly"" made a new plate so i start eating there IS A HAIR AGAIN ON MY RICE! So i asked to talk to the manager and he comes out veey unprofessional guy so he says  ""Im sorry about that, what can i do for you guys?""  Like he is the manager! He is supposed to do something like offer a gift car whatever but he just sauys "" WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU GUYS!""  I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL UNLESS YOU LIKE EATING PUBIC HAIR!"
Pete F.,"Chandler, AZ",16,272,337,4.0,7/12/2015,Another great meal at Applebee's. Saw this place on my GPS and after a great meal at another Applebee's thought I would stop for lunch and see if the meal consistency was the same as in my other visits to this chain establishment.   Bottom line:   It was a great meal.  The service was good from my young server.  Had the 4 cheese penna which was part of their 2 for $ 20. Both meals were excellent.  If your looking a nice place for a meal try an Applebee's and report the results. Would be interesting if the chain has found the secret to consistency.
Tim G.,"Roseville, CA",36,9,1,2.0,5/19/2017,"All day on the road from Reno NV and drop in to the ""neighborhood grill"" for my ATF Bourbon Street Medium.  Well, first attempt was way-well, enough our hipster server Victoria, took it straight away to the two kitchen managers.  Now that my bride and sister have finished their mains, I hear the sizzle coming over my shoulder in the second attempt at Bourbon Street Medium...nope, still mooing!  In disgust, I give up, don't have time to go back and grill my own to Medium...total loss of appetite. Looks like short stack at Lenny's"
Tracey L.,"Gervais, OR",20,41,3,2.0,7/14/2017,"Hesitant to go back to this Applebee's... having just moved to Roseburg, my husband and I were out on a late night date and wanted to get a little appetizer and dessert. We got some chips and some kind of chocolate dessert and my husband ordered a soda as well. The food was decent, and my husband enjoyed his soda. I took a few sips of his drink as well to try it (we don't buy soda at home) but mostly drank my own water. My husband asked for a refill and the waitress said ""Oh, I'll actually get in big trouble if my manager finds out I gave you a refill because we're not allowed to do that when people share drinks. I'll sneak you one though!"" Um, where's Big Brother of Applebees hiding cameras and caught me taking 2-3 sips?! And what does soda even cost a franchise like Applebees?! We thought that was really weird. We've never had a problem with ""sharing"" drinks at any restaurant even if we completely split meals and drinks. I will typically order my own beverage if I know I'll drink it all, but most of the time I can only take a few sips otherwise I get filled up on sugary drinks before even eating my food. So eat with caution at this Applebee's- you never know who's watching you."
Dolores B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/19/2017,"After a long day of driving, wanted to sit down and have a drink and dinner.  We were seated quickly and orders were taken soon after seating.  Dinner at 5:15 and they were out of French fries, but had sweet potato fries for additional .99.  Long wait for drinks and even longer wait for appetizers.   Got the chicken mac and cheese and it was horrible.  Will not be back to this restaurant."
Lazzy G.,"Sutherlin, OR",0,2,1,2.0,8/1/2017,"If you ever think hey that looks good let's stop there. DON'T. When you walk in it seems nice, you sit down with your menu and they ask what you would like to drink . Soda is soda so you can't judge them on that but there lemonade was ok. I got the ribblits and fry's. the ribs were ok and fry's were skinny and crispy . Good for them a like crunchy fry's. the honey BBQ was sweet and savory . The reason they only got a 2 star review was because of the waiters . What should of been a 20 min lunch turned into a hour and a half. Our food got to us on a decent time but we had to wait 30 min for are dessert. We had the blonde and it really saved this review. No joke our waiter was sitting at a table talking to one of her friends that came in for lunch. For to people it was 35 $ which seems pretty pricey. The horrible customer service is what knocked this review to a 1 and dessert saved it to a 2 . Would stop again for dessert"
Terri D.,"Coos Bay, OR",3,3,,1.0,1/13/2017,"Food took forever to come. The food that did come wasn't cooked correctly. My husband's burger was burnt and it was supposed to be pink. My food was not as shown in the menu. They did offer to replace with a different meal, still waiting everybody else is finished eating. Very expensive for lunch."
Albert H.,"Seattle, WA",0,9,,4.0,8/7/2016,"What can I say... it's Applebee's! Somebody behind the curtain majored in Yummy in Cooking school! Prices are decent for the excellent quality all the way around. Our waitress was going fast, which made for fast decisions and didn't allow for chit-chat. We left tummy happy : )"
Jeff S.,"Roseburg, OR",13,15,1,5.0,6/13/2016,Was there the other night . I would like to give you a pat on you back . Exc service . Quick on the drinks . Made my day with the service we received . I recommend all to come try there food and service . I love every meal I have ordered there . I gotta say you are one of my # 1 choices . For best food and service .. See you Guys soon ... Thanks from the Sidenstick Family
Jodienpatrick L.,"Roseburg, OR",6,42,85,2.0,2/13/2016,"Ugg...as soon as I think its safe to go back to applebees.....wham! Half hour wait to be seated, half hour wait for drinks. Half hour wait for appetizers.  I dont know if I have enough half hours to devote to this place..... and yet I wait..."
Adrienne H.,"Roseburg, OR",7,45,8,3.0,11/15/2015,"Interesting. I have had a good experience there before but quickly had an awful time. My companions ordered a steak, it came out overcooked and I found my normally delicious mushroom burger was saggy and greasy from sitting for forever as the manager told me. They did fix it but the food took forever to get to us. Terribly slow. This is highly unusual as it is normally good. Makes me wonder if they had some new cooks in the kitchen.  What is going on? Get it together! Really not normal."
Stacie B.,"Portland, OR",5,42,1,2.0,6/2/2016,"Not great. We weren't expecting anything sensational but at least some correct orders & consistency. I got cocktail sauce instead or marinara, candied pecans on my wedge (she said there were pecans but not that they were candied- gross on a wedge) my husband's drink & dinner were not correct. I ate less than 1/4 of my salad & the server knew about the mistakes but it wasn't taken off the bill. We'll go elsewhere next time."
Jen C.,"Medford, OR",0,28,28,2.0,10/14/2015,"SALT SALT AND MORE SALT!  Just had starter sampler takeout. If I didn't have high blood pressure prior I probably do now: it tasted like salt had been spooned into the wonton chicken tacos and the crispy Asian wings, and even the chips were phenomenally salty, just by themselves. the salsa was salty. The chicken dishes were SO  salted... When you have so much salt that the food is briney, it almost starts to taste sour. I was super hungry so ate it anyway. Need to drink a lot so I don't have a heart attack!!! Flavour would be much improved by correcting the seasoning, but would they sell less beer?"
Michael C.,"Roseburg, OR",32,73,243,2.0,7/13/2014,"I've been going to this Applebee's on a regular basis for about 11 years now, and I've generally thought of it as a dependably decent place. However, over the last several months they seem to have developed some issues stemming from a general lack of organization/management.  Issues with the wait staff being uncoordinated with their service gaps resulting in some minor and sometimes major inconveniences.   In the kitchen, some dishes are occasionally, randomly unavailable.  Food preparation is at times slow and sometimes there's inconsistencies in dish preparation from one time to the next.   A dish that you enjoyed last time may therefore either not be available or not meet your expectations this time.   These issues do not seem to be related to the current business volume They occur when the restaurant is busy, or not busy. In general, we enjoy Applebee's menu and the staff, as individuals, do well.  These issues seem to reflect systemic organizational/management issues. ""Rose's Cafe"" #rosescafe1"
Beverly W.,"Myrtle Creek, OR",8,4,,1.0,3/5/2017,"We went to Applebee's on Wednesday 3/1/17for lunch.  We were seated in the bar area and Heather was the waitress/bartender, she had three customers at the bar.  It took ten minutes for her to ask another waiter to take our drink order, when she finally came to the table she did not bring the drinks or water.  It was not a busy time at the restaurant, if we go back we will not sit in the bar area.  She was very busy talking to friends instead of taking care of customers.  Never saw her wash he hands after taking money.  We had a good view of where she makes the drinks."
T B.,"Coos Bay, OR",0,105,56,3.0,1/6/2017,"Stopped in for lunch today. The  problem I had was when the food came I noticed on the menu it didn't completely explain what came on the sides . For example the bacon cheddar potatoes had sour cream and onions which wasn't stated . I ordered the mashed pecan sweet potatoes they were covered with cinnamon which I am allergic  to which  wasn't stated on the menu . That I could see . Also we ordered 2 for 25 steaks they came with some kind creamed shrimp which we never ordered. When the check came they charged us 3.95 and a extra .99 for each meal .We didn't  make a complaint , just didn't want the fuss . Next time I stop in I will ask for full details on  the ingredients in each item ordered."
Jil S.,"Coquille, OR",97,137,26,2.0,7/29/2015,"Bad experience today. Not even sure where to begin because so much went wrong. We ordered beer cheese sauce with pretzels for our app. Beer cheese sauce was cold, pretzels were deep fried and so much oil still on them they glistened. Waitress was AWOL. I guess they were short handed and I know that happens, but when she did finally show she was not even very polite and looked incredibly haggard and stressed   chicken penne was cold. What's with this place and cold food? My daughter enjoyed her Thai shrimp salad but 12 bucks for a very small salad would make that not an option again if we ever to go back. We were I. Town for a medical appt so it was so slow we had to beg twice just to finally get our ticket. I will try Applebee's again because I do like their food. But if it continues like it was today, the next trip will be our last."
Jolene D.,"Houston, TX",258,163,172,1.0,10/12/2015,gross. I walked in thinking I can have something I hadnt had in forever. only been in twice ever and realized quickly why. everything is topped in processed cheese and their salads have iceberg lettuce and made so cheaply. I just walked out... just now. it didnt take long to be so replused I gagged and walked out
Terrie R.,"Cascade Locks, OR",0,6,7,5.0,8/6/2016,We ordered the two for 25 deal with upgraded steak and half rack... Tastes wonderful!
Kathy D.,"Roseburg, OR",13,6,,5.0,2/2/2017,"Went with some friends to celebrate a birthday.  I ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp.  It was so delicious,  it was served on a heated cast iron plate and also had grilled onions and drools as well a crispy roasted red potatoes. I highly recommend this meal.  Four of us ordered this meal and all were delighted with it.  Our server, I did t get her name but she was very attentive and pleasant.  We had a wonderful experience and will definitely be back again soon."
Captain C. Branagain G.,"Astoria, OR",47,575,8,4.0,5/11/2015,"After many years of disappointing service and food at Applebee's, I avoided them. It has seriously been about 10 years since I have been to one, and they couldn't even fulfill my comped return experience without major hassles and let downs. Granted, I was hesitant about meeting mates here for supper and drinks. I have to say that I was impressed. Pretty damn good food for a decent price. Drinks were fair and at a price point typical with these chains. Fried shrimp, pretzel apps, salads, ribs, and burgers were all good. Service was great as well. I think it helped that I was being flirted with by the super hawt waitress who thought my gallows humour and Irish accent was so captivating. Rawr... (ducking from objects being hurled at me from the wife who also thinks my gallows humour humour and Irish accent are captivating)"
Heather P.,"Roseburg, OR",0,7,,1.0,1/19/2017,"Just gross... Thought all Applebees were the same.. for some reason their food is nasty, and its dirty and the tables are sticky"
Jeff A.,"Rock Springs, WY",22,36,15,2.0,1/16/2016,"Service was horrible, our family of four waited almost fifteen minutes before even having our drink orders taken, the waitress seemed irritated and uninterested. The food was sub-par and arrived ( after an long wait) cold and thrown together. My flavor of beer ""ran out"" but I overheard the bartender saying the keg just needed to be changed and my server said they were ""out"". Waste of money and we won't be back."
Ian S.,"Arden, NC",0,13,,1.0,12/6/2016,Ordered a cheese burger  to go and got a raw cheese burger I do mean raw  manager would not give me my money back .
