Alan C.,"Wofford Heights, CA",0,16,2,4.0,9/10/2015,We made it to Roseberg at 5pm. 88* is too hot to leave the dog in the car and go to dinner. Call in dinner from the hotel to be picked up. This is a great option for dog owners. The take out girl came out and reviewed the order and then you pay. A few minutes later they bring your dinner out to the car ! How Bitchen is that ! Dinner was great and did not have to worry about the dog getting cooked or drinking and driving. Thank You Applebys!
Jean E.,"Williams, CA",26,25,13,1.0,4/1/2016,"Stopped off on our road trip back to California. Busy place, so figured this has to be a good place to stop. We stood waiting while someone was sat. Then three ladies as hosts proceeded to chit chat and play with menus instead of even saying hello to us. We finally said to them thanks for nothing. We have been standing in front of you and don't need to be ignored. We left and the one girl did say ohh sorry we thought u were waiting for someone. Well jeez maybe they should have asked?"
John W.,"Shedd, OR",6,127,120,4.0,1/22/2014,"I have been to this particular Applebee's at least 10 times, if not more. It was a big hit when it first arrived in Roseburg, then went through some various management (apparently) where things started to slide downhill a bit. Lately, I've been very impressed. Service has been great, and the food was as well. I've always thought that they have smaller than price deserved portions, so I'll knock a star for that. But this particular occasion, I was looking for a lighter fare due to a new diet, and there under 550 calorie menu is great! Good selection, great flavors.  If your driving by on the 5, stop in for dinner! Beware, though, it can be packed ANY night of the week!"
Tyler C.,"Winston, OR",19,46,32,3.0,11/2/2014,"I went in today and they had these cool looking tablets at each table.  I thought it was pretty neat at first.  I played with it and ordered an appetizer.  I tried to play the games,  but you have to pay to unlock them.  The new tablet system messed up our order!  The waitress commented that they absolutely hate them and they mess everything up.  During the meal I had to turn the tablet around because all the flashing menu items got a bit distracting.  So,  what I thought was something cool,  turned out to be a disappointment."
Michael L.,"Roseburg, OR",1,13,,5.0,4/17/2015,"So, I am not normally one to go to a chain restaurant because of the ingredients and the general idea that most of the money leaves my area. That being said I love this Applebee's.  Although their soups are clearly bagged and not made fresh, their servers are clearly indoctrinated to the point of almost being robotic, and that they are missing some of the more classic drinks and menu items the experience is always positively remembered.  They seem to be on the ball all the time. Even when every seat is filled they do their best to seat you and serve you in an efficient manner.  They are extremely consistent and no matter the server, shift or day I have always been able to have a pleasurable experience."
Jennifer B.,"Portland, OR",81,6,,1.0,3/27/2016,"Low expectations from this place to start. Hostess seats people based upon who is next not on the seating available, Sat for 15 minutes waiting for a table that was empty when I walked in b/c the large party ahead of me didn't want a booth. Mediocre food served cold & late. My child's grilled chicken was so burned & dry he couldn't eat 1/2 of it. Meals didn't come out together and salads arrived with entrees. We were just driving thru and wanted a salad not a nearly 2 hour bad experience. Should have hit a drive through"
Rose J.,"Roseburg, OR",0,4,,1.0,1/30/2017,"I ordered a southwest steak salad for carry out today...I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. After 20 minutes I walked into the carry out door and asked for my food as I needed to get back to work. One person greeted me I told her I was waiting outside but no one came out with my food or bill. She proceeded to continue to talk to a customer at a table then went to tell the bartender I was there. The bartender came over without really greeting me and asked what I ordered. I told her a southwest steak salad. She took my card and charged it and brought me a bag of food. As I opened the bag one styrofoam container with the salad in it was not even closed. It was not in the normal container it usually come in and I was very frustrated as there were several miss steps with this order experience. I knew I should have just left when they didn't come outside to great me. The place was not very full of customers so I did not understand the problem. I asked for a manager and spoke to someone as confused as I was, as to why I got a styrofoam container of food. Wouldn't a manager know if they were out of to go food containers??????!!!!!!!!!! I took pictures of what I got once I returned to my office and it was horrible. I have order food from the carry out before and one time the meat came on the salad which made everything soggy by the time I got home. Someone need to teach this restaurant to be consistent with the quality of food they are selling. I will never go to this restaurant again."
Big T.,"Mulino, OR",25,257,17,2.0,10/21/2015,Food is ok as usual. The recurring theme is how management treats there employees in front of customers. This is the second time I have seen it in two visits. Management need some training before they get there ass drug in to court or there as kicked in the parking lot. Fell sorry for the kids that work here.
Keri K.,"Monroe, WA",1,19,,1.0,8/17/2015,"Worst service ever, driving south and wanted a quick sit down lunch. my app sampler started coming out in 15 minute ie.... over 45 min. after WE  ate MY app sampler lunch (good thing I kinda like the guy) his  Ceasars arrived and the darn thing came out doing the back stroke in dressing and he never did get the bread stick he ordered!"
Charity R.,"Oceanside, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/7/2016,"We went into Applebee's during lunch hour. There were very few tables full in there. We had three children in our party. Our waitress brought each of them a coloring paper, but only brought 2 crayons to the table.. We then ordered appetizers that never arrived at our table. When we asked about them our waitress said ""hold on"", walked away and didn't come back to tell us about them. It took them and hour and a half to bring us our order, still without the appetizers. And even when they brought it out, only two of us got food, ten min later three other people on our party got food. And 15 after my daughter was brought her French bread pizza which was already cold. All of our food was brought out by different people, none of which were our waitress. The manager came to our table when we got our bill and said she was sorry for the wait. But only offered a free desert. I will not be going back to this establishment."
Kristy W.,"Eugene, OR",288,414,437,4.0,6/25/2014,I was really impressed with our service here especially after our group was dressed like a bunch of river rats with wet swimming suits! We are from Eugene and played in the sun on the Umpqua and wanted dinner. Our server was great I wish I caught her name. My steak was actually good too and I ordered off of the 2 for $25. I asked for a side of the Hawaiian sauce that is on the new steak and it was really good. It actually has me wanting more. Next time I will probably order that steak. Anyhow thanks for serving us even though we looked like drown river rats that day.
Paige L.,"Roseburg, OR",0,10,,2.0,2/11/2016,"It's just all around terrible, the only reason I gave them two stars is because of the waitresses that work there. The food is terrible, no taste. Don't waste your money going there."
Polly R.,"Roseburg, OR",5,2,,1.0,11/11/2015,"I'm upset! They claim to be honoring Veteran's today. I'm alone & can't be in a crowded environment without having severe anxiety. I called to get my free meal to go. They can't do that? I'm a Veteran, I served my country, I can't sit in a crowded restaurant even w my service animal alone. I just wanted to get my meal & go home to eat. Sorry we can't do that? Why the fuck not?"
Laura L.,"Salem, OR",2,12,13,2.0,6/19/2015,Ordered the Honey-Pepper Chicken Tenders and won't do that again. They came on top of French fries and instead of being coated with a honey pepper seasoning they were drowned in this sticky sweet honey sauce that covered everything including the fries. If you like sickeningly sweet saucy dishes this is for you. I will not order this ever again. When I told the waitress that it would have been better if they hadn't drown my fries with the sauce she just said well next time get the sauce on the side. No offer to replace the Uneditable  fries or anything. Way to go Applebee's.
james c.,"Seaside, OR",8,624,1,4.0,5/6/2016,"This is a good place for late dining if you drive longer than you would like and need a late dinner. This chain is reliably good, not great. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. The wine list is short but there were several decent choices. I didn't want to try one of the interesting cocktails though some if those around us did. My wife had the oriental chicken salad: always a reliable choice.  I tried a chicken dish with lots of vegetables and rice which wasn't great but I didn't want a steak.  If we stay nearby again we will have dinner here again."
Angela P.,"Monrovia, CA",0,4,,5.0,1/2/2015,"This is the best Applebee's I ever been to! Great and fast service and good food. Renee, the manager rock!  We enjoyed ourselves and good memories was made. Highly recommended"
Charles D.,"San Francisco, CA",1,132,8,2.0,3/19/2014,So manager covering for bartender who is on break awesome When he tells me he's a manager and has no clue what he's doing not awesome Gets my order wrong... short pours me on a shot...shorts me on beer  Glad I wasn't an Applebee's manager oh wait.... I was.   Hope the DM reads this  2 stars cause Lindsey bantered n was nice
Cody M.,"Roseburg, OR",21,36,19,4.0,4/10/2014,"I'll start off with this, it's Applebee's, a major chain restaurant so not much to input. The food is good for what it is wife always gets three cheese chicken penne, I always get chicken strips cause I think there burgers are mediocre at best. The bar here is great they know drinks and don't gig you on the amount of liquor they give you. It's not a bad restaurant at all just not a big fan off major chain restaurants. Little man is where it's at."
Steve M.,"Salem, OR",10,6,3,1.0,10/24/2015,My family and I stopped in tonight 10/24/15 on are way back to salem....we ordered are food and drinks got are food 50 minutes later and as we are eating my little girl sees something on the wall crawling were are table is so my wife and I look and it's a COCKROACH!!!!!! So nasty so we say something to are server and she got the manager. The manager comes over and is trying to smash it with us still sitting there. ......nasty. ......and then the manager just walked away like nothing happened.
Kevin T.,"Roseburg, OR",1,18,,1.0,4/24/2016,Every time we go here the service is terrible and the food is mediocre at best. The wait time for food has not been under an hour for the past couple of years now for a party of three. Last time we went my kids food didn't even come out until after we were done eating and then it wasn't what she had ordered. The manager reluctantly apologized and offered desert and still charged us for the food my daughter ordered to go at this point.  My suggestions are to work on speed and service as currently the only reason this place stays in business is they are a large chain.
