Maria D.,"Roseburg, OR",31,7,8,3.0,2/27/2015,"We have usually enjoyed the food at Applebee's over the years but when we ate there last night we were very disappointed!!!  First we ordered the new chile verde nachos which looked delicious on the menu but when we got them they hardly had any meat on them and were very skimpy.  They were actually really good just triple everything on top!!!  Then to top it off the 7oz sirloin was disgusting, the worse piece of steak I have ever tasted!!! Yes it was tender but like a weird tender? I didn't finish it.... Something has changed with the quality of food!!! Not happy!!! But I must say Sally our waitress was Awesome and was the Best!!!"
P J.,"Grants Pass, OR",0,24,,5.0,3/21/2015,"This by far is one of the best Applebee's I've been to. Our steak was great. Our service was great. Our server was Jessie. A wonderful happy young lady that clearly enjoyed her job!  I always stop at the Roseburg Applebee's while driving through. It's so much better than the one in Grants Pass, which we feel needs a visit from the  Health Dept.  If the owners of the Grants Pass Applebee's would take the time to visit Roseburg, maybe they would get my business again.  Thank you again Jessie for your great service. Looking forward to our next visit!"
Beth L.,"Roseburg, OR",0,39,,3.0,3/6/2016,It's a hit and miss. Sometimes you can go in and have excellent food and service and sometimes it's terrible. Not likely to give it another try.
Wayland L.,"Sacramento, CA",135,174,2,3.0,9/10/2013,"Well it's an Applebee's, so the food is standard fare.  Stopped on the way down to California for a quick dinner.  We got here, and it was probably about 80% packed.  At first I was surprised, seeing such a crowded Applebee's.  Then I realized I was in the middle of nowhere, and was not so surprised anymore.   The employees were pretty nice.  The waitress did her job, and checked up on us a few times during the meal.  Chicken penne was cooked fine, and so was my friend's food."
Jen P.,"Roseburg, OR",0,14,6,2.0,2/16/2014,I'm really not sure how a chain restaurant can have such bad and inconsistent food. I have been so disappointed the last several times I have gone that I won't be back. I really enjoyed going there too since it is one of the better places in town. The last time we were there I had the bourbon steak and shrimp. I have had this dish many many times as I consider it one of the best in the menu. It was horrible. I'm not sure what they did but it was not flavored correctly and floating in a weird substance. My husbands shrimp were so fried that they barely had any flavor.  The manager came to the table and asked us if he could replace any of our meal but I declined. I had lost my appetite by then. He took $10 off my meal. I hope they can get their act together. I miss the old days..
Sher G.,"Medford, OR",19,220,687,2.0,2/16/2013,"The waitress didnt give me silverware, never filled my drinks and ignored my table so much another waiter had to ask if I needed anything else, I said yeah silverware when he brought me my food! It took at least 20 min just to get my appetizer. I stood at the front door when I first walked in for almost 5 min before we were acknowledged and brought to a table and the table was rickety and the chair had food in it! :/ The food was bland and VERY small portions! Not impressed with this Applebees!"
Art M.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,27,1,3.0,8/12/2014,"The food was tasty and our server was friendly. My wife and I each had the 3 cheese penne pasta with grilled chicken on the  2-for-$20 menu. The flavor was excellent. Unfortunately, it was plated haphazardly. Mine had 2 small strips of chicken and no visible Alfredo sauce. My wife's had several pieces of chicken and a generous amount of sauce. She was glad to share her excess chicken and the waitress brought extra sauce. We made an acceptable entree in this way, but it should have been done in the kitchen. The preparation time was a bit longer than I would have expected. The ceasar salad was served on a warm plate. Again, good recipe, poor execution The table seemed sticky so we asked the waitress to wipe it for us. She explained that there was some reaction between the urethane finish and the cleaning product they use, it couldn't be remedied. An offer for a free perk popped up on the free wifi. Apparently an appetizer or a dessert was available to those who completed the online form. Our server didn't know about it, she sent the manager over. He said perfunctorily that  he didn't think this restaurant participated in the offer, but he would honor it. Since he never returned, no perk was forthcoming. No big deal, just poor handling.  Too bad the staff wasn't more motivated. I really wanted to give this restaurant four stars."
Reba M.,"Junction City, OR",8,14,,1.0,9/6/2015,"Our worst experience at an Applebee's.  The hostess was great,  seated us quickly. Food took a looong time.  Our medium burger was burnt to a crisp and no condiments on the side as requested.   One of our group was served 10 minutes after the rest of us. And I guess they've changed the Fiesta lime chicken recipe - heavy on the sauce.  No longer my favorite.  Too bad.  We used to like Applebee's."
Pamela Y.,"Canyonville, OR",7,112,65,4.0,10/30/2013,It's Applebee's !  I have always gotten good service and food here.  I have been to other Applebee's out of town and they are not the same.  Have some good wines and drinks!  Enjoy!
Dusty Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,40,,2.0,8/23/2012,"I'm usually a fan of Applebee's, but I think i might have to pass on this one next time I'm around...  We got here at around 7, yet were seated instantly, which is definitely a perk.  Yet, the server didn't even introduce herself to us...  Nothing big, I know, but I'm very big on good customer service when it comes to sit-down restaurants.  The whole time, the server seemed to be jittery.  Maybe she was trying to be efficient when taking our orders, but it just felt like we were being rushed.   For food, we went with the 2 for $20 deal.  We got the mozzarella sticks for the appetizer, which were decent but overly gooey.  As far as entrees, I got the three cheese penne and my mom got the house sirloin.  The penne was decent and just like any other Applebee's, but some of the penne were cold.  My mom said the sirloin was good, so I'll take her word on that.   Overall, the restaurant seems to be average and just like all other Applebee's, but just a little bit lacking in the customer service department.  I would say two and a half stars, but Yelp doesn't like halves, so I'll just round down in this case..."
Buzz M.,"Billings, MT",86,425,113,4.0,2/28/2013,"If you read all my Applebee's reviews (there are many as I travel for business) you'd see that in general, I'm a fan.  I basically order the same thing every time:  Bourbon Street Steak.  It's good.  Very good.   And at this particular Applebee's, also very good.  The systems and management are down pat here and at most locations.  This is a small town Applebee's, so the employees are even better !! Applebee's locations are undergoing a massive Nationwide renovation removing the ""hang-down"" cabinets over the bar area.  These renovations are much needed and much appreciated.  This particular location has not received this renovation but most won't notice. Good food, good people, well managed.  Kudos!!!"
Samantha S.,"Roseburg, OR",18,65,14,1.0,5/10/2012,"Update:  My boyfriend (7 years my senior) wanted to stop by Applebee's so I agreed. We were waited on by an old classmate of his (her name is Katie). She didn't ask to see his ID, although she should have anyway. When I handed over my ID, she looked at it and said, ""Awwwww, you're just a babyyyy!!!!"" in the most annoying sing-song voice you can imagine. I do not care what kind of situation you're in, you DO NOT make a comment like that to a customer. I was highly offended and consider that completely inappropriate. If I ever have to come back, I will ask for another waitress if I'm seating in her section."
Eric P.,"Kissimmee, Orlando, FL",61,263,6,2.0,8/25/2012,"This chain location is roughly what I'd expect from Applebee's ... except that this location just felt, well, sticky. But, when one is riding along with the folks, one goes where they go. Otherwise, food was good, server was chummy but adequate, and speed was appropriate given we were way off the normal meal schedule (late lunch at 2:30). If there was an overall greater feeling of cleanliness, they'd be worth the third star for ""average in every way."""
Joshua M.,"San Diego, CA",204,1480,170,4.0,11/13/2011,"We got their 2 for $20 deal and started off with the potato twisters (homemade potato chips with a cheese dipping sauce).  They were really good, maybe a tad too much seasoning, but overall pretty awesome.  I had the fiesta lime chicken for my entree.  They cheesed the hell out of it, but it scrapped off easily.  I think our server's name was Shali or something along those lines.  She was very friendly and on the ball."
Tam F.,"San Ramon, CA",489,1397,253,3.0,8/14/2009,"1 week post hernia surgery and I was given the all clear to take our family vacation to the Oregon Coast and then to the in-law's. The only thing I wasn't cleared for was ""real food"" so I was stuck on a thin liquids diet. I couldn't fathom getting any of that at any of the fast food establishments on the road and I wanted soup so as we approached the town of Roseberg and saw the Applebee's sign we all agreed to stop here for lunch. I know, I know, I said in my review of Applebees in San Ramon that I ""didn't belong at Applebee's"", but when on the road, one has limited time and choices and we were all pleasantly surprised. First, we were seated immediately and had a great server. Second, I was able to get French onion soup without the cheese or bread and the broth was tasty. Lastly, daughter and husband  did the 2 for $20.00 deal and each had a substantial lunch (daughter steak and veggies with steak that was prepared as ordered) and husband the Oriental chicken salad. They also shared an appetizer of boneless buffalo wings that they deemed good, not great.  All in all a decent stop on the road-and luckily, much better than some of what we endured later in the week."
Levi S.,"Washington, UT",3,15,,1.0,11/4/2014,"So I was eating here the other night and order the chicken tender macaroni dish with the honey pepper glaze I purposely asked for the honey pepper glaze to be on the side because I don't like it. However when our food came out that honey pepper sauce was all over the chicken tenders so I pointed out how that was a mistake and I had ordered it on the side and then took it to the back well little did I know that they would not remake the entire dish instead they scraped off the chicken tenders and the sauce that they could see and recooked the chicken but gave me the same old pasta. Now if I was allergic I would have sued their ass. I can't believe the managers that would allow that and I can't believe the cook that would serve something like that. Completely unprofessional to me as a chef. My girlfriend and i will never be back there, in fact we will tell everyone we know to not go there. All the new managers suck too. Nothing but attitude. You forget apparently that you work in the service industry. That means try to give quality service instead of a half assed effort."
Phil ..,"Myrtle Point, OR",1,45,5,4.0,2/22/2013,Good food and service.  I do wish they would quit checking all the time to see if every thing is okay.
Brian T.,"San Bruno, CA",0,8,,5.0,6/23/2012,"I'm giving 5 stars to a type of restaurant that I normally wouldn't, for one reason alone.  Not the food (which seemed typical for the chain) or the location (which is quite plain) but the staff, entirely for how they handled a power outage that hit right after my family was seated.  They were able to finish part of our order but not all of it, and so rather than trying to eke something out they just packaged up the food they had cooked already, added a couple of extra apple juices for my kids, and sent us on our way free of charge.  This was a classy move and their manager deserves huge kudos for making the right call."
Allan-ester D.,"Vancouver, Canada",59,611,28,3.0,9/5/2012,This Applebee's was average at best...nice location right off the interstate...the food was just ok and the service the same
Jay H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,52,2,5.0,5/20/2013,I love this place.  Never went to any of their places til I moved here.  The steak was full of flavor and the sides were great.  The place was busy and I didn't have to wait for drink refills and the check.  The staff was very attentive and the place was clean and inviting.  Home Run!
