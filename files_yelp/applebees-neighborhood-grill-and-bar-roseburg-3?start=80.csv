Valentin S.,"Portland, OR",386,110,135,3.0,8/14/2013,"Some really good reviews for this location. On the plus side, great and friendly service. The staff was really nice and fun to be around. The wait for various things was on the slow side. The food was good and as ordered. The location could use some updating as it has a worn feeling. Ie. The wood tables had scratches and dents. All in all a good location. The people here make it work followed by the food and prices. This outpost of the vast Applebee's empire gets the job done."
Natalie A.,"Tumwater, WA",76,77,119,4.0,6/12/2012,"I greatly enjoy Applebees and this one was no exception. Our waitress was a bit odd, but nice. Typical Applebees food, typical service (not in a bad way)."
Dl L.,"Roseburg, OR",0,43,5,3.0,1/25/2014,Manager was sitting in lobby with an employee discussing a work issue. Inappropriate ! I don't want hear that while waiting for a table. Biggest attraction for me to this eatery is WW 500 calorie menu- it is great.
Connie L.,"Coos Bay, OR",206,331,62,4.0,12/3/2010,"Okay, so I've had locals ask why we'd be willing to drive well over an hour to eat at... an Applebee's. There are several good reasons! The most important is the happy employees. Never have been able to figure out what it is about the people working at the Roseburg Applebee's but they sure seem to like what they do!  Maybe it's the coastal rain that makes people so grumpy at times... but if I can't find a happy place to even have a meal locally, I don't mind driving! We actually met folks in a neighboring booth on our last visit, and developed fast friendship, exchanging information with promises to reunite one day! I can't say as I've ever had that happen with perfect strangers in my own home town. I have, however been scolded for humming Christmas Carols in a retail store; pushed out of the way and yelled at by a customer who obviously wanted to go down the isle I was perusing FIRST, and occasionally we find someone seemingly happy in their job.  Applebee's to me, is like the McDonald's Mercedes version. You know exactly what you're going to get when you order, and anticipate exactly how it will taste, no matter which Applebee's you visit. Not such a bad thing actually, if you find a menu item you particularly like. It's my opinion that the oriental chicken salad is good enough to buy extra and take home!  Locals can laugh at the gas they think we waste to go find happy people, but happiness is worth seeking out! Even if you have to drive a few miles!"
Amar M.,"San Ramon, CA",0,59,,1.0,7/23/2013,"To be fair, my review is closer to 1.5 stars. The food and drink was pretty typical for an Applebee's, meaning it was fine or even pretty good. The problem at this location is the slow service and at times the lack of service. Our server made numerous mistakes.  1) No silverware, napkins, condiments came out with our food. Had to wait for them. Just cause I'm brown doesn't mean I eat with my hands. This seems to be a familiar complaint from the other reviews I've read. 2) Empty glasses sitting on the table forever. I ordered a margarita which was decent, but then I waited for 20 minutes till my server reappeared with our food till I could order another beveraget. I proceeded to order a beer, thinking it would be ready quickly, but had to wait about 15 more minutes for it and didn't get it till I had almost finished my meal. Should have sat at the bar, but tough as I have young children! 3) Server didn't come by even once during dinner to see if we needed anything. 4) After waitress brought out the bill, waited for 15 minutes and nobody came to pick it up. We decided to pay cash and walked out of the restaurant. Not one applebees employee here could muster up a ""thank you"" or ""have a good evening"" to us on the way out. Guess eating good in the neighborhood isn't as friendly as it used to be! Final thing, the food here is super salty. My wife and I both felt swollen and dehydrated the next day, and she didn't have any alcoholic beverages. Pretty crummy feeling! Maybe we got bad service cause we weren't locals. The server asked if we were local or visiting and we told her we were just passing through. Maybe this is why we got such crappy service, but for every action there is a reaction, ergo this crappy review.  My advice would be to eat in Ashland or Eugene, where people are a lot friendlier and more interesting and there seem to be a lot better options than in Roseburg. The stretch from Ashland/Medford to Eugene is probably the most depressing stretch of America that I've visited and this Applebees is a microcosm of why it sucks so bad."
Jan V.,"Albany, CA",0,2,,4.0,8/22/2010,"My daughter and I ended in Roseburg after a long day's drive. We decided to try Applebee's for dinner a decision we have no reason to regret. The staff was friendly and gave great service. We had Sirloin steak and Fajitas. Food was OK and as expected, desert was super. I'll gladly come back."
Mary V.,"Petaluma, CA",50,188,34,1.0,5/30/2011,"So we'd been on the road for hours.... and we were very hungry.  We figured it would be safe to stop and eat here for lunch.... you know if you been to one applebee's you've been to them all kinda attitude.  Boy were we ever wrong.  Absolutely the worse Applebee's we've ever been to.  The service was neglectful at best, nonexistent at worse.  I had one of the lunch special's a bowl of french onion soup and the three cheese penne pasta with chicken.  After an extremely long wait for our food, the waitress must have finally remembered she was at work and actually had customers waiting for food, the food was served COLD.  Can you imagine having to eat french onion soup with a knife and fork because the cheese had so hardened?  Well even that didn't work, the food was not edible.  Boyfriend's food was cold as well.  We would have sent both orders back, but the waitress never came back to check on us.  We had to ask the bartender for our check so we could pay up and get the hell outta there.   HORRIBLE HORRIBLE.   Do not even be tempted to stop here when traveling through Oregon!!!   (PS... we shoulda been suspicious when we noticed an empty parking lot at the height of lunch hour!)"
Ireland v.,"Portland, OR",0,12,,1.0,10/14/2012,"That was gross. Just stopped in for the 2 for $20 deal. Ordered twisted potato appetizer. Chips were both overcooked and raw, not sure how that's even possible. And the cheese sauce had no cheese flavor. A better description would be cream of green pepper soup. Totally disgusting. After 15 minutes of staring at it, with no customer service whatsoever, we left."
