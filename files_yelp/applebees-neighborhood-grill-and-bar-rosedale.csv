Keri P.,"Woodmere, NY",171,2,,2.0,8/6/2017,"The food has been decent every single time I come, but every time I come back I wonder why I even make that decision. The service is HORRIBLE. The waiters/waitresses I've had are very nice but incredibly slow. The waitress brought over my salad, looked at my fork and told me she was going to get me another one which I assumed meant it was dirty. I waited about a half hour and stared at my salad after telling my waitress and the hostess that I still hadn't received one. Again, very nice people but they need to do something about the slow service."
Joey D.,"Rosedale, NY",2,10,43,1.0,11/2/2017,I would give this place 0 star if it was on option. 1. FILTHY ESTABLISHMENT                2. OverPRICED GARBAGE               3. CONSISTENTLY UNDERSTAFFED.  I stepped in this place an hour ago and had to walk out. No one VISIBLE for 20 minutes to even seat me and my party (Party of 10 that was waiting outside). Everyone in there looked like they were lost in a place that wasn't even HALF FULL. I would rather take my own life than to EVER EAT IN THIS FUCKING PLACE!!
Madeline M.,"Flushing, NY",1,23,5,1.0,12/7/2017,"I cannot actually review the food.  We came here after an already exhausting day ... car trouble yada yada.  I didn't really want to come here because service hasn't been the greatest in the past.  We got seated immediately.  The restaurant is pretty much empty.  We basically sat there for 20 minutes and we were never even acknowledged.  No one came by to get our drinks or even to tell us someone would be with us to get our order.  Nothing ... but there was about 4 girls waitresses plus the hostess just hanging out laughing right by the front door just carrying on and having a grand old time.  We eventually gave up on waiting for anyone to come to us to get our order and got up to leave ... the oblivious staff cheerfully wished us a good evening, not even realizing we never even ate and held the door for us on our way out.  Yeah ... thanks for nothing.... oblivious staff.  No wonder nothing lasts in this shopping center.  I guess the staff has more fun hanging out entertaining each other than bother to notice the customers.  Thursday night ... empty restaurant....  oblivious staff.  I am officially done with this particular Applebees.  No thanks."
Ebony H.,"Rosedale, NY",467,208,511,1.0,4/27/2016,"Let me start off by saying that believe me when I say I don't like giving negative reviews. I try to see the good in everything HOWEVER my duty is to Yelp HONESTLY and help out others seeking clarification. Ok with that being said, this place is HORRIBLEEEE!!!  Hubby and I came to spend a little time together since we were already in the area (5 town). We decided to grab some drinks since it was about to be happy hour and also get something light to eat. Ok great! So we go in and there's no host so we walked over and sat at the bar. The bar tender who I believe was either a shift supervisor or a manager was taking orders. Nice lady but her being nice didn't prepare us for the horrendous food we had.  The food was absolutely UNACCEPTABLE!! I provided pictures so as you can see there's no falsifying what I'm saying. The salad was completely brown and disgusting, the mash potatoes tasted like spoiled milk( also very DRY), the steak was super dry and the broccoli was stale. I'm not understanding how a big establishment such as Applebee's can serve such nonsense. It just isn't right.  You're better going to the Applebee's at Green Acres to be honest with you. I agree with most of the Yelpers on here who wrote reviews about this place. It's quite accurate.  I would NOT recommend nor return here. Sorry"
Bregaglio C.,"New York, NY",0,1,,4.0,7/23/2017,Service and food were good. The server was very nice and she came to check our table more than once.  Not a bad place to eat in an area where you don't have a big selection of restaurants.
Mary Luz T.,"East New York, NY",131,100,249,1.0,12/11/2016,Worst food.. rice was undercooked and they try to fixed putting the rice with all the meat and vegetables in the microwave. Nice job last try on this restaurant.. good luck ..!!!
Rich R.,"Woodmere, NY",0,7,,3.0,5/1/2017,"This particular location gets crowded often, so the long waits are not something I can blame the restaurant for. However the frequent order mix ups and forgetfulness of waiters (in terms of bringing out silverware and drinks) can be blamed on the staff.  But to be honest, the main gripe I have is with the corporate changes to the menu. Now I cannot say that certain changes weren't valid or efficient options for the chain but I can definitely voice my opinion.  The appetizers are where my issues lie. The green bean crispers, which were some of the best I've had in the area, have been toned down. The price remains the same while the quantity has been significantly cut and you get once sauce as opposed to the previous three. Even the seasonings have gone from elaborate combinations of spices to mostly salt. The wings have a similar issue. Same price yet lower quantity and less celery/carrots. At times, no dip was even provided (But that's on the staff).  The sweet potato fries are now a smaller order and fewer sauces are given.  Again, I cannot blame this specific location for these cutbacks, but I am irritated with the decisions that the heads of Applebee's have made. Still, a generally good place to have lunch or dinner with friends or family."
Kevin F.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",42,223,99,2.0,2/16/2016,"This is one Applebee's where you most certainly will not be eating good. Slow service. Dirty and smelly conditions. ""Employees"" that couldn't care less about their job, your food or you. Who knows what else. I don't go to any Applebee's anymore, and it's because of places like this. Someone at the corporate level needs to keep tabs on their franchisees, because this is one that should have their license removed."
Ehud E.,"Lawrence, NY",5,26,,1.0,10/8/2016,"Hi all, JUST STAY AWAY.....TERRIBLE ... First time that i'm choosing to change review from 4 to 1 star. The first time was I guess a lucky night or something, it was good but stopped there.. Since then, 3 more visits. today we decided was the last time. This place is pure junk, the food is disgusting , staff is unfriendly to the level of ""OMG"" NEVR AGAIN..... Stay away.........."
Jodi G.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",24,60,70,4.0,1/15/2017,Pretty much the same as the others. Food is great. But at this location the wait staff is def more efficient. Keep it up!
Stanley T.,"Rosedale, NY",39,29,37,1.0,7/2/2016,"I end up here every few months and I always regret it.  The service is incredibly slow.  I don't know if it's the pay or what, but the people working there seem to have no interest in being there at all.  Today I actually had a nice, helpful waitress, but most of the time I get someone who seems spread so thin I'm sitting around waiting for so long that I have to go looking for them.  The host was incredibly rude, just going through the motions of his script.  Then... There's the food.  I have to say, the steak quesadilla was actually not bad, but outside of that I feel like I'm eating at McDonalds when I eat here. Stale flavorless food.  Wouldn't recommend.  The location is just convenient and I suppose that's the only reason this establishment stays open."
Holly S.,"Knoxville, TN",1,30,9,1.0,12/19/2016,"Terrible. We waited about 10-15 minutes to be seated but there were 15+ tables visibly open. We then almost had a fight with all the other people waiting because the host didn't take names and apparently couldn't remember who he was getting tables for. We were seated and then given silverware 5 minutes later. The waiter came back and attempted to take our order- except they didn't have any of the beer from the menu including the ""draft of the month"" and all other craft beers- they had bud light and miller light as their ""craft beer selection""...yeah. Then I tried to order a Bloody Mary and was told they can't make that. So we ordered food and drinks we didn't really want- and the waiter huffed/ran off. At that point we talked and decided this sh@t-show was just going to continue as literally everything about this place took 5x as long as it should have and was delivered poorly and with attitude. So we found the waiter and told him to cancel the order- and he couldn't have cared less. So I guess good call on our part as I don't like to eat spit on my food... Overall, pretty freaking terrible. I can say w 100% certainty, I will never go back to that place."
Lemya K.,"Far Rockaway, NY",15,41,87,2.0,5/26/2016,"The DH and I went for lunch on a sunday around12pm-1pm. The menus were so dirty. They were sticky and you could feel the crud and reside on the pages. It was distracting so I held the very corner to turn the pages. Now that I think about it I should of just asked her for another one but I remember coming here before having the same issue with dirty menus and I had other pressing thoughts on my mind that day to discuss. The food was ok. I wish I remembered at the time to tell the person who came around (a tall, slim lady) asking if everything was ok about those dirty menus."
Duane S.,"Brooklyn, NY",50,220,1276,1.0,7/11/2015,"Applebee's food is pretty much the same everywhere, so nothing much to elaborate about. The cedar lemon chicken dish was very light and flavorful. The 3 cheese chicken was very rich and filling. The poor rating stems from this being the first time I've been to a franchised establishment that did so poorly with customer service, so o won't be back unless it's just for the late night apps deal.."
Jennifer D.,"Franklin Square, NY",0,12,41,2.0,10/11/2016,I have to say - there were two employees that were great at this location but it was amazing how there were 20 employees and a manager walking around and you couldn't get what you wanted. The one waitress was doing the best she could serving way too many tables and also helping the bartender fill her ice. Not impressed with the food or the service.  I don't want to watch your waitress stand there eating gummy bears out of her pocket while I can't even get anyone to bring me what I ordered.
crystal h.,"Saint Albans, NY",3,33,105,3.0,11/5/2016,It was my nephews 15th birthday dinner with 9 people in our party. It took the waiter awhile to find a high chair for my son. The food was ok but the portions were small. I ordered a classic burger with fries because you can't go wrong with that. I also ordered the bonless hot wings. My son had the chicken strips and fries off of the kids menu. The waitress tried to remember everything that we order without writting it down. That caused problems later with the bill.  They had the music blasting for karokee which became annoying after while.
Vered G.,"Little Neck, NY",24,16,5,1.0,9/25/2016,Worse service ever! The servers can care less how long you've been sitting there. Never ever going back.
Gigi C.,"East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY",37,79,227,3.0,4/27/2015,"I come here often and always seem to forget to check in. During the night hours 10- closing, where the 2-1 half off appetizers and half off drinks are happening, it's just messy. Nothing comes out on time and waitress/waiters are very slow.  I was here tonight and I was so disappointed. I normally love this location but it's just backwards. My meal came out before my appetizer, and I ordered dessert to go and that took over 25 mins just for a blue ribbon brownie!  The food here is always delicious and fresh, I've never had a problem dining here except for at night. Save yourself the time and just go during the day, it's the same thing just a few dollars less. The night time hassle is awful and very disorganized. I love this location though and will come back, just not close to closing."
Lori A.,"Ozone Park, Queens, NY",26,281,227,4.0,1/11/2016,"This location is my first choice for dining. My husband and I have dined here numerous times over the past 8 years, and I've never once had a bad experience. The tables have been clean  as was the dining room itself and the utensils and plates. The food has been consistent across the board and on par with other chain locations. My servers have been professional and courteous and child friendly. That's important to me as I've reached the stage of life where I now have a toddler and my in-laws have their own children. So it's nice that they are able to accommodate all ages and have something for everyone. The location can become crowded towards the evening hours but I've never waited longer than 20 minutes and if you do have to wait, there's a Kmart next door that you can kill time by browsing inside. This location is out of my way but I'll continue to return again and again."
Rhonda A.,"Brooklyn, NY",65,252,564,3.0,10/17/2014,"We only come here after 10pm for half priced appetizers and drinks. After a long week at work, all you really want to do is eat, drink, and talk about about your coworkers. Service... well that depends on who you get as your server. When we went last week, although the server was nice she messed up when we were paying. Definitely would not come here during their dinner rush."
Nick C.,"Hewlett, NY",0,26,9,1.0,9/5/2016,"Me and friend were seated promptly. We we were given drink specials and waited nearly 25 min for someone to come take our order and no one ever came. We got up and left and told front door greeter same. His reaction, nobody took your order? Bye to Applebee's."
Nicole K.,"FAR ROCKAWAY, NY",6,34,5,5.0,10/15/2015,"I was really proud of Applebee's last night. We came here for the half-off appetizers and happy hour drinks. I must say, the customer service was on point. The drinks tasted like the real deal and were garnished very nicely. Also, the appetizers were delicious. Thank you Applebee's!"
Layzie L.,"Queens, NY",227,7,1,2.0,12/17/2016,They messed up the order twice and the food was not to great. The waitress was nice. The restaurant was cold so we ate with our coats on.
Padma L.,"Singapore, Singapore",19,2,1,4.0,5/28/2016,"Had the Cajun chicken and shrimp, 5 cheese Mac and cheese, chicken wrap and the Thai style shrimp salad. Enjoyed all except for the Mac and cheese which was very sweet. Our server was all right. Service was slightly slow but that was to be expected on a Friday night. Overall a pleasant experience :)"
Pierre C.,"Lawrence, NY",22,4,3,1.0,6/20/2016,"The service was slow. We had to ask the server for the drinks that we ordered 15 prior. The appetizer came with the entrees,they got one of the entrees wrong and asked if we wanted to keep it. It took two tries to get the entire right. I had ordered the whiskey shot chicken and it was barely warm. I will never step foot in that Applebees again."
Aaron L.,"Queens, NY",112,1,,1.0,7/6/2016,"DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT if you're interested in getting decent food in a timely manner from a server that actually remembers that you were sitting there! Worst applebees experience ever and i will not be going back! The server took 45mins just to ask if we are ready to order, an hour to get the food that we ordered and the people at the table behind us got their food right after us although they were there before we were. Then she didn't come back around until we flagged her down for the bill 20mins later (completely dissatisfied). Food was pretty good though"
April G.,"New York, NY",15,100,8,2.0,2/22/2015,"When I first came to this applebee's, the food was good, it was nice and quiet and had great service.  Yesterday however, it was a disaster. The food came warm and almost everything seem to have ""retired early"" on their menu (it was only 5pm), so I couldn't get a lot of my favorite dishes. Also, everything was overly salty, ugh. Our waitress was friendly,prompt and very sympathetic to us no longer being able to order or favorite dishes."
Shaina L.,"Paedergat Basin, Brooklyn, NY",27,2,,1.0,9/25/2016,"Saturday night, you think ""Where can I grab some grub and drinks? I'll go to my neighborhood Applebee's, shouldn't be too bad"" WRONG! We sat at table in a not crowded bar section. When our waiter eventually greets us, we order drinks and appetizers. My boyfriend got a happy hour margarita on the rocks and I ordered the perfect patron margarita because I wanted a little more kick. 30 minutes! Before anything came to our table! THIRTY! The apps come and then I watch our waiter grab what I saw to be our sitting drinks from the bar. The appetizers were cold and the drinks tasted like they sat for too long and the ice started to melt. YUCK! We should've stopped there, but we were actually hungry and thought our waiter would ask us if we wanted anything else. We had to flag him down to order entrees. When my boyfriend asked if they served turkey burgers he was met with attitude and opposition from our waiter! At this point we just asked for the check and left. If you're going to head to this Applebee's...sit at the bar, be nice to the bartender and don't order any food...maybe you'll fair better than we did."
Maria R.,"Lindenwood, Queens, NY",4,2,,2.0,8/10/2015,Bad management have to wait to long for any service hostess don't even look you in the eyes when seating you at a table will never go back... One star
Lorana P.,"SOUTH OZONE PARK, NY",37,22,2,1.0,1/8/2016,Worst place ever. Thought we would give this place another try. We pulled up at the car side to go and we had to go in to get our food!! Seriously? When we called back the very RUDE female answered the phone saying come in to get it. Like this is your job. Don't work there if you can do your job. Don't provide the to go service if you can't fulfill the duties.
Amanda B.,"Brooklyn, NY",76,153,24,1.0,7/10/2013,"The seats were STICKY. The table was STICKY. the food looked OLD.  Checked the pic i posted, the buffalo wings looked like its was made last friday... I'd also like to note that yelp removed my photo. However, I'm glad the department of health already contacted me regarding the matter so hopefully they are finally making FRESH FOOD.   see below: Hi there, We're writing to let you know that we have removed your photo of Applebee's Neighborhood Bar & Grill. Business photos and captions should be broadly representative of the business, however you're welcome to share your personal experiences in your written review.  Thanks for using Yelp!  Regards, Harris Yelp User Support San Francisco, California"
Richard D.,"OZONE PARK, NY",1,3,,1.0,3/6/2016,"Went there when they had the 2 for 1 drinks special, didn't sit at the bar because my friend wanted a booth and from the second we mentioned that we were just going to have drinks, the waiter already seemed annoyed. After our first drinks we were going for a second round and the waiter (with extreme attitude) tells us that we can't order more drinks without ordering food. Lol I could have asked to speak to a manager but I didn't want to waste my time nor did I want anyone to spit in my drink."
Lori B.,"Jamaica, NY",1,29,26,3.0,3/14/2015,"Loved the sriracha shrimp. Chicken Penne pasta was on point.  Fireball lemonade  was good. Waitress was so polite, clean-looking, and timely with the service. My first time at this location (decent) Clean-ish. Typical call Applebees setting. OveralI me and bae  had a pretty chill experience at this location."
Devi V.,"Ozone Park, NY",0,7,1,5.0,2/2/2016,"This is my first time visiting this location, and unlike other Applebee's that I have been to in the past I must say that I've had the best customer service experience here! Our food was great , it was super busy so it took a little while however they had these cool tablet at every table to keep you occupied while you wait. Their sriracha shrimp appetizer were amazing!! Its a must try! Let me not forget our Waiter for the night, Rasheed! He was very delightful and attentive not forgetting his great customer service skills. I recommend you ask for this gentleman if you happen grab a bite there. If you're lucky to have him at that time.. And also, we were seated immediately upon arrival. I will definitely check into this Applebee's again for sure!"
Jocelyn P.,"Queens, NY",0,1,,1.0,8/11/2016,"I'm going to start by saying BAD SERVICE. The manager has to tell their waitress to pay more attention to their tables. Dirty floors, dirty menus, no personality what so ever. It was the worst."
Michael D.,"Concord, CA",163,33,2,1.0,7/3/2014,"Possibly the worst experience at any restaurant ever. Brenda our waitress was always nowhere to be found. She came by the table maybe three times, counting when she took our order. I usually always tip 20% to 30%, this was actually the first time I walked out with only tipping 5%, which covers what she would have to tip out to the busser, bar, and runner. We barely had our drinks refilled. Maybe waited like 15 minutes after they are empty to actually get a refill. Best part is, she gave me a refill, but my friend needed one too, but she just walked away after I got mine refilled before he could say anything. So he had to wait even longer because she was nowhere to be found. She barely even walked past the table. Oh and even better, it somehow took her forever to get the refills, even though we were sitting next to the bar!  When she did check on us, we were basically finished with everything. Of course the drinks were always empty whenever she came by.  The food was meh. Literally the only good thing there was the wings and onion rings. I tried my friends chicken quesadilla, and that tasted like it came from Taco Bell, seriously, maybe even worse than taco bells quesadilla. My other friend had the steak, he said it was alright, it looked dry and gross. I tried his side of broccoli though and that tasted like it was from the Costco down the block, it was still hard and cold like it needed to be defrosted. The riblets that I had, sucked, but I never liked Applebee's riblets, I don't even know why I ordered it lol. Maybe I was giving it another chance. I usually get the cowboy burger and love it. So yea, service sucked, and food sucked. I'm usually a nice person and always try to defend anything people have a problem with. Like if my friends have a problem with service, or food taking awhile I'll just say ""oh they are probably just busy"", but this was terrible. I've seen Brenda just talking to her co workers instead of helping us out when we needed her. I'm not complaining that she was talking to her coworkers though, I'm a server too, I know chatting it up with them makes it fun being at work. But if you can't multi-task, you can't serve."
Dana C.,"Brighton, MI",0,4,,2.0,1/17/2016,Service here isnt that great. It takes forever for the appitizers to come out. My father found a hair in the food. Not too pleased with this experience.
Jenelle R.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,2,,1.0,10/29/2016,"This was the absolute WORST experience I've ever had at a restaurant in my life. I came out this evening with my daughter and parents hoping to have a nice evening.  Instead,  we waited for over an hour for the bare minimum. Our drinks arrived 25 minutes after we ordered. After sitting for over an hour, only 1 of our two appetizers arrived. The waitress finally arrived to tell us half of our order wouldn't come because they didn't have anymore ribs. When we responded, we sat there for over an hour so why didn't she tell us this before. She responded with a half-assed apology and a free desert. I was so livid I refused to order anything else. I told her to charge me for what was on the table because we were leaving. My daughter was so hungry she cried. I will NEVER return and I'll make sure my family and friends don't  either. The staff are extremely unprofessional. We ended our evening at the IHOP across the street."
Joe R.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,38,,1.0,7/3/2015,Stay clear of this place if at all possible.  The food is mediocre and the servers don't seem in sync.  On our last visit we waited for 10 minutes before anyone came to the table because the greeter apparently had not let the server know a new party had entered.  Keep your money and go elsewhere for better service and fare.
Nadia H.,"Woodmere, NY",192,156,8,3.0,12/13/2013,"Come here after 10pm any day of the week for half off appetizers and 2for1 drinks. The drinks are watered down and weak...but you can't go wrong with the apps. The selection includes, wings, nachos, mozzarella sticks, etc The service is spotty. You constantly have to chase down your waiter, but they're nice...when they actually come to your table. It's a good place to watch a game.  Other than coming after 10pm though, I probably wouldn't"
