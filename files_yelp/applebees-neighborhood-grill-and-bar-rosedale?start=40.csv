Karen W.,"Hempstead, NY",5,17,,3.0,3/13/2015,"This is a good location, server was wonderful. No long wait for food, so why did I give 3 star rating? St Patrick's Day is coming and they are offering Irish Coffee, the pic in ad is showing a nice clear glass with whip cream top, I am brought Irish Coffee in dirty looking white mug, it ruined the nice experience. Don't half way present the offered item, please do better in the future."
Leslie G.,"Brooklyn, NY",112,38,67,3.0,12/21/2014,"Applebees seems to be going down. The quality of the food isn't as good as it used to be. And they got rid of the maple butter Blondie. Bad move Applebees, bad move."
Davone M.,"ARVERNE, NY",581,177,169,3.0,7/18/2014,Not my favorite but my mom loves it so I go to curbside to get her food. Curbside is really convenient you don't have to leave the car at all. Also the lunch deal is really cheap. I ate my mom side Cesar salad. And it was decent.  Yup that's about that!!! Lol
Anand P.,"Bronx, NY",22,22,22,4.0,12/27/2013,The service was good it was nice and clean the manager randy was very nice... he greeted all the customers and was very cool and down to earth the servers came on time and they were very efficient I highly recommend this place to anyone
Michelle D.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,61,,1.0,2/28/2016,"This is the worst Applebee's probably ever. The staff is so ghetto and they literally are talking about dumb sh** right In front of you. In addition, when you walk into be served , they wait to finish what they're talking about then pay attention to you. Also, I've called in to place an order for pick up and I waited for 6 mins on the phone for someone to answer, I hang up, call back, and wait another 7 mins. (I was put on hold 5 separate occasions in total). Ridiculous. So when I get there it was another sh** show, including that there were tables there that haven't been cleaned off (about 20) , staff is sitting & eating. The staff have the worst attitude, it's so disgusting. Unprofessional. They don't deserve these jobs and it takes away from people who deserve them and will do  a 20x better job than them. Avoid going here."
Bianca G.,"Rosedale, NY",446,5,2,1.0,10/5/2014,This is absolutely the worst place to eat! The one in Green Acre's mall is better! First our waiter rushed us to order and then my food was horribly burnt! Never again!
Sparkles L.,"Cypress Hills, NY",12,51,24,2.0,3/30/2014,Good tasting food but horrible customer services . Long wait to get my order and the server was very dizzy running around and not focus on her customers . No tip today
Donald K.,"Manhattan, NY",1,50,86,1.0,8/11/2014,Went to this place to grab some food but we couldn't get past the front door.  There were other guests waiting even to be seen by the front person to put their names in or get seated. We had to leave and found a better place down the road but it's the most important rule of restaurants... Have someone at the door when your guests come in or they will leave.
Jonathan S.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",234,299,57,2.0,2/1/2012,"Visits to this place always leaves me wanting, not because of the quality of food, c'mon is applebees, I have NO expectations it tastes the same everywhere, but the service is lacking, BIG TIME.  I visited there last week and upon walking in there was a girl opening the door for the customers but no one at the desk to seat us. We ended up waiting for 10 minutes and then the host showed up, didn't ask who was first in line but decided to seat a party of 22 before my party of 2. I just grabbed a waitress and said ""please set me in your section""."
Jay K.,"East Memphis, Memphis, TN",133,105,9,2.0,8/13/2013,"My service was decent, but I felt sorry for the other patrons, there were about 4 young waitresses who were playing around near the bathroom jumping around and acting the fool while their customers waited for their meal ... Thats crazy .. The drinks were watered down like crazy, but the food was decent ...  Just Decent."
Lashanna R.,"City Line, Brooklyn, NY",24,33,88,1.0,8/7/2013,"We waited forever on the waiter. In fact I'm typing this review as I wait to pay for the food. The workers hangout in the bathroom talking shit and on their phones. The food look nasty , we got our sampler and never received our plates and utensils. Why am I still waiting? There's a million of them walking around. The food runners don't greet you. Kudos to Randy the manager who comes out and asks how the service & food is and leaves his card behind to contact him if we need anything."
Nick G.,"Cedarhurst, NY",24,12,,2.0,5/26/2015,Servers were cute and friendly....but slowwwwwww...... Service was poor!!! Hostesses at the front desk were sweet!!! Food was mediocre!!!
Mal A.,"Civic Center, Manhattan, NY",0,2,3,1.0,8/1/2013,"This is one of the worst restaurant I've been in, the appetizer took for ever, the waiter came by and said he was going to see why it taking a long time, he disappeared some 20 minutes later another waiter bring the appetizer but no plates, then the main course come and the waiter ask us to cut out steak to see if it was done to our liking, now that's a first, never again"
Yeong J.,"Clark, NJ",85,11,14,1.0,10/18/2011,Ok I thought Applebee is Applebee.  They are not that different between the locations.  So it a safe bet when in an area that I'm not familar with and don't feel like traveling. Well the food is the same but service is definitely off here and service leave quite a bit to be desired.
Wabby W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,,3.0,2/20/2014,"Been going here for about 4 years and it isnt bad. Yes some nights it can been overfull with ghetto no class costumers,  then it have days you dine along side civilized people. The serves isnt bad, even on a full night. I havent came across asshole waiter or have anything negative to say about the food? It taste like any other Applebee's. The only two negatives is the drinks are all water down..ALL!!! And the menu list isnt as big as other franchises.  But other than that its a good place."
Erica M.,"JAMAICA, NY",2,8,26,1.0,7/11/2013,"I took my husband to this Applebees dinner today. After explaining to the hostess two times what we wanted they still did not get it right. The food was the worst I have ever had in my life. We could have done better by staying home and microwaving a pre packaged meal. I nor any of my family will ever eat at an Applebees again once the waiter finally took our order, never saw him again, except at other tables, never came back to mine. Never asked how our meal was (which was cold), never asked us for refills on our drinks. First time in my life that I didn't leave a tip."
Sara T.,"CAMBRIA HEIGHTS, NY",3,13,5,1.0,6/2/2014,Bad. Bad. Bad!  The manager is nice but the service is AWEFUL. Our app order took 35 min. Our drinks came 2 min before our app. Terrible. Food is microwaved and no server knows what anything is. No one seems to know pricing either. Our bill came and it was super expensive - a ripoff actually. Yikes. Don't go. Seriously.
Innocenzo C.,"Astoria, NY",223,15,17,1.0,8/18/2012,"This was my 3rd visit here since shopping in the area . They repeatedly push drinks and appetizers within seconds of being seated  .We simply ordered a dinner and was asked twice by 2 different staff about having appetizers , During our meal we were reminded about dessert now by our waiter and another waitress 2 different times .  The environment  summed up not a pleasurable food experience it is annoying although the staffs personality is friendly , The resturaunts mission seems to prey on people that dont like conflict , they assume that people will say yes to everything because they market their consumers as being weak ,People do not like confrontation so they will surrender by saying yes .   To eat here you must be stern and know what you want and just tell the server what you would like ignoring all their recommendations .  The desserts in a shot glass and charge 5+ dollars for them .Criminal   This is establishment is not for me . pushy environment .  Positive note / Food is decent resturaunt is clean .Plenty Parking is available . My recommendation to you (Applebees) Why not give people a small free sample of the drink your trying to push when people taste it 9 out of 10 will buy it . How do like those apples ."
Shameena P.,"Fort Worth, TX",48,21,132,3.0,6/21/2011,"Applebees...We usually go to the one in long island but when an ice cold beer is needed and you dont feel like driving to far this one becomes an decent option. After 10pm it becomes 2 for 1, you'll definately find me at this location! We usually sit at the bar to make life easy and order some half off appetizers, spinach dip:) classic boneless wings:) and Mozarella sticks:) Basically picture it this way we all know the neighborhoods in queens by now...this one is alright( not long island) so you pick which applebees floats your boat for that night! Start talking to the bartenders, they r all cool! One time i wanted a mexican bulldog and she was willing to make it with a smile:) And like my hottie Vince Vaugh said "" nobody wants to go to applebees alone"" lolz so grab a few friends and go get yourself some 2 for 1's!!"
Peter K.,"Tuxedo, NY",46,27,15,1.0,10/10/2011,"Terrible. Food was cold, took forever.. waiter greeted us and seated us... and it seemed like he was doing every single table in the establishment. I commend him for his hard work, but that doesn't help get my food to me while it's still warm. Management must be lacking in ability. Won't go back here again. Prefer the one in New Hyde Park.. it's a drive, but I'd rather spend 30 minutes driving instead of 45 minutes waiting for food. (even the appetizer)"
