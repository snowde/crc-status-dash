Kochanie B.,"RIDGEWOOD, NY",0,20,,4.0,2/2/2014,I had a good experience here. I came to grab a quick meal before going to work so I sat at the bar. I forgot his name so I cant give him a shout out. My food was pretty good so no complaints here.
Ashke B.,"Inwood, NY",0,5,,1.0,3/4/2012,"I don't like Applebee's much to begin with, but this location tops the wretched dining experience cake with uncouth ala mode: Cold food, bad service, deafening noise levels, and claustrophobic eating conditions. We sat at the bar while our party of 11 waited to be seated and the bartender told us she'd send our next round of drinks to the table, since our name had been called. She never ended up telling our waitress, so we waited double as long for our drinks.  Secondly, they put a family with a highchair extension right behind our enormous already-seated party, so nobody on either side could get through, making it even worse for the servers.  Restaurant ingenuity at its finest! Don't. Just don't."
Kirin J.,"South Ozone Park, NY",237,13,4,1.0,2/26/2013,"I guess I can't expect much from an Appleee's in general since it borders the line of quick serve. The food will always be exactly what you expect, regular american classics. Nothing special but my favorite entree is the grilled chicken penne and I love the brownie Sunday almost as much as I adore the CoronaRita (must try). This particular location only appeal is its location near the airport and their happy hour which includes half priced apps and 2 for 1 drinks. I think your experience here will always depend on your server. Today, my server Melissa B just happened to tip a balanced scale over to the negative side bc of her less than pleasant facial expressions and lack of appeciation for a cusomer who comes to order appetizers, entrees, dessert, and multiple drinks, and who generally tips 20% plus! Maybe my expectations are a little high bc of the fact tha the last 2 times I came here on the way to or from the airport, the server abslutely kissed my ass and did an outstanding job, but she was terrible, unapologetic, and unprofessional. She also refused to let me speak to the manager, messed up our drink orders, would not give me an itemized copy of the check (lied and said she could not print it), and did not ask if we wanted anything else, did not say thank you, did not apologize. Anyways, Applebee's has never been my favorite, but regular food and subpar service at this particular location makes me feel generous for giving them even 1 star (I have never given a 1 star before tonight). I would have stayed a while longer and ordered a few more drinks if this girls terrible attitude wasn't so distracting and neglectful."
