Jon G.,"Manteno, IL",0,44,4,5.0,5/30/2017,"First off our service was outstanding!!  Our waitress was so nice and kept checking on us and was actually engaging in small talk with us,  my wife and I both like that!!  Small talk makes you feel more comfortable!!  Anyway our food was outstanding as well.  Nice and hot!  I mean for your typical chain food restaurant this was really good."
JohnandTracy A.,"Farina, IL",12,9,,5.0,3/21/2017,"Everytime my wife & l go out on a date night we choose Applebee's in Salem, Illinois. The food is excellent & the staff are so very friendly. Best place in the area to eat."
Craig R.,"Kinmundy, IL",0,1,,2.0,6/19/2016,"6/18/16 Staff was disorganized, service was lacking. Manager asked how it was I responded ""Not great"". He says ""Oh good glad to hear it"". Got my steak I ordered medium, it was close to we'll done. Asked for A1 sauce and they're out. Got the bill and there's two $1 charges for a side they neglected to tell us was an upcharge. Food was ok, staff and management needs improvement."
Dave C.,"Palatine, IL",10,216,120,4.0,8/23/2015,"Standard Applebee's fare - easy access from 2 hotels and right off the freeway.  We went on a busy Saturday night, got good, fast service, a variety of food choices, a few key specials to save money.  Everything was cooked right; served hot.  Waitress came back to check on us a few times to refill drinks, ensure all was fine."
Austin T.,"Crystal Lake, IL",0,11,2,1.0,10/17/2016,Want to listen to children scream from every corner of the restaurant!? Than this is the place for you!
Khalid A.,"Studio City, CA",37,63,22,4.0,6/18/2015,Nicest little Applebee's you ever seen great service from our waitress Haley and great new sandwich list try the pub philly it was great!
Pablo V.,"Berwick, ME",8,20,5,2.0,5/21/2015,First and last time here. Shrimp on salad was cold. Should have at least be lukewarm with the dish I ordered. Food and app came at same time.Never again. I'm off to Denny's now
Ash S.,"Paducah, KY",20,5,1,1.0,6/8/2013,"This was, by far, one of the worst eating experiences (service wise) we've had in a looong time.  The food would've been typical had we gotten what we ordered. What was supposed to be an hour long eating experience turned into over two. We ordered a mixed appetizer (quesadillas, dip, mozzarella sticks, buffalo chicken), 2 corn dog kids meals, a burger, and pasta.   We received the wrong appetizer, wrong sandwich, and one corn dog. No refills. Had to chase our waiter down for any help. No spoons for applesauce.  We aren't that difficult to please but making a 4 year old wait 30 min after everyone else's food arrived to get theirs...and it's too hot to even eat then?  And forgetting basically everything else?   Great to go if you don't actually want what you order and prefer no refills, etc. otherwise, check out one of the local mom and pop restaurants. They have to be better than this!! Also... Fellow military families, this place says they support military but in actuality don't offer anything more than the ""priveledge"" of seeing a signed banner on the wall. This particular location does not offer the chain discount or support in any way as they claim."
Anna M.,"La Valle, WI",19,21,75,2.0,4/11/2015,"Food is tasty but the service is terrible. They don't know what they are doing!!!!! VERY an experience people - including manager. Saturday at dinner time is very busy so first you gotta wait for your table for a while, then the order came in incomplete, then they serve something which we never ordered.  So when you planning to go there be prepared to eat fast because the next customers are waiting for the table - that's exactly how the whole service is acting."
Michael A.,"Breese, IL",0,8,,1.0,6/10/2012,Manager is terrible. In her view the manager is always right. If you order a 9oz sirloin be prepared to receive a 7oz steak. We ordered 2 9oz steaks and there was clearly a size difference with one but instead of replacing it she decided to give us a long winded explanation. Manager needs to take some more customer service training.
Jim R.,"Spokane, WA",459,46,36,3.0,8/28/2010,"It is what it is, it's Appleby's. Food was good, service was unusually slow today."
Chris W.,"Palmetto, FL",6,24,,5.0,1/17/2013,What a great staff. Doesn't hurt that a lot of the waitresses are attractive either.
