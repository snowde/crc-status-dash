Mike B.,"Salem, OR",40,198,43,3.0,6/29/2011,"My partner and I stopped in for a beverage and some snacks yesterday.  We were lucky enough to hit them during their Happy Hour with $3 beverages and half price appetizers.   Even though the Sampler Platter of appetizers was NOT on the selection we went with it anyway because after doing the math, it would have cost us more to get the three appetizers we wanted even at half price, and we would have had too much food.  I suggest that they should add their Sampler Platter to the appetizer menu anyway because they serve less food and still make a profit. Being Summer (or at least that is what the calendar says) I opted for a frozen LEMONADOES drink.  Yes, that is NOT a misspelling...for some reason these chain restaurants try to spell words with cutesy twists.  My partner went tried and true with a Hefeweizen. Total cost for the two drinks and appetizer platter was just over $18.00. While I still don't recommend Applebee's for a full dinner, drinks and a few nibbles is a good bet."
Elizabeth W.,"Sierra Vista, AZ",9,5,,3.0,7/23/2012,"Went in for lunch, planned on having dessert but our waitress brought us the bill with out asking if we wanted any. She lost out on a sale and therefore better tip. My food was very good. I will be back, just remember wait staff, always try to up sell, it may mean a bigger tip for you."
Cedric N.,"Beaverton, OR",301,163,1385,5.0,12/2/2013,I came in late last night and I had a blast! My friend Cory I have known for over 8 years is the GM here.  They restaurant just had a renovation done and it looks amazing inside! Come check it out! Try the chicken and Strimp.
Dan H.,"Salem, OR",5,10,,5.0,3/22/2012,"Will defenatly be going back to here. Lunch prices were very good. Took very little time for the food to arive. I ordered the lunch combo and my wife had a salad. My combo was great but my wife thought the salad was to spicy. The staff was amazing, my wife let the server know about the salad and the manager came out and apologized about the salad and even gave us a $10 gift card to come back. Will come back and defenatky gonna tell everyone about the great service."
Allison G.,"Salem, OR",0,6,,1.0,8/15/2014,"Well I set myself up for this one by thinking maybe I could actually get some good food here for once. I was wrong. The staff was friendly this time although I felt like the manager approached us too often.. Maybe that's just because I was trying to eat. I got the happy hour 1/2 special.. My boyfriend and I shared the boneless wings which were only like half covered in the sauce. One even only had some on the tip. I got the cheeseburger sliders, which came out very pink..... How hard is it to fully cook a hamburger that small? I asked for them to make me new ones but get them to go, they were nice and apologetic. When I got my to go bag we left and went home. I was starving so I sat down to eat at home and my little cheeseburger sliders were again, not thoroughly cook. I know I said this in my last review but I won't eat here again even if they pay me. No matter what, I will not be dragged into it again."
Niik I.,"Tualatin, OR",2,35,,1.0,4/27/2012,Day after Halloween trick no treat!!!.9.49 for a plate on nachos with barely any meat or cheese.the only flavoring on these chips was the meat juice. BOO HISS!
Lily L.,"Salem, OR",41,180,12,2.0,9/15/2011,"SERVER  CASSANDRA was PMS-ING AT ASIANS... at least that's how I felt. Your server thanks a white family for coming in.. then hugs another white person.. helps another white family (while your request get IGNORED,1 refill and 1 shooter both asked at the SAME TIME) and then sees you and frown and has insincere apology. It is upsetting that a refill, just one, the only one we ever asked for comes after 15 minutes and it is wrong, and then 20 mins the shooter comes (half melted)... Those two things a server can prepare, it isnt even the kitchen's fault, if it is the food coming at different times I can understand.  Asians tip bad? If that was what the server thought, well she is stupid.  I am not uneducated nor uncivilized. After her bad treatment I left 10% instead of 18%. The worst part is she has been a server for 8 years! Let me repeat EIGHT (8) years but no customer service skills? Honestly the door holder/opener was a lot nicer. Honestly I go there for the food, but when a bad service affects the food it is an issue. I mean if she is being racist, that's even a bigger issue, and I feel that was it. We were dressed nice but not like in suits, our clothing had no stain or holes, and me and my mom carried a designer purse, its not like we LOOKED like hobos.  why 2 stars? The manager acknowledged the issue when I called him. He gave us a refund which I was surprised since I only called because I felt that treating someone that way was not okay.  ONLY CONCERN: since I will get a refund, I am afraid the waitress might have my address and go revenge on me or something. Remember: worst server: Cassandra best server: Jason"
Alex A.,"Albany, OR",270,38,10,4.0,9/5/2012,We had an early dinner at this property and the food was very good and the service was outstanding.  We will be back to visit and and would recommend this property to all my friends.
Tim T.,"Salem, OR",1,5,,5.0,4/4/2012,Amazing service and karaoke is awesome! RC is the man!
Tami H.,"Payette, ID",2,15,2,3.0,3/23/2011,Half price appetizers are a cheap solution for dinner. Wonton tacos are an interesting combination. This place was mobbed for a Wednesday night.
Jando S.,"Queens, New York, NY",2562,3285,14346,3.0,2/22/2007,"Applebee's is all over the place in Salem, there are several locations, but none are more needed than this Lancaster location as restaurants are spread out far and apart. While the parking is cramped, it is likely to stay that way all throughout the afternoon all the way into dinner. From a food standpoint, this Applebee's has been fairly decent, although consistent with the rest of its sister chains. Service has always been your average teenager / young adult taking orders and maintaining the service. One should go here before 4PM to take advantage of their half-off appetizers special on weekdays."
Jeremy S.,"Salem, OR",3,19,,5.0,8/16/2011,"This Salem Applebee's location is the best I have been too. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The food always comes exactly as ordered, no matter what substitutions you ask for, and always tastes good."
Noelle M.,"San Francisco, CA",212,407,163,4.0,8/18/2008,"I enjoyed cheap drinks, good food, and fun times with friends here on a monthly basis while in college."
