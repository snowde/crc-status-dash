Darlene L.,"1, NC",44,101,97,2.0,12/21/2017,It has been awhile since we ate here. Stopped in because it was convenient to grocery shop after. Well this trip reminds me why we avoid it... 1) service is slow 2) food order was wrong when arrived at the table 3) asked for additional condiment...NEVER arrived  4) took forever to get correct food 5) server dropped the check and started talking with another server (overheard cuss words in conversation) and did not take the card that was ready.
Kelly B.,"Kannapolis, NC",12,3,,1.0,9/21/2017,The food was below par. I spent 31.00 on food that tasted like they took it from the trash. Fries where hards and burned. Soutnwesten soup was so hot you could taste nothing but that. Applebees needs to go out of bussiness. They suck and the food sucks worst.
Emily H.,"Liberty, NC",33,4,3,2.0,1/13/2017,We waited an hour and fifteen minutes for our food. My husband's came with fries which looked they'd been scraped off the bottom  of the barrel and were very few. My son got a chicken wrap. Half of it was a good size and the other half had barely anything in it. The waitress was extremely nice and trying to be helpful. At the end she tried to find the manager to discount our meal and couldn't find him. I'd seen him at many other tables getting complaints so I'm sure he was hiding at that point. She offered the only discount she could by taking the drinks off the bill which I accepted just to get out of there. Won't be back.
George D.,"York, SC",106,340,109,2.0,11/30/2015,I did not pick this place... it was picked by the customer.  Typical Applebee's... I will admit in full disclosure I have never been a fan.  I ordered a chicken dish - Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp.  I asked to sub broccoli for the potatoes.  In classic APplebee's fashion I was informed - NO SUBSTITUTIONS!!  How ridiculous.  How difficult is it to sub broccoli for potatoes - especially when you are trying to eat Paleo as best you can from time to time. I won't go back unless I have to again with customers.
Carmon W.,"Rockwell, NC",0,1,,1.0,12/20/2016,Ate with friends from out of town. Friend ordered a burger that was served raw. Sent it back and it took an hour. Took so long that they had to get it to go because they had a long drive back. I've always liked Applebees. Not sure what's going on with this one.
Micah T.,"Concord, NC",0,2,,1.0,1/13/2017,"This was the worst experience ever. Don't go here. Forever on service, stale fries, stale chips. Got the same appetizer special as my friend and both came out completely different.... they had to wash silverware to bring us after our food arrived (10 min to wait for silverware) came dripping wet and crusty with leftover food... the dip? Shit... whole experience... waitstaff, manager, food... straight shit..."
Daisy A.,"El Cajon, CA",1,7,3,1.0,9/22/2016,Ordered a simple medium rare 6 oz steak and got a well done steak instead. Complained. Go my plate re cooked and got a steak that looked like a chunk had been taken off the cow directly in the fucking kitchen. Moral of the story. Don't eat here but if you do...don't order any kind of steak because clearly they can't get it right.
Stephenie W.,"Rockwell, NC",13,10,4,2.0,7/5/2016,"Consistently bad service. Food was ok - but you walk in and it is typically an inconvenience for them to seat you, then you wait some more. Asked for a simple (less costly) substitution on a dish and they deny they can do it (come on, even Burger King does better). Out of three people eating, two water glasses sat empty for over 10 minutes after asking for refills (then reminding about the refills). Sorry, water is always the server fault - she only had two tables. Why work a customer service position, if you do not understand what customer service is..."
Dalton B.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",97,1,,1.0,10/23/2016,"I'm currently still sitting here and the service is so bad it's already a 1 star experience. It started with us standing at the door for about 10 minutes while a waitress walked past us, made eye contact, and walked over to talk to another waitress. The bartender walked over finally and asked how many and when we requested the only server that seemed to actually be doing his job she got an attitude and walked to the back and never came back. The manager came over and we explained to her that we wanted to sit in his section even if we had to sit and a dirty table and the bartender said ""I tried helping them and they just wanted to sit at a dirty table"" to the other customers at the bar. Then when we ordered someone needed a second and he walked to another table and then came back and said ""This is why I wait to take orders when everybody is ready."" People that came in after we ordered now have their food and we just got appetizers. We will not be coming back and will be sure to share our experience with everyone we know who likes Applebee's. I don't recommend going to this one. Applebee's I hope you do better if I give you another chance down the road."
Allen L.,"Charlotte, NC",0,42,5,2.0,8/18/2015,"All Applebee's are pretty weak; let's be honest.  You will see one or two servers here who care, but for the most part, it's a bunch of employees who think they're God's gift and that they don't have to do anything work-related.  Lindsey, the AM bartender is A-OK! in my book (+++), but she gets busy FAST being behind the bar.  Off-duty employees like to hang out there and chat with the on-duty staff about dumb shit and take all day ordering their discounted food.  Come on, people, it's Applebee's: who the F are they???  This location IS in a good location (easy access); I'll give 'em that.  IF you go though, don't be surprised if you're dissatisfied by the end of your visit here.  You've been warned..."
Susan M.,"Salisbury, NC",0,7,6,1.0,9/7/2015,Went in around 2:00pm for lunch. Party of 8. Waitress took our order and brought our drinks. An hour later another waitress brought our food. Our order was all messed up. Had to ask for our salads 3x. To say the least we really had an awful dinner!
Lisha P.,"Atlanta, GA",2,45,53,5.0,12/5/2015,I'm a vegetarian and came to this place with my boyfriend for quick lunch. I didn't had lot of options but the server recommended nachos. The manager came and asked me if they can put anything else on the nachos for me. Overall the service was amazing and everyone is really friendly even the server! She's a sweetheart. I definitely recommend those nachos for anyone who is vegetarian just ask them if they can put bean and corn salsa on it. Thank you guys :)
Stephanie M.,"Clover, SC",22,185,483,4.0,6/23/2011,"We stopped in for a quick bite before catching a movie around the corner from this Applebee's last night.  Yep it's a chain and you know what to expect...And last night was no exception....however apparently Wednesday night is karaoke night at this Salisbury location and can I just say ""wow"".  These folks were serious about it...some even brought their own music...hmmm. It was a little loud, but entertaining none the less except for the ones singing SO loud that you couldn't hear each other talk! As far as food goes, everything was cooked well and tasted good.  Our waitress was very friendly and accomodating to our requests.  We both ordered a salad along with our meal and they were HUGE and very good - honey mustard here is kinda tangy and I liked it!  We then both had burgers, I had the Quesadilla Burger that was kinda spicy, but very good served on a grilled tortilla and he had the Cowboy Burger and seemed pleased with it.  We ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Shooter and it was okay - nothing to write home about, but enough to satisfy my sweet tooth for the night. It's Applebee's - you know what you're in for when you try it...but if you're looking for karaoke on a weeknight....make the drive to Salisbury...it's something else :)"
Shelly S.,"Huntersville, NC",2,30,19,2.0,3/7/2015,"Wish I could comment on their food, the couple next to me had to send something back, next plate appeared fine.  I waited 10 minutes, 5 of which my menu was closed while waiters kept checking with other tables but didn't make eye contact, and no one even took a drink order."
Lynn M.,"Salisbury, NC",0,3,,1.0,10/21/2015,"Running out of a menu item is one thing....waiting until you bring the food out for 3 of the 4 diners to say something is a no-no!  Had to have a substitute if I wanted to eat with my family.  What I got was some dry and horrid looking food..it wasn't even done!...needless to say...even the waitress began to steer clear of the table after having to apologize multiple times. What's worse is, the manager never came out to apologize or fix it..had to just pay to get out of there."
Pamela O.,"Mocksville, NC",1,11,,1.0,1/18/2015,This restaurant seems to have trouble with consistency.  Last visit the oriental chicken salad was not prepared right.  This visit received grilled instead of fried chicken with salad.  Major delay in substitute order of sweet versus regular fries.  Asked for manager.  After delay he listened and said i don't blame  you for being unhappy.  Offered free dessert of all fries were finished.  Think i will have to figure out a way to make salad at home.
Pamela O.,"Salisbury, NC",11,10,,3.0,1/16/2014,"Went to Applebees for the Oriental chicken salad.  We sat at a high table in the bar area.  We lasted less than 5 minutes.  The Karaoke was extremely loud, and one of the staff decided to have a conversation with a customer on an upper level by standing behind me and talking over the music.    The hostess offered to reseat us, but there was no area in the restaurant that was going to be at a reasonable decibel level.     I thought Karaoke had run its course, and I certainly did not expect to see that in a chain. Restaurant was not very busy so not sure if others don't appreciate Karaoke or just had other things to do on Wed. night. Went back November.  Changed some menu items.  Like the Sweet Josie beer.   Love the oriental salad."
Allison Z.,"Salisbury, NC",0,7,,5.0,1/12/2015,Amazing service by Lacey J and the burgers were to die for. We will be back!
Kim F.,"Lexington, NC",1,83,,2.0,5/9/2012,"I stopped in on Saturday for a late lunch since this Applebees was close to where I needed to go and I had heard they re-vamped their menu with some new items, so I thought I'd give it a try. The first thing I noticed that it was FREEZING in the place and I overheard another  diner commenting to the waitress how chilly it was and she blew her off. I ordered French Onion soup, which was loaded with cheese, so that was a good thing, because my entree was tasteless.  I got the chicken roll-ups and they were  not warm and had no taste.  The sweet tea was weak & I had to add sweetener.  The service was about so-so for this chain, neither great nor awful.  I think this chain restaurant has about run it's course. I'm not saying I'll never go  back to an Applebees, it just isn't my ""go to"" place."
John Q.,"China Grove, NC",0,7,,1.0,9/22/2013,"Worst food, and service of any applebee's I've been to.  There was a friend of one of the waitstaff there helping bus tables with a dip in his mouth...he was spitting in a cup right beside my table.  Totally unprofessional waitstaff and food tasted like crap."
