Kaylee S.,"San Jose, United States",1,58,6,3.0,16/7/2017,This location is so beautiful inside! Food was decent but services sucked. Our waitress had 3 other tables and not once checked in with us. Our drink cups were never refilled and the manager even was walking around and never said anything. Asked for ranch with our meal and didn't get it until our food was practically gone!
Arturo F.,"San Jose, United States",103,1,,1.0,16/4/2017,"Very VERY disappointing.  We were seated as soon as we walked in but the person who sat us decided to throw or ""toss"" the menus to us and then just walked away. We had to wait 30-45 minutes for our server to come to our table to ask us what we wanted to drink. Needless to say that it took the same amount of time to get any free refills that we later found out we got charged for. We were told that we could order food and appetizers from the kiosk on the table but it did not work. We had to wait another 15-20 minutes for our server to come back to take our order (the restaurant was not busy at all). When we finally got our order most of the items were wrong and when we told the person who brought us our food if we could get the ordered corrected she roller her eyes and walked away to get our waiter. Over all the experience at this Applebee's was less than satisfactory and extremely unprofessional. Whenever our server asked if we needed anything he usually had to come back a second time to be reminded of what we wanted.  We will probably not be visiting this location anytime in the future. Our $90 bill was definitely NOT worth it."
Gracie L.,"San Jose, United States",32,1,,1.0,30/3/2017,"Our first visit to this location: My husband and I were seated after about 10 minutes of waiting in the reception area. Server #1 took our orders as soon as we were ready and was able to serve us our drinks after about 15 minutes. Said server informed us our appetizer would be ready in about 8 to 10 minutes. After about 30 minutes of waiting for our appetizer, server #2 informed us that server #1 went to his lunch break and that she would take care of our orders.  At this point, we were ok waiting because we were watching a basketball game. But after another 15 minutes and no updates whatsoever from any one of the servers, I began to wonder what's going on with our orders.  We were still sitting there without any food on our table when server #1 came back from his lunchbreak. I saw the look on his face when he saw us. He was surprised to see that we were still sitting there and haven't gotten any of our food! By this time I told him to just cancel all the orders and we'd rather leave.  But he apologized and talked to his manager and told us that the appetizer would be ready in 10 to 15 minutes at no charge. So we decided to wait since it's free! And told him that we want it in a to-go box since it's getting really late and I was starting to feel sleepy. As for my entree, I have ordered their Cedar Salmon.  Server #1 informed me that they ran out of salmon and that our orders were just sitting there in the back and somebody had forgotten to prepare any of them that's why there was a 1 hour and 30 minutes delay. I was given the option to change my order to something else but was told it's going to take another 30 minutes. Are you kidding me?!? I didn't even know at this point if I should trust the server or not, since he initially told us to wait 8-10 minutes for our appetizer that took 1 hour and 45 minutes to be ready. In addition to this, My husband's order never came out.  And then finally server #3 got our free appetizer ready but it was served in a plate. I specifically told server #1 that I want it in a to-go box. And so server #3 grabbed the plate and went back to the kitchen. Server #1 came up to our table and started apologizing again saying that they won't be able to provide our free appetizer anymore and that the manager did not allow it. My husband and I looked at each other really confused. We explained to server #1 that server#3 handed us the appetizer already, and that we just had her put it in a to-go box. And server #1 said, ""oh, then they did listen to me!""   Obviously, there seemed to be a lot of miscommunication going on and I think the employees need to be trained more.  They need to improve and work on A LOT of stuff! 3 servers were helping us and yet we had to wait that long to get our food ready. Not even all the orders. just the appetizer. Unacceptable. And I am not the most impatient person I know.  The two customers who came in a few minutes after us who were sitting right next to our table had the same issue with their orders and decided to leave the restaurant with nothing. Not even a complimentary gift card from the manager. I feel sorry for them. They waited almost the same time we did and only got their drinks. I give Applebee's one star for not charging for our appetizer. This experience made me decide to never come back to this location again."
Gloria P.,"San Jose, United States",22,57,10,3.0,6/5/2017,"The service was great!  And the food was good as well.  BUT, I probably won't come back to this Applebee's because parking is horrible."
Kristina N.,"Milpitas, United States",73,126,142,4.0,13/3/2017,"Got invited as part of their soft opening since I work in the neighborhood on Sunday. To be honest when I saw that they were building an Applebee, I was like ""why?"" I am not a fan of this chain restaurant, one being the service is just horrible & that goes for staffs & managers. Second the food is way below average, everytime I come to any of the Applebee's locations I never end up finishing my food. But hey since it was free and it's literally a 1 minute walk from my house I decided why not. The interior of the restaurant was super nice, new ofcourse, looks huge but since I didn't walk around i'm not quite sure of how big it is. It's nice to have a bar within the 10 mile radius though. Anyways the staffs were very welcoming & attentive. Its always like that in the beginning of course but I pray it won't change with this location. Our server was on top of her game, was a server at lots of high dining restaurant before so I know how it is. Anyways, lets go straight to the food. We ordered cheese sticks for appetizers and its so much better than Red Robin. My boyfriend ordered the new whisky bacon burger while I had the shrimp stir fry (not sure of the name) it came with white rice, wontop strips, broccoli and red pepper i believed. My son had the mac & chz with chicken & mashed potatoes. My boyfriend described his burger as ""super juicy"" he got it done ""pink."" He put bbq in it as well and said its actually the best thing he've ever tried at Applebees. The burger itself was quite big & my bf can easily eat a half pound burger with fries but he couldn't even finish this burger. Moving onto my food, I like it! It was different, but delicious. The only cons I have about it was I was debating whether to get that or the thai shrimp salad and i saw how the salad was a ""lighter fare"" so i went with this one cause I wanted a bigger portion but when the dish came out it was literally so little.. the rice were literally 1/4 of a cup, all spreaded out on the plate to make it look like it's a lot.  I was a little disappointed as to how small the portion is, I don't eat a lot and i was still hungry after finishing my plate. I didn't try my son's food but the portion for a kid's meal was pretty huge. All the plates' presentations was on point. The blue moon was super fresh & the strawberry shake was one of the best shakes I've ever had. So kudos for that. Overall the experience was surprisingly amazing. I pray that everything stay this way because I will definitely be back if it is."
Melanie N.,"Downtown, San Jose, United States",7,109,36,1.0,9/4/2017,I didn't want to believe the chef going to messed up the food again this second times around but he/she did. It was so so salty that my kid couldn't even eat her  fries. The baby back ribs were filled with peppers. The only thing we actually thought it was edible was the appetizer cheese-sticks. I have made complaints to the server and the manager/superior when they came to asked us how was the food.
Stephanie M.,"Edenvale, San Jose, United States",68,1,,1.0,9/5/2017,"By far the worst experience ever!! If you really want to eat Applebee's, go to the plant!! The service was HORRIBLE Our server was inexperienced, for a lack of a better word!! Food came out cold and disgustingly bland!! I ordered a classic burger which according to the server and manager is NOT served with lettuce and or tomatoes! The menu clearly states that the burger comes with lettuce, tomato, onions and pickles!! The manager was NO help at all! She lacked customer service skills!! If it were possible to put negative stars, I would!"
Monica A.,"San Jose, United States",6,15,,4.0,11/6/2017,This is for the curbside service. It isn't really curbside since there is no designated parking but nonetheless have never had issues and I've ordered to go 3x. Haven't eaten inside  but my food is always hot and fresh. Keesha is super friendly and takes care of you ensuring your order is correct. Jonathan has an awesome personality that's welcoming and warm. The only thing I'd suggest is to keep someone in the area since it's on the side of the place next to the kitchen and most of the staff are too busy to acknowledge your presence. Also it's not cool that while the staff is on their break they're smoking right by the entrance door. That's the only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars.
Karla S.,"San Jose, United States",0,34,3,1.0,28/4/2017,"Let's do this in terms of minutes.. 0 - number of minutes to be seated.  5 - number of minutes for our server to arrive. Drink and food orders give.   20 - number of minutes from ordering to getting our drinks. Inclusive of hunting down 2 different servers and asking them to help, since ours was nowhere to be found.  35 - number of minutes from ordering to receiving the wrong order. One plate sent back, request for ketchup.  7 - number of minutes spent waiting for ketchup before hunting it down on my own.  20 - number of minutes spent waiting for correct food before hunting down a manager and asking for my food to be boxed and removed from the bill.  10 - number of minutes before receiving boxed food.  1 - number of minutes spent hunting down the server who ACTUALLY served us to give her a tip vs the server assigned to our table who did nothing.  7 - number of minutes it took to pack up the kids, get home, and realize they packed up the WRONG MEAL.  There were plenty of staff, but none were doing anything. At any given time, at least FIVE were at the registers. One person actually never moved the entire time we were there.  Lots of interesting conversation with other tables who were equally baffled by the service.  The kicker? On the way out, the hostess, who had no idea what our experience was like apologizing to us for the inconvenience."
Miguel B.,"San Jose, United States",0,1,,4.0,25/3/2017,"I have gone into Applebee's a couple of times as I live very close... love the food but at times the service is very skeptical... I notice one guy that I have seen a couple times and he works very hard... I think his name is Andrew. He seems to be one of the only ones that is bussing tables, serving food to People and always helping other workers."
James A.,"San Jose, United States",0,11,5,1.0,10/5/2017,We went 4 of us ordered 5 Entrees We got three together and the other two came like 8 to 10 minutes after. So some of us eating and some watching. Tue steak came out burned black on both side my sone Couldn't chew it. The chicken on two other orders were extremely over cooked too dry. And the pasta is soaking in sauce.  It's waiter they go to dry or too wet.  The coffee was cold. When the kids ask for refill it takes very long time.  I feel bad to write this review but we spent like $90 And none of us were happy.  Will try it again may be in a few months giving the management time to make things right with all this negative reviews people write.
Alex S.,"Roseville, United States",0,4,,1.0,4/10/2017,this experience made me wanna hang myself.   how do you fuck up an order 5 times in a row.
Lynn P.,"San Jose, United States",0,6,,1.0,1/4/2017,"Staff is not trained well and long wait times wondering who will serve you or check on you. I had a simple order and it was a little busy but not to wait 20 minutes for even the water. I informed the wait staff, cancelled what I had planned and informed the manager when leaving. Take all the people waiting at the door and use them to help."
melody f.,"San Martin, United States",0,6,1,1.0,6/5/2017,Sat down - ordered buffalo wings regular  with ranch got spicy with extra sauce... Ordered chicken quesadilla with sour cream  got the quesadilla and had to ask for the sour cream 3 times and when we got it the food was cold! We were told your sour cream is here now!!! Crappy service!!!!
Deanne J.,"Sparks, United States",0,10,,2.0,2/10/2017,"Food is great!  Never fails. But, the service is horrible. Servers are always very kind and always working their butts off, but after half a dozen times of having dinner at Applebee's, they just can't get it right. Appetizers and salads are constantly coming all at the same time as dinner. There isn't enough room on the table to hold EVERYTHJNG at once. Our drinks are not refreshed. We always have to ask. Our beer finally comes as we pay the bill (happened on more than one occasion). What was funny was this last time we were there the manager was soooooo concerned about the tables and booths being clean for the customers and yelling orders to employees,  when I think she should have been more concerned about getting the servers help or the cooks (not sure who to blame) so there was some organization and silverware on the tables and food that comes out when it should.......  idk, but something isn't working. If the food wasn't consistently delicious, we would definitely be going somewhere else."
Brian H.,"Stockton, United States",0,42,,4.0,6/5/2017,"Took about 15 minutes to come by for drink orders, another 10 to actually get them. The place was almost empty too so I was thinking this was going to be a bad experience. But then they switched our server and he was awesome! Jimmie was his name if I remember correctly. The food was as ordered, and delicious. We ordered dessert after we finished and he comped the dessert because we had to wait so long in the beginning! We didn't even ask. Jimmie you rock dude!"
Rob M.,"Edenvale, San Jose, United States",0,2,,1.0,9/7/2017,"Just awful. I can't think of one positive thing to say. Good, service, drinks... all just terrible. I hope management realizes they have a serious problem on their hands. It's a shame because the location could really draw in a good crowd.  Having run restaurants before, I can say it's time fir an overhaul - managers, front of house, back of house... need to reset it all."
Emily L.,"San Jose, United States",1,6,,1.0,17/3/2017,Just don't. Just wait until all the staff gets properly trained. It's really not worth your time. You wait for hours and still don't get what you ordered.
Stacey T.,"Sunol, United States",151,40,22,1.0,6/9/2017,"Krystin waited on us in the bar today. Decided to go in for happy hour, deals on drinks and half of apps as advertised. We ordered the ""combo plate"" off the appetizers menu thinking it was going to be 50% off. When the bill came our waitress let us know that the combo plate wasn't on the happy hour list of appetizers that are half off. (9 out of the 12 or so appetizers are on that list). When we asked if they could honor it so we would know for future reference, we were greeted by the manager (the manager made us wait for her for 5 minutes after we had finished our meal). The manager told us that she could not honor it because it was not on the list of half off apps (even though I said their advertisement was misleading). She had a snarky attitude and did not seem in any way at all wanting to help to resolve the issue. Neither our waitress or the manager seemed to have a smile on their face from the second we walked into the door. Taking business elsewhere; wish I saw that they only had 2 stars before going into their restaurant."
Missa M.,"San Jose, United States",96,15,8,5.0,11/9/2017,"This review is for Ashley, the bartender.  We were hesitant to come to the new Applebee's because of the reviews. I'm so glad we finally came in. We like to sit on the bar have some drinks, appetizer and meal and Ashley goes above and beyond! I'm very indecisive on choosing my food and always ask questions on suggestions I really like her honesty and everything she has suggested has been great. We will definitely continue to come in as regulars and look forward to seeing her friendly face."
