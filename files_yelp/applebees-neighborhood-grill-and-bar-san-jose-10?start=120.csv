Ria B.,"Edenvale, San Jose, United States",131,1,,1.0,17/9/2017,"Worst service ever!!!! Don't get the Whiskey BBQ burger, sauce tastes like shit !!! Spinach artichoke dip was as salty as the Pacific Ocean!!! Cocktail napkins instead real ones. BBQ sauce was charged on the bill. More workers than customers and still had to wave someone down for service! Overall TRASH, just FREAKING TRASH!!!"
Marlene M.,"San Jose, United States",13,18,24,3.0,25/3/2017,"My son and I thought we would try the newly opened Apple Bees on Cottle for dinner. We were greeted in a friendly manner and seated right away.  Our waitress took our drink orders and once she brought them took our order and that's when the trouble began.   I ordered grilled shrimp in a bowl with potatoes and grilled veges. My son ordered grilled chicken, mashed potatoes and grilled veges.  His order was brought out but mine did not make an appearance. The waitress said it should be right out.  We'll after going back and forth about the goings on of my meal it came out in parts and not fully what I ordered. Finally the manager came out with the grilled veges and apologized about the mix up and said he would take my meal off and if we wanted dessert would give for free. The grilled veges unfortunately we're not cooked and cold.  Darn it, but just had to laugh at the whole thing.   The manager and waitress were very friendly, helpful and apologetic about the whole thing and yes they took the error off the meal.  My son's meal he stated was good.  I think we will wait a few more months until they iron out the kinks and give em another try. After all they really tried and it was a learning curve for the new staff."
Marilyn W.,"San Jose, United States",0,18,,5.0,17/3/2017,First time here to this brand new restaurant which is very very nice.  We ordered at 11:18AM and food was delivered at 11:33AM (only 15 min).  My burger was good & cooked exactly as I  had ordered and  my husband enjoyed his fish & chips ( he is a fish & chips afficionado).  Server was perfect (Shane) ....overall very good experience.  WE WILL BE BACK.
Mikey P.,"Dublin, United States",0,7,,5.0,22/9/2017,"Hey it's brand new! Cool looking place, food is edible, staff are trying hard and they have nice TVs. Good choice of beers and liquor. Support your local bar! You don't have a lot of choice so let's patronage and make it better."
Shella Y.,"Milpitas, United States",0,32,6,1.0,17/3/2017,"Service was terrible... We waited for a long time for EVERYTHING... For our server, order our drinks..our food.. And the food was too salty.. They put extra pound of salt on evrything even the kids fries-too much seasoning! Won't go back again!"
Carlos B.,"San Jose, United States",29,4,3,1.0,26/3/2017,Bad service all the team crew standing around in a group pretending they don't see the eyes of people needing in need  where's their food. Really disappointed
Felicia O.,"Tulare, United States",253,46,7,1.0,16/3/2017,Worst service at an apple bees I've ever had! This place hardly has anyone her eating and it took them over 30 minutes to bring my server to me to order my food... I even ordered it on the iPad they have at the table and it never even sent to the kitchen. My server is rude and unprofessional--- absolutely disappointed in the lack of service here especially since it's new. Do not eat here
Montebello 2.,"San Jose, United States",0,1,,2.0,19/3/2017,Way too long for service..Don't care if this place is fairly new and underestimated the crowd. It just unacceptable to almost wait for 2 hrs to get your good after being seated..
Sam P.,"San Jose, United States",0,5,,5.0,18/5/2017,"My wife and i visit at least once a week and sit at the bar. We normally get waited on by Ashley who is one of the most friendly and efficient bartenders. She makes our time there fun and enjoyable. I can't comment about the rest of the place, but sitting at the bar with her is awesome."
Gordana D.,"San Jose, United States",0,32,6,1.0,31/3/2017,This place is horrible. Our food came 20 minutes late & they screwed up our order as well.
Jay H.,"San Jose, United States",0,5,,2.0,18/7/2017,For some reason a server thinks it's ok to go to the bar and hug up on the Bartender. I have the unfortunate task of figuring out that they are together. The flamboyant part of it all from the server gets me. I was willing to let it go but it's bad. I don't see a man all over his female employee at other businesses so anyways Applebees needs to end all that.
Mark D.,"San Jose, United States",0,7,,5.0,29/7/2017,Great location with many TVs at this contemporary Applebees. Great servers with attention to detail. This will probably be a good spot to visit during football season with all the TVs available.
Linda S.,"San Jose, United States",4,29,7,2.0,28/3/2017,"My husband and I liked the food tonite, but the serving staff fell short. It felt like a dysfunctional crew in a soup kitchen. It's trying to orchestrate it's process like Chile's, where one takes your order and another rushes out of the kitchen with your meal and confirms what you ordered. Our food server got things mixed up with his wording and my husband ate my dinner thinking it was his. Then the Manager had to come and straighten things out, but we felt like the server should have handled it. It would be nice if the crew could check on refills and let people eat without a lot of unnecessary chatting. To top it off, a lady was double parked in the walkway as we exited. The parking in this center is terrible and people don't look, so be careful of you and your car!"
Clif C.,"Palo Alto, United States",0,16,,5.0,27/4/2017,"Avalon is a wonderful waitress. She comes by a lot, she is full of energy, moves fast, and keeps checking that your order is perfect. Me and my best friend were talking to another couple. We were all talking about how great Avalon is. Larry III and Luis are nice too. This is a beautiful Applebees cuz there's windows all over. THANKS AVALON!"
Crystal T.,"San Jose, United States",49,19,1,5.0,25/4/2017,"Yum... our to go order was on point. Friendly woman running the to go section, she made sure we had everything we needed. I'll be coming back for sure . Great service."
Ben C M.,"San Jose, United States",15,10,,4.0,12/8/2017,"UPDATE:   Went there last week and what a difference!!!!  Service was friendly, prompt, polite, and they even got the order right. The server came back multiple times to check on us, and made sure everything was cooked to our liking. We will definitely go back many more times!"
James E.,"Santa Clara, United States",0,5,,4.0,19/4/2017,Ayrez is the man not sure if that's spelled right but seriously turned the night from maybe a 2 to 4 and he was not even our server he was a host. Our server was not attentive in the least. We had a issue with a overcooked steak but ayrez fixed it and ensured it was perfect and assured us he wanted to make sure we were happy.he even gave me a free coffee  wooo i also noticed he was the same way with everyone it made me feel like he really cared how our meal went. I apreciate that so much! I understand it's a new store with a new staff and if they all act like him this place will be great. He really turned the night around and got double the tip as our server....the food quality was great it did take a bit long but we were enjoyingva night out so that didnt bother me much.
David E.,"Los Gatos, United States",3,38,15,5.0,17/4/2017,"I was pleasantly surprised with the Southwest grilled steak salad. It was light crowd probably because it was a Monday night. I would of gave them 4 stars but their was a young man that was waiting on me and other tables. He really impressed me with how attentive he was with me and the other patrons. I hope the manager recognizes Brandon, it was his second day and he rocked it!"
Deanna B.,"San Jose, United States",0,1,,5.0,17/4/2017,"I had lunch at this Applebee's location today and ordered the 2 for $20 deal. We had the onion rings as the appetizer, which were hot and crispy and just nicely soft in the middle. Both entrees were also delicious. I had the Chinese Chicken Salad and my dining companion had the pasta with spinach and chicken. The entree portions were good sized, and very tasty. Our server was very pleasant, and her follow up was very good. The combination of these factors made for a surprisingly excellent dining experience. I would recommend visiting this Applebee's location, as stands out above others I have been to."
Lourdes R.,"San Jose, United States",0,4,,1.0,16/6/2017,"One star and I'm being generous. All alone and decided to enjoy a good meal. First, I was told there was a waiting list and to go to the bar area. Fine by me. Sat for 15 minutes. 3 people walked by and ignored me. So I left. At the entrance 2 people manning the entrance chatting and one with the phone in her hand, probably showing something to her coworker. I did tell them they should pay more attention to guests. Well, I will be going to the Plant where we are treated well. You would think my gray hair would have given me a bit more attention but I guess these young kids prefer to ignore old folks. It is soooo hot and not even a glass of water!!!!"
