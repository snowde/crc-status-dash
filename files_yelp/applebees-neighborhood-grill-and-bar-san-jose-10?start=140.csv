Michelle R.,"San Jose, United States",2,3,2,2.0,9/4/2017,"Not happy , I ordered 12 oz sirloin medium well , meaning little pink inside , I got it was well done . Ordered a lemon drop martini and throughout my whole meal still waiting. Service sucks waiter seemed like he did t care , never checked in on me and my husband , stopped another waiter she seemed like I don't care attitude. Mind u This my First time here and I will never come back again . Sucks because I hold this Applebee's to standard like all the others here in San Jose and it definitely was way below . Kids working here . You need to up your staff and the service. Only nice thing I have to say is when I finally got my lemon drop tasted good. But even with that the bar tender took forever and this place was NOT PACKED to have to wait as long as I did ...."
Jacqueline C.,"San Jose, United States",151,2,,2.0,27/3/2017,"I know they just opened this place so I can see why the service isn't so great. (Servers don't know the menu, long waits for menus, drinks, and food) but even worse is that honestly the food is pretty gross here. I've been to Applebee's before and it wasn't too bad and idk if it was due to the fact that this place is new or I don't know. All I know is I won't be coming back."
Aj S.,"Campbell, United States",30,1,,5.0,27/3/2017,"This Apple Bee's just opened up 2 weeks ago Walking in i was greeted with a warm welcoming from the door person ""Hi, Welcome to Apple Bee's"". I asked for a Bar seat, they said ""Theres no wait open seating at the Bar"" Awesome a local Bar i can just walk into with good food and a wide variety of drinks and food on the happy hour menu from mixed drinks, to beer, wine, and a nice selection of snacks and meals Upon entering the middle Dining room/Bar everything looks clean and brand new complete with a digital menu on the wall, game pads on the dining tables and numerous TV's. I took a seat at the Bar the very friendly staff immediately greeted me and got me a menu and some water. Having not been to Apple Bee's for my first time in years I asked for some ideas on popular appetizers and staff favorites. My Bartender/Server Hayden was incredibly helpful making a few suggestions of Customer Favorites and his own personal choices. I ended up ordering the Cedar Lemon Chicken and in only a matter of 10 mins or so i was served. The Chicken tasted savory and was nicely cooked with quinoa and rice on the side complimenting the sweet apple relish a top the juicy Lemon Chicken flavor for a Deliously tasty, chewy, sweet and savory combination. After finishing my meal i started engaging in a conversation with another person at the Bar introducing ourselves and making some small talk about the rain he offered me a Beer. Me not knowing what was on tap i asked my Bartender Hayden what they had he ran down the list I told him i prefer IPA's and he strongly recommended i give the Space Dust by Elysian a try. I couldn't be happier a strong hoppy taste and aroma with a smooth finish, Awesome Beer! Overall I enjoyed my experience at the Bar. It had a great Atmosphere, 6 or more Games on multiple TV's through out the room and other dining areasl, an all around awesome staff, comfortable seats, nicely priced happy hour menu, and friendly customers. I will definitely be coming back here soon."
Sheli K.,"San Jose, United States",0,10,11,3.0,19/6/2017,Food is ok...service and wait time not so great. Maybe because they just opened up but they need to step their game up
Alejandra P.,"San Jose, United States",30,2,,1.0,21/3/2017,"I know it has been only a week, but I had to leave a review. I try not to leave reviews as I do work in customer service and know that working in the restaurant business is also difficult. But tonight I had some of the worst experience I have had at a restaurant in a very very long time. My boyfriend son and I went in to give it a try. We walked in around seven in the evening, excited to try our new neighborhood Applebee's. The hostess told us it was a 20 min wait to be seated. I was thinking alright it's not a wait at all. We got seated in less then 20 min and waitress came by. She came by asked us what we would like to drink and if we would like any appetizers. Unfortunately our waitress came back and told us that they were out of our drinks that we had ordered. Totally fine, we understood so my boyfriend ordered a frozen lemonade, and I ordered a raspberry iced tea.... seems pretty simple right?  So we thought..... we also ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer. The waitress came and told us, she working on getting our entrees out. First all we hadn't even ordered our food, she had just taken our drinks and appetizer. 15 min pass by and she brings my son's milk. Five min pass by and they bring out our appetizer. Still no drinks at this point, just the milk. We finish the appetizer still no drinks or even the waitress to come by to take our order for the entree.  She walked past us several times and we tried getting her attention and she just continued walking. At this point my five year old was getting restless, and my boyfriend was getting aggravated. Finally after waiting another 30 min..... NOTHING!  I finally got up and just asked for our tab, I didn't want to leave with out paying for our two items that we had received. Our waitress brings us our check, and wanted to charge us for items that we never even received, I told her I was only going to pay for the items we did receive.  Another 15 min later she comes back and says that  her manager voided the whole bill. Not that it was much. No more then 10$ but then she said out appetizer was ready and she could pack it to go, not even bothering to see that we had already received them.  We probably would have stayed if she would have communicated with us like she had with the drinks, and had even bothered to take the rest of our order. Would it have been faster for us if we ordered through the tablet on the table?? Needless to say we won't be going back unless someone we know goes and has a good experience. Communication is key, and will keep your customers coming back, wether you're busy or not. Worst experience in a very very long time. Thank god Mod Pizza was next door because we were very hungry by the time we had left!"
K H.,"San Jose, United States",2,12,,1.0,20/3/2017,"Got there at 6:30, got seated within 5 minutes but they took for ever to get an order of buffalo wings and 2 French onion soups, when they did bring the food it took about 1 1/2 hours for the fries to even come out and then the food came out about 15 minutes later which was the wrong order, and when we finally got our food it was like 8:15, I was extremely in satisfied with customer service as well, I definitely will not be coming here for a while."
Mel G.,"Sunnyvale, United States",62,35,,5.0,30/7/2017,Great service! I've been here about 5-6 times within 2 months. Guilty pleasure...I love that happy hour happens twice! Food always comes out piping hot and the service from the time I come through the door until I leave is impeccable! If my server doesn't come by again within 5 min someone always comes but to check and see where we are at with ordering etc...it seems they work as a team! I also see the managers working just as hard to please the customers. I highly recommend this location!
Hugo G.,"Edenvale, San Jose, United States",0,5,,3.0,3/7/2017,"The service was not great, but I never expect great service with chain restaurants. I came for the 1/2 price appetizer and beer, and enjoyed my time here. I would come here to grab a drink with some friends, but I would not bring my family for dinner at this certain location."
Mrs. C.,"San Jose, United States",0,11,,1.0,28/7/2017,"Been wanting to give it a try,  saddly disappointed!  Host had attitude,  should have know it would just go down hill.   Service is beyond slow and staff all have a don't care attitude.   Spinach chicken cavatappe was bland.   My sons chicken Mac n cheese was great as well as my daughter's chicken fiesta.   Manager gave our waitress attitude for having attitude.   Just bad all around,  won't be coming back which is a shame for a neighborhood restaurant."
Dakota L.,"Edenvale, San Jose, United States",239,1,,5.0,21/4/2017,"Decided to sit at the bar rail today. Best decision ever !! Hayden Jackie and Kayla were the best. Our food, drinks and appetizers came out super quick. They were super busy but still managed to serve us three rounds of drinks speedy quick. I totally enjoyed my dinner tonight. Definitely recommend this Applebee's ! Thanks for the great service !!"
Dd D.,"Sunnyvale, United States",4,24,3,3.0,20/3/2017,lol first week. Went opening night. Complete chaos. Waiters fighting over who's table it is all the while we sat there not being helped for 10 min. But I guess we give it time and I can redo my review. Miss spells on the menu and nobody knew or understood what we meant. But the manager came by and was helpful. We did happy hour and the happy hour food is ok. The sriracha shrimp was pretty good. Let's see how dinner service is.
Mary K.,"San Jose, United States",0,2,,5.0,6/6/2017,"Wow! We live right down the street and just managed to visit today for the first time. Krystin's greeting set off a great start! Awesome personality and great greeting! Avalon, our waitress, hooked us up with a great smile and information to get us exactly what we craved from the combo menu. Kayla, our bartender,  hooked us up with my drink of choice, not on the menu by the way, and it was superb! So delicious,  I ordered two more!! Jorge and Avalon topped off our evening with their wonderful service and making sure we always had everything we needed. We even had Avalon let the chefs know the steaks, shrimp,  ribs, broccoli, fries and desserts were fantastic! First time my husband and I ate fries without ketchup and had a dessert in two years. Drinks, etc. we're great! Thank you all for making our first visit amazing and Applebees on Cottle will be our go-to restaurant's first choice!!"
Brandi S.,"San Jose, United States",35,7,,2.0,21/6/2017,"Service leaves a lot to be desired.  Drinks came in an okay time, however refills were scarce.  Took a while for the food to come out which was surprising given they weren't that busy.  Asked for a to-go refill of Strawberry Lemonade.  They have two kinds, one from the bar that is really good and one that's more like a soda that is gross.  Got the right kind initially, to-go refill was the gross kind (big tasted difference, we've tried both before).  Kids love this place because they have steak and burgers.  I hope they work out the kinks otherwise I don't think they'll thrive despite the great location.  Parking sucks."
L C.,"San Jose, United States",0,12,3,5.0,9/6/2017,"Fantastic service! Came here for game night and the restaurant was packed. We were fortunate to have Gregorio wait on our table and he was so attentive and personable. Great atmosphere, amazing team of staff all around and will definitely come back. Thanks!"
Nicki M.,"San Jose, United States",0,10,,1.0,14/6/2017,"Our server Jessica took a long time to come but I think she was the only one working in the bar area. Our food took forty minutes to cook and all we ordered was a quesadilla and a salad. We ordered  half price happy hour appetizer and was charged full price. The quesadilla was pretty good but the steak and black bean salad was really small and only had two beans. At the end of the meal we found out that we were charged full price for the quesadilla because our server rang it in after six, we ordered at 5:40. The manager did fix the bill error. We probably will not be dining there again."
Rob D.,"San Jose, United States",0,1,,1.0,22/10/2017,"I wish I could choose zero stars. I have now been to this location 3 times. The first time I went, my family was all served their food and they said mine would be right out. I waited about 15 minutes before finally flagging down a staff member. She located my server and they were surprised my meal never came out. After looking into it, he discovered my meal was given to someone else. My family was all done eating so we told him to cancel my order and we left. The second time, the service was fine. The food was alright. We decided to give it another shot tonight. After being seated, we waited about 15 minutes and couldn't get anyone to acknowledge us. No drink order or even a simple hello. We decided to leave. When walking out, my wife let the host know that we couldn't get service so we choose to leave. After walking across the street, an Applebee's employee yelled out the door ""very class A**hole. We were confused and talked to two very nice ladies that had just walked out. They didn't appreciate the employee's remarks given they with with a young girl. One of them went into complain. They other explained their husbands were already in complaining about their very poor service at the time. I went in to speak to a manager and he said he would discipline the employee but I'm sure nothing will be done. Needless to say, I won't be going back."
Jorge V.,"San Jose, United States",0,2,,1.0,17/6/2017,The meat was not well prepared and was also very chewy. The western salad never came and the manager instead of apologizing was extremely rude. We cancelled the salad but still got charged for it. Never again are we going back!
Christian B.,"Pacifica, United States",2,3,,1.0,23/3/2017,"Stop! Turn around!! I brought my wife and kids here for dinner and it was a nightmare!!! This was the worst Applebee's that I've ever experienced. If you get Sam the waitress, leave now!! We walked in around 6pm and got seated right away in her section. She came and took our drink and appetizer order (2 sodas and a child's milk, spinach artichoke dip). When she came back, she only brought 1 soda with her and took our entree order. About 20 minutes later, we finally got our other 2 beverages. Another person brought us our appetizers. Sam never came back to check on us. An hour passes and I notice that the 4 other tables around us (all who came and were seated after us) and all gotten their appetizers and entrees before us. We asked another worker to check on our food for us (since Sam was no where to be found) and eventually the manager came out to speak with us. The manager, Louis, was apologetic and asked us what we ordered. We told the manager what we ordered, and he went back to the kitchen to check on our order. He came back with my sons food (a grilled cheese sandwich and some fries). Then he told us that Sam NEVER ENTERED OUR ORDER INTO THE COMPUTER SYSTEM!!! Are you kidding me?? I have been sitting here for over an hour, waiting for our food and hoping to leave the restaurant before my kids go crazy and the waitress never even entered our order??!!?? Louis was apologetic but at that point I couldn't wait in the restaurant any longer. Although Louis tried to right the wrong, there is no way that I would bring my family back here.  They tried to fit in as many tables as they could to maximize their seating capacity...it became extremely uncomfortable when another family sat behind us. My wife (who is quite petite) was pressed against the table when another averaged sized person sat in the chair behind her. Probably not the best move if you want people to enjoy their meals."
Ben T.,"San Jose, United States",10,13,4,1.0,27/4/2017,"When we got seated it took 20 mins to get the menu.  Another 10mins to check back with us.  Finally, got our drinks.  My wife and my drink was right.  My 14 yr old son and 10 yr daughter got margaritas instead of frozen lemonade.  When my daughter tried her drink she it tasted weird.  When I tried it it was margarita.  I took away my son's drink before he had a chance to sip it.  When we got our order it was all wrong.  Three waiters came to our table asking if we order the 3 plates they were holding.  Two more waiters came by to give us the wrong orders.  Then 3 more alcoholic drinks came to our table.  I told them I didnt order all thse drinks.  Wow this kept going i couldnt keep up with all this wrong order.  To make the story short we sat there for an hour and we havent got our food.  Like i said i like to keep this short but the best part, theres one person that walks to our table and asked if we got our food.  We said no and he goe to check our order (at least thats what i think hes doing).  He comes back and asked again. Oh boy!  No one knows what they're going here.  Maybe after 6 months ill come back and see."
Kate S.,"Elk Grove, United States",10,6,4,1.0,18/6/2017,The food was alright and the sever my husband and I had was good. Unfortunately when we were waiting for a table on Father's Day a older couple comes in maybe 2 minutes after us gets seated before us and the fact another couple that came in later was ALSO going to get seated before us. My husband had to tell the person who was seating people that we were here first before the older couple and the other couple who came much later. I don't even think the guy read the paper which people wrote down who was next. When we did get seated we got a table which is normally fine but all the tables were super close together which is a terrible design and uncomfortable. Again the food was alright and the sever that we had was good but that was it. If your going to make a waiting list PLEASE look at the list instead of taking people who are bugging or whatever then making people who have waited quiet a while and put their names down to wait to be seated like most people do.
