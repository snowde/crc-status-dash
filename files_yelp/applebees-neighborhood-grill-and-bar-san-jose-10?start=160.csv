Nancy P.,"Edenvale, San Jose, United States",0,1,,4.0,9/6/2017,"Came in last month and had a terrible experience. Came in tonight with my hubby and our waitress Ingrid, was incredible!! She was so sweet and on top of it, I recommend everyone asks for her on their visit"
Annie B.,"San Jose, United States",0,2,,5.0,6/6/2017,"Best server ever, Emily!!  Others should be learning from her and will get better tips!! Food was excellent."
Sal P.,"San Jose, United States",0,7,12,2.0,18/4/2017,"One time drop in, won't come back.  Nice atmosphere but didn't appreciate that they dim the light intentional or not.  Feel like we need to rush cause they closing which they not.  Order 2 for 20, portion is smaller than usual.  There no flavor to the  food, dry.  Waiter didn't give condiment till I almost finish my food.  Got different waiter for food drop off than the waiter we order with.  Their high tech card payment terminal that was on the table need to be fix.  Ask for email receipt, waiter drop off receipt even though I decline.  Overall experience is sub par, mostly will not come."
Jj L.,"Chino Hills, United States",0,4,2,1.0,29/3/2017,Worst service ever! Its been an hour and a half and we still haven't gotten our food! Don't even bother coming to this place.
Marvin R.,"San Jose, United States",0,7,8,1.0,27/4/2017,Slow service at the bar. Waiting 10 mins with two bartenders working and one of them finally looked at me and asked for a beer!!

Anthony R.,"San Jose, United States",87,4,6,1.0,21/3/2017,"What happened Applebees?!! I stopped going to Applebee's a few years ago because I was very disappointed in the food and service. I gave it another chance a few years later when the one at the Plant opened up and I was very very impressed with the food and service and so went back a few times and they held true. Today we tried this one because we were local and hungry. Wow, what a disappointment! First off all, the side door had an ADA sticker, but didn't have the proper equipment to meet the requirements, strike 1. The waiting room was really tiny making it really uncomfortable for anyone with a wheelchair or a baby stroller, not to mention that the wait was about 30mins to get seated. But alright, I get it. It's a Tuesday night for dinner. So we get seated finally. We make our order. Here's where the stars fall. A waiter dropped something and started yelling some vulgarity. A lot of customers got quiet and became a bit uneasy but eventually shook it off. And then the wait. Although we ordered our spinach and chips to get there before our meal, it came with our meal. The dip was cold, the cheese was hardened, and some of the chips were stuck together, not to mention the ones that were not clumped were bland, over salty and had a bitter after taste. Did I mention it was cold? I ordered some sirloin over grains something, medium cooked. The flavor was mediocre, but the sirloin was closer to well done and cold and the grains had a good flavor but was cold. My wife ordered another well done steak with shrimp. Once again, the flavor was there but was cold and very tough, not what I'd expect from Applebee's. At least it was cooked to the right color. The kids' chicken strips and fries were warm. Even though my son ate most of his corn dog, but it was pretty plain. The chocolate milk was pathetic and not fully mixed. I mean, come on! Chocolate milk?! Really? We were pretty much discouraged to order dessert and that actually speaks a lot. Our waiter was nice, but was too distracted to give us the attention I'd usually expect. Not to say I'd want it, but it just didn't feel the friendliness. I also mentioned the cold food to our waitress and she said she'd talk to the manager about our dissatisfaction, but I don't think it ever happened. Never coming back."
J N.,"San Jose, United States",0,3,,2.0,13/5/2017,Food is actually very good....but service the worst. Server came to table to take drink order and never came back. Flag another server to take order. The electronic server at the table is a waste of time and money..servers do not pay attention to them. Will not be going back
Dee K.,"San Jose, United States",0,2,,3.0,11/4/2017,Went there twice and assumed that our slow service was part of the recent start-up. Both times we had to flag down our waitress and the drinks were piling up at the bar but not being served quick enough. It's great to have Applebee's close to home so hopefully they'll improve sooner than later.
Tory B.,"San Jose, United States",0,7,,2.0,6/5/2017,"Decided to try this restaurant out since it is nearby. Parking wasn't easy but once we got into the restaurant we were seated immediately. I was surprised it wasn't more busy. Our waitress greeted us promptly and was quite nice.  There were definitely a few missteps in service. We were brought out a wrong drink and told them we didn't order that. No big deal. Then they tried to deliver an appetizer we didn't order as well as a salad! At least we actually did all get what we ordered, but half of the entrees were cold, including my son's chicken nuggets and fries! My daughter's kid steak was supposed to be medium but instead it was very well done and quite chewy. My older son had their burger and fries. It was underwhelming and he didn't care for it. I had a chicken dish and while I didn't love all of it, the chicken itself was quite flavorful, juicy and the right temperature.  We might give this another chance but I have to say I expected better. Too bad because I like the location as well as the atmosphere inside."
edwin m.,"Mountain View, United States",16,9,,1.0,23/4/2017,My wife and I tried the new Applebee's at Cottle. It turned out to be a terrible experience. The crew of the restaurant has no direction of what to do. They are confused and unorganized. Our server never approached us or introduced herself. We started ordering form the tablet since everyone was ignoring us. We got the food and drinks but the server still didn't approached us. She kept on passing our table to greet the people besides our table. The busboys were the ones who served us. Don't go to this restaurant. You'll be disappointed with the service.
Darrell Z.,"San Jose, United States",0,3,,1.0,17/4/2017,Went there for dinner I ordered steak and shrimp. To be honest was one of the worst meals i have ever had. The steak was chewy and stringy and just no taste. Wil never eat there again.
Jo S.,"Fremont, United States",0,3,,1.0,15/4/2017,"Early Friday night we were sat quickly, sat patiently for 10 min before a server came and said he wasn't our actual server but he would be happy to get us started since she is really busy.  This was fine but as a former server she should actually greet the table and explain herself.  Appetizers and drinks came in another few minutes already we were regretting the visit because so many servers walking around and nobody helping us except for one guy who's not even our server. Probably the only experienced server there.  My whisky burger finally comes out wrong so I ask my server who then grabs my fork and digs around my burger right in front of me at the table I was looking pretty shocked at this moment as was my gf.  When she's done she says oh yea it doesn't have the onions so comes back in another 10 min with a little bit of fried onion strings.  Whatever this burger looked nothing like the picture and was so dry I was thinking about asking for water to dip it into.   Our server was sweet but generally inexperienced and overwhelmed.   The manager prebussed our plates and under her breath told her servers to prebus but really we were the only ones who heard. Didn't acknowledge us at all.   Left 5 a shitty tip because they can do better.  The digging in my food in front of me was a new experience. No reason to return here."
K C.,"San Jose, United States",0,7,,1.0,11/4/2017,"Issues, issues. First if they can put a NBA game, guy said he would go check and never came back.  Second sever people who brought appetizers neglected to bring plates.  Third waiter who was nice took order correctly but kitchen ignored it.  Forth music a bit loud can't hear a thing. Fifth and last straw spoke to lady manager who seems less than sincere with her ""I'm sorry"" and seem like she didn't care or heard it all before and just wanted to take her leave to continue on her day."
Elizabeth N.,"San Jose, United States",0,4,,1.0,1/4/2017,"Worst service ever! We had to ask for a menu, placed our order after yet again asking. When we did finally get our food we had to ask for the drinks we had ordered, at this point we were about halfway through with the meal. Got up to get out check, and had to ask about 3 people for our change before we actually received it. Oh yeah and they didn't give me all that my meal came with! When I asked about it when I asked for our drinks she asked me if I wanted it, umm yes I am paying for the meal!!! TERRIBLE SERVICE"
Joe C.,"San Jose, United States",0,3,,1.0,1/4/2017,"I'm willing to give this location the benefit of the doubt since it's only been open a few weeks but so far I have not been too happy with my experience. It appears that the servers while friendly enough are lost when it comes to basic serving. I was seated and it took 20 min to receive drinks we had ordered when we first arrived. When I asked the server she stated they are still working on it, I ordered a lemonade not sure what they had to work on. Like I said I'll give them time to fix the problems. It just appears the servers are not sure where everything was or what to do and that is a reflection on management."
Shalini K.,"San Jose, United States",0,4,,2.0,24/3/2017,"1 star for ambiance, 1 star for the staff who tried. Been here 3 times since they opened for few different occasions. Food is pathetic - does not taste fresh no matter what you order. It is served below the average temperature, i think that's what makes it even worse. Soda glass is filled with ice and and only 1/5 of the drink is actually soda. Plus they charge for refills. It sucks that the waitresses seem to be trying but still not getting it right. After 1st visit which was terrible (it took them 1.5 hrs to bring the order, plus they brought appetizer after dinner was served), we had decided to give them benefit of doubt since they had just opened, so i walked in with a friend for drinks for a 2nd visit. They did not seem to get the same drink she had ordered a day ago right, and took forever to take the order and the payment even from the bar. We thought if not for the food, we could go there for the bar. But they failed to live up to that as well. If they can at least have fresh appetizers and drinks, they could get my good reviews. Everyone i know in the neighborhood have had similar, poor experiences on different occasions. Lets just hope they live up to the expectations, because as of right now they are scrambling to get it together."
Mike P.,"San Ramon, United States",1,33,1,5.0,21/3/2017,"Hey it's brand new! Cool looking place, food is edible, staff are trying hard and they have nice TVs. Good choice of beers and liquor. Support your local bar! You don't have a lot of choice so let's patronage and make it better."
Davida R.,"San Jose, United States",0,6,,1.0,16/3/2017,If I could give zero stars I would. I understand they've only been open a couple of days but this was the absolutely worst experience. We arrive before 5:00 so not a rush hour. After we were seated it took at least 15 minutes for them to figure out who our server would be. Server wasn't familiar with the menu but OK just opened. Took our order. 15 minutes later we got our beverages. Our house salad did not come for another 20 minutes or so. Finally our meal comes. I take a bite of the mashed sweet potatoes and they are ice cold. I mean as just out of the refrigerator cold. On top is a ball of butter that hasn't melted. Because it just came out of the refrigerator. Everything else was luke warm. Including my husbands food. Called a server over and asked for the manager. Finally she comes over. NEVER in all of my 64 years have I walked out of a restaurant. But that's how bad this place is. And the topper is as I was walking out of the women's room in walks a male worker who says don't worry just checking the bathroom. Hello? Aren't you supposed to announce yourself. Skip going to the Applebee's on Cottle. Just horrible
Nikki D.,"San Jose, United States",0,4,,1.0,15/5/2017,"Horrible costumer service! First things first my daughter needed a refill and I ask the women walking that so happened to be the manager (Angela)  if she could please get her a refill she rolled her eyes and said what is this. Second My burger was made incorrectly and didn't come with everything that was listed. I told my waiter and he informed me he'd get a side of the bacon etc that was missing which was okay after 30 minutes of waiting and still no bacon or the hash browns. I didn't even want the burger anymore, who would want a cold burger and hot bacon and hash browns gross!! I simply told the manager (Angela)I'd like to return it she asked ""Why"" Informed her what was going on her response was I was wrong and that it doesn't come with bacon when it clearly states on the menu it does, she then rolled her eyes and says okay very rudely take the plate and doesn't ask can I get you anything else or apologize. As a manger you have to be a people person she clearly doesn't want to be bothered and doesn't care about customer satisfaction. This Applebee's barely opened and horrible management team! Will not be coming back after this Experience."
