Lorraine J.,"San Jose, United States",0,18,,1.0,5/7/2017,"Went to Applebee's tonight on Cottle Road, around 5:30 p.m.for dinner.  I was surprised to see it was not as crowded as it once was and I was very disappointed, so much so that we walked out. The music blasting out of their speakers was absolutely horrible and very loud. The loud beat with some screeching singer, over and over and over and over.  I asked to speak to the manager who never came, but they delivered my message to her. Waited and waited for the manager, Angela, to take care of it (so they said) .  All we had ordered so far, was our drinks which came but which we didn't touch.  I told them I was going to wait to order until they did something about the music.  Nothing ever happened, so we left our drinks and walked out.  One of the workers thanked me for saying something about the music (they didn't like it either) but where Angela went as she was eating some ice cream, who knows? Obviously, the workers there are either tone deaf, block it out, or are zombies. Left and went to Betto's in Morgan Hill, which is ALWAYS fabulous!"
Zalinka H.,"San Jose, United States",0,9,,2.0,29/5/2017,"I really wanted this Applebees to work out because it's food and alcohol in a nice setting and it is open until midnight but every time I go here something is wrong. The first time I went there the drinks were great and the food took a while to come out and it was okay except I had ordered some ribs but they were so overcooked that I had a hard time taking the meat off of the bone, my friend said something and I got new ribs and they were awesome so I figured it was just a mistake. Next time I went there it was just my boyfriend and I and we ordered food and two drinks, both margaritas. The food come out pretty quickly but our drinks took more than 45 minutes and then my margarita tasted like just water, I would have said something but they took it off of the bill so I just shared my boyfriends drink. The next time I went there it was with a group of friends, we all mostly got appetizers, the drinks (nonalcoholic) took about ten minutes and the food took more than 50 minutes.. for some quesadillas! It makes me sad because you can see that the waiters are really sorry and they kept coming back to us to check up on us and trying to reassure us that the food was coming. I just hope that it can get a grip on how to manage traffic and not keep customers waiting."
Mathew C.,"San Jose, United States",0,5,,1.0,17/3/2017,"First of all, the appetizers were the most expensive appetizers I have ever seen. They were also not very good and were small for their incredibly huge prices. The meals I ordered were incredibly dry and flavorless. The sirloin and whole grains tasted like actual dirt. The bone in wings were way over cooked. The Nashville hot chicken sandwich is just a mess. It's extremely dry and hardly sauced. The sauce that is there is very bland. They were also way overstaffed. They had 15 employees standing in the back at one time, and those weren't all of them. The rest were walking around or hanging out at the front. There must have been at least 30 people working there, however service was still slow. They weren't on top of drinks somehow (30+ people were doing nothing) and it took 5 whole minutes for them to bring ketchup and ranch. No one ever gave us our check even 10 minutes after we were done eating. We finally decided to use the table side tablet to pay as our waitress stood in the back doing nothing. Overall it's extremely expensive and not good at all."
