N K.,"Los Angeles, United States",107,18,1,1.0,9/11/2017,This was my 2nd time here. Host looked bored. Sat at the bar. There were empty plates everywhere and hardly anyone there. Bartender came over about 5 minutes into us being there. Our bartender Amber P. was very slow and a bit rude. She served us our drinks and opened the beer can and it sprayed all over us. She giggled and didn't offer to clean it up Just dropped off a napkin and went on her way. Food was ok. Chicken wonton tacos looked thrown together. I wouldn't come back here
Victor K.,"San Jose, United States",0,23,6,2.0,27/7/2017,"Decided to visit Applebee's for dinner to try out the new location on Cottle.  We hadn't been to one in several years due to several issues with COLD food, an obvious sigh of pre-prepared/frozen food. I ordered an 8 -ounce sirloin (it looked like tri-tip) and two sides (green beans and Mac-n-cheese).  My wife tried the Mac before I did and said it was cold.  I put my finger in the middle of it and it was probably 40-50 degrees.  The outer portion was warm, a sign of microwaving. I complained on the little tablet they have on the table and my server came over and apologized and offered me a new one.  I refused and had her bring me fries, they were fine.  Not her fault at all. My issue with Applebees is that if they are going to microwave their food from frozen then they need to check the internal temp.  It's improper food prep and can cause illness.  Needs to reach 160 degrees.   See you in another 7 years if you are still in business."
Jo D.,"San Jose, United States",0,4,1,5.0,11/9/2017,"i went yesterday with my girlfriend, her cousin & her girlfriend for some beers and a quick bite. my waitress was ingrid, she was very friendly, funny, and attentive. always made sure to check on our table but not be too overbearing.  i came into this restaurant with an open mind considering all of the negative reviews but every employee i came in contact with were super friendly and helpful. food wait time was not bad either, the average 20-25 minutes. food was also really good, and hot. didn't taste like it had been sitting out. lol but overall i would definitely reccomend to give this location a try and to ignore all of these negative reviews.  big shout out to the employees (including ingrid) who sang happy birthday to me. you were all very enthusiastic. lol"
Damon R.,"San Jose, United States",98,3,,1.0,29/4/2017,"Well, where do I begin. This is the 3rd time visiting the restaurant, trying to give them a chance to work out their service, but I don't think there will be a fourth. Staff is confused, slow and inefficient.  I took my family to the restaurant this evening for dinner. After sitting at a high top table in the bar area, our server took the drink orders. 20 min later, only the water and strawberry lemonade was delivered out of 5 drinks. Two cocktails came back poorly made, while a mystery third cocktail was delivered completely wrong. After asking the server a few times to to get the correct cocktail, we walked to the overwhelmed bar directly to get the drinks remediated. The bartender brings the drinks over, and still tells us that he made them incorrectly. We ordered our entrees (5), however they were all brought out at different times. The first entree, was brought out before even the drinks  were completely. The food runner realized, and returned the food to the kitchen. Entree number 2 (bbq burger) was brought out, however without the sweet potato fries that it was ordered with. Entree 3, salmon, was brought without the sauce. Entree 4, steak, was overcooked and served with cold green beens. Entree 5, well, never appeared with the rest of the orders. After asking the server to bring the sweet potato fries, sauce for the salmon, and the whereabouts of the entree 5, he apologized and came back 5 min later with the sauce...... but it was ice cold.  I had to ask him again to heat the sauce. After the 4 of us finished, they finally bring entree 5. The manager comes by and offers 10% off the bill.....really? After telling her how poor the experience had been, her response was to tell the server more promptly. Really? I felt a bit insulted with the offer. If you decide to try this applebees, try a draft beer and chips, hard to screw that up."
Henry M.,"Salinas, United States",19,25,3,1.0,2/11/2017,"Me, my wife and my 2 yr son decided to eat here on Sunday. Then my Dad, 2 Sisters, Borther In Law and 4 Kids decide to join as well. We placed our Drinks and Food with the Server. 40 min go by and Food starts arriving. Everyone got there food. Then I notice he forgot my son's food, so I let him know. He didn't put in his order in. So we waited. 20 min later, nothing. So I called the manager and explained what happen and wanted our check cause we are leaving. As we were walking out the door, he comes up and says he was sorry and the our server was super busy. I told him he had to tell my son that and now I have to take my son to eat somewhere else."
Erica H.,"San Jose, United States",4,9,6,1.0,26/5/2017,"Came in late evening for dinner, and it clearly didn't go as anticipated! It was pretty busy but saw plenty waiters so thought ok, we'll be good!  Well no, the food really lagged on coming out, the grilled chicken looked like cardboard and tasted drier than that!! My daughters grilled chicken was burnt with the matching burnt as hell grill marks. My other daughters chicken tenders were fried to a crisp, like really they looked like chicharrones!! My chicken wrap fell apart upon picking it up. Oh and my salad arrived AFTER my main plate. Ordered a cocktail thinking that would make up for it all but NO! Was horrible and tasted like rubbing alcohol.  Needless to say, everything had juuuust enough wrong to make this meal less than mediocre. Sorry Applebee's, not the least bit impressed. Won't be coming back"
Joshua R.,"San Jose, United States",203,9,3,5.0,22/10/2017,"Kyle was our fantastic server. The drinks came out a bit late for dollar margaritas, however to compensate for the waiting time they took off a portion of our meal. Despite the wait, Great service overall."
Amber G.,"San Jose, United States",27,13,5,3.0,20/5/2017,"Went to this location for the first time. I ordered off the Lighter side menu, it was good but definitely on the Lighter Side menu for a reason....actual portion size compared to the menu picture was a joke. The steak came in 4 tiny bite-size pieces. The waitress first asked how I wanted the steak done and I said medium, steak came with no pink color and charred on the outside. The waitress also asked how my husband wanted his burger done. He wanted medium, and the burger came showing no sign of pink in the middle :( Why even ask if they don't even get it right?! His fries portion was ridiculous too. Restaurants normally load you up with fries, but here he was able to eat them all and wanted more because he didn't get enough to begin with :( Anyway, Appetizers are awesome here. Love the pretzels and beer cheese dip. Staff is super friendly. Just wish we got the food ordered correctly and bigger quantity. The plates looked half bare before we even touched it."
Emily L.,"San Jose, United States",20,382,1183,1.0,17/4/2017,"You be the judge of this ""harsh"" review.  I understand that it is grand opening day but the service was terrible  3/14/17 Came in around 10:30 after a movies at oak ridge mall. My party wanted to go to Buffalo Wild Wings for wing Tuesday but I convinced them to come to apple bees for the grand opening  We get here and there's only 2 other parties at the bar. Note, it was pretty warm in the building.  We got seated promptly and was taken drink order. Started off well I would say! 15 mins in and beers start to show up... the wrong beers....  the waiter claims we ordered those beers but we did not. Moving on, we got our beers switched out and everything was good. Next we put in 4 appetizers  and the girls ordered dessert. Thank god we just got appetizers and not a meal. I knew the food was going to take a while, but 40 minutes?!? Considering there was only 3 parties in the entire restaurant.  One of the desserts came out before any of the foods.  Oh and I forgot to mention, by this time it was the 3rd time I asked for a round of iced waters  Everyone was done with their drinks and patiently waiting to get more and our food !!!  I flag down another waiter and politely ask for Ice water again. Nothing...  one last time and the ice water finally comes out!!!  Moving on... the food finally comes out, but with no sauces lol. (Ranch BBQ. You know the typical drill when you order things like mozzarella sticks and celery. ) We all try to just take a breathe and enjoy what we have.  Because it's already been 1 hour 1/2, we wanted to cancel the remaining dessert but apparently it was being made. Ok.... We get done around 1210 and everyone starts to pay. I notice there were things on the bill we didn't even order. Long story short, it took another 20 minutes to get everything sorted out and we finally left at 12:35....  what a night for just a drink and apps.  Will not becoming back for a few months until they get their s**t together.  Will stick to the plant for our weekly applebees trip.  Okay okay. Was I being to harsh? I know it's their first day , but they failed to check up on us. They kept bringing the wrong food to us. Missing things and most importantly, the water!!!!!!  Sorry for the long review, but this rant just had to happen.  4/16/17 Gave this place another try after a terrible experience. Terrible decision. Luckily I was not terribly hungry or angry in anyway. Brought my best friend and arrived around 715 to watch the sharks game. A girl opened the door for us and we were greeted right away. We walked to the bar and sat down. Looked at the menu and ordered both our drinks and food. Also we asked for ice waters. My friends happen to come and join our table so we decided to move to a bigger table. 20 mins passed and no water came out nor did anyone pass by our table to ask if my friends wanted to order anything. I asked our server about 3 times if we can get the sharks game on on the tv by us. 15 minutes the manager in assuming comes out with the remote. I flag her down and asked politely if we could get the sharks game on. Her response, ""what do you want"". She puts the game on and walks away. I flag Jonathan down , not our server but he seemed quick with everything. I asked politely where our stuff was again. He went to the bartender to get our drinks that have been sitting there..... unbelievable. Our food came out 20 minutes later and it wasn't even the right order. Arrrrggggg. I told them we substituted our rice for fries. Also my friend ordered an extra side of rice. It took them another 20 minutes for them to bring it out. 2nd round of drinks I didn't even bother calling our server over. I asked Jonathan directly and he got our drinks in a quickness. If it weren't for Jonathan last night, I would have walked out after my meal. We opted out on dessert because we didn't want to wait ! The portions are so small compared to ""the plant "" location. I left a good tip because Jonathan did his best to make up for the terrible service.  The service still is lacking. I noticed everyone in the restaurant was looking around because they weren't being attended.  The servers need to learn to check up on their tables and not have to wait for us to flag them down and ask for ketchup or a refill on water. Be attentive to the drinks and food that's coming out and not leave it there for it to get cold!  Thank you Jonathan for busting your tail off last night. Your efforts don't go unnoticed! Im forsure asking for you if we ever come back!   Giving this place another 1-2 months before coming back. Hopefully they get their s**t together"
Beth E.,"San Jose, United States",8,30,6,5.0,29/4/2017,"We went to Applebees early this week. The waitress didn't come by for 20 minutes. When she finally stopped by to take our drink order, she apologize, saying she was really busy. There was hardly any customers there. Our food came before our drinks. My daughter said her Strawberry Margarita was too strong, so re-made it. She still didn't like it. We asked for it to be taken off our bill. It took 20 minutes for a manager to adjust our bill. We left a 10% tip, which we felt was generous.  A couple of days later, I sent an email in the evening. The very next morning (which was today), the manager, Luis, called to apologize and invited us back to give them one more try on the house. We agreed on tonight. What a different experience. Our waitress, Jasmine, was our waitress until Luis came back from break, and then, he took over. Everything was wonderful and Luis even packed up my leftovers. We gave Jazmine a $20 tip, and we will definitely return. How refreshing it was to find a manager who is passionate of providing good service and food to his customers. We are soon glad we gave this Applebees another chance!!!"
Catherine C.,"San Jose, United States",55,21,,1.0,3/5/2017,"This is my second visit to this location and I've only ordered for pick up. NEVER FAILS that something is missing in my order. I had to drive all the way back to get the sauce (which obviously makes the dish) I ordered the salmon with the glaze sauce. The manager was apologetic and even have me a voucher for a free dinner. BUT... tonight it happened again. Sauce?! I'm starting to believe that these are not honest mistakes but the staff needs better training. There was another man in there tonight as I was picking up my order who had complaints about his milkshake being melted and watery. Again, the manager gave him another magical voucher for a free dinner. Why not correct the issue and stop putting a bandage over it.  I'm so done with this location. Unfortunately, we don't have much of a selection working the night shift. I will try and avoid ordering here if I can. So FYI, ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE LEAVING SO YOU SAVE A TRIP DRIVING BACK."
Daniela M.,"Modesto, United States",4,34,12,3.0,7/10/2017,Food was slow. But good. Drinks were good. Our waiter was super nice so hence the 3 stars mostly for his service. Thank you Gregorio! Stop by for a dollarita (or 5) before the promo ends.
Lani C.,"San Jose, United States",2,4,2,1.0,24/3/2017,"Seemed promising at first based on the level of business tonight. Considering how busy it looked we were seated pretty promptly. Don't think they've worked out all the kinks just yet because we had three different people come and ask us for our order. They need to enforce a grooming policy especially with the servers that handle the food. One of the waitresses/servers seemed like she was high on something and her hands looked filthy, was hoping she was not going to be the person who brings us our food. Beverage order put in first but appetizers came out before drinks (maybe the bar was busy?). Ordered from the 2 for 25 menu.  Drinks: did I just order a virgin Long Island??? Should have just gotten water on the rocks and it would have had the same effect. Appetizer: spinach artichoke dip was lacking from what I've had in the past at other locations, yet was probably the highlight of the night. Don't they just heat this stuff up? Entrees: ordered firecracker shrimp cavatappi and the spinach artichoke chicken cavatappi. Where do I even begin...no flavor at all on either of the pastas! Cue in the burnt chicken, perhaps the most dominant flavor of my dish because I could not get past the taste of overbearing taste of charred. Needless to say we could not get in but a few bites.  Service: first we had three people trying to take our order. Then we had no one checking on us beyond the appetizer. Paid out tab with plates still full and left to fill our bellies up elsewhere.  To summarize, just disappointing all around."
Dave L.,"San Jose, United States",20,16,7,3.0,31/3/2017,Phone number I called and got through with is (408) 809-4980.  The number listed online is incorrect and goes straight to a Voice Mail.  Going tonight with a party of 9. So hoping it's a good time.
Luis G.,"San Jose, United States",8,6,,2.0,15/10/2017,The service not good here slow almost an hour for 3 drinks and food was cold. Second time here same shitty service
Frances N.,"San Jose, United States",22,43,7,1.0,2/4/2017,"The workers here are really nice, but the overall service was just terrible. It took 15 minutes for us to be greeted and get our drinks. Took her another 10 minutes to get our drinks when we only got water. We put our order in with her, around 15 mins later she tells us that she barely put the order in.. huh?? I'm a server too so I understand y'all get busy what c'mon dude, really?  We ordered the salmon with specific instructions, and the server forgot to ring it in... a bigger huh??????  30 mins for an appetizer to come out... HUH????  50 mins for tasteless food(chicken mac n cheese and shrimp cavatappi I believe) was ..... AND the salmon came out raw.  Then I asked for a a manager. 4 times. Took her 15 mins to come out. At this point we really just wanted to leave cause we were just chilling in there for a good 2-3 hours now. Ridiculous, we'd probably only come back because the manager gave us gift cards, but definitely not to this location!"
Ann S.,"Redondo Beach, Los Angeles, United States",1,36,1,2.0,28/3/2017,I had such high hope because it's a new restaurant. I assumed or figured wrongly that they would be at the top of their game. Great location lots of foot traffic they could have made this a winner. Service was very very slow in fact we had to call the waitress back to take our order. My potatoes were cold my chicken was tough and my onions were raw I won't be going back
Cynthia P.,"San Jose, United States",0,24,3,4.0,9/10/2017,Usually I am not a fan of Applebees but I came to join my family for lunch. I arrived late and was very impressed by the manager coming to our table and taking my drink and food order. I am vegetarian and the manager really went above and beyond to make a special sandwich lunch salad combo with no meat and sub veggies. Totally didn't have to even offer that and I really appreciated it.
Katie T.,"San Jose, United States",0,4,5,1.0,8/10/2017,"The worst service EVER!!!  First they seat someone else who came in after us first.  Then after we were finally seated and ready to order, our waiter/waitress never came by.  I kept trying to get someone's attention but they just kept walking by and didn't even wanted to make eye contact.  What made it worse was that there were 5or 6 other waiters/waitresses standing against the wall doing nothing but talk to each other.    By that time my son was super hungry. We end up ordering the appetizer through the order tablet on the table and sent it through to the kitchen.  Several minutes after that, I was able to flag a girl down and asked for our waiter/waitress.  She said she would go check but never came back.  After about another 2-3 minutes one of the waitress finally came to take our order.   Not sure if I ever want to return here!!!"
Amanda M.,"Cupertino, United States",90,6,3,2.0,22/3/2017,"Second time at this location. We got there around 750pm was seated within 10mins. We ordered our drinks and the black bean soup and a small salad for appetizers.. Our waiter never came back to check on us and I asked 3 times for our appetizer. 840pm we finally got one and then around 850pm  our actual meal came out and it was absolutely sad to look at. Like they just threw it on the plate, looked nothing like the picture and it was cold. The 4th time I asked again for my salad, again like they just threw it on the plate.  Thanks."
