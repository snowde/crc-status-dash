Tan T.,"San Jose, United States",184,2,,1.0,14/3/2017,"I understand its opening night but we came at 6:30pm got seated at 7:10pm and an hour and half for onion rings and a beer is a bit ridiculous. My family and I saw Patrons that came in after served and left before us. The manager came by and asked how we are doing we stated we've been waiting for an hour for our food. She chuckled and said let me check on it. She returned half and hour later and asked the same question, we told her we have been waiting for her. She walks a little   faster and 10 minutes later food come out and there were missing items from our food and it was cold... Ps we hit 9 pm and our food hasn't all come yet and its happy hour now."
Jennifer D.,"San Jose, United States",7,5,,5.0,29/7/2017,"Such an awesome experience!!  This is the best Applebee's that I have been to in such a long time!! I truly mean it  Today, my husband and I sat at the bar. Our bartenders were Ashley and Amber. They were the Bomb​!!! They were fun and energetic. The drinks were on point and the food amazing. Please stop by to see these ladies!!"
Rick S.,"San Jose, United States",371,74,224,4.0,11/4/2017,"Can't believe I'm yelpin' about an Applebee's... but in this (Evergreen area) restaurant-STARVED region, even a casual sit down chain is a very welcome relief! And THIS was actually (my 1st visit) an excellent lunchtime experience!! I had brisket tacos, which were amazing, peach tea... an easy electronic ordering experience, and a fun, friendly server. He was a crack up. This center was initially touted as a ""new Santana Row"" on Cottle.  .not. But for casual fare and shopping-- it's above satisfactory. The Applebee's nice sized dining room, the bar (with TWELVE flat screen TVs) large picture windows throughout, comfortable seating, clean bathrooms... and a really good, wide-variety menu-- is going to be a really nice, regular stop. Thanks for adding SOMETHING good to the 'hood."
Ramon J.,"San Jose, United States",1,1,1,1.0,17/3/2017,From all the Applebees I've been too this one has been the worse. Bad experience overall. From the wait time to the food. I waited for a drink for 34 minutes. So I asked the waiter to cancel my drink and instead to have a glass of water. I never got my water.
Kevin B.,"San Jose, United States",218,1,,4.0,14/3/2017,"Today marks the Grand Opening of this Cottle/VIO location for Applebees which is located right at the corner across from Starbucks. Ive read they recently had a soft opening but doing research that they had finally opened to the public on 3/14/17 I decided to give it a try with my sister since it was close to home.  SERVICE: Being that it was the grand opening, service was great from opening the door for us, being greeted by the host and seated right away, everyone was on their A-game. Our host was kind enough to makes us feel welcomed about what to expect and who would be our server. Our server is named Shontelle, she did a great job overall not only taking our orders, but also having time to small talk as she eases the same time doing her job. There were a lot of servers going around, as I'm sure a lot of trainees, about 3 different servers checked up on us including the manager herself to give time to know about our reasons to visiting and assuring everything is going smoothly. FOOD: Me and my sister ordered the 2 for $25 Deal which included an appetizer and two entrees. -Crunchy Onion Rings (Appetizer) -Firecracker Shrimp Cavitti which was slightly smothered in Sriracha base. (Entree) -Spinach and Artichoke Chicken Cavitti pasta We were then reminded by the manager of a list of apps that were half off at the time being there. So we included  -Chicken Wonton Tacos *qty 4*  Everything tasted great and our food came out quick. For it being this great from the service and food, I can only hope they can be consistent as time goes on, so I'm glad to enjoy the grand opening to have a full service experience to be on top.  I will come back again when the craving for this comes along."
Eric C.,"Palo Alto, United States",114,9,,1.0,24/3/2017,Breaking news! Applebee's is gross. The service is great but the food and drinks are drop-dead awful. Chicken Quesadilla: The chicken was inedible. Tastes like it came off of a Tyson chicken factory floor. Spinach Artichoke dip: Literally came out cold. Caesar Salad: completely wilted lettuce; had to return it. Drinks: Applebee's removed the alcohol and replaced it with sugar. My sweet tooth rotted and I'm still sober. Applebee's is a race to the bottom. It's too bad such a disgusting attempt at a real food restaurant had to royally pollute our growing little neighborhood. I can't believe this chain has the audacity to serve such awful food and drinks.
Steve P.,"San Jose, United States",1,14,2,3.0,22/3/2017,Went one week after it opened on 3/21/17.   It still has growing pains.  I sat at the bar and it took about a 10 min wait before I was given a menu.   Then about 10 min more to order.  I was about to give up and leave. I ordered the Agave Blue margarita.   It was tasty.  I also ordered wanton tacos.  They were good.   It took about 35 min for the tacos  to be delivered.  I finished two margaritas before the tacos came.   The bartenders were working hard and it was obvious the were still learning the bar.   They were nice but it was hectic.   I gave three stars for the wait times.   I will return and hopefully be able to move it up to a four.
Bob P.,"San Jose, United States",17,2,,4.0,28/3/2017,This restaurant just opened recently. And the staff is still in training. But they did a great job and both my wife and my order were great. We did take take out. They got both orders correct and everything was cooked perfectly. Keshia to our order and was very helpful. We would go back there again in a heartbeat. Updating us to review. The last two takeout orders we had they forgot items and we had to go back. Or burgers came with no produce no sauce just meat and bun. We ended up taking my wife's burger back. The manager did attempt to make things right. He replaced our entire order and gave us $30 and get certificates. I guess the new kitchen staff Needs more practice.
Rhoza K.,"Campbell, United States",163,2,20,1.0,30/4/2017,"Horrible, went to Applebee's and my daughter had to wait an extra 1/2hr of so after we were serve for a ..... hamburger. NEVER Again, she kept asking to wait. Then the waiter apologizing for the cooks that probably forgot the order:LAME!!!"
Cecilia M.,"San Jose, United States",123,10,4,1.0,19/3/2017,"Very scattered, the hostesses were confused as to what tables were cleared. Not many people here but waited almost 20min while the hostesses were just chit-chatting.  Once we did sit down, waitress never came over as if she wasn't aware people were being seated in her area.  Just not happy with our over service. They need alot more practice. Especially for those hostesses at the front, it may help to teach em to smile and greet people as they walk in.  Not a pleasant visit. Maybe will come back again in a few months, when they are more established!!!!"
Terry M.,"Campbell, United States",0,55,1,1.0,20/4/2017,"Quite possibly the most disgusting food and most horrible experience you can ever imagine. They serve low-grade dog food which most dogs would not even eat. I worked there for a short time, don't eat the food! Don't drink the drinks! If you like sucking on fingers of a homeless person you will like their food. They hire people right off the street with no experience in  the food service industry whatsoever comma give them such minimal training they wouldn't know hamburger from a hot dog.Pathetic, pathetic, pathetic,!! This place is disgusting. I am not sure what else I can say to keep you from going there. If you do go to Applebee's, it is because you are cheap and you have no taste buds. If you are drawn in by a 2 for $20 deal, just eat cat food because you're a disgusting human being as it is!"
Todd J.,"San Jose, United States",36,6,,2.0,14/4/2017,"Was there at 8pm got sat right away. But as we were trying to make the maze of a path the host took us on. Waiters were so far away from the table they were speaking to that they block the isle. Said excused me but didn't even acknowledge me. Went to try and go around him. That's when he scooted in turned and gave me a horrible look. Well get out of the freaking isle. Sat at our table for 10minutes no waiter came to the table. We order drinks on the table tablet, still no waiter.  We wait 10 more minutes and I counted 7 waiters/staff walk right passed us. Looking back at the waiter station, there were 9 there with a half empty restaurant. Plus some e in a red shirt standing there with them. Really there are 9 of you? How can you not see tables? Then we hit the call server on the tablet. Waited again for 5 minutes. A runner stopped said do you need help and we said yes and that we hit the call button because no one ever came. She said O, that's ok I can shut it off and she did and walked away. Really? You obviously heard something else than we need to get someone to help us. We hit call server again. We still had no drinks that we had ordered ourselves. So we just left. Come on get it together. Waited tables for 10years and managed them. This isn't that hard to catch on too."
Raj M.,"Chicago, United States",9,4,,1.0,10/4/2017,HORRIFIC experience. We arrived at 9 Pm on weekday . Ordered food and nothing came until 10pm. We asked for Manager but manager was to busy to come in half empty restaurant.  At the end we left without eating.
Nicola M.,"San Jose, United States",0,5,,5.0,6/12/2017,"Honestly, I've been to this location for a to-go order twice, and each the woman managing the team greets me with great enthusiasm, I walk away laughing and happy. All I came for was fries, but I left in good spirits."
Richard S.,"San Jose, United States",0,13,,2.0,18/11/2017,"Even for an Applebees, which is not known for being a big deal, this location has real problems. The burgers are so-so at best. Our server seemed overbooked, but others moved without purpose. The appetizer barely gave them a second star."
Alicia C.,"San Jose, United States",1,2,,1.0,8/9/2017,"This location was awful. Service sucked, online prices different then what they offer and didn't want to accommodate. I would not recommend this location on cottle."
Eileen A.,"Campbell, United States",0,4,2,1.0,9/11/2017,"Great service . Poor food quality. burger has no flavor , I was telling my husband that a McDonald's cheeseburger tastes better !!!!!!! We left dissatisfied ."
JoAnna M.,"San Jose, United States",51,4,,1.0,14/7/2017,This is probably the worst service  ever The manager greeted us as we walked in said we can go sit in the bar area and she would send someone to clean a table for us. After waiting for 10 minutes we had to get someone are selves after nearly sitting there for 30 minutes our server came out and said they were out of pork chops and needed to order something else.  Need less to say we ended up walking out and to top it off the place was not even busy
Richard H.,"San Jose, United States",8,1,,1.0,29/7/2017,"Stay away from this location.   After being seated, it took 10 minutes for our waiter to come to our table.  Another 10 minutes for the drinks (iced tea) to arrive and 30 minutes for half the lunch (chicken salad) order to arrive.  It took another 15 minutes to get the rest of the lunch order (chicken salad) and that was after having to get the managers attention.  The waiter new checked on us after the initial drink order and the manager never came back to the table to see if everything was right.  If it were not for being able to pay using the tablets I might still be there waiting for the check.  I did see this waiting for the check a a couple other tables that had the same waiter.  I forgot to mention, this was just after 11 am and they were not busy.  Never shall I go there again or any Applebee's in the San Jose area."
Vlad L.,"Edenvale, San Jose, United States",0,1,,1.0,20/6/2017,"Fire everybody. Start over.  I honestly don't expect much of these places, but I was still excited when they opened because there's not much in the way of sit-down restaurants in this area. First went here about a month after they opened. Food was mediocre, service was terrible, long wait for a table and the restaurant wasn't even half-full, and we couldn't even get water refills. Checked Yelp and noticed the horrible reviews, but I let it go because they were new.  Fast forward to this past Sunday. Decided to give them another shot, but this time I ordered online to avoid the crap service inside. Food-to-go is hard to f up. Right? Wrong! When I went there to pick up, I was informed that none of the entrees I ordered were available. And then they tried to give me somebody else's order! I asked them to cancel my order and the manager actually got snippy with me.   Avoid this place at all costs. If you're starving, just go ahead and starve to death, because that would be less painful than dealing with the room-temperature-IQed-cretins at this restaurant."
