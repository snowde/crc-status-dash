Richelle P.,"San Jose, United States",0,1,4,1.0,12/9/2017,They don't have effin Guacamole ...... what type of restaurant has quesadillas but offers NO guac?  plus their bartenders suck... super slow
Jennifer T.,"San Jose, United States",107,22,,1.0,31/7/2017,"Great food as always, but very bad service! Our waiter took our orders and did not even acknowledge us after. He brought us our food after about a 30 minute wait for 3 orders, but was talking to a coworker when dropping it off on table  and a bunch of fries spilled off the plates.  Ordered water and was empty before meal came and was never offered refill. He didn't bring us our bill so we paid electronically with machine at table and left. Management, please work on some training for these waiters. I love Applebees, but probably won't come to this location again unless someone I know invites me."
Karolina S.,"Edenvale, San Jose, United States",163,2,1,5.0,26/8/2017,"Gregorio was awesome. He was super friendly, very attentive, was on his game. People like him is what makes applebees a 5 star."
Linh V.,"San Jose, United States",128,199,330,4.0,23/5/2017,"I don't know why this location has such low ratings. I've been here twice and my experience was fine. Service was great and tentative. Manager walks around and greets the guests as well. Parking was decent. Payment is easy & quick because you can pay on the machine. Food was fine. Only complaint is I ordered a side of broccoli for $2 and got 4 pieces of broccoli.. I asked the waitress if this is correct and she said yes.. such a rip off! I was pretty upset by that, but I didn't let it bring down my night."
Jayr Y.,"Newark, United States",121,28,25,1.0,2/6/2017,Very slow service. You will die from hunger and thirst before receiving your order. Go across the street for sushi or Panda Express instead. We waited 1 plus hour to get our first drink. I think that's enough details for you.
Stephanie E.,"San Jose, United States",37,4,2,5.0,12/6/2017,"So I have been to many Applebee's restaurants and have always been let down, with regard to the food and service. Since the warriors are in game five of the NBA playoffs my husband and I decided to try the new Applebee's. The food was actually better then any other Applebee's we've been too. It was ok, nothing was exceptionally good. On the other hand I am giving 5 stars simple because we had the best service at the hands of our waiter, Gregorio. He was very sweet and made sure we had everything we needed. He recommended the chocolate lava cake for desert and it was D-lish.  Gregorio insisted that we stay as long as we wanted even though we were finished eating, so we could watch the warriors play. My husband and I gave a pretty large tip and we will insist that only Gregorio be our server for future visits to Applebee's."
Ruzan B.,"San Jose, United States",61,75,34,1.0,13/6/2017,"We really wanted to give our new neighborhood restaurant a chance after a rocky start (read the horror on Nextdoor). So we got here around 10pm to get some drinks and late dinner. We ordered 2 apps, 2 entrees and a drink. I got my drink within 5 minutes of ordering but then no food for the next 30 minutes. Not even the apps. We were getting impatient as my little one was very hungry by now. We were told our dinner was served to another table (what??). Even after the food arrived the apology was more of a formality. We were hoping they give us some discount (at this point I was just going to see what they do, I did not care to ask). Then the server disappeared. I walked to the register, paid and left. Never coming back!"
Angel H.,"Cupertino, United States",1,19,4,2.0,29/6/2017,"Came in on fathers day after hearing my parents talk about how much they enjoyed there 2 previous visits. Our waiter was nice but i guess the kitchen staff was messing every order up because not only did our table complain, 2 other tables near us also complained. We werent notified of sides that were out, so they assumed which side we would like the best and put it on our plate. Manager had the nerve to say they didn't expect so much business that night and the kitchen staff was unorganized. hello its fathers day, of course its about to get crazy. Never again."
Emily R.,"San Jose, United States",41,7,,1.0,22/6/2017,"Omg! I've only been there 2 times and that was enough for me to NEVER want to step foot back in that place AGAIN!!!  Our 1st visit, we got crappy service, server never checked on us and didn't even gave us a refill on our drink. 2nd visit was no better then the 1st visit!!! For one we had to ask who our server was because they took so damn long to come take out order, when my husband got his soup finally, it was cold lumpy and he found a hair!!!!! Ewwwwwwww!!!!! Gross!!!!!! To add insult to injury, the people who were sitting next to us, mind you, they came in way after we did, got their meal before us. At this point i was just done with the whole crappy experience and so i went to my go to spot Taco Mania"
Boo T.,"San Jose, United States",85,1,,1.0,3/11/2017,This is a fairly new restaurant and the customer service and cleanliness was so awful. We walked in the door was not greeted at all waitress finally sits us in a dirty table and puts the menus down and mind u table is filthy. We asked one girl to clean the table and she comes back with dirty towel whipes it sloppy in the process brushing it on us. Had to ask someone again to whipe table down. Server rushed us and was not paying attention well taking our order. We walked in the door about 950pm gave order around 10:10pm and got half food around 10:50pm and on top of that 2 entrees were not cooked right 1 under cooked and 1 to hard to eat like a brick. This place has people walking around with no smiles on their faces and look like they hate their jobs and this is not a good look. Being a manager in the food INDUSTRY for over 10 years this is by far the worst i have ever seen. Management better step up and fix the team before you guys lose business.
Lexie Z.,"San Jose, United States",27,34,23,4.0,2/6/2017,"Seems pretty busy tonight but hostess was nice enough. Wait for table was 10-15 minutes. Manager came checking on staff so that's a good sign. Our waiter looked stressed and noticeably busy but was very friendly and attentive. Good came very quick. Was delicious and I was surprised considering this is applebees. Husband had baby back ribs and I had chicken w/ shrimp (2 for $25 combo). My son had chicken strips which isn't anything to brag about. Overall good food, good service considering how crowded it was."
Brittany C.,"Altus, United States",1,22,5,4.0,19/6/2017,"I naturally don't like Applebee's almost every one has the same bad service and all the same stuff. This one is generally new, so I gave it a chance. It wasn't bad service but it was early lunch. As it started to get busy the service slowed as expected. But we got looked over as far as drinks. The server was kind and courteous. Never got offered drink refills on empty drinks til after bill was paid. Just a small let down, but a big win in my book because this is probably the only Applebee's I'd come back to. ‍"
Audrey S.,"San Jose, United States",75,17,3,2.0,23/5/2017,"We took the family here tonight for dinner and we were sorely disappointed. I mean, it's Applebee's so we were not expecting a Michelin star experience. We were seated and given menus.....half of which were in Spanish. So we shared menus and didn't give it a second thought. I ordered a captain and Diet Coke. Hey, bathing suit season is here. The waiter seemed genuinely confused by my order. I told him I could see the captain Morgan's behind the bar and he seemed relieved. My husband ordered a margarita. We were ready to order our food and placed our orders along with our drinks. Then the wait begun. It was at least 20 minutes before the cocktails came out and we quickly realized my husband's drink order was wrong. We pointed it out to the girl who brought the drinks before the glass was on the table. Because his drink was obviously wrong, I asked if my drink was made with Diet Coke. This was the only special request that was made in our order for four people. She responded by saying that she didn't know because she was only bringing out the drinks. She seemed put out that my husband asked for his drink to be corrected. Our meals came out right after our drinks....before our appetizer which we never received. The food was good, tasty and filling. Another lady brought out the food and she was really nice and friendly.   We did a ""cheers"" with the kids and my youngest clinked her glass too hard and spilled a bit. Not a full tip over but more of a slosh over. 2 servers walked by our table and watched us try to clean this up with our cocktail napkins with no offer of additional napkins or assistance. I asked the third person for extra napkins.    All over the kids menus were notices that kids meals we $1 with paid adult meal on Tuesdays which was a nice surprise. We did not know that going in so were happy to learn that. But when the bill came, the kids meals were full price.    Overall, this place needs to get it together. There were a ton of staff hanging around but only one person was happy or helpful. Food was good but the service sucked."
S P.,"Syracuse, United States",1,6,,1.0,1/6/2017,"Update- 6/01/2017.  Here for the warriors game. Had to sit in the bar side tables instead of at the bar. Got served by Aja. Wow. This was the worst service ever.  She got me a beer and then 10 minutes later said ""I'm swamped... so if I ignore you, I'm swamped."" Wow. Really dude ? That's got response ?not even pretending ?  She was terrible. Came by 2 times in 2.5 hours and made me cloSe so she could leave in the middle. She then proceeded to sit nwxt to me with her friends and kept going back to get her table free food. I don't care about that. She was actually Terrible tho. I just ordered through the computer and got my Stuff from other servers. If it weren't for that- I would've left with one beer instead of the $75+ bill I spent."
Matthew T.,"San Jose, United States",7,13,,1.0,24/5/2017,"In writing this I am taking into consideration that it's not an upscale restaurant. Still I would expect some basics considering I am taking my time to eat and pay for the experience. The food looked like it was just slapped together in a few seconds. The fries were cold and the bacon chicken sandwich was over cooked and flavorless. The service was absolutely terrible, our drinks finally came when dinner was almost over. It was apparent that they were not staffed properly."
Yvette J.,"Edenvale, San Jose, United States",0,4,,1.0,6/8/2017,"I've been here twice now. Each time, I've waited to be seated and then had to wait 30 minutes for a server to take my drink order (after asking people multiple times if we could place our order). I should have just left but we waited so long and the server told us that food was coming out quickly. We waited another 45 minutes to get our food. It was hot, so at least it wasn't sitting around. I will not be dining here again since we have to wait so long and basically get ignored (no drink refills, nobody telling us that our food will be coming out). We were offered a discount on our food and drinks, and they said they were just really busy which is why we tried again, but the same thing happened the 2nd time (on a Wednesday evening when there was no sports event for people to watch at the bar happening)."
Lena R.,"San Jose, United States",8,43,3,2.0,31/5/2017,"Since there is no where to go in S San Jose we were thrilled to at least get Applebys. Been here 4-5 times trying to give them a chance to iron out opening hiccups. But, if anything it's getting worse! Some servers try but, it's obvious there is a break down in management and in the kitchen. When we asked a manager why it took 45 minutes for a salad to come out, he responded that the servers made them! Seriously? How can they serve their tables and make salads? And honestly it's a little disgusting. The management is the back bone and obviously they need to restructure! It takes too long and the servers just hang around. Watch your bill also- they want you to pay from your table and when we checked the screen they had changed us for 2 meals we didn't order. Finally 20 min later when we saw a server, she debated it with us! Luckily, our plates ( from just having apps)were still on the table and we said do you see dinner plates?  Seriously? Your going to question us? They really need to get their stuff together!"
Luis R.,"San Jose, United States",52,21,2,5.0,27/4/2017,I wanted to recognized Alejandra because since we went in our table she was super friendly and wonderful with kids because I had my kids with me and she went out of her way to get them color crayons and coloring books for them and as soon as we we order she was walking around to make sure that if we had any questions or concerns she was on it I want to thank Applebee's for hiring people like Alejandra with an amazing attitude and positive energy and happy to be at work you can tell she has a awesome customer service so if I was able to give you more then 5 stars I would thank you Alejandra and keep up the good work
Maggie B.,"San Francisco, United States",5,96,,5.0,19/3/2017,"Glad this place finally opened!  We had to wait about 20 minutes, but the good news is they didn't understate the amount of time we would have to wait. Hector was really helpful and polite as was Avalon the waitress and Hayden the bartender who made us a blue Hawaiian drink with good rum. I really appreciated the atmosphere and fast effective, friendly service."
Neca N.,"San Jose, United States",91,13,,1.0,13/5/2017,If I could give them a fucken -10 I would holy shit I mean a simple order of sirloin they can't even get right  then they asked if I wanted to wait for me food after everyone was already done like really . Don't come here they suck ass go
