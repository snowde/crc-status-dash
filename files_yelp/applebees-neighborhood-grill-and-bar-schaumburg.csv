Jennifer M.,"Schaumburg, IL",140,349,289,3.0,6/21/2012,"Oberweis was jammed packed and we weren't in a mood for the line so we decided to walk across the parking lot to Applebee's. My boyfriend ordered the Triple Chocolate Meltdown and I went for the Strawberry Cheesecake Dessert Shooter. Not only were the portions generous, the total with tip was less than what it normally costs us at Oberweis!"
Sir J.,"Schaumburg, IL",200,76,13,2.0,2/23/2013,"Prices suck for what it is. They don't serve pitchers.  We went in at 9 for half price appetizers, and in size 2 font on the ad it shows that apparently on Friday and Saturday it doesn't start till 10. So we decided whether or not paying $4 for a premixed Long Island ice tea was worth it, then decided we'd rather go across the street to Easy Street Pub. The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because our waitress was really cool, and I think she wanted to be there even less than we did.  Don't bother going here unless you can get the half price appetizers which are actually worth it. I will admit that the boneless chicken wings are really good here. I just had a subpar experience with this particular location."
Krissy S.,"Hanover Park, IL",23,67,201,1.0,7/11/2013,"The food suck. The service sucks even more. This should be a NO star review. Came here with family and every staff member made us feel like we're bothering them whenever we needed their service. Everybody, I mean from the manager to the server was giving us cold treatment. No smiles, no hellos. Never gonna eat again at any applebees restaurant. And they obviously use frozen vegetables and protein for their food. Yuck. Why did we even think of eating on a chain restaurant like this, IDK. We must be out of our minds when we agreed on going here."
Alvina C.,"Downers Grove, IL",356,268,53,3.0,5/14/2011,"Service was good, food was ok, nothing terribly memorable. I like the wide variety of food on their menu and the new calorie friendly menu.  We went on a weekend night and I thought for sure there was going to be a wait--but we were seated quickly. Don't be fooled by thinking the dessert shooters are small---they were actually a very good portion for the price and a nice way to end the meal."
Joyce A.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",54,79,13,5.0,6/20/2011,"Went in late- about 9 PM Saturday night. John and I were exhausted after spending the day in Evanston painting the condo's kitchen. But we got a fun surprise- a really nice waitress (this is after she's also been working on her feet, too) who was informative, friendly and a top notch waitress!  Her name is Shelly.   Oh yes! And the Special- 2 for $20 was also a winning combination for us. We shared the spinach/cheese dip (we inhaled that) and I had a very well made chincken salad while John had meatballs that were stuffed with cheese. And, they now serve a ""bite"" of dessert for a $1- exactly the right amount of  sweet gooeyness after a big meal, late at night!"
Mike O.,"Cook, IL",32,55,22,3.0,1/5/2013,"It's like any other Applebee's. It's in my neighboorhood, so I come here now and again. Service not bad, nothing amazing."
Amanda C.,"Chicago, IL",171,669,474,3.0,4/10/2011,"When we got there we had to show our ID and a Credit Card with our names on it to drink alcohol (they claim that is Schaumburgs policy). Kinda annoyed when I had to leave mine out and wait for a manager (Applebee's policy) to double check. Really???  Our servers name was Bob, he was attentive and extremely polite. No complaints about the service. My steak was cooked properly, food was good. My boyfriend ordered the Chicken Alfredo w/ broccoli. He was a little displeased, he expected more broccoli. I had a look, I agree. Skimpy on the broccoli. I had the pomegranate margarita, awesome. There was a special, top shelf for $7. They bring you the shaker and leave it on the table. I probably had 4 or 5 glasses all together. Not bad if you ask me. Overall good restaurant, the ID thing annoyed the hell out of me. Felt like an interrogation, get over it Applebees, ""double checking"" is dumb."
Sam M.,"Schaumburg, IL",1115,8,,5.0,12/14/2010,Great service and food. Wonderful staff. Try the 2 for 20! Large to go cup. Pleasant atmosphere.
Marcia T.,"Chicago, IL",34,116,,2.0,4/11/2011,Service was excellent...but food was mediocre...I've been to other Applebees and food has been way better...enjoyed the company =) with my boyfriend but not the food...will not be coming here again....
Kathleen C.,"Glen Ellyn, IL",69,206,,4.0,8/19/2007,"Hearkening back to my high school days, the hubby and I decided we wanted Applebee's for dinner one night. After an appetizer platter of fried goodness I was in coronary heaven. Surprisingly great service - like, better than the Peninsula in the city good!"
Cinder M.,"Chicago, IL",0,49,7,4.0,9/17/2011,Nothing but great service every time we visit. Very friendly and they always ask if we are in a time crunch to get in and out. How nice! Food is always hot and just like we ordered. Love the orange chicken and the steak and potato salad.
Sherill M.,"Dallas, TX",3,308,32,3.0,5/6/2012,"Applebees is nothing special.  I only go here for the toss salad with the delicious hot bacon vinegar dressing.  The salad is just typcial nothing special.  The only problem is its $11 for a tiny plain chicken salad.  I would return much more often if it wasnt so expensive.  I'm no cheap skate, but $11 for a toss salad is ridiculous; I only go for the dressing."
Kari H.,"Wheaton, IL",4,26,,5.0,7/11/2006,"The food is good, but the service is wonderful.  I have been there numerous times with my aunt, who's either in a wheelchair or using a walker.  They have been extremely courteous and have gone out of their way to accommodate her."
Sarah D.,"Matthews, NC",59,349,140,1.0,4/26/2006,Don't do it!! Worst service ever. They forgot us several times! I went there twice just to make a martyr out of myself!
Erika B.,"Schaumburg, IL",5,34,7,1.0,8/7/2007,The service is fine... it is just that the food is so average. Everything is covered in the same spice. Ugh.
