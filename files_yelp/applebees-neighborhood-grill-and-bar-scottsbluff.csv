Conrad B.,"Scottsbluff, NE",31,73,430,3.0,1/5/2017,"Well this Applebee's moved locations not too long ago. The hope was a better overall experience for the customer's. While the location (in our only mall) is nice and also the restaurant looks much better and spacier than before. The food and service are very hit and miss. Sometimes the food is super good and prompt to get to your table. Other times it's not so great and worthy of being sent back. Or it takes so long for it to get there you're put off and don't want to eat it anyways. Service is much the same. Awesome, prompt and attentive staff at times. Other times it takes 15 minutes to get another glass of beer. I've even got up and left due to being in a section where our waitress hadn't came to our table at all for over 10 (maybe 15) minutes after we were seated. All while serving others around us. Also menu is kind of limited and choices aren't that great. Got a ""Triple Bacon Burger"" that only had two slices of bacon, not sure how that's ""Triple Bacon"" in any way. Worth giving a shot just don't expect consistency here."
Serena B.,"Mineral Wells, TX",40,48,34,3.0,6/24/2016,"We went to eat here for father's day and we were left a little disappointed.  Our waiter was very polite and seemed to be a hard worker but nothing seemed to be coming together and we felt uncomfortable.  For one the staff lacks teamwork.  Countless people would walk by and see all our drink were empty and never tried to help.  (The we're not busy).  All of our drinks sat empty more than once.  My husband's steak came out well done and he ordered med rare.  (We didn't complain since we had a failed attempt at getting my husband a steak at a nearby restaurant that came out burnt... we took what we could get).  Our waiter dropped our ticker and started to run off and I had to stop him and say ""but I want a dessert for my husband... is that ok?"".  All around it was awkward.  We will probably be back since there isn't anything really consistent nearby."
Beth K.,"Gering, NE",1,20,,1.0,7/9/2016,I ordered the oriental chicken salad which is my favorite thing on the menu. Upon receiving my salad my chicken on top of the salad was RAW. The chicken was cut into pieces and served to me raw. There's no way the cooks couldn't see it was raw. I told the waitress it was raw and she tried just taking the chicken off and getting me a new piece of chicken. I requested she take the whole salad and give me a new one. I got a new salad that was cooked all the way through and still got charged full price for the salad!! Will never return. Don't want to get food poisoning!!!
Gertie L.,"Rapid City, SD",0,4,2,4.0,9/25/2016,Just had breakfast/lunch.  Food was very good and fast friendly service.  Will eat there again.
Robert G.,"Gering, NE",39,3,5,2.0,3/25/2016,Just ordered the classic burger and fries with the online app. So after I picked it up and brought it home. I go to take the burger out of the box and it was just a hamburger patty in a bun. :( and it cost me $10 bucks.
Steve B.,"Harrisonburg, VA",0,5,,4.0,3/8/2016,Typically good food and selection of drinks. Staff was quick and pleasant. My food was as ordered and came out quickly. We were seating quickly and would come back. I stopped in town for a bite and this place was easy to find and something I was familiar with.
Peggy F.,"Gering, NE",0,7,,2.0,4/16/2016,We finally made it to the Applebee's in the new location. Sadly disappointed. We did two for $25. The steak stir fry was so small we thought it was a child's portion. The wait was okay. The service was okay. You get more for $20 at Chili's. Won't make this restaurant  a regular stop anymore.
Cindy B.,"Scottsbluff, NE",0,7,,1.0,2/18/2016,Just left after waiting for a table for 20 minutes and sitting in a booth for 15 minutes with not one word of acknowledgment from any of the 6 waitstaff and manager that passed by. Not a glass of water or a sideways glance. Will we be back? Not likely. One star rating only because I can't say Applebee's deserves zero.
