Thomas F.,"Salisbury, MA",25,308,337,3.0,5/13/2014,"I have been here for both lunch and dinner.  The food is good more than half the time and compared to other restaurants in the area, this restaurant is not a bad choice.  A private parking lot adjacent to the Staples store, most of the time you arrive, there is plenty of parking.  If it is during peak hours in the evening, and there is a line out the door, then I am sure parking would be tough.  However, I have never been to the restaurant where a parking spot was not available or had to wait in a long line. Once in, and again depending on when arriving restaurant, you are seated wherever a seat is available.  Choice can be a booth or table, or stool near the bar.  The menu is huge and one of the reasons I do not select high stars for this place.  I am not a fan of too many choices on the menu and prefer fewer selections.  For an all-American restaurant, Applebee's should stay with all American food and not deviate by offering to sell fish or something that is completely off the charts. With the huge menu, very little time is an option unless you insist - else the wait staff will push you to order quickly.  If the menu had fewer choices, then perhaps a food selection could be chosen quicker.  More than half the time you go out for dinner, the wait staff wants to hurry things along and get you in and out.  It seems that most of the time we are here, that wait staff push exists which eventually rushes the order.  When Applebee's has a large quantity of choices with no clarification of specials for the day (if you do not ask you will not know), ordering becomes frustrating and I will typically order something I do not really want.  This is why it is best to scan the menu on the web before arriving. With regards to the taste of the food, for the most part it is very good.  With only a few options in the area for restaurants that are decent, I recommend here."
Chris R.,"Saco, ME",50,24,,1.0,8/20/2017,I came in with my friend. It was horrible. The waiter tabby had attitude the whole time. Never once checked up on us. Like how usually they will come and ask how our food is. Not once. Had to ask for the check. Walked by me twice didn't look at us. I had a empty glass. Then her manager walked by and saw as she was walking by. The manager had to ask me for a refill. I could see her talking to other customers pleasantly. Excuse me lady but I did nothing said nothing to you. Not very impressed. Now just found out she was trying to over charge us. By putting a presto game on our tab. I'm on the patio they don't have them out here.
Ian M.,"Kingston, NH",131,1,,1.0,11/30/2017,"Wow! That was the worst service I have ever had. First, we walk in and the hostess is no where to be found. After 5 minutes of waiting we walk to the bar thinking our service will be better, we were wrong. The waitress eventually comes even though it was 9pm and the crowd was sparse to say the least. She was nice.... when she actually came around. We got our first round in no time, and we believed the night was salvaged...once again we were proven wrong. The food came out and we ordered a second round, after roughly 15 minutes, we began to grow restless as we could see our drinks sitting at the bar, growing warmer by the minute. Eventually, the bartender (our savior) realized that there were tables not being tended to. Shortly there after, our ""waitress"" came to check up on us, not realizing that we magically had received our drinks. We promptly ask for our check trying to leave as quickly as possible, of course that was not the case. Once, the bill finally arrived we were overcharged for the drink specials for that night (9pm-close, Goose Island IPA $2.99). We corrected the bill, settled our tab, and can confidently say that we will not be returning to an Applebee's anytime in the near future."
John C.,"Concord, NH",0,176,472,1.0,8/20/2014,"I generally don't ever eat at these national chain restaurants because past experiences have taught me how lousy they are.  My recent visit (this past Monday) was no exception. There were six in our group and we had just finished a half day of deep sea fishing out of Hampton, NH (which was awesome, by the way!) and the majority wanted to stop at this Applebee's.  I went with the flow... Our hostess promptly seated us in the outdoors patio area as we had requested.  Our waitress promptly arrived with menus and took our drink orders.  The waitress was, for the most part, very good and accommodating.  Several in our group fell for the upsell to the gigantic Margaretas instead of the normal size and that was fine except that they tasted like straight fruit juice.  The bartender and then the manager refused to remake the drinks which was not an example of good customer service. The long and the short of the resulting downward spiral is as follows: - Three of the six meals arrived with either partial or fully cold food.  I had the ""all you can eat"" riblettes which arrived cold and the sauce on them was congealed.  The spicy fries were also cold on all of our plates.  The riblettes were disgusting and nothing more than bone and gristle.  I have had these before and they were not as bad as this most recent experience.  I never did order a second round of them. - I asked for an iced tea with lime (yes, I know that is somewhat different than the norm with lemon) and it arrived with no fruit in it.  I asked about the lime and my waitress told me that the head waitress informed her that lime is not included with iced tea.  I tried to send the iced tea back for something different but they wouldn't remove it from the bill which was fine with me.  It's not that expensive. - We asked for the cold food to be replaced.  The waitress said that the kitchen was very busy and it would take a while for reorders.  The manager was summoned and walked over to our table and began lecturing us on the fact that he would not remake the drinks.  Duh!  We told him that it was the cold food we wanted replaced and we were told that if we had eaten it when it was served it would have been hot.  One in our group asked him if he thought we were idiots or perhaps he might have thought we had never dined out before and then he was told to bring the check. - No lie... We waited over 15 minutes for the check to arrive.  The check was wrong (2 drinks on it were never ordered or served to us, my riblettes were not listed at the correct price and a glass of milk was listed on it when we never ordered milk).  After fixing the check, we paid it having felt totally ripped off. Never again shall I enter an Applebee's. What a cluster of a dining experience!"
Sim S.,"Hampton, NH",0,8,,1.0,3/4/2016,"I was in there for a late afternoon early  QUICK BITE dinner with my girlfriend, and it went about how you would expect a Seabrook, NH Applebee's to go... Waitress started by bringing out our drinks, then about 15 min later he comes the appetizers. As she is setting down the semi cold appetizers that are supposed to be steaming hot, she clumsily knocks into my drink and dumps it on my iPhone and my lap. She says excuse me, and walks away. No apology, no can I move you, nothing. I asked for the manager, and out comes this gentleman, wearing a shirt 4 sizes too big and untucked, not very professional. I told him I was not paying for anything as it got either wet or came out cold. I left hungry, wet and iPhone sticky. Never going to a crappy Applebee's chain in a run down Seabrook area ever again."
Nicole W.,"San Diego, CA",139,33,124,5.0,6/14/2015,New dumpling appetizer is really good as well as the siracha shrimp I love the margaritas here and the oriental chicken salad I know it's lunch time but I like dessert so the only constructive criticism is always ask if they want dessert once the check is down I feel weird asking for dessert but normally get apple chimicheesecake or blondie...even ask if you want to take it to go :)  will be back because I like the atmosphere and music and the hostess was very welcoming!
David J.,"Amesbury, MA",0,7,2,4.0,2/4/2015,"I visited with my wife for lunch recently. The waiter was great, accommodating a 1/2 sandwich and salad combo on the weekend by combining our two orders. He was very pleasant and attentive. We had a great lunch and experience."
James G.,"Kingston, NH",263,49,4,1.0,5/21/2014,Not a fan of this location at all. Went one night and paid with a gift card and a twenty dollar bill. Then they both went missing after the waiter picked up the book. Waited for after 20 min for them not to find it then finally got my change and never returned. The manager not sure his name was clueless and should have give the change first not make us wait for no reason. Stay away..
Chad F.,"Newburyport, MA",113,24,5,4.0,1/3/2012,"This is a favorite of mine to bring out the family for a random dinner.  The menu, which is pretty standard for the chain, has a wide variety of food, and a selection of several menu ideas for kids. The food comes in acceptable portions...enough to fill the stomach, but not excessive. Prices are decent."
Jennifer N.,"Stratham, NH",30,48,2,2.0,9/18/2014,"We have liked Applebee's but in this particular location, we did not have a great experience.  They had been swamped that day so I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.  We were seated fairly quickly but from there the pace went very slowly.  We waited for awhile and our waitress seemed to disappear.  Someone new came to our table and said out waitress had been assigned to a big party, so we were not important any longer I guess?  He took our order.  The item we wanted for my son - they were out of it - and he is a very picky eater so that was a problem right away!  We figured something out and then ordered.  It took awhile and then we received our food.  The cross-cut ribs were not good, at all.  They had an odd texture to them and were hard to eat.  The kids meal portions were small, but they were cheaply priced so I get it.  No one checked on us, no real service until towards the end when a third waitress appeared to help us out and get the bill.  I am not sure we would visit this location again."
Neal S.,"Carrollton, GA",8,2,,1.0,10/14/2013,We had to wait a long time for our food. The temperature of the food was cold. The server was slow to refill our drinks. We were not the only table to experience this.
David S.,"Marietta, GA",1,4,3,1.0,10/14/2013,Poor ability to put hot food on the table in a timely manner. Over twenty minutes to bring food out and forgotten drink order food was warm at best and skimpy on one plate. Manager appeared to be putting our a few fires at other tables too.
