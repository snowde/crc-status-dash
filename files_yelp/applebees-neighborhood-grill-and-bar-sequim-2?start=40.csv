Susan T.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/5/2013,"After a day of hiking, my hubby and I stopped in Applebee's Sequim for a drink and whatever else we decided to eat/drink.  We were seated in the bar at one of those tall tables with stools.  We sat there for about 15 minutes before a waitress came to take our order.  We ordered a couple of beers.  Mind you, aside from the bartenders 3 buddies at the bar, we were the only customers in the bar, and the restaurant wasn't busy either.  I know the people seated at the bar were the bartenders buddies because he was engrossed in deep conversation with them, and referred to them multiple times as ""Bro"".  After the waitress took our order we waited about another 15 minutes and nada, nothing, zip....crickets.  My husband caught the eye of the bartender a couple times but he was too busy with his ""Bros"".  So we walked out - and you can be sure we won't be back."
Phil T.,"Brinnon, WA",16,13,,4.0,12/11/2012,"This is a good Applebee's. Chain yes...but the food is always good and the staff always friendly. Coming on the weekend? Head straight to the bar. Greg (is that his name?) is an amazing bartender, he knows everyone's names. Not sure how he does it but he remembers everyone. Great happy hour prices too!"
Brad W.,"Cincinnati, OH",18,39,4,3.0,1/3/2008,"If you're looking for an Applebee's, this one is as good as any. Most of the folks here always appear to be regulars. The staff here is friendly, and the bar service is prompt."
Ro M.,"Elkhart, IN",1,54,,4.0,7/25/2012,Met my expectations for an Applebee's.  Service was great.  Prices cheaper than other local sit down restaurants.
Bruce P.,"Sequim, WA",0,21,2,1.0,3/3/2006,"We have eaten here twice.  Both times it was the same.  The employees are pleasant and congenial, however the food is so bland that it has no taste whatsoever.  It is as if they have some sort of a ""Taste Extractor"" in the kitchen whereby they remove all vestige of taste from the food and then sell it to some other restaurant to put into their dishes.  Uncanny!"
