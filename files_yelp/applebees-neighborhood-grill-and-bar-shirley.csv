Kathleen D.,"Shirley, NY",0,3,,3.0,1/10/2018,"Food is good for the chain restaurant it is.  Atmosphere is fine as well.  Servers could be a little more attentive.  Overall average, not so bad, could be worse."
Arnold H.,"Upper East Side, NY",356,31,1,1.0,8/22/2017,"Ok More like night of the living dead.  Please close this place!  The Popeyes next door was closed so I figured a club soda and Chicken Tortilla soup, since I missed dinner. Should be a dentists office as people were missing teeth all over the place.  No soup for me. They were out of Tortilla soup.  No refill on my club soda.  The barmaid threw napkins at me.  18 minutes later the Applebees magic trick...cold French fries.  I am now home eating 273 mini Swedish fish as I'm still starving.  This place is a hell hole."
Ever G.,"Remsenburg, Remsenburg-Speonk, NY",0,4,1,1.0,1/1/2018,"I'm writing to criticize the quality (or lack there of) of the food. This place is normally a nightmare. While the service isn't as TERRIBLE, at least in my experience as some people may say it is. The food is substandard as usual. It feels like every time I take my family here something is missing. This time it was ""the cool shot glass"" they serve the ice cream shooter in. Contradictory to what I wrote earlier the servers aren't the most attentive employees. Avoid this place if possible."
Cristie G.,"Shirley, NY",80,191,222,2.0,6/22/2017,"It's so hard to review chains...because I guess I expect all Applebee's food to be the same. And this is no different. It's your typical Applebee's food. But what sets this place apart....service and the funk. That's right, I said it, the funk. The place has a weird odor...like B.O. from a locker room, or wet dog carpet.  The service...leaves something to be desired for sure. Each time I have been here it has taken maybe 5 mins to be sat. (So not long) But then my meal takes like 25-30 mins to come out. Do not expect to get your drink refilled. Because your server will likely never check on you. Last time...I ordered two drinks out the gate. So...I would avoid this place like the plague if I were you."
Shannon S.,"Holbrook, NY",221,2,,1.0,10/16/2017,"Come here late night with friends. Server never came over. We asked the manager for the check and when we asked for $5 on one card,etc he said ""let me write this down so I don't fuck it up"" very unprofessional"
Lisa F.,"Shirley, NY",0,2,,1.0,12/16/2017,"This is by far the worst Applebee's,Went there today about 3:45 got seated right away no one after about 20 minutes even came to our table to see if we wanted something to drink, There was waitress and waiter everywhere and they just kept walking by everyone not helping anyone including the Manager!! They should be ashamed to call that an Applebee's cause I've been to other locations and this is by far the worst and it's not the first bad experience there!! I guess they don't give a shit!!!By the way that's why we walked out!!!"
Theresa O.,"Mastic, NY",62,41,5,1.0,4/13/2017,"I ordered food online and requested to pick it up via curbside. It says you have that option on their site. When I got there I realized there is no curbside so I had to go inside. (Which was annoying because it's super crowded) the host pointed me to back of the restaurant to pick up my food. I waited an extra 10 minutes for someone to come to that area. I paid and she gave me back change but dropped it all over the floor and laughed. Ok so you're not getting a tip.  Next, I brought the food home and it was cold so I had to reheat it anyway. Also it had 0 flavor. What's your deal Applebee's?"
Taylor F.,"Shirley, NY",0,1,2,1.0,10/24/2017,"Absolutely terrible. Ordered food over the phone around 7:00pm on Friday, got there at 7:35 to find out the person who wrote down my order never put it in the computer. The guy apologizes and says he placed my order in now. After waiting another twenty minutes a guy comes out with a bag that only has the two appetizers I ordered and not my meal. The guy apologizes and places the order in the computer for the butchers meat and potatoes with extra tomatoes. After waiting another 25 minutes for my food, the guy comes out with my food in a bag and I take it home. I get home and open it to it being a small blob of mashed potatoes, a few pieces of tomato and meat that was cooked terribly. They charged me for only the appetizers because of them not placing my order in the computer and me having to wait so long for my food, although I would have rather pay for my meal and get what I ordered rather than a blob of food. Attached is a picture of what it should have been and what I received. I was not even given any of the toppings. This was the worst experience I have ever had at an apple bees location and will never EVER eat food from here again. Absolutely furious."
Kristen W.,"East Moriches, NY",30,63,8,1.0,3/15/2017,"This place is really nothing to write home about.  Knowing we were eating at Applebees we didn't go in with high expectations, and our low expectations were surely met.  The French onion soup was barely palatable and the appetizers were straight out of a microwave.  I suppose if you're going for half price apps and drinks during happy hour it's a deal but if you're going to enjoy your food- AVOID!"
Eray C.,"Manorville, NY",0,13,16,1.0,8/1/2017,This place is suck. They have no hot water they cant serve food. Well boiled. We gather 5 people order food than they kick us out. Never go back there. 2 of my friend come from queens.
Stacie B.,"Shirley, NY",0,3,3,1.0,8/8/2017,"My boyfriend and I ordered 2 for $20 take out. After we picked it up and got home about 15 minutes later we realized we were given the wrong order (I guess we should have double checked before we left). I called and we drove back to pick up the correct order. I accidentally forgot to bring in the wrong order and I was asked to get it from my car, which I know they throw out anyway because they can't give it out after it left with me. We got home and we had to heat everything up again, our order had to have been sitting for about 45 minutes before we got to eat it. On top of that a bunch of the lettuce in my salad was brown. Just ridiculous."
Charles S.,"Mastic, NY",0,5,,1.0,4/15/2017,Called in a pick up order and was told 20 mins. We arrive at the 20min mark to find out Monica who took the order didn't even put it in yet. Awful customer service. Way to be on top of your game MONICA!!!!!
Debbie D.,"Eastport, NY",0,5,,2.0,5/23/2017,Was on the road and knew we would be passing by this location.  Called to place an order.  We were on hold for so long we hung up and called back.  This time person took order immediately when we said we were left on hold.  We were actually in the parking lot by that time so what's the point of calling ahead for takeout?  Place was quiet at 3 p.m.  Maybe they were under staffed.... just frustrating.
Gary W.,"Mastic, NY",6,22,30,3.0,12/21/2016,"The place is decorated really nice for the holidays. we stopped coming a few months ago because the food was extremely salty. So salty we stopped coming for months. we came tonight because we needed to grab something fast to eat I had a steak (was a little smaller than 6oz, it was more like 4) but it was done perfect and both our dishes were much better.. a lot less salty."
Victor A.,"Washington, DC",1,22,9,1.0,8/18/2016,"I can not even put into words the level of disrespect I experienced at this location. I came in with a group and our waiter/greeter said ""oh great some Hispanics"" and he shook his head.  We were a group of 11 celebrating our nieces choir performance. I believe our money is the same color as everyone else's."
Christin M.,"Sound Beach, NY",104,4,2,1.0,11/3/2016,"Horrible !!!I had rotten tomatoes in my food and so did my daughter and the manager insisted that they were fresh and they were cut this morning he definitely didn't try them they were sour ,water locked and rotten instead of apologizing he said they were fine like it was my fault he is very unprofessional ,he is definitely in the wrong business he has absolutely no customer service skills and is rude . The waitress Melissa on the other hand was sweet and attentive."
Nicole J.,"Town of Brookhaven, Long Island, NY",0,10,14,1.0,7/6/2016,"This is one of the worst Applebees. Undercooked, flavorless food. They forget to include things in your order and when you ask them to omit something from your meal they say okay and then put it in anyway. The food is trash. I ordered the beer pub pretzels and it included a tablespoon of cheese. Ordered a kids meal and the food wasn't even cooked. Next time I'll go to the location in my town."
Erik D.,"Medford, NY",229,131,20,3.0,9/2/2015,"Okay, well... I had a good experience and a bad one... I'll dish the veggies first. I'd say a month and a half ago... I went here with a bunch of friends i'd say around 8pm-ish? It was a bunch of us, 7 guys total. When we first got seated, they placed us in a tight booth, practically sitting on top of one another and also behind us was a really sweet family with young kids. Knowing how rowdy our conversations could get, plus the size of the table, we asked kindly to be seated at a bigger booth.  So at first it seemed like the waiter was rather bothered by it, but we didn't think anything of it. After a few moments, same waiter came over and asked what we all wanted to drink. A few of us got beer. Others got regular soft drinks and few waters. The waiter doesn't return for approx 35 some odd mins. At this point we are all ready to order apps and even our dinner. When the waiter did return, he dropped off our drinks and then left again, we all watch as he walks over to his Co-Workers just to chat. He finally decides to return and take our order after chatting it up for 15mins. We place orders and 30mins later it comes out. Night goes on... Place starts filling up now due to the 1/2 off App'fanatics.... We basically can't find our waiter for the check. Completely like MIA... wasn't taking orders, wasn't serving food in the section, nothing... It was bazaar. Finally after another 20mins we were able to pay. As I go to leave, I notice my keys are missing. So I look around the table, on the seats, on the floor... Can't seem to find them. So I assumed that maybe I had lost them when we moved seating.. so I walk over to our old bench and had asked if anyone has seen my keys. They all said ""no the seats were cleaned before we got here"". So now I go up to the hostess desk and ask the girls if they have seen a set of keys or perhaps had someone turn a set in.. They all replied ""no"" Nobody continued to help, nobody really cared. Yeah its my fault I lost my keys, but I figured someone would of at least help spread the word for me or something. Being 5 of us came in one vehicle.. we couldn't leave.. I keep searching for our waiter.. finally he came into sight and I asked him and he ended up saying ""yeah, its in the hostess desk""... Soooo for 30mins of not knowing where my keys are they were at the hostess desk where I asked if they were there before...  You would think when we got moved and our waiter found a set of keys, he would of asked if it was any of ours. I guess that's what really urked me about this particular Applebees. However on the flip side... perhaps 2 weeks ago I went once and the waitress was wonderful! she was really sweet and she interacted with us. Right off the bat she asked what we wanted to drink. She threw our drink orders in, and then came back asking if we knew what we wanted, She even gave a whole recommendation on the new items that were on the menu. We had a great time chatting with her. Our drinks were always full, she came back to check on us a few times. Once she saw the napkins on the plates and such, she asked how everything was, and asked if we were ready for desert or if we wanted the check. That's quality service. Also keep in mind, this was again prime time dinner time so around 6:30pm. She was just able to hustle and keep customers happy. Employees like that is what makes experiences at a restaurant, fun and enjoyable I guess this place is just a 50/50 shot when it comes to service. So 3 Stars for now."
Shawn B.,"Coram, NY",0,2,,1.0,3/12/2017,Had there brew cheese pretzels on Friday and gave me food poisoning wouldn't let my dogs eat the food they serve here
Aimee L.,"Mastic Beach, NY",120,97,485,3.0,7/7/2014,It's Applebee's. 2 for 20 is always worth it. I get tired of it though. I also wish they put an even ratio for the cake and ice cream for the Triple Chocolate Meltdown...
Garry S.,"East Quogue, NY",1,212,,2.0,4/19/2016,"I go only for the advertised specials.  The place is sometimes a zoo, too crowded. So you've got to be patient unless you're lucky enough to just catch it at the right time and can get a table."
Genesis C.,"Mount Sinai, NY",0,6,,1.0,11/6/2015,"Eh...  Waitresses/waiters should just find other jobs, honestly, We could just tell how much you guys hate your jobs. Not only did our waitress forget the majority of the things for us but she was late for everything and was very inattentive. I came in about 10 minutes late to meet up my friends the waitress didn't realize until 15 minutes of passing by that I didn't even order nor got a drink and said ""Oh Im sorry, do you want anything"" like NO I just came in here to look at the dark lighting -____-  and let me not get started with the drinks. They didn't want to serve me because I was ""underage"" when my ID shows my DOB in fine prints and says I AM 21, like really? why would I give you guys a fake ID? She ended up calling the manager because apparently she didn't know how to read date of births. I up and left saying you guys lost a customer, bye (:  have not gone there since."
Cici C.,"New York, NY",15,20,4,1.0,7/22/2015,I saw this on Facebook: I would never go there. There is no excuse for what's  happening in the video.
John D.,"Mastic Beach, NY",0,17,3,4.0,1/10/2016,Nice experience watching the playoffs. The tvs over the bar were very small however. The staff is polite.
Shane-Michael Aiden G.,"Ridge, NY",2,4,,4.0,10/5/2014,Good food and decent drink prices. Hit or miss with service at this location. Depends on who's working and how busy it is. Still a great place to hang with friends and enjoy a meal.
Erin B.,"Providence, RI",21,19,,1.0,10/12/2014,Sat at the bar and had the absolute worst bartender ever...Amanda.  She didn't crack a smile or care at all about doing her job one bit.  I can't even believe this was acceptable for even an Applebee's.
Shawn W.,"Burbank, CA",466,73,72,5.0,4/8/2015,My neighborhood late night quick bite spot. Krystle is the BEST WAITRESS EVER!! She always remembers our orders from the last visit and remembers our drinks. She's the main I keep coming back!
Eric A.,"New York, NY",25,39,,5.0,11/25/2013,"A great place to go with friends and family! The food is always delicious and the waitstaff are attentive.  Most of the time I never even have to ask for a refill of my beverage. Always crowded, especially after 10pm, but it is worth the wait.  I love the atmosphere here, the walls are decorated with so many great local pictures and pieces of local history. The manager's are always walking around and they are always present when they are needed. I actually take offense to Dave K's post regarding ""incest"" and the ""Locals"".  I have always found the Shirley Applebees to be a great family place, and I have been coming here since the first week they opened."
G Q.,"Queens, NY",4,12,17,4.0,1/15/2015,Wait staff is always friendly and at night appetizers are half off.  Only negative I have is that the kitchen staff seems to have a hard time preparing red meat.   It almost never comes to the table the way you requested.  Any other food and your good to go.
Eileen A.,"Southampton, NY",0,26,,1.0,10/3/2016,"I am so sorry that our Shirley Applebee's has become such a dump! Haven't been there in months because of bad service and even worse food but tried again this afternoon hoping something had changed. Walked in the front door to two waitresses and a female manager discussing where they get their nails done. We were left standing there until I finally said something to them about ignoring us. They blamed each other for not seating us. The best part was when I asked who the manager was today, Dolly and the other waitress actually said they didn't know the manager's name ! Really ? Come on now! Our waiter was very nice. His only crime was that he shorted me .25 in my change. Actually I've had that happen here before and was given the excuse that there was no change in the drawer! No problem he just got less of a tip. It was 4 o clock this afternoon. Place was nearly empty and yet tables were dirty . The bartender was wearing a hoodie, just another example of a restaurant gone rogue!"
Michele N.,"Shirley, NY",4,3,1,1.0,2/2/2016,all i can say is that my Mom and Aunt got food poisoning there on Sunday and it's just awful watching my Mom be sick....
Manorville M.,"Manorville, NY",9,47,24,4.0,1/11/2016,Typical fare and good service. Pretty good meals that rarely change. Predictable which is a good thing sometimes.
Lisa S.,"Shirley, NY",0,16,,1.0,1/24/2015,"Ordered take out and was extremely disapointed with the amount and quality of food. We ordered a trio appetizer and two burgers made the same way. Appitizers were not just cold but chilled, as if they had just been taken out of the refrigerator and not re heated. The amount of food was only a quarter of what you would normally get if you were dining in house. I wouldn't mind if I wasn't paying full price for my meals."
Katie R.,"Mastic Beach, NY",0,30,5,2.0,9/25/2013,"Its applebees. If you haven't been to applebees Im pretty sure you don't live in America. This applebees in particular is sub-par though. I've actually asked to speak to the manager and never had the manager come over, he sent the waitress over to tell us what he could offer us, but never came over himself even when I requested myself, Check your meal they make ALOT of mistakes. Some of the waitresses are really nice- and there's no other real option like this in town, so if you're desperate..."
Patrick P.,"Center Moriches, NY",182,29,1,1.0,10/12/2013,Slow service! Me and my girlfriend recently went out for a quick bite to eat. We sat at our table for a good 10 min till our waitress came to ask for our order! She was very rude to us and didn't even look at us when we talked to her.. Our French fries were cold and soggy.. I also heard that their food is microwaved...
Daniel E.,"Eastport, NY",0,1,,1.0,11/2/2014,Service was lacking in the sense that we waited 20 minutes to get water. Another 30 minutes to get a few things. Extremely poor service and would not recommend this location. And finally when the food arrives it looked as though a 10 year old put it together in art class. Overall I am very dissatisfied
Nick D.,"Mastic, NY",1,1,,5.0,3/29/2014,i Love this place its a fun amazing restaurant to bring the family. My grandaughter loves to go to apple bees after her football games. And my grandson loves going after his baseball games so we actually do go kind of often. I would definitely recommend this place if you want to have nice family fun.
Melissa B.,"Shirley, NY",0,2,,1.0,3/31/2014,Awful service. Took 15 minutes to be greeted after seated when it was NOT busy. Rude waiters and a manager aimlessly walking around. The waiter even attempted to short us $10 in change of a 100.
Lucia F.,"Shirley, NY",38,250,70,5.0,11/26/2009,5 stars ONLY because of the half-priced apps after 10 pm My friend and I come here late night to catch up. We usually ask for a table way in the back to get away from everyone. All the times we've gone the place was packed after 10.  An excellent waiter to have is Pablo.
Arthur D.,"Sparks, NV",0,2,,4.0,2/16/2011,"Excellent service, steaks prepared properly to order, and food was out in a timely manner. Also, 2 for 1 Sam Adams when we went in (Wed. night about 11:30). Stayed open till 1 am. Best bet for the area."
