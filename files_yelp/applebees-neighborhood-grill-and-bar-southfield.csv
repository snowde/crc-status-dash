Shane K.,"Franklin, MI",101,9,5,2.0,12/17/2017,Disappointment to the least. Truly the reason chain restaurants are now at their downfall. The employment of individuals with no desire to profit from hard work shows directly within the confines of this NEW establishment. Being less than a few years old in a new thriving plaza. I would expect corporate let alone the owner paying rent for franchise to be optimizing not only his profits but employees. With more than a hour and half remaining before close and the acknowledgement of their closing the rudeness is inexcusable. I truly wish businesses such as these did a better job of creating responsibility. Also place was ridiculously filthy and trashed.  Wouldn't let a homeless man eat here
Jennifer P.,"Southfield, MI",85,13,26,1.0,12/10/2017,"I've been to this chain restaurant multiple times in the past few years. And by ""multiple"" I mean like five times in total. Each time was bad and more worse than the previous visit. This is probably my final time giving a chance to this specific restaurant. Let me tell you about my other experiences before this one: Each and EVERY TIME the servers have been slow. You practically have to beg them for attention. No matter if they have one table or fifty tables, you definitely won't be getting water until at least 20 minutes of sitting there twiddling your thumbs. By that time, I make sure I tell my friends to get ready to order what they wanna eat since we probably won't be seeing the waiter or waitress again for another 20 minutes. There was one time where I came with a group of friends. It was a triple date so there was six of us in total. The waitress gave us water and inside the cup it had the pieces of paper from the straw pretty much compounded in there as if they don't wash the cups after every use. DISGUSTING is all I gotta say to that. And it wasn't just one or two of our cups, it was every single one.  This specific time, we came in for their Steak and Potatoes deal that's been advertised with every YouTube ad out there. Boyfriend was hungry so I decided to treat him. We haven't went to this place for MONTHS due to the bad service every time, but decided to go here since this was the closest Applebee's location.  When I got there, I checked in -- FREE APPETIZER with a purchase of a beverage! Nice! The waitress finally comes around and I let her know about the deal as well as us already being ready to order our steak and potatoes meal. The appetizer is eventually brought out and when it is brought out, the waitress lets us know that they've ran out of steaks. What? -- Erm, that's quite disheartening especially knowing that they have that special. But we didn't make a big deal out of it and decided to look at the menu again. Once we finished our appetizer, we decided to just go to another Applebee's for the steak and potato special (what can I say? We were craving it) and made sure we called the next closest Applebee's to us, to make sure they had steaks. We let the waitress know that we weren't interested in anything else and would like the bill. I waited for her to come back with it and she came back to tell us that they didn't have any more 8oz steaks, but had 6oz steaks. What (again)? I really just wanted to say, ""why didn't you tell us that in the first place?"" But refrained since I didn't want to come off as rude. At that point, my boyfriend and I decided to stay and deal with it. We ordered medium rare and our steaks came out well done. *Sigh* It's like they can't do anything right here. Another thing to add is that EVERY time, no matter what the circumstance was -- whether there was paper in my water cup or the waitress lying to us recently and telling us there were no more steaks -- we never got compensated. I mean, even offering a free dessert would have changed my mind about the customer service here a little bit.  All in all, try it out for yourself but I can GAURANTEE you the service is below average. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you were my worst enemy."
Bryan S.,"Orange County, CA",190,90,5,1.0,10/4/2017,"Applebee's has been disappointing time after time... First visit - I order a beer. They're out. I pick another. They're out of that too. I ask what they DO have, and it's nothing I want. The food also took forever to come out! Second visit - I got a coupon in the mail. Decided to give it a second go. The guy loses my coupon from the bar counter to the register. It's literally like 3 feet away. The bartenders use those little goblets to measure pours. I don't even think they're full pours. Grab a beer (if they have any). Third visit - It took about 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge me and take my drink order. I came before the crowd, so I'm not sure why the service was so slow. I ordered food and a drink. After waiting forever and a day, the drink came out, but the food never came. A server notices that I don't have my food so she went back to check. She never came back so I called another server from that electronic device on the table. Nobody came. At one point, I saw a server walk past me and try to place food on a table nearby. The family let them know that they didn't order what she brought out. Thinking back, maybe it was my order, but it wouldn't make sense that she wouldn't know where the order came from. I ordered the food from the electronic device on my table. Why would she take it to another table? She also hurried off instead of trying to figure out where the order came from. She never came back, so maybe it wasn't mine. After wasting an hour trying to get some food, I paid for the drink and left. I probably won't be back for awhile."
Niyah J.,"Inkster, MI",42,2,,1.0,12/27/2017,"I should have read the reviews.  This place is terrible for so many reasons.  Today I went with my family after seeing a movie.  We were sat, then ignored for 25 min...no water, no greeting, no waiter, nothing!  While speaking to a neighboring table we learned that they had been waiting an hour for their food after waiting 40 min for the server to even acknowledgee .    My party of 7 decided to leave and on the way out I asked to speak to the manager.  Her excuse was that they were closed (it was 7 pm...but the sign sad 12) and that I should not have been sat by the hostess.  Huh?!  She then went on to say that they were having ""issues"" and the police were on the way.  My kids love Applebee's but this place is a circus.  If you actually want a pleasant dining experience, do not come here!!!!!"
Karianne G.,"Center Line, MI",0,3,1,1.0,10/3/2017,"Not only was this my worst Applebee's experience, it was the worst restaurant I have ever been in. The restaurant wasn't even busy and it still took the waitstaff a half an hour to even acknowledge that we were standing at the front. After we waited another 10 minutes we just walked away.  I understand this place has a terrible reputation, but I wanted to give it a try anyway... never again.  It looked like it was everyone's first day and had no idea what was going on.  Applebee's is one of my favorite restaurants, I'm sad that this is the only one around me."
Mercedes V.,"Detroit, MI",18,128,2077,2.0,7/28/2016,"Like what you read with other reviews, this location needs to improve their service and food. Dined for two.  Asked for a table by the window.   4 of the servers made us wait for awhile.   They decided to where we should sit.   The fact there's available tables near us, but we were seated all the way to the back.   Wasn't happy about it. Ordered the 1 appetizer, 2 entree for $25  Boneless wings, half rack pork ribs with onion rings and coleslaw, and bourbon street chicken and shrimp. It's a good deal.  Small portions though.   The taste was bearable to keep the stomach full,  but I was not palatably satisfied.   You may need to season the ribs with salt, while the shrimp had some dressing drizzled on top that tasted bitter for me. Be careful when you change the sides, because it may cost extra.  My husband asked if it's ok to have onion rings instead of fries for the ribs.   The server said  it's ok, and made us believe there was no charge.  When we checked out, we got billed extra $1.99 for that. What's unique about Applebee's is the touch screen gadget they placed per table.  It's a mini tablet where you can order your meals, request drink refill, and pay by swiping your credit card.  Be aware when kids start playing games...it's extra $1.99 to play unlimited in the tablet. By the way, when I opened Yelp and click check in, I received a Free Appetizer offer from Applebee's. I'm keeping it till my next visit."
Julianna P.,"Warren, MI",0,2,1,1.0,10/19/2017,"Worst Applebee's I've ever been to. I have gotten the car side to go a few times for lunch and the service is horrible. Be prepared to sit and wait in your car for about 30 minutes before you get your food. I have had a few bad experiences there but mostly minor stuff. I kept telling myself it wasn't a big deal and sometimes things happen, so no reason to get upset. But today was the last straw. I ordered my food online, said it would be ready st 11:15, I didn't get there until 11:30 purposely hoping that would minimize the 30 minute wait period that I'm usually parked out there for. Ten minutes later a server comes out and asks my name, says she had my order and she will be right back. Never see her again. About 5-10 minutes later a gentleman comes out asks me the same thing and says he will get my order together. When I get my food EVERYTHING is wrong. Even though I just explained to two different people EXACTLY what I got. They gave me the wrong salad, wrong dressing and Mac & cheese was missing chicken tenders and looked like plain dry noodles with 7 strands of shredded cheese melted over  the top. When I told him it was wrong he brought out a small sauce size container with my ""chicken tenders"" which was pretty small bits of breading from what may have been chicken at one point, and didn't put a lid on the salad dressing which spilled mostly outside of the carry out container. On the bright side, i got out of there in 25 minutes..."
Olivia N.,"Birmingham, MI",29,11,1,1.0,10/17/2017,Literally the worst Applebee's location there is. The customer service is awful. The wait time is so long for even something as simple as water. The food is awful (you're lucky if they get your order right). Just don't go to this Applebee's ever.
Claudette M.,"Kitchener, Canada",231,20,391,4.0,10/20/2017,"This was my last stop before going home from my book signing in Chicago. I love Applebee's and always get the Fiesta Lime Chicken which is gluten-free. The restaurant was clean and your typical Applebee's. My server, Diamond, did an okay job, but do you ever feel like you're talking to someone and they don't really listen? That's kind of how I felt. I asked for extra Pico de Gallo but she didn't bring it. I asked her not to put slaw in my husband's takeout dinner of chicken strips. He hates the sight of it. She put it in anyway. As I was leaving, I said goodbye and thank you to her. She was at another table but didn't even acknowledge my existence. I got my food in good time and she brought everything she should, but I just felt like she didn't care. I don't get to go out to eat that often, so I don't like being made to feel that way, especially when the servers for the rest of my trip were busier but offered great service with much more friendliness.  The chicken was delicious and hubby enjoyed his chicken and cheese sticks as well, but I would pick a different location for sure next time."
Paris J.,"Southfield, MI",57,56,60,2.0,5/10/2017,"Update: Management did reach out to both apologize and hear more about the experience. Since they did try to correct the wrong and actually reached out, I felt a little better knowing the situation would be addressed and hopefully won't happen again. Terrible, terrible, terrible!!!! The place is empty yet our order was screwed up. It took forever to get our waitress to come to our table so send the food back. Finally we sat for 20mins waiting on a bill, remind you the place was empty. STAY AWAY!!!"
Millie B.,"Canton, MI",0,5,,1.0,10/6/2017,"Would not give them even a one star review but unable to enter a review unless a star is selected. They deserve a - zero not one star. Absolute poorest service ever!!!! Sat 25-30 minutes watching wait staff walk around looking angry/overwhelmed and uninterested in serving any customer. The weirdest thing is the place was not busy. Approached the bartender who could see us sitting there and knew that we hadn't even been given water, to see if we could at least get our drinks and was told she couldn't take a drink order and we were to wait for a unavailable server.  We waited a bit further and were again not approached! We walked out after we were never approached by any staff member. They all appeared angry to be there working. WILL NEVER GO NEAR THAT PLACE AGAIN!! Shut it down!"
Kent H.,"Midland, MI",0,1,,2.0,10/2/2017,"The restaurant was clean and the service friendly. The food was average.  However; the problem was the speed of service. What should've been a one hour visit was about 1 hour and 40 minutes. Took about 6 minutes before the wait staff showed up. It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks from the bar (was told the bar was the hold up). Once we finally got our drinks we ordered our appetizers and meal at the same time. After about 20 minutes my wife and son's meal showed up... before the appetizer and before my salad.  When they finally brought my salad they didn't bring the appetizer.   For dinner I ordered boneless wings and regular wings. They also forgot my french fries. When I brought this to their attention they quickly brought it out. The appetizer was brought out with my meal. We asked for a second round of drinks and it was at least 15 minutes before they brought them to us. Based on the service, while friendly, it was not very good. Long wait. I probably would not visit again as I do not want to encounter such slow service."
Michelle K.,"Farmington Hills, MI",0,1,1,1.0,4/2/2017,"The whole entire restaurant is a mess. Even customers passing by stated ""man they really need to clean over here"". That's very sad. Shows how this business is ran."
Sarah G.,"Huntington Woods, MI",372,316,88,1.0,7/29/2016,"I am honestly embarrassed to even admit that I ate at an Applebee's. I don't remember the last time I ate at an Applebee's and after today I cannot imagine myself EVER returning.  Heres the deal. I told my 5 year old that she could eat anywhere for having an awesome week. I guess she had seen a lot of applebees commercials and she begged me to take her here. Fine. I figured ""how bad could it be"". We walked in and were immediately seated. Then we waited, and waited and waited. About 2 tables away all the servers were congregating over a back table. No one seemed to care. No one brought us water.  I finally waved someone down and explained that we had been waiting 15 min. No apologies. Just ""well I do not handle your table but I guess I can help you out"". During this time my 5 year old discovered the iPad on the table. I thought. Ok...this is kind of cool. Little did I know we would later be charged for the usage. There were no parental locks. No warnings that we would be charged. OF COURSE my 5 year old would grab the iPad on the table and just start using it.  Once we finally ordered it took forever for our food to come out. I don't remember what my daughter ordered but they were out of something so they just brought something else instead. Didn't ask us. Just brought something else. So odd. My food was barely cooked. The vegetables in my skillet were still raw and I was honestly nervous to even eat the shrimp on my plate because they just did not seem cooked. I could have sent it back but it was nearly impossible to find anyone to help us.  I feel like I could go on and on. I was shocked how horrible the service and the meal was. I went in with an open mind because my kid was so excited but there was not one good part about our meal. Not one. I did ask for the manager but after waiting an extended amount of time we just left. I didn't feel like exhausting any more of my energy on this place. I wish I could give zero stars. Just horrible. sidenote: someone from applebees messaged me saying she was concerned and interested in my feedback. when I responded I never heard back from them. why even reach out if you are not going to respond?!?"
Ashley B.,"Southfield, MI",41,68,68,4.0,2/27/2017,"It's been a LONG time since I was at Applebees's so I was pleasantly surprised at the new menu. I ordered the Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken which was so moist and flavorful. It was a unique blend of flavors and I appreciate how quickly it arrived at the table after I ordered it.  I will be returning and next time I will be trying a drink (the drink menu was tempting, a lot of new recipes to try)."
Karen S.,"Southfield, MI",0,2,,1.0,6/16/2017,"This place was better run when it first opened. Now the service (especially at the bar) is nothing short of awful. Don't get acknowledged for several minutes and had to repeat my order twice , as the other bartender interrupted the one who was taking my order TWICE.  One star is one too many."
Kelly H.,"Pontiac, MI",24,4,,2.0,10/11/2017,"We stood at the hostess stand alone, no one greeted us for almost 7 minutes.  Someone finally approached us.  We asked to sit in Liz's section because she was AWESOME last time we visited.  It's been weeks and she remembered our names and what we drink!    The rest of the place is sub-par, but Liz is one great reason to visit this location.  Without her smiling , friendly face there isnt much reason to pick this location over other area restaurants.   The food was ok, $1.00 margaritas were good, but I give this Applebees zero stars and Liz five stars so that averages to 2.5 stars for the experience."
S D J.,"Southfield, MI",0,1,,1.0,10/13/2017,"This restaurant has a good location. It is clean and attractive. I strongly recommend that you go in for dinner. Tried curbside pick up and waited 45 minutes even though I arrived 20 minutes late for the order! When I did receive the order, half of the food inside was not what I had ordered. I then had to wait for them to find my food. I then had to wait for them to complete my order. By the time I got home the hot food was cold and the cold food was warm! It tasted okay, but it was not an experience I would ever look forward to again."
Jeremy N.,"Southfield, MI",420,335,20,1.0,10/4/2016,"Incredibly slow service, smaller than usual portioned food, and just an odd setting overall. Each time I have been there, I get walked to the very back of the restaurant with me group. The ordering process takes about 20 minutes or so and the receiving of food takes another 30 minutes on top of the. The times I go, I get the chicken mac and cheese and the bowl that it comes in is not filled all the way. Other Applebee's that I go to gives much larger portions than that. Around me and at my table I hear apologies from the staff regarding the service but the apologies aren't changing anything unfortunately. The times I go, I have gift cards, and sometimes it's not even worth using them at that location. I'd rather drive further away just so I can be served within an hour time frame."
K. B.,"Southfield, MI",0,53,,3.0,12/1/2017,"Now I understand some of the lower ratings.  I was in there again, a few days ago, and was somewhat disappointed in the service I got.  I was in there around 3:30 or so in the afternoon, and there couldn't have been more than 1 or 2 more tables with customers sitting at them; yet, it took my server, whose name I wish I could remember, a good 15 to 20 minutes to bring me a glass of water, after ordering my food, which came 10 to 15 minutes after that.  No doubt, she was nice enough, and apologized for the delay, but that's no excuse for inefficiency, especially when the place isn't crowded.  I had the full rack of baby back ribs, mashed sweet potatoes with pecans and maple syrup, and some buttered, steamed broccoli.  The food was delicious, and the server was actually nice, which is why I left a tip, and didn't lower my rating anymore than I did.  However, inefficient service, when the place isn't even crowded, is the reason I doubt if I'll be coming back again any time soon."
Keith N.,"Wayne, MI",47,2,,1.0,6/15/2017,This is one of the worst Applebees my wife and I have gone to. We went for lunch and were passed by the waitress a dozen times. When asked if we could order it wasn't even our waitress. We didn't order and got up and left. On our way out the hostess (who had just sat us 15 minutes ago) had no idea where we were sitting when we told her that we were leaving for lack of service. It's pretty clear that our skin color was a factor.
Rhonda G.,"Charlotte, NC",66,1,,1.0,3/4/2017,"If I could give this less than 1 star I would. I'm sitting here right now. I have waited 30 min for a beer that was poured eventually by the manager and that came out with lipstick on it, I received 1/2 my food order, I have seen the manager ignore me several times and I am absolutely appalled by this service. My server was actually the only good thing in this establishment. I'm still waiting for my check! Absolutely the worst place I have ever been in for a dining experience and would never recommend this to anyone!"
Tam G.,"Raleigh, NC",0,18,2,1.0,1/13/2017,Absolutely horrible.  Had a party of 10 and seriously waited 2 hours for food.  Got here at 6:30 and didn't get our order taken until 7:30 and still no food at 8:30.  Some of the party got their food others did not.  Very disjointed service and would not visit this location again.
Amy H.,"Ferndale, MI",532,208,221,1.0,3/10/2015,"My experience was unpleasant because 1) the service was extremely slow and bad, 2) my food tasted bad, 3) my food was cold.  First, the service was paiiinfullyyy slow and bad! We must have waited 10 minutes to order, then 30 minutes for our food to come out. Also, our server Deshawn did not seem to know about the Yelp check-in offer and thought we had to be sitting AT the bar to get the free bar snack. Not true, we insisted so he checked and we were right. There seemed to be A LOT of servers compared to customers, yet our server always seemed to be somewhere else. And if you're going to advertise and run specials for checking in on social media, the servers need to be knowledgeable about them, not seem like it's the first time they heard of them.  Second, my food tasted like I tried to cook and failed. I had the healthy under 600 calorie Steakhouse Bruschetta Sirloin with a side of roasted potatoes. Potatoes tasted like nothing, and the steak was tough and not seasoned well. And my dish looked nothing like their photo. Same for the BF's Mac and cheese entree...it was tiny and cold.  Third, my food was COLD. Deshawn passed by our table several times as we looked at him, expecting him to tell us why our food was so delayed. He said our food would be out ""shortly."" It wasn't, and when it came out it was COLD. I would have sent my food back, but I didn't want to WAIT ANY LONGER. I ate part of it and left still hungry. Not worth the $13.99.  I went to Baskin Robbins and got their flavor of the month SNACKNADO and felt better. This was one of my worst dining experiences in a long time."
Bianca K.,"Southfield, MI",0,3,9,1.0,6/8/2017,"The worst service I've ever had. Our waitress was nice, but I was assuming she was new. Didn't offer us a drink when we came in, didn't introduce herself, just went straight to what we wanted to eat. Our food came out pretty quick, but we didn't even have silverware. The waitress told me she'd bring me back some forks.... 5 minutes passed and still nothing. The manager walked over & immediately knew we didn't have silverware so he was kind and brought some over. My food was gross but I sucked it up. Our waitress brought our check out not even 10 mins after getting our food... Overall, I was disappointed and will not be returning."
Kim C.,"Southfield, MI",0,12,5,2.0,10/20/2016,"This location promotes online and at the location that they have Carside to go. However, I ordered online yesterday for Carside to go, pulled up, waited about 10 minutes (two employee's kept looking out the door). Finally, one of the employees came out and said that they don't do Carside service after dark.  Carside to go should not be promoted if they are not going to use the service."
Erika D.,"Southfield, MI",9,11,34,1.0,4/2/2017,"I WILL NOT BE GOING TO THE SOUTHFIELD LOCATION ANYMORE!!! WE DIDN'T EVEN GET TO EAT!!! There were lemons on the floor in the bar area, floors were dirty and dirty napkins on the floor as well. My nephew and I were not even greeted and After 10 minutes, I had to announce myself! Mind you, there were other people waiting like I was. There were alot of empty tables though and the staff was running around aimlessly. They were were very unorganized! For example, two of the customers got seated before me when I was there first! And yes! I did speak to the manager and she apologized, but nothing more was done. Once we were seated, which was right after (I let them know I was there first and they apologized), the tablet that we're suppose to order from was BROKEN and the waitress stated that they didn't have anymore left---REALLY?! From there I left and will not be going back to the Southfield location anymore. I've always had a good experience until now...I will not be going back to that location again."
Ly P.,"Royal Oak, MI",3,8,,1.0,2/5/2016,"Service is horrible, it's slow!! They weren't rude, just seemed to have no vested interest in ensuring that we had a positive experience. She never refilled our waters, or even brought waters to the table until we asked for it. And i know dealing with customers all day can be very tiring but at least be attentive. I am not asking to be your friend while I am their but how do you expect to get tipped if you can't even check on our table and refill waters, or made sure our orders came out right. The only time when we did see our server was when she took our food order, checked on us because it took about 30 minutes to get our food and our bill. This is not my first time here but this time particularly was just an awful experience. If I ever do come back I am gonna ask for a different server.  As for the food I had the fiesta chicken chopped salad, It was NOT up to par!!! I hate sending things back because i feel bad and food is food. But this salad had the wrong ingredients, they put a lot of nuts in the salad which is not supposed to have any, barely any ingredients of which was listed on the menu and they forgot the chicken. When the chicken came out it was not the chimichurri glazed chicken that was supposed to be on it but pretty much just slathered in oil. I pretty much paid for lettuce, nuts and chicken...."
Mike M.,"Detroit, MI",14,11,8,2.0,3/19/2017,"I get that you don't expect a five star dining experience from a chain restaurant, but shouldn't they at least take pride in a job well done? On my recent visit the only thing well done was the steak in my mom's salad (and no it wasn't supposed to be). From standing at the front for 10 minutes waiting to be seated in a half filled restaurant while server after server tells us someone will be with us shortly, to the host attempting to seat our party of four at a table with 3 chairs (wrong table number), to our thirty minute wait... for silverware. 30 minutes. For a fork. Enjoyable experience indeed. Of course our order got screwed up beyond the rubbery steak on the aforementioned salad. We were given the wrong type wings with the appetizer combo, which came out ten minutes before the silverware. Was supposed to get blue cheese dressing and was given ranch. When they did bring the correct wings they put it on our bill as a seperate appetizer. Three out of our four were satisfied with the entrees which is why I gave two stars. It seems there was a lot of new staff, I hope that was the problem. But if you can go to a different location I suggest you do so."
Samantha P.,"New Baltimore, MI",9,8,,1.0,11/7/2015,"I don't need to explain why this place is awful. Took 30 min to get service, have had at least 6 waitresses already, manager had To take out order, Didn't even get that right. And we are still waiting for our food... AWFUL SERVICE.  To add, our waitress was listening to music with her headphones in...has taken 15 min to get a bill."
Clarissa C.,"Oak Park, MI",0,4,1,1.0,2/20/2017,"It's a shame because I have always like the food at Applebee's. But bad service and bad  management will cause me not to patronize an establishment.  On Sunday 02/19/2017 at approximately 4:30pm (dinnertime), a friend and I went to the Applebee's on Southfield Rd.  We were told there would be a 15-20 minute wait because there were no tables available.  Someone waiting commented how could that be true when we were looking at empty tables all over the place.  Then we were told it was a shift change and we had to wait until the new servers and bussers came in.  We were looking at tables that were clean.  Initially I thought there were only 4 to 5 parties a head of us.  I asked to speak to the manager.  The manager Chris Chapman came over and apologized for the wait, she said her server had not come in so she was shorthanded. It would be another 15 minutes.  There was no sense of urgency from her or the staff to accommodate the customers that were there creating a safety hazard standing in front of the doors. Eventually a server came in and people began to be seated, turns out there were parties waiting in the bar area to be seated also, so we were about 7th in line. Everyone was seated in the area that they claimed needed to be bussed.(I took pictures of the tables that were already cleaned off). The only positive was that when the server did arrive she was very polite and apologized for the wait.  We asked for a complimentary appetizer and the manager did agree to that. I just wonder why we had to ask. I think even managers need better training and better skill at how to schedule shifts for overlap especially at dinner time.  I will not be back anytime soon, I know these establishments have a high turnover in managers so hopefully Applebee's will require more of their managers in the future."
Becky W.,"Oak Park, MI",0,2,,1.0,2/17/2017,"We went to Applebee's on 2/17/17. There was only 2 of us and we arrived around 7:30. We ordered appetizers and a hamburger with fries. It took over 25 minutes to get our food which came out cold. My burger came out without onion, tomato and lettuce which took another 8 minutes to get. By the time I ate my burger it was cold. We talked to a manager who barely apologized for the wait and told us she would comp a dessert. When we ordered our dessert it took another 15 minutes to get. We will never return to this location. Not only were we extremely unsatisfied with service and management, but 2 other tables around us left whole meals on their table. In addition we got our bill and wanted to split it down the middle. When our cards were charged it was the incorrect amount which meant our charge had to be voided and we had to wait ANOTHER 10 minutes."
Jay B.,"Southfield, MI",0,6,1,2.0,9/23/2015,"Another disappointment for the city of Southfield! Let's start with AppleBees as a franchise. The so called ""neighborhood bar & grill"", welcome to Southfield, glad you could find our city of 70k on the map and decide to bless us with your services! I went skiing a few years ago near Petoskey, Michigan, population about 5k and guess what? They had a AppleBees way before Southfield! Now let's talk about your Southfield implementation. If you know it or know the land where AppleBees is located has been topic of conversation for many, many years. After Catholic Church closed the school once located there, many developers attempted to acquire that location. Most note able was WalMart which was met with huge community out cry for many reasons. Fast forward AppleBees is now on the site of the intersection that has been ranked in top three for accidents for whole state of Michigan for a decade.   Now to the venue.  Way smaller then any other AppleBees I have visited and some sort of new layout configuration that is just not working for me! Restaurant just did not seem to have a good flow or separation of bar and family patrons. However this issue is not a show stopper! I was looking for a venue to take the spot of the Friday's on evergreen and could be a Friday hangout for co-workers but and also serve as a nice spot to bring the family.  Service is horrible, it's slow and unapologetic! They weren't rude, just seemed to have no vested interest in ensuring that we had a positive experience.   Our waitress was young, very green and not well trained.  We witness her frequently joking and talking to other employees vs checking on us.  We ordered happy hour specials.  When food was brought out by a different waitress, there was two too many plates. We explained that the extra food was not ours to which we were too, ""well you can have them anyway!"" Normally who does not enjoy a good hook up! But us eating that food, meant someone who actually ordered it had to wait another 20 mins to get their food.   That was pretty much the theme of the night as we were met with employee after employee that just did not seem to care about controlling their environment, either via company cost or customer experience. I've visited AppleBees a couple more time since and while it does not reach the craziness of Friday's and turn into a night club, it does nothing to separate itself in regards to quality food and service.  It's mediocre at best! I prefer the Novi or Livonia or this one!  Location wise, it's not located near anything that would complement a evening out with your wife or girlfriend.  It's about 3 miles from the movie theater. Southfield road is not know for nightlife so good luck if your going to make a night of if starting at ApplesBees!  They will be there for awhile cause again the Southfield city planner sucks so our options are limited!"
Cynthia P.,"Southfield, MI",0,12,,1.0,10/18/2015,"Don't order a mixed drink! The bartender lied to my husband and I about the type of liquor that he used in our drink...all generic! He told us that he used top-shelf (another bartender showed us the generic bottles)  The management allows teenagers to sit in the bar area (unsupervised), I thought that was against the law!"
Lawrence A.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",36,10,1,1.0,10/2/2015,"I attempted to get carry out service here today, only to leave hungry and frustrated after waiting about 1/2 hour after placing my order, only to be asked for the 2nd time if I had placed my order yet.  I am not sure what the problem is, since this  Applebee's has a regular carry out service. I placed my order on the phone and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. Nearly 30 minutes later, waiting patiently in the restaurant, I asked about the status of my order a 2nd time, with the response from waitress of ""have you place your order already?"". I am not one to write reviews often, but I would like to spare others from such an annoying experience."
Pamela S.,"Southfield, MI",0,3,,5.0,8/24/2016,"I'm quick to write a bad review but will write a good one too. After 3 consecutive horrible visits I took a chance and went again. I  could not believe the exceptional service we got on Monday night. DeLon was the bartender, greeted us right away. She was polite and attentive and kept all her customers at the bar engaged. Our order was served promptly, was fresh and very good. Hopefully things are turning around for this place.  I will go there again but only if DeLon is working . They will have to prove to me this wasn't just a fluke."
Kim B.,"Hollywood, FL",122,10,53,1.0,6/14/2015,"You can skip this place! Only plus was that our server Chris (female) was very friendly & attentive,  aside from that... 1) presentation of the food was less than appealing 2) taste matched the appearance of the food"
Jas Q.,"Oak Park, MI",0,25,6,1.0,12/2/2015,"I've been to this location about 3 times. Service was just okay the first 2 times. The last visit left a bad taste in my mouth. About 3 weeks ago my boyfriend's uncle came from Florida to visit, due to our work schedules we were only available to all go to dinner once. I stay in the Southfield area so this location is about 5 minutes from our house. We decided to go Nov 15, 2015 around 8 p.m. We arrived and were seated immediately, I really can't remember the host much, I think we were her last table to seat and possibly clock out time. About 5 minutes later our waitress came to our table to take our drink orders, 2 waters and 1 sweet tea. About 10 minutes later we received our drinks, with melted down ice like it was sitting and also unsweetened tea. My question is why did it take 10 minutes if we were her only table? No big deal, we went ahead and ordered two appetizers. 20 minutes later we received cold boneless wings with cold sauce thrown on top and cold chewy cheese sticks. My boyfriend's uncle pulled out his silverware which had a dried piece of rice still stuck to it. Eww! So we got our waitress and showed her the cold food, also the dirty silverware. She didn't bother to replace or take away the dirty silverware. She just took the food back, possibly irritated. She then came back 5 minutes later with kind of warm food, not hot like they just came out. Not hot like we were her only table. We started to question what she was doing in the back. She wasn't attentive to us and kept giving us cold food. So we recieved the entrees, two cold 4-cheese mac with honey pepper chicken and a salmon meal. The pastas were lacking the garlic bread that is included. The food looked dry, so they asked for more sauce because you could see bare noodles. The waitress came back with a cup of cold sauce for the pasta. At this point we are still hungry and upset. Nothing was good, she couldn't get a glass of ice water.  We just complained and asked for the bill. Most resturants will have the manager come out to address the problem and waiver the meal. The food was barely touched! It's not like we just had the feast of our lives. She came back and reduced our bill by $5, why if we didn't eat it. So we asked for the manager, a few minutes go by the night shift manager pops up with a fake smile. We knew that the waitress was bad talking us in the back, I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't get a taste of someones spit in the back. We showed her all the uneaten food and also the dirty silverware, she acted so shocked but writing this review I see other similar complaints. She dashed to the back and took another $5 off the bill. A few minutes after the waitress came to clean off the table. No one offered to replace it, by this point we didn't even want anything from them. Even on a good day the service is just bad and unprofessional. The waitress got the last plate and said ""Y'all just came for the hot food and the drinks"". I had to excuse myself and go outside, I was about to go off and I'm sure security would have been called. Point One we didn't even get hot or even warm food, Point Two our drinks were melted with ice before we even got it. She basically called us bums, my boyfriend still tipped and left with the receipt and all.  I wrote an email to Applebee's that Monday, I was called on Thursday from the general manager. I told him the story and he sounded shocked, and that he wanted us to give it another try and that a gift certificate would be mailed. 3 weeks later and still nothing, because he didn't send it. As I said I live 5 minutes away, mail from China came before this gift card. They will never get another $1 from me....Ever! Sad, its a newer location but it seems like no one was trained. I know they were trained at the Novi location, it's just being lazy. Be nice, have good food and no problems. Instead we were treated like we weren't wanted from the door."
M.K P.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",0,3,,3.0,6/12/2016,"Went here with high expectations, as we have been at multiple Applebee's. My Chicken Tender basket was great,service&Manager super kind. Food from Dad&Mum was'nt good. Portions were way too small for the price, Food descriptions irritating,as they state spinach in the Menu, with only getting 3 leafs. Also,the steaks werent spiced,while my youngest sisters Club sandwich had way too much spice on it."
Evan K.,"Southfield, MI",148,7,,3.0,5/26/2016,"Not a bad place to catch a game and hang out. Bartenders are super friendly and make stiff drinks. Standard Applebee's food and decent waitstaff. Definitely sit at the bar if you can and they will take much better care of you. I live down the street, so I come here for the drink specials and cheap appetizers."
