Ross H.,"Detroit, MI",155,35,4,1.0,1/10/2015,"So I am ending my Daddy and daughter day.....""Daddy let's go there I wanna try their food!""  Sure as a dad would do we pulled into the APPLEBEE's of Southfield on Southfield road.   My daughter and I step in and it is semi busy but looks like they have enough staff to handle the flow.  3:23pm we are seated.. the nice hostess gives us our menus and flat ware. tic toc tic toc tic toc 3:52 ""Daddy were is our server?""  This is after she and I had completed coloring the kids menu.   ""I am not sure baby girl, put your coat on and let's go.""    Yes folks we did not even get a water or a pop or a ""Hey I am your server and I will be with you in a few."" Excuse me, who is your manager?""MIKE""   So mike I did not feel like talking to you or any other Manager on Duty.  You have a whole lot of servers and cleaners doing nothing.  Way to many tables there that were dirty or the floor underneath was dirty.  In your next team meeting let your staff know.   If you give great attention to the little things for costumers they would get better tips and you would not have folks walking out on your service. Really this place needs a ZERO star."
Fa N.,"Southfield, MI",0,1,,1.0,4/17/2016,Horrible service no stars didn't get orders takke.

Jessica A.,"Oak Park, MI",29,3,2,3.0,11/2/2015,The host didn't seem like she wanted to be there...our server forgot about us but it was just a mistake.Dominque was super nice and friendly and attentive.she has a really pretty smile.our food came pretty quick.the only issue was them forgetting about us considering how slow it was. Oh yes the happy birthday song was   aunt was very embarrassed.
Joe E.,"Southfield, MI",0,11,2,2.0,12/7/2014,"I was very happy to have an Applebee's open up in our neighborhood to give us a choice instead of just the coney's in the area for something later at night.  I am a local truck driver and work 12 to 14 hours a day 6 days a week so as you can imagine it can be hard to find a place to have dinner with my wife. We arrived at 12:30am.  The kitchen closes at 1am and the place closes at 2am.  We were greeted promptly and seated near the bar and our server Nakia T was almost waiting at the table with menus and a big smile.  She took our drink orders and left us to choose from the menu.  When she returned with our drinks she asked if we had any questions and then took our order.  My wife ordered the Riblets and I ordered the Double Barrel Whiskey steaks.  The drinks were excellent, I had a Sidecar and my wife had the Perfect Sangria Margarita. Our meals came and both were done well, as ordered and very tasty.  I really couldn't ask for much more. And now to the reason for only a two star review.  About halfway through our meal some of the staff got off work and sat at the bar right next to us.  They were soon talking and joking with the bartenders and each other and the noise level kept going up.  Soon they were almost yelling and my wife and I couldn't even hear each other or the server.  I told our server how uncomfortable it was getting and asked if she could do something about it.  It wasn't till I told her I needed my check because it had gotten so bad I just wanted to leave that she went over and asked them to quiet down.  One of the staff turned and apologized, but seriously by that time my mood was ruined."
Robyn L.,"Sterling Heights, MI",1,19,3,1.0,12/3/2014,"First thing the waitress said was ""I can start you with some drinks but our Kitchen is extremely backed up and the food may take a while."" I should have left the moment she said that! Applebee's has never been my favorite place but this is a new location and worth a try... A try that failed. We were in here for 2 hours our Chips and Salsa appetizer was mainly chips from 'the bottom of the bag' all broken pieces, our food took forever and we felt ill after we left! I will not be returning... Bad service, Bad Food and Slow as Molasses!"
Tani T.,"Southfield, MI",33,9,,1.0,9/9/2016,"I have been to this location several times and received terrible service every time I was not at the bar, but after today I will not be back. They missed the simplest order at our table, but it took the waitress ten minutes to come back to ask if we were ok. After telling her about the missing order, it took an additional 15 minutes to get the missing item. Meanwhile, as everyone else at our table waited, our food was cold by the time we received it. I complained to someone who seemed like the manager, and was offered 10% off. Got the bill back and it was 10% off my one entree, I guess because I was the complainer. I wish I could give zero stars. We'll never be back, this was not the first bad experience and I'm sure it won't be the last. No thanks."
Sharon H.,"Southfield, MI",3,26,1,4.0,4/15/2016,"We were honestly leery about trying this Applebee's fairly new in our neighborhood. We've waited almost a year due to all the poor reviews...food, service, wait time, etc etc. well, either things have settled down or changes have been instituted, we went this Thursday for dinner.Alexis, our waitress was great, informative, brought us a few beer samples, very friendly and helpful. I tried the D Tea  (using Detroit made vodka and Gin). OK, but pricey $7.00.  My husband had steak,fried onions ,roasted potatoes. Steak was undercooked, returned with cheerful attitude and brought back just perfect, very tasty, and an abundance of potatoes.  I tried Tai shrimp salad, also tasty, at least a dozen small  grilled shrimp. Alexis had sauces served on the side as I was concerned about too spicy. Could have used more almonds and wontons, but abundance of lettuce. We were relieved, will probably stop by again some time."
Andrew C.,"Windsor, Canada",13,33,,1.0,1/28/2015,"Forgot to mention: We observed a waitress walking towards a nearby service station, and she noticed a crumpled napkin on the ground. She tries to kick it along to the station, but by doing so, drops a ramekin of sauce all over the floor.  She then returns to half-assed mop up the sauce, but leaves the original napkin. Honestly, if you want comedy, a long wait and terrible food, this spot's for you!"
Megan Z.,"Berkley, MI",0,10,,2.0,9/5/2016,"Gave this location two tries - won't be coming back. Staff was friendly enough, but SLOW. Took about a half hour for our apps to come out, and when they did, they had clearly been sitting in the window for a long time (buffalo sauce was dried up, ranch was hot..). No thanks..."
Will A.,"Saint Joseph, MI",101,67,2,1.0,1/15/2016,"Awful service. Never got a napkin. Incompetent waiter. Messed up the orders, were out of items, and forced us out. Food/kitchen was fine, everything else was ridiculous."
John Mark S.,"Troy, MI",21,30,29,3.0,5/4/2015,Not a huge fan of Apple Bees but we decided to go to Military Monday which is a generous 30% off the bill.  When we got there the music was a little loud for the families that were there. A little dirty...maybe it was just busy. We had a very nice waitress. A little confused about changing our order after it was put into the system. She gave us $2 off for our trouble. Average restaurant  plus open until 2 am.
J M.,"Southfield, MI",0,11,,1.0,11/10/2015,I've been to this location about 4 times and I have to say the customer service is absolutely terrible!!! The food is OK but the service is really bad. I understand that people have bad days but for me to have been there on 4 separate occasions dealing with 4 different waiters and the service was bad all those time is not just someone having a bad day it's just the service there!
Julian B.,"Southfield, MI",109,123,794,3.0,12/1/2014,Great service from David. My mom askd a million questions. Food was good. I got a burger and mom got the lunch shrimp pasta deal. Burger and fries were both tasty. I added Onion strings to a regular burger. Only complaint was both the burger and fries were lukewarm. Tasted some of her Caesar salad. Solid. Pasta dish looked unappealing.  I may make this an occassional spot for drinks and catch some of the game since there are tvs all around. Menu leaves much to be desired like many of these chains. Great happy hour specials on food and drinks. Very fair drink prices. Perfect sangria margarita was a star. Will be back for that. There were a couple other snafus but I let it slide since they just opened.
Paula W.,"Royal Oak, MI",133,2,,1.0,10/15/2015,"It's a Thursday night and I'm pumped to get those 1/2 off apps... I was completely turned off by this particular Applebee's as soon as I walked in the door. First off, since there was no ""wait to be seated"" sign OR a hostess present at the door, bae and I decided to seat ourselves. We were then literally scolded by an employee for seating ourselves in the bar area. From then on I felt really uncomfortable. Another waitress came by with menus. I asked her what the drink specials were, and with slight attitude she set a drink menu in my face not saying a word. I then told her we would need a few minutes to order. When she came back to take our orders she literally stood at our table and stared until we said something... What.. Who does that? This was just all too much for me so we canceled our order and left. Such a shame because the interior is pretty nice."
Sharon S.,"Southfield, MI",0,2,,2.0,7/19/2015,Just ok. Will choose another Apple Bee's next time. Paid too much to have just ok service.
Veronica M.,"Grand Prairie, TX",31,27,129,4.0,3/7/2015,"We came to celebrate my oldest 22nd bday n we ordered 3 for $12 app n 2 for $25 dinners. It ended up being a lot of food, I couldn't eat my entrée n had to take it home. The service was excellent from Armonni, we really appreciate her. She was very courteous n when we had a few mistakes on our order she quickly handled our issues. Then the staff sang happy bday to Kari. My family had a good nite at Applebee's"
Rhonda L.,"Southfield, MI",26,28,2,1.0,6/23/2015,"We walked in to hear the jukebox at full volume. We were greeted by the hostess who told us we had to sit at a table because the next waitress only served tables - not booths!!! We ordered the Mac and Cheese and were able to drink 2 full glasses of pop before it was served.  The food was cold and the 'single' breadstick was still half frozen. We consumed what we could, paid our bill and walked past the hostess station without even receiving a 'have a nice night' because they were to busy chatting with each other to acknowledge our existence!!"
Sandra N.,"Redford Charter Township, MI",0,2,,1.0,8/3/2015,"I am a happy frequenter to Applebees! I was all too happy to pick up lunch today for myself and a coworker at this new location near my work!! I ordered our take out from the bar because the carry out server at curbside  was overwhelmed with 2 customers, obviously 2 too many. The bartendar was very friendly & very professional !! As I  was  waiting for our salads I noticed 2 employees sitting in a booth chit chatting not paying attention to anything going on around them. When asked by another employee if they were keeping an eye on the front door, both nodded their head without even looking up. They were not paying attention to anything, but each other, DEFINITELY NOT THE FRONT DOOR! After returning to work we attempted  our late lunch. The salads were wilted and basically bare of any toppings that were expected to be on it. We both tossed them and chalked it up as a 1st & last time visit to this location.  Id rather go without than spend another waisted shiny penny at this location.!!  The bartendar seems to be the only asset for this location."
Sekoya B.,"Southfield, MI",0,7,18,5.0,12/13/2015,"I love this Applebee's! They always take good care of me when I come here! The drinks and food are good! Everyone is friendly and attentive. I usually sit at the bar, but even when I sit at a table, the service is great!"
David G.,"Southfield, MI",0,48,1,1.0,8/15/2015,If you like blaring music at the bar and a staff that disapears this is your kind of place. The server didnt know how to ring up the 3 for $12 properly so the food came in stages. Then she just vanished into thin air. Had to get someone else to ring us up and get a box. Stay away from the sirloin healthy selection just gross and soggy. Now i know why its called Crapplebees. This was at around 8:30 friday night.
