Michele E.,"Southfield, MI",23,19,3,4.0,1/5/2016,"I was very surprised with how good our experience was! In short, the food was hot and fresh, our waitress was prompt and polite, as was the rest of the staff, and the atmosphere was inviting. We ordered  the meal for 2 and had the boneless wings with spicy Asian sauce...delicious! I had the Fiesta Lime Chicken and my husband had the Bourbon Steak...both very good. We only had one problem which is typical of chain restaurants...we had to send our sons grilled chicken back to have it cooked more. However, once it came back it wasn't overcooked and was very tasty. My husband and I usually stay away from chain restaurants but we'll definitely visit this Applebee's again."
Carlos P.,"Detroit, MI",0,1,,1.0,6/2/2016,"Worse service ever, they got my order wrong 5 times, when I complain to the management he had an attitude and say this happens a lot, and didn't even say he was sorry. Never going there again"
Latasha T.,"Detroit, MI",0,7,,1.0,5/9/2015,This is my third time coming to this location and it will be my last. All three times I've come to this location the service have been bad. This first time the tables were dirty and my party and I waited over 10 minutes to have our drink orders put in and now one actually acknowledged that we were there. The second time we came back it was bad service again-long waits and the food was cold. The third time we came the hostess wasn't at the door to seat us and when we finally sat down a fill-in took our drink order then the waiter came and told us he would be 2 minutes before he can come and take our order. In the meantime our drinks came out by a fill-in and we wanted to order 2 more  drinks the person didn't even want to take the order. 10 minutes went by and our waiter finally came and that's when I knew I can't come back here. Bad customer service.
Cassandra C.,"Gettysburg, PA",1,2,,1.0,5/15/2015,"Horrible apathetic service and sub par food.  Was at the table for awhile and had to wave down a waitress.  My salad came out by another waitress and we had to ask her where our drinks were and she went and got them.  We had to go and get our straws off of the waitress stand, should have savored it because it was the only drinks we got.  My rib lets were a pile of shredded meat and bones and floppy fries. I will go to the food truck down the street before I ever go back.  Pity because it is a great location."
LA L.,"Southfield, MI",0,3,,5.0,1/22/2017,"My boyfriend and I had stayed away from this location ever since a horrible first experience from 2014 when they first opened. Well, we decided to go last night, and finally give them another chance. I was shocked! From the moment we walked in, we were greeted, sat where we wanted to sit (in the bar area by the TV's) and the waitress came right over. We ordered drinks, appetizers, main courses, and desserts. The food was delicious, and came out fast!! Spent over $100 and will definitely be back, as this location is right around the corner. They are conveniently located, and have an upbeat atmosphere inside the restaurant. If the next visit goes like this visit, we will probably become regulars. Keep up the good work. Oh yeah, our waitresses name was Classy. She was awesome, and so was the hostess. Thank you Applebees for working out the kinks from when you first opened. We appreciate it!!"
Young C.,"Southwest Detroit, Detroit, MI",1,4,2,5.0,12/13/2015,"Me and my girlfriend have been coming here for drinks, food and dessert for a few months and we are addicted to the amazing service and drink specials. I love the feeling of welcome each server has and the amazing drinks."
Carli C.,"Berkley, MI",0,10,,1.0,4/15/2016,"I am beyond shocked this location has survived. As a bartender, I know I want to support the bar. As I sat there, (waiting for cold food to arrive), my bartender continued her cell phone conversation as she took others' orders. She left, as other servers asked far and few between what I needed. She left the building to get someone, returned and threw a fit about her situation, and all I wanted was another beer. THE MANAGER ALLOWED THIS, as if she was afraid of these children. I don't trust the food to be honest. Horrible facility. Oh... I didn't mention that this corporate restaurant shut down an hour early Monday night because ""people were acting up and they were slow."" Manager call"
Deniege B.,"Pinconning, MI",19,7,,1.0,6/7/2015,Poor service. Very slow. Dirty.  Definitely not the normal Applebee's. The waitress never came back to check on us and never got out drinks refilled. Food took a long time to come out. Would never go back to this location.
Sandy V.,"Royal Oak, MI",0,30,,1.0,4/23/2015,"Service was TERRIBLE. We waited 40 minutes after getting our food never to hear from our server. I flagged him down finally, and he took another 20 minutes just to get us our check. The reason he took so long is because he was flirting with EVERY female employee that walked by! It was disgusting and unprofessional. I complained to the manager as I had somewhere to be, and she seemed unconcerned with the issue. Paid, left, will NEVER return."
Stephanie T.,"Warren, MI",79,28,7,1.0,3/5/2015,I don't see this location lasting unless there are some extreme changes.
John Y.,"Ferndale, MI",177,10,1,4.0,9/7/2015,It's a good place to come to they really improved sense the last visit to be honest with myself it well still take time for them to be a five star rating as far service goes
Bryan S.,"Southfield, MI",32,14,6,1.0,12/30/2014,"Where is the negative star button? They gave us an estimated wait of 10 minutes... 33 minutes later we were seated. The waitress messed up our drink order, rarely returned to our table and we ordered a medium 9oz steak which came to our table short a couple of ounces and looked as if a McDonalds employee had cooked it. The steak was completely well done.  This wouldn't have been a problem had she returned to the table but another 20 minuets went by so we decided to just eat it. Will not be returning, this is our second visit out of two that has been a disappointment. Shame."
Andrea S.,"Detroit, MI",11,15,23,2.0,1/4/2015,"I wanted to love this place. I really, really did! It's so conveniently located and open late nights. It was a huge disappointment. Service was slow, food was subpar at best. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger, it was about the size of a regular cheese burger from McDonalds. The prices wouldn't be bad if you got more than a fast food like value meal. Very disappointing...won't be visiting again anytime soon. It gets two stars, merely for location, hours of operation and cleanliness."
Pero R.,"Southfield, MI",0,13,6,1.0,1/21/2015,"I've been in Applebee's many times here in Michigan and Windsor, but never experienced so slow and lousy service. The guy who served us worked as bartender as well. We waited for about 5 minutes for someone to give us the menu and water, additional 10 minutes for drinks and when we finally ordered we waited around 40 minutes for something that the waiter said will take no more than 7 minutes... That guy was nowhere to be found!  We did not want to finish our dinner there and won't be returning for sure."
Evëttë R.,"Royal Oak, MI",148,6,,1.0,1/2/2015,Today 1/2/15 I placed a curb side to go order. First when I placed the order the workers were playing around with the phone trying to snatch the phone from the guy who was taking my order. I was told it would be 15 minutes. Well I got there in 20 minutes and still it was not ready. I waited an additional 5 minutes before leaving. I also left because the workers seemed less than professional.
Diana F.,"Oak Park, MI",1,2,31,1.0,12/17/2014,"First off if i could give this place no stars it would be ZERO. We were very excited about an Applebee's close by. But were very disappointed with the service.  First we get there and we are parents so we are shoved in the back corner by the bathrooms. Our waitress didn't even know to take a drink order before food, was snarky cause when we ordered she didn't ask about what sides and I had the nerve to ask about what kind of poatatoes. She brought out our drinks with the appetizers but left the kids in the back till they brought out their food. And crying thirsty kids is no fun... I never saw her in between once or I would have asked for them. We had to ask twice for refills and then sat over 25mins waiting on the bill. With 3 YOUNG kids. No sorry for the wait nothing. My husband decided to tip her very hefty even after all that. And guess what she her grabbed the bill and money looked down at it, counted it and walked away. No thank you.  No have a good night. SO RUDE! (We know waitresses live off their tips) he still gave her 22% way over what an average tip is.  Do yourself a favor and don't go to this one. The ones further away are worth the drive. There were many people in there tonight complaining. The manager was at 5 different tables on our side alone."
Paula Y.,"Canton, MI",0,1,,1.0,2/7/2015,Horrible service!  Will NEVER go to that location again. Although the manager was accommodating.. the server was horrible. Slow service food and drinks!
Elizabeth T.,"Buckhead, Atlanta, GA",3,69,,1.0,2/21/2016,"Ended up here due to a power outage at our original choice. After a 30 minute wait, our ""waitress"" finally brought our drinks. She was nice enough to offer the water we asked for to go when we finally received our bill. Never again."
Cierra D.,"Detroit, MI",0,2,1,1.0,1/12/2015,"Horrible!! Didn't get our water until being seated for 45 minutes! The waitresses are rude and unprofessional, the manager was walking around eating with her chest tattoos showing (very unprofessional). We finally got our food after 2 hours!!! They didn't apologize for the wait or anything. The bill was incorrect. The only thing I have good to say is the greeter was pleasant. I will not waste my time nor money here again!!!"
Carolyn W.,"Southfield, MI",64,18,16,3.0,5/28/2015,Service had greatly improved since my last time here.  Hopefully it will continue to get even better. It was real bad the first month they were poem. Good luck.
