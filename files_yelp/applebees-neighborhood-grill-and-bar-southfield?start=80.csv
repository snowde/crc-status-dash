Keisha R.,"Southfield, MI",287,13,6,4.0,5/11/2015,"The staff is very friendly and attentive, drinks are good, food is good too.   Welcome to the neighborhood!"
Ben W.,"Southfield, MI",0,1,,1.0,12/22/2015,Every since this place opened the service has been terrible. I came here when it first opened and thought the bad service was just because it was new and they had to get the bugs out but months later the service had gotten worst. The wait staff does not have a clue how to check on the customer and management just runs around handing out discounts on bills for the inconvenience. It's so ridiculous but if you want a free meal or appetizers come here and complain when your food takes 30 minutes to arrive.
Candace W.,"Walled Lake, MI",22,23,2,5.0,2/16/2015,"Even though this is a brand new Applebee's, it's running like a well oiled machine.  We were greeted by a friendly host who immediately sat us. Our bartender, Carlos, was a hoot and gave us great service.  The kitchen manager, Melissa, came out and answered our questions about the new menu, and everything we ordered was cooked to perfection.  I tried the new brisket sliders, new sweet potato fries and the new pot stickers - Applebee's is REALLY improving their menu choices.  We will be back, even though there are closer Applebees to our home."
Sherman G.,"Detroit, MI",2,1,1,3.0,1/27/2015,I was very pleased with the music and wait staff and food quality. The food and drinks came in a timely manner. I still hate that certain appetizers have been taken off the menu and the portions for our food items seemed smaller. I had to request more chips for my artichoke dip since I was given so few. I will return for more delicious food soon.
Liz K.,"Auburn Hills, MI",5,5,1,1.0,6/7/2015,"We were greeted rudely.They ran out of chicken. Food was bad, service was bad, water tasted bad. Just bad."
Steven H.,"Southfield, MI",0,2,,1.0,6/21/2015,"beware,  not a family restaurant.  i took my elderly parents to this newly opened applebee's in southfield michigan and first thing as you open the front door is the blaring music.  so loud i had a hard time communicating to hostess.  not just corporate music but rap music.  should have been a hint to leave but i had a coupon and was determined to try this place because of its tv commercials.  sitting down four menus were placed in front of each of us.  come on applebees four fuckin menus to go through.  we sat for 20 minutes and no one came to our table to ask about drink order but people that were seated after us were taken care of by a waitress.  screw the coupon, tore it in two got up and left. went up to hostesses station and explained why we are  leaving and was laughed at.   never will go to another applebees and will tell others about experience."
Brittney F.,"Downtown Detroit, Detroit, MI",0,7,1,1.0,4/15/2015,"Well... Where to start, I have always been a fan of Applebee's but this location puts the name to shame.  It took our server maybe 15 minutes to come to our table-- so a different server came over to take our drink orders.  The restaurant wasn't that busy but you would have thought that every table had people with how slow everything was.  A hair was found in the grilled cheese, my fries came at the end of our meal and drink refills took a long time.   Overall, very displeased with the service."
Rebecca G.,"San Ramon, CA",0,22,,1.0,12/26/2014,"They have done nothing about the poor service, that tells me they don't give a shit! Its the same complaints, then why is nothing. I'm done. Jasmine, your name, right..........Why don't you stop answering questions, on Yelp, and walk your ass in the place and do something about, this place is a joke"
Marlynn R.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",0,2,,1.0,1/17/2015,We're do i began... Very very poor service not impressed AT ALL! Restaurant wasn't very kept up on.. Didn't get waited on till 15 minutes of me being there.. No sliver wear nor straws with our drinks.  Highly do not recommend coming here. Not happy what so ever! Worst experience of my hole life!!!!
Sue O.,"Novi, MI",2,5,,2.0,12/28/2014,"Our family decided to try this Applebee's that just opened on Southfield Rd and Twelve Mile Rd in Southfield. We walked in during a Lions game and worried it would be too busy. We were seated right away with menus but it took 10 minutes to get our drink order..that's only because the bartender, DJ, came to help us. She said our waitress would be with us shortly. It took 20 minutes for the bartender to come back and take our order because our waitress was too busy to check in with us ever. While we waited, Trevon from the bar came to replenish our drinks. Our food came out about 20 minutes later. It was hot and delicious. The All-In American standard burger was the top choice at our table. I don't think highly of the waitress who was MIA and whom we never met but DJ and Trevon helped us and checked in and impressed us. They were the saving grace for our visit. Had DJ not taken the time to help us, we were ready to walk out. Very nice visit after that. Another complaint was the TVs were way too loud. We could barely hear each other at our table. I get that the football game was on but when that ended, the Simpson's came on. Not what I want to hear at dinner on a Sunday night. Also, for the complaints we had, the manager never stopped by to check in with us though the placard on the table said the manager stops by or you get a $5 certificate. We got neither. DJ and Trevon are definitely assets to your company. The rest of the staff needs some work and customer service training."
Kee W.,"Southfield, MI",0,1,,2.0,12/6/2014,"The service is horrible, I was very excited that Applebee's was moving to the neighborhood.  However the Southfield location has quickly changed my mind. Extremely disappointed"
Regina F.,"Southfield, MI",0,4,,4.0,7/24/2015,The boneless wings with the Asian sauce were very good. Both entrees were served in good time and hot. Employees were very attentive. Our waitress name Rae was very nice.
Stephen E.,"Oak Park, MI",0,5,,1.0,11/21/2015,"The service was atrocious.  Went for lunch. Couldn't have been more then 7 people in the place. It took 10 minutes after I was seated to have a waitress come up and take a drink order and then not return at all.  Manager took my order and when I asked what was to soup of the day, he said he would check and never returned. Another 10 minutes and the waitress returned with my drink and told me the soups. I told her what I wanted and she didn't come back.  Several minutes later some one else dropped of my soup.  After I was done the manager wanted to know how things were going. I told him that the waitress never returned with my salad.  He said he would get her at it was at least 10 minutes before she brought my salad, with no dressing or a fork, spoon or knife. I had to get up and find the hostess and get eating utensils. She said she would get me salad dressing and never returned. I got up again and asked another waitress to please get me the dressing and she did. My waitress came back and dropped off the bill and she never came back to cash me out. I had to find the hostess again to make change for me. First time in years I didn't leave a tip."
Zachary S.,"Berkley, MI",35,17,,3.0,3/1/2015,"The food and atmosphere here is pretty good. Our waitress made a few mistakes, like incorrectly calculating our bill total, but she checked on us several times; we never had to ask for napkins or refills. The service was definitely not as bad as other are claiming, but I did notice a customer who was NOT happy and demanded a manager. We ordered an appetizer deal where we were able to build a sampler with 5 choices for $16. All of it was good and the 2 of us had leftovers for home. I will be back, but the place has some clear room for improvement."
Frank L.,"Troy, MI",0,1,,3.0,12/24/2014,"Hello, I have decided to try Applebee's for a second time within the last six day. I was greeted by a host by the name of Stacey. She had a warm a friendly greeting and a smile. She walked me and my mother to our table and explained to us the specials for today. Our server name was Whitney. I can tell she had a poor attitude when she came to the table. She was not enthused about waiting on us. Then I saw the manager Tim and asked him to wait on us. He made sure our food came out the way we liked it. We left Whitney a 10% tip. We wanted to tip Tim the Manager, but he refused. He stated that it was his pleasure to take care of us and gave 2 five dollar off cards and asked us to come back. Whitney has a poor attitude and needs to be trained in customer service."
Yana V.,"Berkley, MI",0,5,,1.0,4/9/2015,"Me and my family were really excited to see Applebees open up near by.  Decided to go for dinner and check it out.  What a zoo! Right hand doesn't know what the left is doing.  After waiting for 20 min for a table, we finally were seated.  The waitress informed us that its busy and there will be a wait for food.  At that time we should have gotten up and left.  Ordered drinks and it took 30 min for them to get to us. By that time i was irritable and kids were starving.  There was a table in front of us who arrived later and got their food and drinks before us.  It was really disappointing!  I had asked to speak to the manager.  He came by and thought all of this was a funny joke.  There was no reassurance from him nor any remorse.  At that time i got up, said that's it we are leaving, while the staff looked surprised( like, why??? what did we do?).  To top all that off, after waiting for a table and drinks and food for over 1.5hrs, they handed me a bill for two drinks( which i paid).  What a shame.  Real management needs to step in and get these issues resolved.  This location will be closed if somethings don't change."
Keri N.,"Southfield, MI",0,2,,1.0,3/19/2015,"This place would definitely get - 5 stars for there services. Feb 22nd I ordered curb side service. I had a long day at work. When I got home,  just as i was about to take a bite of my house salad, what do i see poking out?  A very long black hair!!!! It was wrapped all in the salad. So I called told them to give me my money back for the salad and the person on the phone said to me that these things happen. It should not happen.. your running a kitchen wear hair nets. All I asked for was my $3.45 they said no we are going to do better we are going to send you a gift card, you should recieve it in a fews days. A week goes by I called oh yeah we sent it yesterday another week goes another week goes by I get the manger Mike involved and he says he will make sure that I get my gift card and to make sure that I call him by mid week and let him know if i got it. Mid week comes called Mike back still no gift card and no Mike. Left my # Mike didn't call me back. Called Mike on Friday he asked me to go to the restaurant to pick up the card. I was told one was mailed to me and that's how i want to recieve it. It's not about the gift card its about principle if you say you are going to do something then do it, don't lie to your customer.. If you can't deliver good service then this is not your field of business. Guess what today is March 19th still no gift card!!!! So if they say we are giving you a gift card just say yeah right and get your money back!!! Just lost another customer.... You have kids running the place."
