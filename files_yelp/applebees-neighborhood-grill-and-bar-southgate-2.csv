Sherrie P.,"Southgate, MI",29,2,,5.0,1/7/2018,Applebee's the to go place birthdays holidays out with friends coworkers are your lovey-dovey sweetie pie
Lydia M.,"Southgate, MI",20,11,5,4.0,12/16/2017,Juan tacos were very good service was slow so I'm pretty sure it's because they were very busy
Vicki I.,"Allen Park, MI",21,12,3,3.0,11/18/2017,"Food was good, Service was good but about what you would expect. American casual chain restaurant."
Zach R.,"Lincoln Park, MI",44,3,,1.0,8/17/2017,"Garbage. The wait staff is terrible. Our orders were wrong, and the food...shit. I've nicknamed this one CRAPPLEBEES."
Rodrigo T.,"Lincoln Park, MI",323,790,2216,4.0,11/1/2015,"Welcome to your friendly neighborhood applebees, situated right on the corner of Trenton Rd and Eureeka. It's on a prime location where most of the friends/family gathering chain restaurants are located. A few steps away is a theatre,, you know what that means??? Perfect for date night... DINNER AND A MOVIE. The king of half prize apps has done it again. It's like a man who finally quit sagging his pants. All grown up, polished and still cool as a bag ice. Aside from the interior face lift and the new yummy items on their appetizer arsenal. There's now local craft beer on tap and good local distillery liquors as well. Atwater, Bells, Kunheign and Valentines to name a few booze names that are making their way into a glass near you. Applebee's has always been the favorite spot for a gathering. Whether it's for an occasion or the start of a boys/girls night out. It's not a hard choice for anybody to pick. The price is right, the drinks get you drunk and the food fills you up. Never a bad experience here at this specific restaurant. The servers are always friendly, attentive and very accomodating. The one of the best amongst all the chain restaurants. Thank you applebees. You guys are truly awesome!!"
Chuck L.,"Monroe, MI",1,6,5,1.0,5/16/2016,"So I dont often complain about a bad restaurant experience, I mean everyone has a bad day, right???  However.... Today the food we got from Applebee's Car Side To Go was just terrible. The Crispy Cheddar Bacon potatoes were just pitiful and hardly anything in the box. The two orders of boneless wings were so dry and over cooked - almost seems like they had gotten cold after being cooked once and they tried to fry them again to heat them up! I could not even stab some of them with a fork! Totally not edible!  The real kick in the teeth..... When I called to speak with the manager, he really didn't seem to care at all! He gave me some rehearsed response on talking to the kitchen staff about quality. After asking several times what he would do to make it right he finally offered to replace the food only if I came back tonight for it.  Not what I wanted to do after a long day and not wanting to throw away over $30 I finally got him to credit my card for the cost of the wings and potatoes.  The rest of the  food was just OK, but was at least edible. ( salad, cheeseburger egg rolls, and pretzel sticks)"
Amanda B.,"Southgate, MI",110,2,2,5.0,5/30/2017,"Great choices on the menu always. Great atmosphere, and kids eat free on Mon, Tuesday, and Wednesday's."
Rose M.,"Detroit, MI",1240,229,635,1.0,7/22/2016,"I ended up having to ask for my order to go since I had work things that came up. I had an appetizer ordered and the chicken cornbread salad. Holly was a good server, I don't fault her. She dropped my appetizer when she was walking up so it ended up having to be remade. I watched a table get sat next to me abut 10-15 mins after I arrived and saw them get their food before me. It was only a salad. And imagine my disappointment when I opened up my salad to see that they forgot to put the chicken on it. Honestly I was very upset. I hadn't eaten all day and I was looking forward to the salad to see it wasn't even made properly. I also noticed the front end manager sitting at the bar and watched the bartender mix two drinks and two workers drinking them. I think they just got off the clock but it wasn't a good look for the service especially since it took so long to make a salad and the place wasn't so busy. It took almost 40 minutes all together and my order was still messed up. Unacceptable. I will not be back."
Stephanie K.,"Trenton, MI",1,1,,5.0,8/13/2017,Calm and refreshing atmosphere. Good lacks at times but usually a pleasant experience.
Summer C.,"Detroit, MI",101,3,,1.0,1/31/2017,"Not a huge applebees fan but this totally disappointed me. Took 20 minutes for bar drinks, and we could see the bartender getting mad every time we re ordered. Food took a while, and when it came we ate it. Most was cold and got sent back. There was about 8 of us and we were cashing out lose to closing time. I'm a server, I get that it's annoying to have people finishing up after close. Probably two minutes after close, while we're we're trying to pay the bills, the entire kitchen staff came out and stared and is, muttering rude comments under their breaths. I really did not appreciate this kind of customer service at all. Will not be back"
Phil S.,"Taylor, MI",28,64,69,1.0,7/15/2016,"If I could give this establishment a zero I would ...first off we took kids out to eat after art fair last night , so our adults were going to order but chose to place our kids order and get their good started first. So we order 2 orders of Mac n cheese with fries for kids pretty simple order right? Well it came out roughly 10 minutes after the adults got our food which was ordered 10 minutes after the original kids order was placed. I received my appetizer and my salad but my wife whom ordered the rest of my 2 for $20 deal didn't get her salad until her entree was brought out . A mear 50 minute wait for a Thursday night in a less than half full .   If the wait wasn't bad enough... My sons fries had a long black hair wrapped around some his fries . We mentioned to our waitress who in turn asked us "" what color is it"" ? We pointed it out to her due to poor lighting and she replied ""wow"" ...that's it wow? No apologies no "" I will get the manager "" no ""I will see if I can get this taken off your bill"" nothing ...no response from her at all just WOW. I wasn't looking for a handout or anything of the sort , an apology or  somewhat concerned response would've been fine. Instead I sat here debating about this review thinking about how my 10 year son had this hair wrapped around his fries .... Needless to say Applebee's in Southgate or anywhere is off my list of restaurants to eat at"
Scott U.,"Downingtown, PA",148,21,15,1.0,12/17/2016,"Horrible experience here today.  My wife found bits of plastic wrap in her French Onion soup, my adult daughter was served cold coffee and 2 out of the 4 water glasses were filthly with green objects floating around.  We cancelled the food we had ordered for lunch and left ASAP.  Waitress was late with our replacement drinks and seemed like she didn't wantto be there either."
Trevor S.,"Allen Park, MI",0,1,,5.0,3/17/2017,Finally!!!! An Applebee's with a friendly environment and good food! I have to pass 3 Applebee's to get to this one but it's worth it! Dustin and Kyra made my birthday really fun! Special thanks to them! 10/10 would recommend.
Brittany B.,"Henderson, NV",2,6,,5.0,6/12/2016,Allysia is my favorite waitress and the ribs are too die for. Ugh so obsessed. Here often! Recommend strawberry lemonade always.
Rick S.,"Livonia, MI",10,85,21,3.0,10/16/2015,"Applebee's is doing some pretty cool drink specials at this location. AWESOME happy hour. In fact, I'm getting happy just thinking about it! We had some appetizers that were pretty solid. This would make an excellent after work stop. I'd give more than 3 stars (should be 3.5, anyway), but we didn't eat...so it's tough to be fair. Menu looked good & there are several things I'll be trying in the future...yes, that means that I'll be coming back!"
Larry V.,"Flat Rock, MI",0,23,,1.0,2/9/2017,"I generally don't mind Applebee's food. It's not fine dining, but it is pretty affordable and there are a lot of options. The problem is this location. Went for dinner and it was not good. I ordered a water and there was something floating in it. Gross!! Would have told this to our waiter but he never came back except to drop off our check. No asking if we wanted dessert, refills, nothing. They were not that busy. No excuse for crappy customer service. I won't be back."
Dennis A.,"Downriver, Detroit, MI",22,6,3,2.0,6/28/2015,This is not the burger I ordered. Try again.  So much for a quick dinner. Oh well! Update: So I guess if the order is wrong it's totally acceptable for the kitchen to scrape very thing off and then reserve the food corrected. IT STILL HAD STUFF STUCK IN THE CHEESE!!!! UNACCEPTABLE!!!!
Anthony L.,"Detroit, MI",1312,122,270,3.0,2/6/2015,"This place is just an adult McDonalds. I don't really like the food and I rarely find myself eating at these chain style restaurants.  This is the type of place that you go to when you're  in South Dakota and it's the only option.  Lol...sorry, but true!"
Jill B.,"Southgate, MI",84,28,2,2.0,3/6/2016,"This Applebee's is terrible. The last 3 times I have come here I have been unhappy with the food and service. The food is typically dried out and/or luke warm. Today we waited 45 minute after ordering to get our food. The waitress lied to my face saying that the kitchen was backed up, however, I watched multiple tables that got seated after us for the food before us. Also, instead of politely apologizing she got very defensive claiming it wasn't her fault when we expressed our concerns.  Sadly this is the last time I'll be back. There is nothing redeeming about this location that will make me want to deal with subpar food and rude workers."
Jacob S.,"Southgate, MI",5,2,,5.0,4/16/2016,Had a great visit here today. Our waiter Kirk was awesome. He was very attentive and on top of everything. Will definitely an for him again.
Jerry P.,"Riverview, MI",0,4,,1.0,3/23/2017,"used to be our go to place years ago,  they changed the menu and went downhill......we havent been back in years and dont plan on it anytime soon......small portions of low quality food.......corporate greed at its best.........."
Matthew G.,"Lincoln Park, MI",0,18,,1.0,2/19/2016,"I wanted to have a nice lunch before heading into work (night shift). I was alone, so I sat at the bar. Ordered the ""shrimp parm sirloin"", the steak was ok & the shrimp was a bit under cooked. The issue was the staff (bar tender). She was friendly, but the topic of conversation she was having with another customer was that a previous customer of hers liked to ""pick his teeth with toenail clippings from his back pocket"" which I found disturbing and extremely GROSS! It's gross enough that someone would DO that, but to have a DETAILED convo about it while I was eating will prevent me from going back."
Dan K.,"Detroit, MI",0,2,,5.0,1/28/2015,"This applebees is the best in the area. Period. Larger portions it seems like, better fresher food and the service is great. Plus no annoyingly loud trivia nights ! Lol Great times and food"
Caroline B.,"Allen Park, MI",52,80,64,5.0,6/28/2014,"As i said, their Carside To Go was excellent. It was on time, accurate, and still very delicious when we got it home. Good job Southgate Applebee's! As always."
Abby M.,"Taylor, MI",32,2,1,5.0,9/20/2015,"Amazing food and wonderful service! My mom and I really enjoyed our food. She had some sort of wrap which she stated ""is the bomb!"". I had the triple bacon burger. It was absolutely to die for! The bacon and cheese were great while the patty was cooked to perfection. Our lovely waitress, Lauren, was very friendly and exciting. She's very enthusiastic about her customers and the food she is serving. If you're in the mood for some great food and service, come out to this Applebee's!"
Lynn G.,"Southgate, MI",0,1,,5.0,4/19/2016,"Awesome restaurant love the new menu and the new atmosphere. Definitely a positive change for them. If you were disappointed before check them out now! The new bar setting is great, they have so many tvs and you can see a tv from anywhere in the bar area!!! Service was friendly and fast. Food was great, I order a steak reluctantly because I have never been a fan but the server pushed it stating they had all new quality steaks. I tried the bourbon steak steak and it was delectable, very lean, very tender."
Kaitlyn J.,"Downriver, Detroit, MI",17,4,1,5.0,3/9/2016,i love this applebees! their steak and potatoes is honestly the best thing on the menu. the staff is always so courteous and make sure that youre taken care of. the appetizers and prices are to die for. if this applebees fails anybody i would be very suprised!
Kate B.,"Monroe, MI",101,737,1207,3.0,6/6/2013,Mai-tai's are lethal here! I ended up staring at the ceiling tiles!  I guess they don't water their booze!
Brian K.,"Wyandotte, MI",3,29,18,2.0,12/31/2014,"Totally bummed that they nixed the queso dip,  three burgers, and the potato twisters. Less food for more money.... won't be coming back."
Josiah W.,"Wyandotte, MI",2,36,,3.0,11/30/2014,"I've been here a few times. Always a slightly-better-than-OK,  3-star experience.  I feel like the cooks really know what they're doing. The food is always great, and there's definitely an understanding of what to do and where to put certain foods on the plate. Lots of flavors. However, the food isn't always the freshest (freezer burned bread sticks, pre-prepped veggies). Proportions could be a bit bigger too for what you pay. Servers consist of mostly young high school and college aged women as most of these kinds of restaurants are. Our server was nice, nothing extraordinary though.  The interior is usually very clean and the atmosphere is very welcoming. Doesn't feel too open that everyone can look at you but also open enough to see what's going on."
Randy S.,"Utica, MI",0,13,,2.0,2/25/2016,Took my mother out to lunch and we were stranded at Applebee's forever.  My mom and I ordered a couple of burgers and it took 40 minutes for them to be delivered to the table.  Upon cutting into them we found that the insides were cooked but cold and the outside was hot from being under a heat lamp.  The quality of food and service has gone downhill at this Applebee's in recent years and I think it shows.
Allison W.,"Southgate, MI",4,14,,4.0,3/24/2015,I have always been a fan of the appatizers at Applebees. My favorites were the potato twisters and sweet and spicy boneless wings but recently their menu has changed quite a bit and sadly my 2 favorite appatizers are no longer available. The service at this location is always great and our to-go orders are never missing anything. I just wish they would go back to the old appatizer menu.
Tom N.,"Trenton, MI",0,3,,2.0,12/16/2015,"Food was fantastic. Service was very sub par. Waited for ever to have our order taken, waited forever for appetizers to come and drinks were served after appetizers. Then entree was out before we could even finish appetizers. Then waited again, forever to get a refill on our drinks. We were here on a Wednesday evening, not super busy either. Compliments to the chef for a good meal, but need to work on service badly."
Chelsea T.,"Southgate, MI",22,4,,1.0,10/11/2015,"Why is it so hard to find a list of the half off appetizers for this particular location? My boyfriend and I chose to dine at Apple Bee's for the 2 for $25 deal along with the half off appetizers after 10. We were very disappointed. First our wanton tacos came with no lime. By the time anyone was around to ask for some, they were already bringing out the rest of our order. Our salads were disgusting. They both consisted of large chunks of the gross yellow unchopped lettuce and very little of the green lettuce that should have been there. I was given the tiniest most useless piece of lemon for my shrimp. Seriously? What's the point of chincing on lemon? Then  our bill came and we noticed we were charged full price for our wanton tacos. We have come to this location in the past and they have always been half off but it wasn't until after we ordered and ate them that we were made aware that they were no longer included. We would've passed and ordered something different had our thoughtless server made any effort to let us know about that when we decided to order an additional appetizer. We will not be returning to this establishment. Next time we decide we want Apple Bee's for dinner, we'll go to McDonald's or a local diner instead and save ourselves the time, money and  frustration."
Chuck H.,"Lincoln Park, MI",46,11,,1.0,6/7/2015,There was food all over the floor and nobody was cleaning up the mess. Bathrooms were messy and the service was bad. Prices are high and will not be back to this location.
Nikki C.,"Detroit, MI",134,348,24,1.0,2/9/2012,"While it was really packed the evening that I went, I checked in on Foursquare and read some of the tips people left about the place. Not good at all. The first complaint from people was the food, next was the service. I should have taken the hint. We didn't have to wait too long, but once we were seated, my mom & I both went with the fish & chips. Simple, right? Oh and we ordered the ""butterfly chips"" as an appetizer. I was looking forward to the yummy sounding dip.  We waited... and waited... and -- oh, here comes the appetizer! Yay!  The server comes by and asks if it's warm enough -- I immediately said ""yes"" because I often want to just enjoy the food and not answer questions all evening. My mom begged to differ. But more importantly -- why did he ask if they were warm enough for us? Is that a normal complaint they get? Had they been sitting unattended for some time before being delivered to us? I thought that was rather suspect.  But nevermind that... what really took the cake was the fact that our meal came immediately after the appetizer hit the table. What?? Who does that??  Our faces asked the same question... the waiter said ""I can take these back and keep them warm"". Umm, NO! Fried fish kept warm = soggy fried fish. No. Nononono. We'll just keep our meals and nibble on the now, really cold butterfly chips.The waiter sensed our issue and directed his manager to our table. We expressed our concerns and he offered us a free dessert shooter. He *should have* offered to comp our appetizer. Because by the time we're done with all that, who has room for dessert?  I ended up taking the hot fudge sundae shooter and my mom went for the cheesecake shooter. Wise choice -- the cheesecake was better.  The service (our waiter) wasn't bad, but the timing sucked and so did the quality of the food.  p.s. A table adjacent to us had big time issues with their food. I overheard their complaints and dialogue with their waiter and manager, too."
Kiyomi C.,"Lincoln Park, MI",19,38,55,5.0,1/4/2014,"Pretty good, received food at a decent time even though they are crowed. Staff really pleasant during food rush"
Alfie W.,"Wyandotte, MI",0,27,2,4.0,4/21/2013,"For a major chain they have decent prices. Food is good, atmosphere is nice to. My favorite thing here is there dessert the blondie yum. The chicken fajita rollup  is good to."
Brenda G.,"Trenton, MI",0,1,,4.0,3/14/2015,"We (2 couples) stopped in for a few drinks and appetizers after attending a sporting event.  Sat at the bar and had the opportunity to be served by Tricia, she said she usually works days but luckily for us she had this shift.  The service, attention and hospitality was the best! She was attentive to all her customers at the bar and never kept us waiting. We are not usually in this area for evening entertainment or dining but would make the trip again after great service like this.  Thanks Tricia!"
Lauren M.,"Riverview, MI",185,38,6,2.0,10/12/2012,"They've just remodeled/ updated so it does look nice. Its a community type restaurant with the nearby cities landmarks pictured on the walls of the entrance. Sports theme inside, plenty of televisions and a good size bar. Clean, friendly, decent priced. However, the food is just that, food. I have a hard time whenever i go finding something to even just ""settle"" on. Spice it up Applebees! I'd be more likely to return if they did."
