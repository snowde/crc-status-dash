Marquis S.,"Stockbridge, GA",74,23,25,2.0,8/24/2017,"This was a so so experience. As far as the ambiance goes, well, it's Applebees.  That being said, it seemed uncharacteristically mundane.  The staff didn't seem all that enthused to be working.   They weren't mean or rude; they just lacked that positive attitude that servers normally possess. The food was blah.  I had the shrimp and bourbon chicken.  Potatoes were the included side item.  The potatoes were over cooked. The chicken was a little tough and the onions weren't properly caramelized.  The presentation was sloppy and our beverages were never refilled.  All in all, it was a tolerable experience."
Paige B.,"Conley, GA",49,2,,1.0,11/25/2017,This is one of the worst Applebee's I have ever visited.  1. The waitresses and management staff were unprofessional looking and acting 2. Our drinks were falsely advertised and in the wrong glassware and took forever to reach our table. 3. When confronted about the drink problem we were given 3 different stories as to why they were using the smaller glassware that was actually plastic and ALL were LIES!! 4. We NEVER received our appetizers or drink refills and the restaurant was not even half full of customers. 5. The manager didn't wanna come to our table to correct the problem right way when we saw our waitress tell him we asked for him. I will NOT be visiting this Applebee's anytime soon if ever again.
Jayda J.,"Columbus, GA",153,3,,2.0,12/5/2017,"Came in on a business lunch, first our server forgot to get our drinks, they were out of pibb, ranch and 8oz steaks. None of these thing besides the steak werent told to us until after food was ordered. Out server didn't know the menu very well. Just overall the experiment could have been better."
Renda P.,"McDonough, GA",0,2,,1.0,12/3/2017,"Soooo...frustrated!!! Ordered through the app for Carside to Go to be brought out to me, left a tip, but had to go in to get it. Not feeling well, so grabbed my order and left. I should have checked it. Ordered a burger added cheese. Got exactly that! There was no lettuce, tomato, pickles, condiments, etc. only option on app was select ""no"" to any of those, but I didn't do that. I'm too far to bother going back. Paid $12+ for really crappy food and service!"
Michael B.,"Atlanta, GA",16,39,77,2.0,7/23/2017,It's amazing how the prices go  up and the quality goes down. Waitress was not the best either. What's funny is that no one from headquarters will read this. Oh yeah the food score was an 88. More like a fast food joint than a restaurant now.
Tyra M.,"Columbus, GA",110,6,,1.0,10/31/2017,Literally the worse Applebee's I've ever been to. Waitresses and waiters were all so rude and clearly had attitude problems. It was almost comical how unenthusiastic they were.
Anthony M.,"Stockbridge, GA",0,2,,1.0,12/6/2017,The food was great the service was good. But the bartender played the music way too loud .
Lori W.,"Knoxville, TN",3419,1057,1567,1.0,6/13/2016,"This is one of the WORST ever Applebees I could have stepped into. The service is beyond slow. I felt like I wasnt even there. Finally got water after 28 minutes. The waitress forgot the lemons. Oh wow. No surprise there. She came back around 18 minutes later telling us our food is about to come out. What?! Wait. We ordered French onion soup before the meal.  Ok. Still waiting. On. Soup. 50 yes 50 minutes from the time we walked in to now. Water with lemons only. No soup. No food. Used the restroom and the comodes look like they have not been cleaned all week. There is a ring around them, seriously! Walking out. The. DOOR!!!! GONE! --Would NOT recommend this location to anyone--"
Mo S.,"Stockbridge, GA",10,2,,3.0,6/4/2017,"Ate dinner at this location this evening. Food was luke warm and missing ingredients. I took a photo because this has happened before. It was corrected but its a turn off. I did enjoy the meal, very delicious."
Nichole W.,"Stockbridge, GA",29,18,10,1.0,5/31/2017,"The manager Michael V. Matthews is a perv and hits on married women.  This place is a joke!  Ran by sex offenders!  Service sucks,  food is gross & way over priced!  Don't come here unless you want to be sexually harassed!"
Anthony J.,"Decatur, GA",8,46,16,1.0,1/31/2017,"This has to be one of the worst Applebee's in the area and judging by the reviews others think so as well. Let me begin my critique with the piss poor service. I attempted to call my order ahead of time to be proactive, but was on hold the duration of my drive to the restaurant, so needless to say no one picked up for at least 12 minutes. I ordered two salads to go, from the bar. While I was waiting a gentleman came behind me and ordered a burger and fries. Thinking my order should come out first and the simplicity of my order, the guy who ordered the burger got his food first and I had to wait for another 10 minutes for salad!!! Are you kidding...  When I got home ready to eat my salad, I looked in the bag, No salad dressing and No eating utensils.... Come on man...!! What did they expect me to do... throw my face into my salad bowl and choke down a dry salad... I'm never coming back to this place and I strongly advise any of you reading this review not to patronize this location until they have made some serious amendments to service."
Keith F.,"Atlanta, GA",38,100,32,1.0,12/19/2016,Used to be one of my favorite restaurants when I was traveling. But this was very disappointing. Wings were 1 out of a ten point scale. There were definitely cooked previously then warmed up. Several wings were fried to a crisp and then some
Wilma N.,"Rex, GA",14,1,1,1.0,7/16/2016,"If I could give it no stars I would! The service was horrible. As we were eating we found a roach crawling across our table. When I ask the waitress to get the manager she came back saying she couldn't find him. As a manager you should always be available to your staff and customers! When he finally came out he just stared at me like I was an idiot and he wasn't interested. I think only reason he gave my party a $10 discount is because he heard say ""man he don't even care"". But seriously a $ 10 discount after I just ate with a roach. Not to mention my friend said her refill drink taste like vomit!!! Save your money and don't eat here!"
Ayonna W.,"Atlanta, GA",271,247,217,3.0,5/9/2016,Went Saturday. Sat at the bar. The service was okay. I don't have any complaints about the service per se. But the frozen machine to make the drinks was broken. If you have frozen drinks on the menu it should be fixed at all times. That was a bit of a disappointment. The Playoff game was playing but I didn't understand why the music is off just because the game is on. Normally sports bars still have music playing while the game plays. I don't know. Maybe it's just me but that was a bit odd to me.
Bill C.,"Stockbridge, GA",5,1,,4.0,12/18/2016,"Greeted at the door, sat in bar area, very clean, staff very friendly, had nachos, delicious with fresh cut jalapeños, server was friendly and I enjoyed some small talk with her... A lot of smiling faces, I would recommend this Applebee's."
Jean J.,"Stockbridge, GA",8,2,,1.0,12/12/2016,The service ducked The table had ants had to change tables new table was dirty had to get it released Womens bathroom was dirty and STUNK! I told the waitress all of these things and NEVER came
Gabby J.,"Douglasville, GA",15,18,11,2.0,5/5/2016,We were like regulars ...but the last 3 times were horrible ..lol 3 because we were like its it our favorite spot we'll give them another chance. For starters they removed riblets Staff is nice ..the food i mean its not even worth 20 bucks drinks iced down \ watered down Think maybe they switched cooks or something ...The food just doesnt taste the same ... Decided not to go back
Furman B.,"Skokie, IL",54,4,,2.0,5/21/2016,"Arrived at the restaurant two hours before closing time which was 2am. Had a party of 12 and it seems that the whole staff fell apart trying to take care of our orders. Our waitress did do her best and she deserves credit for her efforts but the assisting staff kept sending out orders that weren't for our table. Plus food kept coming out slow. In the end once everyone finally got their food we decided to just take it to go instead of eating at the restaurant.  P.S. it was our waitresses first day on the job as well, even though inexperienced she did her job to the best of her ability."
Brenda S.,"Stockbridge, GA",48,59,7,1.0,6/28/2016,"If you want more business , on a day that is not busy like today dear restaurant manager, must speed up your service. Waited 20 minutes for a glass of wine only to be told they had to get it from the back when I asked why it was taking so long. Standard Cabernet. Wait another 20 minutes or so for my Fiesta lime chicken to come out. Fortunately the chicken was good and this cedar plank salmon was good that my husband had so we will probably come back only because it's in our town, but would not come to this restaurant if we had choices. Waiter Jason was friendly enough but did not come back and check after our meal was delivered until we were almost through. My husband had to ask for more water. If the service is this bad again the next time we won't come again. Come on Applebee's! Give this place some more attention!"
Sarah W.,"Columbus, OH",198,90,40,1.0,5/19/2016,"Dirty table, dirty seats, dirty cups, rude hostess, don't come here. I ended up not ordering food here."
Victoria M.,"Biloxi, MS",152,30,42,1.0,6/1/2016,Super super slow. Waited over an hour for food and it wasn't even busy. Wasn't our waitress fault but then again she didn't really wow us either. If she thought to maybe discount or bring the manager to us knowing that we were waiting forever would be fine. I'm currently a bartender/use to be server and if there is a problem I tell my managers ASAP. Before we got our food we asked for boxes and the check. Food was not worth waiting for either... Will not come back ever and this was our first visit.
Les W.,"Atlanta, GA",0,14,,1.0,3/5/2015,"Didnt plan to go to Applebee's, but figured it be quick and easy to grab some dinner. Don't sit in Brittany M.'s section. She is a schizo, seriously. One minute she's super smiley and nice and the next minute she's rolling her eyes and snapping! She practically got an attitude with my nephew when he didnt like his food and wanted to order something else. She grabbed his plate without saying excuse me and walked off. Like, dude, it's not your food, or your restaurant. ""Why you gotta be so rude??"" Food was lackluster. I know it's just Applebee's, but I felt like my food was just warmed over. There was also a discrepancy with the bill, but we figured why argue, but she never came back to collect the money. Needless to say she didnt get a tip. I wanted to leave one though. A message to say, ""Seek help."" Mental illness is a serious issue :/"
Michael W.,"Grayson, GA",48,44,29,2.0,2/6/2016,"Waiting at curbside for a 2/20 meal.  I was told 19mins , going on 35mins later still no food.  The hostess was nice, but come on.   Mozzarella sticks were hard and cold.  I hate say it just seems service is a thing of past...or is it a southside thing?"
Anthony G.,"Morrow, GA",0,8,,1.0,1/1/2016,"We had the 2 for 25, I like the hot plates helps food warm, but it also over cooks the food. So to get a stake med/well you'll need to order it rare"
Tim B.,"Palm Coast, FL",0,3,1,3.0,1/8/2016,Of course because it is an Applebees I really enjoyed my food and that's the only reason I am giving them 3 stars but my waitress and the staff I won't say they were rude its just hard for me to enjoy my meal when my waitress seems to act as we are a nuisance to her and she had better places to be than at work
Bernice H.,"Atlanta, GA",6,17,8,5.0,12/6/2015,"Great atmosphere, really chill, and great customer service. Happy Hour is the best. $5 dollar drinks and half off apps. Take advantage of it!"
V M.,"Edison, NJ",0,16,2,1.0,7/30/2016,"This place is filthy!  Within a months time, I came here 3 times while on business trips in June.  The first time I immediately notice how dirty the carpets were.  I'm not talking foot traffic dirt, I'm talking food, crumbs, napkins, etc.  The womens rest rooms were equally dirty.  No tissue and paper towels overflowing the trash.  But it was lunch time and busy, so I was able to dismiss it.  The 2nd time, I went alone, so I sat at the table in the bar area.  It was around 9 pm, good crowd for the time but not overly busy.  For 15 minutes, I sat waiting to at least order a drink while watching 3 staff members talking/laughing near the kitchen entrance.  1 or 2 of them occasionally looked my way but didn't bother to acknowledge me.  Meanwhile, I'm noticing how dirty the floors are at my table and around bar area in general. Finally one of the people I had been watching came and took my order. 3rd and last time, I went for dinner.  After dinner I wanted to wash my hands.  This time, I had to walk to the opposite side of the restaurant to get to the restroom.  Passing the entrance to the kitchen, pass the bar, and all the way debris on the floors. Then, just before the restroom, I got a glimpse of inside another entrance to the kitchen, literally, piles of food, on the floors along the counters. It was sickening to think I just ate there.  But NEVER again."
Sonja P.,"Riverdale, GA",0,4,,1.0,3/10/2016,"Waited 10 mins to be seated, waited another 10 for server to come, when food finally came, chicken was burned and mashed potatoes wasnt loaded like my girl had ordered will not be going back"
Debra C.,"Marietta, GA",0,3,,1.0,7/6/2015,This place sucks... So I'm here. I order dimmer and a appetizer....  Tell me why my appetizer comes out with my dinner????!  On top of it all my freakish food is not even hot. I just wasted money. But I'll never be back!!!!
Alison R.,"Daytona Beach, FL",1,2,,1.0,10/7/2015,"We ate here since it was close to our hotel. The food was decent and the service was ok. If you want a nice dinner where you can talk to the people you are with, this is not the place. They had the music so loud it makes you feel like you are in a night club instead of a restaurant. The at 7pm they start to dim the lights. If there was a negative star I would give this place one."
Jerico M.,"McDonough, GA",18,27,73,5.0,6/25/2015,The Smokey flavored ribs are awesome. Tastes like backyard BBQ!! The side salads are a nice size and the fries are delicious!!
Darron S.,"Locust Grove, GA",0,1,,1.0,5/13/2016,The food was horrible.  The entree came out burnt and over cooked. The Management on Duty was non apologetic and carry on as business as usual.
Paul H.,"Jonesboro, GA",0,2,,1.0,1/6/2016,"Garbage food and garbage service. Just wasted 45.00 and an hour and half that I will never get back. Ordered Fiesta chicken chopped salad.  Wrong lettuce,not chopped and no dressing.  Rather than send it back  (had sent hamburger back already ) I asked if he could bring me the dressing on the side. Fifteen minutes later waiter comes back. You would think if the entree was wrong you would make sure you took care of problems immediately.  Sick and tired of the lackluster effort given by people in the restaurant industry on this side of town. News flash, I'm doing you a favor by visiting your establishment not the other way around.  Welcome to the Southside.  No wonder we can't get decent restaurants around here. You can't find people worth a darn to work."
Tiffany P.,"Stockbridge, GA",9,1,1,1.0,11/18/2014,"Family dinner with my daughter .. We order our appetizers and our original waitress left without letting us know she was leaving for today so we ended up with a new waitress and ordered the remaining of our meals. With this particular Applebees either your food was just really hot or it was a lukewarm we ordered shooter for dessert I had a strawberry cheesecake shooter and my daughter had to check with me shooter my daughter looked at me funny while chewing her dessert she stated its really crunchy she took another scoop and found half of a cockroach in her shooter "" pictures posted so you can see a leg and half of its body"" I informed the waitress she saw it and got the manager the manager tried to play it off and then when he went to go back to see the shooter he paid our entire our ticket and he was trying to explain that they do not meet the desserts in house that they come from somewhere else I don't know what to say about this but it was really disgusting my daughter will not  eat at a Applebee's any longer nor wish to eat chocolate mouspse."
Mickey D.,"Roswell, GA",8,126,,3.0,7/5/2013,"I don't know why I'm even bothering to review Crapplebee's. Slave to the Yelp. We didn't set out to eat here, but everywhere else we tried was either closed or had a wait. So that deserves a star. Our server was very friendly and attentive and cheery despite having to work on the Fourth of July. There's another star. And my food wasn't bad. Star. But I hate these places. I'm not a pictures-on-the-menu sort of person. And though I'm not a vegetarian, I simply didn't want any meat at this meal and the only meatless item they have is the grilled cheese sandwich. They don't even have a vegetarian salad! I know it's Applebee's, but I figured they'd at least have a black bean burger. My ladyfriend had something called Chicken Wonton Tacos. What? Gimmickry. All told, and despite my too-cool-for-school shame at even being there, we got some lunch, it was exactly as advertised and there wasn't anything wrong with it. So credit where credit is due. But chain restaurants are not good for my soul, so I hope never to return."
Randy A.,"San Diego, CA",1,106,35,5.0,9/21/2012,"It takes a lot for me to give five stars to a restaurant but this one deserves it. A great server named Heather was just the beginning. She was young but understood that her job was not complicated-serving food and drinks. I also asked that she NOT DO two things: ask me how my food, salad, etc. was and ask me if I wanted more coffee. ""Just keep it full please."" The food delivery was perfect-salad first and the entree just as I finished the salad. Salad was cool, not ice cold and entree was perfect temperature. Portions were just right. I really liked that especially since I hate to throw food away. I highly recommend this place for great service, great food, sufficient portions and a great kitchen. Keep up the good work."
Maurice F.,"McDonough, GA",0,4,,1.0,4/3/2016,"Came in to place a to go order and have a drink while I wait. It took my server 10 mins to get to me. Then he took my drink order and walked off without leaving a menu. It took another 5 minutes to find him and ask for a menu. Another 5 minutes for him to bring my menu. I ordered 3 to go meals, so now he's checking on me and saying my food will be up shortly. 45 minutes later my food comes out. I ordered the crispy brew house chicken for myself. I checked the order and noticed It was missing the cheese. Asked the server, he went to get it and then comes back and says it doesn't come with cheese. The menu states it did. So now he looks at a menu to confirm. As long as I waited, even if it didn't come with cheese, why argue it. While waiting, I checked the food temps, and all 3 meals were ice cold. I told him I don't want them they're all cold. I wish there was a half a star button. I'm not a person to leave a bad review. But I will not return to this establishment!!!!"
Tiffany P.,"Pigeon Forge, TN",0,7,,1.0,11/29/2013,Terrible Applebee's location. Poor service. Server didn't write down order and messed up what we wanted.  Registers went down and we had to wait for 20+ mins for a tab. Took multiple requests for additional sauces. AVOID this Applebee's.
Mo W.,"Hampton, GA",1,3,4,1.0,12/3/2013,"This Applebee's needs a major renovation,as far as the food goes I had better meals at other Applebee's"
Margaret B.,"Stockbridge, GA",0,13,,2.0,3/20/2015,"Received an email that Monday is $5 burger night, so four of us decided it was a cheap night out.  We got what we paid for ... Food and service were adequate, but nothing to brag about.  The bar was doing a booming business ... Perhaps, we should drink our dinner there if there is a next time!"
