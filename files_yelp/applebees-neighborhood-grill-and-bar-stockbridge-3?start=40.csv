Philip M.,"Jackson, GA",40,265,173,3.0,7/28/2012,"Went in for a quick lunch, waitress was great and getting the ordered placed, served and bill processed. Very affordable lunch options with pick a pair. The roast beef sandwich and chicken tortilla soup were delicious. Crazy though, coke was $2.49. Order water with lemon to make it a very inexpensive meal!"
Stu T.,"Crystal Lake, IL",5,35,,4.0,12/23/2011,We stopped in to get a break from horrific (normal?) traffic. Arrived around 4:00 and were greeted warmly. The food quality was consistent with expectations (a good thing) and it was served hot. Service was polite and appropriately attentive. It was a good experience.
K C.,"McDonough, GA",0,16,1,2.0,11/12/2013,"If you enjoy very loud music (hip hop and R&B) playing over the sound of televisions and over the sound of everyone almost yelling to be heard at their table then you will love this place.  My husband and I couldn't have a dinner conversation due to the noise level and even the server had problems taking our order.  At the table next to us, the manager could not hear the couple trying to make a complaint and even pointed to the speakers to say it was loud but never turned it down.  This pretty much ruined the experience for us and we will not go back. The service was good and the food was ""OK"" - not the best, not the worst. The kitchen was fairly slow."

A L S.,"Biloxi, MS",6,130,110,4.0,11/11/2013,"This Applebee's is a good choice if you like this genre of food.  The location and parking are easy access from I-75.  It is clean and well staffed.  A sure sign of good management is that on this Veterans Day Comp Meal service, the host ASKED if we would mind sharing a table--not a requirement.  This sped up service for everyone and made it easier on the staff. The door had been held open for us to enter and leave on this cool weather day. We had the Fiesta Lime Chicken which is a sautéed breast with a southwestern sauce top and covered in cheddar jack cheese.   It was served with southwestern rice which was tasty and cooked just right with kernels separating and not mushy or sticky.  Accompanying was a lime wedge, pico de gallo and tiny colored tortilla strips.  All in all a good choice as we have eaten this several times before across the US; it has always been consistent from one to another of the chain.  Our server Sharonda was very pleasant and professional.  We shared a table with a couple that was rather demanding.  The servers' attitude was great and accommodating and did not suffer any ill when one of the ladies wanted another vegetable choice after the food arrived (she actually received two more fresh sides because she told the runner and the server she didn't like the first menu item given--she was charged for neither).  The 20 something irregular customer also did not like her food touching anything on the plate and thought the free steak was too small, but her friend got her to ""get over it"".  The steak customer did not complain about the way it was cooked, so it seemed to have been satisfied as she ended up taking the leftovers home and even ordered dessert. The other customer (non-comp) had baby back ribs and the plate was cleaned.  Sharonda keep up with fantastic service in the busy dining hour and met and exceeded everyone's demands.  She was a true professional that I would have love to have in my own Café.  The iced tea was good but my wife said the coffee was not fresh--the only complaint, typical but not acceptable in the mid afternoon hour.  Always ask for fresh--most servers will start a new pot.  Applebee's supports many charities ( ) as noted by a No Kid Hungry sticker on the door ( ).  All in all a good food and service choice made better when we researched the charitable giving.  We will go again to this location."
Jason N.,"Jonesboro, GA",0,1,1,4.0,9/29/2012,"The food was great, also the waitress was really nice here. But the service was kind of slow. It took more than 30 minutes just for 3 orders for mine. But, overall every thing was fine."
