Brittany B.,"Radcliffeborough, Charleston, SC",79,11,19,4.0,9/28/2017,I had an amazing meal tonight with great service! Their mac and cheese with bacon in it is on point and my waitress was so pleasant and attentive. The food came out super quick and they didn't rush us out of there even with my fussy baby they all continued to awe over and say how cute she was. They also changed a dish to be able to accommodate my vegetarian grandmother which is bonus points for me
Ryan B.,"Summerville, SC",64,4,,1.0,10/31/2017,"It's only getting a one star because their beverage was good. Microwaved mashed potatoes, steak that's been grilled hours before, and microwaved vegetables without any seasoning. Bar and Grill, more like Bar and ill."
Shanley M.,"Charleston, SC",37,73,62,2.0,9/10/2016,It's Applebee's. It's average to sub par food. Went in around 1230 on a Saturday and only one other table was in there. Sat at a table in the bar. Ordered the 2 for $25 deal. We got a spinach dip as the app. Was a very weird green color but tasted ok. I got the chicken tenders and macaroni. All I ate was the tenders. A lot of pieces of the bacon included were raw. My husband ordered the half rack and fries. Fries were cold. Rack had a weird tangy taste to it. He didn't eat most of it. Manager and servers were sitting at the bar in front of us on their phone complaining about people calling in. Bartender called me babe... Not a very fun experience.
Casey B.,"Harleyville, SC",45,6,5,1.0,6/22/2017,"We spent 125.00 tonight at Applebee's. Ordered my father in law food togo. Get home to this. Apparently this is ""coleslaw"" it smells HORRIBLE. It's in two tiny condiment cups. We ordered 2 sirloin steaks, ribs, stir fry, a huge appetizer platter, chicken tenders and bourbon chicken and shrimp. The bourbon chicken and shrimp had 3 shrimp and was bland and had no flavor. So we returned it. It came off the 2 for 25 menue. So they refunded $10.00 in my mind half of $25.00 is $12.50... then get home to realize that the portions we have are 1/2 the size they should've been. That's 3 platter and 2 were made large and they ended up all being the same size so that was a waste of $4.00 for going large. All 3 ended up being smaller than normal portions. We have been regular customers for 3 years and we will not be coming back."
Marie N.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",2,60,,3.0,9/24/2016,This is a staple when we shop in Summerville.  We used to have one around the corner from our old home and the kids love it.  Menu for kids had Kraft Mac n cheese and it comes with a free refill on chocolate milk!  Healthy sides for options like broccoli and yogurt with strawberries.  They have a two for twenty which is a good value.   A family of four can eat for under $40. A little more if you want a treat after your meal.
Andrew C.,"Summerville, SC",52,1,,1.0,5/14/2017,"Sat at the bar and the bartender was no where to be found for a good 10 minutes. We weren't asked if we wanted appetizers or anything. We got our food before our silverware and it still took long enough to get that the very slow staff had to go check where it is. I had the bourbon steak which is 2 4oz sirloins, one was medium rare one was medium. The potatoes that come with it were terrible. We weren't provided with sauces or any condiments. My girlfriends broccoli wasn't cooked. Very unsatisfactory"
Becca A.,"Summerville, SC",7,62,7,1.0,3/3/2017,Should have checked reviews before we went. The waitress Alexis was slamming drinks down on table. She charged us twice for a burger we sent back due to it still mooing. She was just not polite. She acted like she didn't want to be at work that day.service was slow. It took 15 minutes to get drinks. Every appetizer we order was out. Won't be back to this one.
Delanie D.,"Kingsburg, CA",121,6,,5.0,7/13/2017,"Best service ever. If you go to this Applebees, request Ben for your server. You will not be disappointed. Applebee's should be renamed to AppleBen's in honor of the amazing service."
Glenn V.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",1907,1122,1552,4.0,12/25/2015,"If you asked me last night my opinion of Applebees, my reply would be mostly unflattering as I fashion myself not a fan of the chain, but last nights experience changed my opinions.  Dateline: Christmas eve 2015: Charleston, SC---Bartender Billy ripped right into the specials menu, verbally outlining everything we should know from beer suggestions to discounted appetizers.   Once my 7oz sirloin hit the hardwood of the bar in front of me and my first slice was cut, not only I, but billy recognized the cook temp looked closer to Pittsburgh that medium rare. Billy scooped it up sensing my disappointed and I think waited for it to be done properly and stated he'd get me a new one if it wasn't up to my satisfaction. The corn chips that accompanied my spinach dip were slightly glistening as they were fresh, not from the old batch that had been sitting around, this too was Billy's doing. All the while making pleasant conversation, handling the bar and being just a general delight to be around. Without a doubt, this was the single best chain restaurant/bar experience I've had to date. Special mention of gratitude to the floor manager whose name I did not catch. Adorned in a red button down top, her eyes were keenly aware of my presence, came over to ask about the meal she personally delivered to me and graciously thanked me for my patronage upon my departure."
Kelsi R.,"Charleston, SC",34,6,,5.0,4/7/2017,We just had dinner here and ordered the 2 for 20. We got the mottz sticks which were good and the three cheese chicken cavitappi and it was so great! The grilled chicken had great flavor and wasn't dry at all. Our server Kelly M. was very attentive and had great customer service skills! She even asked if I wanted my daughters food out first! Nobody has asked me that in the past three years of us going out. I never even think to ask and it helped us out a great deal since she eats slower than us. She brought refills quickly and our food came out quite quickly for a busy Friday night. I used to be a server so I critique every server I have and compare them. She is one of the best servers we have ever had! Thank you for a great dinner experience!
Dreamsof S.,"Summerville, SC",0,3,1,1.0,3/3/2017,I think this is the worst  service experience ever we have been before but this time it was worse the people didn't care if I could I would give 0stars because that's what this deserves
Eric B.,"Summerville, SC",1,27,3,1.0,3/5/2016,"I have been to several Applebee's in the past and they were all very decent with the huge exception of this location.  I took my family here on a slow Thursday evening March/2016 and even though they were not busy they were also very understaffed and even slower serving the maybe 10 tables in the restaurant. My wife and I did the 2 for $25 deal and both got the house sirloin. The ""steak"" seriously had more of a consistency of a pork chop and tasted very bland. The server was nice enough but pretty slow and the cleanliness of the place was mediocre. The booth we sat an had a 10"" tear right in the middle of the vinyl cushion and just looked nasty.  Clean up your act Applebee's or this franchise is going to go out of business."
J G.,"Summerville, SC",98,395,105,2.0,2/12/2016,"Why do I put myself through it. Called in fries and dessert for my son. (2/12/16 at 7:22 pm) Told me 25 minutes, as always, curbside means come in and get your own. Cant wait till this location goes out of business so a good restaurant can move in"
Kendra F.,"Goose Creek, SC",153,1,,1.0,11/12/2016,"This was the worst dinning experience I have had in a while. My husband and I sat down around 1:30 on Saturday, the bartender was our server since I assume they don't heavily staff for slow hours. She was polite enough but extremely slow, I mean, extremely. They were not at all busy but everything took forever. Ordered pretzel appetizer, which was burnt, and boneless wings which were undercooked. Our table was barely bussed the entire time we were there and it took forever for our check to come. Other employees, including the manager sitting around on their phones and/or eating. Restrooms were extremely filthy and rundown. This Applebee's is honestly a train wreck."
Jovon P.,"Summerville, SC",32,1,,1.0,9/4/2016,"Service was slow, food was not good, and definitely the worst Applebee's I've ever ate at!! Not again!"
Stephen I.,"Glen Allen, VA",12,10,1,1.0,3/12/2017,3/10 Well we were sitter right away 537 pm and it took 10 minutes for our server to come over just as we were getting ready to leave wish me did. They were not busy at all and they had 4 managers standing at the end of the bar and you would think they would be Johnny on the spot with the service but they sure missed the spot. We ordered water an a drink from the bar water came out right away but the 1 drink just sat at the bar until 610 pm right near the 4 managers standing at the bar still talking. We ordered the wrap to come out last but came out with the pretzels and burned nachos which she took back to the kitchen only to come back out with the remade nacho and the wrap was cold with very little chicken if there was any in there. We were there for 1 1/2 for as 4 managers stood at the bar talking. 2 waters 1 blue long island Pretzels Burnt nachos Cold wrap Only 1 refill on water after asking for it. We will not return to this unit because each time the are either out of many menu items or serve raw boneless chicken chunks
John B.,"Goose Creek, SC",0,3,,1.0,5/15/2015,"Normally good, but tonight was terrible!!!! Slow service,slow food...Manager John doesn't have a clue,  Will not be back."
David H.,"Summerville, SC",5,1,,1.0,3/31/2016,"After waiting over 30 minutes for a take out order, arrived home to find the Chicken Fiesta Salad was missing chicken, corn, black beans, and dressing. So I paid $10 for a plate of romaine lettuce and tortilla strips. Also, the chicken quesadilla appetizer was missing the salsa. How hard is it to get a simple order correct? They have lost my business."
Eliezer G.,"Charlotte, NC",9,1,,1.0,1/17/2016,Customer service as far as the black girl that was hosting Sunday night I was with 2 toddlers and a infant and she sat a couple before us and we where there for 20 minutes before she was rude and you could not tell who was the manager the date was 1/17/2016 they get no stars I will never go back and will refer no-one till they get rid of her
Norman H.,"Summerville, SC",5,7,2,2.0,9/12/2014,"Service was fine, but the food lacked taste. It seems to arrive a little slowly, but not too terribly bad. All in all, there are probably better places to get mediocre food that won't cost you quite as much as here. For what it's worth, the service was perfectly fine. I don't think the quality of the food has anything to do with the staff at this location."
Mike B.,"Summerville, SC",0,5,,1.0,7/14/2016,"Filthy!  Had to clean a sticky substance off the seat cushion before I could sit. Something resembling soup had been spilled on the menu, seeped through several pages and was just downright nasty. Told the waitress and hostess about dirty menu and watched it be placed right back in the holder. I am sure the kitchen is exactly the same judging by the employees attitude. Washed my hands and left."
Cody T.,"Goose Creek, SC",25,8,,1.0,10/12/2015,"Honestly the slowest/most idiotic service I've ever experienced. Overpriced/mediocre food, and I had an empty cup for the majority of the time."
Steven D.,"Ladson, SC",0,20,,3.0,3/30/2015,"We go here often because of burger night on Mondays, when burgers are discounted. They have very good burgers, which is the only thing that keeps us coming back. We have tried their other food offerings and it is not good. There seems to be a lot of turnover in wait staff as we keep seeing new ones.  Anyway, tonight the service was bad. Our server forgot part of our meal, and was taking forever to come back with it. I finally walked up to another server at a cash register and stood there for a very long time while she ignored me. Finally, I asked for help and she looked at me like I was a real bother. This restaurant needs new management. There is way too much inconsistency in both service and food quality."
Hana M.,"Charleston, SC",126,221,95,3.0,1/3/2014,"Applebee's has the grossest food of any franchise restaurant. This is just my opinion. It's nothing against their summerville location, which i think is brand spanking new, this is just how I feel of Applebee's as a whole and as someone who has been going there for the half price appetizers after 10 since I was about 10.  The best thing on the menu is available after 10 half off - mozzarella sticks. Order anything else and you'll be truly disappointed. Like the Applebee's steak which I once watched my mom eat even though it looked like a tiny black penis.  I have a pic of this somewhere, I'll find it. She said ""it's better than it looks""... And then I had a grilled cheese and tomato soup, the picture in the menu made the grilled cheese look cheesy with 3 different cheese but it was really two giant grilled pieces of Texas toast and a little sprinkling of shredded cheese mix. I didn't think a grilled cheese could ever be done poorly but this one is. I switched it out for the moz sticks.  This is not where you go when you are feelin too lazy to cook but want a good dinner nor is it the place to impress a date, but with their half off appetizers after 10 menu, this is your best late night after bar or after theater food option. Because Applebee's knows that anything tastes good after a certain time if you have had enough liquor."
Brenda C.,"Ladson, SC",0,7,,1.0,6/3/2015,Service was as bad as it gets. Server was rude and nasty because we asked for a straw.  You could tell management is passing on a bad attitude  At dinner time there was only one other couple and it looked like their service was just as bad if not worse than what we had or more to the point didn't have .  The place was very very dirty and everything was sticky.  We left and went to O'Charleys.  Please don't reward this place with your business !!!
Kathy L.,"Summerville, SC",0,2,,1.0,4/2/2015,"I downloaded the Yelp app for the sole purpose of warning the public about this horrible atrocious poor excuse for a restautant. NEVER eat here.  We arrived at 9pm. A party of 9, with 4 kids and 5 adults.  Despite the empty restaurant, we were told by a frantic host that it would be a 20-30 minute wait because there wasn't any silverware. (Wtf)? We would have walked out right then, had we not been to 2 other restaurants that were closing early, and had hungry children.  After waiting for 10 minutes,  I finally worked up the nerve to ask the host to push two tables together. We waited another 5 minutes. I asked the assistant manager what the hold up was. She advised me that they had ""closed that particular section"" but she was doing us a ""favor"" by ""opening"" the section for us. Nevermind the fact that,  throughout our meal, 4 other tables were seated after us in the same section. The food was horrible. I ordered an appetizer trio. The mozzarella sticks were worse than the frozen ones that I get from Costco. The ""brisquet"" nachos had literally 2 shreds of meat on them (not exaggerating), and they tasted like day old iceverg lettuce salad shreds and tomato puree. The last appetizer was Sriracha shrimp.  It was awful. Think: frozen, defrosted, frozen again, and covered in watery Sriracha,  over tasteless cardboard fried chips.  If you are any type of foodie,  (again, this place was our LAST option; real foodies already know to avoid Applebee's), steer clear. The waiter was pleasant enough,  however average. The assistant manager was a dud. I mean really... who closes a section of a restaurant when there is a 30 minute wait, then tells the patron you are doing them a ""favor"" by opening it. No, no, no lady....  0 out of 5 stars... This restaurant exemplifies horrible restaurants. Not only is it the worst Applebee's I have ever been to, it is the WORST restaurant that I have been to in the Charleston area. I would rather starve, eat my 2 year olds muddy sock, and drink rotten milk, before ever eating at that Applebee's again. Do not go there. You have been warned. Seriously. Crap service. Crap food."
Doesn't S.,"Athens, GA",0,3,,1.0,5/24/2015,"Went to the Applebee's on Main St in Summerville, SC for my daughter's birthday lunch. We asked for a few minutes to order and our server Nicole got short with us because we weren't ready to order. After we all ordered finally got our drinks. I ordered a salad..never got it. They brought out main courses and I finally stated where is my salad. The service was horrible. The food was ok not great. We then asked if they would sing happy birthday they gave two excuses why they do not sing it. Main excuse. Because it is a patented song therefore they can't. Then said they never heard of it being sang here. I have brought many of my friends and family here for their birthday and it was sang. Just say no. Don't make stupid excuses.  Very disappointed in the service. I will be telling everyone and we spend lots of money at this restaraunt."
Daniel H.,"Plymouth, MI",1,14,,2.0,10/26/2014,"This place gets worse each visit...would have stopped coming a long time ago but parents live near by and they like it.  Summary:  over cooked food, salads drowning in sauce, and the restaurant is not very clean.   Servers are attentive but that's about the only good thing!"
Rebecca D.,"Malta, NY",7,85,22,4.0,6/29/2013,"Our experience at this Applebee's was pretty good. We were initially put off by the one review here on Yelp, but decided to give it a try anyways. Our server was very friendly, and the Manager was even making rounds to ask everyone how their experience was. He came by our table twice, but not in an intrusive way at all.  The food was as good as one can expect from Applebee's. My wife had a shrimp and chicken skillet that was hot and very tasty, and I had the riblets basket which was also pretty good. We did the special where you get two entrees and an appetizer for $20, and I was actually surprised to see that we got a full order of mozerella sticks. I was expecting like 4 or six since it was a ""special"" but there were probably 8 or 10 in the basket.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back here again for a quick night out, or to bring a family. We went on a Friday night and the place was not that busy."
Cynthia Z.,"Summerville, SC",1,10,1,2.0,11/28/2014,"Tina was an excellent server, above and beyond service. The kitchen held her back, our food left a lot to be desired! I'm not sure what's going on with both of the Apple Bees locations in Summerville but they need to re-examine kitchen recipes and their reading skills. I saw our ticket BOH and it did not say mid well... It was mid rare!   UN seasoned fries means NO seasoning!!! The list of items wrong brought our manager out three times, not because we asked but because our server was irritated by the level of inaccuracy by BOH. Remember the ticket was correct but the third grade reading level of BOH screwed FOH! Thank you Tina we appreciate you!"
Tram H.,"Elk Grove, CA",58,5,,1.0,12/17/2014,All I have to say is that they have the worst service ever... The place wasn't busy at all but service takes forever and on top of all that our steaks were bad like spoiled bad and one of them had a worm in it.  So assistant manager replaces one of my meals with another meal in which I have to pay for. Stay away from this place...
Jeff H.,"Greenville, SC",26,12,6,1.0,12/3/2014,"Slow service, wrong food. Other customers complaining about waiting so long like we were. Mangers having to go to tables for complaints. Not coming back"
Stacy K.,"Summerville, SC",12,11,8,1.0,7/27/2014,"Absolutely terrible.   Walked I  at 1030 PM,  (open till 1 am.)  asked me if we wanted a table or a booth and then told me LOL the booths were dirty and we would have to wait  few min,  which we did. Sat down and they only cleared the dishes onto the next dirty booth over.  Wiped the table from a bucket that was on the ground and left the table soaking wet.  Opened the napkins  to find silverware with food stuck between the tines.   BIG FAT FAIL.  We got up to talk to a manager of which one never came,  so we walked out.   FAIL!"
Kristopher S.,"Goose Creek, SC",7,5,2,2.0,3/7/2010,"Wow I have not been to an Applebees in a long time......and this visit reminded me why yet again.  This visit was on a Sat. night around 8PM.  We were told there would be a 25 minute wait on the phone before we arrived and when we did arrive we were sat immediately which was a bonus. The time we saved by not having to wait for a table was quickly sucked away by a server who, came to the table fairly quickly and returned with drinks, but made us wait for 15 more minutes after we told her we needed another minute to look at the menu before she returned to take our order.  Me and my wife both ordered the same exact thing - Dinner portion of the Riblets w/ their original BBQ sauce.  Easy enough that the server even said "" no need to right it down "" it's easy enough.""  MISTAKE She put the order in right away and the food came quickly.  Food was hope and visually appealing except for the fact that our orders which were supposed to be exactly the same where in fact the smaller basket instead of the dinner portion and they had two completely different BBQ sauces on them.  Something the was ""easy"" to remember could not have been more incorrect.  I guess that is what happens when you don't write down the order! Service continued to be as bad throughout the meal, we asked for extra BBQ sauce as to try to correct our food ourselves, this was met with another 10 minute wait.  She returned with the sauce and our refill of drinks.  She did not return to the table for another 15 minutes to promptly deliver our check, failing to ask if we would like anything else.  We did decide to order dessert but had to tell her we weren't finished when she brought the check.  I find this hilarious as most places try to make you feel like your grandma is going to die if you do not order dessert.   The dessert took another 20 minutes to obtain.  We had ordered the Maple Butter Blondie which is served on a hot cast iron skillet like fajitas are served.  The 20 wait, we found out, was to get get those skillets white hot.  We had to wait for every bite to cool so it could be eaten.  After the third or fourth bite we started to smell something burning, sure enough the blonde brownie had burned and scorched on the white hot skillet.  Let me tell you burnt pieces of brownie mixed with maple butter sauce and vanilla ice cream is definitely not ""GOOD EATS."" In conclusion, had we not had a gift card for this meal I would have been a lot more upset than I already was.  This is why I do not frequent Apple bee's - The Food is Bad or The Service is Bad or Both are bad, it is never consistent.  Apple bee's is the epitome of prepackaged food for the sake of consistency, so these problems are absolutely baffling."
Erica B.,"Charleston, SC",19,67,,1.0,1/2/2014,Worst experience I have ever had! My family was finished with all their meals by the time I got mine! They brought out 3 of the wrong dishes before I got the correct one. The hostess was rude and our server was nowhere to be found. NEVER AGAIN! Not to mention it took 30 minutes just to get the check!
Romeo W.,"Summerville, SC",1,6,,2.0,3/31/2015,Haven't been to this chain in almost ten years. Tonight's experience reminded me exactly why that is. Service was ok. Waiter wasn't very attentive. We were sat near the servers station. It was pretty awesome to listen to all the gossip of the establishment from various servers who didn't even care to whisper or talk lower than usual. We were entertained at the very least. I got the Mac and cheese with chicken strips. I'm not even going to complain that my dish's temperature was slightly above Luke warm. But the chicken was overly covered in some kind of sweet honey glaze. Which were sat atop the Mac and cheese. The excess sauce found it's home in the warm comfort of the macaroni. The Mac and cheese was overly sweet because of this. Honestly I should of returned it or said something. But the place was such a train wreck I just wanted to leave. Definitely would cautiously recommend. Beers and appetizers may be the way to go?
Mike L.,"Charleston, SC",19,124,,3.0,10/1/2013,"We get take-out from here once or twice a month. Good food but consistently lax service from the kitchen. Order was wrong 4 times in a row. 4 times the expediter failed to check the order.  Management did what they could to make up for it, but I would rather just have things be right.  Lately it has been better. I'll update in a few months."
Charlie C.,"Caro, MI",0,3,,1.0,1/18/2015,"Stopped in here about 11pm on a Sunday. Checked reviews before I went in and they were not good, but gave it a try anyway. Service was not bad but the food was not good at all!! I got the bourbon street chicken and shrimp with mashed potatoes. When it came out I was shocked, the portion was pitiful, smallest chicken breast ever totally dry and a few shrimp way over cooked and a couple mushrooms and a little bit of onion also overcooked. Potatoes were ok. The Johnnie Walker black was not right either and I know my scotch. No bread or salad . I left feeling hungry and very very unsatisfied."
Joey B.,"Summerville, SC",3,3,,1.0,1/2/2014,Horrible service! I was ready to walk out before getting the check! Took 2 hours in total bit only ate for about 20!
A.J. P.,"Goose Creek, SC",1,34,,3.0,7/16/2014,"Staff is usually friendly, food is mediocre, prices are ok for what you get. Overall, not in my top 5, but ok to eat every now and then."
