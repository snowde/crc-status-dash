Russ H.,"Summerville, SC",0,3,,2.0,10/6/2014,Baffled how restaurants can run out of stuff...but especially this Applebee's. I come here fairly often...and it seems like every time I come here they are out of something. Finally had to write a review...this time they were out of ranch dressing.... RANCH DRESSING!! I wanted wings for Monday night football... But decided against it because they were OUT OF RANCH DRESSING. How does that happen??
