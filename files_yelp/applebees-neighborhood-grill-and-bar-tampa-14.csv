Kristy C.,"Davie, FL",85,2,,5.0,12/22/2017,"The outside scenery is beautiful, the food was excellent and our Server Brian was an exceptional waiter, 5 stars!!"
Teneisha G.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,16,14,4.0,10/11/2017,I had a great experience here! I was visiting from California and the manager went out of his way to make sure I was taken care of. Danielle our server made us these custom drink they make at the Applebee's back home. The food had a few issues but they were fixed in a very timely manner. Thanks guys.
Grace H.,"Tampa, FL",107,353,1069,3.0,7/29/2017,"To celebrate the national chicken wing day, we came to Applebee for their half price double crunch bone in  chicken wings. We picked the Thai peanut sauce.  9 pieces of the deep fried chicken wings with some peanut butter sauce on them.  They tasted average. The service was nice."
Shane I.,"Riverview, FL",10,10,9,1.0,11/21/2017,"I walked in and was seated fairly quickly maybe 2 min wait. Since then it's been 22 minutes and there still hasn't been a server to my table. I've seen a girl walk by 4 times and as I say excuse me she just keeps waking by as if I didn't say anything, despite serving the tables on both sides of us. Absolutely uncalled for. I have been in food service for almost 20 years and there is no excuse for this!!!! I would add a pic but my table is bare as I'm still waiting as I write this. Should I have gone elsewhere!"
Danielle D.,"Bradenton, FL",131,411,96,4.0,6/20/2017,"Came here for lunch while in the area and everything was great.  They have a fast lunch menu that includes a drink for only around $8 which is such a great deal that my friend chose.  I opted for the Thai shrimp salad to stick to my weight watcher points and to my surprise, the salad was huge.  Plenty of shrimp in there too!  Service was fast and we were in and out."
Tina L.,"Valrico, FL",9,26,20,5.0,8/17/2017,I had to give them 5 stars for their $1.49 Bahama Mamas yesterday on national rum day...I ordered 2 off the top as soon as I sat down lol...you can taste the coconut rum...they were so delicious! And i enjoyed the $3 chicken casadillas & ceasar salad. Thank Applebee's for making my hump day a fun day!
Amber T.,"Orlando, FL",0,3,,1.0,12/9/2017,Service was terrible waited 30 min for a menu and didn't even acknowledge us until I said where is our server. Didn't even ask or serve us utensils or water. With 5 hungry angry kids it is very frustrating to wait for drinks and food.
Miriam A.,"Thonotosassa, FL",1,11,2,1.0,9/30/2017,"Every experience has been a bad 1- THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED ANYWHERE. I'm  so upset by the service I've received from this Apple bees. This is not the first time but is the worst time. My order was extremely late, my burger was not made as I requested, my fries were stale and cold and the extras I paid for were forgotten. This was a take out order so after all the other mistakes I came home to realize my extras that I paid for had been forgotten. I did ask to speak to the manager when I was there but was told I would have to wait around 20minutes. Don't waste your money or time here. It is to ghetto I also witnessed a table walk out without paying. & heard this happens many times. So why would this Apple bees care with constant costumers likes that."
Christy B.,"Tampa, FL",37,17,32,1.0,7/31/2016,"I've been to Applebee's many times before but this one off Fowler is just terrible. When I first came to this location with my best friend, we got set immediately but we waited for at least 20mins for someone to greet us. There were at least 6 servers and 1 bartender. It wasn't even busy. I was ready to walk out. But then 20mins later, the bartender came up to us and greeted us. No apologies for waiting so long... Anyways, I ordered unsweet tea. Then she came out with sweet tea. My friend and I both ordered medium rare steak. It came out well done. She took it back. I'm a server myself and I know it's not her fault that the steak came out wrong. Overall, I was very disappointed. Waited 20mins till someone greeted us, got my drink order wrong, and steak was over cooked when asked to have it medium rare.  Never coming back here again."
Brenda C.,"San Antonio, FL",4,3,,1.0,1/28/2017,"If I could give zero stars I would.  Carside to go is an epic fail for this location.  Twice I have come here and after waiting twenty minutes had to go in and get my food.  Totally defeating the purpose of Carside to go... To top it off, get back in the car and they had screwed up the order and had to go back inside.  Don't want to sound lazy, but the whole purpose of that sales gimmick is so the customer doesn't have to go inside.  What if I were in my PJ'S...?"
Shakthi G.,"Los Angeles, CA",110,38,26,5.0,11/13/2016,One of the best Applebee's I've visited till date in America! Great service. I visited on a saturday night and the vibe here was great. I ordered the Crispy Brewhouse Chicken and it was perfect.
Robert G.,"Brandon, FL",4,1,,1.0,1/7/2017,Absolute worst dining experience ever. Four out of six people at the table did not have their orders come out correctly which is bad enough but when you attempt to have the orders corrected you get accused of being racist because you complained that is inexcusable. When then on duty mananger is indifferent to the situation it gets even worse. This was my last visit to this or any Applebee's. YES I AM THAT UPSET!
Chris B.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",23,4,3,2.0,2/5/2016,"Just went there tonight with a couple of friends and we were actually very surprised that there was a ""VJ"" from 93.3 there. It wasn't a pleasant surprise, but it's not the fault of the store that we didn't enjoy it. However, it is very odd to have any form of loud music in such a closed space. I suppose it creates more of a bar experience to bring in a younger crowd, being so close to the university. Above all else, my main complaints are about the food. How much can I expect from an Applebee's? How much can I expect from a Chili's or a TGI Friday's in general? As these restaurants all share the same characteristics in terms of quality and variety, I normally group these together. Come to think of it, I've never once thought to myself, ""Man, am I really craving [blank] from Applebee's,"" or ever thought about recommending it. Not only was the food lackluster, it was straight bad. The wings that I ordered had a decent at best honey barbecue glaze, but the main problem was that it tasted like it was mostly breading. Like they had retrieved old bones from the trash, breaded it again, and fried and glazed them. There was hardly any meat. The fries that my friend got with his burger had obviously been sitting out for awhile because they were lukewarm, dry, and chewy. Everything is really expensive considering the quality that you receive for your dollar. I'm not sure if it's the recipes that Applebee's provides or the management that makes it this way, but I am appalled that anyone with a sense of taste can enjoy a meal there. Perhaps they were busy, perhaps they were short staffed. I won't be returning to investigate any further. I would not recommend this restaurant to anybody.  The only thing they got right was the draft Yuengling. But even then, at 2 for 1, the beer was still about $6, which must have incredible margins seeing as how there's a factory just a few miles out."
Scottie M.,"Orlando, FL",64,9,4,1.0,2/20/2016,"Ordered online: sweet potato fries appetizer, a side of fries, and chips and salsa What I got: 10 sweet potato fries, a bag of french fries, and smashed chip crumbs with some dry salsa"
Mel A.,"Sarasota, FL",1,2,,1.0,12/1/2016,"Save your time and money and don't visit this location. Worse service by waitress. She was not only rude but very inefficient. Meal orders wrong, drink orders wrong and she showed no interested in fixing the issue. Go somewhere else, save yourself the trouble.  Manager Dave"
Marilyn T.,"Tampa, FL",0,1,,3.0,5/30/2017,"Food fair although French Onion Soup is excellent.  Service average on all occasions we have been there,  My problem is why, when you have a glass of wine with lunch is it so expensive Almost $10 for an average glass, more then my lunch, seem a little steep."
Hilda J.,"Tampa, FL",57,1,,2.0,6/4/2017,So I just left applebees and Fabiola aka fab was our waitress and she was horrible if u get fab don't be glad
Brittany N.,"Tampa, FL",36,170,22,3.0,4/19/2015,"The only reason I go to this place is for half off apps after ten.  I ocassionaly get the 2 for one drinks, but the kne drink is pricey so you are pretty much paying for both.  The atmosphere is nice, and they remodeled it with a fresh look which is more appealing.   I usually get boneless wings, and they are good, but sometimes not fully covered in sauce.   I would go to applebees more often, however, the items I like on tge menu are pricey and prefer to go when apps are half priced."
Jazmine O.,"Tampa, FL",0,3,,4.0,4/21/2016,"Good place to go. They are always busy so I can't complain about waiting. Some of the servers are better than others. I like that they have a VJ but the speakers are right at some of the booths and it prevents you from having a decent conversation. Food portions are sometimes off depending on who is cooking but I've never had any terrible experience. Like I said, this place is right near USF so if there is a wait, I know I will be waiting. That's just life.  As far as food goes, the Quesadilla burger is not worth it. They got rid of a lot of their half priced apps, but replaced it with some other menu that's pretty decent in prices and offerings. The wonton tacos are delicious though."
Steve C.,"Wesley Chapel, Tampa Bay, FL",318,130,200,3.0,3/26/2016,"There's a reason they call it Crapplebees. I only went because Stevie picked the place after his baseball game. Everything o. The menu is so average and stale. They try to kick it up with fresh sounding ingredients but it falls short of hitting the mark. I had the quesadilla burger which was seated nicely with a crust but extremely greasy. The mac n cheese was exactly what they said it was, Kraft from the box. Truth in advertising. It's serviceable food but $53 for 4 of us to eat an average lunch is unacceptable. Lower your prices to meet the level of food you serve. $12 for a Drama burger? Yes. $12 for Crapplebees burger? Heck no!"
Paul B.,"Tampa, FL",50,1,,1.0,5/15/2016,I go there and it seems everytime something is messed up. One time I sat for 15 minutes and never was waited on.  I'm a party of one and do the 2 for 25 w beer. 32 bucks. And I get treated badly. Today I oder and the meal came before the salad. They have the manager bring it out after I finally get my app. He doesn't even mention the incident.  No I'm sorries.  It's been 5 months since I've been here. It was the usual yuck.
Kobe L.,"Port Richey, FL",0,10,3,3.0,8/17/2016,food was good but def not enough honey chicken with that huge plate of mac n cheese.  the sweet tea tasted so bad i sent it back and got a soda.
Tommy R.,"Tampa, FL",4,31,,2.0,5/23/2016,"Very slow service. I've gone here a few times, as I went to USF. Multiple times the staff screwed up my order. Staff, however, is friendly. Just inefficient."
Mark H.,"Elfers, FL",61,1531,5405,3.0,11/19/2012,"Meh.  Service and food were all good, but the place just didn't have the classic Applebee's vibe.  Decor was way off.  It felt more like a sports bar.  I'd go to a sports bar if I wanted my eyes abused by Bucs and Rays murals. LOL We still got and enjoyed the half-priced apps."
A H.,"Tampa, FL",0,8,,1.0,11/25/2016,"I used to visit this Applebees on a weekly basis during my college years. I can't say that I was picky about my food during that time. I would get one of the appetizers and a drink and call it a day. Seemed good to me during that time. However, during my most recent visits, I realized that the quality of Applebees consisting of the service and the food has significantly decreased. For example, I decided to treat my mother to Applebees during the 6:00 p.m. dinner service. We were promptly seated. Looking around the area in which my mother and I were sitting in, which consisted of about 6 tables there were napkins, crayons, silverware, crumbs, and bite size pieces of food all over the floor. It certainly was not busy considering that only two tables were occupied in my section. The party directly across from me ordered hot water and soaked their silverware in it. This is just to give you an idea of how dirty the area was.  I ordered the mild boneless chicken wings as an appetizer. I don't understand how something could have looked so unappetizing. I understand that chicken wings are just glorified chicken nuggets, but all the cooks did is cook a bunch of small boneless chicken wing pieces and tossed them in the sauce. I also ordered the Signature Sirloin w/ Garlic Herb Shrimp. I couldn't even finish the entire meal. The cheese on top of the sirloin was so overpowering. It ruined the flavor of the steak and looked really gross. My mother ordered the double crunch shrimp. It seemed to be the only appealing thing that we ordered, so I just ate some of her food. I won't be back."
Marie J.,"Tampa, FL",29,3,,2.0,12/11/2016,"Food was fast, but service was poor.  The phone literally rang the entire time we were there.  No one answered it, and apparently they don't have an answering service so it just rings and rings and rings.  Our server took my glass to refill it and forgot to bring it back.  When it was time to pay we wanted nothing more than to leave as our heads were hurting from the phones ringing relentlessly, but our server was no where to be found.  Server never took any plates off the table, we had to flag him down to ask for boxes and the check (he then said we could pay on the machine on the table)."
Julie J.,"Tampa, FL",28,40,73,4.0,3/28/2016,Curbside online order. Was ready when stated. Attendant came out promptly asked my name and bought out my food a minute later. I ordered the 2 for 20. 1 appetizer spinach & artichoke dip with chips 2x burger quesadilla made medium pink meat side of fries. No complaints!
Lisa M.,"Plant City, FL",0,34,,2.0,2/19/2015,"Odd is about the best description of my visit to Applebee's.  We came in and were seated right away.  Then we requested our server with their fancy new electronic menu/games/etc. gizmo.  Nothing.  Then we requested our server from an actual human being (after I had to attempt to get her attention three times).  Finally he showed up.  About 30 seconds before we were getting ready to leave.  He took our order and the food arrived sooner than our server did. My husband had a steak, mashed potatoes and corn.  He said the steak was good.  The corn tasted like it had been in a pot of hot water all day.  The potatoes were dry and stale...definitely from a box.  My husband said it was the worst mashed potatoes he'd ever had.  For the price, it should have been a lot better.   I had pot stickers and chicken casadillas.   They were pretty good. I've had better at other Applebee's.  This one is some-timey.  Sometimes it's good, sometimes it not.  They need to get their act together."
Gigi S.,"New Port Richey, Tampa Bay, FL",271,654,1073,3.0,8/13/2013,"These three stars are for the awesome veggie patch pizzas served here which aren't on the menu and even if they were it's possible the thugged out clientele here wouldn't care about it anyway!  Dear sweet Applebees on Fowler in the armpit of Trampa-  It's not entirely your fault that people would rather frequent you in sleep attire, I feel ya. I got nuthin but love for ya!"
James G.,"Parrish, FL",0,5,1,2.0,12/21/2015,"This Applebee's is just as bad as the rest of slop-pits in the vein of the ""family neighborhood bar"" themes. The drinks are expensive, the service is sub-standard (nearly sub-human), and the Riblets are a serious choking hazard. As I ate my overpriced, over sauced mystery meat, I kept pulling out scissor sharp bone discs out from my disappointed mouth. If I had a small child, I'd be very worried of potential injuries that might ensue due to the sword-like vertebrae that you find in these disgusting excuse for BBQ. Stick to the Cici's in the corner of the same plaza. The food is excellent and the wait staff is almost entirely clean looking."
Taylor R.,"Tallahassee, FL",7,11,16,3.0,5/21/2014,"I've been to this Applebee's quite a few times because it's close by. I've never expected much due to its location. The service is never that good but it's conflicting because the servers are nice and the price is right. Normally there's a wait, tonight there wasn't. Our server was a little rude at first but ended up giving us free French fries so I can't really complain. Never that impressed with the food, it tastes cheap, but you get what you pay for. The drinks are always good tho."
Natasha P.,"Tampa, FL",98,208,163,3.0,5/21/2013,Very good deal on the chicken wings. This is a good family place. I went to my friends grandmothers birthday there. The service was quick and friendly.
Janna N.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",0,74,5,1.0,2/13/2016,"Run! Do not walk, run away from this place!  We arrived at 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon. Took 10 minutes to get a seat. We ordered an appetizer, and waited 25 minutes before finally canceling it. The rest of our party arrived and we ordered dinner. There were six of us altogether. After 35 minutes the dinner salads arrived, and within three minutes two of the dinners arrived. The other four of us sat and stared for another 10 minutes before our meals arrived. Absolutely and impossibly bad service. To add insult to injury, at 25% mandatory tip was added to our bill. Stay far away. There are plenty of choices in the area other than this sad chain."
Alex R.,"Tampa, FL",11,1,,5.0,6/5/2015,"We have being here couple time we as for a great server kagan, and we are going again we always get the 2 for 20 or 25 it's a great deal, the food taste delicious I love it there the atmosphere is great  Tv on each corner so is great ;)"
Susan B.,"Hampton, VA",54,11,,1.0,5/21/2013,"I will never return to this location. I realize that this location is located right next to USF, so there will be lots of college kids, but I NEVER expected to walk in and not be able to hear a damn thing due to a DJ blasting music. I was staying in a nearby hotel and needed something to eat. My choices were limited at 10 pm at night and I didn't was fast food.  The staff was quite rude when we asked for a table outside. I'm hard of hearing and I'd rather not lose anymore hearing from that loud music, plus my boyfriend couldn't even hear a word I said."
Jude B.,"Apollo Beach, FL",285,515,4184,4.0,12/5/2013,"Ian was our server everything came out as described and timely and hot.  Paid special attention to make sure nothing was sitting at the table, and drinks were full.  Great service!"
Dee P.,"Peabody, MA",0,7,,3.0,1/28/2016,"You have to really careful with the new trivia / video games units they are placing on the tables, if you start playing one, a fee is added to you bill. For us that was both a surprise and a disappointment. The manager showed us the fine print which tells you a fee is added to your bill."
Danesh J.,"Jersey City, NJ",174,379,463,2.0,7/2/2011,"It offers more variety than other sit-down restaurants, but the quality is really, REALLY lacking.  My partner ordered a Long Island and it tasted like Windex. The server did everything she could to accommodate for the poor quality. We ordered a bunch of appetizers for the half-off apps they have at night. It's a nice option to have. You defiantly get more mozzarella sticks on the half-off option.  Overall, it's a nice place and good service, but the quality of the food is lacking, greatly."
Terinee B.,"Washington, DC",2128,538,3725,4.0,9/28/2010,I had a great time at this Applebees!  The service is prompt (partly due to the call button that you have on your table to alert your server that you need help).  I would definitely go back again!  You can't beat those late night 1/2 price appetizers!!!
Dawn P.,"Lutz, FL",218,61,11,2.0,9/20/2014,Poor service....the waitress acted like we werent even there. She didnt smile or anything. I was very disappointd with my visit. I wont be back anytime soon. A very disappointed customer.
