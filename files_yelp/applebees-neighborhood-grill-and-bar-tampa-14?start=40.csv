Alysia E.,"Tampa, FL",0,22,,2.0,3/17/2014,"This apple bees is a joke. Was once on dirty dining  for having roaches all over! If you go there after 10 it will be extremely loud music, and lots of rude people screaming eating and dancing. Service is really slow so make sure you get your 2 for 1 drinks right away. Our waitress was friendly but sucked at the service part. We ordered 3 appetizers and by the time she checked on us we were still waiting on the 3rd which never came out. Lousy service always but cheap and good drinks!"
Collin S.,"Tampa, FL",384,198,147,2.0,5/13/2011,"The death of decent food in America, combined with lousy service, makes this place horrendous. But their happy hour specials are super cheap, so they avoid the dreaded one star at least from me. Everything you'll order, including the steaks, tastes like it's fresh out of the microwave. Your vegetables will be more limp than Hugh Hefner without Viagra. I haven't ever had anything there that wasn't bland or had any flavor. Even the spicy chicken pasta leans more heavily on just a spicy seasoning to make it seem like it has more depth than salt, but it fails terribly. What makes this location so bad is the service. I've been sitting at the bar and unable to pay my check for 10 minutes. Plus the side tables around the main bar area are very hit and miss. Sometimes you get a good server that's friendly and attentive, but too often it's someone that has too many tables (remember that's not their fault, that falls to management) or a kid that could have been cast in the movie Waiting.  I don't just rip chains because they're chains, as I'm an unabashed fan of places like Carrabba's and Lee Roy Selmon's. But this one is the bottom of the barrel."
Jorge R.,,1,44,,1.0,11/4/2013,Keep in mind this Applebee's was shut down for a while for health inspection violations (on multiple occasions) trust me be careful. Drinks aren't bad but remember it's a major chain it's decent but nothing special. I honestly haven't been back since I found out that this was the second or third time that they were shut down for MULTIPLE days!
Nicole Leigh S.,"Tampa, FL",376,221,262,3.0,2/4/2011,"I used to work at this location and while I do love the Applebee's drink and food specials I do not feel terribly engaged . The staff is disinterested and rude most of the time.  Fact is it's a chain and I'm not really into chains. Never have been. Never will be. But for the most part I don't mind coming in, throwing down a few dollars and enjoying friend's company."
Nathan B.,"Tampa, FL",199,58,19,3.0,2/3/2011,"Went here for a UYE continuation after Mel's closed. None of us were hungry so we just took advantage of the 2-4-1 drafts and chewed the fat. The place was pretty full but not over-flowing.  The staff didn't seem super enthusiastic, but they did their jobs. Just as were getting ready to leave the music got really loud and it looked like they were setting up for karaoke.... and odd choice for an Applebee's but, whatever."
Corine C.,"Silver Spring, MD",100,61,1,4.0,11/7/2011,"All you can eat lunch (soup & Salad w/ garlic bread)!!  (-__-)#fatkid4lifeFace ... the Sante Fe Chicken Salad was great (had 2 of those), the oriental salad was OK and almost all the soups are great ... YES, I tried ALL the soups ... Dont Judge Me... Had to get my ""$8.99 all you can eat"" money's worth. #brokecollegestudentSwag"
Deborah M.,"Tampa, FL",2,27,11,5.0,2/2/2014,No wait for a table and it was Game Night for the Superbowl. Had speedy service and our server John was great. I had the Double Crunch Shrimp and it was just right.
David B.,"Tampa, FL",8,54,12,5.0,6/22/2011,"Even though this place Is always packed at night. I feel they are very efficient in their service and work ethic. I always come into the restaurant with over 8 people. But even though the wait is always 30+min, it's well worth it!  I give it 5 stars because for the amount of people this place sees after 10pm, they are very good with customer service and getting people their food."
Ray C.,"Denver, CO",25,190,113,3.0,10/30/2012,"My friend and I went out to this Applebees restaurant. It was just OK because of the chicken I got on my Oriental Chicken salad was cold. My friend got his chicken tenders and fries. His fries was horrible because of TOO MUCH salt and seasonal and he requested for a replacement of his fries and it was better.  We learned that it depends on the cookers who made our dinner. Our server was just OK.    I would grade this restaurant  a ""C"" ."
Drop Dead Divas Accessories And M.,"Tampa, FL",18,19,1,5.0,11/13/2012,"Great place to hang out with my girlfriends, we have a ball on Thursdays Girlfriend's night out..... We can not complain... always great serve and the managers are always around to make sure that your serve is exceptional.... Thursdays!!!!!!..."
Regina K.,"Lutz, FL",3,8,4,4.0,9/19/2012,Remodel looks great!! Nice open bar now. Great food and bar service is friendly.
Carlos H.,"Tampa, FL",3388,792,1522,4.0,4/16/2009,We usually hit Applebee's up for their appetizer special after 10PM. Half-priced appetizers is an awesome deal that we take of advantage of all the time. Waitresses and waiters seem slightly annoyed by the college crowd but are still pretty friendly. I like to order nachos as my meal normally and karaoke nights are awesome as well.
Don W.,"Murfreesboro, TN",4,29,,3.0,3/28/2014,"Several ethnic groups dominated bar, thus preferences service. Felt was not welcomed. Food good, beer cold....when we could get one."
Travis M.,"Tampa, FL",17,31,29,4.0,12/4/2009,About a year ago this place was horrible . But it has got new management and has improved a great deal . 2 for 1 is a good deal as well as 2 for 20$ and half of appitizers after 10pm .
