Scott D.,"Temecula, CA",17,80,634,3.0,10/19/2017,"I must admit I haven't been to Applebee's in years.  Decided to give them a try tonight out of a since of nostalgia.  I used to go often in the late 80's/early 90s - Wow!  Bottom line, it wasn't bad.  It certainly isn't a culinary event, but it was adequate for tonight. It was good for what it is - casual dinning.  Greeted quickly at the door and had a prompt and mindful waiter, Kurt. I had the grilled chicken with bacon beer cheese topper, mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. The chicken was tender and the flavors were very complementary. I would give them a 3.5 if it were an option."
Marissa F.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",0,3,1,1.0,1/1/2018,"Being a vegetarian, it's already hard trying to find things to eat at restaurants that don't cater to that. Not once, but now twice i have ordered a salad for takeout and they put bacon bits on it. At first glance you can't see them because they blend in with the tomato, until I get home and sit down to eat and realize I have to throw my entire dinner away. Glad I wasted time and now have no dinner."
C J.,"Temecula, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/31/2017,"Worst ever! Ordered ribs to go. When arrived to take out looked at them. Glad I did! No meat and dry. Sent back. Then they ""comp"" me by giving me tough cold ribs. Tough because they just took them from freezer and warmed them up on the grill with some sauce. Cold and tough! Ugh. Will NEVER be back. Would rather drive a few more miles for ribs from Chili's . Management at the Applebee's in Temecula on 79 needs to find a real cook and teach the help what decent food is! No wonder no one was there for dinner or even the bar!!! Hate this place!!!!"
Nilo S.,"San Diego, CA",0,24,3,5.0,8/30/2017,I come here about 4 times a month since it's close to my house always good service Melinda the bartender is always on point with her service and lovely lady . One complain i have is wifi is very slow and usually don't work .
Norma T.,"Temecula, CA",73,4,9,3.0,9/2/2017,"Do Not!! Ever come here for a birthday dinner, they are the worst. Very unorganized and just not accommodating at all...my poor daughter was left with a brownie and melted ice cream while they rounded up people to sing...which never Happened. It was a very awkward and sad experience for my daughter. Nothing went well here... our waitress Angela was very nice and tried to help. Won't be coming back here again."
RJ S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,62,23,1.0,4/23/2017,"Since when did it become unacceptable for a restaurant to ask a couple to quiet their screaming baby while sitting in the BAR area?  This was absurd. The baby was screaming when this couple came into the restaurant. They didn't sit in the restaurant.... They sat in the bar area because they wanted happy hour prices, which is fine because you can't get happy hour prices unless you were sitting in the bar area. But why is a baby even allowed in the bar area?  Maybe you should offer happy hour prices to families that are sitting in your ""restaurant"" area so adults that are sitting in your ""bar"" will actually come back. I felt like I was at Chuck-E-Cheese. I couldn't enjoy my food. Why a manager never came into this area is beyond me. You could hear this child scream from the freeway. I asked to have my entree removed. My husband took his sandwich in grief. The plastic box split open as we were walking into the parking lot, the food went everywhere they didn't even secure the lid. Everything but my margarita should have been comped. But I can't even say the $30 was a waste of money because I was expecting drive-thru quality food, and sugary pre-mixed drinks. I literally had to go downtown and get a proper drink because I couldn't handle my life after this experience. Forget your curbside to go and just hook a drive-thru on the back. Because that's what you are."
G E.,"Temecula, CA",52,4,,3.0,10/13/2017,It's your typical Applebee's. Services varies by each one and this one was okay. Had to ask numerous times for napkins and other things.
Andrea P.,"Aguanga, CA",0,11,1,4.0,10/19/2017,My husband and I love the French onion soup here.  It is one of the best French onion soups in the Temecula area. I like to order the maple salmon which is excellent.  My other favorite is the Oriental chicken salad.  My husband likes the 4 cheese Mac and cheese with honey pepper chicken tenders (it has bacon too) . We eat here a lot and the service is good although the kitchen can be a little slow.  We like to eat outside on the patio.  No one else ever seems to choose to sit out there so it's very private.
Karis A.,"Murrieta, CA",79,32,5,4.0,8/19/2017,"My husband and I stopped in here with our son for a quick, early dinner with our son as we had received a gift card that we thought we would use. The service was timely and friendly, and the food came quick and was yummy. We enjoyed the meal!"
Maria S.,"San Clemente, CA",0,1,,2.0,9/22/2017,"Service was alright, I know they don't really have a choice of who you're seated next to but there were hardly any people and they sat us in some weird half booth next to the loudest people in the place. Personally, I didn't enjoy eating my food next to people talking about C-sections and UTI's. Also, didn't give a head up on charging for refills for lemonade but kept bringing them to the table. Way to make an extra 10$ I guess."
Tinky R.,"Temecula, CA",6,302,10,1.0,1/3/2017,"Good lord...if any place is worse than The Bank- it's Applebees. This place needs a Bar Rescue episode to roll up. Please, please , please...close this place and bring in a Cracker Barrel...even a Waffle House would work."
Krystle G.,"Temecula, CA",15,13,11,5.0,8/26/2017,"I love coming to this Applebee's. It's nice to come around 3-4pm for lunch or an early dinner. It's usually nice and quiet. At least every time I go, it is lol anyways Frances the waitress is so nice and kind. I would recommend asking for her to be your waitress, she takes good care of you :)"
Sandra M.,"Murrieta, CA",2,26,10,2.0,10/22/2017,Food was mediocre at best.  Ask for onion rings and was charged extra with telling us.  Waitress was very good not her fault food wasn't the best.
Molly O.,"Temecula, CA",0,23,,2.0,10/11/2017,"Me and my girlfriends wanted to go out tonight to hang out and take advantage of their $1 margaritas, we went in had dinner had some margaritas when a lady came in saying someone's car was broken into with their window smashed. Unfortunately, it ended up being one of my girlfriends car that got broken into :( we went out took pics of it and the manager came out after saying he was gonna call The cops for us. He called the cops and literally disappeared!!! Talked to the police then vanished. My two girlfriends were out there giving the police info while I stayed back inside at our booth. Not a single time did the waitress or manager, Vincent, come up to ask if we were ok or if we needed water or anything. Look, I'm not blaming Applebee's for the robbery. It's not the managers fault that someone broke into a customers car , but as a manager myself and working in customer service for over 5 years, I would NEVER not accommodate the customer to my best ability. We aren't looking for a free meal or a discount, all we wanted was someone to  ask if we were ok or needed any assistance. It was completely disrespectful and honestly horrible that a manager couldn't even show compassion for his customers. It's great that they are doing $1 margaritas for the month to remind people they are also a bar, but what they really need to re focus on is their customer service skills."
Britney M.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",217,625,1057,3.0,11/30/2016,"Alright well I'm not a huge fan of Applebee's to begin with. But I'll do my best to provide an unbiased review just based on the food itself. I will say that anyone who is a vegetarian is going to have a hard time finding something on the menu. There isn't a lot of vegetarian options at Applebee's. Anyway they do have the 2 for $20 deal so that is a positive. Saving money is always a good thing. I did the 2fer deal with my mom; we went with Caesar salad for the appetizer, Mac n cheese with no chicken for the entree. Let's start with the Caesar salad. It was super basic. Minimal amount of croutons and grated cheese; and for me it hardly had any dressing at all. I had to ask for an extra saucer of dressing for both of the salads because they were dry. Next the pasta was decent. It tasted pretty good- I mean without the chicken it was basically noodles, sauce, and tomatoes. So it was a bit plan but there wasn't any other veggie options. The waitress brought out everyone's food but made the wrong dish for me. They mixed up my order with someone else's. So I munched on my salad while everyone started their entrees. Not a big deal but if I didn't have an appetizer salad that would have been uncomfortable to sit there with no food while everyone else was eating. Lastly the brownie dessert with hot fudge and ice cream was my favorite menu item at Applebee's. I might go back JUST for that dessert lol overall I most likely would not go back, or go to any Applebee's by choice lol But if I find myself here in the future- I will just get that fudge brownie as my meal! Lol"
April W.,"Oceanside, CA",72,293,116,5.0,5/30/2017,"Nice quiet afternoon meal, on a holiday with my kids. Didn't know this restaurant was here. Will have to plan another trip here soon. Service was good. Food was good."
Ashley H.,"Denver, CO",8,45,18,5.0,5/1/2017,"First time eating here and my boyfriend and I had a pleasant experience. Sunday night at 830; wasn't busy like a lot of other places. We sat at the bar and Ashley was an absolute doll! She made she we were taken care of in a timely manner and made sure we enjoyed our meals and drinks. My boyfriend got the new long island drink and he said it tasted just like candy! But unfortunately he ate too much, too fast and just couldn't finish it haha! We will definitely be returning again in the future. Thank you Ashley!"
Xena V.,"Temecula, CA",189,29,2,4.0,4/9/2017,"Had a grilled steak salad. Perfectly cooked and seasoned steak, salad was tasty and dressed perfectly. Watermelon sangria light and refreshing. Watermelon margarita is much lighter in watermelon flavor but still very good."
Anna C.,"Homestead, FL",525,287,998,5.0,2/27/2016,"I don't remember the last time I was at an Applebee's. So, when I drove by, it brought back fond memories of my friends and I having dinner at an Applebee's. And, that is how I made the decision to dine here. It was about 7p.m. at night, and we were seated quickly. After we were shown our table, we wanted to wash our hands first. The bathroom was beyond pleasant, clean, and fully stocked. When we returned, Lyndsey R waited on us right away. She was very friendly to my son, and I appreciated her friendliness. I ordered the Sizzling Bourbon St. Chicken and Shrimp $13.75, and I split it with my son.  He said it was delicious, and I agreed with him. I initially thought this entree would be spicy, but Lyndsey assured me that it is not. And, it is the number 1 question she receives about this dish. I was pleasantly surprised on how efficient and friendly Lyndsey was as our waitress. I will say that she made our dining experience a very pleasant one. Thank you."
Richard R.,"Palm Springs, CA",498,524,1588,2.0,3/9/2016,"I do enjoy Applebees late night happy hour, but this time it was not that great of an experience.  There was only bartender on a Saturday night, the manager was washing dishes, took forever to get a drink, if it was remembered and the food was ok, seemed to just be off a hair.  Dont think I'll be stopping by this one again.  Two stars because the two people working were working their butts off and the bartender was very friendly."
Amber L.,"San Pedro, CA",574,330,7123,5.0,2/22/2015,"I've been to this Applebee's on several occasions. Temecula is like a second home to me. I come out here at least once a month. There are many good places to eat and this Applebee's is one of them. I really love their spinach and artichoke dip. It's super cheesy, flavorful and always comes out piping hot. Its served with house-made chips and salsa. They have the 2 for $20 or 2 for $25 specials for lunch. There are many dishes to choose from and with those specials, you get an appetizer to share and a meal for you and another person. Every appetizer and meal in the regular menu isn't available on the special ""2 for"" menu and they won't allow you to substitute.  I also like that their menu has Weight Watcher points for several different plates. I'm not on Weight Watchers, but seeing it in the menu makes me conscious of what I'm ordering and ""sometimes"" make better choices. Service has always been great! From the time that we've walked in and been seated until we left, I have never experienced any issues. The food is always good and pretty much exactly what I expected when I ordered it."
India R.,"Temecula, CA",47,13,1,5.0,3/27/2017,I just did a carside to go pick up and it was fast and on time!! Incredible service and the food was so good!
Mike P.,"Temecula, CA",11,2,9,1.0,1/4/2017,"Order on a curbside an Steak Caesar Salad n when we got home it only had 6 very small pieces of steak for $10.+ what a rip off, never going there again"
Lisa M.,"Temecula, CA",41,6,,1.0,1/28/2017,Service was outstanding!  Our waitress could not have been more attentive!  The food was awful!  Four out of the five members of our party were extremely disappointed with our food!  The chunks of steak in my dish were nothing but chunks of fat.  It was disgusting!  We live very close to Applebee's!  This was my 3rd attempt in 7 years to eat here and yet again I was extremely disappointed!  I will not return again!  There is just far to much competition to eat at a restaurant that charges $13+ a plate to be this disappointed!  You really need a professional chef to come in and change your recipes.  Three visits spread out over a 7 year span is was more than enough time for you guys to get your act together!  This is what puts businesses out of business!
Rodney Y.,"San Diego, CA",67,4,,4.0,5/25/2017,Amazing French onion soup. Will order this again. Service was amazing as well. Had a great waitress. Will eat here again.
Sam D.,"Temecula, CA",4,5,7,1.0,10/7/2017,"Let start by saying this place is the .....WORSE and that's putting it mildly. My hubby and I went there a couple of nights ago and it was GREAT (Service was on point and waitress very ATTENTIVE. We decided to go back on Saturday 10/7/17 around 4 is PM after I got off work tired and just wanted to chill with the babe before he goes to work later....we came in and sat at a booth by the bar and waited like 5-10min while waitresses were going back and forth without any acknowledgment of any sort (not even the offer of water and it was super HOT like in the triple digits). When we came in the booth in front of us was DIRTY after a couple finished their meal.....after a few moment a NEW couple came in after we had been there for like 10 min..... and as soon as they sat down a waitress came rushing to take their orders all smiling and giggley.....and I was like wtf  ""excuse me...."" she turned around (like what the hell are calling me for) as if I was bothering her at that point my husband was soooo MAD  and frustrated that he was like ""let's go, I guess our money ain't good enough here for their services"" and walked out. Honestly I have NEVER felt so disrespected, you are in the business of hospitality and customers service and if you're staffs suck at it then maybe you need to re-evaluate and fire them or retrain them otherwise you're going to keep LOSING customers ‍‍"
Tisha B.,"Temecula, CA",15,12,,2.0,4/20/2017,"We came for Dinner and I ordered the bourbon chicken, I've had it a few other times.. it comes on a hot plate, my food was so over cooked, that my chicken was like Chicken jerky and my potatoes were dried out and tasteless..my husband's dinner was alright, but not enough to fill him up, and he's a thin man.  Overall, the place is always short staffed and slow service.. we won't be back."
Matt V.,"Temecula, CA",21,502,32,4.0,9/28/2015,"I gotta give these guys props for a half dozen meals here that left us satisfied every time, including last night where there was a ""hiccup"" during our meal. We had the bourbon steak and the lime chicken with an iced tea and Shocktop on tap and a side Caesar salad to split. My steak was tasty and juicy, cooked just the way I asked. (Medium) The sauteed onions and mushrooms were a nice touch and the red potatoes rounded out the meal. My wife noticed immediately that the rice on her plate was crunchy dry, inedible really...Once we got the managers' attention and told him about it, we asked for some fries instead which he brought out. Our server came by in a bit and said he noticed we had a problem, explained the rice problem and he came back with another side of fries. My wife DID like the lime chicken! With the salad and fries she was a satisfied customer again. At the end of the meal our server then brought us a brownie bites dessert, no charge! We did not expect them to do so much to make sure we were happy and going to come back. My wife is very forgiving and rarely has any problems with her food when we go out. We told our server that we really didn't need a desert to get us to come back but it was still a nice gesture. Overall, the food at Applebee's is really average chain fare but when we don't feel like cooking it's a nice place for a decent meal, and we are always well taken care of here so I'm giving 4 stars."
Sam F.,"Temecula, CA",495,72,,1.0,12/6/2016,"I have been here 2 times and both attempts were an absolute fail. The quality of the food is just poor, and the restaurant is filthy, my last visit there stained my my shirt from rubbing up against the table."
Neda Y.,"Temecula, CA",259,106,148,4.0,10/23/2016,"Applebee's is not the ultimate gourmet dinning experience , I tell you what it is ,   Good quick easy dinner solution fairly inexpensive , if you are looking for a place to hang out and have appetizers or drinks their happy hour half price is awesome, steaks are pretty good so are nachos! Must say super friendly staff"
Doug L.,"Temecula, CA",0,2,2,1.0,1/16/2017,"Disappointing meals (4)...simple dishes, pasta for the kids, steak for the adults. Pasta was el dente, but crunchy...the steaks were tasteless as if they were sitting in water overnight. The wait staff was prompt, courteous and apologetic. Replaced the meat, with more of the same.  We did not take the meat home for the dogs... If you like nice people, go. If you want to eat, skip it."
Steve M.,"Temecula, CA",0,19,5,5.0,1/8/2017,"Great Specials, Great food and Ashley C gave us great service!"
Bernard D.,"Anaheim, CA",8,119,154,3.0,6/4/2015,"Came with a party of 8. Service was good; had no problems. Ordered a chicken fajita roll with free refills of fries. $9.99 -Disappointed. Do not order this. It was soggy from some juicing from the vegetables and the portion was very small. Around the size of one fist, but slightly bigger.  -The BBQ-spiced fries are ok. They are regular fries with bbq-spices shaked on top.  Friends enjoyed the burgers and the steak."
Erika W.,"Temecula, CA",15,12,1,2.0,1/25/2016,Went here to have dinner the other night and it was bad service in the beginning and got a little better. We were seating very fast and were given menus and was waiting for our waitress.  We noticed multiple people being seated after about 5 minutes of being there and still hadn't met our waitress. 5 more minutes and she finally comes to the table and seemed to have attitude. Didn't appreciate that. The food was alright and service was average.. Have had better service.
Amy R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,28,5,2.0,6/21/2016,"Let me start off by saying that I've been to my fair share of Applebee's. None like this.  You often enter the front door here, and wait around for someone to seat you, and when you are seated i hope you're not thirsty because it takes about 15 minutes to get drinks. That's been everytime I've come and its been 3-4 times now. When we're seated we're told our servers name is Lyndsay, she came to our table about 10 minutes after being seated and took our drink order. We only saw her one more time when she brought the drinks 5 minutes later. Then we see her sweeping, walking around, cleaning tables and another waitress takes over our table without saying anything. Uh...okay i guess? The new waitress, Alexis is FAST and ON everything you ask for (Shes the only reason i gave 2 stars) The food was as always, i personally like Applebee's food i think it has a good taste, for a good price. My husband and I can order an appetizer, 2 drinks and 2 meals for under $40. I recently ate at Black Angus and spent $66 on food that tasted like dirt, so this food is waaay better than that Black Angus bull$#!+.. Anyways, something happened to me the last time i ate here, that has never happened before... I was up all night vomiting, and i had felt fine before i ate. I don't know what went wrong, to be honest. Besides that, everything tasted good, and after Alexis took over it was quick service."
Katie R.,"Temecula, CA",0,33,7,3.0,3/31/2017,Did an order to go but order was not ready on time. Both items were covered in way too much spinach and both were missing the tomatoes. Very disappointed. The murrieta location is much better and worth the drive.
Holly H.,"Temecula, CA",38,53,14,1.0,11/6/2016,"I am taking to Yelp because I just wrote the same review on Facebook and I think everybody should know. Four months, literally months. I would call in on a Sunday night and order the same thing for my dad. Months. We took a little break to start up again a few weeks ago to find out their menu has changed, but the Alfredo sauce he loved so much was still on the menu. The last two weeks we ordered just plain noodles with two sides of the Alfredo sauce. My dad was so happy. As a creature of habit he was excited to have it again tonight. The manager told the kid who was taking my order, that they can no longer do it because there is no way to input it into the system. Are you fucking kidding me? My dad would've paid for a goddamn porterhouse to get a damn container of the Alfredo sauce. Thank you for disappointing an old man who is such a creature of habit and was looking forward to his favorite meal of the week. Well done Applebee's and the asshole staff that runs it. Customer service right there."
Maria A.,"Temecula, CA",0,52,,4.0,8/29/2016,"Went in the bar area for lunch. ""TONY"" our waiter was EXCELLENT! He was prompt, happy, friendly and very efficient. He made our day! The food was good except for the 2 for 20.00 salads. My son had the steak salad and the steak was like rubber and cold......the same for my old cold hard chicken. When the steak and chicken are grilled and served ""HOT"" that is a GOOD salad. Get rid of the ""SALADS""!"
Matthew H.,"Corona, CA",20,22,7,4.0,3/15/2017,"out of all the Applebee's that I've been to, this one in Temecula has the service and food down correct."
Ember B.,"Temecula, CA",1,17,,3.0,8/25/2016,"The atmosphere is dark and not that great.  The food is ok.  It's one of the only ""sit down"" restaurants in the Southern part of Temecula, so if we don't want fast food we will choose Abblebee's. We probably only go twice a year because it's just ok.  They have a good selection of food, they offer burgers, salads, pasta, chicken, etc."
