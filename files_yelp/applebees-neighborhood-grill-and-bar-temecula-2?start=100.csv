Lauren J.,"Torrance, CA",0,12,3,1.0,10/4/2014,"Our server was nice, but it took over an hour and 1/2 to get our food. We didn't get any refills. We had a couple issues with our food orders. Dessert took another 30 minutes to get! I don't think it was our servers fault, it seemed he had too many tables."
T K.,"Temecula, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/12/2015,"My family and I went to Applebees in Temecula (79S) to celebrate my Grandfathers 88th birthday (party of 9).   We were quickly sat at a table as it was not too busy.  Our drink order was taken at approximately 1:05pm.  We recieved our drinks approximately 10 min after ordering.  We then had to wait an additional 15 minutes before our server took our food order.   After waiting approximately 45 minutes for our food, I asked the server if she could check on our food.  By this time we had all finished our second set of drinks (tea, coffee and soda).  Guests included elderly, middle aged and teenagers.  One hour and ten minutes after we ordered our food, I went up to ask for a manager.  Luckily I didn't have to wait for him as well as he was the person I ran into.  I informed him of the situation and he said he would ""get right on it"".  Approximately, 15 more minutes passed and the food was brought out two people at a time.  However, they forgot my husbands food.  (Not cool, when he's the one flipping the bill).  Manager asked what he had ordered (gee, idk...why don't you look at the order that was initially taken)  within 5 minutes they delivered his plate only to note that the chicken was cold.  (we didn't  say a thing, he probably would have never been able to eat with everyone :-/ )  Needless to say, we were all beyond frustrated and very disappointed on this special occasion.  We could have went to 1909 in Old Town, or any other place, possibly waited 45 minute to be seated (Saturday), paid possibly and addition $20.00 and had an outstanding lunch in a timely manner.  To top it off, at the end of the meal, the manager came over with the bill.  He said, ""I can discount a couple of the entrées for the inconvenience, but when I have offered ""that"" in the past, most people refuse to accept"".  What????  How do you respond to that?  We were not there to get a free meal, we were there to celebrate a birthday, enjoy our family time and eat some good food.  The environment was clean, food (nothing to rave about), service by waitress and management was completely unprofessional and moreover, unacceptable.  We will not be back to this location.  Spend your money wiser, elsewhere."
Mrs.Rosenberg 8.,"Santee, San Diego, CA",1,17,10,1.0,10/24/2012,"Our glasses for our drinks were dirty.. YUCK! Then our silverware were dirty as well. My husbands steak was like a beef patty. The waitresses and waiter were not friendly and very rude toward their manager and customers. The only good thing about this restaurant was the manager Ron.  He seemed to be the only one who cared about his customers and restaurant, and if we are crazy enough to give it a second try, it will be because of Ron."
Durla W.,"Fallbrook, CA",2,6,1,5.0,11/23/2012,"This company offered free meals to Veterans on Veterans day and wow were we thrilled!! Not only a free meal for my dad, he had several options to choose from! The local ROTC was there and the service was excellent!! Thank you!!"
Chaz C.,"San Diego, CA",15,2,,2.0,4/27/2012,Service was reasonable. Food however wasn't up to par. Burnt bread stick and over cooked steak didn't make a good combination. Vegetables and baked potato soaked in butter.
James L.,"Temecula, CA",0,7,1,1.0,6/3/2014,We have watched this Applebee's go down hill for the last 10 years. Food is good like any other Applebee's but the last. 4 times we went the appetizer came long after the meals showed up . Only 1 visit did they apologize. Seems like poor management. Servers are usually nice
M H.,"Temecula, CA",29,9,,4.0,12/6/2013,"I don't really get all of the negative reviews of this place...it's a freaking Applebee's, not Morton's or Ruth's Chris...the food is decent, and the beer is cold. Never had bad service at this location either...."
Codee C.,"Guadalupe, CA",31,70,83,1.0,9/23/2013,"Definitely the worst Applebee's yet! I am not a fan of this joint in general, but when you are looking for a place to please everyone in your group, Applebee's is the go-to place. We went to sit in the bar, and we all kind of just looked at each other making weird faces at one another. This was the most AWKWARD Applebee's bar ever. All I know is during happy hour at the Applebee's back home, it's a little rowdy, football is playing in the background and it's just a fun atmosphere in general. Who in the heck plays 90's contemporary music at midnight at an applebee's? It was just weird. The service was weird too. We ordered a bunch of 1/2 off apps and the food was absolutely horrible. I ordered ranch AND blue cheese with the boneless buffalo wings(supposed to be super hot, no sauce at all), and only got ranch. My dad later ordered the sliders and those never came out. Our waitress left and was M.I.A for about ten or fifteen minutes and she was the only one in the bar at the time. So needless to say, we were waiting for our bill FOREVER. Since my dad picked up the tab, I didn't see if they charged us for the sliders that didn't come out. What a horrible place to be on a Saturday nighT! So glad this isn't my hometown applebee's!"
Luis P.,"Temecula, CA",8,252,20,3.0,9/9/2013,"I can not remember a time when Applebee's was something special, and now even less so, I sadly spent money on this place. At one time they served a decent Onion Soup, but that positive is way in the past, their newer version another sad reminder that this eatery has very few good things to say about it. The Waitress that served us, Tracey g., was a true professional in her demeanor and was rewarded accordingly. Besides her fine service, the food ordered was:  Fish and Chips: at almost $14 a plate it was way overpriced and badly presented. The quality of the food left a lot to be desired, even though their Cole Slaw (of which they serve you such a small serving they must be counting calories in the back) was acceptable. Three pieces of fish, under par fish certainly, with a batter that is a failed formula as far as taste is concerned. Fries are nothing special, look elsewhere for good fish and chips. 2.5 Stars. Cowboy Burger: at $9.99 each, it also lacked the wow factor, and now with fierce competition all over, they did not step up to the plate, they basically keep serving the same bland, uneventful burger. Sizable enough to satisfy the average appetite, the waitress asked if we wanted to include onion rings for an additional $1.75. I do not know why, but it seems that these days the idea of adding fries, onion rings, etc., inside the burger is growing in popularity! As a matter of fact Burger King (possibly now a days one of the less quality burgers available in free America), is including their already highly unappetizing french fries inside a $1 burger. I figure is all about the volume, but little to do with quality taste. Topped with crispy onion strings, bacon and cheese, this one is eatable, but not memorable by any stretch of the imagination. Overprices, average tasting, In and Out down the street puts it to shame for far less $. 3 Stars. Bourbon Black and Bleu Burger, at almost $11 the only thing really attractive is the name. Came with  applewood smoked bacon, bourbon caramelized onions (I do not know exactly what that term is, because what arrived to the table was a gooey, overly cooked, mushy mess for such a fancy way of calling it), jack cheese, bleu cheese crumbles (this bleu cheese was at the bottom of the pecking order as far as Bleu Cheese is concerned) on a toasted bun with smoky mayo (so fancy the title, but so little taste that what is the difference?). A very clear reminder that Applebee's burgers are plain and expensive. 3 Stars at the most. Service was more than adequate, even though we surely waited over 25 minutes for our order to arrive, to the point that the lovely lady in our group suggested she might go to the kitchen to speed up things, she being such a bad cook herself. To be blunt but honest, most of these so called national franchises leave you feeling like you could have done much better spending the same amount at Costco, per say, and end up eating so much better for less money. Of course the old tradition of being served is attractive, but not one of the three in our party had enjoyment eating at Applebee's. This is officially the very last time. We already given this place way too many chances to no avail. 3 Stars barely."
Brandon W.,"Oceanside, CA",70,10,,2.0,4/26/2011,"I have been going here for a couple years, it started great but over time it became worse until my last stay was the end of it. We waited for an hour just to get a waiter to take our drinks. Once he took our order for drinks, he never came back for another hour. I requested to speak to the manager, she was very kind and made sure we got another waiter. Once we put in our food order we waited another hour for our food to get to us. When our food got to us the steak was cold and my dates food had a hair in it. I was very disappointed and the Manager took good care of us, but the rest of the service was the worst I have ever experienced. I wish I didnt have to experience this, but I wont be going back."
Haolinh Y.,"Temecula, CA",16,10,1,1.0,9/19/2013,We've been here a few times now and each time we've gotten worse and worse service. I feel like this place is severely under staffed even when's its completely empty! I would have given them half a star if I could. Needs to get some quicker waitresses and waiters.
Wayne W.,"Fontana, CA",44,164,175,5.0,5/28/2011,"We went to Temecula to see the Goo Goo Dolls at Pechanga Casino, and had some time to spare before. We went to Applebee's, and I had to give props to them. That was one of the best dinners I've ever had. We had Parmesan Steak & Shrimp, and Cajun Steak and Shrimp. Both were fabulous. Our server was awesome, and the appetizer platter was great too. I really don't get the previous reviews. If you are going to the casino, and don't want to eat at the Casino, pop over to Applebee's."
Valerie R.,"Oceanside, CA",0,25,2,2.0,8/24/2013,Only thing that was great here was the boneless wings but other than that I ordered the sandwich and the bread was way too hard. I couldn't really each much of it cause it cut the roof of my mouth. Probably only coming back for the boneless to go.
Anonymous Y.,"Temecula, CA",0,35,3,1.0,9/2/2010,I've eaten at Applebees maybe 3 times since they've been in Temecula. Each time I was wholly disappointed in the food. I ate there tonight because we hadn't been there in several years and I thought maybe it had changed and give it another try. I spent $65 on the worst food ever. The grilled chicken sandwhich was totally tasteless and dry. My husband ordered a reuben sandwich - also tasteless. The food even LOOKS unappetizing when comes to the table. It looks like what you could order in the food line at a hospital. I will NEVER go back again. I don't know how they stay in business with tasteless food with no eye appeal whatsever. The waitress was good though. It's not her fault the food is awful.
Jennifer R.,"Temecula, CA",26,27,3,1.0,5/11/2011,"Never again . Service was horrible, waiter forgot everything I asked for . He was rude and the Cajun shrimp was disgusting, had them take it back and ordered something else . Ruined my wedding anniversary . Boo you Applebee's !"
Carlos F.,"Temecula, CA",0,5,,2.0,6/9/2011,"meh, food not that great, service is ok, but tired of getting tip raped from fundraiser groups they keep hosting.  Don't plan on going back, I'll spend my time and money elsewhere."
