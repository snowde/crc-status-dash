Evie D.,"Corona, CA",55,8,1,1.0,6/26/2015,"We walked in and they weren't too busy so we sat at a booth. The server was very quick to get our drink orders. When he came back with the drinks, he took our order. We had a very hungry 3-year-old and asked the waiter if they could rush his food. The waiter assured us that we would get it as soon as possible. Then the waiting began. We all had finished our drinks when the waiter finally came back to see if we needed more and he provided refills. He assured us that our food was coming out. We waited more. Finally the food arrived for two of the four people at our table. The child's meal was not one of them. We all waited to start eating until everyone had their food so the two that came out first were cold by the time the other food came out.  Boy, was it disappointing! The child's plate was $5 and came with a mini slider with a child's handful of fries. There was more empty space on the plate than food. Wendy's gives more food in their child's meal and it's only $4 ($2 after 4PM). My food tasted good but for $14, I expected a lot more than a lunch portion. I was missing my breadsticks and the server said they would be right out. We also asked for mustard for the slider. My son finished his slider and I was almost finished my meal when the server finally came back with the breadsticks and no mustard.  We then asked for an Iced Tea refill and the server left. The server took forever to come back with the refill. I was just about to get up when he came back with the refill but he didn't bring ice. I should've complained to the manager but we were done with this place. Expensive food, small portions and SLOOOOOOW service. We will not be back to this AppleBee's again. It's a shame because I've been to a lot of different locations and have always left happy."
Jill V.,"Escondido, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/30/2016,"We didn't even get to have a meal here because nobody came to seat us. There were three waitresses in the bar, hanging out talking to the bartender. There was a waiter taking someone's order in the dining room who couldn't even look over and acknowledge us. Disappointing"
J M.,"San Jose, CA",0,31,5,2.0,5/15/2016,"There's so many food places to choose from in the area, choose those places instead of here. Staff is good, the food isn't."
SoCalRestaurantCritic ..,"Murrieta, CA",369,106,17,4.0,4/15/2015,"5 of us came in and thought we would perhaps get better service in the bar area. When we went in, there were six other full tables and a few at the bar, we were right. As soon as we sat, the bartender Keith came by and greeted us and took our drink order.  We got our drinks rather quickly and soon ordered our lunch. We ordered, two of the bacon, bacon hamburger with Blue cheese crumbles on top, oriental salad, Lemon chicken with rice and the pretzel sticks as an appetizer. All the food was good, hamburgers were over cooked and the balance of the meal was good. The lake of taste and overdone burgers were made up by the 5 star service we received.  Kieth came back many times checking in on us and making sure our visit was a great one. Refilled our drinks and stayed on top of our dining experience.  Five stars goes to Keith and staff for a wonderful experience. Be sure to sit in the bar area next time you visit Applebee's and ask for Keith!  Will visit again soon SCRC"
Susan M.,"Temecula, CA",89,130,328,5.0,5/29/2015,A nice variety of tasty food and drinks.  We were warmly greeted by Kyle and seated immediately.  Our server was attentive and very nice.  My family and I are long time fans of Applebee's.
Jallil T.,"Temecula, CA",120,72,70,1.0,3/15/2016,"Indira tonight was awefull. She was tacky and payed more attention to the people at the bar then us who were the last two eating and didn't bring me no extra ranch like I had asked for. No waters. The salad I got was so so. And the happy hour sucks here. I could have gone to my other spot and got way better service, more  food and better service for the same price. Let just say I won't be back. she was terrible. Indira. I hope you learn a lesson and not make this your end all be all job. Because you sucked and management should have a talk with your aweful services I would have tipped way better. But that's why you all get one star. And this isn't the first time we have had you either as a server."
Jonatan M.,"Garden Grove, CA",458,137,71,4.0,3/14/2014,I don't know why there are so many bad reviews we went in around 830 last night and had no problem finding a seat. Waitress was quick to take our orders and drinks! Drinks took a little long to get out and we were sitting next to bar waiting for our margaritas. Appetizers came out quick along with our food.  Everything was delicious. One RARE pleasant and successful Applebee's trip . Just a heads up 9:00pm happy hour go get it!
Dave T.,"Temecula, CA",0,9,2,1.0,5/2/2016,"Very disappointed!! Got an new steak dinner item which stated on the menu ""choice of 2 sides"" only to discover you don't since it's a new item that they are introducing. Waitress did not have the decency to ask ""how do you like you steak cooked?"" Daughter ordered Mac and cheese off the kids menu to find out 10 min later they ran out."" Long story short, the dinner sucked and they just lost a customer over $70 BS bill. Wake up management  or this establishment will be closed soon."
Benjamin A.,"Temecula, CA",0,28,1,2.0,9/25/2015,DONT go there....you won't be satisfied. Drive to another location. Not your normal apple bees. Servers charm regulars and people at the bar.(working that tip). We had our normal sections but food came out looking like it came from a Diner on deserted interstate.  Not all Applebees are created equal......Be warned.
Rhendi C.,"Temecula, CA",163,23,1,4.0,9/22/2014,"This review is specifically to highlight our amazing server Joseph.  Me and my boyfriend came here a few days ago. We sat in the bar area in a nice booth. TV's were big with a variety of sports to watch. Joseph greeted us and told us he would be taking over the table. He was immediately warm and friendly. I asked him questions about specific dishes and he seemed very knowledgeable about the menu items. Basically what happened was I ordered the Roma Steak medium rare which comes with potatoes and a mushroom cap filled with artichoke dip. The steak came out and it was over cooked to probably medium well to well done.  Joseph came back and asked if I was happy with my meal. I wasn't going to say anything because I was a server for three years and I know how difficult it can be. I've never sent food back ever, mainly because by that point I'm really hungry and I'll eat anything anyway. But Joseph could see that I wasn't completely satisfied so he asked me to really give him an honest answer. I told him that the steak was over cooked but that he didn't have to take it back, seeing as how I'd eaten almost half of it at that point. He INSISTED that I hand the steak over to him so that the kitchen could re-make it. Shortly after, I received my steak and it was cooked perfectly. He was also nice enough to give me another yummy mushroom cap. Joseph was great, he was funny, nice, and professional. A definite win for applebees."
Starr G.,"Palmdale, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/20/2016,Very nice staff our waitstress was super sweet especially to our daughter. I tried the Fiesta lime chicken it was great. And my fiance enjoyed his beer and meal as well he was very impressed that the bar tender knew how to poor the beer anD it wasn't all foam. Well be back when in town.
jerry b.,"Temecula, CA",57,112,54,5.0,8/27/2015,"Way better service than we're used to. Indira was awesome! Friendly, helpful and the food was BOMB! seriously you gotta try the new Blazin Texan Burger!!!"
Carole S.,"Temecula, CA",1,310,9,1.0,9/29/2015,"Ordered 2 waters, no lemon.  Got 2 waters with lemon and waitress said, oh that's right, you did not want lemon.  We removed the lemons.  She did not offer to get us fresh water.  I opened my menu and she said she was ready to take order and I told her we needed to look at menu first.  She replied, oh I meant after you looked at menu.  Hubby ordered ribs and shrimp for me.  First the appetizer and we were about 1/3 of way through it when she brought out main entrees.  A shame as appetizer was enjoyable if warm and now main meal needed to be eaten.  Again 1/4 way through meal, she asks if we want dessert and leaves us the bill to pay when we are ready-no Rush!  We still had appetizer and most of meal to eat and we were handed bill.  Now to quality of food.  Hubby said ribs were good but portion small.  My fried shrimp were good and very plentiful.  We both enjoyed that part of meal.  The fries were horrible.  Mine were cool to cold and tough.  Dead fries that were not edible.  Hubby ate most of his but said they were very poor, a little warmer than mine.  Not a good experience, not going back."
Kate P.,"Temecula, CA",143,10,1,1.0,9/28/2015,"Forgot our shakes, took 15 minutes to be greeted, server was sweet but forgetful. Manager working tonight has very poor management skills and does NOT know how to react to customers who are unhappy with their visit. Need new managers asap."
Nancy C.,"Temecula, CA",49,32,8,1.0,8/21/2015,"Place sucks so bad! Takes forever to get the food the steak was cold as hell with a block of un melted cheese and COLD shrimp just sitting on top of it, instead of mixed/cooked in the Parmesan, the vegetables were hard not steamed, cold, took over 20 minutes to get another beer, sent the steak back and here I am, still waiting, my daughter finished her food, I haven't been to an Applebee's is YEARS and now I remember why! Never ever coming here again!"
Nikki T.,"Mid-City, Los Angeles, CA",6,67,24,3.0,8/7/2015,"It's been years since I've patronized this type of place. I'm more of a BOA type person. I like how the menu has changed but the food isn't that great. My son took 1 bite of the pizza & pushed it aside. I ordered the lime chicken. Wasn't terrible. Wasn't great. Basically, this is a affordable place with okay food."
Danielle O.,"Temecula, CA",62,4,,3.0,6/29/2016,"Come here a lot and every time I order the grilled chicken breast, it always tastes rubbery like it was heated in a microwave. The manager even said they've had a lot of customer complaints about it. They need to fix this or they are going to lose customers. The chicken breast is just terrible"
Justine H.,"Temecula, CA",153,9,2,1.0,4/8/2015,"The food is okay, but the service makes it not even worth going back. The waitress was completely over sat, she could not handle all the tables she had. Everything that went 'wrong' the waitress blamed the computers (like her handing us the wring bill). I finally had to ask to speak to the manager and he couldnt even do anything. I had a great time with my family, but this place will not be open much longer; if the employees dont step up their customer service, and prefomance."
Kathy V.,"Tillamook, OR",1,39,10,1.0,1/3/2015,"Dear Applebees, your system of ordering from the table doesn't work. The customer waits for a long period of time for food-delivered by people that mysteriously appear. Makes us feel like we are in the middle of a cost cutting experiment gone wrong.The night we were there the manager ran around demeaning the staff for being behind. Just not a pleasant dining experience. This system is broken. Until its fixed, we wont be back."
Jay V.,"Temecula, CA",0,69,8,3.0,9/5/2015,"Good service. I had the Thai Shrimp Salad, which was very good. Manager seems very involved, greeting customers, etc. Which is a good thing."
