Holly D N.,"San Jacinto, CA",0,2,,2.0,5/4/2016,"the food was great. we got all of the happy hour appetizers. The service however was disgraceful. don't expect anything without asking for it. want more than one napkin, not unless you ask. want a refill, not unless you ask. pretty much they don't do anything unless you ask. they need to up their customer service skills."
Casey P.,"Temecula, CA",1,10,3,5.0,8/16/2015,Love this Applebee's. Come here all the time because of there late hours. Food is great and servers are even better.
Jennifer B.,"Temecula, CA",18,29,6,1.0,1/4/2015,"Went there yesterday had the fiesta lime chicken, got sick that night, was up alll night, I know it was food poisoning. Not going there again."
B M.,"Temecula, CA",0,7,3,3.0,8/11/2015,Food was delicious! The only draw back was we had had to wait an extremely long time to get our food.
Florence J.,"Palm Desert, CA",7,52,7,1.0,1/28/2016,"I know this is Applebee's and I shouldn't expect much but still. My boyfriend and I went about a week ago and when we came in, no employees to be found. We stood at the front for about 10 minutes before my boyfriend called the restaurant and asked the person who answered the phone to come and seat us. That's embarrassing. Service was slow and the food was just eh. I went back today because I had a gift card and got take out. I paid for extra bacon and my hamburger came with two strips of bacon. Do they usually only put one strip on it? I got BBQ seasoned fries that were ICE COLD. I know usually when you get food to go it can cool off on the ride home but I literally live across the street from the restaurant. I asked for my burger pink too and it was cooked to death. I also got a small bite brownie for dessert and the 'hot fudge' was literally microwaved chocolate pudding. The brownie was dry also. Overall, even though they're 'casual dining' it's not worth the price at all. I could've gone across the street to Siggy's and gotten food a hundred times better from a FAST FOOD establishment and for the same price."
Ashley N.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,3.0,10/25/2013,"I went to Applebee's off of Highway 79 for lunch and ordered the ""2 for $20 - 1 Appetizer + 2 Entrees"" with my friend.  I am usually very patient so I did not mind how long it took as long as I get the food. I believed it took around 10-15 minutes to receive our Spinach Artichoke Dip (appetizer). The dip was steaming hot and smelled absolutely scrumptious. My friend and I did not hesitate to munch away and although there was some crispy, slightly burned cheese on top, we just pushed it off and continued to eat it. The cheese did not affect the flavor at all and probably one of the best appetizers on the menu. The two entrees ordered was Three-Cheese Chicken Penne and 7 oz. House Sirloin that came in about 10-15 mins after our appetizer (about 20-30 mins total). I was super excited to dig in as soon as the food arrived. The pasta and the steak were very well presented on the plate/bowl, but when I took my first bite of the chicken penne, it wasn't hot, it was lukewarm. I liked how it tasted either way regardless of the temperature, but not a lot of people would enjoy eating almost cold pasta. I asked my friend for a bite of his steak and it was nearly cold as well but it was really juicy and delicious either way especially when it's medium rare. The service was pretty nice and a server always came in to ask us how we were doing and if we need more water, to go boxes, etc. without us asking. The restaurant is generally great, but the food will need to heat up a lot more. I believe I will be going back again to try out the other entrees to recommend dishes because honestly, applebees is not the best but it's not that bad either :)"
Grant S.,"Temecula, CA",3,31,6,2.0,4/16/2015,"Well where to start, not what it used to be. Plates were hot, food was not. The porterhouse steak was salty and rubbery. Service was okay but it took well over an hour to get our main courses. Dining room was nearly empty, yet there was a 10 min wait and then another 5 or so minutes for server to arrive. Very disappointing."
Tom W.,"Temecula, CA",108,8,,1.0,4/5/2015,"We ordered to go and discovered once we got home that our order was wrong. Calling them to explain the wrong order they were not really helpful, although I can't blame someone answering the phone. Honestly this particular Applebee's is not any different than a fast food place."
Deb D.,"Temecula, CA",12,15,1,1.0,1/25/2014,"Menu has changed and I see nothing appetizing on the new menu.  All my favorites are gone.  We waited 30 min for a table, and then another 40 min for the food to be delivered. The staff apologized and said they were slammed this night.  Food arrive and immediately I could see the tomatoes were under ripe and half frozen.  The burger was burnt to a crisp.  Not coming back here again."
Daniel K.,"Mandeville, LA",78,7,7,1.0,2/28/2015,My wife and I just ordered tonight the oriental salad and the three cheese chicken penne. We also got the boneless wings and the dessert which was the lava cake and ice cream. The food was probably hands down the worst meal I've had in ages. My wife and I are currently fighting getting sick so needless to say we will never ever give Applebees another chance as this was the last time we will allow them to destroy a meal. Literally tasted like something that got heated up in the microwave. Why people eat here when there are so many other alternatives I will never know.
CJ D.,"Temecula, CA",2,12,2,2.0,8/12/2013,"Not what it used to be when it opened. We sat in the bar and I was served water per my request with my drink. They used the same dispenser as they do for drinks so my water stunk and tasted horrible. Salad was ""forgotten"" and no apology or anything, instead just boxed it up in a to go box and brought it to us because we were done with our meals. Nothing better than day old salad the next day... The whole menu keeps changing and there is not as many options. It seems like all the good stuff has been removed. No more nachos, quesidillas..pasta options changed. The drink menu doesn't offer fun seasonal drinks anymore...Id rather eat as a fast food joint."
Michael C.,"Del Mar, San Diego, CA",30,29,,5.0,3/21/2015,My first time in an Applebee's.  Decided to have lunch at the bar in order to watch the March Madness basketball games.  Found my food to be quite good - 3 1/2 to 4 stars but was really impressed with the bartender Keith.  The very best person I've met in many years to make my experience a 10.
Dominique J.,"Temecula, CA",7,2,,1.0,7/1/2014,FOUND A BLACK HAIR IN MY DRINK!!!! Server took forever to take our orders and our appetizer made it to our table before our drinks even did so once we finally got them I noticed a gigantic black hair laying in and across my drink (I have blonde hair so I know it couldn't have possibly belonged to me) both my boyfriend and I were so disgusted we got up and left right away! I will NEVER return to this Applebee's or any others for that matter. Ps I would rate it 0 stars if it was possible.
Kerra A.,"San Diego, CA",1756,495,588,3.0,5/3/2011,"It's been a couple years since I've been to an Applebee's.... What happened to their chimicheesecake? Our kids didn't really like the kid menu items. They're 8 and 9....and the portion size didn't really cut it for them. Our 8 year old hated the grilled chicken sandwich. He said it was too small. Our oldest got the Mini Cheeseburgers and said it was ""ok"". The potato twister appetizer was ok, nothing spectacular. We only got it cause the kids wanted it but they didn't care too much for the sauce. Not worth the $6 if you can buy a bag of potato chips for $3 The Spicy Pineapple Glazed Shrimp & Spinach wasn't too bad. Didn't care for the rice...tasted to generic for me.   The kids were looking forward to a Chimicheesecake...but I guess it is no longer on the menu. The waitress Kristina H does deserve a 5 star however, she was fast & friendly."
Zach's M.,"Seal Beach, CA",26,38,1,4.0,7/27/2015,"It was better than expected, we did the 2 fir 25 meal.. They had decent portions and it was tasty.. My sons kids meal was a little sad, he ordered the 2 sliders and choose apple sauce for his side, the sliders were good quality and he liked them, the apple sauce was a pouch, the plate was very empty looking, I would think they would throw a orange slice, some carrot sticks or a few fries on the plate to make it look like a meal. My meal was enough for me to share some with him as he was still hungry after he finished his, and he is only 6 so a kids meal should be enough to fill him.  They had very limited vegetarian options, just a vegi patty for the burgers..  The service was good and the host seating people was very friendly. Always had full drinks and the food came in a average amount of time."
Jessica E.,"Temecula, CA",3,18,3,1.0,6/24/2015,"This Applebee's is a joke. We've been there about four times now hoping the last bad experience was just a fluke, just to be disappointed all over again. EVERY time we have walked in, we've had to either wait 10 minutes to just be seated, when absolutely no one else is waiting for a table, and the place is empty basically anyway. Or we've had to flag someone down to give us a seat. On several occasions I've even seen what looks to be the manager walking by us and not even saying a word as were clearly waiting for a hostess. The food is just awful. I've been to plenty of Applebee's and I've never been to one like this one before. It seems like everything is microwaved. My kids ordered the child's menu cheeseburger. And when we got it, the bun was completely hard as a rock, I mean we adults couldn't even bite into it, let alone a 3 or 5 year old. Now normally I'm not one to be quick to send food back, for the most part. But we had to send these burgers back because they clearly were not edible. They came back with more cheeseburgers which were again, hard as rocks, completely overcooked in the microwave. They did this FOUR times until finally offering us to choose new food. The kids got macaroni and cheese which turned out to be Kraft macaroni and cheese out of a box. We also haven't found one thing off the menu worth eating, and the waitress' could care less about their service. So we refuse to go back. I'd rather eat at iHop across the way."
Caster T.,"San Diego, CA",7,57,,4.0,12/7/2012,"So the Mrs. and I were up in Temecula last weekend with our kid to visit some friends out at Vail Lake and when we left, the wife was hungry.  She gets really grumpy when shes hungry so I knew I had to get some food in her ASAP.  Sure enough, we fought yet again about where we were going to eat.  Our typical ""go to"" isnt applebees, but in this occurance its what she wanted.   So we went to applebees which as a corporate chain has been notorious for giving me the runs.  I have IBS but I dont think its IBS related because I have numerous friends who dont have IBS and get the squirts from applebees too.   Anyways, I had a club sandwich (pretty bland to avoid diarrhea) and my wife had a bad attitude and a cobb salad.  Our son had a grilled cheese.  The staff was really nice at this Applebees and we were greeted and served in a timely manner. Our waitress who was a middle aged lady was extremely nice.  We also got to sit by a window on the north east side of the building which faces the intersection of Highway 79 south and a cross road and were entertained by all the people who would attack the applebees parking lot with their cars only to bottom out the front of the car..... that will help the resale value.   Decent food as with any applebees, but this one seemed a bit better.  They have a great staff at this location.  Cant comment on the drinks because we didnt drink.  I had to stop in Escondido on the drive back to use the AMPM bathroom but thats pretty typical.   As for applebees, this is a GREAT applebees.  I would give 5 stars if I didnt get diarrhea."
Elisa L.,"Riverside, CA",50,75,6,2.0,5/13/2013,"We were greeted upon entrance. Got our order fast. Got the buffalo wings about 5 minutes after ordering them. I ate one. Yummy. Bit into the 2nd wing and it was VERY gummy. I cut it open. OMG it was raw! Like completely raw! Not even cooked on the inside. I was SOOOO disgusted. I just ate raw chicken. I wasn't mad, just disgusted. The manager came, apologized and took care of everything. Kudos on the manager. Man the cook messed up this time."
Gi G.,"Temecula, CA",2,30,14,5.0,9/29/2014,First time in Applebees! and we loved it! Our server Katelynn was very professional and friendly. The food was very TASTY! and very good deal on the beers. One of our plates was the Shrimp and Steak which it was delicious.
Shanna B.,"PAUMA VALLEY, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/21/2014,"If I could give them a  zero  i  would!! Waitress was awful took 25 min get refill, ordered appetizers which didn't come til the meal. Which took an additional 25 min. When we left the money for the check they stopped us at the door and assumed we didn't pay the full tab!! I would like to say because they knew how awful there service was, but I think it was because my Husband's skin was Dark!!! Don't waste your money or time here!!!"
