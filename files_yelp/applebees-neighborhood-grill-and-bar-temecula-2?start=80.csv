Keith N.,"Carlsbad, CA",178,135,104,4.0,12/13/2012,Couldn't be happier with the Bacon bleu Burbon burger. One of the best burgers I've ever had in my life.
Allen P.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,5.0,12/31/2014,"Great spot, well managed. I had a SMALL issue with my food (it happens), they were VERY busy but took the time to make it right. Thanks guys, I'll be back. -Robert"
Holly M.,"Temecula, CA",9,31,7,4.0,6/14/2014,My review is for the bar area at the Temecula location only. My husband and I found that anytime we have sat at the bar (mostly for a happy hour drink and snack) we have received awesome service. The bartenders are friendly and food/drinks come fast.
D A.,"Temecula, CA",2,22,2,1.0,4/29/2015,"Honestly I don't know how they stay in business. Slow service, terrible food.. My mojito had mint in it that was so old it was black and it tasted like dish water. Came here 3 times in the last few years and every time the same thing. I hope they close and use the space for a good steak house"
Audrey Y.,"Temecula, CA",0,3,,4.0,9/1/2014,Excellent service by our waitress and received out food quickly. Only complaint was our chip dip was burnt on the top. Everything else was fantastic and very delicious
Deb G.,"Crest, CA",73,339,3,3.0,4/16/2012,It's Applebee's...corporate American restaurant.  Food is marginal at best and the drinks are ok.  I always get applebeetini with no fruit and what did mine come with? Fruit!  Didn't taste like a red apple it was not that great.  Our food was fresh and hot and the service was great. It will do when we need a quick bite to eat but don't want fast food or dine in fast foods.
Erika G.,"Fallbrook, CA",10,101,34,1.0,2/25/2011,"Unfortunately, this visit was awful.  I ordered a vodka redbull and our bartender Lawrence automatically poured me a double.   Normally this isnt a bad thing, but the fact he assumed makes me feel like i was tricked into paying more. Was it in hopes he would get a bigger tip?!  I left him nothing... Thanks bud we won't be back! Plus, after writing a lengthly letter to ... somebody... the manager at this location called and didn't apologize! Just said that we should be the ones calling all of the mistakes to her attention immediately. The fact that we didn't means she couldn't do anything for us.  Thanks for blaming us for your crappy service and products. This is definitely the LAST place on earth we will EVER go."
Lisa M.,"Temecula, CA",5,9,,1.0,3/12/2014,Not very good. . Haven't been in a while.  Food not that great. .. chips were cold. Bbq sauce on the cowboy burger not good. . Don't waste your money
Karina E.,"Murrieta, CA",49,2,,1.0,2/9/2014,"This is by far the worst food & service iv ever experienced!  Myfriend and I got the 2for$20. Spinach dip, sirloin w/ garlic mashed potatoes & veggies  I got the pepper shrimp & chicken.  Ok well the spinach dip was cold both times we sent it back to get warmed up. The sirloin was dry, the ""garlic mashed potatoes... there was no garlic in or near them. The veggies were sooo over cooked that it looked like bby food. The pepper shrimp and chicken. The potatoes were brunt and dry. Same with the chicken and shrimp. There was none of the sauce that its supposed to come with.   It was all disgusting amd most of the  ppl that work there have an attitude issue. Never going here again id rather go to jack in the box any day"
Robert S.,"Temecula, CA",1,4,1,1.0,4/18/2015,Food taste like school food.  Not fresh.  Service was sub par.  Bee got the 25.00 meal and the bill was over 72.00.  I won't go back. Also the dining room was filthy
Ann F.,"Temecula, CA",1,22,9,1.0,11/10/2013,11/10/2013 me and my husband took a little break from the kids tonight I'm writing this review while waiting for our food and drinks is being already over one hour and finally we are going to leave we will never come back
Nim N.,"Anaheim, CA",3,57,2,2.0,10/23/2013,My girlfriend and I came here for lunch the other day. The staff seemed very fake and cold. There was also a hair on one of the napkins. Needless to say I will not be coming back.
Sam A.,"Temecula, CA",13,117,10,3.0,4/8/2011,"Just your average Applebee's.  Good food. Good service (but a bit slow). Good prices, Typical atmosphere. Nothing above average in any regard, but still worth the trip, every time. Prices are pretty darn good. Get the oriental chicken salad, it will be a filling meal."
Susan R.,"Murrieta, CA",0,35,,5.0,5/19/2013,"Went last Friday for an early dinner, as always we received very friendly service - we were greeted as soon as we entered.  Our wait staff Anna was very attentive, refilled our drinks without us even asking.  The manager stopped by too to greet us and served our appetizer!  Love this place, we always get our food the way we like it!!  See you guys at Applebee's soon!"
Ira M.,"Murrieta, CA",102,7,6,2.0,5/17/2011,"If the service here was better, the cheap food and cheap happy hour drinks could carry this boring restaurant. But every time I come here (at least 3 times now) the service is SO SLOW. There wasn't even a hostess to greet us and it took 5 minutes just to get a table in the empty restaurant. The lady messed up our order so the food took FOREVER, at least an hour which is ridiculous for a party of two. She didn't apologize either. She was actually kind of rude on top of that.  But the food finally came out and it was pretty good. Then the check came out and it was so cheap. Love/hate relationship. It's a chain restaurant, and my guess is that people just come back because they know what to expect for the most part."
Phil L.,"Fallbrook, CA",1,15,,2.0,7/17/2013,Mediocre food with mediocre ambience. Only went there to use a gift card.  Not planning to return.
Jason G.,"Temecula, CA",30,14,,4.0,4/7/2013,"Great service. We go once a month or so and the staff is always friendly. They keep our water full, which is always important. Food is great. I usually get the boneless wings (spicy) and chicken basket. Great soup too!!"
Danae W.,"Temecula, CA",0,8,,5.0,5/7/2014,"Honestly, I come here for Melinda. She has been good to my family and I and she always remembers a part of our conversation from the prior visit and asks about the result. The food is good, the kitchen always seems to concede to my health-conscious requests and the service that Melinda gives is unsurpassed. I have been coming to this Applebee's only because of her for the past three years. Thanks, Melinda!!!"
Temecula Critic W.,"Aguanga, CA",19,35,,4.0,5/6/2012,"Listen you know what you are going to get, it's great American food at a good price! Who can beat the 2 for $20 deal. Eat up....and enjoy the great service!"
Linda T.,"Natick, MA",0,23,4,1.0,11/18/2012,"Wow. Can't believe how disappointed we were today. Not only in the food, but the slow service. We also started with dirty plates for our appetizer. The food took about 25 minutes to get to us and it wasn't crowded at all. The French fries were over-seasoned. The veggies served with the 9z steak tasted as if they had been microwaved.  The pasta served with the steak fettuccine was mushy. Just gross. Won't be coming back here!"
