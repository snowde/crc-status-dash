Scott G.,"Chandler, AZ",85,21,5,5.0,8/4/2017,"This review is for you if you often find yourself looking for decently priced sit-down style dining in the late evening... Believe me I know: After 10pm there is not much for sit-down selection, and everyone knows the service almost always is terrible and sometimes the food too...when you walk into a restaurant after 9 when it closes at 10.... I admit I walked in to here after delaying my eating to the point where selection was slim(9:15ish)... I wanted Japanese but unfortunately the hipsters and millennials had taken over all of the Japanese restaurants to eat their cold, raw, ""delicious"", sushi .. I walked into a Japanese restaurant that had a revolving sushi bar, a list where you write your own name down, twenty people STANDING at the entrance, and went ungreeted - it appeared that's the way the business was meant to be until you sit down and get service. .. I went to put my name on the list and immediately changed my mind.. HECK, that list made me feel like a loser because EVERYONE on it had more than one person, and here I am, this restaurant wants me to proclaim to everyone who views the waiting list that I am the only loner in the room!  So I went to Applebee's down the street.  On a Friday night they had domestic pints for $2.29 - wow!  They close at 1 so I felt in no hurry. At 10:00 the entire restaurant was busy and provided a great vibe. Food deal was amazing for the price.  Applebee's should be a go to for so many."
Chelsea W.,"Phoenix, AZ",74,110,704,1.0,11/21/2017,"After leaving the location on 24th street and Baseline, I drive here looking for better service.  We walked in and were sat immediately. The restaurant was nearly empty. We went to our booth and about 10 minutes later, a waitress comes over and says she'll be taking our drink order. Now I already knew what I wanted since we waited a bit to even make human contact with anyone besides the host. The young lady took my drink order, and when I attempted to make my meal order she said she'll be right back.  Well right back never happened because she was so busy chatting it up with the table behind us. 10 minutes passed, then 20. Still with NO DRINKS not even water! So I got up just as I did the first location and took my ass to McDonald's. What a night."
John V.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,1.0,7/24/2017,"Well to start off, I was there the other night with some friend's. We were at the bar having a good time but noticed the bartender wasn't paying attention  to any one at the bar. It wasn't just us. As we started to acknowledge this with other people it became evident that he was not concerned with us. This is not the first time he acted that way . It would make sense that if he's not happy to work some where else. Every time we here him talk it always about the store and how poorly  it is beening run. Please help I'm here to speak for everyone who goes the tee and is tires of Dan the angry bartender.  Sign The paying customers."
David J.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,1,,5.0,1/6/2018,"Anthony, our waiter was excellent! His attention and concern to making sure we received the best possible experience and food is unheard of in a typical chain restaurant.  Thanks again !"
Mic L.,"Cologne, Germany",50,188,903,4.0,10/8/2017,"Expecting worse, I was surprised by the taste of the food. I've been to quite a few Applebee's restaurants. But, unlike most others this one's quality hasn't dropped over time. The salad tasted fresh, the meat was cooked to perfection and the seasoning was well balanced. Quite recommendable for a quick lunch or sports' night out."
Rosemary D.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,12,1,5.0,10/28/2017,"Applebee's has come a long way since the last time I visited. (years ago) The food was good, service was good. The manager, Omar stopped by our table to see how everything was which we appreciated. He was very funny! We'll be back!"
Ashley F.,"Phoenix, AZ",123,201,78,1.0,10/10/2017,"I hadn't been to this place since I was a kid and for good reason (I had discovered that if I wanted quick, cheap, and dirty that I could just buy a microwave meal), the only reason I came back was for the ""dollar margaritas"" happening this month. For the $1 margaritas, there is no catch, you go in and can get drink after drink after drink for a dollar (50 cents extra for different flavors) the only problem is that they water the drink down after the first one. I came in expecting to leave a bit tipsy, but was basically sipping on juice/grenadine and water by the third one. The food was terrible, it literally tasted like it went from freezer, to microwave, plate, to us...and this was after our waiter forgot what we ordered twice. He did the same for the margaritas, completely forgetting what was ordered and making us wait a very long time. I blame most of this on the rush of a Friday night, but I also think that the restaurant didn't anticipate the high influx of people looking to get cheap alcohol. It wasn't that they were understaffed, it was that the staff was unorganized and overwhelmed. Our waiter also seemed a bit fed up and I get it, but still not the best customer experience."
Brittany B.,"Chandler, AZ",275,21,16,1.0,10/4/2017,Well where to start we have had several bad experiences with this applebees specifically. The staff is inattentive and makes a habit of getting things on the order wrong. The most recent experience we sat at the bar for about five minutes maybe longer with staff looking at us but never acknowledging. No one ever came up to us or greeted us. Needless to say we walked out and will not be back
Susan E.,"Munds Park, AZ",1,62,36,3.0,5/26/2017,"Good stable place for reliable food. Service adequate but timing poor. If we order appetizers we like to finish b 4 the meal not get the meal and then have to choose. Music ridiculously loud.  I am not pleased w the pay at the table; Weird and not very personable which is the reason to eat out, personal service. Moved down a few notches on the go to list. Prices still great for good food."
Zoe D.,"Mesa, AZ",62,2,,1.0,10/8/2017,"Terrible TERRIBLE service We were seated at this tiny table when they had a bunch of tables open then I asked for an appetizer never got that , I had to wait 20 mins each time I would ask for a drink refill we also waited over an hour for our food other people around us that were there after us got their food first I won't ever go back to this location"
Juan M.,"Chandler, AZ",1416,1110,17405,4.0,9/7/2016,"Service was great as the hostess was friendly and sat me right away. The waiter was attentive and friendly. I ordered their new bone-in pork chop with a side of sweet mashed potatoes and garlic fries. The fries and mashed potatoes were great. The pork chop was on top of an apple sauce. It was ok, not great."
Rob E.,"Chandler, AZ",91,151,383,4.0,1/9/2017,"Applebee's is your regular american restaurant. looks like they have simplified the menu over the past couple years. everything looks pretty good, choices for every type of appetite. always very friendly staff, we had great prompt service on a Sunday after church. had a party of 9 and we were sat right away without calling ahead.  ordered appitzers: boneless wings - normal breaded chicken bites, nothing special, but delicious( i recomend getting the honey pepper sauce! yum! pretzel pub sticks - they ususally are aweosme, but this time around they were gross! not cooked enough or something, was off the mark that day. Food: 4-cheese mac with honey pepper chicken tenders - 3 people ordered this on at our table and everyone loved it. it's usually what i get here but wanted to try something else. i recomend this dish! its delicious mac and crispy tenders definitely satisfy and leave you wanting more chicken strips! i had a crispy chicken breast on mashed potatoes and gravy topped with onion strings. it was fantastic, flavors all over the place delicious and savory. i w2ould get again. wife had a steak - was way over cooked and tasted of burnt grill flavor - i don't think she would recomend getting it again. we had a good experience. this was a good middle of the road not to pricey great place to have lunch. good for kids and the whole family."
Hugo G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",11,5,,1.0,8/5/2017,"I came in tonight and was sat down at 11:15PM it was 11:30 and the waiter never came to my table he came by the 4 tables around me but did not come to me. I was not happy so I left. The guy who sat me down instead of saying ""have you been helped"" said have a goodnight.  This Applebee's sucks."
S K.,"Phoenix, AZ",76,41,3,3.0,12/27/2016,"This is solely covering the topic of to-go orders. I ordered on the website, which told me it would be ready for pickup at 3:54pm. I arrived at 4:05 pm, parked in the to-go parking, and waited for approximately 2 minutes before I got out and went inside.  My order was ready, the bartender attempted to assist (even though she had a bar full of customers to handle of her own) so props to her for that.   A manager arrived shortly thereafter to take my payment.   Overall a smooth experience, but I would suggest that the lettuce in the salads could be fresher, going forward."
Lauren L.,"Bedford, TX",5,7,1,2.0,10/21/2016,"Less than mediocre. Happy hour beer selection is not good. PBR and BUD LIGHT? Okay... Also, they should call it the ""Southwestern Steak Wilted Salad"" pre-made and frozen to perfection, then thawed out. Boneless wings. Eh. Even the waiter was bland. My 6 year old liked the chicken tenders, though. That's the only reason I'm giving 2 stars. But it's Applebee's. They haven't been good since I didn't know what good food was. Do yourself a favor and go up the street to Oregano's or Olive Garden if you want a good meal at a decent price."
Kristin A.,"Chandler, AZ",39,4,2,1.0,1/8/2017,"food was terrible and burnt  waited a long time when place was empty i work across the street and would always refer people here well not anymore waitress was rude brought all of appetizers and dinner out 2min apart from each other, and 5min after brought us our bill. my husband and i felt extremely rushed and not welcomed. they still charged us for burnt nasty food we did not eat and there was dust or dirt not only in my malibu drink but inside my ice cube. what a waste of time and money don't go here, not worth the crappie service, dirty cups, and burnt food. i will be filing a corporate complaint our waitress was alexandria g.  tb#93 check#8883-470848"
Din R.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,23,4,1.0,8/26/2017,"Just got home from having dinner here. I was so very disappointed.  Does anyone even go to this restaurant anymore? I had not been to Applebees before & thought we will try it out as I had a Gift Card. There were so many booths & tables open & the person who seats the guests is looking around for a table while stand there. Before we could even read the menu, the server is at our table to take our order. Either they want to get it over & done with, or they do not show up at all. I ordered a Margarita & specifically said not too much ice. I get my drink & the glass is half full of ice. I just let it go, as I did not want to say anything. I  ordered the artichoke & spinach cavaratti as my main meal. I am not even going to say it tasted bad, as there was no taste at all. I don't know what it should even taste like. It was with a basic white sauce & no seasoning at all. Tasted bland. I had to say something at this point as I was hungry & when food does not taste good, I get very upset. There was not eve. 1 piece of Artichoke to be found. I mentioned this to the server & he said there should be Artichoke in it. I moved my food around& showed him there was nothing.  If they did flavor it with some sort of Artichoke flavor, I am sorry, I did not taste it. He then asked if I wanted to speak to a Manager. What was the point? Did the Manager have the artichoke the chef forgot to add? This is my first time there & it will be my last for sure. Very disappointed & unhappy."
Jim W.,"Phoenix, AZ",224,72,490,4.0,11/26/2015,"Had a good experience here on Thanksgiving Day!  Food: Good! I ordered the Loaded Brisket Enchiladas, and was not disappointed. They were very flavorful, just the right amount of food. The rice was ok, nothing special. Cost: Reasonable: $10 for three enchiladas and rice. Service:  Very good. Everyone we met was friendly and cheerful, from the ""greeter"" who opened the door to our server, to the manager who stopped by to make sure we were happy. It took us a few minutes to decide what to order. Once we did, the food came out fairly quickly. Impressive, since this was Thanksgiving Day. The server was attentive the whole time. Atmosphere: Ok, it's an Applebees. What else can I say?  :-)   Overall: A good experience, certainly different than many of the reviews of this place!"
Garret G.,"Tempe, AZ",3,6,,1.0,4/28/2017,"took my daughter their for her sweet 16, she ordered the appitizers and I got a margarita. I let her just have one sip for her bday party and the stafff threw a tantrum. lighten up applebees, when i was 16 applesbees didnt care about that kind of stuff. no longer the kind of place to bring a well adjusted family. NO THANKS!!!!!!!!!! Pretty good prices though."
Sarah M.,"Phoenix, AZ",32,40,,4.0,2/20/2017,Toni is the BEST waitress.  We only ask for her!  Best service EVER!  We go there for lunch.  Make sure to ask for the French onion soup well done so the cheese melts completely.  Otherwise no complaints.
Adera A.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,3,,1.0,1/22/2017,This place will be closed soon. I like Applebees but this location is getting really bad every single day.
Mina M.,"Tucson, AZ",0,10,7,1.0,1/2/2017,"Bad food bad service!!they brought our appetizer too late after 30 minutes or so, food was cold! I didn't complain n start eating but my husband couldn't eat that frozen mash potato ask them to reheat it by the time they brought the food I was done with my  food ! N guess what I didn't have any water to swallow that nastiness!! N he never brought us drinks after we paid the bill he asked my husband ( not me and my father )if he wants some  drink to go!! Really?! Is this a jock?! We have been waiting thirsty the whole time now one drink to go n still not  apology?!Please close your restaurant"
Beth L.,"Mesa, AZ",45,91,388,4.0,7/6/2015,"I called ahead to find out what the wait time was. I was told there was no wait time (Monday @ 6:30) When we arrived we were immediately sat. Our waiter arrived promptly to take our drink orders and by the time he came back with our drinks we were ready to order.  I ordered the shrimp and steak, my girls ordered the 2 for $20 deal. Chicken basket and rib basket. The appetizers were boneless wings for the girls and a side salad for me. We got our appetizers within 15 minutes and our meal came out 10 minutes latter.  My steak was tender and cooked to my liking. The shrimp with parmesan sauce had a lot of flavor. The garlic mashed potatoes were the perfect side as well as the steamed broccoli.  The girls both liked their dinner. The only complaint was the Shirley temple tasted water downed.  Service was quick from the time we were seated to the time we got our food  and to the end when we got our bill and were walking out.  I have no complaints. Applebee's is an affordable place to eat good food."
Sa L.,"Phoenix, AZ",133,61,24,2.0,2/21/2016,Their new menu is good but wow no sense of urgency with the staff. It's a Sunday there's a bunch of open seats and we waited 15 mins to get any ones attention. Now it's been 15 mins were just waiting for our drinks. Luckily we ordered our food with the drinks but come on. Even if you're a little short show that you are trying to be quick or get people who will be.
Casey B.,"Casa Grande, AZ",0,2,,1.0,5/30/2017,"Our dining experience was awful. The restaurant was practically empty, but it took over 5 minutes for someone to greet us at our table. My husband's order came out wrong... They brought his new food with the original potatoes-that were now cold. The oriental chicken salad I ordered was disappointing, basic, and was drenched with dressing. My mudslide had the consistency of chocolate milk and tasted like it too. The food took a long time-which was odd because the place was empty. I would definitely not recommend this restaurant. I wish I would have checked the Yelp reviews before we ate here!"
Beatrice B.,"Phoenix, AZ",88,273,468,1.0,12/23/2014,"I definitely would not come back based upon my experience tonight. Slow, is an understatement of the time it took for the drinks and food to come out. An hour and 15 minutes to get the meal to completion is a bit over-the-top."
Alex H.,"Chandler, AZ",113,5,1,2.0,5/1/2016,"This place is a train wreck. The only good thing to come out of this Applebee's was Regina running around and running the whole restaurant. It is currently 6 on a Sunday night and she is the only server running the floor while there are 6 servers sitting around at random tables scattered over the restaurant watching Regina run around. The only help she had was the host, Alex, who was seating tables, cleaning tables and checking on food and tables for her. He is doing more than the 6 other servers in the restaurant. This looks like a clear lack of management going on in this entire restaurant. We sent back a sirloin that was well done and was supposed to be medium rare. No manager in sight. Regina is too good for this restaurant! The bartender spent most of his time vaping behind the bar. Cool vape bro."
Ashley R.,"Dallas, TX",20,124,174,2.0,2/25/2015,"Extremely over priced.  Came in for late night and requested a booth.  Everyone must request them because there wanst one available but yet the tables were empty.  They were filled with dishes to be bussed.  The staff didn't seem to have much ambition to clean em.   Ordered drinks and we were shocked when we were charged $10 for a tiny margarita.  What a rip. Ordered half off apps menu .You couldn't order more than one per person. I felt like there were a lot of restrictions for the late night menu.  Food was good, service was ok. Got the bill and our waiter didn't even stay thank you or have good night.  Kind of an awkward way to end the experience. Total bill for a couple appetizers and two drinks was $65 I did notice that there were employees sitting around at bar and in corner for the whole time we dined.  Considering how over staffed they were you think the tables might be cleaned off. Also it's a bit unpleasant hearing  the waitstaff complain about their tips."
Marco G.,"Tempe, AZ",0,40,153,4.0,3/19/2016,I usually go to Applebee's for happy hour and apps ! Can't  go wrong with the happy hour specials ! This is my go to Applebee's !
Julie S.,"Tempe, AZ",11,120,93,4.0,1/1/2016,I forget how awesome this place can be.  I enjoyed the spinach and shrimp  salad with a bowl of french onion soup.   The new menu is full of okd classics with a new twist.  Come and try them all!
Kellie V.,"Phoenix, AZ",18,34,15,5.0,8/2/2016,Always fun here. Love happy hour!!  The bar staff rocks!!! Good happy hour prices and munchies.
Grant C.,"Tempe, AZ",39,71,61,5.0,7/13/2016,always get the oriental chicken salad best salad ever always the same  great staff ice cold beer steak is always cooked how you want it and good
Donna R.,"Coolidge, AZ",27,7,3,5.0,1/20/2017,"Awesome location, such friendly staff .. Oh don't get me started on the Hot Blonde dessert... it's a must"
Jay K.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,4,,3.0,1/27/2017,"I stop here every once in awhile on the way home from work for a beer maybe some food. Nobody goes to Applebee's for food (I hope) so I will stick with service. It was about 9:45 on a Friday night so it was a little busy but there were two bartenders behind the bar which is unusual for this Applebee's. The one that unfortunately helped me was either new or just didnt give a shit. His name was Aaron. I was annoyed because you should never sit a bar for 10 minutes before being greeted, I almost just left but then Aaron decided to help. I ordered a jack and coke. He walked around the bar a bit, then walked out of bar area and I didnt see him for a few minutes. When he did come back it was obvious he had forgotten my drink but he made it quickly and I was happy. Long story short I had to ask for another drink after being empty for a bit, just poor service. I gave 3 stars because I come here fairly often and this is not typical. I would just ask for another server/bartender if a guy named aaron walks up. He doesnt care, dont even give him a chance. Btw when I asked for my second drink he washed a few glasses before making my drink, bad. Im listening to another couple complaining about him as I type this."
Jasmine A.,"Tempe, AZ",2,2,,2.0,12/8/2016,"Tonight I was super hungry and wanted a well cooked meal, I live close and decided this was the place to go. I didn't know I would be disappointed. I walked in and was seated immediately with my 4 other family members! Our server, Kyle, quickly took our drink orders which was nice. Two parties are then seated on Kyle's side, one party with 3 people and another with 6. Kyle then takes our order perfectly . My mom orders a margarita. So far, so good. We had a long wait for our food and the party of 3 people had got so tired of waiting, they left. He didn't get to introduce himself or get their drink orders! After a long wait, we finally got our food! But one thing was missing... my moms margarita. He ""forgot"" about it. The food was worth waiting for! It was delicious! When ready to leave, I asked for my check. I hand him cash. He came back and handed me a bag for my boxes but had not given me back my change. Maybe he ""forgot""... The change was well over 25% and was not well deserved. I understand if someone says ""keep the change"" but I did not and was expecting to leave the right deserved tip. Overall, the food is delicious but the service was terrible!!!"
Joey G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,1.0,7/13/2015,"We gave this place a few chances.   But the service is always horrible. The drinks are the worst! They really need to get a bartemder who knows what he is doing... The one they have is always staring at the game and takes forever just to serve a beer...the cocktails always taste like alcohol and sweetner, so gross."
Doug Z.,"Chandler, AZ",1,14,1,2.0,12/18/2016,"Went into this store because they unexpectedly closed my usual Applebee's on Chandler Blvd. I was seated quickly in the bar area as requested. The poor schmuck behind the bar was tasked with covering/serving the entire bar area including all the hi-tops and booths AND mix drinks.  I ordered and was served a drink relatively quickly given the short staffing. Upon ordering a refill I placed an order for the fish and chips. My food was served within 10 - 15 minutes. The first bite was good but the closer I got to the middle of the piece of fish the colder the food became until it was just plain cold. After informing the bar tender/waiter and sending the plate back, the manager on duty stepped up and apologized for the under-cooked food. About 10 minutes later another order was delivered to my table. This time it was HOT and cooked through. The point of this review is not to condemn the entire restaurant for the mistake of one cook. The manager's apology was appropriate but an offer to comp the dinner would have been more appropriate and appreciated. Things could have been worse - under-cooked fish - just sayin'."
Luann B.,"Hilton Head Island, SC",16,11,3,1.0,5/1/2015,"Looking for a true Phoenix experience? Here you go. You show up for happy hour and instead you get cockroaches. The food isn't great. The service isn't bad. The roaches are a wonderful effect of bringing together the ""Phoenix vibe""."
Melanie B.,"Chandler, AZ",0,31,8,1.0,7/30/2015,"If you hate your job why work there?  Probably won't be going to Applebee's  anymore, I've given this place too many chances and it only gets worse with time. Prices went up and portions went down. The bartender did not seem happy to be there at all. I've worked in the service industry for 3 years (and still do) and I know that no matter how bad your night maybe you put on a damn smile and be friendly, or at the least attempt to be.  I know what is annoying to wait staff so I try to be an easy customer. I knew it was happy hour because that's why we went and I like the happy hour drinks, did not receive the happy hour menu that says what food/drinks were on happy hour, fine whatever, didn't ask for it. Got a drink that I knew, from previous trips, was on happy hour.  Got an appetizer did not receive silverware or napkins. Whatever fine. They also changed it so the pretzels no longer come with cheese and mustard so I had to ask for the other side, which I got an attitude like I was being bothersome (I ask politely and always say thank you). Again whatever. Got the Thai shrimp salad (sub shrimp for chicken.) This is when we got silverware. Got the salad and I stared at it for a minute, noticing the large bowl but very small amount of salad. See the picture on the menu? Cut that amount in half, that's what you get. It was premixed lettuce/carrot/cabbage, like what you find in the veggie section at Walmart, with edamame beans and the smallest amount of dressing I have ever seen, literally just a drizzle of dressing on top. I ask for a side of dressing. I kept looking at it wondering why the salad appeared different from what the picture was when I ordered, well I looked on the Applebee's online menu, out of pure irritation, it was also supposed to have crunchy wonton noodles, almonds, and cilantro, which my salad did NOT have. How do you miss THREE main parts of the salad?! Asked us how we were after our food was done.   At this point I'm just kind of over being there. He was probably the most unfriendly bartender I have ever experienced, you shouldn't feel like your bothering a server when asking for something, that is there job and why you tip, for the service. We still tipped the normal 20% purely based off of being in the industry, not because he deserved it."
Leti G.,"Tempe, AZ",60,40,17,3.0,6/14/2015,This place needs new management. The quality of food has gone down. The atmosphere is not how it used to be. The I got the sliders. The pulled pork was so salty that I couldn't take more than one bite.
