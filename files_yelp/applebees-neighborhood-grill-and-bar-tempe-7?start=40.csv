Ron O.,"Tempe, AZ",0,21,,1.0,4/5/2016,"I usually don't order meals online. I prefer to call the restaurant. They had a simple online ordering, I ordered a meal for curbside pick up, received a confirmation email, went to the restaurant sat there for 10 minutes called the restaurant phone number and was told sorry we have no specialist tonight. Then I was hung up on!So much for customer service!!"
Christina M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",9,256,39,1.0,1/18/2016,"The ONLY reason they got a star is for Lexi, the hostess. We came in on a Monday night, the host put our name in, Lexi chatted us up while we waited (he said 5 min), another family of 5 walks in, the loud ass lady claims, ""I got kids, we need to be seated right away""!. Well, lady, I hate corporate places but when your family wants to eat somewhere, you gotta go so F you, wait your damn turn! The manager, Michelle, comes over, takes the wait list from Lexi and proceeds to find these people a table and then seats them before us!! I'm beside myself! I calmly explain to my family why we don't eat at corporate and we left. Felt bad for the poor hostess,  apologizing profusely because her manager sucks at her job. I hope she gets a real job at a better restaurant."
Mike M.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,32,24,1.0,4/19/2015,"Why is every place going downhill? When we arrived we were told it was just shift change and they needed a second to clean a table. No big deal. We didn't even wait a whole minute before we were seated... Drinks ordered and arrived quickly. We were a little slow ordering. We were trying to decide on the 2 for $20/$25 deal or something else. Fajitas disappeared from the menu, but they still serve them. Once I found that out, we were ready to order. Now I wonder if mentioning shift change was a pre-excuse for the horrible service we were about to get... We ordered what used to be labeled as the Bottomless Chips and Salsa. Price is up by a $1. Thanks, Obamacare! It used to come out on their big round raised plate/tray with a semi-small bowl of salsa. That was OK because they always come back to the table often enough to keep you deep in salsa. Now it comes out on a much smaller tray with a tiny cup of salsa and a few chewy, stale chips... We thought, well, they'll be running their buts off filling that cup... That might have been so if we had seen our server even once before our food arrived. Actually, our server wasn't the one that brought our food so we didn't see her for a while afterward. Our food had come and our drinks (an iced tea and a water) had been sitting empty for a while. When our server finally made an appearance, she still didn't notice our drinks. We had to mention it to her. I know that sounds a little entitled, but there are expectations of service that used to be standard. You always refill a drink u[ to and while food is on the table or AT LEAST ask to. Half way into our meals we lost interest in the $4 chips and salsa sample. The entrees were great. At the very least the kitchen is still staffed be good people. I always order the steak fajitas, medium rare, and I eat the steak like a steak and then make veggie tacos out of the rest. I fricken love it. This time I was not disappointed. The steak was not medium rare (they never get that right) but it was still delicious. My dinner companion had a 7oz sirloin and it too was mouth-watering and juicy. Also not cooked as ordered (medium) but that meant I got the redder portions so, no complaint from me there... We actually got asked if we wanted another refill before we completed our meals. That was nice. However, after we had finished out food we had the desert/drink menu in hand and the waitress walks up and plops the check down and walks away. I may have some strong ideas about service but I don't know any manager that would train tyheir staff to miss an opportunity to offer drinks and deserts. That's not how you sell. So, it may have been mean but, we left no tip and stopped at DQ for a cone on the way home. We've already blacklisted the Applebee's on Baseline at 24th St. because of similar service, getting orders and drinks completely wrong, and billing us for things we did not order. This one is going on the list as well. Next time we'll drive all the way out to Baseline and 51st Ave. They seem to still understand customer service out there."
Rudy E.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,4.0,5/8/2016,"The food was fantastic, the new menu is great, the new attire is awesome, the maple pecan sweet mashed patoato is out of this world, Ross was too cool."
Michael R.,"Phoenix, AZ",14,25,70,2.0,4/9/2015,Applebees is a good place to go the service is great and the drinks are good and great places especially happy hour they have these amazing Wong tan tacos but there wings and cheese sticks are horrible the marinara and cheese sticks are always cold and the wings suck they deffinately need to know how to make wings I make better ones at home that people would pay money for
Jessica T.,"Chandler, AZ",0,9,,1.0,8/20/2015,"I used to love going to Applebees for their beer on tap. Their beer is still really good and reasonably priced, but that would be my only reason for ever going back here! Applebees has changed their menu since I've last been here. They raised their prices and cut back their portions. My husband ordered a burger which was $11 and subpar. Red Robin has the same tasting hamburgers but charges less.  This restaurant charges $2.50 just to swap out french fries for onion rings. They also had these game systems on the tables. You can play trivia and other games while you wait but each game adds .99 cents onto your bill. .99 cents isn't a lot of money but why add to your bill to play a game when you should be socializing with who you are out to dinner with anyways?? It's just really petty to charge extra for stupid little things. Especially when the food and atmosphere is not that great at all."
Alan H.,"Chandler, AZ",11,119,61,3.0,11/2/2015,Wasn't great but it hit the spot. Meaning all I had was a side salad! Ordered a tea and it took awhile to get that! The menu was hard to find the side salad - must have looked for it through the menu 3-4 times before I found it. Wasn't wanting their soup and salad all you can eat. It came out fairly reasonable amount of time.
Lindsey C.,"Tempe, AZ",52,284,44,2.0,1/11/2015,Typical chain food.  Nothing special.  Wait staff seemed like they'd rather be elsewhere.
Chris L.,"Irvine, CA",4,9,3,3.0,1/25/2016,Food was good. Price is fair. Portions were small. Went in for lunch and service was slow for a couple salads.
Natalie L.,"Chandler, AZ",55,15,,1.0,9/18/2015,Such a bummer that I have to change a review from really good to bad. On 09/06/2016 I placed an order over the phone to go for my husband to pick up once he got off work. There isn't an applebees near us in South Chandler and this location is close to his work. When he got home as we were ready to set everyones dinner we were missing one full kids order and half of another kids order. My husband headed back with ALL of the food because we werent going to eat our food cold or eat our food before our kids did. Took it all back for them to remake the entire order. We definitely don't complain to look for handouts but you would think because of how much of an inconvenience this was they would offer more than a dessert which we never even ended up getting anyways. My husband was told he was good to go that they guaranteed it. Once again he got home with food and still a kids order was missing a side. I really hope this staff gets a little more coaching. Our kitchen is under quarantine with no access to a stove or microwave because of a mold issue so we have had to rely on take out for the past few days and having to deal with messed up orders makes everything just that much more frustrating.  I give this place 5 stars because I walked in during lunch hour hoping to get an easy to go order since I was in a hurry and although at first one of the waitresses said it was going to be a very long time she did go double check and the manager and a server came out and said they could do it in about 15 min. As I was standing there waiting I was definitely not ignored several servers passed by me and asked if I was being helped and the bartender even offered me something to drink while I wait. Kuddos to them for the effort and thank you for filling my order very quickly on such a busy hour.
Jeffrey S.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,6,,3.0,2/21/2016,"Applebee's is nothing speical. I ordered their Bacon Burger and was asked if I wanted it pink or not pink. Generally I like Medium rare, but they don't do that. I choose Pink and got a 'well done' probably Mircowaved burger that seemed to have semi burnt burger flakes from a previous burger. The person I was with also had aburger the results were the same. The fries were fine and the waitress did a fine job. But like most experences at big chains, I end up leaving full yet unimpressed"
Bobby K.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,2.0,8/4/2016,"I can understand why the LOW mark on this place.. Sitting at bar I have not been acknowledged once after the change in shift..  Money on counter, menu on counter 3-4 people and ZERO SERVICE... Guess I'm not eating here today..!!!  I guess they don't like locals or maybe just serving Customers..!!  Even management has no eye for detail... Might understand if busy, but come on ... Only 3-4 of us .. Sucks!!!"
Dan W.,"Gilbert, AZ",19,54,71,2.0,3/2/2014,"My streak of good reviews has come to an end.  Now if we can just do the same to Justin Beiber's life expectancy. I guess it was my fault for choosing to eat at a chain restaurant after lunch rush when the servers were trying to get their side work done and get out.  Not even going to go into the details of what we ordered otherwise than to say it was incorrect, disappointing, took an excessive amount of time to prepare, and overall was a waste of time and money. I'm so frustrated with the restaurant and service industry. I hear often servers and other related staff complain about bad tippers. ""If you can't afford to tip, don't go out to eat."" How many times have you heard someone say that?  I have a better saying. If you aren't good at your job. Go find another one and save the rest of the world from having to deal with your horrible work ethic combined with the American sense of entitlement. Just because you work in a profession that involves tips doesn't mean you earned any."
Dee P.,"Chandler, AZ",0,10,,1.0,1/18/2016,After waiting several minutes a family of 5 came in African American asked for Michelle also African American. The family appeared to know each other. The hostess helping us said can you sit at this table located in bar. Yes ..Were cleaning it now.the aggressive family whispered to Michelle who grabbed menus and sat them at our wsiting table although we had been wanting 15 minutes and same amount of people in our party.  Michelle was rude and the hostess told her they were her first..she first walked the loud lady over came back and got the kids and the man went to sit down later..when i brought this up oh sorry it will be a few more minutes..we left we wont ever return.rude rude Michelle practice what you preach on MLK day..
ponyboy b.,"Tahoe Vista, CA",13,38,25,1.0,3/31/2014,"I've eaten at a few Applebee's before and I can't say the food or service was bad. With this location, the question is, how long do you have to wait for your meal? ( esp. when the place is half empty) After 15 minutes maybe the server could say your meal will be here soon or would you care for some tortilla chips while you're waiting? After 20 minutes, still nothing......25 minutes ...no food, no response from the server. At 30 minutes, sorry Applebee's .... You've been Chopped! I'm out of here."
Xi L.,"New York, NY",174,478,176,4.0,12/26/2015,"I dig their quesadilla burgers and triple chocolat meltdowns, it gets me every time. The quesadilla burger is a work of art, its not messy at all to eat, has the feel and texture of a proper quesadilla with the tortilla bun and somehow the final cook along with all of the toppings come out perfectly and in tact. The flavor is is great and consistency is for the most part there. This time we also had a loaded brisket enchilada and that was decent. They give you enough meat to keep you satisfied, comes with rice, salsa, jalapenos, cheese, etc. Yea we went full Mexican for this lunch. Finishing it all off we had the almighty triple chocolate meltdown aka the best lava cake money can buy HOWEVER this time the brownie wasnt super hot as it usually is, it was room temp, the fudge was warm but not hot like it normally is. If it was piping hot, the contrast with the vanilla ice cream is what melts your heart away, and is a clear 10/5 on all time best desserts. My other fav dessert around here is the Pizookie from BJ's Brewery and that always comes out hot. Sad, but still 4/5 overall."
R G.,"Maricopa, AZ",0,1,,2.0,11/9/2016,"Went with my son and a friend of ours on a weekday night. It was Nov. 3rd to be exact. First of all the menu doesn't have as many good selections as it used to. I just wasn't in the mood for anything on the menu and I used to love going to AppleBee's. Our waiter came and right away I felt as though I was bothering him. The impression we received is (I have a lot to do hurry and tell me what you want). This is the first review I am giving on yelp, yet realize this has to be read by the establishment (or so I would hope) and they then can work on what needs to be improved. About half way through the meal I don't know what happened but the waiter became friendlier which was nice. The appetizers were good though. The main point of my review is to let servers know to please treat customers friendly from the beginning to end. I am sure they work hard and the customers who came in most likely worked hard all day as well. As for the menu well I probably won't ever go to an Applebee's again. Food selection wasn't good."
Hong H.,"Santa Ana, CA",281,250,186,4.0,12/2/2013,"Surprising the Roma Pepper Steak was delicious. Waiter knew how they made their steaks  and ensured I would get medium rare, the red tomato topping added a good tangy taste. Red potatoes were soft and great. Portobello mushroom with artichoke cheese spread good also. I enjoyed the plate."
Laurie K.,"Chandler, AZ",60,113,15,2.0,3/15/2015,All the Applebee's are closing without notice.  This is the 3rd Applebee's we have been to today that wasn't out of business! The biggest complaint is BRING A SWEATSHIRT!! Every Applebee's is always cold.  To the point of uncomfort! Food and drinks are always good and prices are reasonable.  Don't know why they are all closing!
Kirsten N.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",11,73,14,1.0,7/14/2013,"The place needs a facelift, badly. It felt grungy; there was a stain of some kind on one of the seats at our table and the table was sticky. Our daughter's ""cheese pizza"" was on a tortilla and the cheese was not melted all the way along with WAY too much sauce. Either the waitress or the chef got my order wrong (a totally different dish than I ordered) so while my family ate I had to wait for my food to be remade. Only good part about our experience was that we had a gift card so we only paid $13 after tip."
