Jay C.,"Atlanta, GA",4,89,2,4.0,7/9/2014,"Management must have had a come to Jesus talk with the employees. I almost didn't go after reading the reviews but, I was really craving one of their dishes so I braved it and was pleasantly surprised with fast, friendly service and good food prepared exactly as ordered. Not great food - I mean it is Applebees, not gourmet. Two beers for the price of one helped too."
April F.,"Enterprise, AL",10,2,,1.0,12/15/2017,Was here from out of town. Worst experience ever. Waited for 35 mins to be seated while several tables sat empty. Instead of turning us away they told us it would only be a 30 min wait but they didn't have enough staff and was waiting to seat us. Only sat us and the 4 parties ahead of us because we all complained. Waitress was terrible. Blaring music.
Sharon B.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",27,84,174,1.0,6/20/2016,"We were sadly disappointed that they didn't have the riblet dinners like they used to before but we decided to stay. That was probably one of the biggest mistakes we made. The garlicky green beans were very Bland , the rice was very dry and has no moisture whatsoever , and all of the portion sizes were unusually small. The service was horrible beginning with the  Hostess seating us and then having to wait for the server. It was a Monday evening and it wasn't busy but you would never know that with the kind of food and service that we got.  If this is supposed to be a new and improved Applebee's they missed it by a long shot from service to food to the whole experience. We are never coming back here!!! We do NOT recommend this place to anyone."
Greg W.,"Helen, GA",1,4,1,1.0,12/18/2016,"This will be our last trip here. When you have to wait 10 mins to get your drink order taken and you can count the number of guests in the establishment, you know it is not a good place. We played it safe with the appetizer or so we thought but nay nay. They managed to serve stale chips with the salsa that were inedible . The entrees were mediocre at best. It's safe to say that the management here should consider an alternate career path because it is apparent managing is not for them."
Dave P.,"Saint Simons Island, GA",3,74,51,1.0,12/6/2015,"If I could give it zero, I would.  Other reviews online said that service was slow, and it looked rather disorganized. I went to this Applebee's very reluctantly since it's one of the only few places that's open on the late Sunday afternoon. Drove into town, and was starving as I've had no lunch. Walked in, sat at the bar. After waiting 4 to 5 minutes I got up and left. People were milling all about, around the bar, around the managers office, etc. but no one ever greeted me or even acknowledged my existence......."
Levi K.,"Thomasville, GA",0,11,1,1.0,2/17/2013,"The food is consistently prepared incorrectly and without quality standards. Even though patrons complain, the food preparers are unable to meet any consistent standards. Restrooms are often dirty. Management is very lacking in the friendliness category. Our recent server did a fine job but unfortunately the food quality was poor."
Michael H.,"Glenpool, OK",0,3,,1.0,1/13/2014,I stopped and had dinner at Applebee's late on a Sunday evening.  I walked in the door and it seemed to me that the bartender and the other staff instantly got angry.  No one greeted me or pointed me in a direction to be seated.  I finally just sat at the bar.  Was then greeted with a forced hello and asked for a drink order.  I ordered the simplest food to prepare that the menu offered. A wedge salad and chicken strips.  It took 40 minutes to receive the salad with hardly any other guest there.  No tomatoes on the salad and dressing was very watery.  Chicken was fine.  Poor manager was having a tough time with staff as they seamed to only argue with her orders.  Staff seamed overjoyed to lock the door at 10pm.  Then it sounded like the kitchen was being destroyed and very noisy ruining any shred of the dining experience.  Very poorly ran restaurant by people who don't want to be there.  Avoid this place for dining.  I was really worried that they done something bad to my food.
