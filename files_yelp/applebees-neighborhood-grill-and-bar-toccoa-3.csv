Joseph H.,"Toccoa, GA",80,1,,5.0,1/3/2018,"One of the best Applebee's I have been to. Great staff overall, stayed in touch and on top of things. Management was great, and even came out to talk with my table even though there were no issues. Great specials and good spot to get steaks in the Toccoa area."
Leon O.,"Toccoa, GA",27,15,27,2.0,6/13/2017,I eat there from time to time. The menu is very good.  Sometimes the service is also good.  They have a survey that you can fill out at the table.  I comment when the help is not available.   Recently we went in for a dessert and the water said he had to prepare it himself.  Management is inattentive allowing high points for food with recognized inattentiveness to customers resulting in a 2 star rating.  Good bet if in no big hurry.
Patrick M.,"Rome, GA",79,6,2,1.0,2/28/2017,"Waiters at this establishment are more concerned about hooking up with guest than making sure their other tables are taken care of. Even heard one waiter tell the guest ""I'm trying really hard not to look at your boobs."" Really they should do a better job of training. My family wasn't able to enjoy our dinner. Probably won't be coming back. I'd rather travel to longhorn in Cornelia."
Tonya H.,"Lavonia, GA",15,97,49,4.0,5/5/2016,We eat here a good bit and have never had any issues. The staff is always nice. The food has always been good and what we ordered. It not any better or an worse than other Applebee's. That being said eat the hell is the deal with the menus!? They took off most of the items I liked. And added all this stupid bar food. I don't know anyone who goes here for the bar. And the menus change every month. Just leave crap alone! But these issues are all Applebee's not just this location.
Cliff C.,"Louisville, TN",3,80,3,2.0,1/22/2016,"First visit to Applebee's in several years. A great disappointment. The menu is a challenge. Confusing. A party of three.i ordered a salad with shrimp that appeared to be a healthy and tasty choice. Too much dressing and not a lot of flavour, a rating of two is being kind. Wife's dish was another. Applebee's is a no go for us in the future."
Ashley B.,"Canon, GA",21,22,,3.0,7/24/2015,"It's pretty hit or miss with the quality of the service and the food. I've gone and had an A+ experience, but another time I can get a hateful waitress and completely screwed up food.  I complained to a waitress once and she brought me my sauce, but it tasted like chemicals. I complained to management but they didn't seem to care.  If you go on a good day, it's a great place to go. But you never know."
Jim H.,"Toccoa, GA",4,31,12,1.0,2/6/2016,"Had Carside last night.   The food was OK,  but the service was very poor.   No one ever came to the CAR!   After 10 minutes I went in and still not ready.  This could be an exceptional restaurant,  but service is never their strong suit.  The food was OK but not worth the prolonged wait."
Amber P.,"Winder, GA",19,35,,1.0,4/23/2014,"You'd think at Applebee's a decent lunch would be easy to come by. But, like every other restaurant in this area, you'd be so very wrong. Waitress couldn't explain why kids root beer didn't have free refills (I just want to know WHY it's only the root beer. Why?), our food took 40 minutes (even though there were only five other tables full in the restaurant and at was 2 p.m.), our food was weird. Some was so hot you couldn't touch it, other orders were so cold you could barely stand it, and the broccoli was cooked in a bowl that had some sort of cooked on brown crap in the bottom of it. After calling a manager to the table she did take $12 off our order (there were six of us), but then said that we had only been there 30 minutes waiting for sandwiches and chicken fingers - not 40. Oh, well then that's acceptable isn't it, you moron. I like my Applebee's usually, but somehow the mouth-breathers that live in Lake Hartwell full time managed to totally mess up something as simple as a BLT. That might deserve an award of some sort."
Ashley R.,"Toccoa, GA",0,1,1,1.0,2/26/2014,This is a big disappointment. We got the 2 for $20. I ordered the 7oz steak Medium. My steak taste like I'm eating charcoal. The cook is obviously an idiot and doesn't know the difference between well done and medium. The mashed potatoes taste like they were already made weeks ago and then just zapped in the microwave. Save your money and NEVER eat at this place. I want my money and time back.
Ken G.,"Toccoa, GA",0,61,2,2.0,11/17/2013,"Perfect example of a chain restaurant that 20 years ago was a destination location. Today it's not. Bourbon Street steak was a huge disappointment from what it once was and cuts in quality of food is painfully apparent. Unfortunately they don't have a lot of competition in Toccoa, so I don't expect any improvements. I still stop in from time to time for a beer at the bar. It's the one thing I can count on that hasn't changed. :-)"
Eleanor W.,"Nashville, TN",6,56,21,3.0,12/4/2012,"Steak was tender. Quesadillas were passable. The night we visited must have been a short-staffed evening. Our service was slow but then, we weren't in a hurry. We did overhear three other parties at tables complaining loudly about food and service. I think it must have just been an off-night."
