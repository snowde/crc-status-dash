Marty E.,"San Antonio, TX",0,107,31,3.0,9/10/2017,Very good service and the flavor was great... the only ding is the steak was tough. ( the steak had grissel throughout). I was offered another... time was important and I did not have time for a redo. However the manger did take the steak off of our bill and the waitress was very nice and professional. They did the right thing it was simply a bad cut of meat... no fault of theirs. And like I stated earlier the flavor was great. And every effort was put forth to make it right. I would definitely visit again.
Angela H.,"Huntsville, AL",86,53,37,3.0,7/21/2017,"Appetizers arrived without plates. Took a while for our lunch specials to come, on the cold side.   Service was ok."
Mike B.,"Dugway, UT",32,6,1,1.0,11/11/2017,"This Applebee's will leave you with one of two conclusions; the service , cold food , and empty feeling you leave with is  1) on par with that Tool-ee backwoods kinda environment, 2) Applebee's is not what you remember from 1997 ... either way you loose!"
Zack M.,"Madison, AL",83,36,111,2.0,5/17/2017,"The food is okay. The beer is cold but if u want a mixed cocktail, its made behind a closed door where you cant see wtf goes in your drink. Not a fan. Family establishment only. Our bartender Stephen was really cool. He accommodated my minor changes to a dish i preferred."
Teresa S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",1,42,2,5.0,4/7/2017,"We have eaten here twice since we moved to the area. Both times I was impressed with how good I found the dishes. I went in expecting it to be Applebee's average fair, which is okay. Instead, I found it very good. The service was excellent the first time. The second time we had to wait a little longer on coffee refills but they were busy and it wasn't a cold evening where many people were drinking coffee. Not that I find any reason a 'good' reason, I think I just understood and could have pressed the point. It wasn't that important to me on that evening."
Mario A.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,1,,5.0,11/4/2017,"Great choice, friendly and fast service. New management as new ownership. A different that you can tell highly recommend this place"
Reed P.,"Burley, ID",10,5,,4.0,7/15/2017,"We hadn't been to Applebee's in years because of a bad experience before. Down visiting family and we figured we'd give it another shot. The food, the prices, and the wait time on par with any chain restaurant. What made the experience enjoyable and worth going back was our waiter. Nathan was in a totally different ballpark. He was quick, friendly, and funny. Even with the long wait time (a group of nine so, yeah...), we didn't stop laughing and enjoying the experience from the time we sat down until we headed home. I will be back, if nothing more than to simply see how he is doing."
John Paul W.,"Louisville, CO",60,8,2,4.0,6/13/2017,Good service. Server helped us with our order & self check out. She even brought more sauce out for my meal after noticing my food could use a little more ( even though the dish tasted fine)
Robert J.,"Ontario, CA",1,70,51,1.0,2/19/2017,"Was here yesterday, same as every other Applebee's I've been to. This one SUX'S as well! I made a commitment to my wife never to go to Applebee's again."
Thad T.,"Yuma, AZ",39,7,2,1.0,2/20/2017,"Absolutely most worthless Applebees i've ever been to. I showed up alone so ""attempted"" to sit at the bar but over half the seats still had empty plates from previous patrons. Chose a table and was handed a menu and not even greeted. 30 minutes later I still hadn't even met my waitress let alone be asked what I wanted to drink. 35 minutes in I left. 100% management to blame."
Mr R.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,13,3,1.0,12/27/2016,"Its winter, cold , and yes there is snow on the ground.  I'm visiting Family in Tooele. On my last night I wanted to take them to dinner. Applebee's was chosen. My mom requires handicap parking. There was so much packed snow and ice it was safer to park in regular parking where the snow had been cleared. Why you wouldn't clear all the spaces is unclear to me. Jakob our waiter was awesome. He is also the dishwasher?. It was all good until The food was served. Jakob was apparently doing the  dishes . We were Served by 3 girls (why there was 3 I have no idea). There were 4 of us in our party. But the none of the Meals Came Out at the same time. In our family we eat all together. By the Time everyone had their food, it wasn't hot. Clearly the manager doesn't care for the customers safety, or the customer experience. But kudos for taking a dishwasher out Of The Back and Putting him In the front of The house."
Chris G.,"Salt Lake City, UT",4,22,17,1.0,3/19/2016,"Thinking of going here on a weekend night? DON'T DO IT! We made this mistake, and we had a terrible meal on a Friday night. Service is some of the worst I've had in a long time. I realize it's Applebee's, which is not a swanky place anyway, but I've recently had far better service in a GAS STATION, as opposed to this Applebee's. 45 mins after we were seated, we received our 1st (incomplete) round of sodas. Then, they brought out our salads and appetizers, but since we hadn't been given any silverware, some people chose to eat non-finger-food with their hands, and some of us waited. I asked our waitress FOUR TIMES over the next 10 mins for silverware! Finally, I was infuriated. and went to the serving station, and helped myself. On my way back, in an attempt to defuse my annoyance, our waitress mocked me for my initial attempt at eating my salad ""bird-style,"" without silverware. Having waited so long to eat our appetizers, because of the silverware situation, our entrees started arriving before we had a chance to eat the apps. Afraid of the inevitable service delay that would occur if we asked them to wait a few mins, we awkwardly shoe-horned the entrees onto our packed table. My Baby Back Ribs were truly the worst half-rack of ribs I've ever had. They were teeny! I'd estimate the length of the shortest rib to be about 2 1/2 inches long. (I wish I'd taken a pic!) They were almost devoid of actual meat, just sauce, bone, and connective tissue. (""Did anyone even feed this poor pig,"" I wondered?) Admittedly, my standards for good barbeque were recently expanded by my trip to Georgia, but these ribs honestly shouldn't impress anyone, regardless of exposure to real Southern food. I also had coleslaw that tasted like it came from a 5-gallon bucket, and about 20 fries. Sadly, the fries were the best part of the meal.  Summary: Go ANYWHERE ELSE - I'll never go back! I have been there several times before, and though not as bad as tonight, it's never been good, even on a sleepy Sunday afternoon. I honestly think I'd be embarrassed to work there, which may be why they were possibly short-staffed."
Mike B.,"Tooele, UT",29,66,27,1.0,3/11/2016,"The only saving grace in this establishment was our server. Her name was Sarah, a pretty, tall, dark haired woman. She was amazing, we have never had a better experience with a server.  Hopefully a cleaner establishment with fresh food and no mice offers her a job somewhere.  You should pay that server what ever you can to keep her."
Stephanie F.,"Tooele, UT",0,19,,1.0,2/27/2016,"This restaurant is poorly run.  Go elsewhere.  The wait staff is okay. They are not well trained though.  The kitchen management should be fired. The food is served with no pride in appearance.  I have been there several times and usually there is something burned or not fresh, such as burned hamburgers or fries that were sitting out.  This is one of the few ""bars"" in Tooele.  I think they ride on that rather than serve good food.  Unfortunately, the drinks (liquor based) are watered down and overpriced. But, that is typical for Utah. Applebees should be ashamed of this place.  The people of Tooele deserve better. Get better value for your money.  Go to Denny's, Wingers or Apollo burger!"
Yvette T.,"Oakland, CA",0,15,,1.0,10/11/2016,"We spent the entire week talking and laughing about this place. I'm really surprised it survives. The service is absolutely horrible. With no one else to be served we sat for 20 min before getting a menu. The food took about 40 min to appear. Still only 2 others in the restaurant. The food could have passed as a Denny's or other similar chain but the wait staff was so poorly trained that the whole experience was a joke.  There are other places opened in the late evening,but avoid this place totally .  Would give no stars if I could."
Jonny R.,"South Jordan, UT",0,34,14,4.0,6/20/2016,We come here Monday and Sunday for the burgers. 6.99 on these days. The brunch burger is good. Service is usually ok. We've waited longer then usual  a few times with new servers but what can you do? They have to train.
David S.,"Waconia, MN",0,16,,1.0,3/30/2016,They ran out of all kinds of beer. The manager is a dick and the bartender does not hear what you. Sat for 20 min trying to pay. And the receipt was wrong. May have problems expense this meal.
Cintia M.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",30,7,4,4.0,3/26/2016,"Our server Scott was awesome, even there was some wait time he was checking on us and made sure we had everything. Thanks Scott"
Danny A.,"La Mirada, CA",16,13,16,1.0,3/8/2016,"I can't believe people still discriminate in this day in age. I am Korean I've been to this place a couple of times with friends and say at the bar and had no problems. Today, I go in by myself, to be seated and ignored for ten minutes. No server to Royale a drink order, or any acknowledgement of any kind. The servers walked by avoiding eye contact. WTF people. F this place."
Virgil G.,"Salt Lake City, UT",4,19,,2.0,8/14/2015,"The food is average. The staff is friendly-ish and polite-ish, but try and get a cocktail there... I dare you. I did, and let me tell you something. Congress moves faster.  First I ordered. The. I was shown flash cards designated to educate me that I needed to order food in order to order a cocktail (That's a lot of ordering). Then to drive the point home, I was given a verbal quiz in reference to the flash cards to make sure I was paying attention. I passed with flying colors. Now you go through the interview stage. It's not sufficient for just your server to see your identification, but the lead server, assistant manager and the manager need to verify your age, eye color, hair color and your weight ( I have packed on a few pounds so there was a lengthy discussion of that was actually me in the ID photo). After the exams and the background check that would make the FBI proud you get to order....... And wait. And wait. And wait. It's kind of like waiting for your number to be called at the DMV, only your hungry....and thirsty. It took so long to get a sangria and a beer that I thought this establishment fermented their own wine and beer. After what seemed like a couple of birthdays, we finally got our drinks. Now it was time for the flash cards and oral exam for our food. Smh  All and all the place is average. If you order adult beverages, it's going to cost more than your meal. Two pints of Goose Island and that sangria cost close to 30 bones."
Reed G.,"Seattle, WA",0,32,4,1.0,5/9/2014,"Oh, how I wish I could post something worse than a one star review.  I definitely take half the blame for willingly walking into an Applebee's, but there aren't many options in Tooele and it was close to where we were staying. The service staff acted horribly toward us to the point that it was very uncomfortable.  I get it, I'm not Mormon and I'm not from your shit town.  Can you just try to smile and pretend to be nice for a little while?  I don't want to be here, either. Next time I'm in Tooele I'll just eat at Subway."
Ryan B.,"Voorhees, NJ",0,20,1,1.0,11/3/2015,"Food was acceptable, had better quality food from other Applebee's though. Staff was not friendly. Our waitress lacked customer service skills and smelled like an ashtray.  I don't think I will return."
Corban A.,"Tooele, UT",6,23,,1.0,5/7/2015,"What is it with the overzealous carding of ID's for people who want an adult beverage? We got carded twice by two different staff for the drinks we ordered with dinner. The manager then came around and was going to card us a third time (he was carding a table next to us again) and I said we were walking out the door if we got carded a third time. I saw the sign on the table saying be prepared for harassment if you want a drink, I get it but carding people multiple times by multiple staff for the same drinks is downright absurd. I understand this is Utah but this was a joke."
James S.,"Lake Point, UT",0,5,,3.0,8/3/2015,The service and food is very hit or miss.: I have been times where it was an absolute delight and other times where it was a nightmare.. All in all they lack consistency. If you like to gamble then look no more
Linda S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",30,24,16,1.0,7/30/2014,"It is the worst Applebee's I've been to. They were doing karaoke in the restaurant while we were eating. So dang loud!!! Can't even chat with friends sitting next to me. The medium cooked steak is also BURNED! Wow, if I can find other restaurant open, I will definitely not go there! But Tooele is such a tiny town that you basically cannot find anything better :("
Michael J.,"Magna, UT",10,28,29,3.0,5/3/2014,I think the food is pretty darn good. The service can be very lacking though. Have seen the waitress talking with another waitress two tables away while waiting on the check for over five minutes. Not a one time thing. But I still come back for the French onion soup and fried green beans.
Dawn C.,"Tooele, UT",0,5,,1.0,8/13/2014,"The worst Applebees ever! Raw burger, slow service. Steak was ok, however the potatoes not cooked all the way."
Steve S.,"Norwalk, CA",14,189,23,2.0,8/15/2011,"The night was like many other nights spent out on the road. A few days into a trip and the mind starts to wander. Sometimes, you never really are sure where that next culinary adventure will take you to. Sometimes, it's not much of an adventure at all. This is that story.  Non-event pretty much tells the story about any visit to an Applebees. I know people that love this chain, but I never really ever, ever come here unless I really have no other choice, or if i really just don't want to drive and it's the closest spot that I think won't give me the runs.  I walked in for a to go order and the staff was very friendly here. A little slow on the draw, but not rude or anything. I placed my order for a chicken wrap and onion rings and sat at the bar with a glass of water. Don't judge me on the water part. If you sat on the salt flats all day you wouldn't want anything else either.  I got my order at a reasonable pace and took it back to my hotel room. I ate the wrap and onion rings and meh... it was ok. I am pretty sure ""wrap"" is Applebees speak for ""cold burrito"". Either way, it was food, it went down and I didn't get the runs. There is nothing exceptional about any Applebees that I have ever been to and there really isn't anything special about this location either. They do have a pretty cool selection of photos and parts from Miller Motorsport Park which is down the way. Now THAT place is something special. Go check them out! You won't be missing anything here."
Andre B.,"San Francisco, CA",3,29,31,2.0,5/31/2011,"Ugh, yeah I have to agree with the other Yelpers! We were in town for the weekend (hence my other un-stellar ratings of other joints we ate at) and figured ""a huge national chain couldn't be that bad"" - eh wrong! We arrived at 8:30 ~ 9 pm and apparently it was slow so they let everyone go!? Sweet girl working our table was obviously very busy. She forgot the soup my friend ordered all together. Food and drinks took forever to get. Margarita wasn't bad and the chocolate malt/shakes were good too. Food was mediocre at best. My salad consisted of abused chopped romaine lettuce thrown (really, thrown!) on a plate, sprinkled with grated cheese and bacon bits. The mini sliders were good, cooked just right, but the presentation of all our dished was horrible. Food tasted OK just not the best looking. It was almost like the wait staff was cooking also."
Mike D.,"San Jose, CA",1,5,,5.0,6/10/2015,"Can't say enough about how great the service was from food server Lewanna! We had a family reunion of sorts and we chose Applebee's because we love the food. On this visit we received excellent service. I know Applebee's is kind of like a sports bar where they keep the music loud to ""create"" excitement, however our reunion was filled with conversation and we really wanted to just hear each other talk and enjoy a nice dinner. Some of us hadn't seen each other in years. Not only that, my dad and I were from out of state and we don't get to Utah very often to visit our family. I asked Lewanna if she could please turn down the music for awhile for us because we were having a hard time hearing each other talk. In the past, I've asked managers at restaurants to do this and was told that they couldn't do this! So, I was very pleased that she listened to my request. Our dinner was excellent, the food was fantastic (as always), but I was really impressed with Lewanna. Not just because she lowered the music volume for our table, but she was very attentive to our needs the entire time as well. I will keep coming back to this Applebee's and I will also recommend it to all my friends and family. Thanks again Lewanna for going above and beyond with such excellent customer service!!!"
Charity G.,"Tooele, UT",41,143,17,1.0,4/8/2013,"I am never impressed by this Applebee's. You usually have a long wait, the service is lacking and the food is not that good. I have had uncooked chicken served to me a couple times here. But if you want to have a drink and dinner it's one of your only options in town."
Michael M.,"Tooele, UT",0,18,,1.0,3/29/2015,"Worst Applebee's in the chain.  Food is not prepared correctly, the wait staff does not know what they are doing, very slow.  Plan on a really long wait."
Douglas S.,"Toronto, Canada",50,133,40,3.0,2/18/2013,"It's an Applebees. The Tooele location is better than the majority of the US locations. Staff is friendly, takes a second to say hello, and that keeps me coming back. Food is appropriate for cost/value. What prompted me to write a review is that my phone asked.  The atmosphere on a race night is very different than the atmosphere on a week night."
Evanne T.,"Salt Lake City, UT",39,37,,3.0,3/23/2013,"Our server was great. Although I was not very pleased after she ID me for my beer that then I was ID again (as she forewarned) by a rude manager,  before he even looked at my ID (which I am 45) said ""are you planning on eating?  I am holding the lunch menu at a booth with 2 others. Obviously I was there for lunch, if wanted to just drink beer Tooele has several ""bars"" in town that  I would much rather buy  and drink beer from. I really am not going to Applebees and sit at a booth with my 72 year old mother and 43 year old sister to ""drink beer"" SERIOUS!!!! He came across as  rude and unprofessional, with the way he handled the apparent ""required by law"" of beer sale.  So after twice showing ID to the 2 separate people, it was another 17 minutes before receiving my barely cold bottle of Budweiser. What made it worse was this rude, unprofessional manager barely looked old enough to be selling beer in the first place. again the embarrassed server we had was exceptionally good."
John C.,"West Valley City, UT",7,9,1,2.0,6/22/2011,Food is ok. Steaks seem to be getting smaller. Service is not regular.
Robert K.,"Pinole, CA",26,7,,2.0,9/16/2010,"Typical Applebees.  Service was OK, not stellar.  Had long wait between ordering and actually getting what we ordered - food, drink, etc.  Will eat there again, but only because there are really no choices for food in the area."
