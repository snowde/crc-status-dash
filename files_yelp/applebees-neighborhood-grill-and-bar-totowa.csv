Genavee W.,"East Orange, NJ",0,17,5,4.0,9/1/2017,I got exactly what I expected.  Applebees serves really good drinks and decent warm food at late night. The drinks were good and fresh and strong and the bartenders always will be on point(Shout out to Lady!). The kitchen stays open late like 2am late (yay!) but your food will never be hot(I deal with the heat lamp warmth). It's really the only thing open with semi- decent food at when I get off work late. Half off appetizers never hurt anyone and add to why I come here. Come for late night food and drinks and sit at the bar the service tends to be better.
Janelle W.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,14,5,1.0,11/9/2017,"Smh I honestly don't even know  exactly where  to start  about this applebees. My partner was satisfied with her breakfast burger that came with no mayo or ketchup on the bun nor inside of the bag. But my burger was like it was rushed.There was no cheese, mayo , ketchup (which I had to later pay for ) and my fries were soggy .  I understand if you're busy on a Thursday night but if I'm spending my hard earned money on ""don't wanna be bother type of food"" then I would of went to White Castle and Burger King  or something . Called for the manager who really doesn't even care but it's fine  Will never come back   you get what you paid for ."
Steve K.,"CORTLANDT MNR, NY",56,525,1726,2.0,9/11/2017,"Ordered House Classic Burger with side Caesar Salad. Good drinks, and reasonable priced. Ample parking. Enjoyed a local brewski of New Jersey lager. Many other draught beer as well. Someone needs to provide instruction how to dress and serve a basic Caesar Salad. Way over-dressed and leaves were wet. A mess. Croutons were cheap and unflavorful. A problem here and common to other Applebee's as well. These kind of details will always hold back Applebee's."
Charlotte P.,"Wayne, NJ",0,22,1,1.0,1/8/2018,This is by far one of the worst dinners my family has ever had. The place was so crowded with people it took forever to get a table. We all ordered ribs and they were absolutely disgusting. Never coming back to this location ever again. What a waste of money!
Sandra G.,"Little Falls, NJ",0,3,3,1.0,10/28/2017,"I ordered To-Go, the ""Oriental Salad""  was NOT appetizing!!! It was Cabbage Slaw mix with brownish small sliced almonds and string-bean tortilla strips and a few chunks of crispy chicken. #Nasty"
Colleen C.,"Little Falls, NJ",1,11,,3.0,7/5/2017,"This is your typical chain restaurant. The food is good; there is nothing to complain about but, at the same time, nothing to brag about. Applebee's is my go to place if my friends and I cannot decide where to eat and do not want to spend to much money. One major draw is the late night half off appetizers that start at 10. Applebee's has some delicious appetizers, particularly the beer pub pretzels. They are even more delicious when they are half off! The restaurant can get crowded during dinner and late night so anticipate a wait, especially on the weekends.  I have never had the drinks but the Oreo milkshake is from the bar and I know that is delicious! The servers are always friendly and efficient. They are particularly good at giving refills before you even ask! The restaurant is very loud and crowded at times.  The parking is good, I have never had a problem finding a spot. A great spot for dinner and drinks with friends."
Alicia A.,"Edgewater, NJ",0,9,10,4.0,11/21/2017,"I don't know why they have only 2 stars. I think they deserve more than 2 stars. Sitting was nice and comfortable, their food was very tasty, clean and affordable. I haven't been to Apple bees for so long but than I decided why not to give it another shot? I really liked this place. I will definitely be back soon!"
Chris K.,"Kinnelon, NJ",1,7,,1.0,10/14/2017,This is Day 2. We still have not been called in for a table. We are thirsty and hungry and we are losing hope. We called on this Applebee's for nourishment and have been sorely disappointed. I will no longer be taking our business to this Restaurant.
Michele D.,"Wayne, NJ",441,255,1079,2.0,9/16/2016,This place is mehhh. The food is average at best. Prices are comparable to other chain restaurants. The best thing they have going here is the half price apps after 10pm and their bar area is a good size. So looking for drinks and apps then go in if not keep on driving by.
Cha V.,"Newark, NJ",44,59,13,1.0,10/21/2017,"I just left and I was so disappointed. All day I just wanted to eat some buffalo wings and drink a nice cold beer. Where do I start. . . I always ask the waiter for ranch instead of blue cheese and they always forget it, I'm used to it, so when I got the blue cheese, I was fine with it. I just waited for the waiter to let him know I needed the ranch. That wasn't the problem, the problem was that the waiter argued with me insisting that what I got was ranch, when it was freaking blue cheese! I know the difference, trust me, they've screwed up my request every single time so I know the difference. Then, they forgot my beer. Whatever, it's fine I can live without the beer. The waiter comes at the end with my beer and says he forgot the beer. Okay cool, I understand, it's Saturday night and busy. I was already a little irritated with the whole ranch situation but whatever, we can move on. But it wasn't over. He comes over with the check and I noticed he charged us full price for the apps. So I addressed  him he says, half price apps are after 10. Every Applebee's I've been to starts half price apps after 9:30. And if it was the case that half price apps started after 10, why would you not tell us when we first place the orders. Not wait until the end when you give us the check. Come on man, it's not difficult to be considerate. Needless to say, I won't be back here anymore."
Kim M.,"Bloomfield, NJ",214,117,123,1.0,10/21/2016,"Now I really hate to do this because I do frequent this applebees SO OFTEN!  But unfortunately applebees you have truly disappointed on this.   Most orders are carside, but my sister in law's 21st bday is today and she wanted to go to Applebee's prior to her big night out.  Well, my husband called to make a reservation for 12 people at 745.  Our whole party was here at 730 and we were extremely patient - so patient that we waited OVER an hour. Now here's the thing - the host, not sure of his name....but he started getting snippy with my husband saying....we had another large party call in...and his only response is that we would have to wait ANOTHER whole hour if we wanted to sit together.  We had a 93 year old man and 4 children...we cannot wait 2 hours for dinner - so we spoke to the manager WITHOUT resolution - so we are sitting separately celebrating two different birthdays.  Parties are upset and hungry and truly disappointed.   The management's excuse...well it's Friday - we get really busy... r u kidding me? We called...we were all here on time - we should have been accommodated....what happened to the customers always right?   Guess I am sticking to carside....IF I ever come back...."
Cinthya G.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",124,46,15,5.0,11/13/2016,"My family and I went to eat dinner, we had a great experience from the minute that we walked in until the minute that we walked out. We were sitted right away, the waiters were very nice and friendly. All the food that we ordered got to our table right away and it was delicious. I also ordered a new drink that I highly recommend..is called a raspberry cosmo"
L M.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,5,2,1.0,10/25/2017,"I'm actually still here, came her with my daughter after a movie for an early dinner. . My order was very simple 2 for 20 and boneless BBQ wings and a $1 margarita. The margarita looked like dirty water and taste like it too. The boneless wings were drenched in BBQ sauce and super hard. . .I guess they figure if they put a ton of sauce on them that they'll soften up by the time they get to your table. . .not true, still very hard. My daughter got the chicken finger and fries and they were ok. . .I got the cheese burger and fries. . I guess they ran out of fries because my entire plate was full of the bottom of the bag fries, you know the really short ones. . .I then asked the waiter to ask the bartender to turn the TV facing me to the game and he gave him a hard time. . That's when I asked to have the rest of my food to go. . .just when I thought it was safe to come back to this one they proved me wrong. . Next time I'll go to the super market and buy some bag chicken tenders and fries and ground beef and cook my own food. . .a complete waste of $34"
Jackie B.,"NJ, NJ",75,1,,1.0,10/15/2017,Most horrible customer service I have ever experienced here at the RT 46 one. Specifically and waiter named Kat wrote down all the order but apparently forgot my order waited 45 minutes for my order after the rest of the table got their order...I never got mine I eventually had to cancel my order and go eat elsewhere. This is ridiculous
Tom S.,"Rutherford, NJ",407,141,35,1.0,1/7/2017,I really want to like this place but every time I go the food is just awful and I usually get stomach cramps or worse afterwards.  Maybe for just drinks it's ok but I won't be going back here for awhile.
Sean M.,"Clifton, NJ",70,2,,1.0,8/20/2017,"Worst restaurant visit I have ever had! Where to start... Our waiter sucked! When he would come to tell us stuff he would just run past the table and would say something and not even make eye contact, we could barely hear what he was saying... Then when our food came out my Boyfriends steak was definitely rare and he ordered medium, which happens sometimes but then when our waiter asked us if everything is good my boyfriend said ""No, my steak"" and the waiter cut him off and said one second. Finally after going to 3 other tables he came over and took the steak to be cooked more. When he came back with it you could tell that it was  microwaved and it wasn't even cooked anymore! Also they gave him the wrong side and his potatoes were dried up on the top like they were sitting there forever. Also my food had absolutely no taste to it.Definitely will never come back here!"
Jeffrey D.,"Paterson, NJ",3,19,1121,3.0,7/10/2016,"I've been coming here for ~12 years (long time lol), and they're pretty reliable, especially for a franchise. Some hiccups here and there with service, but they can be consistent at times."
Maria V.,"Newark, NJ",5,31,30,1.0,1/9/2017,Host thought he was this  funny kid but all he was doing is insulting his coworkers in front of customers.  1st thing that went wrong. I should of walked out with my son and mom.  We sat down took us 10 mins to get a high chair / booster seat anything really for him. Service was bad!!! If she was new then she def shouldn't of been alone she had no people skills no waiting skills it. Food then took forever it was 12 in the afternoon.  the place wasn't packed most people coming here for lunch and wow there lunch breaks if they were working was shot... I've come here in the past and this will be my last visit!
John F.,"Toms River, NJ",20,4,,1.0,2/24/2017,Horrible service. Long waits and definitely worth the wait! Need to get there act together
Jason M.,"Bloomfield, NJ",15,24,3,4.0,12/20/2016,"My Wife and I went there recently not bad at all, We both had the Fiesta Lime Chicken and it was amazing, so much so I tried to copy it, Mine was better, but for a chain restaurant wheres was pretty good!"
Rainman G.,"Hillsdale, NJ",105,14,,2.0,12/20/2016,"I love Applebees, but this is definitely my least favorite one in the area. The service is unbelievably slow and at times rude. The food isn't great either. I don't know why this one is so different from the other local ones, but I would absolutely recommend going to a different Applebees nearby."
Derrick G.,"Little Falls, NJ",1,32,,5.0,7/21/2016,"2ond best place to watch the RANGERS! The best place is at Madison Square Garden but I'm nto allowed back there because I punched this Devils fan that turned out to be a woman, shed not looked like a woman. My dude Danny loves the cheeseburger eggrolls but I don't eat chiness food. If you love the NY RANGERS and Fireball shots as much as me and Danny, you should come watch here."
Luis L.,"Wayne, NJ",179,2,,1.0,11/3/2016,Out of the numerous Applebee's I've gone over the years this one has always been the one with the worst service ever. Buddy of mine got denied a drink because he only had his military ID. We were told to pick our own seating then never got a waiter and we ended up leaving. This place is trash.
Richard M.,"Weehawken, NJ",1,9,,1.0,9/18/2016,"Probably the worst service we have experienced in years. My wife and I have just moved to Totowa so took my brother in laws out for dinner to this Applebee's. My steak came out dry and hard as rubber. I waited for the server to let her know, she was so rude saying ""well how do you want it then?"" I didn't want my brother in laws to have a bad time so I stayed calm while she whipped the plate away and stormed off. I waited over half an hour for her to come back. She then made me cut into the steak while she watched to tell her it was ok. I've never experienced this kind of hostility from a server. Everyone had finished their meals when she eventually came back with my food. Not once did she come by to check on us or offer us any more drinks. Dirty plates were left on the table. Luckily they have the payment machines on the table or we would still be sitting there."
Anthony P.,"East Hanover, NJ",417,5,,1.0,2/14/2017,"The waiter left my beer at the bar for 30 mins, never offered me water, gave everyone else at the table their drinks. I had to ask the manager for the beer and she picked up the beer that was sitting there for a half hour and put it in front of me to drink... a flat beer. I made her get me a new one. This is by far the worst applebees I have ever visited and I will no longer go to this applebees. I will go to the Parsippany Rt 46 location. The waiters, bartenders, and managers are EXCELLENT. I would make whoever I was with drive the extra 20 mins instead of eating at the Totawa location... the best part of all is THEY DIDNT EVEN COMP ME FOR THE BEER. They made me pay for it! A flat beer that was sitting at the bar for 30 mins had to be payed for! Terrible service, terrible management. I could have ran that place better. Applebees should hire one of the managers from parsippany to run that place. If it wasn't for the parsippany location, I would never go to another applebees."
Sara S.,"Wayne, NJ",103,34,91,4.0,10/21/2014,"For a chain restaurant it's pretty good, and prices are very reasonable. I've been here at least 20 times in the past 2 years, never been disappointed. I usually get the 2 for $20. Artichoke dip & 3 cheese chicken penne gotta be my fav. However, some drinks are high in price. Service is always great. I try Not to order meat and I ask for my pasta without chicken because personally I do not like the quality of the meat here (sometimes I forget so I end up moving it to the side ), but hey it's cheap so what do you expect? However, overall this is a good place to eat at"
Mike T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,,2.0,5/11/2016,"Wanted a quick cold beer and something to eat. Sat at the bar, server came over and I asked for a beer and a menu. No coaster or napkin placed. After 8 attempts to fill the pint, she settled on giving me a 2 inch beer head of foam. Obviously, keg was near empty or too much pressure. I suggested another beer, was told its fine. Separate server places my food order in front of me and walks away. I have still not been given silverwear. I watch as she wipes down the bar area and equipment, finally i ask for eating utensils.  Was really looking forward to a no-frill ordeal but overall it just disappointed me. Paid my check and left."
Salorahy R.,"Paterson, NJ",0,3,24,3.0,1/19/2016,The food was good but the waitress  checked on us every five minute and that really annoyed me.
Luznery F.,"Fort Meade, MD",6,108,113,1.0,3/9/2015,"This place absolutely sucks ,the service is terrible. As our waitress was busy tending tables,the manager Francisco is walking around asking how we were doing ""clearly simply checking the box ""we expressed the need of drink refills and napkins  and this fool had the nerve to say I'll get your server....really..... no! go get me a drink and everything else we need. What a  poor excuse for leadership!!! This place is wack the food is sub-par and trust the leadership or lack there of has a lot to do with it..."
Victoria B.,"Little Falls, NJ",0,2,,3.0,9/8/2015,"Just enjoyed a pleasant lunch with my husband and two month old. We were seated promptly, but did have to wait about 5-10 minutes for a server. I do not blame the server because he manager was holding them in a meeting. The communication between staff could be improved upon.  Our server Lauren and attentive and extremely on point but not intrusive. The ordered a couple appetizers to share...the Siracha Shrimp, Pub Pretzels, and Buffalo Wings. All three were delicious."
Austin V.,"Bloomfield, NJ",19,5,,1.0,3/19/2016,"Food was cold and nasty and took them 45 minutes to get it, the place was not packed either. Service was terrible and workers had an attitude.."
Christine S.,"Montclair, NJ",173,120,30,5.0,1/3/2015,How can you not come here. They are family oriented and during the holidays have toys for tots. It's wonderful!!!!
Abigail G.,"Mount Arlington, NJ",24,16,9,1.0,7/25/2016,"Not a good experience at all. Waitress was kind took our drink orders, returned in a timely fashion. I ordered a sirloin steak, the pictures depict a thin cut of sirloin so I ordered it medium rare, it was the size and bulk of my fist and came out raw. I would have kindly asked for it to be cooked longer but he waitress was no where to be found after serving our food until probably 30 minutes later. I ordered another round of drinks before our food came out from the ""presto"" machine on the table but never received them. (On a side note I find it ridiculous you charge $2 to play the trivia game on that machine but that's really beside the point, I guess it's just another way to make a buck). At the end I asked to have my steak wrapped up and the waitress looked confused as to why I hadn't eaten it. I told her it was undercooked and she offered taking it back, after everyone had eaten. She showed us how to pay on the presto machine and we never saw her again. The presto machine automatically added 20% tip to our bill with a choice to lower the percentage which I did. I tip based on service received, not on the meal itself, and our waitress was kind but never checked on us, she got us drinks, didn't even bring our food, and showed us how to pay on the machine, and I'm supposed to tip her 20%? Why? They made the entire experience almost free from human contact. So silly. Probably the last time I eat at a chain."
Jess R.,"Beach Haven, NJ",78,2,,1.0,9/5/2016,"Francisco the manager drove this place into the ground. I Literally spit the rubbery and fishy tasting Salmon out on the plate it was so bad, then Francisco asks me if I would like to take it home along with the second entree that arrived 10 minutes after the first because it was wrong and they had to remake it.  After spending an hour waiting for two entrees after two appetizers that came out wrong and disgusting we just wanted to leave.  It was not busy and there was no wait.  My daughter literally walked out of the place!  Everyone blambing each other for everything....  had the female manager that resolved the situation been the first one we talked to, I would have never left this comment. I had been here last year and everything was great.  He even tried to charge me for Salmon I spit out after leaving me a take-home container on the table.  Because the other manager was so understanding I'm not going to mention anything else here. Seems like a great place for drinks and appetizers while watching a game."
Dewan A.,"Haledon, NJ",653,1272,1504,4.0,8/25/2014,"For a chain restaurant, this place is good.  1) I love their deals. Like the 2 for $20.  2) The food is good, I love the appetizers.  3) The ambiance is good, but this location is always busy."
Charles B.,"Haledon, NJ",0,2,1,5.0,2/20/2016,Stopped for cocktails and  appetizers with my wife on our way to a wedding and got great food and amazing service and witnessed the bartender mixing and serving  every one in a packed restaurant 100 plus patrons with skill and a smile!! The owners of this restaurant need to recognize  Linnea!!!!! She's awesome!¡!!!!
Keith C.,"Nutley, NJ",77,15,7,3.0,12/28/2015,I had a wonderful time there food was good . I just can't believe the blonde manager belittling the employees in front of our table what a great staff under some crappie management I think they really need to reevaluate there management even if she is pregnant I wish I could give her 1 star
Carlos K.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,3,1,1.0,9/20/2015,I was there in Wednesday 09/09 at 10 Pm  The host walk me to my table I wait more than 20 minutes until I waived with my hand to the manager to ask him where is my server ?? I order my food and came wrong after another 20 mins wait I will not go there again very bad service
Brian F.,"Little Falls, NJ",45,25,6,1.0,3/5/2016,"Racism does indeed come in all colors. We arrived at 5pm on Saturday night and there were several people waiting ahead of us. I told them we had a party of 5 and we were told the wait was 15 minutes. I am white, my wife is Asian, the host was African-American and there were three African-American waitresses standing nearby. Just after we came in a party of 7 - all African-American checked in and I heard one tell the other the wait was 25 minutes. Then two more parties came in and put their names on line - one a group of 4 the other a group of 5, both groups were all African-American. That is where it started getting weird. The party of 7 that came in AFTER us were called ahead of the last group that was waiting BEFORE we came in, a group of 7 or 8 Asian women. Those women were called next but then they called the group of 4 African-Americans that had come in after us. I then went and complained about them serving groups that had come in after us while we were still waiting. The host told me they were saving a corner table for us because we had small children and the table was being cleared. Not two minutes later they called the group of 5 African-Americans who had come in after us and led them right to the table he just told me was being saved for us. There were no children in their group. I complained again and he first said his screen wasn't working, gesturing to a screen very plainly working. I then told him screen or no screen he had just told me the table he was now giving away was for us. He told me ""I can't help what other people do"" whatever that means but I then asked for the manager at which point a waitress - African American - stepped in and said ""I'll just take them"". She led us past one empty booth to a second empty booth and finally sat us. I believe word was passed to the kitchen because the food was horrible. Here is a picture of my son's chicken fingers and fries. When you can count the fries - 14 - that is pretty meager. I used to love this place, I can pretty much assure I'll never go there again."
Robert C.,"Cedar Grove, NJ",12,8,,1.0,12/16/2015,"This restaurant is NOT allergy friendly.....ordered nachos with halapenos on the side....they arrive with them on the nachos. Take two.....now they arrive diced up in the cheese. I ask the waiter if it is in the cheese sauce.....""O im sorry....yes""  Take three.....now the manager arrives w new nachos.....guess what?....cheese withehahalapen. Unreal and not acceptable with an allergy customer."
