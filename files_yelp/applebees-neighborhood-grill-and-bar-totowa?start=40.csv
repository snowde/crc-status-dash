Rebecca C.,"Haledon, NJ",140,19,,1.0,10/9/2015,"Went there last night. Was sat by a friendly hostess, then never had a waiter or waitress come by. We sat there for 15 minutes unattended, then left."
Chris L.,"Paterson, NJ",92,998,737,3.0,7/2/2012,"Came here with my friends and his mom to celebrate something.  One of my friends complained about the mozz sticks in our sampler platter being cold, so our waiter got us a whole order freshly made. I was afraid our entrée was compromised because it didn't come out yet.  Our entrees looked and tasted alright.  My friend's mom paid for dinner but I offered to leave the tip. I tipped extra because my friend was a real a-hole on how he milked the system. We had extra mozz stick, so he ripped it into little piece on to his mash potato hoping it would melt and become cheesy potatoes. And our waiter did go above and beyond."
Daniela G.,"Little Falls, NJ",4,15,3,1.0,4/25/2015,This place sucks.  Save your money and go somewhere else.  Food is awful. Service is awful.  We will never come back to this location.
Skip H.,"Wayne, NJ",54,483,,2.0,2/28/2015,Their food is ordinary and bland.  I was very disappointed with their boneless ribs.
Haley K.,"Whitehouse Station, NJ",0,5,2,1.0,4/9/2015,"Me and my boyfriend went there on Tuesday for half priced apps. Two times we asked for details on the food we were ordering and both times we were misinformed and let down. I got a beer and it had floating food in it, when I got a new one she said ""fixed it""!! I didn't want it fixed I wanted a new one. So that was disgusting to think about. When we were miss informed about a flavor sauce for the buffalo wings. She noticed and stated we didn't like them but didn't do anything about it. Also my boyfriend asked for a glass of water, so she only brought one. Lastly we got a shot of something for dessert, and for a milk based drink it was uncomfortabley warm. Overall a disappointment, and waste of money. The quality was poor !!!!"
Chai D.,"New York, NY",0,5,,1.0,3/25/2015,"I was just there last night with my family. We sat for 15 minutes and never have a server to ask our order while in the other table just came 5 minutes after us and in 2 minutes, they got served right away. Too late but we walked out and went to Olive Garden instead. Glad we didnt eat there, service at Olive Garden is always excellent. Its not my first time in Applebees totowa, but i hope they pay attention to their service for their patrons. Hope to not experience it again when i go back there."
Tatí C.,"Haledon, NJ",33,39,14,2.0,5/9/2015,The food and drinks are getting crappy. Another place I won't be dinning at anymore. Sorry NOT sorry!
Dan E.,"Montclair, NJ",1,15,1,1.0,2/15/2015,"How many blasted TVs can you shoe-horn into one floor of a restaurant? 17? 18? that's 18 too many. And the local craft beer they serve, touted on the menu, is Blue Moon? Garbage. Just garbage. Like the rest of the dining experience."
Celia P.,"Elizabeth, NJ",38,55,13,1.0,1/17/2015,"The only reason they got one star is because I cannot give them less.  The greeter was nice but after that it was all down hill.  We told the waitress that we were pressed for time because we were on an hour lunch break and she said she understood.  We ordered a burger and a grilled chicken wrap that came with a soup.  We waited 10 minutes for drinks and the she disappeared and only returned 25 minutes later with our food but the soup was missing.  She said ""sorry I owe you a soup, it's gonna be another 45 seconds in the microwave:.  ARE THEY SERIOUS???  She was not apologetic and never smiled once.  NEVER AGAIN!!"
Frances R.,"Paterson, NJ",0,9,3,1.0,3/22/2016,Horrible! This place is so unprofessional and the service was bad! I went with my husband and two kids and kids couldn't even eat their kid steak! My husband and eight year old got food poison immediately after when they the shrimp appetizers! Please be cautious!
Jadwiga P.,"Garfield, NJ",6,2,,1.0,1/13/2015,"We were  there for about an hour and a half. The food was great but the service was a huge disappointment. The waitress was really slow with bringing our bill, asked us maybe twice how was everything and if we needed anything,  plus she had no smile on her face. Would we go there again? Absolutely not but we are sure that $5 tip was enough for her to see that this Applebee's location has lost a customer."
Ashley C.,"Little Falls, NJ",0,4,,1.0,4/3/2016,"Called ahead to save a seat for a big party. Got to the location and waited over an hour when we were told we were next. They sat tons of large parties before us. When we questioned what was going on, the man at the host stand said, ""bruh, we are waiting for those people over there to finish, we didn't know they'd order more drinks and dessert."" After the blantant disregard for our wait time and trying to keep us as customers, we left. They didn't even bat an eyelash. Worst service ever. I'll never go back."
Dania D.,"Belleville, NJ",312,299,350,2.0,10/28/2014,It's Applebee's. It is what it is. This particular Applebee's can get pretty busy and crowded. My family and I only eat here after picking up baby necessities from BRU next door and are starving. The food is obviously very eh; nothing exciting here. But it's very reasonably priced (always a great deal going on) and family friendly so I don't have to worry about getting weird looks when I walk in with my two young kids.
Danny B.,"Totowa, NJ",4,48,2,5.0,1/29/2015,My bud Derek and I have been watching Rangers games here for years. GO RNGERS and go APBeez!!!
Tiara T.,"Paterson, NJ",53,29,16,2.0,7/29/2014,"You're typical Applebee's... Service was fairly friendly. Food and drinks were quick to come. Not a fan of whatever batter it is they use to fry their fish. The fish itself was good, but the batter was too crisp to the point were it fell off. Boyfriend went to use the restroom and had to walk out because it was so unsanitary. Get that taken care of people!"
Yesenia R.,"Newark, NJ",13,185,137,1.0,5/19/2014,"Order the lunch special a couple of weeks ago, and when I went to eat my salad there was dirt on my lettuce. called to complain and they told me that everything comes pre-washed. Will never eat here again."
Jim B.,"Somerset, NJ",326,1449,171,3.0,3/5/2011,"I am not a fan of chain restaurants but this place is pretty good.  Stopped by with two coworkers - primarily because of proximity; just a short drive from the office we were visiting.   Several cheap lunch deals at $6.99 to $7.99.  Food was OK; service was good; plus  beverage  refills are free.So for just a little more than McDonnell's you get table service and some good menu choices.  The place was almost full with business people and families.  Happy Hour is 3 PM to 5 PM, with beers starting at $3.00."
Dexter V.,"Bloomfield, NJ",697,440,3153,1.0,1/21/2012,"This review is based on a recent visit and first impression. Even though the restaurant is nearby, I have never eaten there. This particular visit was my first and will be my last. The restaurant was dirty, the waiter was nowhere to be found, and most importantly the food was salty! The waiter came to take our orders and dropped-off the check at the end. In between he was nowhere to be found. My party of six and I asked other waiters for assistance. Some food was salty, some sour, and some bland according to others in my group. For my part all of the appetizers that I ordered were salty; almost to the point of being inedible. To top this awesome experience off my group was seated at the smallest table possible and when we asked if we could sit somewhere else the hostess said we would have to wait longer because they were busy. Truly a ""neighborhood grill""!"
Mandy R.,"Haledon, NJ",2,5,,5.0,8/14/2013,Their Blue cheese is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am obsessed with their steak quesadilla towers! A lot of nice young people work here so the waiters are very energetic which is always a plus!!!!
Ellie L.,"Paterson, NJ",0,2,,1.0,1/10/2014,"On Monday, Dec 30 2013 I went to this establishment with my friend. On arriving back at home I realized that I'd left behind a large, brown floppy hat at the restaurant. I called to make sure they found it and they informed me that they did. I informed them that I'd be picking it up the next day and they assured me that they'd keep it safe. The holiday were busy for me so today, Friday January 10 2013, I decided to call before going to pick it up. The manager said he'd check lost and found, which he did. He came back to the phone and informed me that it wasn't there. *LE GASP* Where could my hat be? Why isn't it there? I still haven't been given an explanation as to where my hat walked to.. PATHETIC. My Grilled Chicken Wonton Tacos were also pretty salty. YUCK."
