James C.,"Roxbury Township, NJ",2,26,1,4.0,3/23/2014,Table wasn't clean.  It was a bit crowded but it is prime dinner time. The two for $20 is a good deal.  The served was attentive and quick.  The fajita roll was good but was cut with knife that had tomato sauce on it and there is no tomato sauce on the fajita roll.  The manager did stop by to see how everything was. Very nice and attentive to his customers. With the exception of the table cleanliness and the tomato sauce residue issue everything else was good. Minus 1 star only.
Luca T.,"Maplewood, NJ",6,273,,2.0,11/18/2012,"This is the worst Applebee I have tried. Service, environment, food... all terrible!"
Darren R.,"Morris Plains, NJ",18,196,,1.0,10/25/2009,"I think all applebees suck, and I don't know how I've forgotten that and tried again."
Sasha M.,"Cedar Grove, NJ",12,157,,4.0,4/30/2009,It is your typical Applebee's although this one has a strange parking lot because it is shared with a strip mall.  I will say this for Applebee's they are stepping it up these days with their 2 for 20 meals.  They now offer 2 meals and an app all for $20.  They are not chef's it is a chain but the food is tasty and if you choose the mozz sticks you will get very large sticks and I think last time it was 8 they served.  For those that love these things like me that is a big deal.  I have had them in many places and you usually get 4 for like 5 bucks.  Don't bother with the desert shooters though they are waste of few bucks.  Too small and too sweet.
