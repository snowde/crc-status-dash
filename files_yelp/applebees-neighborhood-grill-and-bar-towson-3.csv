Annette B.,"Baltimore, MD",0,39,,5.0,11/17/2017,"The service here for Veterans Day is always good.  Although there were MANY people here, I was seated and served quickly.  The waiter was extremely kind and accommodating.  She provided great service and the chicken pasta was hot and very good.  Recommend this restaurant if you want a quick, cheap meal and good service."
Kendra R.,"Randallstown, MD",140,116,133,3.0,10/8/2017,"Applebee's has always been average to me, but they're currently doing a dollar for margaritas this month... And I'm so excited about it. I do appreciate the price points of the appetizers and the 2 for 20 menu. It's always a plus when you can go out and have fun for Less!"
Kimberly J.,"Baltimore, MD",122,222,296,2.0,10/29/2017,"I've had a on and off thing for Applebee's but this location as far as food is concerned is trash. I'm all for 2 for $20, Happy Hour, and October Dollaritas, but when does the food here get better. I've had cold food, burnt food, overspiced food, even undercooked food here. I'm done. As great as the servers are here, the cooks are terrible."
Ebony M.,"Baltimore, MD",7,7,1,1.0,12/3/2017,"Me and my husband stopped here on a Sunday, i actually suggested White Marsh but since we were here we stopped. My table was not clean. My medium well steak ended up being medium rare, my mashed potatoes was cold inside, my husband chicken and shrimp was dry with the butter sauce threw to the side instead of on the chicken. Sent my food back and never ordered anything else. Manager never came over at all in regard to the complaint. I will never come to this Applebee's again!"
Christina O.,"Baltimore, MD",220,145,1315,3.0,3/8/2016,"Late dinner  My BFF and I came here to grab dinner. I suggested this place since it was up the street from where I normally come to get my eyebrows threaded (which was much needed!). The bar was pretty full but we manage to find a seat. We both ordered a house salad with ranch dressing and the pepper sirloin steak (medium) with grains. The house salad was good however; I forgot to asked without cucumbers (ewwww). The pepper steak was pretty good, it's on the healthier menu and supposedly 300+ calories; the steak was pretty small. We didn't finished our grains, it wasn't tasteful (something I do not want to relive). We ate the spinach, tomatoes and the mushrooms :). My BFF ordered a sangria which was too sweet she complained. Disclaimer: do not come here expecting to feel buzzed. Particularly at this location their drinks are weak!!. Thank God I wasn't drinking that night because I would have been highly disappointed.  Any who I ordered the (non alcoholic) Shirley temple. That was okay, but something was in my drink so I stopped drinking it -_- My experience was mediocre; the bartender was very nice and pleasant. The inside was pretty clean for the most part. If you come on Wednesday's they have karaoke night.  After 9pm apps are half off and they have drink specials range from $4-6"
Anthony C.,"Abbott, TX",0,18,3,2.0,8/6/2017,"We decided to stop at Applebee's for their happy hour from 3p-6p as advertised on their sign. We come to find out, it is not on Sundays, but decided to stay any way for their mediocre $5 three olive deal, to also find out they ""have been out of it for a while"". Disappointed, although stepping into an Applebee's, expectations should not have been set so high. An additional star was for the staff, as they were friendly."
Christina A.,"Rosedale, MD",18,9,1,1.0,6/23/2017,Let's see when you first walk in and have to wait for a table usually the hostess takes your name and asks how many are in your party. When we walked in there was a bit of a wait. The hostess had some kind of head scarf on. When we asked for a table for four she said ok 20 minutes. She didn't ask for a name. When some tables became available the hostess goes oh which one of you all was first?  Umm excuse me?  Shouldn't you have known that because you should have taken names?  Come to find out the ladies that jumped up and said they were first were actually behind another group. Sorry this place needs better management and a better hostess.
June L.,"Wilson Park, Baltimore, MD",1,1,,1.0,8/15/2017,I when to Applebee's today; the server didn't have good manners at all. She didn't tell me her name and the host didn't tell me her name. The server was acting like she didn't want to serve me at all. Lastly the manager was not any better I think she's trying to act young to get along with her staff or to fit in with them. Adults act your age and not your shoes sizes
Alicia W.,"Aberdeen, MD",11,1,,1.0,7/13/2017,Went to Applebee's @ 3:00 on a Wednesday I know that appetizers are half off from 3-6 but didn't no u had to seat at the bar to get the half off price so I place my order at the dining area and to my surprise my bill was sky high I was never told and didn't see anything that stated that u had to sit at the bar REALLY what difference does it make where u sit.
Nakia C.,"Windsor Mill, Milford Mill, MD",87,13,14,2.0,6/6/2017,I'm not a big fan of Applebee's  . The food is always the worst .Burgers are never done and the waiters seem to sweat so bad......
Noah S.,"Lutherville-Timonium, MD",0,1,,1.0,9/3/2017,"I had a bery unpleasant experience with my friend eating at Applebee's. They rushed me into ordering and didnt even ask what i wanted for my sides. I also ordered a cheeseburger and told him what i wanted lettuce tomato, and onions on it and got just two slices of cheese on it."
A. C.,"Orlando, FL",135,1162,8681,2.0,2/25/2017,"(2/17/2017)  We had a gift card to use up, so sought out this Applebee's (since the Timonium one closed).  Front of the house is a little bit of a disaster.  We were greeted, asked our name and then number in our party.  We sat with other groups waiting.  They apparently were seating groups by memory and by multiple different people, so someone would call us, then someone else would say ""no no, those people are next"" and send us back to wait again.  This happened twice.  Use a damn list, or don't even ask at all.  Place was packed on a Thursday night, not sure why.  We were seated and orders taken pretty quickly, food took a little while, and was taken to the wrong table.  We could overhear a runner trying to foist our order on an unsuspecting couple adamantly denying that was what they wanted to eat.  We had to get up and hail that person to bring us our food.  The 2 for $20 menu is a great deal, if you like the items offered.  The Boneless Wings were successful, deep-fried and sauced, sticky sweet a little black pepper heat and ranch dressing, not much can go wrong there.  4-Cheese Mac & Cheese was sufficiently creamy and cheesy, fried and sauced chicken tenders also decent, but the two together seemed a little strange.  Double-glazed Baby Back Ribs were meaty, well-sauced, cooked long enough to come off the bone easily.  A build-your-own sampler of French Onion Soup  (cheesy, salty), Sriracha Shrimp (flabby, weak on the heat), and Cheeseburger Egg Rolls (Velveeta with beef) was fine, if uninspiring.  Everything basically lukewarm to cold when it came to the table.  A side of ""Fire Grilled"" Vegetables were basically fully raw and cold large chunks of zucchini and yellow squash, totally inedible.  Now that I think about, that's front of the house, back of the house, and everything in the middle, the place is kind of a shit show.  It's def family friendly (lots of screaming and kicking rugrats) and mostly inoffensive, and plenty of TVs around the bar, so you could probably find the lowest common denominator here to serve your purpose."
Janeice J.,"Baltimore, MD",0,12,1,2.0,1/29/2017,The service was below average. My husband ordered a medium raw steak came out well and the replacement steak came when the rest of us who dined their was almost done. The waitress was told to refill our drinks and didn't attend our table the way she needed too. The reason we even went there was because Glory Days had a long wait. They need to take the reviews seriously.
Tear S.,"Parkville, MD",23,50,136,4.0,12/28/2015,"Compared to previous times, this visit was actually pretty awesome! There wasn't a crowd like usual. I wanted to try something slightly different, but not too off the radar (some of the entree dishes come from the bag), so I tried a sandwich. It was a club with turkey, ham, bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayo. The side Caesar was fresh and delicious. Our waiter J was awesome. He was attentive, polite and accommodating. If all of the nights were like this one, I'll definitely come back. =)"
Cori B.,"Baltimore, MD",114,108,335,3.0,10/19/2015,"Stopped in here on a Friday night, needed somewhere where we could be seated quickly and spend less than an hour before heading out in Towson with some friends. We were taken to a table immediately, and I noticed that they must have redecorated since the last time we visited- the walls and decor are much cleaner/simpler than I remembered. Nice surprise. I ordered my old Applebee's standy- the Chicken Fajita Rollup. Honestly, I like it and know it's decent, and I didn't want to chance a new menu choice that night. Hubby got a burger, which he was pleased with. We ordered, the waitress was pleasant and quick, and the food came out not too long after...  I took a look at my wrap, and something was different. I'm open to changes and improving menus, sure- but my wrap, which is supposed to really just be chicken, cheese, and lettuce, is stuffed with mounds and mounds of cabbage. Interesting choice. I took a bite, figuring ""hey, I'll give this a chance"" ...super weird tasting. The waitress came over and asked how the food was, and I asked her if the wrap was supposed to have lettuce (which, yes indeed, it was). She apologized profusely about what was seemingly a mistake by someone in their kitchen, and I told her it was fine- I didn't want to wait for a new wrap, and this was edible, just different. The manager appeared, likely sensing the waitress's apologetic tone, and abruptly informed me that ""That's how it is supposed to be. We use a lettuce/cabbage mixture now."" (odd, since the menu does not list cabbage AT ALL, and WHO DOES THAT?) So I chalked it up to a misunderstanding, and we finished up our meals. Just a super weird experience overall this visit, I'd determined that I'll just never order that menu item again if that's the case. We asked for our check, and when my husband put his credit card in the little check booklet, our waitress returned saying ""oh, you want ME to run this?"" Apparently, you can pay via the little computerized game machine on your table, and I guess that's what most people do... Only we've never done that, so we didn't know. When she returned to give us the final receipt, I apologized for missing this new little step, and she kindly waved it off like ""oh it's not a big deal"" even though it seemed it was."
Skylar B.,"Ocean City, MD",0,2,,1.0,8/15/2017,"Went to this location tonight and it was by far the worst experience that I have ever had at any restaurant. The bartender was rude and took 10 minutes to take our order and on top of that it took another 15 minutes for 3 drinks. It wasn't even busy. Every time we tried to order food she rolled her eyes at us. We ordered pretzels with cheese dip, buffalo bites, and chicken tenders and fries. It took 45 minutes for all of it when we only ordered appetizers. When the chicken tenders and fries came out, they were cold. We didn't say anything because the bartender made us uncomfortable from the start. She was arguing with all of the servers the whole time and complaining. You could hear her yelling the whole time. The manager even even came to help but she was yelling him too and he left to help the other servers. Overall, we will not return and I will let all of my friends and family know about this experience"
Jonny P.,"Cockeysville, MD",45,215,158,1.0,10/3/2015,"Never again.   Bad service to begin with.  Our server was inattentive and was more concerned with what, we had no idea.  Took way to long to take our order.   After 15 minutes a group of 50+ high school kids came in and began getting loud, disruptive and unruly.   Yelling and screaming began and they started throwing gang signs taking group selfies.  DANGER, you'll be taking your own life in your hands in my opinion.  The staff had no control over these kids.   We asked our server where our food was, she shrugged her shoulders and we walked out.   I don't eat anywhere I cannot feel safe.  Neighborhood bar?  Not tonight, lack of a manager with a backbone it turned into the hood."
Carlyn M.,"Baltimore, MD",70,76,16,4.0,4/7/2016,"I came here for lunch with some coworkers. The service really fast and surprisingly it was not that busy. Our waitress was very attentive, fast and really nice. I think I ordered the boneless wings and fries (nothing special) but it was still good. Lol."
Kevin M.,"Baltimore, MD",163,288,68,3.0,6/26/2015,"So my friend and I got off of work pretty early on Tuesday night and decided to go to Applebee's for a snack and some cocktails.  Upon arriving it was very loud! Apparently it was karaoke night at Applebee's. I thought this was so strange, I could not for the life of me figure out why a  restaurant would be hosting a karaoke night, in my opinion that's typically a bar thing but what ever I went with it. After the first drink it became entertaining. Although it was ungodly loud they could have turned it down a little bit and it would have been much more enjoyable.  As for the food, it was nothing special I split some mozzarella sticks and boneless wings with my friend. The wings were very dry and overly vinegary. We choose not to finish them the only way you could eat them is if they were drenched in blue cheese! Sadly I am not about all of those calories! The mozzarella sticks were different and not tasty to me. They had some strange herb I couldn't pin point throughout the batter.  My drinks, now that's a whole story in itself. I bartender bAck in the day and I know how to make a drink..that's my disclosure lol. I ordered the agave margarita, first of all the bartenders use jiggers to measure their pour which I find incredibly tacky! No one wants to watch a bartender measure their liquor that is put in their drink. It looks very cheap and tasteless.  The drink my friend ordered was a Long Island, the bartender suggested to add strawberry flavoring so she did! Now mind you a Long Island has vodka, gin, tequila, rum, triple sec, Sour mix and coke. Under any circumstance you should undoubtedly be able to taste alcohol in a Long Island. My friend offered me a sip of her drink so I graciously tasted it. I swear it tasted like fruit juice it was obnoxiously sweet and If I didn't know it was an alcoholic beverage I would have thought it was juice.... Needless to say we did not have anymore hand poured drinks. I switched to beer and wrapped up the evening.  I would come back here as a last resort late night spot. Defiantly not on my list of fine dining establishments."
Andrew K.,"Reisterstown, MD",0,1,,1.0,7/5/2017,"I have never felt the need to write a review of a restaurant before, but I wouldn't want anyone to have to sit through the ""meal"" we just did. We had to physically approach the host, who wasn't even wearing a uniform so we weren't even really sure if we were talking to the right person. He took us to our table where he literally threw down the menus and started to walk away without a word. We said thank you, and almost as an afterthought he turned around and said ""your server will be right over"". We order our app and things seemed to be ok, but when it came out the server didn't offer to refill two of the empty cups we had. A few minutes go by and as he walks past, he looks back and asks if we were alright and we had to ask for the refills and for him to take our orders. While we waited the 15+ minutes for chicken tenders and two burgers (which we weren't asked how we wanted cooked), we watched the two bartenders make a homemade lemonade, which they repeatedly taste tested and then passed out to the entire staff. At this point there were three other tables and four guests at the bar. None of which were checked on for the duration of the makeshift lemonade stand. While we continued to wait for the food, we watched three of the staff members sit down and eat, and we were still not checked on for more refills. Our food finally arrives, after two check ups we have to, again, ask for drinks. Then we were waiting to get to go boxes, which the bus boy had to offer us because we could see our waiter outside on FaceTime with his lemonade, the bus boy proceeded to stand at our table and wait for us to box up our food so we could physically hand him our dirty plates. Everyone always says this, but I am a fellow server/bartender, and this is not acceptable. The slow times always lead to laziness and stupid mistakes, and this was no exception. The entirety of the staff were all standing at the bar, eating, or on their phones almost the whole time we were there, unless the manager happened to walk by. But even when she did, they weren't reprimanded or even addressed. The hostess was the most hard working and at one point, was cleaning the tables, moving them for larger parties, and seating the back of up people at the door while the aforementioned un-uniformed ""host"" was in the corner eating. I hope the management and staff take this criticism to heart and realize that when there's only 15 people in the restaurant and the whole staff is standing in one place casually enjoying a fresh made lemonade while their paying guests have no drinks at all, that people aren't going to make a return visit."
MaryAnn S.,"Baltimore, MD",1,12,,1.0,6/5/2016,"We ordered the wood fired 6oz. sirloin, garlicky green beans and cheesy bacon baked potatoes, this past Fri. 6/3.  After enjoying same a few weeks ago, we looked forward with crossed finger knowing Applebee's reputation for consistency.  The second time around we were not only disappointed, but annoyed.  On the 1st try the steaks were served sizzling on a very hot plate placed on a wooden holder.  6/3 it was served on a white dinner plate barely warm.  Sending them back to be reheated was little to no help. The steak being the star was a big flop. I like the green beans - a little warm, but OK. The potatoes were flooded with sour cream."
Jessica N.,"Towson, MD",61,17,,2.0,2/27/2015,"I've never been very impressed with Applebee's food, but we had a gift card to use up & decided to get curbside-to-go.  My husband's steak was decent though the portion was very small. The mashed potatoes served with the steak were horrible though. They definitely tasted like instant potatoes and were just gross (even our 3 yr old wouldn't eat them!).  However my chicken fiesta chopped salad really surprised me - in a good way! The veggies were crisp & fresh, the chimchurri marinated chicken was grilled nicely & very tasty though definitely had a kick! The jalapeño dressing was a nice mix of spicy & sweet and was perfect for this salad.  Though we probably won't go to Applebee's unless we have another gift card, when we do I would definitely get that salad again!"
Kim N.,"Baltimore, MD",9,52,,2.0,12/10/2014,"Can I say....YIKES!  Holy crap, get your act together over there people!!  The place was EMPTY...ghostville...maybe 3 tables had people sitting at it.  Well....4 tables, including us, but we didn't stay long.  Let me explain: We stopped in this evening instead of going to the Greene Turtle in White Marsh....which was our first mistake.  Our second mistake was actually walking in the door.  My husband has protested in the past about Applebee's, but I asked him to go tonight and he did.  I won't ask again.   **The word wait and/or forms of the word 'wait' will be used numerous times within this review.  You'll grow tired of reading the word wait.  Much like we grew tired experiencing the definition of the word....wait.  So my apologies to all who read this tidbit of info. We walked in and the hostess...was awesome.  Lovely lady and without hesitation, she sat us.  Very cheerful, very sweet.  The first thing we noticed it that the place was empty and that the bartender...and I'm assuming the manager (only because he was in a dress shirt and a tie and was behind the bar), chatting away...the bartender obnoxiously so.   We looked around, waiting to be greeted by one of the wait staff and....crickets.   So, I looked at the interactive menu...which is now completely clear as to why there is one at the table.  It was confusing at first.   We waited again.  Nothing.  And then I noticed, a small group of waitstaff, off to the right of the bar, carrying their own interesting conversations.  I say interesting, because something was keeping their attention for the first 15 minutes we waited.  We sat for a few more minutes.  Waiting.  Still playing around with the interactive menu.  While the waitstaff, bartender and ""manager"" enjoyed each other's company.   Just to give you an idea of the wait time, I actually made a mental note of writing the manager about how gross the carpet was and simply sweeping it won't change the appearance of the scent.  I also memorized the appetizer list while looking at the gameboy menu on the table....I've mentioned that a couple of time...the menu, but why do you need to place your own order when you have waitstaff?  OHHHH, that's right, we're at Applebee's and waitstaff have other things to do...like talk about Jim Bob's girlfriend's Uncle's buck he shot on Monday.   Eventually, I looked at my husband and said ""do we seriously want to wait any longer?  If the service is this slow before we even ordered, who knows what we'll receive after we've ordered?!""  We got up, walked to the door and not one person noticed we were leaving.  Well, other than the hostess.  She was upset about our not being waited upon.   We ended up going somewhere else and it was very good.   PS  there may be spelling issues or other grammatical errors in this review....I don't care.  It's for a crappy Applebee's and won't go down in history as the best review ever written.  I'm pretty sure of that. PPS  the one star is for the hostess.  She actually deserves 5 stars.  A nice lady.  A hard worker."
Brian R.,"Baltimore, MD",924,177,181,5.0,9/19/2013,"This place has great management and service! My favorite Applebee's to go to. Trust me, the negative reviews are inaccurate. The hostess, server, manager, all takes care of me every time I randomly come here. I would highly recommend coming here for good food at a good price!"
Latosha G.,"Nottingham, MD",45,106,154,4.0,1/16/2015,"I haven't been to Applebee's in years, however my friend wanted to go so we went. We got there at 7pm, and  the place was packed with people everywhere. I didn't even know people went to Applebee's like that. I mean, when I think of places to go eat, let's just say that Applebee's is not on the top of my list. We only waited about 5 minutes before we were seated which was nice not having to wait long. We looked over the menu several times and still couldn't decide what we wanted to eat. Our Server, Ebony, was nice and gave us extra time. Ebony had recommended having a drink, she mentioned that the Long Island Ice Tea was half off. Shoot, you can't beat half off, so I told her to put me down for one. The bartender was definitely not skipping on the alcohol, my drink was strong but that's how I like them. The Long Island Ice Tea was good, although I wish they didn't fill the cup up to the rim with Ice, my drink didn't last long. I ordered the New Pepper-Crusted Sirloin & Whole Grain. Oh My Goodness, this meal was so tasty! The Sirloin was juicy, tender, seasoned well, and had just the right amount of pink in the middle. The Sirloin is served on a bed of Whole Grain rice with Grape Tomatoes and Spinach in a light Mushroom sauce. Whats even better is that this meal is only 350 calories!!! I know your probably thinking, how in the world is a meal 350 calories at a restaurant?"" To be honest, I don't know,Lol. But I do know, that the meal portion is small and they serve it on a large plate which makes it look even smaller. But to be honest, I was full after eating the small portion. I would just advise you to not go in super hungry and expecting this meal to fill you up."
Taylor C.,"Towson, MD",196,1,,1.0,4/17/2016,"Worst experience I've ever had at an Applebee's. Upon walking in, we were not greeted and the hostess was no where to be found. Once seated, we were not looked at or spoken to for at least 7 minutes.  Service was awful the entire meal. Appetizer plates were never clear and drinks were never refilled. One member of our party ordered a cheese burger quesadilla without pico, they brought it out with pico and when they fixed it the fixed result was still not correct.  The WORST part that I am completely appalled at and I feel should immediately be addressed by a manager; the bartender was dusting the entire bar and all of the lights. It was DISGUSTING, people's beers were under where she was dusting. She was dusting right out front of the kitchen door so all of the food being brought out was getting dust in it.  By far the worst and most unprofessional service I've had in a while. Disappointed in Applebee's."
Jill B.,"Baltimore, MD",246,146,289,4.0,7/31/2013,"I can't believe I'm writing a four star review for Applebee's. I have long called this chain ""The most depressing place on earth,"" but tonight I was proven wrong. There were three of us, so the other two folks got the 2 for $20 with a huge Oriental chicken salad, grilled and Bourbon Street chicken and shrimp. Our waiter-suggested appetizer was the buffalo boneless chicken wings, which were surprisingly delicious. I ordered the quesadilla burger which our waiter aptly described as ""a laZy taco."" It was delicious and after 1/3rd of the buffalo wings and 1/2 burger I was stuffed.  In total it was under $45 for three people, my friend could watch sports while my other friend and I gabbed.  Thanks for the corrective experience!"
Qionah B.,"Owings Mills, MD",30,44,67,5.0,9/13/2014,I came in and took a seat at the bar. Surprisingly it wasn't crowded. I looked over the menus and decided on the crosscut ribs. I chose chipotle BBQ because I was headed to chipotle first but decided on this place for a drink. The food came out promptly as my order was put in accurately by Angela the charismatic bartender. I ate and listened to the regulars make themselves known lol. It's cool tho all fun. I have to say I enjoyed the atmosphere but the ribs were just their regular ribblets with choices of sauces. I'm hip to marketing so I'm not mad. I was offered dessert as I handed over my check but I decided on another drink. So I will say I had a pleasurable experience. I grew up around here so this is my millionth trip. However it's always good to be treated like a neighbor! #winning Great job Angela!!!! You never know who's yelping!!! The fireball whiskey lemonade was on time
Benjamin F.,"Baltimore, MD",9,41,11,3.0,8/4/2015,"It's only worth going here for the half-priced appetizers after 9pm.  It's a good deal on the wings ($5 for boneless).  They are served hot, and the sauces are all really good.  The spinach and artichoke dip is decent as well.  The nachos are pretty terrible, though.  The apple chimi cheesecake is the best dessert.  Service is hit-or-miss."
Dave H.,"Baltimore, MD",1,14,,1.0,1/27/2016,This place stinks... Barely acknowledged by our server and drinks never delivered after 20 minutes so we just got up and left. This is like the second or third time I've had bad service. Another one with problems closed in lutherville not too long ago. I doubt I'll ever be back.
Sherice H.,"Henderson, NC",260,64,186,3.0,7/8/2015,"We were seated, and our orders came quickly . The ribs as an appetizer is a bust.  More bone than meat so i sent them back.  It was karaoke night, so the music was interesting  to say the least."
Hiz W.,"Baltimore, MD",0,4,1,1.0,3/30/2014,Poor customer service. The plate was dirty. I asked waitress for another plate. She goes and wipes of one we had. I requested a manager. He said it wasn't  dirty it was water stains for not bring dried. Then the glass wAs cracked. I asked for another glass so I wouldn't swallow glass fragments. The waitress went to the bar and poured my soda from chipped glass to another. When she came back I asked her does that make sense. She was clueless   I said ma'am How do u no there was no small glass fragments poured into new glass. She got mad rolled her eyes then went and got a fresh soda. They are the worse.  They the good was cold.  I reported this entire incident to there corporate office and never heard a thing !!!!
S L.,"Bellefonte, PA",58,14,,3.0,8/3/2015,"We like to come here for the late night specials, which is half off appetizers and discounts on drinks ($2.50 drafts & $4 Long Island Iced Teas). The food and service are pretty good at night, and it's a good relaxing hangout spot because it's fairly quiet."
Raven T.,"Baltimore, MD",215,205,789,3.0,3/7/2014,"I come here all the time for late night happy hour. The food is consistent and there's a  dj and karaoke on Wednesday. The service is always great and the staff is super friendly. With all the fantastic, unique restaurants here in Baltimore I wouldn't come here for dinner, but you really can't beat the happy hour. One of the best Applebee's I've been to!"
Smarie B.,"Baltimore, MD",2,39,29,2.0,3/16/2015,"I have only been to Applebee's one other time, and based on their menu options, I wasn't expecting much. We ordered mozzarella sticks for our appetizer, and honestly, I've had better from the grocery store frozen foods section. Also, who serves marinara in a plastic ramekin? Our first drink order, Whiskey fire ball lemonade was so bad, we had to send it back. There were no efforts at plate presentation with our entrees. A twelve year old could have done better; literally slop on a plate. I'm not sure how this place is in business. Their prices are pretty much on par with Friday's, but there is no comparison in the value you receive for the money. Our server was pretty good, no complaints there. Lastly, we were also sat right next to a loud and obnoxious party, and that may have been the icing on the cake."
Amy S.,"Pikesville, MD",7,88,73,2.0,7/22/2013,"I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants and you kind of already know what you're going to get. We ended up here because someone in my party had a gift card he was trying to use. Our server, Cedrick, was so very nice and helpful. But the overall dining experience was lackluster. Applesbees has rolled out a new menu that has a pick two and pick three option....it's a bit confusing in the menu because there are several salads they are offering as entrees....but the menu makes it look like you get a salad + 2-3 other things (which is not the case). Once Cedrick very nicely explained it all (even he admitted all the servers found it confusing)...I was able to get my order placed. My dinner came a full 10 minutes after my other two dining companions and the food was just mediocre (I had a shrimp dish over fettucini + wedge salad from the pick two menu).... They do have a new way you can check out on computer type machines at the table...interesting but perhaps just as easy to have a waiter run your card:-)  Overall just an average experience...."
Gabrielle C.,"Baltimore, MD",10,77,100,4.0,11/15/2013,My visit was actually great. Food cooked perfect and waiter was polite.  The chef made a substitution for the sauce for a meal which turned out great.
Jim H.,"Baltimore, MD",9,144,1,1.0,9/2/2010,"Why does everything at Applebee's taste like hotdogs? Why do wait staff there consistently refer to one male and one female in a dining party as ""guys""? Admittedly, reviewing chain restaurants is pretty lame.  We all know they are generally going to be mediocre, but this particular one is sub-par.  Not only does it seem to attract large, noisy ghetto families,  but the kitchen can't grill a steak to save their lives.  Of the two times I've been there, my steak came out charred. I asked for medium rare.  The manager was summoned to the table and she put on her ""concerned face"" and both times pulled out a little chochtkee card that is ""good for one complimentary appetizer"" for your next meal. That's lamer than reviewing a chain restaurant! News flash, baby;  THERE WILL BE NO NEXT MEAL!"
Devonna B.,"Baltimore, MD",208,225,35,2.0,5/29/2012,"Yay! I'm an Elite now!!! Thank you Yelp!  So i tried so hard to make my first review as an Elite a 5 star one but there was no way around this one!  Hubby and I went out for his b-day to Applebees (I know...just saying it sounds all kinds of questionable). It happened to bee Karaoke night so I figured we were in for some fun. This was our first full night out as my in laws agreed to keep all three kids (10 month old included)!  It was nice to be celebrating cough cough and still get carded! Score 1. Let me prepare you, as this review is a mix of good, bad, and ugly. Our waitress was decent and pretty fun actually. had all the birthday crowds and did fairly well. So let me put it right out there....after all the work I put in to get the kids watched I did not expect at all to be drinking and carrying on with toddlers, infants and middle schoolers. Yes at 10:00 some lady brought her pre teens to Applebees for a birthday party with a toddler and infant in tow. :( I'm not even going to talk about the 13 year old child wearing a t-shirt for a dress.. Oh my.  Ok, focus on the service. So when you order a burger from this place your only choices are pink or no pink. ???? Um maam I want medium well. She literally said there is no such think back in the kitchen. My huband was so perturbed. I mean does the cook just not know burger basics? Hmmm. My burger, the blackend blue cheese burger was heavy on the blue cheese making it a bit...uhhh. Once I scraped off some of the cheese, it was a decent burger. :) Then let me tell you I have been waiting for my first karaoke experience all my life. I was so hype about this karaoke thing. What a let down. No judgement, but I never imagined listening to someone do Nelly on a karaoke machine. People were really rapping!? It was just the furthest thing from my mind. Then you just couldn't hear folks. Mics were turned down a bit to low to enjoy people. Instead of people just up there having crazy fun, it looked like a booking fest. One guy kept singing slow jamz really hoping to get someone's number. (I mean he worked really hard. Thank God one girl gave him the number at the end of the night). Like I said just not what I was expecting. What was I expecting one may ask....well what I seen on TV for the past 26 years! lol. Finally, and probably the most important reason why you don't want to go to the place and the reason why i am going all caps from here on out:  THE ALCOHOL IS NON EXISTENT. I AM KNOWN WORLD WIDE FOR BEING A LIGHTWEIGHT. I'M NOT A VOMIT LIGHTWEIGHT BUT CERTAINLY A ONE DRINK FUN FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT LIGHTWEIGHT. I HAD A HUGE SANGRIA AND 1 1/2 SHOTS OF VODKA...................................................NOTHING. MY HUSBAND COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. THE DRINKS DID NOT TASTE WATERED DOWN BUT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON.  Look the only reason I didn't go to Red Maple that night was because it was Gypsy night, and I wasn't quite prepared to do a live gypsy band that night.  Applebee's  made me want to RUN to Red Maple. Boooooo."
