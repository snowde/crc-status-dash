Ebony T.,"Baltimore, MD",22,37,2,2.0,7/19/2011,Don't order the peach sangria. It tastes good but they don't really have any wine in it so it is a total ripoff. Try Carabba's for a Â really good Blackberry sangria!
Chelsea H.,"Baltimore, MD",2,32,6,2.0,12/20/2011,"Applebees isn't that awesome. Its just not. I went because it was late at night and didn't want to go home and cook. I ordered a hot cocoa even though it wasn't on the menu, so I was impressed that they were going to make some anyway. Then they brought it out and i had to mix it myself. I did not know what to think because on one hand they don't offer it, but then i have to mix it myself. I thought they could have at least mixed it. The waiter seemed kinda distant but still pleasant so i ignored it. We ordered some buffalo wings but the waiter didn't remember so he brought over wings and boneless wings which isn't terrible but I was thinking, couldn't he have came over and asked? Whatever. The quesadillas were alright. Everything there is just okay. There are worse places, but then again a lot better too. I recommend going at night for appetizers because they are half off. I do enjoy the quesadilla burger but thats it. I won't go again unless I'm dragged there and can eat as many wings as i want to. College kids my age are there a lot, i personally would rather go get something else but to each their own."
