Kevin S.,"Modesto, CA",69,114,159,5.0,9/18/2017,What can I say... we were greeted at the door and seated fast . Our server Sabrina was awesome and cute as my daughter is. She make sure to get the orders right and they came out fast. Even tough my wife fries were kinda cold and she got another fries out fast. And what was great is the mgr came out greet us and he was great. A good restaurant is when the chef or the manager ( Mike)  comes out to see if all is ok. That's is why they got a five star! We will be back it's better that our Applebee's is modesto
Karla D.,"Ceres, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/11/2017,"I usually do not like leaving negative reviews; however, I do hope that my review will help improve the experience of this place. I came here with my family for dinner, place was not busy. Took 30 minutes to get our drinks and over an hour to get our food. The first waitress first came and told us she was going on break and someone else would take over our table, she also mentioned that our food was ready to come out. Well the replacement waiter checked in with us after 15 minutes. I asked to please check on our food and it was finally brought out cold. (Most horrible ribs ever).  Overall it seemed like the place is not organized at all. The employees seem to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off. (More training and efficiency is definitely needed."
Kattie W.,"Tracy, CA",40,3,,1.0,1/7/2018,"Pretty shit place. Takes forever to get your food. ""Something"" always happens when the food takes forever. Pretty sure they forget about people and if the waitresses actually wrote down the order and not just try to remember it, it would probably help. This is probably my 4th time here with all this happening so finally writing a review. Not coming back anymore."
OnlyTheStrong S.,"Stockton, CA",0,56,30,1.0,12/17/2017,"Came to Tracy Applebee's. Order of Bbq chicken bite appetiziers came out with a SPIDER!!!! SMASHED IT and saved it for the Manager Mike in which cared less. Bites were not fresh and my sister and  are concerned as to where the spider came from. Asked for Manager...Mike came but he was careless and hushed us by removing the price of the appetizer??? Duh...of course you are if we didnt eat but half a bite before a spider tried to tell us to run for our lives!!!! Mike says ill make you a dessert. Dessert came home with hot asian chili sauce versus strawberry as Manager Mike assured. Terrible-sad for the company to carry on with the management, cooks, service, and carelessness."
Zell C.,"Merced, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/17/2017,Bad service the food was cold buffalo sauce was dry had no creamer for coffee slow and just nasty
James G.,"Nashville, TN",11,19,4,1.0,10/7/2017,I should know better than eat at Applebee's. The steak was tougher than shoe leather (a cliche I know). The bartender is just an idiot. She is a nice person just too stupid to get a drink or food order correct.
marry c.,"Stockton, CA",2,18,6,1.0,11/22/2017,We ordered burger and fries chicken tortilla soup and sriracha shrimp appetizers. Pretty bland for the most part.. fries were tasty but everything else needed a lot more flavor. I think chili's has better taste and bang for your buck. Customer service was mediocre. Wouldn't go back unless for happy hour.
Simple S.,"Tracy, CA",0,1,,2.0,1/1/2018,Steaks burnt shrimps raw place stinks no silverwear super long wait poor customer service. Bar way to start the new year
Abby S.,"Tracy, CA",128,197,628,1.0,9/8/2016,"Stained booths, sticky tables, black carpet (it didn't start out that way. I could tell by the color in the low traffic areas), filthy grease and food smeared Windows.. Pretty much all surfaces really. I spent the whole visit with two flies flying around my head like a pest halo. The table across from us was bussed but never wiped our entire stay. Appetizers were 50%, however we only found that out after ordering because we were bored and reading table cards. Our server didn't mention it. We were offered lemon, but not sweetener for our iced tea.  The beef in the ""butchers meat and potatoes"" dish was gristle, very little meat. It said sirloin, I say stew meat that needed to be cooked for another two hours. My ""crispy brewhouse chicken"" tasted almost as good as a banquet frozen dinner. The gravy was excessively boozy."
Vee R.,"Tracy, CA",0,11,2,2.0,6/10/2017,"Yuck!!! Did they change their menu? Im already not a fan of applebees but after my husband suggested we go there, i gave in and we went. I truly regret it. The food was very plain. No seasoning at all. I got the grilled chicken combo with shrimp--ill never get it again. My husband got the garlicky green beans with his meal. Where was the garlic? And they were just warm not even hot. I also had the kiwi lemonade, that wasn't too hot either.  Thankfully this will be last time going to applebees. The extra star is for our amazing server!"
Stephanie A.,"Tracy, CA",0,10,,5.0,11/21/2017,I don't get why there is such a low satisfaction rate. My second time here today and let me tell you the hostess and our waiter were great and guess what food was also delicious. Great customer service! Too bad it's not my local Applebee's but I'm staying at a hotel nearby and will probably come back before I go back home.
Ceren K.,"Vancouver, WA",1,7,1,2.0,8/6/2017,"They don't pay attention to order details - I asked for no bacon, the salad cake with bacon. After I stated that I wanted it taken off.. it came back with bacin AGAIN. The waitress was also rude on top off that, didn't even apologize for hearing my order incorrectly. Also very slow service."
Nicole M.,"Tracy, CA",0,4,,3.0,11/29/2017,"Although I feel that the food here is only ""ok"" at best, we visited last night and I was pleasantly surprised by the service we received. The host and hostess at the front were both very friendly and quick to get us seated. Our waitress, Jordan, was fantastic - very attentive and proactive. Our drinks were refilled before we could ask, our food was out quickly, and she consistently checked on us to ensure we had everything we needed. I may not return based on the food quality, but I wanted to make sure that Jordan received a shout out for her amazing customer service!"
Karen P.,"Modesto, CA",133,2,,3.0,12/26/2016,"Day after Christmas, walk in for dinner at about 5:15. For a party of 6 the wait was a half an hour (took about 15). They didn't look too terribly busy. We sat down and waited 10 minutes for our server to come by and ask about drinks. He brought the drinks quickly which was nice, we asked for another minute so others could make sure they knew what they wanted. He had 7 tables and was rushing around we waited another 10 minutes to order. I over heard him say the ""day after Christmas rush"" was unexpected and they were under staffed all around. We finally got our order in, we ordered some appetizers as we figured our actual order would take awhile. We ordered boneless wings and crunchy wings.  THEY HAD NO SAUCE ON THEM, it was as off the took them out of the fryer used an old bowl with a tiny bit of sauce on them and that was it. Anything that could go wrong with the order did.  My son asked for a plain hamburger (no cheese, no nothing). Came smothered in cheese so we sent it back. My baby back ribs were burnt and covered in BBQ sauce to hide it.  The kitchen seemed way too busy (who was cooking back there)? THANKFULLY! Sam (the night manager) came by and I let him know about our food.  Sam comped a few of our meals and threw in desert. Mike our server was equally as great. They did everything in their power to make the situation right. As we walked out I did see Sam (apron and all) working with his team to make sure the packed restaurant had all the help they could get to make sure everyone left happy."
Dick R.,"Manteca, CA",7,24,4,1.0,8/13/2017,"Compared to all the branching in the valley, this place is old and needs cleaning. Big time renovation is needed!"
Mary H.,"Tracy, CA",338,197,868,4.0,6/9/2017,"One of the few places open late in Tracy, till midnight or later they say. We left at 11:25 pm, and it was still full of people. We were hesitant with the negative reviews, but we were greeted and seated warmly by Natalie, then quickly greeted by our server, Samantha or Sam. She was an excellent server the whole time. Another young man named Sam also came and checked on us several times... We ordered off of the half price happy hour menu. Chicken wonton tacos were yummy. They are small, but there were 4 of them. Next we had the green goddess wedge salad, also really good. Once you chop it and toss it, there is a large plate of salad, with blue cheese and pecans. Really tasty. Finally we shared the boneless wings. These are why I only gave 4 stars. They were heavily breaded and really were just like chicken nuggets. I don't think I would order again. We had the sauce on the side, and ordered two sauces: honey bbq and spicy Asian. They charged extra for the additional sauce, but didn't let us know this. It was nominal, but still... All in all, we had great service and good food at half price, Happy Hour pricing. We will be back!"
Tammy A.,"Turlock, CA",8,14,,1.0,8/6/2017,"I'm not sure what happened to this chain but I'm not sure I'll be back. Everyone here seemed to have their heads in the clouds. We ordered appetizers 2 soithwestern salads,a coke and a lemonade. The drinks took forever to get...maybe they had to pick the lemons.our appetizer was delish and afeter a long wait thefinally  southwestern chicken  salads arrived only to be wilted and well meh tasting. I asked if they were supposed to be this way and the waitress couldn't convince me but went on her way....$48.00 later so disappointed."
Eileen N.,"Tracy, CA",0,1,,2.0,11/19/2017,"Service sucked today....a family that came in AFTER us, received their food before us and by the time we got our food they were already done and getting to go boxes.Took like 40 minutes for our food to come out. No one came by to check on us or refill our drinks until I started to make loud comments about us waiting so long. So basically, if you got a lot of time to waste...then this Applebee's is for you"
Steve C.,"Tracy, CA",61,26,21,3.0,7/17/2017,Foods always good. Tell the host to stop chatting it up w the servers in the back POS area and seat me. I ended up grabbing menus and silverware and sat myself and my wife
Ryan C.,"Torrance, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/11/2017,"Can't complain about anything at all. Servers had been nice and orders were prompt for being after 930pm. Mike the manager is great and really friendly. Krystal is also awesome, she is great at her job and keeps the flow never stopping. Food was great no issues at ALL. Be nice and smile and you will get the same service in return!"
Gene B.,"Manteca, CA",15,37,10,1.0,12/15/2016,"This is the second time Applebee's didn't have the item I wanted on their menu. Not good when you can not order something from the menu. How do you run out of an item?  Is everything pre-made and not made/cooked fresh?  Makes me wonder.  To bad, but based on it's current star ratings. I guess things are not going well anyway."
Arlene S.,"Tracy, CA",34,60,23,5.0,3/4/2017,"Came here for Happy hour last night to celebrate a friend's bday. Got seated right away and service was great. Took advantage of the half off appetizer and drinks in the Happy Hour menu. We ordered the Perfect margarita and it was yummy! Satisfied our cravings from the wonton  tacos, spinach dip and nachos. Food was perfectly cooked and it was a good amount of portion for the four of the us. Overall, we had a great experience dining. I will definitely visit again."
Jesse C.,"San Francisco, CA",52,240,434,3.0,12/11/2016,Late nite at Applebee's onna Sunday nite 11:45...juss rolled into town juss before closing for a to go snack and a cold one while I waited...Cleaning crew out bar closing Average nite at Applebee's in Tracy ya diggg
Arvindram R.,"Tracy, CA",105,155,1008,4.0,11/30/2016,"Really don't know what makes them get such low stars, specifically this tracy location is a well-managed place with some nice appetizers, customer service and Bingo's. Though I am a bit disappointed with them removing Chicken wings from happy hour menu and not so happy with their watered-down drinks, still the place is a good spot for a late-night munch and chill."
Diana W.,"Stockton, CA",0,3,,2.0,10/21/2017,The Applebee's in Tracy has good food but the restaurant is getting run down and starting to smell like old food.  Been going there for years at lunch but not going back till remodel.  Smells too bad in there now.  Not kept very clean.
Mike R.,"Tracy, CA",79,8,,2.0,12/4/2016,"I don't like rating restaurants low but this may help them improve.. My wife and I ordered the asian chicken salad...  The lettuce was wilted and the chicken didn't taste fresh... it tasted like it had been sitting for a long period of time maybe under a heat lamp.. However, the service was good. I mentioned this in the survey that I filled out when I paid the bill."
Fredo R.,"Tracy, CA",0,10,,1.0,6/25/2017,"If you're looking for.....dirty dishes, old chips and your waitress talking to other employees while your waiting for your chips and salsa. 2 out of 8 meals delivered at same time. One of the burgers came out raw. Waitress leaves dirty dishes next to your table. Manager comes out and offers free dessert, we order it and wait forever for it. Well congratulationsthis this is the spot for YOU!!"
Nique S.,"Tracy, CA",0,27,6,3.0,6/6/2017,"Came here for lunch, I sat in the bar area, my server was very nice and greeted me right away. I ordered a bloody mary and a shrimp salad. I had to send the Bloody Mary back because is was so spicy I couldn't drink it (and I like spicy bloodys but this was not drinkable)  The second bloody tasted like straight Tabasco sauce, so I sent it back and did not order another. (Too bad, I've had bloody here before and they were always good) My server was very apologetic.  My shrimp salad was very yummy with good flavor. Shrimp cooked perfectly.  Your bartender was on their cellphone a lot which is unsanitary by the way."
Gustavo A.,"San Ramon, CA",0,58,115,3.0,4/23/2017,"Very good presentation and food tastes good. Service was slow, but staff are very nice."
Mishelle L.,"Tracy, CA",156,27,27,2.0,4/26/2017,Service sucks  tonight 20 minutes and no food!! And a matter of fact I ordered on the the table monitor
Clementina-Cristian E.,"Danville, CA",0,7,,2.0,3/14/2017,I didn't appreciate the fries and chicken tenders being cooked in old oil. You can always tell from the taste of it. Big chef no-no. Otherwise the server was very nice and patient.
C A.,"Newark, CA",0,18,38,2.0,2/12/2017,"Came here last night for dinner. Ordered the salsa verde beef nachos, the blazin texan, and the four cheese mac & chicken tenders. The nachos were great and only $5 after 9pm. The drinks were good and the service was good as well. Our food on the other hand was pretty gross. You would expect your $14 meal to be better or at least as good as your $5 appetizer but no, the pulled pork on my burger tasted microwaved and when they brought out my food my fries were completely cold. I asked for a side of ranch but I didn't use it because it tasted sour. My girls mac and cheese with chicken tenders wasn't even edible it was covered in a puddle of grease like it was soup. It showed it in the picture like a baked mac and cheese with pieces of chicken baked into it but it looked like they just threw 3 frozen chicken strips on top of some frozen mac and cheese. Not what you would expect for $14. 2 stars for the good service but the food was nasty"
Alma M.,"Tracy, CA",0,3,2,2.0,3/5/2017,This place went down hill not as good anymore like before only good thing I got was my margarita. Service is ok but food defiantly isn't good anymore.
Sam B.,"Tracy, CA",1,9,,1.0,2/24/2017,"Potatoes burned, chicken tasted weird, and the kids burgers were tiny! We also had undercooked cold shrimp. Over priced for low quality food. We will Never return!!"
Atchu T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/22/2017,Went in for dinner dinner with friends. Our food was delayed. The salmon we ordered was not cooked properly and they forgot to remove the plastic wrap from the burger meat.
Destiny L.,"Tracy, CA",0,9,,2.0,7/7/2017,Horrible experience tonight. Our waitress was a white with platinum blonde hair and don't get me wrong she was nice and attentive but you needed to keep pressing the call server button and she turned kinda rude when my friend never got her lemonade. So my friend went and told her that it's on the bill but they never got it. And the lady slammed the cabinet she was at and rolled her eyes and had an attitude. If I didn't already pay I wouldn't have left at tip. Also the table next to us must have been her friends because she was by their table laughing and talking while her other tables needed plates removed and refills.
Philly A.,"Manteca, CA",83,48,,5.0,12/12/2016,Lauren and the rest of the crew were awesome especially for my wife's bday dinner... to the management you guys are lucky to have this great crew... definitely be back for the next fams dinner outting ... these guys rock!!!
Peter G.,"Modesto, CA",1,258,41,2.0,11/12/2016,"Atmosphere was nice but thats it. Oriental salad is not like it was in a past just oversauced portions is half amount that I remembered. Server kind a knew that we weren't too happy and was too afraid to ask if Our food was OK or not with us. haven't been here for a long time due to poor of quality  of food and smaller portions. I came back and we confirmed it nothing changed. Sad, this used to be one of my favorite places to go have a nice dinner."
John F.,"Flatbush, Brooklyn, NY",162,2,,1.0,6/2/2017,"Walked in to get some dinner.... only me no one else. Was standing around for 5 minutes before some acknowledged me. I was looking around, there was more than 10 tables open. Waited another 10 minutes to get a table, I ended up walking out. Horrible service, managers doesn't even know what he's doing. They're all walking around with there head in their a$$."
Blake L.,"Las Vegas, NV",134,260,11,4.0,4/2/2016,"This is actually a solid Applebee's location. Their entrees are ""meh"", but giving it four stars because of the happy hour appetizers, the service, and their delicious mango iced tea! The won-ton chicken tacos, sriracha shrimp, green bean crispers, and mozzarella sticks are awesome! After 10, it becomes ""The Bee's"" and offers great half-prize appetizers and desserts. They even have game nights on most days of the week! Underrated."
