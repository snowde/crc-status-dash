Margaret B.,"Leander, TX",8,12,,2.0,1/19/2015,"We have been going to Applebee's all over the United States. We have traveled all over the east coast to down south to Arizona, Texas, Washington and California. We have been in many Applebees and always been sasitified. We go there because we know what to expect.  But, lately we have found out that they have changed there portion size.  They have reduced the size of there soup bowl. There bowl is the same size as a cup first of all and then they only fill it HALF way.  I don't usually complain but, it's ashame I really like going to Applebee's. I will no longer be going there. I just don't like some of there new practices.  Maybe they should print how many ounces is in the cup on the menus."
Sam G.,"San Francisco, CA",140,10,17,3.0,8/17/2013,"This is THE late night hang out for this small town. Pretty much everyone knows each other and between the happy hour starting at 9 and the week day games its a good place to meet up with friends.  Service is okay, the staff is always friendly and outgoing. The only downfall is the wait for drinks from the bar can get a little ridiculous in the evening.  Overall whether you want to sit back, laugh and have a few drinks after a long day of work with friends or want to sit down for a good family dinner, Tracy Applebee's is the stop or you."
Destry H.,"Alameda, CA",188,207,998,3.0,10/8/2012,"Whenever my wife suggested Applebee's in the past, I would immediately say no based on a past experiences. So my wife and I had a few hours to spare before taking off for a road trip. o Reluctantly, I agreed to go!  Okay, I will admit, I was pleasantly suprised on my recent visit to Applebee's. Aside from the makeover on the exterior, there must have been a corporate makeover as well? The menu has been updated. This neighborhood Applebee's appears to have had a change in personnel, quality of food, taste and overall customer service. Our server was named Jennifer, as was very pleasant. Jennifer took our drink order. My wife decided on a Raspberry Lemonade, and I decided on the Mango Tea. After the first sip on the Mango Tea, it just wasn't hitting it. The Black Tea overwhelmed the Mango flavor. None the less, Jennifer changed out my drink for a Wild Berry Tea. It was more flavorful....thank goodness because I needed something that was really going to quench my thirst!  My wife decided to have their Cowboy Burger and Fries and I decided on the Jalapeno and Lime Shrimp with a Rice Pilaf. My wife claims that this burger was one of th ebest burgers she's ever had! I guess it's just my luck? My Shrimp came out with white rice instead of Rice Pilaf. It wasn't my servers fault either, someone in the kitchen just decided to put it on the side and our server corrected it immeditaely! So, will I give Applebee's another chance? Most likely, yes!"
Violet T.,"Oakley, CA",1,6,3,1.0,5/12/2014,"Went for Mother's Day and the wait wasn't too bad. We were seated after 25 minutes. The customer service wasn't the best. But I did however notice that the three women behind us were getting so much attention. The manager, assistant manager and waiter were checking on them constantly. It was because they complained about a plate they had order. They all came and made it the lady's special way and kept checking on them. And even came and offered a free desert to them. We had the same waiter and he maybe checked on us 2 times. So if you want 5 star customer service you should complain about your food..."
Jassi K.,"Tracy, CA",0,3,,3.0,1/14/2016,This place is so good overall but could use few improvement. The service is great but food sometimes is cooked well.. Last week i went in for few drinks and order spinach artichoke dip but the chips was like dipped in oil. Drinks were made to detail and was truly exceptional! Hoping the management is paying attention to our reviews here and will consider few changes! :)
Jillian S.,"Tracy, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/28/2015,"I came here to get dinner, and it's been a half hour to a hour since I ordered my food. It's crazy how it's taking so long. I don't even want to pay."
Angelica M.,"South San Francisco, CA",157,6,,5.0,9/25/2015,"Love going to Applebee's with my family and friends! Such an awesome atmosphere to hang out and eat. Carmela was the hostess when I was in and her customer service was amazing! Greeted us with a smile and was on top of her game, taking care of those who came before us."
Red B.,"Tracy, CA",0,21,2,1.0,4/1/2015,"ever get sick off of under cooked shrimp?  ever send your ribs back also because they were under cooked and get them back, with half the rack burned to a crisp and tucked under the other half?  i have.  here.  used to be good.  what happened Applebee's?  when i complained, i got a free rack of ribs.....next visit.  uh, no thanks."
Space C.,"Tracy, CA",0,11,,1.0,2/4/2014,"Went here last Saturday to celebrate my cousin's bday. My wife and my cousin's hubby both ordered the ""9 oz House Sirloin"" while my cousin got the ""Double-Glazed Baby Back Ribs"" and I had the ""Honey Pepper Sirloin."" The House Sirloins tasted weird like they were about to expired and rubbery too. My Honey Pepper Sirloin was overly sweet like sugarcoated beef.  My cousin's Baby Back Ribs were dry and tough. The beefs weren't tender or even juicy like they said.   Our server was all over the place. He forgot to give us utensils. We waited for him but after 8 mins, we asked a different server to bring them. He also forgot to give us refills where we basically had to share drinks with each other until he can get us the refills. We didn't finish our meals since they were not tasty at all. We left feeling disappointed. If you guys are hungry for steaks then I recommend to make your own at home cus I'm sure they'll taste way better than here. The food wasn't delicious and definitely not worth the money."
L P.,"Tracy, CA",1,16,,1.0,8/31/2015,"I used to love coming here but something's changed in the last year or so. Most recently, the fryer broke and we waited 30 minutes until the waiter told us there were no fries available for our burgers,only mashed potatoes. Before that, the waiter served my husband the example plate they use. I guess the kitchen uses it as a reference. Prior to that, we were again served a cold plate. Good bye Applebees!"
Roz H.,"San Jose, CA",245,154,8,5.0,3/1/2014,"Samuel Is the best. Ask for him. Service with a smile, best perfect margarita, and best recommendations for dinner. We will be back. He kept a smile on his face and was very engaged with my family. We will ask for him next time we go back."
Ajay C.,"Mountain House, CA",2,55,,2.0,7/5/2014,"Too expense for what they had to offer and the service isn't as great as I would like. I had waited an hour and a half for a measly burger because the waitress forgot my order- twice. I ended up getting it for free with dessert so at least they take pride in their customers. However, the floor under the tables had trash everywhere and the food didn't taste that great when compared to in and out."
cris c.,"Danville, CA",1,44,1,4.0,12/14/2013,"Love this Applebees. The manager always comes to chat with us. You can tell they have improved on customer service and try to make it a great experience every time. Food is almost always good, one time my salad had a few browning pieces, but overall we are always satisfied here!"
C L.,"Tracy, CA",0,41,,3.0,9/20/2015,"Last visit we experienced ok service and the food was served in a timely manner while still being warm.  We were never asked if we wanted a refill on our chips and salsa order as it was taken away, but didn't push the point as we didn't want to fill up on that although they usually ask first.  Water was not refilled.  We had ribs and no extra napkins were given.  The music was really loud and I had to keep say ""what"" everytime someone at our table tried to say something.  It's Applebee's, not Elephant Bar or BJ's-it is what it is."
Elijah G.,"Martinez, CA",0,1,,5.0,8/23/2014,"Great food...awesome service.  I mean cmon, it's Applebees! What's not to love. Great food at an even better price. Love this place. I go with my kids all the time."
Steve W.,"Auburn, CA",1,37,36,4.0,9/27/2010,Just sat down .... waitress is cool!!! I had the full rack of ribs with a baked potato.  Excellent honey bbq tasting ribs .... wish they were a little more meaty though!! Guest had Ult Trio: Wonton Tacos / Dynamite Shrimp / Buffalo Chicken Wings......which we all tried and thoroughly loved.
Al D.,"Tracy, CA",2,56,,2.0,12/10/2014,"We are updating our review ... we visited again ... and again disappointed, the food is terrible , not seasoned correctly and just not well cooked ... the serve was ok, they try, but the place just needs a make over staff, cooks and management ... sorry guys we want you to succeed but you just keep coming up short"
Kim T.,"Turlock, CA",3,61,,2.0,6/20/2014,"I eat at Applebee's regularly. This is one of the worst one's I've ever eaten at. The boneless BBQ wings were drenched in sauce, which had a very strange flavor. The steak was chewy and not well done like I ordered. The fries were lukewarm and soggy. Save your money and eat at home."
Michael Q.,"Tracy, CA",17,25,2,2.0,5/19/2011,"Terrible service. Went once before and the service was subpar,mediocre bordering on terrible.  I tried it again last night and it was just as terrible.  It takes forever to get your drinks served. It took about 15, mon after a couple of us ordered to get our drinks. And when the waitress asked if we needed a minute to order, she gave us 20 instead. Then she gave me my food order while my friend had to wait another 10 minutes before she got hers. Another one of my friends was trying to order her food and while she was ordering, our waitress told her hold on, and walked away.  our waitress didn't even apologize or anything. She never once asked if we were doing okay but a table next to us were filled with her friends and she seemed to do her job well for them.  Fool me once shame on you-twice shame on me. That best describes their service. I won't be visiting this location in the near future. Terrible waitresses, and that's me being tame with my choice of words."
Michelle P.,"Tracy, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/20/2014,"05/17/14. The wait time to order a drink was about 13 minutes.  After getting drinks we placed our order for burgers and chips & salsa. Chips were stale. Didn't really touch, but waiters kept trying three times to bring more for us to choke on. Why? Got burger and fries. Burger had been sitting. That's cold fries. Made him feel how cold they were. Oh did I forget they dropped a bucket of ice and left it near the door they kept walking out of from the back. New fries came piping hot. Wait, I did enjoy my five dollar happy hour drink. Can't wait until Red Robin opens. Crossing my fingers."
