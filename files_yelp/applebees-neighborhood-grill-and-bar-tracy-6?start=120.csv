Kkmm M.,"Burbank, CA",0,43,8,1.0,10/28/2013,"If you like processed foods that come in packages to the restaurant, then this place is for you. Food preparation = lots of microwaves. Good drinks though, gotta give them that."
Missy B.,"Tracy, CA",29,136,347,2.0,10/29/2013,"I have 10 check-ins here probably only because it was a tall cold beer after work.  Not a fan of the food at all, not sure why so many people love Applebees"
Nikki J.,"Tracy, CA",39,41,5,1.0,8/30/2014,"I've never given only one star. I had thee worst experience ever last night! !Came 30 min before closing, I'm well aware your going to rush my service but this was unacceptable.  David greeted us and as he sat us looked at his watched at said just to let you know we close in 25 minutes. Thanks...I know. He waited ten minutes to ask if we're ready, I thought you were in a hurry? We came in for ONE drink anyways.  As I began to request the perfect margarita he rudely turned around to begin engaging in deep conversation with the same girls we was drooling over as he sat us. HOW RUDE. I sprung up and said thanks for NO service! He didn't even bother to turn around. I'm absolutely pissed to say the least. This should be a quick spot to grab a drink and quick bite to end the night. Sam has given me awesome service twice but this David guy must go he's clearly there for other things besides the company. Being a server myself I completely understand how it is to have guests the last 30 min but that only means you should try to get me in and out, shoot one more tip in your pocket won't hurt... I'm apppauled by the lack of customer care from these teen servers."
Denisa S.,"Manteca, CA",2,3,,2.0,7/28/2014,"This is the second time I have tried this Applebee's, and the service hasn't been good either time. The servers never came back to check on us or refill any of our drinks. I could hear the customers behind us and they had to keep asking the same server for things over and over. He kept forgetting their drinks, boxes, made an error on their check and they had to wait to get it fixed. The food there isn't that good to have to wait the amount of time that you do and to also receive poor customer service."
Carmen D.,"Tracy, CA",61,92,1,2.0,4/12/2013,The burger that I ordered it was ok... the service was HORRIBLE!. My husband cousin wrote a note on the check let them know how bad it was.
Jason B.,"Livermore, CA",42,33,17,2.0,2/8/2014,"We showed up at Applebee's at 6:20 we had a party of 14 and the girl told us 45 minutes, an hour and 45 minutes later we were seated I thought that was ridiculous, The food was pretty good, The service was good the people were nice but an hour and 45 minutes it's only Applebee's, and the bill was $288 I thought that was a little high, next time I think I'll go up the street to Texas roadhouse"
Kelsea Jonathan C.,"Tracy, CA",2,12,2,1.0,11/8/2013,This by far is one of the worst Applebees ever. We came in for lunch and it was empty. So we thought we would be seated right away. But no we waited for 5 mins. The male manager (looks middle Eastern) was rude. The food was mediocre.  My wife and I will not be returning.
Eugene L.,"Phoenix, AZ",202,228,68,4.0,3/13/2011,"It's just like any other Applebee's, until every Wednesdays... BINGO night!  4 games, free to play.  Prize is $10 gift card to applebee's.  On top that, all appetizers are $3 (this price doesn't apply to take-outs). They've got to be losing money here. So be here, or be square.  Wednesday nights at 10pm. (Other eateries nearby: Chevy's, Sonic, Texas BBQ)."
Royce S.,"Santa Clara, CA",409,50,7,4.0,2/5/2012,"I haven't been to this place in years! High School with some friends to be exact.  Tonight my parents invited me to dinner, of course Tracy doesn't have the most options and I am not a fan of chain restaurants - but I figured, what the heck. Why not Applebees! Just as I remembered it was packed with large groups and couples! They even had a hefty group of people at the bar, in which there are TVs with games and ESPN on! (a huge plus) I had steak with vegetables and for an appetizer we had the boneless chicken wings. Maybe I was just hungry - but the food was delicious. But I do have to give props to our server Christina. She was really sweet, nice and prompt!! I should come here more often! As I mentioned I am more of a independent/bistro/one of a kind restaurant seeker, but for a casual night with the rents, Applebees does the do - and the service was better than expected.  Thanks Mom and Dad for dinner!!"
Rachelle R.,"Tracy, CA",2,4,,5.0,3/29/2015,So I'm here having lunch with my family and friends and we were welcomed right away. Their customers service is on point. The service was fast they got refills right away. Our server was super nice and friendly. The food was great. I can say I will be coming back here. Good job applebees you guys are awesome :)
Megan M.,"Milpitas, CA",108,49,17,1.0,1/17/2013,"This USED TO BE a regular place for my family and I to go to, we started coming more frequently based on price, happy hours, and wednesday night they had a bingo game going on there. It was entertaining, and a fun twist to your regular sit downs. The thing that brang us back here time and time again were the reasonable price, and the food - the food is good. HOWEVER... my last visit here was quite unpleasant and has left me avoiding this place at all costs. Customer service is that deal breaker which brings me back to a business - My last experience consisted of slow service, the fact that WE had to ask for refills, the server nearly dropped an entire tray full of things onto my aunt, and at the end of the night they gave us the wrong bill... BUT THIS is what REALLY upset us...  we read a promotion on the table stating ""if a server doesn't tell you about our gift cards, you get free mozorella sticks"" - the server never asked us about the gift cards, and when we told her she didn't... THEY (as in she & the manager) argued with us... and we never got our mozarella cheese sticks -_-  i could go without the sticks, but come on! IT'S THE PRINCIPLE! smh. This left me with a VERY bad impression - luckily I could find an Applebees in just about every town and city - so I will not be deprived of it -  Our server was horrible, the manager was no help. Tracy location... I will never be going back until it's under new management."
Andrew A.,"Mountain House, CA",1,3,,1.0,1/26/2014,"Terrible service. Took a table in the Bar, self seeting, host then came to girlfriend and I and preceded to tell us we had to ""get up"" because there was an order of seating for this particular table? Either way there was no wait and no reason we couldn't sit there except the fact that it was a ""dirty table..."" There was literally nothing on it. I believe a server asked him to move us. Either way, this host had no idea what he was doing and had no clue what customer service was. Note to mgmt... train your staff, it's the only chance you have for return customers:) bartender was nice, food took entirely too long to arrive, but was hot and tasty. Thank god we had a gift certificate or this would be an even worse review."
Jerry M.,"Tracy, CA",1,69,,2.0,11/7/2012,"My wife and I are frequent diner's at Applebee's.  We always let the server know we are 'Golden Apple's' to receive the senior discount.  !00% of the time the check comes with no discount.  There is always a 'sorry', the manager needs to approve the discount. I say BS to this.  The bottom line is that they really don't want to give the discount.  Even though seniors are entitled to a discount it's not on the menu and a server will never tell you there is one.  Just another indication they don't want to provide the discount."
Thuyvi M.,"Hayward, CA",713,853,632,4.0,8/22/2010,By far the best applebees I've been too.  Looking for a late night place to chill and have a drink.  They are open till 1am on weekends. So came in with a friend to have a small bite and drink and catch up.  Bar or club would of been to loud and packed.  I must say the service here was awesome.  Charlie the bartender last night was very nice and friendly.  He made us laughed and talked to us into having a jello shot. Place seem very chill and relax but then again it was late.  However there were some beezies mean muggin. we ordered the sampler and that was delicious.  theres a late night happy hour which is good too but sampler was perfect.  I ordered the sangria and that was really good and refreshing.
Joe G.,"Tracy, CA",0,18,,5.0,2/9/2015,"I haven't eaten at an Applebee's in years (in Fremont), since their food quality and service went down the drain. We decided to give it another shot, though, and we were extremely surprised. The interior was remodeled, the server and hostesses were super friendly and attentive, and the food was actually really good and not all that expensive. We will definitely be going back, and hopefully our good luck will continue."
Jen F.,"Tracy, CA",45,126,84,1.0,6/10/2012,"We are frequent diners here and always get good service. Tonight, though, was a different story- our waiter completely forgot the ranch dressing that he offered. And as we were finishing our food- he started cleaning up! WTH?!  So for that- ONE star! This waiter (William) needs a crash course on waiting tables and customer service!"
Darcie N.,"Patterson, CA",9,116,9,4.0,9/8/2014,The food and prices are decent. I like the green bean appetizer and the chicken wonton tacos. The service is okay. The new burgers are yummy. I got mine with no bun. The toppings were underneath the cheese. Very good!
Rigo M.,"San Mateo, CA",5,27,7,5.0,7/6/2014,"This some of THEEE BEST service I have ever experienced at any restaurant ever!!  My gf and I came in for lunch on July 5th at around 12pm while we waited for our room at the hotel across the street to be ready. I was VERY impressed with our waitress Nelam. She was prompt & polite with a genuinely comforting smile. Even though we were not ""technically"" checked in at the hotel yet, she still offered us the 10% discount given to guests staying at the hotels in the close vicinity. Our waitress Nelam continued checking on us refilling drinks and such. The manger was very nice & personable aswell. He was out & about checking on his guests & stopped at our table & shared some pleasent conversation with us. My gf went to go use the restroom & rather than point the way he actually escorted her to the location... Unheard of at your typical chain restaraunts. After we were done with our meal we were still hanging out in their dining room for the cool air conditioning when here comes Nelam again with a complimentry desert for us while we waited for our room.... Oh, and the food was great too! Will most def be back here again! Again I was very impressed with the service we recieved at this establishment. The manager was great, though I can't remember his name. And Nelam was just fabulous!! NELAM DESERVES A RAISE, APPLEBEE'S!!!"
Stuart R.,"Playa Del Rey, CA",2,8,2,1.0,7/12/2012,"Worst service. Worst management. Worst food - not even cooked by on premise chef - instead from container from Sysco. Confirmed by corporate who didn't care, did not understand my call to them of outrage of soup from a container, as the waitress stated. HORRIBLE.  Tracy is pathetic to put up with this trash dump."
Shawna P.,"San Leandro, CA",47,110,4,2.0,2/19/2013,"Applebees is really not what it used to be.  The food isnt that good anymore.  The portions were very small and our waiter was MIA most of the time.  I would recommend this place for happy hour (drinks and appetizers), but not if youre hungry! & Dont ask for extra gravy, they like to charge for that!"
