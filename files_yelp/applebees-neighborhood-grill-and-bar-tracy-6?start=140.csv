R C.,"Tracy, CA",45,64,,4.0,9/26/2012,Awesome neighborhood staple. Just about the only decent bar in town. Consistent service and food. I see all the servers from other venues come here after work for the bar. That tells me something.
Mike S.,"Tracy, CA",27,34,,2.0,2/25/2012,"I used to go a lot 5 or 6 years ago but has gone downhill. Food is below average for cost. Sitting at the bar is nearly the only way to get good service. Most (not all) sitting in the main seating area gets poor service. With better options nearby, may wnt to explore your options. I had a really bad experience about 9 mos back and havent returned. I can say their desserts are pretty good though."
Jay L.,"Livermore, CA",14,37,6,1.0,4/15/2014,"My wife and I ate here on Sunday for lunch. My burger was really greasy. The service was slow, which is understandable, we were dining with the restaurant full of church folk. I ended up getting severe food poisoning. I'm not 100% sure that my burger was to blame, but I doubt it was the Mac and cheese I had for dinner. It's not worth the risk, we won't be returning."
Jennifer S.,"Tracy, CA",49,19,,4.0,1/30/2012,My husband and I love Applebees! The servers are very friendly. We were very satisfied with our meal and the prices are great. I had the best burger (jalapeno) and my hubby loved his shrimp and pasta! Yummmm!
Andrew S.,"Dublin, CA",11,35,8,3.0,11/21/2012,Okay American food. Decent service. Friendly atmosphere. Lots of TVs.
Deborah N.,"San Diego, CA",33,46,5,5.0,5/4/2012,I stayed across the street while out of town on business. Applebee's from my hometown is a favorite so I decided to walk across the street to have dinner. I was greeted with a smile and have exceptionally great service. Ray was the manager who came by our table and checked to make sure my colleague and I were happy. We liked the food so much and the service that we went back the second night.
Alexandra P.,"Livermore, CA",9,6,1,1.0,10/13/2011,This place sucks. The waitress we had was very rude and barely there. I didn't get one refill on my coke.\Food Sucks.
Eleanor G.,"Tracy, CA",0,5,,5.0,5/4/2014,This Applebee's is great....Samuel is the best server ever!....He is attentive and thorough...You can see that he truly enjoys his job....We will be requesting him when we go back......
Monica P.,"Santa Clara, CA",125,64,39,4.0,10/17/2011,This applies to Tracy location only. The service was great saturday night. I had a burger that was yummy!! My husband had the sirloin steak topped with shrimp and it was fabulous! I got to try it and it was almost as tender as a filet mignon. We were very happy with our visit
Shey P.,"Tracy, CA",64,64,6,4.0,9/10/2013,"i love happy hour specially jello shots, some servers are really on point and some are just okay but i love this place because it's really a place to hang out after a long week of work and just have your dinner and cocktails and enjoy their music while you chilling"
Nancy F.,"Mountain House, CA",27,219,257,3.0,7/23/2011,Coming for dinner at full price i would say NO WAY but they have late night starting at 10pm and appetizers are half off and they have drink specials including $1 jello shots. The music is pumping and the asian wings are great.
Josh L.,"Los Angeles, CA",125,190,47,3.0,1/17/2009,"I'm generally not a fan of the chain family grill restaurants.  Applebee's, Chili's, Chevy's, and everything that falls in here.  The food is usually OK, cooked in butter or deep fried, or covered in cheese. This Applebee's had GREAT customer service.  You can really tell that they drill it into the server's to be polite and attentive to the customer's needs.  Sometimes this is more important to me than the quality of the food. I mean I can overlook a mediocre meal if the staff really was there for me and not thinking about where they were going after their shift...but even if the food is good, a rotten attitude can ruin an evening. I don't know how other Applebee's staff respond in general, but if you feel the need to eat here, there's really nothing to be disappointed about. Only thing I have to gripe about is that there is a SONIC right across the parking lot.  Where the hell did that come from and what's it doing in California?"
Jessica H.,"Tracy, CA",18,5,1,2.0,5/12/2013,"The wait was short for a Saturday but now we know why. Waited 15 minutes before our waiter introduced himself. Very long time for our drinks to come. We ordered drinks, appetizer, and food all at once since we had plenty of time to decide. One set of silverware for a table of four and the silverware napkin was torn. We had to ask for more silverware so we could eat. Service was slow to non-existent. No salt & pepper on the table. Had to ask for steak sauce which our waiter completely forgot to bring. We had to ask someone else. Food was pretty good. I got the shrimp combo. Grilled shrimp was delicious but the breaded shrimp was overcooked. Husband got the steak. Also overcooked. Overall not horrible but probably not going back."
Anita B.,"Tracy, CA",1,2,,5.0,9/10/2011,"Charlie, Latoya, and Lizeth are the best!!!"
Dawn C.,"Tracy, CA",11,3,,1.0,8/31/2011,"It has been awhile since I've been to this resturant.  I thought it was going to be fantastic, great parking, seated right away when we walked it.  Now I know why this place was not as busy as it used to be.  We sat with our menu's in hand for atleast 5 minutes, and still not one server came up to ask us if we wanted drinks, or to tell us they would be right with us.  We ended up walking out, and as I was leaving I told the greeter why we were leaving, and got no response.  My mother who was behind me, said she heard an ""oh well"".  Not sure if that was meant for us or not.  But a simple ""I'm so sorry""  would have been nice.  We won't be going back."
Jim C.,"Redwood City, CA",150,1366,711,3.0,4/5/2008,"Applebee's usually isn't at the top of my restaurants to try list but we were hungry and was the first thing we saw it off the highway. Service was accomodating.  The quesadilla burger was pretty good. Cajun lime tilipia was okay but left me yearning for more. Bottom line: Good menu selection, clean place, some dishes better than others. 3.5 stars."
Misty J.,"Portland, OR",18,129,1,1.0,12/13/2009,"No. On the way home from the holiday farm in Lathrop, I saw a billboard for Applebee's. It sounded good at that moment, driving in the dark, being showered with pouring rain. I envisioned steaming hot, cheesy appetizers and a big, satisfying dinner. So I got on the cell horn and alerted the caravan, and we filed into the Applebee's parking lot. While everyone else was parking, my daughter and I went in to put our name in for a table. The hostess looked at me and smiled. I smiled back, prepared to give her my name and have a seat. Nope. A couple minutes pass. She looks at me and smiles again. She was in a conversation with another hostess, trying to figure out tables to seat some people that were in before us. The other hostess went to seat said people, and a group came in behind us. Just as the first hostess was preparing to ask the group BEHIND us for their name, I was preparing to open my mouth to ask WTF....and the second hostess came back and did it for me. The first hostess was like, ""Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't see you,"" which struck me as a rather odd (and stupid) thing to say, given the fact that she smiled at me twice. Oh well, it's Christmastime, I decided to let it go, put in my name, and wait out the five-to-ten minute wait for our party of five. Once we were seated, a girl came and took our order. I asked for the Queso Blanco appetizer and the Steak and Portobellos. I placed my daughter's order, which needed to be done carefully since she's allergic to milk. 8 times out of 10, this is not a problem. The server was very accommodating, bringing me the ingredient list for the hamburger buns and assuring me that my daughter's meal would be milk-free. Everyone else placed their orders, and we all waited for our food to arrive. First out was the Queso Blanco. It looked DELICIOUS. I grabbed a chip and scooped up a nice amount of cheese and pico, blew on it a bit since I figured it would be HOT, then devoured it with glee. Almost. Um, why is the cheese COLD?! Hmmmm. We all ate it anyway, but still. Cold melted cheese product? What the shit? Then came our food. They put my plate in front of me, and I was very confused. When did DRIED portobello land on the menu? Because people, it's there. The portobellos looked DISGUSTING. I was glad I ordered the mushrooms and garlic topping on the side, cuz the portobellos were so unappetizing, I needed to hide them in my napkin so that I wouldn't have to look at them. Then, biting into my ""steamed"" broccoli, I heard a CRUNCH. What the shit again! Then, my daughter happened to lift the bun on her ""milk-free"" burgers, and found that they had been BUTTERED.  Oh. Hell. No. Do you have any idea how SICK that would have made her, had she not happened to notice that and eaten those sliders? Are you KIDDING me? We had told them, if there is any milk product on or in the buns, just bring out two patties. This is why I was UBER annoyed with another server informed us that the buns are buttered in the morning, before the restaurant even opens. Well WTF, we could have just gone with the patties in the first place, and my ten-year-old wouldn't have to sit there and watch everyone else with their food while she waited for the cooks to make her food correctly. I wanted to kick our server, I really did.  Then, after giving her our credit card, the server took 30 MINUTES to bring it back. WHAT THE SHIT?!?!?! Never. Again."
Michele C.,"Tracy, CA",8,65,,2.0,8/13/2008,"I normally love Applebee's. I used to come here on a weekly basis back in high school. But I'm only doing this review based on last night. It was very strange.  I went here with my friend and her sister for dinnertime around 9pm. Normally I have no problems with this place. There was a significant amount of people, but it didn't seem too busy. Everyone was laid back, eating, drinking at the bar, watching the flat screen, etc.  I'm unsure if it was just the waitress, or maybe they were shortstaffed. But the service was really slow for some reason. It took like 10-15min. just to recieve a beverage. Around the same amount of time of waiting to take our order too. Me and my friends were looking around confused as to why it would take so long for any of that considering how slow it was.  Also, my drink was all weird. I ordered standard strawberry lemonade (one of my favs), and the first time it was light pink but it seemed they put way too much lemonade and pulp and only a little strawberry. When I asked for a refill, she came back with a bright red kool-aid looking beverage. I looked to my friends and then looked at the glass and started laughing.  Did the waitress not even notice the difference? Did the bartender not care? I was really confused. I order this drink everytime I'm here practically, and I have never seen it look like this. I guess I just find it strange bc it's never happened to me before. It was like water with red food coloring with a slight taste of strawberry.  Overall it was just a weird night. I always have a good experince, but hopefully they won't disappoint me like that ever again."
Valerie N.,"Brentwood, CA",40,19,8,4.0,6/27/2007,"I'm always surprised that I like Applebee's, but I do.  Today I had the three cheese chicken penne and caesar salad combo.  My cherry coke was quite tasty too.  :) Good service, great prices for lunch.  :)"
TJ N.,"Tracy, CA",6,11,,1.0,1/26/2013,"Food is not as good as it used to be.  We were told on a Thursday Night, that it would be a 45 minute wait, even though it was after 7 p.m. and NOT even a weekend night! I had to stand up, even though I'm handicapped, there was not room on the waiting bench.  After 20 minutes, we were finally seated, but for the price you pay, the food really ISN'T WORTH IT.  And they NO LONGER HAVE PINA COLADA SHRIMP, EITHER.  They tried to claim they never did, but the one in Oakland served it to us once."
