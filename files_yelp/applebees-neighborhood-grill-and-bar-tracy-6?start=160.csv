Jay S.,Bay Area,107,247,10,2.0,10/25/2008,"On the way back from Milpitas today, the kids and I were hungry and we wanted to stop at the Tracy Petco so we decided to drive around and look for a place to eat. We tried Chevy's and Olive Garden but they both looked pretty crowded so we finally agreed on Applebee's. The restaurant looked full but no one was waiting so we figured we'd be okay. We were seated right away, the waitress brought our drinks and took our order and then we sat for about 30 minutes. Not once did the waitress come back and check on us or try to explain why it was taking so long for some buffalo wings and a salad. Then we had to wait forever to get our drink refills. But of course the bitch ran right over when it came time to pay the bill!! Did she ever apologize for the wait? No. Did I give her a tip? NO! The service was so horrendous that we will never go back to this Applebee's."
Larry S.,"Tracy, CA",2,37,,5.0,11/12/2011,"This is not a blanket endorsement to the entire chain, only to the Tracy , CA location.  First of all, I would like to thank this restaurant for their Veteran's Day Special ""Free meal for all veterans"".  I usually suspect deals like this, but I entered and found the free meal to be a choice of many of my favorite entrees, so I selected the always-excellent 7 ounce sirloin steak dinner, and as usual it was as delicious as always.  The only thing I would change is to cut out some of the butter on the baked potato, but then again, I guess there are some folks that like a lot of butter and Applebee's errs on the side of generosity. The service was very good, again ""as usual"", and veterans were asked to sign a poster and leave a message and were presented with a hand-drawn ""thank-you"" by some very polite children from St. Bernard's Catholic School in Tracy.  So thank you Applebees for not only your excellence in putting out a consistently great meal with good service, but for also showing respect and appreciation for United States military veterans.  As a veteran, I appreciate it and I will be back."

Jason O.,"San Francisco, CA",60,71,3,4.0,4/30/2006,Applebees is great.  They have good food and a full bar.  They have successfully merged the sports bar and restaurant genres.
John R.,"Tracy, CA",9,54,,2.0,2/2/2007,The food is el horible.  Crowd not so hot either.
