James B.,"Tracy, CA",96,3,,5.0,11/18/2016,"Came here on Wednesday night, and was seated immediately. The staff were really friendly and made my dining experience enjoyable. My server Carmela was really friendly and knew the menu really well. I was unsure or what to order and Carmela recommended the fiesta lime chicken. It was delicious, and it is my new favorite menu item. Will be back here soon, and requesting Carmela as my server."
John S.,"Alameda, CA",92,53,733,4.0,3/29/2016,"5 Stars - very friendly helpful employees. Front door was opened for us on arrival and departure. Quick to assist us as son as we were inside. Mike our server was awesome. Visited on 03-28-2016 @ about 6:30 pm. 5 Stars - food served hot and is flavorful. Lots of good tasty sounding dishes to choose from. 3 Stars - new feature is having to use a touch pad to get refills on drinks and to get your check & pay at your table. No one explained that that's what it was for and I didn't see a sign to inform you either. Every time I looked at it it was displaying games to play. So me and my guest waited for refills and for someone to bring us the check until our server Mike came by and explained it. 2 Stars - we did have to wait for our table to be cleaned and the employee that had to do it, well, she didn't look very happy that she was told to clean it. 3.8 Stars average."
Devonne G.,"Stockton, CA",179,23,2,1.0,9/8/2016,This place is garbage. I asked for a well done burger and it came back pink. Totally ruined my appetite.  Tables were sticky as well. Waitresses were not friendly. Not a busy night at all but the service was slow. Never coming back again. I'm upset that my husband actually left them a tip.
Jordan B.,"Discovery Bay, CA",26,3,,1.0,6/16/2016,"WE have tried and tried and TRIED to give them a chance to hopefully prove us wrong. We live here in Tracy and our joke is ""It's Tracyfied"". Every time a business either opens or changes employees they go down hill fast.  The last time i was there i ended up walking out because 4 waiters/waitresses walked past me and my husband about 2 times and we still didn't even get a drink order taken from us. So we handed the gentleman in the front the menus and told him if they don't want people to walk out then they may want to get drink orders in after 20 minutes of waiting. Yes 20 minutes. I wish i was exaggerating but i had a timer on my phone because i wanted to make sure that i was correct.  WE will not be going back to this applebee's."
Tamas S.,"Tracy, CA",30,4,2,1.0,6/12/2016,"I ordered for 4 person and we got for 3, my wife order shrimp and salmon with sweet potato, she got it with regular french fries. My meal shows up 45min after - i asked put it in to-go box. Totally disstatisfield, i never came back. My cell 415 316 5748 Tom"
Donna F.,"Ripon, CA",1,83,396,3.0,9/18/2016,"Stopped in for lunch and sat at the bar.  Had the steak and bean soup was tasty.  Also tried the Pepper-crusted sirloin on a bed of hearty whole grains, It was good but I would have liked stronger pepper taste.  The bartender, Heather G., suggested the perfect margarita....great recommendation.   Expensive cost 29.70 not counting tip."
Audelia A.,"Dublin, CA",0,6,,1.0,4/5/2017,"FILTHY PLACE!!! Just by looking at the dirty carpet filthy table monitor and dirty coffee mug.... I lost my appetite and couldn't eat there, so we ask to pack our food and We headed home. Food was ok, the onion rings and fried food we ordered seemed to be cooked in super old oil. My coffee mug was dirty and stained with old coffee. Waiters were friendly and attentive. THIS RESTAURANT NEEDS MAYOR CLEANING ALL AROUND, including DISHES & UTENSILS!!!!!!"
Tim J.,"Stockton, CA",7,17,1,1.0,2/21/2016,"Just stopped by here today (Apple Bee's in Tracy)Sunday at 12:08 PM the 21st and we were offered a high top in the bar which we took. We sat there for what seemed 15 minutes and nobody even acknowledged us. The very young manager walked pass us three times as well as many servers. The restaurant was only at half capacity. There is no sense of urgency within this restaurant and  I can now understand their 2.5 star rating. If the manager is going to be out on the floor, he should then actually atleast pay attention to what is going on. Try smiling at a guest or actually have a conversation with them.   Needless to say, we are here across the parking lot enjoying a great burger ay Red Robin.  The service was great!"
Tanisha S.,"San Leandro, CA",0,3,,3.0,4/3/2017,"Went to Applebees on Sunday to celebrate my mom's birthday. We were seated in the bar area which didn't appear to be too busy. Our server was really nice however, my sister had to ask 3 times for a glass of water with lemons and by the time she got it, we were almost done with our meal. He also never came by to see if we needed anything, nor did he offer to remove plates in order to make room for our food. My son ordered the ribs with two sides, fries and a side salad.  Well he never got his salad until after we had finished our meal. We had to call the manager over twice and by the time we left, 1 of two, 2 for 20 meals was free."
Jeff M.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/16/2016,"Horrible, horrible service. It took over 10 minutes to get our drinks and we only got half of the ones we ordered. We had to ask a different person to take the rest of our drink order.  We then had to ask someone else to take our food order as our original waitress never came back to our table. It took over 25 minutes to bring us our food and two of the meals were wrong.   I ordered the fish and chips and only ate a few bites as the fish was not cooked properly.  To top it off, the bill they presented us with was wrong and it included items we never ordered.  There are plenty of food options available in Tracy. I highly recommend you pick anything other than Applebee's."
Rachel G.,"Fairfield, CA",45,24,11,4.0,9/15/2015,"The Good: Most Applebee's are the same. You've been to one, you've been to them all. The reason we keep the Tracy Applebee's in our date night rotation is the bartender, Krystal. She's friendly, fast and her service has never let us down. As long as she's tending the bar Sunday nights, we'll keep coming back. We also are a fan of their 'Sunday Fundays'. You can't go wrong with an all day happy hour. The rest of the staff here also seems incredibly friendly but we  only sit at the bar.  The Bad: We have a policy when we come here: never order the steaks, never order the ribs. It's actually an Applebee's wide rule for us. Thankfully their menus change often so we usually have plenty to choose from. The Ugly: No complaints on the decor here. It looks like every other Applebee's. We do appreciate the local love and the Tracy related photos though."
Jas W.,"Manteca, CA",0,15,3,5.0,9/11/2016,"Went to Applebee's  on Saturday Night with my family , and I have to say it's  best service I've had in a while and the food was great.. Amy my waitress was amazing very attentive and friendly, the  the burger I ordered was on point along with a ice cold beer , but get shock top back lol"
Karin W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",12,30,4,5.0,9/25/2015,All Applebee's are the same! That can be a good thing! Tracy has one thing better than all the rest - Krystal! She is awesome! Fast and attentive service always! I always sit at the bar! Now I'm moving and will miss her!!
Melissa P.,"San Ramon, CA",124,99,321,5.0,6/3/2014,"Let's face it, my family and I are regulars here. I'm talking, every Friday, Monday and sometimes mid week. I love the staff who work here, all very friendly. We've seen people come and go but our regular bartender Jen is great and our favorite waitress Liz. If you get the chance, sit at the bar tables! That's where you can get sat with Liz!  Beer selection is not so hot. But the atmosphere and food make it up I guess. Oh and they have rebel IPA on tap right now. Keep it going with craft beers Applebee's!"
Veronica L.,"San Jose, CA",14,6,2,2.0,11/28/2015,"Sorry but I kinda get grossed out when the bathroom is nasty. And I don't mean a little unkept. But down right disgusting. Makes me wonder how clean the kitchen is and how unsanitary the staff could possibly be.  Beyond that, service was just ok. Not over the top pleasant or helpful, but not rude either. Food came quick and a decent temperature. Also wasn't necessarily the freshest tasting.  Just plain Jane average + a disgusting bathroom = I'll skip that place next time."
Leslie L.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",2,49,10,5.0,10/17/2015,The service was fast the waitress was very nice and she repeatedly and made sure we had drinks and the food was good there was no wait and reasonably priced. Elizabeth was 5he best part of the lunch. She us a very good waitress.
Scott J.,"Tracy, CA",6,9,,1.0,6/19/2016,"Poor experience with dinner. Ordered their ""new"" steak salad.  Looked good on the menu.  Sadly, the steak pieces were very small and only four pieces.  The spinach was wilted and the whole salad was in some kind of glaze that made it taste like something out of a can, not fresh!"
Mhateen W.,"Tracy, CA",0,32,1,1.0,4/27/2016,I call and they tell me they don't have fajitas... Lol none of them at all.. Ohkayy just cause it's a hour before close you don't gotta be rude about it I just asked for the price. Shitty.
Daniel d.,"Tracy, CA",0,9,2,1.0,8/7/2016,I've been coming here for a while now. I started coming here mostly because of the bar service. The food has always been great. My one complaint is that the quality of service has dropped drastically. I only see 2 familiar faces and the host/service turnover ratio is crazy! Every time I come back it's different people. Employees seem complacent about what they are doing. Yes you get greeted at the door and the smiles are great but don't seem genuine. I recommend only sitting at the bar here. It's the only way you get your order correct and your drinks quickly. Service with a smile isn't really a trademark anymore. Maybe less turn over and more customer service training is needed here. Applebee's went from the place to be to don't even bother coming. Stay home and cook while saving money.
Isabella Isis R.,"Tracy, CA",1,29,56,1.0,1/23/2016,I usually eat here and it's great this time wasn't so fun my chips for my dip where stale my pasta was messed up and plain and my blue ribbon brownie had cold chocolate and brownie I'm disappointed car side to go not so fun today
