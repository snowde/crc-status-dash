Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",67,382,737,1.0,4/19/2015,"I would give a minus if I could and after reading all these reviews- I will share my thoughts with you! Over two months ago we visited the Milpitas location (check my review) I also sent this review onto the Corp. Office and in-turn got a call from Eric Schmitt who is the GM for numerous locations including Milpitas & this location is his ""home store"". We spoke over 9 weeks ago regarding our extremely disappointing experience at the Milpitas location. He claimed he would be visiting that area to discuss mine : as well as other patrons issue with the staff. He also claimed he would be sending me a GC to ""try them"" again for better results & extended his gesture: that if I was even in the area to stop by the Tracy location. I have never received anything in the mail, he never followed up! So disappointing and won't be back to  either of these locations @ Applebee's anytime soon.  Seems this GM's territories lack in good customer service and that stems from the corporate, to management, down to him & his staff. Follow through!!"
Ramon R.,"New Braunfels, TX",8,1,,5.0,9/20/2015,Applebee's is always a bomb spot to go to with buddies after work. The environment is awesome and they are always showing the latest games. My buddies and I always go to after work and always ask for my favorite server Rudy! This guy knows our order by memory now and knows how to take really good care of us. He has never failed to disappoint me. I've gone in there on a night when he wasn't working and sat at the bar and it wasn't that good of time. I enjoy how cheap their menu is. It allows us to keep ordering food while on a budget  The stay opened till 2:00 am so you have enough time to go after work  go to Applebee's and enjoy their full American menu and best of all don't forget to ask for Rudy!
Sandy V.,"Stockton, CA",51,4,1,4.0,6/24/2016,"Stopped at Applebee's in tracy today with Robert n my mom. Robert really enjoyed his burger. My fish n chips well let's just say they will never be known for their fish. lol...Cornell the manager came by to apologize for them bringing our appetizer after our meal. So I mentioned my fish to him. He was so apologetic. He offered first of all free appetizers, then my meal was free and then gave us a free dessert. With a genuine smile. Hats off to Cornell, he really knows how to take care of customers. ,"
Mishelle N.,"Tracy, CA",808,242,303,2.0,4/30/2015,"No busy at all for lunch - treated myself to lunch just needed some adult time, 5 minute before I got served"
Brittany I.,"Tracy, CA",370,70,44,1.0,7/17/2016,Just leaving this Applebee's after coming here for lunch. Our server (a blond young man with glasses) was less than eager to be at work. Ordered our food and requested our kids food to come out first. One of our sons got their food while the other one waited an additional 10-15 minutes. Then my son ordered a corn dog and fries and it was cooked so long that it was hard as a rock. There was also a big piece of lent mixed in with the fries. We hadn't seen our waiter in awhile so I got up and asked the bartender if he could order another corn dog and fries and presented him with the old one.  About 15 minutes later our server comes by and hands my son his new plate of food. No apologies were offered. I asked for two place settings and he brought back two plates. So our table of 5 only had two forks and two napkins. We were offered refills after I had already paid the bill on the little table computer. Paid $50 for a disastrous lunch. Will not be back.
Richard D.,"Tracy, CA",0,9,,3.0,6/7/2016,"The Carside-To-Go waiter was very nice and helped accommodate a $5.00 coupon that was on the main screen for   that came up as ""invalid"" when I applied it to me online order.  The reason I am giving it 3 stars is that my ribs were VERY dry (overcooked?), tough and hard to get off the bone.  The flavor was good, and I do like my meat cooked very well done, but for ribs, they shouldn't be that way. Especially for $20"
J Y.,"Brentwood, CA",16,37,,5.0,6/15/2016,"Five stars for an Applebee's might seem excessive but after having come from another restaurant in town where we walked out after 20 minutes and not even being acknowledged we were impressed and appreciative of the service we got from Michelle F in the bar area.  Good service, good drinks, better than average food - we'll definitely be going back."
Marco G.,"Tracy, CA",0,4,1,1.0,5/31/2016,"Amy you suck. Lets start with that. We get there,waitress(amy) seems weird to start with,like she didnt want to be there. We order our drinks and appetizer first and then ask just for a minute to look over the wrest of the menu. She gave us 30mins. Literally by the time our drinks and appetizer was gone she came to ask if we had a chance to look over the menu,UM YES B#~%^?! Also adding;when she brought us our appetizer she said ""YOUR WELCOME"" but as if she was waiting to hear a thank you.(which we did say but she must of not herd us). Finally we order our food,a fair wait later they bring out the food and my plate was a totally different meal than i ordered. Some other lady had brought it out so i let her know i didnt think this was my plate and what i had ordered. And tryd telling it was fine tho cuz i didnt want to have to wait another 30mins for a steak to be cooked.  She quickly took it back before i can finish,okay Whatever. Then our waitress comes out and takes our drinks to get refills and apologizes for my order mix up stating she pressed the wrong button. Anyways i have to wait hella long for my correct food to come out,it comes out and she apologizes again but this time stating it was cuz she couldnt hear me.um no?! Cuz u reread my order outloud to me! Why u lien for girl?! Remind you we still havent gotten our refills back. Finaly after eating a little she comes back with my drink and my girl's drink to but...she gave her water...she originally had sprite. Now its time to pay,she cracks a small joke obviously to kiss a lil ass for that tip. Put my receipt on the table but i pull out my card and say she could go ahead and take it now,she quickly takes the reciept back,looks at it,and SWIPE goes my card on the lil tablet thing. Bypasses the amount im bouta pay and goes straight to the tip option and then hands it to me. Then takes off with my reciept. $62?!?!? Wtf was $62 at applebees?!? She walks by our table again so i ask to see the reciept. She had to go print another one cuz she through away the original(mind u this all happened within only 2minutes). As shes reprinting shes talking to her manager(she already knew she fucked up) and comes back with the incorrect charges already circled(i never said i was overcharged yet,i just asked for the receipt). She then says their gonna credit me back $8...she pulls out 8 wrinkly ass dollars and puts it on the table....dis biotch. The whole time she never once came to ask how we wer doing,start conversation or anything. Only the one time she got us our 15min wait beverage refill. Like tf?! I cought the manager eyeballing us acouple times, would have been more pleased if he had came up to personly apologize for the mulitple mix ups,but he hid in the back of the bar area most of the time. Literally not 1 employee had a smile on their face. Beside the super blonde young host,she smiled,she was nice. And then there was this black dude,i think i seen Michael on his name tag,he wasnt helping us but i saw his interactions with his tables,let me say this dudes service looked A1,this guy needs a different job simply cuz he deserves to work for a better company! You the Man Michael!  Anyways,Hoe got no tip ofcourse. And not cuz im some kinda broke ass but cuz her service sucked ass,im normaly a very generous  tipper. Realy chose apple bees to see what talent was there,im activly recruiting for positions at a high-end fashion retail store. Wonder if i got shitty service cuz i look younger or cuz amy had a stick up her ass. Ether way DONT GO HERE! Go next door to red robin,das my shit."
paul d.,"Sacramento, CA",75,12,23,4.0,10/5/2015,"nice place to watch Monday night football. Also, since I'm staying at the Marriott hotel.... I get an additional 10% off my meal, which is cool."
Bruce H.,"Discovery Bay, CA",2,97,7,3.0,12/30/2014,"Visited on 12/30 prior to a shopping visit to the local mall. The place was full with a line waiting for tables. Noticing the bar and bar area tables were empty, we asked if we could sit there and were told yes. Service was prompt and friendly and drinks were served within 2 minutes. Anchor Steam is now a good addition to the draft lineup. Lunch entries are modestly sized but soups were hot and tasty. French onion and the tomato soups were both good.  I would probably say that Chili's is the closest competitor and Applebee's has a better menu for those who are more conscious of calories, fat etc."
Sara B.,"Tracy, CA",0,6,2,1.0,5/24/2015,"So when first walking in to applebees it was okay. We got seated fairly quickly. When the waiter came to take our order he made everything so confusing because he was trying to split the bill right then and there. At first I was okay with it because maybe it saves him time at the end. In total we ordered 13 items for our table. Our original waiter brought out 2 items and then WENT HOME, leaving us with a different waiter who had no idea about anything for our table. We waited 30 minutes for another 4 items to come out and this is when we began to get frustrated. We then waited another 30 minutes for the rest of the items after the waitress had to ask us what we ordered. When we ended up getting the food it was cold and soggy, but that's not the worst part. We ended up not receiving 1 item at all, we decided we had been there an hour and thirty minutes already so we cancelled the order. We honestly just wanted to go home and watch a movie like we had planned.  We really got mad when she brought out the bill and she had charged us for the item that was cancelled! Also, all that time we had put in the beginning to split the bill obviously didn't matter because it came all together! This was when everyone at the table wanted to run out.  When we told the waitress about our problems with waiting an hour and thirty minutes for food she said, ""it's not my fault"" and took off. Take in mind I am not a person to blame, I was not rude. I only wanted her to fix the problem but, all we got from her was attitude.  We also told her we needed to see a manager she said,""well, we need to know the problem before we can get him,"" really? Because I've never heard of that before. So we told her the bill isn't split, ""oh, i can fix that, you don't need the manager,"" okay... Well you charged us for the item we cancelled after it took an hour and thirty minutes, ""oh, I can fix that too,"" we finally told her her no we need the manager.  When the manager did come he was handed a different receipt that didn't have the item on it, the girl had given him a different receipt than what we were handed and we couldn't even show him because she took it! The manager was also rude though! He only came over blamed us and then took off to divide the bill. Basically he just came over to shove us out as fast as he could, he did not solve any of our problems.  I usually give a place a couple of times before I decide I'm never going back but, this was my last straw. I've already had four bad experiences there.  This place has really gone down hill since Ray left, all the waiters/waitresses that used to be good at their job, now are the ones I'm saying beware to! Our waitress's name was Jessyca Y., if you get her run out as fast as you can! The manager is the problem here though, bring Ray back! It'll be a few years before I try applebees again period, unless I hear Ray's back in town because that's the only way the service and food has ever been good.  And now I am saying HELLO CHILI'S"
Liza B.,"Tracy, CA",66,6,6,4.0,9/14/2015,"I eat here all the time and may I say their food is delicious! Everything that I order upon my visit always comes out POIFECT.  Typically I experience very welcoming servers but one of their hosts Carmela is truly extraordinary. She's always there with a positive aura and an even better smile. I can't help but feel the love every time I'm eating here! She sits us quickly everytime and lifts my spirit as I enjoy my meal amongst her presence.  However on September 13 at around 8 pm I was waiting to have my order taken by one server for waay longer than I have ever experienced. A little odd? It was pretty busy, I give them that. But I was never even told ""sorry about the wait.."" And I noticed other tables who came in later being helped before us. Hmm. Not only that but our food was a little off when we received it too. It seemed like it was just sitting in the kitchen bc it was a little cold, which never happened For my other visits here. And my server was not even the one to serve me my food even tho the rush died down a bit. The food however was still exceptional! But -1 star for that terrible service from that pale young lady with dark make up who served me. Smh"
Bob M.,"Discovery Bay, CA",1,61,,1.0,6/11/2014,"After careful consideration, I'm writing a letter to Applebee's corporate office and attaching a copy of my Yelp review, but will be sending it anonymously since I'm not seeking any kind of ""corporate"" response, and certainly not any comps which they may try to offer. Applebee's in Tracy needs to seriously clean-up their act, even though my wife and I will never eat there again!"
Christina H.,"Stockton, CA",118,10,4,1.0,4/19/2014,"There is NO consistency at this Applebee's location. It's either a hit or miss -_____-  and tonight it's a HUGE miss.  Please Be AWARE of the most slowest server ever! Named David. He does the least he can as a server. Greeted us once, checked back for drinks, place our order, then doesn't even bring our dinner out to us. The only time he came to check up on us was to refilled my bf's water twice. & I think he had the hots for him. Idk? But very dissatisfied with my experience.  I really wish the customer service was much better. Because I literally was gonna walk out."
Teddy R.,"Modesto, CA",1,15,9,5.0,5/13/2014,"I am new to town and I been to a few apple bees in the bay area and for some reason I never really thought apple bees food was great but my waitress, I think her name was Vicki, was VERY AWESOME!! She made some great recommendation and WOWWW!!! I AM HOOKED!!! I tried the Wanton Tacos, Pretzel and beer cheese dip, steak quesadillas from the appetizers and also mac & cheese w/ honey pepper chicken!!  Quite Scrumptious, a must try!!!!  Thanks for the recommendations!!"
Rob J.,"Oakland, CA",3188,105,2,1.0,7/20/2015,All the food taste like it was frozen food. If I wanted this kind of food I could have went to Costco. Terrible tasting food.
Ashley L.,"Tracy, CA",0,1,,2.0,1/12/2017,"First of all I'm only giving a 2 because front of house did an awesome job...the ranking literally has nothing against the service its mainly againt the inconsistency of food and attention to detail. So me my husband and our 8 year old son went in today around 4pm, i cant recall our waitress name but she did great. My biggest problem from the start was dirty silverware, it took 3x to get a clean fork. Gross!!! Also we ordered the 2 for $20 deal, our wings were hardly sauced. We've been here multiple times in a 3 month span and the wings are never same. Disappointing. Also i always order the 3 cheese chicken cavatappi but in the last 3 months they must of had a change in the kitchen. There is either no flavor no sauce or watery sauce with still no flavor. It's really hard for a business to have customer loyalty if their kitchen is soooo inconsistent. Get it together guys I'm rooting for you! Front of house great job!!! Keep it up!"
Ed B.,"Tracy, CA",51,8,,1.0,1/13/2016,"If I could give them less I would. My fiancé and I sat there for 20 minutes with zero service. We watched the servers walk right by, made eye contact with a group of them hanging out around their manager and yet no service. We will NEVER return thanks to this horrible experience."
connie w.,"Tracy, CA",36,45,,2.0,9/18/2015,"Menu  changed again. Bingo night on Saturday, and awful music..."
B R.,"Corona, CA",8,32,17,2.0,5/14/2015,"Ive been 3 times now because there on not a lot of options when im in town working, and all three times the service has been terrible. The young staff is more concerned with hanging out and having fun than they are with waiting on their tables. Be prepared for ling waits, empty drinks, and just all around sub par service. The food has been good once it come out but the staff is a disappointment."
