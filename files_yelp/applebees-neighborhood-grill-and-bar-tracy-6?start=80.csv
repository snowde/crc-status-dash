Jessica D.,"Tracy, CA",0,6,1,5.0,6/3/2015,"I had a great experience every time I went here. Always had my order right. The waiting can be a pain sometimes, but if you go early in the morning not many people are there. I come there three times a week, or every two weeks, they only messed up on my order once but they didn't charge me for it. The one in Tracy isn't so bad compare to Oakland."
Francis L.,"San Francisco, CA",59,15,,5.0,9/18/2015,"Great customer service by the host the other evening. Carmela, the host  was kind, polite, and set proper expectations on a busy night. Hard working individuals are easily recognized, and this individual deserves all the credit on a thankless position."
A W.,"Tracy, CA",0,5,,5.0,9/16/2015,Carley was the best server and bartender. She had such a great personality and is very friendly and attentive. Thank you Carley.
Tom S.,"Concord, CA",0,14,1,4.0,9/8/2015,The new burgers are great.  They looked like the pictures.  I have not seen any other restaurants food looking like the picture that they use.  We tried both the new burgers the brunch and the blazin Texan. Both were good but we both wanted more of the brunch burger. And since they are only $6.99 on Monday we got another one and split it.  What a deal for the burgers.
Cristina J.,"Tracy, CA",34,32,1,1.0,6/14/2015,"Very disappointed. I love Applebee's and often defend it to people. My friend that does not like it finally came with me tonight. Where to start? Table was sticky when we sat down, the fries on both our orders looked like they had been sitting there all night and were cold. My friends bacon on his burger was very undercooked and they never asked how we wanted the burger cooked. Very sad. Don't think I will be back anytime soon"
Jessie A.,"Tracy, CA",12,97,2,4.0,3/6/2015,"We go to this Applebee's on a pretty regular basis. The service is always pretty good. The food is your typical Applebee's menu and it's prepared correctly here. Not over the top amazing, but it's good and the prices are reasonable.  This location is usually pretty busy at night, so expect a short wait if you're coming during dinner time."
Jane D.,"Tracy, CA",113,13,,1.0,8/26/2014,"Went to Applebee's and the waitress Michelle F is very rude. I said thank you and she laughed. She left my last drink 20 min ago and still hasn't come and taken my debit card. She laughed when I said thank you and walked away twice when I said excuse me for her to come and pick it up, also the restraint I empty only me and 3 other tables  Yeah she really did do it twice"
Signe M.,"Tracy, CA",9,8,,2.0,3/22/2015,"Service was not so good we had to ask for silverware. Our appetizers came with part of our meal, the other 2 people in our group had to wait for about 7 minutes to get there meals.  The pasta bowl was missing the bread stick, we asked to get one and they never brought one.  We had to ask for all our refills."
Stacy H.,"Tracy, CA",0,2,,2.0,11/2/2015,"Don't bother to do Car Side To Go at this location. Waited outside for 20 minutes after the time it was supposed to be ready and didn't have anyone come out. I finally went inside only to have to flag someone down, explain that I had been waiting outside, and find out that my food had been ready the whole time. Everything was incredibly cold and no one seemed to see that there was a problem with that. What a waste."
Reny D.,"Tracy, CA",25,19,,1.0,6/7/2015,"Omg, gross. We ordered the 2 for 20 which you end up getting up charged for 90% of the items now. I had the honey chicken tenders with 3 cheese Mac n cheese. The noodles were bland, no taste of cheese. They poured the sauce they put the chicken in over the top of the noodles which made it into some sweet runny cheese less sauce YUCK!"
Cindy M.,"Tracy, CA",6,21,4,1.0,12/22/2014,"Went last night with friends for a total of 6 of us.  Lousy service, had 3 different waiters before the night was over who didn't relay a thing to each other.  My meal came out incorrect and was sent back.  By the time I got mine back most everyone was done.  Was offered nothing for this inconvenience.  Had items on my bill we never had.  Menu doesn't have items we use to order.  Rarely go to chain restaurants, and won't be going here anytime in the near future."
L A.,"Tracy, CA",3,14,1,3.0,10/26/2014,"So my comment is not going to be about my overall feelings of Applebees, but more of a complaint I had tonight with this one waiter in particular, DAVID: I've been a regular customer with Applebee's here in which I take advantage of happy hour with a friend. I always order drinks here and am always asked to show my ID, especially since I am well aware that I look younger than my actual age.  Tonight I was out with a good friend of mine and when I ordered my drink, our waiter DAVID asked ""are you even old enough to drink?"". I know he was probably just joking around, but I didn't hesitate to show him my ID. As I was opening my wallet he was there right next to me and looked at my cards in my wallet and made the comment ""Wow, you have like 4 ID's in there. Which one is your real one?"" At this point I got a little mad. First off, he does not know how to count, as I only had my driver's license and CA ID in my wallet... so that makes 2 ID's, not 4. Second of all, I thought his comment was really uncalled for, annoyingly sarcastic, and RUDE. I understand that they should check for ID's, but for him to have the nerve (whether he was joking or not) to criticize me (indirectly) of having fake ID's was unnecessary. And LASTLY, he did not even ask to see my friend's ID, who also ordered a drink, and is also 2 years younger than me. What the f*ck? David has been the first waiter at Applebee's that I have ever had for that only reason. Don't try to be a smart-a** and an a**hole. Overall, Applebee's is good; you get what you pay for. But I don't want David to be my waiter anymore because of his action towards me and also because I did not leave him a tip because of it. lol"
Stephanie S.,"Tracy, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/5/2015,"I can honestly say this is the worst franchise location I have ever been to, and I would never recommend this place. The last couple of times we have eaten here the service has been terrible. The employees that work here are more interested in socializing amongst themselves then serving the customers. We have stopped coming here for a while, but my husband and I decided to give this place another chance tonight and that was a mistake. We called in at 10:03 and requested an order for pick up and was put on hold. We remained on hold for 7 minutes. Its a Wednesday night after 10 pm, there is no reason to put a customer on hold for that long when you know for a fact you are not that busy. This place is ridiculous. Take your business somewhere else."
Janet D.,"Denver, CO",2176,2277,16397,4.0,7/17/2009,"Applebees is always going to be one of my fav. This is no exception. Came here to check out their Fetuccini Alfredo and I love it! This location is busy but what Applebees isn't? The staff was excellent and we got seated, served and everything else in less than 15 minutes!"
MC Ratio L.,"Tracy, CA",56,1,,3.0,8/8/2015,"Seating was fast, our waiter for the night Rudy got our drinks fast and had good customer service. I ordered a Spinach and Artichoke Dip for Appetizer and the Napa chicken and Portobellos, which is my go to choice. My appetizer came out fast and within 10 minutes my Chicken and Portobellos also came out, both items were hot and fresh out of the kitchen. Oh yes and I also ordered the Brownie Bite for $1.75( for that price I can never pass it up) Fast and friendly service. I was overall satisfied. The waiter did make our experience better than previous visits.  I gave an A-OK rating because of the following details. :D As many of you may know Applebee's has updated and improved their menu... Since these changes I feel that the portions of food given have changed as well. Yes this is what bothers me. I am BIG on ratios.  Our previous visit is when we encountered the new and improved menu, which to me wasn't that grand, but liking Applebee's enough, I  decided stay and order. I ordered my usual App of Spinach and Artichoke, I should add that it's Happy Hour so they are half price. I then receive my appetizer and  I am frustrated, because somehow it was not the size I remember it being. Plus my dip to chip ratio was way off. I had this mound of chips and a little bowl of dip. Not Cool. I only ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Appetizer, because I normally ONLY order that knowing that is fills me up. But they flipped the script on me when they came out with this half-sized and half-priced Appetizer. I was bummed. But I didn't say anything and just decided that I couldn't hang with the new and improved Applebee's. Then last night my husband and I decide to give them a try again. Like I stated above I had a good experience. This time around I asked the waiter before I ordered, since its half-priced will my appetizer be half-sized? He replied with an oh no it's regular size. This made me happy until it came out. Now it did come out fast and hot, which was good, but my chip to dip ratio was STILL no good. Plus the dip was filled about only half way, which left me feeling half satisfied. Then I anticipated my delicious Brownie Bite, but when it came (yes arrived fast), I was not happy with the size. I felt let down, because this too got smaller. My brownie was smaller and the ice cream scoop was super tiny. I am all about ratios and there was not enough ice cream to go along with my bite size brownie. BUMMER!!! I like having ice cream with every bite, but this didn't happen. When my main plate came out I had a BIG smile on my face. Why you ask, because the ratio was on point and this was the only thing I ordered that was the same as I remembered. I can never finish the whole thing, and I still couldn't. :D HAPPY ME. Applebee's wasn't really my go to place and probably still isn't, but with few options in Tracy, ya  gotta roll with the punches and take it. This Place is definitely a hit and miss in my book.  Mc Ratio out. :D"
Edie E.,"Suisun City, CA",13,18,21,3.0,4/28/2013,Dinner at Applebee's with Cristy and family. I  had the baby spare ribs very tender. Applebee's  is improving their manu. I will be back.
Jas S.,"Pleasanton, CA",56,39,29,4.0,12/20/2013,"I actually didn't want to write a review but since our server Edith is super awesome:))) I'm writing one:) Edith is so nice and very friendly:) she got our orders right and is very attentive and sensitive to each tables needs.   We ordered from the 2 for $24 selection and combined with some take out orders as well.  We ordered grilled cedar salmon and Napa chicken portobello... Both dish are pretty good.  Take out orders of boneless wings, chicken penne, four cheese mac and cheese and another order of cedar salmon.  We weren't happy with our chips and salsa order.  The chips are nasty!!  Whatever brand they switched to is not working at all. I suggest to go back to old brand or recipe. .....or serve  chips hot!  Safeway sells those homemade fried chips in their deli so probably you may want to switch to those types of chips:))) Parting comment made when we exited... Nice!:)"
Frank O.,"Tracy, CA",8,1,,1.0,10/7/2014,Worst food and drinks i have ever had. Super watered down drinks and cold uncooked food. Never had this experience with applebees before in my life. Very sad to say i will never be going back there again
John G.,"Elk Grove, CA",16,122,18,3.0,5/2/2013,"I don't have any major complaints for this experience.  The food was good and the service was decent. A few complaints highlight the experience though.  One was that the bartender was making way too much noise during our service, slamming things around and breaking ice.  While I imagine it's necessary to do these things in order to perform service, there has to be a quieter way to do it.  It was drawing the attention of every table and was very loud, consistently. Overall it wasn't a horrible experience..."
K H.,"Torrance, CA",12,46,51,5.0,11/6/2014,"Great place to get a bite to eat, watch a game and have some drinks ... Friendly workers ... And a local hotspot to hang out"
