Deja A.,"Beaverton, OR",12,189,506,5.0,10/7/2017,"Came for the $1 Margaritas and did the 2/$25. Everything came out amazing! A friend and I each got about 3, $1 Margaritas and she also tried the ""Magic Potion."" On their Halloween drink menu. (She enjoyed it!) Our server was awesome, super attentive and balanced our small table as well as his huge tables. We really appreciated his hard work! (I can't remember his name)"
Diane B.,"Portland, OR",27,1,,5.0,12/8/2017,"Always Good Food,  and Late Night Service.  Fantastic Staff will let you know when is busy and takes a bit more time. Good Healthy food great menu great drinks, comfy atmosphere."
Maygan P.,"Springfield, OR",71,74,163,3.0,10/9/2017,"It's a chain restaurant, so I knew it would be okay. We came for the $1 margs, which were actually $1.25 water margs. We probably won't be doing that again. My hubby and I ordered steaks. Mine was cooked perfectly, but they overcooked his. The boneless wings were tasty as well as their sweet potato fries (cost extra). Our server was super friendly, but the hostess could have used a little smile."
Rose E.,"Portland, OR",446,462,2334,3.0,9/14/2016,"Applebees is one of my husbands favorite chains. He always gets the same thing.  They seemed a bit rushed this time. There was no wait for us to be seated, but we must have arrived at just the right time, because some parties did have to wait a bit.  Since we always get the same thing, we were ready to order, and drink & food orders were taken quickly, but food orders weren't put in to the kitchen in the order in which they were taken compared to the guests around us that were seated later.  I liked our server a lot. He made conversation with us as though he had time to do so even though he was pretty busy. Much appreciated.  I'm not sure if it was a manager or just a greeter, but another party had left their cell phones and both phones were safely retrieved and held for them. In this day and age, so many people have such a ""finders keepers"" mentality, that I'm very impressed by this. The couple was so surprised and relieved to come back and find their phones waiting for them.  We both made special requests/substitutions in our meals, and these requests either did not make it to the kitchen or on to our plates, and could have been resolved in a more timely manner,  but were fixed eventually. They accidentally offered our dishes to another table, but fortunately this was resolved before the dinners were served so it did not cause much inconvenience or delay.  This issue was not a surprise because I've noticed that every Applebees appears to have quite a high staff turnover rate. I've rarely seen the same employees there on consecutive visits.  I really like how Applebees tries hard to fit into the neighborhood in which they do business. The menu is similar wherever you go, but the decor varies based on location. At least they make the effort."
Angela R.,"Portland, OR",133,175,637,5.0,1/10/2017,"Loving this escape!! Soup, breadsticks and a screwdriver while my car is broken down.  My truck broke down across the street, to my pleasant surprise, here was an Applebee's. I went inside and glanced longingly at a booth for four by the window that could see the parking lot for when my ride arrived, with out hesitation and even though I was flying solo, the host said ""I can sit you here"" and in a hospitable gesture gave me the spot. They were full. The next party of two had to wait for a spot. I was very grateful. They acted like it was no problem at all.  Next, the food was great. French onion soup and a screwdriver to kick off my visit, then pretzel- sticks and cheese dip... and another screwdriver. :-) yummy. The soup was grade A! Not watery, perfect balance of bread onions and cheese. A must have now, in my book. The atmosphere here is really comfortable. Not overwhelmingly bar like, I find that with some Applebee's. The TVs are present but placed so that your eyes miss them unless you choose to watch.  I like it here! I will be back!"
Robert T.,"Tualatin, OR",7,9,,4.0,10/25/2017,"Their dollaritas are gr888. Service is good too.  Hey, I know it's a lame-o chain but with prices, service, and yes, food this good, who cares?"
Lacy K.,"Schofield Barracks, HI",0,2,,5.0,9/24/2017,"Last night I noticed pheebee had a lot of customers in her section & she still did such a wonderful job. She got our order right & made sure my family & I were happy with our food. She managed to keep our waters / drinks filled. She was always so pleasant when checking on us. She anticipated our needs before we had to ask, excellent customer service & we will be back to visit her again (:"
Michaela L.,"Wilsonville, OR",0,4,1,1.0,11/12/2017,Chicken wings were frozen and cold had them redo them and same we gave up and ate them anyway because they weren't completely frozen we ordered the beer cheese chicken and the bourbon chicken beer chicken was bland and dry the bourbon was super burnt and was flavorless but we where do hungry we ate it anyway very disappointed
Cassandra C.,"Oregon City, OR",265,186,461,3.0,3/28/2015,"Run of the mill Applebee's. Our server was decent, but the woman serving the couple behind us was so attentive. I was pretty jealous of the great service they received. They have new software at the tables that assist in ordering food and making payment. I like the computer personally, but I do not expect to give a 20% tip to it. It helps you calculate the tip, and I felt odd leaving my server a large tip for very little customer service.  However, the server behind us definitely deserved one for friendliness.  We ordered the Pretzel Sticks with Beer Cheese Sauce, The All American Burger, a half rack of Chipotle Ribs, and the kids mac and cheese with mozzarella sticks. The pretzels were fried and the cheese sauce tasted just like Gustav's Restaurant fondue. I don't think I would order them again. The burger was not half bad. I liked the consistency of the meat with the bacon, onions and pickles mixed in. I was happy to see some pink in it. The rest of the burger was unremarkable. The ribs were standard for this type of restaurant. The kids mac and cheese was the common kraft clone variety.   I really wouldn't go out of my way for a Applebee's, but it happened to be there, and really is not the worst you can do. They serve what they say they will and do not pretend to be something that they are not. This location was cozy, and made a fabulous dirty martini."
Scotty B.,"Tualatin, OR",0,7,2,1.0,7/15/2016,"Wow. I just left Applebee's because the server Michael was so rude. I was pleasantly greeted and sat then after a few minutes Michael came and introduced himself in a very rushed or OMG somebody sat my section way. Then when I asked him for a virgin Mudslide he said,"" you know that is only a chocolate milkshake."" I said okay... Then he looked at me like I was dumb turned to my husband and said,""you want anything?"" He looked appalled then said we needed more time. Michael rolled his eyes then said,""well do you want me to order that chocolate milkshake."" I said no. So he turned and left the table. We got up and left. Now I remember why it has been so long since I had been there."
Miza C.,"Sherwood - Tualatin North, Sherwood, OR",43,2,,5.0,8/27/2017,Perfect. Food was delicious and the customer service was excellent. The waiter Bryan did a wonderful job on my visit Friday aug 25
Alex P.,"Portland, OR",28,17,,4.0,3/7/2017,Always have a good time. My son loves playing trivia and it allows hubby and I to talk. Food is always good and they bring it fast.
Craig G.,"Newberg, OR",1,93,37,3.0,10/25/2016,"Looked like an Applebees. Service was like an Applebees. Food was that of an Applebees. Wasn't horrible but not mesmerizing, it's an Applebees. So I guess all expectations have been met for an Applebees."
Paul M.,"Salem, OR",1,28,3,5.0,1/13/2016,"A pleasure to leave 5 stars to ""this"" Appplebees. The hostess seated us, our server was right there, and the restaurant was filled with wonder sents. BBQ, meets bourbon st grill. The food was fast and prepared to excellent perfection. The restaurant was clean, and the entire staff was friendly.   We will travel out of our city to visit here again."
Starr L.,"Tualatin, OR",0,2,,2.0,5/4/2017,"Now, I've been coming to this location my entire life and generally don't have too many problems here. The food is decent, it has very good hours, staff are friendly. But my girlfriend and I just went there a couple nights ago and while my food was good, she was not so lucky. She ordered the tomato basil soup, and when she got near the bottom she found corn and tortilla strips. Obviously, we were done after that. I don't know exactly what caused that situation, but I don't know if we'll be coming back any time soon."
james c.,"Seaside, OR",8,624,1,3.0,10/8/2016,We had not been to this store though we have been to several Applebee's over the years. Service was attentive. Management was visible which is nice. I ordered the Thai shrimp salad which I thought was good. My wife had the Asian chicken salad and was pleased.   The kids tried various drinks and different kinds of food depending on prejudice and past experience.  We had not been to this store before but know the brand is reliable. So did the Rotary exchange kids we were accompanying. It was a good lunch for a fair price.
Mychal M.,"Tualatin, OR",107,5,20,2.0,5/1/2016,"Love me some plain jane Applebee's from time to time. This particular time was not enjoyable though. Friendly service, pretty good food(only come for happy hour) but the soft drinks were totally flat!! I'm not much of a soda drinker but I know how it should taste and this was horrible. This is the place you go to if its the last resort"
Cassie M.,"Sherwood, OR",1,6,,2.0,11/1/2015,"I think I've only been in an Applebee's twice in my life, and now I remember why. Service: decent. The hostess seemed pretty bored, but she was nice enough. Our service was on top of it; my water was always full, additional items asked for were delivered promptly, et centers. Our server was nice enough, but nothing to write home about. Food: the spinach and artichoke dip was alright, I've had better but I've also had worse. I ordered the Clubhouse Grille with no bacon or ham (just turkey and veggies) and sure enough, it was served to me with bacon (sigh). My boyfriend ordered the fish and chips and the fish was SO oily, the tarter sauce wouldn't even stick to the fish! I found a hair on my plate, too. Overall, nothing special. Atmosphere: typical restaurant on a Sunday; lots of football, pretty quiet.  We won't be going back to Applebee's."
Tricia J.,"Portland, OR",9,34,17,4.0,2/10/2015,I love the new menu with so many More options especially for kids.  We have so many food limitations the new menu let's is order low carb and grain free for the kids.   Had the couple special 2 meals for $25.  Great food tastes good!
Cheri L.,"Tualatin, OR",190,9,,2.0,7/16/2015,"The food was amazing but the service was not. Reasonable prices for the quality, however, the store was nearly empty and our waitress only checked in with us twice. Also, I had to ask for a refill on water over 40 minutes after I had finished, and we had to wait a half an hour to have her pick up our check. When we looked around, many waitresses and waiters were leaning around the bar chatting instead of doing their jobs. I love Applebee's but I just feel that the staff did a poor job doing their jobs and attending the customers."
Casey D.,"Old Town - Chinatown, Portland, OR",13,4,3,1.0,9/28/2015,"Honestly, I didn't have the highest expectations, but me and my friends left assured we would never go back to this location.  Within the first 5 minutes of being there we were asked 3 times if we wanted to order- to which we obviously needed to say no because we didn't know a thing about the menu.. and after it took them probably 10-15 minutes to come back again.  When our server finally came, he seemed very in a rush to take our order- until someone mentioned the margaritas. Suddenly he was VERY talkative to tell us all about how he has sold the second most ""perfect margaritas"" in the district.. which is only because the bartender was first. End of friendliness.  About 5 seconds later of my friends deciding- he repeats their orders as if hurrying us along to leave, almost overlooking me ordering completely.  As it was late at night- happy hour was posted ALL over the building, we all of course ordered appetizers myself getting a couple clearly included in the half off deal.  About 10 minutes later we get our food and my friends who ordered exactly the same thing got twice as much food in their servings.  When we asked what was going on- he told me I clearly ordered the full price ""sampler combo"" which was absolutely not the case. Never was the word sampler used, never did I point that out somewhere, etc. He continued to argue that I had apparently pointed to something that made him think I wanted the option that would get me literally half as much food and pay a dollar more- and this NEVER made him think maybe he should point out the deal I could get or ask to clarify.  Instead of just clearing up the mistake, he continued to argue until my friend just simply asked him to bring the remaining food I wanted and was going to pay for.  Another 10 minutes later he brought the rest of the food, set it down without saying anything, walked away and never said anything to us again. We paid at the table side payment machine and never saw him again.  Again, I didn't have the highest expectations for an Applebees at the end of the night- but this server was unprofessional, rude and made us all feel uncomfortable. None of us are the types to complain in restaurants- but 4 of us could clearly see his argument for what he did was faulty and downright deceptive.  Server aside- it was also freezing to the point where we were all wearing coats and sitting close to each other to stay warm. They clearly didn't want people to stay around any longer, or deal with us any more than they absolutely had to.  I will absolutely not go back to this restaurant."
Betty G.,"Molalla, OR",0,8,,1.0,12/31/2015,"I have never had good food at an Applebee's, but I had a gift card and decides to try again. I'll just list pros and cons.. PROS: Fast service, friendly waiter! He was absolutely on it! 4-5 stars for him. Food seemed fresh. CONS: Over priced. $9.50 for a margarita?? We paid $67 for three people to eat... Food was not good. It was subpar at best. I had shrimp wonton stir fry, and it was so salty and the rice was minute rice! Plus my mushrooms were burnt. Everyone else's food just wasn't great All in all, good service but the food is just not worth the price. I will not be coming back. Save your money and go to Red Robin or something if you want a family friendly sports bar."
Suzanne S.,"Sherwood, OR",1,3,,3.0,12/17/2014,"The steaks were delicious!   Overall, the food experience was great, but when we asked our server to lower the music volume, he said that ""he could not"".  Then the manager came over and proceeded to explain to us why ""not"".   ""Corporate wants the volume up for a festive atmosphere"".  , or something like that.  I explained that one of our friends had a hearing aid, and that the music was too loud.  He then turned it down a bit.  It was after 9:30 pm, there were not many in the restaurant.  I always thought that the customers comfort came first.  I guess I was wrong."
Rhonda m.,"Aurora, OR",1,14,8,2.0,12/11/2015,"Generally I have little expectations for Applebee's as a whole but tonight validated my feelings and reminded me of why I should never consider this location EVER again! We were seated pretty fast but then the problems started. ""Mike"" was our waiter apparently but obviously was overwhelmed because a middle aged waitress came over to tale our drink order after loudly expressing to the entire section she would be helping Mike out. I Wished we had just waited for Mike because this woman was rude and snapped at my husband when he asked a question, Got an attitude when we asked if she could take our order after sitting there for 20 min. Because Mike wasn't going to apparently. The food was subpar and not very good considering the people serving it were so unpleasant. This location needs a staffing makeover."
Jorge G.,"Dayton, OR",0,3,,5.0,6/17/2016,"The service was excellent. The place was very clean and all the staff was friendly. Our food came fast, and it was very good."
Leah C.,"Beaverton, OR",6,46,10,3.0,4/14/2015,This Applebee's is good and nice staff. They just take forever. Don't go during lunch hour or you may not make it back in time. Clean and courteous as well.
Jamison B.,"Portland, OR",160,62,113,4.0,1/20/2014,"It's Applebees. ONce you been to one, you've been to all of them. Or have you? The staff here is fun, friendly and fashionable, if a bit more low-key than you'd expect from ""your neighborhood bar and grill"". The children's menu has recently been changed and there are some awesome options for the tykes. Full bar, a few brews on tap and app specials late night equal a nice place to spend $20 during a game."
Tammy W.,"Oregon City, OR",0,5,1,3.0,1/22/2016,"Stop in for lunch on our way back from Lincoln City (Oregon Coast) we ordered their lunch specials. Great prices and portion for lunch descent. However the chicken pasta penne tasted bland the sauce definitely tasted like powder cheese sauce, chicken was cook great. My husband had The chicken special and fries was good tasting, if you like lots of breading though, Sauce yummy. For the pricing very good quick meal to fill your tummy. Service friendly as usual. The new check out system is a little un personable though (just an opinion)"
Ashley S.,"Tualatin, OR",0,22,,4.0,5/29/2014,It's applebees what can you say.  The waitresses are friendly everyone on staff that I have spoke to has been great. If there is ever a problem they fix it!  I once told them there wasn't enough rum in my mojito and it was fixed by the next one!  The nice service that you get when you go here is what makes this place.
Leslee M.,"Arlington, VA",0,9,3,5.0,12/31/2014,Joe is fantastic! Really enjoying him as a waiter! Y'all need to keep him around!  The restaurant is super clean and a great menu selection. Great for a lunch break!
Stephanie A.,"Tigard, OR",14,30,17,2.0,6/8/2014,"I've been to this Applebee's many times before tonight, and it's always been a fairly pleasant experience.  However, tonight was very different from those other trips. Our server was not attentive, and seemed to  be either new or having a very off night.  Our starters came to the table, but we had no plates to eat on.  When she returned half- way through our starter, I asked nicely for small plates, and she responded very politely, but sadly brought them long after we were finished. Our entrees were fair, but portions seemed to be 1/3 what they used to be.  I ordered the rib eye steak, medium and received a very rare medium at best.  Not to be b*tchy, but my veggies were cooked longer than my steak. Of course I'll eat there again, I can't do without the Oriental Chicken Salad every now and then!  All I'm saying is don't get your hopes up, mine were WAY too high, and I was greatly disappointed."
Meagan L.,"Concord, CA",4,23,,4.0,11/4/2011,"Wow y'all are being weirdly critical of a chain restaurant. You know what you're getting when you come here, and yet you feel special enough to crap on it? Sleep tight tucked in with your notions of entitlement, children. Anyway, I have no beef with this place. As a matter of fact, I really like their food. Plus their bar has an amazing happy hour with big beers and long islands for cheap. Half priced appetizers during late night? Good enough for me. The quesadilla and the boneless wings are my faves. Cori is the best bartender too, take note. Trust me."
Jim J.,"Tualatin, OR",0,37,2,1.0,3/20/2015,"Oh boy... I realize this Crapplebees, but c'mon!! Totally apathetic!! Don't you dare sit down to eat while hot food is in front of me with no silverware roll. Prep your guest BEFORE food arrives. This is food service 101. Overall, a forgetable experience. Server nor manage seemed to give a shyte. Work on your service and watch your tips increase. Try it. I dare ya..."
Makayla D.,"Seaside, OR",0,26,,3.0,7/3/2015,Fairly average food but what really got me was the service! Our waiter seemed to be avoiding our table. We were hardly checked on and pretty much ignored. I think there is some racial issues at this Applebee's.
Cedric N.,"Beaverton, OR",301,163,1385,5.0,10/5/2013,Great staff! Very clean restaurant! The have half off appetizers after 9pm I believe. Got my food fast and it tasted good! I recommend this apple bees! Five star!
Amy D.,"Oceanside, CA",3,34,11,5.0,11/17/2013,"It's a chain restaurant so the food is what you'd expect. The customer service was fantastic though. Jamie was an attentive, professional but fun bartender when my husband and I visited for a late night dinner/drinks. She made nice conversation and even gave us some great info on the area. Theres not a lot going on in Tualatin and Applebees was the last place I'd expect to have an outstanding meal and drinks. Next time I'm in Tualatin I will definitely be back to visit the bar and hopefully have Jamie again as my bartender."
Robert S.,"Tualatin, OR",1,61,6,2.0,12/21/2011,"Crabapples......Ugh....Average food at best.  Very little on the menu for the non-meat eating consumer.  Tualatin's options for food availability after 9 pm are places like Applebees or Buffalo Wild Wings (which is at about the same level as Applebees), so options are limited.   Acceptable for a late meal, but not impressive."
Dan C.,"Amity, OR",0,43,,2.0,5/4/2015,"We have stopped at this Applebee's 2 times. The first, about a year ago, the service was slow, the staff courteous and the food kind of like a microwaved TV dinner. We stopped again 2 days ago and it was outrageously bad. Not only was the service poor (without many tables filled) but the food was bad. The worst part was going into the bathroom where someone had thrown up and puke was all over the floor. After we got home one of us started getting sick and had diarrhea for 2 days. Was it the food? We aren't sure but it wasn't anywhere else he ate. We like Applebee's and usually go to the one in Salem and it is very good. This one though, I can't recommend."
Eric F.,"San Jose, CA",1,14,5,5.0,7/7/2013,"Giving 5 stars for Spinach salad. I ordered the berry spinach salad but this time I asked them to ""double"" the spinach and give me a side of blue cheese dressing. That was a perfect salad! Really I did not need to eat anything else, but I did. It came with grilled chicken. The only way to make it better is if I could get grilled or blackened salmon on it...Thumbs up for good service and allowing me to modify my choices. The spinach dip was also very good...Very nice they are open late.."
Thomas W.,"Tualatin, OR",0,2,,4.0,2/4/2015,"My family and I go to this location every other Tuesday night  for the family night. We have a good time and love the staff there. It is a friendly atmosphere and clean, the food is what you would expect for the typical food chain."
