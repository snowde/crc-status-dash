Alexandra C.,"Wilsonville, OR",0,8,,2.0,1/27/2015,"They have started a new computerized thing on the edge of the table that pretty much does the servers job. I went with two other people and the server came and got our order, she wasn't friendly, but not rude either. The gadget on the edge of the table did everything else. Asked you if you needed a refill, or there was a ""Call your server"" button. If I am tipping someone to wait on me I feel like I shouldn't have to use this thing. She didn't check on us once and my drink sat empty for half the meal."
John C.,"Portland, OR",107,141,203,1.0,8/24/2012,"***THEY DON'T CARE***               I had a late night dinner on Tuesday with some friends and chose to do the 2 for $20 1 appetizer and 2 entrees. We got 2 orders of that and split the 2 appetizers and got our own entree splitting the the 4th entree. Our order was 2 buffalo wings, 1 bourbon street chicken, 1 sirloin steak, 1 riblets basket and the Oriental Chicken Salad.  The food tasted slightly above average and was not too impressed on the service. They didn't get the timing of when to come around for needs and refills on drinks. After we left the place somewhat satisfied, I started to feel uncomfortable hearing my stomach making bubbling noises and when I got home I ended up with explosive D*%$#@A! I called them a few days later not because of what happened that night, but because of the extra charges on my credit card. We did a 3 way split on the bill and ended up getting charged the whole bill including a separate charge that was split 3 ways. I explained to the male manager  what had happened with the my charges. He explained that it was a thing that is just pending? I really didn't understand the process and I wish they would have told me about it. Also shared about the explosive D*%$#@A! the night I ate (bourbon street chicken). I let him know to maybe check up on the chicken being served so that others will not experience that. I did not recieve any compassion or anything comforting except to call back if the charges are not changed within a week. I wasn't looking for any compensation but to be taken care of as a continuing customer but none..."
Keith B.,"Portland, OR",10,89,3,2.0,6/10/2012,"im only comparing to other chain resturants otherwise it would be 1 star. their food is way over priced for the quality compared to other chains were at least you get more crappy food for your money and sometimes actually ok food. 13.99 for 7oz steak, part of a red potato, and a mushroom with spinach and a very little parm. their steak is premarinated bottom round not steak. it came out over cooked and the server and manager blamed it on the marinade. when it came out over cooked the second time the server said i need to order it rare to have it done medium and blamed the over cooking on the marinade. each time took over 20 minutes but they didn't over cook it...lol. here's a clue 20 minutes is too long to cook that small piece of bottom round they call steak.  the meal got comp'd. the saltiness is also a real problem. BUY REAL STEAK APPEBEE'S and you won't have to marinade,over salt,over cook.  the service was very blah but no worse than other chain's who hire people who just don't care.  their menu is a bit non sensical in that they have a lot of low calorie items but no low calorie drink options. for your own profit why would exclude all your calorie counters from buying a beverage from you??(save diet cola). i been here sevral times before as my cousin like them but never again. there are way too many place to eat where i can get better food for less money. @megan..if i waste my time and money somewhere i will definatley write about it..being a chain is no excuse to serve food that bad and misrepresnt bottom round as steak."
Ashley C.,"Tualatin, OR",21,82,61,3.0,2/25/2012,Average food for average+ prices. The happy hour can be good.
Evan D.,"Tualatin, OR",34,19,,3.0,11/10/2011,"I live nearby, I am happy to eat here anytime.  If I get off work at 10:30 and don't feel like cooking or getting Burger King, this is often where I end up.  They are open until 1 AM on weekends, have dirt cheap drinks (especially if you have an OLCC card!) and have different drink specials every day of the week. I have never ordered food that I was unhappy with, but it is not the kind of food you rave about either.  Happy hour and specials change so frequently, that one could come in twice in a month on the same day of the week and not get the same deals. While most bartenders are great, one in particular tries to nickel and dime you at every single turn.  I do not mind attempts at being upsold, but I personally would never do it to regular customers, especially by offering the same upgrade on multiple dishes (if I didn't want to pay for sour cream on my quesodilla, why would I on my chili cheese dip?).  I have slowed down my visits here since Buffalo Wild Wings moved in across the street (and stole my favorite bartender as well) but will happily drop in at least once a month when I want to get full and wasted for 30 bucks."
James L.,"Tualatin, OR",21,6,,2.0,8/13/2012,"Good food, bad service. I used to like Applebee's a lot. I stopped liking it because I consistently got very slow service. The food is good enough. I would go there more often but I have to wait forever to get my food, forever more to get more water or whatever I was drinking, and then forever more again to wait for the check. If this was once or twice, I would let it to, but this has happened to me at two of their locations nearly a dozen times. I recommend going, but if you get slow service, don't go back..."
Marci S.,"Newberg, OR",0,1,,1.0,2/15/2014,"Awful, AWFUL service! I like Applebee's but this location always had terrible service and bad food. To top it all off they turned down 25 people when the restaurant wasn't even full and we were even willing to split up. The manager was such a jerk! Especially after we had even called ahead and asked if they could handle us. All 25 of us were in the waiting area! Not only will I never go back to this location I won't being eating at Applebee's."
Debbie T.,"Portland, OR",0,76,,5.0,6/29/2013,I was very pleased with my lunch.  I got a great salad with grilled prawns for $11.99.  The serve was good and I liked the atmosphere.  I will go back again.
Rob R.,"Oregon City, OR",115,8,1,3.0,3/21/2011,"Same old applebees. Drinks seemed to be overpriced and under served. Dinner was so so, not worth $13.99. Wait staff was great and atmosphere was good. Not terrible for a national chain."
Sabrina P.,"Beaverton, OR",6,16,,4.0,1/22/2012,"very nice atmosphere, reasonable prices, kid friendly. i really like that when i'm craving a steak....i can get one for a reasonable price instead of having to save for 2 months to go to a fancy restaurant for one! i also like that if i'm craving steak on kids night it's all the better! they have kids night on wednesday's i believe with 2.99 kid meals! i've eaten at this applebee's 5 times & only had my food messed up 1 time & the manager was so apologetic that he took it off my bill & gave me dessert for free :-). now i will say though that you get what you pay for...so while i can get a reasonably priced steak here....it tastes just like that. there is no mouth watering orgasm going on for my tongue...there's no melting into my seat from the savoryness...it's reasonably priced. however, considering i didn't have to buy it last minute, cook it or wash any dishes....it's good for me!"
