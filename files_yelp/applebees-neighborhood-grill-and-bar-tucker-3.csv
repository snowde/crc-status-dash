Cindy G.,"Tucker, GA",0,7,,2.0,11/12/2017,"Went here a few days ago with some friends to lunch.  I have been to this location many times. I know they are slow to serve food and the quality is only so so,  That said, they are the only ones open late in the area, and sometimes that is what is needed.  This is the first review I've done though. Arrived at lunchtime in a party of 8, many tables available.  Our orders were taken in a timely manner.  Food service time good as well. Maybe the fact that I told the waitress we needed to be out by a certain time helped.   Quality:  2 people had ordered a combo with soup, both had to return the soup because it wasn't hot.  One said it tasted more like a marinara sauce than a soup.  Two people (myself included) ordered the Thai shrimp salad.  Not really impressed, and wondering what part of the salad was classified as ""Thai"".    Was also supposed to be drizzled with peanut sauce, missing on both.  The person that ordered coffee said it was not very good.  And lastly, one person who ordered a sandwich/salad combo described their caesar salad as ""greasy, with too much dressing"". Server:  Friendly.  One minor thing, she attempted to take orders without writing anything down.  Now some can do that flawlessly.  She, however, came back to ask what someone ordered because she forgot.  Honestly, I don't know why servers even attempt it, people don't tip better because of it. Value:  None.  Everything is overpriced, especially when compared with quality. Applebees seems intent on driving customers away.  From this point forward definitely going to try avoiding them as much as possible."
Matthew P.,"Atlanta, GA",25,13,3,1.0,11/22/2017,"I've eaten at many different Applebee's in Georgia and around the southeast. The experience I had at this Applebee's was one of the worst. Start with walking in the door. We've arrived at the restaurant a little before 11 p.m. there were plenty of people there but we didn't see a single server. That should have been our first indicator to about face. Unfortunately, this area there's not a lot of late-night options so we decided to stick it out. Someone who seem like a manager came over and clean the table off for us but the floors under the table were disgusting. Again, planned to make the best of it. We placed our order with no notice the restaurant was out of anything. 10 minutes or more later the waitress returned to tell me they were completely out of steak of any size. They have 3 sizes on menu. Another 10 minutes later she returned to tell me that they did not have any thousand island dressing that and they did not carry it at the store. Meanwhile,  that dressing  had been listed off to me when I asked the waitress what dressings they had. I switched to a Caesar which took at least another 10 minutes to come out. When she brought out my salad she let my companion know that they had no bone-in wings so she also had to change her order as well. This is now 30 minutes or more after we placed our initial order!When the waitress brought out my salad I ordered the drink special Bahama Mama for $1. On the color poster it shows the drink in a beer mug. I was brought out a small 8 oz plastic cup. I complained, but was told that was the size they gave out. Any other Applebee's restaurants I have received the large size shown in the advertisement. When my ribs finally came out, half the order was cold. Also there were only 10 ribs(should be 12-13). The fire roasted vegetables that I had ordered were not only grilled instead of roasted but they included bell pepper which I wasn't notified of when I asked the waitress what that side included. I hate bell pepper.  We came in for a quick dinner and ended up being the restaurant for an hour and 40 minutes. With all the issues we had a manager never stopped by our table. I didn't bother to ask for one because given the state of the restaurant I don't imagine my feedback would have made any difference."
Margaret S.,"Norcross, GA",19,20,2,3.0,7/16/2017,"Went to Applebees in Tucker on 7/15/17 for late lunch. We got mozzarella sticks for appetizer. My husband ordered the Breakfast for Dinner burger & I had triple bacon burger. My husband enjoyed his burger & will definitely get again!  My burger was little too pink to start but got better as I ate. There are 2 crispy slices of bacon on the burger & there must be some bacon in ranch sauce because I could taste more bacon..don't know if I'll get again. We both liked our server, but neither of us can remember her name."
Bob K.,"Atlanta, GA",12,53,,1.0,1/4/2018,"Not what it used to be like the old Applebee's. Food was fair, service wasn't much better"
Kenya C.,"Decatur, GA",54,26,228,3.0,11/11/2017,"We came because Applebee's was giving free meals to the veterans for Veterans Day and we wished that we went somewhere else. When we walked in we were greeted by the hostess and she was cheerful. We didn't have to wait and were seated immediately. The waiter comes over and took our drink orders. Once he came back we went ahead and ordered our food. My dad ordered off of the special Veterans Day menu and me and my mom ordered the 2 for $25 special they had. My dad ordered a burger with no cheese and fries and when he got his order it was literally just the bun and the burger no lettuce, tomato or pickles. My mom ordered the half rack of ribs with broccoli and garlicky green beans with bacon. The half rack of ribs was barely a half rack and it was so small. And I ordered the grilled chicken  breast with bacon beer cheese topper with a side of fries and fire grilled veggies. The chicken extremely salty. I scraped the cheese off and it was still too salty. I didn't finish it. The fries were hot but it was little pieces of potatoes and not the long pieces. We also had BBQ boneless wings for the appetizer they were a little hard but they were the best thing that we ordered. I have been to Applebee's too many times to count and I never had any problems with the food that I ordered. I'm not going to give up on Applebee's but I won't be coming back to this one."
Mike W.,"Atlanta, GA",224,19,3,1.0,11/11/2017,"Bad service. Seems like they tell you whatever you order, that it will take a long time to deter you from staying. I would hate to be the owner of this establishment, because you will loose loads of money."
MaryBeth W.,"Atlanta, GA",3,33,34,3.0,5/9/2017,"My husband and I spent $67 here for 1 beer, 2 glasses of wine, 2 side salads, & 2 entrees. The food was mediocre. We most likely won't be back."
Carissa J.,"Atlanta, GA",87,122,87,1.0,5/24/2016,"I haven't been to Applebee's in years until now. And now I remember why I was never a fan.... On a quiet Friday afternoon a party of 4 of us arrived. Drinks came out promptly, and our server was quick to take our orders. Then things went downhill. The food took over 30 minutes to arrive. The burger was overcooked, the fries tasted like the frozen kind, and everything was super salty but bland at the same time. Nothing memorable in a good way at all. The check then took another 20 minutes to arrive.  Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else."
Aaron J.,"Norcross, GA",61,46,9,3.0,8/4/2016,"Okay it's Applebees people. There is not much to expect the food when I have gone is usually pretty good. No real exceptions here with this location. I would go possibly four stars but when we were there some DJ for ""karaoke"" night was there blasting music louder than it really could have been."
Laura H.,"Norcross, GA",6,21,36,1.0,4/5/2016,"terribe customer service, got the steak , asked for medium got a well done steak. Asked to exchange for it but the manager refused to, its the restaurant business and u cared about a damn steak and being cheap. just terrible customer service, they left us no refilled sweet tea after i complaint about the steak. Never set my foot in this place again, hope they got closed or shut down soon. Go to HELL"
MoMo S.,"Atlanta, GA",49,25,84,1.0,3/26/2016,Being the only guests in the restaurant I had to ask another server to get Meski to deliver our check. She was busy socializing with coworkers.
Katy K.,"Atlanta, GA",0,14,6,1.0,11/1/2016,"I usually don´t eat at chain restaurants but we went out with the office for halloween lunch yesterday, First off, our server was amazing. Extremely courteous and efficient! The reason why I am giving this place 1 star is because 3 of us had the grilled salmon and 2 of us are out sick today, with food poisoning. My stomach is not well at all, and if the other two wouldn´t be at home throwing up, I would leave the office right now, as well (but somebody has to be here). My verdict, don´t do it!"
Ashley A.,"Atlanta, GA",0,9,10,1.0,6/18/2016,"Worst Applebee's ever! I ordered carside to go, and they never brought the food to my car. I waited an additional 20 minutes before inquiring about my order.  The food was ready but of course it was cold. What's the point of having carside if you aren't going to bring it out to the car?"
Sheria R.,"Clarkston, GA",46,4,,2.0,8/12/2016,"Being that I have served and been a bartender I may be a little harsher than I should. This location in particular is in dire need of some really good and experienced FOH staff. There were a total of 20 empty tables, about 9 servers on the floor, and there was a 20 to 30 minute wait on a Saturday night....Really? The hostess seemed to be in her own world with no sense of urgency and no real desire to be there. I sat at the bar and was greeted within a decent time. The beverage I ordered was pretty good. The bartender was a very good bartender. The food however is where the issue was. Everything was very bland and took forever to come out. There weren't many people in the restaurant, not enough for the wait that I had. The servers were walking around like they weren't getting slammed. I wanted to grab an apron and take some tables."
Frank W.,"Atlanta, GA",2,100,11,1.0,6/10/2016,"Applebee's is already pretty bad in itself. This location is trying exceptionally hard to take a long time and charge quite a bit of money for mediocre food... That is, if you get around to order it..."
Bradley S.,"Saint Louis, MO",133,142,47,3.0,1/25/2016,Stopped for lunch with a colleague today.  Got the pick 2 with blt and tomato soup.   The soup and sandwich were both good.  Nothing super special about soup to put it over the top.  The sandwich had cheese on it.   Actually quite a bit of cheese.   Almost more like and grilled cheese with bacon.  While I like those I was more in mood for traditional blt.
Janita R.,"Loganville, GA",0,9,,1.0,1/16/2017,"If you like to hear management and employees arguing in the kitchen...This is the place for you!  Mid-way our meal, my daughter asked if she could sit in the car because she was not comfortable. I asked to speak to the manger. The manager stated that he took full responsibility for the chaos, told me that he was extremely unprofessional, told me his name (Ricky Byrd), and told me that I could call corporate if I liked....The food was actually really good but the ""free entertainment"" was unprofessional and unfortunate."
Diane C.,"Atlanta, GA",1,31,,1.0,2/20/2016,"This set the new bar for LOW.  The bar was piled up used plates and sticky bar.  The bartender could care less, and if she moved any slower I thought she would fall over.  Low rent restaurant."
Doe I.,"Decatur, GA",6,41,6,4.0,4/9/2016,The 2 for $20 isn't bad.  Just depends on when you go.  Our server was very attentive.
Ebony C.,"Alpharetta, GA",60,379,532,1.0,8/31/2013,"Went here to support a neighborhood establishment and watch the SEC football season opener this past week with my fave guy friends. They were at the bar and we had to move to a high top table, and the bartender Sarah H, gave us the most nasty attitude-ridden service I've ever experienced. She  took over 30 minutes to bring the check and told us that someone else would serve us. We then asked for the check to be split, and she never came back... literally.  No other waiter ever came to our table to take our orders, to give us silverware or even water--neither did Sarah. After sitting there like idiots for over an hour, my husband flagged down a DIFFERENT person to ask for the check from Sarah that we'd BEEN waiting on for about another 45 min at that point, and paid what he ran up at the bar before my arrival.  I'd never go back to this location, especially not to sit at the bar (my favorite thing to do at this Applebees) as long as she still works there. Totally unprofessional and uncalled for. My husband and his guy friends said she was being all flirty with them and then upon my arrival she turned into A NASTY LADY mode. Why act nasty bc I'm a female? What does have to do with the level of service you provide? She's sad and the service at a local place I've supported for 6 years is now TERRIBLE. management should be aware, that they are losing LOCAL repeat customers bc of their piss-poor staff. ... and NO the place was NOT busy nor was the bar full."
James D.,"Dekalb County, GA",0,10,1,2.0,12/14/2014,"The food was as expected, standard chain restaurant fare. It was cooked well and tastes good.  The wait staff, however, could use improvement. When we walked in, one waitress was fussing with the hostess over our choice of seating (we did not want to be near the kitchen/bathroom entrance).  Our waitress was inattentive, and my daughter found her  at one point in the restroom texting her babydaddy. I had to go to the bar to get my own beer after watching it sit there for 10 minutes, asked 4 times over 25 minutes for refill on unlimited item before getting it, had to actually get up and find the waitress by the cash register and pay there since she took her sweet time (she was talking on her phone) Verdict: food is good, service is terrible and I doubt that I will return to this restaurant."
Joseph V.,"Duluth, GA",0,2,1,1.0,3/19/2016,"Horrible service! I drove up to this location for a CARSIDE order! And was told I need to come inside to pickup my order! It's takes them 30 minutes to find my order and after several request with the lady on the phone; she finally decided to send someone outside with my orders! On top of that my credit card was charged twice! I would not recommend anyone at this location, especially for a CARSIDE orders!!! They will most like ask you to walk inside to pickup your order!"
Koya J.,"Norcross, GA",52,16,15,1.0,7/30/2015,First off DO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE! The music selection is chosen by their employees. They pick explicit music. It is so unprofessional! Their food was as expected. Dry and tasteless. Their servers are horrible. They seem like they are just here for a check. Meske is very blah and slow. The manager stated that she was one of their best waitresses. That mean that the other servers suck. We won't come back! EVER!
Serdrick C.,"Lilburn, GA",0,3,,1.0,7/24/2016,"Don't waste your time, money, or tastebuds at this dump. Poor service, dirty environment, and unappealing food."
William M.,"Maryville, TN",46,220,39,2.0,8/25/2014,"My Dad likes the double crunchy shrimp at Applebee's so my wife and I took him there for dinner. Dad enjoyed his shrimp. I wish my wife and I could say we enjoyed our food too. The whole experience was made worse by very poor service. I'll take Dad out for his shrimp again, but not to this place!"
Bryce F.,"Snellville, GA",86,1,,1.0,10/26/2015,"If I could give this 0 stars I would. Server refilled drinks once. She never checked on us, we had to ask the host to do our servers job. Do not go here unless you have 3 hours to waste waiting on food. Awful"
Ebby S.,"Columbia, SC",35,2,,1.0,11/22/2015,"so I am definitely persons that's knows reviews will make or break any establishment! My girlfriend and I decided we were going to have a late lunch so we decided to take the cheap route and go to you neighborhood Applebees. Well to make this short and sweet we waited an hour until our food came out then 45 mins after we sat there , we discovered they didn't have the enchiladas we ordered. Once the food finally arrived (1.25 hours later) it was burnt and the order was wrong. The only good thing about the wait was that the bartender was super sweet and did all she could to make us feel batter other then that it was the worst. One of the main reasons why DONT EAT at Applebee's!!!"
Tracy W.,"Atlanta, GA",57,62,11,1.0,6/4/2015,"Our waitress Isis was great and that's the only good thing about my visit to this location! I mean, who doesn't love Applebee's  right??? Well if you go to this one you may not ever go again!!!  The food looked like it was just thrown on the plate! So much for presentation you guys...the siracha shrimp was gross and I've had it at other Applebee's snd enjoyed it...the brisket nachos had very minimal meat on them.. Talk about a rip off and the double crunch wings were dried out and tough to chew...it looked like the cook just threw some sauce on old wings from lunch time...the meatballs were edible but highly doubt that they were homemade! My hubby had a steak with shrimp on top which he said was okay but his veggies were ice cold! We waited 20 mins just for dipping sauce..10ins for an ice tea refill and another 10 for our bill. The manager did speak to us and was apologetic..she gave us each a $5.00 coupon for a future visit...thank you! She should have taken that money off of our check right then..My appetite was ruined and when I'm spending 50 bucks on food it better be good! This place missed the mark horribly and we will take our hard earned money elsewhere!  If I were you, I'd skip this location completely!!! Horrible!!!"
Trace A.,"Norcross, GA",26,14,22,1.0,7/11/2015,Had the worst service ever ! I had to wait 15 minutes to get my drinks but got my food right away . There was no excuse for the drinks to take 15 MINUTES because the place was almost empty!!! Im a usual customer i come here almost every weekend and my service is never bad until today! I got my food but did not get any silverware. Never coming back again!!!!! Dont know what happened to this place
R B A.,"Atlanta, GA",1,5,,1.0,9/19/2015,"The food was as expected.  The service was horrible.  Part of our food came to the table.  We flagged down the server to get utensils.  Ten minutes later we got utensils, but no food.  Eventually the remainder of the  food arrives. We had to flag down the manager to get the check.  After waiting about 10 minutes I had to go to the bar to get someone the cash out the check.   The music was loud; the feel was more of a bar."
Sarah D.,"Lilburn, GA",0,8,,4.0,1/31/2016,"Went on a Thursday unaware that it was karoke night. Very entertaining and fun! Food was good, so was the service. The karoke night definitely made it more lively and would love to see it happen more."
Marvin B.,"Lilburn, GA",43,91,103,3.0,8/26/2013,Food was good but the service does lack. They are not attentive enough for me. I don't think I have unreasonable expectations but I do know good service when I get it or not.  Would return as a last option.
Christophe B.,"Tucker, GA",99,3,1,1.0,3/10/2016,Horrible Horrible service!!!  The waiter knew nothing about the menu. Food and drink wise!!!  Very slow!!!  Refilled my drink and said your foods ready but give me a minute to get an order to the table next to us. Makes their drinks and finally brings the food. Ordered a burger and I wanted it medium. It was still raw pretty much. Took it back and 3 minutes later it was over cooked all they did was re heat the patty and used the same buns and toppings with reminiscence of raw meat still on the bun!!!!  Fries were cold!!!  Sent it back and left!!!!  Horrible service. Manager hid in the back and didn't come out to speak.
Jennifer C.,"Norcross, GA",0,5,,1.0,12/22/2014,I went with my friends for dinner here and i can say i wasn't expecting to have an upset stomach for 2 WEEKS!!! Okay so the service was so impolite and rushed. One waitress dropped my food and took almost half an hour to bring another one. I ordered the Three cheese Chicken Penne. It  tasted a little unusual. A bit off. The waitress brought me a free brownie that must have been old. I would not reccomend this Applebees to anyone.
C R.,"Tucker, GA",0,6,2,1.0,6/26/2015,"It really pays to read reviews. We stopped in for late night salad option. We were standing to go after waiting 27 minutes at our table, with no service not even drinks. Our waitress apologized for the delaywhen shed saw us standing. Not wanting to drive and look yet again we decided to stay. Made our order. Inquired when ordering salad about dressings. Were told they only had ranch. Only. Ever. Ok.... Asked to have tomatoes removed. Cant do that. We left. 11 servers on the floor - total of 8 four tops 2 doubles and 3 people at the bar. And you only have ranch. Ever."
A.J. C.,"Atlanta, GA",160,454,38,3.0,1/3/2015,I used to go here for lunch with co-workers.  Pretty much your run-of-the-mill Applebee's.  You've seen one you've seen them all.  But I'm a fan.
Travis W.,"Tucker, GA",6,6,,1.0,12/25/2015,"The chicken was not cooked properly. Management/customer service sucks. Called corporate and they were also of little help. Will not visit another Applebee's anywhere, this place is so bad. I have not been there in a year and don't feel I have missed anything at all. Looking for Christmas lunch and saw the listing it pissed me off and made me write a review."
Jay C.,"Decatur, GA",112,15,1,2.0,2/19/2015,"One of the worst Applebee's ever!  They can not get an order right for anything and even if they do, it'll be cold or overcooked!  Steer clear ... You've been warned!"
Kendra K.,"Atlanta, GA",0,4,3,1.0,2/28/2016,"Last night I received the worst service that I have ever received in my life. From beginning to end the service was terrible. We went to Applebee's with a group of about eight people, it was around 11:45 at night so there weren't a lot of people in the restaurant. It took ten minutes for a host to even come to the front to put our names down on the list. Once they got us on the list  we were seated in about 15 minutes(not bad). Once we were seated our waiter came over within the first ten minutes (still not too bad) he brought us our drinks and took our orders, and then we didn't see or here from our waiter for another thirty minutes!!! We were thirsty and hungry so another waitress comes by and we ask her for refills on our drinks. Then our waiter finally comes back with some of our food. So everybody get their food EXCEPT for me. So while everybody else eats (including my three friends who came after me) I sit there and wait. My fiancé asks another waitress if she can check on my food because once again our waiter has disappeared into the abyss. Then our waiter finally comes back after another 30 minute absence and we ask him about my food and he says they're cooking it right now...So I waited another fifteen minutes for my food which was the Crispy Brewhouse Chicken. By the time my food came I had been waiting a total of 50 minutes! All the while everyone at my table is eating and begging other waitresses for refills because out waiter is nowhere to be found! This Applebee's has never had exceptional service, but we go there often because we know it's simple American style food that's inexpensive, but after last night I'm not sure we'll be going there anymore. Everyone in our party was pretty fed up and annoyed with the piss poor service that we received. I would not recommend you stop at this Applebee's, there are plenty of other restaurants in the area that you can go to and receive better service! Try the longhorn down the street!"
Lamb C.,"Plano, TX",45,9,,1.0,12/17/2014,Food Here was dry. I ordered Shrimp and Pasta Cap.... I prob. will not visit here again. Waitress was nice though. GM didn't want to make it right without charging extra. I say one star.
