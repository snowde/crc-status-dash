Annie K.,"Saint Louis, MO",49,100,83,1.0,4/27/2012,"The food is, alright. It's Applebees, so not much is expected. But the service, I give it 1 star only because I can not go with a - score.  As soon as I was seated, the waitress was on me asking of I was ready to order. I ordered an unsweet tea (I know, I do get odd looks in the South when I order tea that lacks sugar) and told her I'd told her I'd need a couple minutes for my food order. She did not return for almost 15 minutes with my drink. I ordered my food and it arrived 18 minutes later. The au jus and meat on my sandwich were barely warm. I ate my food, the waitress never returned to see how my food was or to refill my tea. When she did bring me a fresh tea, it was sweet, gag me southern sweet, no offense to those who enjoy sweet tea. She did not remove the dirty dishes from my table.  She, along with the several other members of the staff were to busy to wait on the whopping full house of 7 customers as they were busy playing and being rowdy at a table by bar, the horrendous rap music was quite load and some were dancing to or writhing in pain from it, or the food, not sure on that. But pained looks were on their faces.  As usual, I should have avoided the dreaded Applebee's and gone, instead to TGIFriday's. I never expect top shelf service from any Applebee's, but this was as low on the rung as you can go. Without competition for the worse service I have ever received at one of the restaurants  Heck, I had to go to the bar when my hunt for my waitress proved a fools journey. Of course, I was fool for staying past when my tea arrived in such a s-l-o-w manner."
The B.,"Stone Mountain, GA",0,3,,1.0,8/8/2016,"i worked here as a server for 2 weeks and quit.i shoulda read reviews first i would have never applied. first off the kitchen sucks they dont have professional expos they have servers who also expo and are shitty at their job.1 friday night the server/expo girl walked off in the beginning of her shift cuz she refused to wear gloves on the   a result at 11pm when i had a party of 6 in a less than 30 percent filled restaurant it took 45 mins for their food to come out . the very next thursday same thing happens with the other server/expo girl who got flustered in a non. busy dinner rush and yelled loudly at servers asking about their partys   is so concerned with labor costs they send cooks home and keep the bare minimum on the line.half the servers there brag about coming to work stoned 1 of wich is the same shitty expo/server that fucked up on Thursday. by the way neither of them were fired for what they did wich made me lose respect for the management. i work a day job so i was part time nights and weekends and everyday i had to apologize for food taking long.i never saw the place on a wait on the weekends and after reading all these im never coming back reviews now i know why.ive worked in high end restaurants b4 like rays on the river and this Applebee's is beneath my skills as a waiter,i applied cuz its 10 mins from my house.nobody wants to be there 1 of the managers openly talks how she is applying at other restaurants waiting for interviews. and last but not least im an African American myself so i can say this BLACK PPL NEED TO LEARN HOW TO TIP!leaving 5 bucks on a 83 bill is unacceptable! leaving 1.84 for a tip so u can spend an even 35 is unacceptable! and these are the times when i was tipped there were at least 5 times when i wasn't tipped at all!1 table left me 57 on a 57.88 tab!of course i know its not all blk ppl like this i had a table of 2 black women that left me 10 on 30 another 4 top left me 20 on 103.00 so its not everyone but dam!i say this to let u know thats half the reason some of u complain about sitting at tables or host stands for 20 mins and servers ignoring u. its cuz its embedded in our brains that your not gonna tip or leave shitty   a result your probably gonna get shitty service. so in closing to ppl of all races if your not prepared to tip 15 percent or more for good service please stay your ass at home or get your food to go cuz servers make 2.13 an hour plus tips.anyone offended by this review its obviously cuz the shoe fits."
Denie K.,"Smyrna, GA",19,23,11,1.0,4/2/2014,"Honestly the slowest service I have ever had. I wish I video taped the server walking in a snail's pace. The first server gave us waters and apparently decided to not come back. We ended up getting another server and she was not any better. We were there for our lunch break. Restaurants should understand that we don't have two hours to eat lunch. The server asked me what I was drinking, and I told her coke. I never got a refill. Management was just sitting at one of the tables doing paperwork. It would have been great to have a manager ask us how we were doing so we could have said horrible. We had to ask a different server to get our server so we could get checks. Don't waste your time here."
Dom P.,"Lilburn, GA",0,9,,1.0,8/15/2012,"This place was good maybe pre-2010, every time we have gone here afterwards was a disaster. The last time me and my family were here, our waitress had seated us and said ""I'll be with you in a minute"" which is normal, it happens, but she didn't return for another 20 minutes, mind you the place wasn't crowded at all, instead we just sat there with nothing on the table for 20 minutes, and where was our waitress? busy talking to the couple 2 booths behind us about hair or something. I assumed that the people she was waiting on had started the convo, but at some point you have to disconnect from them.  So once we actually got our drinks and ordered our food, the drinks (including the sprite) had zero taste, the chips from the artichoke dip had little taste, the food was so gross, I had the philly cheesesteak sandwich and it look like it had been sat on, all happening in between the times the waitress is still being held up by those people behind us trying to hold a conversation. Long story short, we were there for two and a half hours basically wating on service, food, and drinks that tasted bad, our waitress even talks trash about the new cook (which makes the situation worse, not better hun) and the manager had to take my sandwich away because of the travesty of the look and taste. I will never come here again."
Scott S.,"Tucker, GA",0,3,,1.0,3/24/2014,As per most of the other reviews... Yes... they are slow as humanly possible..without actually standing still.  The food is ok.  But having to wait for 10 15 minutes when there are only a handful of occupied tables..  Moronic.    It would seem the management is here ONLY to see this ship sink.  And if there were other restaurants to visit... this ship would have sunk a LONG time ago.
Christina K.,"Atlanta, GA",139,490,237,2.0,10/7/2011,"Came here last night @ 9:30 and the place was dead. The lighting was so dim you could barely see the whole restaurant. When we arrived, there was a large group waiting to be seated and the host was walking slow... like, molasses, but slower!! This really irks me as I have worked in several restaurants and wanted to so bad to pull him aside and light a fire under his butt! We finally get seated and about 15 minutes later our waitress shows up. She was nice enough and prompt with the food and refills, but the 15 min wait just added to my frustration. We finally order and our food comes out. We actually enjoyed the food quality, although my SO's pasta dish was drowned in sauce and the noodle was not cooked through as I would have liked to I sticked to my own dinner instead of eating off of his like I usually do! I would have given this location a better mark if the host and waitress were more prompt, but if you don't mind waiting then its an ok place."
Chris M.,"Tucker, GA",1,16,,1.0,4/4/2011,"My wife and I live in the Clarkston/Tucker area. We had some friends staying with us over the weekend. On Sunday we decided to go into  Tucker and eat at the Applebee's.  We were seated and our orders taken. The restaurant wasn't busy and yet an hour passes and we still don't have any food. The waitress keeps telling us ""Your order is coming up"" but it never does. We finally have enough and decide to go somewhere else. We want to do the right thing, so we tell the waitress to cancel our order but to ring us up for our drinks. She refuses to do it saying ""Your order is waiting I just have to go get it."" She disappears in the back for 15 minutes then reappears with the manager and our orders. It's obvious to us they hadn't made our food and this disappearing act was them trying to rush cook it so we would stay.  When the manager gets to the table we tell him whats happened and that we would just like to be rung up for our drinks so we can leave. The manager proceeds to yell at us for ordering the food and not paying for it. We tell him how we had already informed the waitress of this 15-20 minutes ago after not receiving food for an hour. We go back and forth for about another 5 minutes before he finally tells the waitress to ring us up for our drinks so we will shut up and get out of his face. This really pissed me off. Afterall, we tried to do the right thing and pay for our drinks. We could have just walked out. Tucker is where we go for all of our shopping and dining. We eat at the Applebee's frequently. After this experience however, we will not be going back there anymore.  It's one thing to have a bad food experience. Sometimes things just don't go right in the kitchen, tickets, get lost or whatever. But to be yelled at by the manager, who obviously doesn't care about his customers is just unacceptable!"
Andres J.,"Atlanta, GA",0,3,,1.0,10/6/2013,"The service was OK, food less than OK but the worst thing about it was the filthiness of the place, the tables were dirty, bathrooms not to mention, silverware was not properly washed. I will never be back to such restaurant."
Glen B.,"Waycross, GA",5,8,80,2.0,9/9/2013,Food is marginal to bad across the chain. I would never come back to Applebees if it were not cheap beer and a decent place to watch a game. This place specifically was par. Staff ok. Recommend apps and drinks...
Yen H.,"Norcross, GA",0,1,,1.0,11/30/2014,Came on a Sunday afternoon with my nephews. Food was horrible. Server was nice but absentminded. The place was not even half full and they were out of utensils. Unprofessional.
Dwayne B.,"Atlanta, GA",16,8,1,1.0,10/18/2015,"The worst service I ever received in Atlanta.  The wait to be seated was unnecessary seeing that no one was there.  Once seated, we were brought our appetizer without silverware or napkins.  When the server brought the silverware, it was rolled up in a used napkin and it was dirty.  The napkins had food droppings on them as well.  At this point, I was ready to go.   After speaking to the manager and asking for the check....could not endure the rest of the experience, he charged me full price for the 2 for  $25 appetizer and never returned to the table.  I asked to speak to the general manager Angelina Ratcliff who was,working the grill and  would not avail herself to allow me to voice my concerns.  The restaurant is extremely dirty and you should see their score that is extremely low in my book for an establishment allowed to keep their doors open.  I would advise anyone not to eat there and get sick on top of receiving sub-standard service.  I will be reaching out  Bob Calder head, who is Angelina's manager to see if he cares about this location and the service they are offering to hard working individuals."
David V.,"Lawrenceville, GA",19,21,1,1.0,1/14/2012,"Wish I could do no stars. The chips were soaked in grease. When I bit into them oil literally squirted out of them. The waiter said ill get you another coke, then he went and was talking with his buddy for about 10 minutes before bringing me a soda. My friend sat with an empty drink for about ten minutes and was not offered a refill. The food was bad the service was worse. This is not my first time having a bad experience at this location. It will be my last time."
Tenecia G.,"Atlanta, GA",0,1,,1.0,10/21/2014,"I have been to this Applebee's on numerous of occasions. Today was the worst experience I have ever had here.  My Bahama Mama was nothing but alcohol, my food was ok but when it comes down to my server the customer service that she presented was very horrible. It took 35 minutes to recieve food and drinks.. We never received drink refills or anything.  We was on lunch break and for it to be very slow in the restaurant the service was slow as well. As we was leaving I finally saw a manager that was coming in.  Thanks Mr. Travis for all that you do. The server that we had was Ajanee..."
C K.,"Ellijay, GA",2,46,,2.0,12/29/2011,"Well, the thing is, Tucker simply has no other options for going out (local 7 now but eh reviews are bad for it) and having a drink and some pub food so Applebee's is first choice.  However, there are always the same old faces sitting at the bar!  Sad faces sipping beer since 6pm, I guess with nothing else to do. I popped in recently, early December and ordered a Manhattan Martini.  No bitters?  In a bar? I asked for extra cherries, he had to go in the back to find them. No napkins on the bar?  I had to ask for napkins and when I clearly had drenched mine in cherry  juice no offer for more.   Noticed football on EVERY television.  Asked why football was on on Thursdays...new to me, bartendar looked at me like I'd asked him a stupid question.  Thursday football ""is kinda've new"" he said.  Then why did you look at me like I was from outter space? No bitters, no napkins and inadequate customer serivce. Are you hard up Applebees?  Couldn't finish my drink any faster to get out of the sad sack bar."
Viscilly C.,"Duluth, GA",0,3,,1.0,10/17/2015,"Never ever break down and eat here! First of all we were the only three people in the restaurant.Second we got to hear all the front of house staff talk about how wasted they all were the a few hours ago and how they cant believe that they actually made it in to work in voices so loud that they overcame the music playing in the restaurant. And finally the piece de    resitance was when we finally got our food after forever our salads were dropped off in a very hast fashion with our waitress running away to the void leaving myself with a half container of the wrong dressing, i ordered ranch and was served blue cheese, and my friend needing more salad dressing too. We stared for 15 at the social club of the employees gathered around on their phones talking and yelling about their previous drugged out adventures. I had to finally find a manager to get us the right dressing and more of it. She didn't handle it very well, and after the sever came back it was hell to pay. She slammed our plates on the table shoving it across the table. My friend had ordered her favorite dish off the two for twenty menu she got it and it looked like the rice was paste and she said it tasted off and couldn't eat it. Then our server was showing a trainee how to work the tablet at the end of the table she stomped over to our table while we were eating  and stood at our table over us at the end of our table and did her training. not once even acknowledging our even existance then slamming the tablet on the table before walking off. Keep in mind every table has these and we were the only people in the section. I've had better service at a Mcdonald's and better food :/ I will be calling the corporate office in a few days because they are closed till monday."
Jeremy D.,"Norcross, GA",0,3,,1.0,7/3/2014,"Ate lunch there yesterday, the food was good! the service is one star at best! Reminded me why I don't go to this restaurant, longhorn is close by and they are much better!"
Mo G.,"Lawrenceville, GA",3,8,,1.0,1/28/2012,"So I came to this Applebee's (4353 Lawrenceville Hwy, Tucker Ga)on 1/27/12 with a friend to unwind and have a good time. I have been to many different Applebee's in the past with no issues whatsoever. I ordered a ""Mucho Mama"" (alcoholic beverage), and to my disappointment, the drink did not deliver. I did not taste a hint of alcohol. It tasted as though someone just mixed orange juice with cranberry. At this point, I got Gabrielle's (server) attention and explained to her that I was unsatisfied with the drink. She then informed me she would have to contact her manager before removing the drink from the table. That was no issue - the issue arrived once the manager arrived, Jarrett. I have never in my life experienced the lack of professionalism in a restaurant from a ""manager"" as I did tonight! He comes to the table looking uninterested as he asks ""How may I help you?"" No smile on his face. I then informed him that I did not like the drink at all (mind you, I had only taken a sip from it). He then tells me that ""I can take the drink from the table, but you will still have to pay for it."" At this point, I am looking at him in shock. I follow up with ""So you're telling me that if I don't like something that I did not drink, I still have to pay?"" His response - ""Yes"". I follow this up with ""So you're telling me if I didn't like this food, I would still have to pay?"" His response - ""Yes."" At this stage, I am livid. I am in disbelief at his tone, and his nonchalant attitude in not making the customer happy! Not once did he apologize, nor offer me an alternative option to try another drink. I wouldn't have wanted another option anyway, but just knowing the proper protocol of how managers usually handles situation of such put me in an uncomfortable situation dealing with him since he did the total opposite. I have been to many Applebee's before and in the past requested for an item to be taken from my bill due to dissatisfaction. Not once was I ever told NO. Clearly he could see how unhappy I was with what just transpired, because at this point, I asked for his boss's information. He gave me the business card for Alex, who is the general manager. Guess what? Not only did he just walk away after giving me the card, he didn't give a damn! Before my friend and I left, we requested to see this Jarrett character again. He came back to the table and my friend voiced her disappointment in the establishment and his attitude/approach. He then had the audacity to ask what could he have done to make himself more approachable to the situation -- Really? Our SERVER had compassion and empathy for my feelings, while the MANAGER had none! Jarrett then tries to explain himself ""My BOSS has told me to not take anything off of a bill due to the costs that were included in making it. It is a tough job to tell customers, but it's what my boss has asked for. Its products that are used and that is money."" I could have laughed in his face at this comment. Is he serious? If Applebee's has bosses that are telling their managers to run their business as such, you will have NO CUSTOMERS. I cannot believe that a boss would inform the manager to pretty much forget the customer's feelings and only worry about making money. You luck out on making money from that customer in the end because they will never go back to your establishment. So before he left the table, he let us know that he was ""Sorry we didn't enjoy ourselves."" You can imagine what I wanted to say to him but I refrained. I am appalled and disguisted. In the end, Gabrielle apologized and I asked her if this was the usual protocol - the manager refusing to take items off the check for unsatisfied customers. She said it's at the manager's discretion & they usually ask the bartenders if the drink was made right. Umm excuse me? I don't care if the bartender is asked how they made the drink - I care about how it tastes to me! A bartender is not perfect! Also, what may taste good to one person, may not taste good to the next. I am upset at this visit to a T. I had to pay for something I never drank, nor liked, all while feeling unimportant to the Applebee's franchise as though I wasn't a valued customer. I wasted my time even stepping foot in this Applebee's. Does the customer matter at Applebee's? That is the question that has been on my mind after this horrible visit. I have never been to a restaurant to where they refused to take an item off the bill, and not even offer another option from the menu. I wasn't given a choice at all. I will tell people to steer clear of this Applebee's!! The manager should be replaced! This is unacceptable!!"
Jonathan R.,"Norcross, GA",0,2,,1.0,11/16/2013,"was and will forever be the last time i eat at any applebees as long as i live. i went to take my friend for a dinner well first off he ordered his steak with peppers and onions well it came back with mushrooms, he's allergic sent that back , came back burnt on one end and rubbery on the other since mine was free or so we thought his was knocked off the bill yet was still 22.63 your manager that works at the one in tucker, georgia mr. greg has some mf'n nerve i am in college my third year for criminal justice he and his employees rushed out to get my tag number to call the police i paid the bill even if it wasn't worth what i paid he had no absolute reason to do that if he was professional he would have asked his employee that served us if the bill had been paid. some nerve i've never been so embarrassed  in my life. sit there for 90 minutes waiting on food that was not worth what you charge he does not need to be a manager if that is how he does business and i hope he wears gloves if he cooks he had bruises or something on his hands good day and have mercy on your customers"
Susan W.,"Panama City Beach, FL",0,8,,1.0,11/10/2012,"I took my 84 year old father out to dinner tonight and was thoroughly disgusted to find silverfish in our house salads.  I made a server aware of the problem and showed her the live bug in my salad and she took the plate away.  I thought the manager would be over but he walked right by our table to stand at the hostess station and never made an attempt to speak with us.  After a couple of minutes of watching this manager conversing with employees/patrons we decided to leave since he was not interested in addressing this situation.  As we were leaving I stopped and told him that I had the live bug in my salad and his comment was ""oh a water bug"" like that is acceptable.  I told him it was no water bug but a silverfish.  I WILL NEVER EAT AT APPLEBEE'S AGAIN!!!!!!!    To Tucker Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar Management:  You need to fire this manager if this is the way he handles a situation with bugs being found in your food.  The kitchen staff needs to be held to a strict standard of kitchen operations and if they can't be competent enough not to put food out with live bugs in it then you need to fire them."
