Dianne S.,"Los Angeles, CA",228,37,59,3.0,10/19/2017,"I went to go eat here last night and the food was pretty good! It's really a hit or miss here with the food. There were many a nights I would get off work late and come eat at an Applebee's while having a beer. The food here is usually not that great or would fetch a long wait time, but yesterday the food came out rather nicely.  Would I eat here for lunch or dinner? No. However, they offer good happy hour and late night specials. I will definitely come back if I ever need to munch on something late at night."
Bahareh S.,"Tucson, AZ",0,3,,1.0,1/9/2018,Not very clean. The bartender cleaned my margarita glass with a napkin that he dipped in the wash towel bucket!!!!
Tiffany M.,"Tucson, AZ",78,116,64,3.0,11/14/2016,"I don't typically enjoy chains, but picked Applebees to satiate a recent craving I had.  I went with my boyfriend and tried the dinner for two option, which gave us an appetizer and two entrees for $20, but we upped it to the $25 special. Our entrees: The Bourbon Chicken and Shrimp and the newer Butcher's Meat and Potatoes.  The Bourbon Chicken was fantastic. Chicken was a little stringy, but the chicken atop a garlic butter with shrimp and mushrooms was everything I wanted and more at the time. I can't deny that there are likely fancier and better places to go, but have to say that I was downright surprised by how much I enjoyed this dish. I will likely be ordering this again.  The Butcher's Meat and Potatoes was worth a shot. I had actually been craving something similar that you would find at an Irish bar, but Tucson has its limits with some ethnic foods. I enjoyed the chunks of meat and gravy, and was a bit overwhelmed with the amount of potatoes on my plate.  Not half bad though, Applebees."
Geraldine G.,"Tucson, AZ",0,1,,1.0,11/22/2017,"I thought this Applesbee was the best....but i was wrong. Me and my daughter get here and I asked if we could sit at the booth in the bar area. The manager Scott replied ""Lets go this way."" I thought he was going to take us around,  but then put us by the window which I am not comfortable with. So I asked him again if we could sit at the empty both by the bar and Scott replied..""well its not in rotation so if u don't mind sitting here that would be great. So we sat. Within a few minutes a group of 4 came in and Scott sat them in a booth in the bar area. Then a moment after that a couple came in and Scott Sat them in the booth I had requested???? Hmmmmmm? Talk about customer service or was it something else??? Anyways, we paid for our 1 Arnold Palmer ($2.81) Gave our waitress a $5 and left...telling her it was not her fault. Funny how Scott the manager held the door for us asking if everything was ok? At first I said ""No""...then said ""I had ask for that same booth and u sat us somewhere else"". Well I work with patients, guests, and people all day..something very small can make a big impression and ruin it!! Scott you ruined it for us. I will not go back, instead will travel to Grant and Swan or Oro Valley where I know I'll get great customer service.  I GIVE 1 star because the waitress was nice!"
Troy H.,"Tucson, AZ",112,183,81,4.0,3/25/2017,"Came in today after a long trek up to Mesa to get my motorcycle from the shop. I was super hungry and was craving some chicken strips. So we came in and we immediately sat. The experience started off a little rough, with no one coming to get our drink order for about 10-15 min. Then Ming (I believe that was her name) showed up and she made things better right away. You could tell she was running around dealing with other tables, but she was always happy and upbeat. She even helped my mother save money on her meal since it qualified. She could have just let her pay more, but she didn't so that was great. She never let out drinks go down and our food was great. If you go yo this location, make sure to ask for her. The meal was awesome!"
Drew P.,"Tucson, AZ",52,225,225,2.0,5/11/2017,"We went in this location this morning at 12:15AM and it was a bit frastraiting. We sit down and it's another 10 minutes before someone greets table. It wasn't to offer option however to inform the table they wouldn't be allowing alcohol to be served to our table. It was my fiancée's Birthday and he was clearly intoxicated, however 3 of the 5 of us haven't had anything to drink the entire night further none of us planned to order a drink.  So, then it's another 5 minutes for the waitress to arrive and her first words were that the restaurant closes at 1am. We thought it closed at 2am and she informed me several months back they changed to 1am. So, the table places the order and about 5 minutes later the waitress arvives they didn't have the cheeses Al gratin type potatoes I ordered ran out a few days ago. So, she said they could do mash with cheese, I agree. Well, when my steak arrives it's clear it's not a 12oz and I ask and come to find out since the steak I ordered is from the butchers cut they ran out of 12oz and they subbed it for a 8oz. lol The sides were just ok. One of the other plates the scrimp was rubbery and the appetizer  we ordered of spinach dip was served in a a small bowl the same that's given with the appetizer combo which was ordered  as well by my fiancee as his meal. Which im assuming was because it was close to closing and they didn't want to make the extra. Then when the bill came they charged me for the subbing of the side and no discount for smaller steak. Well, then the management started doing something I consider very rude they turned off the TV I was watching when the clock hit 1am and followed by turning off the music (which as we were walking out they turned back on). Which since our plates arrived just minutes prior to 1am is very rude. If they don't want to serve near closing they should have a closing time and a posted time like many other buissness that states last table to be seated is a hour prior to closing. The only reason they are getting two stars and not one is aside from the waitresses faliures she was very nice and my steak tempture was close to medium rare which from experience is very difficult for apple bees."
Lana T.,"Tucson, AZ",2,88,27,1.0,6/18/2017,I never had a good experience at apple bees and when I forget and go back I am reminded again why I shouldn't come back.   The food was below avg.  S served cold. And my chicken on my chicken salad was raw on the inside last time I went there.   Seriously if like to live after my dinner.    Food for the others was below avg....
Brandon A.,"Tucson, AZ",72,36,78,3.0,9/25/2016,Me and my girlfriend decided to do something different so we came to Apple Bees for dinner. We chose the 2 for $25 the buffalo wings are very tasty and for an appetizer the serving was generous. I did end up going with the half rack of baby back ribs but the BBQ sauce used was not satisfying. To end the night with dessert we picked the brownie ice cream. Perfect amount for a couple to share. The service was great and friendly staff.
Kat S.,"Phoenix, AZ",36,95,2,1.0,6/21/2016,"After a full day of driving and being touristy we stopped at Mimi's for a quick dinner before we headed home. Quick did not happen. The hostess was busy talking to her co-worker, did not care that I was speaking to her, she rolled her eyes and sat us in the very back of the establishment. We then waited, and waited, and waited for someone to take our drink order. It was 112 out...I wanted a drink, badly. We waited for 15 minutes for this to happen. Our server came back with drinks and asked if we needed more time. I said no, and she looked irritated. She took our order and said she would bring a bread basket. We then waited and waited and waited for the bread. Another 15 minutes goes by and we now have bread.  Fast forward another 20 minutes and we have the food that was ordered! The meat was undercooked and cold in the center, the fish was overcooked and crunchy. The server came back about 10 minutes in and asked how the food was, and I told her exactly how it was. She apologized and walked away. It then took an additional 15 minutes to get our check. This place was not busy, there were maybe 12 people in the whole restaurant. We never got to speak to a manager and clearly the staff gave 0. This place sucks. Unless, you want to waste 2 hours of your life being hungry and thirsty, I would not recommend this place."
A B.,"Tucson, AZ",0,16,3,2.0,2/4/2017,"This is really just a review of their takeout. Applebee's puts zero effort into their takeout service. This is true not just of this location, but several locations across the country where I've gotten takeout. I tried this location anyway, and they did a pretty good job with my burger, which is why they get 2 stars, but their idea of french onion soup is so laughable I can only describe it with a picture. Under the bowl of cheese was a large crouton."
Derek W.,"Lakewood, CA",372,167,1291,5.0,3/24/2015,"I visited this Applebee's on the northwest corner of 1st and Wetmore a couple times during the summer of 2012. Both times, I went with their pick n pair lunch combos. Basically, you picked a entree, and with it, you get unlimited soups or salads. Soups OR salads? What about soups AND salads? Well my second time there, I was served by a server named Heather. She was great! I asked her if I was allowed to go for both soups and salads with a pick n pair, and she allowed me to do it! Unfortunately, it was almost three years ago since I ate there, so I can't comment on the exact details of all the soups and salads there, but they were all pretty good! They had a couple of soups and eight salads to choose from. I thought there should have been more, but I was able to eat about half of all of their selections (minus the entrees, of course) in one lunch and ate the other half of their selections for my other lunch. And the service (outside of Heather) was pretty good too! I barely waited at all before I was seated, and they treated me good despite the fact that I ate by myself both times. It was the first time (or first two times I should say) I had ever eaten at an Applebee's, and it surely won't be the last!"
Chris F.,"Tucson, AZ",0,67,2,1.0,11/16/2016,"When I went to walk in I had to wait in between the doors because two parties had entered but had been waiting for a hostess actually when I opened the door they were calling out for her. Eventually she came and seated the first party and then back for the next. The bartender called out that I can sit at the bar but I told him I wanted a booth. When the hostess came back she said ""you can sit at the bar"". I told her I would like a booth as those high chairs hurt my leg, this overwhelmed her. There were endless booths but they had everybody on one side all grouped together. She said she would have to, find the manager and get permission for me to sit in a booth when I said ok the expression on her face was not good... I told screw it I just have to deal with a high pub table. Her face then went back to a smile as she won, she got her way and the customer did not get his. The bartender is the waiter too and when he finishes talking the drunks at the bar he gets to you. I got a glass of water and when I ordered I asked for a really rare steak, no potatoes and steamed broccoli instead. Keep in mind I am there 20 plus minutes before I order. He came by and said medium rare right... I said NO REALLY RARE.... After a while on a skillet that is sizzling here comes the steak and potatoes... Yep not writing anything down so he forgot the deviations in my order.  He says let me replace this and comes back out of the kitchen in less than 2 minutes so I know the broccoli is not steamed properly... I try to cut it with the fork and I need a knife to cut the ""steamed"" broccoli... I said I think I should just leave and the server said ""OK"" so I start to get up to leave and the elusive Manager was over by the bar and heard me telling the server that this was a joke. The manager looks over, does not come over and the waiter says he is unhappy with the broccoli.... I said why don't you start from the beginning with  all the problems and he doesn't. I say screw it I will just pay my bill and leave as I saw that the so called manager was not going to waste his breathe or energy to come see why some one was walking out of his store. I paid the $16 check and only had a 1/4 cup of water and walked out because of the total incompetency of each and every employee there starting with the manager... This is corporate American at its best... Not worried about anything but the money... No service, no training, no pads and pens to write orders on and a chef that thinks broccoli steams in seconds. If you go to the corporate site of Applebee's you will see that this is business as usual. Embarrassing ratings at their home site and every other review site. FYI: they did say you don't have to pay but the manager didn't look onboard with the waiter saying that so I swiped my card and paid to ensure I do not patronize them again."
Tiffany B.,"Tucson, AZ",30,118,25,5.0,9/11/2016,"Don't understand the low ratings for this location. It's an Applebee's. I've been coming here quite a bit lately. Sadly, Tucson has not had the ""go to"" place that I've experienced living all over the United States. This is the only place I regularly go to! It's not always perfect. I stick to the happy hour and the bartenders JR and Christine are great!"
Halley K.,"Tucson, AZ",7,41,9,1.0,7/14/2016,Slow slowww service . brought out one plate and waited another 5-10 minutes for the rest of our food. Didn't refill out drinks or take the appetizer stuff out of the way. Manager walked by and looked concerned and decided to refill our drinks.
Gloria V.,"West University, Tucson, AZ",166,40,88,4.0,1/24/2015,"Service-beyond excellent service at this location. The kindness is extended in every mannerism of each worker (clearly working for tips,almost so much that it's insincere and annoying but hey whatever, you do you) my waiter was Chris, he rocked. Also Angel seemed to be new but he rocked too. Mega rocking going on in here.  Food quality -I got the cowboy burger and asked for no pink! But I got pink in my burger which still tasted fantastic but I just thought I should throw that out there. The Frys were over seasoned, I can feel the sodium levels in my body rising as I type this. Also, the oilfrom this burger dripped so extensively it took me 5 napkins just to continue soaking up, someone call the medics! But still delish and that's what matters here right!?  Overall, it's the closest Applebees to me so I myself here in the future of course. There was a guy there with a mustache that was about a foot long and part of it curled upwards all the way beneath his eyes! Like a pirate but much less cool, I've nothing against mustaches but that was a little excessive and distasteful for me. Gotta be glad he wasn't our waiter, whew! Watch out for him and you'll have a four star experience :)"
Tiffany S.,"Tucson, AZ",641,277,665,3.0,9/15/2014,"Stopped in after Sunday church for a nice quick lunch early dinner with the family since there were nine of us took a moment to be seated, i'm being seated we had a wonderful waitress that came over she was nice and friendly and even joke around with the family, reason for the three stars is mainly because we have been waiting staff the food was okay not the best I've had better from Applebee's. I was going to try the new chicken Chibatta but thanks to the waitress she gave me an idea until me is a little dry so I'm glad that I passed on it, I drinks were nice we all had a Bahama mama and a few shots overall it was okay experience."
Shawna B.,"Tucson, AZ",1,11,6,2.0,8/4/2016,"I received an Applebee's gift card for my birthday in July so I've been to this establishment twice in the past month.  The first time I came here was on my birthday and I ordered online. When I came in the Carside to Go entrance I waited next to the register for 10 mins. Five waitresses walked by me and not one of them asked me if I needed help. There was one waitress who was having a lengthy conversation with an older man waiting for his Carside to Go food 5 feet away from me and she was blatantly ignoring me. After I'd waited 10 mins and been ignored, I walked back into the kitchen and asked her if my order was ready. She handed me my food and I paid and left. I wasn't rude. I didnt say anything to her. I try to think the best of people and figured they were probably just having an off night. I even left her a $3 tip which I probably shouldn't have because I've just read more reviews about the terrible service. Also, when I got the food home it sucked. I ordered a steak medium well that was rare/ very chewy and I'd ordered grilled vegetables on the side and what I got was a few small broccoli florets with no flavor. But what am I supposed to do? Tell my dad to stop sending me Applebee's giftcards? I don't think it's nice to tell people you don't like a present they've given you. So anyway I ordered to go again today and the service was good. My waitress was nice and gave me a couple discounts which was cool. But again, the food sucked. My steak was rare/ chewy instead of medium well and tender, the vegetables had no flavor, the mac n cheese was dry.  Wth?!  I remember Applebee's having good food once upon a time.  Is it my imagination?  Also, the menu sucks now. Bring back the old menu with the fajitas and Bourbon street steak."
Richard G.,"Tucson, AZ",31,11,7,2.0,9/14/2016,I have never had bad service or meal.  But the food is far from fresh. Everything I'm sure is ready to heat and serve no need for a real cook.
Tim L.,"Tyndall AFB, FL",0,18,,1.0,4/10/2016,"Service sucks, and food sucks. I asked what sides there were and the waitress replied ""what do you mean?"" We ate an appetizer and immediately my stomach started hurting. Wait for it...and there's a big coarse black hair in the white pasta!!! That means the kitchen isn't clean or there is improper food practices. They need to be inspected."
Eric S.,"Tucson, AZ",72,3,1,2.0,1/10/2017,"Ordered wings and 4 were not cooked so I didnt eat them. I told the waiter and nothing. No sorry , no offer to replace them, no deduction on my bill...nada.  I cannot recommend this location."
Stephen C.,"Tucson, AZ",3,65,1,1.0,4/18/2015,"Stopped by this Applebee's at 3:20 on Friday, 4/17/15. Not crowded at all. Seated quickly. After about 10-15 minutes, we noticed a couple sitting close to us leaving and saying nobody ever came to their table. Nobody had stopped at our table either. Looked like only 1 server in the place. Another table was sending their meal back because they said it was not even done. As we sat there waiting for service, we noticed a family of 4 looking like they were pissed. They had been waiting for a long time also. They were talking about how long everything was taking. Needless to say we wern't about to sit any longer and spend our money in a restaurant that had poor service and serving crappy food. After about 25-30 minutes we got up and left along with another table. No manager in sight.  As we were leaving, we noticed staff in the back of the business, standing outside the back door, smoking and looking like they were just hanging out, while people are leaving. No wonder Applebee's is struggling to survive. Management doesn't care or oversee staff.  They lost about 6 people within just the 30 minutes I was there. I'll bet  this place will be closing its doors in the next year. It has really gone down."
Deana Z.,"Santa Fe, NM",0,24,1,1.0,3/1/2016,"Our waiter was very friendly, yet overly busy, so we had drinks continuously run out. The food was not fresh, and the ribs were overcooked. We would never return to this location again."
Tucson S.,"Heber, AZ",26,33,24,2.0,4/11/2016,"I must say the service here at this particular restaurant is iffy. The hostess always seems confused a little bit , servers did a good job, bartender didn't know how to make specialty  drink with more than 4 ingredients... and as for managment...appeared to be to 3 or 4 on the floor,... being that  party that I was with has pigment coloration different from a lighter shade... which field most of the restaurant on my evening not one of the three or four floor managers approached the table to ask how everything was but clearly approached every other table around us. I don't know I could have just been me that I was very tired but other people at my table also noticed. When you go to Red Lobster,  doesn't seem to matter, at all-- the management is always on pointe with every individual table regardless if they're super busy or not they always ask how your dinner is they even kind of overdo it just a tad but you don't mind it because you could tell that they're genuine Only gave three stars because of the food items spinach artichoke dip perfect the quesadillas those new ones on the menu those are also quite delicious and the server was so good it wasn't for them I would get one star"
Jackie H.,"Pahrump, NV",29,149,14,4.0,4/9/2016,Jeff our waiter was awesome.   Food was good but don't care for the new menu. Some of the good items are gone . The drastic changes are not easy to figure out  Going to take some time to adjust.
Aly K.,"Tucson, AZ",10,70,15,2.0,11/10/2014,"The last time I was here, I didn't even get to eat. I was here with a friend, and we tried to get seated, but after 15 minutes, we just got up and left. I usually like coming here  but lately it's just not up to par.  The restaurant wasn't even that busy to begin with, and I could understand if it was packed to the door, but that was not the case, and the hostess was no where to be found, so we just left and went somewhere else."
Desuriee S.,"Tolleson, AZ",0,3,,1.0,10/13/2016,I feel so bad for the staff they were so stressed due to corporate being in their location. They were more focused on policy procedures and measuring my drink orders than remembering what I ordered for carry out.   Corporate needs to not stress there employees out!!   I waited for half hour just to pay my bill because the big boss was asking how full a glass should be.  How to properly cut a strawberry. Give me a break I'm giving this location a 1 star not for the employees but for the corporate staff for stressing employees out and not being more attentive to customer satisfaction.  Paying patrons do not care how the strawberry is cut we want good service and a good meal!!! Get it together corporate
Tracy L.,"Tucson, AZ",16,30,38,2.0,1/21/2015,"Ok I tried to rewrite but was unable. The food was good, the soup yummy. Great conversation with a fabulous friend makes this review a 5 star review, but really it is a 2 star based on  cleanliness of place, which was pretty gross.  :(  sorry but I'm not gonna lie."
Mariya D.,"Glendale, AZ",68,168,76,1.0,10/4/2014,"The good: service, cheap drinks. The bad: my fries were warm, not fresh. Neither was my fried fish. My husband's burger looked okay but the bacon looked gross and so did the lettuce. The wings I got  had BBQ sauce just dumped on top of them without any effort to make it look presentable. I had to pay extra for ranch because it was happy hour. Just bad experience and it's another reason not to come back to an Applebee's. Crappy microwaved food."
Dara A.,"Tucson, AZ",45,7,,4.0,1/16/2016,"Our entrees came before our appetizers. The  drinks took sometime since we were there  for their happy hour specials. I'd like to see some vegan options or at least vegetarian options tho, all options don't have to come with meat in it. I was with family so I ordered a oriental salad without the chicken. The food was better than Olive Gardens and half the price. We will definatley come back!"
Christina C.,"Tucson, AZ",27,123,38,4.0,8/4/2014,"What can I say? I am a fan of Applebee's. I like when I know what I am getting. I have gone to this location more often then I should probably admit, but every time I go the service is good. The 2 for $20 is a great deal and always has good choices even when it's updated. I miss the honey chicken with shrimp, but that won't stop me from being a regular.  Happy Hour is 1/2 price drinks and apps. 3pm - 7pm and then... 9pm to close."
Leonard W.,"Tucson, AZ",8,8,7,1.0,7/13/2015,"I have to say my last couple of visits have been horrible! Beer was flat, food was cold and desert was not even edible. When all this was brought up to the waiter he seemed not to care at all. I asked for the manager and never even showed or comped anything. I filled out the survey on line and still no response from anyone!  Horrible service, horrible management and horrible experience. After the last visit we will never return! Save yourself a lot of frustration and don't even go to the wetmore Applebee's. Not saying they are all like this one but after the last several visits at this one unless there is a management change I will never return and will let everyone know how bad our experience was!"
Golo H.,"Broken Arrow, OK",0,7,,1.0,12/6/2015,"The hostess was great. The server had no arms and took our order and although we were placed in a very uncomfortable situation we made the best of it and ordered two beers.  He brought the beers with carrying them under his armpit and when he sat them down I was already starting to gag. They were intentionally not filled to the top, his shirt was filthy, the rim of the glasses filthy from leaning against his filthy shirt. this is not about discrimination against the disabled but you best be sure it is about sanitation and I can barely write this without feeling ill. HOW DARE YOU PUT US IN SUCH A AWKWARD SITUATION. shame on Applebees  big time man. Im shocked the place hasn't been shut down due to this. I walked up to the guy and told him we had to leave due to this and he was very understanding."
Mark S.,"Tucson, AZ",180,502,33,4.0,6/2/2011,"I only want to write this review for one reason: To thank our server at this Applebee's  for serving our group of 22 on a Wednesday night and providing fantastic service. The scene: High school graduation night. Two high school graduates, one on each side of town. My daughter, one of the graduates, really wanted to get both groups together since her cousin's (the other graduate) family could not attend her graduation. This was the only place we could think that would be open that late and hoped they would be able to handle a group that big. My wife and I are the first to arrive and we tell the hostess we will have 22 and she actually tried to talk us into going somewhere else. Applebee's hostess: this review is not for you. You do not need to read anymore.  Go seat someone. But I digress. We tell her we are willing to wait, to which she tells us it will be an hour and a half. I say that's fine as long as we will still have time to eat. It ended up being only about 45 minutes as a big group left and we pestered them for the area. The group was a litte broken up but at least all in the same area. There were actually a few complaints about the food. Not totally unexpected in a big group. But the server was five stars. Drinks were refilled promptly and she got all the food out, from what I could tell, by herself. She even offered to break up the bill however we wanted at the end. I wish I had gotten her name because she did an incredible job and I would have called the restaurant and singled her out to the manager.  I did make sure to tip her VERY generously because despite all of this my daughter was happy to have her family together that night."
Alicia R.,"Mesa, AZ",23,7,2,5.0,8/26/2014,This place is amazing!  Monday night is karaoke and Tuesday is team trivia.  So much fun!  The service is always excellent and the daily drink specials are awesome.  The managers are always out visiting the tables.  I've talked to everyone of them.  Great job Applebee's!
Jon H.,"Tucson, AZ",0,15,,1.0,3/7/2015,"We went to this particular Applebee's because we had been given a gift card.  I am a bit hard of hearing and the first thing I noticed was that the music was so loud that I could not hear my wife.   While it did not take long to be seated, the design of the place makes it so that you are still in close proximity to the bar.  We could clearly hear the bartender over the loud music.  Not an enjoyable experience. We decided to order two things off of the two for $25 menu.  My wife ordered the shrimp, while I ordered the mac and cheese, honey pepper chicken tender dish.  We also ordered the onion rings as an appetizer.   The onion rings were good.  The shrimp was overcooked.  The mac and cheese was not good and the honey pepper chicken tenders tasted odd.  When you place them on top of the mac and cheese, it simply was not a good combination.   After I put my food in a to-go container to take home for my dogs, I discovered a large spot of honey at the bottom of the bowl with the mac and cheese sauce.  It was as if they either dipped the tenders in honey and then placed them in the bowl on top of the pasta, or poured the honey on the tenders while they were in the bowl.  Either way, it was quite disgusting. The server was mediocre at best.  We had to ask her for silverware and she was a bit inattentive, although the inattentiveness could be due to having too many tables, which seems to be a common occurrence these days."
Dalria J.,"San Jose, CA",0,21,2,5.0,9/13/2015,Went here for my sons birthday! Our waiter was so awesome! My son got his meal free and sundae. This is actually one of best Applebee's I've been to in years. Kinda sad that it only had 2 1/2 stars and im glad I didn't pay attention to it because we had a great experience.
Gilbert T.,"Tucson, AZ",7,250,62,3.0,7/2/2014,"Would give this place four stars, but their service is atrocious!  The food is pretty good, however chili's is better.  The only reason I like coming here is for their excellent happy hour and the 2 for 20 me and the wife get.  Last time I came here it took 25 minutes to get the check!  The place was not busy and the server went outside and talking to her boyfriend for 10 minutes before she came back and gave us the ticket.  Chili's give the same experience with better service and food so head to the one on Broadway if you want a good experience."
Cece N.,"Monterey Park, CA",14,164,106,3.0,7/14/2012,I would only come for the 2 for $20 deal (: Our waitress is so dumb and funny. Our foods just came out and we barely got Our fork on it She asked if the food was okay? Lmao Then our real entree came out she just placed it on table And she asked my mom if her meal was good  Wow my mom didnt even eat  the food  yet Then my mom order oj and oj are not refillable  She didnt tell my mom that its not free refill  She simply brought out a new cup for my mom Then when bill came out we asked her about it And she say oj are not free wtf right We left her a 10$ tip since it seems like a slow day  But she was pretty rude when we left  Food was okay  I had the ribs and fries  Mom had steak veggies and mashed potatoes Strawberry lemonade is pretty good
