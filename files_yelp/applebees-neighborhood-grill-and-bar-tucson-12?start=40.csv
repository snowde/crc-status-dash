Matthew M.,"Tucson, AZ",8,7,1,4.0,8/8/2013,"It's an Applebee's. But it's a nice Applebee's with nice people and Applebee's food. It turned out to be karaoke night when we decided to eat here, and this made the evening a mix of a bit more entertaining and and a bit more terrible than had it not been karaoke night."
Ron R.,"Tucson, AZ",56,184,2,1.0,4/11/2013,We usually end up here because all the other establishments are filled to the rim but it wasn't any better then usual. Their happy hour prices are really good which is why we come here sometimes but the service is more miss then hit. I've never ever tipped anyone 5% in my life and I did yesterday.:( She had only two drinks to bring and she messed one up after yawning at our table.  It was the worst service we've ever had. If I go back I'll make sure to stay far away from the tables she is serving.  The wings are down level from other establishments around there also. Not even close to Buffalo Wild Wings.
Richard R.,"Tucson, AZ",1,12,,1.0,10/11/2014,"I don't usually eat here but last time I ate it was OK. Today terrible. Service very slow . Now we got in a little after noon and not yet crowded but took forever to get our food. Our server did get switched then back to us but that is no excuse. On the plus everyone was friendly ! Food I had Crosscut Ribs with Honey BBQ sauce and dry, overcooked and I think they left it sitting because it was only warm and fries were lukewarm. Also I think I was supposed to get coleslaw which was missing. Another dish came later and that was hot. Also never order Shirley Temple here. It was awful and my kids hated it. I will give them another chance since I do not recall such a bad time before."
Lori J.,"Tucson, AZ",0,39,4,1.0,10/17/2015,Only received half of our food. Hamburgers that did come were not cooked. Female manager did not care if we  didn't get food nor that what was served was still raw! DONT GO! Disgusting
Courtney V.,"Tucson, AZ",0,8,,1.0,11/21/2014,"Food was terrible and delivered with the wrong sauces Server did not come by table to check on the food, etc at all table dirty, ask to have it wiped off and server forgot Service terrible Dishes dirty Definitely the worst meal I have had in a long time"
Mario O.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,10,5,5.0,9/8/2014,"Love this place my favorite place to get away from stress and drink my favorite beer, Jessica the bartender is amazing at what she does, she's polite, friendly and professional idk what Applebee's be without her great customer service FIVE STARS !!!!!"
Cody T.,"Tucson, AZ",36,8,1,1.0,12/9/2014,"Food was so-so. We get the Spinach & Artichoke dip every time. However, when you say there is a food allergy and your food comes out with that one item you are allergic to, it ruins the experience and your appetite for the night. Especially when it happens TWICE in a row. So much for remaking the dish. It was back to my table in less than 2 minutes. Service was decent, nothing to rave about."
Thomas S.,"Tucson, AZ",87,1,,1.0,6/5/2016,"We visited this restaurant on Saturday June 4th at 333pm. The order of double crunch wings as I started eating them I was wondering where the crunch was.  They were the most soggiest and cold wings I have ever eaten. The house salad that we ordered was not so bad I would give it a 3 on a scale from 1 to 10.  The steak quesadillas were the most hideous disgusting concoction I have ever encountered in my lifetime.  I felt so sorry that it was such a waste of food that I figured my big dog Scrappy who pretty much eats all leftovers as we put the leftovers in his bowl for him to feast on, he just gave us this super discouraging look of disappointment and simply walked away.  The spinach/artichoke dip was okay but seemed overcooked but since we were so famished we had no choice but to eat it. The only happiness we received at your establishment was the nice cold Blue Moon's we had. The waiter was very quick to bring them too.  When I told the waiter that we didn't like the quesadillas he literally told me he would bring a box so we could take them home!!! There was no apology or what can we do to make your visit better. He just simply didn't care!!  WE WILL NEVER  EAT AT THIS APPLEBEES AGAIN AND IT IS SUCH A SHAME SINCE THE OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS ARE OF BETTER QUALITY AND THIS RESTURANT REFLECTS ON THEM AS WELL!!!!!!!!"
Jerry S.,"Tucson, AZ",0,10,2,2.0,8/16/2014,"I ordered a half chicken, bacon, and avocado sandwich on Ciabatta with soup on the side. When I did finally get the food, the sandwich consisted of dry Ciabatta bread, chicken, lettuce, and tomatoes. No condiments, bacon, or avacado.thank goodness the soup was good, because that's all I had to eat for the next 15 minutes. When I did get the sandwich it was dry, and with the first bite the whole thing completely fell apart. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the beer was cold. The bartender was annoying, and inattentive. He didn't ask how the meal was...for obvious reasons I think."
Richa S.,"Tucson, AZ",454,231,74,2.0,1/28/2014,"Terrible food as expected but the rare times I go, its for a game and beer. Got mud shark spiced ale for $2.50. cant beat that anywhere."
Andrea H.,"San Francisco, CA",387,424,6065,2.0,2/15/2011,How is Applebee's still open?  Seriously.  Ugh.  Appetizers are ok (I guess) and the bar is accommodating.  Bottom line:  there are better places in Tucson that aren't chains.  Go to them.
Drea G.,"Tucson, AZ",31,267,73,4.0,12/18/2013,"Came by to get an appetizer and drink with a friend today. We got the boneless buffalo wings and the bahama mama and a mango flavored margarita. Everything was tasty, but amazingly enough, I didn't enjoy how often our waitress checked on us. I started to feel annoyed by it, and my friend did as well. She came by literally every 4 minutes or so and kept interrupting our conversation! I appreciate the hardwork, but I wanted to enjoy my company.."
Pablo R.,"Tucson, AZ",1,7,,1.0,7/27/2014,"Service really sucks!! Waited 5+ minutes to even be acknowledged.  No hostess, waiters saw us, bartender,  busy on phone...ended up leaving...never be back to this one."
L. R.,"Fullerton, CA",125,31,,1.0,5/4/2013,"mediocre at best and I'm not even talking about the food. it took them 20 minutes for a table for 2, took another 20 for our drinks and when the food came out, it was cold. I really don't know how they managed to pull all that off but they did. awful experience."
Nikita P.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,11,,1.0,8/23/2014,"Went here last night with my friend and the service was terrible! We sat at the bar and the bartender was very unattentive, she was too busy socializing With her friends and complaining to co-workers about how annoyed she was. We only got one drink, she wouldn't even acknowledge us so we could order another one, she blatantly ignored us. Our drinks sucked, my mango margarita tasted just like juice only! We ordered French Fries, they were good until we noticed her hair was in it. At that point we decided we had to leave. My change was just put down on the bar without a thank you or anything. Worst service and bartender ever."
Alysia W.,"East Bay, CA",3297,592,72,4.0,6/21/2010,"Came here on a few occasions for their all-too-famous happy hour from 9-12am and it has always been a great experience! I think I prefer this location over the one on Grant/Alvernon.. Service was great the last time I visited for their Monday night karaoke, and there was a decent number of people there so it made for fun times [: The bartender was making some of the most tasty drinks I've ever had that night so that definitely helped boost my mood.. The DJ they hired for the night played a great selection of music and did a great job organizing the karaoke event. I can't say I've ever had a bad time when it came to the great equation of alcohol +karaoke :P I will definitely be returning here.. probably tomorrow night, haha!"
Rob S.,"Tucson, AZ",0,5,,1.0,10/21/2014,The service has gone completely down hill. We have gone back twice at lunch time and the experience was horrible. Will not be going back.
Mary P.,"Tucson, AZ",0,12,,1.0,9/28/2014,WORST SERVICE the food was ok but had to request lettuce and tomato for burger and after receiving the check had to wait for 20 minutes for them to bring back the card when complained the manager was rude and said that they are only human and things happen. UNACCEPTABLE will not be going back. every one here is rude!!
M.A. D.,"Tucson, AZ",0,17,,4.0,1/20/2013,I come here for happy hour often.  It's nice that it's at two different times and every day of the week.  I always sit at the bar.  Everything I've had from here drink-wise was good.  I think the bartenders are friendly and attentive even when busy.
Bernadette C.,"Tucson, AZ",40,72,83,3.0,1/24/2012,"The only reason I am writing this review is because of the great service I received the last time we went.  It was around 2pm, we were seated promptly. Then the waitress came to take our drink order. She was very friendly and talkative but not in an annoying way.  So a few minutes later our appetizer came, and we enjoyed it. Everything was freshly made. Then my husbands and my daughters food came and I was told it was going to be a few more minutes for my plate. I was ok with that since I was still working on the app. Not even a minute later the manager showed up and said that they had cooked the wrong entree and they had to start over on my plate. She apologized and said it was gonna be taken off the bill. It didn't bother me because my plate only arrived about 8 minutes after my husbands food.  We ended up paying about $15 for two entrees my daughters food and the app. and drinks. I thought it was nice that the manager went over and apologized because you dont normally get good service at applebees."
