Ashley J.,"Tucson, AZ",1,3,,2.0,6/26/2011,"Carside to go? They should call it barside to go because everytime I call for CARside to go I am told I need to go into the bar to pick up my food. Also, the customer service is less than great. The servers there are unfriendly, rude and seem to care less if I bring them business."
Ahmed S.,"Alameda, CA",96,327,,3.0,4/3/2009,"Another one of my firsts, woo hoo.  Another classic college time place for steak. Went here with paki playa over the holidays for reminiscence purposes. Food quality has gotten worse, and service was dismal. Completely lost the atmosphere. Waitress never refilled my water. Place was not crowded so there was not even a good excuse.  This place used to be packed on Sunday nights. But now, it seems like the great dust bowl.  2 stars for my last experience. 3 stars for the related nostalgia."
Greg E.,"Tucson, AZ",7,131,7,1.0,8/3/2010,It's applbees. It sucks. Overpriced and crappy food.
Robert R.,"Tucson, AZ",0,2,,1.0,11/12/2013,This location doesn't even deserve a star rating it took 55 minutes to get our food and that was only after asking for it. Horrible service
Jen W.,"Tucson, AZ",70,498,27,3.0,5/16/2011,"I feel like their $6.99 unlimited soup and salad portion has gone downhill.  I know you can get unlimited amounts, but almost of the salads have very little amounts of lettuce in them.  Not so great tasting either.  Plus, what's with restaurants having super tiny restrooms and having a faint weird smell to them?"
Kristen G.,"Chicago, IL",0,2,,1.0,5/21/2010,"Horrible experience.  When we sat down we had to wait about 5 minutes for someone to even bring us water and that was only being we flagged down a random server and asked her to find ours.  The manager walked by and didn't notice we hadn't been offered drinks yet but continued to pick up random garbage from the floor. The other girl was nice enough and said she'd get our server and that ours was very busy but it was only about 4:30pm and clearly before the dinner rush. The other server brought us our waters but before she got there our assigned server came by and said ""So I guess ___ (forgot her name) already got your drink orders"" and walked away.  I've worked as a server and it's not that hard to say ""I'm so sorry it's taken so long I've been really busy, I know ___ has already gotten your drink orders but is there anything else you need right now?""  nope, not hard at all. The other girl brought two waters, one of which had some brown thing floating in it so we decided to leave.  The horrible service that we already had within the first 10 minutes would not be worth it to endure for the mediocre food at Applebee's and we will not be returning to this location ever again."
