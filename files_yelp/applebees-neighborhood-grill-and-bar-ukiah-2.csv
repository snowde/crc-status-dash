Chris B.,"Brea, CA",54,110,33,4.0,12/5/2017,"Like others say, this is an Applebee's, not fine dining.  That all said, the family and I were on a vacation and stopped in town for the night.  We settled on this spot, stumbling distance from our hotel, and weren't disappointed.  Everything we ordered came as expected; what really set the place apart was the service.  They went above and beyond to make sure we had a pleasant dinner, and once one of the kids spilled something immediately remedied and replaced. Sure seems in reading recent reviews that our experience was an isolated incident, unfortunately, so here's a positive review to bring the average back up a bit."
Monique S.,"Ukiah, CA",2,37,2,1.0,10/19/2017,":(  Oh Applebees. We came here because we had a gift card and decided to try it out again. We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 meals. The appetizers were actually ok, especially the spinach/artichoke dip, but oh man - the rest of the food was just bad. The macaroni and cheese with chicken tenders sounded great, but the bottom of my bowl was covered in oil? It was all wet and just gross. I didn't eat more than three bites. My husband's food was cold and bland.  We are super disappointed, because we did have some great service and the place was nice and clean.  :("
Maxx M.,"Minneapolis, MN",16,408,1987,4.0,8/2/2017,"I have to bump these guys up to 4 stars. Okay, this is an Applebee's.  They're a national chain.  This isn't fine dining.  But I've been a guest here many times now and I have to admit that overall, they're remarkably consistent with good food and good customer service. My most recent experience was lunch with my daughter.  Again, the food was good.  It came out fast and hot.  And the customer service was very good. Applebee's is also one of your only options for late night dining that isn't some sort of fast food or a truck stop. -Daddy Maxx Retro"
Marie B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",39,108,27,3.0,7/7/2017,"Apparently LILY that works here is pro animal abuse.  The food was fantastic - the hostess named Lily that works here and condones animal abuse could be done without.  Let's set the scene - 96 degrees outside in the lovely town of Ukiah. We pull into the parking lot and see a ratty Dodge truck parked in DIRECT sun with a long coat German Shepard god tied in the back. No shade. No water. Panting and lethargic.  Come inside, immediately tell the hostess Lily that there is a dog outside in distress. She says 'yeah some people have told us that'. We asked Lily what the restraint was going to do, had the police been called and she just gave us a blank stare and ignored us while taking the couple ahead of us to their seats.  We sat at the bar and I WATCHED Lily walk up to a table that appeared to be her friends and let them know that we had called animal control. The woman  who owned the dog seated at the table proceeded to confront my friend and I at the bar, stating 'my dog has 2 jugs of water with her'. Uummmm the jugs of water are sealed. Does your dog have thumbs?! If not, the dog most likely would struggle with pouring itself some water.  Once Lily alerted the couple with their infant that the police had been called the hurried out to beat the police. Lily made sure to hug them on their way out the door.  For the rest of our meal Lily proceeded to glare at us and gossip to other employees that we were concerned about the dog. My bad, animals shouldn't cook to death in the bed of some idiots truck.  If you were anything of a decent person Lily, you would have alerted your manager right away and animal control would have already been on the scene but heaven forbid you worry about animals instead of your idiot friends.  Shout out to DJ the bartender - such a fun person!  Our burgers were rad, thanks!"
Carol R.,"Ukiah, CA",19,4,,1.0,10/4/2017,"By far the worst experience I've ever had here. We got there around 9:00pm, it too 15 min. To get someones attention, another 10 minutes to get a drink, which the Margarita tasted like sugar. And then had flag someone down to order. Finally got the order (which was just appetizers) and then had to get someone to bring, plates, napkins, forks. Horrible service. Did not deserve even a tip and I always tip 20%. I miss Chris the best bartender."
roderick s.,"SOMA, San Francisco, CA",3,101,2,1.0,12/3/2017,i walked from my hotel to order to go and waited at least 10 min at front but nobody seem wants to help me. i just left. thats why this establishemnt is 2 stars! do not bother to come and eat here.
D L.,"Minden, NV",5,6,,1.0,11/15/2017,"40 minute wait for my meal.  When I finally got it, it wasn't as ordered.  Asked to speak to the manager, 15 minutes later she shows up.  Very condescending, offered to make another meal, when I said at that point I'd been there an hour, she said I wasn't willing to wait for a meal. Horrible service.  I won't be going to any Applebee's in the future."
Doug W.,"Torrance, CA",46,369,45,3.0,12/2/2016,Heading south from Oregon we stopped here in Ukiah for the night and noticed this establishment was just down the street. It was the usual Applebee chain and was quite empty probably due to it was just after Thanksgiving. We were promptly seated and were approached by a seemingly not interested waitress who took our drink orders and  upon returning took our orders. I had the sirloin steak ( asked for med. rare and it was medium) with red potatoes and my bride and I each had a house salad served on a warm plate. I think the next time through here we'll go to the Burger King I spotted down the street .
Amy M.,"Ukiah, CA",0,1,,3.0,9/26/2017,"Went here last night. Took them about 10 mins to seat us. It wasn't terribly busy. Just when we were about to leave we got seated. The food was fine. It's Applebees so it's pretty much always the same. They've had worse cooks at this location.  Service was very sloooow. Our waitress was very absent. She was nice and pleasant though. Just very no where. I have to say that there was a young man named ""Austin"" who was basically taking care of everyone all night. Like he was doing this waitresses job x2. If it wasn't for him I would have given 1 star. He may as well be the only wait staff because it seemed as if he was."
Siu C.,"Downtown Flushing, Queens, NY",0,23,,2.0,8/6/2017,"Just ended 3 day camping trip with my family and entered on a quiet Sunday evening.  I did a quick scan and saw several booths and requested to the host for one of them.  She checked, returned, grabbed four menus and said 'how about a table?' while walking towards a table.   I was dumbfounded!  I asked her 'what about the booth?' and her reply was the service will be too slow in the booth.   We sat down and ordered food but I just couldn't help to continue observing how there were six booths and the host only concentrated on getting the amount of tables filled evenly for the servers.   What happened to accommodating reasonable customer requests?   The food was okay for an Applebees but the hostess needs more training."
Bob W.,"Moreno Valley, CA",83,1,,1.0,10/23/2017,"Service was slow, food to our table took over 40 minutes with one meal taking an additional 15 more minutes. The second round of drinks ( not bar drinks ), our server forgot about them and we had to remind her after 20 minutes. There were plenty of staff to go around. The manager did not apologize for the delay, in fact she tried to make a joke of it. I've been this restaurant in the pass with out any problems and have traveled up and down the state, without any problems."
Liesa O.,"Ukiah, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/21/2017,Worst experience at an Applebee's cross county! Manager was condescending when we offered the feedback that she asked for! Food was ok at best service and was terrible. Seat was dirty steak was over cooked drink was incorrect had to ask for a napkins twice and the meal arrived right after our apps.
A L.,"Ukiah, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/21/2017,"If I could give zero stars I would. This is the second time we've came in, been seated and never helped. We literally sat there for 20 minutes and people came in after us, sat two booths behind us and already had someone help them. I would t care so much except this same exact scenario happened a month ago with the sane group of employees. I complained to the manager and it just doesn't seem like anyone who works there cares about anything at all. Terrible service and we will never go to this Applebee's again."
Jennifer H.,"Folsom, CA",30,88,45,1.0,5/9/2016,"Super disappointed. I wanted something walking distance from my hotel. I tried the beef on potatoes, which said it was new. The onion rings on top weren't edible due to so much grease. The sauce covering most of the dish wasn't edible due to salt. So I gingerly picked out the meat (which was overlooked yet somehow cold, as were the tomatoes) and scooped off the gravy to get to the potatoes which much to surprise were nuclear hot and I burnt my mouth. The waitress didn't seem that it was strange that I didn't eat 80% of it. Aside from the food, the table was sticky and covered in grime. I don't think a thorough cleaning had been done recently. When I got my check it had food particles in it and the inside was wet."
Georgia A.,"Ukiah, CA",127,25,7,4.0,7/27/2016,"Went to this establishment today 7/27/16 and had a great experience. We were seated in the high tables by the bar which usually hurts my back but we were grateful to find out that our server was very friendly, helpful and attentive. His name was Chris. Our food came as ordered and was great. Very happy with our experience and will be back, especially when Chris is working, definitely a great asset to their franchise here in ukiah!"
Lauren H.,"Lucerne, CA",0,13,,1.0,12/11/2016,"Horrible, disgusting food. Literally the worst meal I think I've ever had.  Service was awful,  table was sticky, food was downright disgusting! Will never be dining here again."
Mike R.,"Sparks, NV",6,40,2,2.0,10/16/2016,Typical Applebees. I've never been to a good one. Came here because it was a rainy Sunday night and it was located across the street from my hotel. Chose it entirely on the convenient factor. I sat at the bar and decided not to order based on what I saw on people's plates sitting around me. Looked like TV dinners that had been reheated 4 or 5 times. Gross. Had a couple of beers (which seemed to take forever based on the slow service) then left and went to the Mexican place across the street.   Good call!
April H.,"Rohnert Park, CA",64,6,,2.0,10/1/2017,"We've been here since 5pm.  Waited 20 minutes to be seated because they couldn't find the hostess.  When she finally surfaced, there were SEVERAL parties that needed to be seated so the servers were really backed up.... 5:50 and our appraiser finally comes out (only because we ordered on the the little table screen) we still don't even have any utensils, we had to get them ourselves from the hostess station. The ""beers on tap"" list is not up to date even though it's hand written. The hostess just keeps walking by looking confused, but I guess, at least she is finally on the floor. ... And hour and 15 minutes in since we got here, still no entrees.. the only reason this is even getting a second star is because the manager felt bad about making us wait  so long for our food and he comped the most expensive item.  And was trying to do everyone else's jobs when they couldn't be found.  The manager was the only person we were impressed with."
Curtis C.,"Lehi, UT",162,429,81,3.0,8/16/2015,"We wanted a cheap, decent meal and Applebee's was it. The wait wasn't bad, but we weren't really keeping track of time. Free WiFi was nice, especially as someone traveling through with limited cell service.  I had a burger that I thought had pineapple, but I'm not sure it did. Either way it tasted decent. The seasoned fries were good and the sriacha mayo I got on the side to dip them in was pretty good too. Overall it was a fine trip, no real complaints."
Zeb H.,"Upper Lake, CA",0,6,4,5.0,10/23/2016,One of the best steaks I've had.  Friendly staff even though they were short handed. Great value. Thx
Helena T.,"San Carlos, CA",33,22,,5.0,3/24/2016,"Hella gay bartender made me happy to get a drink as a lesbian. The old dude sitting across the bar next to his wife staring at me wasn't cool, but hey, what are you gonna do? Totally dropping a 20 on this 4 dollar bill. Let this guy know he's loved and his grace is inspiring and says only wonderful things about you, Applebees."
Tiffany D.,"Antioch, CA",93,96,3,2.0,4/18/2016,"We came at lunchtime this past Saturday; our server was great, food was good and it arrived fast for our group of five.  However, the hostess who greeted us literally with a scowl made us feel we were a nuisance.  After being seated, even my stepdaughter asked if I noticed the look on her face when we walked in.  Also, the women's restroom was in pretty poor shape and smelled terrible."
Crystal P.,"Fort Bragg, CA",29,39,6,1.0,10/12/2016,"I came here with my boyfriend last Wednesday after a softball game. We were seated pretty quickly. That's the ONLY thing that happened quickly. After our waitress took our drink order and we looked at the menu we decided on 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. The waitress brought back the drinks, forgetting the water. She mentions that she will be back with the water. She promptly forgets this, and serves two other tables water. I had to flag her down twice and ask her to refill the drinks. The appetizers came out and we ate them. The waitress came back to the table well after we were finished and asked if we wanted more chips with our spinach dip (which was gone.) We said no. At this point, three other tables that came in well after us have gotten their dinners. One has actually finished and LEFT ALREADY. The waitress took away the appetizer plates. We have now been at this establishment for an hour, and our entrees are nowhere to be seen. At this point two other tables are upset because one hasn't had their order taken after 20 minutes, and the other had some kind of issue with the food. Both tables requested the manager, and one left very angrily. The waitress ignores us for another 15 minutes. She finally comes back to the table, after we have been there for nearly an hour and a half and says that ""the kitchen messed up on your wrap, and the tag got 'bumped' so they are starting your food now."" I tell her that I want her to cancel the food, and bring us the check for the appetizers we have already eaten. This is not the first time the service in this establishment has been EXTREMELY SLOW. The waitress was also RUDE and inattentive. We live an hour and a half away, and could have been home in the time it took for us to NOT GET OUR FOOD. Also, the women's restroom is not clean, and smells badly. I will not be back here anytime soon."
Steve T.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,8,3,1.0,4/15/2016,I am here for work and have been here 4 times in the last 2 weeks and each time we have a problem with the service. It's not one particular server. Today was the worst. The service was horrible.  Could not get the waiter to get us place settings and refills on drinks.  They would not bus our plates after we were done eating.  We ordered dessert and the guy that brought the plates out set them on the edge of the table so hat he would not have to remove the dirty plates.  They don't seem to want to satisfy their customers unless they know you. I like Applebee's but the service will drive me away.  Unfortunately for me in this town there's not much to chose from after 830 pm. Hopefully the corporate managers go in there and experience the poor service for themselves.
Becca K.,"Redwood Valley, CA",0,1,1,5.0,6/6/2016,Had a great experience here today even though they seemed to be short handed. Rachel the only 1 waitress that was working and soo busy gave amazing service and was very attentive and sweet even though she clealry was very very busy! The cedar salmon is to die for! Its actually a decent place.
Chris E.,"Arcata, CA",10,1,,1.0,2/6/2016,Have stopped here three times with kids when traveling. Horrible service each time but the kids were craving it.  All three times we ended up waiting in excess of 15 minutes before a server asked what we would like to drink. This was after waiting to be seated for five to ten minutes. Several empty tables were available. Witnessed wait staff standing around visiting with locals while others waited to be seated. The table we were given was still sticky. We don't post negative reviews normally but this was very disappointing and frustrating customer service. Three strikes and you're out.
Rebekah B.,"Pleasanton, CA",19,163,22,3.0,9/4/2013,"Oh, yikes!  I feel badly leaving this review because the waitress Yesica was so nice and very good. Actually the stars are her and the Hostess.  The manager stopped by after he heard that I was unhappy.  I do not complain about the service at all!  They were great.   But, the food?  Oh my. I had the weight watchers chicken breast with sautéed spinach (came raw) and Rice.   Rather lacking, flavor, presentation.  But the mashed potatoes I got on the side? We're awesome  Give them a try, but just be honest with staff, if your not happy. Even if your not happy tip your server appropriately."
Andrew T.,"Ukiah, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/3/2016,"Yeaaaaa, pretty much the worst.  Bad service, and worse food.  Although to be fair you might get lucky going there, you never know.  I however won't be back, unless they make it free."
D T.,"Elko, NV",0,7,,1.0,9/11/2016,"Worst place I have experienced in a long time. Only a hand full of people eating, and took them over an hour to finally serve food. The food was horrible and we still received a $70.00 bill. I will never eat at the establishment again."
Alyse L.,"Willits, CA",20,100,30,2.0,7/10/2015,"You would think ordering appetizers would mean you would get it before your meal... Sadly no! We were talked into an app and it did not even hit the table until AFTER our main dishes were sitting in front of us! Now if that was not enough it was a slow day, under 10 tables eating at the time and the food took over 45 minutes, and one of the plates was a salad. Cherry on top: it was even underdressed... Get your act together guys! With 'decent' food it could be an okay place to eat."
Fidelity W.,"Kelseyville, CA",0,32,,1.0,3/5/2017,"I've always enjoyed going to Applebee's until recently.  My husband and I took our baby daughters there today and I have to say, it will be the last time.  Our server spent most of his time hanging out at the bar, chit chatting it up with other patrons and servers.  We had to ask for napkins and silverware because he was too busy wandering around doing nothing to see to our needs.  We were his only customer in our section.  On top of that, my hash browns were burned, my husband's chicken was also and our fries were cold.  The hostess brought us a booster seat for our daughter that didn't have a strap to hold her in with, and the second one she brought us didn't strap to the chair.  We asked our server for a high chair but that never came.  My husband had to go get it himself.  It appeared that the manager was a very nice, pretty pregnant woman...she spent more time with us than our server.  I would have written a 4 star review if she had been assigned to us."
Freya M.,"Kelseyville, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/27/2016,Service is horrible!!!!!! Hire new waitresses! You have great food but seriously terrible service. We used to come there regularly but now you have to wait 25 min for someone to even take a drink order! Please please hire new waitresses and we will bring back our business along with many friends.
Maricarmen E.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/5/2016,"This was the WORST dinning experience I've ever had!!! It first took our waiter at least 25 minutes to ask us what we wanted to drink then brought us wrong drinks. THEN, when we finally order our food, it WASN'T EVEN COOKED well!!!!! Then a whole bunch of young men sat next to us (my mother and little sisters) and were so loud and cursing like sailors!! Received no service at all and terrible food and terrible ambiance!!! Will most certainly NOT be going back again!!!!!"
Stanley D.,"Sequim, WA",17,15,2,5.0,11/2/2015,Sitting at the bar Monday through Thursday with Donna as hostest. Is the best. Food is always good.
Jan S.,"San Francisco, CA",32,14,124,3.0,4/23/2013,"...this applebee is the first place that I found to be pretty quiet and peaceful specially coming from an applebee...most applebee I been to is pretty alive and loud cause there were many things going on, like questionnaire where servers ask you questions for a contest or just having music playing... I like the theme of the place cause it brings me back to high school since most of the decorations are from Ukiah high school, which I didn't know they had a high school...the place is not too busy which is a good thing so the food service is pretty fast...the waiter was really friendly, he even complimented how nice my phone was...food is alright nothing special i don't mind going to this place again since its pretty much the only sit-in restaurant that is open late around that place other than Denny's...overall if you like a peaceful night then this is the place to be... Thanks JaN @cruzinglife"
Chuy E.,"Stockton, CA",21,192,30,1.0,7/28/2015,Never been to an Applebee's that was this slow. I learned my lesson and will never come here again. The staff seems to relax and will forget about you once you order.
Jessica W.,"Cloverdale, CA",58,6,,1.0,10/9/2015,"First, let me start by saying that I LOVE Applebee's. I have a great experience at every single one I go to however, this one was the exception. After walking in I immediately realize that it was close to 50 degrees in the dining room so I was shivering through my meal. But not only was the atmosphere cold, our appetizer and my pasta was as well. The manager/supervisor or whomever took the wings back to the kitchen after we let her know they were cold was pretty rude about it (didn't apologize) and just brought the wings back microwaved with an extra side of barbecue sauce. Then my pasta was cold with barely any sauce and it wasn't cooked all the way through. This restaurants only saving grace was the waitress who was very pleasant and sweet and gave us a $5 discount for our troubles."
Joe S.,"San Francisco, CA",6,182,5,3.0,7/17/2015,"Applebee's is no gourmet restaurant, but this one is better than the ones in the Bay Area.  Generous portions and decent food.  Very American."
Frank W.,"Ukiah, CA",0,14,12,1.0,1/18/2016,If any reviews for this Applebee's are good then they are liars.went for lunch on Sunday.first thing you notice is lack of guests.maybe five at 12:30 then you realize they have no dress code so you have no idea who works there.then when the waitress comes to you're table she's covered in greasy stains and dirty clothes.we get our drinks and look at the menu and order chips and salsa for three.then I see two people eating with ear buds dangling from there ears and be bopping to the music and bam I realize they are employees hanging out in the dining room like they are at there house.then comes the chips and salsa we received twelve burnt chips and I do mean   this point we decided to leave and never go back again.nasty plain nasty and the manager needs to get fired lazy dirty people it's a restaurant and a business not you're hang out.oh and the hair in the   a place like ukiah where you can get fresh chips and salsa on every corner what is wrong with this Applebee's?
Carl G.,"Ukiah, CA",0,2,1,1.0,5/11/2014,"My fiance and I called ahead to see about their hours, and were told they would be open until 12. We walked in at 10:30, the door was unlocked, and people inside were being served. But the manager looked at us with a smile on her face and refused to serve us, saying they were closed.  I'm not sure if we were discriminated against for being an interracial couple or if they just decided to close early because business was closed, but this restaurant's service stinks so bad it would knock a buzzards off a shit wagon."
