Janet D.,"Denver, CO",2176,2277,16397,3.0,3/7/2010,I like Applebees. They really are the nighborhood quick fix for my tummy.  So this review as in minus two stars is really just for their server and not their food.  Their food remains excellent to me.  I ordered the Fettucine Alfredo with Blackened Chicken and as usual it was up to my liking. The staff that worked there that day was really off maybe? Our server was very forgetful that day. She forgot to give us our utensils and did not even notice that we didn't have any until we told her. No water was offered. Little things really but it disappoints an Applebees regular like me. We also noticed that the carpets here are dirty.
Ariana M.,"Healdsburg, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/23/2016,"Absolutely worst experience I have ever had. I have had bad service but this tops it off. I have also been to other Applebee's and this one is by far the most disgusting. Let me start with the table, sticky and not clean. Took the server 10 minutes to get over to the table and 25 minutes for our beer to get there. The server was rude and un-accommodating. We waited over an hour for our food and the entrees arrives before the appetizers. I ordered the nachos. I can barely call them nachos since there was zero cheese on them. When I asked for more cheddar cheese our waitress brought me back a bowl of hot gooey spicy assortment of some form of rubber. My brother ordered the steak, 75% of it was fat and inedible. What you could eat was so hard and dry it could have been sitting out for days. The only semi enjoyable item was the boneless chicken wings that I would have loved to eat if they didn't come 5 minutes after our main course, cold and now disgusting. They were probably sitting in the window for as long as child birth takes."
Clarke J.,"Vallejo, CA",47,114,1,1.0,12/31/2015,"Spotted silverware that's fairly ugly looking, perhpas the worst I've ever seen at a chain. Either the rinse isn't hot enough, or they're not running enough soap . . either way; one has to ponder things like sterilization, germs and you. Table-tops aren't much better, often sticky, food bits. But here's the new rub: Their nifty littke screen gizmo, which is supposed to be the new Point of Service for your mobile payment . . this thing asks you questions about classic cars and what not . . and then you get $1.99 added to your bill for playing games? There was NO screen indicating a charge or fee for service or product. Let me say that again: There was no accept/decline fee for use. I would say at this point that Applebees is raking significant extra $$ without customers not even feeling the three or four dollar padding that's being done. A good attorney could make legal hay against the chain for non-disclosure, I'd guess. We got our money back after complaining. No big deal if the food had been good! But it wasn't. Caesar salad was dry, pieces cut huge. (Grade C-)  What looked entertaining on the menu: Applebees ""Loaded Brisket Enchilada"" supposedly errupting with seasoned beef, covered in green sauce, garnished with sour cream and Jalapeno slices. Reality? Barely detectable meat portion. Miniscule comes to mind. Ended up being a glop of wet rolled flour tortillas, drenched in green sauce, sour cream as shown with hot pepper slices, and some pretty poor version of what should've been some tasty cheese . .  and a big 'ol pile of rice. (Grade D) $13.99 for a plate that no self-respecting Taquiera would EVER send out of the kitchen. Didn't even bother with a ""to-go"" bag. This location needs a management level shake-up. Can't imagine whoever is invested here being happy with the product, or their bottom line. I always thought that it was Chili's or TGIFriday's that might suffer on the national scene, but I could be wrong. With my wifes' Fiesta Lime chicken, two lemonades . . it came to $38+. Applebees is in trouble on both the macro (hidden gaming charges) and micro levels (gloppy food). Some VP's there aren't earning their keep."
Jared T.,"San Francisco, CA",22,5,,1.0,6/10/2013,"Came here with a group of 6 for my birthday. Service was horrible. I couldn't believe how spaced out the server was. The only thing she was good at was texting.  Food sucked...and I mean SUCKED! Everything was way overcooked and so tasteless. Does anyone teach the kitchen staff how to season food? I mean, I'm sure it all comes pre-packaged and frozen, but you can even give that crap some flavor if you know how.  I would be extremely embarrassed to work at this place, and even more embarrassed to own this pile of junk. Tear it down and put something worth while there. I will never visit this place again."
William O.,"Sacramento, CA",28,15,4,1.0,1/3/2015,"Worst applebees ever. Do not go here. Drinks too way to long to receive, waiter was hardly in to check on us and lied about happy hour. Waiter said at time we were ordering, ""yeah all drinks are half off..."" then the bill comes and we find out she was wrong and was only on beers... Soooo. That being said. Save ur time and money and go somewhere else. 1 star only because i have to -__-"
Jesamyn A.,"Redwood Valley, CA",3,3,,1.0,2/24/2015,"I have officially sworn off Ukiah's Applebee's. Worst service, and food wasn't great either. My burger was hardly any meat, mostly bun, and my garlic fries were made with minced garlic flakes! From the time we sat down to when we got our food was was 1.5 hrs. Never going back again."
Granny C.,"Mendocino, CA",3,19,1,5.0,2/25/2015,"My husband & I visit Applebee's whenever we are in Ukiah. The servers are attentive, efficient & super courteous with just the right touch of friendliness. The only time I had anything close to a complaint, I told the server my food wasn't quite warm enough. I expected the plate would be warmed & returned. Not so. I was brought a whole new meal!"
Brenda P.,"Sun City, AZ",1,17,8,4.0,1/29/2015,"This is one of the best Applebee's I have visited. The bartender was nice, and remembered what my husband and I ordered from a previous visit. The Perfect Margarita is perfect, and the draft beer is cold. I recommend the pretzels and the boneless hot wings and burgers. This is a clean restaurant with a good staff."
Mike S.,"Ukiah, CA",2,19,,3.0,2/20/2016,Service was fine cleanliness was good housekeeping on carpet and cleaning if tables was lacking. Two meals one was fine other was cold chicken sent back twice finally third time was properly cooked.
Paul A.,"Ukiah, CA",0,6,,1.0,3/11/2016,Obviously this applebees knows they have no competition in thier market. Service is usually very helpful but food is terrible. Maybe this is why they go through so many servers. People can only take so much for something they can't control.
Tracey M.,"Kelseyville, CA",70,32,3,1.0,11/28/2015,First time and last time at this location. The service was terrible.  We waited at the door for almost 5 min and we weren't greeted during this time either. Then when we did get sat we waited 4 more min for the server to acknowledge us. Once we placed our order she brought out plates for the appetizers and when we went to take the plates they were filthy  how she missed this is beyond me they were that dirty. When we got our appetizers the cheese wasn't even melted so we had to send it back. At no time did a manager come by our table. The food was mediocre at best.  We have eaten at many Applebee's and never have we had such bad service.  If I could give them negative stars I would. The bathrooms were also disgusting.
Matt W.,"Covelo, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/24/2015,I eat at Applebee's all the time and I love it but this place was different . The food was just plain terrible so bad so that I had to drive back down there and return the food I ordered . The cook at this place should not be working in a kitchen .....
A H.,"Discovery Bay, CA",0,12,2,5.0,2/5/2016,"I always go for my favs hot wings and beer! But when I want a change I make sure that Dawna is working the bar.  She makes the BEST margarita ever!  She is a super cool, friendly bartender who does an excellent job and provides excellent service.  WE LOVE her!!! Go to the bar and ask for Dawna!"
Dave G.,"Lakeport, CA",99,3,1,1.0,8/31/2012,"OK folks I am TRULY an idiot.  After writing my prior review and swearing never to go in here again- I did it.  I went in.  I was starving, it was there..........shame on me. This time- sat at the bar ordered two sodas and dinner.  Got the soda's......and then waited......and waited ................and waited...........after watching seveal other customers come, order, eat and leave, the bartender finally looked up from the bus girls cleavage and Giants game and realized we had been forgotten about.  He sends a busser into the kitchen looking for our soup and salad...........then he tells me ""it's on its way""   BS- order lost.  Had the bartender noticed say 30 minutes earlier we had not been served perhaps the night would have been salvaged, but clearly this Applebee's is the worst managed, poorest producing piece of Sh#$ restaraunt in all of the North coast. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! Shame on you Applebees corporate for allowing this disaster to oeprate like this.  I cannot beleive it has not been torn down with a wrecking ball yet as it should."
Jeannie R.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,29,,2.0,11/10/2012,"We're traveling through town, you would think Applebee's would be a safe choice... wrong! Walking in the door, we could see it wasn't too busy, and the wait staff was sitting down chatting. We stood and stared at them and still couldn't get service. Finally we just got our own menus and found a table for ourselves. After sitting for awhile a waiter finally came over to take our drink order...two glasses of water took a good 10 minutes for him to bring us. He was a little rude to us when we dared to make the suggestion that we order food.  It took forever for our food to come out, and my order was not as I'd requested, not to mention the chicken was really undercooked. Anywhere else I would've sent it back, but didn't have high hopes for this place to improve my meal. As tourists just here for a few days our food options are limited, but we will definitely find somewhere else to eat for the rest of our meals."
Jeff R.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",47,134,59,1.0,4/7/2014,"I would absolutely give 0 stars if Yelp allowed it, I hate Applebee's to begin with and this location did nothing to try and change the perception of this poorly run restaurant chain.  I decided to eat here based solely on its proximity to my hotel (walking distance) and the fact I recognized the brand name and you can mostly count on getting average food pretty quickly.  I will give them credit for 1 thing; we were greeted promptly and seated immediately, it's all down hill from this point. First issue is that the bartender (Stephanie G) was not interested in delivering service and rudely signaled to the hostess to find out our drink order after she noticed us get seated at a high back table in the bar area.  Simple order of Diet soda and Blue Moon beer, soda was quick, beer took almost ten minutes.  Despite the restaurant being far from capacity, 10 minutes for a beer is pretty ridiculous.  By the time Stephanie came over to our table we were ready to order, again simple order of two sandwiches and fries.  Apparently too complicated for this place.  Received appetizer and salad after about 15 minutes and finished my beer waiting for entrees.  After more than 15 minutes with an empty glass, Stephanie took time away from her friends at the bar to inquire about a second beer, I asked about the food and was told it was on the way.  She brought a second round and we waited an additional 10 minutes before our food arrived.  Stephanie said she would wait until 9:00 to ring the beer so she could save me $3, how thoughtful...only problem is I would have paid more just to get service and prompt food delivery.  I would avoid this place like the plague, food is just average but the service is a complete joke!!  If you are a local with tattoos all over your neck and arms and know the bartender, you will be treated like royalty and get personalized service and great conversation.  If you are a businessman from out of town, forget it!  Ironically the businessman is going to tip significantly more for great service while the tattooed local is not!  It's pretty clear this location doesn't care and obviously doesn't read their Yelp reviews or things would change.  I will never return and will let all of my co-workers who travel here for business to stay away as well.  Maybe some day when I'm broke, covered in tattoos, and trying to get into the bartender's pants I will return since I'm guaranteed stellar service....and I won't have to tip!!"
Russell M.,"Potter Valley, CA",0,31,,2.0,8/19/2015,"Where to begin? When we entered there was no one to greet us. One of our group had to go to the back where 2 workers were trying to hang a banner to get someone to seat us.  Then one of us used the restroom. The restroom had an unclean oder. After washing his hands the automatic towel dispenser had the towel roll improperly installed so he had to come back with wet hands.  Thankfully our assigned wait person was busy cashing out a large party that wanted separate checks and asked Pristina to take us. Pristina was so professional & personable in the chaos inside. Once she had permission to help us, things began to happen. For drinks we ordered 1 coffee,  1 root beer & 2 beers. Pristina asked the bartender 3 separate times when our beers would be ready. By the time they arrived the one drinking coffee had almost finished his second cup.  When our meals arrived 1 over cooked steak, 1 side of cold fries, 1 burger sans bacon and jalapeño missing from the fourth.  The meals Pristina brought out she caught the obvious mistakes.  Her ""helpers"" just made more work for her to correct. One brought a refill of the ""house chips"" which transformed into cold tortilla chips on their way to our table.  Before paying for our meals we got to talk with the manager to let him know how much we enjoyed Pristina and how the other staff was not really ""assisting"" her. He had been covering the drive-up take out. Just shows how under staffed they were tonight."
Robert M.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,57,,3.0,10/30/2014,The food was fine. Typical Applebee's. Server was really friendly but didn't come by often enough. Finished my second beer and the empty bottle from my first was still sitting at the end of the table. The restroom fixtures were dirty. It looked like they only clean the floor.
JC P.,"Miami Beach, FL",18,120,196,1.0,5/7/2014,"This Applebee's survives simply due to the lack of good restaurants in the area. This place have bad service, specially the bartender last tonight. The bar was dirty, my chicken ceazar salad was lousy. No wonder it attracts some of the worst and loud customers you can have sitting at a bar. Drunk and swearing is apparently allowed here. It's pathetic."
Cate G.,"Campbell, CA",34,206,122,1.0,3/24/2012,"Not going back. Appetizer was burnt, service was mediocre, food was bland and smaller amounts than other chains. Staff was also super chatty with each other right next to our table... Unprofessional."
