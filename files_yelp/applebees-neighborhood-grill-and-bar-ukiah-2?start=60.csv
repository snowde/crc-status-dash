Shayanne O.,"Ukiah, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/19/2015,I can't believe they closed before their published time. I go there with my family for dinner and they are closed by 10:30 PM when they are supposed to close at midnight. Please be accurate online so people don't drive all the way and waste their time.
J O.,"Ukiah, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/1/2016,"This place is the most disgusting excuse for a restaurant EVER!  Luckily we had a gift card and it didn't cost us anything. The waiter (maybe 15 yrs old) seated us in a booth and both seats were covered in dry dirt/mud. We had to move to another disgusting,  dirty as filth can be, booth. Sat there for literally 10 mins before anyone even looked at us. I asked another waiter (probably 16 yrs old) if we were ever going to get served sometime today? He apologized and said our waitress is learning how to do things. I didn't see anyone training her which leads me to believe she just had to fend for herself. My wife asked what kind of salad dressing they have and the waitress started explaining what a salad consists of. WHAT? ? ! Omg...it gets worse. The seats have a line of black greasy grime at the top of them due to never being cleaned, the windows had little kid hand prints all over them, the blinds were covered in dried spills and splashes and dust, the table was like fly paper it was so sticky! The utensils were very spotted and dirty looking, and the water glasses had greasy finger prints all around the rims. After our fine salad, which consisted of a thimble full of dressing (probably the most expense on a salad) we were served our lime chicken fiesta which consisted of about a 2 oz piece of chicken with about 1 cup of rice. Wow!.... Thank god it didn't cost us anything! Never give an Applebees gift card to anyone. I keep trying to give this place a chance but no more. Worse place I've ever been to and will not return...EVER!"
Julie S.,"Ukiah, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/29/2015,"This is a local restaurant where I have eaten many times. The service and food have varied over the years but recently both have dropped into the unacceptable range. The food was not good, not as pictured and flavorless. I had the shrimp cavatappi which was watery. The service was nonexistent as we had to hail passing servers who were not ours to get a box and our check. It took a very long time to get each although we had asked for them at the same time."
Justin R.,"Ukiah, CA",78,17,,1.0,3/12/2011,"The menu selection at Applebee's has always turned me off to it.  Usually I would go on to state the redeeming factors of a restaurant... but there are none here.  We can all see the low rating this place has received, Food is uninteresting and often botched in some way, shape, or form.  Often the service is also terrible.  Do we even have to give stars?  I feel like they owe me stars, if anything."
Matthew H.,"Eureka, CA",7,4,,1.0,4/18/2015,"If I could post a review with zero stars, that would be my choice. In general, we have had good luck with this chain restaurant, and have found it to be reliable at different locations. The Ukiah, Ca. location was the exception. We ordered items that we have eaten before: steaks, pasta, salad, quesadilla's, and were expecting that again. We ordered car side to go, which wasn't available for some reason at 8:43pm, so we had to wait inside the restaurant since they the server told us that wasn't available Saturday night, which seemed odd. When we got back to hotel, tired and hungry with kids after a very long drive, we were shocked. The food was horrible. Some of what we ordered was completely the wrong food, the steak that was supposed to be medium well was dripping blood inside the package, the pasta tasted like fake macaroni and cheese, salads were barely anything but iceberg lettuce, and the baked potato was just a warm potato tossed in for show. We barely ate anything, but were too tired to go complain to the manager. I would recommend staying away from this location until they can get better quality control."
Abe F.,"Yolo, CA",0,9,,1.0,10/14/2010,"Oddly, I had never eaten at an Applebee's prior - I probably will refrain from ever doing so again (as harsh as that may sound). The atmosphere, ambiance, and environment, all equated to similar casual dining chain restaurants (i.e. Ruby Tuesday, T.G.I. Friday's, Outback Steakhouse, etc.). However, at this particular location, there were two very apparent differences that separated it from the aforementioned: 1. Food 2. Service I will begin with the food. I ordered a regular hamburger and fries, which were not appetizing at all and were both rather tasteless. In fact, it was probably the worst food (flavor-wise) that I have ever had at a restaurant that serves moderately priced food in a casual atmosphere. Now I will address the service (which coincides with number 1). The waitress (Hilary F.) was, well... to put it simply, rather rude. I did not see a ""regular"" hamburger anywhere on the menu (which is what I desired), and so I asked Hilary if one was available. Hilary's response: ""You mean like without cheese?"" Me: ""Yes."" Hilary: ""Yeah, if that's how you want it (followed by a weird look on her face - as if no one would ever order a hamburger without cheese). Would you like it pink?"" Me: Well, done please. Hilary: Is there anything else I can get you tonight? Me:  May I ask what else comes on the burger? Hilary: (Sarcastic tone) Well, you asked for no cheese so what else would be on it? (Sarcastic chuckle and eyes to the side) Me: (Taken aback by such a response and thinking to myself, ""What the? Is it just I, or was that rude? Hmmm."") Hilary: (Makes weird face) Well since you don't want cheese... Dinner Date: (Chiming in) What kind of sauce... ketchup, mustard, mayo? Me: (Clearing my throat and looking at Hilary) Ummm... do you realize who I am by chance? Recognize me at all? Hilary: You're Abe Froman? Me: That's right, I'm Abe Froman. Hilary: The Sausage King of Sacramento? Me: [caught off-guard]... Uh yeah, that's me. Hilary: Look, I'm very busy. Why don't you take the kids and go back to the clubhouse? Me: Are you suggesting that I'm not who I say I am? Hilary: I'm suggesting that you leave before I have to get snooty. Me: Snooty? Hilary: Snotty. Me: Snotty? (*Disclaimer: Okay, so that last part beginning with me clearing my throat was actually taken from the classic 80's film ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and did not really happen... but hey, that is what it felt like being in Hilary's presence. Everything above that part did indeed play out exactly as conveyed) CONTINUED:  Hilary goes on to say that she could bring the abovementioned on the side - she never did. I ate the burger dry, as she would literally ask if everything was okay and if we needed anything only while hurriedly walking past - and she only did ask if we needed something once (possibly twice) during the entire course of our meal.  I am not certain what the problem was, but she seemed very confused, impolite, and unaccommodating. I could not figure it out, as I was just as kind and respectful as I always am to others. Though I had limited communication with the rest of the staff, the one or two that I did interact with seemed fine. Perhaps others may have a completely different experience than I did (I hope so), but I personally would not patronize this Applebee's location again and probably would not recommend it to anyone else. Its location is convenient; however there are plenty of other (i.e. better) options just a short drive away."
Melissa K.,"San Jose, CA",7,70,1,1.0,11/27/2012,I was staying at a hotel across the street and got curbside pick up. The food was horriable. Forget this place.
K C.,"Fort Bragg, CA",26,3,,1.0,5/12/2013,Horrible in all aspects. Ordered steaks....got tasteless shoe leather....and I even ordered it rare! Waitress ..... worthless ...... when we saw her. Only reason Im giving one star....at least I didn't get food poisoning!
M K.,"Rockville, MD",17,34,26,1.0,1/9/2010,"I ordered a salad. They screwed it up. A SALAD. How did they screw it up? My salad had ice-cold lettuce in it--as if it had just been pulled from the freezer. They screwed up my boyfriend's meal too. He ordered a roast beef sandwich au jus. They FORGOT the AU JUS. The dish had two ingredients and they forgot one of them. What! At least the manager was nice enough to come to the table and cut our bill in half. Still, we would have done better with the no-name taqueria next door. I figured we were safe with a chain for our first night in town...sadly, no."
Tammie B.,"Ukiah, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/17/2013,"Go somewhere else! Terrible service from hostess, waiter, manager start to finish. arrived to a nearly empty restaurant. Hostess seated us at a dirty table, and recommended we not look underneath the table?! Waited 20 minutes, Waiter does not show up even to offer us water or drinks. Got our own drinks from the bar. Served our food after over an hour. Over charged on our bill. When questioned, waiter became irate. Manager not helpful at all. Can it get any worse?"
Cristina R.,"Lodi, CA",17,6,6,2.0,4/30/2011,"I adore some of the ppl that work here but I have to admit the food sux, yes I said it. Consider it fast food served on a plate! Customer service can be really good  and then on the other hand it could be your worst dine- in experience. The only way I could recommend this place is if your looking to eat a burger and your with a group of friends,  maybe go watch the game and have a beer or two, I do like the bar there."
Skye J.,"Berkeley, CA",177,191,50,1.0,5/29/2011,"Terrible staff. Always a disappointment. If only the food tasted as good as the pictures look. I felt like I was in a scene on the movie Waiting when I went there last. And no, I was not being the frigid snobby lady. I tried to give them a chance. But the service was terrible, it seemed as if everyone of the servers took a break except for a manager and drank alcohol and ate at the tables with their name tags still on. The manager even joined in on the fun instead of asking to refill my cup that had been empty throughout my whole meal, and it was an alcoholic drink! I would've ordered another so that maybe if I got drunk the food would taste a little better. Worst applebee's Ive ever been to."
Jocilin S.,"Lakeport, CA",1,17,5,3.0,12/24/2013,Usually they are alright for am Applebee's but today it was a hairy adventure .... My sister found multiple hairs in her food but the staff handled it well and was very apologetic.
Baylee C.,"Encinitas, CA",167,98,41,3.0,9/10/2010,"I just moved to Ukiah and was looking for dinner. This was honestly the only recognizable non ""fast food"" chain I found, even though I am not known to eat at such chains, it felt like a safe bet for a decent meal. So we pulled up, and it looked a little busy inside. My boyfriend went in to grab a curbside to go menu from the hostess. When he asked, she responded ""here, I don't even care,"" and handed him a sit down menu to take. So then from the parking lot, we called in our order. We got the pick your own 3 appetizer plate, an the 2 for 20 meal deal. The girl on the phone was very pleasant, making up for the lack of kindness the hostess had shown. We then returned 25 minutes later, which they were on time with our food, and unlike others experiences, ours was accurate. The only weird thing was the girl delivering curbside was not in any sort of proper uniform, but instead a ""play-dough"" t-shirt. Overall, the food was fine. The towering steak quesadillas get a thumbs down because they look nothing like the picture, and the boneless buffalo wings were honestly better the next day, but everything else was good, and my steak was actually medium rare as I had asked. Minus one star for the lack in professionalism from the staff, and minus one for the misguiding photos in the menu. I will most likely dine here again, but to go, as the staff might piss me off if I sat in for a meal."
Shannon B.,"Fort Bragg, CA",18,4,1,2.0,11/30/2010,Just had the new florentein chicken ravioli...it was yucky...its like they glopped a pile if boiled spinach..microwaved ravioli and dumped a shitton of cheese ...wont order that again...my friend ordered the steak and veggies...veggies over cooked. Potatoe under and steak tasted wierd..
Shane M.,"Rocklin, CA",50,15,1,1.0,10/4/2012,What a joke.  I waited over 10 min to order food to go with no answer.  I was hoping this would be faster than the last time I was in town and waited for the crappy server to even take my order and then he didn't even know what credit cards they took.  When the lady did answer tonight she was very rude and sounded like she was talking in a tin can.   PLEASE CLOSE THIS CRAPPY PLACE DOWN and bring in a real place to eat in Ukiah.
Monica S.,"Ukiah, CA",21,3,,1.0,4/23/2014,"ZERO STARS!! I will not eat at ANY Applebees after my horribly rushed lunch today. Within 3 MINUTES of sitting down, our server (toe-head blond with tattoo's covering her left arm) approached our table FIVE TIMES to say, 'not trying to rush you, but are you ready to order yet'. I hadn't even OPENED my menu the first time and was trying to enjoy a luncheon conversation with my husband. The last time she came to the table, I just pointed at something on the menu and said, 'Fine. I'll just take whatever this is' and she said OK and walked away. It was not what I wanted to order but she was OBVIOUSLY not going to let me look at my menu before deciding. The restaurant was not busy and there were several other employees working, so there was NO excuse to treat us like this. My husband and I frequently eat out and will definitely AVOID Applebees from here on out. She was so extremely rude that I hope she gets fired so no one else has to feel that rushed and forced to eat food they didn't even want. We paid over $50 to be treated like SHIT that was sitting in someone else's way and wasn't leaving fast enough. There were PLENTY of empty tables - was she just trying to make sure she pocketed the tip before her shift was over? NO, she SAID she was rushing us because she wanted to get our order in before another server got their 'big' (8 people I think) order in. I should have a CHOICE of when I order. RUDE."
Luz G.,"Healdsburg, CA",0,2,,4.0,5/25/2011,"Our ESL class tasted many dishes from Applebee's for our class. We recommend the buffalo wings, the Cajun shrimp pasta, the spinach artichoke dip, and the grilled chicken / Asian salad. We do not recommend the riblet basket. One of our classmates couldn't even tell what it was supposed to be. Plus, the fries did not look appetizing. We ordered take-out, and think it is probably better fresh at the restaurant. -Juan, Hugo, Orlanda, Consuelo, Adriana, Felix"
Robert S.,"San Rafael, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/6/2013,"This place has the worse service. I can't rate the food order because after one hour of waiting,during an uncrowded noon hour, I got up and left. Had water for the duration. Never again. To bad I'm not allowed any minus ratings."
Niurka S.,"Martinez, CA",6,1,,1.0,6/22/2012,"I would give more stars for the service that was great, but the food was horrible. I am a fan of Applebee's but the food from this one from Ukiah was terrible!!"
