mike g.,"Ukiah, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/13/2011,"Terrible place to eat. Sat at the bar , bartender dip-wad was so busy twirling glasses and trying to impress the loser barfly girl that it took about 15 minutes to order our food and he was right in front of us. I ordered a steak medium, I'm not even sure it was cooked, the mojitos i ordered were mint flavored water. I'm telling you right now if you ever get to Ukiah and feel like going to Applebees, Head right across the street to Branches, better food, service, drinks, atmosphere. In fact one of the waiters from Applebees now works at Branches. If you're looking for something fast and cheap , run from Applebees and head straight to a McDonald's, or BK or KFC, or Taco Bell. basically anything is better than this place. The homeless people who hangout at Walmart could probably give you something better to eat."
Jeff B.,"Ukiah, CA",10,68,,1.0,7/12/2009,"The food is stale, bland, and the service is awful, usually coming from the kitchen. Most waitpersons are high school or first year college kids looking for good tips, and it will show. If you are going, hit up happy hour for tall beers, but order a burger or nothing. And be ready to wait it out.  Also be warned that the good brews have been replaced by lower end stuff."
Bev F.,"Sacramento, CA",0,14,,2.0,9/25/2006,Boy they must be having some bad nights. The last two times service has been poor and not to mention very slow.  25 minutes to   obtain drinks.  To be fair it was a Friday night but being 8:30 pm I thought we had missed the dinner crowd.  Not even a smile out of the waitress. She did mention working to many hours.
Colleen L.,"Ukiah, CA",12,7,,1.0,8/22/2010,Placed an order to go last night and the order was messed up.  Had to return to the place to get the right food.  Since new management took over about a year ago the place sucks.  Very slow service and not worth the money you pay for a meal.  I would suggest thinking twice about going there to eat.
Female C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,63,48,1.0,8/10/2010,"WORST SERVICE AND WAIT TIME. If you want to wait forever just to be seated and then another 45mins to hour and a half to get your food, go here. If you aren't in love with the food, go somewhere else. Even Denny's or Stars Restaurant"
Andrew H.,"Mountain View, CA",8,21,,3.0,7/14/2008,"I never think of Applebee's as a Restaurant (too corporate, so it reminds me of fastfood). Under ordinary circumstances I'd never go to one; but this was not my choice. Working the Fire's in both Ukia and Chico the CDF had contracted Applebees for meals and I was pleasantly surprised. It helps that we are always hungry by 2100 when we finally eat; but the food and servicce was good. I think this maybe an overlooked chain. If you're in a hurry, don't have the time to seek out someplace special and just want good food at fair prices this just might be your thing. I think they're A-Ok and that's after eating there 3 times in two weeks in 2 different towns."
Patricia M.,"Ukiah, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/12/2009,"I ordered 3 items from the Carside to Go service.  Never again.  Of the three items, two were wrong. I ordered a Chicken Caeser Salad and received NO DRESSING!  What is the point of a Caeser Salad with no Caeser dressing?  Secondly, I ordered a Chicken Fajita Roll Up and asked for NO Pico de GAllo sauce.    I'm alergic.Unfortunately, it came loaded with it!  My other complaint is that I waited in the TO GO parking space for 10 minutes before a server came out with my order.  Her excuse was that she didn't recognize the color of my car.  My car is tan, I told them it was tan, and my receipt says tan.  My car looks tan. She said my car appeared blue from inside the restaurant.  Get this... I was the ONLY car parked in the carside service spaces.  Do you think she could have come out to see if I was the only order that they apparently had?  Ridiculous!  I won't order from them again!"
