Matt S.,"Uniontown, PA",0,41,10,5.0,5/6/2017,"It's a touch pricey for what you get as far as portion size, but half price app nights make up for the difference. The wait staff is amazing and its always relaxing."
Angela S.,"Richlands, VA",0,17,1,1.0,7/19/2014,"This place always disappoints. Today was no exception. The wait was 45 minutes for food with the restaurant only about 20% full.  The steak was disgusting, the texture and taste reminded me of a microwave TV dinner.  That being said the fries were amazing. If I had it to do over we would order the appetizer sampler and a basket of fries."
Carissa K.,"Smock, PA",16,3,,4.0,8/21/2014,"The recent renovation at the Uniontown Applebees is beautiful, and includes more pictures of the historic Uniontown High School rather than just Laurel Highlands High School (which as a Uniontown alumna, I'm proud to see). I usually don't find the hostesses very friendly, but most of the waiters/waitresses make up for that. I've always received my meals in a timely manner. The half price appetizer deal usually brings me here, so if you are new to applebees, I would recommend trying the boneless wings!"
Rod H.,"Uniontown, PA",0,3,,2.0,3/17/2016,Disappointed. The bar doesn't know how to make drinks. I ordered a margarita with salt. They use table salt and very little of it and the steak I ordered seemed like it was cooked in the microwave. They could do a lot better.
Mindy L.,"Connellsville, PA",7,30,14,4.0,10/5/2014,"I was there for lunch. Had the turkey bacon avocado sandwich. It was very good. The french fries were hot. Every time I had been here and ordered french fries they were always hot. I wanted coffee with my meal and our waiter Aaron, said he would make me fresh coffee. Had a good experience and a very good meal."
Justin P.,"Smock, PA",3,25,4,4.0,5/10/2013,I love Uniontown Applebee's! The service is great and the food is amazing! You can't beat the 2 for $20. 1 appetizer and 2 entrees for only $20!
