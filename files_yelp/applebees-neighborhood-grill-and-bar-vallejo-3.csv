Kimberly B.,"San Jose, CA",4,69,10,4.0,9/25/2017,"I think I gave a review a while ago but I'm updating it now since my last visit with my boyfriend. Environment (5/5): Party-like with a welcoming and friendly feeling. Cleanliness (5/5): Didn't see the bathrooms this time but the rest of the place was clean Service (5/5): God seated in a good amount of time even with the crowd and waitress was super duper friendly Food (4/5): I got a roasted chicken w/ onions and shrimp on top, super good. My boyfriend's burger was a bit bland though.  Price worth (3/5): This time around the food was super duper good especially with the happy hour price for drinks and 2 for $20 deal but I've had times where the portion size and food taste were meh.  Overall (4.4/5): Good chain restaurant location overall"
Ricky B.,"Vallejo, CA",198,6,1,2.0,12/12/2017,"Recently, I came in to this Applebee's with a friend of mine and we were dissatisfied with our visit. Sunday evening, around 10 P.M, we ordered two macaroni and honey chicken entrees and a spinach artichoke dip appetizer from the 2 for $25 menu. I ordered a long island iced tea and handed my waitress my ID card when asked to. I'll admit, I do look young without makeup. However, my ID card says ""21 in 2017,"" my birthday says March 26, and it's the end of 2017. I don't think it was necessary for my waitress to hold the card extremely close to her face, squint at it, and begin counting out loud the math from my birth date until the current date. It was extremely embarrassing.  We didn't wait long for our food, but when it arrived, it was half the advertised size and it was unsatisfactory. The spinach artichoke dip appetizer and chips were heavily salted. Our macaroni and honey chicken was dry, tasteless, and slightly watery. We do not plan on eating here again."
Danny t.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/10/2017,"Came two hours before closing. Told us 10-20 Mins. After a hour, said they couldn't seat us. Pretty much the only chance I gave Applebee's and I will never again."
Joel L.,"Berkeley, CA",0,6,4,1.0,1/9/2018,"I made a lunch car side to go order. Email notification said my order would be ready by 12:38pm. I parked at the location marked park-side to go at 12:42pm. By 12:51 pm no employee bothered coming out to hand me my order.  Ended up calling the restaurant to inform them I was waiting in the suggested parking spot awaiting my order for 10mins and to go ahead and cancel the order. I know 10mins may not seem like a long time, but I'm on my work lunch and the fact I wasted time driving to and waiting at the location. Awful first experience. Never again!"
Alexis C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/7/2018,"This was absolutely the worst service I have received at a restaurant... Food was cold, waitress was very rude, and employees gossiping about there personal life loud enough to interrupt my lunch."
Katelyn W.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",104,12,4,1.0,11/28/2017,"Meh. Always disappointing. Steaks are gristly and kind of old tasting. Fries are always cold and taste like they've been fried in reused oil. Burgers are oil- laden cow bombs. We've given this place several tries, but tonight vowed not to return. Tried a ""healthy"" option of steak with ancient grains. A wet, weird. mess topped with fatty old smelling steak nubbins made me queasy. No food should be this watery...not even soup. Waitress was super sweet and comped the wet disaster. Pass and save your dollars. Oh, plus 3-4 cars get broken into per week there. So, double pass."
Sandrine K.,"Concord, CA",2,5,4,1.0,10/27/2017,"Wish I could give them 0 stars. I ordered a ""Blue Ribbon Brownie"" and was charged $6.49. I thought it was not very cheap but assumed I'd get a generous piece of brownie so I just ordered. Arrived home, opened the bag and found a little triangle with two sauces. Is it a f***ing joke????This is purely and simply taking customers for idiots. NEVER AGAIN"
Helena M.,"Vallejo, CA",0,11,3,1.0,1/6/2018,"Horrible service and food. We ordered the original sampler, it came after our main dishes. Besides that, they never brought the artichoke dip (listed on what is included). They finally brought and our bimbo server then charged me for it. When I told her it was listed on the menu as included, she said it was not, took it away, and reversed the charge for the dip. I should have disputed it with my credit card. There is a reason people make minimum wage, and this business is a good example why."
Arcolle C.,"San Francisco, CA",1,45,16,5.0,9/6/2017,"I'm an Applebee's fan, encouraged by my children. haha We would visit this branch almost each time we visit 6 Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo. We were here on Labor Day and the wait time was less than 15 mins.; we came in at about 5:45pm for early dinner. Our young server, Terrence, was very attentive, friendly and accommodating. He was quick to serve our drinks to make the happy hour prices. Thank you. We ordered from the 2 for $20 menu, and we were satisfied.  The 3 cheese macaroni, chicken strips and lime chicken (I think) were all freshly cooked and tasted great. The portions were just right. I had the Artic Blast alcoholic beverage, and it was perfect for an 80 degree day.  We'll come here again for quick, friendly, and reasonably priced food. Good meal, thank you."
Sapphire B.,"Benicia, CA",0,20,7,1.0,1/5/2018,"The amount of people that complain about this store is undeniably reasonable. The decision Applebees has made to do nothing about it is incredibly unreasonable. Not only are their deals fake (dollar margaritas about 1/4 of the size of a normal 4$ margarita...), but their service is inconsistent and slow no matter who your server is. I had one incredible server and her name might have been Daphne or something but me and my friends all left her a nice not on the check. Anyways, every other server will basically forget what you ordered until you ask them about it. The food production has gotten slower and many times have had my food delivered cold because it was sitting on the counter and the server didn't think to pick it up."
Nicole M.,"Vallejo, CA",63,12,,1.0,11/4/2017,"All day I was craving French onion soup, Applebee's has the best French onion soup.  I decided to take the whole family to Applebee's for dinner.  We got there at 5pm, not busy at all.  We were seated and sat there for over 10 minutes waiting for someone to acknowledge us.  Mind you 3 starving kids with no patience. I finally flagged someone down and asked if they could please send over a waiter.  A few minutes later a guy showed up and apologized for the wait.  Ok, we placed our order.  I asked if I could have French onion soup instead of salad, he said, sure no problem.  Another 10 minutes our waters finally arrived, and 2 salads.  I said, I ordered soup instead of salad, they took the salad away and the waiter came over and said, the salads are both yours, the soup will be out in a minute.  You told me I could have soup instead of the salad.  No, I never said that and walked away.  My husband got irritated and asked a hostess t9 see a manager.  The manager walked over we told her that our service was not so great, that we waited a long time to be acknowledged etc.  then told her about the soup.  Her response, there are no substitutions on the menu and the waiter knew that.  I responded, pretty angrily then the waiter should not have said no problem.  She then said, please do not raise your voice to me, I will not be talked to that way.  Are you kidding me! No apology, no how can I make it right, just total attitude.  I was a server and restaurant manager for over 20years. I also know some customers are really awful and difficult to deal with.  My husband and I were so appalled at how we were treated, we got up and left.  Went down the street to Black Bear diner and received excellent, friendly service and a good meal.  It's too bad, always liked Applebee's, was sad to hear a lot of them were closing down, but never again.  They have lost my business and the corporate office of Applebee's should be ashamed of the way their employees treat customers."
Renneth D.,"Berkeley, CA",5,116,45,3.0,4/3/2017,"Applebee's is a great way to have a economically-cheap and fun date night with your love, while also awkwardly having a high school reunion with those who never left after high school. The 2 for $20/$25 is my go-to, but it has its own problems. The ribs on there, for example, are a shame to ribs all over the globe. Their tough meat and lack of it make it more enjoyable for my dogs after I gnaw away the little bit of ""goodness"" that is on em. Learned after this that a safe bet is almost always the four cheese mac n cheese. At least there's that!"
Ahn Jae Lee A.,"Vallejo, CA",15,25,136,4.0,7/12/2017,"I used to dine out with friends at Applebees Jeddah KSA and this is my first time in the USA. My husband and I ordered two for $25 with free appetizer/s. We got the 4- mac and cheese with honey pepper chicken tenders and bourbon street chicken and shrimp, mozarella sticks for the appetizer, and I forgot the name of the soup. Taste of food is just okay to me, I am not a fan but everything is just fine. My husband loved the food  The staffs are polite and always checking if we were okay or do we need anything else. It may be a policy or part of their customer service but I find it awkward and exaggerated asking us more than four times in just 30 minutes. They still deserve a four star for my first-time visit."
Tara H.,"San Rafael, CA",78,5,,1.0,10/1/2017,"We went here for there last night  to try their happy hour and quickly found out that they use their bar tables for seating families. There was a line out the door and because they can not accommodate there customers, they seat families in the bar too..... then when asked about it they became very rude....  I will NEVER bring my family to this Applebee's.... especially after ready the comments and the experience we had...."
Dats IV U.,"Vallejo, CA",0,9,,2.0,10/4/2017,"I know management won't care to read this which is a reflection of their service. Maybe others will read this and make their own decisions. Dirty silverware, bent forks, Salty food, missing ingredients, one dish was flooded with honey (wth), the salad served had no dressing, never offered a refill on drinks, she never checked to see how we were doing, did not clear our table. When raising our hand to order dessert she wanted to give the check instead. She never came back to take our order for dessert. We got fed up and  paid our bill thru the tablet. This ""was"" our favorite place but now it's the last place, last resort. Alot of empty tables and alot of people waiting to be seated while waitress and waiters sat in the back table what looks like they were on break. Really bad service. Really disappointed."
Frank P.,"Vallejo, CA",37,29,2,2.0,10/1/2017,"Let's a face it Applebees is not a high end restaurant, but generally the foot and service is somewhat acceptable. However our dinner Friday night was a total fail. We both had the plank fired salmon.  It was overcooked by a good margin, dry and tasteless. The veggies were also overcooked and mushy, having lost taste.  A waste of our money and the evening.   More irritating than bad food was the music. It was way too loud with plenty of screeching high notes and lack intelligible word. When the server was ask to turn it down, she tried and failed twice. The table  of 2 next to us got up and left before ordering. We were stuck.  Terrible!  I usually like to say something nice in a review. The beer was cold."
Gary R.,"Vallejo, CA",15,4,,1.0,9/30/2017,"My wife and I went in for a burger and fries, it was the absolute worse, not to mention extremely slow service."
Michelle D.,"Fairfield, CA",175,1,,1.0,9/24/2017,I came with my husband and wanted a margarita. I've been waiting for a new ID to come in the mail. I had an expired ID and the print out from DMV and they refused to accept it. Not to mention while we waited forever to speak to the manager the waitress didn't ask us did we want to put our food in. She decided to take everyone who came after us order. So everyone even got their food before us. I normally go to Fairfield and get awesome service and I will continue to do so for now on.
Leandra M.,"Vacaville, CA",0,1,,3.0,11/5/2017,"We (party of 3) were told the wait would be 10mins, it ended up being 20. Once we were sat our server took a half hour to greet us and another 15 to bring our drinks. We ordered everything all at once and it took 45mins to get out to us. Our server never came by again, we finished our drinks and were never offered a refill or water. By this point we were ready to leave until Michael brought our food out and replaced our rude server with someone better. Our new server Terrance was very friendly and brought us refills without having to be told, also made sure the rest of our food came out faster.  THANK YOU MICHAEL AND TERRANCE!"
Anna ..,"Vallejo, CA",12,1,,1.0,12/18/2017,"I can give you a detailed breakdown of my experience. If I can give 0 stars, I would. I came in at 1000pm, my order was taken and I paid for it at 1024pm. It's a good thing I asked for a receipt because 30 something minutes later at 1105, I went up to the host to ask about my order. She acted like I wasn't sitting right across her podium for the last half hour. I gave her my receipt, she went back to the kitchen, came out and gave me one of the most stupidest excuses. She told me that they ran out of chips and that they were preparing it in the kitchen. Basically my order was delayed for more than half an hour because of chips. Another ten minutes later at 1122, the server who took my order, came out, apologized and handed me my order and told me that since I paid for my meal, they cleared it in the kitchen. In other words, they completely forgot about my order. During that whole time I was sitting there, not one server or hostess ever came up to me to ask me what I was doing there sitting like an idiot, waiting for nothing. After this experience, I was already mad and just can't let it go. So I called the manager to complain, just outside the store because I didn't want to make a scene inside the restaurant which, knowing me, I probably would. She handled me nicely, I have to admit, because I was already beyond angry. I'd like to thank her for refunding my meal because of this bad experience. Unfortunately, when I got home, they messed up my order. I got brocolli instead of mashed potatoes, and I asked for medium rare and got well done instead. Truly not the experience I wanted especially after a long day at work."
AnaLeesa W.,"Vallejo, CA",0,20,3,5.0,10/29/2017,"Always come here after work for drinks. Super quick service, food is always out really fast and hot. I highly recommend the perfect margaritas here. Sooooo good. I love Lisa"
Paulamertha A.,"Suisun City, CA",287,472,617,4.0,8/26/2016,"We decided to dine here on a very busy Friday night. Since our party was small, we didn't have to wait anymore than 10 minutes for a table. Although the service was slow, we had a great time and great food. When a good deal of the guests left, our waitress was able to be more attentive to us and we also had the opportunity to just chat with her. We ended up staying at this Applebee's restaurant for a total of 5 hours, 2 of those hours past their closing time. The staff didn't rush us to leave; in fact, our waitress reassured us that we could take our time since she saw that we were having a good conversation. When we did leave, one of the gentlemen working there even walked us out of the restaurants and made sure we got to our cars safely. 4 out of 5 stars."
D. J.,"Vallejo, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/16/2017,"I have eaten at a number of Applebee's throughout the area Bay Area like Napa, Fairfield & Concord locations. BUT Vallejo's location is the worst! Which is sad cause it's the one in MY town. I've eaten there 3-4 times 1st time I was so disappointed that I never went back for years! Then a friend talked me into trying one in another location recently & food was great! So I thought I'd give Vallejo another shot!  Food is hit & miss at best! Which is sad cause there are so much interesting choices. Examples: 1/4-1/2 bowl of luke warm French Onion Soup, luke warm Riblets & limp cold fries on 2 separate occasions & soggy luke warm fish & chips. Service can also be hit & miss. STEP IT UP VALLEJO!!"
Cryss B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,11,,1.0,10/1/2017,"Really packed. It took about 1hr to get inside. It took about an hour to get the check. Several mess ups with the food that was brought to the table. The waitress had a very good attitude but forgot food details. Ordered desserts from the machine at the table and never received the both. So many hosts at the stand goofen off, not helping didn't even try to ask for our names to put into the clipboard. We had to walk out of the crowded restaurant and go to a person to get our check."
Natasha N.,"San Pablo, CA",82,3,3,1.0,6/29/2017,"I usually have nothing much to say! But after having the worst experience at Applebee's I feel it relevant to speak out!  Do not eat at the Vallejo Applebee's! We went for a nice family meal! We sat down, ordered, my food came out horrible the vegetables were mushy and the whole dish was dry! Then they sat a large party across from us! Our 1 year old son sits in a high chair at the end of our table! The party was so close that it blocked the isle and people were literally crawling over our son to get by! Servers included! The food I sent back, and in place wanted a steak medium ! Well after taking Liam into the booth with us as my son and child were done eating and we didn't want a strangers ass all over him!!! I call for a manager, not only was it a safety concern for our child but a fire concern for people leaving in an emergency! The manager could have cared less and after asking for my meal to go I get home to find I get a real undercooked slimy steak! So do yourself a favor and never go here! They are a joke and care nothing for their customers!"
Alexandra M.,"Vallejo, CA",149,1,,4.0,10/9/2017,"I cannot eat everything, and Michael the manager was incredibly understanding and I appreciated the time he gave to us to fix our issue."
Priscilla P.,"Vallejo, CA",6,59,34,1.0,1/23/2016,How are you going to bring out used silverware to us and expect us to eat??? That is so disgusting. Waiting 15 minutes before my order was taken... it wasnt even busy because we got seated right away. Also when we asked for something that was on the menu the waitress said they didnt have it... umm yea they do. Wow Need better service
Kristine M.,"Orland, CA",0,7,,1.0,11/18/2017,"I came in last night with my daughter on our way home from Stanford Medical.  Tired of dealing with traffic, we decided to stop for a decent meal at about our 1/2 way point.  When we arrived, we were told the wait would be about 15 minutes.  There seemed to be some confusion as to who came in first and folks were getting annoyed with parties of the same size being seated out of order. Once we were seated, I was surprised to notice at least 10 tables that were not being used.  This remained all through our dinner, even though folks were waiting in the lobby area.  Odd.   My daughter has food restrictions and asked for the nutritional menu with listed allergens.  As soon as this was out of my daughter's mouth, the server says, ""I don't know where that is, I'll get my manager.""  Then crickets.  We figure it out best we can and flag down our waitress to order.  We still have a drive and the wait to order is getting too drawn out. Our drink order was taken at the same time as the meal order. My daughter orders the Chicken with shrimp.  It's good, comes out as it should.  I ordered one of the new steak and potato dishes.  It's a 6 oz steak, choice of steak topper, fried onions, broccoli, and choice of special potato dish.  I order the horseradish topper and loaded potato tots.  What comes out is a naked steak, overcooked broccoli, and tots, without cheese topping.  No horseradish topper, no cheese on the potatoes, and no onion strings.  I inform the server of what's missing,  She isn't the same one that took the order, but she just stares at me like I'm speaking a foreign language.  Finally, she takes the plate back and I think they are going to fix it.  Should be a quick fix.  Nope.  Same plate comes back, onion has been added, still no topper, and now there is a crock of the potato casserole added.  I let the server know this still isn't right.  She then argues that the potato casserole  is the topper, so I taste it in front of her.  Only then does she believe me.  She leaves.  Now I'm sitting with a cold plate in front of me when the manager comes with the same potato casserole and says, ""I was told to bring this"".  I explain to her that I ordered the new special and what was missing. She leaves and returns about 5 or 6 minutes later with 3 small portions cups of refrigerator cold horseradish topping, stout gravy, and green onions.  At this point I give up.  My food is cold, it has gone back to the kitchen 3 times and still isn't even close to what was promised or pictured.   I eat cold over cooked broccoli, a few bits of tough steak (they did get the doneness right, but it was so tough, even my daughter commented on the way I had to cut it.)  and the potatoes.  This whole thing has taken twice the time it should and I need to get on the road The original waitress finally comes back by and asks if we want boxes.  I have to ask for the check.  After all the hassle with my meal, no one asked if it was ok, and there was no adjustment made to the tab.   We won't be back.  From what I see on the reviews here, this wasn't a fluke.  If you can't execute what is pictured, don't offer it.  My plate was handled by at least 3 different people front of house, including a manager and was still wrong.  I ordered what was offered, as it was offered."
LaMargo A.,"Garland, TX",18,2,,2.0,1/29/2017,Went last night.  Waiter Terrence WAS great. Women Bathroom was Nasty.  Told employee who was touching up her makeup to get janitor and she acted like she never heard of one. My Food was not good.  Had chicken n shrimp.  Potatoes were hard and old.  Shrimp no taste.  Took chicken home.  Tasted better today Menu items too pricey. Overall rating.  2.5
Joan G.,"Daly City, CA",42,4,,1.0,6/27/2017,This is a bad place to order for to go they said server will be with you in 5 minutes and  it end up we wait for 20 minutes and they actually take the order of the african american lady first coz they have the same ethnicity what a f*ck up service
Charmaine C.,"Vallejo, CA",62,26,4,1.0,7/5/2017,"Very disappointed with the food. Our order was wrong, then when corrected was not hot. We give up..definitely do not reccomend to anyone...its worth the drive to Fairfield or further but please don't go here unless you don't mind being charged for food that is not hot amd incorrect"
Del B.,"Vallejo, CA",4,22,2,1.0,5/13/2017,"Sad day at Applebee's. Slow not just normal slow but snail slow. Kids food arrived. Adults food they must have had to go out back and pluck the chicken first and bring the wrong orders. The GM was very unsympathetic, server blamed the cook.  Never had bad service or food here before but today topped it off as a restaurant that needs to retrain employees."
Young L.,"Vallejo, CA",93,9,6,1.0,5/15/2016,"This establishment needs new management. Bathroom filthy,  no soap,  and slippery floor.  We arrived last night we asked for ribs they said they were out,  but when we were leaving they were serving two different tables ribs.  But we placed our orders. The food that came out was served on different various plates.. Everyone who ordered at my table did not get there food the same time as us.  The kids corn dog took longer than a main course meal people who came after us was served before us as well. My buffalo wings were horrible. I asked for the manager she came over and said I may be able to do something and I'm sorry.  Our server was cool. The drinks were great on a good note"
Lauren D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,37,5,1.0,5/7/2017,What's the use of ordering online and being given a time that the food would be ready and it's not. I waited 20 minutes more for food that was suppose to be ready 15 minutes from when I ordered it. Ridiculous.
Shayla H.,"Napa, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/5/2017,"We came in and were rushed by the waiter. We ordered out appetizers and drinks. The waiter Jason L came back with 2 of the 3 appetizers. I asked where the 3rd one was and he said ""i oh totally forgot to put that order in, did you want that?"", then when it finally came out, he shoved it in my face and said ""here it is"", and it was cold...seriously...then the food came and two of the three meals comes out. The waiter then looks at my friend and says ""did you order something too?"" so we had to wait even longer for his food, which we ordered at the same time as the rest of the meals...totally forgets two items and doesnt seem to care at all. Didnt check ANYONES ID, and actually said ""I dont care about ID"" I was surprised as the tone in which he said it. Luckily everyone was over 21."
Josh P.,"Monrovia, CA",0,2,1,1.0,9/17/2017,Service was horrible . We waited 2 hrs for our food. And when we got our food it was cold.Don't ever come here.
Maria A.,"Brownsburg, IN",3,285,72,2.0,9/30/2016,"We have been coming to this location for the last 8 years and I was blown away when I realized I hadn't ever done a review..  This place is consistent.. Yep, consistently bad!  Poor service, long wait times due to staffing shortages. The place is poorly run and not organized..   To Applebee's management come on, get it together and make this a place what it could be.."
Ashley F.,"San Jose, CA",726,6,1,1.0,4/12/2017,"Service isn't good, bartender kept leaving for long periods of time, waited a long time to even order food, and while siting at the bar a lady came and sat down next to us already visibly drunk, and upset with whoever she was on the phone with. She kept leaning towards us and slamming her phone and drink, when my boyfriend went to tell someone that she was disturbing us, the staff just looked at him and did nothing, and just kept watching her. And when we tried to leave there was no one at the bar to help us. This Applebee's makes me appreciate the ones in San Jose and realized that service there is way better than the ones up here in the east bay. Unfortunately we will not be returning to this location"
Frances V.,"Sacramento, CA",432,75,377,1.0,2/19/2016,"We came in on a Wednesday night and we were seated right away. We pretty much ordered everything on the happy hour menu which were: boneless buffalo wings, wonton tacos, spinach artichoke dip, chicken quesadilla, and mozzarella sticks. Only these appetizers are half off and you must purchase a drink in order to get the happy hour price. Don't get me wrong, our server was GREAT! she was very awesome and attentive to our needs, giving us enough time to decide on our choices. However, when are food was being delivered, the manager (I believe) who brought our spinach and artichoke dip (I guess he was holding too many plates) spilt the salsa ON MY PANTS and on the ground. Then while he was placing the dish on the table, spilled some chips on the table. I definitely did not over react. He apologized and my server handed me more napkins. Honestly, even if he apologized, it didn't seem like he cared very much. He didn't even come back to check up on me. This has never happened to me before. And while I realize that everyone makes mistakes, I believe they could have handled the situation better. I definitely am hesitant to come back."
Danielle C.,"Vallejo, CA",131,23,1,1.0,4/6/2017,"Consistently crappy! No matter which one you eat at, it ALWAYS sucks! Dirty, weird food, though I will say the pretzel and beer dip is pretty good, but that is about it!"
