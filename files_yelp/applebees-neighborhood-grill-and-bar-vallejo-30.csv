Francis C.,"Vallejo, CA",0,12,,4.0,3/27/2010,"There's not a lot to do during the evenings in Vallejo except to go to the movies or HAPPY HOUR at Applebees. I heard management changed here recently which has introduced the 4 to 11 weekday Happy hours and 9 to 12 weekend Happy hours. This was genius for business and a good place to throw down some beers. $4 dollar appetizers and $3 beers... I walked out stuffed and buzzed under 15 bucks... The only downer to this place is that some of the waiters are slow and rude but some of them are awesome and quick... Basically the customer service here is inconsistent... but besides that, go sit down at the bar and order a couple a hefes and watch some games, you'll have a good time.  Also, they have some nice pictures here and there and lights under the bar table which makes your lap glow red."
Ronald C.,"Benicia, CA",1,15,1,5.0,11/11/2014,Thank you for your support for veterans.  Appreciate all the thank you's.   Great food and the best service possible. Doing the free meals for active duty military and veterans is something special.
FutureMrs W.,"Berkeley, CA",68,54,36,2.0,4/14/2010,"I usually get okay service at this Applebee's (which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1), but tonight's service was awful. First, my drink was made wrong after giving specific details of what I wanted. Then, I never got a 2nd drink OR water which I asked for twice .,,until after our appetizers and HALF of our meal was consumed. Can you say parched??? And lastly, my dessert was burnt. Yes, burned to be as black as the pan it came in and they brought it to me TWICE! And both were the exact same way. I will NEVER go back to the Applebee's in Vallejo after this! The only plus side to this place is the cheap drinks & appetizers for their happy hour. But in my opinion, I can find better."
Don B.,"American Canyon, CA",9,64,14,1.0,5/25/2010,"It's a good thing I stopped in here tonite; I really needed new soles for my boots and the steak worked out great. Oh yes, it was that tough. The mashed potatos were like rubber. If you dropped them they would have bounced. The service was very slow but the waiter was friendly.  Putting this on my ""don't visit again"" list.  Sorry Applebees, you let me down hard."
A M.,"West Lafayette, IN",845,1249,8,3.0,6/2/2012,"Decent Applebee's.   The food is nothing special but the portions are big and the prices are low.  We came here after arriving to our hotel in American Canyon late on Friday night.   We didn't feel like driving far for dinner and we had reservations at tons of great Yountville restaurants for the weekend, so we decided on something simple and cheap.   I'm not a big Applebee's fan in general but I heard they had a fried green tomato sandwich, which I wanted to try.  I am a FGT-aholic and they are hard to find in the bay area.   Not surprisingly, the sandwich was edible but not great and the FGTs tasted nothing like the ones I had in the south.   My fiance had an appetizer platter he enjoyed.    The service was good and the restaurant was pretty clean and not too loud.  The bill for both of us with tip and tax was around $25, can't beat that."
Christopher M.,"Benicia, CA",25,18,,1.0,4/26/2011,Food was not that good.  The service was not good.  Feeling of being cramped in such a small place. MOST OF ALL.  Their is an overwhelming sewage smell inside and out of the resturant.  Maybe thats why the food didnt taste good. Would I go back.  Never!!!
Janelle D.,"Vallejo, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/28/2015,"We just went last night and were disappointed by the food portion size, which was surprisingly small. I ordered the enchilada, which didn't take long to eat and was more appropriate on a child's menu or an appetizer. My dinner companions ordered cheeseburgers, which were the size of a happy meal hamburger. The fries were just thrown on the plate and there was no lettuce, tomato, or onion on the side. Needless to say, my companions and I all ate every single thing on our plate and did not leave the restaurant full. We are average sized people, so it's not as though we're used to buffet style portions. There was Black Bear Diner and Chevy's down the street, and it's so sad that we chose this place to throw are money away at. We informed the server that the portion size was small, and to his credit, he did deduct 10% from our bill and gave us a free dessert. However, I'm never coming back here. I can only imagine that other Applebees provide a better food experience and the majority of the customers at this establishent are only passing through."
Denese R.,"Benicia, CA",2,22,4,1.0,7/21/2014,Friendly staff but the food was over cooked and tasted as though it was previously frozen. Busy place. They must do good advertising. The photos will deceive you.
JUDY H.,"Pinole, CA",83,2,,1.0,9/16/2014,"First of all we are walking in at night and some guys car just broken into outside of the restaurant great way to start the night . We walk in and sit at their bar and after waiting 10 min and no server coming to help us we order on the little computer screen . After ordering another 10 min later this over weight , tired , and over worked lady comes and asks us if we have been helped ... She went to get us 2 waters and spilled one of them on my girlfriends new iPhone ... Cool ... After another 10 mins of waiting we still haven't got our drinks or appetizers yet ... Great ... I had to go to the bar tender and actually ask her what's going on with our drinks and she at first seemed confused but after actually checking her counter saw the ticket for the 2 drinks and said they will be right up ... Anyways horrible experience"
Michael L.,"Benicia, CA",91,189,17,4.0,1/19/2013,"Not bad overall. Food was good for a chain, had ribletts, they where delicious as always. Great waitress."
Ashley W.,"Benicia, CA",87,270,36,2.0,2/1/2010,"I'm going to have to give these guys a two because everytime I go there they are out of something.  Not only that but the last time I went here I walked out without my to go box and realized it five minutes later and since I was still in the area I drove back.  Of course they already threw away my food.  I was pretty disappointed.  It would be understandable if it was an hour or something, but five minutes?  Come on!  Anyhow the service can be pretty slow.  The food isn't that great. BUT on the upside they just started this happy hour thing where it's 7 days a week, which is pretty awesome with $4 appetizers and $3 import draft beers, $2 domestics."
Gill C.,"San Francisco, CA",359,379,1573,1.0,7/24/2009,"I usually don't have a problem with chain restaurants. I like Cheesecake Factory, Olive Garden, and even Red Lobster. I didn't have an issue with Applebee's until my latest experience. Now, I will never again go to an Applebee's. Did I mention never? If there's one thing you take away from this review, do not ever dine in or order to-go from this location! If only I could give this place a 0 star rating. I'm always honest with my reviews, and is rare that I give such a low rating. However, I feel with this experience, my patience had been tested to the max (and for anyone who really knows me, I'm an extremely patient person), and the service was absolutely horrendous.  I had a bad feeling about Applebee's, and my woman's intuition is usually right on the money. However, my friends (Candice and Ris) and I were starving and hoping to order to-go so we could take it to Ris's house. We rolled in around 8:30pm and placed our order within minutes. The gal in charge of the to-go orders was busy with other customers, so one of the hosts ended up taking our order (3 salads and an entree) and says the wait should be about 15 minutes. He didn't seem friendly and really took his sweet time seating the customers. Since there were no seats at the waiting area, we sat at the bar and proceeded to wait.  About 5 minutes later, the same host came over to confirm our order: Two Caesar Salads, a Steak/Portobello entree, and a Grilled Lime Chicken Salad (no onions) for me. Seems fairly easy to remember, no? I suspect he didn't place it or perhaps even lost the order. Hmmm, so much for taking 10-15 minutes, ROIGHT? SOUH Wrong! More waiting....another 10 and another 15.. At least we were able to talk and catch up with each other while waiting! Oh Mylanta!!! More waiting.....another 10 minutes passed. Candice inquired about our order, and the host replied that there was a back up in the kitchen. By this point, I was so hungry I was about ready to eat my arm, and thought that we should've just dined in instead as everyone who was sitting in the bar area had their food served to them and they arrived after we did!! ACK!!! It was close to 9:30pm and we decided to leave as the inefficiency and lack of customer service had become intolerable and absolutely ridonkulous (yes, you read correctly)! We were upset and regretted the decision to order food here. Of course, as soon as we made the decision, the food arrived. Charmaine (in charge of to-go orders) reviewed the food with us, and we asked for an explanation as to why it took almost an hour to prepare. An explanation/excuse was mumbled, and we asked if our bill could be reduced. She seemed confused, and obviously couldn't make that decision, so she got her manager. OMG, more waiting! What the hell!? Sigh.... The manager arrived, and explained the situation to him. He reviewed the bill and the time stamp on it wasn't exactly accurate as the host delayed in placing the order since he was waiting for Charmaine, etc.. So, I swear all 3 of us explained what happened. It was so aggravating and yes, asinine! He eventually agreed that the wait was far too long (umm yah!) and  said he'd take off the most expensive item off the bill. Oh geez, that's the LEAST he could've done. To make matters even worse, my salad had onions! By the time I ate, it was after 10pm and the chicken was lukewarm, spinach was skimpy, and the dressing was terrible! I could've made my own chicken salad for $5. It was the worst $10 ever spent for a salad. FTL!! Never again, Applebee's."
Joraine C.,"San Francisco, CA",1176,470,2337,1.0,8/13/2009,"Dirty table, slow service, and cold food that took 45 minutes too long. Yup, that's Applebee's in Vallejo foe ya! I think the waitress forgot to place my order. When everyone's food arrived at our table, mine didn't come for another 45 minutes. And it was COLD.  The place doesn't look too clean, either. Can we say DARK? I don't want no old, crusty food permanently stuck on my table looking like a dried old booger. Do not just wipe the tables, scrub them for goodness sakes.  The service is horrible. To ALL the waiters that I've ever had @ Applebee's in Vallejo... When I finally have to ASK nicely for a refill cuz you never came by to check on me, 1) ACT LIKE YOU WANNA BE THERE, 2) LEARN TO SMILE AND 3) HURRY UP.  I spent like 3 hours here waiting for my food, eating it, and then waiting for some water to push it down. And the dessert looked old and melting with freezer burn, definitely NOT FRESH! I know Applebee's is a cheap place to grub but I would rather take my business elsewhere."
John G.,"Houston, TX",71,88,1,4.0,9/2/2012,"Just your standard applebees. No issues, pretty decent service. Cool Manager and of course trhe food ws coo. I usually go back during happy hour. Pretty much all applebees are are the same."
Nate P.,"Daly City, CA",106,127,48,3.0,11/1/2011,"My gal and I took our brood here for a semi-late dinner.  Waited about 10 minutes for a table...on a Friday night!  Not a bad wait.  Upon being seated in a humongous booth, we were greeted by our friendly server who right away made a positive impression on us.  She was very attentive to our needs and was patient as each child placed their own orders.  Overall, a great dining experience!"
Jamie L.,"Oakland, CA",340,688,472,2.0,5/12/2011,"I went here last night because I wanted to spend time with my family. Their appetizer sampler was actually quite tasty but was gone within minutes with our party of six. Have to say their Oriental Chicken Salad is  still good and a great pairing with my Blue Moon. It was busy. It wasn't overly memorable and all I kept thinking about was the past stories my boyfriend told me about this place. They're trying and they were busy, so looks as though they're doing good."
Michael L.,"Vallejo, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/25/2013,Pretty good service... but who cares about that when you can order from a TABLET AT EVERY TABLE!!! My mind was seriously blown when I got to use it! Definitely sets the place apart from other restaurants in the area! Great food also! The portions are surprisingly adequate! Color this dude IMPRESSED!
Adam H.,"Vallejo, CA",0,25,,1.0,7/1/2014,They have a machine that you order thru which makes the dining out experience almost unbearable. It felt like we took care of ourselves. I hate to be a downer but just felt like I would rather spend my money on fast food. We tried it a few times and just did not like it. The food was not horrible and the staff was friendly but just lost any art of service with the new way of ordering our food. Just my thoughts.
Theresia D.,"Oakland, CA",291,369,264,1.0,2/25/2009,"So after working out for about 2 hours at the gym, my girlfriend and I decided to go have some dinner!  Well first off when we walk in the young man cleaning the booth walked over and just stood there for about 20 seconds starring at us and then looking over at the tables. Finally he mumbled, ""2 for a table?""  Uh yea, do you see anybody else with us, lol, I know that was just mean but hey that's why I said it in my head and not out loud, LMAO! So he then walked away and another person came to the podium and asked if we had been helped, I told him ( I think he was the MOD-Manager On Duty) that we are unsure what that guy was doing, meaning who knows if he is getting a table ready or what.  So he grabbed two menus and was about to take us to the table when that guy came back and said that he had to seat the man sitting in the waiting area first......anywho, we had to wait an entire 5 mins before we got sat, keep in mind there was about 20 people in the entire place, not including the filled bar top seats.  So we ordered everything on the menu, lol, well for the two of us it seemed that way, but really it was 2 entrees and 3 appetizers, lol!  Our server Gretchen aka Nikki was really nice and made sure that everything was to perfection! So I still don't love this place!"
M R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,25,1,3.0,5/9/2015,"We went yesterday, Friday afternoon, after work.  My buddy and I got there around 530pm and were seated right away.  There were only two of us, yet we were seated at one of the round tables near the bar which could seat at least 6 people.  We thought that was odd, so when the waitperson came to our table to get our orders, we informed her that we wanted to sit at the other side of the restaurant.  The waitperson said that was no problem, so we walked to the opposite side, got a table (for 4 people) by the window.  The server acknowledged us right away, stated that she would be with us shortly.  We got our drinks quick (iced tea and soda).  Our food came out in 20 minutes, not bad since the place was busy.  I got fish and chips and my buddy got shrimps with baked chicken.  The food was average.  After the meal, we paid using the electronic keypad placed on the table  I swiped my credit card, entered the tip percentage and the receipt could either be emailed or printed.  I expected a worse dining experience.  But overall, it was not too bad."
