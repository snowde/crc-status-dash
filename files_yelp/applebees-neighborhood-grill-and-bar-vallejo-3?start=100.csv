Anne L.,"Fairfield, CA",7,45,19,1.0,3/13/2016,"I find it absolutely ludicrous that a 23-year patron of the Vallejo store, is suddenly banned, because a mediocre bartender, is unable to act professionally in his presence.  The patron, while not a fan of said bartender, asks a friend to order his drinks, to avoid any further conflict, and that doesn't sit well with this bartender either.  With more complaining from this unprofessional hospitality worker, the ""offending"" patron is now banned.  With the amount of turnover this store has, management and bartenders, I highly doubt the inefficienct GM and the mediocre bartender will be working there within the year.  What will they have? One less regular, for sure, and probably less regulars, based on consistently poor managerial decisions."
Chris L.,"Benicia, CA",227,87,67,2.0,10/10/2015,"Ok, for a Friday night it was a normal crowd. I took the family for dinner. The food was good but this guy kept coming by and sweeping the floor. Stuff was flying up on the table an into our food. So we left dissatisfied. Thanks for the ""floor sampler apps. smh...."
Ter L.,"San Jose, CA",186,821,8639,2.0,10/27/2013,"Came here after we left six flags. Straight up starving. The wife came up with the idea of coming here for dinner since I had never been. Bad idea.  The wait was long, but that's not what the low rating is for. It took us a minute to be seated because we requested for a booth.  We got seated and our table was half ""wiped"" down. Whoever cleaned and busted the table only did so on half, the part leading towards the front of the table. GROSS. We got seated but our waitress told us she would be right back to take our order... Which kinda of didn't happen that way. It was kind if a wait. But whatever, we place our order for chicken wings appetizer.. Only to be told that the had run out. No biggie. We ended up ordering the boneless. They aren't the greatest cuz the are overly breaded but we were starving & we figured... Why not??  Appetizer came out on a timely manner. They were ok. Nothing over the top. But tell me why the family who was seated in the booth behind us....& AFTER us.... We're able to order a gang of chicken wings!? Bone in!? We were told it was sold out!  We brushed off that whole situation. I mean, it's just chicken wings right?  We plowed through the appetizers and waited a LIFETIME for our entrees to come out. no joke on the LIFETIME!! The steaks come out and they were supposed to be medium-rare & came out more medium. We ate half of put plates and the side salad we had ordered still had not come out yet. Our waitress was nowhere to be found. I had to flag down the hostess and asked her to send our waitress in our direction.  What a let down. I Definitely did not have a good impression for my first time. We were told there were no more bone-in Wings, which ended up being a LIE. We had to ask for our salad that was supposed to come out with my main course. & we sat there dumbfound that nobody would give us a beverage refill in a timely manner.  I honestly don't even know if this location deserves 2 stars..."
Ryan T.,"Escondido, CA",7,34,32,3.0,2/27/2015,"It's Applebee's...  Quick easy over priced food while you dine in.  I had the pineapple burger, it was decent.  Our server, Amy was great!"
Elvin P.,"Vallejo, CA",24,17,6,1.0,3/13/2016,"Avoid this place at all costs! Waited 30 minutes for our food and when it arrives  steaks cooked in the wrong temperature, side dishes are all cold and sodas tastes like carbonated water...there are better restaurants in the area!"
Angela H.,"Richmond, CA",52,728,181,3.0,10/28/2014,"I think this is an average Applebee's location, no better or worse than any other. It can sometimes get crowded, but I think the food and service is just fine."
Ed C.,"Vallejo, CA",0,18,,4.0,10/5/2016,Good prices on apps and they arrived quick. Angel was my bartender and she was great. Greeted me as soon as i sat down at the bat and was very attentive. Good bartender definitely my local bar
Tuffy W.,"Vallejo, CA",108,6,,4.0,2/14/2016,My wife & I had a very good Valentines dinner the place was very busy but the food was good. We both had the baby back ribs (could of been bigger portions) but prepared well. Better than the last two meals out that were double in price. Will be back again.
Ariane S.,"Vallejo, CA",58,46,47,1.0,4/24/2016,"came here today with a good friend. we decided to sit at the bar because it looked pretty busy on a Sunday late afternoon. you would think service would be more on top of it since there's a bartender (there was 2!). um, wrong! we ended up with the worse bartender. Angel helped us probably twice without us having to call for her attention. i ordered a 7&7 along with my food. I understand the food will take awhile but my DRINK? I've watched her do her thing (put dishes away, restock the bar, drink her Starbucks) while I waited patiently for my drink.. she made everyone else's drinks (even people NOT at the bar) and completely forgot mines. I had to ask her ""where's my drink?"" and she goes ""oh my gosh let me get that"" took her 5 seconds to make it and I waited 20 min. she doesn't make her ""rounds"" or observe if her customers need something.  we were at a bar and still had to flag her down with only 5 other people sitting there too. pretty sad. she didn't even notice how there was cash and card with the bill hinting we are ready to leave. if I could, I'd give 0 stars. plus, this guy next to us complained to his very attentive bartender that his chicken was raw.... yikes. this place needs improvement"
Hugo S.,"Sacramento, CA",16,8,3,1.0,6/28/2015,Walked in with a party of 9 after leaving six flags and Applebee's was half empty plenty of empty tables yet 5 Applebee's hostess found it hard to sit us not worth waiting for something to click on there end.
Baileed R.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",5,38,,5.0,1/17/2016,"It's Applebee's - a franchise restaurant so service and food should come as a given.  Our service was pretty bad and the manager looked like he was in training or nervous but nonetheless, we (my husband and myself) were taken care of 100%.  Applebee's will always be a go to place.  Eatin' good in the neighborhood!"
Joe M.,"Richmond, CA",0,4,1,1.0,8/21/2016,"Simple and to the point they sat 3 other families that came in after me and my son, prior to seating us and when I food came to the table first to order was wrong then it was cold"
Julia P.,"Tracy, CA",42,12,15,5.0,12/5/2014,"Great place, good service, wished I was told about the extra baked potato with sour cream, bacon and cheese lol still giving 5 stars cause it was worth the extra 2 dollar charge :)"
Neene M.,"Live Oak, CA",0,5,,1.0,10/4/2015,Horrible horrible service wings were sooo cold had to wait so long for silverware  Horrible service won't be going here ever again
Mary W.,"Vallejo, CA",38,21,26,3.0,12/30/2015,"Food was pretty decent, wonton tacos are pretty tasty. Cocktails were good too! Casual and relaxing. But wait to get the apps for 1/2 off between 3 and 6pm"
Michael T.,"Vallejo, CA",14,83,102,1.0,5/16/2015,"I got a gift card for this horrible place.  Slow service,  dirty tables,  lifeless food and over priced drinks make this place a horrible NO! How they stay in business is beyond me.  Nice job Crapplebees!"
YelpersAnoynomus E.,"Vallejo, CA",0,8,,2.0,12/23/2015,"Have gone to this place a handful of time, thinking it may get better but it falls short. Food is either to bland or to salty. Service is not that great either."
Katy S.,"Sacramento, CA",55,56,104,1.0,8/2/2015,"Worst service ever!!! Waited 15mins to get water. We had an awful server, he didn't even say his name or anything and another server had to come take our water order. The first server didn't even bring us plates or utensils, but two groups came after us and he immediately gave them plates and water. We had a third server that brought the food out and was the rudest!  He had two plates of food and came to our table, I told him that the penne was to go, so he walked away to the next table and they said the food wasn't theirs. He came back to our table and yelled, ""did you order this or not?"" I said, ""yes it is but I just told you that one of the orders was to go.""  So he slammed the food that was for dine in down on the table and just rudely walked away."
A S.,"Vallejo, CA",33,6,,2.0,8/22/2015,This location has seen better days. Their service is super slow (even when the place is empty) and their customer service is lacking. I would love to see it pick it up a notch because I enjoy their food.
Amanda A.,"Brentwood, CA",3,28,,5.0,10/24/2014,"This review is for the service and the blondie dessert they have.  So I went here because I heard they still have the blondie brownies that the Antioch location discontinued.  I went to the bar and had a mojito and it was surprisingly amazing. Usually any bar I go to makes them like crap, so this bartender Sarah I think was her name, was awesome. Very personable! So then I sat at a table and ordered the blondie dessert. My server Ashley was very nice and was friendly despite my only ordering a dessert and more drinks. That's how I roll. She was super funny and my blondie was amazing.  Anyways, if you come here, I suggest you get drinks from Sarah and your blondies from Ashley. That's the way to live."
