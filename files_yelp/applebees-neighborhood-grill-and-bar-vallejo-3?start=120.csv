Uel L.,"Fairfield, CA",45,99,205,1.0,6/16/2015,"I used to like this place. I thought I'd give it a try. Lunch with my dad. I ordered an appetizer that didnt look apoealibg. Potsticker ... leave that to chinese cooks please. Then theres the bourbon sizzling steak. Well, I asked for medium and my dad asked for medium rare. When it arrived at our table the meat was almost well done and the other was medium. On top of that, the meat was a little tough. The steak knife is so dull the my teeth cuts better than the knife. That didn't help me cut the meat nicely. Yikes. O well, this confirms my gut feeling. I'm not coming back this way again."
M B.,"Vallejo, CA",71,25,6,1.0,11/5/2015,"Worse service I've had. Took 20-30 minutes to get our drinks on a not so busy night, 30 minutes for our appetizer. The food was mediocre. For as slow as it was they sure acted as if it was a crowded Friday or Sunday night. Will not be back!! At least not this location. Applebee's is going down hill."
Anna G.,"Napa, CA",42,23,6,5.0,5/20/2015,"I usually come here for the late night happy hour, I came here today really just not in a patient mood , not feeling well, and hangry (so hungry you're mad). Amanda, our server really turned all of that around. Immediately created a welcoming atmosphere and met all crazy demands like bringing us pickle chips over and over. The food was great, but the service is what made it worth coming back!"
George T.,"Vallejo, CA",1,14,6,4.0,1/19/2016,"Went for a late night ice cream with my daughter. Food was very good and service was fine. When 5 unexpected friends joined us, we were accommodated well."
Ralph R.,"American Canyon, CA",396,16,1,3.0,9/21/2014,"I'm actually giving a higher rating now than I usually would. I will point out my reasons below but first let me say, I do not usually come here.  Service: the hostess was a total bitch.. She rolled her eyes when we came in and asked for a table for 3. Most of the waitresses here have attitudes but who could blame them? They get trashy uncivilized Vallejo people on a daily basis.  Restaurant layout: much cleaner than I've seen in the past but our lamp kept flickering... I was joking with my friends how I could probably get a seizure from the flashing lights. Manager/LOD: no where to be found.. There should be some interaction, presence or table touching. The Food: it was sloppy and my chicken was over cooked, I had a hard time trying to cut into it! It should be flakey and break easy. It's a hit or miss. I've been here in the past and had great meals! Since I grew up in Vallejo this was always the go to places with friends but honestly since Vallejo economically went down hill so did this establishment as well..  Timing: Our food took longer than is should of taken along with the traffic within the room, it was not that busy at all.  Our server: Her name was Angel M... I think. Because of her I gave a higher rating. This girl was working it! She immediately offered drinks as soon as we sat down. Other waitresses I've had took forever with any drinks at all. Angel was polite and she spoke with full knowledge of the menu. She consistently came by to check if everything was doing alright. She surprised me unlike her other coworkers. I decided to tip her more than 40%... I am from Vallejo and if you come here I advise you.. When you park your car in the parking lot make sure nothing is visible! It will get broken into. A lot of car break ins happen at Applebee's. Be aware of your surroundings, I see Kids who have kids that are unable to behave in public and ruin a good time or meal for everyone. For the restaurant? For a chain company... Applebee's is best as it gets! The 2 for $20 is my favorite pick and don't come here for happy hour. They are stingy with alcohol! Go to Chevys instead if you want to get turnt out! But as for quality for chain restaurants in Vallejo I would choose Olive Garden."
Nichelle D.,"Gilbert, AZ",2,7,5,3.0,11/28/2015,The food was good. Our waitress couldn't not answer any questions  we had about the menu. She never came back the the table and checked on us. As far as service goes this Applebee's gets 1 and a half stars
Richard M.,"Vallejo, CA",0,20,13,5.0,11/12/2015,We have been here a couple times and been happy but yesterday was great! We went there for veterans day it was packed with a line outside. The female manger was so polite and calm it was good to see. The staff was working hard and food was amazing they couldn't have done a better job!
Sally C.,"Sacramento, CA",3,20,14,1.0,9/6/2014,"Now I remember why I stopped coming here for a while. Got the 2 for 25. The wonton tacos were overly sweet.  I ordered the Napa chicken with Portobello mushroom. Came out cold and the mushroom wasn't even Portobello. Friend got the sirloin steak was way over seasoned, but at least it was hot. Got the fireball lemon drink, but it tasted only like lemonade. It was a slow Saturday, I don't understand why things were awful. Waitress was below average, but the greeter was nice. She actually brought us utensils! This star goes to her."
Jessica G.,"Vallejo, CA",321,2,,1.0,6/15/2014,Worst service I've ever gotten in a restaurant.  Our server Jamie took 10 minutes to introduce herself to us. Throughout our visit I had to wave her down for refills repeatedly. It took 20+ minutes to get my well done steak that I asked to be medium. My mash potatoes weren't loaded and when I said something about the food being incorrect she gave me attitude. Then to top it off we sat there at the table with empty plates for 10 minutes didn't ask if we wanted any dessert and finally gave us our check and we sat there with our card on the table waiting as she's standing messing around with another table for fifteen minutes. I will NEVER go to that Applebee's EVER again.
Erinn B.,"Oakland, CA",0,6,,5.0,6/19/2016,"6/19/16, Waiter Rey was awesome very good customer service.. My bf wasn't satisfied with his tea so Ray fixed the problem an mixed ice tea with a splash of mango omg talkn bout good APple bees should add that to their menu"
Marina L.,"Vacaville, CA",0,1,1,1.0,11/16/2014,I love applebees. There parmasean shrimp and steak plat is on point and the spinich artichoke dip is my favorite. But today I got the mushroom swiss burger. Sounded very good. But when I had received my burger I had literaly one mushroom on it. When I had asked for more mushrooms I got an entire plate with a mound of them. As for the cheese there was so little it imediatly melted away. Gone. I also asked for my burger to be a little pink inside. It was given to me pretty chared on the outside and over cooked. My waitress was very nice and I could tell she was trying her best so I didn't make it a big deal. They also have a deal that if the waiter does not mention a gift card they will give u a free batch of matzorella sticks well... she never mentioned them. I was so irratated by that point I left. I was dissapointed and posted a pic as well.
Amber L.,"American Canyon, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/24/2016,"Drive on by. Do not stop. My husbands French onion soup was COLD. Service was slow & took forever to get our food. The place was freezing. We had the AC blowing directly in our table (it's February!) our dinners were ok not the greatest.  Took forever to pay. Their credit card machine was having issues. I walk up to manager at the cashier & asked if I could write a check. Nope. Against company policy. So he walks away & leaves my credit card right there on the counter where other customers were walking by to the restrooms! I walked over & grabbed my unattended credit card. My receipt finally prints out & I grab it to sign & get the heck out of that place! Then I get home & I check my credit card account & see I was charged twice!!! Call to bank to get this resolved. Grrrrr. Oh manager did give me a free appetizer, heck noooo. That means I have to go back!!!"
Rachel M.,"Oakland, CA",24,8,,1.0,8/2/2014,"Was on our way to Chevy's, but they were closed.  Unfortunately, Applebee's was right across the road. Bad food, bad service, way overpriced for the quality.  Rude hostess, terribly slow delivery.  The artichoke dip was OK, but was served with poor quality tortilla chips - then they charged extra for crappy bread.  They said they were unexpectedly busy, but more time would not have helped the food. There were two things that didn't suck. 1) the steak from the fajitas (nothing else, just the meat was good) was yum spicy & cooked properly & 2) the bartender made an excellent gimlet."
Jim V.,"Vacaville, CA",105,46,4,2.0,7/2/2015,I decided to try the carside to go service at Applebee's today. I called in the order the hold time was minimal. After I ordered I drove over to pick up the order. The lady said 15 minutes. I waited over 30 minutes. Almost went inside to get my order. The carside service sucks. If you want to eat just go into the restaurant don't order for pickup. The food was good though.
Bernadette M.,"Hayward, CA",610,652,1036,3.0,10/21/2013,"I can't remember the last time I was at an Applebee's but I do remember that I enjoy their boneless buffalo wings. My ex actually used to work at this location many, many years ago so it was kind of strange being here. The place wasn't overly busy but it took the hostess a minute to try to figure out where to seat us. I guess she had to scan the restaurant to see if there was an open table instead of knowing from her podium as to what is or isn't available. So I thought I'd save her the headache and just offer to sit at the bar. So my friend and I grabbed two stools.  The bartender asked us what we wanted to drink before we saw a menu. I wish the counter wasn't so sticky. Underneath the bar could use a wipe down as well. I guess some people know what they want to drink but I'd like to see what they had to offer first. So I asked for menus and advised him that we were going to eat as well. Fruity and blended drinks weren't for me so I thought I'd make it easy on him too and order a 7&7, while my friend ordered a beer. Pretty straight forward, yeah? We went with an order of the boneless buffalo wings in their hottest sauce, onion rings and I had a wedge salad. All of it was pretty tasty. And the wings were exactly what I remember them to be. Glad to see that's consistent. Football was on the screen so that helped out the experience as well. Screaming children behind us, not so much. I guess I'll be back for the wings and salad sometime."
Thegee G.,"Long Beach, CA",17,52,48,4.0,6/12/2014,Our server Brandon was knowledgeable patient and very friendly.  The food was great not quite as tasty as our Applebee's in signal Hill California but very good nevertheless.
James W.,"Vacaville, CA",0,3,5,1.0,8/29/2015,"This was my first time eating at the Vallejo location it was worse service I have had in any Restaurant. It took approx. 15 minutes before waitress came to are table to ask us want we would like to drink, we asked for cold ice water at the best it was room tempature with little to no ice. The appetizer arrived at the table just before are entrees which were cold and under cooked. Bottom line the food and service sucks I will not return to this Applebee's ."
Jared B.,"Berkeley, CA",0,12,,2.0,6/20/2015,"This is mostly a general review of my feelings on Applebee's itself. I haven't gone to one in years as coming to the bay area with all these amazing places to eat why on earth would you choose such a middle of the road, boring and tasteless chain. Some new updates to the menu but nothing seems to have changed in taste. I feel so unhealthy eating there. Probably won't be back for another few years. Good riddance."
Jason D.,"Napa, CA",18,17,18,4.0,11/12/2013,Gotta love the Bee's. Nice happy hour prices on drinks and appetizers. Try the quesadilla burger with a veggie burger and no bacon on it. Get o-rings on the side with BBQ sauce for dipping. You may as well add a side Caesar too... the bomb!
Lisa S.,"Benicia, CA",6,14,,5.0,6/3/2014,"We came in for dinner last night and while normally I think of Applebee's as being just ""okay"", we had an exceptional meal.  Our waitress was Lupe and she took care of my special requests without batting an eye.  My husband and I both ordered the Cowboy Burger and requested that the bacon be extra crispy and I wanted my sauce on the side.  The bacon was perfect....nice and crispy but not to the point of being burned.  Like I said it was perfect.  It was probably the best burger I've ever had. For drinks my husband ordered a Long Island Iced Tea and I ordered a Bahama Mama but they were nearly all ice and tasted very watered down.  When we finished our drinks the glasses were still full to the top with ice.  We ordered a second round and I asked that the bartender not add so much ice.  The second round came with maybe 5 or 6 ice cubes each and they tasted so much better.   We haven't been to an Applebee's in years and the only reason we went this time was because we had a gift card and I was craving a good burger.  We noticed the decor has really changed, all the movie memorabilia is gone and they're going with more of a sports bar theme.  It might get loud in there on the weekends and during the dinner rush, but we came early so the place was pretty empty. All in all it was a very pleasant experience and I look forward to going again."
