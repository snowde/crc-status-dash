Erin M.,"Vallejo, CA",6,14,,5.0,4/26/2015,Best Applebee's ever! Love coming here the staff are all awesome especially our waitress Sarah she was great. She recommended great food and drinks. Service was amazing never had to ask for anything. Then I came in another day with a girlfriend and I was pleased to see Sarah in the bar. Another great experience she was there with a smile and made us the perfect coronarita's. Thanks Applebee's for being our friendly neighborhood grill and thank you Sarah for excellent service. I can't wait to come back with my friends!
Eric A.,"Vallejo, CA",654,234,46,1.0,3/30/2012,"If ever given the choice, I will never eat here. Had a case of ""bubble guts"" the last 2 times I went here. On the 2nd occassion, I had the awesome honor of having a whole glass of water spilled on me. The waiter acted like he didn't care. I need not further elaborate. Yeah, nah man. Not coming back here. I'd rather eat at Denny's. And I don't even like Denny's."
Angela D.,"Fairfield, CA",75,212,554,3.0,3/13/2014,Food is just ok to me. Service was pretty good. Nice go to spot for bite to eat and a drink before catching a movie across the street
Anna I.,"Vallejo, CA",1,11,7,1.0,12/28/2015,"Went to visit Applebee's around 9pm on a Wednesday night because we had a $25 giftcard to spend. Ordered about $30+ worth of food and drinks and when we received our check, we put down a debit card and our $25 giftcard. When we received the receipt, they had put the whole $33.89 onto the card. I asked another employee to grab our waitress, Rachel F, and asked her about the giftcard. She left to go look for it. She came back and said she didn't find it, and left once more to look for the giftcard. Then, when she returned, she said, ""There wasn't a giftcard here"". I don't know what she went looking for those 2 other times, but now she was claiming there wasn't a thing. Asked to speak to the manager, Michael, who had said the waitress sworn she didn't have a giftcard. he asked what it looked like and we said it has an apple in the middle and $25 on the top right corner. He said those didn't exist (but I have seen them sold in Sam's club in triple packs). Then he said he would contact us about giving us a refund, but he would wait because with the holidays, a refund would take too long. We have not heard from the manager, nor have we received a refund. I don't know who took the card, but we were forced to pay the whole amount out of pocket, when the only reason we went there was because we had a giftcard to use.  This was a really frustrating issue, mostly because our $25 giftcard went missing and there was nothing the manager did to help us out."
Carlo J.,"Vallejo, CA",165,30,2,1.0,10/26/2013,The service is horrible. Our waitress had an IQ of a 2 year old. We had to pour our own margarita.. Wtf. Applebee's needs to hire better waiters. Ordered the steak off the 2 for 24. I swear it tasted like a dirty rag. Never coming back.
Ari S.,"Richmond, CA",4,32,6,3.0,4/8/2015,"Crowded, it's one of the few chain restaurants around the area. It's okay, the food is decent, standard fast. Recently they've been changing the menu, the bar snacks are the latest addition last I visited. They're good, but the portions were downsized, for instance they changed the number of breadsticks you can get, but the waitress tried to convince us they had always been that way (a manager confirmed our suspicions later).  Wish they would add more options to the ""two for"" menus!"
Roxell C.,"San Francisco, CA",200,47,8,3.0,2/19/2015,"This place is okay, nothing special.One time I waited for my waitress to come, but she never showed up not even to ask for drinks, and the hostess had to get her.I guess she was just hanging out in the back."
Linda R.,"American Canyon, CA",1,30,36,2.0,9/15/2013,"Telena what can I say, if you did not feel like working you should just have stayed at home.  We were sitting at the bar, and for the first 20 minutes all she did was text on her phone or lean over with her head in her hands.  It was not until a couple came in that she knew she became upbeat stating ""I am so glad you are here you saved my life""  if I had know that she was dying I would have offered to give her CPR! She was so busy on her phone she kept three customers waiting because she did not see them standing at the bar.  Not a smile, not a word and very little service.  With the couple that she knew, she was animated she discussed the menu and made suggestions, even saying ""if you don't like it I will take it back to the kitchen""  she never offered that service to anyone else sitting at the bar.  In fact it would have been nice if she had looked remotely interested in making our experience of this restaurant a good one.  She discussed with her friends about being up late and not wanting to come to work and she swore, now I swear but there is a time and place and this was neither. As for the food, it was ok but the lack of service leaves a lot to be desired."
Owen J.,"Vallejo, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/29/2016,"The service is awful!! Extremely slow and no ""sense of urgency"" at all. We had to ask for silverware and napkins. The silverware was dirty and still had food and grease on them. When my wife's order finally arrived, the bowl the Oriental salad was in was greasy and dirty (like it had been rinsed instead of washed.) My meal was supposed to come with salsa, but I had to ask for it twice, and when the server finally brought it, I was almost finished with my meal! The chicken on my wife's salad was cold. All-in-all; it was NOT a pleasurable dining experience. Dirty, disorganized, and and pain-stakingly slow. Time for a management upgrade!!"
Lea L.,"Fremont, CA",44,84,106,4.0,1/3/2013,"Been going here regularly for the past few months since I live close. Had one bad experience with a waitress named Miaa(I can never forget her name), gave us our check too early(we weren't asking for it and she just put it on our table without saying anything) and snubbed us afterwards, hanging out on the part near the door while sucking up to a couple in another booth, even though we wanted to order more stuff.  Other than that one instance, we've experienced nothing but good service. Food was always prompt and the drinks are good. I do have a bit of an issue with the veggies that come with the steak though; they're overcooked have the consistency of baby food."
Cat W.,"Vallejo, CA",242,73,4,3.0,9/29/2013,"So, I never really thought I'd have something positive to say about an Applebee's, but here I go: This location in particular has really tasty appetizers. I'm not sure what they do that's different from other locations, but every appetizer I have ordered from them has been particularly yummy (in a chain restaurant kind of a way). Their main dishes are a little more bland overall, but Applebee's is best for appetizers and drinks anyway.  I've probably been about 10 times, and the staff is a bit uneven. They range from super friendly and wonderful to kind of mediocre. I'd say that's par for the course, anyway. Service tends to be better in the evenings overall."
Lynnette F.,"Novato, CA",29,331,1051,4.0,7/26/2011,"This year we decided on a ""staycation"" and went to Six Flags for the weekend.  We stayed in a hotel, dined out three times a day, and had a blast!!!   Our first stop after checking in was LUNCH at Applebee's.  We were promptly seated, and our waitress; Adrienne was delightful!!  We were greeted with a smile, and everything we asked for was delivered on time, and hot!! As usual my Granddaughter insisted on ordering from the kids menu - which is less than desirable at any Applebee's, and this was no exception.  The chicken sandwich came dry, nothing on it - and I mean nothing.  A cold bun, and a lukewarm piece of chicken breast.  It didn't get touched. The adults ordered the two for twenty ...  Chicken Penne Pasta which is enough for three people, was great according to my sister, hot and tasty. The stuffed meatballs over fettuchine ... DELISH!!  More than enough for one person to eat. Our only complaint was the meal off their kids menu, and it was NOT removed, by the end of our meal, I didn't care, that's how good the staff was there. One of the best Applebee's around - love all the local photographs they have up; great history there."
Mina S.,"Antioch, CA",0,17,6,3.0,1/10/2015,I went with my boyfriend today for lunch ! Great customer service but food was not so great.
Davina A.,"Vallejo, CA",3,12,,2.0,2/24/2016,Just want to say if you travel up the road on HWY 29 and go to the Napa Applebees its like night and day compared to Vallejo's restaurant. The staff here in Vallejo are rude. Not to mention tables are dirty. Wouldnt suggest this Applebees.
Betty b.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,4,1.0,1/25/2015,"This is for the Carside To Go. These people need to get their stuff together. We waited in our car for 20 minutes and not one person came out to greet us. Called them and no one came out. Went in, and they ""lost"" our order. It took them another 20 minutes to find it and fill the order. We were so mad by the time they gave us our food that we didn't even want it. They should have compensated us. Lazy and incompetent employees."
Christina A.,"Napa, CA",20,19,8,1.0,10/8/2014,"Last night my family went to Applebee's for a quick bite.  We got there at10:38pm.  We were approached by whom I assume was the manager.  He asked how many, we said four.  He told us it would be a couple minutes, as soon as a table opens he would get us seated.  We said OK.  Five minutes later, we were approached by a server.  She asked if we been helped.  We said that someone was helping us but he hasn't been back yet.  She left.  Then at 10:54 a party of three came in and they were greeted and were offered a table right then and there.  Remind you we have been there first and waiting.  Up and till that time no one after the server nor the hostess approached us.  My husband told the second server that we were there first and she's says oh I can seat you now by then I was already mad.  We will gladly drive to Napa from now on when we want Applebee's.  That was just really rude."
Deena Marie B.,"Fairfield, CA",5,3,1,1.0,2/23/2015,We came here to eat Dinner here and we were waiting for long time OmG and the steak we ordered was cold. The servuce is not good and oMG i will not recommend this place to go specially when you r hungry already you got to wait long hour to eat wait
Carolann C.,"Vallejo, CA",12,5,,1.0,3/2/2013,when we ate husband got a steak that was tough  I got fish in chips they were cold and gross service was nothing to write home about. Never gone back would not even think of it
PR S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",4,22,,4.0,10/4/2012,"Living in Vallejo since 2002, I did not have a chance to dine at Applebee's, across from Home Depot & The Olive Garden !  An unplanned and chance decision let me to be pleasantly surprised when I went to get a good Salad ! The hostess Monique was sincere and took time to listen to what I was looking for and seated me in a nice place, close to the kitchen, the bar and a bit away from the crowds watching the football game.  My inquiry about happy hours was responded enthusiastically going over their interesting and fun happy hour menu and prices.  I ordered a Long Island Tea....Then, asking for a good ""green"" Salad, Monique showed me a couple of options and explained the ""soup and salad"" combination which seemed very yummy and healthy.    Other staff were buzzing around catering to any customer whose drink or food was in the pipeline ... they all appear to share all chores and care for service.  The manager also stopped by at the end and briefly discussed my experience and a request for a gift card ! Overall, it was a great ambiance, GOOD service, personable hostess and waitress.  The price was reasonable.   I will return again to try their happy hour Margaritas and Wings !"
R E.,"Vallejo, CA",0,1,1,1.0,1/22/2016,"Just got in from the airport last nite was very tired and didn't feel like cooking dinner. So my boyfriend and I decided to go to Applebee's where we are usually safe with are food. But our service was lousy. Our food and coffee took foever. Our salad came and the server clearly saw and mentioned no silverware was on our table and never came back with even a fork. Then our main server brought our coffee and set it down and never brought us spoons to stir so we sat there another 15 to 20 min. till our coffee was cold because no one ever came back to check on us. By this time we were ready to go. But was too hungry.  So I asked for the manager and guess where she was sitting on the other side of us at a table having her own party with a male companion. So once she got up she then proceeded to serve us, but then went back to her party. What ever happened to the manager going around to the customers to check on them and seeing how the food and service is. Start with her head and the rest will follow. The owner needs a meeting with the manager to get off her butt and take care of the customers and stop trying to have her own party and tell your servers to make sure the customer has what they need before they go on to the next customers. Have the host or hostess make sure there is silverware at the table when you are seated. Hopefully this helps. We'll be back to see. And what happens to offering to make up for mishaps so a person will come back."
