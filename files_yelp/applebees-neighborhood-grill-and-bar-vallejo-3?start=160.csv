Maria G.,"Concord, CA",69,44,40,4.0,10/8/2014,I was at Applebee's this past Sunday and it was an excellent experience the lady who was helping me was very helpful and checking to make sure I'm okay and if I need anything else. She's servicing by the bar and close by the kitchen the time was between 1:15pm - 1:45pm. She even recommend the zombie drink. Hmmm that was good   great job Vallejo Applebee's
Terri L.,"San Jose, CA",200,262,225,1.0,3/26/2013,"There are no vegetarian dishes! :( To tell you the truth, I don't usually eat here because I don't like Applebee's in general (before I became a vegetarian). However, when friends invite you to eat, not realizing you're a vegetarian even though you told them countless times, to places with a lack of vegetarian fare, the menu needs to be updated! Applebee's! Be more vegetarian friendly! Other than that, service was nice, but not spectacular. I did feel kind of left out because I'm not a meat eater. Not cool."
May M.,"Vallejo, CA",30,153,22,1.0,2/28/2014,"The last time I was at this shitty ass Applebee's was late 2012. That was because they just always have shitty ass customer service.  Now I'm back, right now, waited 20 mins to get serviced. The hostesses were very rude when we walked in. I just turned 21 recently and came in for happy hour and didn't really know how happy hour worked. I was given some attitude by one of the hostesses with brown curly hair. She told me it starts at 9, and I knew that but didn't know if I could come in a little bit earlier and still get the happy hour price.  Talked to the manager and he didn't seem to care.  And why the hell does it take 20-30 mins to come to our table to take our order? I should have came in at 8:30 if I knew I was gonna wait this much longer to get serviced for happy hour.  I understand that it's busy, but quality over quantity.  Never coming back to this Applebee's again because of the uncaring shitty ass service.  This Applebee's deserves 0 fucking stars."
Roselynn D.,"Napa, CA",296,20,571,1.0,5/23/2014,"this review is based on service.    let me just start off by saying our waitresses name is Shelby and she really isnt off to a great start.  my family and i have been sitting at our table for a little over 15 mins waiting no hello no nothing. had it not been for the people with me i would have spoken with a supervisor and explained how our assigned waitress didnt even know that we were there had i not asked the woman passing by (Catarina i believe was her name) who mind you was the waitress serving the two tables next to us who was constantly looking back and forth at our table just passing us by who not once thought ""hmm these people keep looking at me, let me tell their waiter theyre looking for their server"" no not her; she had to wait for me to open my mouth and say something. she couldve at least did her coworker a favor and started our drink order which mind you was just water. just to make it seem like we were being taken care of.  the place isnt even all that busy considering its a friday night. in the section we are seated it looks like shes only serving us and another table that has 6-8 people who look like they have already been taken care of as far as entrees go.  she must be tired, but can i just say i myself am in the customer service business and if you cant manage your time, multi-task and/or prioritize then you are in the wrong business. try something more slow paced.  then again her supervisor is the one who is really slackin off because he/she should stay on top of his/her people making sure everyone is being taken care of or needs help. so its not entirely Shelby's fault...i guess.  hopefully the next time i come back (and thats only when i come with the same group of people cus theyre the only ones i know who really like their food) maybe the service/experience will be better."
Amy W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",121,173,118,2.0,8/18/2014,Damit I only ordered my burger bc i thought it was only $6 today. I guess that's only for guys. Been here twice. Pretty slow service both times. Servers forget things. Food gets cooked the wrong way. Drinks are weak. Food is ok.
raven f.,"San Francisco, CA",4,31,1,1.0,3/26/2012,"Hubby and I went for a quick bite to eat.  Needless to say, we would have been better off at either McDonald's or Burger King.  The atmosphere is dark and dingy; I ordered a glass of water to start with.  I knew I was in trouble when I picked up the plastic tumbler and it felt greasy. To be on the safe side, I ordered a bottle of beer, pushed the glass aside, dumped the lime and drank right out of bottle.  Not nice. My lunch order was fish and chips.  Whoa, the only thing edible on the plate were the chips. The breaded fish was awful, very greasy, the breading just fell off the fish and the fish smelled. I will quote my husband, ""We won't be doing this again!"""
Briana S.,"Vallejo, CA",16,6,3,3.0,9/30/2014,"My boyfriend and I came here Friday night and it was packed. We were seated after 5 mins and our waitress came shortly after, we  ordered our drink. After 5 more minutes we got our drink and ordered Buffalo wings with BONE IN as our Appatizer. 10 minutes later BONELESS wings were delivered to our table by a different waitress. I told her we ordered Bone  IN wings and she said  NO YOU ORDER BONELESS WINGS. I asked her how would she know when she was not the one who took our order. Our  original waitress came and heard the conversation Apologised for the confusion and had great customer service the other woman was  very  rude"
Alex B.,"Fairfield, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/25/2016,"Ate and had a couple of drinks recently...food was ok drink was awesome. Complaint is that the guy that was manager took a booth behind me with some buddies and I could hear him talking to his district manager on his phone apologizing saying he couldn't control the situation blah, blah.. basically making excuses for some obvious mishaps. When he hung up he laughed and talked smack about his boss.. in hearing distance behind me! Then him and his cronies, got up and he introduced his attractive young female bartender to them as a sweet thing and how he wished he could have her ... but too bad she had a fiancé. He told her.. But just remember I'm next in line huh? She had a sick but compliant look on her face and just eeked out a smile. My waitress was great but I noticed she had that same look on her face too. This ugly moron is bullying and sexually harassing his employees and they don't know any better and/or don't want to lose their jobs. That's the overwhelming feeling I got from this place. Disgusting... guy needs to be reported by the employees. I stood up gave the bartender a separate 5 dollar tip in front of the manager.. gave  him a look and left. Wish I could've done more."
Kat S.,"American Canyon, CA",43,129,647,4.0,4/20/2014,"I used to hate this restaurant,and still i find only a few things i like on this menu,but,its enough to make me return...I love the chicken fiesta salad,and the classic turkey sandwich,also the Tortilla soup,shhh its better then chevys...They also make a really good Pomegranite margarita..i love the game at the table,keeps us entertained and the fact that you can order and pay with it,,way to make your restaurant better,,,my daughter loves  some chip appetizer that has i think a white fresca cheese dip,theres always wayyy to many chips and not enough sauce..otherwise you are awesome"
Winnford D.,"Benicia, CA",3,9,,4.0,11/9/2015,"I come here at midnight with my friends once a month atleast. I love the service they always give us. The food is MAMAZING and I believe the appeetizers are fairly priced. My friends and I ordered nachos, small tacos, and chips and dip last time we went. It filled all 5 of us, and we only had to pay $8.99 approximately! Of course those were only appetizers, but they were very satisying. They also have this exciting technological way of ordering; we order through these small tablets with a card swiper at the top where you can pay. Once you order your food on the tablet, it sends the order right to the kitchen. We received our food 5-8 mins. prior to sending in our order! We accidentally ordered a steak entree onthe tablet, however, they had already made it. We told them that we didn't mean to order it, there was no hassle, they said it's fine and took it off of our receipt. I gave this 4 stars because it took us a while before a waiter lead us to a table. Other than that, I highly recommend Applebees to anyone and everyone."
Tony N.,"Vallejo, CA",39,4,,2.0,9/27/2014,"Though have been a Yelp member for many years as it's an excellent source for 'real reviews', this is one of my few reviews  b/c my experience was SO BAD.  Only getting 2 stars b/c of my previous decent-good experience, otherwise would give a 1.   So disappointed with Applebee's in Vallejo. Have had ok-good service there in past but tonight sat for 15mins with staff walking around us and the 'request server' on their supposed automated table interface blinking and NO SERVICE while 2 tables who arrived AFTER us who were white while my wife and I are asian were helped. Then when I asked for a manager a shift supervisor was sent to our table. NO apology was issued, just a 'what can I do for you'. We walked out. Then when I called the restaurant on the way out and asked for the General Manager I was told he was there but 'TOO BUSY' to speak to me. May never go there again."
Yubana P.,"Concord, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/13/2015,"Ordered online for a car side to go. After my order being 20 minutes late (waiting for close to 35 mins), because they over cooked my food, I get home to find out that my meat was still over cooked. I order a medium rare and get a well done.  Definitely not making the same mistake next time, won't be ordering from here anytime soon."
Barbara V.,"Napa, CA",0,6,1,1.0,10/19/2015,Visited the Vallejo location on 10/18/15 the womens bathroom was out of handsoap and the hand dryer was not working and paper towels were not available. That makes me think the servers and cooks hands were not properly washed. Food took over 30 minutes to comeout and server was out of it disnt come check on us no plates for appetizers and no silverware was provided until we asked for it. We asked to split our bill and the girl charged the a card for the incorrect bill.
Eric S.,"Alameda, CA",2,18,,1.0,7/23/2015,Pretty much the worst service ever. We showed up and 4 cars in the parking lot had been broken into and windows smashed out on a Thursday night about 10pm. Then we go in and order two simple drinks..a beer and a vodka soda. And they tell us it will be 17min! Ha so we complian..but it still took 15min. Just silly.
Michael A.,"Stockton, CA",52,20,10,2.0,6/5/2011,"Food was good here. Service was excellent. Always attending to see if we need anything. Big ups to our waitress Dorothy! 5 Stars for her! But what I personally didn't like was how the manager, an older Caucasian woman, went around to every table to see how everything was going except for our table. Must of been wearing out secret Asian invisible cloak. Thank you to the company that made those just for us just for tonight. The manager had a hint of racism in her eyes as she looked through us X_X"
Jaimon M.,"Vallejo, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/21/2015,"Worst service, had to wait 10 minutes after requesting the server to get someone clean the floor ( fries all over the floor), how can they get a costumer/ family seated without getting the place cleaned not just the table-the floor too , never gonna come back, will try my sizzling bourbon street steak else where, my first bad experience at Applebee's Vallejo California....worst... Burnt potatoes wedges and steak for a medium done steak. The chicken burnt too, family wanted to send it back , I said it's better burnt than eating something with their bodily fluids slathered over it ...just don't come back again . damn why did I choose this place today ... I wonder how some peoples reviews rate the restaurant 5 stars and majority rare them bad, guess the employees started yelping too"
Diane L.,"Vallejo, CA",84,68,12,1.0,12/10/2013,"We've been to Applebees in other areas before and while the food isn't gourmet, it's always been fine for a simple meal or drink. I came home late, so my husband and I decided to head over  there because they were open and we had a gift certificate. We sat in the bar because otherwise there would have been a long wait. Our server was good, but the table runner was not. I asked for a side of ranch she looked me in the eye said yes and then never brought it. So odd. The food did not taste great. The mozzarella sticks had an old oil aftertaste. My pasta cream sauce was incredibly watery. And we were supposed to get late night happy hour pricing. But they didn't give it to us until we asked and then the beers were still almost $5 each. We had a gift certificate so I didn't make a big deal, but it was annoying.  And as we were half way through our meal two tables started fighting with each other. A man stood up and screamed at the lady across from his table, demanding to see the manager because someone needed to pay for his food - ""because of this belligerent drunk lady's behavior"" (she seemed quiet to me). The manager came out and tried to talk it out, and the two parties started yelling at each other more. The men stood up and stormed out and I assumed did not pay for the meal. Which made me feel bad for our server.  The bottom line is this is the first time in my life that I wondered about our safety in a restaurant. We are never going back."
Melissa J.,"Vallejo, CA",0,9,,1.0,2/20/2014,Horrible service it took 45 minutes to actually get a fork never bring dishes are or forks for the appetizer I had to go to the bar to get my own drink four times The waitress had a IQ of my two-year-old son I had no napkins  they sat me down next to a screening party of 30  right next to the kids table...The manager was even worse my sugar was low they couldn't bring me a soda it was ridiculous worst experience I ever had
Bernadette F.,"Emeryville, CA",27,107,12,5.0,5/10/2014,"This is a very nice clean place with decent food and drinks.  I did not care for the Margaritas in such huge glasses but Ok, just a personal note.  I am giving this 5 stars because of the GREAT service we had from a young gentleman named ""Joey"" (hope I am spelling that correctly).  We could not have asked for anyone more attentive and more helpful in explaining the menu and being concerned for us, as patrons of the restaurant.  Absolutely terrific and thank you, Applebee's, for your excellent choice of employee. We appreciated it."
Abby M.,"Bay City, OR",15,12,4,2.0,10/3/2012,"The waitress we had was very nice. However, I ordered the chipotle cream steak & shrimp rare and when I received it it ended up being way past well done.  Unfortunately we ordered to go and took our food back to the hotel (right around the corner) and I didn't feel like going all the way back, waiting another 20 minutes, etc.   Mainly my fault, but after a long day at Six Flags I just wanted to relax and eat some steak."
