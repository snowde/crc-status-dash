A. V.,"Vallejo, CA",152,54,,3.0,4/6/2012,"Pro: For a chain restaurant, service has always been satisfactory to extraordinary.  Most recently, the service has met the latter end of the spectrum.  At most visits, I have noticed a very well trained and friendly staff. Special menus such as the ""Bourbon menu"" feature presents a descent mix of chicken or steak w. prawns.  My other customer perk about the restaurant chain in general is a good balance of ""lean"" and ""heavy"" items on the menu. My personal favorite ""heavy"" menu items is the ""Steak w. Parmesan and Shrimp."" As for my ""lean"" menu item, it has to be the ""Oriental Chicken Salad."" Dates and families, if you want cost-effective American comfort food, you can't go wrong with the ""2 for $20"" appetizer and 2 select entrees.  I have noticed the steady positive effect of this deal since its inception.  Con: Chain restaurants, nationally managed will present general guidelines for preparing and cooking food. So there's no reasonable expectation of an exquisite dish to satisfy food epicureans of the highest order.  Bottom Line:  While this is no great local American food landmark, it absolutely has a friendly atmosphere, is a descent place to get a a drink at the end of the week, a satisfactory meal or to show your date how much you care to save $ while putting into action these nine words, ""I cared enough to pay for a descent meal."""
Kay A.,"Modesto, CA",168,130,39,2.0,5/24/2011,"It's Applebee's. You can't expect fine dining. With that said, I've tried a lot of their items and they always disappoint. The latest disaster - french onion soup. Way too salty. blech Applebee's is just another fast food joint. The only difference is that you're being served by waitstaff."
Antoinette J.,"Vacaville, CA",110,11,,1.0,7/17/2012,"I have frequented both Napa and Vacaville locations and the Vallejo service, especially at the bar, gets a thumbs down.  The didn't get our order right and never came by to ask us if we needed another drink.  In fact we had to ask for our drinks to be replenished.  I will stick to where I know the service at Applebee's is great and that's in Napa and Vacaville. I think if they only knew we are or could be ""secret shoppers"" it will raise the hair on the back of their necks.  The Vallejo location really needs to raise the bar on customer service and satisfaction. Will never eat or recommend this Applebee's!"
Rachelle K.,"Concord, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/26/2013,Loved my oriental chicken salad. Had a great waiter by the name of George. Was going good until the table next to us had a cockroach run across their table. I went outside and threw up!!
mario m.,"Hercules, CA",74,10,10,1.0,7/1/2013,"I was in town for a visit.  My daughter and I decided to try this place out.  I ordered a shrimp and parmesan sirloin for dinner.  When the food came, it looked nothing like the picture in the menu.  The sirloin was small and hard, I ordered the medium rare.  The shrimp were small and few.  It was nowhere near the $16.99 price of the meal.  There were other things that went wrong that day.  Let's just say I will never eat there again."
Katey L.,"Vallejo, CA",22,14,7,1.0,4/29/2014,"I give only 1 star because I can't give 0. The food here is disgusting it used to be good many years ago but it's horrible now. Not to mention the waiter I got was a joke why he's a waiter is beyond me. He was not attentive at all took so long to get to my table that I finally got my drink refill as I was paying to leave. He never asked how my food was which it was nasty the restaurant wasn't even busy when I was in there, the manager came to my table after I got my appetizer to ask how everything was. That was a joke I haven't been here for but 15 minutes isn't she supposed to ask about half way through my meal? This place is a joke of a restaurant why is hadn't closed down is beyond me I will never ever set foot in this place again."
Vicky E.,"Vallejo, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/4/2015,Went to Applebees the other night in Vallejo for dinner & noticed it seemed to be grungy. The menu was so greasy & dirty that I had to go wash my hands after handling it.  We ordered drinks & appetizers which took forever to come to the table. We noticed one server scratch her butt then went in & brought our food out. It was so disgusting we left after telling the manager who didn't  seemed very concerned!! We scratched that place off our list!!!
Steven H.,"Fair Oaks, CA",19,116,18,2.0,10/17/2011,"We went in with a group of water polo girls and parents having lunch during a local tournament. We were all from Sacramento. We were seated quickly and miraculously they gave us separate checks for about 20 different pairs. That's where the good stopped and why I gave 3 stars.  The server ended up serving all of us on his own which made the lunch over 2 hours long as he schlepped back and forth to the bar, register/order board and kitchen. I mean please give a guy some help.  The food came out sooooo staggered that many of us were done before others of us even got our food. The lady next to me never got her food. We asked about her simple order 3 times before it came out and by then we were all done eating and onto paying. The server took our separate payments and didn't return for 20-30 minutes. When we inquired with management we were told our server got kicked off the register for other servers to use. I guess it's fine for them as they got their money and the server got 18% guaranteed.   The food was gross to boot.  I mean it's Applebees right?"
Juliane N.,"San Francisco, CA",636,596,765,2.0,7/21/2008,"My first time at Applebee's!!! It's the same as Chili's and TGIF's to me. We came here after starving from Six Flags cuz the food at the park was so damn expensive! $30 for 2 boxes of Panda Express and one of those refillable cups with a coupon!  The food looked good and I wanted to try the quesadilla burger but instead ordered a bacon cheeseburger ($9) and BF ordered the Trio ($12) Mozzarella sticks, steak quesadilla tower, and Boneless buffalo wings. The food took kinda long to come and I was getting a little impatient. But when the food did arrive. I started grubbing like a fat kid eating cake. The fries were OK. If only it was hotter. The burger was like any typical burger. BUT I did like my BF's food. The Boneless wings with the ranch/bluecheese dipping sauce was scrumptious, the cheese sticks were hot and cheese was gooey, and the quesadilla was pretty good. I thought it was gonna be a small portion since they always show more on pictures but give you half of what you see but I was wrong. Lots of food!!! Service was friendly but the waitress disappeared for a while. I probably would come back some day."
Hillary T.,"Vallejo, CA",26,24,12,2.0,6/22/2013,"Went here the other night for happy hour, the server Maria was so rude.they did not have a happy hour menu so when I asked her what the deals were she was very vague. She told us we can have any appetizer for half off excluding the sampler and artichoke dip. then when we ordered the cheese dip she came back 10 minutes later and told us its not on the happy hour. I asked what drinks are on the happy hour and she said any margaritas but still did not give me a price. I asked how much they were she got snappy with me and said ""uh about like $4-5."" I understand servers must not like happy hour because it effects their tip, but what is the point in having one if you don't try to promote it. I was ready to have a drink but due to her attitude an vague answers I was ready to leave as soon as we sat down."
Lisa D.,"Emeryville, CA",408,34,6,4.0,2/1/2011,"I'm here practically every single Monday night with some friends for $5 appetizers (spinach & artichoke dip is a must) and draft beers ($2 domestic, $3 import). I've never had terrible service at this place. Also, throughout the years, Applebee's has changed their appearance so the environment is way more colorful and lively than what it used to be. Their maple blondie brownie thing is amaaaaazing! Everyone needs to try it!"
Joanna R.,"Vallejo, CA",122,14,3,3.0,7/1/2011,"They offer 2 happy hours, not just 1 and its the only place around Vallejo which offers a late night happy hour until midnight. So its pretty much the late night drinking spot if you want to stay local.  Not a fan of the food, maybe a select few of the appetizers like the tacos.. aaand thats all I can think of, haha. I like the oriental chicken salad. WATERMELON $1 JELLO SHOTS. Ask the server what flavors they have. Margaritas are not comparable to Chevys. I'm a lightweight and you barely taste the alcohol. Might as well order a virgin slushee drink. Desserts are okay.  Haven't had a bad experience with any servers yet. It can get really packed depending on when you go, usually late night happy hour."
Ligirl L.,"Pittsburg, CA",38,118,73,4.0,7/27/2013,"Nice place, delicious food, amazing servers, and good setting."
Daisy M.,"Vallejo, CA",244,104,,2.0,12/11/2010,"-Blondie brownie is the best thing I've eaten here. -The skimp you on the fries, and the entrees are small."
Rachel M.,"Vacaville, CA",2,4,,1.0,9/13/2013,"We've been waiting for over 20 minutes and finally got a waitresses attention to our table..... Busy night!!, but it's not an excuse for real slow service! On top of that, we got bon qui qui as our waitress!! Since I'm on a DATE! I'm a be NICE tonight......"
Stacey W.,"Alameda, CA",357,141,83,1.0,5/4/2010,"If I could give 0 stars I would. On 3 separate occasions, I've experienced horrible customer service and horrible tasting food. I wanted to give Vallejo Applebee's a chance because the one in Alameda is horrible, but I guess it can be consistently said that Applebees are a NO NO On one occasion, there was a switchout of servers and we were left with no food for 30 minutes. We ended up having to get up ourselves and complaining to the manager Another occasion, the steak I ordered was dry and way past well done, when  I had ordered medium well. The server forgot what we ordered and tried to argue with us. The server ignored us for long enough time that we had to walk to the manager again.The manager this time had to apologize to us and we saw him yell at the server.  I mean already I don't expect too much, but I just wanted some standard service.. take my order.. bring the food out.. bring my bill out and you know maybe refill my water once or twice.  go to olive garden across the street or even cha am thai food in the plaza"
Marie L.,"Vallejo, CA",4,12,8,1.0,10/11/2014,Idk what kind of monkeys they have working in the back but the burger I got was sloppy and the tomato was white. The waiters are rude and ratchet and I'll never come here again. Disgusting.
Michael M.,"San Francisco, CA",300,229,28,4.0,7/18/2012,Food is average but that is what you expect from a chain like this. Being served does put this place one step above mcdonalds for sure
Aileen D.,"Vallejo, CA",199,61,67,2.0,10/23/2010,"I really only come here for Happy Hour (The margaritas are pretty good)..The bartenders here are usually really fun and friendly. And I love the Blondie Brownie thing...So that gets the 2 stars.. Other than that, Applebees just doesn't cut it for me. I wouldn't want to go back there unless it was for happy hour/the blondie brownie thing. It's overpriced crud food (and this pretty much goes for all AppleBees, but especially Vallejo).  Have dinner somewhere else, then come here for drinks."
Bee D.,"Vallejo, CA",386,541,1513,4.0,4/5/2008,"Ok, it's not my first, second or third choice.  But it was my daughter's b-t's birthday and that was where he wanted to go.  It fits all of his critera: - BAR - DRINKS - SPORTS WITHIN EYESIGHT AT ALL TIMES He was hot for the boneless buffalo chicken and a 1/2 order of fries.  That and his cold brewsky and he was on cloud nine. My oldest freckle face charmer had the ""Asian Salad"" (they call it Oriental, I guess nobody told them that word is only used for rugs and is basically an insult?) and more of the boneless buffalo chicken. I had some frozen margarita drink which was really good.  Basically it was like a smoothie.  I asked and was told that I paid for the alcohol regardless of whether I ordered a virgin or not, so I had the rum on the side and gave it to ole freckle face. Remember that - you paid for it, so get it and give it to someone who will appreciate it. I also ordered the sampler for $11.99 with 2 mini chicken ranch sandwiches (tiny bun with a chicken strip, cheese and bacon.  Comes with ranch, shredded lettuce and tomato slice), 2 mini cheeseburgers (yeah baby, they are sliders) and a steak quesadilla number that was wrapped up like a burrito.  It was good and there was enough on my plate to wrap up one of everything for hubby who was at work. It was enjoyable, the service was very good, and the food was Applebee's.  Nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't ring my bell!"
