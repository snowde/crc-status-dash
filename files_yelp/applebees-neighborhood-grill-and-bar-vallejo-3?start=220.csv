Miss C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,58,,1.0,9/4/2012,"If I could give zero stars, I would. Sadly, we chose to drop in here after a movie today, to grab a snack and a drink. We were seated quickly, but sat for 15 minutes with no service. Lots of wait staff looked right past us without caring.  I finally saw the manager (older red haired white lady) sitting and eating in the bar, and asked her if we had a server. She went and found one in the back, and the girl came out and took our order. The manager then brought us our drinks and went back to her lunch. The server brought us waters, and we noticed after a few minutes  one of the plastic cups was cracked and leaking all over our table. But our server had gone in the back, AGAIN. We waited about 10 minutes, and I was able to flag her down. I told her what happened, she took the cup and apologized, and went to get my husband another beer (then stood at the bar and texted for awhile on her Iphone), came back, set the beer down, and left, leaving us with the pool of water all over our table...and went back to god knows where. We waited and waited and waited, and finally I asked yet another server for our check, which she brought us. The we waited AGAIN for someone to pick it up. Our waitress came back out, picked it up, and disappeared AGAIN with the check and our cash. Needless to say, when she brought it back, she got the coins left from the bill as her tip. We ALWAYS tip well, and overtip, but not this time. We tried to find the manager again, but she had disappeared into the back after her lunch (her dirty dishes still sat at her table when we left) We will never come back to this place. Service has gone progressively downhill here, and its no wonder many local Applebees have closed their doors. It's time to close this one and start over too. The pool of water is probably still on our table."
Virgo M.,"Bay Area, CA",221,767,81,3.0,1/25/2009,"I can see how the crowd changes here from daytime to nightime dining.  Oh boy...  Vallejo Cougarrrrrrrrrrrrs on the prowl.  Not us, the other lovely gals holding it down at the bar.  There were some male cougars sprinkled throughout as well.  Well, I guess they are not Cougars.  Just perverts.  Hey, I'm not judging.  I guess the only other choice in Vallejo is Coconut Grove so why not come here!!   heehee  But on to the review... We avoided live prey and went straight for the already killed meat listed on the menus.  I enjoyed a tasty strawberry-bannana smoothie, small, errr tiny, dinner salad and the grilled cheese BLT.  The BLT really surprised me!  It was on a marble wheat bread and was YUM.  And the bacon was thick, cooked just right and very flavorful. Two things kinda threw me off...the waitress yelling, and I mean yelling ""SH!T!!!"" when she almost dropped her tray.  But then an older man probably about 85 came by and checked in to make sure our meal and service was good. That was sweet... AND, the best part was getting out the door for under 15 bucks!!"
Karen T.,"Oakland, CA",18,52,1,1.0,1/8/2009,"Ok, so this is my FIRST and ONLY large chain restaurant review i will write (I see no point in doing reviews for big chain restaurants when they're all pretty much the SAME.) 1. they got roaches (i heard it from a former employee and i believe it) 2. service is GARBAGE 3. it kinda smells like garbage in there 4. my orders either take for ever or something is messed up when i get my order"
Brianna S.,"Tuxedo Park, NY",140,456,840,1.0,1/15/2009,"I concur with Matt.. This place is just wrong.. So wrong. I don't know what my friends see in it.. Why can't Vallejo chuck this for a Chili's?? That would make me happy.. But no, this is about Applebee's.. or ""the Bee's"" as my friends would put it. Pretty much.. the food has never pleased me.. ever. And anyone in Vallejo who has tried it knows MY Spinach Artichoke Dip is better than their hands down! Only thing I did like about ""the Bee's"" was their drinks... like I really need empty calories in my life. Where's my wrecking ball?"
Alexis L.,"Pittsburg, CA",90,22,3,2.0,3/18/2014,"My husband and I usually love our local Applebee's and even take our out of town family there for a great meal, however tonight was not a good night to be a patron at this well known establishment.  First of all when we walked in we were met with a line at the door, to which we thought we would be leaving our name to be called, only to find out that instead we were all waiting to be seated one group at a time.  On top of that our hostess was also cleaning the table we were to be seated at, she grabbed our silverware with the same hand she had just stuck into the water bucket to get the rag out of.  We exchanged the silverware and were seated, to which we noticed that the light bulb above the table was flickering.  When we asked for the light bulb to be either fixed or the light turned off, it was like we were asking in a different language, and it was never addressed properly, we ate by strobe light which was rather annoying.  The server came and took our drink orders, then brought us our drinks, and took our food orders.  I asked for some splenda for my ice tea, but was never brought any, my husband after the 3rd time finally went up to the bar and got me some so that I could enjoy my drink.  After we ordered our food, our appetizer sample platter was burnt, and then when our meal was brought to us and our food was not appealing or cooked correctly.  My husband had ordered a drink from the bar that was not made correctly either, but was never asked how it was or if he wanted another one, when he finished it.  Our server was not very observant about our table or the other tables in our area that she had.  We rarely saw her, and when we did she was not very helpful.  I am hoping it was just a bad night for the restaurant all together and that this is not going to be an everyday occurrence."
F R.,"Inner Richmond, San Francisco, CA",0,19,,2.0,7/2/2012,Servers tend to zone out and forget what they have been asked for. We have had to ask two servers for the same item and both had to be reminded.  It wasn't even busy.
Antwaun L.,"Vallejo, CA",2,42,25,5.0,2/21/2011,"Happy hour is a must. $5 dollar apps. Brewtus beer $3.95. Can't lose. Not sure what happens to my fellow yelpers. I love coming and always get great service. At the bar. Thanks Lisa, or in a booth. We are dining at applebees people! Be Cool!! Secret!! Leave your server a nice tip. Bet they remember you when you go back."
Matt G.,"Vallejo, CA",84,18,,1.0,1/15/2009,"This place has fallen so far downhill. Me and my girlfriend use to go here a lot. Then slowly we start noticing that the service was getting worse, they were taking items off the menu, and more and more we hear people eating there complaining. The thing that finally did it for me was when I ordered one of the take two platters and they bring out the mashed potatoes still wrapped in plastic!!!"
Mark Shane B.,"Vallejo, CA",94,11,,1.0,10/5/2011,"Service is way too slow. 15-20 min wait to seat extended to 40+ min, they skipped our name on the wait list, when we sat down and ordered, just way too long for just beer....no bueno no bueno!!!!"
Eila S.,"San Jose, CA",187,210,,2.0,4/21/2011,"I went with some friends for a late lunch. We were surprised to see that they have a new promotion of two happy hours! I had the rueben and my two friends both had the $6.99 soup and salad combination. The waiter was nice but kind of pushy. We had just been seated and he was ready to take our order. He also brought our bill just minutes after receiving our food and we didn't even order dessert yet. That night, my friends and I all had upset stomachs caused by the food. The two happy hours sure are not enough to bring me back anytime soon."
Kristine S.,"San Leandro, CA",37,118,32,1.0,11/19/2011,"I've been to different Applebee's and have always at least, gotten decent food. However, this particular Applebee's does not have a decent chef. The food was overcooked and mine and my fiance's entrees were covered in bell pepper which we didn't even ask for or want. The waitress didn't care enough to make sure our dessert was right even after we had told her about our entrees not being right. You'd think they would try get something right. Or, at least would show that they cared if it was wrong. Terrible experience!!! If you really want Applebee's, go to a different location, PLEASE."
Gabbi d.,"Los Angeles, CA",131,85,3,3.0,10/10/2011,ok so seriously there is a waitor at this location who looks like the guy who played fogell or whatever in the movie Superbad. We like to call him McLovin and as far as I know this does not bother him. McLovin truly knows how to make our group happy. Anyways... cool place for happy hour tho its applebees...the food is not 5 star-seven course dining. no sh*t sherlock... never really had a problem as long as mcLovin was the server can't say the same for everybody else.
Judy L.,"San Francisco, CA",371,887,9,2.0,10/9/2008,"Too much flare. The staff does not know what beers are on tap. And the food takes way too long to get to your table. Don't the chefs just need to defrost the food then warm it up? I only give this place an added star b/c the manager actually stopped by our table. I'd be more impressed if it wasn't mandatory - if the manager does not stop by your table, your next meal is free at Applebees!"
Allie S.,"Sonoma, CA",5,9,18,1.0,12/23/2011,"If you want food poisoning, go here!! I was deathly sick from eating here. Called in 2 days later and was told I would get a call from the manager-it's been 2 weeks and still no call!"
Myka S.,"Vallejo, CA",110,69,2,5.0,1/9/2011,Applebee's is always worth it!  It's been on top of my fave list for as long as I can remember!  Food is DELICIOUS!!!!  The price I'm paying for is so much worth it!  Applebee's has been and will always be one of my favorites!
Eileen L.,"San Francisco, CA",344,1307,15,3.0,6/21/2010,Just came here today for lunch . It was my first time at an Applebee's . I had the peppercorn steak which tasted okay ... it wasn't good or bad . It didn't annoy me in any way . Service was okay ... prices weren't too bad . 3 stars for being decent .
Travis W.,"Yankton, SD",7,42,,2.0,2/26/2011,I was in vallejo for about 10 days for business and ate here a number of times during my stay.  I sat at the bar for all my visits and found the same thing the whole time.  The bartenders showed no interest helping those around them. Kate had no intentions of delivering food or drinks. I had practically flag her down in order to get anything from her.  The food was great but the service was not.
Margarita V.,"Richmond, CA",340,180,490,4.0,6/17/2008,"I really enjoyed the service me and my 12 friends received even for a large group. The meals were great... except for one. My friend ordered the steak medium rare and she got well done so she sent it back but then it looked like a joke. Slab of meat and scoop of mashed potatoes 3 inches across the huge plate. It looked so plain jane. Anywhooo, i loved my riblets and fries... so yummy! the waitress ""re-ribbed"" me [all you can eat ribs] so i could take home leftovers [that is sooo not allowed but she was great!]... Only reason i didn't give the 5 stars was for the steak."
Kevin D.,"Vallejo, CA",111,149,22,1.0,11/1/2010,It's been awhile since i've eaten at Applebees and was looking forward to their new Florentine ravioli with chicken. Well lets just say we won't be back ever. Food was gross and the service left alot to be desired
Mary A.,"Vallejo, CA",135,50,249,3.0,5/2/2011,Normally come here for lunch when I'm craving for their cheeseburger sliders and nachos! Their happy hour menu is ok. Service here isn't too great.
