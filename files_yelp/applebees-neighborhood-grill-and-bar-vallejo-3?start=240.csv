Laura D.,"Benicia, CA",1,3,,1.0,10/26/2013,"Went with a group of friends from work. There were six in the group. The waiter was really nice but everything took so long. We waited 45 min for the food after ordering. Then only four of orders arrived. The two of us who ordered salad got nothing. The waiter said they would be out soon. The two of us waited another 15 min until the salads came. I had ordered the spicy chopped chicken salad, but the dressing was very sweet. After the long wait I didn't want to send it back and ate it. Not expecting to go back anytime soon!"
Sara C.,"Fairfield, CA",13,16,2,2.0,4/20/2013,It's okay but every time I eat here the waitresses look very tired and the floors are always filthy.
Kenny G.,"Vallejo, CA",53,12,,5.0,11/9/2010,5th Time now since they have changed Management... 2 For $20 Had a  Starter...Steak/Vegi/Rice  and Riblet plate.... Cannot find a better bargain for your Dollar... Good service again.... Naysayers thanks for your seats!!!
Ulysses P.,"Vallejo, CA",273,40,1,3.0,2/27/2011,"Remodel made to this place last year was badly needed. They did get rid of a few of the higher bar tables and replaced them with booths which I guess made sense. In addition, they have 2 happy hour times now. You'll see most of the V-Town heads here since they're open pretty late and have a lot of dishes & appetizers to choose from. You'll definitely run into someone you know. Food is still mediocre however. Decent desserts."
Pink L.,Bay Area,11,133,160,3.0,1/16/2011,"Food is ok.  I don't have cravings to come here for the food.  Happy hour is a good deal since you get full size appetizers.  I went here recently and the employees were very attentive, bit overwhelming since our waitress kept coming by to ask if we were doing ok every 2-5 minutes it seemed.  Anyway, I come here on occasion and I wouldn't diss the place, it's your typical Applebee's."
N J.,"Vallejo, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/27/2010,Our server was rude. Messed up on my order twice. My guest also died of thirst. Server thought he deserved a tip and made that vocal in the parking lot. Will never go back!
Tracy J.,"San Mateo, CA",8,21,9,2.0,3/28/2010,"I really don't know why I keep going back. I'm never happy with the entree the service is barely average likes it's a starting point for brand new servers. However the apps are generally decent. I wish they would bring back the potato skins then I would put up with the averagness of everything else. I just always leave saying to myself ""why did I go there"""
Joe E.,"Fairfield, CA",14,77,44,1.0,9/5/2007,"Twice is enough to know bad service when you see it. The first time we waited over an hour for water glasses. The wait staff was super busy and we got thoroughly ignored. The last time, this weekend, we got placed at a table that no one serviced. Finally, a wonderful new waitress (Lindsay?) came over and took our orders because she knew we'd been neglected. But the regular waiter never came and we got ignored by everyone around. We heard many complaints from the table around us about poor/ no service as well..."
christina p.,"Vallejo, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/5/2013,"We have previously been to AppleBee's and had fairly good service and food. Not today. It took and hour to get our food. My steak was hot, then when it cooled enough to eat ( it was served on a hot platter) it was overdone and greasy. The steak only came with fried red potatoes. The wait staff did not tell me that. I was celebrating a major weight loss and could barely eat the meal. Just how expensive is a few veggies or a little salad? The steak was $14.  Hubbie's fish and chips was ok, but nothing to rave about. How sad. It seems if you don't order appetizers and hard drinks, you go to the back of the line for food service.  We will give them a year, then try again.  I don't think that cook/chef needs to apply to Gordon Ramsey for a job.  Too slow, too much salt, too much meat tenderizer, and too greasy."
John M.,"Vallejo, CA",0,3,,4.0,2/7/2013,I frequent this restaurant and find it always to have great service and atmosphere.  Good food reasonably priced.  Great place to meet up with friends for a beer or two.
Michelle W.,"Daly City, CA",225,280,4,3.0,4/30/2007,"I'm not going to be very picky with Applebee's in Vallejo... because what more can you expect in the Valley Joe?  There aren't many options.   I mean, c'mon, Olive Garden gets packed to the gills at 6:30 on a Friday night.   Anyways, it was a Friday night, and I went with the bf, his sisters, and cousins.  We had suspected our server was on something when he kept making weird jokes, forgetting our orders, and shit like that.  Hey, we are in the valley.   I ordered a Apple Walnut Chicken salad, and I gotta give props to the thizzin' server for remember that I didn't want bleu cheese.  The salad was pretty good but I could whipe up one myself for less than 7.60.  Other entrees people got were the cowboy burger (not bad, and with a side of mashed potatoes, that was actually pretty good!), sirloin steak (juicy), bruschetta burger (pretty good), chicken finger platter (7 y.o. niece devoured that), and chicken fajitas (looked good too!).   So overall, not that bad.   On a different occasion there, I ordered a burger and wanted to add bacon.  The server came back and told me he granted my wish and he didn't charge me for it bc normally I ""would have to pay $1 for that"".  Thanks!"
Gisela A.,"Benicia, CA",24,22,1,5.0,6/18/2010,"We stopped going to Applebee's in Vallejo a long time ago, bad service, and the food left to be desired.  A couple of evenings ago we decided to give the place another try.  The over the door sign read ""Welcome Back"".  I said to my husband that if this place was still the same as in the past, well, then we'd never go back.  Surprise!  We were greeted at the door, had great service and a nice, moderately priced meal."
Eric M.,"American Canyon, CA",75,92,29,5.0,1/27/2010,"Had a stressfull day after work, went to Applebees with wife and kids. Feeling a bit upset when we arrived. I ordered a Beer and the waitress carded me. I have not been carded in 20 years! Really made my day and put a smile on my face. Thanks. Servie was great and food was awsome!"
Brett K.,"Fairfield, CA",64,30,6,1.0,7/30/2011,"Ewwww, so my friend and I went tonight for ""HAPPY HOUR"" ewww we were anything but happy....the wait was 30 minutes to even get into the place....when we were finally seated it took 15 minutes to even get our drinks. After what seemed like forever and a couple drinks later ""long island ice tea, holla!!"" I had to use the bathroom. The bathroom was so disgusting, it looked like somebody spit on the mirror, there was crap running down it like diarrhea....the bathroom floor was flooded I almost slipped and fell....the trash can was overflowed with paper towels....I told the manager and he said he would get on it.....15 to 20 minutes later I went to use the restroom again, DISGUSTING.....it looked like a bunch of DIRTY LITTLE HAMSTERS ran through it.....I told the manager AGAIN, he had the AUDACITY to tell me he had someone go in and clean it....IF I didn't laugh in his face......Ewww I won't waste my friends money on that place again....know we got the managers name and the number to corporate, I will be calling and making a complaint on the UNSANITARY conditions......If I could give it negative stars I WOULD BE ON IT!!!"
Eddie T.,"Suisun City, CA",0,11,1,1.0,9/10/2012,"This place was AWFUL!!! If there was a way to give it zero stars, I definitely would. As we walked in, we were greeted and seated immediately. Once we had our table, we waited 10 minutes before anyone came over to even acknowledge us. I am a pretty patient guy, but 10 minutes without someone at least saying ""I'll be right with you"" is unacceptable. In fact, I had to go to the hostess stand and inform them that no one had come to our table. We saw the server 3 times. Once to take our order, then when our (awful) food was ready and then to deliver the check. Overall, you can find several other places to eat in that location. Stay away from this place."
susan m.,"Vallejo, CA",5,8,2,1.0,3/26/2012,"Is it possible to give zero stars? This is where I got SALMONELLA poisoning  3 years ago from the caesar salad. I'm not talking about a 24-hr bug; I'll spare you the gory details, but it was very serious, scary, and lasted over 8 days. All the hallmark symptoms of Salmonella were there. I should have sued."
Elizabeth P.,"American Fork, UT",0,14,,1.0,6/4/2011,Waited for over 25 minutes for someone to notice my child and me. We were there for her birthday just the two of us and not one server asked if we needed a drink or even hello. They dropped us off and left us there to sit. I got up and walked out. The last few times I was there the service was crap as well. The service used to be good about a year ago. Not sure why it's gone down hill
Angela C.,"Benicia, CA",106,311,96,1.0,7/14/2008,"I hate them. If I could give no stars, I would. They have NO Vegetarian options. They are good for nothing and their portions are small."
Ricardo A.,"Vallejo, CA",14,43,1,3.0,2/24/2011,came here on a monday got a pitcher of blue moon. waiter was kinda zoned out  ordered the steak with shrimp steak was cooked perfect really good. usually when i ordered it is all rubbery but this time it was good mashed potatoes were good also but they do skimp you on the sides other then that it was ok i mean its applebees for christ sake not a 5 star restaurant lol
Denzo A.,"Oakland, CA",87,15,2,1.0,4/24/2008,"I moved back to Vallejo this February after five years in the city to save money.  I have come to the realization that money isn't worth being saved.  Similarly, neither can a visit to the good ol' Vallejo Applebee's.  My friend ordered a salad and I a pasta alfredo with chicken.  Our entrees arrived a good forty minutes afterward.  People who arrived there after us were delivered their food.  We were never asked how the food or (shudders) the service was.  The server was unapologetic, unkind, and a little racist.  The v-town natives might be thinking that I'm on my San Francisco high horse again.  Well, if dining in other Vallejo restaurants is similiar in experience.  I will be hesitant to climb down and might just gallop back to where there are REAL restaurants."
