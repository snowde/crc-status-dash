Robin L.,"San Francisco, CA",12,335,216,3.0,11/16/2008,"saturday night and this place wasn't even packed. The food was actually pretty good. Portion size really depends on the food. I had the chicken quesadilla burger which was huge, and came with a grip of fries, but were already cold when arrived. Friend had orange chicken bowl, and it was huge, never finished it. Female friend had a weight watchers steak and portobello which was tiny, any guy would still be starving after that. Just because the portion size is cut in half it doesn't make it weight watchers. Atmosphere was a little on the offside. Asked the waitress what she recommended, but she said she was a vegetarian and so she doesn't eat  meat, which doesn't exist on the menu. Other people were talking a certain way, not to be mean, but I think they watch a lot of mtv or something. A table next to us, their credit card was declined and the were scrambling for cash."
Rachael H.,"Concord, CA",23,30,2,2.0,4/14/2007,"HORRIBLE service. At least 3 tables around me were complaining about something. The grandma next to us actually said ""Did our waitress QUIT?"" hahaha. The waitress asked if I wanted my house salad to come out first, and it never did. Then it finally came and was covered in bacon and eggs, which I hate. Sick! I should have know since EVERYTHING ON THEIR MENY HAS BACON. WTF. The whole experience was just pathetic. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because the actual entrees weren't that bad. But still. Laaaaaaame!"
Ryan C.,"Berkeley, CA",22,96,5,1.0,2/22/2007,"don't go to this one go to the one in cordelia. Dunno if they got better management, but I've heard some horrible stories about their cooking process..."
esther h.,"Sacramento, CA",38,107,,3.0,4/19/2008,"it's applebee's... you get the same thing no matter which location you go to.  Let me just say, the ONLY reason i've gone here recently is because it was late, and EVERYTHING in vallejo closes at 9.  what are girls to do when it's 10pm and we just want a drink or some dessert to dish the dirt with each other over.  The last couple times i've been here the service has been pretty good.  Other than that, there isn't really much to review... it's applebee's."
Big Dog Daddy B.,"Vallejo, CA",0,11,1,1.0,9/10/2009,Sucks sucks sucks. The food sucks. They must have all microwaves in the kitchen. I said it sucks. I went to one in Napa and I have been to one in northern Cal. It must be a corporate policy to have food that sucks because it sucked in those two places too.
abby l.,"Vallejo, CA",12,63,7,2.0,5/2/2009,"poor applebees. thought it would've been one of the better places to take my friend out on a friday night for drinks.... first of all, the parking lot. NO LIGHTS ON!! felt really unsafe, especially with all the kids hanging around outside. good thing i had clear view of my car in the parking lot from where we were seated.  then, the wait. there were plenty of open tables, but i guess there wasn't enough wait staff on that night, cuz our wait was around 20 minutes.  then when we came to ordering cocktails, i was told they didn't have any bitters to make a manhattan or any other type of martini. weird!!! i guess they don't usually make that drink?  the waiters that did stop by to ask if we needed anything were great; really friendly and always checking up on our table....except when we were finished and ready for the check they all seemed to disappear. poor poor applebees. it must suck to work there."
Samantha G.,"San Francisco, CA",1,24,,1.0,12/21/2008,"The worst service ever! We got there and it wasn't busy but we still had to wait forever for drinks and food! We order soup to start and next thing they bring out the entrée which was cold! They completely forgot our soups, the entrée's were not as ordered! Meanwhile our drinks are empty and no sign of the pathetic waiter! Overall the worst dining experience I've ever had and I will not be back! The waiter finally came over at the end and said he was embarrassed and I thought I could care less how he feels, I was pissed! Don't go try a different one"
Jessica L.,"Vallejo, CA",0,3,,4.0,2/10/2010,"Review about an experience on Dec. 2009. I just now wrote a review b/c I went to another restaurant and made this restaurant just that much better. So. I usually come here for their new happy hour prices at night and have been glad b/c even a margarita would only be a few dollars. I'm glad that even in this economy, that they are still able to keep this restaurant in town.  I was just wondering though as to why they have a brand new staff and sort of miss the old ones. I come here often with my friends and have enjoyed the company of Remy (around Sept 2009) because her natural personality made us very comfortable and were not felt rushed at all. Oh and she was very professional about anything and if we did not like a certain dish, that she would immediately inform the manager, no questions asked. Another server, Charmaine, was always full of smiles which made the whole late-night dinner even better. She even knew what I was going to order before I even glanced at the menu! What a fantastic server. Of the servers that served me, I think she's the only one who did not stop by the computer  to talk to another server like others for even 10 mins! So that was a plus. And she even invited us back for another late-night dinner the next night. Although when I've asked to sit in her section, a host said that 'she just got cut'. Oh and hosts are also basically brand new so kind of different with sitting arrangements."
Nessim H.,"New York, NY",67,16,5,5.0,4/14/2007,i think you people are forgetting a small fact about this reviewing process. we're talking about applebee's. are people eating good in the neighborhood (of vallejo)? I should say they could be doing far worse.
