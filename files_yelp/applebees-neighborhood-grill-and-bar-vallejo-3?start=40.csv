Andrya H.,"Vallejo, CA",64,59,12,1.0,7/31/2016,"I cannot believe the ""food"" this restaurant is willing to serve. I ordered the pork chop with apple chutney and it was a burn hockey puck with three chunks of Apple on top. There was a burned zucchini, a burned squash & two chunks of charcoal that used to be bell pepper along side. There is a difference between flame grilled and I'm eating various forms of coal. You need new cooks Vallejo."
Julie S.,"Benicia, CA",17,23,17,4.0,5/26/2017,"Thank you so much Javi for your great service. Fast, friendly and great customer service. Summer breeze berry with an extra shot..hit the spot!

Anthony G.,"Tracy, CA",213,1,1,1.0,5/1/2017,"My girlfriend and I have been long time patrons of applebees and love their food as well as the experience (usually) but this specific place has ruined our love for this restaurant. We've gone three times and all three times have been flawed. The first time we went the chicken wings were stale and the food tasted terrible. The second time we went was during happy hour, we ordered the pitcher margarita and were basically given a pitcher of blue colored sprite. Tonight being the third and final time we'll ever go to this establishment. The waitress (I didn't get her name, mid-aged Caucasian lady) was extremely rude to my girlfriend and gave her dirty looks when she was ordering, then when she came back to our table she slammed my girlfriends water down and made it spill. She didn't apologize, all she did was have an attitude like it was our fault she was careless. We ended up just paying for soda and leaving, the service killed our appetite. I hope you guys can get it together so more people don't get put off from what usually is a fine dining establishment."
Luis B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,,5.0,10/9/2017,This Applebees was great they were out of boneless wings and they upgraded us to bone in no extra charge Heather our server was very curtious and Lori the manager really made our experience great...thanks girls
Tracie D.,"Pleasanton, CA",42,45,12,1.0,3/12/2017,"We waited 37 mins to get served and the manager Michelle rudely let us know that she would only give us 10% off. Which is ridiculous because we never had anyone come & check on us, the food was ""ok"" but the service was the very worst. Never again. They don't care about bad reviews and that's why most of them have already closed."
Paul E.,"Vallejo, CA",0,8,,1.0,8/21/2017,Honestly the food here sucks. Everything doesn't taste fresh or good at all. I'm pretty almost everything is microwaved and frozen . The place also never really feels clean at all as if no one cares.
Ron M.,"Clovis, CA",50,3,,1.0,6/21/2017,"Food was great, but our waitress Michelle was the worst I've had in a while. Don't know if she was having a bad day or what but it didn't seem as if she wanted to be at work."
Steven K.,"Benicia, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/25/2017,Sat at the table for a good 30 minutes with no drinks or anything. Not worth the drive or wait. Go elsewhere.
Gienel R.,"Brea, CA",0,8,1,1.0,1/5/2017,SHITTIEST EXPERIENCE IVE EVER HAD.  1. Server barely came to the table 2. Took forever just to serve drinks 3. Another server forgot another set of drinks 4. One of the servers (Jason) spilled a drink on me and said would get me a drink and didn't. He didn't take responsibility by not saying at all
Parker D.,"Moraga, CA",6,35,1,4.0,7/26/2017,"Imagine McDonald's. Now Imagine a McDonald's where someone brings you your food. And in this McDonald's is every kind of person you hope to not accidentally bump in to on the sidewalk of a downtown public street. Add the smell of cigarette smoke when you walk past the entrance and you, my friend, are at the great restaurant of Applebee's. I took a chance of clicking on an internet fraud phishing scam when I saw the advertisement for the ""Two for $20"" deal offered by Applebee's. But TWO entrees AND an appetizer for $20, I figured that was worth the risk of my identity being stolen by any Swahili ""Prince"" with an Internet connection. So Applebee's had successfully swindled me in to coming to their establishment. The food was too good for the price I paid. After leaving a $3 tip, which is 15% by the way, I went home and explored the deepest darkest parts of Microsoft Excel trying to figure out how Applebee's made money off my meal, but there was no answer to be found. I can't wait for my next visit to Applebee's, it's literally all I think about ever since I inhaled that second hand smoke leaving the restaurant. Would recommend to anyone and everyone, however I would also recommend leaving your wife and kids at home for their safety when you go."
Ashley B.,"Sacramento, CA",357,12,,1.0,1/1/2017,By far the worst Applebee's I've been to they can't take a order correctly at all what so ever and employees are rude they also don't know their own menus
Thang D.,"Riverside, CA",0,41,8,1.0,6/14/2017,"Absolutely worst service ever!!! We had to wait over several minutes when the place had over 10 tables open and a full staff working. Upon arriving the staff glance at us and avoided eye contact!!! The manager working was one of them, it took about 2-3 minutes before she said can I help you. Then, after the wait and wondering why we were waiting we were finally seated. Then we had two different servers approach us both of which didn't realize who's table it was. On top of this the servers all female staff seem to just hang out at the bar with the male bartender. We were listening to the table next to us and they were complaining about the service as well. If you like slow service and have time to waste this is the place for you."
Amanda N.,"Napa, CA",22,25,1,2.0,7/15/2016,"Did they get all new servers? Every table around us had food that was not theirs almost delivered to their table... Wrong food was brought for me and replacement took awhile so the rest of my family who is nice and wouldn't eat till my food got here, had cold food by the time mine was delivered. Overall very slow and poor service. Our poor server tried but still. Hopefully they get their act together soon as we were not the only ones that thought they were off their game tonight!"
Lysle J.,"Antioch, CA",0,3,1,1.0,6/12/2017,"Me and my family were just here. We don't eat applebees much cause well, it's applebees. We get in and get a seat fairly quick but it's super loud in there cause of the game on. That's not the problem, we expected that once we noticed it was still on. We ordered a 3 piece appetizer and then about ten minutes later we ordered our meals. 2/3 of our app showed up. Two minutes later my child's meal and my meal showed up while my fiancés did not. About 5 minutes later still no food. A few minutes later we told them to just cancel our last part of our app and to just box her food up since obviously they didn't don't make it. While all this is going on we are watching as all the servers are playing on their phones on social media, taking pictures and videos all while standing there watching the game on the tvs. It's safe to say that we will never go back again and thank you for proving to us as to why we don't go to Applebee's. The manager gave us a discount and apologized and said it was a computer glitch or something. No, your staff would rather watch tv than work."
Anthony G.,"Vallejo, CA",1,14,,1.0,2/27/2017,"I've been here a few times and all I can say is this place is disgusting and has terrible employees, there menus are dirty and so is the food. Plus the wait times here are ridiculous, I will never come back to this Applebees and plus the managers are rude. I ordered a burger medium well and when I bit into it there was no pink at all in the burger and I didn't even finish it. Disgusting place, spend your money elsewhere folks."
Andrea J.,"Napa, CA",2,12,7,1.0,12/9/2016,Worst experience we have had at Applebee's (we are regular customers too). Waited about 15 minutes before being sat because there was a list. Clearly there were a lot of tables open in the restaurant but they were all dirty. Wait wouldn't be long at all if bussers were on it! We sat down and ordered our drinks and appetizer. Our appetizer came out first. Out drinks took a good 20 mins to come out and it wasn't even our server who dropped them off. My margarita was incorrect but I didn't want to make a big deal. We sat there for probably 30-40 minutes and never got to order our food! He never came back to check on us! We paid for our stuff and went to Wing Stop. Can't believe how shitty the service was.
Kara C.,"Vallejo, CA",0,2,6,1.0,5/14/2016,"Came for my nieces both fav food was terrible, waited for 40 minutes for food when other tables seated after us were served. Manager is a joke will NEVER return!  Look how they served the wings."
Melinda O.,"Benicia, CA",34,8,5,1.0,1/5/2017,Slow service. I didn't get my drink till I was done with my meal. It took so long to get my check I was tempted to walk out. I won't be coming here unless I'm desperate.
Marcus S.,"Richmond, CA",167,135,308,4.0,11/28/2016,Monday night guys night out any burger on the menu 6.99 plus endless fries and cheap beer and football
Gino P.,"Rocklin, CA",63,94,61,1.0,4/10/2016,"Wow can you say the worst lunch ever ! From the horrible service to the tasteless over cook hour cook time food , terrible ! Last time I had Applebee's in Fairfield thought it was worse meal ever , well Vallejo turned out to beat them !  Only good part of meal was Michael the manger trying to make everything right , apologizing for lousy food and service and camping two out of 4 plates , for him is the one star . Save time and money , don't go here"
