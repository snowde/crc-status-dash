Phillip W.,"Jack London Square, Oakland, CA",54,14,8,4.0,10/31/2016,"Everything was cool. Food was out in a pretty timely manner. Jade is a bomb ass waitress. I do think the manager could take some hospitality courses from the floor staff, because Clementes people skills seemed a little off."
Joy S.,"Vallejo, CA",0,1,4,1.0,3/31/2017,Been waiting for an hour..had to call mgr for our appetizer and drink..server never let us know whether food is almost ready or not...should have just gone to the Habit
Michael F.,"Placerville, CA",2,9,,1.0,12/4/2016,"Went today for lunch.  Forty five minutes later we got up and left without ever being served.  We observed others being ignored as well. Won't go back to this particular Applebee's.  Looks to have terrible management, lack of standards, and poor training.  Went to Pasta Pomodoro instead. Great."
Jacob S.,"West Sacramento, CA",0,24,4,1.0,9/25/2016,"Started out good until I received my steak... cut into it took a bite and felt a metal object in my mouth that had just cut my mouth, took it out and it was maybe a inch long wire that I had just cut my mouth with.. I immediately talked to the manager who said ""that would be from our grill brush"". He took an incident report due to the minor cut in my mouth.  NEVER come here!  This was very alarming"
Donna N.,"Vallejo, CA",10,30,3,1.0,1/10/2016,"Save your money and avoid a bad experience. Drive out of Vallejo and go to Chili's, Lazy Dog, Red Robin, BJ'S Brewhouse, ANYWHERE except the Vallejo Applebee's location. The Applebee's in Napa is a better choice...that's how inconsistent the service and food quality is in Vallejo. I wish Yelp allowed for zero stars! Service: Slow, unprofessional, and clueless. Hostesses may or may not record the arrival time and guest's name on a wait list; these poorly trained employees try to keep track by using their small brains. Food: Often served cold, overcooked, and looking like a hot mess on your plate. It looks nothing like the photos in the menu. Restaurant: Tables aren't bussed right away. Empty tables are left uncleared for over ten minutes. Meanwhile, guests are kept waiting for over 20-30 minutes for a table."
Ashlei T.,"American Canyon, CA",92,111,94,3.0,1/7/2016,"After not having been in an Applebee's in over 5 years, I remember why I don't come.  Service:mediocre at best, which I am sure is because each Waite has way too many tables and no support. They added an iPad type ordering device but that removes service even more.  Food:still not a fan. Bones less chicken taste like chicken nuggets in sauce, grilled chicken is extra grilled and dried, the ribs are crispy, crunchy hard and no meat -not at all good. Although very saucy. I will say the bone in wings are good!"
Kc A.,"Vacaville, CA",19,49,103,3.0,2/22/2016,"The food is ok, although the plating could be improved. I love the 2 for $20/$25 promotion. You get 1 appetizer and 2 entree, not bad right? The ambience is ok, it has that diner feel. Filled with regulars, family and what not. It's usually very busy. The service could be better, it's a little hit and miss. You might have to call their attention for refilling drinks, giving sauces, plates etc."
Janet M.,"Clear Lake, Houston, TX",0,6,,3.0,10/19/2016,Food was ok our server was horrible we complained to manager she took care of us the rest of the night she was very friendly and nice overall a good experience
Colin F.,"Vallejo, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/7/2017,"Been here twice, and both times I've received terrible service. Working in a restaurant myself, I find myself more than understanding of the challenges that come with working in the food industry and customer service. Nevertheless, the negligence that they give towards their customers is unacceptable. I never was checked on after I got my food, so I could not get a refill on my water. In addition, it took 20 to 30 minutes just to get the check in order to leave (with the red light to call server on). This was the last time I'll be coming here. Worst part is that they were well staffed so there was no reason for the lack of service."
Bella S.,"Alameda, CA",1,16,,2.0,3/29/2017,"This review is about kitchen management, or lack thereof. I don't really care for the food here, but my kids like it. I do enjoy the cedar grilled chicken with quinoa, so I order it when I dine here. Today however, the chicken was served with a side of plain white rice, which I don't like. The kitchen should have notified the server, when he put in the order, that there was no quinoa. Doing so would have allowed me to order something else--or go somewhere else. Instead the server brought the rice, which I refused. The poor server had to return to the kitchen and then return to tell me that they were out of quinoa and I could order something else. By the time this all transpired my children had finished their meals. Placing another order, and then waiting for it, would have meant eating alone while they watched and waited. The server was a sweet kid and he shouldn't have been put in the position of dealing with an upset customer. I didn't order anything else, waited for my bill, waited for adjustments to my bill, then headed to Rubio's. Instead of eating with my children, I had to wait an hour and eat elsewhere."
Rose C.,"San Jose, CA",165,142,504,2.0,10/5/2014,"Good place, bad service. So my bf and I came here for lunch/dinner and it was already a full house. Football season I guess and we had to wait for a while which was expected. We finally got a table after 5 mins but there were no utensils or napkins ready at the table. On top of that, we had to wait for the waitress to get our orders cuz I guess she forgot about us. The grilled chicken wonton taco appetizer came out fairly quickly along with our two glasses of frozen wild berry drinks which were delicious! I highly recommend for everyone to order both of those. Took a while for the entrées to come out, they still didn't give us our napkins/utensils either, AND they didn't check on our table to ask how we were doing...shame shame...I'm sitting here still waiting for my food so I got bored & wrote this whole review but my food is still not here yet...a starving Yelper is NOT a happy Yelper...let's hope their entrées makes up for their shitty service. Ok entrées finally came & the bourbon chicken/shrimp was good...nicely grilled and came out on a hot plate that kept it sizzling. Succulent shrimp with sliced potatoes went well with the juicy chicken breast. The other dish we ordered was chicken freshcato & that plate was fulfilling. The sauté veggies and cucumbers were to die for...I can eat it all day! The rice was nicely cooked and not grainy at all. Chicken breast was lightly grilled and it was still juicy and went fairly well with the pineapple slices for a sweet/savory flavor. Anyways, as I said before, awesome food but shitty service...what a shame."
Andrea G.,"Stockton, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/25/2016,Food was great and Autumn was an excellent server. Lacey did a really good job in backing her up as her trainer. We done to those two ladies. I was really impressed.
Darren A.,"Vallejo, CA",117,39,62,1.0,12/24/2015,Wow..the worst. Left my $25 gift card and debit card to pay for my bill. I came back and they charged full amount on my debit card. What happened to my $25 gift card? They lost it on the way. How the hell do to lose my giftcard?!?! Server explained she never got a giftcard even though she went back looking for it.  Never again Vallejo Applebees....
Paula G.,"Dallas, OR",7,136,2,4.0,9/13/2016,"Upon arrival at about 10pm, we were told all appetizers were half off- needless to say our party all got appetizers which were good, especially the nachos. One in our party got a burger and it appeared the size of a large grinder....very small and not worth the $. Our server was ok but had a mousy voice, he spoke so softly it was hard to hear. Overall good food, service, price."
Jules G.,"Vallejo, CA",23,13,11,1.0,7/5/2016,This is the second time we've been here and found the service and food to be subpar. Which means we will not be coming here again! The place was understaffed and the wait times were ridiculous. Our server tried her best but she was waiting on so many tables! The food was not good! French Onion soup was cold! If it's done properly it should be piping hot but it either was left on the side until someone could bring it to us or it was made earlier and they tried to heat it up but it didn't work. The soda I ordered tasted of dirty pipes too which is probably why I was unwell the following day! I've been to other Applebee's without any problems but this one is terrible! Only one star cause I can't give it lower!
Nicole T.,"Petaluma, CA",7,29,3,5.0,7/30/2016,"I came in here on my way to a destination for some coffee & small plates. I was graced with the best service I think I've experienced at an Applebee's establishment this far. Willie served me as a 1-top, and as a fellow server, I could only imagine the feelings he thought wasting his time waiting on 1 person. I didn't feel like any of the feelings or stereotypes I was scared he might have felt, and I definitely felt special. He was very polite & courteous, genuine & sweet and brought everything promptly & fresh (to what I imagine it is haha). Thank you, Willie for an excellent experience here & I'll definitely be back! :)"
Constantine C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,17,,1.0,5/14/2016,"We've dined here many times. Has always been the chill place to go when we want decent American food. Our recent experience left much to be desired. One word - disappointed on many fronts. We believe it's not an personnel problem but a management problem -- they haven't trained their servers how to be decent servers. Our server was great - nice and personable but our food was served without being given eating utensils (that is a given when you want to eat at a restaurant). We could have eaten our steaks and salads with our hands but that would have been a mess. What bothered me most was having to ask for the utensils. Also, a dish that we didn't order was delivered to our table so we sent it back. What was pretty terrible was three tables around us were also delivered wrong food to only be taken back. I'm never this difficult when at a restaurant but having to wave down our waiter for water refills twice AND our check is unacceptable. To cap our fun night off, our waiter waited while I finished signing the bill and adding the tip -- Talk about being on the spot for adding a tip. He was watching me while I filled it out. Awkward and uncomfortable. As much as we've enjoyed our visits to Applebee's I don't think we'll return again."
Amado Adam L.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,2,1.0,8/14/2016,"Did not offer my niece a booster seat, took 20 mins just to get greeted by server and drinks, served my boneless wings with no buffalo when they offered it, no ranch or no blue cheese. I went outside to talk to my niece because she was misbehaving and came back my food and Simones food was gone!! Why would you that?? They said they thought we left! I'm never coming back!!"
Bob F.,"San Francisco, CA",2,10,,1.0,7/5/2015,"Food was ok and our server was very nice... Our car was broken into in the Applebee's parking lot and a number of our possessions were stolen. Apparently thefts happen nearly every other night and Applebee's has not paid to install security cameras or at least warn their patrons! I was really disappointed in how management handled our situation, especially with awareness of the frequency of these events."
Victor P.,"American Canyon, CA",3,6,,1.0,5/25/2016,Thought improvement might happen from my last visit 3 months ago......nope walk in not busy at all there was a group of 4 waiting also and was asked to wait 5min...tick tock...NOPE we walked out. Lots of tables open .. Seems like Applebees dont care. Going to get dinner elsewhere.
