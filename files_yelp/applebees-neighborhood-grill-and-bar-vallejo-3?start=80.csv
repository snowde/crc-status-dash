Karmen D.,"Walnut Creek, CA",234,106,346,4.0,6/24/2014,"Definitely 4 stars for Applebee's in Vallejo! Plenty of parking. Friendly staff and efficient service.  We went around 10pm Friday night and the place was rolling. We sat in the bar area and the two female bartenders were excellent. They told us about the happy hour specials and their favorites which we appreciated.  They  also offer a good variety of healthy choices for dining and drinking.  I got the Chicken Freshcado: Fire-grilled chicken breast gets a topping of avocado relish and is served with white rice. We've loaded this dish with avocado, pineapple, peppers, onions, sliced zucchini, cucumbers and more. Only 440 CALORIES and apart of the 2 for $20 menu. Delicious might I add. The grilled chicken won ton tacos are an appetizer must! And the long island teas are stiff and only $3.69 (22oz)"
Gwen N.,"Lubbock, TX",2,27,1,2.0,7/19/2015,"I've been coming to this restaurant for over a year, and it seems that over the past two or so months the service seems to be going downhill.  I ordered the Kobe meatballs - which are very good - and a small Caesar salad.  The meatballs came, but no salad.  Since today was a nasty hot day, I decided I could live without the salad since the heat had zapped my appetite.  Sat for a good 10 minutes waiting for the server to pick up my payment.  From start to finish, a simple no-frills meal of 3 meatballs took 1 hour, 20 minutes. Next time I'll make the drive through the back streets to get to the restaurants on First Street in Benicia."
Raquel G.,"Fairfield, CA",29,1,1,1.0,4/24/2016,When we 1st walked in we were immediately greeted and while they were getting our table for 7 ready they came over 2x and said they were getting everything ready. All around great serves!!!    Everything after that was terrible service! It took over 1 hr to get our food. Only after complaining to the manager did they bring out 1/2 our orders. Then about 20min later we asked for the remaining food and they told us they ran out of the 2 appetizers (green beans) we were waiting on and they had not made the other 2 plates we ordered  (rib basket and bourbon steak). After another 20min wait we finally got the steak and ribs. Then it took another 15min to get to go boxes and the checks. We were in this restaurant for aboit 2.5 hrs
donna s.,"Vallejo, CA",0,8,2,1.0,5/5/2016,Curbside service sucks 30 min wait after posted pickup time. Nobody's in charge. If I hadn't prepaid online never would have waited.
Crystal B.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/4/2015,"I don't normally leave bad reviews, but will preface this with the statement that the food was fine (when we finally got it) and the management seemed to be receptive to our complaints and apologetic.  About a month ago, my friends and I had spent the day at Discovery Kingdom and stopped off for dinner before the long drive home. The restaurant was busy so we were being patient, but as the time went on, we had not even had our drink order taken after an hour of being seated at the table. There were some electronic menus set out on the table that we kept trying to use, but they were broken. Kind of a tease...  We were really getting hungry and seeking for help. We found someone in an apron to talk to, but he ended up being from another restaurant on break to visit his friend! Even he was more helpful than the staff at Applebee's!!  When a waitress finally came over to take our drink orders (and dinner orders at the same time), she was incredibly rude and rolled her eyes at us when we commented on the long wait. I have worked in customer service for a long time and couldn't believe her attitude. When we finally got our food, it was fine and up to Applebee's standard quality, but the waitress never came back to our table to refill drinks or give us the bill. We had to find a manager to pay. Needless to say, we paid our bill, but left her no tip. I hope the waitress found a new job because customer service was definitely not her strong point."
Shante G.,"Vallejo, CA",167,41,76,1.0,4/30/2015,"After a long busy day I thought it would be a nice evening to go out with my family and friends to enjoy a few drinks and a nice dinner.  How I regret coming to the Applebee's in Vallejo.  To start things off, our waitress must have had a horrible day because she did not hide the fact that she was not happy.  We were greeted with such attitude we were blown away! We asked for a few extra slices of lemon... not too much to ask for right? .... wrong! Our waitress Leslie rolled her eyes almost as if she was completely annoyed..       Finally our dinner came..... The salsa was frozen!! Completely frozen!! We asked to speak to the manager  Alison and when she came her only response was, ""do you want a another serving of salsa?"" ""Do you want to me to remove the plate away from you"" .... wow!!!  Seeing as we hadn't eaten all day we were very hungry. We said we will eat it.      My mother and I had ordered the same meal ""Fiesta Lime Chicken"" my mother went to put sour cream on her chicken only to find a huge chunk of something and once again we had to call a manager Alison over. She picked it out of the sour cream and said  ""Oh it's a potatoe"" ...a potatoe?!? Mind you our meal had no potatoes at all.... So we asked how did something like that happen. As she shrugged her shoulders she said ""maybe a piece of potatoe  happened to fall in our jar of sour cream""     Ok ..... maybe. But then please explain how two huge chunks of potatoes ""happened"" to fall in both my plate of sour cream and my mother's sour cream. It was at that time that she (Alison the Manager)  looked at us and finally apologized.     Needless to say we will never ever come back here again. What a huge disappointment.  This place definitely needs a refresher course in customer service and maybe a reminder NOT to serve frozen salsa and also to keep the potatoes OUT of the sour cream."
Alvin C.,"American Canyon, CA",7,137,426,3.0,10/26/2015,"This is my first time giving a review for this Applebees location after returning numerous times. The food is average but sometimes below average in quality. Service is hit or miss. Today, the food was ok and the service was slow. Our orders was taken quickly but when when it arrived, we needed some ranch dip and to mention that there were only 2 pieces of mushrooms in one of the burger. Our waitress said she'll bring out some ranch and additional mushrooms. The ranch came about 5-8min later when we were half way finish with our burgers. The additional mushrooms came when my wife was almost finish with her burger.  Maybe service was bad because we were there for their burger and fries Monday special. Is that a good reason not to give excellent customer service?  Service is not always like this...so we roll the dice.  Monday evening is $6.99 for burger and fries. Very good price for their burger and fries."
Kim M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,35,7,1.0,10/9/2015,I don't know why it takes an act of congress to get a refill on your tea. I quit going to Napa location because they did it repeatedly. Contacted the company even.  So I thought I'd try a different location because I really do love the burgers. I asked for tea to go since it was never refilled while I was eating. Waitress never brought it. Another waitress finally saw me irritated and went to get me a tea.  I'd advise you people to bring a bottle of water with you otherwise you will die of thirst!!!!
Darlene B.,"Danville, CA",4,30,2,4.0,5/14/2016,"Our food was good, but our server Delvon was so wonderfully engaging and personable, it made our dining experience  so much more pleasant....."
Jose G.,"Hayward, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/25/2016,"This is my Firts  And last time here , when we came here we were waiting so long just for the drinks and I call the waitress to check my order after that she brought my food . But incomplete we didn't get the appetizer and the food  it doesn't has the fries. :-( We never come back again :-("
BellaLissa B.,"San Francisco, CA",8,99,20,3.0,4/24/2015,Hi y'alI'm here at Applebee's because they advertise that they have a great deal. I know appetizer and two entrées for 20 bucks. Plus Happy hour from 3 to 6 featuring margaritas which I'm in the mood for... BUT and that's a big butt Dottie.   The problem is that we got our appetizer and we started on it we were not finished with it and then our meal came so we had absolutely nothing in between the appetizer in the meal and that made me feel rushed. I do not like feeling rushed.  The drinks at happy hour or $3.59 if you order what's on the happy hour menu which happened to be margaritas which happens to be when I'm in the mood for BUT there is almost no alcohol in that drink. I ordered a shot which cost 10 bucks. Yes Dottie 10 bucks! So the bill was nearly $50 when we finished which is a piss her to say the least because I came here because they have happy hour and because they have a special which is two entrées and one appetizer for 20 bucks. There is a hole in that bucket.
Hanz W.,"Benicia, CA",170,3,,5.0,3/21/2016,"Started coming here more often, and I'm starting to really like coming here great drinks. The bartender Lisa is super awesome, very friendly and always has a smile on her face. I will fersure keep coming back!!!!!"
Regina R.,"Vallejo, CA",7,2,,1.0,5/12/2016,"Today i just wanted to surprise my son who had a bad day at school with a cheese burger and fries meal off the kids menu... I tried calling but nobody answered the phone . So I drove  to the location  and had to put my order in  twice ...40 minutes later, after sitting there annoyed and having to listen to the hosts complain about the place out loud behind a menu.... I'm informed my order will be checked on. Seriously? When I walked in it wasn't busy, but I watched it fill up as I waited patiently for so long to be acknowledged about my kids meal to-go order. No word after my order was ""checked"" on. So I took it upon myself to ask about my order and I was told it might be ready sometime soon. I just walked out. Customer service is horrible. -0  I totally remember why I avoid this place. It sucks."
Alliver V.,"San Francisco, CA",599,245,104,3.0,6/27/2014,"When you are in Vallejo, this is the go to spot for any occasion. Everybody in Vallejo know of the Applebees in Vallejo. Celebrated different kinds of occasions here from birthdays to welcome home to going aways haha This place is okay, a place to chill, eat, drink, and catch up with friends. I'd come here if I have to, but Applebees wouldn't be my first, second, or third choice of going somewhere to eat. Actually, i'd come here with my friends for the happy hour specials, but not often or frequently, just on rare occasions."
Christy R.,"Benicia, CA",187,3,1,4.0,3/2/2016,Bartender Malia was amazing! customer service skills a 10 she is wonderful walked in made sure we had what we needed being a bartender myself she rocks.
Cecilia C.,"Vallejo, CA",0,1,,5.0,5/7/2016,"Just ordered take out. I questioned it at first considering the existing negative Yelp reviews, however, the second I walked in the door I was greeted by a waiter, then a manager. Within less than 10 minutes I was approached at least five times by Applebee's employees, and the lady helping me with my take out order had such a kind heart. I observed the hostesses assist each party, including one of 15 that came in, and did not anyone. I was highly impressed and taken back by their customer service. Way to step it up Applebee's!"
Juanita J.,"Vallejo, CA",0,3,3,1.0,2/29/2016,"I was very disappointed  with my service yesterday.  No. -1,  I had to ask for utensils, No.- 2 when I finally received the utensils, they were dirty.  No. - 3, my oriental chicken salad, (chicken was cold) I had to send it back, because it was placed in a very dirty dish.  Even if a person was blind, you could feel the grit around and underneath the dish.  Heads up if this service continues, your company will be in the same predicament as Chipotle Restaurant."
Kenny G.,"Vallejo, CA",21,10,3,5.0,2/2/2015,Like my last review!  Fantastic Dinner Again with outstanding 5 Star service ! Lacy is the best! Ask for her! Great service!
N G.,"Vallejo, CA",2,61,2,2.0,3/28/2016,"Slow service. Often overlooked by waiters and do not get drink refills as needed. Often have food incorrectly prepared, including raw bacon, overcooked/burnt steaks."
Kia P.,"South San Francisco, CA",186,15,5,1.0,2/14/2016,ONLY giving a star because I have to. The staff is a joke. The manager is unprofessional. REMEMBER the customer is always right. So don't try and prove a point to a customer that's upset!  The staff is incompetent and definitely need more training. You lost a big party due to lack of customer service . A big party leaving because of poor customer service loses revenue for the company but obviously this Applebee's does not care about that. You need to hire a new manager.
