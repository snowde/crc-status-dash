Derrick J.,"Williamsburg - South Side, Brooklyn, NY",7,23,213,4.0,12/6/2017,"Well. After reading all the negative reviews, I still decided to have lunch here because it was the closest restaurant at the time.   Service: decent. I mean it's Applebee's.   Food:  decent .. it's Applebee's.  Didn't see rude servers, didn't see garbage or the floor, didn't see faces of patrons frowning from bad food.  Starting to think that expectations are way to high if you eating at a chain restaurant having a dollar Long Island ice tea and two for twenty bucks entrees!!  It's what to be expected.  It was pleasant"
Robert D.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,2,2,1.0,12/20/2017,"I was not even greeted by the bartender. I only ordered an appetizer, which I cancelled after an hour wait!! No apology, nothing...so frustrating@"
Candra S.,"SAINT ALBANS, NY",43,59,64,4.0,10/21/2017,Ive been to many different Applebee's over the years. It's good for an inexpensive meal. I'm a fan of their 2 for $20 deal. There's nothing special about this particular Applebee's except that it's connected to Green Acres Mall. I had their Whiskey Burger and it was scrumptious! This rating is mostly for that burger.  I hope it stays on the menu!! It was a fireball sauce that isn't overpowering and the onion rings on the Burger were the small kind making then easier to eat. Did I mention that it also had bacon? I recommend everyone try this burger. Lol
Farrah B.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,292,688,5.0,6/10/2017,"This Applebees is consistent when it comes to good, drinks and service.  The low rating surprised me quite a bit. We came here back during the restaurant anniversary and again a few weeks ago, and it was still really good.   I always sit at the bar, so I suppose my experience is different from those sitting at regular tables and booths.  Salads are fresh, boneless wings are fried crisp and juicy.  The star here would be the steaks.  They are cooked to perfection (medium, for me) and is full of flavor.  They even have happy hour after 10pm, everyday of the week with 1/2 price appetizers and drinks.  Take a chance, and sit at the bar."
Kuwana L.,"Jamaica, NY",63,69,58,3.0,7/1/2017,"Honestly speaking, applebees is not and probably will never be a good restaurant to me. The food is always nasty. No matter the location. If you ask for steak or a burger medium, it always comes back well done and burnt. Ugggh ( the worst). Chicken quesadilla is always good I suppose from the appetizers except for yesterday. For some reason that quesadilla was disgusting. Flavorless with hardly any chicken in it. I did taste the overpowered flavor of the cheese though. . The three stars for this particular location goes to the staff. Very nice waitress. She kept asking was everything ok. She suggested some desserts for us. Everything came out prompt. Thanks for the service."
Marilyn T.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,3,,1.0,1/3/2018,Horrible experience waitress got about us and waited for I dessert for a half hour then I went to the manager to tell her to remove the charge for the dessert but the manager didn't even seem interested that I had a bad experience at her restaurant which she is in charge.
Cierra C.,"East Flatbush, NY",381,1,1,2.0,10/12/2017,"I planned to come here with my best friend because I heard that there were $1.00 margaritas. I had a bartender named Patrick that served us. He didn't say hi, he just gave us menus and walked away. Then we asked him for two 1.00 margaritas and I specifically asked him to put salt on mine. He told me that it's was too much work for him to do because he makes a lot of margaritas within 5 hours. I checked my surroundings and noticed that there was only one guest at the bar and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. I kindly asked him and he said he'll do it for me. But as a guest who is excited to come to his restaurant, I shouldn't be told that it's too much work to do anything. Someone needs to be retrained on how to serve a guest and making their experience the best. Patrick obviously doesn't get the concept. Never coming here again."
Edwin P.,"Manhattan, NY",150,4,4,1.0,10/15/2017,"This place is definitely a joke! To start off the menus were all sticky and slow. We were sat for about 10 minutes without getting greeted by the server,"
Samantha B.,"Queens, NY",95,15,10,1.0,5/7/2017,"So I recently visited this location on May 5th 2017 around 9pm . Me and my friends were having a girls night .. I came to this location hungry and left starving . Unfortunately that's not a great thing for a restaurant .  I ordered the new burger that the waiter recommended along with onion rings . The quality of the food was very poor . The onion rings tasted like card board and the burger was horrible , I couldn't force myself to eat the food. I explained to the waiter how frustrated and unsatisfied I was and he took my plate.  We also were never given napkins , forks, spoons at all and ketchup. We had to ask a waiter whom was passing by  The bill came and I assumed that because I didn't eat my food not even 10% of it , that he would of removed it from the bill but he didn't . I had to tell him and the manager never came out either to apologize about my food .  I came hungry and left starving , also left with the mindset of never returning . I would rather go to fridays that is next door then applebees again"
Missy N.,"Jamaica, NY",0,31,6,1.0,6/18/2017,"My food tasted okay, simple appetizers we shared. They weren't great, and seemed like they had been sitting out. We came for happy hour.  We sat at the bar, my Long Island iced tea was a premixed bottle, not a fresh, shaken drink.  My husband had beers- he said they were a little less than cold. The bartender gave us a cup with ice?...  The bartender was not attentive at all and spent her time on her phone or with guys at the other end of the bar. We could not even get her attention.  I usually like applebees, but this location seemed careless."
Devon L.,"Far Rockaway, NY",16,9,16,1.0,5/4/2017,This was horrible experience so dirty did not clean the area. They say us here at this table. The worse experience and I love some Applebee's. I will never go back to this one or recommend it. I know people who worked there and told me do not ever go to this one and I was in a rush and wanted some wings and look at this smh.  As a business for you to sit people down in an area and think this is okay and normal we could've waited 10 more minutes for the area to have been swept.  Then the drinks was horrible manager was upset but still took them off the bill. I will never again go there or recommend this Applebee's to anyone they are not clean. Avoid at all cost.
Marissa M.,"JAMAICA, NY",519,436,1147,3.0,7/14/2016,"Gotta give credit where it's due even though I'm no Applebee's fan. This location has improved despite previous reviews. My daughter likes to go because of the kiddie menu and Presto game kiosk so I had no choice for a late Wednesday night dinner.  The servers have stepped up their game and so has the kitchen staff. With new menu items and deals to stay,  A B'S may be making a come back sooner than we know. My daughter ordered mozzarella sticks that were crisp and hot, chicken tenders kids meal. I ordered the cedar grilled salmon that was charred perfectly. I love my salmon soft inside and char grilled outside. This was perfection. I paired my meal with green beans and mashed pecan candied sweet potatoes. I was really impressed by this location. In the past they were not up to par but this time I was blown away. Our hostess kept checking on us and the servers were prompt."
Rich R.,"Woodmere, NY",0,7,,1.0,5/1/2017,"My very first experience at this Applebee's was a very negative one. The wait for a table was not long but the service after that point was very unpleasant. Our drinks and silverware came a little after the food, which by the way had a wrong order for one of us in the group. Necessities like straws and napkins also came much later than expected. When the silverware did arrive, it was in a glass of cloudy water that did not seem very clean. The food itself was not at its optimal warmth and thus took away from the flavor. The Long Island Iced Tea that a friend of mine ordered tasted unlike any other LI Iced Tea for some reason. The taste was reminiscent of dishwater and ginger...an unlikely combination lol. Once these issues were brought to the manager, he properly apologized and gave us a free dessert. We vowed to never return.  Come here if you so desire. You might have a better experience than I did."
Andy M.,"Brooklyn, NY",558,26,1,1.0,10/21/2016,"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOK, let's get into this.  First off, I can't say anything bad about the food. It was usual Applebee's food. There was nothing wrong with it.  What I had a BIG problem with was the employees.  There were two of us. We sat at the bar and just had beer, wine, and some apps. Nothing too big or hard.  The two bartenders were named Kahl (male) and Franny (female).  Kahl ignored us when we sat down right in front of him. Franny eventually came over and took our drink orders. She was pleasant enough and seemed nice.  We got our drinks, ordered our food, and talked a bit.  This is where the issues started. There were two women ( I didn't get their names) sitting on opposite sides of the bar, talking to each other. Not sitting NEXT to each other, you understand, sitting literally on opposite sides, so that their conversation could be heard by the entire bar and the tables that were close. They even joked about how loud they were talking.  Soon, I realized why they were sitting like this. They work there. I only figured this out when Franny, Kahl, and the two other women all began complaining and talking shit about other employees that work there.  Now, I understand that employees complain about other employees and about their bosses. This is nothing new and it's as it should be.  What I CAN'T accept, is when the two employees sitting at the bar start saying at the top of their lungs... ""They all faggots! I don't like NO ONE here. They all faggots!"" All of this is happening loud and clear, with TWO young children sitting very close to them.  That...is NOT ok.  Soon, Kahl is trying to clock out of his shift, so he's ignoring us and complaining to the other employees about hurrying up so he can ""get the fuck out!"". We had to interrupt their homophobic conversation just to ask for our check.  This is a corporate, family restaurant. Not cool.  And ""faggots""? Seriously? What year is this?!?!?  Thumbs down. We will NEVER eat there again."
Amanda S.,"Brooklyn, NY",75,4,,1.0,11/7/2016,"I came here with a table of 9. We made reservations, but still had to wait.  The service was horrible, we had two kids and they sat us in the bar section. REALLY ?  After asking for the booth, they insisted that this section would be comfortable and we would have to wait long for a booth. Being that we were starving, we just sat there.  The food was mediocre, nothing more than commercialized ready made meals.  I am now reminded why I haven't been to Applebees in so long. Even the two for $20 deals had menu choices that were NOT exciting.  Also, the service level here is below average. A bunch of just out of highschool kids, with attitudes. It's great that they are working, but the manager should know who to put in charge or not.  While leaving we walked through the lobby and smelled the horrible skunk like marijuana smell, which just turned my stomach. Seriously, are they smoking on the job. Just horrible.  Will never be returning!!"
Roseann C.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,9,,1.0,2/24/2017,The worst Applebee's I have ever been to. The employees are extremely rude and obviously weren't taught the basic principles of customer service. I sat at the bar and immediately regretted even entering the restaurant. The menu was just slammed down in front of me without any greeting. WILL NEVER Go back. Avoid if possible!! It's unfortunate that I cannot give this place ZERO stars
Mariah B.,"Rosedale, Queens, NY",589,238,3332,3.0,10/19/2015,"Don't we all love at least one thing from Applebee's? The sweet potato fries are off the chain ! I came in here with my friend to grab a quick bite to eat after walking all over Green Acres mall. We were not instantly greeted , but they finally noticed us standing in the waiting area, we were. There was no wait. We were seated within minutes. Our waitress was very nice. she was attentive, and gave great suggestions because I was picky. I had a Sangria, it was way too sweet, and tasted more like juice than wine. The sweet potato fries I had got as an appetizer came with four different sauces. and OH MAN they are good. I had to order some more. I made my friend order a burger because when you do, you get unlimited sweet potato fries. Amazing. For my meal I got the salmon which was exceptional. The plating could have been better. but eh, whatever, I had fries. I would come back, not to sit and eat, but to take out some sweet potato fries.  I would recommend."
Corey M.,"Flatbush - Ditmas Park, NY",73,8,3,1.0,6/23/2016,"We called in a order had was placed on hold for 4 min and 33 seconds. When we got the food it was over cooked the steak. Then, as I walked in the hostess Antoniota said here he come back as I approach which I thought was rude. When I advise the steak was over cooked it was as if I was bothering them. So now the rest of the food is now getting cold. Just not a good customer experience and food experience. The hostess seem to take this as a joke but I'm pissed cause I'm still here waiting for food that I order 30 min ago. Then the young lady wants to school me on how to cook steak. What's well done and what's med. well."
Lisa K.,"Bronx, NY",0,9,,1.0,12/26/2016,This was the worst service I ever had my partner and I went for lunch other people came in after us and they received their food before us.  The waiter never came to check on us I will never eat at that particular restaurant again.
Dani W.,"Malverne, NY",0,38,,2.0,12/20/2016,"After reading the poor reviews about Applebee's they need to get their act together. I have eaten here occasionally because the mall food court is always crowded. The last time the food had to go back because it was not hot.   I had lunch recently and the food was okay. But that is not the point this time. First, let me say Applebee's is not cheap. Lunch or a dinner will run you ten dollars plus.  What was shocking were the napkins! Yes, people the napkins. The napkins were the same texture and color as the brown paper towels that you find in public restrooms. What is going on here. The napkins were hard as a rock.   Applebee's is sliding down hill fast at this location. I need to go to an upscale neighborhood to see if they treat people at that location the same way."
Chrissie D.,"Queens, NY",719,190,200,5.0,2/10/2016,I always frequent this Applebee's. I have no complaints. Food is always A1 and so are the drinks! Happy Hour is my most favorite hour of the day! Lol for the most part the people who work here are cool I haven't had any bad encounters. I'm always here!
Mia W.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,26,23,2.0,2/15/2016,"My server is nice but they don't have enough servers here, which I think put her in a bad situation. I'm already here 2 hours in total and been waiting 20 min just to pay my bill. The food is EXTREMELY salty from appetizer on down. I couldn't even eat entire entree. I would've gottan' a headache. Drinks were very watered down as well. I asked for a drink without ice. I received 1/4 of what would've been on ice - meaning the rest of the drink would've been water. I don't like this Apple Bees at all. I prefer the one on Rockaway Turnpike."
Leslie R.,"Inglewood, CA",90,20,,1.0,4/3/2017,My first time to apple bee's on vacation with my husband . We kept seeing apple bees every where so while in the mall we decided to give the a try. First thing our waiter Ryan was playing with his hair while taking our orders and having a little meeting with other employees two booths behind us talking about his hair? Really? My drink was water down and I asked was it a virgin drink the manger came to respond saying everything is measured. Can I offer another drink I took him up on the offer glad I did much better 2nd time around. I suppose my expectations we set too high the appetizer (spinach artichoke dip) yuck my husband's chicken was dry a s the desert he some how stomached his meal. Ryan recommendations for me was some taco  a newer item on the menu I should have order the dry chicken. One bite and I was done the manager comes  again asked me how was the food I told him I didn't care for the tacos and he asked would you like me to leave them? I said no he asked can I offer you something else. I'm over it NO thank you!! I will grab a slice a pizza on any NY street and be more satisfied. Ryan come back twirling his hair with the check I noted the price for the drink was wrong and brought it to his attention. He steps away for 4 minutes then makes his way back towards us to help someone seated behind us. Me and husband become very irritated and speak of our irration. He completes the order the pops his head in and says I'm waiting on my manager to make the adjustment. Then returns another 3-4 minutes with the correction. My husband gives him the money for the bill Ryan asks do you need change. We say yes he goes back to table two booths back with his co workers and says they want change back. WTF does he not realize we can hear you stupid little boy and owe you nothing. I WILL NEVER step into another apple bees EVER. Shity service and horrible food.
Leslie K.,"Laurelton, Queens, NY",164,59,189,5.0,10/26/2015,Love you Fran  Patrick. Myra Kimchoy!!!! And of course Richard !!!! You gotta come see them your have the time of your life . I love my French onion soup and my Cesar salads and they make sure I'm taken care of ...
Earl J.,"New York, NY",5,1,,2.0,8/19/2016,"Came here with a friend during the middle of the day, the place was relatively empty, there a bunch of tables open in the back and it took about 5-10 mins to be seated. Upon being seated we were seated at a dirty table then the young lady half cleared the table. After being seat waited 30 mins for ours drinks... 45 for a glass of hot water. Our food was cold, the nachos were stale and the spinach dip was the best."
Nessa R.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",0,27,13,1.0,6/25/2016,"Wait time terrible.ordered on the tablet still took forever for the server to even come over to welcome us and take our drink orders. The food ordered from the tablet came before the waitress.the food was warm not hot but standard chain food taste. Long story short Service sucks here,chain food is the same, blah...."
Cinthia S.,"Rosedale, NY",0,14,39,1.0,4/2/2016,"Service was horrible. Server forgot our drink and said that they ran out of lime daiquiri, which was a lie. She came to our table yarning which was disgusting and her service was poor"
Brenda L.,"Flushing, NY",43,6,2,5.0,5/15/2016,Went there today with my daughter and her cousin after the circus. I do eat at Applebee's often due to always having a problem with my food when I do.  Tonight I must say it really mad up for all of the pass times. The waiter Jay(if I remember correctly)was very nice and kid friendly. The kids had a lot of requests ( like A Shirley Temple with extra extra cherries ) and not once did he get upset he just for filled it to the best of his ability. When it came time for me to order and couldn't find anything I would eat he was able to make a great suggestion that I was very satisfied. I must say this is one of the good Applebee's
April D.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,13,3,1.0,11/12/2014,"Stupidest Applebee's EVER! 1. HAIR in food. Showed waitress and she stated it was cotton from the cook's apron. 2. Food was cold. Told waitress and she stated it was the same as everyone else's that comes out from under the warmer. 3. Roach on ceiling behind my companion. Showed the waitress and she says, ""Oh shit, I can't even argue with that one.""  We left hungry and refused to even pay for our drinks. This place deserved a ""D"" grade in their front window. Gotta respect the waitress for defending her job 'til the death!"
Karin K.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,4,,2.0,4/18/2016,The greeter/host should act like they want a job there. Very lazy and took about 10 min for her to come to the front to seat us. The restaurant was practically empty. Server was great though.
JoArlee M.,"Elmont, NY",336,19,30,5.0,1/26/2016,"I had no issues here.  I came in and got my takeout within 10 minutes. The people are super friendly.  I got a 3 cheese penne,  my plate of my choice when I go there.  I didn't get to open it for another 20 minutes I was delighted to say it was still warm.  Idk how the service is at the table but what I seen from when I went there,  it's pretty good.  I'll leave another review when I get a table there."
Shaney W.,"JAMAICA, NY",147,50,167,4.0,11/6/2015,for now I am too excited to go to  Applebee's on Mondays after five its 6.99 burger and fries with unlimited refills and it falls into happy hour so cheap Heinekens and bay breeze are 4 bucks yes its well but I don't need much I barely make it to dessert . My family is cracking jokes and all smiles within 20 minutes. we go in like a commercial .
Anthony L.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,10,,2.0,2/6/2016,It's always something with this place! It's a shame the dishes don't come out properly made as they should! When u go to applebees you expect to get what u ordered. Managers accommodate but the kitchen needs a lot of work! Applebee's in green acres step it up already!
Yadi C.,"Corona, NY",7,79,51,1.0,6/27/2014,"Customer service is awful. Waited 5min before being asked what I wanted to drink. Finally I ordered for pickup instead. The brown bite is expected to be small but they game me half of a scoop of ice cream. To make matters worst they ran out of pico de gallo which makes the dish I order awesome. I told the server she should had told me they ran out of pico de gallo so I could order something else. I work in the mall and am a regular, they just lost one upset customer!!!! And i will let everyone know not to eat here ever."
Stacey J.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,2,,1.0,3/14/2015,"Disgusting food and a waste of time. I usually love Applebees. This place is understaffed and managed horribly. My boyfriend, daughter and I came in last week Sunday 3/8/15 for dinner around 7:30pm, we were told it would be a 15/20 min wait. This was fine since every other place was an 1-1 1/2 wait but thinking about it now I should've left. After about 25 mins we were seated, while waiting we figured out everything we wanted from drinks to food so we can be in and out. The waiter came and we ordered everything we wanted. He bought out the appetizer and kids meal pretty quickly (8pm) which was fine since our daughter was really hungry. He then bought out the drinks and then it went down hill from there. We waited almost another 30/40 about 8:40/45 before our food arrived but that was only after our server finally passed by again and said ""wow they didn't bring out your food"" then ran to the back. I'm assuming they forgot about us and just tried to whip out the food as fast as they could. I ordered the 3 penne cheese i believe and it looked like they just threw everything on it, the cheese was cold and the penne wasn't cooked. My boyfriend got the steak the vegetables were horrible and wasnt offered steak sauce. The waiter tried but he didnt succeed and it wasnt all his fault the store couldve supported him more."
Crystal C.,"Hollis, NY",82,1,,1.0,8/18/2015,"Decided to come eat here because of my mom.. we were waiting about 10 minutes and were never even acknowledged. Didn't even get asked if we wanted a beverage .. I haven't gone to Applebee's in years and honestly this was THE worst one I've gone to since I can remember.  Not sure if they were understaffed but regardless we left and no one even asked what was wrong or tried to stop us, I'd blame that on the manager. Horrible customer service and I didn't not see one staff in there that looked pleased to be there. I'm new to the restaurant business so I know a bit and see how things should and can be handled. Never coming back."
Gigi C.,"East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY",37,79,227,5.0,3/13/2014,"It was pretty empty today, I'm guessing that's why our service was so fast and delicious.  The Food came out on time and well done. Our waitress checked in on us 3 times within the 45 mins we dined (Awesome!!) however she didn't offer refills but she was still great. Nothing was done wrong at all and everything was seasoned to perfection. I love this Applebee's so much and I love this location more than any other location in Brooklyn and manhattan. I'll be back Again in a few days."
Tiffany C.,"Atlanta, GA",5,7,1,1.0,9/27/2014,"This is my first & last time coming to this Applebee's. Upon entering this place, I was ""greeted"" with a frown, no hello, no welcome, no acknowledgement whatsoever. After 5 mins, the waitress comes over, grabs 2 menus, & walks away. After we get her attention, she says she asked to follow her. Negative chief. It took another 15 mins for the waiter to show up. After ordering, we waited 20 minutes. The waiter did come back to say our food was coming. We waited another 15...No one came back to the table, neither did our food. Needless to say, I took my business elsewhere. There needs to be some customer service training in that place. Bad attitudes & no food. No thanks!"
Shanay R.,"Elmont, NY",0,2,,1.0,3/5/2015,"So 1st bad experience, I walked into this AppleBees and the hosts were all sitting down I thought I had to seat myself when a host finally came she walked us to our table with no words. after we were seated she told us who the server was. 2nd I received my food Shrimp scampi linguini and the shrimp was clear. I kindly sent it back because it was under cooked. I received my second dish and the shrimp looked exactly the same . I was starving and didn't want to wait so I ate what I could.  3rd I asked to speak with the chef. I already paid so it wasn't to get free food just to let him know that the food wasnt full cooked. The chef told me "" it won't do anything to you to eat raw shrimp "" at that time all I could do was laugh and leave . I realized that this store doesn't care about service at all. Positive  The server was great . Very helpful ."
Amanda L.,"New York, NY",19,13,3,2.0,9/4/2014,"It wasn't that busy today but it took forever for our waitress to come. Even though she had a nice attitude, she never came around whenever we needed her; basically she was never around. The food also took a while and we only ordered two appetitizers. Even getting our water took forever and I'm not talking about refills, I'm talking get about the first order of water. :/"
