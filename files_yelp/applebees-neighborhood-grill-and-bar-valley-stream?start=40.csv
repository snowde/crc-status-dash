Jodi G.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",24,60,70,3.0,8/23/2014,I like sitting at the bar since the waitresses by acting rude at times. Boneless wings of course of with a perfect margarita!
Michael P.,"QUEENS VILLAGE, NY",4,11,,1.0,3/12/2015,"Dirty, sticky menus and bar top. Inattentive staff, long wait for appetizer. Service has declined since last time I was here."
Jake J.,"Elmont, NY",8,173,80,4.0,9/26/2014,"Very nice experience, the food was wonderful I enjoyed it our waitress Nikia was superb she was a delight and funny to boot I'll definitely be coming back next time."
Joan R.,"Valley Stream, NY",350,360,105,1.0,6/29/2012,"Do NOT deposit your money, earned through sweat and tears, into this shit factory that consistently churns out  rotten nasty crap on a daily basis. Things that made me want to pull my hair out: 1. Waiting an an hour and a half to get into the eye of the shit storm. For some reason the people who frequents Green Acres and this Applebee's love to consume steamy piles of excrement in form of crap service, crap interior, and OK food that doesn't make up for the manure. The last few times I was dragged  there I was welcomed by an army of people eagerly awaiting to be showered in cow pies.  2. Horrible service.  The people who work there seems to be more unhappy to be there than I was. They don't give a shit, they don't care about providing good service, and the majority of them are just plain rude unpleasant people. 3. Sticky seats, sticky tables, splotchy utensils. Just ick.  4. The kitschy stuff hanging on the walls was cool in the 90s. It would be tolerable if they change up once in a blue moon. Now it's just irritating. Things that didn't make me want to pull my hair out: 1. The food is OK.  Decent food with a lot of selection. It's your standard chain restaurant food available  inexpensively through various deals. If I were to come here more often I would start looking like Yul Brenner from the King and I. I'll maintain my thick head of hair since I will never come back here. This Applebee's is not my cup of tea."
Britnee J.,"Jamaica, NY",0,2,,1.0,12/27/2014,Don't eat here!!!! the wings was uncooked my grandmother was sick for A week!! and jamaicans run the place and they are rude!  I had to curse the Manager out!  Disgusting place!.  Save yourself!
Maria M.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",65,57,54,4.0,8/17/2014,"It was pretty empty. Came here with my cousin who was craving steak. I wasn't so hungry but decided we should do the 2 for $20. Overall, the food was pretty good. The veggies were over buttered."
Kimberly S.,"Valley Stream, NY",1,8,5,1.0,9/1/2015,"I wish that I could choose negative stars!! Me and my friend went to eat there today and our server was ok but the reason why I want to give negative stars is because they served me RAW CHICKEN!!!!!!!!!! I couldn't believe it. I ate one and noticed that it didn't taste like usual then I ate another one and I immediately spit it out because it was so slimy in my mouth! I asked for the manager and her name was Lindsey, I told her I was served raw chicken and that I ate a piece already and all she could tell me was sorry and that I can't get sick off of one piece of chicken and if I wanted another batch! So after she took my tray away my entrée and chicken came out at the same time... This time cooked thank God! When it was time to pay I see that I was still charged for the chicken...this was so crazy to me she should of made sure that that was at least taken care of! I had to request that be taken off the bill and she took off 5 DOLLARS!!! I then complained to another manager and he did nothing about the situation...I am very disappointed with the service I got today. Such a shame how they handled this situation!!!!"
Brittany A.,"Queens Village, Queens, NY",623,371,398,3.0,1/22/2012,"I've been to this applebee's quite a few times and it isn't my favorite. The workers here are not snotty but also not the friendliest I've encountered. The food is your average ab's meals. But I will say it seems that my friend was jipped a bit of her meal last time I came here. My meal was delicious though. A cowboy burger with a veggie pattie and no Bacon. Scrumptious.  2 for 1 drinks. Can't beat that. Not strong. So you'll need both if you're trying to feel it.  Anyways, if you're looking for some food and not the typical food court meals this is the least crowded of the restaraunts in the mall area. Service ins't knock your sox off great BUT the crowd is light.. you can deal with it."
Sonny G.,"Malba, Queens, NY",2244,415,1191,2.0,11/8/2011,"I decided I am going to start reviewing chain restaurants even though I usually dont unless the service is impeccable/terrible.  I feel as If these places need some loving too. After all they are restaurants, and they NEED to be reviewed.  Mainly I'm going to be comparing different chain restaurants based on pros and cons of food/service/atmosphere.   This particular Applebees just didn't cut it for me.  To start we ordered and appetizer and drinks.  Now happy hour drinks (or whatever deal they had going) were two for one.  You have to get both drinks at the same time, which is fine but  what got me is angry is this... as a person who has worked in a restaurant before, the drinks are the first thing you bring to the table.  I'm sorry but if the appetizer comes before the drink that's a problem because there are people like me who need a sip of somethig after each bite, that easily go through 3/4 drinks per seating (whatever kind of drink that may be).  Now in this case he brought our appetizer first and I just assumed that he obviously was waiting for the bartender to make my two Pina Coladas.   So we start eating our appetizers and of course I'm getting thirsty (he hadn't brought my Bf's soda either).  He's like no where to be found and I'm kind of trying to wait for my drink to come before i continue eating.  The appetizer (trio) was not hot.  It was between warm and room tempature.  We finally got another waitress who got our waiter, and he came with my Bf's soda.  I told him about our appetizer and he said he would have it warmed, but I figured by the time he came back our entrees  would be on there way.  I told him to let the chefs know so other people don't have the same problem.  I then asked about my drinks and he said the bartenders were making them so I asked for him to bring me a water...:...........:............:.......:......... ...........:........................... .                  ..........:........................ As were finishing our appetizer AND my bf's soda our food comes (from a different waiter).  I STILL DON'T HAVE A FUCKIN DRINK!!! NO WATER, SODA, OR PINA COLADAS!! Now we have NO MORE drinks left, we don't know where our waiter is, and at this point I'm pretty full from the appetizer/soda.  By this point at the restaurant me and my bf would be out in another 15 minutes because we usually bring 75% of our food home.  Once again I am trying to hold off on eating my entrée because I'm very thirsty....so as I'm stalling I see our waiter and call his attention again and gives me a look of oh yea your drinks"".  I start to eat with the intention of my drink finally being on its way.  Once again waiting-- after about 10 minutes I was really pissed and got up to talk to a manager because I wanted them to take the drinks off my bill, sure enough who comes over to the table...(it seemed as if every time I was at a boiling point he would pop up).  Now I have two huge Pina Coladas and a plate with 80% of the meal left on it. The moral of the story and point of my review is to say that this Applebee's has a bunch of scatterbrains working.  Applebee's are within a 5mile radius or so of one another.  Go to the new one Elmont.  Go anywhere, but here.  Save yourself frustration. P.S- I paid for my Pina Colada (even though it was 2 for 1), and drank about a quarter of one."
Sonja K.,"JAMAICA, NY",0,51,,3.0,5/15/2013,"Food okay. Service okay. Tvs great! I went here to have lunch with a friend over the weekend. I ordered this huge California shrimp salad. It was pretty good. I couldn't eat all of it, so I took the rest home. I shared dessert with my friend: the triple chocolate meltdown which is chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and fudge. Yummy."
Steven V.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,91,6,1.0,7/3/2011,"So it was mid-afternoon, hadn't eaten yet, wanted to beat the traffic, driving past it on the way home, thought about the commercials and the deals.  That's how we came to go to Applebee's at the mall. Ugh!  Waste of money and time!  And they don't want to change because they are executing the corporate procedures so this place stinks from the top! They overcook and dry out everything, unless you order something where you control the temperature (my steak was rare).  Otherwise, the cheeseburger sliders were dry, tough, and better for hockey as a puck.  The tequila lime chicken was burned, tough, and dry untill we actually squeezed lime over it.  The worst, believe it or not, was the rice.  Yes, they make their rice dry, hard, and like rubber!  And the cooks are doing as directed!  I'm glad I have a dental plan! The topper to this story has to be the server.  Polite and corporate.  However, when she said that instead of the potatoes that come with my steak, I could have onion rings so I, of course, said 'yes.'  I got charged money for the onion rings!  She was also very attentive on my raspberry lemonade offering me refills.  She, again, charged me, for something and not tell me in advance or even during!  And we had four refills!  I really thought that practice is called 'petty larceny' but I could be wrong. We've asked relatives who go to Applebee's frequently and they couldn't figure out why they go either?!   I say, Nay, Nay to Applebees!"
Christie S.,"Oceanside, NY",0,11,2,1.0,4/15/2015,"Filthy place, the waitstaff was awful! Waited 15min for the waitress to take our drink order! Then acted like she was annoyed we were there. Will NEVER go back!"
Person A.,"New York, NY",1,67,,5.0,4/4/2015,"Standard Applebee's service and menu.  If you've been before you'll know what the service, atmosphere, and menu are like, and this place is no different.  I think the value for money can't be beat and there's no reason not to give this place 5 stars."
Chrissy C.,"CANAL STREET, NY",52,313,14,2.0,9/11/2012,"its applebees.  its crap food thats prob gonna make you feel like killing yourself after.  i only come here for the 1/2 off apps and drinks.  which, yeah... is dirt cheap.  so, its a good place to pre game and just bum around at w/buddies if you dont feel like going out-out. this location is attached to the mall.  so, its convenient and lots n lots n lots of parking."
Ken -.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,11,,1.0,7/18/2013,"Never in my life have I experienced such a derogatory service and establishment. If I had known better, I would've skipped the wait time and saved my money to eat the higher quality food that my pet dog consumes on a daily basis. It is not an enjoyable experience sitting on dirty, sticky, and unsanitary seats while attempting to deal with the repugnant staff and unpleasant food. The amount of unprofessionalism radiating from this establishment is so appalling that I would rather have kindergarteners serve the food while paying them tenfold. If you do decide to go here, I hope you enjoy the zoo. I discovered a new level of abomination that I have never tasted from any type of food in my lifetime. The overcooked food and small portions along with the strong taste of your very own household refrigerator puts the restaurant industry to shame. The waiters would much rather be watching the basketball game simultaneously occurring on 10 different televisions than give the slightest bit of attention to the needs of a customer. If you do decide to go here, stop what you're doing, stand up, and sprint for the door as fast as you can. Don't look back, don't say a word. They must think straws serve no purpose to individuals who require fulfilling their thirst and diluting the strong taste of such horrendous food in their mouths. I also had no idea that a dine-in restaurant does not offer metal spoons. Instead, I was given black, plastic spoons that were still in the slimy plastic wrapper, which I had to manually remove myself. Sadly, the bill was also overcharged and I won't even begin to explain how incompetent the manager was."
Lisa L.,"San Jose, CA",1,29,,4.0,8/6/2012,"We have Applebee's out West...it's an OK place to eat when you are out and about. I want to give this particular Applebee's a compliment simply because the staff was very welcoming and attentive. We were on the last leg of a very long vacation - after being in Europe, stopped over in NY just for a few days before flying home to CA.  We were tired of being on the go, jet-lagged and just needed a familiar meal near our hotel at JFK airport.  We found it at Applebee's near the Green Acres Mall.  The hostesses were bright and cheerful, as was our server, Patrick.  He helped us with some driving directions, too.  Small kindnesses can really make a family's day.  Thanks!"
Kalisha E.,"Queens, NY",87,266,224,5.0,7/10/2011,Wonton tacos appetizer is a must! Had the 2 for $20. Spinach dip app is reaallly good. Shrimp past was gumby and overcooked-that was the only minus. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. I would definitely return. Drinks are good too. Happy hour is 4-6 and 10 to close but call to confirm.
Shaan N.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,2,,1.0,12/15/2013,"This is my first review. I am a fan of yelp, I read it a lot when I want advice on a nice place to go with my wife. Let me first start by saying that I am a man's man. I love sports and beer with wings etc...... while I'm watching a sports game. I also love to support local businesses in my area. I am also 33 years of age. After working a long week of work I decided to go to my local Applebee's at Green Acres Mall. My wife was home with our 1 year old. I wanted a quick beer, wings and some me time. I just moved to Valley Stream so I wanted something quick so I went here. It was a long wait, which I understand. I was happy that the host was able to get me a seat along the bar area, without a wait. The bar was crowded which is not a problem at all. I like a nice football crowd. I waited exactly 20 mins before my waitress came to greet me. While I was waiting I looked at the staff whom were all no older than at least 21. I have no problem with that. I love to see young people working. They were extremely loud and talking amongst themselves. One female who is West Indian was yelling across the bar and rudely yelling at the bartender. I am an African American; I have respect all races but I was still waiting for my waitress and observing this rude behavior. I finally placed a order for a blue moon beer which they did not have. O.k. no problem 2 for 1 I'll take a Long island ice tea. My drink came 15 mins later. It took me 25 mins to finish both drinks. My waitress never came back to take my food order. But I knew where to find her. She was standing next to the other 21 year old staff members with the bartender and the loud West Indian  waitress. I got her attention and called her over. I ordered burger sliders which were good and came quickly. I was done with the sliders in 15 mins. I was ready to order my entrée. Where is my waitress? Don't worry I knew where to find her. I got her attention and ordered 10 buffalo wings with the bones. My food came about 25 mins later boneless. Her assistant brought it to me. I told her assistant I ordered on the bone. Her assistant left with the wings and came back 5 mins later with the wings again boneless, SMH. Again I told her I want it on the bone. She left and my waitress came 10 mins later and asked me did I want it on the bones or not. OMG, How hard is it for a man to get a order of wings. The wings finally came about 10 mins later. I ate my wings and order nachos to go for my wife. While I was waiting for my nachos, an older caucasion family arrived next to me a waited 15 mins before someone took there order. I called the manager over and complained. Like I said I'm a man's man, but I expect good service. The manager looked like she was a heroin addict. She was nodding while I was talking to her. I could not wait to leave. I paid my bill and still left a %20 tip. I went home to give my pregnant wife her nachos which was extremely dry with no chili. I Then took a bite out of my wings, which had blood in it. Like I said this is my first and maybe last review. Don't go to this place. And for my men who think this is a nice outing to watch football think again. Don't go here. The food is awful, the staff is young and untrained and the manager is a heroin addict."
Nicole S.,"SOUTH OZONE PARK, NY",0,7,,4.0,10/15/2013,"Great Restaurant.  I did ""AppleBees To Go"" last night, the person who greeted me was nice and so was the person who took my order.  But when I got the food, it was very small portions. The BBQ wings had too much vinegar and the shrimp wasn't cooked to my liking. Overall great place otherwise."
Jacob B.,"Ozone Park, NY",60,23,2,2.0,7/24/2011,"This is a classic example of poor service for poor people and why it matters which neighborhood you eat in, even at chain restaurants.  The server took forever to get our drinks and then returned with drinks for only two out of three of us.  The same thing happened again with the entrees.  She brought two of the entrees and then a few minutes later the last one.  The server's were talking back and forth and joking around with each other while we were waiting and waiting and this got infuriating.  The manager came over at the end of our meal and asked how it was so I told him about the food and drinks not being served to everyone at the same time.  He gave us a small discount and apologized but I sensed that he was not at all surprised.  Perhaps the most disappointing thing about this Applebee's is that we go to Applebee's for the fun and cheerful atmosphere, and that was just totally missing here."
