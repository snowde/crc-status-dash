Alice M.,"Vancouver, WA",0,78,3,5.0,1/4/2018,"We had the bestest time here. Awesome waiter, Julian. Everyone one taking care of us was fun. Our food was delicous. I had the light flare, Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken. I cant wait to have it again ;);). Got a BIG salad with it. Couldnt finish it all. Lady who brought us the togo boxes did something i never thought of -- put the date on them to keep track of how long its in the fridge. Great for us since we get a lot of take out. I don't know about anyone else but we were very satisfied."
Jennifer L.,"Fairview, OR",3,40,33,4.0,10/20/2017,I haven't been to Applebees in a long time because my last experience was not so good. I decided to give this location a chance and I was not disappointed.  We were seated right away and our server came within seconds to get a drink order started. The food arrived within a good amount of time. My steak was cooked exactly as I requested and all of my food was was warm when it was brought out. I will definitely go back to this Applebees again.
Anita F.,"Vancouver, WA",0,1,,1.0,11/2/2017,"I hadn't been to Applebees for awhile  and we thought we would come back.  The service was prompt, the appetizer was tasty and the restaurant wasn't very busy.  Unfortunately, the entree that I have enjoyed in the past was a huge disappointment.  The meat was cooked to the consistency of jerky and I didn't eat half of it.  I  won't be back for a long time."
Elyse M.,"Washougal, WA",194,121,130,1.0,10/16/2017,"I haven't been to an Applebees in a REALLY LONG time! Food was really poorly made and service was less than exceptional. We had a group of 5 with one child. It's pretty bad when you order a meal and it's so unappetizing that you cash out and go to another place. We did appetizers to start which admittingly were pretty good. We had the chicken wonton tacos... so good, the boneless wings... meh, and steak quesadilla...good. For dinner we did the 2 for $20. My better half and I both ordered buffalo chicken strips for our main course. They were so over cooked and had barely any sauce on them. It was awful. One of the people with us ordered the oriental salad and asked for the dressing on the side. They brought her a salad loaded with dressing plus an additional sauce on the side, not at all what she asked for. Our waitress was even less impressive than the food. We were all drinking beer but I really wanted a water (surprised we weren't given any when we sat down, not even the child got a water) Anyways, I think we asked 7 or 8 different times for 2 waters and didn't get them until we were basically leaving. when it came time for the bill, the tablet on our table didn't work. We asked several times for our check explaining to her it wasn't working. When she finally brought it over we went to hand her a card and she was already gone. We were so frustrated with the entire night, we gathered enough cash to pay our bill and leave. I used to like going here but man I don't know what happened in the year I hadn't been here but it is so awful now I wouldn't go back."
Leticia F.,"Vancouver, WA",4,17,6,2.0,3/1/2017,I went in with a group of 6 and had a funny and attentive male server.  The host were chit chatting work gossip loud enough we heard who was fu**ing who!  To top things off I had left my purse and realized when I got home. Called and spoke with a host who said no purse was left or there and even after I insisted it had to be there she told me no. I drove back and spoke to a manger and they had my purse... Drinks are always good at Applebee's.
Brenda W.,"Vancouver, WA",37,2,,1.0,8/15/2017,"We still haven't stepped foot in Applebee's on 12717 SE 2nd Circle Vancouver Washington. The manager apologized on that day and promised a gift card via email. Never received an email. Oh well, we've spent lots of $ at nearby establishments. Applebee's loss continues....."
Brandi K.,"Vancouver, WA",143,489,758,4.0,6/21/2016,I've had a love/hate relationship with Applebees for years. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's just plain awful. Most of the time I'm there for happy hour and you just can't beat the half-priced appetizers. You can get stuffed to the brim for under $20 for 2 people. Add in a couple of their happy hour drinks and you're good to go. Service is almost always top-notch. Our most recent server was a blast! Late night happy hour is the best to avoid children screeching in the restaurant portion.
Sandra B.,"Vancouver, WA",40,9,8,1.0,7/29/2017,Worse service I have ever had! Not even busy. Food was cold and tasteless. Had to wait 10 minutes just for a soda and then she brought it in a to go cup. I did not ask for a to go cup. She was short with myself and my husband. She brought our food and just threw it on the table and continued on her way. No napkins with our dessert. I am very dissatisfied.
Micah C.,"Vancouver, WA",4,26,,2.0,11/29/2016,"I've gone several times before, and been satisfied. The last time I went, however, it seems their entire menu had changed for the worse. Everything we ordered came in tiny, unsatisfying, and overpriced portions. My friend and I were mystified, as we'd eaten there three times a couple months ago, and always been very happy with the portion sizes. My enchiladas were the saddest, tiny little things, with a heap of rice. Everyone left still very hungry and disappointed, but looking at the portion sizes and the prices, we figured we'd have to pay double-to-triple a normal meal's cost in order to feel full. We couldn't even order dessert, because the only desserts they have on the new menu are different variations of ""brownie and ice cream"", which no one wanted. WTF. We decided to stop by Shari's to buy a couple pies to have at home, so we could actually end our night feeling full. I'll never hit Applebee's again, here or any other location (I assume it's probably the result of the recent company-wide menu change). Go next door to McGraff's, where you can actually fill up."
Max I.,"Portland, OR",30,25,,3.0,5/30/2017,Just OK for me.  The staff were slow to recognize me.  In fact there was no bartender for about 5 minutes and then when she came out with no acknowledgement I thought about leaving.  The food is good.  The drinks are corporate to the max.  No worry about over pours here.  This particular Applebee's is a little too family friendly for me.  I mostly drive by it now but would go there in a pinch.
Mag M.,"Vancouver, WA",0,13,,1.0,9/25/2017,Always screwing up our order. Messy. Small portions. Last time I went they gave my twins a raw burger. Disgusted I was glad I checked it first before giving it to them!
John P.,"San Diego, CA",0,124,,4.0,4/15/2017,"Nice and friendly associates.  Parking is decent bit not the best.  Average size restaurant but I have seen bigger, roomier restaurants of this kind."
Anna M.,"Portland, OR",15,11,1,3.0,3/16/2017,"Decent food, we order to go frequently but do check your order if you asked to not include onions or for a different sauce - they tend to ignore or forget about specific requests..."
Matt C.,"Lindsay, CA",1,21,5,4.0,3/11/2017,Food was great. Service was kind. They did forget a salad for our table. But the drinks were filled as soon as they were empty. We were there just for the happy hour appetizers. I will be back.
Kayla L.,"Vancouver, WA",198,191,238,5.0,9/26/2015,"I went to this location last night and had a great experience! We went a few minutes before 6 to get happy hour. We were thinking it would be too busy to get a seat right away since it was a Friday night but we didn't have to wait. Our waiter (Tyler I think) had many tables he was waiting on but he made sure we were taken care of. I love Applebee's new burgers! Also, their happy hour menu has good choices for a good price. We will definitely be going back to this Applebee's soon!"
John C.,"Greenville, SC",26,351,10,2.0,3/21/2015,"At the end of the experience, we were reminded exactly why we don't eat at Applebee's any longer.  The short version is because the food isn't that good.  We ordered a grilled chicken ceaser salad.  Additional dressing was requested because it felt lacking but even with additional dressing, the salad didn't taste great, The biggest fail was the service.  If you ask me if I want a drink and I say a Bud Lite pint and you say ok and disappear, don't you dare come back and ask my another question unless you bring me my simple draft beer.  If I have to ask twice for my beer, I'm done spending money here.  At $3.25 for a Bud Lite pint during Happy Hour, the service had damn well better be amazing! We agreed not to visit this Applebee's location again no matter what and realized that maybe Applebee's is not the place for us anymore."
Wendy B.,"Vancouver, WA",3,2,,1.0,10/16/2016,We have been here many times.Usually it is good food.However we went there yesterday and it was awful.Our chips were stale so we sent them back and ordered onion rings which were raw on the inside.A female manager came and said she was going to give us bread but we ordered onion rings.She appeared intoxicated.She said she would not charge us for our app but she did.When we got our meal the rice was a day or so old.We were so hungry we are it!!it wasnt busy...we wasted 25 bucks!!
David H.,"Sun Prairie, WI",19,481,270,2.0,4/19/2016,This is a decent Applebees with okservice and nice food. It gets a 2 as someone who was having lunch with us returned to their car in the parking lot to find the window smashed and their laptop missing.
Pam B.,"Vancouver, WA",0,34,3,2.0,12/3/2015,"We eat weekly at Applebee's.  Usually the salads, (trying to cut some lbs) Tried the fiesta chicken salad 11.99 wow was about 1-1/2 cups salad.  Looked like it had been placed under that heat lamp with hot food too.  Lettuce was all wilted, and it was about the size of a side salad? Not happy."
Jennifer O.,"Battle Ground, WA",0,12,1,2.0,9/4/2016,Have always loved Applebee's and was disappointed in our food. Service was good. Got the fiesta chicken lime and the chicken and the rice was dry. This used to be my favorite dish. Very disappointed in the food.
Brad H.,"Kirkland, WA",234,971,114,5.0,12/4/2015,"Applebee's has really stepped up their game in modern decor, how clean the location is and overall guest experience. The location is very modern, clean (gone are the days of dusty sports signs) and food is now served with great presentation. There are Presto mobile tablets at the tables to allow you to order drinks and appetizers at your table , pay the bill (including multiple credit cards) and even email receipts making expense reporting for work a breeze. Thanks Applebees for a great happy hour menu and a much improved location over the years."
Sonja V.,"Camas, WA",2,9,,1.0,1/14/2017,Our experience here was a disappointment all around.  I told the wait staff that I was gluten free and yet she brought me a salad that included gluten.  The service was slow and not particularly helpful.  The items on the menu looked interesting and tasty but were ordinary.  But who are at an
Kalen S.,"Vancouver, WA",0,6,1,4.0,2/5/2017,Love the chicken wonton tacos! If you are getting a drink you're better off with a beer or glass of wine rather than a cocktail. Mixed drinks are weak and expensive! Good pre-func place :)
Donavan J.,"Vancouver, WA",181,1,,1.0,7/27/2016,Extremely rude servers. I absolutely hate sarcasm and they're good for that. Hopefully next time I get more friendly and warming conversation.
Kat G.,"Westminster, CA",39,42,73,1.0,4/16/2015,"I usually go to a place 2 times before giving it a review. This place is very disappointing, 2nd time experience was actually worse than the first. Table and menus are still sticky, I don't understand how a place can manage to fail the very first impression to customers, and also a very task to take care of. Their cocktails were either taste like water down, flat coke or super sugary. I ordered a streak salad for take-out, I asked for medium rare and what I got was some kind of over cooked steak. My first ordered some kind of chicken salad, he asked for extra salad and willing to pay extra, turned out he got extra onion only. I will never come back to this place again !"
Rob P.,"Everett, WA",0,5,,1.0,10/5/2016,"After 40+years of dinning out in all types of restaurants, I've never had such an awful experience. Our waitress was extremely slow for having no business in our section. My wife and son waited 20 minutes for drinks. When the waitress came back to the table, she apologized for the delay. Then stated ang I quote "" I'm sorry, I've been in the bathroom. "" WTF!! REALLY! ! Then asked if we wanted dessert. Never ever eating at Applebee's again. To the management,Please retrain your waitstaff."
Peggy F.,"Camas, WA",0,1,,1.0,3/26/2017,"Applebee's on Mill Plain in Vancouver for us was a terrible experience. First off the lady escorting us to our table had heavy powder/cologne fragrance about her. Not good! Wanted cup of soup - only had ""bowls.""  The waiter assured me the bowl was 5 oz., which actually cracked me up - I did research at home and a ""cup"" is generally 6-8 oz. and a bowl around 12 oz. Their BOWL is smaller than a normal CUP.  And it truly was small. Ordered corn chips to supplement - they never came. The place was quiet - but workers were scarce. When we saw them they were typically clustered together chatting. Worst thing was that the heat was blasting on us entire time - it was uncomfortably hot. Felt sorry for workers. After we asked, Manager told us they had adjusted it but that the furnace ""had mind of its own"" - and it just kept pumping out heat. She said it had been like that for the NINETEEN years she had worked there - that it was an ""old building."" All-in-all could not recommend this restaurant and do not intend to return."
Dawn A.,"Vancouver, WA",10,15,26,5.0,11/13/2015,They have great food and service. Love Tyler he's amazing!!! Try the chicken wonton tacos happy hour their half price and love the grilled lemon chicken with quinoa.
Sabrina K.,"Vancouver, WA",1,4,,1.0,5/22/2015,"I went here with my best friend and her parents. We got the worst service I had ever received. The table was extremely sticky which is foul, if you're a restaurant the tables are supposed to be clean and these were not. We ordered appetizers and entrees, we waited and waited we finally received them with our dinner. I had ordered ribs. They did not give me wet naps. Even after I asked for wet naps she completely ignored me although she said yeah sure thing. I finally asked for the second time and she said oh I can't believe I forgot. I will never be back. We probably saw our waiter at most 4 times. We went out on a limb here and we got super bad service."
Brandon M.,"Vancouver, WA",179,38,2,5.0,3/28/2015,Great food and a great atmosphere. Happy hour half price apps and drink specials can't be beat. Great pregame location
Samantha O.,"Portland, OR",0,38,11,5.0,6/20/2016,"I've never been to an Applebee's before and to be honest, I was a little nervous. But let me tell you. I'm now a big fan. Great service. Hard alcohol! The onion rings were fresh and crispy. The steak was cooked perfect (medium) and very juicy. Super friendly staff. Nice atmosphere. I officially love Applebee's. I never thought I would see the day."
D ..,"Portland, OR",0,32,,1.0,3/29/2015,"Aside from sitting right next to the host station and feeling like our conversation was being spied on, that we were being stared at by staff lounging at said station, sitting 3 feet away from a bratty toddler in a high chair throwing food on the floor, and our female server (Megan) incorrectly telling me that ""oh, they don't put anything on the burger"" and it being served with thousand island dressing slathered all over the bun, it was great lol. ...won't be back"
Sharon M.,"Vancouver, WA",2,24,,2.0,2/25/2015,"Had a gift card for Applebee's and last night we went for dinner about 6:40 pm.  Promptly greeted, seated, and asked if we had plans  Expecting a food or drink related question I stared blankly at the server.  Then with my endless wit replied, ""What?""  The full question was repeated a little hesitantly, Did we have plans?  Felt a bit like being in a Bullwinkle and Rocky episode that I didn't remember being cast in.  Yes, we did have plans - to eat.   Then on to drink selection, mine, water, MDS wanted flavored lemonade and asked what flavors there were.  The server said ""Lots""  The same server who was so interested in our ""plans"" wasn't so interested in providing information about the flavors or maybe a password was required.  After a few guesses of flavors that were not available he reluctantly provided us with a list.  We looked over the very wordy and complicated menu, hard to do when hungry and without the decoder key.  Decided on the $25 twofer with onion rings as an appetizer, and entrees of fried shrimp and grilled chicken breast.  Onion rings arrived, very brown, hot and with a cup of dipping sauce.  The onion rings tasted slightly scorched and the dipping sauce was a too sweet barbeque. Neither enhanced the flavor of the onion which is what I wanted to taste.  Burgerville does it better.  Between ordering and receiving our entrees at least three to four random servers asked us questions, only one of which had any purpose except in fulfilling their  version of providing good service.  Service which was totally unrelated to any action on our part.  It was annoying and guilt provoking - I mean, who wants to admit to being annoyed by people supposedly trying to please us?  Use your eyes and ears people!  If customers are engaged in talking to one another or eating, have full water glasses, aren't looking around to catch someone's eye - leave them alone.   Now for the food.  MDS was happy with his shrimp even though they were the same dark brown as the onion rings.  The breast of chicken I ordered was superbly tender and moist as well as plentiful.  The sautéed mushroom & onion were flavorful but were cooked in 1/4 cup oil when  a tablespoon could have done the job.  The red potatoes were a dark brown and very dry.  MDS gave me his cole slaw which was nicely dressed, seasoned, and fresh tasting.  The fresh parsley was a very nice addition. So, a 2 for service, only because no one was rude and we did get our food.  The food ranged from a 1, the onion rings and potatoes, to a 5 for the chicken and shrimp for an averages of 3.  Making the final score a 2.5 which Yelp doesn't support.   ."
C P.,"Tacoma, WA",127,228,93,4.0,12/30/2013,"This applebee's has been one of the better ones that I've been to. I got the quesadilla burger both times and it came out perfectly. The mixed drinks were pretty strong, and I wish they had a better beer selection. The service was awesome the first time, but the second time, our waiter was really grumpy. Like he did not want to be there. He forgot to get my friend a coke, so she only had water for the longest time. I'll go back if I'm around the area."
C S.,"Vancouver, WA",168,73,,5.0,12/15/2013,Great happy hour drinks.  3.75 for a long island.  Good food.  Great staff.  We always have a great time here. Trivia at the bar on Tuesday's is fun .
Grace L.,"Reno, NV",0,19,1,4.0,4/26/2015,I live close by and love this place for good priced and yummy appetizers and drinks. I always sit at the bar and David is an awesome bartender!
Stacy P.,"Seattle, WA",1,52,7,3.0,12/13/2013,Was in the neighborhood and tried their happy hour.  A pretty typical Applebee's but what I expected and the waitperson was nice and friendly and got us our drinks and food quickly given we just got in before the end of happy hour.  She even came back to make sure we got our last call before it was over.   Again pretty much identical to every other Applebee's I have been in but the drinks and food were good.  Go for it if you don't want to take chances and hit a quick happy hour!
Bob K.,"Vancouver, WA",123,134,228,3.0,9/16/2014,Pretty institutional. But consistent and nice cold beer.  Staff was a little slow and obnoxious football fan keep swearing and was never asked to stop.  At 6:40pm with a few kids in restaurant.  Good value at happy hour. Other times not as much.
Gabbi J.,"Welches, OR",4,5,4,1.0,3/26/2013,"""Worst steak EVER!!!!!! One was ALL fat! Another was RAW! One was ok ish. The service sucks i was served last like five min after everyone else.    I guess this is what you get for a corporate place."""
Thomas C.,"Vancouver, WA",5,1,,1.0,8/26/2013,"I used to love Applebee's however, it's just not the same anymore. This Applebee's, especially, was unremarkable in every way. The staff isn't all that bad, however the food was VERY mediocre and absolutely NOT worth the price. The grilled chicken was bland, there was absolutely no flavor in the meat of the chicken; it's just hidden with a rather tasteless glaze on top. My girlfriends onions weren't even caramelized (Which isn't a huge deal but when you're paying $15 and practically the entire topping was raw it's not very appealing to say the least). The sandwiches are a joke; there is NO way any of the sandwiches they make are worth even 1/2 of the price. Their fries are mediocre, the fish and chips aren't worth the price and rather bland. About the ONLY good thing they have are their deserts. They're tasty and aren't super spendy! Overall, If you want pretty small portions of overpriced mediocre food then definitely hit up this Applebee's! But I will be avoiding this place from now on sadly. I could've just been there on a bad day, however I'm not willing to gamble another $50 to find out."
