Victor K.,"Vancouver, WA",0,1,,3.0,2/8/2015,Service was slow. Had to wait for 5 min for the hostess to come. Maybe short staffed? Table very sticky.  They said it's because the finish is coming off. Wiped the table with a wet napkin and it was brown. They need to change tables or put glass ontop. Food was good :)
A Y.,"Vancouver, WA",0,18,2,3.0,4/26/2016,"manager almost always says hi to me when i come for lunch, my kids love the balloon guy that makes balloon art. their food is good but not as great as you'd think for the price and service is hit or miss depending on who you get."
Nick M.,"Happy Valley, OR",30,7,,5.0,10/16/2015,"We had excellent service tonight! The manager here is very attentive, such a nice guy and honestly made our meal so much better! I didn't catch his name, but he was amazing!"
Alice B.,"Vancouver, WA",26,114,,3.0,10/11/2012,Food was ok not the best but not horrible -  service wasn't the best. I have been here other times and received good service I think it was an off night
Mahsa K.,"Portland, OR",186,286,300,3.0,1/5/2014,"I came in, I knew what I wanted and I got it. No out of the way effort to rate on anything else, but complete satisfaction on following through with my expectations. I wanted 1-salmon, 2-asparagus, and 3-rice....... of the whole chain's average menu, like a beacon to my dietary delight, came exactly what I was looking for and on the under 550 calorie menu at that. One thing, it was supposed to come with potatoes, and I didn't see rice anywhere on the menu, but they must have had it because our waiter said I could sub rice for the potatoes and no extra charge. Exactly what I wanted, medium-rare perfectly pink center, sauce on the side for even less calories and only $14.99. Kudos for that and friendly service. Just wish they would remodel this venue, since most other Applebee's in the area have already undergone the transformation."
Jill M.,"Vancouver, WA",12,25,,4.0,3/1/2014,"We had a great dinner here.  I really do not understand the ratings for this place, they should be much higher.  We eat here at least once a month...mostly because it is close, convenient, and we consistently have great service and good food.  We usually get the chicken sizzler, but I had the cajun shrimp on the weight watchers menu recently, and it was delicious! The pretzel/cheese appetizer is fantastic, and the shooters are a great deal for those that like a little sweet with dinner.  The wait staff here is hands down the best anywhere...always a smile and all so friendly...we LOVE this place."
Sean R.,"Vancouver, WA",0,6,,5.0,9/22/2014,"I've been going to this Applebee's for a couple years now. The food and service has always been good and surprisingly they cook a really good steak. They recently did a remodel of the entire restaurant and it looks great. Even the seats have good padding now so you don't hurt your butt sitting down. Prior to the remodel, the seats were pretty hard. I would recommend this location to anyone in the area."
Chris K.,"Boise, ID",23,27,47,3.0,5/28/2013,Service is alright. Food was not bad. Happy hour makes it all worth it!

John L.,"Vancouver, WA",9,36,10,1.0,2/20/2010,"Applebee's serve some regular fair that is on par with any chain store.  Normally, service is what set things apart.  And here we have one where service sets things far on the wrong side. We frequented this Applebee's because my wife is enthralled with their Asian Salad.  But the service, as few others has pointed out, is hugely a hit and miss.   Here is my one and last visit. My wife, son, and I went there for an early dinner at around 4:30PM.  We were seated promptly in a booth at the end of the right side of the restaurant.  So far, so usual. Here is where it went all wrong.  From the local to the management level. We waited over 10 minutes.  3 wait persons came up and down the aisle and none acknowledged us.  No water, no ""I'll be with you in a second"", nothing.   We watched as people who came in much later than us get seated and served with drinks.   I went up to the bartender and asked for a manager.  Someone with an Applebee's shirt self identified and asked me what's going on.  I informed him that we have sat there over 10 minutes without service, and are wonder what's going on.  He tersely said ""well have a seat and we'll be with you."" I did.  And watched him go to another table in the bar area to chat up for over 5 minutes. We left.  We went across the parking lot to the McGrath's Fish House. You know what?  McGrath's Fish House gave us great service.  I also realized for the same food, McGrath's is less expensive, and, according to my wife, taste better. I did send an email to Applebee's and to their credit, a regional manager did call me.  He mentioned he will address the issue and have the store manager, Jennifer, sent an invite back to prove their service.   The only thing is, after a month, nothing but lip service.   So if you happen to be near, and want to know where to go, really - Sweet Tomato and McGrath are great options.  Across the street is a fine Pho place called Green Papaya.  All which I frequent.  They will take care of you."
Sean G.,"Anchorage, AK",250,335,68,3.0,2/14/2012,Its like every other Applebee's I had an ok experience nothing popped out and really wowed me.
Daniel T.,"Vancouver, WA",2,4,,3.0,12/6/2012,Bring back the full appetizer happy hour menu and the pork wonton tacos!
Pamela N.,"Vancouver, WA",21,13,1,4.0,2/21/2012,"Well, I tried it again - Same Applebee's location, same result!  Great!  They're changing my mind about the bad reputation they'd earned in the past."
Warren C.,"Portland, OR",115,221,5,1.0,8/1/2011,Its probably been a couple years since I've been inside this Applebee's out here in Vancouver. Back in the days I literally knew the whole staff from the servers all the way to the kitchen staff and management. You would always think that places that have left you quite a bit of memories will always bring you comfort when you step in the door. The case is apparently different with this location of Applebee's.  I walked in here this evening after a meeting with a couple of my associates out here in Vancouver. Seeing that it was almost 10pm there wasn't a whole lot of options around the Mill Plain area so I decided to stop by Applebee's and get some HH food. I walked right in and sat at the bar because I was looking to just get something to eat and go on my way. It took quite a bit of time but finally the bartender was able to assist me after his lengthy conversation about nothing with another customer. I ordered my drink and made my order and spent my time waiting at the bar playing video poker and facebooking on my Blackberry. After quite some time I realized it seems a little longer then normal that my food has not come out yet. I decided to just visually look around and the bartender notices my restlessness and assures me my order was coming in soon. I go through my friends check ins on foursquare and realize it had been 22 minutes since I made my original order. All I ordered was Nachos and and an order of buffalo wings. Its pretty obvious how easy these two orders are but apparently I was wrong. I waited a few minutes more and notice these two guys that had came in 10 minutes after I did had just received their order so I was little irritated by it but willing to let it go. A few more minutes go by and my order finally goes through.  Total time it took to get an order of Nachos and Wings? 32 minutes altogether. I could easily understand the length of time if it was absolutely busy that night but at most there was maybe 10 tables all together that night and it was a Sunday night. I don't have to write this down but its a fairly easy order to fulfill. Other then the wings being fried the rest of this ordered would have been microwaved. I was not a happy camper and no apology was given as a result of the lateness of this order. No reason to sit here and gripe about it so I ate my food and went on my way. Even though I got bad service I will still tip the minimum 15% gratuity. I've worked in the service industry a number of years and feel they still deserve it just out of habit. Thanks for nothing guys... This is the last time you will ever see me here ever again.  This is not eating good in the neighborhood.
Georgette B.,"Vancouver, WA",0,3,,2.0,1/2/2012,"Had not been to Applebee in a while. Usually we would order the Bourbon Street steak with a glass of wine. So Sunday, New Year's day my husband and I decided to pay them another visit. A we entered there were two parties waiting to be seated. So three parties are waiting and there are three tables on the left unoccupied. Well after 20 minutes we were seated at one of those vacant tables. Did not make one bit of sense. Why the wait?  After we were seated we ordered 2 of the steak and shrimp which looked fabulous on the menu. With what appeared to be 2"" shrimps atop the steak, steamed vegies, parsleyed red potatoes. Yum. We ordered 2 Heineken which came promptly, were plunked on the tables without glasses. So we figured, yes we could drink from the bottle, although in my  culture that is not considered cool for a lady to do. Because we were quite hungry, by then it was 2:00pm we ordered a bowl of soup and that came quickly. And was decent. The entree, however, took a while to arrive, and when got it it was cold. I assume it had been sitting a while in some corner of the kitchen as the staff was quite busy tending to the table of 20 next to us. Oh yes they got great service. At our expense it seems. Anyway big disappointment. The order was a miniature version of the picture on the menu. The shrimps were about 1/2"" long, the potatoes had been sitting in water a while, they were cold, and worse the vegies that were supposed to be steamed were raw. And there was a huge clump of broccoli sitting there. Never mind that the steak was so tough that I could not finish it. Worse cut of meat I have ever had. Bye bye applebee. Wish we had gone to McGrath as we had first discussed. Will be wiser next time."
Jeff T.,"Orland Park, IL",143,114,15,2.0,12/9/2010,"So I hadn't stepped foot in an Applebee's in well over a year, and really hadn't felt any kind of loss. But my coworkers wanted to go there and we were in Vancouver, so I went. Nothing from the food made me want to change my opinion, but the waitress was quick with the refills, even though she forgot our chips and salsa, which still sucked when we got em. Until I have to go, like having a gun to my head, or a free meal to try out a whole new menu, I don't plan on going back here or to any Applebee's."
Don D.,"Portland, OR",0,2,,2.0,4/27/2013,After not going to an applebees for years after being served crappy steaks 3 visits in a row my son wanted to go for his birthday so I said yes and regret it. The blackend shrimp pasts was lousy as well a joke microwaved dinner bs. Positive service on wait staff but wont be returning for overpriced frozen food isle dinner again. Yo many other better choices
Ryan R.,"Seattle, WA",17,21,29,3.0,7/17/2008,"Definitely a decent place to eat.  Decent food, decent place, decent atmosphere, decent cost, decent service. Okay, well actually the service was very attentive but there weren't that many people.  All the same, our table got something like four water refills in less than an hour.  Bravo waiter. I usually stay away from Applebee's all the same, exactly for the fact that the food is so regular and unimpressive/American (although tasty for what they offer).  But they do have some decent specials.  Talking happy hour here (3-6pm).  No, the drinks aren't real cheap here, but the appetizers are half of.  Which means a big basket of Boneless Buffalo wings or a plate full of chicken quesadilla.  Not a bad lunch during the summer.  (People always tend to want lighter meals when it's hot.) So not bad at all Applebee's.  You really hit the spot.  I will definitely consider returning when looking for a place to eat out.  Oh, and I love your Teriyaki burger.  I just don't love the $12 price tag."
