Caleb B.,"Vancouver, WA",0,3,,5.0,9/25/2017,"Woohoo! Found the best food place! Who cares what the other reviews say, great location, amazing food, and quality staff, theyre truly paying attention when it comes to dining. Order a burger and watch it come as fast as lightning."
Belial H.,"Vancouver, WA",0,26,,3.0,12/15/2017,If for early dinner about 4:30. Table was a mess. Old dried up food all over and a pile off god knows what stuck to the bottom of the kiosk. I swear nobody cleans those things and I do not touch them until aftet I have ate. Waitress got us fixed up and apologized. We received drinks quick and had food not to far after. Table full of appetizers and food was good to go. All nice and hot and tasty. Waittess was great. If not for the nasty table we would have had a higher rating. We really need half stars. Did I say I do not like those dirty little kiosks??
Ranene R.,"Battle Ground, WA",0,41,55,3.0,9/23/2017,"Good enough. What you would expect for this restaurant chain. Rather salty, but good flavors. Service was good. I recommend this place."
Melissa P.,"Vancouver, WA",0,17,,2.0,11/6/2017,"The service is decent as everyone is kind.  However, the meals that are supposed to be served warm were actually cooled so much that they tasted terrible. I had frozen tomatoes in a salad that I ordered on another visit. I'm done with this restaurant. Don't waste your time, money or taste buds."
Krissy H.,"Ridgefield, WA",71,14,,1.0,1/18/2017,Had the worst service ever !!! Let my daughter pick the place we usually love applebees. ordered French onion soup luckily didn't break my teeth asked waitress to return it that bread was overly stale and hard. Manager came over a few mins. later and proceeded to argue with me that it was a crouton like bread and was suppose to be hard. it was so hard the fork would not go into it after sitting there for 5-10 mins. soaking in the soup! manager said would remove it from bill after a lengthy disagreement. upon getting bill was still on there pointed it out to waitress she apologized and said would have removed. I handed her my card and tanked her  after 20 mins of waiting for my card to be returned and waitress finally coming back the soup was still on there my daughter was getting cranky and so was I so I left without trying to further fix it.  horrible customer service food we did get was horrible
Larry J. H.,"La Center, WA",32,407,1,4.0,1/13/2017,"I always come here on veteran's day with a Buddy or 3 or 4? And 2 or 3 times more times with my wife as she just adores the place!""during the year and have been doing that now for close to 20 years but can't remember exactly?; The food is very good ,The prices are moderate and won't bust your pocketbook?  service also is very good too! Plenty parking space is a winner with me as well!"" 4 stars **** !!"
Tina K.,"Vancouver, WA",0,16,,1.0,5/23/2017,"Been going to Applebee's for years and it continues to go down hill in service . Went in for happy hour cocktail, appetizer and dinner,  to not get my appetizer and was told the drink I was drinking wasn't happy hour price - only because she was to slow to put it in . Had the salad and left to go another place for my appetizer.... tip No Way ! To ensure proper service she didn't understand. Mind you I always tip at least 20 per cent and they should have known me as much as we go .... no more . How do I give this place a big - 0"
Judy H.,"Vancouver, WA",15,8,,1.0,5/14/2017,"Wow, I cannot believe just how bad the food was here tonight.  The service was ok except there was a lack of communication about upcharging stuff that shouldn't have happened. They had some combination plates that I asked about substituting one protein entree for another. The Manager told the server, yes, we can do that without saying anything else. There was no mention of it being put on the bill as an ""addition"" (for an extra $5.99) rather than a substitution; in addition, they told my BF his dinner came with two sides, so he ordered them. No mention of one of the sides having an $0.99 upcharge, either. So my ""dinner"" came, and I use this term loosely for the following reasons.  The 1/2 rack of ""baby back ribs"" were just that: rib bones. They were 95% totally devoid of any meat, period. I would be shocked if I actually got to eat more than 1 or 2 oz. of meat, if that.  The shrimp skewer they charged me an $5.99 ""addition"" rather than a straight substitution it was represented as, came totally undercooked, and I had to send it back to be cooked more. It still looked fairly raw (cooked shrimp should NOT be white, they should be turning pink) but the consistency felt somewhat cooked. But they also came not de-Veined. Gross!!!  What kind of  ""chef"" doesn't de-Vein shrimp????  The broccolli, if it was actually steamed, must've been so for perhaps 15 seconds, because it was virtually raw, and arrived cold--butter didn't even begin to melt on it.  The ""garlic mashed potatoes"" were clearly out of a box, as the consistency was way too stiff.  My BF's steak was halfway decent, although a bit less cooked than he requested. The ""bacon garlic"" green beans he had, had little or no bacon; the mashed sweet potatoes, which he was upcharged for improperly--again, zero communication, were the consistency of, and looked just like, baby food. He couldn't eat them, they were disgusting looking. Neither side looked a bit like how the menu purported it to be. When I asked about these upcharges and lack of proper communication, they just gave  half-assed ""apologies"" which sounded unsincere.  This is absolutely the worst excuse for food I've ever been served at any commercial establishment in my 59 years on this planet.  Avoid this place like the plague. I hope eating that undercooked shrimp doesn't give me food poisoning! The nicest thing I can saw about  this place is the food sucks.   Never again."
Mel U.,"Vancouver, WA",118,13,4,3.0,8/13/2016,Fair / average priced dinner. Not great food. Not amazingly fast service either. But nice waitresses
Peter T.,"Portland, OR",102,521,727,3.0,5/15/2012,"Well, I've officially flipped over - to dirty old man status, where leering at the waitress and hanging on her every word becomes one of the more important elements of my dining out.   At least I haven't gotten to the point where I'm the kind of guy making the disgusting suggestive comments. Point?  My waitress was the highlight of my visit to an Applebee's yesterday.  Everything else is a blur. Almost. Colleague and I stopped by for lunch, he suggested I'd like the ""Cowboy Burger,""  which features a patty topped with onion strings, cheddar, bacon, and bbq sauce. The waitress (what did you say?) overruled him and suggested I go for the Bourbon Black and Blue - with blackened seasoning, bourbon caramelized onions,  mushrooms, bell peppers, jack cheese, Applewood bacon, with smoky mayo. I had her leave the vegetables in the kitchen, and the burger, in and by itself, was pretty good.  Obviously hand-formed, served to my preference when she asked ""do you like it pink or not?"" The fresh toasted buns are a nice touch at Applebee's too.   I don't think I have been in one of their restaurants (there are about 1300 worldwide) for a couple decades, and it's as good a choice as any in the fast casual arena. The fries were doused with a seasoned salt, a little too much for my taste, the taters cut on the chubby side, bordering on crispy. Service was prompt and friendly, with the burger weighing in at just over a sawbuck. I'd go again."
Rick S.,"Vancouver, WA",12,22,2,2.0,7/14/2015,I had a standard burger and it was the burger cheese a couple of real small pieces of Bacon and some sauce.  I would have been better off going over to McDonalds and getting a big Mac for half the price.  The food  really has gone down hill.
Hali S.,"Vancouver, WA",0,6,4,1.0,9/15/2014,Apple bees always has great happy hour and lunch menus. ECEPT they don't have any options for vegetarians and when I asked for a substitute the manager would not work with us. I personally stay away from chicken and red meat due to spiritual/religious reasons and It's very disappointing that a franchise such as this isn't willing to work with their customers. I won't be returning any time soon.
Nenny Z.,"Battle Ground, WA",0,21,4,1.0,4/4/2013,"The service was horrible.  We had to ask for everything we needed at least three times.  Asked for more napkins the minute we sat as there wasn't enough on the table for our party of 7.  By the time we got our lunches we still didn't have the napkins we'd asked for 30 minutes beforehand.    We had to ask many times for refills on drinks, and actually had to remind the waitress to bring the kids drinks in the first place.  We ordered two appetizers.  Fried mozzarella sticks and artichoke dip, both of which were stone cold.  We were given 4 plates for 7 people.  We asked for more plates and they didn't bring them until the appetizers gone and off the table and we had already started eating our lunches.  In fact when the waitress did bring them to us, she didn't even remember why she was bringing them to us.   The portions sizes are small.  The fries that accompanied the burger and sandwiches, while tasty, consisted of 10-15 per plate.  My husband's meal cost over $13 and he was still hungry when we left.   I could go on and on about how lousy the service was, but I think you get the point.   WE WON'T GO BACK and I can not recommend this place to you."
Kevin H.,"Vancouver, WA",0,4,,5.0,1/7/2015,"News Years Eve dinner with the wife and we both enjoyed the food and especially our waitress. She was very attentive even on a busy night, she got my humor so that was a bonus. We will be back."
Taylor C.,"Dickinson, TX",12,21,2,1.0,6/1/2014,"Dirtiest restaurant I have ever been to. In between the cushions was old food and what not. I just felt gross sitting there. It needs a major update and dusting. Chips were most likely tostitos brand and salsa was from the store. Queso had a bland taste. I had a fajita wrap and the chicken was so gross. I had to spit it out. My son got the hamburger kids meal, and it looked like the white castle burgers you can buy frozen. My two year old did not even touch his food and he will eat anything. Never going back to that nasty place."
J And D W.,"Vancouver, WA",0,27,,3.0,9/6/2014,"Good food with reasonable prices. Our server was knowledgeable and made menu suggestions that turned out to be very good. The food was hot and well presented. All Applebee's are not the same as we have seen across the western states. This particular Applebee's was very clean and comfortable. At the end of our visit, we were pleasantly surprised at the food and drink tab."
John K.,"Vancouver, WA",74,52,2,5.0,3/22/2014,"My friend and I went here for lunch, got the 2 for $20 deal.  The salad was Fantastic, the Chicken Alfredo was Fantastic, and the service was really good to, but not Fantastic.  They could have been more attentive to refills of our drinks, but other then that, overall experience was great.  Really good food, nice people, nice environment, very clean.  Thanks for a great lunch! =)"
David R.,"Vancouver, WA",4,23,5,4.0,3/22/2014,"Its applebee's....I didnt exactly go with high expectations but the GF's daughter wanted to go there for her birthday.  Was pleasantly surprised. Food was really good...Service was prompt and the meal was inexpensive.  Seated immediately,  server arrived for our drink order 4 minutes later. Drinks arrived 5 minutes after that, food arrived 14 minutes later. The server gave us a suggestion where we did a 2 for $20 that saved us a little money and we got an appetizer as well, nice suggestion. Ribs were good. Still not exactly destination dining but it was much better than expected."
Phillip F.,"Vancouver, WA",0,1,,1.0,11/7/2014,"One of the worst service I have ever had. I phoned in my order and they said it would be ready in 12-15 minutes, no problem.  I sat in my car waiting for 32 minutes. Everything on my order was wrong. Got back home to realize this. Wife say that they messed up and called and the manager said it was her fault for not saying she did not want the cheddar and instead wanted blue cheese. She told them from the start she wanted blue cheese. The compensation was a coupon."
jade s.,"Camas, WA",164,70,,2.0,6/21/2011,"I can't believe i am actually taking the time to review an Applebee's... First, the disclaimer: I was in the doghouse (for being an ass to my GF) and I was trying to make up by taking her and her daughter to dinner... the daughter picked... enough said. The Service was ALMOST intolerably slow... by that I mean that everytime we started talking about the lack of food or service, she would show up and ask if we needed anything... it's like they had a mic at the booth. We get the French onion soup... it came salty with STRIPS of sliced swiss cheese... hahaha. No I am not kidding! My medium rare steak and grilled shrimp was burnt on one end and raw on the other... again, not kidding. My date had a grilled chicken salad with a balsamic glaze that was actually what we expected and decent.  Her daughter ordered the kids mean with burger... it was the size of a tea bag, so we had to order another one... and I didn't complain ONCE!!! why? because it is an Applebee's and the kid liked the meal and now i am back in the good graces of someone I care for...  So, all in all, I have had way better food almost anywhere, but its Applebees, on a Monday...  What did I expect? not much! and guess what??? I got it."
Jon P.,"Bremerton, WA",0,26,1,5.0,11/17/2014,"I'm going to give them 5 stars just because everything was great and that is different 'cuz, hey this is a Applebee's isn't it? We were here a couple of years ago and it was ok. This time,we were met at the door,shown right to a table and our waitress gave us our menus and gave us a moment to decide on our drinks and they came right away. Ordered the pretzel sticks and beer cheese dip and the pretzels were soft,hot and the sauce was like smooth fondue. The GD ordered the bourbon chicken and shrimp and said it was really good and her boyfriend had the bourbon steak ,which was cooked perfectly. I had a rack of baby back ribs and were among the best I think I've had in any BBQ place. Well,except for one and they aren't open anymore. The wait staff was attentive and not obtrusive. Even the manager came by a couple of times. I don't normally give reviews like this for chain places, but this one deserved it."
Charlotte H.,"Concord, CA",1,6,,5.0,7/21/2012,"So I stopped here with two of my friends on our way up to Seattle from California. We'd been driving all night and were kinda disoriented as far as time goes so when we got to the doors of the restaurant at about 10:45 (15 min. before they opened) we were like 'oh....oh well' and were almost about to leave until the manager came out and let us in early! On top of that both he and our waitress were total sweethearts. For the life of me I canNOT remember their names (this was about 2 months ago.....I only just joined YELP*). In any case, the food was well made, the staff was super courteous, and I have no complaints whatsoever. Yay Applebee's! :)"
Cinderella S.,"Van Nuys, CA",3,54,3,5.0,1/27/2013,"I went here last night, and I had the best steak in a long time.I would go again"
Jocelyn P.,"Federal Way, WA",0,55,,5.0,8/17/2014,One of the best Applebee's I've been to.  Had the Margarita Queso Chicken and Green Goddess salad combo about 3:00 on Aug. 16th.  The chicken was moist and flavorfull the salsa was fresh and the rice was hot and moist.  It was perfect.
Bruce A.,"Vancouver, WA",46,26,6,3.0,8/20/2012,This location has better food and better service than the Applebee's at NW 132nd Street (Salmon Creek).  It's also much larger.   I had the hot beef/bacon/mushroom/onion sandwich with swiss cheese.  My wife had the ribeye and loved it.  We have ordered the same items at Salmon Creek Applebees and they didn't compare. The staff was helpful seating our toddler and friendly.
Matt H.,"Vancouver, WA",0,10,,1.0,8/31/2014,"The Roma tomatoes were green and not Roma's,  the potatoes were not done, the steak was tough. My salad was mostly purple cabbage with large pieces of the stem a.The manager apologized and said he was easy..... that maybe the problem"
PJ W.,"Vancouver, WA",0,18,11,5.0,3/1/2012,"We visit this location often, probably more than any other restaurant, and always have a great experience.  Once, several years ago, my order was not right and I was not charged for the entree - even though it was very good anyway.  I think this particular location is excellent."
Laura S.,"The Dalles, OR",0,5,1,1.0,8/10/2014,"Horrible. Started with us having to move tables because the one they sat us as was completely sticky. The table finish is coming off so it will always be sticky, you should probably maintain your restaurant.  They made half of our table the completely wrong order (they ordered a plain hamburger and got a stuffed hamburger with bacon and cheese), they put the wrong ingredients on the blt of another person, and my wrap was spicy when I was told there would be no spice at all. We had to reorder all new fries because it literally was like the salt shaker lid had come off onto all of our fries. Refills went unfilled numerous times and just all around horrible service. We had to ask that they remake the right hamburgers, because before they just tried bringing out a pile of lettuce, pickles, and tomatoes to make the hamburger ""ok"".  The manager quickly walked by the table to ask if things were ok now, to which we replied ""I guess"" since only two of us were sitting there with plates of food. When we received the check we were expecting some kind of discount for this absolutely HORRIBLE dining experience, but nope. They charged us full price for everything. Our tip to the entire staff there all the way up to the manager: 2 cents."
