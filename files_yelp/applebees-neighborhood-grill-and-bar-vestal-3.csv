Samuel C.,"East Northport, NY",244,2,,5.0,10/10/2017,Really like this applebees. I've been coming a few times when I can get the chance because it's relatively cheap in prices which is awesome for a college student like me. I usually come after 10 which is when the half off apps are. You gotta order a drink (could be any kind) in order to get the deal which is in my opinion such a steal. I usually get the classic boneless buffalo wings and the brew pub pretzels. A great mix of spicy and calm in ur pallete. I would definitely recommend to anybody in the area trying to get a bang for your buck and to spend a nice meal w some friends or a closer friend!
Hasan M.,"San Francisco, CA",89,14,,2.0,9/21/2017,"Honestly food had no flavor. I have ate at different apples bees and this one, everything we ordered was pretty bad.  On a plus side staff was nice. Probably won't ever eat here again"
Shan W.,"Endicott, NY",14,7,8,1.0,6/29/2016,"Would have loved to enjoy my lukewarm food, but the flies landing on it kind of ruined my appetite. The buffalo wings had no sauce and a mysterious french fry looking object on top of them. The potatoes were also cold, with a bunch of unmelted shredded cheese on top. There was also a black hair in my pasta. Keeping it classy, applebees! Edit: thanks Danielle, but I already spoke to the manager and he was extremely rude and dismissive about the situation. I'd rather not speak to him again. Our bill was comped after the second time we found a long, nasty hair in our food, so I would rather just never go to your restaurant again and hopefully anyone else reading this will think twice before they decide to eat there as well."
Plash S.,"Binghamton, NY",27,21,38,3.0,11/15/2015,"First of all, one of only few restaurants that are open late in Binghamton. Servicing absolutely perfect. Even though they ran out of my favorite chipotle sauce but I was happy with the experience. Ribblets were not that great, chicken lime is absolutely amazing and Buffalo wings were slightly overcooked. Price a touch on the higher side but a decent place to hang out."
Joe F.,"Candor, NY",3,23,1,2.0,5/21/2016,"A spur of the moment decision to eat here turned out to be a pretty good idea. We went in on a Saturday afternoon at around 1pm and the restaurant was very busy. Despite this we were seated quickly in one of those booths (must avoid all contact with fellow diners) and our drinks were ordered and delivered shortly thereafter.  Our waiter had taken a shine to an elderly couple nearby and despite our best efforts to get his attention he was deep in conversation. Eventually our food was ordered and compared to other tables within sight it arrived quite slowly, actually being delivered by a different server.  The food itself was really good, well above par for this type of restaurant - TGI Friday, Texas Roadhouse, Outback, Ruby Tuesday etc - and very reasonably priced.  In summary, yes, I would dine here again and hopefully our server would be a little less distracted. Edit: We went again today for lunch and tried ordering via the tablet on each table. Don't bother, nothing will arrive. In the words of our server; ""That doesn't send the order anywhere so don't use it"" Helpful."
Jared B.,"Johnson City, NY",11,53,1,1.0,9/22/2016,Gross... my daughter ordered shrimp and strawberries and the shrimp was undercooked and the strawberries were mush... nothing like what the description says. Not happy.. also 5 millions flies makes it hard to eat.
James J.,"Vestal, NY",0,1,,1.0,4/29/2015,"I WILL NEVER EAT AT AN APPLEBEES AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My food wasn't cooked all the way through, my servers were not welcoming or friendly , they took forever to come to my table, I was left high and dry  I nibbled my food and asked for my check, they asked if I wanted a box I stated no they took my full meal and threw it out rather than too inquire why I would throw everything away....... this is the worst Applebee's I have ever visited and will be the last....DO NOT!!!! DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!"
Nicole A.,"Endwell, NY",1,140,1,1.0,3/28/2016,"Went a few years ago and have not been back since. The first meal I got, tasted like pure salt. It got switched out for steak, totally different than the first. Still like straight salt. My friends food was perfectly fine though. Not sure what it was, but it was disgusting. The one on Front St. is very good!"
Tommy H.,"Vestal, NY",0,11,,2.0,6/22/2016,Seems service is slipping again....wait staff need to be attention to tables instead of talking to each other and checking cell phones
Ryan B.,"Johnson City, NY",0,9,1,1.0,9/7/2015,"Came to Applebee's because me and my girlfriend had a gift card. Worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Just to get drinks it took ten minutes, all we got was water. Ordered our appetizer at the same time of our entrees. We waited for almost an hour before receiving any food, which was the appetizer and entree at the same time. Food was cold and wasn't the right order. The server never came back until she gave us the check. Never would come back again even with a gift card."
Justin V.,"Ithaca, NY",21,143,13,1.0,2/28/2014,"Worst applebees I've ever EVER been to. We came in at 10pm after driving an hour to Binghamton and needed a late night dinner (should've done Fridays but whatever) Applebees in Ithaca is great so we decided to go to the Vestal one. We were seated outside the bar area and after asking about the half price apps was told we needed to sit in the bar area. We didn't feel like moving as we already had our drinks and had settled in so that was fine. The drinks arrived 20 minutes after we were sat down. We ordered our food and our waitress disappeared for a half an hour. A bunch of SUNY B guys walked in and were sat by our waitress who started talking to them. I listened in and they too asked about the half price apps and she said to them that she normally needs to sit them in the bar area for that but that she'll let them go ahead and order them! If I hadn't ordered I would've walked right the heck out of there, I was pissed. She turned and I asked for a refill on my water and she said just a moment she had to get their drinks... She brought them their drinks, ordered their food and started walking away... 10 minutes later after that table had all their food ordered and their drinks at their table (40-45 minutes after we came in) we finally had our food to our table. She then took our drinks to refill them. She never returned. She brought the other guys their apps and their food and sat their and talked to them for a good 10 minutes. I lost my appetite and only ended up eating 2-3 bites of my honey pepper chicken tenders. My wife was even furious. When we were brought our check she said ""oh yeah you needed a refill! What did you have to drink?"" we only had water but I told her to forget it. We paid, left no tip and left without our leftovers because I just didn't want them. I was so tempted to speak to a manager or call the next day and I NEVER do that. I never did, I just am never coming back here. When my wife and her friends were hanging out the night before our wedding and they went to Fridays, the night after our wedding we went out with friends to Fridays because their service is phenomenal. Idk what our waitresses deal was but lady, you don't deserve to be in this business and you just lost a few customers because none of my friends and family are coming back here after we told them what happened."
Quinn V.,"Vestal, NY",0,1,,5.0,2/4/2016,"We ordered 2 of the signature lunch combos, car side to go. super easy to order online, quick pick up time, and we both enjoyed our meal! Everything tastes great! Especially the new Kicken Turkey Stacker! Will definitely order again!"
Luke W.,"Binghamton, NY",0,7,,1.0,11/20/2011,"The service was slow. Got 2 for $20 w/ my dad asked for ranch not blue cheese w/ boneless wings, came out w/ the blue cheese, asked a second time for ranch, and again It came out with blue cheese. Cups were empty for a few minutes. Biggest problem was they still can't cook steak both steaks ordered medium both came out well. Every time we order steak medium it comes out well going to start ordering rare and hope they over cook it to perfection."
David W.,"Owego, NY",0,22,,5.0,6/11/2011,"We did the 2 meals for $20, the best I've had in years. And you can't beat the price. Took enough home, for 2 more meals."
