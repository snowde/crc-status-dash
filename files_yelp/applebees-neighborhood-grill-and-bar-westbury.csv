Jen N.,"Floral Park, NY",95,108,238,4.0,12/4/2017,"I used to love going to Applebees when I was younger but haven't gone for awhile, but I'm happy to say that the food and service is still great! Honestly I came back for the dollarita which (although expectedly watered down) is delicious and I could taste a bit of tequila. As for the food they still make my favorite: the chicken oriental salad which has a great variety of textures and a good crunch while still being sweet yet savory. Other favorites are the fiesta salad and the bourbon street steak. I also really love their triple chocolate meltdown for dessert which I have tried to replicate but in the end I must go to Applebees for the real stuff. The service is still great. My only complaint is that the electronic service tablet on the table doesn't seem to work really well."
Linda D.,"New York, NY",142,178,5316,4.0,11/27/2016,"After a days of shopping we needed to get something to eat and decided to stop by Applesbees. If you come to Westbury to shop they seem to be located on the opposite side of all the establishments. So I'm assuming that why they don't tent to get as busy as other places. The establishment is clean and maintained.  The staff are friendly, warm and welcoming.  They were well staffed. Our waiter Rome was kind and friendly.  They have a parking lot.  There past specials were far better than they ones they have now (especially the steak ones). This applies to all Applebees.  We came for lunch time and it was busy but no wait.  Our entrees were well served but the portion was small but tasty.  They also have free wifi.  They also do have take out if you want."
Kristina R.,"Plattsburgh, NY",0,2,1,1.0,10/13/2017,"The guy at the front ""Peter"" is very rude and unwelcoming! We got seated, took forever to get the appetisers. I understand he wait time if they're busy. We got our chips and they're crushed. My fiancé asked for his steak to be well down, it came back pink. Lastly, they have a promo going on where if they don't mention the speciality drinks, you get a free app during your next visit. Our waitress did not mention the promo to is and when I brought it up to her, she doubted me over and over again. Alas, I dropped it and moved on. Applebees really need to step their game up!"
Kathy P.,"East Meadow, NY",0,30,2,4.0,11/11/2017,Today being a holiday Veterans Day. It was crowded at 6:00. The reason is because this establishment gives Veterans a free meal.  To me that's an important thing when other restaurants do nothing. We stopped by at 4:30 with no wait.  Food is good for fast food restaurants but the people working here is what makes it worth it. Not expensive good portions tasty. Again I've been here a few times because it's better than a hamburger place for the same price. Bathrooms very clean.
Rachel S.,"East Meadow, NY",743,832,2223,3.0,11/21/2016,"Had to use my gift card so finally decided to give Applebees in Westbury a shot. I was warmly greeted when I entered, seated in a comfy booth and given a brief time to browse the menu before Naya, the server approached. I orders the cedar grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and green beans $16.99. The food arrived within a reasonable amount  of time and was freshly cooked. The salmon was grilled and had a nice crisp on the outside. The mashed potatoes were chunky and smooth and had a good garlic buttery flavor. The green beans were slightly overcooked  and drenched in oily garlic powder. Overall it's a good dish but much smaller and not as pretty as the promotional photo in the menu. It seemed that the server was in a rush to get away because she wouldn't wait for me to order; I had to call her back, to order, request the check, and again to pay. The bathrooms are clean, and there is plenty of parking."
Marcia D.,"Manhasset, NY",392,166,759,3.0,10/9/2016,"Small secret Apple Bee will host your next fundraising event for a small fee. Don't expect your regular menu items. Breakfast only will be served, nothing to fancy! I enjoyed a platter of pancakes, scrabbled eggs, and sausages.  Traditional beverages were served: coffee, tea, or OJ.  The scheduled breakfast fundraiser hours are earlier than the normal business hours 8am to 10am. Typical Applebee's does not serve breakfast. Remember its a fundraiser hopefully your contributing to a good cause. I know I was."
Emma S.,"East Meadow, NY",3,25,2,4.0,10/19/2017,We went with a party of 8 for my daughters birthday on a Sunday at 5:30. We called about an hour before and even though it was super busy our table was ready when we arrived. Our waitress was excellent and so nice! Managers were really great too kept checking in to see how everything was. Food came out quick and was yummy Applebees burgers and boneless wings and what not. The house merlot wine was really good too. Excellent service and was a fun time. We go often.
Sara C.,"Glen Cove, NY",14,53,89,5.0,10/5/2016,"I like it here. The mozzarella sticks are pretty standard and the pretzel sticks are really good. If you go after 10:00pm the apps are half-price. I will either get the cheeseburger or a steak. The chili fries are really good. For dessert I get the brownie bite. There is a bigger size too, but I am usually too full for the full size."
Jay J.,"Hempstead, NY",0,6,9,1.0,12/10/2017,So I just left Applebee's and I must say I will never spend my money there again...my husband and I both order steak well done when we got the food but steaks were soooo uncooked. I cut into the steak and the blood from it was all in the mash and fries that I had for a side I didn't eat anything ...not to mention the food was cold. If I could give them 0 stars I would...
Murtuza H.,"South Brunswick Township, NJ",450,8,2,4.0,6/3/2017,"Food was great. Walked in at 1am and we ordered 3 orders of mozzarella sticks, one order of Sriracha shrimp, soup, and the cookie Oreo ice cream, all of which were fantastic - hit the spot.  Only knocking off one star for the lack of quickness in service. We waited a little bit before our waters and apps came out but no complaints on the waitress, she was kind and did her best with all her orders at the time.  Overall, enjoyed the late night meal. Thanks Yelp for showing us this Applebees in the area that was open this late."
Dan L.,"Glen Cove, NY",125,2,,1.0,10/9/2017,I don't know if the waitress we had was having a bad day or what. Got a bad attitude from her the whole time I was there. She seemed friendly to those around us though. The place wasn't packed but she seemed to disappear right after we ordered our food. She added an extra drink to our bill as well but seeing as it was $1 margarita I left it on there for fear of waiting another 20 mins til I got the check. If I was to go back and see her I'd go to a different restaurant. The waitress in question wasnt a kid either otherwise id chalk it up to her just being a kid. The rest the wait staff seemed lost as well brining the wrong food and drinks to tables. Mind you the place wasn't packed at all. Here's to hoping someone else doesn't get the same treatment.
Leena T.,"Yonkers, NY",39,201,155,2.0,1/29/2016,"Pros: Half-priced apps Cons: everything else Ok-- minor exaggeration. Their tacos are pretty good too, but everything else is so lackluster. Service was alright, but my beer wasn't a full pour (serious pet peeve), the nachos are a poor excuse for nachos (come on people, not that hard to get right), and the wings were not as hot and crispy as expected. Sad times."
Sam S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,,1.0,11/12/2017,Went here on Veteran's Day for a meal. The waiter Johnny was so rude to veterans. He didn't give us silverware and provided poor customer service. He was racist and discriminated veterans. His demeanor showed he didn't want to work there's
Alexandra D.,"Long Beach, NY",172,240,1474,3.0,5/16/2016,"I've seen some wild stuff happen here.  Guys getting rowdy at the bar trying to fight the bartender, waitresses that ignore tables and expect clients to order through the tablets or force people to leave on a check because she's out in the back doing lord knows.  All these awful experiences are at night when they're busy and packed with kids trying to grab a cheap meal. Understandable that they can get irritated serving for awful tips. But when grown folk walk in; you'd think they would appreciate us a little more. Sure not.  Don't get me wrong; there are good waitresses and waiters here. I've met some really nice people. But I absolutely recommend you come during the day.  I've never had problems with the food. Just like any Applebee's anywhere. And the happy hour is worth the price but you may be disappointed with a waitress that tries to cut you off at two."
Kun C.,"Orangeburg, NY",3,1,,1.0,5/21/2017,"The service was horrible. Our server didn't even bring us our drinks and plates until a minute after our appetizer came out. And, when we wanted our check, our server wandered around, completely ignoring us, so we had to ask another person for the check. We waited around 20 minutes for our check, and it was frustrating. I will never eat here again. The service could be better, and we didn't even get a proper apology."
Melissa M.,"New York, NY",49,57,154,3.0,12/28/2016,The food was too salty and was ok. I requested. Frozen pomegranate margarita in a 'mucho' size. It was too sour and watered down.
Sasha H.,"Mineola, NY",0,33,1,1.0,5/13/2017,First step I took in I noticed it had that old furniture smell. We had a baby with us and yet they took us to a booth. Didnt mind until i sat down and realized how narrow the sitting space was. Im a small person and still it was too narrow for me. The host said the table can be moved over but that would just make it crowded for the person across from me. I dont know if all the booths are like that but this was ridiculous. We asked to order take out and the server told us to order through their take out system and showed us a spot in the corner where all the servers were huddled and swiping credit cards. We were given a menu where it was incredibly awkward to stand around being in everyones way with a baby in our arms. Was not worth wasting any time there.
Karissa T.,"Queens, NY",48,81,10,1.0,9/6/2016,"Consistently terrible food and service. Servers act like they're doing you a favor by taking your order. You wait forever to be seated as you watch them laugh, joke and play around and do nothing. When your server finally arrives, it takes another 15 minutes for a drink, another 45 minutes for food.  If you love inconsistent food, service and a loud atmosphere, this Applebees is at your ""service""."
K H.,"New York, NY",0,9,2,4.0,7/23/2017,"I came here at around 11:30 in the morning and didn't see that there were a lot of customers. I hesitated at first because the reviews online were a bit mixed, but I decided to give this Applebee's a try anyway. I was seated promptly and my order was taken. I ordered the Whisky Bacon Burger, which was delicious! Came put exactly the way I ordered it--medium well. The staff there are kind and as time went on, more customers showed up, so it wasn't a ghost town. If I'm in the area again, I wouldn't mind popping in for another meal!"
Steven G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,,1.0,7/16/2017,"The service was OK but the food was horrible. The only reason I was at this place is because I had to use a gift card that I got as a gift.  THE FOOD IS EXTREMELY LOW QUALITY AND TASTELESS. I order a simple dish, grill cutlet chicken with shrimps. Nothing fancy. Price $16.99  What I actually got was a four  inches in  length and three inches in width chicken cutlet and four tiny shrimps that are each half inch in length.  This place is a total dump."
Derek M.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",383,156,255,3.0,3/28/2016,"I almost forgot about this Applebees because of their location being separate from the adjacent plaza of other restaurants. It was quite easy to find and I was able to find parking quite easily. Came here last night for dinner of 2 and we were told that the wait would be 20 mins to be seated. I found that strange because I saw that there were several seats at the bar open as well as five 2 people tables open. Regardless we sat down in the waiting room and looked at the menu. We were actually seated in about 10 minutes and were all ready to order by then. We went with the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and got the 3-cheese Cavatappi and Bourbon street chicken & shrimp. The mozzarella sticks came out quite fast however their quality was not the best. The cheese inside the mozzarella was a bit chewy for my preference and was served at room temperature instead of hot. The bourbon street chicken and shrimp was also not the best. The chicken was tender a tid bit juicy, while the shrimp was lacking flavor for me. It also comes with a side of potatoes wedges on the side. Towards the end of our meal, we had to search for our waitress because we were in a crunch to catch a movie. However throughout the meal our waitress was not very present with us, we only saw her once in the beginning and once our food was delivered, but then nowhere to be found when we were done.  Overall - This isn't really the place I crave to eat because it's comparable to below average diner food and even their ""healthy"" selections are typically not fresh tasting. However it is a nice place to hang out with a group of people and share different appetizers and entrees with. I'd come here again with a group of people but not really on my own accord."
A M.,"Smithtown, NY",47,11,3,1.0,6/21/2017,This Applebees is not the best place to go. Granted there have been several times that have been good it is really hit or miss as to the service and the food quality. Most recently I ordered an oriental chicken salad and it came out with chicken and those crunchy noodles and salad dressing but no lettuce!!! I told the others I was dining with to start eating and I would just get the waitress to replace it. Well they finished eating and we still waited before the waitress or anyone came over!! When I showed her the salad and asked her for the manager she gave me a snotty response. The manager apologized and offered to remake the salad however I told him the others had finished and I would just like the cost taken off the bill since it was not what I ordered. (I did eat chicken off it though). Anyway this is just one of the bad times we had. There was another time that my husband and I went there and the waiter was so slow With everything and the food came out and was cold!
Kyla L.,"Roslyn Heights, NY",165,1,,3.0,5/26/2017,"The food was good as always, but once again I was given Brittany as my server, she is a horrible server and never comes to the table to ask how things are and if she does come to the table it isn't for like 30 mins and doesn't know how to tend to the customers needs and I have already complained to the manager but she gets worse everytime! Other servers that work that where are great, they always remember our drinks!"
Ren M.,"Carle Place, NY",93,1,,5.0,1/18/2017,"Have had the server Michelle multiple times, by far the best there is at this location!!!!!"
Hibah R.,"East Meadow, NY",0,2,6,1.0,5/20/2016,"I found that the USDA Crispy Brewhouse Chicken was awful. I went home sick to my stomach and unsatisfied. The dish had a lot of potential but the potatoes weren't cooked properly, the chicken was raw, and there wasn't enough sauce.  The fried onions on top were superfluous. In general the dish was horrible, I highly advise you not to order it."
Fran P.,"Hempstead, NY",0,8,7,3.0,11/6/2016,Food was very good. Plates not so clean and their latest technology(pad). Was not working. Service was very nice
Nichole K.,"Brooklyn, NY",50,146,1,5.0,8/25/2016,"I had a very good meal here. I had the shrimp salad with champagne vinaigrette. The grapefruit was a little more tart than usual for grapefruit, but the salad was tasty. The enchilada soup was good. My server was nice and attentive. The biggest thing I hate about corporate restaurants is the stupid upsell. I don't mean the, ""do you want to add a soup."" I mean the, ""hi, welcome to Applebee's, can I start you off with an Oreo shake or a beer."" It sounds so forced and demeaning. As if they don't have enough junk to fill up the table when you sit down, now they are forcing their servers to repeat what is already flashed in your face. This includes an obvious threat to the staff. I'm sure they wouldn't get in trouble if this happened. Right. Not to mention all the people in the world who don't care about other people and lie. The food was good. The server was nice, but the people who work in corporate are so out of touch with what the people who don't own restaurants really want. Like a movie critics who give one star to a movie that everyone loves."
Wally S.,"Yonkers, NY",20,16,2,1.0,8/4/2016,Horrible service food was late cold manager was very rude servers are very rude I asked for medium rare burger I got well done when I asked why they told me this is how they make their medium rare burger
Cristi G.,"Hempstead, NY",0,12,,5.0,12/31/2016,"Great time...sat at the bar for lunch yesterday . The bartender, Natasha was awesome - super friendly, and great drinks :)"
Priscilla R.,"Uniondale, NY",19,184,537,5.0,5/25/2015,"Memorial Day. Stopped  in for a quick bite., Quickly  greeted by their host Sade. She walked  us too a booth. Immediately  introduced  their  drinks special and desserts  options.  My Classic & Classic  lunch offer was very light and fulfilling. Also enjoy a good Ceasar  Salad.  Chicken  wrap was very tasty along with their side sauce.  An after order was placed for their cookie sundae. Honestly  didn't  expect such a large portion., enormous. Chocolate  chip cookie as its based. Topped with tow vanilla  scoops of icecream. Drizzled with hot fudge and oero clusters.      Truth be told. I could  not  finish it all. (Smiling).  Service  was friendly.  Everything  was clean and decor in order."
Gael M.,"Queens, New York, NY",156,189,85,4.0,5/22/2014,First time to this Applebee's last night. Overall good experience.  The host was personable and chatted with us so the 25minute wait wasn't that bad. Our server was attentive. The drinks were good. Food came out perfect. I would definitely return here.
Christian Z.,"Carle Place, NY",0,4,5,3.0,7/16/2015,"Rice is on the dry , not fully cooked side, steak is 7/10 just about average. I would not recommend it nor would ever reorder it. Not overall bad but not good either. I just have not been he in a while and now I remember why, food is not exceptional."
Maly A.,"New York, NY",158,665,1206,3.0,1/26/2014,"I typically avoid chain restaurants. Not a fan - at all. But we were running errands in the area so stepped in to grab a quick lunch as it was the most convenient option at the time.  I do like their Santa Fe Chicken salad. Although the shrimp with lemon sauce entree that my aunt ordered was half decent too. Our server was good, very efficient. Pleasant experience."
Jessica S.,"Brooklyn, NY",456,231,1375,4.0,6/7/2013,"Have been visiting this location for years. Its conveniently location near several shopping complexes....lol.  Standard Applebee's, plenty of parking. Always presentable, nice and clean. Service is great most of the time, every now and then you get the lazy ""I don't want to be at work"" type waiter/waitress. We have waited a while for our food here. Sometimes the manager comes over to ask how our dinner was, that's very nice of you sir! Food: lets start with the apps, as most of us do. My fave classic app are the boneless bbq wings....bbq sauce on these bite sides pieces of white meat chicken is super good! New fave app, grilled chicken wonton tacos, chicken taco in a wonton shell topped with slaw and cilantro....yummalious! These are my faves, but they have lots of yummy stuff like spinach and artichoke dip, potato twisters, and steak quesadillas towers. Moving on to dinner, always good, I usually get the fiesta lime chicken, tangy chicken served with tortilla strips, pico de gallo, and rice, so fresh, so flavorful, so good! I also like the zesty roma chicken and shrimp and the napa chicken and portabellas, both are really good! My honey will get steak or a burger from them and he is never disappointed.  Dessert: 3 words for you....Triple Chocolate Meltdown, chocolate caked with fudge in the center, topped with hot fudge and a side of vanilla ice cream....back away folks...this could be dangerous!!!  I love that applebee's has a weight watchers menu and a under 550 calories menu, think that's a really cool option.  Price is reasonable, they have 2 for $20 menu that is great!! Great location, great ""chain""....will continue being an applebottom...haha"
Hailey L.,"Buffalo, NY",5,25,6,2.0,12/31/2014,"Applebee's is Applebee's but the staff is inattentive, condescending, and doesn't know the menu. It seemed like it was the entire staff's first night.  But, like I said, Applebee's is Applebee's. You get what you pay for. You shouldn't go to any chain restaurant expecting anything but mediocrity.  Also, if you want to know the beer list here, just get up yourself and go look. I think the waitress just rallied off all the generic beers she could think of off the top of her head."
Jones J.,"Great Neck, NY",326,94,1,1.0,12/28/2014,"It would be a much better spot if they had better service.  They also didn't clean up our appetizers plates which lead to them shoveling main entrees and spilling the LI iced tea.  None of the people the winter or manager offered to refill the drink and them went on and charged it As a full drink on the bill.  What a joke, I'll stick to the NHP Applebee's so thanks.   Good luck with your business model and pathetic customer service."
Alexis R.,"Floral Park, NY",335,630,170,3.0,11/25/2014,Im redoing my review because I returned to this applebees on a double date and I had a better experience. I was served my a server named Brandon who was friends with my date. I enjoyed his service and he was really attentive. I ordered the strawberry lemonade with fiesta lime chicken. I enjoyed my entree and my drink. I had a pleasant experience and I will return.
Carol N.,"East Meadow, NY",17,31,,2.0,8/17/2014,"We did the 2 for $20 special and you get what you pay for. We started with our favorite appetizer, honey BBQ boneless wings, which were good as always. My husband got the chicken tenders platter, a straightforward dish of chicken with fries. It was downhill from there. I made the mistake of ordering the riblet platter, which was just shy of inedible. I substituted onion rings for fries and was disappointed with them. They looked and tasted like frozen. The riblets were not good. They were tiny little pieces of bone with the odd scrap of tasteless meat clinging every now and then. They were drowning in BBQ sauce, which I am still burping at bedtime. I ordered a simple coke to go with the meal and it was so bad I had to send it back. Our server, Quinson, explained that there was some problem with the soda fountain and the syrup but it almost wasn't drinkable.  By the way, my husband usually finishes anything on my plate and even he couldn't bring himself to eat the riblets. The server was outstanding and really tried very hard but you can't make up for mediocre food. I need to stop eating at chain restaurants, or at least learn to lower my expectations."
Jake J.,"Elmont, NY",8,173,80,5.0,9/23/2014,Excellent service by the waiter and the check in personnel. I was extremely impressed. The drinks were great and my shrimp scampi was so good!!   This is by far the best Applebee's experience I've ever had I strongly recommend coming here
Lisa K.,"West Babylon, NY",0,3,,3.0,6/22/2016,This location is not bad. But the last time I visited I was very displeased with the bartender. I believe the name was Tatiana she was rude and did not ask if I needed utensils for my food and I didn't get any napkins. She was just unprofessional.
