Cortney W.,"Brooklyn, NY",533,366,1044,4.0,1/5/2013,"My cousin and I went here after a 10 hour shopping mission in Roosevelt Field and I was pleasantly surprised. We only waited about 2 minutes for a table and we were promptly seated. The restaurant had the typical Applebee's decor.  Nothing special.  Basketball was on every screen.  We arrived just in time because right behind us was a rush of teenagers.   But let's get down to business here. The waitress was very attentive and quick. Definitely on top of her game.  We ordered a red apple sangria to share (buy 1, get 1) and 4 appetizers.  After 10 PM is half price!  That's right, half price!  We never see any need to set foot in an Applebee's before then.  So for the appetizers, the green beans were really good.  They came with a yummy dipping sauce.  They were crispy and hot.  We got the regular boneless buffalo wings.  Always a hit.  We also ordered mozzarella sticks and the beer battered pretzels which came with a cheesy sauce and spicy mustard. The pretzels were my least favorite.   The bill for the two of us came to about $25 which was fabulous. This is an okay location in my book."
Luis P.,"Woodhaven, Queens, NY",150,7,1,5.0,5/5/2016,"It's very hard to believe that they're so many negative reviews at this location.  I had just got out of Cozymel's which is located 2 doors down pretty much in the same area. Being that it was Cinco DE Mayo "":Cozymel's were extremely overcrowded being that it is a Mexican food chain . I decided to check out the ""Applebee's "" which was also a little packed but not so bad . I was seated with my guests no more then 5 mins . The Hostess (Brittany) was one of the most Charmest & very professional girls , she was a total sweetheart . LISA was our server and she was just as amazing , very quick to take our order and very very attentive to us . Our drinks came out quicker then we thought and we're very outstanding.  Our starters came out quick as well as our entrees . Service was more then we expected it to be especially on Cinco DE Mayo . Our last drink for the night took a little longer being that it was getting more crowded . The Manager (Burch) came over quickly and apologized for taking long with the drinks . It was no biggy to us cause everything else nailed it. Manager comped us on the drinks which were ""Patron Margaritas "" Mucho size , and also comped us on Dessert . This was our first time at this Location.  I highly recommend this location and I will absolutely be returning again. Thanks , to a wonderful staff ."
Terrell C.,"Westbury, NY",0,30,,5.0,9/18/2015,"Always great service here. Great food, most importantly the waiters and waitresses are very friendly."
Samantha C.,"New York, NY",158,1,,1.0,9/15/2015,"Having waited tables i'm very easy to please... This was the worst service I've ever seen in my life.  Don't ignore the rest of the Yelp reviews like I did, go to a different Applebee's."
Ann T.,"Uniondale, NY",0,6,,3.0,5/10/2016,Happy hour has a nice sangria for cheap. Love the siracha shrimp and the sweet potatoes fries. The new gadget on the table where you can order your appetizers from are cool. You do not have to yell to get the waiter or waitress just push the button.
Christina A.,"Bayside, NY",34,21,10,1.0,4/27/2014,"I go to Applebee's at least once a week if not more. This Applebee's was just the worse. Aside from the Long Island ones having a different menu then in queens, the food is totally different in portion. The people working are slow, all my servers I've ever had here were slow and forgot about me, and the portion of dipping sauce is crazy! I go for half off apps all the time and at this Applebee's they gave me just enough for half a pretzel mind you they give you 4. When I complained the server told me that's the portion. I highly doubt that. I'm pissed no manager came over but I did see him correcting a lot of people's late and wrong food. I won't be going back to this one!"
Kay. K.,"Brooklyn, NY",742,227,2198,3.0,3/28/2014,Ummm......food was okay not good but...our waitress Emily was okay also....reason for saying okay its because the hot wings was cold and the the  Fiesta chicken salad was the chicken inside was cold even though it was said to be hot......So overall the only thing was good was the entrees. ..Thank God for that cause we thought it was going to be cold also
Stan S.,"Island Park, NY",129,376,338,3.0,8/22/2013,"Typical Apple Bee's. So-so service. So-so food. 1/2 price appetizers -- specifically the quesadilla is always great on a late-night dinner/snack. The 2-for 1 drink specials on late nights suck.. waste of $, very weak drinks. But I guess that's typical of all of their drinks. And that sums up this Apple Bee's location."
Megan M.,"Town of Hempstead, Long Island, NY",10,12,3,4.0,7/22/2015,"We stopped in for a quick dinner before our movie started at the theater down the block, little did I know we chose to go here on a night they were giving a free appetizer and dessert (July 21,2015) so the place was packed. When we were walking in one of the hostesses greeted us and held the door for us, we were sat immediately by the very friendly host. Our waiter (Ryan) was absolutely great. He was running all over the place trying to get everyone everything they needed. Our order came out 100% correct and he was quick to get us refills of our drinks. (I noticed he dealt with a table next to us very calmly, I wouldn't have been able to keep my cool like he did.) I ordered the quesadilla burger, very unique and delicious. My fiancé ordered the sweet Asian pineapple burger, he enjoyed his food as well. We noticed a little ad on the table for AMC movie tickets from them for $9 (you can buy one ticket with each adult entree purchased) it comes out to $2.50 cheaper than buying them at the theater, which worked out perfect because we were going to the movies after dinner. Overall a good experience."
Adrian C.,"East Meadow, NY",46,15,16,1.0,7/29/2015,"Great prices for average food and horrible horrible service. From the moment you walk in you are left waiting at an empty podium.. Left there as the ""servers"" screw around with each other, joking, laughing, talking doing everything BUT greeting guests at the door- we stood there long enough for me to watch most of the sports highlights on the tv. That being said we were finally sat at a table where... you guest it we waited and waited and waited for our server- once he came he began with his very well trained speech of specials and blah blah blah.... We asked for 2 waters with lemon and a few appetizers.  I eat in many places from lower end to very high end, I have been in/around the industry for many years- I am realistic and have real world expectations and I know this is ONLY an Applebee's BUT COME ON- a ridiculously long wait just to be seated? Add to it a long wait just to meet our server to put in drinks?  In all fairness we have been here several times- have had a few issues Not every time BUT most of the time-"
Valerie B.,"New Hyde Park, NY",105,314,458,3.0,8/23/2013,"Anthonese S was nice but slow. It took forever to get drinks and food. The food itself was good. I love the two for twenty deal that my friend and I were able to share. Everything was hot when it came out which is good. But let's face its, it's Applebee's this is not four or five star cuisine."
Ricardo C.,"East Meadow, NY",9,7,,2.0,8/5/2015,"very disappointed with the product, and looking at the menu I see the picture of the FAJITAS dish it looks fantastic,...so base on that I order the fajitas. Service was ok or server when he look around never look at my empty glass of ice tee, I have actually to stop him and ask for a refill,...my fajitas came,..mmmm what a disappointment if compared with the picture on the menu we where very much lost, my wife said, do not complain just eat, I did, by the way the compliments where about a tablespoon of guacamole, sour cream, 6 slides of jalapenos and 3 flour tortillas,...at that point I complain to the server and he gave more flour tortillas and some sour cream,...when we finished I have a bad taste on my mouth with a big deceiving advertising menu, called the manager and explain and he just said, we tried to make food and is very difficult to make all look like the pics in the menu,...so be ware, consistency, training of cooks, is what creates a good restaurant, I'll be more careful next time, or go to another place where they really know how to please the costumer,.."
Nathan Z.,"West Hempstead, NY",8,21,,4.0,2/17/2015,"Ive been here a few times, it's your typical Applebees.  Never had to wait to be seated or had a super long wait to get my food.  Food has always been your typical Applebees food.  You should know what to expect if you're going to an Applebees. They have decent wifi which is always a plus."
Ashley M.,"Albany, NY",164,7,3,1.0,1/2/2015,"Food tastes pretty good like all other Applebee's but the service is absolutely horrible. I've come here several times with my friends for half off apps and while the food tasted great the waiters would always forget about us, not ask if we were ok, and has forgotten an item before. I went for lunch on a Tuesday as well to see if it was just the timing but our waitress was extremely rude and slow. Would not recommend!!"
Kathryn N.,"Glenolden, PA",35,42,4,2.0,2/20/2013,"While I have definitely had good and bad service at Applebee's before, this trip was pretty bad.  We were visiting my brother that goes to school in NY, and decided to go to Applebee's for lunch. Seemed like it would be a decent choice on a Monday afternoon. Not. While it was Presidents' day, and people were off, it should not have taken nearly as long as it did to get our food.   We got seated around 12:45 pm, and our food came out at about 2pm. Three out of the five of us got the soup and salad/entree lunch special. It's Applebee's, it's not like they are cooking the food fresh!  While we are assuming that our order was misplaced or something happened, because without having to be asked, the manager came to our table and comped the entire meal before the food FINALLY came out. While I applaud her handling of the situation, the waitstaff was barely ever seen, and they were pretty indifferent to the situation.  My favorite part of the whole ordeal was when the waitress was prompted with the question of the soup of the day, and she responded by reading all of the regular soup choices and chili.   I would suggest to not order the French onion soup, as it tasted pretty weird, and the Lemon Shrimp choice for the lunch was nothing to write home about. I will just stick with my usual after 9 trips to Applebee's for their Pomegranate Perfect Margarita and boneless wings."
Miguel N.,"Westbury, NY",50,8,30,4.0,11/11/2014,Nice place good wait staff friendly family  atmosphere  and they Honor Veteran's  it's happy hour the sam Adams winter lager is excellent . BIG Thanks to you for Honoring  Veteran's  it means a lot
Paul B.,"Great Neck, NY",99,217,52,1.0,6/6/2014,"Nice servers/bartenders, but food is horrendous. The food is cheap and it shows. Yes, you get a lot for the money, but sometimes, that is not always a good thing. Pretty good beer selection, so if you're just going for a beer w/some friends, i'd recommend. If you're going for dinner, i'd steer clear."
Kristin H.,"East Rockaway, NY",0,3,,2.0,1/16/2016,"Went at approximately 11:30 pm, to partake in the half off appetizer and half off drinks deal. Our server did not come over after we sat down, so we ordered via the touch pad at the table, much to the waitresses' chagrin. Aside from ordering on the touchpad, we physically asked for refills which never happened, and every time we needed something, rather than the waitress checking on us we had to ""call her"" via the touchpad. When we finally got our refills the waitress threw down the straws in an aggressive manner. Every other restaurant I've been to, I've never had to use the touchpad because the waitstaff was attentive. Such was not the case last night. I will obviously come back to Applebees as a whole, but surely not the one in Westbury. She really put a damper on what was otherwise a fine night."
Andrea B.,"East Meadow, NY",86,38,13,1.0,1/15/2013,I've given this Applebee's location many chances. But honestly: The portions are small The prices are too high for the amount and quality of the food  Cross the street and go to Chilis.
Margaret C.,"Wethersfield, CT",2,6,,1.0,10/18/2014,"The worst Applebee's I have ever been to. We waited and waited for our server to come, however, once our order was taken, it did not take too long for our food arrived. My experience went into a tailspin when I found a piece of hair in my rice. I sent it back only to discover another piece of hair in the second dish they sent out. I did not ask for a third. The manager took my chicken off the bill and gave us a gift certificate for $10, however, we had to ask for the bill after I had sent back my dish the second time and then we had to wait 10 more minutes before we got our bill. Overall, the worst dining experience of my life. I will never be coming back."
