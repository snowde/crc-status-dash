Billy M.,"Westbury, NY",0,54,,3.0,9/26/2015,"This location has received a lot of poor reviews, but the New Hyde Park location is closer to me and I think this one is the better one. The food is not always great but it is much better as far as the waiters always checking on us and seating is a lot faster. I cant say I go here a lot but when I do I'm some what satisfied."
Paul D.,"Queens, NY",303,203,2521,1.0,3/7/2012,"Wow, I thought all the bad reviews were just a coincedence....this is Applebee's after all...you usually know what you are getting. But I have to agree with everyone, the service sucked.  The hostess seemed to be on something.  The waitress took the order and I never saw her again.  The food runner asked if I wanted another drink, and never saw her again The food, however, was typical Applebee's.  Stay away from this one"
Tony M.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,23,4,1.0,2/22/2014,"Let me just say one thing:  DON'T EVEN BOTHER SPENDING YOUR MONEY IN THIS S***HOLE. The reasons are as follow: 1. They don't take reservations but they take call in. To the corporate office of this chain, what does that mean??? 2. The manager "" Alex "" that took my call said the wait is 40 min. I went at the place at 8:15pm and got seated at 9:25 pm. To the corporate office of this chain is that 40 min? 3. The hostess "" Sarai"" says to me if you don't want to wait you can leave. To the corporate office of this chain, is that costumer service? 4. After I got seated the manager ""Alex"" never came back to check on the table if everything was OK.  To the corporate office of this S***HOLE IS THIS COSTUMER SERVICE. Being rude and careless tells me only one thing.  This establishment has no clue about costumer service. Maybe cause they are close to the Roosevelt field mall so they don't care if they costumers return or not. To anybody that reads this review: DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE.  GO SOMEWHERE ELSE"
Jenice C.,"Westbury, NY",15,19,5,5.0,6/6/2014,"I've been to a lot of Applebee's, but this one is really great in particular. Great service and great food! Not too long of a wait. Watched NBA finals here and found it easy to watch since multiple tv screens and not too noisy."
Rebecca G.,"Glen Cove, NY",705,170,33,3.0,12/27/2014,"had two for twenty and a kids meal. the service was slow, hubby had steak it was ok and i had the ribs spicy were ok not very saucy."
Sunny T.,"Westbury, NY",0,1,,1.0,8/22/2015,Manager Ryan don't even know menu . Bartender splitting into drinks and pouring trash into drinks. I'm going to lawsuite in this branch.  Food is okay. Costumer service is shot.
Sheena K.,"ARVERNE, NY",4,14,,4.0,8/17/2014,"I have dine at different applebees for lunch meetings or when I'm on a buget and believe me when i say, not all Applebee's are great.. But my family and I came here after a horrible encounter at another restaurant so we ended up here instead. Absolutely no complaints. The services was fast, the waiter was polite, the prices was absolutely cheap, the food was good and the bathrooms were clean. I will dine here again."
Beth L.,"Bellmore, NY",278,556,475,3.0,10/15/2013,"cheap and good and great company, was in and out in under an hour and we split crispy green beans, steak quesadilla towers, pretzels, etc it was  all good but obv frozen before,,,,"
Thomas P.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",8,98,4,3.0,5/29/2013,I've never been an Applebee's fan. They did nothing wrong and nothing outstanding. Normal chain food. My club sandwich was good except for the BBQ sauce on it. An odd choice! But it tasted fine. The chili nachos were pretty good.
Nikk N.,"SOUTH RICHMOND HILL, NY",0,14,,1.0,3/6/2016,"Now left this establishment with a very poor first impression based on the service I received from a waitress by the name Rosalyn. Ordered an angry orchard only to be given another reg beer and after tasting it,I immediately knew it was the wrong one and notified the waitress that there had been a mistake. Her response, ""I keyed in angry orchard so that has to be the right one"" and then she walked away. I then took another sip to make sure I was not wrong, got up and walked to the bar myself and spoke to the bartender that immediately knew just by looking at my drink that I was given the wrong one; she then poured me a new one. Walked back to my table and waited for my food to arrive. Rosalyn came by once to ask if everything was ok,I then notified her that it was in fact the wrong drink I had been given in which she responded ""ok""and then was never seen again for the duration of our meal. Another waitress brought out our food. Rosalyn never came back to check if my family needed anything else such as refills or dessert. We payed, and then spoke to the manager which handled the situation very professionally and offered some extras which we kindly declined."
Aaron Z.,"East Meadow, NY",32,65,30,5.0,8/31/2013,"A good old shoutout to management of this restaurant for allowing my Boy Scouts troop to have our fundraiser here. The chefs were in the kitchen putting out food for us with no problems, and the owner (or manager?) was busy helping out the scouts to serve their families. A fine staff!"
K G.,"Astoria, NY",191,39,1,2.0,5/2/2012,"Waited 10 minutes at the host stand when the restaurant was more than half empty.  When we were finally seated we had to wait again for the waiter to notice us, and when he did he tried to get someone else to take the table so we had to wait again!!!  The food was the same as always, but again we had to wait a while...and then we had to wait for the check, and to get my credit card back after paying.  I did not see a manager on the floor or I would have asked what the hold up was.  Keep in mind this was on a Wednesday night around 10pm!!"
Ilona G.,"Bellerose, NY",51,5,1,1.0,12/18/2011,"I usually go to the Applebees in New Hyde Park which we love but as we were in the Westbury area we decided to go here! BIG mistake. Our server had one arm and hand in a brace and appeared to be on something! In fact she kept telling everyone that she was ""out of it"".  She messed up everyone's orders, and kept forgetting what they ordered. The couple at the next table were still waiting for dinner when she asked them if they wanted dessert. When we finally got our check, she again lost the bill and couldn't find our credit card. When I told her I wanted the manager she offered me $10 of her tip money as a bribe!!!! Never again!!!"
Mary H.,"New York, NY",144,28,15,2.0,11/15/2012,Service was so bad. I asked the waiter for Mayo by the time the mayo came i was done with my dinner.
Leslie I.,"Long Beach, NY",0,4,,1.0,6/28/2014,"My recent experience on 6/28/2014 with my family was the worst experience I ever had.  My server Dominique under the supervision of Dominic the manager was surely unforgettable. Staff untrained, other customers complaining.  It began with not Utensils, no plates for appetizers, wrong food order, while others at my party was eating one did not even receive food. Although the manager came to our table because it was clear that we were unhappy. The service was still sub-par and then the waitress Dominique had the gall to come to see if we paid the check when it was given to her manager. I guess she was accustomed  of people running out on her for her bad performance.  More training is needed from the hostesses to the servers. It is a shame that when people are trying to enjoy their Pre-4th of July experience that they have to be subjected to unprofessional people."
Baby S.,"Oceanside, NY",0,598,,4.0,4/11/2013,"You must think that I am insane, writing a 4 star review for the Applebee's, but we have received such an amazing service from the waiter named Chris that I had to write the review.  With so many options in Long Island, 3 hungry kids screaming for Applebee's took precedence, so here we were, not expecting much, prepared to dread the experience, and then Chris made our evening.  He was very friendly, everything was served promptly, the plates were taken away right after we finished what was on them, the drinks were refilled for the kids gazillion times, overall, a very nice, relaxing meal.  We left him a nice top and kids were so impressed with the service, they added a couple of bucks from their allowance :-).  I guess in the world of the chain restaurants where the food is pretty standard, it's the service that makes all the difference."
Mr. D.,"Astoria, NY",159,9,,2.0,1/31/2011,"Went here for dinner this evening only cause my wife had a gift card.  Waiter was just in deep space, simply overwelmed!  I usually tip 25% on good service and 30% on great service.....he got 15% and only cause he had my sons name...lol.  really!  Food was exactly what you expect from an applebees....Ahh.  not really a fan."
Seta M.,"Hempstead, NY",11,59,16,1.0,12/19/2011,"Saturday night I decided to go to Applebee's for a late meal. We haven't been here in months because we are vegetarians and they have a sampler platter that has chicken on it. We ask that they substitute onion rings for the chicken and that's it. We are told by waiter after waiter that we can't do this after we had already spoken to the manager, explained our position that we are asking for a substitution that will save the company money yet achieive our dietary objective, and then got it cleared from the manager. (supposedly for all future visits). Tonight was no different. The waitress gave us the stock lines usually given and went back to check if this was ok and again got it approved. Then we placed a drink order. She returned with our drinks and then we didn't see her for a good while. When she finally returned, she took our order for dinner.   One of the staff members brought our our appetizer and we asked the waitress that brought the appetizers if we could have another drink (the drink ordered did not match what we asked for). My wife saw her tell our original waitress about our drink order and walk away. A good long time later (we had finished our meal), we finally got a drink from our original waitress which was AGAIN WRONG! It seems the staff is not well managed at this Applebee's. We overheard (and it wasn't hard) very inappropriate conversations being had by employees with customers right there. They were so focused on their conversations that service was not being given. We made a mistake and plan not to make this mistake again. We usually give a good tip to our server, however this young lady was so inattentive that we decided to leave $1.00 and a note regarding her terrible service. I think this will be my last visit to Applebee's. I will know for sure after I write a letter to the Corporate Office. Avoid this one folks."
Dominic L.,"Westbury, NY",14,86,271,3.0,11/17/2013,"food is finally getting better.  but service has to be dramatically improved.  i really hate it, when the servers comes to wait on you in the beginning and they somehow never see them again!"
Dev R.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,10,,3.0,7/28/2012,"Your typical applebees. Not a bad place and had a few waiters that were terrible over the years, but the managers always made up for it. Half apps gimmick aren't bad either. Reliable...after shopping or a drive out to the beach in LI. Nothing crazier than that."
