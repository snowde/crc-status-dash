Christopher C.,"Naugatuck, CT",6,70,,2.0,4/2/2012,"This absolutely represents my experience at every Applebees I have ever dined in. Bad food, small portions, high prices, bad service, and wrong orders or orders not arrived at all. Not sure why anybody is a fan of Applebees. This particular one was better than the others, earning it 2 stars instead of 1.... which by Applebees standards is like a 5 star rating lol"
John S.,"Middle Village, NY",14,124,18,2.0,1/30/2010,"To me Applebees everywhere are the same, and that is part of the reason for the 2 star rating. I ordered the Bacon Firepit burger or something like that the name escapes me but anyway the burger wasn't bad but I just never end up feeling satisfied with any burger from applebees, mainly because they feel the need to pile on everything they can on the burger making it more difficult to enjoy. I had also tried these wonton taco things, not good at all. I just don't know what it was but they were not good. The appetizer sampler was fine no complaints. Service was good, polite waitress but other than that I will try my hardest to avoid applebees."
