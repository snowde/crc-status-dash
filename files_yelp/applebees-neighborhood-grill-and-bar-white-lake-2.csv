Jeremy R.,"Waterford, MI",64,209,245,4.0,10/6/2017,"We were bummed when we learned our local Waterford Applebee's closed. We hardly ever had good service there, but it  was so close to home.  We decided to give the Applebee's in White Lake a try and the service is like night and day compared to our old Applebee's. The server was very attentive and the food tasted excellent. The food still took awhile to come out, but nothing out of the ordinary from any other Applebee's I have been too."
Brigitte B.,"Brighton, MI",12,47,5,1.0,11/26/2017,"Let's start with,  this location is FILTHY!!!!!!!    From the pay kiosk on the table, to the salt and pepper grinders to worst of all, the menus.   GROSS!  Everything had either food or sticky crap on it.  My daughter ordered a steak salad med rare, no onions.  It came w onions.  Brought back and the steak was so overly well done, it was practically jerky.   I ordered the pick 3 apps,  boneless wings, siracha shrimp and steak quesadilla no onions.  Aside from the everything coming barely warm, the quesadillas had onions.    Sent them back and they came back hot and perfect,  yay!!!! Daughters tiki cocktail was good and my beer was good and cold.   Not a good experience and will never come back to this location.   Thank you to our server though,  she was very nice and tried hard to make everything better.   Applebees,  PLEASE do a better job cleaning."
Gary H.,"Howard City, MI",0,5,,1.0,1/10/2018,"Ordered a steak around 9pm on wed 1/10/18, got 2 sides,both were ice cold!!! I sat at bar was only 2 other patrons at bar! Bartender never checked on my so i ate my food!when she finally showed up she said ill let the cook know? Lol i truly am at a lose for words!!!other than ill be postiong my experince on social media"
Alexandra C.,"Waterford Township, MI",169,232,86,3.0,11/7/2017,"Our food was actually really good, the server was great but the time it took for our food was longer than normal. Our server was an older gentlemen, he was excellent, and the order came out correct. Just so...slow... even our appetizer took long. There were other guests who sat after us but their food came out before our appetizer did. Not a bad location, and that's really my only complaint- the wait from the kitchen."
Mike S.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",0,2,1,1.0,8/25/2017,"I had to ask the waitress over and over again to get us water, she wouldn't look us in the eye, one of the most unfriendly waitresses I've ever had. They proceeded to serve me a hamburger that was literally raw and to top it all off they tried to charge us for a video game on the tablet system that my children did not even touch. I definitely will not be coming to this location ever again!"
Cassandra R.,"Howard City, MI",0,10,2,4.0,8/7/2017,Come here often. Great deals when taking kids during the week. The new chicken breast topped with mozzarella sticks was really good! Service was great tonight as well. Only 4 stars because we've had some not so great food and service a couple times.
Leighton W.,"Waterford Township, MI",126,10,3,4.0,1/21/2017,"What can I say, its Applebee's. I had a gift card and stopped in expecting Applebee's and that is exactly what I got. Can't comment on the food that much as it's a preset menu and I doubt the chefs have much creative control over it. They had alcohol, which is an automatic 3 star in my book. Then the waitstaff was extremely accomodating, so there's the 4th star. Especially to my odd request to get a side of sweet potato fries in lieu of chicken on my pasta. So, if you're looking to eat some Applebee's, well, you can do that here."
Dissapointed S.,"White Lake charter Township, MI",0,4,,1.0,8/21/2017,"DISGUSTING !!!!! went there on a Sunday night (08/21/17 @ 9:00pm)they were not busy. App's took 25 min to come out / dinner took 1 hr to come out. Beside the wait the food presentation subpar. When the food did finally arrive to our table, the steak was NOT on a sizzling skillet (as the menu said) the grilled(burnt)mixed veggie were covered in a lemon sauce(??) which is NOT mentioned on the menu that your ""grilled veggies will be swimming n lemon sauce. And evey single person at out table had FILTHY, FOOD STILL STUCK ON PLATES from prev guests, not only could you feel it you could VISABLE SEE IT !!! ON every dinner plate !! Silverware was filthy. When our server notified the ""manager"" we were  offered to go boxes and offered clean plates.  APPLEBEES you have made the Never Go Here Again List !!!! ( bad news travels fast!!)"
K. N.,"Detroit, MI",79,27,1,3.0,7/22/2017,The service is always great but I have been disappointed with the food quality lately. My veggies and potatoes keep coming out cold and my steak not rare as requested.
Michael H.,"White Lake Township, MI",77,38,64,5.0,7/18/2016,"More than anything,  I like the company that owns this particular Restaurant as well as many in Michigan.  They are veteran friendly and also yelp friendly.  The management seems to be very good,  I have no complaints on how the Restaurant is ran.  Applebee's ahs become our favorite place to eat in White Lake. The food quality has significantly improved over the last year. We have had very few instances of food that was less than what we would expect from a great establishment.  I have had some awesome wait staff at times,  also had some awful wait staff.  The last visit,  we waited for about 15 minutes to get our server.  She claimed she had no idea we were her table.  Our food and drinks were delivered by different people.  We only saw her when the check was ready.  However,  this isn't the normal experience. We have noticed that the staff have been very attentive with their customers. While the wait to get seated can be long at peak times, they now have the staff to get orders served quickly and still pay attention to each customer."
Joe W.,"Waterford Township, MI",0,4,,2.0,2/16/2017,"I've been a regular client at the Whit Lk Applebee's for a number of years. Usually the service and food are excellent.  But,sad to say that changed on our recent visit.  The service was rather poor and the food was awful. My server forgot what we had even ordered. I hope the manager will make some drastic changes and fast."
Shane M.,"Royal Oak, MI",3,45,33,5.0,5/12/2016,"Last night (Wednesday may 11th) me, my fiancé and my daughter all decided to come up to Applebee's to check out this locations food and atmosphere. I could not believe that a restaurant like this has such great service and food. We got some drink and they were brought to us very quickly with our appetizer (spinach artichoke dip) which was a little too salty for my fiancé but I demolished it. Our waitress Alisha was great. She was helpful, fast, and very friendly to my daughter. We ordered the pick 2 for $20. We both got side salads which were bigger than most places I've been and not skimpy on the bacon, the perfect amount of ranch, and the right balance between lettuce and cheese. When we were done with our salads the food we ordered came right away and was still very hot like it JUST came off the stove top. My fiancé got the 3 cheese cavatappi and I got the bourbon street chicken and shrimp. WOW! Is the words that come to mind. My plate came on a fiery hot cast iron skillet loaded with shrimp atop of the grilled chicken. Needless to say it was amazing. Looked exactly like or better than the picture. I was extremely satisfied with my order. Now here's the best part (for me at least) THE WAITRESS NEVER ASKED ME HOW MY FOOD WAS! And to ne that is the best service ever. I gate it when people come to the table asking you how the food is whilst I'm taking my first bite. Like ""idk I haven't tasted it yet"" lol 5 for sure! I can't wait to come back to this location again and hopefully  (fingers crossed) get Alisha as our waitress. I'd recommend this Applebee's to everyone."
Nicole H.,"White Lake, MI",0,15,,1.0,9/16/2016,Again i tried eating here. Give it another chance but it didnt work out well. Nothing taste fresh and other applebees i have been to are great so i dont know what goes on the location but if you want applebees go to a different one.
Angela W.,"Waterford Township, MI",12,31,,2.0,9/12/2016,All the food at Applebee's is tooooo salty and the salsa is not at all hot.   The margaritas are the only thing good there
Jason D.,"Grand Rapids, MI",49,59,40,5.0,2/28/2016,"First off, why are you reading a review for a chain restaurant? You kinda know what to expect I'm writing this review because of the customer service at this Applebee's. The bartender and bar back that were working the night I went were super awesome, they deserved a wonderful tip and I gave them one. They were slammed with a full restaurant and a full bar, yet still were very calm and very attentive to each person at the bar.  If you want a good time, go to the bar at this Applebee's on a Saturday evening!"
Ben H.,"Independence Township, MI",154,18,13,4.0,9/23/2016,"It's Applebee's- some people don't like their stuff. Personally- love their food, selection, and service. I eat here often- and never have a bad experience. The Beer Batter Pretzels are INCREDIBLE and the American Standard burger is a great take on the classic burger. Even when I come with large parties- they accommodate us well!"
Natalie B.,"Waterford Township, MI",13,61,80,3.0,4/14/2016,"I haven't been here in awhile they have a new menu.  I had the whiskey chicken.  Wasn't impressed at all.  I wouldn't get it again.  It was on the dry side with a ton of sautéed onions on top.  The mashed potatoes were ok.  For an appetizer, I got the  Sriracha Shrimp which was pretty good.  I also tried the brisket enchiladas and that was much better than the whiskey chicken.  Our server was fantastic."
Kaitlyn B.,"Highland Charter Township, MI",40,2,,4.0,10/14/2016,Had a lovely waitress!!! Was super timely and great with the fact that my daughter spilled her drink.
Dennis B.,"Waterford Township, MI",0,5,1,5.0,4/9/2016,Excellent 2 for  $20 meal. Tacos and chicken /shrimp dish. Served hot and tasty. More quantity than I expected.
Stephen P.,"Waterford Township, MI",62,24,17,5.0,1/3/2016,"I come here nearly once a week and I am never disappointed. Their menu is full of great food for lunch and dinner. For lunch they have a great menu consisting of pairing a classic with a classic, a classic with a signature, or two signatures, all for under $10. For dinner I believe everyone knows about the 2 for $20 and the 2 for $25 menu. The mozzarella sticks are amazing and the ""side salads"" are more like full portions and taste great. All in all the food is great and I would recommend to anyone."
John F.,"White Lake, MI",3,26,284,4.0,2/20/2015,"Great service and good ""spirit"" from the staff. Fantastic! Good Applebee's food served by a great White Lake team. Very busy at night because of their great food and service I'm sure."
B M.,"White Lake, MI",0,1,,1.0,7/30/2016,Inept staff got order wrong for the second visit in a row and arrogant and uninterested management. They're very aware that pickings are slim in white lake and they don't have to deliver much on customer service or quality to keep a customer base. Car pick up to go is as bad or worse - last time (and I do mean last!) they kept me waiting 35 minutes (no lie) past my pick up time. Would have left but was already paid for via the web ordering website. Won't ever go back - three strikes is generous if you ask me!
Konstantin P.,"Waterford Township, MI",10,18,12,5.0,10/22/2015,We often come here and enjoy good food and drinks. Today was also a good experience. We tried the new burger and sandwich on the menu. The staff was professional and accomadating. It was nice to see new items on the menu and good choices of drinks.
James Z.,"White Lake, MI",56,21,,5.0,8/3/2016,$3 Brutus and 1/2 price apps after 9.  Sold!    Bar staff is friendly and welcoming.   Definitely a well run Applebees from my experiences there.
Kendall P.,"Milford, MI",0,5,6,4.0,8/23/2015,Good service but when I order my burger medium it was medium well!!! But the rest was really good!!!
Kim S.,"Stanwood, MI",0,6,,1.0,10/21/2016,"We keep trying, but no luck! When is this restaurant going to get it together? I used to go to this restaurant at least three times a week, and the service was professional and great! Wow, what a change over the past six months. We keep trying, but are always disappointed by the lack of service and unprofessional staff. Walked in, finally was seated and waited 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge and know that we were there. The employees were more interested in talking amongst each other then concerned about customers! The employees, when not working the other night were sitting up at the bar sipping cocktails out of the kiddie cups. The employees that were working were talking to the off duty employees at the bar drinking. And when we cashed out, our waitress was eating chips from the spinach dip at the bar with the off duty employees! The new manager obviously oblivious to what was going on as she was having a personal conversation almost the entire time we were there with another female employee! Wow, disappointed as how bad they have let there service slip!"
Henry S.,"White Lake Township, MI",36,15,,4.0,8/18/2015,"Always reliable.  Consistent quality, service, speed.  Military Mondays appreciated."
Yvonne M.,"White Lake Township, MI",43,13,23,5.0,3/13/2014,They are so kind and up beat! Very prompt and i absolutely love the managers friendliness! Especially with how wonderful they are when i bring lot of coupons haha
Brian B.,"Waterford Township, MI",86,19,,5.0,5/2/2015,I stopped into this Applebees today and the service was top notch.  Nicki waited on me and she did an excellent job but everyone was very attentive.  If you're shopping in the area this is an excellent place to eat and grab a break at.
Foo D.,"Commerce charter Township, MI",0,8,,2.0,6/19/2015,"Predictabley average.  When you want an average meal, go here.  The drinks are awfully sweet, formulated by corporate, but you can get by asking for half the normal sugar or sour mix."
Marwan H.,"White Lake, MI",0,18,,5.0,10/13/2015,"awesome service, awesome food, didn't want to get that much food but we definitely got lucky, it was a college night game but it was very good, fast, lots of leftovers and the price was right"
Stephen S.,"Township of Dundee, Township of Dundee, IL",4,29,2,2.0,8/25/2012,"This Applebee's has been hit and miss.  The sirloin is usually very good, but then there is the occasional hair in the potatoes or slow service. I assume it's a management problem."
Jessica L.,"Hartland, MI",0,7,,5.0,9/24/2011,I absolutely love this restaurant they have great food and prices. Entertainment some nights and the staff is always so friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend!
Kristopher S.,"Waterford Township, MI",67,51,,3.0,10/14/2012,"Applebee's is becoming one of my favorite places to hit up after 9 PM due to their half off appetizers.  An order of Boneless Wings or a Quesadilla for 4-5 bucks!  Can't beat it!  Their wings are pretty good, and their quesadilla is phenomenal!  That being said, while I am a fan of their appetizers, I am not a huge fan of their entrees.  Their ribs are terrible and dry, their steak was terrible as well (felt like ground beef...I love a tender steak, but it was disgusting!).  They have a great Alfredo sauce, but their cooks don't know how to cook noodles (they are extremely overdone, and I am very picky on needing my noodles ""Al Dente"").  Their ""Chicken Fajita Roll Up"" however is excellent.  So - why do I give three stars?  As there are some things (like Quesadilla's) that Applebee's does very well.  And I am thrilled that I can get their awesome Quesadilla's for just 4 or 5 dollars any night after 9 PM.  That being said, I'd stay away from the majority of their menu...lol"
