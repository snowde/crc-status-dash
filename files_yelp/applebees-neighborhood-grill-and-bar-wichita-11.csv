Edward C.,"Tampa, FL",0,3,,3.0,1/29/2016,"The food was delivered timely enough, the staff friendly. You know what you're getting when you come here. Nothing great and the occasional disappointment.   Dont attempt the brisket enchilada. What a waste. Poor flavor, drowned in sauces and the rice was as a dry as salt.    Thai shrimp salad was pleasant though."
Autumn S.,"Maize, KS",0,3,,1.0,12/1/2017,"My husband and I went to this location for supper because of the $1 Long Island promotion they are running. I don't currently have a DL but I do have a passport. I have used this as a form of ID for the past 2 years and never had a problem anywhere. The manager told me she could not serve me without a driver's license. A passport is the most secure form of identification and being denied service was ridiculous. We will not be giving business to this location in the future. I will also mention, the same location has accepted my passport several times in the past. The service has always been lacking quality."
Jim B.,"Bentley, KS",1,5,8,5.0,6/28/2016,It was better than ever tonight. Excellent meal for the wife and I! Got that bourbon street seasoning figured out!!!
Dana W.,"Wichita, KS",0,5,1,1.0,12/26/2016,"Horrible horrible service. Only went there because we had a gift card. There was a family that came in with us. They ate their entire meal, paid and left before we got our food. Apps came out with the food. Apps were hot but my steak and sides were cold.  They took it off our ticket but didn't offer to remake it for us. Will not be back. Food isnt even that good for that kind of headache"
Dan D.,"Wichita, KS",7,25,14,1.0,6/4/2016,"A steak that was ordered medium was burned beyond well done, the service was pitiful, and a manager was apathetic. I remember now why we quit coming to Applebee's."
Cory C.,"San Diego, CA",8,3,,4.0,11/7/2015,"This is a solid Applebees, they nearly always get it right after MANY times eating here over the years.  Steaks have been good, not awesome, but good, not expensive, food delivered in good time, good service.        It's usually pretty busy during lunch and dinner so get there early.  There is a good reason it's usually busy!  Just a nice place to eat.       Also, often when there is a wait for seating, we just passed the wait and sat at the bar (no wait there if seats are open) just use the bar.  We have ALWAYS found the staff friendly, and even at times entertaining!         They have also started using the small screens at the table to play a game, order dessert, or pay at the table.  Pretty nice to not have to wait to pay."
Renée R.,"Wichita, KS",6,68,16,1.0,10/10/2015,Gross microwave food! Just no don't waste your money. My kids favorite thing here is the apple sauce that comes prepackaged! Enough said.
Trina W.,"Wichita, KS",7,17,51,2.0,12/17/2013,"Although the night manager is great; the waiters and waitresses could use work. After the first time forgetting our soup on a call in order, they forget it again when we drove back to pick it up. The third time we finally received our soup, at least it was tasty. If we had not ordered more items the second time possibly we would have received our soup. The manager was gracious and polite."
Lisa H.,"Wichita, KS",126,4,,1.0,4/28/2015,"I've dined here multiple times, each time giving them a chance. My first visit I waited on my beer for nearly 20 minutes, I watched it get warm at the bar. We received dirty plates for our appetizers, my order was wrong. We also heard our server arguing with profanity in the kitchen. Second time I was there I waited a long time for my beer AND food. My sister and I ordered the same thing and she had visibly a lot more fries than me. Our server stopped by 2 times the whole time. I ordered another beer and it was forgotten. NO drink refills my nephew was complaining he was thirst. JUST TERRIBLE!!! I will no longer be eating at this location! The service has been horrible and seems to get worse each time. Very disappointed!! Please retrain your servers"
