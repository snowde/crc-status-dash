Raven A.,"Cabins, WV",9,2,,4.0,12/22/2017,"This Applebee's is quite nice.  It has a good atmosphere and it does indeed feel inviting.  I came in with my mother, Aunt and, cousin.  I had the topped steak and potatoes deal, starting at $12.99,  which is a very great deal for what you receive.   The food tasted amazing! I was quite satisfied.  We also ate a blondie and it was to die for!  The service was decent and we all had a great time."
Joshua H.,"Winchester, VA",0,38,,1.0,12/23/2017,"The food was mediocre to average. The atmosphere was weird, as some of the staff were talking, loudly, about random stuff. I don't care if you have conversations about ""the fucking traffic,"" but maybe not next to me.  The busser/server with the scraggly chinstrap facial hair, and the fake diamond studs, was a douchebag. I ordered a drink and he said, ""Drink for the alcoholic."" You lanky, skinny turd. Is it too much to order one drink to have with my shit appetizers? He said not take it personal because he does this to all of his tables. I have two problems with that: 1. It's rude and not funny, 2. His tables probably don't like to be harassed while at Applebee's.  Management, fire that Xanax popping moron. Until/if they do that, go to Bojangles or IHOP (both within 100 feet). Edit: Oh yeah, the dressing to lettuce ratio shouldn't be 50/50. I'll order soup if I want a puddle of something."
Chelsea K.,"Winchester, VA",0,2,,1.0,11/11/2017,"Usually the service is adequate so there's nothing terribly bad or good to say, but this was a different experience. Food was it's usual goodness that you would expect at any Applebee's but service here is less than okay. We were ignored and were patient and certainly not some fools begging for the manager. Just wanted to eat and leave."
Chris M.,"Winchester, VA",0,11,1,5.0,2/11/2017,Went for my daughter's birthday. 8 of us on a Wednesday evening. Food was great. Service was stellar. Be sure to ask to be seated in Trevor's station. The staff did a very enthusiastic birthday song for my daughter. She loved it!
James S.,"Rochester, NY",7,5,,1.0,5/14/2016,"Today was one of those days where finding a good place to eat seemed like too much work and I'll just settle for a chain restaurant for an average meal,  well I was wrong. The service was good, my waitress checked on me often and was prompt with everything I asked for,  however the food and the beer was just terrible,  the Blue Moon I ordered did not come with an orange slice as it should have and had a stale taste to it that I didn't finish it,  the meal was dry and lacked flavor that the same entree has had at other locations. Good thing is I am traveling and chances are slim I'll ever have to eat at this location again.  They have a lot to be desired and a lot of work to do before they are on par with other Applebee's which are mediocre at best."
Murad A.,"Charlotte, NC",37,19,36,1.0,5/4/2016,"This place is terrible I'm from charlotte, nc just passing threw town and come to Walmart and stopped to eat. Chicken is burned. Rice is cold. Appetizer is ok ahhh..server is trying hard but the kitchen is below sorry...I hate to give such a negative comment I totally agree with others I should of read this before earring I'm still hungry :("
Gayle G.,"Harpers Ferry, WV",0,8,,1.0,9/25/2017,I have been to many Applebee's but this by far was the worst experience I have ever had the manager it lack there of was two busy playing with the girls at the bar instead of knowing what was going on in the restaurant. Jen our server needs to find a new occupation she had no clue how to be s server. We asked for silverware they brought out silverware and napkins and throw them on the table upon looking at the utensils we discovered that they where filthy we returned them to the serving tables d was told by the manager that they had no hot water and that is why the silverware looked the way it did . First off they should have immediately fixed the hot water or closed the restaurant because you have to have that or the health department closes you down . Secondly what manager tells someone they have no hot water. The food was horrible as well why ask if you want pink in your burger because it had none. If the health department does not shut this place down the owners should
Mark D.,"Gore, VA",1,12,3,1.0,1/14/2016,"Got some to-go after an awful experience over the summer. Figured I'd give them a second chance.  This place is literally the worst place to eat in Winchester. McDonald's down the street has better cooked food. I ordered a burger; hard to mess up, right? Wrong. They managed to burn the HELL out of this thing. The fries? Apparently when you order to-go you get what amounts to a Happy Meal size.  Avoid this place like the plague. It seems corporate couldn't care any less about what amounts to years of bad reviews and experiences. Move along and pick a better place to eat."
Kilo B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,59,8,5.0,7/22/2016,"Excellent for us! Waiter was great, food was cooked perfect and hot. Beer was cold off the tap."
Matt C.,"Stephens City, VA",0,2,,1.0,11/19/2016,"This is a 'weird one;' we'll never return to this franchise location: The cook came to our table after we'd ordered to apologize for his overcooking of a cut of meat, saying he had put another slice on the grill.  Our wait would be another five minutes - unless my friend would like the overcooked cut. This was said without any hint of sarcasm, but instead, with extreme frustration directed, maybe accidentally, at our table. The cook asked the other guys at our table if we wanted to wait, or to be served right then. We each told him that it wasn't at all any problem, that it was fine, and that we'd wait five minutes to all eat together. We reassured the cook, retaining our manners, telling him again and again that it was okay. All paying separately, over a dozen of us, casually seated at different tables, we later agreed that this fellow had some on-the-job stress issues. Something going on, something 'not right.' He wore no culinary apparel, but instead a server's uniform complete with a server's name tag pinned on a server's uniform shirt. Clearly a cook, though, with food residue all over his uniform, and speaking of how -he- had over-cooked the food. One man cannot run a large kitchen alone, or fix it for that matter. When the food came out, the cut was inedible. The re-cooked cut, yes, couldn't be easily split with a steak knife. I felt bad for my friend who, like myself, hadn't had a meal all day. We had to eat. My dish had cold fillings, a possibly stretched dairy product, was dried-out, had likely 'aged' on a warming rack for most of the afternoon. The angry head-chef-in-server's-clothes visited our table again, and asked us if the food was good. We all replied, ""It's fine,"" avoiding potential conflict or discussion, wanting to leave. He then proclaimed, ""It looks like you all hate it!"" and stormed off. He was right. My money is gone. I could have paid a grease pit $1.19 for burger instead. I feel robbed of the money I paid. I'm paying further at this late hour with a very upset stomach. I don't feel robbed of the tip I left. The remaining fact is that our server is the only reason any of us paid our separate bills. She was a saint, considering the circumstances. She had our drinks filled and refilled; she was incredibly calm and professional, even sweet, despite the kitchen being in obvious disarray, and knowing so without directly stating such. I found it admirable that she was so calm. I would have quit on the spot. I didn't get her name, but I hope she finds a restaurant better fitting her skill."
Tony B.,"BERKELEY SPGS, WV",45,29,6,1.0,4/23/2015,"While I would love to say that every so often you'd just find that other reviews of a place are off point, in the case of this particular Applebee's? .. Everyone's right on point. Service at this particular Applebee's is appalling at best -- and that goes for the lackluster support or helpfulness of management. Let's rewind.  Some of my friends and family all showed at this Applebees's on a Sunday afternoon.  There was a decent amount of people in there, but ultimately, it was rather slow.  We ordered appetizers, drinks, and a ""Cheesy Bread Pizza"" kid's meal for my daughter. Appetizers came out, and were actually pretty good .. .. .. 15 minutes later our drinks (mind you, just fountain drinks and tea -- no alcohol) came out.  At this time we ordered our food .. simple process - but we asked for a few things (for instance, no mayo on my wife's club sandwich, bar-b-que fries instead of regular fries with my meal, etc.). Roughly 10 minutes later, my daughter's pizza came out, sans cheese... eh .. it was essentially a greasy piece of bread, with approximately 2 cups (yes, cups) of sauce on it, and some sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top.  Hmmm.. That doesn't seem to be too cheesy! Okay, we let it slide .. it happens.  Then the meals come out (mind you, we've been finished with our appetizers now for over 20 minutes -- but all of the appetizer plates, and the empty appetizer platter stayed on the cramped table, even *after* our food came out, and was never removed for the entirety of service) -- or, at least a similar meal option of what we ordered. First? .. My wife's sandwich was LOADED (again, they seem to use ""cups"" of ingredients) with mayo.  My sandwich (which was supposed to be turkey and ham), had... neither .. just bread, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and more mayo.... Somehow they even managed to screw up the fries.   I'd say it was just my side of the table, but everyone has screwed up orders.  We asked for a manager, but no one ever came (even though a man in a button down shirt stared at us from afar). Needless to say, we left very disappointed. To top it off, I went and filed a complaint to Applebees, and received a call from the store manager........... who essentially told me I lied about the entire process, and that there was ""NO WAY"" that any of this could happen -- yet provided me 3 free meals to give them another chance........ Oxymoron much? Needless to say, we gave them two of the three additional chances to make service beautiful again, but they failed miserably each and every time.  Clearly, we're not the only ones who have issue with this place, but for some unknown reason, people keep coming in and keeping this franchise open..... *sigh*"
Rich S.,"Leesburg, VA",0,4,1,4.0,8/20/2016,Stacy our server she was awesome she kept check on us making sure everything as always good food wonderful
Matt D.,"Port Matilda, PA",3,1,,2.0,1/2/2015,We ate here once while passing through town. Our waters contained floating particles and the silverware was dirty.  Management did give us bottled water as a replacement and new silverware. Food was ok.
K G.,"Winchester, VA",1,23,,1.0,5/12/2016,"Horrible menu change - they took the Riblets off the menu.  The 2 for $20.00 meals were ALL chicken or an upcharge for a steak dish.  Silverware dirty, iced tea cloudy, waitstaff rude.  I won't be going back there."
Crissi P.,"Winchester, VA",40,1,,1.0,8/7/2015,"Horrible service!  We ordered food, and after 30 minutes saw it delivered to the wrong table.  After the waiter took it back to the kitchen to warm the plates, it was brought back to our table.  The portion sizes were tiny and the salmon was rubbery and crunchy at the edges.  The steamed vegetables were flavorless and cold.  I will not return. Our drinks were never refilled.  In total it took about 45 minutes to an hour to get our food, we would have sent it back had we not have been starving by the time we got our plates."
Nathan O.,"Charles Town, WV",0,16,1,1.0,1/6/2016,"This place is terrible, even for an Applebee's! If you ignore the reviews, be sure to sit in the bar so you have quick access to sufficient amounts of alcohol to help convince yourself that it's not as bad as your tongue is telling you. My children's Mac n Cheese was better that my chicken and mashed potatoes. Don't waste your time and money at this awful Applebee's. O and it took an incredible amount of time for one entrée and a kids meal."
Julie S.,"Stephens City, VA",0,1,,1.0,7/9/2016,"went to the business on july7, 2016, and i can say that the service i rec was the worst ever....the waitress (maeve) took our order for or drinks and appetizers .. came back a few minutes later for our order... another customer came in a few minutes after myself, and was at the table next to ours ... our appetizers came, and was eaten..drinks were drank..the neighboring table rec their food, which was wrong, but they rec their food .. maeve came to the table and apologized for the wait, and said that she would check the status of our order .. other customers came in...maeve came back again, to refill our drinks, then asked if we had ordered ?!?!?!?!?! i replied yes, we ordered, you came over to apologize for the wait ....there were nurses that came in for lunch, they ordered a salad, and eventually, when it came, had to req that it be boxed up, because they had to leave and could not wait any longer .. mind you i still have not rec my food !!!!!! at this point i have maeve come to the table, and req the rec for my appetizers and drinks, that i was leaving..other people that have come in after myself, have already rec their food and are eating, and some are already leaving, and i have yet to get my food .....  even though she attempted to apologize, and comp the meal ... i will not be returning to that applebees....."
Tiffany D.,"Gore, VA",3,29,6,1.0,7/9/2015,"Where do I start? Between the snooty hostess who can't hold the door open for a pregnant lady on crutches, maybe I'm feeling some sort of entitlement or maybe that's just customer service? I'm going to tack on customer service because I've been in the restaurant industry long enough to know... That's the right thing to do. Not to mention, when I turn down her booth offer for a party of 8 because I couldn't bend my leg, she gets even more pissy, I'm guessing because she actually has to move and put some tables together and that was the last thing she looked like she wanted to do. Or should I start with the unenthusiastic waitress who just didn't want to be there, or just didn't want to serve us? Empty drink glasses for more than 10 minutes, no check backs, no customer service. Awful. Though I am pregnant, I have thrown up twice during my pregnancy, I had a Caesar side salad that was mushy and felt like it was sitting in a hot lamp for most of its time or the dressing was plainly warm and not food safe, your guess is as good as mine after I had to crutch to the bathroom to throw up from it a few minutes after eating HALF of it. The waitress assumed we left, though the other part of the party was there (my husband was in the bathroom with me making sure I was being taken care of) so she kept the change of our ticket, so be it .70 cents was probably all she was worth anyways, that's putting it nicely, did she not have the decency to just ask? It's not like this place was busy on a Wednesday at 4pm, I think we were her only table, I didn't pay much attention but I believe I would've went above and beyond for my party of 8, even more so for any table I had. My sister received wings drowned in bbq sauce,  that made her shy away from eating them. The pastas are literally probably thrown in the microwave and served on a plate along with dry chicken tenders, possibly bacon bits and a microwaveable bread stick.  Oh and the speciality fries? What a joke! This place lacks customer service and food quality entirely. Going by the other reviews, it's safe to safe you should avoid this place like the plague, there's a McDonald's right down the street you'd have a better dinner and won't get a side of food poison with your meal."
Stuart P.,"Winchester, VA",0,11,,1.0,11/6/2015,This place is a joke.Our waiter was focusing on his phone instead of our empty drinks.The tables were dirty.Employees should not be playing on their phones and leaving customers with empty drinks and you wonder why businesses fail.
Kaitlyn C.,"Winchester, VA",0,2,,1.0,9/16/2015,I was in there yesterday enjoying a meal which the food was good. But the glasses we got were dirty had food on the inside of them. That is unsanitary!
Patrick L.,"Martinsburg, WV",20,6,6,2.0,5/27/2012,"I like the food at the Applebee's chain. I find it to be a nice change a pace from the other family style change restaurants.  My issue with specific Applebee's is the service.  I have never been in this place where it did not take at least an hour and a half to get our meals.  The orders are placed very quickly and then it is nothing but sitting there, and sitting there, and sitting there, waiting.  It is not the servers fault, there is obviously an issue in the kitchen, because I have been there 4 times now, and it has happened with 4 different servers.  I would only go to this particular Applebee's if you have a long time available to eat."
Jill S.,"Cross Junction, VA",0,3,,1.0,11/7/2013,"The food was not good, hamburger was dry, wings overcooked. Has gone downhill. Probably won't go back."
