Len S.,"Windsor, CA",1,163,34,3.0,3/16/2017,"My wife & I had dinner at Applebee's Neighborhood Grill in Windsor on Tuesday March 7 - the 2nd day of Restaurant Week in Sonoma County and a great opportunity to try some of the many restaurants in the county.   We were a bit surprised to see a chain participating in restaurant week but we decided impulsively to try Applebee's Neighborhood Grill as it is quite casual and that fit our mood. Applebee's offered a fix prix fixe dinner for $19.    My wife opted for the: Starter - House or Small Caesar Salad Entrée - Double-Crunch Shrimp Dessert - Blue Ribbon Brownie   I ordered the: Starter - Tortilla Soup Entrée - Blazin' Texan Burger Dessert - Blue Ribbon Brownie   The Caesar salad was not that small. The Tortilla Soup had a nice tangy spicy taste.   My wife enjoyed the large number of shrimp she was served. I enjoyed by 'burger' which was pieces of BBQ brisket rather than the usual ground beef.   The shocker was the Blue Ribbon Brownie dessert (only dessert choice) we were each served a dinner plate covered by two ample pieces of brownie and two scoops of ice cream. We were both certain the waitress had made a mistake and doubled our dessert order, but we were wrong. We ate most of the vanilla ice cream and took the brownies home in a container that was packed full.   Considering the low $19 price and the quantity and quality of the food, this was a very good dinner choice.   The service was attentive but as often happens in chain restaurants, some of the nearby patrons consider such a restaurant an extension of their home and do not bother to moderate their, or especially their children's, behavior as appropriate for a public dinning establishment."
Sonja V.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,32,,1.0,8/22/2017,"Place still sucks. You can tell the waiter 3 times to make sure the burger is cooked well done and its still gonna come back hella pink. When you show him the burger he will say oh we cook them to 150 degrees so thats well done....ummmm no. When its glistening pink and is screaming mediummm... i dont want it. Baked potato is hard as a rock. Server doesnt bring extra napkins for bbq ribs, no refils on water and doesnt clear the pile of food filled plates that r pushed off to the side in disgust. When will windsor get a real resturant.  2 thumbs down for this place AGAIN."
Aaron B.,"Valley Ford, CA",4,73,35,2.0,7/27/2017,Updated Review::: 9-5-17  Since my last review of this Applebee's things have went downhill so I am forced to redo my review. First off it is always cold with the A/C on and the last four times the food is not always fresh or hot when the food should be hot and of course fresh. Last night our food was a mixed bag. My chicken was hot but my fries we're cold and stale. The chips/hamburger meat and  queso plate was cold and the chips we're half crunchy. We came late to dinner 8:00pm so we were hungry and did not want to send our food back for a reorder so we just ate what we were given. We gave this Applebee's several times to redeem itself and advised employees of the problems but things have not gotten better. So we will not be returning to this Applebee's. Too bad because the location is nice...
Mike S.,"Cloverdale, CA",0,11,1,1.0,1/3/2018,"I used the eat here at least once a week, but never again. Where do I start? Our waiter, Kendra, was rude. My medium whisky burger (well that how I ordered it anyway) came out over overcooked and dry, without the whiskey sauce. I tracked down Kendra and she just stared at me.  Another waitress with obvious customer service experience stepped in and told me she would  have the cooks remake it. It finally came out well after my family had finished their meals. Kendra was rude and suggested my taste buds had missed the sauce on the first excuse for a burger. The burger was again over cooked, dry, and tasted terrible. I took one bite and left. Never again.  This place has gone downhill."
Julie M.,"Fort Bragg, CA",1,25,,1.0,12/13/2017,"I was staying Monday night next door at the hotel, I decided to have dinner here because I was tired from being on the road.  It was disgusting !  I ordered a dinner salad to start I could not eat it, it tasted like it had been sitting out for days !  I ordered a burger thinking that would be safe,  Burger King would have been better and my fries were cold.  My server was asleep at the wheel and it was not busy. It is amazing this place is even in business."
Peggy F.,"Cary, IL",0,16,,1.0,12/8/2017,"Wish I could give them negative stars. By far the WORST service ever. It took 15 minutes after being seated for a server to show up. Took another 20-25 minutes after ordering to get drinks. 45 minutes after ordering we were informed they didn't have the 8 oz steak one of us ordered. An hour later, food had not arrived and the two small children in our group were crying because they were hungry. We asked for the manager 3 times, he never came to see us. I doubt there was even a manager onsite. We paid for our drinks and left. Found out on our way out the door, we were the 2nd group to walk out. And they were still waiting to speak to the nonexistent manager. No it was not very a busy night. We will NEVER come back."
Robert U.,"Pacifica, CA",1,78,,1.0,11/5/2017,"Who would have thought a chain in wine country would be so absolutely terrible. Service was ok but the food was atrocious. We had nachos, a burger, a chicken sandwich and a corn dog. All horrible. Stay away."
Annette S.,"Windsor, CA",18,3,13,5.0,3/25/2017,"Here for my 55th birthday with the hubby. Christina is our server, and as usual she is awesome as is the majority of the staff here. Lunch is gonna be the bomb!!!"
Leilani S.,"Honolulu, HI",113,80,452,1.0,7/3/2016,"Horrible. Disappointed. Hungry. Three words that capture our dinner at Applebee's. You figure it's a chain restaurant and you will get a decent meal. However, we had a severely overpriced meal for something that resembles food.  The server was nice and so was the hostess but that cannot begin to make up for the food. All of the food that we ordered was unappetizing. The steak was very dry and I wouldn't even call it steak. The butchers cut beef was also dry but probably the best choice anyone in our party had.  The reviews seem to be raving about the drinks but even that was subpar. We ordered a round of strawberry margaritas only to find out that it was a strawberry lime margarita (not what we asked for). Worse yet, it was more like a line margarita with a splash of strawberry for color.  Needless to say, there isn't much to say. We won't be coming back again."
Kwi V.,"Windsor, CA",12,36,,2.0,10/24/2016,"I ordered the French onion soup and Pub Burger. My daughter ordered the corn dog and apple dippers. French onion soup was good but didn't look anything like the picture of the French onion soup on the menu.  My daughter didn't care for the corn dog that much she said it tasted weird like metal. The pub Burger was pretty good and cooked perfectly. The French onion soup was also pretty tasty. Problem was when my burger came out it had a few cold fries on the plate. The waitress said ""this was the last of the fries but he's making more and I will bring you fresh fries when they're done"". 10 minutes later I'm making my way through the burger without fresh fries. Then I notice that there is a long hair with lint on it in the cold fries that were originally put on my plate. Eventually the fries came out when I was about done eating. Then I hear the waitress serving a burger to the table next to us and tells them the same thing :""the fries will be out soon. He needed to cook more. So the cook makes the other  food then cooks the fries???? What's the heck? Not acceptible. No wonder they are nearly empty at 1230pm."
Angie K.,"Hayward, CA",0,13,5,1.0,6/1/2017,"TEERIBLE SERVICE! I will never go to this specific Applebee's ever again. The waitress who I believe said her mame was Mariela was rude, and did not have the customers best interest in mind. She took really long in coming to ask us how our food was or if we needed anything else which we did. She didn't write our order down to begin with, which is probably why she forgot half of my order and also got it wrong, then argued with me when I told her I had the wrong plate. So rude, never coming back. My husband who is very easy going was even surprised at how terrible the service was because we have gone to several other Applebee's restaurants and have had far better experiences. If you want a good meal and good service, don't waste your time here."
Brenda A.,"Windsor, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/12/2017,"I usually don't leave one star reviews when things have not gone quite right but the experience tonight was so extreme it's actually bordering on comical. I sent in my order from my mobile device so it was very, very clear what I was ordering and they could not have screwed it up anymore than they did. I ordered a hamburger without onions and I added pickles. I was told my order would be ready at  curbside pick up at 7:04 PM. I arrived at 7:06 PM and waited for five minutes till somebody came. She took my money and eventually returned with my change which I left for her as a tip,...a very generous tip since it's holiday time. I proceeded to wait for another 10 minutes until somebody came and said that my order had been prepared with onions and they were having to remake it. At 7:37 PM I finally got frustrated and decided to go in and tell them to cancel the order as I had now been sitting outside in my car for a half an hour. I waited for five minutes to get my refund and just then my order was brought forth from the kitchen and I decided just forget it and take it with me. When I got home I opened the hamburger that took nearly 45 minutes to make and was incredulous to find that the burger I ordered without onions but please add pickles contained no pickles and tons of onions. So they could've save me a hell of a lot of time if they had just given me the original burger that they screwed up in the beginning since nothing had changed. I won't be back."
Mrs. B.,"Windsor, CA",0,16,,1.0,4/10/2017,"If I could give it 0 stars I would.  I Ordered the ribs, by far the WORST ribs I have EVER eaten.  There were five tiny ribs with VERY little meat and each one so dry that it was like jerky, completely inedible.  I attempted to eat two but could not stomache eating the rest.  The grilled vegetables and baked potatoe were decent.  I mentioned the inexcusable quality of the ribs and the waiter deducted $8 from my bill (it was a two for $25 deal). I also ordered a meal to go for my son at home (grilled chicken, grilled vegetables, baked potatoe).  I should have checked the order before we left as there were hardly any grilled vegetables of which they charge an extra 99cents for and there was no butter or sour cream for the baked potatoe.  WE WILL NEVER GO BACK."
Ashley P.,"Windsor, CA",0,3,2,1.0,12/7/2017,"So we just walked into Applebee's. They had about 3/4 full. We were told it would be about a 20-30 minute wait because ""They can't seat people if the cooks can't handle the orders."" We are a party of 6 with young children. We asked if we could just be sat at an open table while we wait. The hostess told us she didn't know because she had only been there 3 days. We asked to speak to the manager. She came back a few minutes later and said he couldn't come out because he was helping with ordered in the back!!!!! What kind of manager at a restaurant doesn't come out when they are asked for? Then a customer walks by and said they waited over an hour for their food and then they didn't even have their order.  We walked out. Sorry Crapplebee's you have officially lost our business. Has anyone else noticed that service everywhere has just been totally crappy? I never rant like this, but I am so over it!"
George R.,"Windsor, CA",1,22,28,3.0,12/24/2016,"I went out with my daughter because the rest of the family was making tamales for Christmas. Our server was very attentive the whole time. However there were four other staff members hanging out with nothing to do ( slow night) I was not impressed with the new menu, seemed scaled down to basic bar fare and I felt that it was over priced for what it was and the quality wasn't the best. It's not a bad place if you want to drink and watch a sports game but not the best for family experience."
Mark Taylor - L.,"Windsor, CA",0,20,13,3.0,12/15/2016,They need to start putting more food on the plates. Seriously!!! My partner got the bean and steak soup yesterday and it looked as if only two tablespoons were in the bowl. I'd rather go to Adel's in Santa Rosa as they put more food on your plate and the food is actually a bit tastier!
Willie G.,"Ponce, Puerto Rico",11,147,778,1.0,10/1/2015,"Not a fan of this place at all! My girlfriend was here with her friends after work and she asked if I wanted anything... I decided to try the Mac n Cheese with bacon and chicken strips because my co-worker loves it.. It was horrible, there was no receipt in the bag, she left to take the dog for a walk, the to go menu had no prices, I texted her and asked... Did u pay for this or did work pick up the tab?... She said ""I paid for it"". I didn't even ask how much and then said ok thanks baby. So my son looked up the price online to see if it was worth taking back.... $14! REALLY FOR THIS!? Hells yes I'm taking it back. I showed up and the manager was really shocked I didn't like it, asked me if I wanted something else.... Ummmm, NO! I would like my girlfriend's $ back please & no I do not have a receipt. He gave me the cash and was very nice about it. Stay away from here... Food is gross!"
Carol M.,"Windsor, CA",3,66,,3.0,6/19/2016,"I actually like Applebee's in Windsor. Love those crispy wontons! For the most part the food is good and the staff very friendly and helpful! They definitely have a way to go on their outside delivery as the app really works. I had to go into the place, ordered The food, ran a quick errand and the food was brought to my car by a very nice staff person. However, when I got home the portion size of something I ordinarily order was half the size of a plate that I would've received if I heading inside. The small to go Caesar salad was huge! Strange and disappointing! I hope that management will provide some assistance in straightening that out. Gave it three stars anyway from prior experience :-)"
George M.,"Windsor, CA",92,34,216,4.0,2/15/2016,It's Applebee's   been to 1 been to them all. All the food tastes the same but it is decent and almost too convenient and wins over taco bell anytime plus tv in your face helps too
Kent L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/20/2016,"NO! Ordered appetizer, never got it. The waitress forgot! How do you forget the one thing ordered?? Then after we did order she finally brought our drinks, I flagged her down for another beer that she did turn in the order for and it sat on the bar while she compared tattoos with another patron. I finally got up and picked it up at the bar myself! The food well, it's Applebee's, so you get pretty much what they offer but this is the second time for this kind of service and quite honestly the last!"
Mark P.,"Daly City, CA",105,1,,1.0,6/5/2016,This place is a joke... I showed up tonight 6/5/2016 at 11:36pm and the doors were locked and there were people inside.... You should close at the FUCKING time you post! The gentleman at the Taco Bell across the street was very nice and they were actually open at the time they said they would be.
Leonard B.,"Springfield, OR",46,10,,3.0,3/5/2017,"Super slow service, took 15 mins to see our first glimpse of our server. Food came out hot and good but took another 30 minutes. We came back three times in a row, and it was the same speed every night. Don't expect to get out if here in under an hour."
Chris K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,45,23,4.0,9/21/2016,Went here for dinner with a coworker. The waitress was nice and provided great service. Food was good. Atmosphere was good. It was everything you'd expect of an Applebee's. No real complaints. Not a fan of the way you pay. It's on a tablet which was a bit time consuming and cumbersome.
Brenda W.,"Windsor, CA",48,7,,1.0,2/4/2017,Terrible!!!  Do not get a salad!!!  It is about 10 bites and soggy. The hot wings are decent on a good day.
Jason S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",17,270,2,1.0,8/13/2015,Stay away Over priced food. The food was not good at all paid $10 for a plate of nachos that should cost max $5. Hell I could have gone to Taco Bell and gotten food. Just stay away.
Gagan P.,"San Diego, CA",70,5,,2.0,8/10/2016,"I was visiting my cousin who lives in the nearby neighborhood and we decided to try out the happy hour menu. Since it was very close and we were going to be drinking we decided to walk to the restaurant. The staff was very nice, with our server Emily being great. However the manager decided to cut off our drinks after our 2nd round due to him not wanting us to drive home. We explained to the manager that we walked here and that we were ubering back home yet to no avail, he did not let us continue ordering drinks. We explained to the server that we walked here and were ubering back yet the manager still did not let us continue to order drinks. We were not belligerent or disturbing any other guests as we had only had two drinks so I can not see why the manager would care to stop us. This is my first experience at a restaurant where the manager has stopped a table from ordering drinks even though we explained none of us were driving. I am only giving two stars because the food was good and the staff was nice."
Juniper L.,"Healdsburg, CA",9,6,1,2.0,6/22/2015,"My friends and I have tried this place 3 times and always left disappointed. The food is okay but service is appalling, so much so that I didn't leave a tip the last time we went. And I always tip. Twice we've had the experience of having to send our food back and not being able to eat our lunch/dinner with the other people seated with us. The parking isn't very good either. My friend says she's never going there again. I won't miss it."
Kai D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,8,,4.0,1/16/2016,"It's hard to give this place even 4 stars because the food is so bad. We didn't eat here this time, but Applebee's are all the same. We stayed at the hotel next store and went in for drinks since it is the only kind of late night place to drink in Windsor. There is no reason to even give it 4 stars except for the bartender. What a delight Christine is and they are lucky to have her. She makes a great drink and it is such a pleasure to sit at her bar. She makes you feel right at home and actually holds a conversation with you. If you come here make sure it is on her night and sit at the bar! I wish I could say we will be back soon, but let's be real, it's Applebee's."
Calista P.,"Windsor, CA",32,42,26,4.0,4/18/2016,"I try and take the kids here regularly. My son loves the BBQ wings, and my daughter loves the fries. We always have very friendly and tolerant of children wait staff. Sometimes getting the wait staff to notice you after you've ordered can be difficult. They seem more concerned with other members of the staff, than with our table."
Sirena L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",96,144,166,3.0,4/5/2015,Great service.. Wendy was an excellent waitress. Food arrived fairly quick and we didn't have to miss the warriors game they have TV's everywhere so you can enjoy watch your favorite sport team while you eat and chatting with your company.
Milo J.,"Windsor, CA",0,9,1,1.0,8/21/2015,"Would give zero stars but unable to do so. Went to Windsor ca Applebee's, manager was rude after we had to wait to order! We finally left without ordering after the manager called us liars about how long we were waiting, then heard someone else complaining as we were walking out. DO NOT GO TO THIS APPLEBEES!! It is worth the 10min drive to go to the one in Santa Rosa!!!"
Cindy S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/5/2016,Our family went to Applebee's last night. Don't go there.  I asked for a blackberry lemonade with a shot of vodka.  My 10 year old ordered the same thing without the vodka as it was originally on the non alcoholic menu.  When my daughter got her drink there were no blackberries as shown on the menu in her drink and in a large glass I questioned the waitress but her response didn't make any sense?  When I got mine I had blackberries in mine and was in a very small cocktail glass!  It was disappointing as I wanted the larger glass to cover the vodka taste and when I asked the waitress again she stated that it was small glass cause it came from the bar- but the drink originally was non alcoholic? We ordered our food from the 2/$25 menu-- what we got compared to the picture on the menu was a big disappointing letdown.  I ordered this mashed potatoes with cut rare steak that had gravy and onion rings on top.  What I got was over cooked meat 2 tiny onion rings and they threw on French fries?  In hind sight I wish I would have taken a pick of the food I actually received and a pick of the menu picture to post.  Someone else in our family ordered this cooked potatos with chicken breast that ( in the menu) had a light sauce with shrimp. Sorry I don't remember the names of the dishes.  What we got was a sizzling plate with raw onions the potatoes and onions were super hot like they had been microwaved ( the manager assured us they weren't). Chicken breast was warm with a pat of herbed butter on top of the chicken that was not melting?? No shrimp or the nice sauce shown on menu. We tried explaining things to the manager but all she could offer was one free dessert.  We won't be back. False advertising
Jaden C.,"Orland, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/26/2015,My best friend and I ordered an appetizer of ribs and sweet potato fries. While the food was delicious the portions were insanely small. We paid an outrageous amount for about twenty fries and three small small ribs that were mostly bone. We also did not receive the best service. I would not recommend this as a top choice-- maybe a last resort.
Alyssa B.,"Sacramento, CA",49,14,53,1.0,7/27/2015,"Went to this location once. Horrible service! Myself and two others waited and waited to have our order taken. We even pressed the service button that is suppose to alert your waiter. Our waitress just kept walking by & started chatting with her coworkers , she saw us repeatedly and did nothing. My aunt walked up to her and told her we were leaving & it seemed that she couldn't care less."
Senia B.,"Windsor, CA",19,69,44,1.0,3/13/2015,Worst food ever. Had there lunch special it's so bad don't recommend u eat there. Go to Marys Pizza instead. Don't know what I was thinking
Ellen C.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,2,2.0,9/16/2014,"Apple Bee's has been at the bottom of my list for many years and I won't go there unless I don't have a choice.  Food portion is small when ordering the 2 for $20/24 and the taste was just ok. However, we asked the steak to be cooked medium and discussed the definition with the waiter, the steak came out WELL-DONE! There is no pink at all. The 9oz steak is very small, too. Not to mention about the small amount of plain vege and pathetic potatoes. Bad choice of restaurant tonight."
Stephanie V.,"Windsor, CA",143,262,394,2.0,6/11/2012,"I cannot believe i am writing a review of applebee's, much less one that is not 1-star.  But here goes... I absolutely do not like chain restaurants.  And sorry, but Applebee's is at the bottom of my list of places I'd make a conscious choice to dine. However, my daughter received a gift certificate for a free milkshake so I took her to get it.  We were both hungry for lunch, and well, there we were.... we ordered lunch. I ordered the French onion soup and a salad, and both were surprisingly tasty.   She ordered the slider burgers, without the bun (something she picked up from her older cousin), and they absolutely KILLED those poor little pucks of meat.  They were charred to the point where I should have sent them back, but I didn't bother.  I let my daughter fill up on her free oreo milkshake, which was actually quite delicious. The service was not bad.  However, one of the ""manager"" waiters picked up some plates from a booth near our and as he walked around the corner past us, a slew of food fell off one of the plates... corn, beans... lots of little bits.  He never returned to pick it up.  As another waiter walked by, I cautioned him to watch his step, and then I realized he probably thought WE were the ones who made that mess, which makes me giggle a little when I think about it.   That other waiter came back with a vacuum and was very apologetic to have to vacuum right by our table as we were eating.  He was very gracious and sweet. Will I be going back to Applebee's?  Probably not.  But if I absolutely HAD to, I would order the soup and salad.  And a milkshake too."
Emily G.,"Boston, MA",13,92,47,2.0,3/21/2015,Everything at Applebee's tastes like it came from a freezer bag and was microwaved. But they do have a good happy hour
Ashley R.,"Petaluma, CA",14,18,4,1.0,11/25/2014,Horrible service our waitress was Maribel and she asked one table if they would like refills to their refreshments but not us and avoided our table! Total crap! I tip based on the service I received and needless to say I will not be coming back here again! Totally disappointed!!
Varshana C.,"Occidental, CA",83,122,91,4.0,12/16/2013,As far as Applebee's goes.. This one is the best in the area. Service is quick and friendly and the food is always hot. You can't expect much from a chain restaurant that is priced on the lower end so I don't understand some of the terrible reviews. People must not know what to expect. I have been terribly disappointed in Applebee's since I've moved to the west coast but this particular location has restored a bit of faith in the giant chain. Always a great place to grab a quick lunch or have drinks while watching the game. Never a great steak though.
