L. G.,"Windsor, CA",0,22,,4.0,1/29/2013,"You know, I read the other reviews on here.  What are these other diners expecting?  Are they idiots?  I mean, this ISN'T a 5 star restaurant.  You shouldn't expect better food quality unless you're willing to pay for it.  Hello?  It's a cheapo diner with a sports bar. It delivers exactly what it promises, noisy atmosphere on game day and all. Having said that, I like it here.  There is a consistent wait staff that are friendly and do their jobs right.   I get exactly the kind of food that should be expected here.  The food is just one step up from fast food.  But it's cheap.  This is not expensive dining.  I've never been displeased with any dish, from chicken to pasta to steak to salad.... but then again, I didn't have unrealistic expectations, either.  Your dinner is going to run from about $8-15.  They have a good 2 for $20 deal that includes an appetizer.  That's a pretty good deal.  The apps are half off during happy hour so you can get an $8 app for $4 so that's not bad either. The place is kept clean, including the bathrooms.   If cheap is what you're after, this will fit the bill.  If you want higher quality food and a matching ambiance, this is not the place to go.  Only a tourist would mistake Applebees for fine dining... come on, people...  It definitely delivers what you would expect from a sports diner."
Sammy L.,"Windsor, CA",240,2,,1.0,11/22/2014,"Sometimes I love the service here and some of the workers are super nice and friendly and then there's certain times when one bartender in particular always manages to make me and anyone I'm with feeling completely unwelcomed and awkward  I am not positive about what her name is I think it might be Christina, she has really short curly hair and is a complete crazy person about the straws you put in alcoholic beverages and clearly doesn't have any boundaries when she rips it completely out of your mouth. I will never be coming in here again when I see her standing in the bar."
Erika W.,"Portland, OR",0,5,1,1.0,8/14/2015,"Over priced!! Ordered a ten dollar salad with shrimp and my friend ordered halibut fish and chips. The halibut was nice but small portions (three little nuggets) for thirteen dollars. Also The salad was the size of a McDonalds side salad and the shrimp was thrown on there with no seasoning... at least it wasn't still frozen. Will not be coming here again, I threw my money down the drain with this meal."
Kelly O.,"Healdsburg, CA",0,10,5,1.0,6/11/2016,"It'd be 0 stars if that were possible. My boyfriend is Celiac and a group of my friends and I went to dinner the other night here. The last time my boyfriend and I went to Applebee's, a waitress guaranteed him that what he was going to order was gluten free and all. He took a bite and realized that his allergen was in what he just ate. For anybody who doesn't know what celiac is, you can't eat any form of gluten, no wheat, rye, barley, and nothing gluten containing may touch anything he's about to eat or he'll end up VIOLENTLY ill. Then, the other night, we go and he's too scared to eat there so he decides to run over to Mary's to get a pizza that he knows WILL NOT make him sick like applebees did the last time, and they refused to let him in the door with it at all. Fucking ridiculous. Applebees is HORRIBLE. I will NEVER eat there again and neither will the two groups of people we went with both times. Applebees does NOT care about their customers whatsoever. We are FURIOUS. I will be giving applebees the WORST of reviews. Will never spread anything good about them again. That was the last straw. Oh, not to mention, the other night some lady starts freaking out on some early 20s man calling him a child molester and saying he molested her son and to everyone in there keep your children with them, and they kicked her out. The guy didn't deny it, he just looked around at everyone watching. Applebees sucks. I'm done."
Melissa R.,"Windsor, CA",260,101,262,2.0,9/9/2014,"The service is great here, but the food not so much. They used to serve a cheese stuffed meatball and pasta dish but it has been removed from the menu. Food is mediocre/processed. Nothing tastes fresh."
K U.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/26/2015,"One of the most horrible experience we have ever had!  We first ordered appetizers which the waitress forgot one and when I brought to her attention she said. ""It's been sitting back there Do you want it?"" WHAT? Do I want shrimp that had been sitting for 20min. No Thanks!! We ordered our entrées. My boyfriend ordered the sirloin with shrimp. Once again NO shrimp. What's wrong with these people ?!?  Well I found out real quick. Instead of checking on guest and taking care of her tables. Our waitress was tucked behind a corner texting on her phone when I went to the bathroom and as well when I came out. We waited about 10min for her to come take our plates but nothing..... May I add its my boyfriends birthday and man did she piss him off. He  got up and got her attention and we were finally got the check and got the heck outa there!!! Never again!!"
Laura B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,5,,1.0,10/3/2015,"We typically go to this restaurant once a month or so as a family outing. Applebee's is typical restaurant fare that is decent for a family get-together. The last two visits have been so bad that we won't go back to this location until we know they've shaped up. The service and food used to be good. The portions are smaller and prices larger, but the service these last two times was horrible. In September, the waitress was barely there and did not know what my parents' Golden Apple card was (a senior discount). She said thank you as if my mom was handing her a gift and then didn't apply the discount or return the card! When we inquired about it, she said, ""Oh!"" and reached into ANOTHER CUSTOMER'S CHECK wallet and took my mom's card out to return it! This time was worse. Our waiter didn't approach our table for quite a while and one of our party joked with him about it. He apologized and said he had been running all over the place.which we thought odd because we were the only customers in his section.  It took too long to receive our drinks and one drink had lemon instead of a lime wedge in it.  Not a big deal.  The appetizers were on time.  Then we waited and waited and waited for our food.  When our server walked by our table to take care of new customers behind us, he made no eye contact at all.  I observed him actually walking around the long way to avoid walking by our table, serving new customers their food while we still waited.  Finally it arrived, and when one of our party complained we were met with a bland apology and excuse that everything had to be timed to come out at once.  The two hot dishes were cold.  I didn't want to have mine remade because I didn't want to wait even longer or risk having it messed with in the kitchen so I choked it down cold because I was hungry.  A man came by with the rest of our food and commented that he had overheard our complaints but I'm not sure why he said that because he didn't apologize or do anything about it at all.  He was dressed as management. There appears to have been a change in ownership or management.  Wait staff are not trained and have no customer service skills at all.  Customer satisfaction is what will keep a restaurant open, and this location just lost six plus whoever reads the recent reviews."
Stacey N.,"Windsor, CA",3,18,3,4.0,1/29/2013,"We come here often (weekly) for the 2/$20 and happy hour specials. U cant beat the prices and the service is always good. The food is well worth the money. (I do suggest skipping the steak though as its very small).  They have a friendly staff, clean restaurant and never really busy. We have never had to wait for a table.  Great place if you want a quick, cheap meal without a wait!!"
Kayte T.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,20,,2.0,4/24/2014,"The food and service was good, but the GM, Ken, was a JERK! I'm not sure how he's still in charge of the restaurant. Not a pleasant man, at all!"
Robert M.,"Windsor, CA",5,3,,5.0,3/21/2014,I always enjoy the service at the bar as well as the food.  I would 100% recommend Applebee's in Windsor for a quick beer and a bite to eat.
Vira P.,"San Francisco, CA",336,1141,1134,3.0,1/16/2011,"As the rating says, this place is okay.  The waitress was really nice and the food came out promptly.  But the food is standard Applebee's dishes, so don't expect any innovations in culinary cuisine.  It's decent and cheap. I will say that the decor is very plain compared to other the other chains-no cheesy knick-knacks on the wall.  This statement is neither a complaint nor compliment.. just a mere and interesting observation."
Ed M.,"Healdsburg, CA",0,10,,2.0,3/29/2015,"Arrived 7ish and was seated immediately with menus.  Waited a very long time for a waitperson.  When she got there we ordered before dinner drinks and mealtime beverage (water).  Since we had such a long wait we had already decided what we wanted and ordered our food: soup and entre.  Perhaps that was a mistake. After another long wait came water.  A little while later came our before dinner drinks.  Shortley thereafter came the entres, then the soup.   So, while we were drinking our margaritas, our food was getting cold.  The waitress came by and asked how everything was, so I complained about the timing.  She seemed to have no idea of the problem. I am old, and perhaps customs have changed, but am I wrong in expecting the before dinner drinks to arrive well ahead of the food and mealtime beverage, the soup ahead of the entre? A new Latitudes restaurant has recently opened in Windsor.  Far superior to Applebee's in all respects."
S A.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,8,,1.0,6/10/2012,"Very noisy teen age music,  fat laden food  prepared  with too much salt  Will not recommend or return  Sad it's a good location."
Kaity G.,"Vancouver, WA",28,25,211,4.0,12/9/2011,"It's Applebee's...  However, since we have a friend who is a server here, we frequent to see him. The happy hour deals are good. Half price apps and 3 dollar long islands! Yum. Not the greatest food, but a good place to enjoy friends over some cheap junk food, and lets face it, sometimes we need a little junk food."
Amber P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",94,1,,1.0,11/14/2014,"Absolutely hands down the worst Applebee's I have ever vist .. food SUCKS, service SUCKS ... and the manger Jodi is beyond rude .. I ordered the 2 for 25 deaL, 2 kids meals & a special strawberry lime margarita .. 1st my drink tasted like fruit juice with no alcohol in it,  when your paying 10$ for a single drink you should taste something right??  Then the food came out my mashed potatoes were so bland and cold tasted disgusting my steak was so burnt and small, I couldn't believe that they thought it was ok to serve, My boyfriend got the oriental chicken salad and they couldn't even do that right !! Barley any salad, chicken, or dressing.. I was appalled with what had just served in font of us, that's not the worst part My kids meals came out and my son's cheese burger was soaked in oil, burnt to a crisp, so was my  my other sons corn dog. when I asked my server for a manger he went to get her, I explained to her the problem, she seemed applaud and had no empathy for my concerns she was very snippy and unprofessional and rudely took the food away  after the meal was finished..  I still ended paying 30$ for my ""Margarita"" & burnt kids meals I asked to find out the Mangers name the young girl cleaning the table next to us replied his name is Mr.Aguilar ..   I was shocked to find out that the lady I spoken to wasn't even the store manager!!! I dont know about you but as a paying customer I like to be respected, and treated fairly, but It was obvious to see that I wasn't important enough to be dealt with properly..  WILL NOT GO BACK TO THIS APPLEBEE'S :( !!!!!!!!!"
Lucy A.,"Windsor, CA",0,5,2,5.0,10/19/2014,"I want to say that in all of these other reviews they are expecting so much more, it's Applebee's everyone! It's a nice little family restaraunt with a sports bar, so if you're expecting a fancy meal then you might want to head down to Healdsburg instead. Then again, if you're walking in expecting an Applebee's, it's one of the best I have been to. Genuine nice staff, always happy always smiling, very clean facility, food came out very quickly, amazing desserts, what more do you need? I suggest you head on down during happy hour which is all day except between 6-9. Who doesn't love half off mozzarella sticks?"
Kelly G.,"Windsor, CA",1,6,,1.0,8/26/2015,"Will never go here again. Completely incompetent Bartender who proceeded to charge us for erroneous drinks and food on our bill. We have come here frequently with a large group and never had an issue, there is a waitress there who is fabulous and has consistently been delightful with our group. We are local, honest families who have given them a ton of business. The Bartender charged us for items we did NOT HAVE to the tune of $125+. He also tried to double bill another person in our party. Then, the Bartender proceeded to CLOCK OUT and LEAVE us with this completely inaccurate bill! The Manager was beyond unprofessional and told us that our friends who left earlier must have left us with their bill and told us we had been there all day drinking...excuse me?! NOT TRUE, and where did your Bartender go? Everyone in our Party had separate bills and paid them in their entirety when they left. The waitress who normally helps us felt horrible but there was little she could do. We were completely horrified. Never again."
Jovinho B.,"Windsor, CA",2,8,4,1.0,2/17/2015,"I've lived down the street from this place for years, and honestly, in writing this, I've realized for the first time how continuously bad the service is. As a whole there is just a cycle of laziness and unprofessionalism that makes eating at this particular Applebees a pain. I grew up loving whenever we went to Applebees as a kid and to this day am a huge fan of the food, but it just seems that too often, the service has taken too long on slow weekday nights, the hosts and servers have been unhelpful and preoccupied with their own thoughts, and the bartending quality, for those who enjoy going out to bars, is genuinely flat out poor. Most recently I had a late night bar tender doing nothing but talk to one of her coworkers while my drink just sat there waiting to be taken to my table some thirty feet away. When I asked the bartender about this her response was completely rude, sarcastic and unnecessary. I talked to the manager about it and he was nice enough and gave me a few free coupons, but all in all I just don't like going to this apple bees anymore. I'd much rather drive the extra seven miles to eat at the one in Santa Rosa."
karen r.,"Windsor, CA",0,20,,1.0,10/4/2014,Sitting at the bar looking across at a 6 year old girl sitting at the bar as well. How is this OK? The manager needs to be fired!!
Victoria S.,"Healdsburg, CA",24,30,1,1.0,3/20/2010,"I will never go to this (or any) Applebee's ever again! Serious food safety violations! He ordered a burger and it came out (with literally 5 french fries, seriously?) and the burger patty was misshapen and probably 4x bigger than the bun. I reached over to touch it and it was raw (no kidding) RAW. Not rare, where it was pink in the middle, it was flat out raw, mushy hamburger meat. (Salmonella anyone?) I'm so glad I saw that before he took a bite. It took forever to flag down our waiter and he acted like it was our problem - SO RUDE! And after all that, all they did was cook the patty he already had. (It still had my finger-poke hole in it) Nothing on their menu is good, I've eaten at other locations and for the price, the food is horrible. Not fresh, everything is microwaved (I had a friend who worked their for a brief time, told me this)  Don't waste your time here, there are plenty of other local places in the same price range with much better food and service!"
