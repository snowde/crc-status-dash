T. W.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,426,202,4.0,4/9/2012,We were all pleasantly surprised by the food and service here.  The $2.49 Hot Fudge Shooter desert is a great way to finish the meal.
Cheryl F.,"Santa Rosa, CA",24,24,1,1.0,10/10/2012,"Awful food. I ordered what I thought would be a delicious burger and fries and what I got was overdone oil soaked fries and a tasteless burger. Burger king burgs taste better. I wanted the ""choose two"" lunch but since I was ordering it ""to go"" they said I couldn't have it, hence the burger choice. No explanation as to why a to go order could not be lunch special. When I got there, parked in designated area, girl asked me if I wanted to place an order, when I had already given car make and model and time which I would arrive. I was annoyed, then it wasn't ready so I waited another ten minutes or so since they'd made it wrong. I will stick with quiznos next time."
Stacey R.,"Rio Nido, CA",13,52,1,2.0,7/3/2012,"Friendly staff, great bar selection, noisy, sports bar atmosphere so don't try to have an intimate meal with someone. I had the Bruschetta salad and while it was good it was not impressive. I had to order extra dressing because it was not dressed enough. Freshness was not there and there was 2 hard chunks of lettuce stalk in it. They looked like large green dice, all they needed was numbers etched into them. Will never go there for a ""light lunch"" again."
Laurene E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,1,3.0,5/9/2014,"I have to say this was a disappointing Applebee's. We ordered soup, appetizers, and dessert. The tomato basil soup was ok a bit too salty. The appetizer trio was chicken wings- these were good, pretzel sticks with beer cheese dip this was the best thing we ordered, and steak quesadilla which were terrible. The chocolate lava cake was very very rich and a little too sweet. I doubt we would go back."
Karen M.,"Healdsburg, CA",46,110,,2.0,6/28/2009,"I met my daughter and her boyfriend here for lunch.  I am not reallly a big fan of chain restaurants, so you know that right of the bat. They have a huge menu, that looks interesting, and overwhelming all at once.  My daugher and I split a chicken dish that came with mashed potatoes and brocoli.  It was ok, nothing really bad, just nothing really exciting.  Kind of reminded me of cafeteria food.  The boyfriend had a combo thingy with appetisers.  Some sliders and fried chicken fingers or something like that.  It looked ok, too. Service was quick, polite, no problem there. I think if you want an average meal at an average price, then go for it!"
Candi B.,"Windsor, CA",1,13,,1.0,6/17/2014,"I ordered the BLT looks great in the picture says it has 6 slices of bacon it came with two slices of bacon, one piece of wilted lettuce and two half slices of tomato on untoasted bread, things seem to be going down hill quickly.  We need a decent late nite eatery in Windsor. Applebee's is not it."
C. O.,"Salem, MA",0,16,,3.0,7/8/2012,Two tables of beer pong in bar area. Little kids running around. Not a good place for Friday night dinner.
Mike W.,"Paradise, CA",1,8,1,1.0,5/6/2014,"Way too hit or miss. Had to stay at the Hampton for a while and it's right next door. Food was typical so so Applebee's food the first time I ate there. The second time I came by myself and waited.... And waited... Then ten minutes after being seated and seeing two other tables get their order taken, I waited another 5 and still nothing, not even a water! I said your loss Applebee's you can suck it and walked out. Won't be getting anymore of my money. Horrible customer service. Microwave dinner way better option!"
Sunny D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,254,1,4.0,2/1/2012,"I usually pre-order and use the car side service, which works out great for me.  Food is always ready on time and hot.  Employees are cheery.  I have dined in the restaurant a couple times.  Each time, the service was good and food tastey.  I always order the Weight Watchers meals and each is delicious."
Jerry B.,"Windsor, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/3/2012,"Should have known better than to order a steak at Applebees. But I had one a while back that wasn't too bad. Ordered medium rare, came out well done and full of gristle. Couldn't even cut it. They brought another which was raw this time. Manager came and said it is rare, I said ""no it is raw"". They took it off the bill after offering me a chinese chicken salad instead. No thanks. Will not order steak here again. In fact it may be a while before I eat here again."
Cristina C.,"Windsor, CA",6,2,,3.0,8/4/2011,"I'm vegetarian, so they don't really have many options for me. They used to have a really good meatless nacho plate offered on the menu, but on a recent visit, it was offered no more! My kids are always bringing home free applebees kids meal coupons from school for student of the month, good behavior, ect., so we go for the kids. ."
Charlie G.,"San Francisco, CA",63,49,12,3.0,4/28/2011,"Since my previous review, we've been here a number of times.  The kitchen's consistency and accuracy have improved noticeably and service continues to be, on average, very good."
Marilyn F.,"Windsor, CA",0,1,,2.0,8/21/2010,Most of these reviews are true .....needless to say.
Janice P.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,87,,4.0,4/7/2009,"I am a big fan out Applebee's I love the decor of the restaurants, and the family friendly atmosphere. The staff is typically upbeat and on top of things. I like the variety on the menu and the price ranges as well. the drinks are great too, and the parking is very convenient as is the location, right off the 101. The place can handle groups as well as 1 or 2 people. Oh, and order some appetizers, they are great!"
Ana S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/12/2010,Nothing but DISAPPOINTMENTS from this location. Manager is extremely rude and unacceptable. So much for customer service these days.
Brianna S.,"Greenwood, IN",90,3,,1.0,12/8/2010,"Applebees has always been a good option to bring kids and not feel like a complete jerk if they start to act up.  BUT, last week we went there and I got some serious food poisoning.  I ordered the French Dip sliders (which might have been my first mistake) and only ate 1 1/2 of them because there was a ball of human hair wrapped around some of the meet in the second one. I was completely grossed out but politely (and quietly) told the waitress about it. She was very nice and did not charge me for my order. However, within 2 hours of the meal, I (a 20 week pregnant woman) began throwing up and it lasted for at least 6 hours over night. I am still feeling the effects of it now. I called them and they just kept telling me about their safety procedures. I hope that they checked on that meat but didn't sound like they were going to do much, let alone report the incident.  I WOULD NOT recommend going there."
tc d.,"Windsor, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/14/2009,"I gave one star because the beer is cold and comes in a nice tall glass, otherwise I would give it negative stars if it is an option.  Its standard chain food, usually microwaved and if you're lucky the food will come out not cold.  I would like to meet the person or people who approved an Applebee's in Windsor.  I think we have enough less than stellar chain restaurants in Santa Rosa/Windsor area."
Dan Y.,"Santa Rosa, CA",26,415,6,3.0,8/2/2008,"When I first came to Windsor lo these many years ago there were two choices when it came to dining. On the Old Highway near the freeway, in the building now occupied by UME Japanese Bistro, there was a bar which mainly catered to the local rednecks however if you were hungry the owner had some frozen hamburgers which he would pop into his gas oven (no microwaves in those days). Or, over on the other side of town on Conde Lane, there was a trailer park/campground that had a little snack bar. The lady there would sell you a Hershey Bar or a bag of Lays potato chips, although if you were REALLY hungry she did have some frozen burgers that could be heated in her toaster oven. So when it came to fine dining in Windsor, your big decision was, did you want your burger heated in an electric toaster oven or an actual gas model? You could spend an evening debating the pros and cons of the toaster oven burger vs the gas oven. That was forty years ago. Today Windsor has about 30 restaurants including, as of July 26, 2008, an Applebee's. Usually you have to give a new restaurant a few months to get up and running, but what the hell, this is Applebee's, not some gourmet restaurant. Nothing about Applebee's is really special, the food is merely average, the drinks are tasty but stingy on the booze, and the service is hit-and-miss. But I like the atmosphere, the seamless combination of sports bar and family restaurant, and I'm glad to see that they've finally made it to my home town. The new location has a slightly more upscale decor than the other restaurants in the area, keeping the local memorabilia on the walls to a minimum. It seemed like half the population of Windsor was waiting for a table this evening, but somehow the newly-trained staff were doing a decent job keeping the customers satisfied. The food met our expectations, everybody found something they liked on the menu, and I was more than happy with my pomegranate margarita. I don't think we'll be coming here that often, but it's nice to know we have an Applebee's in the neighborhood when the mood strikes. Three stars."
