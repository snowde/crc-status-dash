Kayleigh E.,"Reading, MA",0,5,,5.0,10/22/2017,This is one of my favorite restaurants ever!!! Always feel welcomed when I come here. Our favorite waitress is Danielle who is always nice and really knows how to make your experience here great and is great with little kids. Also Kenny who will sing to music with you and make it like you are having a party and not just at a restaurant. Eddy was really nice and always happy and made us laugh so much. Steve who was our waiter once was really nice and was a really good waiter. The food was delicious my favorite thing to get is the fiesta lime chicken. And the service is amazing.
Alyssa L.,"Reading, MA",0,1,,5.0,1/2/2018,This is my favorite restaurant to go out to eat with my friends and family. I always feel welcomed by all the staff. My favorite waitress is Danielle because she is always checking in on her tables and is a very nice person. Danielle is so sweet and will get you whatever you need.
Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24566,5.0,4/15/2017,"Always a great experience from Applebee's, but the Woburn location was exceptionally fantastic!  Between TC (in training), Sara, and Dan (the manager), everyone who works here is always in a great mood and the most interested in pleasing all of their customers by providing a clean space, a healthy menu (well, not like some other chains), great bargains (the 2 for $20 menu is great!), and great service!  Onion rings, burgers, steaks and more, everything is delicious, decently sized, and perfect for a full meal. Miles better than some other chains of this type and the service is so fast. Sara, our waitress, was just so happy, funny, and kind. She completely brightened up my visit to this restaurant.  The restaurant is large in size and composed of a bar, tables, and booths. The ambiance is perfect for families as well as couples or even a group meeting. Casual dressing and never too long of a wait.  Comfortable place, and something on the menu for everyone.  Separate parking lot is a nice gesture, and ever a few to go spots.  Wonderful place to get a decent dinner meal in the Woburn area. 5 stars."
Brenda W.,"Woburn, MA",0,11,,1.0,4/20/2017,"Ordered takeout. It's never been this bad before. Got a 6oz sirloin, skewer of shrimp, baked potato. When I opened the potato, after noting they have gone back to salting the outsides (bad idea, too much salt, & the skin is where all the nutrition is) I found black parts through it. Managed to salvage about half. No need to buy such low quality potatoes, too many that are high quality at good prices to be chinchy.  The state was ordered medium, it was very rare. Char on the outside, in the center it was blood red & very cool. Again, shouldn't happen in a place with a good reputation. The shrimp was so undercooked I didn't trust them (my favorite part too), they were barely translucent. My husband will nuke them to death for lunch tomorrow. This Applebee's has gone down hill very rapidly. Have no idea why. But, they better change their ways or they won't be around much longer. I could have saved my dinner & presented it to the board of health, as unhealthy cooking. But, this time I didn't.  Even my frozen steak teriyaki rice bowls at lunch are better, they only cost $2.50. Their broccoli is beautiful, tender crisp, bright green, these were limp looking & faded.  Applebee's you used to be so good. What happened?"
Perry S.,"Woburn, MA",131,25,,5.0,5/17/2017,"I received a gift card to Applebee's for my birthday.  Usually I stear away from chain restaurants (having worked in one myself) but my boyfriend and I figured we should use the gift card and take a night off from cooking.  From the moment we walked in, Sam was outstanding.  She greeted us with a smile, told us about the special deals of the night, had an extremely positive attitude, and gave us the best service I've recevied in quite some time. Being in the business myself, I am a huge critic when it comes to service.  Dining at higher-end restaurants and receiving mediocre service at best, has become sort of a norm for my boyfriend and I.  But Sam is one of the best servers I've ever had.  As for the food, it's an Applebee's, you get what you pay for, but both of our meals were pretty tasty!  We will definitely be back to see Sam!"
Adam S.,"Framingham, MA",27,1,,4.0,6/4/2017,"Every time I have been there Kenny has been amazing on the bar. As well Jen D who was serving and Becky who was on the bar. Kenny is always spot on when working and makes everyone laugh. He goes above and beyond. He even helped as a host and sat people, even brought out delayed orders for tables! Also great suggestions from the menu to everyone at the bar. Becky makes a great drink when on the bar and makes sure your food is out in good time. Jen D was training on bar and did a great job too one of the times I was there. Granted this was over multiple visits.  No bad words for this place. Slightly biased, but kenny is amazing and needs a raise! He could be a manager. But knowing the industry, give that man a good raise and he makes that place so much better."
Dan C.,"Boston, MA",3,71,119,4.0,7/3/2015,"I've been here three times in the last month and don't understand the terrible reviews. Applebee's is pretty much your typical pub food. Love the 1/2 off appetizers after 9pm til closing. The wonton tacos are so good. I never would have considered ordering them without the recommendation of Kenny. Also, the chicken quesadillas have been hearty with tons of meat. Service here has been terrific in my experience. The waiters make light conversation while tending to your needs. One time an order of fries arrived to our table late and the waiter generously took it off our bill. The way I see it, Applebee's at this location is much better than most others I've been to."
Steve H.,"Watertown, MA",51,107,58,2.0,12/10/2015,"I have to say that I was disappointed with the food quality at this location, the potatoes were under seasoned, the steak was over seasoned. The Service was okay, and I did explain to the server my discontent for the food taste. The location itself seemed clean and well maintained and the hosts and server were nice. Overall, I would pass based on Quality of food."
Theja R.,"Burlington, MA",0,3,,5.0,2/17/2017,I'm shocked to see such low ratings for this place on yelp. I have been to this place couple of times recently and I really loved their service and food. I would recommend this for anyone near this place .
Aubrey D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",188,16,,5.0,1/9/2017,"We've been traveling from Phoenix, AZ and we wanted food because we got in so late we decided to come here. It was 11:25 and i saw that they close at 12 but we were desperate! A young gentleman named JC served us and he was awesome! Super friendly and nice and always made sure that our glasses were full. The food was great as well! We're new to the area and will be coming back because of the great service from JC and good food!"
Brooke P.,"Woburn, MA",82,10,,4.0,10/31/2016,"There's one reason I'm singling out this location of Applebee's among all its other locations: the bartender, Kenny. His spot-on recommendations and sense of humor were the reason we stayed for a second drink after intending only to pop in for lunch. The food was typical Applebee's fare; it was hot and reasonably tasty for a fast-casual lunch. Our server was extremely friendly and checked on us often. This may be the first Applebee's I ever return to as a regular simply to partake in Kenny's repartee and extensive drink knowledge."
Shelby G.,"Bentonville, AR",26,201,187,1.0,3/7/2016,"This place sucks. The service is poor. I waited for 5 minutes to even get seated, 5 minutes for the server to acknowledge our table, and 30 minutes for food to come out. I realize this is not a 5 star restaurant, but I had higher expectations. Drove by the other night and the sewer was backed up in the parking lot, just another day at Applebee's! The only reason I want to go back is out of convenience and the fact that I can walk there from home. I hope this place goes out of business and they put a nicer restaurant there... Like a Burger King. My friends and I now affectionately refer to this place as pooplebee's."
Terrell6 H.,"Wilmington, MA",55,7,12,1.0,7/24/2016,"Tonight my girlfriend and i ordered take out at this location and were very disappointed. Portion sizes are very small for the price and the food was not fresh and looked no better than left overs. Needless to say, we won't be going back here."
Karen S.,"Davis Square, Boston, MA",42,7,2,1.0,8/16/2015,"I would have given 0 stars if I could for service.  Our server's name is AMANDA M who at that time spent more time sitting on a booth, and rubbing the legs of another female that waiting on tables.  I pressed the ""call server"" button on the self-service tablet to get her attention, since she has not been back to take our orders (we've been waiting 10 mins). She just looked back from where she was sitting (with her GF) and took another 10 minutes to get back to our table, and then SNATCHED THE TABLET off our table. THIS MADE ME BELIEVE THAT SHE GOT UPSET OVER ME PRESSING THAT BUTTON ON THE TABLET. Our entree came after 10 mins, and our appetizers came 20 mins after that.She has been rude for the rest of our stay. I am unsure how the manager tolerates this type of behavior!!!"
Natasha G.,"Eatontown, NJ",36,238,153,1.0,11/12/2015,"Terrible, terrible service. From the moment we walked in the door until the moment we left. We came in at ten on a Thursday night and somehow still waited for at least five minutes for the hostess to show up. Our waitress was very inattentive, to the point where we could have easily dined and dashed, were we the type of people to do something that dishonest. Avoid this place at all costs."
Butch L.,"Woburn, MA",0,3,,3.0,2/19/2016,"Late one night, I decided I would stop by my local neighborhood Applebees for a bite to eat. Some of their appetizers are half price after a certain hour, so I decided on the boneless wings and the quesadilla appetizer.  The quesadilla was not bad, but nothing to write home about. The wings on the other hand were just flat out bad. They were also really small, but that might have been a blessing in disguise. What was I expecting from going to Applebees at 11pm and ordering wings and a quesadilla though? All that said, they do have the best kiwi lemonade I've had since Nam. I'm not much of one for giving out ratings, but if I was hand-delivered a subpoena and called to the stand as a witness in a court case involving my experience at this Applebees, I would give them a 6.3/10 rating."
Rev I.,"San Francisco, CA",1,60,4,4.0,10/17/2015,We asked for a booth they said there were none.  We got seated on uncomfortable high chairs and saw that there were 4 booths available right next to us.  Please don't sit people just so your waitresses don't have to walk 5 more feet. That chair was uncomfortable and there was no need for us to sit there when there was perfectly fine comfortable sits available. Michele our waitress was nice tho.. :) Manager came see us at the table to which was nice.
C P.,"Marlborough, MA",2,15,2,2.0,6/6/2015,"My husband and I are currently waiting for a carside to go order, and the employee responsible for bringing the order out came to our car while SMOKING A CIGARETTE, to tell us that the order would be ready in a few minutes. He is still smoking right next to our car and is now currently talking on his cell phone. I am extremely disappointed with the lack of customer service here and am disgusted that he actually lit a cigarette before coming over to our car. Hopefully management reads my review and does something. But the cowboy burger was good. Good food, terrible service."
Justin N.,"Burlington, MA",0,7,,1.0,12/5/2014,"I'm done with this location, for good.  I'll start with the highlight: the manager is a pretty swell guy, and always makes things right. That's seriously the only compliment I can muster about this place. I grew up on Applebee's as a kid (and it shows), so when I moved into my current apartment and had this location up the road, I was thrilled: free Wi-Fi, decent food, acceptable prices...I thought it'd be a good hang out joint, like everywhere else I've lived.  I was wrong. In the few dozen times I've been here, I have: *Had a waiter ignore me for the better part of half an hour before the MANAGER took my drink order.  Yes, I mean actively ignore me, as in he gave me a look of disgust before passing by every single time. *Repeated orders have had ingredients missing, been dangerously undercooked (which resulted in not one, not two, but THREE DIFFERENT INCIDENTS of food poisoning between myself and my friends) or overcooked to a crisp *Bill has been wrong multiple times, including the most recent incident where the waitress swapped our bills despite our very clearly separating our cards and tabs (mine was pinned to the OUTSIDE of the billfold with a pen, his was wedged inside the billfold) *Serving sizes of the sides vary wildly; one day I had enough fries they covered my chicken, the next visit I had maybe twelve to fifteen individual fries in total *Staff attitudes vary wildly.  Some staff love me, know my order preferences, and get everything out piping hot and ready to go.  Others really just don't give a fudge and will let my food sit in the kitchen until it's ice cold, and have the audacity to cop an attitude when I call them on it. At this point, the location has become a joke between my friends and I.  We've all gotten sick from it, the food is barely passable by *Applebee's* standards (and that's saying a lot!), and the fact the manager has to make quarterly rounds to make sure -everything- is okay with -every- table just speaks to how bad the rest of the staff tends to be (with a few exceptions - they know who they are, I hope!). I'm done here.  Never, ever coming back to this location ever again, maybe not Applebee's anywhere again.  At least Chili's is dependable with their food service."
Kevin L.,"Burlington, MA",0,5,2,1.0,9/17/2016,Just left after waiting 20 minutes for a hostess to seat me. No one who works for Applebee's was visible on the floor. 2 women walked in to pick up take out and a person from the kitchen staff helped them. Gonna be real hard coming back to a place where the customer doesn't seem to matter.
Wilfredo B.,"Waltham, MA",17,27,168,2.0,4/12/2015,"Well started off with The Boneless buffalo chicken wings they arrived cold inside and out. Returned them for new ones, they arrived nice and hot with them our dinner , the manager arrived with our food asked if we would line for them to return the entree and reorder it and we said yes. Entrées arrived by management who apologized several times and had coached the cook with the order. It arrived nice and hot. We ordered the triple cheeseburger and the quesadilla burger they were good but to greasy. Desert was the best the Apple Chimi and churro s'mores. We actually wanted the Baby Back ribs but they didn't have any :("
Rrin R.,"Woburn, MA",89,2,,1.0,3/20/2015,Gross food when I got my good thought it all was from the freezer I didn't feel Good half way thru dinner I indeed threw up worst food ever.! Service was ok but they all sit around and talk crap about the place right next to customer! So rude and unprofessional disgusted will never be going to Applebee's again
Petrovna B.,"Cambridge, MA",2,32,,3.0,1/10/2015,"Well, it's Applebee's! Not a bad place to visit after a movie to chat. Staff was nice, efficient, friendly. Appetizers, good except chips started having a strange aftertaste like they had turned, or were old. Standard pub food, served quickly, hot! Beer!"
Jon B.,"North Andover, MA",75,5,2,2.0,1/22/2016,"Food: 3.5/5 Service: 1/5 Our experience at the Woburn Applebees tonight was pretty dismal. Overall the food was pretty good but not perfect. The burger my brother got was overcooked, he was specifically asked if he wanted it pink in the middle or not and there was no pink in sight. Our friend's steak was ordered rare but was warmed through instead of simply being charred and served. Fried chicken tenders were overcooked to being hard even for a fork to pierce and overall the portion sizes were underwhelming. I wish I could say the food was the worst problem we faced. Service was incredibly slow. Even recognizing that it was a Friday night the restaurant was not that busy and there were service people everywhere. Our first round of drinks arrived after our appetizers, and we weren't offered a second until halfway through our entrees which showed up after our entrees were finished. A dessert was brought to our table that we didn't order and while eating dessert my brother requested a mountain dew which took forever to show up. Finally our check was delivered and we waited at least ten minutes before it was picked up. One could blame the delay on the alcoholic beverages on the bar but everything else service-wise can only be blamed on the wait staff. I have been to this Applebees many times over the years and this is by far the most disappointing experience I've ever had. The standards have certainly dropped over the years."
Mary D.,"Billerica, MA",0,8,,1.0,10/7/2015,The quality of food is not good. I got a steak and it was chewy and fatty basically couldnt eat more than I paid for. My daughter got chicken and it was rubbery you could probably bounce it off the table. Its not just this location its ALL Applebees the quality of food is horrible - the 99's and Chillis have such better food and its in the same category as Applebees. I dont know what it is at any Applebees Ive been to but it takes forever!! Our waitress took our drink order came right back we waited over 15 mins for a house salad and chips and salsa seriously why should those take so long. Applebees should really think of upgrading their service and food. I will not go back to any Applebees.
Rachel L.,"Saugus, MA",14,30,4,3.0,8/6/2015,"Went here for dinner with a group of friends... Appetizers were good we got the chicken quesadilla, classic buffalo wings, and wonton tacos .... For dinner i got the chicken tenders platter ... Which was good chicken was nice and crispy.... For dessert I got the churros... Which are delicious at the saugus Applebee's, but this cook didn't put cinnamon on the churros and even when returned and he did he/she sprinkled like a pinch of it... Definitely not worth getting"
Jesse R.,"North Reading, MA",0,3,,1.0,5/17/2015,"My family and I went there and the food was mediocre (overcooked steak, bland food, etc).  The service was horrible.  Although the waitress was pleasant, she would disappear for periods of time.  When looking for her a couple times during our visit I noticed her coming out of the kitchen... somewhere she didn't need to be for her job.  At the end of eating, I waited 10 minutes (already was there for nearly an hour and a half for our meal), then decided I was going to have to find her if we wanted our bill so we could leave.  Come to find her in a little sink area off to the right of the kitchen with another couple waitresses chatting up one of the teenaged boy ""cooks"".  So the few times I had to wait at least 5-10 minutes for drink refills, fixing a order, and the bill... it appears she was too busy chatting up a boy rather than doing her job.  I am the type to let things slide once, but constantly having to watch for her so I could flag her down before she disappeared again got frustrating.   Fix the service and the food and you might have a decent place here, but it is obvious that is the whole business... and management of this place is failing miserably."
Bryan W.,"Wilmington, MA",2,63,22,2.0,11/1/2014,My mistake ording steak here. I get that. It had a texture and flavor i can even describe.  Didn't  eat it. Apps were good. Service was so poor the waitress didnt see i had not eaten a second bite of my steak until it was check time.  Shoild have played it safe and got a sandwich like my wife did.
Mark D.,"Salem, MA",0,1,,1.0,9/3/2015,"Let me preempt this review with one side note. I CREATED a yelp account just so I could warn people about this establishment If I could give less than 1 star I would. My experience here was nothing short of abysmal.  I went in for lunch with 4 of my co-workers today at 12:00pm. We get seated and our waitress comes up to us and takes our drink orders. No problems with the drink orders, they arrive shortly. We then put in 5 simple meals: 4 hamburgers (MEDIUM) and 1 shrimp scampi. Once we put in our order we wait for no less than 35-40 minutes for our food with not ONE mention or apology from our server. She did not come by once in the 40 minute wait to inform us about where our food comes. Finally, our food arrives at almost 1:00pm only to find out that all four of our MEDIUM burgers were charred to a crisp, almost inedible. We immediately ask for the check, wanting to end this experience as soon as possible. The server comes back and rudely mentions that she ""so kindly"" deducted 10 dollars from the bill because of the ""slightly over cooked hamburgers."" At this point, we were all late from our lunch break and in more of a hurry than before. We quickly give her our cards and she proceeds to mix up our charges not once, but TWO times, taking close to 20 minutes. Finally after about an hour and a half of nothing but inconvenience, we pay our bills and leave. We were not apologized to once throughout our entire meal, or even asked if everything was OK. I've been working in the Woburn area for over a year, and this is by far the worst restaurant experience I've had to date.  All in all, I will not be coming back to this restaurant for lunch again, and I strongly advise you to do the same."
Jacopo B.,"Burlington, MA",0,12,5,3.0,2/27/2016,"typical applebee forgettable family fare, EXCEPT for the ""triple hog"" sandwich, an improbable combo of pulled pork, ham and bacon on ciabatta bread, which is positively delicious, albeit slightly hard on the arteries"
Paul S.,"Medford, MA",0,14,2,1.0,9/30/2014,"This is the second time we've visited this location and I'm thinking the first time should have been enough! Terrible slow service! We walked in and were seated right away but that's were it ends. I noticed a waitress arguing with another in the back and after a 10 minute wait finally comes to take our order. She wasn't very bubbly to say the least. We ordered our drinks which took another 10 minutes. We ordered our meal which took 25 minutes to get to our table. We never saw her again, until we finished and sat there for another 10 minutes!!! Terrible!!!! This Applebee's need a wait staff that cares for its customers. Both times it sucked.   Never again!"
Nikki L.,"Winchester, MA",55,5,,1.0,10/13/2015,"First off ..I walked in there and there was a debate where to seat me, Finally after leading me around the restaurant away from the general population, I asked to be with people and was given an eye roll and chose to pick my seat, I ordered a Pomegranate Lemonade and was given regular lemonade, Fine nothing to nitpick over But I ordered the all American Burger  and when I said Medium, the waitress goes ""What's that"" Oh crap I'm in trouble, after 10 minutes my slightly raw only Cujo could eat it burger arrived, the waitress whom had a lisp dropped the plate and ran, never asking if I wanted anything else, the fries were so over salted I'm pretty sure the whole box of salt was dumped on them, After I ate half of the raw burger, I waited 20 minutes for the check but not before hearing the waitress whom I had and another waitress discussing the fact that 2nd waitress was sleeping with another girl's boyfriend ..the Height of Professionalism and then the Lisper came back, gave me back my change and scurried off. She got what she deserves ..a 2 buck tip ..I would have given more but I'm a nice person.  Seriously? this is a restaurant..how about some professionalism? a little courtesy? No wonder every1 says Applebee's sucks..when the place does close..it'll be a service to Woburn."
A R.,"Waltham, MA",0,12,,1.0,4/30/2015,"This is a horrible location. I went here in January. We ordered out food on the phone because we wanted to get it in before they closed the kitchen. When we arrived it was about 30 mins prior to close. We asked the waitress if we could sit and eat. She rudely exclaimed 'no' as there was people walking in and being seated, so we helped ourselves to a table. the manager then came over and apologized and gave us some free drinks which made everything fine. That is until my boyfriend and I cut into our 'well done' steaks to find them bleeding like they had just been butchered. It was extremely undercooked. I didn't even inquire on the steaks. Just take my money so I can leave. Never going back!"
Christine P.,"Malden, MA",0,3,,1.0,10/18/2015,"Went in on a Sunday early afternoon. Place was dead. Higher ratio of servers to customers. Yet despite the ample supply of ""service,"" we waited 10 minutes without so much as a server coming to greet us, never mind taking a drink order. To no avail, we decided ten minutes was long enough without any attention. Thanks but no thanks."
Wendi X.,"Tewksbury, MA",3,103,6,1.0,6/19/2014,"The lay out of this restaurant is crazy..the front door is a good walk away from where you park the cars.. With that stated if you are handicapped or temporally handicapped (meaning being injured) do not come here...why you ask..let me explain..my husband was on crutches. We saw someone come out of a door where the ramp is where you would park for handicap and the call ahead pick up curb side food order. So, I go and drop off my husband here. Get him all and let him start to hobble to the door while i go and park the car. When I get to the ramp I find from him the door wont open. So, we kinda waited for someone to exit..mm no one...so I told him to stay so I would go in and go over to the door and go open it for him cause it was a very long way for him to hobble over to the front door.  When I get in there I get asked right away how many I told them the handicap door is wont open. There answer is this...ready...yes we know it is locked, we have to keep it locked..What???? That makes NO SENSE...So, why even have a handicap ramp..oh wait I get it.. So, you can give it an illusion that your legally following the laws and screw the actual handicap people... All I have to say is shame on you and I do hope one day that you have to be on crutches and you have to travel that lengthy parking lot.  As for the wait staff, she was friend and prompt in the beginning but no one came back and asked us is everything was ok... As for the food it was fair...very greasy fries & onion rings (which they forgot to included with the order), the burger was cold and over cooked/dry... Then to top it all off - we exited out of the handicap door cause that was allowed, but when I went to retrieve the car some friggen idiot keyed my car.. So, my black SUV had several deep marks all over my freshly painted passages doors.... mmm ya so I can tell you this..this was first and last time I will ever come here"
Casey C.,"Woburn, MA",0,38,5,1.0,6/4/2015,"I get it, it Applebee's. I wasn't expecting much and they manage to deliver even less than that. I went mid week, mid day, I'm thinking / hoping it must have been shift change over. We got there and we were seated very quickly (the place was close to empty) by the nice hostess and we told our waitress would be right over, about 10 minutes later she did arrive and took our drink orders, I tried giving her our meal orders but she walked away too fast. A few minutes later she returned with our drinks/ took our orders and that was the last I saw of her. I'm not sure where she went but it would have nice/professional for her to say ""I'm leaving for the day and (name) will be taking over from here on."" Someone else delivered our food. No one checked on us. I needed more dressing since the chicken tenders on my oriental salad were so over cooked and tough, i was hoping a little dressing would soften them up and one of the people I was with ordered her meal with a side of rice, which was cold. Not sitting around and cooled off cold, like took right from them fridge and put in a plate. Gross and inedible. So we finished our food (the parts that were semi hot/edible) and sat, and sat and sat some more. Then a young man came over and cleared our dishes. Then ANOTHER young man asked if we wanted dessert, my friend did want to look so we said sure. And he walked away and returned 10 minutes later with the check. Not the dessert menu. The check. So my friend again asked him for the dessert menu and he brought it over. We picked a fried Apple cheesecake thing. Not too bad, but after a crummy meal they had no place to go but up. Again, I get it , it's Applebee's. I wanted something quick (that didn't happen) and semi-tasteful (Hahaha...not even close) but i guess that was asking too much. No worries, there are plenty of other restaurants around here that I just will go elsewhere for here on out"
Katherine R.,"Bedford, MA",0,8,,1.0,2/26/2014,Tired of being shorted. I love Applebee's white queso so I order some to go every few weeks to enjoy at home. Originally I was getting 4oz for my $1.50 - a great deal. But then it switched to 3oz. A bit disappointed but I understand the economy. The last few times I've gone however I've only gotten 2oz for my $1.50. They've basically secretly doubled the price and shorted me 9oz of what I've paid for. If they tried giving half a meal for full price they'd be in quite a bit of hot water but they seem to think this is acceptable behavior. Nope. Customer lost forever.
James P.,"Malden, MA",12,53,7,1.0,8/14/2011,Ok let's put this in order: - 15 minutes for drink order( no one here ) - our waitress sits in a booth more than serving us - food was incinerated - literally  - we have so many dishes on out table we needed to literally ask for help - even the manager lady doesn't give a crap - looks like I'm back at Chilis from now on
Jason B.,"Sandwich, MA",286,560,36,3.0,5/12/2011,"Applebees is Applebees.  It is what it is. A step down from the Nines.  Draft beers, bland-ish, uninspired bar food, and a ""pieces of flair"" vibe on every wall.  You've seen one, you've seen them all.  I give these guys a third star because of their commitment to charity.  They have a ""30 wing in 30 minute"" challenge.  For 5 bucks, you get 30 HOT wings.  If you can finish them in time, the restaurant donates 10 bucks to the Jimmy Fund.  If you can't, then you donate 10 bucks to the Jimmy Fund.  You show me someone who doesn't like that deal, and I will show you someone I will never be hanging out with.  By the way, the record time is 14 minutes and 52 seconds.  I asked."

My staff and I come here for happy hour every few weeks to sit back and relax afer a crazy day at the office.  It appears that others have the same idea, as about 4:30 it is always packed at the bar area.  I love that they have Blue Moon on tap.  Also the manager gives us discounts for coming here as an after work group. I can  not remember if if is free appetizers or 10% off food, or something like that. It is good that the restaurant makes an effort and treats us well.  The parking lot is always busy and full so sometimes you have to park in the Stop & Shop plaza across the street."
