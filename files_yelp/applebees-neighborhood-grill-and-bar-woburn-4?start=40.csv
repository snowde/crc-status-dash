Tommy C.,"Winchester, MA",0,3,,4.0,2/16/2015,Applebee's was amazing my buddy got the sampler which was overwhelming and I went with the 4 cheese Mac and cheese with chicken tenders which was fantastic. Besides the flat coke I enjoys the service and food #4stars great food I would go back
K B.,"Boston, MA",3,24,1,4.0,10/19/2012,Adrean... Is the only reason we come here. She is hands down the best service in this restaurant! My bf and I refuse to come here unless she is working. All the other bartenders could careless about you. The food is the norm Applebee's food.
Kate R.,"Ashburn, VA",1,34,4,1.0,7/24/2010,"I've been to this place a few times now. The waiters have always been friendly and are usually fairly quick. It also has a small parking lot that's easy enough to get to. However, the food is fairly subpar, even for an Applebee's. The one I normally go to back home has waaaaay better quality food.  The first time i went, the steak was overcooked, even for 'well done'. The second time i went, the food was okay... and this last time i went, i got lukewarm fries that tasted like they'd been out for a while."
Pamela M.,"Medford, MA",0,1,,1.0,1/4/2014,Horrible food horrible service.  Had the Mac and cheese with chicken.  The chicken was bad tasted like it had been frozen for way to long before cooked.  A frozen dinner would of been better.  Should of know the food was horrible when a delivery guy showed up from another place delivering food for the staff.
Patrick C.,"Lynn, MA",5,34,5,1.0,9/3/2013,"1 star because I can't give 0.  First tried to dine at Applebees in Malden, but they are closed down.  Woburn not doing so good either.  Dined on 8/31/13.  Hostess sat us and waited on us because others were nowhere to be found.  She brought drinks and a server brought food.  No silverware was brought over.  Even another waitress passed by and ignored us.  Not going there again."
Frank L.,"Danvers, MA",18,27,2,2.0,9/17/2013,"Went in for lunch and got one of the signature combos with Oriental chicken salad and Blackened shrimp pasta. Not awful, not great just blah. The pasta was overcooked, the shrimp smelled and tasted of the freezer and the salad was ok but you could count the chicken pieces on it with one hand. For fuel it is OK but not up to par of other Applebees in my opinion. On a pleasant note, the server was delightful, friendly and competent so I will come back for a drink at least."
Susan D.,"Pasadena, CA",108,494,38,2.0,9/16/2009,"First off, I am laughing to myself because the photo associated to this restaurant is inaccurate. Anyways I tried the 2 for $20 deal, which was uninspiring and just lame. The waitstaff was nice. The spinach dip appetizer was okay with really thin sad chips. My fried shrimp were puny cardboard breaded ""seafood"". And I didn't even want to try my hubby's chicken and rice dish. Nothing was particularly bad with my experience. It was just not that great either."
Katie C.,"Winchester, MA",3,43,,1.0,1/1/2011,"Tried to go here on Thursday but after it took them over 20 minutes just to get our drinks, we said "" NO WAY!"" and left. Seriously, over 20 minutes just for drinks. I understand they get busy but for drinks! So we watched the waiter completely ignore our drinks sitting on the bar for over 10 minutes before an assistant manager went over and grabbed them and covered the waiters butt and finally gave them to us. It was probably about 25 minutes for a jack and coke and a sangria. I was not appreciative of my drink being abandoned at the bar unattended for over 10 minutes. I mean Im sure there aren't rapists in Applebee's but still its not a safe practice. Save your money and your time and go somewhere else.  When the waiter finally came over to us, no apology, nothing (literally about 30 minutes later). the waiter was frazzled. Then we had to get change, but he was too busy to take it. So we found an assistant manager nearby because we were sick of waiting and when she came back with our change 5 minutes later  we told the assistant manager that we weren't eating because of the ridiculous wait for just the drinks, She offered to take our order but we were over it. This isn't the first time the wait has been ridiculous here, and the food isn't anything amazing anyways. Not going back again. Seriously, know your busy hours and get sufficient help.very insulting to get treated that way."
David C.,"Woburn, MA",14,29,4,1.0,6/25/2010,"So you know the drill-saw the add got seduced by a specifically yummy looking burger,,,,, So in we go, and the place is not really that busy.  Couple big groups drinking these particularly wild ""Budzillas,"" which are these huge 128 ounce containers of Bud or Bud Light for $19.99 3 person minimum- but I digress. We ordered an appetizer, Queso with Tortilla chips and the aforementioned Philly Cheese Burgers we came in for. The we sat and waited and waited and waited.  Eventually our waitress made an appearance, and when she inquired about our appetizer, she having a brief moment of clarity announced. ""OOPS, I guess I forgot to put it in-and smirked like it was the most humorous thing that happened to her in a month! She then without feeling the need for an apology slid into another brilliant move, ""Do you still want it?"" We told her we did so she assured us it would only take a few seconds (25 more minutes, and don't you know the Burgers came within seconds of her leaving.  The burgers were good- the Queso for all the work was metsa- metsa  (melted cheeze wiz and Rotele.)  Not one more mention or apology about her slip up.  Lori Paid the tab and gave her a 10% tip- I would have given her a dime myself."
