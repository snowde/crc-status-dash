Eric M.,"Woodbridge, VA",1,70,24,5.0,6/24/2012,This is a nice place. I went there two weekends in a row. The service was good both times and the food was good too. I recommend trying it out.
Amy G.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,38,4,5.0,3/18/2012,"I love this Applebees. It's one of our favorite places to go out. Always good food, great service, friendly atmosphere & pretty fast service. Can't get any better than that. They really know how to take care of their customers. They want you to be happy. You feel welcome here & taken care of. That makes you want to come back. Many other places don't get that & don't put much effort into customer service. Applebees gets it. I for one, appreciate it & will keep coming back. Especially for those boneless buffalo wings!! Yum!! The quesadilla burger is awesome too. Oh, and the lime chicken. I could go on..... Try it for yourself. Good food. Good service. A+"
Mae B.,"Tucson, AZ",1,32,,5.0,11/11/2011,I came here for the very first time and it was a wonderful experience. Mike was our waiter and he was just so attentive. EverythingI could wish for a server. He is amazing and will totally come back in this Applebees.
Kristin A.,"Alexandria, VA",277,227,518,3.0,9/22/2012,"I was looking forward to enjoying a parmesan shrimp steak. However, once it arrived that enthusiasm to eat it quickly left. Seems as if they have a gnat infestation. Every 5-7 seconds we had to fan our food and try to swat the gnats away. After about 15 minutes of doing so I explained the situation to my waiter. I guess he hadn't noticed the fanning/swatting; but he said that he'd get the manager. Not that i was looking for a discount but seeing as though he knew of the said infestation, he'd grant one. Lets just say that w not the case. Not only did my table complain, but so did the table in front of us. The manager simply stated that the restaurant had undergone a treatment. If the case is that the gnats are back maybe they should rope off the area. I gave one star because at least they have free internet (which is allowing me to submit this review). The table in front of us got a discount and our waiter told us that the manager granted one for us as well.  This review started out as 1 star but since everything was handled eventually and our waiter was GREAT ( even offering us fee dessert) 3 stars it is."
Matthew M.,"Dumfries, VA",0,22,3,1.0,2/5/2012,"Something's got to be going on here underneath the surface, but I'm not sure what it is.  I've noticed that the management has changed over about 3 times in the last year or so, and on various visits service has fluctuated from ""OK"" to really just ""not good,"" most experiences being not so good.  The reason I kept going back is because I really do want to like this place, it's just going to be really difficult to do now, moving forward, until they can sort out whatever ""it"" is that's causing the consistency and service problems."
Jason K.,"Henderson, NV",0,13,1,2.0,6/12/2012,"I went my here with my wife last Saturday night after a ball game. It was also graduation night for several local high schools. It was about 10:50 pm when we walked in, (they are open till 12am) and there was a line of people. We were told by the ""Host"" it would be about a 20 min wait and when we said okay, he changed the wait time to maybe 30-40 min. I seen that there was an NBA game on about to end and decided to wait, knowing it would clear out soon. It kind of felt to me he was trying to scare us off with his inflated wait time. A few min later we over heard him telling the big group ahead of us that IHOP was open 24 hours, and explaining how long the process of cleaning up when the tables leave is going to take; again trying to scare off guests.  We were seated like I thought after about 15 min and were seated right next to the hostess desk upfront. The host didn't realize we could hear him or just didn't care, but we listened as he took cell-phone calls and talked with other staff about how irritated he was (using profanity)  that people kept coming in. He was supposed to be able to leave at 11 if they weren't busy and this was ruining his night. We watched as he told new customers that walked in that they would have to wait 30-45 min; and there wasn't even a line. I counted at least 8 people the scared away.  I've never felt more unwelcome at a restaurant and will not go back here anywhere near closing time again. Very unprofessional."
Mizz P.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,2,,2.0,3/18/2012,The quality of this place is going down...my food came out incorrectly and the service was sub par. It seemed like there was not enough staff even for the minimal amount of patrons. Then trying to watch a basketball game and 60 minutes is blasting over the speaker system and no one seemed to know how to change the station. I thought they were under new management but it seems that they have once again gone down hill.....not going back!
