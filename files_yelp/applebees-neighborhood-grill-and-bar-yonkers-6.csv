Leruffo ..,"New York, NY",1,3,14,5.0,9/30/2017,Excelent food and fresh and good service fresh chicken n salada and cheese  ill be back
Lee S.,"New York, NY",17,11,30,2.0,8/12/2017,Food is usually just average!! I could have gotten a better burger and Fries at Five Guys!!!  The so called mozzarella burger was garbage; And the garden salad was old and worn!!! Who the hell wants to eat food like that???  Do better man! Even the service at the restaurant is lacking!! Smh!!
Sophia D.,"Santa Barbara, CA",484,105,121,4.0,6/19/2017,"Good, cheap decent food. They have a 2 for $20 or $27 for better entree choices. Service was okay and food was delivered in a timely matter."
Mommy C.,"Yonkers, NY",0,15,1,2.0,12/17/2017,"I understand during the holidays restaurants can get completely overwhelmed and busy however a sorry can take things a long way and some of the servers at this location should learn how to use the word sorry, especially when they mess up the order 3x instead of having a nasty attitude and the managerial staff should do something about it as well. The wait is usually rather quick being that there's a bunch of new restaurants in the vicinity however during holidays you might wake up to a 15 to 25 minute wait."
Steve M.,"Bronx, NY",0,4,5,1.0,5/29/2017,"Bad even for applebees. Inattentive staff. An old man fell right in front of the greeting staff and they just looked at him. They didn't even walk over the one foot where he fell from them. Patrons were the ones who assisted helping the elderly gentleman to his feet and walking him to his table.  Food- order was wrong. The waitress stated that we ordered four meals when there was ONLY 3 PEOPLE sitting at the table, insisting that we ordered two sirloin stir fry meals (in retrospect I wished I ordered zero.) Hmmmm. Then they also tried to partially charge us for the additional meal, insisting that their math was more accurate than my wife's (who has a PhD)! Way to go Applebee's, we'll never be back."
Kenny V.,"Bronx, New York, NY",1,9,19,4.0,3/13/2017,I only come for happy hour (1/2 price on appetizers and $5/$4 beers). I would never pay full price for apple bees.
Jalissa S.,"Bronx, NY",1,12,5,3.0,9/2/2017,"It's a hit or miss with this applebees , depending who's cooking your food but overall it's okay."
Neal E.,"Fayetteville, NY",1,51,1,1.0,12/5/2016,"Bad even for applebees. Inattentive staff. I sat at the bar, 4 other customers, and waited and waited. Food- order was wrong and their offer of how to fix it did not once involve getting me the ACTUAL FOOD I ORDERED. Bun was stale. Beer selection was awful. Sweet potato fries were ok until i found the eyelash on the bottom."
Diana L.,"Bronx, NY",0,8,,4.0,7/12/2017,"Wednesday early evening is a great time to go.  Not crowded . Our server was very attentive, courteous and professional. We tried the 2 for $20.  It was well worth it. We shared the mozzarella sticks and each had a bacon cheeseburger with fries. Done perfectly as we requested.    Had the Wednesday- special Apple Sangria- large goblet.  Very tasty.  Food served in a timely manner.   Would have been 5 Stars except for these 2 comments.  The carpets need cleaning, noticed order upon entering. Our food could have been hotter."
John C.,"Yonkers, NY",118,16,23,2.0,8/1/2016,"Service sucked. Very inattentive. Had to ask for napkins. Had to ask for more water. Had to ask for a knife to cut a chicken breast.  It never fails. Every time I give Applebee's a chance, despite the location.....it is ghetto. We were sat next to a couple with a baby. The mother kept cursing at, what I believe to be the father. She had no shame that there were other patrons or that her daughter was present. Smh. The severs tend to be all bunched together having conversations instead of taking care of their customers.  It will be a long time until I come back again."
Melissa C.,"New York, NY",0,7,,1.0,8/18/2017,"Applebee's is not anything special but it totally sucks to find a curly black hair in your mash potatoes! The waitress couldn't careless about issue but Im not surprised by her attitude since the hostess seemed bother that we even asked for a table when we arrived! They better straighten up, theres way too many nearby restaurants for them to act like they dont want to service people!"
Loreyda S.,"Bronx, NY",59,3,,1.0,1/24/2017,Horrible service. Wanted to change my wings b2cause they were too expansive with naeehma and was not able to exchange it. Although I had just had a bite. She looked at me and told me u order mild. And although I ask if it could be possible to make an exception. They couldn't help
Gerardo A.,"New York, NY",567,451,1765,1.0,4/1/2014,"#38 I am not a big fun of applebee the reason is I do not like the food or apps or anything here so I don't expect much. Just go in, order some food, get it, eat it, and leave. I Came with two friends for the 2 for $20  is  a good deal, but not good food, me and my friends share the apps: The SPINACH & ARTICHOKE DIP a  warm crock of creamy spinach, tender artichokes, and melted Asiago and Parmesan cheeses, with freshly-made Spicy Chipotle Lime Salsa and tortilla chips. The sauce was good, but the chips was very greasy. The BONELESS Wings Lightly breaded, tender chunks of boneless chicken with hot sauce (that was not hot an all) was very good. But how can you wreck wings.  The entree 7OZ. HOUSE SIRLOIN A petite version of their classic sirloin. Served with seasonal vegetables and mashed potatoes. Worst steak that have taste in my life. I will not come here  never again."
Lisa S.,"Yonkers, NY",1,10,,1.0,6/23/2017,My mom took my kids here to celebrate them have a great school year and well lets just say she should've taken them else where! The wait was well over 45 minutes without so much as an apology or explanation! When they were FINALLY seated the server took another 15 to come and ask for their drink order she tried to give our order at the same time and the server said I can only do one thing at a time! :O! Ya I know it just kept getting better! The ONLY reason they didn't leave is because the kids all had swim class later so they didn't have time to go anywhere else but WE will NEVER be going back to that Applebee's! We have enjoyed lunch here before but that was in the middle of a work day when it wasn't so busy. You would think that at the beginning of the summer season these people would have their game faces on well THEY DON'T!!! So unless you have PLENTY of time to wait DO NOT GO TO APPLEBEE'S in Cross County!!!
Jasmine J.,"East Bronx, NY",1,13,4,4.0,9/29/2016,"I went on a Friday night, the waitress was great and upbeat. My family and I were seated quickly.  Food was good, just wish my medium steak was a bit more tender and not fatty like. We visit frequently and the food is always satisfying; sangrías are alright, not strong enough."
Andrea M.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,10,,2.0,8/14/2016,"I went to Applebee's on a Saturday evening, this one it wasn't that busy.  We were seated but it took forever for a server to come to our table and order a drink, when we ordered our drinks it took even longer for our drinks to come to the table. I thought our server was okay but I couldn't help but observe the section I was in as I'm in the bar/restaurant industry for over 10years.  I noticed some of the tables next to us customers were getting a bit annoyed how slow the service was, food being delivered at the wrong tables, customers waving down for a server and no one paying any attention, I saw a table get up and walk out because the service was awful.  The manager didn't look like he knew what he was doing.  I saw servers at the back talking and laughing amongst themselves and the hostesses having a full blown conversation with each other, Hello?? So you are going to work just to hangout, but not doing your job?? Nobody seems to delegate and figure out where the weaknesses are and help each other out, teamwork?? I am absolutely horrified, I cringed because it's so hard for me to observe all this, No good work ethnic at all in this place.   This Applebee's location needs to stop employing incompetent lazy staff."
Tara M.,"Paterson, NJ",5,14,11,1.0,12/24/2015,"If there could be 0 * I would 15min for a spoon for soup, that was thrown almost in my lap. Spinach dip was  cold and the chips stale. Waiter was polite but the service has been dissatisfied. Thankfully I only ordered the appetizers not full entrees  ... It panera was open I would've defiantly went there"
Rob R.,"Bronx, NY",0,8,4,1.0,5/23/2016,The place is under staffed. They will make excuses with them being short handed. Food is over priced and not cooked well. Skip this place
Shirley R.,"Bronx, NY",1,3,,1.0,6/18/2016,"Talk about disgusting service, this Applebee's is the worse restaurant I have ever visited. Please do not come here take your money somewhere else."
Fordmustanglover 2.,"New York, NY",0,39,129,3.0,10/16/2016,A very nice Applebee's. Not too shabby. A little bit on the expensive side but the food is very good. The food took 15 minutes to come out but it's ok. The bathrooms do smell bad like a dirty ocean and the sinks are all messed up but its because they are renovating the bathrooms. Other than that a very nice experience.
David J.,"Leonia, NJ",0,4,,1.0,5/15/2016,"The service is very poor. Some of the waitresses exhibit a bad attitude.  A drink was brought to me with a lipstick imprint. It also had an unknown particle in it that was not part of the drink.  No one apologized, I only got attitude when i called it out."
J L.,"Bronx, NY",2,7,1,1.0,7/13/2016,If I can give this place no stars I would. We ordered two takeout salads bc we needed a quick dinner. My bf ordered the Southwest Steak salad and I had the fiesta chopped chicken salad. We asked for the dressing to be on the side for both. We get home and my salad is drowning in dressing and my bfs salad had steak and lettuce...nothing else!  We called the story and the manager argued with us over the logistics of what is and isn't in the salad instead of remedying the situation. Other than the bartender there...this place is terrible!!! Put your money to better use and eat somewhere else!!!
Allison B.,"Bronx, NY",149,105,337,1.0,2/5/2015,"I forgot that I drafted this review....thats how lack luster my experience was at this Applebee's. Because of the convenience of its location and huge parking lot, my boyfriend, his daughter, his sister and I decided to go there to eat. I rather like Applebee's and was excited to order chicken wontons. We got there and were sat super quickly. I told the hostess that we would need a high chair and one was delivered right away. We were placed in the bar area which seemed strange because we had a baby but it was a good size booth so we mad due.  Then we waited...and waited. It took another ten minutes for a waiter to come over and introduce herself. By this time, I had already hopped on yelp and checked in. And when I did I wanted to get up and leave. The reviews were horrible. All about long waits and poor service. This was not looking good.  JJ was our waitress friendly but she didn't tell us or offer us any specials. I do not like that at all. I still to this day don't know if there were specials going on that night. WE were going to ask her when she came back to check on us but because she took so long, we forgot.  We started off ordering beverages. When my boyfriend asked her about the type of whiskeys they had she only could name Jack Daniels. I do not understand. And instead of saying that she would go check, she stood there. Ok we'll move on them. We ordered a jack and diet coke, blue moon, coca cola and pineapple juice. Ten minutes later, the drinks started to come. No they didn't come all at once. They came one at a time. With minutes in between each delivery.  Not a fan. Thank goodness we ordered our food with our beverages because we really didn't see JJ again for another 15 minutes. By that time I had to flag someone else over for silverware. We ordered boneless buffalo wings, plain wings with oney mustard, mozzarella sticks, hot wings, and a steak dinner (medium well). We said to bring out all the apps and then the steak right away (because we knew that would take longer). And it did...take longer. I'm sure she forgot about.  The wings orders were wrong and needed to be fixed. The steak was more medium than medium well but my boyfriend was so hungry he ate what he could and left it. We all pretty much left the food there. No one was thrilled with their order. The reviews are right. This place is not the place to go. I think their poor service comes from thinking people are going to show up anyway, they're in a shopping mall. I can't I wont again."
Barbara R.,"Yonkers, NY",25,11,,1.0,9/27/2016,"I found out that Applebees is franchised out and corporate doesn't give a rats ass what individual owners are doing with their Applebees. It's really a gross place, and we will not go there again. The waitress said, ""Yo I'll hook you up with the bartender, how low life is that? The poor Asian kid, the other server couldn't get hooked up with the bartender, awe, we felt bad for him. We saw enough, we'll find somewhere else to go that we don't have to get hooked up. I think that is so low life. I think, if I come to a bar restaurant during Happy Hour, and the server has to tell me that they'll hook me up, I'm done. It's Happy Hour we should be ""hooked up"" automatically. Honestly, the people that work at Applebees should have some control and self respect? I think proper ethic training would help. This is complete ""Poor Management."" You walk in these restaurants today and you have to be prepared to walk out and go home and cook and make your own cocktails. The world has become a cesspool."
Mike J.,"Yonkers, NY",274,38,89,4.0,9/11/2014,Best boneless wings
Elvis T.,"New York, NY",278,32,19,3.0,6/22/2014,Service isn't that great is started from the host calling other people with the number of parties. Happy was good and the food came out fast. For happy hour you had to sit at the bar only on Sundays but apparently you still have happy hour at other tables just not on Sundays.
Renita S.,"Yonkers, NY",0,2,,1.0,1/30/2015,"Normally, I can enjoy Applebee's but who the hell has discontinued  GUACAMOLE!!!!!!! I've  never heard  of anything so STUPID!!! I ordered  Quesadilla.......WTH!! Did you just tell  me that you have NO GUACAMOLE on the premises.  That's just crazy!!! Then stop serving  anything that one would want to put GUACAMOLE on. To top it off, you give even the tiniest portions of sour caem and salsa....shouldn't we get larger portions to make up for the fact that you have NO GUACAMOLE.  Bye Applebee's!! You now OFFICIALLY SUCK...."
R V.,"Mount Vernon, NY",0,8,2,1.0,4/6/2016,"To begin, Applebee's was one of my favorite places to eat especially with my family. However, during recent visits, it has been a horrible experience. Today I order an oriental salad over the phone for pick up, give it about 20 mins and once inside I still had to wait another 15 mins. Working in the food industry myself I don't find the wait time acceptable. Especially with an order placed over the phone. This location has been so inconsistent that the general manager previously gave me his business card with a free meal because it had been the third time my meal wasn't correct . Then, as I was waiting for my order,  Zachary (an employee )came across money on the floor picked it up and placed it in his wallet without hesitation or at least asking around before taking it . That type of behavior is appalling and I'm certain that doesn't align  with Applebee's code of conduct. Lastly, Franci D , attire was incredibly inappropriate she had on a tank top with an incredibly low neckline. Due to these series's of events I will no longer spend any of my money or time at any Applebee's location."
Julie G.,"Bronx, NY",0,7,,4.0,10/30/2015,"I must say that this was one of the better experiences I've had at any Applebee's.  The food came in a short time and the service was okay.  I ordered the three appetizers combo with sweet potato fries, nachos, and wings.  All of them were very good and tasted freshly made.  What dampened my experience was the cleanliness of the bathroom sink handles.  Feeling the crud from someone else's hand when I turned on the faucet was disgusting."
Jimmy C.,"Yonkers, NY",2,36,199,3.0,11/26/2012,"I think they are doing better here.  I had a basically good experience on ""Black Friday."" Although I got a table quickly, the place filled up rapidly after that. This restaurant is almost ALWAYS busy, and half the staff & customers often seemed pissed off, 'cause it's in the shopping center and it's kinda small and it's noisy. The service was good. You have to be prepared for many different waiters, like, surprising you with the different parts of your meal, but, other than that, you should be okay. My bloody Mary ($7.15) was VERY good. The nachos were a good deal at $5.25. The chicken with portobello mushrooms and 'taters ($10) and steak with parmesan shrimp and garlic mashies ($22) were basically good.  But I later noticed that my cup of coffee was $3! Yikes!"
Shasell N.,"Danbury, CT",64,16,14,1.0,5/13/2015,"Slow, slow and slow. It's a overpriced fast food restaurant. Stop in because I was shopping in the area, needless to say I will never return. McDonald has better and fresher food. How sad!"
Kiera C.,"Ridgewood, NY",11,12,,1.0,5/4/2015,"""Lunch"" took 25 minutes to arrive. My sisters ""well done"" burger was well in the middle and pink on the outside, which means it was cooked in the microwave. My ""shaved turkey"" sandwich was a hock of turkey that looked so unappetizing I sent it back. I will not be back, I'll go over to longhorn across the parking lot instead."
Paola W.,"Danbury, CT",152,130,922,1.0,11/5/2014,Horrible service during lunch. Took forever to get our meals and the place wasn't busy. The waitress was not so great. And the food was definitely not worth the wait. Don't think I'll be coming here again.
Sean L.,"Yonkers, NY",0,17,22,1.0,10/16/2014,"What a s**thole. Seriously,  I wish I had the yelp app when I stopped coming here, the service is always terrible, and is a real disappointment to the franchise,  I NEVER come to this location for that particular reason, I've always waited an unreasonable amount of time and the orders are never right, on top of that the overall attitude of (almost) everyone that works there just sucks in general. I wish more people would comment because it either needs a change in management or should be shut down. You're better off going to Burger King."
K Lo ..,"New York, NY",2,56,,1.0,12/12/2013,"If Applebees is so bad, they will have to close this joint down soon. The starters had clumps of seasoning on it, thrown all over the plate. When questioned, the server told us that is the way it is served. (RUDE!) And then the drink was so watered down, we might as well have gotten just water. Would not recommend this place to anyone, nor would go here again."
Aimal F.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,5,,3.0,11/22/2013,"This was my first time trying out Applebee's. I was seated extremely quickly, and was served quickly as well. The service was not exemplary, but it wasn't bad either, contrary to most reviews.  Ordered the Mozzarella sticks and Creamy Chicken Parmesan. The chicken was not as hot as I would have hoped, but other than that, the taste was pretty good. However, the quantity is not worth the high prices. I was probably 30% less hungry than I was when I walked in but that was about it. Overall, I don't think I'll be going there again. I can't afford to be hungry after paying almost $27 for a meal."
AnnMarie N.,"Yonkers, NY",2,42,1,1.0,10/20/2015,"Atrocious. Beer was served lukewarm, missing orange garnish and took about 25 mins (after waiting 20 minutes just to order).. I know it's a chain restaurant and this isn't expertly crafted cuisine but good god they don't even try to hide the fact that it's not freshly prepared, probably just defrosted in a microwave. Couldn't pay me to go back."
Beth R.,"Astoria, NY",153,114,2,1.0,3/27/2013,"Atrocious service. Sat at the bar for lunch on Saturday. There was only one bartender; she could barely keep up with the drink orders for the wait staff (for their tables), much less provide us with adequate service, despite the fact that she was quick. She appeared to be the only employee doing any work in the packed establishment. It was March Madness, with 2 NCAA basketball games being televised at the time, and yet neither was being shown on any of the ~10 sets in the bar. But CNN without closed captioning was on one, some random minor league soccer summary was on another, and the NIT basketball game was on all 4 sets behind the bar. I ordered a SkinnyBee margarita. It is tiny, too sweet, not fresh tasting and overpriced. Next I ordered a vodka soda. One sip revealed there was no carbonation in the soda. I understand there are often mechanical problems in bars/restaurants. But it took about 10 minutes to get the bartender's attention to notify her. She made me a new drink using a different soda line, and it was fine. I ordered the Zesty Roma Chicken & Shrimp, which was actually quite tasty, especially considering it is under 550 calories, but then again I was starving by the time it actually arrived. Oh, and then I had to stare at and smell it for over 5 minutes without silverware; I couldn't get the attention of the bartender or even any of the employees as they passed by! My friend finally just got up and grabbed a set for me from the end of the bar. I was surprised the food was lukewarm (and not completely cold) by that point. No one ever followed up with me to ask how the food was. By the time we finally got the bartender's attention again, we requested the check, didn't argue that there was no comp on my botched vodka soda and left as fast as we could. Applebee's, there are a lot of people looking for work in this economy. You should be able to find and hire some people who actually WANT to work!"
Patrick R.,"Stratford, CT",169,551,2103,3.0,4/26/2010,"On our way back from Newark, NJ hitting some mad traffic. We just had a 7hr long meeting, and were not in te mood to be stuck in traffic for another 3. So we kinda ended up here for no other reason than killing time and get some grub. The establishment was busy and the Yankees played the Red Sox. We were seated promptly and it did not take long before our waiter took our orders. We went for the $26 for two deal; the boneless buffalo wings, 9oz. Sirloin and the grilled shrimp spinach salad. The food was alright, however the spinach salad was not... a bunch of dry leaves with some grilled shrimps... very disappointing."
Melissa B.,"Yonkers, NY",36,1,,2.0,10/10/2015,All I have to say is that Marlen took my food away before I was even done. It seemed like she was in a hurry
