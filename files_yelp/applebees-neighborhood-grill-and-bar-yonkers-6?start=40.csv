Erica M.,"Bronx, NY",0,16,,2.0,1/4/2014,"We decided to come here for a late lunch the other day with the kids. The waitress took about 10 minutes to come to our table, seemed distracted taking our orders, didnt bring the drinks until 5 minutes after taking our food order. I guess I didnt expect such slow service when the place wasnt even packed. The wait staff definitely needs training. While we were waiting, one dropped 2 plates of food from another table and when our food was brought out, the guy handed it to us on the opposite side of the table so we had to reach over the kids to get it. He could have easily taken a few more steps to go around to our side. Thank God it didnt fall on top of them since the plates were extremely hot and I burned my finger grabbing it. Highly doubt I will come here again. Other than the service, the food was very good."
Kanika D.,"Yonkers, NY",0,4,,1.0,7/28/2014,Service was horrible waited for our plates for almost 30 mins the waitress was flirting with guys the hostess wasnt even seating people and the food made me feel sick not returning there again just the worst
Brigette F.,"Bronxville, NY",0,6,4,3.0,7/22/2014,They are not bad. Service is ok and the food is also okay. Their food and drink prices are reasonable .this place is good for a quick grub and head out. Not the best place to go out on a date or to just chill at a place and hAve fun because they are a bit slow.
Sean D.,"Manhattan, NY",191,11,16,1.0,2/16/2011,"Where do I begin....? Ok the first time I went to this Applebees...I was on my first date with my wife and the waiter hit on me all night... Food was far below standard....the next time I went....I was invisible!!! It took forever to order, it took forever to ask for more water, it took forever to get the check, and it took forever to get my debit card back...When I left I was pissed!!! The last time I went, I thought to myself...hmmmm maybe it was me, maybe im trippen...sure enough...same ol zebra still has the same ol strips...and im done!!! DO NOT GO HERE....YOU WILL LEAVE PISSED!!!"
Emma O.,"New York, NY",0,3,,1.0,4/21/2014,"Worst service EVER!!!! As a waitress I know how important it is to be nice to customers and attentive to their needs, this did not happen here.. Waited 20 mins on bottles of beer and for our food order to be taken. Then waited 40 mins for entrees with no apology. We ordered a 2 nd round of drinks from a different waitress as we didn't see our waitress for 30 mins.. All round a bad service experience with no explanation or apology for the wait. Zero tip and we won't be back."
Nicole H.,"Mt Vernon, NY",44,44,29,2.0,8/18/2013,"Just walked out. Service was taking too long for breakfast. I had to seat myself, and still wasn't greeted after 10+minutes. I went next door to Panera for better service."
Danny N.,"Jersey City, NJ",17,199,7,2.0,12/4/2010,"Service at this Applebee's is definitely lacking. You can be seated and wait for years before a server comes around. I gave up after finding myself really thirsty so I just got up and went to sit at the bar. One of the things that irks me about this place is that the bartending staff constantly are more focused on doing side work even if it's an hour or two from closing than from paying attention to you. Service is still spotty even at the bar. Note that the times I've been here the place isn't exactly packed either. So yes, they may serve the same food as other Applebee's but don't come here expecting decent service."
Edgar S.,"Bronx, NY",98,556,145,2.0,10/17/2010,"Looking for a quick dinner after a long day of shopping, we decided on Applebees. You usually don't go wrong with franchise food and drinks.  After being told the wait for 3 would be 20 minutes, we decided to wait it out. Almost an hour later, we finally sat. Our waiter took 10 minutes to take our order.  The food and drink order wasgiven  simple and fast. I ordered a margarita with no salt. Simple right? Apparently not. Dude arrives with my ""margarita"" in a martini glass with an olive floating inside. Now I gave them the benefit of the doubt, maybe they ran out of glasses, it was packed.....but an olive inside...cmon! It tasted like margarita mix with no tequila. Nyquil tastes better.  The food was good, but apparently the bartender needs to go back to bartending school."
Izzi M.,"Bronx, NY",1,11,,1.0,11/16/2014,"We literally just walked out of this Applebee's because our server not only implied we were fat but then kept insisting we needed a larger booth to ""be more comfortable"". We were perfectly comfortable in our current booth."
LISA N.,"New York, NY",853,381,281,2.0,5/19/2010,"The outside of the mall is being rebuilt, looks great. Inside is still the same ol' shenanigans and probably the same type of service as the movie ""waiting"".  No one is really paying attention to you and yet they're all flirting with each other.   I asked for a water 4 times, 3 times from my waiter and once from another.  NEVER GOT IT.   I had no knives, napkins, fork set.  Everytime I try to get service they would look down and run the other way. And I ordered a beer in the beginning, and wanted another one.  I HAD TO WAVE THEM DOWN FROM ACROSS THE ROOM AND OUR WAITER DID A HAND GESTURE SAYING ""One more??""   But the chipotle jalapeno burger hit the spot. 2 stars."
Lisa B.,"Bronx, NY",17,70,7,4.0,11/9/2012,I really like this place and probably the only Applebee's I've only like. Food is good and the service at the bar is great.
Luz M.,"Yonkers, NY",1,4,,1.0,11/19/2011,"You know what you're in for when you go to Applebees - cheap food, edible, a little something for everyone.   We hoped that the brand new Applebees at the Cross County Mall would be an easy stop for lunch with our two little kids.  An hour after ordering, not a speck of food arrived at our table.  After inquiring they brought chocolate milk for the kids...a while later their food arrived with some, not all, of the adult appetizers, lukewarm.  The entrees were clearly going to be another half hour.  It was totally depressing.   It's one thing to stop in for quick ""average food,"" but to waste the whole afternoon waiting for average food makes you feel like an idiot.  The waitress said, ""We're sorry, we got swamped.""  Isn't that their business model?  Never, ever again."
Alexandria B.,"Bronx, NY",54,17,18,1.0,3/1/2011,I so dislike this Applebee. The service is trash. My husband and I went there for our first date. It was ok beside the fact the waiter was kicking it to my husband. The other time we went I was pregnant. The waiter ignored us. I would never go back there if it was only place left on the planet.
Stella D.,"Yonkers, NY",0,1,,2.0,4/26/2011,The service wasn't great and I'm not really liking the new decor.
Annie Y.,"Bronx, NY",62,182,23,3.0,12/2/2007,Sat at the bar with my 2 friends.  Bartender was really nice.  Made our drinks which were really good actually surprisingly not watered down.  Our fries never came so we asked and it was on the house.  Wow that was nice.  Finally got our table a half hour later.  Waiter was also awesome and friendly.  However mishap at the kitchen so our artichoke spinach dip was on the house too.  Even better!  I enjoyed the the 11.99 triple meal deal w. the mini cheeseburgers and honey boneless chicken bites.  Those were good.  It's a good place to chill a bit if you're waiting for the movies nearby.
