Anne J.,"New York, NY",29,8,5,5.0,12/9/2017,"We were here when the manager refused to serve alcohol to the party group with the ugly sweaters and blinking lights! No racism was shown' first of all when we walked in a mixed gay couple were seated enjoying drinks! Another family of Hispanics also came in! 1) the girl said at the bar ""I'm here to party"" 2) we were enjoying beers and sandwiches.  Highly recommend both food and the service was bar none the best we have had.  3)the manager offered to let them order food and have non alcoholic beverages!!!        -- thank you management for keeping us safe as we head back to New Jersey with 5 less drunks on the road."
Jessica P.,"Phoenixville, PA",0,3,,4.0,11/18/2017,"Love, love, love this place. Boneless wings are addicting and the pizzookies are absolutely, positively one of the best food inventions ever. The atmosphere and decor are perfect. However, it's the friendly service and peach berry tea that keeps me coming back time and time again.  My one and only complaint at this time is the floor.  I have almost fallen on my behind probably every single time I've been there. No matter what kind of shoes I wear - sneakers, boots, flats - I feel like I'm ice skating my way to my table or the bathroom."
Ben P.,"Douglassville, PA",14,8,6,2.0,10/18/2017,"Got the chicken alfredo lunch special, the chicken was overcooked and dry, the pasta was far too undercooked. Didnt even eat half and didnt want to eat anymore. Prices are also expensive for what you get, wont be going back. Only decent thing was the service, the waitress was attentive."
Steve I.,"Wynnewood, PA",55,244,1473,4.0,7/1/2017,"Enjoyed my lunch with friends here today. Place was packed but we were promptly seated and our order was quickly taken. Our drinks were promptly delivered. I liked the taste of the beers in my flight, each beer clearly identified.            Everyone enjoyed the food that they ordered. I had the ribeye steak which was cooked perfectly medium and the great sides that I picked from a huge selection, the golden roasted beets with feta and the couscous Mac and cheese made with large Israeli couscous were absolutely delicious. My wife had the chicken blt with avocado with came with crispy French fries. She cleaned her plate which is an excellent indicator that it was good.                My friend really liked his huge pulled pork sandwich which came with a side of slaw and more of those delicious fries. The server was friendly, knowledgeable and quick. Will stop back for sure when in the area."
Becky D.,"Reading, PA",131,244,370,3.0,8/30/2017,"My husband and I stopped here after coming home from NY. We've driven by it before and decided we should try it out. It was fairly busy when we stopped on a Saturday during lunch. However, we just took a seat at the bar.  The menu.. is huge. Actually I find it to be a little extensive and all over the place with what they're trying to be. However, our food was good. I ordered tacos but they literally kept falling apart.  The beer... is awesome! I did a flight of their beers which was excellent. However, my husband ordered a beer that wound up kicking 3/4 of the way. If it weren't for the manager, I think the girl would have charged us. No joke.  The staff... I've had better. There were two bartenders on at the time. The girl was literally on her phone the entire time. She barely refilled drinks or checked on us. He guy never once came over for anything. I'm not sure if they work together or take turns having guests. We felt as if we were inconveniencing them, especially the girl. When she did wait on us she was nice but kind of felt forced. The manager was nice however and seemed very hands on. It's always good to see that in a restaurant.  I'll definitely give it another whirl but maybe just grab a table."
Amanda K.,"Hoboken, NJ",100,128,26,3.0,10/20/2017,Beers were great and so was the service.  Food is exactly what you'd expect from a chain restaurant so please don't go there with your expectations set too high. We may come back for the apps but definitely won't be doing entrees.
Nicole M.,"East Brunswick, NJ",84,91,12,4.0,10/13/2017,"I am in the Allentown area for work and was excited to learn that there was a BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse here as I have been to one in Florida before and loved it. I had the Thursday rib special, which included a half rack of ribs, a salad, two sides, and a mini pizookie, all for $15! The food was delicious, as well as the atmosphere. Definitely a great place for a nice, inexpensive dinner!"
Angelina E.,"New York, NY",338,166,375,3.0,6/4/2017,"The service was good. The atmosphere was nice. I especially like their brand sodas. The artichoke dip was perfect.  All the other food we had was mediocre. Biggest call out - Stale bread for the burgers. Otherwise I would have given them 4 stars.  Rib eye steak was well cooked. Definitely come again, but not for the burgers."
Candi K.,"Allentown, PA",289,709,53,4.0,12/5/2017,"My daughter outgrew her milk allergy, so this momma now gets to eat whatever she wants, which means I'm now a fan of BJs!  I've actually had the ribs again at dinner (it's their special on Thursdays) and they are particularly delicious when paired with mashed potatoes.  Some of the sandwiches are amazing as well!  They are so good with kids...plenty of high chairs & they offer a little ""appetizer"" for them (fresh fruit & maybe a piece of bread?) to keep the kiddos occupied.  Plus it's loud enough that no one cares if they are loud :)  Add some great service and it's definitely on our sit down dinner list when we have a chance to get out!"
Cody V.,"Fogelsville, PA",0,29,13,1.0,9/9/2017,"It gets shittier and shittier each time.  This time was the absolute worst. I'm at the table writing this review as we speak. Worst Service. Waitress is snorting up her snot while we're trying to order. Grossing me out. We order our drinks I get a beer and my wife a water, it take 25 mins to get my wife's water. And then my beer came 30mins later.  Our food was undercooked. Both our burgers were undercooked. Our bacon was raw.  Just very unhappy, and I feel sick. If I get sick because the food was so undercooked, you'll be hearing from me!!!"
Alyssa P.,"Bethlehem, PA",0,1,,3.0,1/3/2018,"The food was subpar with it taking almost an hour for the drinks and food to come out even on a slow business day. The service wasn't great either, nice, but slow."
Bianca M.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,2,,5.0,10/12/2017,"Went to dorney park and decided to come to BJs to eat after. Went with a big party (about 10 of us). The wait time wasn't long and our server was Michacelia (not sure if I spelt her name right). She was so nice and helpful with everything. She was very attentive to our table, accommodated all of our needs and created conversation with us and just made the experience very very enjoyable. Exceptional service on her part!  Bjs had an extensive menu so there's a lot to chose from and the food was great. For appetizers I got the queso dip and others got the boneless wings. They were really good. For dinner I got an avocado burger which was very good while others at my table got the deep dish pizza (which was a decent size), soup, pasta, and more. Everyone was pretty happy with their dish. Only complaint was the jambalaya which was way too salty.  Bjs is known for their poozkie, which I ended up taking to go because I was so full but it was great! So overall I had a great experience at BJs but mainly because of our server Michacelia! She was so great. Therefore If you happen to pass by this BJs restaurant location in Allentown, ask for her!"
Kasey P.,"Columbia, PA",54,29,47,4.0,4/9/2017,Service is always friendly and timely. The food is delicious and the atmosphere fun and energetic.  Haven't tried something that I don't like yet.
Dan A.,"Grand Bay, AL",9,10,15,2.0,2/3/2017,"Parking and layout of restaurant is very nice, lots of tv's, but music was a bit to loud, i couldn't talk across the table without raising my voice pretty much. Food, expensive... Thier large pizza is 14"", and while the deep dish tasted pretty good, at $25 it wasn't a good deal.. Bone in wings... can you say small? Now say it again while imagining the wings even smaller.. and at $10.50 for 10 wings. Way to expensive, i can't think of anywhere else around here that doesn't sell bigger wings for less,  maybe if they were normal size.. naa thier sauce choice wasn't impressive either. Dessert was good though! Had the smores ice cream thingy, $6 something, had a free coupon. But i can see paying for that. Didn't try the beers, so ill let those reviews to others... I probably won't be back, unless they run a 50% groupon or something... and ill have to think about it then. Didnt have a wait problem like others, was pretty fast, waitress was nice."
Teresa H.,"Lansdale, PA",28,239,32,3.0,7/16/2017,"Bj's, a place where a pizza cookie is a piz-zoo-ky not a piz-ookie. At least that's how they say it. Last evening we chose to have an early dinner here to try it out. We had a coupon, which pulled us in despite the lowish reviews. We both ordered beer samplers (4 samples for almost $7). We also had avocado egg rolls, cauliflower tacos with Brussel sprouts, a quinoa shrimp bowl, and a salted caramel pizookie. For me, the avocado egg rolls were the highlight of the meal. As a vegetarian, it can be hard to find dishes that are complex and delicious when dining out. These were perfect, 5 stars! I would return just to eat these. The beers were hit and miss. I enjoyed the hefeweizen and seasonal nit wit. The red was lacking and the blonde was bland. I tasted my partner's stout which was decent. I enjoyed that it was on nitro. The hopstorm lacked depth. Neither of us enjoyed that or the red. I'd rate the beer 3 stars. As for entrees, both left something to be desired. I felt that the cauliflower tacos sounded awesome, but they were lacking. The pita was strangely spongey. The cauliflower was bland and the entire dish underseasoned. I wasn't interested in the grain side, so I paid an upcharge for siracha Brussel sprouts. These were not very good either. My partner, who is less picky than me tasted my dish and said he thought it was pretty awful. I'd rate this dish a 2. He got the quinoa with shrimp. He said he was surprised he got as many shrimp as he did, but the flavor was just okay. 3 stars.  Lastly, we split a salted caramel piz-zoo-ky. This was the second best part of the meal. Warm and gooey. 4stars. The service was strange. The hostess was not very friendly and kind of just sent us the the bar area without actually asking us if we wanted to sit there. We waited a while for menus. Drinks came fast enough and our server was friendly. Our appetizer also came out pretty quickly. My partner's entree came out a while before mine and the guy who delivered it acted like he didn't know I ordered an entree. It was strange. Our bill was also brought before we had a chance to give our coupon or ordered dessert, also strange. One other annoyance is that we were dining around 420-430ish. My partner wanted a pork chop which stated after 4. He was told he couldn't have it because it wasn't late enough (despite being after 4). Before we even got dessert a pork chop was delivered to a patron behind us. Kind of annoying. Overall, service is 3 stars. The actual restaurant is nice and clean, but they missed an opportunity to offer outside seating and strangely sat a family with kids in the bar area. The menu could do a better job for vegetarians. Why do we need to pay the same price for a dish with meat as the vegetarian option? Overall I might return, but I'm not running back...except maybe for those egg rolls."
Thomas K.,"Reading, PA",11,190,638,4.0,2/23/2017,Service was fabulous. We stopped in before a concert and were not disappointed. The beer was decent and the food was good. We ordered the potato skins as an app and there was a lot for the price. I had the ribs which were good with a little spice at the end. She had the steak which was cooked perfectly. The pizza we ordered was stacked with ingredients. I'd definitely go here again and based off the Tuesday crowd I'd make reservations ahead of the weekend
Kathy T.,"Saylorsburg, PA",7,189,247,5.0,1/26/2017,"My husband and I have been to this restaurant/brewery quite a few times, we wanted to visit this establishment a few times due to there large menu (135 items on the menu) before writing up a review. First we recommend calling ahead, and also downloading there BJ's app, you can view your check and pay on your app. Which we think is a great feature. If you arrive before 6:00 pm they have happy hour, which is $2.00 off any shareable appetizers.  We have tried the the avocado spring rolls and the chicken dumplings as appetizers. The avocado spring rolls are amazing with the sauce it comes with.  For dinner, we have tried the flat bread pizza, the deep dish pizza , spaghetti & meatballs, full rack of ribs, brisket sandwich, there burgers, all great and full of flavor. Our favorite is there fall off the bone ribs.  Can't forget there dessert, warm cookie with scoop of ice cream on top.  Only draw back is the food comes out to fast, you need to slow them down. And would recommend during busy hours that they have employees checking there stock in the restrooms."
Keyla M.,"Breinigsville, PA",0,16,5,4.0,10/29/2017,We always had a good experience here. The atmosphere and the service were always great. The desert is great and their hamburgers delicious!
G T.,"Staten Island, NY",0,6,,1.0,10/21/2017,I must say I am very upset about my recent experience at this establishment... The food was semi decent overall but when your overwhelmed by fruit flies that are all over your food...and the napkins from the previous people who sat where you are currently sitting are all over the floor .. and they forget the two things you order plus your waiter/bartender ignore you... it can be more than frustrating... My wife got French fries with the remnants of whatever was in the fryer before her order...and mind you she ordered sweet potato fries which made there way over to us when we were finished with our meal I still tipped because that's just me... but there are plenty  of restaurants in the Lehigh valley worth checking out before you waste your money here ...before I left I spoke with the manager on duty Mike who did nothing at all about the situation and basically was useless... I will not be back...p.s. don't sit at the bar maybe you will have better luck...
Jamal R.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",17,3,3,5.0,5/20/2017,"Amazing service. My friends and I didn't have a long wait. Appetizers, entrees, and dessert was amazing. I order another dessert for the road. Will be back soon!"
Jessica N.,"Portland, OR",145,437,26,4.0,12/4/2016,"Came here to watch a game on a weekend and had a great time. Sat at the bar, service was attentive and friendly. Ordered the ribs and brussell sprouts and both were delicious. Ribs fell off the bone and sauce was good. Sprouts were delicious and a good portion. I also tried the BJ's porter and it was extremely tasty. Will definitely come back here to try more!"
AJ A.,"Allentown, PA",0,7,4,3.0,9/29/2017,Beer is good and at a decent price. The food is over priced for the quality. It's like an applebees but with better consistency. The servers are very nice tho!
Jose V.,"Macungie, PA",0,5,6,1.0,4/21/2017,"I Ordered ribs and you can tell the ribs were placed in a microwave and warmed up. Meat was dry and stuck to the bones. Meat had to ripped off the bone. We also ordered pizza with meatballs on the whole pizza. Meat balls were only on half, we pointed it out and waitress returned after 10 minutes with additional meatballs that looked like puppy chow. Total service failure, manager apologized but with no follow up to the conditions of the new meatballs or offer to reduce bill for their service or our inconvenience. This is the second time we have gone this restaurant with poor results. This will be the last time we go."
Chris T.,"Scranton, PA",84,4,,4.0,10/13/2017,Spoke with the general manager and rectified the situation of our previous visit. She was extremely professional with handling our concerns. Will go back again!
Larry K.,"Bethlehem, PA",12,266,570,4.0,4/7/2017,We came here after shopping and it's convenient proximity is great in that it's close to a lot of great stores. The wait wasn't bad and the atmosphere is fun and family oriented. There is a great variety of beers and a very comprehensive menu.
Alison B.,"Bethlehem, PA",330,13,,4.0,5/22/2017,"Pretty good - wait staff is well trained. Management is attentive and checks to see how dining experience is going. Only once out of a dozen times was the food missing items, dressings etc. takeout is very unreliable which is why they lost a star in this review.  The bar has great drinks, the craft brewed soda is really good. Food is good, menu changes seasonally and desserts are good.  Salads and pizza are favorites for the vegetarian side of the family. The salmon and fish dishes were given good reviews by the seafood eaters. There's lots of vegetarian options and the kitchen is very accommodating.  *the new watermelon salad is spectacular"
Jessica M.,"Bayonne, NJ",29,2,,1.0,12/9/2017,We came in an hour before they close and they refused to serve us.
Karma S.,"Macungie, PA",79,34,4,2.0,8/1/2017,"This is our second time eating here, we had a terrible experience the first time, when they just opened, I waited to review the place until I gave them some time to adjust to the crowds, train the wait staff etc... well six months later, we went back. Nothing has changed as far as their service.  My husband and I went in yesterday for dinner, the restaurant was not busy we got a table right away.  We both ordered a drink, and started with appetizers. Our Brussels sprouts came out, and wings... we each had a one wing, then my husbands salad came out one minute later, then low and behold our main entrees. That was upsetting, can't we just sit and eat our appetizers? Who eats that fast, why was everything was brought out on the table at once? Not to mention our food would get cold, and clearly there was no more room. We didn't even have the plates for our appetizers yet. I can't review the food because we complained to the manager and said we were leaving. One of the responses from the wait staff, was we will just put the food under the heater until you're ready. This happened to us both times, we went in to eat. The waitstaff wants to turn those tables quickly. There are lots of other pubs around where you can sit, eat and relax. Stay away from this one."
D C.,"Jersey City, NJ",34,111,9,2.0,9/6/2017,"Good beer collection, deep dish is ok but nothing like the real thing. The food here is okay but nothing to crave."
Nathan W.,"Allentown, PA",33,2,1,3.0,8/20/2016,"It's going to take a little time.  The staff was very friendly except one frustrated sounding young man excusing himself as he was trying to do something with the floor mats near the entrance when I arrived to the very busy location around 5:45 on a Saturday. This is the stores first week open to the public so it's understandable that things will need to get sorted. I sat at the bar and the bar staff was excellent, friendly but hard at work turning out a considerable number of their specialty cocktails and glasses of their full line of house brand beers. The bartender in my immediate vicinity took a few moments to suggest their taster flights, four tasters around 5oz. each. He was right, it's a good and affordable way to familiarize yourself with their line. I found all of the eight I tasted to be very palatable, the hopstorm IPA was pretty impressive.  I ordered the 14oz. ribeye medium well with their signature white cheddar mashed potatoes and roasted brussel sprouts. Here's where the learning curve was a little off. The first steak came out medium well and I politely asked if I could get it with a little red or pink left in the center. The manager brought out my re-fired steak and was very kind about the situation, however this steak was a much less marbled cut and noticeably tougher as I cut into it. This time it was very rare, sporting a cool red center. The manager took it back to the kitchen for one more go around. When it came back medium well with a good size chunk missing I didn't have the heart to say anything but thank you. It's going to take some time for the kitchen to get the hang of things, but this place is loaded with potential. Several guests near me had the ribs and jambalaya and were very satisfied with their selections. I should add that during one of the do over waits a bartender offered me a bowl of soup and the calm chowder is spectacular. Also the cheddar mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts were very good.  I was a little surprised that after all of the back and forth with my entree, the soup at no charge was the only consideration they made for my inconvenience."
Jay R.,"Waikiki, Honolulu, HI",0,3,,5.0,11/11/2017,Ever since they opened near us we have liked the place and have visited many times. The food has always been good but you need to remember that it can get really busy here and the wait time to get a seat can be long. They also have some great programs like free food for veterans on Veterans Day weekend. What encouraged me to write this review is the really special thing they did today. It's a super busy day and wait times are crazy. They are giving free pizza to people waiting in line. Seriously which restaurant feeds people for free before they actually eat at that restaurant. Just shows they are committed to great service. That extraordinary gesture and consistently good food whenever we have been here deserves the 5* rating they got from me today.
Sarah R.,"Erie, PA",189,96,437,4.0,12/23/2016,"Yesterday was my first visit and I really enjoyed it! We went during lunch and it was packed but the wait was only about ten minutes. However, if you plan to go during lunch be aware that wait times can be very long.  The menu is about 20 pages long and has something for everyone! There is also a mm extensive lunch menu. I opted for unlimited soup and salad for $7.95 and you can change your soup and salad each time. Salad options were house, Caesar, wedge or tomato and mozzarella. Soup options were lentil, tomato, chicken tortilla, clam chowder and cheddar broccoli. Everything was fresh and delicious. We also ordered avocado egg rolls for an app, which is a must! They are creamy and a little bit spicy.  There are SO many beers on tap. I'd say between 25-30, maybe more. They also have their own brand of beers and offer about ten different ones. For dessert we had a pazookie (sp?) which is a warm baked cookie topped with ice cream. I had a mini triple chocolate which was to die for! They have about 8 different flavors. Service was a little hit or miss. Our server forgot my beer and made mistakes on the checks, but overall was pleasant. I will definitely be back."
Mauricia J.,"Bethlehem, PA",2,20,7,3.0,8/6/2017,"Food is blah, place is way too overcrowded. Waiters are overwhelmed and forgetful. We got random pieces of  calamari on our pizza (it was not a topping). I don't get the hype about his place. Reminds me of an oversized applebees."
Y B.,"Allentown, PA",0,40,25,2.0,2/26/2017,Food was OK nothing spectacular. They should shorten that menu. The restaurant was nice though and women rest room very cool sink and clean.
Ann Y.,"Phillipsburg, NJ",0,2,,1.0,11/12/2017,"First off when you walk in, be careful don't fall!! I don't know what's up with the floors but they're very slippery. Service was awful our server didn't even lift his head from that iPad to make eye contact with us. When we got our food, it was all presentation. The bowl of soup looks big until you put your spoon in and it's like one inch deep. The shrimp taco was bad, the 3 shrimp in the large stale left over tortilla were cold and grilled yesterday. The chips were soaking in oil that they were soggy and tough. Meanwhile our server never stopped by once the entire time we ate for us to tell him about this."
Drew W.,"Bethlehem, PA",6,54,2,3.0,1/17/2017,"Went to BJ's the other night with a group of 7. ALthough it was packed when we got there, our table was ready a solid 15 minutes before our 7:00pm reservation. I was looking forward to trying BJ's out because word on the streets was that it is a good spot. This place has an upscale PJ's or Buffalo Wild Wings feel to it. Service was great, and there were enough TV's that you could watch the Sunday night football game anywhere you looked.  The food however was underwhelming.  I ordered the brisket burger which I ordered to be medium. It was served well done. There was one part of my burger that was medium but the rest of it, overdone. One of the most average things I've ever eaten. One of the members of the dinner party got the pulled pork, which she said was ok but not the best she's had.  Another got one of their salads which received the same reaction as the pulled pork. The menu is the size of a textbook which is fine, but this place is having some serious identity problems with the extensive variety of food that they have. I think they would be better off with a smaller menu and figuring out how to hit those items out of the park, but thats just me.   Their house beer was solid. I had their IPA which I think was called the hopstorm IPA? and the pale ale was palatable as well. Overall, this place is average. I don't know if they're a chain but it definitely has that feel. I wouldn't refuse to eat here again but I wont be gong out of my way to come back."
Matt I.,"Upland, CA",0,4,,5.0,11/14/2016,"I've been here twice with a party of 6, once for lunch and another time for dinner, and both times have been exceptional, due mostly to our server, Crystal. She went above and beyond my expectations to make sure our large party had everything we needed. Never was anyone wanting for drinks or condiments. She was extremely knowledgable about the menu, and recommended the perfect beer for my meal. The food was super tasty. I've gotten the BJ's favorite pizza, which came out in this deep dish pan, making the crust so crispy (all about that crust). Toppings were loaded, and the sauce was plentiful. Definitely would recommend again. I also had the avocado egg rolls (mmm so much gauc yummm) and the crispy jalapeno burger, which was cooked perfect medium rare, and was simply delicious. The restaurant itself has a great modern atmosphere, bathrooms are tidy and clean, and the tables are comfy (important for me since I have back issues). The location of the restaurant itself is also pretty awesome since it's smack dab in the middle of the new Hamilton Crossings. I had a 45 min wait for dinner the one time, but we just went shopping nearby, so it was no big deal. Anyway, It seems like a lot of the reviewers here have had a less than stellar dining experience, but for me, I was really impressed, especially with the service. Hands down, if you come here, request Crystal, she'll take care of you for sure."
Kealii G.,"Allentown, PA",70,55,178,3.0,10/22/2016,"I've been to this restaurant two times so far but I'm still not ready to write a full review. Unfortunately I ordered the same thing both times.  I had the Guacamole Burger with a side of mixed vegetables. I really liked the burger and the vegetables were excellent. I also had one of their house beers which was also very good. Overall thoughts are that this menu is way too big, the service is great, and food quality is good. I wanted to give this place four stars but friends I dined with were less impressed. Tip: download their app. I did and got buy one get one free entrée! I don't like how they were loaded Yelp with a bunch of their professional photos."
Dwight S.,"Mahwah, NJ",41,4,5,5.0,3/4/2017,This is a great place for food and drinks.  Great menu selections for food and drinks.   Menu is 20 pages long so prepare for allot of food decisions.  Some big screens for the games as well.   50 beers to choose from.   I like the 5 oz sampler!
James M.,"Langhorne, PA",55,2,,5.0,7/26/2017,"Last Monday, my wife and I found ourself out in Emmaus looking for a nice spot to grab a beer and some pub food. Despite there being a few cool spots nearby, we soon realized that most non chain restaurants in the area are closed on Mondays, so after searching around online, we decided on BJ's. Walking in, the first thing I noticed was how open it is inside, and how cool of an atmosphere they had. It's somewhere in between a sports bar, and a hipster gastropub. They have a few TVs with sports playing around the restaurant, but nothing too loud and distracting, and they have a giant chalkboard listing all the different beers they had on tap (including the ones they brew themselves), categorized by style. Very convenient and a cool idea. They have a huge menu. It's almost overwhelming but in a good way. Plenty of bar food, from deep dish pizzas that they're known for, to burgers, tacos, wraps etc. and a bunch of unique twists. They also have plenty of healthier or vegetarian options, and they list the calories beneath each item on their menu, which I appreciate. We both enjoyed our food, especially the Mediterranean Tacos, and finished by sharing a pizzookie, which was also amazing! The service was great too. I can't think of a single thing that I'd change. We'll definitely be coming back."
