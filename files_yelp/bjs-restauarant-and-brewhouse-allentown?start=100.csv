Sam B.,"Allentown, PA",0,2,,5.0,3/19/2017,Great assortment of beers on tap always seems crowded which is a good thing but I would call ahead for seating
Justin M.,"Allentown, PA",23,9,,5.0,8/30/2016,"Absolutely Amazing!!  For a place that had only been open for 2 weeks, they have their shit together!  The beer is great, I would suggest the Jeremiah Red or the Nutty Brunette!  All the food we had was amazing, garlic parmesan wings, deep dish pizza, and steak sandwich!  The desserts were out of this world!  Our waitress Mel was great, very attentive!  We will definitely be back for more, so happy a place like this has come to the Allentown area."
Ad L.,"Macungie, PA",0,6,,2.0,2/24/2017,It's a popular chain here because it just opened. I personally don't care for the loud environment of dining with 100s of other people around you. Not private and food is okay. I didn't like my meal sub par  but to be fair my family liked theirs.
Stephanie N.,"Allentown, PA",11,15,,5.0,8/25/2016,"I am one of the pickiest people when I spend good money on a restaurant. My husband and I tend to favor local, but when my better half saw a burger and beer opportunity around the corner it was a must for him. We must have hit an opportune window as were seated in under 5 minutes. Our waiter, Kyle, was prompt to greet and made lots of descriptive suggestions. We ordered chips with guacamole and salsa. Chips were made in house. They had a good crunch, but I believe slightly chewy in spots from being thicker and fried. I ordered the Salmon Quinoa Bowl. It was perfectly cooked and the Quinoa was especially tasty. One hour start to finish. Will definitely be returning. As a side note there are 130 menu items so lots of options!"
Cindy C.,"Allentown, PA",0,4,,1.0,9/18/2016,"Terrible choice for a quick Sunday 1130am lunch. Their own brew beers were flat and tasteless. Ordered soup and salad, they must have opened a can of Campbell's clam chowder and poured it in the bowl. The caesars salad consisted of about 4 romaine leaves ripped up. The bone in wings are tiny and not worth the money. We will not be back."
D S.,"Allentown, PA",36,2,,1.0,2/11/2017,"We have been here several times (close to home).  We had hoped it would get better as time went on but unfortunately I have to say, the food is just ok, the service is horrible, and it is dirty.  No one wants to step in all the food the people before you ate.  Go the extra mile and sweep the floor while cleaning off the table especially if there were kids eating."
Kelly B.,"Macungie, PA",9,341,7,3.0,8/18/2016,"The newest restaurant to Hamilton Crossing, has been packed since it opened. We went on the 2nd day for dinner. This is a West Coast chain and we have been to one on the West Coast prior to dining here. The decor here is very ""warehouse loft"" style. The service is very good, as presently they have experienced West Coast employees following them around, to make sure everything goes smoothly. Hopefully this won't change, after the trainers head back West. The menu has a good variety, but still very average food. They are more known for being a Brewhouse, with various beers available. There is also a full bar that offers mixed drinks and wines. I did notice 4 garage doors hanging, with tracks to be pulled down. So guessing one side could be semi-closed off for larger groups. I do suggest you down load their App, so that you can place your name on the seating list ahead of time. You can also order take out and pay from the App.  Foodies may not be impressed, but if tired of the same old places, this is worth checking out. Definitely go, if you want to try new beers."
Michael B.,"New York, NY",0,8,,1.0,8/28/2016,"So I have been to the location several times since the opening. On my past visits everything has been great. Our server Hanna was fantastic. She was very helpful and was there for all of our needs. We started out with the calamari as an appetizer. It was ok a little bland but good. My wife tried the piadia and I ordered the rib eye ""medium rare"" as the main course. When the food arrived my wife's dish was great. I was asked to cut in to my stake to verify that it was cooked correctly and it was over cooked. At this point it's no problem I understand that the kitchen can be busy and to be honest things happen. So as most know to get a medium rare steak its 9 mins top on a hot grill. After waiting 15 mins and my wife almost finish with her meal I ask Hanna if she could please check on my meal. She comes back with the steak and when I cut in it once again it is over cooked. At this point my irritation it at MAX. I tell Hanna just to take it back and not to worry. This is where matters get WORST! The manager Jodi comes to the table to let me know that he is sorry that this happened and if I would like him to make it again. I stated that is not necessary I have lost my appetite. He proceeded to tell me that he doesn't want me to leave hungry that he can bring a menu and he will make sure that it comes out right. I told him that my wife has finished her meal and I just want to leave. He said please it will not take long to get the food out and it will be his treat. So I agreed to order something else. I ordered a sandwich due to it being fast and easy. Little did I know that not only did it take about 18 mins for it to come out and in a Togo box!!!! Now I have lost all patience. I tell Hanna just to take my card and charge me for the meal that all I want is to leave. Lets also add that they charged me for the sandwich. She goes to Jodi to let him know of the mishap and he seems not to care. Just rolled his eye and removed the sandwich from my bill and charged my card of the rest of the meal. When we go out we never expect to get anything for free even if there is a mishap with our orders but never have I had a careless manager handle my problem with my meal."
Tami K.,"Breinigsville, PA",0,7,,2.0,12/6/2016,"I've been here maybe 5 times for dinner & lunch. A bit pricey ,  $10.50 for a glass of house wine, ouch!  The best thing here are the burgers. Pizza is ok. Brussels sprout app not so good. Salad good, but hey, it's a salad.  Went here last night at 5:10 pm on a Monday. Not busy at all, no wait. However, my daughter & I waited 15 minutes for the server to even greet us. She took our drink order and talked with her friends.  We waited another 15 minutes for our beverages.  It was almost 30 minutes b 4 we had our drinks. I ordered a water and a house Cabernet Sauvignon. She didn't write it down, she brought me no water and a Savignon Blanc. Sent it back. We only ordered two burgers to eat in and a chicken club to go. She didn't write that down either.  It seemed like forever for the burgers. My daughters burger had no cheese but we didn't want to wait for that too so she just ate it. The server was hanging out at the hostess station and talking with co-workers the entire time instead of bringing us our ketchup and water. The ONE time she finally asked if we needed anything else, I asked if I could finally have my water. We waited again for the ""to go"" chicken club I ordered while eating the burger. We left around 6:35. We only ordered 2 burgers and a chicken club & were there an hour and a half on a very slow night. The people behind us sat  after us, ate and left while we were still waiting and waiting, & they had appetizers as well!  Bill was 45$ only gave her a 5$ tip. I was frustrated. TIP TO SERVERS- they give you a pad & pen for a reason. I am not impressed when a server ""tries"" to memorize my order. I'm impressed when it is written down and done right the first time."
Jaclyn G.,"Allentown, PA",2,10,,5.0,8/29/2016,"This place is awesome! I have been here a few times since they have opened. First off, the service is amazing. The wait staff are all extremely nice and courteous. The one waiter we had, Tom, is probably the best waiter I have had in any restaurant. The food is delicious! My sister loves the parmesan crusted chicken. I fell in love with the shrimp tacos. You have to try their fried portabella mushroom and stuffed mushroom appetizer. To die for! Other family members got the deep dish pizza which was yummy. Don't even get me started on how great the triple chocolate pizookie is. Their drinks are delicious as well, especially the strawberry splash and pink Cadillac. I highly highly highly recommend this place."
Elizabeth W.,"Allentown, PA",0,2,,2.0,10/7/2016,"Had a late lunch here on a Monday. Food was tasty, but service was very, very slow & inattentive. Seemed like there were a million employees just hanging around. Waited 15 mins for waitress to come and get the check, so we just left, leaving cash on the table. Went over to Kay Jewelers after lunch to get my rings cleaned & the manager asked us if we had eaten lunch anywhere in the complex. We said BJs and noted the good food, but lousy service. Manager said that's what they hear from EVERYONE, and he shared his bad service experience with us. Really enjoyed the food, but not good enough to suffer through poor, slow, and inattentive service."
Jared M.,"Breinigsville, PA",0,3,,5.0,8/15/2016,Great food n a great new sit down restaurant at the hamilton crossings..Cant wait to come back
Morgan E.,"Narberth, PA",223,1,,1.0,1/28/2017,"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. We called over an hour ahead of time and while there was a rush, we were told a 30 minute wait. We ordered drinks at the bar, which were good, but as soon as we waited over the 30 minute mark we went up to the group of hostesses and they basically started arguing with us while stating we'd have to wait another 30 minutes. Well, why didn't you tell us an hour so we wouldn't have spent our money on beer and wasted our time? Also, we called ahead so 30 minutes should have been around 30 minutes. We could have been served elsewhere by then. The one hostess even said we were being""unappreciative"" due to the rush and that even she was bussing tables. Ok, but that is your job? Honestly, you shouldn't be speaking to a customer like that anyways. I wish I could have provided a review on the food that I've been wanting to try, but the hostesses were so unprofessional that it turned me off of the place completely."
Missy J.,"Macungie, PA",14,85,14,3.0,11/3/2016,"we have eaten here twice.  The first time, we had burgers, sandwiches, and a calamari appetizer. All were average.  The service was great both times. Food came slow,  but  don't blame that on the kitchen. Second visit, hostesses. sit us right by the door, even though it was the middle of the afternoon and there were plenty of better tables available.  My husband asked one of them if we could have another one, and he was told that we could just move ourselves wherever we wanted.  Really? There were 4 of them standing around chatting about school at the hostess stand, they couldn't be bothered to move us? Anyway, we picked out a good table for ourselves.  Kayla was our server, very bubbly and perky. She was on top of it. Our food took a long time, but it was good. Two sandwiches, Parmesan crusted chicken, and a large pizza. Overall, an average experience food wise, service from Kayla was better than average."
Shelly P.,"Allentown, PA",0,2,,1.0,12/7/2016,"I had the most horrible experience that I've ever had at a restaurant.  I ordered the Caprese Piadina from the lunch menu.  It was delivered to the table and I took a bite only to realize that it was meat-based.  Maybe this wouldn't be a problem except that I am a vegetarian.  I felt sick to my stomach when I realized that there was meat in my sandwich.  While the manager was was very apologetic and offered to make sure I was served what I ordered, and comped both my meal and my companion's meal, this didn't make up for the mistake.  This also could have been a big problem if I didn't receive what I ordered and what I was served contained something I was allergic to.  I'm not sure how such a mistake was made, but more needs to be done to ensure this doesn't happen to anyone else.  While I was talking to the manager, my server, Emily, came to the table and was made aware of what happened.  She said, ""Oh, ok.""  I told her it isn't ok because I don't eat meat.  She said, ""I understand, I don't always eat chicken.""  She obviously didn't get it.  Then she stopped back at the table and asked if everything was ok.  Really?!  Of course everything wasn't ok.  She was so clueless and not sympathetic at all."
