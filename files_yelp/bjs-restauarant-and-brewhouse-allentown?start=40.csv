Drew R.,"Allentown, PA",0,7,,1.0,10/29/2016,"This is SUPPOSED to be a ""brewhouse"", so when they bring you a bad beer, demand a new one! When your beer comes out with bubbles clinging to the glass or no head, your beer is not in a beer-clean glass. When it comes out completely flat, either gas is not getting to the barrel, the barrel is damaged, the wrong tap is being used for that type of beer, or they just washed the glass and it was still warm. These factors affect the taste of the beer and, yes, they WILL serve these to you.  There is obviously no training here, either for the bartenders pouring these beers or the servers bringing them to the table.  If it's not right, it should have never left the bar. And make sure they take the bad beer off your bill.  There is no concern for taking care of that either."

Tim S.,"Manteo, NC",0,6,,1.0,10/1/2016,"While we have been excited to try BJ's, we have been unable to get in - even with 'advanced' check in via their app.  Each time, the waiting area is impossible to get into.  Additionally, there are three hostesses simply planted behind their computers, when logically, one could be circulating to check guests in. OR, maybe you could check in via the app on arrival...  if other corps notice when you arrive, I'm sure they BJ's could work this out.  Hope this changes soon...  Our dinner elsewhere was fantastic, and really looking forward to Chipotle and Anthony's Coal Fired pizza."
Samantha S.,"Allentown, PA",2,12,,2.0,11/3/2016,"I've been here twice, giving all places the benefit of the doubt, as every place and everyone has bad days. However, the food cannot be saved. Ordered the calamari appetizer (actually both times, before I realized why the dish sounded familiar) - very greasy and oily and burnt, which is usually indicative of deep frying at too low of a temp but leaving it in the oil too long to make up for it. Main dishes were the deep dish pizza (taste was fine, nothing spectacular, but toppings were just a thin layer across the top, with a very doughy crust), a bread bowl clam chowder (bread to soup ratio was probably 2.5 to 1, taste wasn't terrible, just not memorable), a fried jalapeno topped burger (it's a burger, probably the best dish at our table), and the kale/brussel sprout salad (this dish made me cry, it was that bad, and I love both kale and brussel sprouts - there was no cohesion of flavor, just baby kale straight from the bag tossed with less than a handful of brussel sprouts, and I honestly couldn't tell you what flavor the dressing was - it was that bland). Wait time is long, since it's new and everyone wants to try the new place. Definitely not worth coming for the food. Hang out with friends at the bar? Sure, hard to mess up beer on tap. But there are plenty of better options out there."
Sandi B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",53,7,,2.0,5/5/2017,"I've been to several BJ's locations and I assumed they would all be pretty much the same but the food here wasn't nearly as good as other locations.  The tomato bisque soup had a good flavor but there was so much oil, it would separate from the soup.  I also had a grilled ham and cheese sandwich.  The bread seemed to be soaked with butter or oil and there were only two thin slices of ham.  Like the soup, the flavor was fine but I paid for a sandwich, not grilled buttered toast."
Natasha M.,"Orlando, FL",0,3,,4.0,1/12/2017,"Pretty good restaurant. Be prepared, its busy!!!  I went there twice. first time was on a Monday around 6:30pm there was no wait, i was with one other person and it seemed busy but they were able to seat us right away while other people are standing in the lobby area. food was great, service was great.  second time i went, wait time was 45 mins. it was a Thursday and i was with one other person we arrived around 6:30pm to find no parking, so we had to park across the street and walk over. we got seated in 40 mins. that's a really long time for a party of 2...i'm not sure if i've waited that long before at other restaurants but it was the last day of their buy one get one free entree coupon, so we wanted to use it. we got seated at a 4 person table, and it made me realize their seating arrangements aren't the best. they were seating a lot of parties of 2 at 4 person tables. no wonder why it took so long!  the strategy needs to be looked over and innovated.  while waiting i was able to download the app, and sign up for their rewards program. so now i know for next time, i can order ahead, check the wait time and even put my name on the wait list before arriving. food was good, service was great so i'll definitely be visiting here again. just be prepared, it's busy!!!!"
Dee M.,"Allentown, PA",3,60,37,2.0,4/8/2017,"The hype around this restaurant coming to the area was profound. My family and I constantly talked about checking it out and just couldn't find the time, until now. What a disappointment!! First off, I really enjoyed the convenience of the app which allowed us to put our names on the waitlist ahead of arrival and the text message to alert us when our table was ready. The atmosphere of the restaurant was cool and crowded with a relaxed pub feel. Our waitress was very pleasant and good at promoting the menu. My son ordered a root beer, which we were told was made in house. He raved that it was delicious and couldn't get enough. That's where the compliments pretty much end. Right off the bat, the silverware and dishes were filthy. Filthy!! Our waitress apologized profusely and swapped them out for what she claimed came ""straight out the dishwasher"".  This should have been a warning. We ordered the root beer glazed ribs for the appetizer and the flavors kind of fell flat. There was no explosion in my mouth which totally contradicted the ribs' appearance. The cole slaw that came with it was better. The peach iced tea, which I was told was sweetened, of course wasn't. Then came the deep dish pizza, that we were told BJ's is famous for. Really it's the reason we were dying to try this place. Well what can I say? The pizza is in no way shape or form ""deep dish"". And it took us a minute to realize, but the pizza looked and tasted exactly like DiGiorno's frozen pizza. We paid $24 for what I could have bought in my grocer's frozen section for about 7 bucks. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty good. It was just DiGiorno good. After this pizza debacle, our great waitress suggested a dessert that sounded too good to pass up. Her description of it's twice fried beignet covered in cinnamon and powdered sugar and topped with ice cream, fresh strawberries, strawberry sauce and whipped cream sounded simply divine. What we received was anything but. The beignet was so hard that cutting into it, much less chewing it, was a chore. It just tasted like a stale donut. No cinnamon. No powdered sugar. The tiny dollop of ice cream and strawberries couldn't save this disastrous end to a completely lackluster meal. I've come to the conclusion that maybe this place is strictly for the craft beers and drinks (which I did not try). Maybe I'll try this place again but just for a drink and an app if I'm too drunk to notice the lack of flavor. Maybe...."
Kristofer K.,"Emmaus, PA",93,1,,4.0,7/11/2017,"Friendly staff, good menu options, nice beer selection and bar options. Kid friendly and clean. It has that ""chain"" restaurant feel, but it's definitely worth a visit."
Alfonso D.,"Lansford, PA",0,34,,4.0,11/15/2016,"Stopped on a saturday afternoon around 5PM with a group of 5 the place was rocking again. This time we had about a 20 minute wait for a table,not bad for a late saturday aftenoon. This time we tried the avocado/cream cheese appetizer that was off the chart good and I followed it with the Jambalaya over rice with a caesar salad. The Jambalaya was good with just the right amount of spice but the Caesar salad fell way short.You have to serve it cold in a cold dish without wilted greens or don't serve it at all. Otherwise we had a good time and will go back. BTW when we left around 6:15-6:30 we had a hard time getting out the door because of the packed vestibule and entrance.No doubt those people were going to wait at least a hour for a table.."
Paul's C.,"Allentown, PA",0,14,1,5.0,12/5/2017,love the beer here and the appz are tasty. mad tasty
Tara C.,"Tampa, FL",45,132,62,4.0,8/21/2016,"This is a 3.5...rounded up. First, this location is SMALL. The bar area is small and the dining area is small. Wait time was 1.5 hrs for a table. I can't imagine anyone would wait that long. However this is the Lehigh Valley and there isn't much else out there. I am a fan of BJ's. Having lived out west in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, I've been to a few BJ's. This location is the smallest of all. BJ's is a solid chain restaurant. Decent food, nice beer selection. One of the reasons I liked BJ's out west was because of the size of the bar area. You could always get a seat...not so here. This is opening week so you would expect things to not go as planned. My biggest concern is that I watched the west coast trainers BUSTING their butts, while the local team wasn't as engaged. That's concerning because the trainers will be gone in a few weeks...and the locals will be left on their own. Management team was engaged, trainers engaged, tons of employees...time will tell once it's left to the local crew. Check out BJ's...go early or be prepared to wait!"
Cory G.,"Orefield, PA",4,33,2,2.0,9/6/2017,"I was here with my family for dinner we came without calling ahead which I am not sure if that is even a option... anyways we got there and there was a 30+ min wait but we were told that the tables up by the bar are first come first serve and one was opening up right as we walked in.  I was like great we will sit there.  The problem was that the server was pushing us out like it was a race to get us out of there. Constantly coming over and trying to take our plates before we were even finished, did not ask if we wanted another drink, just asked if we wanted to-go boxes.   My wife got the Bacon Guac Delux burger and I had the Brisket burger, which we split so we can try both.  The Bacon guac was really good but the brisket burger had way to much of that super sweet BBQ sauce and over-powered the whole taste of the burger.  I am not sure if we will try them again, but if we do we will wait for a table instead of getting rushed out like we were eating fast food."
Alex N.,"Jim Thorpe, PA",0,8,,4.0,9/20/2017,Great place for families. They have special kids starters of garlic knots and fresh fruit that are on the house. Good beer selection. Everything else was hot and tasty. Will come again
Yvonne C.,"Whitehall, PA",0,11,11,5.0,4/9/2017,"Great beer, food, service. Price is very reasonable &  is better than other chain restaurants in the area. The wait is sometimes a bit long but i often get food to go and it's never disappointing."
Melody G.,"Allentown, PA",63,45,,4.0,4/2/2017,"A little loud, but food is good and prices are not crazy.  Drinks are fun and it's nice that they brew their own beers - keeps it from sinking to the sports-bar only kitschy level.  Conveniently located and good food for a decent price point."
Jason S.,"Macungie, PA",0,13,,3.0,2/16/2017,Fairly average in my opinion.  The open layout might be appealing to some but I found it to be noisy and distracting.  Big menu but I find the food to just be average.  Encountered a rude hostess but the service staff was courteous.  Overall I just found this place to be an average chain restaurant.
Maggie S.,"Allentown, PA",227,4,,1.0,1/16/2017,"Came for dinner for the first time here on friday and got so sick. I've had horrible food poisoning all weekend, haven't been able to really eat anything 3 days later. I will never be back. I ordered half ribs, brussel sprouts, and a wedge salad. Although I will say the service was great and she was very attentive."
Charles H.,"Allentown, PA",0,2,,2.0,9/14/2017,"We have been here three times and two of the times we have ordered soup, salad and entrees.  Both times the soup and salad come out together and then the entree is delivered at the time that we both just started eating our salad.  What's the rush??? We wanted to have a nice dinner, but had no idea we were on a time clock!  Since this happened both times we ordered the salad and entree, I must assume this is how they rush all customers.  I won't be back for entrees, I might be back for hamburgers or pizza."
April J.,"Allentown, PA",16,8,,1.0,1/28/2017,"Came in on a Saturday afternoon, I've been sitting at table for over  30 mins waiting for service ! Ribs were like leather! Not a good experience ."
Jerry C.,"Allentown, PA",0,12,,1.0,5/14/2017,"Don't bother.  First, trying to get into this place (nothing to write home about) is nearly impossible, the call ahead App is a joke, you still wait 2 hours and god for bid if you call the restaurant to speak to an uneducated clown, they all give different answers, host staff is CLUELESS. Management does not care because the masses craving chain food keep coming.  Food is average at best and it is EXPENSIVE to eat here. Service is below average as well. The one time I went I saw three people send food back. Save your money and time, 50000 cookie cutter restaurants in the area, or better yet, find some family owned establishment instead."
