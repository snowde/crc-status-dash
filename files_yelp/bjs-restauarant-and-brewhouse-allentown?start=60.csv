Matt S.,"Macungie, PA",1,14,,3.0,5/13/2017,"Menu not to my liking, but what i got was good. Too many things with brussel sprouts and greek yogurt. Was ok,  not itching to go back."
Mary A.,"Allentown, PA",0,3,,5.0,8/16/2017,"Was skeptical about trying this place but hubby insisted on going this past Saturday night. We started off with a spinach dip that was creamy and delish. Bre recommended her fave, the deep dish ziti, and it was incredible! She was so incredibly kind and took very good care of us-- one of the best waitresses we've had. We'll definitely be back to try some of their pizza which looked fab on the menu! Thanks for making date night wonderful, Bre!"
Andrea N.,"Orefield, PA",0,8,,2.0,5/10/2017,We were out together for a family dinner on Tuesday night.  What a disappointment!  The service was extremely slow.  We waited 25+ for our Calimari appetizer.  Dinner entrees were nothing special.  The mahi-mahi and shrimp over couscous (advertised as a lighter calorie option) was terrible.  The sauce was watery and the fish was over-cooked to the point of being inedible.  I left hungry.  We won't be back anytime soon.
Marissa K.,"Allentown, PA",22,40,3,4.0,3/18/2017,Decent food. Comparable to an Applebee's. Service was excellent. Brussel sprouts were fresh. We will visit there again.
Greg N.,"Bethlehem, PA",1,46,43,3.0,2/8/2017,"This was our second visit there. They have an extensive menu and good beer selection. My wife and I both had the New England Clam Chowder (I had mine in the sourdough bread bowl) which was very good. We also both had burgers; my wife's was prepared medium as she ordered it, but mine was cooked to well-done when I ordered medium-rare. It took quite awhile for our food to arrive even though they weren't at all busy (maybe because they were over-cooking my burger!) Our server, Crystal, was one of the best servers we've ever had anywhere - very attentive and personable. She seemed to be as disappointed as I was about my well-done burger, and apologized profusely. We'll probably try BJ's again if we're in that area, but I won't go out of my way for it and I'll steer clear of their burgers next time."
Joshua S.,"Greeley, CO",22,2,,5.0,4/11/2017,This place was simply AWESOME! Great food and great service.  I had the siracha Brussel Sprouts!  Dude....they were sooooo good. And then I had the grilled ham and cheese.  Best grilled cheese I ever ate!  I highly recommend eating here!
Donald B.,"Bethlehem, PA",14,23,,4.0,8/1/2017,Good place for lunch and dinner. Great selection of beers to try and savor. Food is really good. I like the salads a lot and then ethers and chicken sandwiches are excellent. Service is good and friendly. Lots of TVs too if you want to go somewhere nice to watch sports.
Chloe A.,"Harrisburg, PA",9,58,,2.0,1/12/2017,I came here for lunch with my mom and sister and Definitely would not rush back. I ordered the ahi tuna salad and the tuna tasted very very fishy. I had to send It back which I hate to do. No apology was ever given by our server or the manager. My mom ordered the chili and it came out lukewarm at best. Such a shame bc this place has so much potential if they could get their act together.
Catrina K.,"Breinigsville, PA",29,2,,1.0,12/21/2016,Absolutely by far my worst experience at a restaurant.  Ordered the chili and found a receipt in it! Seriously? How can it be not seen when filling the bowl? Only thing the manager did was apologize and not charge us for the chili. Really? We should have received the entire dinner as a complimentary visit.  There is no excuse for this! Will not be going back to this place
Shannon J.,"Allentown, PA",13,5,,4.0,4/4/2017,Went went here last Weds. March 29 for my sister's birthday. We were a party of 15 at 7:00 the place was packed food was great and the service was stellar!!!! My only complaint is the menu. It's way too big and it takes a while to read and when your done your so overwhelmed it's hard to make a decision plus you forget what was even on the menu. Shorten it down a bit.
Jonathan G.,"Bowers, PA",0,14,,5.0,3/21/2017,I've been here many times Angie the server is awesome I also recommend the happy hour specials n the bar is very nice n bartenders are friendly
Shawn W.,"Macungie, PA",11,2,,1.0,3/19/2017,"Poor food and poor service..even though the server was friendly, she didn't check back with us often.  Food was mediocre at best.  Have given this place several chances.  Pizza was dry and bland...salad didn't come as advertised.  We have tried several items here and not have been impressed or satisfied with our meals."
Daniel S.,"Emmaus, PA",1,63,1,3.0,7/20/2017,"Third visit to the chain, first at this restaurant. Seated right away on a Thursday night. Waitress Sarah took our beverage order within reasonable time. They were delivered but then took time for our food order. Tall waiter who brought our water had not personally and just plopped the glasses on table. Appetizer came at same time as food order and were like warm. Obviously they were sitting in the back somewhere just chilling. Wife's veggie tacos were excellent. My burger was not centered on the bun with something under the burger so it kept sliding off the bun. Fries were most excellent. Took forever to get the check. Waitress spent a lot of time with other people and was much more animated and friendly yet pretty abrupt and subdued with us. Might just try appetizers and beers next time."
Jennifer P.,"Allentown, PA",0,7,,2.0,3/16/2017,The food was good despite the 40-50 minute wait. The service was horrible. The waitress was dimissive and did not take my order correctly. Instead of owning up to the mistake she did not apologize and dismissed the error. The server was rude as well. I am very understanding of mistakes being made as long as there is someone owns up to it. It did not happen. There was no acknowledgement of an error. Not worth my money!
Brian S.,"Breinigsville, PA",0,17,6,2.0,11/14/2016,"I REALLY want to love this place. It's so close to home. I love the atmosphere. But I can't.  Let me state for the record, my wife hasn't had as many bad experiences as I have.  Our first time there was about 3 weeks after opening. We sat ourselves in the bar area because there was over an hour wait...on a Sunday night at 830. My wife order a flatbread pizza and I ordered the beef dip. I ordered mine without the aoli sauce. We waited about 45 minutes for the food to arrive. My sandwich was cut in half. I ate the first half and it was pretty good. The second half was slathered with sauce. It's like they realized mid stroke that the sandwich wasn't supposed to have sauce on it and said ""oh well"". Cut it in half and sent it out. That's lazy. My wife's flatbread was burnt. I sent my sandwich back and got another one.  Second visit we sat at the bar again because of a long wait. I ordered wings as an appetizer and the ribs as a meal. We waited about 30 minutes for the food. The main meal came first and the server asked if there was anything else she could get me. I said ""yes. How about the appetizer?""  It was there a few seconds later. It was a bit annoying. Wings were good. Ribs were ok.  Last night we went a third time. Brussels sprouts for appetizer. They came out fairly quickly and they were good.  Then the food came out. Here's were it went wrong. When I ordered my food, I asked the server if he recommended the fish and chips or the sirloin. He said definitely the sirloin. He said he had it the other day and it was great. When it came it was small, thin and dry as a bone. But here's what really bothers me. Their menu claims ""house made sides"". I ordered the mashed potatoes. When I pay $18 for a meal, I expect real mashed. Not instant mashed. I guess adding powder to boiling water is technically house made. Really sad. My wife wanted me to return my meal. I don't want to be comped for my meal. I want a good meal. I can get a better sirloin at Outback and Texas Roadhouse....and that shouldn't be."
JJ S.,"Bethlehem, PA",7,27,52,4.0,10/9/2016,"Nice - new place to get a great selection of beers. 50 beers is really nice. Their BJ's brewed beers are great, plus you can sample them all till you find something you like. Our appetizer was mushrooms filled with spinach and artichoke hearts. They were ok, came out a bit cold and could use more sauce - a bit dry. Went with my girl and we both ordered burgers. Very nicely done, served in an aluminum tray with thinly crispy fries. Nice touch! Fries are great but they weren't steaming hot which means you have to gobble them down quick!! To accompany the burgers we ordered some salad. Mozzarella and tomato salad was good. The menu is a bit way too big for my taste. Salads, pasta, pizza, fish, chicken, steak, veggie dishes. A bit overwhelming when you are hungry and really want to eat. It's like they combined the menu from Friday's, Apple Bees, Red Robbin and Joes Crabshack.  With so many options it's not possible to make everything perfect.  My chef always told me - simplicity is the success in any kitchen. I would recommend it - if you want a new place.  Server was awesome and attentive."
Jaylynn S.,"Allentown, PA",15,70,26,5.0,10/27/2016,"This place is seriously awesome! They have huge selection of beers, and other alcoholic beverages to choose from along with probably one of the biggest restaurant menu's I've ever seen. Our server Lisa was beyond incredible, and the food was absolutely excellent. I can't say one negative thing about BJ's! I can't wait to go back!"
Emery M.,"Latham, NY",42,43,3,5.0,9/20/2016,"Great food. All the servers have been really good too. Ive tried the flatbread nachos, shrimp tacos, fried portobello pieces, and the deep dish ziti. It has all been delicious. In fact I'm pretty sure we are going back again tonight."
Alexander J.,"Allentown, PA",0,4,,4.0,12/14/2016,"Popular local haunt. A chain restaurant and not so different than its peers. Lots of sauces and friendly service. Lik3 Buffalo wild wings though, nothing to write home about but a good place to spend the night with friends."
Trudilynne P.,"Allentown, PA",9,11,,3.0,1/29/2017,Service isn't up to or at all!! It's a shame cute place nice atmosphere!  But the service leaves a lot to be desired!  I always tip and I couldn't bring myself to d see that's how much we were unhappy
