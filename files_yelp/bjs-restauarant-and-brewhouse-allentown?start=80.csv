Margaret M.,"Kutztown, PA",0,6,,1.0,1/28/2017,"No stars! They will never waste my time again!  On 2 separate occasions they strung us along letting us think we were getting a table. The first time we put our name on the liet and they said 45 minutes. So we said ok because we figured they were new and had to iron out the kinks. Never got a  table after them saying ""20 more minutes "" three times. Then 6 months later we figured we would try again. We called to make a reservation and they told us that if we want eat around 5pm then we should our name on the list at 4.  So we did. At 6:30pm we were still waiting for a text from them saying that our table was ready. When we asked, they said ""20 more minutes "". Of course 20 minutes came and went and no table. We left and will never go back."
Randolph T.,"Bethlehem, PA",0,4,,3.0,1/22/2017,"Was there on Sunday December 11th, 2016. With my girlfriend and her family. 230 in the afternoon. Had a few drinks and was cutoff by the manager on football sunday after 2 shots and a beer. Manager was a dweeb!"
Eric K.,"Bethlehem, PA",0,18,,3.0,7/19/2017,"For chain restaurant standards its really not that bad... The buy one get one free offers sent through email through their loyalty club is great. My biggest problem with this place is their system for putting a name in to wait...They won't call you're name, they'll text your number and not once, not twice, but 3 times they screwed it up and we ended up waiting much longer then needed even after they correctly repeated the phone number to me every single time. Obviously that system doesn't work at all so why not try something else."
Libby F.,"Trexlertown, PA",19,6,,5.0,2/25/2017,Food is awesome and our server was the sweetest lady ever. I also order takeout there a lot when I don't have a hot date! So yummy!
Steven B.,"Toms River, NJ",7,30,7,2.0,9/8/2016,"I know they just opened but rough all the way around. Server very nice but no details were done. No clearing of plates, drinks took forever as did getting the check. Food was typical chain and not what I expected from the things I had heard. Flatbread was very bland and limp and calamari was cold and chewy.  Salads were warm and not well dressed. The sangria was very good however. I may go back for a drink but not for dinner"
Dom P.,"Macungie, PA",1,15,,2.0,11/3/2016,"The place looks nice, but when I ordered my burger, I noticed that the white paper sheet was still on the burger!!! Gross!! Obviously, this place uses frozen meat and isn't fresh since the white prepackaged papeprwas still on my burger. The manager was nice enough to comp my burger and give me a new one. Looks like this place is still working out the kinks."
Jay T.,"Emmaus, PA",0,26,,1.0,6/22/2017,"The worst bar/ restaurant in the valley! Horrible menu with nothing but crappy fried food and chips. Horrible bartenders who don't know a martini from a margarita! I ordered a vodka martini and she actually measured a shot and a half and poured it into a half full martini glass! When I asked where's the rest of my drink? She said they're only allowed to serve a certain amount, company guidelines. No one on the staff is older than 25 so don't expect much. It's basically a Fridays without all the s--t hanging on the wall except Friday's is not afraid to serve you a real drink! Maybe it's just me but I can't think of one reason to revisit this stinker!"
Alex R.,"New Tripoli, PA",0,4,,3.0,12/10/2016,"I did not eat any food at this restaurant because I was suffering from an awful sore throat but I have many comments. First of all, looking through the menu felt as if I was lost in a mansion. The menu is 20 pages long and just filled top to bottom with food options. If I was actually ordering food it would've taken me quite a long time to choose. Second, it took 16 minutes for our drinks to come to the table. Everything else was quite alright. The food looked fabulous and the people I was with said it was good. The service was also good except for the wait on the drinks, which was the bars fault because they were behind."
Luke B.,"Allentown, PA",48,10,1,4.0,12/7/2016,"Food was good staff was friendly and as long as it's not super busy they have ur next soda on the table before you finish it.  Love the burgers, ziti and pizza.  The wait is long sometimes so make sure you call ahead to get a table"
John R.,"Macungie, PA",0,1,,5.0,12/6/2016,"Another great time, Raiders on TV and a grand Cru ale.  Over the top delicious beer Coming again next Monday night for football and beer!! Tara's service is friendly, focused and she is always on top of keeping my drink full Thanks again"
Kelsi S.,"Breinigsville, PA",164,23,16,3.0,9/25/2016,"We've been to BJ's a few times now. The first time, I had a party of 8. We unfortunately did not make any reservations or call ahead, but figured since it was brand new, there wouldn't be much of a wait. We were very wrong on our part. However, they must have close to 0 tables for more than 6 people. We were told it would be about an hour. So we waited. Then it turned into an hour and half. We were told a table was just sitting around. It took nearly 2 hours and 10 minutes for us to be seated. When we were seated, the service was great, we had quite a few servers for our table and they were very efficient. A few of our orders got messed up, but besides that the food was pretty good. Went a few other times just for drinks at night and it's been hit or miss. Sometimes the service is good, other times you can have a  miserable server and it's very slow. I was there as recent as Friday in which a guest in our party did call ahead seating. However, when we arrived, she was told by the hostess that they had ""no idea"" what position we were in for the wait. We ended up getting seats at the bar but all in all, we probably would have waited roughly an hour for a table. Food is good. Drinks are good. Wait times on weekends anytime from 6PM-8PM are usually pretty lengthy. App does not work. Don't bother with call ahead seating, it doesn't do anything. We will most likely go back as it is close proximity for us. Get the Pizookies, they are very yummy!!"
Keith S.,"Coplay, PA",0,6,4,1.0,10/10/2016,"Decided to give it a try because a friend said they had a good dinner.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case.  First off it was a Saturday night at 6pm and that was our first mistake.  The restaurant is obviously understaffed and in a state of confusion.  Wait times to get drinks and appetizer was unacceptable.  I timed 32 minutes till apps arrived at the table.  Dinner arrived shortly after but the frequency which the server touched our table was limited.  The food was very tasteless as we both ordered salads.  The menu states fresh items but there was nothing fresh,  but plenty of veggies that had come in a can. Will not be back anytime soon.  Just another typical chain restaurant with below average food.  One benefit was the $10 yelp coupon."
Keith R.,"Bath, PA",0,6,,1.0,11/6/2016,"there were multiple errors in ordering food for 4 people, also no knowledge of what gluten free food was on the part of the waitress. food was delayed or pne dinner lost.  Finally a supervisor got involved and straightened things out and gave us a discount. much appreciated. However, one serving of food was not gluten free even when it was ordered as such. suffered diarhia and upset stomach for hours afterwards.  Tried to like this place, great atmosphere and layout. menu was very diversified. maybe not indicative of what to expect, but missed the mark for us."
Michael L.,"Bethlehem, PA",0,8,,3.0,8/21/2016,"Unfortunately it was just underwhelmingly Ok.   For the price you pay, you expect a little better quality food.  Had the bison burger which was cooked well. May have been my fault that I did not specify but I was also not asked either.  A little too tough for my taste.  Secondly, it was served with cheap iceberg lettuce which makes it unappealing and un appetizing.   The poke appetizer. Stay away, should have known better ordering a Hawaiian  dish from a chain restaurant located in landlocked Pennsylvania. Lastly we ordered a deep dish hawaiin pizza. When did deep dish equate to thick bread with toppings on top?  It should be made like the outside of a pie crust with lots of filling inside.    Applaud their efforts at trying to diversify their food but unfortunately if you are looking for the new it place, this is not it. Will say wait staff tries really hard, probably bc they know food is nothing to be excited about."
Bill S.,"Allentown, PA",3,49,4,4.0,8/27/2016,"Place was packed Friday night. Rather long wait for a table.  First time here at this new place. We went with friends and enjoyed it. Our server Hannah was really good. Helpful pleasant and kept her cool even though it was hectic.  I had the brisket burger and it was excellent. Their fries are thin, and I like them like that.  My wife had the thin crust pizza with jalapeños. She likes it spicy. It was good, but would prefer a crispier crust.  We had the calamari appetizer. It was ok, but we have had better. Great selection of beers and hard ciders. You can order flights and samples too.  We will go back.  Menu has a lot of choices."
Jason W.,"Alburtis, PA",2,7,,5.0,8/18/2016,Love this chain. Been to a few in Florida during family vacations and super excited that this has opened up right down the road their menue is quite large but I haven't found a dish I would never ordered again. Thier beer is also average to great for any beer geek to enjoy and I see this as my new watering hole in the Lehigh valley.
Jennifer C.,"Allentown, PA",29,4,1,3.0,10/3/2016,"Fun, hip decor.  An ""upscale Applebees"".  The wait to be seated was too long, but even longer to receive our drinks (about 35 minutes).  The server apologized 3 times while we waited for the drinks, expressed being upset with the bar area, but did not make any changes to our bill.  We will go back, but not for awhile until their staff is better prepared."
Nicole S.,"New Tripoli, PA",92,6,,3.0,10/2/2016,I am giving this 3 starts because it was mediocre. The beer was pretty good. I would have liked it a little colder. I got a flight with 4 different bj brewed and got the piranha. The server was nice both times I was there. First time I was there with a large group for happy hour and  we got a table. The waiter could not check us out as we left without receiving manager override. So those who left early were urged to leave cash to avoid the headache. A better POS is needs. The pizza is very expensive. I got a small that was $11. The deep dish is good but I would have liked more sauce. The place is really cool looking and they have a lot on draft. They could use the space a littler better. Table placement is not ideal.
Hannah L.,"Allentown, PA",55,6,,3.0,9/27/2016,"The food was decent, we waited a long time for it.  I got a burger, I liked it but I wouldn't crave another.  If asked to go again, I would go.  The menu is very vast."
Rick O.,"Macungie, PA",0,2,,3.0,9/22/2016,"I've been to BJs twice for dinner now since it opened. I thought it was a nice place to grab a quick meal overall. I would've probably given it 2.5 stars if given the option.  Wait: I usually wouldn't put the wait time as a separate topic but my experiences here warranted it. The first time for two people walking in it took us about 45 minutes to be seated. Not bad, especially for being relatively new. Second time had a party of four. We used their app to check-in ahead of time. It told us to wait an hour, which was fine in the comfort of our own home. We got there and were told we would be seated next (my wife was nine months pregnant at the time). Unfortunately we had to wait for an additional hour and twenty minutes before being seated, with many parties who walked in being seated before we were.  There didn't seem to be a method to the madness. Why do the online check in to begin with? Maybe it was just ironing out some of the kinks. I think they underestimated demand. Definitely needs improvement regardless.  This was extremely frustrating and will make me hesitate before going back.  Service: Both times out servers were very friendly and knowledgeable. It seemed like they were spread thin but were never short with us or made us feel hurried. It did take them a good amount of time to refill drinks/waters. They were understaffed both times and it showed. The servers themselves were great though given the circumstances.  Ambiance: The restaurant is on the smaller side square footage-wise, but the high ceilings made it feel more open.  I was a fan of the decor. Exactly what I would want in a brewhouse environment. I realize it is new but everything was nice and clean! Noise level was about what I expected. A little on the loud side but didn't prevent you from carrying a conversation.  Food: I was pleasantly surprised with the food quality and their selection is very expansive. I had the chicken pita tacos with quinoa and thought it was great. I've also had the bison burger and thought it was good, not great. Generous portions. You can eat fairly nicely (steaks, salmon platter) or go simple (pizza/burgers).  It was tough for me to make a decision on what to order based on the menu size. Drinks:   I'm a beer drinker so I can't speak for their mixed drinks, though I was very satisfied with their beer selection. Lots of sections on draft. I sampled the beers they brewed, most of which were above average, and a few (including a seasonal collaboration beer with Green Flash Brewing) were great. They had a good mix of craft beers both local and west coast. I'm fairly certain they had your usual bar beers (lights and lagers) contrary to what another review said. The menu highlights their house-brewed beers and shows the other draft beers as a separate list. The craft beer selection is showcased on a big chalkboard at the back of the restaurant and seems to be updated regularly. You can get flights of any of the beers they have on draft, they do not limit them to only BJs beers. Though you can certainly find better/more expansive beer menus in the Lehigh Valley, theirs isn't one to scoff at.  Value: I thought the prices were very reasonable and if you look online (I think even on Yelp) you can find coupons for $$$ off or a free dessert.  For what they offer I would even say many of the prices were cheaper than expected. I definitely felt like I got more than I paid for. No complaints here! Bottom Line:   Good food at a fair price. Great beer selection. Be ready to wait for a table around dinner time regardless of calling ahead. Still need to improve the seating process. I probably won't go back until it gets a little less hectic."
