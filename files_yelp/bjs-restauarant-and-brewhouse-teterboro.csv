Sani P.,"Teterboro, NJ",10,12,2,4.0,12/30/2017,Service was great Food arrived fresh and was good  Chocolate chip cookie with ice cream was yum
Eddie M.,"New York, NY",34,21,34,1.0,1/2/2018,"The BJ'ssssssss BrewHouse we visited is at Teterboro Airport & Route 46 in Teterboro, NJ.  The deep dish pizza we had with vegetables tasted so clean and delicious, and I loved my BJ's nitro infused porter and stout.  However, our waitress was one of those annoying hissers. After she gave the check to us and the couple next to us, she gave that ear piercing hiss.  I'm not from Asia, nor do I work in the food serving industry, so I have no idea what this noise means.  But I do find this noise to be a negative reaction..  When she was hissing at both parties, I pointed at her and hissed back.  The waitress with her hair up & big glasses laughed and hissed back, as a defense mechanism to show what we were doing was normal..  Nah.. that's not normal to me. I would of left her a 1¢ tip, but we agreed that we wanted to come back at half priced Tuesday's one night for wine. So we left the customary 20% tip.  However, on the ride back, we agreed just to stay home on Tuesday's with our own wine and order pizza to be delivered.  Owners and management at BJ's, X out that hissing."
Heather L.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",163,111,393,3.0,12/28/2017,"I've dined here 3 times already and my recent visit was probably the better of the 3 because the food was really good.  Came here for lunch with hubby and we shared clam chowder and Ahi poke as apps. Main courses were avocado bacon burger and a grilled ham and cheese.  Food was delicious and our server was very attentive, but I have two pet peeves when I'm dining and today they seemed to nail both lol.  I do NOT like being called by name every time my server visits my table. No reason to call me by name almost forcibly because they ask you when you arrive if you are an awards member. They then print out your info and place it on your table for your server. I understand maybe someone in corporate thinks this makes your visit more personable, but I don't feel that way.  Second, do NOT bring my main course out when I'm eating my appetizer 5 minutes later. I hate being rushed when I'm eating. And I really hate feeling claustrophobic with plates and having my main course get cold as I'm still eating my apps.  Our server was great and I don't knock him for this visit because I'm certain he was simply doing what he was told to do. But corporate needs to revisit these policies, because it simply becomes an unenjoyable dining experience.  Overall I've found better choices today within their TOO expansive menu (yes it's like ten pages long which is a blessing and a curse), but I do enjoy their food. I just need them to chill a bit on the service. Yes I know - the irony....buts it's overboard.  I will definitely come back because my first two visits weren't like this. However our food choices on this visit were excellent!"
Alex Y.,"Fort Lee, NJ",557,433,2018,3.0,11/6/2017,"Have been here a few times now, and it's a nice place to catch the games.  Convenient location right around Costco and Walmart, so you can flawlessly fit it in between your errands. The restaurant has plenty of space with both regular tables and booths available, all with line of sight to at least 2~3 TVs.  Beer list is also extensive, though I feel that pricing may be slightly higher than some of the other local bars/restaurants. In terms of food, the menu is not for the indecisive.  The menu itself probably weighs close to 5 lbs or a little over.  Tried the spinach dip, it just didn't work for me.  The burger was also just so so.  Felt extremely greasy and the beef didn't really have much flavor.  The California chicken club and clam chowder were both pretty decent.  Didn't get a chance to try to deep dish or pizookie.  Perhaps next time..."
Dana P.,"Navesink, NJ",3,52,109,4.0,12/23/2017,"This is my second visit with my husband and we both enjoyed our meals.  One star off only because the red wine wasn't at correct temperature. Warm glass and room temperature wine. Our waiter was fantastic and attentive.   It's a bit loud, but that's to be expected at a brew house. Over all it's worth a try."
Thomas A.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",122,302,72,4.0,10/2/2017,"Like the other better-than-fast-food chains littering the sides of highways and strip malls throughout this great country - BJ's has a rather large menu that has pretty much everything you can imagine.  We've liked everything we've tried the few times we've been here and can tell you some of their stuff (like their shrimp tacos) is better than than their competitors (take that, Chevy's!). But let's get to what matters: the amount of beers they offer (including a nice chunk they make themselves) are most excellent (get their 'taster' flight!) and I almost never bother with desserts but when you see something called a 'pazookie' you can't help but find room for one more course. Churros - hot, sugary, oily Ice cream - cold, creamy, silky How did it take mankind so long to realize they need to be together at the same time?! More expensive than other chains but the portions are more than generous (we ate lunch and skipped dinner later that night).  But be warned: that churros pazookie is for a limited time I'm being told.  (Shame on you BJ's!) Any fans of the show 'My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend' out there?  You might get a kick out of seeing West Covina on the beer menu board as one of BJ's brewery locations.  (I thought it was a made-up town for the show.)"
Lauren K.,"Emerson, NJ",4,2,1,1.0,1/9/2018,"I've ordered from this place a few times, and each time they have messed up my order. Today was the last straw as I ordered an Asian Chopped Salad and they gave me the Santa Fe Salad. The box was marked with the right salad but the wrong salad was inside. Bear in mind the Santa Fe Salas has avocado in it, which is why I did not order it. I am allergic to avocado! If I did not look at the salad before eating it, I would have had a terrible allergic reaction. Will never be ordering from this place again!"
Alexa T.,"Bloomfield, NJ",248,22,32,5.0,11/9/2017,"I've tried out BJ's twice with some friends and so far I've loved it every time. The first time I got one of their shrimp tacos (forgot the actual name but it it had arugula and came with a side of quinoa) and it tasted AMAZING. Perfect blend of flavors for sure! The second time I got the Southern Comfort sandwich with fried chicken, ham, bacon, and alfredo sauce - again really yummy food. my other friends got dishes with salmon and greens, and some sort of chicken steak sandwich. One person wasn't a fan of their chicken steak sandwich and expected a different taste I guess. But over all we loved the vibe and the different choices on the menu. For dessert, they have their special - the Pizookie. TRY THEM. Our table tried the classic, the churro, cookies and cream, and the monkey bread. They were SO good. Perfect if you're having that sweet tooth! On Tuesdays, all Pizookies are $3, when they're normally like $7-8.  Without a doubt, coming in again!"
Conrad B.,"Wayne, NJ",8,250,1,4.0,11/13/2017,"We've been a couple of times and enjoyed them both. The food was good as was the service... fast and friendly. Lots of great craft beers made in house. (Try the Jeremiah Red!)  Good sized menu to choose lots of 'stuff' from... from burgers to shrimp tacos, seared Ahi, gluten free pizza and everything in between. So far like everything we've tried as did the people we were with. No complaints at all.  Oh! Do you hate Brussel Sprouts? You won't after having them as an appetizer here. Lightly fried with honey and a  sweet sriracha crema... Nobody doesn't like these 'bad boys.'  A bit noisy for my taste but then my hearing is all 'out of whack'. But it is a sports bar with lots of 50 inch TVs everywhere, so it's going to get a bit loud.  Great place to stop in after a hard day of shopping at Walmart and Costco."
Caitlyn G.,"Lodi, NJ",298,106,300,3.0,8/12/2017,"I came here on my birthday a few days ago for dinner with my boyfriend. I've been meaning to come here ever since it opened in the busy Teterboro Landing plaza. There's plenty of parking available for customers. The inside of the restaurant was spacious with plenty of seating at the bar and rest of the dining area. They have a large board with all the beer selections which is pretty cool. The atmosphere was slightly above casual. I didn't really see a lot of families in here. They have a nice selection of items on the menu. They have certain specials each day for example on Mondays the tavern pizza and deep dish pizzas are half-priced! The food/beverages are moderately priced. I ordered the Roasted Maple Salmon Pita Tacos was about $13. The salmon on there was cooked beautifully. I loved the grilled pita bread - one of the best parts. There were hints of maple flavor which tasted great with the candied pecans. There's also a Greek yogurt cream dressing over the broccoli slaw with small slices of apples. I loved the apple slices which added a nice touch, but I didn't care much for the broccoli slaw. For me, it didn't mesh well. There was  also a side of quinoa salad which was unnecessary for the entree. It didn't taste all that great. Along with my meal, I ordered a pina colada because I'm not really a beer person. I was hoping for the sweetness from the coconut flavor and hints of pineapple to come thru but it didn't. I tasted more alcohol than the actual pina colada flavor. It was a little disappointing especially paying $12 for it. I probably should've just ordered one of their other non-beer drinks such as whiskey sour which I usually love. The waiter we had was very nice. The waiters/waitresses take your order on a mobile tablet which is efficient! I would love to come back and try their pizzas which seems to be popular here (don't know why I didn't get that). I also want to try the pizookies here which seems like a great dessert with a variety of flavors. If you sign up for their rewards program, you do get a free pizookie."
Sharon D.,"Franklin, NJ",10,81,91,5.0,11/18/2017,"Excellent place to eat at . Today was our first time eating here and we were highly impressed. The food was phenomenal . I got shrimp taco  with a quinoa rice with beans and corn . Absolutely delicious. Our waiter was a great person who was professional , respectful, polite courteous and all around perfect waiter . Service was prompt and timely. My husband loved the beers . This place was certainly worth the 1hr and a half drive down . We came from high point nj down to Teterboro and we gladly will do it again .   I highly recommend this place ."
Cynthia M.,"Little Ferry, NJ",0,8,6,5.0,12/27/2017,"Great food, great atmosphere, great service.. I recommend it. Vegans welcomed! I had the Peruvian Quinoa Bowl and let me tell you..it was on point with the flavor and mixture of power foods... :)"
Ana Lee M.,"New Milford, NJ",533,99,123,4.0,10/14/2017,"LOVE this spot! My boyfriend and I wanted to try something new, so he took me to BJ's. The restaurant is in the plaza of Teterboro next to Texas Roadhouse. The interior was pleasing; seating area and a bar. Since our wait was twenty minutes we went to bar to order some drinks. I ordered the gin and tonic, and it was really good. Shout out to the bartenders! They didn't make my drink watered down or taste like straight up gin.  When we sat down our waitress was really good to us. I wish I remembered her name because she was very nice to us and patient as well! We ordered their sriracha Brussels sprouts as an appetizer (so yummy)! And for entrees they had a deal if you order a prime rib you can get a soup/salad, two sides and a ""pizookie"" which is their famous dessert . I didn't like their Caesar salad but their broccoli with cheddar was very good. The prime rib was delicious too but we couldn't finish it since we got full from the appetizers, soups and salads! For the pizooki we ordered monkey bread and churro. The monkey bread was my favorite! Absolutely delicious! My experience here was 10/10 and the food was 8/10! Definitely coming back to try more on the menu!"
Hennie Rose D.,"Bergenfield, NJ",383,168,234,2.0,10/31/2017,"Eh. To be honest. It was totally overpriced for food similar to Applebee's. Not worth the extra money for okay food. I've definitely had better and probably wouldn't come back here for the food. I may consider it to taste the beers on tap. But for now, not impressed."
Bobby C.,"Newton, NJ",9,61,112,3.0,12/14/2017,First time here. Very large selection of beers on tap. Very nice and clean place. Didn't eat so I can't comment on the food. I did have a few of their home brand of a red ale. Very good. I'll more than likely return to sample the food. Thanks
Ashley R.,"Edgewater, NJ",11,44,54,5.0,10/4/2017,"I enjoy this place a lot, it is always open late especially on weekdays! They have a wonderful hefty selection of beer and the menu is huge with the most options you could imagine. I always choose different things when I come here, it really depends on my mood. I have ordered the half rack ribs, with broccoli and mashed potatoes on the side. I have also ordered numerous salads, sandwiches, the spinach dip is bomb! I sometimes even order a beer when I feel like. The vibe here is real cool, chill and young.  The place is really one of a kind, in my opinion. I do have to say though, certain days and weekends it gets crazy packed due to football games and other events, like soccer or a fight. It's a young crowd but also I tend to see a bunch of families come in all the time! The place is gigantic and sort of sectioned off so you don't have to be close to the bar with your family. The food is an 8.5 out of 10!  I have always chosen great meals here. There was one time it was busy and the food seemed a little rushed and sloppy, the manager remade it and didn't charge me. So I continue to come back, I appreciated the fact that they actually felt bad/sorry. They weren't rude and they didn't even think twice about doing it.  Everyone of the employees are nice, sweet and actually care, I really do adore this place! Enjoy it!"
Stephanie N.,"North Bergen, NJ",89,61,17,1.0,8/26/2017,"I was really excited to try this place. The decor was pretty cool. Our server was very pleasant and welcoming.  My husband ordered the pita chicken tacos, which were very bland and had way too much cilantro.  My son had the kids burger with french fries. The meal comes with two mini burgers but one of them looked liked a left over piece of beef jerky. Not appealing at all. We did order it with cheese but forgot it.  I ordered a chicken tortilla soup with a chicken caesar salad. The soup was probably the ONLY good thing at our table. I asked for parmesan cheese and the shaker was disgusting. Some dried of sauce i believe. Nasty.  The salad was basically another bowl of soup. It was way over dressed and the lettuce was just a wet pile of glop. Two bites in and i gagged. Seriously disappointed.  The server was very apologetic and told us the manager would be over to talk to us but he or she never showed up at our table. 10 10 mins later the Server returned and said he would take my meal and my sons off the check.  My husband used the restroom and said it was just as awful as their food. The floor was absolutely gross.  One star goes to the soup and the server.  If youre in this area, go next door to texas roadhouse."
Chalita P.,"Leonia, NJ",163,61,43,3.0,9/24/2017,"Edit: 9/24 - came back for a second visit. Everything was going good up until when we ordered desserts. Apparently ordering to go boxes for leftovers meant they are throwing it away.  I guess the lady cleaning tables can't understand English.  Other than that I would say all the dishes with tomatoes we ordered (pasta and shrimp quinoa) except the pizza, was too sour. They really need to layoff with those ingredients.   I always wanted to try BJ's. I'm pretty sure this is the only one in the state of New Jersey. The food was like any American chain restaurant. There's a lot of options so you're sure to find whatever you're in the mood for. But I can't leave without first trying their Pizookies. Went with the pizookie trio and had 3 smaller ones. They're sweet, really rich, really unhealthy, but really good."
Red L.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,5,5,4.0,11/16/2017,"First experience here was good! I'm not a drinker so I cannot tell anything about beers here but for food.. they was good for my orders! I had rips (whole rack) and calamari,shared with my bf. We enjoyed it!"
Brendalynne F.,"Lodi, NJ",544,189,1887,4.0,8/12/2017,"I had the Enlightened Roasted Maple Salmon Pita Tacos, my boyfriend had the California Chicken Club and Berry Burst Cider, and we shared the Churro Pizookie for dessert. I LOVED my pita tacos. The pita was very soft and perfectly chargrilled, the broccoli slaw and crunchy apples added a nice texture, and the salmon was cooked beautifully. The only thing I would change about the dish is the seasonal bistro grains on the side. It's essentially a quinoa salad, but I feel like it didn't complement the Greek-style tacos very well. My boyfriend thought his Cali chicken club was good, especially the garlic sourdough bread. But he didn't like the fries on the side. He said they tasted similar to diner fries - too crunchy on the outside and hollow in the middle. We both enjoyed the Berry Burst Cider though! Great fruit beer. As for the Churro Pizookie, YUM. Just a suggestion though - if you like fresh and crunchy churros, ask for the vanilla ice cream on the side. By the time my boyfriend and I got to the churros under the ice cream, they were super soggy. Like Harry P. here on Yelp said, BJ's is ""basically a nicer Applebee's"". But that's not to say I don't like BJ's or Applebee's! I really enjoyed my meal here, and our waitress Perla was great. *PICTURES TO FOLLOW*"
Silas W.,"Newark, NJ",0,8,,2.0,11/11/2017,"2 stars simply for the food. The food here is great but the service is not. From the portly floor manager and the snooty server tiffany the service is at best poor. I prefer to have my server listen to my order when taking it when I go out. That did not happen. I used to bartend and wait tables and good service is the easiest part of the job. I also understood that if I made a mistake or the customer was upset its too easy to apologize and try to fix it.  So in summary, Tiffany ensured the visit to BJ's was underwhelming. The manager on the floor who was reluctant to try and fix the issue and really didn't care shows that its a systemic problem here from the top trickling down to some of the staff. Luckily or server was switched to Mike who was super attentive.  Despite Mike, the food, and Mike's effort to salvage the experience I'll never come back here again."
Alex M.,"Carlstadt, NJ",176,43,25,4.0,8/2/2017,"For a chain, BJ's has some really good beers on tap and the food is pretty good. Their wings are excellent, as is their appetizer pizzas.  The wait time, even when using the app to put yourself on the list, is incredibly long. You get the same great service going and eating at the bar or in the bar's lounge area as you would if you were seated in the regular restaurant - and you bypass the wait. Tip for making reservations via their app: If the app can't tell you the wait time, that means the wait time is going to be LONG!"
Cindy F.,"Ridgefield, NJ",165,260,380,4.0,4/9/2017,"Finally got a chance to give this place a try. I stopped by on my way home from the doctor for lunch. I arrived at around 11:15 am and my mother and I were the only patrons.  We both ordered there homemade sodas. My mom got the vanilla and I got the orange creamsicle. They were both very good I tasted hers.  We ordered an appetizer order of calamari and I ordered a bacon cheeseburger for lunch. Both items were pretty good.  This place seemed to have a great beer menu, which I didn't partake in as I'm 9 months pregnant and various bar food in general. It looks like a great place to come for happy hour and/or to watch a game."
Harry P.,"Mahwah, NJ",217,531,636,3.0,7/17/2017,"Nothing special, basically a nicer apple-bees. I got a chicken bacon ranch piadina, nothing special, and it was pretty small. I like that they have some local beer on tap, but they do have a good beer selection overall, including their own beer that is contract brewed, but is decent, especially at lunch when they are only 3.99 for a beer. Not a bad lunch spot, nothing overwhelming."
Ken F.,"Boonton, NJ",0,4,,3.0,1/9/2018,"The food is wonderful.  They did screw up one of our guests meal, and our server was somewhat of a douchebag, but the food was really good!"
Kevin A.,"NJ, NJ",6,20,,2.0,1/7/2018,"4 of us, at a busy time and they got us in pretty fast. Heard they only take reservations if your party is of 6.  Waitress took a bit to get to us, like 10 minutes. Our group was talking, so no biggie, but would have like to have got a drink order in. Waitress came, and 3 of us ordered their beers, which tasted good and a good price. Menu a bit big, alot of pages, but NBD. Told specials, and we ordered. Had two apps between the 4 of us, and hubby had a salad.  All apps and salad came out together. Hubby did not like that, but rolled with it. We're maybe half way/5 minutes into apps, and then our food comes out. Um NO we don't want them right now. One food runner says we'll keep them heated in the kitchen. Um NO to that too. We had medium rare steaks and burgers and pasta. Got the manager, and all fixed. Another manager comes over, sorry sorry, ok .. Then waitress says we'll give you a free veggie with meal. Hmmm .. weird but ok .. Two steak folks said was just ok, another had pasta that he liked alot, and my burger was good, but guac on it was tasteless. OK deserts. May try again, but usually when I say that, I never go back."
Sean S.,"Manhattan, NY",42,14,,5.0,11/25/2017,Sooo good we had the country club flat bread pizza and the meatball in mushroom sauce and mash potatoes we love this meal
Mike G.,"Hasbrouck Heights, NJ",0,4,,2.0,12/27/2017,Food is ok that's it . Service was great waiter was supper .  But the food was substandard burgers  were very grainy
Jill P.,"Paramus, NJ",635,174,1165,1.0,12/10/2016,"After looking forward to checking out this new spot, we were completely let down from their food. We left feeling sick and disgusted. Don't be misled like we were by their nice interior and pictures on the menu. Their boneless wings were either undercooked or so over processed, the meat was a weird translucent clear. After getting a second order because we thought they weren't cooked, I figured out its probably over processed chicken because it didn't even have a normal texture.  The chicken club sandwich is covered and dripping in garlic butter, the chicken breast again questionable and included dark meat, and my bacon was deep fried. After 3 bites I was done, no question if the food was ok after the waitress saw I wasn't eating it. At this point I didn't want anything else anyway. The Alfredo chicken pasta was not as bad, but the chicken didn't look real. This went in the garbage too. If you want a Moscow mule, you have to buy the entire bottle of beer, but you only need half for the drink, then they charge you for the vodka. So if you only want one, its $12 and its not even good because they use concentrate lime juice. It's supposed to be fresh limes. Then your left with half a ginger beer and a bad drink. The cookie pizza wasn't bad, except it was completely raw in the middle. Like straight cookie batter as in liquid, not slightly cooked. If it was cooked, it would have been really good. Came home and felt completely awful. Even the next day, terrible. Will never go back here. The manager checked on other tables but skipped ours otherwise I would have said something. Complete waste of $60, wish I could get that back and not have wasted the calories. Beware!!"
Camille C.,"Englewood, NJ",109,38,27,1.0,9/30/2017,"The food was good but the staff is near horrible.  I kid you not, 2 hostesses and a server were arguing with each other when I came in. The hostess in the very front had her back to me for quite some time before I could even get a greeting and put my name down for a party of 3. Then I was told the wait time would be 15-20 min. I thought, ""yeah right"". It's prime time for dinner crowd and all the tables are full. But restaurants always say that so whatever. (It was 41min until we got seated).  It seemed like forever. My father got impatient and asked how many people are in front of us. She said 2. I lost count but I'm pretty sure 4 parties or 3 got seated first.  We finally got seated at a handicap table big enough for 6 people. But again, whatever, that's what was available at the time. Waiter comes to our table with a tablet for ordering. ""What's up guys welcome to BJ's"" My father takes forever to order and asks a lot of questions and changes his mind...frustrating for the waiter I know. But the waiter shows his frustration and rushes through the order with his hand on his hip while he waits. Then he struggles with he tablet. Takes my order. I get a water. ""Would you like a lemon or no lemon?"" ""No lemon please"", I say.  ""And for your entree?"" ""Can I have the bacon cheeseburger but no mayonnaise and no pickles?"" ""Okay bacon cheeseburger. How would you like it cooked?"" ""Well done, but no mayonnaise no pickles please"" ""Ok"" ""You got the no mayonnaise no pickles part?"" ""Yes"" ""What would you like with the burger?"" ""Oh I thought it was fried?"" ""There's sides on the page with meat"" turns pages quickly in my menu to the page with sides. (Nice to show me options but he was really impatient) ""That's okay, I'll just have fries"". Food comes for my 8 year old sister. She gets a garlic knot and small fruit cup which was nice.  Appetizer of fried calamari comes out. Looks amazing. Cooked to perfection and seasoned well. Waiter nearly slams small plates on the table in passing.  Entrees come out.  Before we even take a bite of anything the waiter comes and asks if everything is okay with the food. My dad just says yes and the waiter walks away.  My sister got regular French fries instead of the happy face fries he took the time to explain and we chose. Again, whatever... My father food is correct. He got a soup in some kind of bread bowl or something. He liked it. I got my burger and fries and it looks AMAZING. I put the bun on top and it has a sauce on it...it's not mayonnaise but some kind of creamy sauce. There was no sauce on the description otherwise I would have told them to take it off. But I was annoyed because even wiping it off would still leave the taste on it. I take a tiny bit of the bread with sauce and it actually tastes good so I don't say anything. I put the burger together and take a bite.  There's pickles... I was upset by now. I confirmed that he heard me say no pickles no mayonnaise but there is sauce (not mayonnaise so okay) and pickles.  I just take the pickles out and put them aside. I don't dislike pickles, I just didn't want to have pickle breath all the way back home... I drink my water and there's a lemon in it... I feel like the waiter did this in purpose. How can the order be so incorrect??? I didn't complain about any of it. Someone once teased me and asked why I'm so polite to employees when I shop or eat. I never give staff a hard time unless it's really serious. But he clearly didn't wanna be there and had a terrible attitude. He was impatient even though ""wait"" is in the word ""waiter"". I know he was in a hurry and frustrated with how many menu questions we had but that should be common, especially since it was first time there.  The only person who seemed nice was the girl at the end who bussed our table. I hope the staff I didn't encounter is more friendly then the ones I did. It's a shame since the food tastes so good. Maybe good food is all it needs though. It's in a busy location and was packed with customers."
Tito G.,"Fairview, NJ",290,15,18,5.0,7/6/2017,"Me and my wife decided to give BJ's a try despite some of the negative reviews and we are glad we did!!  Excellent service by Tabitha, she was very nice, attentive and our food came quick and accurate! We tried the NEW Chicken Fried Steak Burger which was amazing, also had the Bone-In Wings with Root Beer Glaze, also amazing!! And finished off with desert, Pizookie Trio - Salted Caramel ( My favorite ) , Churro and the Monkey Bread ( My wife's favorite. )  Overall we really enjoyed our experience. From the service, to the food, also need to mention it is a very clean and beautifully designed place with a great ambiance!  Highly recommended!"
Michael E.,"Setauket- East Setauket, NY",283,251,492,3.0,11/29/2016,"This is a new restaurant in a fairly new shopping center. We were in this area about a month ago and wanted to eat here but it was still being constructed so we settled for a nearby burger joint, but don't get me wrong the burger place was really good. ""Habit Burger"". So while in the area for a work project we saw that BJ Brew House was open for business. This is a chain restaurant where you're greeted at the hostess station and led to a table.  First.. the restaurant name. Never mind. This is a large restaurant with a bar area, booths and tables. Based on the size of the restaurant it didn't seem too busy and there was plenty of help, but it took quite awhile before we were waited on. In fact I was getting ready to leave when our waitress Tabitha showed up. Just a note, they don't serve coke, only Pepsi.  For me strike 1. I had the burger with bacon and brisket. Out of this world. I could eat that every day for lunch if I could. But the let down was the fries that came with it. Fries if you want to call them that. Mine were just pieces of fries, maybe 1/2 inch each. Big disappointment. Ketchup bottle was empty too. My business partner had a standard burger, what else, and said it was good but I noticed he didn't finish the burger or fries. Seemed like he was more interested in checking out Tabitha. Sorry but the best I can offer is three stars."
Nick C.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",325,963,1662,4.0,11/27/2016,"Went out with some friends to grab their pizzookie for dessert. Our waitress, Melissa, was very patient with us and knew her beer very well. Our four pizzookies came pretty quickly, and they were delicious. We weren't rushed either, and we were pretty weird, ordering appetizers after dessert. Their sriracha brussel sprouts are really good.  The service was very good, considering how new this location is and since this is a chain restaurant, the service is probably the most important part of the experience."
Jae L.,"Dumont, NJ",161,183,121,4.0,10/10/2017,"Nice, big open space to jam pack with people. Tried to eat here a couple times and the wait was just way too long. Now that it's slowed down a bit, got to finally try a meal here. The food is actually really good here. Happy hour specials are decent and their craft beers are really good. Burgers are good and the pizza was a nice surprise. ""Deep dish"" style pizza is awesome with the soft, bready crust and a good ratio of sauce and cheese. Definitely have to try more of the pizza here. Location is a little difficult to maneuver thru sometimes with the walmart and costco being right there, but if you can get past that, you're golden."
Christine G.,"Englewood, NJ",498,396,609,3.0,10/30/2016,I came with low expectations since they are new and a chain but delightfully surprised. Some servers were clearly better than others but I'm sure with more training all the kinks will be ironed out. Walked in around 4pm on a Sat with no wait but as we were leaving a line was starting to form. I can see this place being swarmed with sports fans since TVs are everywhere both bar and restaurant side. The flight of beers is a good value for 4 5 oz pours at $7.95 and you get to try a variety of their beers. This was perfect for us first timers. Their beers were good. Light and tasty but some lacked that umph. I did like that they carried other beers from NJ on their draft list. Their avocado egg rolls and ahi poke were good and I would order them again but the deep dish pizza not so much. Wings with the sriarcha dry rub were yum and maybe next time I can ask for them to be a little more crispy. Pizzokies with ice cream were such an indulgence and on the sweeter side. They have a $10 off $35 coupon on their website until Nov so definitely try them out and use it. Will be back for HH and post-Costco runs!
Nicole M.,"Hoboken, NJ",10,102,3,5.0,12/11/2017,"Wow, I can't believe it took me so long to discover the greatness of this place. The menu is extensive and has something for everyone - lots of vegetarian and gluten free options. The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious. They have LOTS of beers on tap and great speciality cocktails. Last but not least, the desserts! Best desserts I've had in a very very long time. Excellent service and super friendly staff. Check this place out - you won't be disappointed!"
Jade T.,"Bergen County, NJ",218,129,380,4.0,10/23/2016,"Ahhhh so happy this place opened up! My boyfriend and I were shopping at Walmart when we noticed it. We decided to stop in for ""a"" beer because we had low expectations. We liked it so much we ended up stay for nearly two hours! They had a huge selection of beers on tap. Best of all, they have a bunch of their own custom brews. I loved them! My favorites were the Jeremiah Red, Brewhouse Blonde, and their Harvest beer (forget the full name).  We had just eaten dinner before stopping in so didn't end up trying food, but definitely plan to next time.  Luckily we managed to get a seat at the bar, but if we didn't, we probably would have left after one drink. There's a very small space between the bar and bar tables, which makes it practically impossible to stand comfortably while you wait for a seat to open up. My only complaint is that the floors are SO slippery..... I seriously almost killed myself walking around. My boyfriend said the same happened to him! I ended up bringing it up to the staff and they said that they have issues with the type of floors at all their locations. They need to take action on this asap because someone is going to seriously injure themselves.  Either way, I definitely recommend BJ's for some drinks, especially their custom brews. Just walk cautiously ;)"
Robin P.,"Tenafly, NJ",18,60,24,3.0,9/30/2017,"Food was tasty. Service was not trained. Overall meh. Beer was Fab, but we had Head High and can get other places. More stars of better trained servers....please don't call me ""honey"" if you're in your 20s and I'm in my 50s.  It's BS"
Mary N.,"Verona, NJ",456,255,491,5.0,9/4/2017,"The food here is really good and the service here is excellent as well. I had the sliders and someone else had a salad both were amazing. They have  over 3 dozen beers to choose from as well. Definitely a good place to take people out for lunch or for dinner. I will definitely be going back in the near future. Also, the bathroom was extremely clean as well"
Kimberly S.,"Middlesex, NJ",24,140,384,3.0,5/21/2017,"Came here for the second time on Friday night around 7:00 there were 4 of us in the party again and there wasn't a wait for a table which I was surprised about.  Again there was a problem with the timing of the service. Three of us were served our entrees and of course mine was the one missing. The server stopped by to see how the food was and saw I didn't receive mine, she apologized and went to check on it. I thought it was odd that mine was held up because I only ordered a pulled pork sandwich with fries seeing as though we also had a prime rib dinner and a baked pasta dish? Anyway someone then brought my sandwich but I really didn't care for it. The pork was really fatty and the roll wasn't soft. The coleslaw on the side was terrible the vegetables were chopped in rather big pieces and had very little dressing. The fries were the best part. I really regretted ordering it. Of course everyone else at the table was done eating well before me and the server came to clear plates and asked if I was done. I joked with her that I was sorry I was behind but I got a late start.  Anyway... I loved my dessert last time I was here but this time not so much. Now again another problem with the timing of the food delivery. We ordered 2 desserts for the table. 1 mini and 1 full size  Pizookie. So this time the full size came alone first which makes no sense to me. So I ordered the Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie since it looked so good in the pictures but after tasting it I thought it was way too sweet. It was just drowned in marshmallow fluff I could barely taste anything else. I only had a few bites and I was done with it.  After this visit I really don't feel like I'll be rushing back here anytime soon."
