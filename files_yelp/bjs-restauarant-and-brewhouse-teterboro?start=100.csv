James B.,"New York, NY",6,22,13,2.0,12/20/2016,"Have been here 3 times and the brew is good ,but the food all 3 times is served warm like it's sitting I'm the kitchen waiting   pickup , or maybe it's microwaved . I mentioned it to the manager seem like he absorbed my words but not too concerned . Too bad good brews but warm food ."
Arnie S.,"Maywood, NJ",5,110,9,3.0,11/9/2016,"Very friendly service in this new bar/pub. For a large, crowded place, it was remarkably easy to hear my dinner companion. Great acoustics, lots of wall mounted tvs with sports and news. Started with the avocado eggrolls. Now, I'm not a fan of the fruit, but these were very good! Crispy, abundantly filled, and the spicy dipping sauce was awesome. I had the jambalaya. Loads of chicken, sausage, and shrimp, and I like spicy, but it was wayyy too spicy to finish..evident by the sweat pouring over my brow.  The dessert was very good. A sort of salted caramel tart that was crisp on the edges, with a large serving of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream on top. The vodka tonic could've used a bit more Grey Goose, but overall a good experience. Ill be back."
Dom R.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",33,87,159,1.0,5/21/2017,Today's lunch was better here than the ribs here tonight. If you want ribs go to either boom burger or Texas Roadhouse next door. The staff is alright however I've had better else where go to love how we told our server we wanted a to go bag TWICE. Hire servers that know where they are and chefs that know how to cook ribs. Almost didn't get my change back too lol I don't think our server knows we're she is tonight.
Alyssa A.,"Bergenfield, NJ",4,25,,1.0,4/13/2017,"Went here at about 9 PM on a weeknight. The floor under our table was dirty, the menus were sticky, and they didn't bring out part of our order until we were nearly done eating. The manager did the right thing and comped us for the delayed food, but I'll never be eating here again. First impressions mean a lot, and this one left a bad taste in my mouth."
Suzaun S.,"Manhattan, NY",61,25,39,3.0,3/30/2017,"Food is pretty good. Would have given them 4 stars if the service was better. I've been to BJ's about 5 times and the 4 times I have been there the waitress's were horrendous. They were rude, forgot my order, brought our food late, and the best was she forgot to put in our order. This place really needs to get a whole new waitstaff. The grilled cheese and tomatoes soup is by far my favorite thing to get there and the salted caramel pizookie. Say no more!!"
Chris S.,"Bloomfield, NJ",52,3,1,5.0,1/27/2017,"Awesome new place I just found out about, very clean great service awesome food and one amazing bar definitely can be my new Cheers will definitely be back"
S A.,"Secaucus, NJ",0,20,6,3.0,9/12/2017,Only come here when it's busy. I came during the day a second time and was really dissapointed. The food tasted preprepared. Fries were stale and burnt. The Thai noodle dish is horrible stay away. They have good Brussels sprouts and fresh salads. The thyme chicken is good. Overall I wouldn't do early lunch there again. I could just tell something was off. The most annoying thing about this place is sometimes your food esp fries come out not as hot and sending it back can be an annoyance. So I tend to overstate that I like my food served hot out the kitchen. You shouldn't have to say things like that when dining but hey guess they leave plates around and like to bring things out all at once. Waiters are friendly.
Heather F.,"Wood-Ridge, NJ",1,77,5,3.0,5/27/2017,"They made this restaurant very nice on the inside. They have a ton of beer to choose from, lost of bad seating, high tops surrounding the bar, and regular dining tables. They have a large menu. I had wings and French fries. Not the best I've ever had, but not the worst. Our bartender was terrible. He seemed really overwhelmed, maybe he was new. It was a little frustrating because we had to keep asking for things multiple times before he would get it right. A decent local spot."
Mr. Z.,"Paramus, NJ",2,41,3,5.0,2/25/2017,Hands down the best place to eat in the area. Quality food. Lots of choices and quick service.
Krystin B.,"Lodi, NJ",0,22,1,4.0,12/22/2016,"A different place to try in the area. Awesome drinks and food. Downside= the host was not happy when we cam in and very mean, didnt even make eye contact. Our server Trish was amazing! Attentive, sweet, and efficient . The ribs are out of this world and the desserts are to die for!  Will be back for more great service and food... hopefully they're host will be different and happier next time or maybe i wont come back....."
Leese P.,"Lodi, NJ",6,16,10,4.0,2/11/2017,"Went for the first time last night.  I had the on tap berry cider.  Pretty good but not as good as their pear cider!  Pear cider was crisp and refreshing.  If you like cider, definitely try the pear!  We shared spinach dip, nothing special.  Tortilla chips were fresh and home made though.  I had the grilled chicken, bacon, avocado sandwich with a substitute GF roll.  It was excellent! Fresh chicken, crisp bacon, and ripe avocado!  Fries were extra crispy.  Boyfriend had shrimp tacos which was served on a grilled pita.  Very light dinner served with a quinoa/rice side.  Great food, service was attentive.  It was packed but didn't wait more than 20 minutes to sit.  Worth the minimal wait.  Large variety of food and beer that were fresh. Must try!"
Kriz D.,"Newark, NJ",5,6,5,4.0,4/8/2017,"This place is great! Came here around Sunday afternoon with a friend of mine. Its fairly new and a popular place already! The service was quick and accommodating. Wide selection of beers/spirits/cocktails. I opted for a pink martini drink ofcourse! For appetizers we ordered the calamari app it was good could be better. Then I ordered a quinoa spinach and mushroom and salmon entree. Definitely going back just for that. It was delicious! But my friends burger was a bit on the dry side. Burger looked good for the picture though, haha.  So glad they opened near by. Cheers!"
Benny T.,"Clifton, NJ",271,40,20,5.0,3/26/2017,"Came here twice with group of friends and I gotta say, I really liked the ambiance, the waiters where awesome and food was on point. I had their wings and the texture was crispy just how I liked them. Will be coming back to try other food options"
Alicia M.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",0,9,3,5.0,6/5/2017,"Great beer, great food, great service! We got a cheese pizza and avocado eggrolls! Both were great. Definitely recommend!!!"
Naphia S.,"Garfield, NJ",0,15,14,5.0,5/31/2017,"This was my first time here and everything from the food to the service was perfect! I had a large party of 24 people and they took my reservation, for a Friday night, even though they said it was 'tight'. My reservation was for 7:30pm and at 7:19pm I got a text that my table was ready. Seating wasn't tight at all, we weren't crammed in a corner somewhere and we all had plenty of arm space.  Because there were so many of us, we got 2 servers and they were amazing, They were so patient with all of our questions and special requests, never once seemed overwhelmed or frustrated. We also asked if we could do separate checks & to my surprise they said yes, and allowed us to do 6 separate checks.  Our party ordered an array of items, ranging from pizza, to fish tacos, to pizookies, and there were absolutely no complaints. I will definitely be returning here."
Edward E.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,1,,1.0,1/9/2017,Okay so I've been here plenty of times. Basically just to drink and bs. The most recent time I came here I was very disappointed and disgusted. I bought some cousins who came from Texas during the holiday season. We bought another family member who was underage and we clearly stated it to the waiter. Asking for shots for everyone except the driver. Everything was cool until the manager Maxwell. I repeat MAXWELL. (He told me to remember his name). Came to our table and told us any underage drinkers and we would go to jail with such an attitude. Remind you I told the waiter there was one underage person who was not drinking.  Now I never been so furious but I remained calm and said you know what I never write reviews but I am going to write one about this experience. So thank you Maxwell. You don't deserve to be a manager. You do not even deserve to be a bus boy in this establishment.
Jolline V.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,3,4.0,8/24/2017,"The menu was a bit overwhelming but the waiter was friendly and patient. Food was delicious and fresh, not a long wait. Definitely will be coming back."
Ashley M.,"Ridgewood, NJ",13,7,20,3.0,3/10/2017,"Went on a Saturday night and they were calling last call at 1145. They stated ""we are closing early"" which was strange. Great variety of beers and service was quick!"
Paul M.,"Jersey City, NJ",395,10,,5.0,5/9/2017,"First visited this place out in LA and was blown away and I must say that I was still impressed even with this location! Great selection of food all at such amazing prices. Portions are decently big and very very filling. Service was incredible on all ends of the floor! Great hangout spot, to eat and have a great time!"
Timothy D.,"Maywood, NJ",0,31,,4.0,5/5/2017,My service was quick and great. My Caesar salad was over dressed. The deep dish pizza on the other hand was fantastic. Deep dish pizza is not very popular in my area but it's something I really enjoy and this spot does it right. The dough is nice and light and buttery.
