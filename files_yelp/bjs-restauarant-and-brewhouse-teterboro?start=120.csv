Bobbie JO B.,"East Rutherford, NJ",57,12,5,3.0,1/25/2017,"Stopped in last night. Had family in from out of town. Wanted to stop for a quick bite to eat and Check it out. As it's a new restaurant in the area. Typical Chain Restaurant. Menu is big and lots to choose from. Burgers, ribs, salads.. I tried one of their craft brews. Tasty. So my guest enjoyed their dishes Tacos,  The spicy  peanut chicken dish. I had the All Night Burger. And for an app the root beer ribs. Food was tasty. Wasn't blown away. Service was okay. It was an okay experience. Will I go back? Maybe if I'm shopping at Walmart and want an overpriced beer and greasy food."
Ifraj B.,"Newark, NJ",1,8,4,3.0,3/5/2017,Love the atmosphere of the restaurant. I would've provided a 5 star rating but my fiancé and I ordered steaks. Unfortunately they were not prepared as we requested.
Ignatius M.,"Clifton, NJ",18,8,,5.0,3/25/2017,The hostess was wonderful! She was professional and efficient and  her greeting was unlike any restaurant I've ever been to. Thank you!
Liv S.,"Denville, NJ",201,25,16,5.0,1/16/2017,The super salad is delicious. I ordered it with grilled chicken and it was grilled perfectly. Definitely coming back here.
Dawn R.,"Paterson, NJ",107,44,25,4.0,1/23/2017,"My third or 4 th time here and tonight service was the best so far . It is very crowded and our server Ray has the whole bar section of tables by himself . Even though he is busy he still took his time with us and answered all of our questions and gave some great suggestions on drinks and food . He also recommended some beer samples which all were delicious and made my decision even harder . The appetizers are my favorite thing here. The fried artichokes , siracha Brussels sprouts and fried asparagus are so delicious every time , never fails. The pizzokies are amazing there's ALWAYS room for that desert.  Excellent service and great food . A must try!"
Santo A.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",31,18,5,1.0,11/5/2016,"I have been to this place twice since it recently opened. Once for lunch and then about two weeks later for dinner.   LUNCH: My wife and I met there for lunch two days after the grand opening. She ordered the Mediterranean chicken pita taco which lacked the main ingredient (chicken). When she asked the waitress jokingly ""where's the chicken"", her answer was all of the portions are pre-measured. Really?? I ordered the Roast beef dip where the au-jus sauce tasted and smelled like motor oil. Not appetizing to say the least. Ok, I get it.  Second day opened for business and they're still working out the kinks.  The wait staff was very attentive but were insistent about pushing the beer and having us sign up and download the restaurant's app, which I now regret. (I'll explain in a few) DINNER: Two weeks later we were shopping in the area and decided to go there for dinner and to give this place another try,  hoping they worked out most of their issues.  My wife ordered the bacon guacamole cheese burger which was prepared perfectly to her liking. No complaints there.  On  the other hand I wasn't so lucky. I was trying to eat healthy so I ordered the Chicken Barbacoa dish which comes with brown rice and black beans.  They brought out my dish which looked nothing like the picture on the menu. Barbacoa ??  I got a 3oz piece of grilled chicken (pre-measured portions) remember?, smothered In ice cold salsa right out of the refrigerator. Really disgusting. No effort what so ever put into making that dish. I showed my waitress and she agreed we and sent it back. I had to re-order something so I went with the chicken wing appetizer with no sauce or rub, just plain wings. I knew they couldn't mess that up. The waitress was awesome and took good care of us, knowing herself; that the food pretty much sucked.  THE CHECK: Now It's time to try out the new BJ's app and pay the check through my iPhone, cool right? Having put all my information into the app previously, this should have been no problem.  I decided to give my waitress a 25% tip who did an exceptional job.  Once the check cleared through the app on my phone I noticed that I was overcharged by about $7. The manager then came to my table and regrettably explained that the bill already went thru electronically and there was nothing he could do except offer us a Pizookie (dessert cookie) the next time we visit. Just ask for him. WTF!! I asked why couldn't he just cancel the check out, but he said it already went thru. I then suggested he just go into the register and pull out $7 and give it to me. He couldn't do that either.  It's not about the $7. I was generous enough to give the waitress a nice tip. It's the point that I don't believe the manager used all his resources to address this issue.  He must have figured it's only $7, but he is truly mistaken. It's a lot more."
Wilkins B.,"Hackensack, NJ",36,50,40,5.0,12/9/2016,"Wow!  Excellent service even when it was busy.  Management is on point when asking for assistance with $10 AMC movie tickets on a busy night.  Now for the food....I have to say this place is like Miller ale's, hulahans and Friday's put together.  Their mozzarella sticks are better than Friday's with shredded Parmesan cheese on it.  The steak and burgers are cooked as wished.  The desserts are amazing and unique.  Their fries are soft and yet crunchy on the outside as they are coated with some type of crunch.  I'm in love with the cream sodas!!!!  Their prices are a bit more fair.  This place gets a perfect score because it stopped me from going to 3 different places.  Ive been here a lot and sadly I did not take pictures because I was so into eating and enjoying (Forgive me).  Next time, I will take some pictures.  Staff, prices, food, drinks, desserts, environment, service and bathroom, yes, bathroom is a perfect score!"
Abhishek G.,"West New York, NJ",2,15,,2.0,12/13/2016,"Bad service.and it starts right from the gate entrance.the wait staff gives you a wait time of 1.5 hours which immediately turns away guests to leave for other places in the vicinity.and mind you there are plenty.not a wise thing to do when you just opened. We actually saw a few people leave. Secondly,the staff is untrained in the sense that they don't have a sense of seating arrangement and don't know the actual wait times and give out wrong information to customers. I saw people in groups of two or three sitting in a booth for 6. We actually got our table well before 1.5 hours. Coming to service,i think they are very understaffed or undertrained.the waitress had to be reminded again and again for the drinks.she gave the reason that bar was backed up whereas it was Monday night 9:30 pm and it was half empty. She did not even put up the cutleries before the food showed up.we had to ask twice.she didn't ring in a few items.not even the mini birthday pizzokie my wife ordered for me. Totally sub par service. The food was just average.we ordered same pizza twice and it was different in taste.the waiter didn't knew how to handle the heavy cast iron pan. Pizzokie was the only thing good about this night. I had much better experience at their California locations. This location needs to up their ante to make a mark. May be I won't visit again even though I'm a big BJ's fan."
Kimberly C.,"San Marino, CA",27,399,172,3.0,1/1/2017,"Compared to other BJ's I've been to, this location is lacking in number of screens, although the TVs they do have are great. Being able to watch is greatly dependent on where you're sitting. The service here was fantastic, with the servers being very knowledgeable about the beers on tap. Food came out quickly and, of course, the pizookie was delicious."
Susan P.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,14,,5.0,8/15/2017,"Happened in tonight on a half price bottle of wine night! They sat us in a booth. I was happy already. It was the best French dip we had ever had! It melted in our mouths. Yummy sweet potato fries, matched with a Murphy Goode cabernet sauvignon.  We shared the monkey bread with vanilla ice cream for dessert. Yes, this is as good as it gets!"
Mohamed M.,"Cedar Falls, IA",70,1,,1.0,11/27/2016,"This place looks good, but the service is unbelievably terrible. The server took half an hour till he brought us our drinks, another half an hour to take our orders and the food arrived after two hours after we're seated. My friend got his dessert before his entrée, my other friend got his steak burnt from the outside, and my order as an appetizer took an hour (spinach dip) and the dessert took two hours to show up! The waiter literally said ""I am not sure what the hell is going on""... Guess who is not getting tip and a dozen of lost customers? Yep, this place!"
Michael M.,"Palisades Park, NJ",2,50,,3.0,1/24/2017,"Hit or miss with this place. Food is usually great but once in a while it taste like crap, tho management will take care of it. Take out is always a drag even if I order 25 mins early It always takes 5-10 mins just to get my order."
Alana G.,"Bayonne, NJ",2,26,1,4.0,11/11/2016,"Decided to check this place out after a recommendation by a friend. The staff was very warm and welcoming. When we were seated the hostess made light conversation and asked if it was our first time here and explained the menu, the beer, and told us to save room for dessert cause the pizookies are a must try (she wasn't kidding!!) Our waiter and his trainee were very nice and accommodating. My friend I ordered two tasters and tried almost every beer they had. The tasters are very generous 5oz pours. I highly recommend a taster it's a great portion and you get to try a bunch of beers. The food was all really good and fairly priced. The highlight of the meal was definitely the Pizookie. My friends and I split the peanut butter smores one which was to die for. I was very happy with my all around experience here, great food, good service, and good beer. I will be back!"
Irene K.,"Edison, NJ",1,8,2,1.0,1/21/2017,"Service is eh, food is decent, only thing great is the pizza. Vegetable sides (asparagus / broccoli)  are super salty, also is the black and blue house burger. The hostess team are the WORST, we did the call a head seating, still waited longer than they stated. They clearly were seating parties who came after us. When we asked the hostess why we haven't been seated yet, she asked the other hostess and she said hold on I'm on my phone, clearly on snap chat. If I really had to give advise for someone, just do take out."
Susie R.,"Lodi, NJ",55,35,10,3.0,2/10/2017,Little pricey. Super packed all the time. Wasn't crazy about the food. Drinks are decent.
Ruch P.,"Wood-Ridge, NJ",5,33,8,5.0,1/19/2017,"We've been to BJs brew house a few times and have always had a good experience. The few items (spinach stuffed mushrooms, deep dish ziti, etc.) we've tried have been delicious."
Maria D.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,1,,1.0,10/22/2016,"Just dine in and was totally frustrated with my first visit. I ordered the parmesan chicken with white mashed potatoes and brocolli, very salty though i squeezed the lemon all over the chicken. The mashed potatoes seems like instant in a box and the brocolli, part raw. The strawberry lemonade is just like puree that i need to add water just to finish it. Then i asked for table napkins 3 times, first 2 service crew haven't come back and on third time, comes back with 2 small brown pieces of napkins that they use as coasters. The service crew asked how are we doing, and i said the food is salty, i dont even ate half on the plate, and she goes' oh, im sorry, do you need a container to go?'. The heck! I will not recommend this place. Paid too much with unsatisfying experience here."
Shelley R.,"Paramus, NJ",1,9,5,2.0,11/12/2016,"Quite disappointed last night at BJ's. First off- a place that calls itself a ""brew house"" should have more than 12 seats at the bar! It was literally impossible to order a drink and if you are actually able to, there is no place to stand and hang out to enjoy it as the tables nearby back right up to the bar stools. We waited over an hour for a table- no place to sit at all while we waited -standing room only in the crowded entry area. Food was average quality but more pricey than we expected. The saving grace of the evening was our waitress but that was about it. Will probably give it one more chance in a month or so but most definitely not on a weekend or at peak hours."
Paul M.,"Secaucus, NJ",59,3,,5.0,2/26/2017,"Service was fantastic. Very attentive and friendly but not over the top. Ordered bone-in wings with root beer sauce. Delicious. For meals we had cauliflower tacos and a California club sandwich. Both were loaded with flavor and extremely filling. Somehow, we managed to order a mint pizookie. It didn't disappoint in the least. My girlfriend and I were fighting over the last bite. She won."
Gabriela R.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",1,15,,2.0,12/22/2016,This place is spacious but the food is mediocre. Food on the menu sounds fancier than what is served. Might give it another try since it is relatively new.
