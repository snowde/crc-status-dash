Kimberly S.,"West Orange, NJ",0,5,,1.0,2/19/2017,"This was our first time there and will be the last.   We ordered the wing bone in with the pepper BBQ sauce.  The sauce was great, but I think they are killing parakeets and finches to use for their wings, they were the smallest ones I have ever seen and for that cost they shouldn't be that small! We ordered burgers and they were so salty we could not even finish them. I guess they are hoping to make you thirsty to drink from their expensive beer lists.  Service was also horrible,  has to ask for refills and everything else. If your in the area go to Texas Roadhouse next door - better everything,  you'll be very disappointed if you go to BJ's!!!"

Phil S.,"Rutherford, NJ",83,6,,5.0,1/31/2017,"Great quality food and atmosphere. An awesome place to grab a drink and hang out with friends or family. I would highly recommend trying their pizza or burgers. Both are prepared to perfection, tasty, and filling."
linda c.,"Fort Lee, NJ",1,14,18,4.0,5/27/2017,We love this place.  Great service. Nice ambiance. Table and bar service. Sports bar that's not on top of you great menu with calorie count.
Tony H.,"Avenel, NJ",31,18,,3.0,12/23/2016,"Enviorment setting is nice and big, good alcohol selection, however not impressed with my order of chicken soft tacos, I ordered extra chicken and portions were small. Waitresses were nice. Next time I will order a different meal and update rating if necessary."
Lloyd S.,"Paramus, NJ",1,4,,4.0,11/6/2016,Service friendly and knowledgeable.  Good eclectic meningitis with lots of healthy and interesting fare as well. Open air and lively atmosphere. Great for a family meal or date  night.   Go a little early or there will be a wait.
Alexx M.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",165,6,2,1.0,2/15/2017,"I came here once for a family members birthday, and wanted to come back again because my first experience was wonderful. The menu catered to my dietary restrictions, the food was delicious, and our waiter made sure we were accommodated properly. My husband and I decided we wanted to come back a second time to celebrate our anniversary, and called at 11 am to make reservations @ 6 pm because that place is seriously busy on weekends/nights. We get there and I approach the hostess and right away I am greeted with attitude. I told her we had a reservation for 2 people at 6 pm under my name, and the hostess said we'd have to wait 45 minutes. My husband asked her if we made a reservation, then why are we waiting for 45 minutes?? And she responded that, it was a ""call ahead"", meaning that it would cut our waiting time in HALF. How is that acceptable? I had called at 11 am, the time they open! The whole point of a reservation is to reserve a table for a specific time. I, myself, have worked in the restaurant business for a number of years and even on my busiest nights, I have never once gave a customer attitude, and I made a point to ensure their time with me and their experience at that restaurant was beyond adequate. Needless to say, we went to a Friday's nearby instead, and had one of the best experiences at a chain food restaurant ever. Sorry, but I don't think I will be coming back here anytime soon."
Andrea C.,"Hackensack, NJ",59,28,3,5.0,6/4/2017,"Giving this place a five star because of our waiter Trish. She was absolutely beyond phenomenal. She really cared about us being content with our drink and food orders, she had recommendations and allowed us to sample some beers before ordering. We attended here for some  drinks and apps. The wings were very very tasty and my beer was different, ordinary and refreshing. Prices are reasonable and overall experience was pleasant. Definitely recommend, however they do get very packed on weekends so expect wait times."
Patricia K.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",1,5,14,5.0,10/30/2016,"This place is amazing ! From the service to the beer selection to the food you couldn't ask for more. And not to mention you must save room for dessert because it's that good!! Even when it seems over whelming because there's so many options on the food and drink menu , you just let the server know what you normally drink and they give you samples Of their beer that are similar yet so much better! and when you know what your in the mood for food wise they basically help you narrow down the options. My boyfriend and I got the chicken pot stickers and calamari as an app , and then a mini pizza ( deep dish bjs favorite ) , and ribs and ahi tuna salad as an entree and we loved everything.  They also have a special going on for October for breast cancer awareness month , select drinks proceeds go to the the foundation , the manager maxwell checked on us and we let him know how delightful everything was. Our server Shannon did an awesome job and they've only been open a week and a half . 5 stars from us!"
Johanna G.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",96,11,2,5.0,11/27/2016,"Great service by James. Gave us samples of four different beers. The food was great, quick and delicious. also happy hour during football!!"
Samantha P.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",71,4,,5.0,11/26/2016,This restaurant just opened not too long ago in my area. Just stopped in today to check it out. I had a great experience! The service was great from our waitress down to the bus boys taking our empty plates. Everyone had a smile on their face and was very polite and willing to help. Even had another waitress refill our drinks. Very professional staff. The food was amazing. Everything was served hot and seemed very fresh. We ordered an appetizer it was spaced out well from our entrees. Decent sized servings also for a good price. Not over priced at all. I didn't have any of their alcoholic beverages but the selection from their own brews to mixed drinks gave you a full variety. Will definitely come back and recommend to others.
Olivia Z.,"Dana Point, CA",0,21,36,3.0,10/21/2016,"They were quite slow today. Not sure why considering there were so many people working. Getting drinks took about 15 minutes. Picking up the check, just as much time. The food was really good though and the beer was delicious. We had the flat breads and they were all delicious. The nacho flatbread was really good."
James S.,"Teaneck, NJ",0,10,,5.0,10/31/2016,"This place is on fire! Definitely coming back. First of all the environment is very hip and and cozy. You get this strange mixed sensation of feeling welcome and good time, I don't know what it was but it made me and my friend feel cool/good. I got these seafood tacos (grilled), one mahi-mahi, one shrimp. Real tasty, especially the shrimp one. I got a basic mixed drink but my friend got a beer they had with pumpkin flavor and a cinnamon sugar rim. He loved it. The staff is friendly and attentive. We were taken care of by a smart sweet girl whose name I believe was Heather. Anyway, I liked it, it's a good place for business reunions, dates, family nights, friends get together, anything really. Kind of like a better version of applebees but they charge around the same maybe a bit more."
Dani M.,"Wood-Ridge, NJ",47,1,,4.0,10/29/2016,"Service was great, Ryan was on top of drinks and refills. The buffalo wings were good. The burger my husband had was ok. The brisket was cold and so was the bun. The fries are really bland. I had the shrimp and asparagus pasta. The pasta was undercooked and the shrimp and the asparagus tasted like freezer. It's a brewhouse, so I think people should probably stick to pub style food like wings and burgers. Overall it wasn't a terrible experience but since they're new I'll probably come back in a few months."
Kamilla M.,"Haledon, NJ",0,8,,5.0,3/25/2017,The place has a long wait but the service is above and beyond. The kitchen felt they made an order incorrectly and sent out another order! The waitress Sarah was great and promptly removed plates as the night progressed. The food is served warm and timely. If you undecided you should defiantly chose this spot.
Kristen J.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",0,69,9,5.0,2/16/2017,"Love the food at BJs brewhouse. I've had their shrimp taco, and there turkey burgers (which are nice and juicy). It makes me even more excited that they have gluten free pizza and buns for my burger. Everyone I've went with also had a great meal as well. I would give it four stars for the service being slow but the food and their personalities make up for it. Definitely give it a shot. Just try to avoid a Friday or Saturday night cause you can wait up to 2 hours for a table."
Megan H.,"Avenel, NJ",0,10,4,5.0,4/8/2017,"I just wanted to compliment your restaurant and how great the food and service is everytime! Even bus boys/girls and other waiters who weren't our waitress kept asking if we needed anything and refilling our water! We will keep coming back here consistently based on the level of service, this place is amazing!"
Sylvia V.,"Maywood, NJ",4,24,,4.0,1/16/2017,My family and I came here for the first time. It is a very nice restaurant the staff is very well trained. Everything flowed smoothly and everyone work together as a team. I had the barbecue ribs and my husband had the seared tuna salad my son also had the ribs. The ribs were one of the best I've ever had in a long time they had a very good crust on the outside and we were tender and moist on the inside the meat was generous and it was seasoned very well that you really didn't need any barbecue sauce. The only thing I wasn't crazy about were the side dishes I selected. The roasted brussel sprouts we're very dry it seemed like they were sitting around for a while. And also I did not like the way they presented the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad it was over seasoned and overdressed with salad dressing. I was anticipating sliced fresh mozzarella and sliced tomatoes but all I got were little Marbles of mozzarella and cut up tomatoes. My husband enjoyed his tuna salad and the tortilla soup and my son also enjoyed the ribs and mashed potatoes were very good. Definitely must go for the beer nice selection. I would have given this place a 5-star if it wasn't for the lousy side dishes. And may I also add  they gave you a very cheap  amount of side dishes. But they have excellent staff and great service and because of that I will return.
Linda P.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,34,,3.0,2/27/2017,"I actually rate this place a 3.5. I have been to other locations in the US before. So I was sort of excited we were getting one. I have only gotten the pizza here anytime i went and it was pretty good. The waitress checked in with us and gave us suggestions. I had gotten the strawberry splash as a drink which was good. My friend got a burger for which she enjoyed. The pizooki's are yummy, we got the trio(cookies n creme, triple chocolate, and salted caramel). I liked the cookies and creme and triple chocolate but I can be a little biased since I love chocolate!  This place is in a nice developing shopping center. This place is comparable to unos but i like this place slightly better."
