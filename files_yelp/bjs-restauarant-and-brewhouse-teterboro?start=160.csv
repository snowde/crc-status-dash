Gretchen S.,"Leonia, NJ",0,2,,4.0,3/29/2017,Food and service is good with a nice relaxed atmosphere.  Large selection of micro brewed beers that are mostly too hoppy for me. The menu is creative.  They did have a great and I mean great quinoa and grilled salmon dish with mushrooms roasted peppers and asparagus that was to die for about a month ago.  They have since reduced the quinoa and added brown rice and left out the roasted peppers instead adding tomatoes which now makes the dish less tasty and interesting. Get rid of the rice and give me back more quinoa and roasted peppers.  This won't keep me from going back but I won't order my previously favorite dish again.
H K.,"Secaucus, NJ",0,13,,3.0,2/15/2017,"The menu/ food is pretty good. Service was on the slow side. While the waiter was nice, he walked pass us four to five times and we even made eye contact a few times to get his attention, but there was no response. Also, for some reason the hostess had a bit of an attitude and poor mannerisms."
Dan A.,"Wallington, NJ",0,13,1,1.0,3/8/2017,We where so exited of checking out this restaurant. The inside looked good and clean. We went with a group of 7. First of all 5 of us had dirty silverware which was not a great start. 2 of us order the Jambalaya and it was so overly spicy that it made the dish inedible. Another member order a steak with a baked potato. The steak was overcooked and they completely forgot the potato. We try to find the waiter to have our food remade but it was easier to find a needle in a haystack than the waiter. We just gave up paid our bill and left never to return.
Anthony B.,"Nutley, NJ",81,40,17,3.0,2/1/2017,"Wifes birthday party of 8... called at at 12PM to make 630PM reservation ... arrive they lose they reservation.. 15 min wait and was seated. Plenty of beer to pick from . Service was a little slow but was also very busy for a Wednesday night. I will have togo again to re edit my review. The food was OK... ribs were somewhat tasteless, fried calamari for appetizer was very salty and the marinara sauce tastes like ragu."
Michael E.,"West Orange, NJ",1,30,10,2.0,11/12/2016,"I usually wait until my experience with a restaurant is complete before reviewing it, but in this case, unfortunately, I have time to kill. It's been 45 minutes and I'm still waiting for the one thing I ordered, an appetizer, to be served. The waiter has never returned. The assistant manager who promised to correct everything also never returned or corrected anything. In my frustration, I started to leave and on my way out the door, the general manager asked what the problem was, and convinced me to sit down and try again. Now I'm waiting once more. I like BJ's, but this admittedly new location has a long, long way to go before being a place I'd recommend. Perhaps after they've had some time to iron out the kinks I'll come back and try again, but not for a while. There seems to be a tremendous amount of chaos and confusion among the staff, and this was at 3pm. I can't imagine what it would be like at the height of the lunch or dinner rush. In the spirit of full disclosure, the food did eventually come, and it was perfectly decent, and they didn't charge me for it, which I appreciated, but I'd rather pay full price than go through this hassle."
Melanie R.,"Wayne, NJ",0,3,,1.0,7/1/2017,"If I could give no stars, I would. After driving by this restaurant multiple times my boyfriend and I were  excited to finally try it the other night but instead we left disappointed. The majority of the workers there are young teens who are quick to give attitudes without any regard for true customer service. Beside my table sat a couple who after telling their waitress they were unhappy with their meal were yelled at and told she wouldn't take it off of the bill. After they requested to speak with a manager, another unpleasant server walked up to the table and responded with, ""well he isn't here now so what do you want to do?!"" (WOW I thought). Besides the quality of the staff being bad, the food was also distasteful. I had ordered a BBQ pulled pork sandwich that was sent out to my table finally after 40 minutes, which was undercooked! My boyfriend had ordered a deep dish ziti that was brought to us cold. Our waitress was nowhere to be found the majority of the time which left us to ask other waitresses for napkins and silverware that had never been given to us even after receiving our food. After witnessing the lack of customer service given to others and being given countless attitudes, all we wanted to do was pay our bill and get out! When our server finally reappeared she literally threw our check onto the table and continued to walk away as if that was normal and right. After everything I felt like I was in the twilight zone! Good luck to this business and to all of its workers! Never coming here again."
Dyann C.,"Belleville, NJ",86,5,17,1.0,12/21/2016,"So here is our review... first of all we were there 2 Hours and 21 minutes for 4 people to have dinner on Wednesday night. Way too long for me. It took them 20 minutes to come over and ask if we wanted something to drink. Took forever for all the food to come out. Took another 6 minutes for them to bring our check, we waited 15 minutes for them to come so we could pay the check at which point Jamie went to the manager and got about another $30 off from complaining. Now for the food...  spinach stuffed mushrooms were the best thing I had there they were delicious I would definitely go back for them. Fried calamari was so salty it was disgusting and very chewy. We sent it back and got the avocado roll, two people out of the four liked it it was way too spicy for me couldn't even eat it. It did not look like the picture. Jamie and I got grilled shrimp over quinoa bowl with asparagus mushrooms peppers onions etc. I thought the quinoa and all the vegetables are good the grilled shrimp was not grilled it was pretty much just boiled. Jamie didn't like the dish at all. Judy got the jambalaya that she couldn't even eat because it was way too spicy Jamie tasted it said it was way too spicy I totally stayed away from that. The manager ended up taking this off the bill. Pete got New England clam chowder and he had no complaints about it he liked it. Onto dessert... We had the Pizookie's.. My favorite was the triple chocolate you know me I love chocolate so it was great. The snickerdoodle which is seasonal was everybody's favorite, nice with the cinnamon, least liked was the cookies and cream the cookie seems to be not totally cooked so it tasted like raw cookie dough.  Overall I would not recommend this place. The reviews on yelp were three out of five stars. Our waiter was very nice but slow as shit! It's a new place it's a chain so we gave it a try!"
Nicholas P.,"Brooklyn, NY",103,1,,1.0,12/18/2016,Awful salty microwaved food. Waiters fucked up our orders 3 times. Might as well go to Applebee's shit is trash.
Em V.,"Hackensack, NJ",0,3,1,4.0,11/28/2016,"It might've been because it was mostly empty but our waiter was very attentive and friendly. We had margarita, beers, stuffed mushrooms, grilled cheese and deep dish baked ziti. It is somewhat on the pricier side for what you're getting, $15 for a smaller dish of ziti. Grilled cheese and ham was a tad salty but no real complaints. Hubs had the cookie/pie/ice cream thing that I was told was ""real good"". Tasty enough and the menu is extensive! Will be back for sure. Glad to have a place to go besides Paramus."
Salvo L.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",13,1,,2.0,12/28/2016,"We stopped in on Tuesday night around 9:30 pm with a party of 10 and were told we had to wait 40 minutes for a table. We asked them if they could set a table for us in the adjacent room where several tables were empty and the manager told us he wouldnt have a waiter to cover it. When we told them we were going to leave because we couldn't wait that long, just liked that the manager worked his magic and was able to setup the table and find a waiter to work it.  Our waiter was fast in showing up to take our orders but took the order for half of us and came back after 10 minutes to take the rest of the order. It took them a very long time to bring our drinks. Some of them came after we were almost finished with the appetizers the others were served with our entrees. By the way our drink order consisted of 2 pitchers of beer and 2 margaritas. Our biggest disappointment came with the entrees......5 of us ordered the bacon-guacamole deluxe burger, all 5 of them were cold in the middle, all of them were either medium or medium rare so you can imagine the taste of cold rare meat. I honestly don't believe they make fresh meat burgers, I think they microwave precooked frozen patties, either that or they must have been sitting on the kitchen countertop for a very long time.To be fair I have to say that we made them aware of this issue and they offered to bring us something else but we refused. If I ever go back it's only for the beer selection, which earned the 2 stars."
Juana R.,"Bronx, NY",0,10,,2.0,6/26/2017,"A friend invited me to this restaurant over the weekend. I thought it was important to talk about my experience. The place was pretty. Very packed. The hostess at the front who took my name was kind and friendly.  Because there was a long wait, we decided to sit by the bar. We were helped by gentlemen the whole night at the bar who acted like he hated his job and can care less to lose it. First of all, The first think we order is sparkling and he puts the glasses in front of us and the bottle and doesn't bother to open it. We waited and waited and then asked if he could open the bottle for us and he did with the comment "" I don't know why people expect us to open it. It's pretty simple"". I know how to open a bottle of champagne. But yet I've never experience going to a restaurant that doesn't open it for you. We had to keep approaching him to order a drink or food. He didn't bother asking us what we wanted. If everything was good. If we needed something else. Even after the drink was empty and the plates were empty. He didn't bother once. He left all the empty plates and glasses pile up on the bar. He didn't bother taking it away. When we ordered a frozen margarita and all the other drinks, He didn't even put a straw. All the drinks he made that night for us and for other people kept spilling. It would overflow and wet everything. I wanted to record him so that management can see the money they lose with all the spilling but I didn't want to seem rude. The service provided by this gentlemen was horrible. And for the that I will not be going back. The fact that he think its okay to act the way he did is not okay with me."
Yvette E.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",0,9,3,5.0,11/1/2016,The first location I went to was in Florida. Such a great atmosphere and service. They're ambiance is perfect for a night out with your family or if you want to catch a game with your friends. The food selection is immense and for the most part what I've tasted is the delicious. Their beer selection is great! I would definitely recommend for you to visit! I'll be going back
Paola A.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",0,2,,5.0,11/5/2016,"Delicious food, great service, and the beer selection was  impeccable! Loved the sling they have for a baby's car seat! Can't wait to go back!"
Jerry G.,"Ridgewood, NJ",0,15,,5.0,10/25/2016,"Attractive restaurant; friendly waitstaff and bartenders. Great menu selections and many brews on tap. We had the BJ's custom brews which went down easy, plus several appetisers (crispy calamari plus the flatbread nachos). All was great and tasty! We will be back!"
Carol S.,"Clifton, NJ",0,3,,5.0,11/4/2016,"We walked in today expecting something like an average chain restaurant experience like applebees or chilis but walked out with an amazing experience. Walking in the place was crowded, there was a 30 minute wait, which we expected since it was a Friday night. We got seated and right away our server Anna came to greet us. Since we haven't ever been to BJ's she recommended some of their beers that they brew and they were very tasty and unlike many others. She managed to give me a sample of probably my favorite beer that I ever had(Jeremiah red) we were very pleased with her recommendations from the beginning, we did try her appetizer that she recommended (stuffed spinach mushrooms) and they were great. Anna was always there to refill our drinks and always took care of anything we needed, her recommendations were excellent and I would definitely come to eat here again!"
Joe S.,"Manahawkin, NJ",2,3,5,2.0,11/20/2016,"My girlfriend and I went out with another couple for dinner a few weeks after their opening and we were not impressed at all. The food is mediocre, and way over priced, in my opinion. We had ordered 2 appetizers, 4 meals, and a couple of beers/mixed drinks each. The apps (boneless wings and potstickers) seemed to be fresh out of the microwave and on to the plate. The drinks were fine, but you can't really mess those up. Now my meal (jambalaya) wasn't bad, very spicy, but I enjoyed it. The other 3 meals were not so good (3 ribeye steaks) which were flavorless, over-cooked, tough and just boring. They come with a choice of 2 sides and soup or salad as well, which weren't anything to talk about. Once the check came we were all surprised by the total which was $215! For that price we could've gone to Segovias in Little Ferry, or La Cambusa in Garfield and spent around the same for way better quality food.  All in all, I would not come back here, too over priced for the low quality food."
Clay B.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",72,4,1,1.0,1/11/2017,"I'm just having the worst time picking places. I saw this place a couple times while driving by and I figured I'd give it a try. I got wings and spinach and artichoke dip. The wings were ok way too salty. The ranch that came with them was unbearably salty as well. The dip was not bad but it was presented so ugly. I couldn't help but laugh. The bowl was only filled halfway but there was burnt crusts on the edge of the bowl and like 3 little sprinkles of parmesan cheese on top. Then the food came, I got a burger. Half of it was median and the other half was well and overall it was too salty. My friend got fried fish tacos, they smelled so fishy when they were set in front of us. For some reason 3/4 of the fish was battered and the pieces that were battered, it was barely hanging on. It was actually funny how bad everything was. On a positive note, the berry cider was good and Reina, the bartender was super nice. Id probably come back for her but nothing else. Definitely eat before you come in."
Robert A.,"Rochelle Park, NJ",19,114,5,3.0,11/24/2016,I have visited the new location in Teterboro twice now. The first visit everything was great and I had high praise for them.  I just made a second visit and it seems someone in the kitchen has developed a very heavy hand with the salt.  I can say this for certain because I ordered the exact same food as on my first visit and the salt was so bad I had to send one of the meals back with specific orders that NO salt be used.  It came back better (at to an edible level) but was still on the salty side.   I hope they can fix this problem soon as I will only go back for one more try and I really like the food when thyey go easy on the salt.  They also screwed up the bill. The printed version of the bill was delivered to the table and I then used the mobile pay on their app so I could apply my points to lower the bill.  I had a copy sent to my home email and when I looked at it they charged me twice for the dish I sent back.  They should have comped it but instead they chargeds me twice. I sent them an email to get it corrected and will have to wait and see.
