Chad C.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",132,233,294,4.0,10/5/2017,First visit to BJ's and not the last. The menu is insanely large. So many options to choose from.  The atmosphere is awesome and the open floor plan works with this type of restaurant. We really enjoyed BJs and sent a handful of our friends to go and enjoy this establishment.  I highly recommend BJs during football season.
Sweta P.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",5,12,,5.0,10/6/2017,Everytime we have been here the food and service has been spot on. Absolutely love their Avocado egg rolls. Plenty vegetarian options for vegetarians.  Their home brewed beers are great too. Ambience isn't too loud but just perfect even for a big game night.
Rachel L.,"Tenafly, NJ",386,163,886,3.0,5/24/2017,"Cool place for a casual night out. Two of us came in on a weekday night around 7:30 without a reservation. We waited about 10 min to be seated, which was not bad. The first thing I noticed upon entering the dining area is that this place is huge! There are TVs all around playing sport games. As it should be, considering that this place is new, this place is clean. I don't know how long that will last, but it's definitely a plus.  We had steak andjambalaya, which had good flavors. The jambalaya was a little too salty, so if they can accommodate salt on the side instead."
Andrew L.,"Fort Lee, NJ",42,107,134,3.0,11/13/2016,"We came in for a weekend lunch about 3 weeks after they opened. The space was surprisingly small, considering the size of the building. Still, our party of 3 didn't have to wait to be seated. At first, I was amazed at the thickness of the menu. There seemed to be a lot of choices but unfortunately nothing pops out at you. Even though there's a lot of variety, there isn't anything extra creative about their food. And for what you get, the price is just a tad too high. Service was good and we were checked on a regular basis. Where we were seated, the booths were a little too close to the high seated tables so getting up to go to the bathroom (which is very nice) was a bit of a hassle. I ordered the baked ziti which was tasty but nothing to rave about. Across from me, my friend's clam chowder in the sourdough bread bowl looked alright. He said the soup was good but for what he was paying, it wasn't enough. I decided to finish with their signature pizookie, their take on the Uno's deep dish cookie sundae (which Applebee's has a variation of now as well). The cookie was too chewy on the bottom and edges, and was also a little dry. That made it feel like there wasn't enough ice cream. The server said it was my fault that I didn't like it. I might give it one more try next time."
Tiffany S.,"Elizabeth, NJ",74,6,,5.0,10/15/2017,"Ever since BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse opened in New Jersey I find myself going once a month, well honestly every other week. In regards to the service, no complaints. If there was ever a mix up with the orders the servers have been more than willing to help and change things. I've also been provided wonderful suggestions on multiple occasions. The wait time depends on the time of the day, nothing too exaggerated.  Now when it comes to food, everything is great! I have yet to find a disappointing dish and there's great variety of vegetarian dishes. As of now the Barbacoa Cauliflower Tacos are my absolute favorite and for dessert any of the pizookis are a good choice. Being a big fan of beer I especially enjoy their Totonka Stout. As for the seasonal I suggest their Oktoberfest as well as their Pumpkin ale. For in house restaurant brews, they're great!"
Kyle H.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",367,230,34,4.0,4/12/2017,"Newly opened, i was very impressed with the service as well as the atmosphere.  Food/Drinks: I LOVE the fact the company brews their own beers and has all your basics. I have had their IPA, Hefeweizen, and Blonde, all of which were delicious. They have many taps though so they also offer up a great selection from other craft breweries. If you're into the hard stuff they have a full bar which they can offer up some fantastic cocktails. Food wise I've had a few things including the burger and some sandwiches. The food is definitely good but not the best I've ever had. Nothing to go home and rant and rave about but it will do the job for sure.  Atmosphere: The atmosphere is undoubtedly cool, the bar area is partitioned from the dining area which i like but it is still one large open room. The bar is huge with plenty of TVs for sports and it has a great design that is really appealing. The dining area is very comfortable and i like the fact they can text you when they are ready to seat you. Everything seems very clean and orderly both in the dining area and behind the bar. Seems like a great place to go have a drink and catch the game or go with your family for dinner. Service: Service has been great every time i go. Surprisingly it is usually packed so expect a wait on a Friday or Saturday night. Wait times were short the one time i did have to wait and the staff was all very friendly. My favorite bar tender, Ilyas, is a great dude and ALWAYS takes care of me at the bar, he knows how to hustle for sure when its crowded which i can appreciate. Last time i was there he made an awesome suggestion for a beer cocktail mixing (2) of BJ's signature beers together and it was so good! You gotta love service like that Overall this place is great, it will only get a 4 star rating for me because the food is very ""chain-like"" may i say but this place is cool and i will absolutely be back."
Annie S.,"Lodi, NJ",4,35,25,4.0,6/3/2017,"We got here around 5pm, so we beat the crowd and didn't have to wait for a table. We ordered the kids' meals first {chicken tenders, fries, and spaghetti}. The tenders were good, fries were warm, and I didn't get to try the spaghetti, but my daughter ate it all so I take that as a sign that it was good. I ordered the california​ chicken club sandwich with garlic aioli on the side and hubby ordered the pulled pork. I also substituted the swiss for provolone since I'm not a swiss cheese fan. My sandwich was delish. Took a bite of hubby's sandwich and thought it was good too. He like it, but said it wasn't to the point where he'd recommend someone come here for that. Our fries also came out warm, but thankfully I had requested fresh fries for my daughter so I swapped mine for hers. For dessert, I found a free pizookie offer on yelp for downloading the app so I got the chocolate chip. Sooo good, but I'm a dessert person so I could be biased  We had a good experience aside from the fries being warm and our server forgetting about us towards the end. I'd come back though since they have a very extensive menu that hubby and I want to try."
Christian L.,"Ridgefield, NJ",104,95,174,4.0,9/4/2017,This is a great spot to watch a game and the planes at Teterboro airport.   They have a great variety of different beers on tap. The burger I ordered for lunch was very good. Mg wife enjoyed a flavored soda and she said it was very good. I'm sure I'll definitely be back in the future. I seriously can't wait to try more of their many menu items.
Anthony B.,"Lodi, NJ",31,135,2,3.0,11/12/2017,"Just a chain restaurant with average food, but a superior drink program.  Ordered the deep fried cheese burger thing, and while it seemed great on paper it was next to impossible to eat.  The buger was soggy with oil, falling apart, and severely lacking flavor.  Dessert is great though so that's a plus, and the craft beer menu is nice considering this is a chain restaurant.  I'd come back again but be more careful with what I order."
Jennifer V.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",212,151,147,4.0,1/7/2017,"Finally came here a few weeks ago, I was waiting for it not to be super packed anymore although it still gets really busy on the weekends. For starters the menu is insanely huge...it's like a book. Bigger than the cheesecake factory's menu minus the advertisements.  It was a bit overwhelming but everything was categorized so well and looked amazing.  They have a nice selection of craft beers and also beers brewed by BJ'S themselves.  My friend and both ordered Alabama Slammer for a cocktail. Well I loved it! I had two of them. I decided to go with pizza...i had the spicy pig tavern cut pizza. It was huge but I wanted it all to myself lol. I hate a little more than half and took the rest to go.  It consisted of  ham, smoked bacon, pineapples, and jalapeños.  It was pretty spicy but worth it.  Overall though the menu has everything from pizza to burgers to pastas and ribs, steaks, chicken etc. appetizer, small plates, soups ..and on on. I need to go back a bunch of times to try a little bit of everything.  Our waitor that evening was very attentive and informative, so kudos! This place is definitely what Teterboro needed...there isn't any restaurants in the area and I'm so glad that BJ'S opened here. But fair warning it does get very packed on the weekends especially before 9 p.m. so do expect a wait but you won't be disappointed."
Nihal B.,"Lodi, NJ",14,7,,4.0,12/2/2017,"Good environment, good quick bites fine beer! The service in the other side is excellent. Distant enough for privacy, attentive enlighten to get your needs in time! Price was it is average. My favorite is thin pizza!"
Grisma B.,"Wood-Ridge, NJ",67,18,13,4.0,6/17/2017,"Good food and beer. The ginger beer was my favorite! So good - subtle ginger taste with a refreshing sweetness! Loved it. My husband had a flight and the berry beer was pretty good too! He had the jalapeño burger which he said was delicious. I had the vegetarian deep dish pizza. I felt like the pizza was slightly cold. It was okay, most likely I wouldn't get it again. We also split the small snack couscous Mac and cheese, that was delicious! I would definitely get that again.  The restaurant was packed. My husband put us on the waiting list so we only had to wait 30 mins as opposed to the regular wait time of over an hour. The service felt slightly slow, but our waiter was very friendly. I think it was probably slow as the entire restaurant was packed.  Will definitely go back for the ginger beer and Mac and cheese!"
Tyler L.,"Wanaque, NJ",185,1460,1280,3.0,1/29/2017,"For a gastropub in the middle of a big parking lot for the shopping center, it's fairly good. The beer selection here is great with a good balance of a ton of styles from their own brewery and outside brews as well. The beer was good, but nothing stood out as fantastic. The Amber was probably the best while the Octoberfest and Lager were pretty mild and bland. The IPA was at least flavorful, but I didn't get as much citrus or floral flavor from it as others. The food is similarly just above average with good wings and ok flatbread pizza. The burgers looked good and were quite popular. Service was a bit of a mess with getting the bill with two increasingly cranky infants taking multiple tries and reminders. The space is huge and waits are short, so it's a good option for a break in a long shopping day."
Jefferson C.,"Hasbrouck Heights, NJ",0,3,,5.0,9/24/2017,First time here and the experience was great  . The environment was amazing and what a food that they have here  .  Great place to have a good time and food and if you live around the area  or visiting  and don't know where to go  I honestly recommend you BJ'S..
Alicia S.,"Clifton, NJ",6,4,4,5.0,5/29/2017,"Another great dinner at BJ's!  Tried the pork chop this time.  Fantastic!   So far, I haven't been disappointed.  The food and the beer are great!  Bartenders are knowledgable on what they're serving.   The servers are helpful and friendly."
Desiree H.,"Teaneck, NJ",2,18,2,5.0,11/12/2017,"There beer glazed ribs are so good it crazy , all there food is good there and omg the poozokie it's wonderful"
Mikey K.,"Little Ferry, NJ",152,100,99,4.0,1/17/2017,"Lots of beers on tap is always a plus. This place gets packed, so managed to only grab seats at the bar. Takes a bit to grab the bar tender's attention, only two for a long bar but they try to be fair. Had the pizza with the works, and also a side of spinach/artichoke dip.  The dip was forgettable and the pizza was okay.  They serve chicago style, deep dish.  Food came out pretty fast which was nice. Menu is pretty big, will have to try to check out other items but if it gets packed house like this on the regular, will need to call ahead of time for a reservation."
Lorena S.,"Rochelle Park, NJ",54,74,116,4.0,11/20/2016,"Stopped in with a friend for some small bites and a drink.  The staff was friendly and courteous and the food was out within 15 minutes.  We ordered the fried artichoke, chips and guac and the California flatbread pizza ...it all hit the spot.  My fave was the the flatbread...crust was crisp along with the bacon and cheese melted just right.   I had one of their cocktails..which turned out to be dessert because it was a little too sweet for my taste.   Overall it's a chain...the interior is trendy and the Tvs give it a more sports bar feel. I recommend for a spot to meet friends and grab a beer, or enjoy some family time.  It can get a little loud, so I wouldn't recommend serious convos...just sayin."
Danny W.,"Jersey City, NJ",66,59,36,4.0,7/10/2017,"Not bad. I enjoyed the burger I had. You really go to this spot for the beers, which do not disappoint. So many choices you will definitely find something you like. The service was great and the decor was nice as well. Good for the whole family."
Damian S.,"Dumont, NJ",188,252,272,3.0,11/29/2016,"Nice beer selection. They have roughly 10 house beers (amongst a sea of other beers on tap) and 4 house made sodas. I tried their IPA and Root Beer (non alcoholic). The IPA was pretty tasty, not the best I've ever had but certainly not bad (a nice drinkable not overly hoppy everbody kinda IPA). The Root Beer was really yummy! They offer growler fills here and I considered getting a growler of the (of all things) Root Beer (I know I was shocked too folks).  To eat I ordered the Fried Jalapeño Burger. The fries were actually quite good. Seasoning is subjective and I thought the fries were close to being perfect but maybe a bit too salty. The burger, while under cooked to what I asked, was delicious. I used to order medium rare but there were many instances where I would get just rare burgers I switched to medium. In switching to medium I had hoped to get something closer to medium rare. What I've found, now, is most places cook up so I'm stuck with medium well burgers. There are two exceptions Zinburger (see my Clifton review) and, now, BJ's. There is a Chipotle Mayo sauce on it which was drizzled and I wish I could have tasted it better. The fried jalapeños were good but I wish they were a bit spicier.  I left BJ's a fan. The three stars is rough as I think it should be closer to four but I'm weighing heavy on the fry seasoning (too salty) and (while in my favor) cooking temperature. I'm 97% sure if anyone (other than me) ordered the medium burger I recieved it would be sent back as under cooked (the burger I received was medium rare and I loved ever minute of it )."
