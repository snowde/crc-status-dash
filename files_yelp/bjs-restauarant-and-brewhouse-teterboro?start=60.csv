Steve B.,"Stony Point, NY",41,153,29,3.0,9/17/2017,"The food was excellent and the choices were many. However the lack luster staff brings me down on my review. The waiter was too busy to notice we didnt get our drinks and then blamed ""her"" for not bringing them. Asked how my food was and didnt think to ask my wife how hers was. I would go for the food but not the atmosphere"
Sarah B.,"Paramus, NJ",67,18,7,2.0,12/9/2017,"what a sh*t show this place is..the food was actually pretty good but it was everything else that was the problem. First we were told the wait was 15-20 minutes, after 30 minutes I asked how much longer and the hostess replied uh I really don't know check back in 15 mins..really? You go from 15 mins to 45. We finally got seated and the guy took our order..as we were placing our order we decided not to get a salad app since our meals came w salad. 2 mins later the salad came that we told him we didn't want..he apologized and took it off the check..another 2 mins our main course came before we got our soup & salad..our soup and salad came 2 mins after that..the waiter just looked confused and was kinda like oh well..when we got our bill we realized our steak was supposed to come w shrimp and we never got that either..it's a shame that the food was pretty good but will never go back because of how bad everything got messed up and no one seemed to care"
Tiffany Y.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",117,168,310,3.0,10/31/2016,"This place looks big on the outside but it wasn't as big as I thought it was going to be. I expected this to be two levels (not sure why..) but it was on main level with high ceilings. I came with some friends on a Sunday night to watch the football game and thought it was going to be packed. Luckily, the place was quiet (probably because it was raining) and we got seated in front of a TV... The decor of this place is nice...sort of like a high end bar. The bar is to the far left of the restaurant housing an array of beers and wines. To the middle and the right of the restaurant seats tables and booths with TV's all around which is definitely a plus for sports fans. The place is very clean and the staff was extremely friendly. I would watch yourself walking at the front of the restaurant. If your shoes are wet or if there's not real good traction on your shoes, you tend to fall or slip on the type of tile they have up front. I read a review prior to going and they said the same thing, so I definitely prepared myself since my shoes were wet from the rain. I could easily see how some people can slip on the tiles.  The food options offer pages and pages of selection. I'm not too overly fond of the menu...it reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory where there's SO many choices that you get overwhelmed by the restaurant. Our waiter came over and explained the menu to us in the fastest way possible, confusing us even more. It was mentioned that only SOME appetizers were half off during football season and how some appetizers weren't. The beers were also explained the same. Seeing so many options from burgers to pizza to deep dish pizza to shrimp tacos to wings to steak to fish, I couldn't continue to look at the menu anymore without being overly indecisive. I opted for the gluten free pizza, whiles my friends got a deep dish, a bison burger, and a French dip sandwich. The food portions are large and definitely enough for leftovers to bring home. My gluten free pizza was delicious, but a little bit too oily. My friend ordered a mini sized deep dish pizza (they come in 4 different sizes) which consists of 4 small slices of pizza. Since the pizza she got was loaded with chicken and other stuff, she was overly stuffed with the mini sized. The bison burger was thin with thick buns, topped with onions and green chili (which you can ask to not get). The food was surprisingly good since I went in there with low expectations.  The staff was also extremely friendly. Our waiter was super chill and made sure we got everything we needed. He apologized when he didn't bring us a second order of a mini deep dish and charged us for it. When the  bill and we went over everything, we told him we never got the second deep dish pizza and he apologized a million times and got their manager involved to apologize as well. It wasn't a big deal for us since everyone was already so full, but it was an appreciated gesture that the manager acknowledge the mistake and apologized.  Overall I  think this place is reasonably priced with a great selection of alcohol.  Truthfully, I'm turned off by the selection on the menu because there was so much going on. I also wasn't too happy about the tiles in front of the restaurant because it could cause problems if someone falls. I don't think this is a place I would go to ALL the time but I would come back again to try the rest of the menu."
Sara K.,"Parsippany, NJ",214,11,102,4.0,10/23/2016,"This was my first time at this restaurant all together, and I was pleased with everything. The wait was about 25-30 minutes on a Sunday night around 5:45. There were many people waiting and management made an awesome judgment call to have one of the servers go around to the people waiting with free samples of their pizza! Really good call whether it's a brand new spot or an ancient mom and pop shop. I had the Bloody Mary which was okay. It's a premise mix so nothing amazingly flavorful. Then, as an appetizer we decided to get a mini pizza instead of the standard apps. Since it's not a standard app, our entrees actually came out first without the pizza app coming out at all. Management came over and apologized but it wasn't a big deal. For a new quality place, that's a minor glitch.  I had the jambalaya and it was delicious and had a good kick as it should. My boyfriend got the spaghetti and meatballs and that was pretty good also considering it's not a specialty Italian place.  For dessert we did the trio pizookies. The cookies and cream and white chocolate macadamia were really good.  Overall, loved it and definitely plan on coming back."
Ms J.,"New York, NY",0,140,3912,5.0,9/16/2017,"Wow, so glad we came here for dinner!!! Our server, Mike H. was so attentive, friendly, patience and kind! Gave us amazing food recommendations. And all the food is made from scratch and it came out in such a quick timely manner!!! Thank you so much. We will definitely be back. Our family was very pleased with the outstanding food and service!"
Katrina D.,"Lodi, NJ",222,83,68,3.0,3/11/2017,This place is a hit or miss. Sometimes their food is good and sometimes it's just meh. However something that's always a hit with people is their pizza. I've got to give them that. Their pizookies are alright it's not as hyped as they make it out to be. I would stick with the burgers and ribs at this restaurant. I do have to give it to their staff they tend to hire very nice staff for the most part.
Kimberly M.,"Dumont, NJ",42,49,456,3.0,4/3/2017,"This place is pretty much alright. Though, not much of a brewhouse if you ask me. I guess I'd be more impressed with their beer selection if it were a smaller place, but for a restaurant chain the menu seemed pretty small. The food is good in a neither here nor there sort of way. For the most part lacking excitement. But what they do have to offer are their pizookies, all of which I intend to try. Service was basically attentive overall."
Clara R.,"Garfield, NJ",0,1,,1.0,12/1/2017,Food literally tasted like ass. It was absolutely horrible greasy and just gross. Our waiter was fantastic thou
Paulette M.,"Hackensack, NJ",184,24,8,4.0,2/23/2017,"I checked this place out on a Wednesday night.  Boy were they busy! Our service was great.  She was very attentive and went through the menu with as if we were lost puppies lol. I like their daily specials. We went on a night of $10 burgers, unlimited fries and $4 beers. However, I settled for the wedge salad and tomato bisque soup. The salad was ehhhh. The tomato bisque soup was bomb! I was surprised to know the soup was unlimited. Kudos to that!"
Stephanie M.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",264,24,5,3.0,6/10/2017,"I would like to give the benefit of the doubt to this establishment that they are adjusting through newly opening kinks.  As crowded as it was I had a great experience at the bar. I couldn't decide between a few beers and the gentleman, Ilyas, gave me two samples to try. I ended up expanding the horizons and going with a new beer! There are lots to choose from that looked interesting so I really appreciated this kind of service from the bartender, even in a high volume time! Extremely friendly too. Super impressed with the service and selection at the bar. Dinner, after we had a couple drinks at the bar we were seated for dinner. While our waiter was a kind person, we were extremely delayed in receiving our food. He did not write our order down and had to return to the table to ask us several times. Hungry people, patience is difficult! While he was great about interacting with us, this was real poor process being implemented here in the service.  The Nanuet location of BJ's had tremendously good appetizers and entrees. I chose the same items on the menu for appetizers, wings and stuffed mushrooms. Both were extremely disappointing in how tiny the food was. Only large mushrooms should make the cut. I was so excited for these tasty mushrooms I had in nanuet, and I was highly disappointed! The food was also cool. I am considering giving it another try in the future as the crowds potentially settle down. It is a great establishment with an awesome sports bar / family bar feel. Nice ambiance, super clean. Lots of tv's for sports. This place will be real great when it works through it's opening kinks."
Kim A.,"Somerville, MA",48,259,74,4.0,3/21/2017,"I thought the food was pretty good, I'd go back. We shared a few apps and I had the pizza. The wait was pretty long, but was do able and we just hung out at the bar until our seat was ready.     My husband enjoyed several of the beers he tried and I enjoyed the root beer!!"
Holly C.,"Lincoln Park, NJ",9,27,21,5.0,6/18/2017,"Food was absolutely excellent!! Service was great! Huge menu, with a million choices for all kinds of eaters ! Lots of vegetarian options. They said 45 min wait , we were seated in 20 on a busy Friday night! Food all tasted fresh & it's a little pricier but you get your moneys worth. On a side note the beer is outstanding!!!"
Y S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,49,28,4.0,5/15/2017,"First time in this location. Wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised! Good wait staff, delicious drinks & tasty meal.  We started off with the Frozen Margarita, White Peach Martini and Watermelon Mojito. All delish, but alcohol was lacking in all 3 drinks.  Appetizers consisted of Spinach & Artichoke Dip (delicious!), Ahi Poke (Eh...too heavily seasoned with soy sauce...not the best way to make it! We've tried various version of delicious Poke in Hawaii & LA).   For our meal, we had the Prime Rib set (meat was cooked perfectly, but a bit too fatty), Buffalo Burger (not as big as the picture) & the Peruvian Quinoa Bowl with Shrimp (not enough dressing, and it was just full of spinach and not enough quinoa and shrimp). All delicious, but it would have been nice if they spaced out the courses - a few minutes after the appetizers were brought to the table (which took longer than expected), they brought out the main course. Every inch of the table was covered with dishes, and we felt a bit rushed. For dessert, we tried the Pizookie which was included with the Prime Rib set. Pizookie is a cookie baked in a pan with a scoop of ice cream on top. We tried the chocolate chocolate chip cookie with chocolate ice cream and the Oreo cookie with vanilla ice cream - both delicious!"
Bill C.,"Franklin Lakes, NJ",9,2,,1.0,5/7/2017,"Stopped in for lunch had some kind of flavored ""prime rib"" sand  and my son had a pulled pork that was so bad he didn't even finish it.  Which really says it all Fries where decent    Cool atmosphere for a drink or a beer.  But food was terrivle"
Christopher D.,"Lodi, NJ",255,342,2303,3.0,1/1/2017,"I have been here 2 times since they opened up. This restaurant is good for lunch and dinner and is reasonably priced based on both of my trips here. Salads, sandwiches, and main courses with many choices for all kinds of appetites and diets and preferences. Their is a LARGE bar area as well (For all my drinkers out there) as dining room seating is provided. This is a good restaurant to go to when you want quality food and to watch the game with an array of beers and alcohols. Plenty of tv's as well to watch sports. The noise level was average but that was mainly because Giants game was on this particular evening. I would say it is kid friendly based on noise level and type of crowd. They also have a pretty solid kid menu. The negatives are service both times i have been here could have been better waiting forever to get your food and the waiter or waitress disappearing for long periods of time. Even though the friends i was with only had drinks all night and me the only entree thats not an excuse. our server in particular tonight had an attitude and made a couple of errors on orders. All that said I like the food and atmoshere and will avoid our server next time lol"
Amruta K.,"New York, NY",2,22,62,5.0,4/1/2017,"This was my first visit to this restaurant and I must say that I am in love with this place. This is a brewhouse and their selection of drinks is amazing. I had a berry cider and my husband had a hefeweizen, both of them were so good. We visited this place on a Sunday evening and this place was pretty crowded. We waited about 20 minutes to get seated. We enjoyed the food as well. This is going to be our new hangout place."
R C.,"Clifton, NJ",0,10,,5.0,8/26/2017,Delicious food at reasonable prices!  Hats off to the Chef!  Their Oasis tastes exactly like my fave San Adams Boston Lager!  And the staff are very friendly and accommodating; especially since we brought our two little ones.  Will definitely eat here often!
Billy C.,"Clifton, NJ",2,13,17,4.0,4/26/2017,"I came here with a small group (4 total) for some late evening food and drinks. The wait was only about ten minutes which went by quickly enough and we were seated by a bar-side table. Drinks: Beer: Their custom brews were very good, I had the Brown Ale and the Red. Mixed drinks: Nearly just juice --- Food: We started with the Queso with pork and Root-Beer Wings. The wings were super tasty however I wish they were not served room temp. In my opinion, the queso was pretty much just a chili. I'd have preferred it to be more discernible from a chili... or mark it as such on the menu. On to my main course, which was their signature ribs. The ribs were cooked well (mostly fall off the bone), and the sauce was very good with a little spice (very mild). I'd like to give this place another try! It was a pretty positive experience."
Lindsey W.,"Emerson, NJ",96,150,151,4.0,7/8/2017,"I knew of this restaurant but never knew there was a location closer to my house.  My boyfriend and I tried it out one night and I was impressed at their beer selection. HUGE beer menu and a pretty extensive cocktail list start off the meal. They offer great pizza, however most of their food is average. Burgers, steaks, sandwiches. I created my own burger. It came out quickly and it was good. I am just tired of looking at the same bar menu. I wish they had a different selection that maybe tasted as good as their beers."
Ed C.,"Wharton, NJ",317,3,,5.0,2/3/2017,Went for lunch and had great service. Even the managers were hustling drinks and food to tables and making sure everyone was taken care of. They even honor NJCB!  Food is great  Drinks are great  Definitely will return.
