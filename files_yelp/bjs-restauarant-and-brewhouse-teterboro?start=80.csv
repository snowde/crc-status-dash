Mary E.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",280,142,150,3.0,12/22/2016,"My family and I stopped in a few weeks ago, for a quick lunch.  It was only their third week open, so they were pretty busy.  There was six of us, so we had to wait for a few minutes, but, it was really only 10 minutes tops! The atmosphere is casual, lots of beer options, so if you're into beer/craft beer, this is definitely a place that you'd enjoy.  Their menu consists of your typical bar food, salads, sandwiches, burgers, etc.  They are known for their deep dish pizza, so we ordered one to give it a shot.  It was good, I'm more of a thin crust specialtly pizza, but, I did enjoy their pizza.   The service was as expected, being that they were only open for 3 weeks.  Our waitress did make a few mistakes while taking our order, and our short lunch, did take longer than we had hoped, but, like I've mentioned, they were only open for 3 weeks.  They were very aware of their mistakes, and made sure to apologize and make up for it.   Like any other new business, they had some kinks to work out, but, they have lost of potential!   Great location, tough parking situation though!  Give them a shot, Enjoy!"
Ron G.,"Clifton, NJ",1,2,,4.0,7/21/2017,"This is my first visit to BJ's Brewhouse and I will definitely be back.  Our server Christopher was attentive, fast and helpful.  The California Chicken Club sandwich was excellent.  My 10 year old son loved the Deep Dish Pizza and we both enjoyed the Pizookie Sampler."
Kim M.,"Pompton Lakes, NJ",9,5,,5.0,8/6/2017,We came here because my fiancés name is Bj. It was a wonderful find and the food was great as well as the atmosphere.
Marnie B.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",12,12,3,5.0,8/6/2017,So good! Omg this is our first time here and EVERYTHING was delicious! We did a bunch of apps and dessert. So good! Already can't wait to come back! Service is friendly...food beyond delicious. So happy we tried this place!
Antonia R.,"Bloomfield, NJ",4,121,3,4.0,2/16/2017,"Idk what happened to my review but i def wrote one for this place !!! My husband and I came here a few weeks ago since we kept driving past it from when it just started getting built till now that it's done lol . So we said why not give it a shot ! Well I'm glad we did ! It's obviously a chain restaurant , but a good one . Way better than an Applebee's or a Chillies . I had some pasta and chicken dish which was delicious . He had a burger which was equally as good and we shared wings (also very good) . The cucumber & mint water = amazing I could have drank a pitcher of it . I also had a glass of prosecco . It came as a cute little bottle , basically two glasses out of one bottle = also amazing and tasted great . Love all the tvs definitely good when sports are on . Parking isn't an issue there's a huge lot and parking everywhere ! Last but not least or waitress was so sweet and great !  Ps only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because  they r still working the kinks out . The place is new so the service is slower (it was also a busy football Sunday)  and our entrees came out before our app but the waitress caught it right away before we even had to say anything and apologized ! Which was amazing service in my book !   We will be back !"
Marian F.,"New York, NY",0,19,11,3.0,4/28/2017,"Came here with a bunch of friends on a Saturday night. The place was packed!  We went to the bar as we waited to be seated. Overall the experience was like a Houlihans. So many different appetizers and main courses to choose from. The pizookies are what made me want to come here though!  I had the peanut butter cookie pizookie with a scoop of ghiradelli choc ice cream and a scoop of vanilla as well. Why choose?  The drinks were delish. If you come here on a Fri or Sat night expect a long wait. I'm giving 3 stars because it wasn't out of this world, but there was nothing wrong either. I'd def come back."
Elisa S.,"Staten Island, NY",30,17,15,4.0,8/7/2017,This chain restaurant is always a wonderful dining experience. The fact that this location is right across from Teterboro airport is even better! I got to sit at a booth at the front window and see planes taking off and landing while enjoying a delicious meal.
Louis A.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",0,4,2,5.0,11/11/2017,Let me start by saying as soon as we walked in we were greeted by Dawn the hostess and she was very pleasant. After a slight wait on a Saturday night we were seated and met our waitress megan. She gave us the right attention we needed and gave us some suggestions which where great. Also they were busting their butts off which is hard to find being a business owner myself. Hats off to bj's brewhouse.
Joe F.,"Tenafly, NJ",54,182,27,3.0,11/30/2016,"Beautiful environment, great TV and ample seating. Nice addition to the neighborhood. Tremendous beer selection. I came in for a quick bite and drink and left dubious off a very limited impression. Ordered a small Happy Hour deep dish pizza for one to check out highly touted Chicago style pizza. I personally like pizza well done and asked for it well so I was a little disappointed. Chunky pieces of tomato on top were good but was hoping to be blown away,,, hardly. Tried a Heferweizen beer and Hopstorm IPA. Decent but I was hoping to say I want to rush back here, I'll go back though and give it another try with other people."
Janine K.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",2,33,,4.0,8/12/2017,"Ate here  a few weeks ago with my husband. The entree salad I had was huge and fresh, delicious. It was the Derby-style chicken cobb...I took the rest home and had for dinner. My husband had a burger and fries and said was very good. We both liked the beer list and that you have a sample of it before you commit to a glass.  Service was wonderful and nice clean atmosphere, plenty of TVs."
Arjay S.,"Manhattan, NY",326,15,2,2.0,6/18/2017,"This is a good name chain; the Green Acres location is by far the worst.  From the quality of food, presentation of food, as well as service...2 stars all around.  If you have other options, pass!!! The buss boys are the best part of service. Good job guys!"
Gary Z.,"Tomkins Cove, NY",68,4,6,5.0,4/21/2017,"Unbelievable food, outstanding serves with a smile, I ordered some apps to begin with, I decided to get the fried calamari, queso dip with chips, and mozzarella sticks. All the dishes were delicious and incredible, the texture of the calamari was so crispy and perfectly golden. The queso dip and chips was also incredible, but the best of the three apps was the mozzarella sticks. I decided to get the rip-eye medium well and it came out perfect, so juicy and perfectly cooked that I enjoyed each bit. I will definitely come back to enjoy the atmosphere and food."
Kay P.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,17,,5.0,10/26/2017,Really enjoyed this place.  It was new and clean. Service was perfect and very thorough with their iPads.  They had a decent amount of vegetarian options for myself. All the food was great and the beer flights had a lot of options. I would definitely come back here!
Stephy G.,"Palisades Park, NJ",9,69,41,5.0,1/14/2017,Amazing service - my order came out wrong and before it even landed on our table my waiter caught on and brought me exactly what I had ordered. The beers are great would def. recommend the Lightswitch Lager for anyone who loves their miller's and the Berry Burst Cider. The food was also delicious and the dessert was even better! First time here and will most definitely return.
Steve H.,"Wood-Ridge, NJ",7,15,3,2.0,12/4/2016,"We ate there when it first opened, food was surprisingly good, soups and wings espedially. Their draft craft beers were just ok but the are other local craft taps make up for any real craft beer fan's taste buds. I decided to try it again on Saturday, this time Take Out. Their website advertises curbside take out, I'm not sure exactly what that is supposed to mean, maybe one didnt get out of the car and the food is delivered to you in a preset parking space, but I went inside to pick up my order, having not see any signs or directions about this.  We had ordered through their app. Seems there is a big push by BJs to download their app and get points to be redeemed later. The cashier seemed confused when we walked in, taking a lot of time trying to figure out the app and our order and may not have been working on the job long. She wanted to know was I redeeming points, which I had not even asked about or wanted. A manager stepped in and gave us some sort of an ice cream and cookie package, which we didn't order but accepted. The manager claimed it was because we downloaded their app and it was complimentary. It wasn't until we got to our destination did we realize everything wasn't ok. So check everything before you leave. I'm not sure what the problem is over there in Take Out but when one orders a French dip and you don't include the French dip, then it's just a roast beef sandwich. Stop worrying about handing out free stuff and work on your customer service and getting your orders correct. No French dip was the first disappointment, then to find out no napkins or utensils in a take out order, which included soup and their free ice cream really stood out to say they still don't have their act together in their Take Out area. Food was ok. I would put them on par with a Chili's with a better craft beer menu. But the Take Out service is unacceptable. BJ'S has been opened about a month now here, so they should have worked out the kinks. BJ's, please keep your free stuff, stop worrying about app points, especially if you can't get the basics straight."
Bharat P.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",0,5,4,3.0,8/9/2017,"Good food ,but service slow.we order garlic bread but it was cold,we have to send back for hot one."
Sara S.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",83,69,30,3.0,12/22/2016,"I've been here 3 times already for football Sunday. So my review is just in regards to football Sunday, I have no idea how it is the rest of the week. The first time we went for a Dolphins game and we made sure to arrive early. There aren't a lot of TV's (which is why I gave this place a 3 instead of 4 star!!) so we were a little worried we wouldn't get to see our game. The manager saw us walk in and approached us saying he wasn't sure which game he would put on but since we arrived early wearing our Dolphins gear he'd put us on alongside the Giants game!! Sweet!! When we scored our first score during the game, we tried to order shots. We were having trouble deciding what shot we wanted because they didn't have a lot of our usual go-to's. Then our bartender walked up and surprised us with special shots he'd made that were Dolphins teal!! So super awesome of him to think quickly on his feet like that and give us such great customer service!!  I came back a few Sunday's later in the evening for a Giants-Cowboys game. It was pretty packed but I have to say our waitress never lost sight of us. She was very attentive the entire game, even though she had tons of big tables. I ordered the baked ziti that night and it was so freaking amazing. I wasn't sure if I should order pasta from a non Italian restaurant, for fear it would be bland or not done well. I am so glad I took the waitress's advice and ordered it!! I am still thinking about that ziti 2 weeks later!! It was soo good!!  We came back this past Sunday and had a tough time with the fact that there were so little TV's. For a sports bar, you'd really expect the entire bar area to be covered in TVs so that you can actually watch all the football games on a Sunday. The past 2 times we came it didn't really affect us but this past week was kind of a bummer having to watch just 2 games. I think more tv's in that area would really up the appeal. The food is good though and luckily the Dolphins weren't playing on Sunday so we didn't miss anything!"
Tommy D.,"Rutherford, NJ",86,24,9,4.0,12/30/2016,"My review is based on four different experiences.  We came here four time since it opened and would give it 3.5 stars if that was an option.  I called ahead and they put you on a list that can cut down your wait time significantly which is a plus. An hour and a half wait was cut to 20 minutes.  The food was very good and we had excellent service every single time.  The bar area needs some work. Bartenders made us wait a while while they BS with friends that were there. This was annoying but not the end of the world.  Different appetizer each time was tasty. I would like to highlight the full rack of baby back ribs, had them  twice and they were delicious. Thursday nights they have a rib special.  Great selection of beers on tap and wines.  The pizzookie dessert was great! We paid through the app which was a new and very easy experience.  Fun place to have a few beers and watch the game.  Considering this is a chain restaurant and this location is brand new, I was very impressed. Looking forward to coming here again!"
Muriel G.,"Teaneck, NJ",17,102,89,2.0,4/13/2017,"I will not be back to this place.  I tried it twice, the beers are whatever and the food is very salty cant do it."
Ramez M.,"Newark, NJ",25,41,10,5.0,5/1/2017,Deep dish pizza is delicious.  Very soft and light.  Prepared beautifully.  Beer heaven.  Every beer u can imagine.  Try the flight.   It's 4 5oz draft beers so u can try a variety.   Clean refreshing atmosphere.  Kid friendly too.  Gotta try it.
