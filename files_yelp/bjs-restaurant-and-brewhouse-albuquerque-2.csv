Alexis W.,"Zuni, Albuquerque, NM",110,48,211,4.0,9/7/2017,"You know, you never know what you're going to get here when it comes to the services or food. Pretty much in the past 2 years since I've moved here, it's been bad lol But this review is based off tonight's service and food.  I came in with some friends and we were sat quickly. I ordered a margarita and it was one of the best I've had. I played it safe tonight and ordered the mozzarella cheese sticks and a soup and salad. Their wedge salad is the BEST! Our server was amazing. Really wish I could remember her name. Food and drinks came out very quickly. We ordered one of the cookies  to share for desert. It was yummy as always. This visit, again, was the best in my two years of being here. I always go back to give them a try, and tonight was awesome.  Thanks again!"
Sean D.,"Albuquerque, NM",61,19,5,2.0,9/18/2017,"This is my second time here. I went when they first opened and I really wasn't impressed enough to go back. I ended up getting a gift card for my birthday and figured the wife and I would use it for a date. Unfortunately our waiter I'm pretty sure was new. I won't hold it against him, I know it takes time to learn, it did however contribute to the overall experience.  We both ordered the prime rib special. My wife usually likes prime rib, it's not something I generally order. Salads came out first. Both salads tasted funny. I think the lettuce wasn't fresh. She ordered with ranch on the side and her salad was drenched in ranch. My Caesar was also drenched in dressing, it kind of hid the bad taste of the lettuce, so I guess that's a bonus.   Our plates came out, she noticed the prime rib was really rare looking. I kind of thought it did too, but I don't know what it's supposed to look like. We both got green beans and she got asparagus. The garlic green beans were almost inedible. I like spicy foods, but these were so spicy it was gross, not something I expected from green beans. Her asparagus was rubbery and no flavor. She didn't eat much of either.  I scarfed down the prime rib. I'll eat anything meat. My wife was struggling with hers. It was really chewy , probably was too rare, and she was frustrated. She ended up choking on a piece and I had to give her the heimlich in her seat. Out came a chunk of meat and saliva/water that she choked on, all over her meal. She was super embarrassed and that pretty much ruined her eating dinner. The waiter collected the plates and noted if she didn't like her meal. We both said yeah, but didn't really want to make issue of it since he seemed new.  He brought desserts. That was about the only thing keeping this from a 1 star review. I got the peanut butter s'mores pizookie and it was super good. After the wife calmed down from her panic and choking, she had a little also and at least got to enjoy something.  Overall I hope no one ever gives me another gift card here. Fool me three times won't happen."
Tania S.,"Albuquerque, NM",218,624,1495,4.0,1/10/2018,"Much has improved with their carry out service (online and over the phone). I am in and out quickly, usually their servers are polite and chipper. It's been a big turnaround at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse now that I've been a few more times. Service at the bar is also fantastic. I love their pomegranate sangria drink! So fresh, great for any time of the year. You know what to expect at a chain like BJ's Restaurant, but it's nice when you see them go above and beyond."
Diana H.,"Albuquerque, NM",139,76,136,4.0,6/18/2017,"UPDATE 6/17/17 - I returned here because the senior manager reached out to me regarding my previous review. I was offered 2 courtesy cards to return and dine at the establishment. Upon returning, Miguel made sure to greet us warmly, apologize for the mishap, and ensure that we would not run into further issues dining there. I ordered the ahi tuna poke this time, which was good, but more reminiscent of chopped tuna, and not so much like the real poke joints around town (doused in sauce, etc).  My boyfriend had the hickory BBQ brisket burger. This was really good and huge, so it was super filling.  For our free dessert, we opted with the monkey bread pizookie. By far, my absolute FAVORITE dessert at any chain restaurant. I'd come to to eat that alone if I didn't care so much about the calories! We even received a free pint glass and 20% VIP card for Father's Day during our visit. I'm impressed by how much BJ's actually cares about their customers, and whether or not they choose to return. That seems uncommon nowadays... kudos to them!"
TUK K.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,53,8,4.0,11/26/2017,"BJs has a very comprehensive menu and beer selection.  The food is good. I had the Fire Roasted Barbacoa Chicken. It was a light, (520 calorie) but very rich dish.  I will return to try some other menu items. This place has a ""Buy a Hero a Beer"" program.  If you are Active or Retired Military,  you can search the above and request a free beer. You can also donate a beer on the same sight."
Myhan V.,"Rio Rancho, NM",9,76,59,3.0,11/14/2017,Average place to hangout and catch up with friends. Beer and alcohol selection is good. Foods is average.
Tim S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",43,159,273,4.0,4/8/2017,Stopped here for a quick dinner. Usual quality for BJ's - which is pretty good. Great selection of beers to chose from. Didn't stay long as were had been working all day and were tired so eat and drank and left due to an early flight out the next morning. Nice ambience and the waitress was very nice = helpful and quick.
Rachel R.,"Dallas, TX",722,938,2737,3.0,12/29/2016,BJ's is a run of the mill chain eatery. They have standard food and above average beer. What they lack in originality they make up for with their pizookies.  Their lunches are reasonably priced and well portioned. They were under $10 and were extremely filling.  The pizookies are what is stand out. I tried the smores pizookie this time and loved the chocolate peanut butter and marshmallow combination. Yum!
Erika S.,"Albuquerque, NM",86,44,22,5.0,1/19/2017,"I've been here more than a handful of times, and always got ok service and food. Never anything to really completely rant or rave about, just good experiences. Last night I had an amazing time though with excellent service from Greg, so I thought I'd write a review! They no longer have the veggie flatbread which breaks my heart!!! BUT, they made it for me anyway  the management came and checked to make sure the toppings they were gonna use were ok, and it tasted better! I'm glad they went out of their way to make me happy.  We had prompt and professional service and I'm now looking forward to going back."
Ashley G.,"Albuquerque, NM",206,180,2332,1.0,6/23/2017,"What the hell did I just eat? I ordered the Classic burger medium rare with sweet potato fries. It was the simplest dish in our entire to go order. I mean, the word CLASSIC is in the name, right? According to the menu, it should have mayonnaise as the sauce. Well, I'm pretty sure they used my buns to wipe up whatever sauce was spilled on the counter. Either that or they made my burger wrong and just kept remaking the same thing until it resembled the original thing. There was a small pat of Mayo with a large serving of some spicy orange tinged sauce and a spoonful of barbecue sauce on the other side. How does that even happen? I wiped it all off as much as possible because my father in law swears by their burgers and I didn't want to be the only one not eating. I tried to be a trooper but there was a reason I didn't order a cheeseburger. I HATE cheese and it really messes with my stomach. Halfway through my Frankenstein version of the classic burger, I bit into rolled up cheddar cheese. Seriously? And, of course, they made it medium well instead of medium rare despite my confirming it three separate times. They even wrote medium well on the container after all those confirmations.  I also ordered the sweet potato fries with it. These were actually worse than the burger! Each fry was burnt to a crisp and was hard to bite through. There was one fry that wasn't burnt and it actually tasted pretty good. Too bad the rest weren't edible. My recommendation? Red Robin just built a location next door. Or eat your shoe. It might have more flavor."
Todd R.,"Albuquerque, NM",4,164,199,3.0,9/15/2017,"Doing better BJs, much improved visit thank you. Don't know if they changed servers or just gave them customer service training."
Jean C.,"Albuquerque, NM",11,85,427,4.0,4/25/2017,The pulled pork sandwich is so amazing! My daughter enjoyed her BJ's burger with apple smoked bacon and cheddar. It took awhile for us to be waited on even though they weren't busy. The menu is a little pricey but I had a buy one get in free entree coupon so that cut down on the cost some.
Steph R.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,60,23,2.0,3/12/2017,"This does not reflect the FIVE STAR service we received from Miguel, the manager. He really went out of his way to rectify the issue but unfortunately, his kindness and prompt service doesn't carry the whole restaurant.  It's my first review in Albuquerque, NM & unfortunately, it's not a positive one. We love BJ's & we come for the pizookies but we do enjoy all the other food as well!  We sat down around 7:15pm & waited for our server. We ordered our drinks & food all at once. The waters came out & our server never brought silverware. I'm not sure if people don't use their silverware for calamari, but we do. We also like to use the napkin that wraps silverware. We waited about 20-30 minutes to get our food. This is uncharacteristic for BJ's. Nobody filled up our waters while we waited or informed us that the kitchen was running behind or something. When we got our food, the calamari was cold & the ""guacamole"" we ordered had large chunks of avocado & was not mixed together adequately. The pizookie was delicious! Overall, It was a very disappointing experience. We tipped the waitress anyways. She's working for her money.  The ONLY reason we will be coming back to give BJ's a chance again is because Miguel was very kind, understanding, and patient."
Ken M.,"Plainfield, IN",88,57,94,5.0,3/3/2017,I visited this chain restaurant twice while in Albuquerque and have no complaints about any part of my dining experience here.  The staff was very knowledgeable about the beer selection they had to offer. Local brews in Albuquerque and great and you must request a separate menu or you will miss them here.  The food the exceptional. Appetizers came out quickly to my surprise and my meals were always hot and fresh. The staff who tend to the bar are very attentive and can offer a lot of great advice on food choices and substitutions.  The atmosphere is great for sporting events as well as maintained exceptionally well. Bathrooms were clean and updated.
Morgan O.,"Albuquerque, NM",63,39,25,1.0,6/11/2017,"I don't even know where to begin with this review... literally... LITERALLY the worst dinner of my life with my family. So much so, that it started a fight between my family!  It's Sunday night about 7:30pm, and we were sat promptly by our hostess after about 5-8 minutes. The restaurant was really open, so they were just setting up a few tables for our group. We were waiting on my dad and my brother to show up, but we preceded to order drinks and an appetizer (an appetizer that never showed up).  Our waitress, Ariana, was prompt--at first-- but then proceeded to get slower and slower. She wasn't anymore busy than when we walked in, but was definitely giving more attention to the table behind us. They received drinks quicker from the bar and she checked on them more frequently. Then my mom's appetizer never arrived? I wasn't even aware of this until the end of our meal, but I'll return to that cluster-nightmare in a minute. Our medium sized group's order came out in sections. Large, separated sections of time between each delivery (not great for the food runners). Our waitress was no where to be found in the delivery of our food, so our orders lacked everything we asked for towards the meals. She never picked up plates promptly. In fact, still in the middle-end of dinner she began asking about dessert. We asked for a box and then three Pizookies for the table. I'm HIGHLY allergic to milk (specially that in ice cream and heavy creams) so I asked her if I could please get the ice cream on the side so I could give it to my husband or my brother instead. She said sure and then asked us how we'd all be paying (split check/single). I told her how to break it up and she walked away with an attitude. Didn't pick up empty plates, didn't ask for refills. She came back with our receipts instead, BEFORE dessert even came to the table. We weren't ready to pay yet, considering we were in the middle of everything and set them aside at least until the rest of our food arrived. Before she walked away again, I asked her for a box again--never received one, BUT I did see her walk all the way to the bar to grab a beer and bring it to the table behind us. Dessert arrived quickly, aaaand with ice cream on top. She, again, was no where to be found. The other waitress, who worked a separate section, delivered our desserts, so I asked her, ""I know this isn't your section, but would it be alright if I could ask for a box from you?"" She said a pleasant okay...and then never came back.... [internal thought: You gotta be kidding me at this point!] Finally, Ariana comes back and asks to pick up payment (again I asked for a box) and ask how the Pizookies were (in that order). We reply good and then my mom was so irritated at this point she began asking what's going on in the restaurant? [side note: my mom has worked in the service industry opening restaurants and training servers and staff around the US for over 20 years.] Just to receive some sort of explanation for her lack of initiative and overall wanting to be there and do her job, and whatever happened to the appetizer. She blamed the food runners and the kitchen staff, and then finally owned up to the error and apologized. So my mom gave her tips and let her know that if it's her staff then she's the one that's being affected and if she doesn't communicate that with her table it's then seen as solely her fault. She then made a finger gun and told me mom, ""Ya. I'll be sure to work on that."" I'm at a point where I'm so dumbfounded by her horrible behavior that I told my mom that she just needs to speak to a manager instead of telling someone who clearly doesn't want to work there. This is where the argument started within the family because my mom continue to tell me how there wasn't a manager that walked the floor once. I realized she was right.  Ariana was rude, defensive (although she had nothing to defend), and just wasn't pleasant to have as a waitress. She wouldn't refill anyone's drinks without us asking, she wouldn't pick up plates, she forgot food and extras, she never did anything with a smile or pleasant demeanor. I've never tipped below 20-30% EVER--even when we've had mediocre service in the past at places. I was a server once, I understand what tips mean, BUT that means I know what needs to go into earning a tip, Ariana overall didn't care.  So to sum up this incredibly awful night: 1. Terrible service 2. Food tasted good 3. No manager walking the floor 4. Don't expect refills 5. ...Or communication for that matter 6. To pay before your food arrives 7. Receive passive aggressive finger gun action Dear BJs, you're better than this. Train your employees some initiative and accountability."
Amy A.,"Albuquerque, NM",30,55,28,1.0,8/3/2017,"So, we walked in and we're told to sit wherever we'd like in the bar area, which is totally fine, but we sat and waited for about 15 minutes before walking out and leaving. We were not helped at all! Terrible service. I'm so sad too, I'm so hungry!!!!"
Justin A.,"Albuquerque, NM",285,45,76,1.0,8/3/2017,Was so excited for happy hour and a good dinner but that did not happen. I was seated at the bar and waited for 10 min to get a menu or at least meet my server. No one came by my table after 10 min so I left and went to Red Robin's were I was seated and served immediately in the bar. This Bj's has terrible service and I do not recommend it to any of my friends or yelpers!
Joshua B.,"Moyock, NC",115,195,232,2.0,2/4/2017,"Stopped by for a few drinks and desert before heading back to our hotel. A lot of micro-brew education going on here. I didn't realize this was a chain place.. I've been to one other BJs in Tallahassee, Florida. Anyway, the beer wasn't anything special. It seemed just ok. I liked the dining area set up and how the bar is. All he staff seemed really nice. Our waiter checked on us way too much.. haha. However everything seemed clean and well kept. This location is right across the road from all the hotel options. Makes it hard not to swing by at least once."
Lizz W.,"Rio Rancho, NM",0,12,10,2.0,7/5/2017,"Worst turkey burger ever! Service was super slow and the waiter didn't clear the plates when we were done, so there was a pile of dirty dishes during dessert.  Did I mention they weren't even busy?! Like 6 tables max!"
Martha B.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,3,1,1.0,12/20/2017,"Absolutely horrible service, every single time I come here. Never gets better and servers are rude. They give you the check before you are even done ordering, it's like they want you to leave. Do not recommend this place unless you have 2 hours to waste on eating a meal"
Claire M.,"Albuquerque, NM",72,6,3,5.0,10/24/2017,EJ Varnell is the best server! Always have the best experience with him. Make sure you get him... other Eric isn't the same.
Ann Marie A.,"Albuquerque, NM",64,26,4,2.0,7/13/2017,Bleeeck.....worst food.  The prime rib dip had bones in it.  It looked nothing like the pretty picture on the menu.   Way too greasy....
J.E. V.,"Jacksonville, NC",39,36,31,4.0,5/7/2017,"All I can say is YES! The lunch specials rock... we had pizza and salad, the pizza crust was amazing! The jambalaya was something to rave about! The atmosphere was great and the service was great as well. We've been here twice in the past week it was just that good! The only issue I had was they brought my toddler out a cup of fruit and it looked really old and possibly the strawberries had mold... they quickly replaced it and all was well!"
Sandra C.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,4,,1.0,11/18/2017,"Third time I've  had horrible service and unacceptable wait times at BJ's.  Got there at 5:00 and we were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait.  Didn't get seated until 40 minutes later and then waited another hour for our food.  All five food orders and one of the drink orders were not what we ordered.  Got couscous instead of rice, mashed potatoes (which were cold) instead of baked, tomatoes on the kids' pizza (we specifically said no tomatoes), Pepsi instead of Dr. Pepper, etc.  The waiter got flustered when we brought it up and ended up sending the manager over who gave some lame excuse and ended up taking $10 off our bill.  Will never go back."
Diane C.,"Albuquerque, NM",24,29,54,5.0,10/7/2016,We had the best waitress!! She was from Bulgaria she was awesome!! The food was great and our waitress gave us great service! We will definitely be back and hopefully have the same waitress!
Douglas A.,"Beaver, OR",0,11,,1.0,11/24/2017,Really not very good. Tried it a year or so ago and the service is marginal. Tried it again through Grubhub. Won't do it again. I was quite disappointed with the food.
Orlando C.,"Midtown/University, Albuquerque, NM",38,10,1,2.0,8/30/2017,"We got to the restaurant and was seated really fast. Our drinks came with in minutes of ordering. I had put in an order for cheese sticks, way over priced for what they serve. When we got them they were just cold like they were just sitting on a table. Our food was out in a good time however same issue cold food, I got a burger and fries and the hubby got a pizza. The burger was same but kinda thick and room temperature with cold fries. The pizza was cold also the only part that was hot was the center. At the end of the meal I order a new batch for of fries and they were the only thing that were hot when it came to the table. In conclusion the food is prompt but just come out cold . Don't think I'll come here for food."
Andrea S.,"Santa Fe, NM",0,4,,3.0,11/19/2017,"Good clam chowder and slider appetizer was good. However, the prime rib was tough. At time I could not even cut through to get apiece of meat.  Beer was god, got their Blonde, made o good martini.  Decent service. Took twenty minutes to get dessert. Good bar food but do not venture beyond that."
Melissa G.,"White Rock, NM",32,129,276,1.0,12/28/2016,"We didn't feel very welcomed here. Came in and was seated promptly, however we were ignored by every waiter that walked by. After waiting for a bit and not even getting any water or drink orders we walked out. I have been to this location a couple of times and this was a first.  I will return to BJs however not at this location."
Ashley H.,"Albuquerque, NM",14,47,21,5.0,2/21/2017,"Decided to stop here for dinner after doing some shopping at Target. Our waiter Mark H was great, very attentive and friendly. The food and drinks we ordered came out very quickly and were very delicious, I had the bacon avocado burger and my husband had the ziti, the burger was juicy and savory, my husbands meal was very flavorful and cheesy! Also the Alabama Sunset I ordered was delicious!"
Angie G.,"Albuquerque, NM",3,22,11,1.0,3/11/2017,"I've been here several times and while the food is fine, just like every other chain restaurant, it's always a pain to get a table. This most recent time, I even made a ""reservation"" which turned out to be just call ahead and took 45+ minutes to get a table. Then the waitress was in way over her head and our food took a long time, as well. If you have a choice, go somewhere else. There are plenty of breweries with way better beer, any way."
Cindy M.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,2,1,2.0,8/3/2017,"This used to be a great place to eat when it first opened. The food sucks...taste, presentation, beware of what you order. NEVER order the fries, the jambalaya (VERY VERY SALTY), sliders...."
Lillian L.,"Albuquerque, NM",25,3,,2.0,7/28/2017,"First  time here.  Forgot my husbands salad, yet charged him for it.  Food was ok.  I ordered green chili for my chicken sandwich.  I dont know what waitress brought out, but not hatch green chili.  First and last time evet. Waitress was super nice"
Tosha B.,"Falls Church, VA",165,388,417,3.0,3/8/2016,"BJ's is a chain restaurant that is a step above a TGI Fridays, in a good way. My favorite things at BJ's are the beer and their dessert. I know this is a restaurant, but the food gets third place for me.  They brew their own beer which is a major plus and have a great variety of beers to choose from. I went with their IPA and really enjoyed the taste. It was hoppy, but not too hoppy and had a great finish. For dessert I went for the chocolate chip pizookie and was in heaven. It's a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie mini cake topped with vanilla ice cream. It comes out warm and it's delicious. You definitely want to save room for dessert and since the food isn't the best here, that's not a hard thing to do. Finally to the food.....I like that that have a large menu with many choices and even have gluten free options and light options. But the quality of the food isn't superb. It appears that a lot of their food is frozen. The food is ok, but don't fool yourself to think you're dining at a Michelin star restaurant. For a chain restaurant, this is a step above the rest and a great place to get good beer and dessert."
Jim C.,"Santa Fe, NM",16,165,,3.0,12/17/2016,"Meh. I ordered a s pellegrino and the server put the bottle on the table unopened- they require a bottle opener- and with no glass and hurried away.  The ribeye was tough but kind of ok. Not much taste to it for a Texan. Caesar Salad was just barely average.  I also had an asparagus salad but it was almost all greens with a few cranberries. I think it had a few sliced mushrooms, not sure what they were. No identifiable asparagus, though."
Ridin T.,"Los Lunas, NM",0,23,,1.0,9/29/2017,"They need more wait staff. The folks are overwhelmed because they are understaffed. I use to love this place for the beer selection and food; but face it, if you can't order you won't eat, then you won't spend money and guess what YOU MAY NOT COME BACK!!!!"
Anita H.,"Ojai, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/29/2017,We ordered food from here through grub hub. It was terrible.  My wife ordered the nachos and paid to have chicken added to them.  The chicken was missing.  You could tell they had been sitting for awhile they were not hot and also soggy.   Our drinks had melted ice in them and were sort of flat.  Again had obviously not been delivered promptly.  They forgot to add the ice cream to our monkey bread pazzoki.  We called Grubhub and they called the restaurant and they refused to refund our order or at least what we had paid for that was not delivered.  Grubhub however refunded it from their end so 5 stars to them.  Will never eat here again.  Either take out or in person
Ashley C.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,2,,2.0,7/7/2017,"If I didn't like the food and the draft selection. I would not be a continuing patron of this restaurant. The service is awful. Every server I have encountered appears to have an attitude. The service is slow. Always sit at the bar if you want friendly and prompt service. Ive sat in a booth and wait for 20 minutes before a server even said hello. Called and tried to do To Go orders and shown up at the store to be told ""we have no order for you, but we can start one now."" It's disappointing to see a place with an incredible menu have such terrible hospitality and customer service."
Samantha W.,"Albuquerque, NM",108,3,,4.0,5/8/2017,"Great selection of food and drinks. Every time we go the service isn't always the best, but the good food usually helps make up for it. We love Breweries and they have a ton of Beers on tap not just their own."
Rod B.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,3,,5.0,9/25/2017,Great food experience. Was served by Moriah; excellent customer service.  Salads were nice and crisp. Hope to return again soon.
