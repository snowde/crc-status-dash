D.G. H.,"Mount Juliet, TN",221,55,9,2.0,4/3/2014,"Here is a place that has decent apps and beer, and even decent home made sodas (root beer and cream soda, everything else should be skipped."
G L.,"Santa Fe, NM",0,9,1,5.0,5/19/2015,First time to the new BJ's by Cottonwood mall. The BBQ pulled pork sandwich was delicious and the prices seem reasonable. Waiter was friendly and we were checked on a couple times during our meal. Will definitely return.
Skyler S.,"Albuquerque, NM",546,5,,5.0,6/23/2015,It was a great experience! The food was great we had the house salad and a deep dish pizza. The waitress Christina was wonderful she was fast efficient and the best service we've ever had at this restaurant. Also if you go on Tuesday it's half off wine glasses or bottles!
Lisa R.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,4,,1.0,8/9/2015,"Ugh, My boyfriend and I went in late Tuesday eve and he waited 25 minutes for his first beer on tap with no explanation or offer within that time to change his beer order. Waitress only avoided our table during that time. Then, when said beer came out her explanation was something about the hoses, I don't know or care I'm not a bartender but with no acknowledgment it was unacceptable, she just avoided our table during the 25 minute wait. I then asked to speak to the manager who was just as unprofessional in his mannerisms and speaking skills and went through the same explanation with no acknowledgment that waiting 25 minutes wasn't cool ""lemme buy you a beer "" at the very least. Then once our soggy avocado eggrolls came out I had to ask the waitress for a napkin and was given two cocktail napkins, really wow ?? I then called her back, thinking she would've brought set ups earlier, and asked her for two BIG napkins and two forks, feeling like I was making a request to my boyfriends four-year-old son...what a mistake will not go back. When leaving I needed to use the ladies room, thank goodness or I would've lost my appetite as two toilets were backed up, icky stuff on the counter tops with both trashes overflowing. In Albuquerque I will stick with Applebee's who at least takes care of the customer when they do screw up so that you keep coming back. And the waitresses know that when you have food you need a napkin and a fork. I have eaten at this chain in California and know  it's good but this location needs to get it together, hopefully it was just a bad night but after reading the other comments probably need a new manager."
Donald B.,"Albuquerque, NM",361,25,14,1.0,9/25/2013,"Burger was SO overcooked that it begged for ketchup, mayonnaise and forgiveness! The wheat bun was so dry that it should have been renamed toast!"
Tino S.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,1.0,3/7/2016,"The service was terrible. We sat (party of 4) in the bar area because the hostess sold us on the happy hour menu and speedy service. We waited 10 min. Before being greeted. Getting our drinks and meal took even longer. Two out of the four meals/orders were wrong. There was one waitress for the entire bar area which was full. There were multiple other waitresses standing around but did not seem too interesting in helping. The manager (my assumption based on his dress and mannerisms with the employees) never made an attempt to help or visit with his customers even after witnessing our dissatisfaction with our meals. In the time we were there, we noticed another customer get up and ask the bartender for plates so he and his wife could eat their appetizer. Another family requested to be moved to the regular seating because service seemed quicker. Over the worst experience at a restaurant. The worse part is that the waitress didn't seem to care! Why should she, her manager didn't."
Sarah P.,"Littleton, CO",10,8,2,2.0,4/28/2013,"The food was good. The menu is ridiculously huge so there pretty much is something for everyone. However, the service wasn't so good. It was slow and our waitress was unfriendly and indifferent. Customer service definitely needs work."
Glen M.,"Tijeras, NM",0,25,,4.0,6/19/2014,"Come here at least once a week.  Enrolled in their rewards program.  Wife has either scallops or a 5 oz. pub burger; I always have the 5 oz. pub burger--we've  never been disappointed with the food or service.   No hassle or upcharge if you want to change fries to a salad Hopstorm IPA is our favorite; it's not La Cumbre or Nexus, but it's pretty darn good.  Beer's imported from AZ, we were told--once their other location on the westside opens, they'll brew here   Tanks are now used for rootbeer, etc. They have local draft craft beers available, but they're much more expensive than their own."
David D.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,8,,1.0,10/31/2014,"So my experience goes like this... We reserved a table of 20 and arrived at 4:30, they refused to seat us until 1/2 the party was there even though it was really early and the place was empty. Then we couldn't order happy hour specials unless we were in the bar area so we had to go up to the bar to get the happy hour specials. Then our waitresses kept asking if more of the party was coming like they needed more tables it was still empty. Then our portions were much smaller than when they first opened up and slopped into our plates. To top it off one of our friends got good poisoning!! Also they wouldn't let anyone sit on the patio even though it was a beautiful evening. It's a joke there!!"
Robert C.,"Kansas City, MO",0,30,,1.0,8/6/2013,"The chicken sandwich is actually a chopped and formed chicken-like substance served pink inside.  The ground beef is described as USDA Angus, which is similar to what Burger King called its pink slime.  Their lobster tail was pretty good."
Tamara F.,"Albuquerque, NM",7,9,2,4.0,12/26/2012,"Yes...great place! Good food, friendly staff. They were busy and bar got a bit backed up but that's a new place working out the kinks. I went with friends for a holiday dinner. We ordered a variety...salad, pizzas, wings and the cookie n ice-cream dessert,  pizooki....all delicious. Huge menu, can't wait to return and try more.  Good beer too."
Terry T.,"Aurora, CO",4,13,1,4.0,9/6/2013,We were attending a reunion at the nearby Sheraton Uptown Hotel prior to and over the 2013 Labor Day weekend.  We almost didn't go because of the negative reviews but are we ever glad we did!  We dined at the bar and had a great time interacting with the bartenders and returned a second time!  The food was good and the beers and the service were excellent!  It is a brew pub for crying out loud ... Get over it you pompous and rude yuppy reviewers!
James H.,"Albuquerque, NM",42,184,71,3.0,5/13/2013,"Not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.  I had their ""deep dish"" single pizza, which was actually more of a Pizza Hut style pan pizza (but with less grease) and tons of toppings.  Their IPA was below average.   Overall I give it a solid ""meh""."
Rachel B.,"Rio Rancho, NM",5,3,,1.0,11/15/2012,"Stay home.  I always say that if a restaurant has too many items on the menu - they all suffer.  Case and point.  The chicken mixture for the lettuce wraps was unnecessarily soaked in melted butter.  The fish 'n chips were terribly greasy - the breading on the fish was so thick, they looked more like fritters, and the fries and fish tasted exactly the same.....like grease.  The deep dish pizza was obviously pre-baked, toppings were just thrown on when ordered and the pizza appeared to be microwaved as it was barely warm and the cheese was not even melted.  Upon leaving, my guest and I agreed we would only go back for happy hour, and if we had eated beforehand."
Matt G.,"Albuquerque, NM",14,1,,4.0,3/2/2014,Food is what you would expect from a sports bar/brew house. What really sets this place apart is the home made fountain sodas.  Try a root beer float!!!
Brian J.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,241,155,2.0,12/20/2012,Expensive and not worth it.  Long wait time and even longer to get food.  My wife and I went for lunch on a Wednesday and arrived at 11:50 am and did not leave until after 2:00 pm.  The waiter is only there to take your order and that is it.  Food is average at best.
Julie C.,"Albuquerque, NM",80,22,,3.0,12/13/2012,"I really wanted to give them high marks but I just can't.  The best part was the decor and bar however it was extremely packed that day.  I should of waited a little longer to go there since it is so new, but we gave it a shot anyway.  We went in a little after lunch and were told it would be a 30 min wait.  An hour later, we were seated.  Our waitress was good but I just don't think the kitchen staff could get it together.  It took another hour and a half to get our food.  It felt like we went in for lunch and left around dinner time!  It was crazy. The food was just OK.   I'd probably go back to have a few beers / Happy Hour at the bar."
Larry N.,"Albuquerque, NM",7,10,1,2.0,11/26/2012,"Stopped by for lunch and was very disappointed.  The specialty sodas (rootbeer and orange cream) were really too sweet to enjoy.  We declined refills.  I love root beer and think Virgils is the best and this one just made me a little sad.  They have a huge menu, over 15 pages!  It was a little daunting finding the quick bite for lunch, but a little deep dish pizza sounded great.  It was extremely small and very overpriced at $10.25 for a 6"" pizza that seemed more slight than a pizza hut personal pan pizza.  It tasted ok but doesn't match my definition of deep dish.  My lunch mate ordered a medium burger which came out very well done, which they were more than happy to replace, one manager apologized and another came out a while later with a much better burger.  With the burger replacement debacle we had three errors on three checks and I think the total lunch ran about 2 hours after the second burger wait and really slow service. I hate to judge based on one visit, but it will be a long time before I give them another chance and it won't be at lunch time."
Russell H.,"Albuquerque, NM",14,18,5,4.0,5/24/2013,"This place is always busy, service is good every time I've been here besides the wait time to get a table the servers are great and always taking care of me. Beer is ok, you can tell its not brewed at the restaurant and is shipped in because its some times flat, but its not bad just not micro brew quality. Huge selection on food and I haven't had anything I didn't enjoy would like to see more specials and or new items on the menu. Overall great place to go and would recommend to anyone."
Lex P.,"Albuquerque, NM",6,9,4,2.0,12/6/2012,Expensive place to eat and won't take phone ahead for parties over 9. When we did sit down the waiter treated us like a used car lot trying to push up sales over serving us. Food was not delivered by the waiter and waited at our table while we filled out our checks. This is a pricier version Old Chicago's.
