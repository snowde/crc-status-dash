Tyler O.,"Albuquerque, NM",11,43,22,1.0,2/21/2015,DO NOT CALL AHEAD TO BE ON THE LIST.....hence the reason for my 1 star review.   I have eaten at many BJ restaurants and I have enjoyed them all.  This one however is on my do not return list.  The main reason is the place is always busy so i called ahead to get on the waiting list.  The guy on the phone told me we would have a table in 30 mins.   We left our house according and arrived in about 20 mins; when we went to the hospitality desk and told her our name the girl to me it would be another 45 mins!!! I told her that I called ahead and she stated that didn't matter....this frustrated me and the interesting part is the man in line behind us did the same thing and was told the same.  Needless to say we walked out and so did his party.
Steven L.,"Williamsburg - North Side, Brooklyn, NY",0,42,1,3.0,9/10/2016,"Nothing really impressive to mention here.  Feels like an upgraded Applebee's to me.  The Blond beer was identical to a Bud Light.  Food was ""ok"". Service like the other reviews mention is average.  Lots of wait staff, but only your dedicated server.  I'll probably return, but not too enthusiastic."
Tony M.,"Albuquerque, NM",624,505,94,1.0,5/4/2013,I had seen the restaurant for some time and thought I would finally try it out.  I will say that it was a mistake.  The server was condescending and walked away to get water before I could order.  When he finally came back to the table I gave him the order and he wrote half of it down.   When the salad arrived it had dressing all over it and I had asked for dressing on the side.  It was delivered by someone else.  When the sandwich arrived it was all wrong.  I asked to speak to the manager and it took him a while to come to the table.  When I explained what had gone wrong the manger said I had two options he would take it off the ticket or remake it.  I told him I needed dinner so he remade the sandwich and the second time it was correct. Through all this issue the server avoided our table and only came by after I had finished the sandwich never refilled drinks.  I never got an apology from either the server or the manager for the poor service or the mistake.  I did mention to him that it was the first time in the restaurant and didn't care.  I personally would not recommend going here and will only go back if someone else is paying for it.
Allison B.,"Albuquerque, NM",38,53,12,3.0,11/24/2014,"I'm giving them 3 stars for their pizookie alone. I am a dessert connoisseur, and it's no French trained creation, but for a restaurant such as this they're damn good. Other than that they don't really stand out from other chains. If you like beer they have a great selection, if you like craft beer, you're better off somewhere local. Their own brews are mediocre at best, however they do carry an assortment of some pretty decent beer from other parts of the country/world. I can't say anything about the entrees, haven't ever eaten a meal here.  I can however say the service isn't terrible. We had a table of about 30 and they did well given it was already a very busy Saturday night. With that being said I know from others experience they're great for groups in general. They have plenty of space, and are always up to the task. The servers could have cracked a smile every so often though!"
Amber W.,"Las Vegas, NV",30,11,,1.0,9/1/2016,"do not trust that they will give you gluten free food!!!!! i have celiac disease and must have gluten free food or i get very sick. my grandmother and i went in today for lunch, and i asked for the gluten free menu, ordered, and ate. i have been sick since since about 30-45 minutes after i left. if someone states that they have an allergy they shoukd be able to trust that they won't get food that will make them sick... or worse go into anaphylaxis!!!  shame on you bj's, you're lucky my allergy doesn't mean life or death. i will tell everyone i know not to go here."
Maribeth G.,"Albuquerque, NM",40,4,4,5.0,5/22/2015,Very enjoyable lunch. Clam chowder and chicken tortilla soups were delicious. We will be back.
Eric And Jennifer R.,"Austin, TX",16,618,37,4.0,2/4/2015,"Most of the time I prefer to eat at hole in the wall restaurants or cafes.  Sometimes I miss the hustle and bustle of a larger city.  BJ satisfies that craving.  It reminds me of a restaurant in Colorado called white chocolate because it is earthy and dark.  The menu screams chain restaurant.  The menu provides a wide variety of dishes to meet the needs of large groups.  They offer items from watermelon feta salad to chicken fried steak.     We brought our Nebraskan friends here for dinner twice.  One of our friends noted her favorite beer on the menu.  She never found a restaurant that carried it before.  I'm not a beer drinker so I'm not going to comment on their liqueur selection.  The ambience was comfortable, service was quick and friendly, and the food was ok.  We've tried three different pizzas, California flatbread, watermelon salad, beet salad, clam chowder, chicken fried steak, buffalo burger, turkey sandwich with avocado, calamari, artichokes, lettuce wraps and spaghetti.  I've had worse food at local restaurants.  We ate everything on our plates if that tells you anything. It's a fun mellow place to hang with a group of friends."
Tamara G.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,3,,1.0,9/23/2016,Horrible service. Waited 45 min. to get my food. The staff wasn't apologetic at all. I asked for my check and it took another 45 min to get it. Very disappointing
Jill M.,"Albuquerque, NM",38,98,29,3.0,12/5/2014,The bottled wheat beer from marble is way better than theirs. Cool atmosphere.  Pizookies. Yep.
Jo M.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,6,,2.0,9/17/2016,"Have given this place several tries, and just can't get there with likin' this place. The home brew beer tastes like lighter fluid, the salads are old and wilted, and the rest of the food is run down and tasteless. The ONLY thing I like is there appetizer that has a Mexican flair and is flavored with Chipotle. Looking forward to the next restaurant that will be in this building, cuz this place ain't gonna last."
Stephanie I.,"Las Vegas, NV",20,5,8,2.0,8/2/2014,Great food but such sloowwwwww service and delay from the kitchen. Typical bj's timeline  15-25 minutes for table 5-8 minutes for drinks 25-45 minutes for food after ordering even appetizers 20 minutes to eat 15 minutes to get your check and pay!! Good food but the time always makes me ask my friends to go elsewhere!
Scott M.,"Albuquerque, NM",32,181,136,5.0,6/28/2014,"Reading the reviews of this place I conclude that local YELP-ers find it hip to trash franchises.  Let me tell you why you shouldn't jump to such a conclusion with BJ's.  First, they have a huge selection if beer ... Yes, BEER! ... 23 on tap, 23 bottles and 11 varieties the franchise brews themselves. If beer is not your thing they have plenty of wine and cocktails that'll meet your needs.  Second, BJ's has a wide variety of food (appetizers, entrees, desserts) and the food is very good ... good portions, great flavors, nice presentation.  In their 16-page menu you'll find Pizzas, Wings, Burgers, Salads, Sandwiches, Streaks, Pasta dishes, and Soups.  Third, there are those extras that make the experience worthwhile: Ample and very comfortable seating (booths, tables, bar tables and bar seating), high ceilings, cool murals, Vegas-inspired lounge lighting, cloth napkins, industrial designs and 80s music.  They also have a spectacular bar with a visually appealing backdrop of backlit liquor bottles and a super-sized central TV (1 large and 3 sub screens).  There are also at least 3 other large flat screen high definition TVs that play sports.  BJ's has friendly servers (I've been here three times with no problems whatsoever).  There is also lots of parking.  They are close to the new Regal Cinema theaters and close to shopping (ABQ uptown, Target, Winrock. Mall - soon to be ABQ's newest outdoor mall).  Check it out and tell me if I'm wrong.  P.S. They offer a 10% military discount if you serve or have served."
Erik L.,"Albuquerque, NM",24,16,26,5.0,2/15/2015,I read the reviews others have posted and all I can say is sit at the bar. Bartenders are friendly and have endless recommendations and suggestions. Timely service and I have not had issues with any of my food. I stay away from the regular seats as the servers are not always on point. Be sure to get a rewards card for free food if you are a regular such as I. Menu has expanded by about 2 pages since I wrote my first reviews.  Great location near the mall and movie theater as well
Serena F.,"Albuquerque, NM",25,80,35,4.0,10/23/2015,"Good food, great selection of drinks. Atmosphere is more upscale than a typical  bar scene. Staff was friendly as well."
Jason O.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,5,,1.0,5/30/2014,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me three  times shame on me!  For some reason we keep going back to this location hoping that service and food have been improved upon.  Nope.   So we went tonight after watching a movie because at 10:30pm there aren't a lot of options for dining.  We were starving, dizzy with food pangs. Right away I knew it wasn't going to go well because the hostess didn't feel like greeting with words: as if we were led to our table by a girl that tragically lost her parents in a plane crash and became mute ever since.  No need to make us feel welcome because we're only there to eat and contribute to your paycheck.   We sat for a little while waiting for our server.  He came by and dropped off water.  No introduction, no name, no time.  Just ready to take our order.  And here's what we got: Avocado egg-rolls CHICKEN potstickers Balsamic glazed chicken Chicken Thai Mango Salad Avocado egg-rolls - definitely came frozen.  You can tell when a frozen egg-roll is immediately deep fried then served its rubbery inside...plus the sever from a previous visit told us it was frozen.  Also I saw no actual avocado, it was more like guacamole. Rubbery nasty guacamole rolls. CHICKEN potstickers - Chicken is in all caps because when I took a bite it tasted more like ground beef.  My wife made the mistake of eating a whole potsticker and was queazy the rest of the night.  These were also from frozen.  Most definitely the worst potsticker I have ever tried in the history of my life.  I've bought frozen potstickers from the store that were better than this.  Also, we found it funny that there was an unnecessary little mound of shredded carrot in the center of the plate...like the chef thought that would look fancy.   Balsamic glazed chicken - there was no glazing done here.  They took a squeeze bottle and tried to be fancy with some kind of balsamic syrup (looked like chocolate syrup) passing it over chicken and mashed potatoes alike. The chicken...most likely from frozen.  The mashed potatoes tasted like they came from Furr's Cafeteria. Whats really weird about the presentation is that there were fried onions over top of the mashed potatoes but then there was a pile of sautéed onions near the chicken. Pick one!  No need for two versions of onion on one plate.   Chicken Thai Mango Salad - this wasn't bad.  I actually ate the whole thing.  The only issue I would have with this is that there isn't anything Thai about it.  It had a dry rub of a Cajun/asian fusion blend of spices generously sprinkled over the lettuce.  At least it had fresh avocado slices on top! Hmm,  I remember coming in with my son before asking for sliced avocado for him and they told me they don't have avocado except in the egg-rolls...liars.   Overall it was just a bad experience all around.  The only reason I gave it one star was because of the avocado slices.   I don't blame the staff, I blame the management for not checking quality and hiring incompetent employees (especially in the kitchen).  I've been to other Bj's and the chain is actually pretty good. Its just this location that sucks.  Corporate needs to go in and clean house.   Seriously.  My wife and I have been to this location three times over a period of three years and the only thing consistent is the terrible food and crappy service.  I've never sent food back, EVER, until this place.  How can you mess up cooking salmon three times in a row!!?"
Darwin G.,"Chandler, AZ",61,25,15,1.0,2/5/2015,Very disappointing meal. I ordered a dinner salad and bison burger. Tiny salad and tiny bison patty! Where is the bison? Not here.
Roberta F.,"Eastside, Albuquerque, NM",65,44,12,1.0,3/23/2014,Was not acknowledged after sitting at bar for ten minutes. Wasn't even busy. Guess you don't want our money?
Chris C.,"Albuquerque, NM",29,8,9,2.0,5/28/2014,"For a chain this one had so much promise. After a long day in the office that killed what little desire I had to cook, we needed something nearby that would please the whole family. I'm not one for chains to begin with, but I had never been to BJ's and I had heard some good feedback on the place so we gave it a go.  It was beautiful night, so we hit up the patio. The place had great ambiance and the patio was comfy and inviting. The service however was slow and indifferent. Seemed to be one server on the patio,  so I cut him some slack.  I love craft beer, so I wasn't expecting to much out of the house brews (they did have some locals and regionals on tap and I give them credit for that).  I had the hoppy scotsman and my wife the blonde. Nothing to write home about but solid drinkable beers. Unfortunately, my glass wasn't quite clean. We'll pretend it's residue from the head. It took me long enough to get the beer, and I wasn't about to part with it for a clean glass.  On to dinner. The food took a while, but we were enjoying the patio. When our plates arrived however, my Mahi tacos were shrimp tacos (the server had even asked if I wanted my Mahi grilled or fried).  I'm pretty easygoing, so shrimp tacos it is. Then the last straw, whether the shrimp was cooked through was suspect. While I like my steak and my fish medium, I don't think it's a safe way to eat your shellfish. My Mahi taco turned shrimp taco quickly became a slaw taco.  Maybe it was a bad night in the restaurant, but subpar service, dirty glassware, an incorrect order, and undercooked food leaves me without a compelling reason to return. Dine at your own risk."
Stefan K.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,6,5,1.0,4/28/2014,"I've tried this place twice, never again. The first visit included the waitress treating my colleague as if it was a massive imposition to visit our more than once during our entire time there.  I figured I would give it a second shot, and on the second visit, after waiting over an hour for a table that we had made a reservation for, our food was cold, the waiter couldn't be bothered to get any of our orders right; let alone come back to the table. We were getting dinner before a movie, and had to ask another waiter if the rest of our order could be cancelled (about an hour and half after we placed our order) and we could have our check since we hadn't seen anything beyond our appetizer and our waiter seemed to have dropped off the face of the earth with no warning.  I would never go back here. There are some great restaurants with much better service and food over at ABQ uptown and across the street. Don't waste your time or money at this place."
Malinda R.,"Los Angeles, CA",190,34,18,2.0,9/28/2015,"From the beginning of our experience at this BJs, it's been all wrong. The greeter gave the wrong info. It took a waiter a few too many minutes to greet us. Our food took over 10 minutes to come.. and when it did, it was cold. Our meals came out all at different times. Someone ordered pasta and they brought the bread out 5 minutes later... and there was NO ONE in the restaurant to blame it on business. Yep, wouldn't recommend or come back."
