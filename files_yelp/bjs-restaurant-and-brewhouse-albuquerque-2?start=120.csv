Jeremy S.,"Albuquerque, NM",94,216,135,2.0,2/21/2014,"I guess at the end, it was just funny.  You ever had one of those lunches?  Where you just want to tell the waitress, ""Hey!  Didn't you notice that ketchup bottle was empty?  Well it just farted ketchup all over my shirt!  It's hard enough for a man to wear a lavender shirt without having ketchup all over it!"" Or maybe one of those lunches where you just want to tell the chef, ""Hey!  I ordered this burger medium RARE!  This here thing tastes like a chancla on toast!"" Or maybe one of those lunches where you just want to tell the kitchen manager, ""Hey!  Where the hell do you find a specie of jalapeno that has absolutely no heat whatsoever?  I wouldn't have ordered a Jalapeno Burger if I felt like putting every condiment on the table on my burger just to taste it!"" Jokes aside, this place would be like a hybrid ambiance of Rock Bottom, with the flavor of...well unfortunately Rock Bottom!  Zing!   I should really try the beer before passing judgement."
Liz D.,"Cedar Crest, NM",0,5,,2.0,7/13/2016,"Good food, but awful service. After 3 consecutive visits that lasted over two hours with young kids in tow, we will not be back."
Victor L.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,7,1,4.0,12/22/2015,"This is my first time here, this place is pretty cool, nothing too special I suppose. I had a bacon guacamole burger with peperjack cheese, it was quite good. Like a normal day at a strip club. I have heartburn now, but it was worth it."
Emily Y.,"Orange County, CA",0,132,112,1.0,3/28/2015,"Dinner tonight  was awful! We waited 55 minutes for our appetizer and after all that our appetizers were wrong! They bring us 2 small plates for a party of 5? No silverware, cold pizza, worn orders. Manager came out and apologized saying they ran out of silverware and the patio just opened recently and they weren't prepared. Don't waste your time there's far better eateries within walking distance."
Casey B.,"Destin, FL",20,27,17,2.0,2/8/2014,"Can I just say that this place is so pretty inside, and it just doesn't match the quality of food you get served? I went w/a co-worker for lunch; so disappointed, & who pays $12.00 for a sandwich to only have to pay extra for fries? Won't be back. V/r, Casey Burnsed"
Kendall A.,"Lakeview, Chicago, IL",186,321,395,2.0,1/10/2014,"Bleh. I am not a fan of chains in the first place, but some folks we know had enjoyed their visit here, and my husband's employee chose this place for their monthly beer night out.  So, I joined them with an open mind. Right off the bat, parking sucked.  There are about ten spots right next to the restaurant, and the rest are set back in a mall lot, and you have to walk across an internal lot road to get there.  It was light when I went, but at night that could be really dangerous.   The staff who greeted me were clueless about my group, so I found them on my own.  The place is huge, but it was only about half full so it was fine. I sat with my husband and his folks (on a VERY wobbly chair) and had a beer and some appetizers.  The beer is not bad - the group pretty much agreed on that.  The Red, I think, was the general favorite, and I think on a second trip I had the amber.  (Not my choice - we saw a movie as a group and that's where everyone wanted to go...) The food was pretentious, not great, and expensive.  Haven't had a full meal there, but I won't bother.  They seem to have decided that if the beer is worth drinking, they don't need to put much effort into the food, preferring instead to just slide out the same corporate dreck everyone else does. There are so many great restaurants in Albuquerque, I really don't understand how places like this survive.  I guess there has to be a place for people who just want to eat and don't care about the food, but I prefer to enjoy the food I eat. Go for the beer (if you can't find one of the MANY excellent breweries in our lovely town).  Go elsewhere for the food."
Neil K.,"Albuquerque, NM",14,21,2,1.0,6/14/2015,Slow service and it wasn't busy. Sent my soup back (politely) because it was lukewarm and when it returned it was hotter than the surface of the sun. Fish was rubbery and over fried. Zero management presence.
Nicole O.,"Albuquerque, NM",75,271,70,3.0,5/8/2014,"It is a big restaurant, large menu and tons of beer choices. The food was okay and their own beer is alright. Compared to the other award winning beer on draft. Would go back for happy hour only."
Dave D.,"Albuquerque, NM",87,350,215,4.0,5/4/2014,"Sat on the outdoor patio on a warm, windy day, glad to have the six foot tall glass wall to block the breeze. We enjoyed the Goliath Imperial Red Ale, which was pretty good along with the corn fritters with chipotle sauce. Dinner was a burger, cooked medium well which was also tasty. Skipped dessert since we had beer and appetizers."
Kris A.,"Omaha, NE",3,7,2,4.0,7/17/2014,Big menu.  I had Parmesan chicken and mashed potatoes.  I thought it was good but not spectacular.  Service was above standard.  Wait staff was attentive and friendly.   My daughter had Mediterranean tacos and loved them.
Epifanio G.,"Long Beach, CA",377,3,17,5.0,6/19/2015,My home away from home away from home away from home.....great Bar Staff. Try a pie try local brew try their brew....get some sliders. See a star from New Mexico Film industry....
Steven S.,"Denver, CO",88,233,203,3.0,5/9/2014,"Large place with a colorfully light bar area. Our group of five sat in the main restaurant, and two of us (myself included) ordered the bison burger.  It wasn't bad. Very light. One drawback is they only prepare it one way, medium. So if you want it cooked to order you may be in for a disappointment. We asked to have ours rare, but they came out medium. Oh well. It was still good enough.  Oh and if you like fries with your bison, you'll have to order them separately. The burger comes with a cabbage mix side dish that is actually better than it might sound.  Overall, it was an okay experience. Order more food if very hungry."
Kate H.,"Albuquerque, NM",60,44,53,1.0,11/9/2013,"I ordered the calzone. It was quite small for the price and relatively uninspiring. Though there was an asshole selection of mixed drinks on the menu, there were no prices listed and I opted for an iced tea to avoid ending up with an outrageously priced beverage. Our waiter was over eager and not very helpful, he seemed more focused on turning tables around as fast as possible. We shared a peanut butter pizookie for dessert, this is a deep dish cookie served in it's pan with ice cream on top. The cookie itself was so dry and over cooked that it was almost inedible. Had it not been for the ice cream I wouldn't have eaten it."
Stephen G.,"Seattle, WA",0,7,7,2.0,7/22/2015,"Food isn't bad and the beers are good, but the service is slow and the prices are SKY HIGH! I've had cheaper beers at an NFL game. $6.25 for Sam Adams? Yea right ... That's wicked expensive"
Angela D.,"San Antonio, TX",21,60,6,5.0,4/25/2014,"Arrived on a Thursday night to a packed house.  Service was excellent.  Our server was attentive and knowledgable.   Avocado egg rolls as an appetizer and they were awesome! Chose a main dish of Ahi Poke off the appetizer menu.  Ahi needed to be diced smaller and there needed to be more avocado but it was a tasty, light dinner. My friend had the angel hair pasta with chicken...and said it was great. I asked for a Michelada and despite it having to be made from scratch, they didn't do a bad job.   I've eaten at BJ's before in Texas and have to say this New Mexico locations was much better!  Will come back again next time I'm in town."
Ricky M.,"Gilbert, AZ",197,632,23,1.0,12/14/2014,"I came to BJs because I only wished we had a Yard House in NM but the only place similar to Yard House is BJs so I thought I would give it a shot. I came on a Friday night I thought I would be smart and call in and have my name added to the wait list which I thought would speed up the wait time but it sure didn't still ended up waiting an hour if not more. After that long dreaded wait we then had to wait even longer since it took about 15 minutes for our waitress to even acknowledge us after placing our order we went with the Avocado egg rolls to start which were really good. For my main meal i went with the Cali burger which I ordered Medium but received a rare greasy burger and old cold fries. I tried to send the burger back but our waitress was no where to be seen so I got stuck eating this rare burger hopefully I don't get  salmonella poisoning and die by the time I finish writing this review :-/ Either way this place is slacking... long waits, bad food, and bad service I'm not a fan."
Erika R.,"Seattle, WA",249,3,,1.0,7/8/2013,"After seeing the place for awhile we decided to try it out. Wasn't impressed with a single thing there. The waitstaff was awful. Never checked up on us, and spent most of the time hanging out at their station shooting the breeze with eachother.  For the first time in my life, I had to send a beer back. Their red tasted like a watered down Bud Light. No way they should be charging $6 for a beer that disgusting.  We ordered the Nachos and sampler platter.  The artichoke dip tasted like it was frozen and then heated in the microwave. And the rest of the apps were OK. The nachos were absolutely horrible. It was pretty much a pile of chips with a little bit of cheese and some beans at the bottom of the plate.  The place is overpriced as it is but, after tasting the food is is just pure robbery. I will never be returning."
Teresa T.,"Round Rock, TX",58,51,15,5.0,2/6/2014,"Great food and beer! The avocado eggrolls are freaking amazing. If we were on a scale of 1 to 10 reading their avocado egg rolls I would give them a thousand! No joke. They. Are. Amazing! Love their hef and their seasonal pumpkin beer is my favorite pumpkin beer of all time! Honestly, I've yet to try anything that tastes bad of their menu. Their appetizers are fantastic and so is their pizza. They have a great beer menu and their service is great.  Apparently the word great is my word of the day. Great. In all seriousness though... This establishment really is great and I feel like one can never be completely satisfied in life unless you experience the amazingness of what I now make synonymous with BJ's!"
Jennifer M.,"Albuquerque, NM",46,33,78,5.0,3/23/2014,"First time here and I was not disappointed. They have really thick hamburgers, which I have been looking for a long time. I will be coming for happy hour soon. Prices are the same as other restaurants in the area. My burger was $9.50. Also, if you become a rewards member, you can pay from your phone as long as they scan your card number."
Barry S.,"Lancaster, PA",0,56,5,2.0,8/20/2013,"I had the Blonde Fish and Chips with wedge cut fries and my wife had the Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi.  My fries were not crispy but the fish was quite good.  My wife's portion was quite small - a very small piece of fish on top of a mound of mostly rice. Service was poor. While taking our order, the waitress kept getting things wrong. Once the order was placed everything came to the table correctly.  She was not very attentive and was ready to take our dessert order before we were even finished eating (a pet peeve of mine). The place was attractive and most of the staff seemed fine. I wouldn't bother going back"
