Ron H.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,10,5,1.0,3/7/2016,"Horrible experience.  Waited 7 minutes to even acknowledge our presence, two orders were wrong, slow service and the food was typical bar food without much for taste.  On a good note, the beer was ok... Chain restaurant failure... No need to ever go to one of these again."
Lorna N.,"Airport, Albuquerque, NM",17,61,13,3.0,9/13/2013,"BJ's has one of the most diverse menus I've ever seen. There are so many items to choose from. The food was good. The service was okay. It was really busy, so the servers were struggling a little bit. BJ's really needs to relook at the way they seat customers. There is usually a lengthy wait and there will be plenty of tables open. It was overall a good experience, and I recommend it to people that have picky friends or family. There are so many items on the menu. You are bound to find something."
Ania A.,"Greenville, SC",204,100,77,4.0,3/4/2013,"BJ's is a chain. That being said, some people will cringe as soon as they walk in and run right out, and some will have faith that since this place IS a chain, there must be something good about it for it to remain successful. The good: The menu is MASSIVE. This is a place to go when you're with a bunch of picky people--mom wants pasta and dad wants steak and kid brother wants nothing but mac and cheese... BJ's will set you up. They've also got a whole slew of specialty pizzas (personal sizes, too), and they're quite tasty. BJ's is also a brewpub, so they have their own line of beers. If you're into sampling microbrews, you'll be happy doing it here.  The ordinary: A chain is a chain is a chain. This place is nice inside, but you'd be hard pressed to say it has charm. It's popular, so the wait can be long, and the service is pretty much what you'd expect at a Chili's or a TGIFriday's or those sorts of spots--not fantastic, but typical of a big, busy joint.  Overall, we like BJ's simply because they have so much selection, and we're fans of choice. And the Ahi Poke appetizer is fantastic. If you're in the neighborhood, check it out. This is one that you'll either love or hate."
Dustin M.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,5,,1.0,4/2/2013,"Let's start off with the fact the I created this account just to review BJ's after my experience last night with my gf.  I had been here once before with my parents to celebrate their birthdays.  I had never been to a BJ's prior and had never heard of them.   My experience can be summed up in one word: Bland.  The food is just horribly bland. I had the fish and chips and my gf had spaghetti and meat balls with meat sauce.  First the fish and chips.  The fish was extremely bland.  It seemed like I was eating some mushy white meat with no flavor at all.  Also, the batter they use is pretty nasty.   Whatever they are using comes out like a lava rock; great for storing all the frier oil.  Seriously, the fish was so oily my stomach was really upset at me after we left.  The fries I ordered were thin cut.  They were so thin they would snap right in two when dipping them into ketchup or even just trying to lift them to your mouth.   If you want good fish and chips try O'Neills.  They are basically my benchmark now for fish and chips.  BJ's comes no where close on this dish. Next the spaghetti.  It wasn't actually spaghetti but one of the thinner types of noodles.  Again, very very bland.  The sauce was okay, but  I could tell that it had not been cooked with wine.  Maybe this is just a personal preference. On the way home my gf and I joked about throwing up the food we just ate to go home and cook a proper dinner.  Seriously.  Root beer was ok but nothing at all compared to Il Vicino. In fact all of their handcrafted soda's are nothing worth writing home about.  The cherry soda was so sweet is was practically undrinkable.  In fact the same would have to be said about their beers; nothing special and nothing worth going out of your way over. I would not recommend this place to anyone especially if you are looking for good food or good drink.  If I could rate it 0 stars i would."
Monique J.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,3,1,1.0,3/16/2013,"Since this place had been here for several months now in ABQ, I recommended to my husband that we should try it out. I knew it was a chain, but I've never tried it before. Meh--pretty much can be summarized as a glorified Applebee's with entrees costing about $5-10 more. Don't believe the hype. The menu is enormous--something (*mediocre*) for everyone. It's as if they took the ""jack of all trades, master of none"" approach. I had the flame-broiled Atlantic salmon--typical restaurant chain quality which means safely over-cooked. Common sense should have told me NOT to order seafood in NM, especially from a large chain. What was really shocking was the $5.50 microwaved dry Kraft mac 'n cheese my daughter ordered. C'mon! How difficult is it to cook fresh mac 'n cheese from a box? The restaurant was busy! We called ahead, but waited for about 20-30 minutes on a Saturday night at 6:30. I am sad to see it's popularity because there so many other good restaurants nearby."
Thomas F.,"The Loop, Chicago, IL",1,34,12,4.0,10/15/2013,"If you know what you're coming here for, you won't be disappointed. This isn't some 5 star steakhouse or culinary destination. What they do have are lots of options, a ton of friendly and effective staff members, lots of micro brews and a great bar (limited on the top shelf liquor). Nothing to complain about here."
Jackie G.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,21,1,1.0,12/30/2012,"Horrible experience... This review is based on the customer service aspect only... We didn't even stay long enough to try the food, much less the beer. My husband and I wanted to try this place out on a Saturday night. When we arrived, the waiting area was packed, which is understandable since it was a Saturday evening, AND a brand new restaurant. We had a movie to catch, so we decided not to dine there, since we were told it would be about a 40 minute wait. We decided to go on Sunday afternoon for lunch, and possibly watch some football. Again, there was a 20 minute wait, which was fine with us. They gave us our pager, and we sat in the waiting area... Waiting, waiting, and waiting. After our twenty minutes was up, I asked the hostess how much longer the wait would be. She took my pager and pressed some buttons on her computer screen, and told me there was a party of 2 ahead of us.  I sat back down and noticed a couple that had come in way after us, had their pager blinking! I was about to say something but then our pager began to go off, so I figured I would just let it go. We finally got seated after a 40 minute wait... There was a family next to us who I had noticed in the waiting room (I am very observant I guess). They probably were seated 15 minutes before us, and they had no drinks or anything on their table. My husband and I waited for a out 10 minutes when he flagged down the manager who was the least bit concerned about these 2 tables that haven't been helped yet. My husband asked where our server was, and the manager came back telling us she was getting our drinks, then walked off. Uh, excuse me but we hadn't ordered any drinks because our server was nowhere to be found! Anyway, after another 10 minutes, we decided to leave. As we were leaving, the manager passed by us again and my husband said, ""you have another free table."" The manager told us he would give us a gift card, we said no, and I proceeded to tell the manager about our 1 hour long wait, and what a complete waste of time this experience was. We started walking out again, then the manager GRABBED my husband's arm, and told him he would give us a free appetizer. My husband looked at me, and I said, ""Hell NO."" I was so upset and hungry, we ended up just getting some Wendy's  and watched some football in the comfort of our own home. This place is overrated and no one knows what they're doing."
Jazmine V.,"Albuquerque, NM",143,452,324,3.0,1/21/2013,"I like the place. I've been a few times now and I'm a huge fan of the food. I was skeptical at first because of their ""cheesecake factory sized"" menu. But everything I've eaten has been delicious. My husband had some jambalaya that was awesome. I've had the shrimp lettuce wraps and the nachos and they were both better than expected. I really like the Nutty Brewnette and the Hef that they have on tap. I haven't tried any of their cocktails yet, but a friend of mine had a pomegranate martini and loved it. I like the setup of the place. The inside is very appealing. What I don't like about this place is the service. It's not great.The first time we went we had an OK server, but she was ""fake"" nice and it was really annoying. She went a little overboard on the niceness and forgot my hubs beer. He ended up waiting like 20 minutes for it. The second time I went, there was a 20 minute wait for a table, but there was a recently vacated booth at the bar. We waited by it while it was cleaned, but the server seemed kind of mad and inconvenienced by the whole thing. I said thank you twice for cleaning the table and kind of got snubbed both times.  Oh well....I'll be back to this place because the food is on point."
Stuart M.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,2,,1.0,4/12/2015,"This is the second time we tried eating here and once again the service was terrible. After being seated at our table we waited 15 minutes and still no server. I finally had to go up and ask for a server. Apparently we were not assigned one. Other than that, the beer was good."
Elia F.,"Albuquerque, NM",55,11,,4.0,3/24/2016,Absolutely love this place. Variety of food is great. My boyfriend and I go here often. The service is mediocre usually but we have had a couple of amazing servers. The food has always been great in our experience and the drinks are amazing.
Clayton A.,"Albuquerque, NM",146,667,450,3.0,1/7/2013,"BJ's is one of the highly capitalistic enterprises that saw a growing movement and devised a way to cheapen it and dumb it down for the clueless American masses. As smaller breweries have slowly chipped away at the stronghold that Bud, Coors and Miller have on the American beer market, many a drinker has shunned the Big 3 (oh, the ruff life). BJ's clearly recognized this and swooped in to steal as much of a share that the big guys are losing as is possible. While this may be good from a business standpoint and has brought them obvious success, it's certainly not good for creating a great atmosphere or something they've done for the love of beer.  First off, when I walked in on a Saturday hoping to catch the NFL playoffs and sip a beer at the bar, I wasn't prepared for the mayhem I'd find inside. The place was packed beyond belief and people were scurrying every direction like a Bronx crackhouse. Miraculously, I found a seat at the bar and received some attention after about 5 minutes of scrutinizing the novel-length menu (always a major pet peeve of mine). The waiters were friendly enough and allowed me to sample a few beers, but they were too busy for their own good and not the type of servers you'd want in a place calling itself a brewhouse since they had neither the time nor the knowledge to speak on the beers they were serving. This bothered me but I got over it.  I must concede that the beer selection wasn't horrible and the one BJ's brew I tried, the Imperial Stout, surpassed my very low expectations and turned out to be good. Also, a happy hour was in effect so my two pints cost me $9. Not bad. Plus, I'd probably come back to try the pizzas that apparently are what BJ's originally became famed for and on Saturday evenings sell at half-price.  Overall, it's a mixed bag and thus the 3 stars."
Ashley E.,"Albuquerque, NM",226,338,106,2.0,1/13/2013,"I've got to say this location seems a lot worse than the locations I've dined at in California.  It took FOREVER to get a server to come over to our table to bus off the mess the people before us left. Then it took another lifetime to get someone to take our order. Drinks took a long time to get to us. We started with ""traditional buffalo wings."" They're not really traditional AT ALL. They are breaded and deep friend served dry with a bowl of buffalo sauce to dip them in on the side. Traditional buffalo wings are served tossed in butter and buffalo hot sauce. The bowl of sauce had no butter so it tasted weird.  I was still hungry so we ordered a small deep dish pepperoni pizza. Well, I wasn't expecting it, but their pizza doesn't have sauce on it! None! It was basically glorified cheese bread with chopped tomatoes on top and a few pepperoni thrown on for appearances. *sigh* So disappointing. The only thing worth going for is probably the pizookie..and that's only if you have the patience to wait and wait for it!!"
Ramona H.,"Albuquerque, NM",36,33,19,1.0,9/11/2013,Horrible service and horrible food. Thought I'd give this place another shot since the food and service was awful when they first opened but I see that nothing has changed. Ill for sure never return here.
Bev M.,"Albuquerque, NM",39,10,,3.0,10/28/2015,"Why is it, that the menu's are a disgusting sticky mess every time we go there. I have mentioned this to the manager 4 times, yet they remain the same. Who wants to eat at a restaurant that doesn't clean their menus??? I have been told every time, that they clean their menus daily. I seriously doubt that. The food is passable, but not as good as when they first opened. Saving grace? Their bartender Dom. He rocks."
Sarah D.,"Tucson, AZ",41,25,59,4.0,12/29/2014,"Service was awesome! Accommodated to my father-inlaw by seating us at a table that was showing the game he wanted to watch. We had a party of nine including a baby. We had tree different appetizers: tradional wings, calamari and the avocado rolls. All were hot and delicious! We didn't wait very long for our food to come out either. From out of town so it was nice to eat somewhere we recognize and have it taste just as good as home."
Leyla D.,"Albuquerque, NM",60,66,190,5.0,8/28/2014,"If you're sitting outside with a great view of the Sandia mountains or inside with windows and warm ambience.  And at the bar for happy hour, full bar, I prefer their IPA, but there is a selection of other local craft beers on tap."
Daniel W.,"Albuquerque, NM",53,9,,2.0,12/13/2012,"It started off bad because someone stole our call ahead seating.  ""Matt for 6"" is apparently a common call ahead request...  Finally an hour after we called (on a Wednesday night) we were seated in a booth that was allegedly supposed to seat 6 ""with comfort"", managers words, not mine.  Well, if we were 5-foot-tall females, sure, it would have been okay, but with a few 6-foot-tall dudes in the mix it was very cramped.   Overall, the service was terrible.  Our server was pretty nice but all she did was take our order.  OTHER workers were charged with the very difficult task of bringing us beer and food in a reasonable amount of time while pretending to be in a happy mood. They failed.  Okay, now on to the beer... What can I say? Their beer is mediocre at best.  I had a flight of the ""light and hoppy"" and the beers all tasted basically the same.  The best beer on tap at BJ's was the Marble Red by far, so do yourself a favor, if you want pizza go to Dion's, if you want a burger go to Blake's, and then go pick yourself up a 4-pack of La Cumbre Elevated IPA and stay home.  You will be much happier in the long run.  Oh, by the way, don't let ""Brewhouse"" in their name fool you. THIS IS NOT A BREWERY."
Sarah N.,"Albuquerque, NM",16,9,,2.0,4/30/2015,"The restaurant is beautiful. Huge big screen tv's dim lighting and a great looking bar but the excitement unfortunately stops there. Although our mixed drinks and appetizers were pretty good our food was kind of sub par. Nobody likes soggy french fries:(  Our waitress was very rude and seemed rushed, wouldn't even let my husband finish his order before walking away and never really came around to see if everything was ok. Honestly it's a fancy Applebee's with a hefty price tag. It would be a fun place for drinks and apps during a game but it ends there."
Gary E.,"Rio Rancho, NM",27,3,,4.0,3/9/2015,"Very nice atmosphere, and the food quality and quantity is a great value.  Very nice place for a casual meal with family and friends.  Also, a great business casual meeting and meal location with colleagues."
Andy B.,"Windermere, FL",63,278,103,3.0,11/9/2012,"I got to eat here during one of the preview nights, but didn't want to write a review until I had gone again (and was paying for the food!) This place was really busy right at 11am, but then this is the opening week. They have a large menu (not Cheesecake Factory big, but approaching that kind of size!) and so there are lots to choose from (pizza, salads, seafood, pork, steak, sando's) and we were told about the lunch menu (which has smaller plates). I had the Mahi Mahi (from the regular menu - as that is available all day) and it comes with a stir fried rice with pineapple and peppers.  My friend had the lunch pizza and salad. I liked my dish (it is only about 575 calories - which was nice) the fish may have been a tad overcooked, but the rice was very tasty indeed, I this dish would be greatly improved if they gave you a side of teriyaki sauce or just something to help moisten the fish. The salad and pizza didn't look as great (the lettuce looked like something from a grocery store ""pre-bagged"" salad) an then a tiny sprinkle of shredded carrot - it just really didn't look that appetizing. The personal pizza was about 5"" across and was their ""Chicago style"" which seems to mean here that is massive dough and little toppings - I really like Chicago Deep Dish pizza and to me that is like a pie crust with a whole lot of toppings (and I have eaten this twice in Chicago to be kind of sure!) - both Pizza 9 and now BJ's seem to go with ""deep crust"" and as I am not a huge crust fan I am just a little disappointed. The friend I was having lunch with (and who ordered the salad & pizza) also felt that it was way too much crust and not enough toppings. The prices here are very reasonable and they have a lot of choices and so I am prepared to go back again and give another dish a try."
