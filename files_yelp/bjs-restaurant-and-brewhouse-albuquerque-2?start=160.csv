Laura I.,"Mesa, AZ",55,159,2,4.0,11/23/2012,"You know how everyone gets when there is a new restaurant in town, everyone and their mother has to come out and try it.  I would have stayed away a little longer, but this was not chosen by me.  So I go for it. As expected, service is still being figured out, but we were with a large group for MNF.  They do have tv's set up, but there is no audio, which was kind of nice because it was not super loud where you couldn't have a conversation. This is a brewery, so naturally I had to try their sampler.  I had the lager, blonde, hefe, and seasonal.  This is no La Cumbre.  All of the beers tasted a little weak and did not really stand out from one another.  So why all the stars?  Everyone we were with loved their food.  We had a large variety of food and nobody complained.  I had the clam chowder in a bread bowl.  There are not too many places in Abq where you can find that.  The bowl was even toasted, so the bread was nice and crispy. I was told the burger and pizza was very good.  And avocado eggrolls...yum!  This is a lively scene at the moment."
Travis B.,"Albuquerque, NM",35,3,,5.0,4/20/2015,"My wife and i had dinner at bjs tonight and we're pleasantly surprised, we just wrote it off but now it's part of our restaurants we chose from,"
John M.,"長野県, Japan",49,53,16,3.0,3/26/2013,"It was decent.  My first time here.  I had a Grand Cru draft and burger.  The Calamari was decent, but not the best in town (Trombino's is).   FOr me it was a bit pricey, I would rather go to the E-bar across the way and save a few bucks."
Dominik T.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,2,1,2.0,6/4/2013,"This review gets an extra star because my Southern Fried Steak was decent. The other five meals were absolutely horrid. All of the grilled chicken pasta plates were extremely bland with watery noodles coupled with VERY dry chicken. The salads were basically just a grouping of iceberg ends and not much of anything else. Horrible food, 'meh' service and really expensive. Not worth your time...AT ALL"
Alicia F.,"Albuquerque, NM",40,142,166,3.0,11/25/2012,"After seeing this place when we went to Dallas I was dying to try it, but to my discontent I was very sad to find the place not everything I had hoped for.  The service was okay.  Our pizza's flavor was good, but its temperature was cold.  I ordered a Hawaiian mahi-mahi plate and the fish was dry; however, the rice beneath the fish was pretty good.  The reason why I gave this place 3 stars was because I loved their orange cream soda!  It was delicious!  I would like to give them another try and maybe go there for lunch because the prices are cheaper."
Austin C.,"Eastside, Albuquerque, NM",34,3,3,1.0,2/15/2015,"The service was awful! It took well over 10 minutes just to get a Cider, the restaurant wasn't busy at all. After ordering food, it took one of the party 45 minutes to get food, the other two people's meal only took about 20 minutes. I ordered wings, upon receiving them, they were the wrong sauce. I had ordered the Garlic Parmesan, and they brought out Teriyaki. After telling the waitress this, she immediately took them back to the kitchen and brought out the same wings, but now with Teriyaki AND Garlic Parmesan. This was disgusting! She ended up taking them back and brought out new ones that were correct after another 20 minutes. This was the worst service I've experienced here, and nothing was handled well!"
Lauren K.,"Albuquerque, NM",8,12,20,4.0,11/29/2014,"Fish tacos and Mediterranean chicken pita were delicious but the ""deep dish lasagna"" was a huge disappointment.  It was simply 4 cheese ravioli in a fancy dish. Way too cheesy"
Ione F.,"Albuquerque, NM",14,14,,4.0,1/2/2015,I usually get the Seared Ahi tuna salad.  It's very good.
Glen A.,"Aubrey, TX",180,26,6,1.0,12/23/2014,"10 minutes to get a drink ordered, dirty silverware, rotten fermented apple sauce with kids ribs, total lack of attention, pushy/rushed service to get us out, no wings, no soup, no nuts on salad, completely wrong drink order.  Ribs were boiled crap.  Got a free desert offered, even that came out wrong.  Manager kind enough to take the food off the bill when I finally lost it on the fermented apple sauce.  BJ's has been one of my absolute favorite chains for years, but this experience left a bad taste in my mouth."
Garret J.,"San Diego, CA",25,15,6,2.0,8/6/2014,"We attempted to give this restaurant a second chance. We arrived at 3:45pm for a late lunch. The hostess greeted us and told us that it would take about 5 minutes to seat us. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue but the restaurant was virtually empty and it was late afternoon before any dinner rush. We took it as an bad omen based on our last visit when our food arrived nearly an hour after our order was placed during the same time of day."
Alicia C.,"Albuquerque, NM",6,50,7,4.0,6/28/2014,Came between lunch and dinner. Bartender Brandon was very nice and attentive. Had one of the pizza appetizers and it was tasty. I'll be back.
Gabby G.,"Acworth, GA",2,132,118,5.0,10/31/2015,"Oct 2015 - This was my 1st ever visit to this establishment and I'm glad I made the effort. On this particular day, all of their BJ Brewhouse Beers were $3.50 for a pint and their IPA was tasty, a very crisp flavor. I ordered their house made Guac n Chips, and WOW! I was happily surprised as they used fresh avocados, that are thickly chopped and lightly smashed, meaning huge chunks with fresh chips. On the side was their fire-roasted salsa, and that too deserves a WOW as it was delicious. The heat effect of this salsa took place about 10 mins later so if you wonder why your lips are hot...   Ha... I loved it!  I still wanted a little more so ordered their Root Beer BBQ glazed Wings. Once again, a 3rd WOW!  I was split over their wings and Root Beer Glazed Ribs, which I will order on my next visit. As for service, my bartender was Dominic and he was good, friendly, and quick to assist - keep it up Dom!"
Michelle F.,"Albuquerque, NM",4,93,9,1.0,10/5/2015,"This review is similar to Monica B.'s review. My husband and I have gone here about three or four times now, and I swear if we don't have to go for a birthday or something, we will never, ever return here again. The staff is good for the most part, so my issues with BJ's is not on a customer service issue. However, what I have issues with is the fact that any time we have ever ordered a pizza, someone at our table ordered a pizza, it comes out undercooked. The center is doughy and disgusting. That completely ruins a pizza. If it doesn't come out that way, it comes out burnt and is also disgusting, but typically it's just doughy and undercooked. We've had other orders that have come out wrong, or just plain nasty. My husband ordered a turkey burger once, half frozen when it was delivered. The pizookies and the house made sodas are the only reasons why I would ever come back, and sorry Bj's, but a skillet cookie with ice cream and homemade root beer is just not a good enough reason to drop a ton of money on moderate to poor food."
Kristen V.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,19,,1.0,10/20/2015,"Service was terrible, took an hour to get appetizers on a Tuesday at 6pm. Food was just okay, not worth the wait."
Matt H.,"Orange, CA",193,84,76,5.0,11/21/2012,"WHAT A JEWEL ! And I'm talking about the bartender !! Wow~we stroll in ten min to midnight; and gratuitously she served our weary traveling asses.. And we're picky. Plus; we've been to just about every Bj's across So-Cal :: Aside from not being able to sample the seasonal brews without buying a full glass (management discretion) this team has been trained well. Jewel knew beers to recommend and encouraged us to order a full dinner, even at closing. My veggie potato was perfection.. Never seen it better. (See photos!) thanks to everyone who made our stop off Route 66 a modern delight ! :D"
Tricia L.,"Albuquerque, NM",108,20,,3.0,2/3/2015,"Eat here often. Happy hour is great, with a good time range! Food is usually good with decent service. They have their own beer and my husband really likes the light switch. Will defiantly continue to patron here."
Laura H.,"Rio Rancho, NM",3,4,,1.0,1/31/2015,My best friend brought me here the first time to try a dessert called a beignet I was so excited to try it . When we got there we didn't have to wait to be seated so that was good ! We got seated and the hostess told us our waiter would be with us shortly we waited for about 15 minutes and no one came by to take our drink order so we finally decided to wave down a waiter and by that time we were ready to place our order but he took our drink order first the guy never came back so we decided it was time to leave and give another establishment our money ! Hint hint waiters!!! We asked to speak with the manager and he was very apologetic and said they want us to give them another chance he gave us a gift card and we left  My second visit was again with my bestie ! Again we didn't wait to be seated and again we went after having a delicious meal somewhere else we went to bjs for that dessert ! Again it took a long time to get our drinks I ordered coffee and when the waitress took our order just to come back and tell us they had run out of the beignet so we had to pick something else even though my heart was set on having that French donut ! Service wasn't that good the waitress was nice but she took forever to check on us that might of affected what we ended up tipping her BYW we would see a cluster of waiters and waitresses hanging out by the register pretending not to see us when we wanted to get their attention and our waitress was who knows where ! We didn't complain this time  Third visit  I was treating my bestie out to dinner her choice to go to this place ! It was her day we were excited and celebrating her promotion ! Same type of service ! Waited forever for drinks waitress looked friendly but ended not being so kind we ordered a large tomato and cheese pizza  When we got our pizza it looked like something was missing it was the tomatoes so we told our waitress the pizza was missing the tomatoes and she says oh I know and took the pizza back and ten minutes  later our pizza was ready ok good !! We had to ask for Parmesan she didn't offer it and when she brought it she slammed it on the table like we weren't as important as her other tables she didn't ask if we needed anything else my friend and I looked at each other in disbelief  We decided to ignore it until we saw a manager walking the floor asking customers how everything was and he totally by passed our table WHat the heck!! I even opened my yelp app on my phone so maybe he can see that this experience was going on yelp ! Nope didn't work!!! my plan to get good quality service failed !! On the flip side I finally had the soo anticipated dessert it was delicious but not delicious enough to go back again! We asked our waitress to get the manager so we can have a word with him! He was apologetic and said he appreciated us and they need feedback from us to make things better unfortunately I will not dine there again manager took care of our bill which was not needed it was nice of him the food was good service bad !!!
Michael M.,"Albuquerque, NM",6,4,3,4.0,10/29/2014,"Awesome atmosphere, AMAZINGLY and very friendly servers, fast service, hot guys on staff, and wonderful food. My only wish is that BJ's would invest in Gluten Free buns and more GF options instead of just the pizza!"
Josh B.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,8,,3.0,5/20/2014,This Chicken stuff I had was good as fuck. My friends barely got their food when I was done. It was a long wait so it was kinda gay.
Susan G.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,8,,2.0,6/23/2016,"We've had a couple of great meals at the Cottonwood Mall location and stopped in at this one expecting it to be the same. I'm not sure if we just hit on a bad night or if there is drastically different management at the two locations, but it really wasn't a good experience. It started with a server who made it perfectly clear that she would rather be doing anything else than waiting tables. She had no personality whatsoever, didn't smile once the entire evening, and did the bare minimum. She was also painfully slow--like 10 minutes between asking for something and actually getting it--and she didn't appear to be particularly busy. We aren't demanding customers and are typically good tippers (absolute minimum 15% and 20-25% if the service is good), but this gal was one of those extremely rare 10% recipients. We've previously ordered burgers, salads, and calamari and all were excellent. My husband had a burger and it was comparable to the previous ones. I ordered the Chicken/Bacon/Sriracha Mac and Cheese thinking ""how could I go wrong with that combo?"" After a few minutes, a manager came over and informed us that they had run out and were having to make a new batch from scratch so it was going to take awhile. No problem. We finally got our meals, a LONG time later, delivered by another server. The one time our waitress was prompt, she came over to see how we liked it before we had even gotten a good taste (my husband hadn't even finished dressing his burger). After a few bites, I noticed that the chicken, bacon, broccoli, and pasta were all cooked perfectly (kudos, that's not easy), but the sauce that someone took forever to whip up from scratch tasted remarkably like it came from a Velveeta Shells 'n Cheese box with not even a hint of Sriracha flavor.  I picked around at it for awhile and decided to save it for lunch the next day--adding some of my own Sriracha definitely helped, but it still had an overpowering fake cheese flavor. We had wanted to try the Pizzookie on previous visits but had always been too full. Since I hadn't eaten most of my dinner, it seemed like a good time to go for it. We got the chocolate chunk and it was pretty good. No complaints, but I wouldn't order it again because for that much money and calories, it should be awesome. We will go back to the Cottonwood Mall location and probably stick to the menu items that we know are good. However, I don't think we'll chance this location again."
