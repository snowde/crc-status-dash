Anna D.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,8,,2.0,12/2/2012,"This is your typical bar food for any LARGE city.  Albuquerque just makes it look like its better than bar food.  Nice location.  TV's on the walls.  Wait staff was not great.  Ordered flight of dark beers, got the light. Sent it back and it took a long time to get the dark beer flight.  The waitress did not offer water or come by to tell us the beer was coming.  Finally when I asked, she said the bar was busy.  My companion was almost done with his beer by the time mine finally arrived. Then my food came out about a minute later.    Food was so-so.  Prices average.  Liked the brown, the stout was bitter hops.  Cant imagine I will return."
Dave F.,"Rio Rancho, NM",10,3,,4.0,12/28/2014,"One of the best hamburgers I've had in a while. This is the first time I've been here. The bar area was under staffed for a holiday-shopping day. But our server ""Amanda"" was in total command of her area. My wife and I enjoyed our first time there."
Tonja O.,"Kanab, UT",0,3,,5.0,11/3/2014,"I had a great experience here--really good waitress, lots of beer options with full bar, and menu with  a lot of options. I have some food allergies and they were really good about making sure I had a meal that worked for  me."
Terrance E.,"Corrales, NM",37,67,28,4.0,4/28/2014,"Large variety of food on menu (kinda like Cheesecake Factory) and they have some of their own microbrews which are very good. Food has been on the spot every time I've been here, can't complain. Glad they came to the 505."
Kaye G.,"Sandia Park, NM",10,10,3,5.0,12/20/2015,"Our favorite restaurant in Albuquerque !  Variety of food and beers!  Second day in a row to eat there!  You have to try their appetizers...our favorite the southwest egg rolls. From the fish tacos, thin crust pizzas, tortilla soup in bread bowl and amazing burgers...you are bound to find it all yummy!"
Dorothea Y.,"Victorville, CA",6,5,,4.0,10/18/2015,Came for lunch. Ordered a BJ Brewhouse Burger with bacon&cheese. Prices were decent. Got my food in a timely fashion. Only complaint is that my burger was a bit greasy.
Melissa C.,"Springfield, TN",1,50,8,3.0,8/7/2014,"Went here with a group.  Why is it that all restaurants will only place 1 or 2 servers with a group of about 30 people.  Service and speed of getting food wasn't that good because of that fact.  The menu had too many choices.  Way too many.  Lets get good at some items and leave the others off the menu.  I had the Hawaiian Mai Mai.  Didn't care for the side dish that came with it.  The fish was good. If you love beer, this is the place, they have a lot of choices."
Tia M.,"Albuquerque, NM",8,4,,1.0,11/21/2014,"Absolutely awful experience,  so bad in fact this restaurant has been removed from our family dinner rotation. Our food was either wrong or gross,  our server couldn't be bothered to serve, check in, or refill drinks.  The manager was slimy and dismissive. Never again. That restaurant lost good money when it watched a party of 8-9 walk out with no intentions of coming back."
Tito E.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,2,,1.0,11/15/2014,"In all honesty this place is just AWFUL. I have never had to wait an HOUR for our food to arrive! (Even when we told our waiter 30 minutes earlier where is our food?) the waiting service SUCKED. One of my friends had to make a trip to the restroom and he wasn't done with his meal, the waiter came and just took his plate without asking any of us whether he was finished with it. Pizza was horrid not cut properly, pasta was dry and awful. This place just sucks. Save yourself and don't  waste your time or money at this place."
Barbara S.,"Rio Rancho, NM",11,5,1,1.0,12/21/2013,"Waited forever for our food, our waiter complained about our tickets when he knew we need separate tickets, than forgot about our dessert and finally gave it to us as we were leaving. Than complained when we asked to put it in a to go box!! Not very happy!!"
Mikael Y.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,4,,1.0,3/23/2014,"Let me start by saying that I used to go to BJ's in CA all the time and loved it. But this place was like a completely different restaurant! The food was lousy and the service even worse. Our ""deep dish"" pizza was dry and the toppings (which were $2/each) were scarce. Had to ask for a side of marinara because there wasn't any to be found on our pizza - when it arrived in ketchup-sized ramiken it was nice and cold - yum! The only decent part about our experience was the beer, but it was no thanks to our waitress who couldn't make a single recommendation because she ""hadn't tried it."" And you work at a brewery!? Unbelievable. So long BJ's that was the last you'll ever see of me."
Raf S.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,3,,1.0,7/27/2014,"Took a leap and gave a chain a chance. Here's what we can regret: a server that blamed the bartender on the slow drinks and then the kitchen on the fact that the thee tables around us who were seated after us ate and paid before we got our food. The three tables around us that went unbussed for most of the time we were there. The manager that didn't realize this stuff boils down to him. Finally the food that was wrong when it finally arrived.  Sure, you're shopping in uptown, it's convenient, but do yourself a favor and go to you local pub (O'niells? Geckos? Two Fools?) where they care about your experience."
Cheryl R.,"Albuquerque, NM",43,19,1,4.0,11/12/2015,"By far and away, this CORPORATE restaurant has the best staff ever! Dom, Amanda(both)! The new Happy Hour drink prices are a joke. Just greedy,greedy owners."
Joyce A.,"Los Lunas, NM",6,16,18,4.0,6/22/2014,For a dinner lunch its pretty good;  not crowded and nice and cool not cold.  Witress is nice and helpful ;)
Justin H.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,8,,1.0,10/9/2015,"Not the worst place, but not the best. Ordered s medium rare steak, took 30 minutes and was well done with burnt Brussels sprouts.  Sent it back, they send out another one that was barely even marked, so rare it wasn't even charred on the outside.   Manager did nothing, said "" well we already lost money having to cook you another steak, so I can't do anything else, not even cook it more""...... Terrible service"
Amy B.,"Albuquerque, NM",25,107,8,2.0,1/3/2014,"After several of the reviews I read on Yelp, I was purposely staying away from BJ's.  My friends wanted to get a dessert here for a birthday and so I had my first (and only) experience.  We went at around 7:30 and there was a very short wait.  The server came around after about 10 minutes of us sitting down and asked if we had been helped and if we had waited long.  First sign of a mediocre visit.  We ordered water and looked at the drink menu.  Another 5 minutes passed, and the waitress dropped the waters off but didn't get our order.  More waiting...  She finally came back and took our drink and dessert order.  The dessert (bazookie) was tasty.  My friend noticed something floating in her wine- what we think was a fake eyelash, and service was bad.  I'm good not returning- there's plenty of other places around town."
LoriAnne S.,"Orlando, FL",31,10,3,3.0,5/14/2014,The shrimp scampi has gone down hill.....too lemony. My son now loves the shrimp tacos. My ribeye was delicious. Service was great and so close to the new Regal cinema.
Jennifer M.,"Albuquerque, NM",4,16,,4.0,11/24/2013,"I like it, I like it a lot.  I have been here for lunch only and have walked away full and happy every time.   The pizza is sooooo good.  The only place to eat deep dish in ABQ.  The soup(s) are always great.  The Burgers are good but it's the super crispy fries that put it over the top.  And if you don't like any of that, no worries, they have about a hundred other items on the menu to choose from (maybe too many)."
Christine C.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,29,8,4.0,7/2/2014,It's super expensive first of all so sit in the bar if you go during happy hour hours. The night we went there was one waiter for the entire bar. We had to wait 15 mins just to get drinks. Otherwise he was nice and the food was good. Happy hour is awesome there 10-12pm and $6 mini pizzas and $4 beers for any of their brews.
Manuel C.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,12,14,5.0,12/30/2013,"This was a 1st for me....great place busy busy busy we were seated fast was smart to call ahead....
