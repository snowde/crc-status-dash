Christopher S.,"Santa Fe, NM",4,15,,3.0,12/11/2012,"When I first tried this restaurant, I actually expected it to be below average --or worse. To my surprise, this place is OK. Just about average. Large menu with a variety of foods. Decent beer. Would I go back again? Meh --maybe if I find myself stuck in Uptown with very few options."
Cruz K.,"Albuquerque, NM",2816,436,,4.0,2/27/2013,"Service could have been better but the food was good,nice fresh salad.The stuffed mushrooms were ok. But the real find was a Blonde ale.. Dammm you Blondes..Beer and women... Nice beer selection.."
Sandra H.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,17,,4.0,2/21/2013,"Stopped by with 6 friends Sunday after the theater.My first time there - a couple of the ladies recommended it.  I had the fish and thin fries. They were quite good. The salad was fresh and crisp. The chicken fried steak was good, and was enough for 2 people. Those who ordered pizza loved it. We will definitely return. It's noisy but the restaurant loses nothing in ambience because of the din. It seems to fit with the place."
Aj M.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,27,1,3.0,12/17/2012,"BJ's has probably the largest menu I have ever seen with every cuisine you can imagine, actually a little daunting in my opinion.  The food is decent, nothing special and I feel the same way about the beer.  The few times we have been there the service has been good and the bar does look nice as would be expected at a new restaurant.   I would place Bj's as a mix between Fox and Hound and Elephant Bar.  Like I said everything was decent and nothing spectacular, there are other bars in ABQ that I would rather spend my time at and will frequent Bj's maybe once every few months."
Eric L.,"Plano, TX",2,44,38,2.0,11/26/2013,"If you like spending a lot of money on bland food, BJ's if for you.  Their chile in a bread bowl tastes like dog food. Their gluten free menu was PATHETIC.   The service was pretty good, and the place was decorated nicely. But the restaurant was cold, and the food and drinks didn't taste good. I'm done with this chain."
Eric V.,"Albuquerque, NM",4,14,2,2.0,12/9/2012,It's okay. Not cheap tho so don't plan on having a few beers unless you have a few 20's. Food was just typical bar food. Had a pizza and a salad. Had worse but definitely had better.
Renee D.,"Arlington Heights, IL",0,18,,2.0,1/5/2015,"I don't recommend eating at BJs. A friend and I tried out their happy hour, and the food was mediocre, the service was slow, the prices were high, and my friend and I both got sick afterward. We haven't been back since."
Nate J.,"San Diego, CA",41,101,567,5.0,2/14/2013,GREAT BEER selection and a great staff that are very helpful and attentive! Very nice and new looking resturant... Pizza is the ish!!!
Gary H.,"Albuquerque, NM",5,45,75,4.0,1/20/2013,"Great dinner with friends!  Call ahead wait time was about 40 minutes during prime Friday evening (no call ahead wait 1:45).  Food was great (so many choices), atmosphere is open and friendly.  Beer tasting was delicious, pirhana pale ale was my fav. By far best part of our visit was our server, she got along well with our fun attitude, and made our evening even better.  We will be back soon!"
Sarah S.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,40,,3.0,12/2/2012,"A nice place.  Went on Sunday after Thanksgiving.  We had reservations because we were a large group right at opening time. The staff was a tad slow at times.  The root beer and the cherry soda that they brew themselves was quite good and I probably could have drank several mugs. All the food in the group looked great.  Even the dish off their  less than 600 calorie menu. Apparently they do drench the salad with salad dressing so order it on the side if you like it lightly dressed. I ordered a mini deep dish pizza with pepperoni.  I thought it was nice.  Perfect temperature, right amount of sauce (some may call it dry, but I love half sauce on my pizzas and I didn't have to order it that way).  Other people who had more toppings on their pizzas stated they were good as well. I will be going back if I need a standard restaurant for groups of people.  Nothing special, but just a place to hang out, get a bite to eat and chat. The way the restaurant was configured even as the lunch rush started and the place started to fill up I could still hear the people across from me with no problem so they have sound management under control.  (if you go during a game with the TVs blaring and loud fans around, your visit may vary)."
Matt E.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,42,,2.0,3/12/2013,"As others have stated, BJ's has an extensive menu and the food is tasty.  We went on a Saturday in between normal lunch and dinner hours and were seated fairly promptly.   We noticed that the booth we eventually got was empty as soon as we walked in, but we still waited about 10 minutes.  This was a theme, there would be empty clean booths but people waiting, for no good reason it seemed.  Maybe it's a staffing issue?  A manager was walking around, so it seems he would improve efficiency somehow. Our server seemed proud to say that on Saturday night, people would easily wait two hours to be seated. The food was delicious, we had a small gluten free pizza and a veggie burger and fries.  We each ordered a soft drink and split a dessert and the bill was $40 before tip. They try to sell you on their points program to gather your name, address and email. Not sure BJ's is worth the wait and the price."
Jim H.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,16,,1.0,6/27/2014,"Don't bother.  Yesterday, we went for an early lunch and arrived a little after 11:00.  People in the bar area, but, no one in the dining area.  We were told that there would be a 15 minute wait - seems they are not ready for customers at 11:00.  We left - won't make another trip."
Roxy W.,"Eastside, Albuquerque, NM",20,21,,3.0,3/1/2014,"Ive been here a few times I really like their food here it's always tasty and they have such a wide menu selection but the service and cooks timing really sucks!!!! Maybe cause its still kind of a new restaurant? Idk. but I only go here if I kno I have a good 2 to 3 hrs to kill and I'm not starving. Sometimes the wait is really long so I always call ahead and ask. The atmosphere is nice but sometimes a little loud and crowded. They're drinks are pretty amazing here!! The waiters are iffy thou and the service def sucks a lot of the time. One time we went here and we already ordered our food and had been waiting for it, when a family of 5 or 6 comes in and sits at the table next to us, orders their food, gets it, eats it, and leaves and our food still hasn't come out yet!!! This has never happened to me. So I told the manager to come over and gave him a piece of my mind and he compted our whole bill but we literally waited for our food for like 2 hrs. So needless to say I don't go here often after that experience. The cooks really need to get it together"
Steve W.,"Tijeras, NM",0,4,,1.0,4/19/2014,"Can't comment on the food.  After the $14 for two pints of Stella Artois, we decided we had somehow gone to an airport without knowing it and left."
Lissette A.,"Albuquerque, NM",156,14,,4.0,6/4/2014,Their beer is the best beer I've ever tasted and the appetizers are really good. The only thing is the customer service is just ok.
Markus C.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,13,2,2.0,5/30/2014,"tried this place AGAIN!  third time, same result:  horrible cocktails....how do you screw up a margarita?  anyhow, server Sara very nice, atmosphere is cool, appetizer as previous 2 visits flavorless; gave this place another chance as a friend hadn't been there before.  once the other restaurants open up at new Winrock, this place won't last too long."
Douglas M.,"Alexandria, VA",0,1,,1.0,5/14/2014,"Didn't even get into the place, arrived just before 5pm, told there would beats entry minute wait for a table for two.  The place was almost completely empty.  No one was seated, just a big crowd waiting at the door.  Their management of customers was the worst I've ever seen."
Ramebo M.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,2,,1.0,7/9/2013,"The service in this place has really gone downhill few months after it opened here. Tonight it took a long time to get our food and some items did not come as ordered, but they were happy to charge you anyway. When I requested the waitress to have the charge removed, not even a simple apology.  Made a great mistake of ordering dessert knowing how turtle-like the service has been. Big mistake it took a long time to get them. Really? How long does it take to make two Pizookis? The place was less than half full. Very bad experience. Not going back there again!"
Aron J.,"Albuquerque, NM",38,54,5,4.0,11/25/2012,"You know what I like this restaurant. I think reviews this early on in a restaurants life can be a bit biased. I mean they are brand new. Gotta get the hang of things. I actually met a girl from Sacramento that was brought here to help train the staff. She was great. She gave me total insight into how the restaurant should be. I have now eaten there while the training staff was there, and also wasn't there. Of course it was great service while they were there. I had a bad waitress after they had left. But the food and beers were just fine. It didn't seem like the place was going crazy trying to be run right. Their food is basically all carbs and cilantro though. But it's delicious. Just give them a month or so to get their act together and let the crowds die down a bit. It's going to be a great place. They are even opening 20 or so new ones across the country. Give it a try, it's a good place for Winrock/ ABQ."
Michelle S.,"Westside, Albuquerque, NM",3,7,,5.0,7/17/2013,Went to bj's and it is awesome. The burgers are great. We even created our own pizza it's one of the best I have ever eaten. I would and have recommended them to a friend.
