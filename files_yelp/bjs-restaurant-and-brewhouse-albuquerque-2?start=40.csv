Amanda R.,"Garland, TX",172,74,11,4.0,8/13/2016,This is my second time to this particular location and we've had good service every time! Our waitress this time was very friendly and quick. She was constantly refilling our drinks and making sure we had what we needed. The food here is always good! I've never had a bad experience with the taste of the food. This time I had one of the flatbread pizzas. Very light and satisfying. The desserts are also very good. They have many different options and they are good for sharing.  The only negative right now is there is a lot of construction going on around the restaurant so it can be a bit difficult to get in to the parking lot off of certain roads.
Kimberly H.,"Albuquerque, NM",62,10,2,1.0,5/10/2017,"I want to start off by saying we eat at this place ALL THE time. We came in on a Thursday evening (6:30 pm) ordered beers and an appetizer. Ordered food at 6:40 pm. At 7:20 we asked our server to check on our food. She said, ""its coming!""  Wow. Just wow. At 7:30 the manager came by and said, ""you guys are next! Your food will be out soon."" When we pointed out that everyone who came in after us was served before we were, he told us that since we ordered entrees and not appetizers that we have to wait. Whaaaat? So it's our fault that it's taking 50 minutes for our food to come out? Really bad customer service."
Maria G.,"Charlotte, NC",232,200,567,3.0,11/5/2015,"BJ's is a box box chain restaurant. It is average. You wont leave hungry but you might leave with indigestion. I have been here twice and I've found the service average since there seem to be too many tables per waitress/waiter. If you aren't ordering beer you seem to get worse service. The bar area is seat yourself and the last time I was there it took 10 minutes from someone to clear the ONLY table that was open.  The food is pretty good but is completely predictable. Yes, the pictures look almost exactly like the food. How does that happen? Well, it goes back to the ultra chain restaurant theme. If you look up the calorie counts on this one, be ready to lace up your running shoes.  I do really like the interior. It doesn't match the ""bar"" theme at all but it does make the joint feel a bit up-classed. The ladies room has some really nice finishes that I'd borrow if I owned a modern style house.  Overall, if you are looking for a spot to watch a game, this one is okay. I don't think I would make this a date stop but it is a good place for friends."
Cassie Z.,"Rapid City, SD",0,11,8,3.0,4/30/2017,"The on-line menu made this restaurant look appealing to us.  Good atmosphere.  The restaurant didn't appear to be full to capacity of people.  It took a very long time for our food to get served to us.  The food was OK, nothing outstanding.  Our waitress said she hadn't been working there long.  She was super nice.  She didn't stop by our table after we were served food to ask if everything was good, we had to flag her down a couple of times.  She brought the check--the total was way too high for what we ordered, so after looking at it, we found there were several items on it that we didn't order.  Flagged her down, told her--she had an excuse, took it back & brought a corrected  bill.  I had to ask the front desk to track her down to run the charge card so we could leave.  We won't visit this restaurant again."
Kim S.,"El Paso, TX",58,12,,3.0,4/21/2017,"Came following my oldest son's HS graduation. Server was slow to come to our table then, Server Mark was nothing but, slow and rude. Completely different than the service I get at the same restaurant in El Paso. This guy either didn't want to be there, didn't want us there, or both."
Cheryl B.,"Albuquerque, NM",17,27,5,5.0,2/20/2017,After seeing a movie at the cinema we stopped in to get appetizers during happy hour great service. We got the avocado eggrolls and wine everything was delicious I will definitely will get avocado eggrolls again.
Kaith B.,"Laguna Hills, CA",154,1,,1.0,3/19/2017,The food and wine was okay but the service was awful. Our server didn't help us at all and was gone most of the time. The manager had to serve us! She gave us a free dessert which was nice of her. Won't be coming back to this location. I'd much rather go to the cottonwood location :)
Channon D.,"Albuquerque, NM",16,106,247,5.0,11/2/2014,The mozzarella and tomato salad is the best thing I've eaten. Period. Try it and you will be pleased. $3.50 you can't beat.  Also the fish and chips is always great. I've been here four times and had something different each time. All have been great. Parmesan chicken is a solid plus as well. Personal pepperoni pizza very nice as well.  Service has been good every time. Wait time is cut down by using their app and the preferred club that goes with it. You can order ahead and earn rewards because of it.  Lighthouse beer very good as well as berry blast cider.
Veronica C.,"Albuquerque, NM",352,23,39,5.0,12/9/2015,Emilio G was our fabulous server in the bar. So friendly and knowledgeable. We had the Honey Siracha Brussel Sprouts and they were delicious. Drinks were great and service was as well.
Teneha B.,"New Orleans, LA",1329,889,5324,4.0,5/25/2014,"Quite the expansive menu. Drink choices off the chain. Service was great, less the member of the hostess staff that was hairy eyeballing me while I waited for my seat. #whodoesthat I love the use of mobile phones to order ahead or even pay for your meal once completed (if you don't wanna wait for your server). #howcool I ordered the Thai lettuce wrap, corn fritters & an adult cocktail, which might u add was #onpoint.  My server, Jason, was very attentive to my dining needs & for me, helped between 3 & 4 stars (for me dining out is just as much about the experience as it is the food - hellllo customer service is important) They also have a loyalty program, earning points for dining or monies spent; I'll read the deets later. Additionally, I saw some signage regarding a  discounted movie purchase and food there; again I didn't bother with all the deets, but it's good to know it exists.  All told, I like this place. Seems like the perfect place for groups of people or a nice place to grab a bite before the movies or a shopping excursion."
Chris H.,"Albuquerque, NM",27,18,6,3.0,12/29/2015,"Been back good service, good food just wish they had more lighter food options. I would come back.  I would change my rating till 3 1/2 stars.  Overall a good lunch, good food, and good price.  Chris."
Alex C.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,9,1,1.0,8/4/2017,Horrible service.  I went their a week ago and service was absolutely horrible! All they did to fix it was give us a free desert for our next visit.  I never wanted to go back but my boyfriend convinced me to give it another try.  We waited 10 minutes and no one greeted us. This is some of the worst service I've ever experienced. The only nice thing I have to say is the hosts were friendly
Evelyn A.,"Miami, FL",33,49,102,5.0,12/4/2016,"Took my godchildren on a Monday to watch football and have dinner. Plenty of options to choose from, great beers, friendly staff!"
Marie S.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,69,42,3.0,10/21/2017,"BJ's is good. Always have good coupons, good pizookies, and good deals on the pizzas. However, the last time we went everything went wrong. We were waiting for a booth for 3 of us (during a shift change) and there were other groups of 2 or 3 that were being called before us. Had to wait about 10-15 minutes before asking again for a table. Our waitress took our order and then promptly disappeared and paid more attention to a larger party she had. We waited about 35-40 minutes for the food and she said it would be right out. She brought two other plates of food except mine and said she had forgotten to put the order for the pizza in. A manager was called over to put the order in and came back with a complimentary salad. Again, more waiting. The pizza then arrived. As the waitress was refilling our drinks, she knocked over a glass of water and flooded the table. Then we had a coupon for a free pizookie, but we said with the ice cream on the side because one member of our party is severely lactose intolerant (to the point of having to visit a hospital). She came back with the pizookie and the ice cream was on top, not on the side as we had asked -_- More waiting and the correct pizookie finally came out. Anyways, the pizza was really good."
Steve S.,"Albuquerque, NM",38,147,35,4.0,9/17/2015,All the in house beers are pretty good.  I have eaten several of the salads including the Brussel sprout and Kale salad.  Good with Ahi added. Have wanted to try the deep dish pizza but havent gotten to it yet.  Has anyone had it there?
Lu Ann R.,"Albuquerque, NM",16,119,149,4.0,4/29/2016,"Mixed reviews at our table. The gluten free pizza was great, the ribs were meh. This is one of the few places I've found that does an egg free AND gf crust. The pizza was crispy, pepperoni was salty and delicious.  The major issue with the ribs was the lack of meat...it was pretty pitiful considering the ptice. Because there's so little meat it's near impossible not to over cook the...which was the case for our meal, but flavor was decent. The 5 spears of asparagus were seasoned and cooked well.  Blue cheese on the wedge salad was tangy, but also a little sweet. Beware; they use raw onion on the wedge salad."
Arnulfo S.,"Cedar Park, TX",8,5,5,5.0,11/21/2016,"Same atmosphere, different people same friendliness, always good food and cold beers. No room for desert as usual. Love this place no matter what state I'm in."
Janie H.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,1,,2.0,3/12/2017,"Hi. I'm angry. I'm at BJ's right now! And they do not even have vanilla ice cream for my pizooki. Like, I know that's a first world problem, but I am still so mad. And no one has made a sincere apology. Hi guys. Please don't go to BJ's. I will totally come back, but you shouldn't"
Steve H.,"Albuquerque, NM",7,8,3,1.0,11/12/2016,"Been here quite a few times, all good.....  Until tonight.... I had one of the worst meals i have ever had in a restaurant.  All 4 people in our party were dissatisfied but i did not make scene because of the company i was with at the time.  Actually went home and was sick..  Had the ribs with baked potato and asparagus.  Potato was tired, dry and cold.  Asparagus was tiny, overcooked and stringy.  Ribs were overcooked, crusty with burnt sauce.  I hope management sees this and fixes thier kitchen before someone gets really hurt.  Servers and cooks should look at what is being served.  Those meals should have never left the kitchen."
Denise M.,"Oswego, IL",41,51,52,4.0,4/12/2016,"I love their home-brewed root beer! Dropped in with a friend to get a bite before seeing Star Wars.  Yummy! The fried brussel sprouts were a bit overdone, more on the charred side, but the rest of the food was tasty. This was my second time here and the food and atmosphere was enjoyable. Multiple arrangements for seating, family friendly as well, not just a bar. They have a full bar, not just beer, go and try it out, you won't be disappointed."
