Manuel G.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,4,,1.0,5/19/2017,"We had a terrible experience at lunch today, 5/19/2017.  Derek, was the manager today and is incompetent as a restaurant manager. It took two hours to have lunch.  Our sons hamburger was brought out cold.  They told us that they were waiting on the bacon.  The service and food were horrible.  We would never recommend this restaurant."
Janea M.,"Albuquerque, NM",60,55,190,4.0,5/18/2015,Enjoyed a great happy hour today. The spinach artichoke dip was really tasty. The wild berry mojito was an amazing drink to kick of the start of summer. I would Highly recommend this refreshing drink for a summer afternoon on their patio. The pazokiee dessert is sure to fix that sweet tooth craving. Defiantly a summer happy hour spot!
Joanne L.,"Albuquerque, NM",37,154,42,2.0,2/8/2015,"Bj's was my go to place when we lived in Tucson so I was happy to hear that we have one here in Albuquerque, so last week I scooped up the ladies and we went here for lunch.  We were seated pretty quickly and the inside looks just like there Tucson location, our server I am sure was half asleep because our service was sub par at best and we waited so long for our food to which he said ""were just waiting on the black beans to complete your order"" the black beans??? seriously thats what is taking so long... clearly the kitchen staff lost the can opener because I cant even begin to imagine what else would take so long with warming thru some black beans. Finally the food arrived and what an anti climax..... I wouldn't of minded the wait so much if the food had been on point but it really wasn't.... no one at our table had anything to say in regards to the food and were women we normally have a lot to say but on this occasion we all picked at our food and moved it around the plate with our forks. At the time everyone was just been polite because I soon learnt later that no one else enjoyed there food either. Well BJ's on this occasion you failed to wow any of us which is a shame because we enjoy our lunch dates and may have returned some time but that seems highly unlikely based on this experience."
Leroy P.,"Albuquerque, NM",46,11,7,3.0,2/16/2016,"My burger was absolutely great. Good service and great drink menu. service was great, she was on point and always swinging by to refresh drinks and see if we were OK.  Selection of beer and alcohol was large and divers"
Vincent H.,"Albuquerque, NM",47,201,687,3.0,1/4/2014,"Nothing extraordinary. I like their beers, and cream soda, pretty awesome stuff. Food is somewhat ok. Aint gonna blow your mind away is a for sure thing. I like their Avocado egg rolls, these rolls are long, fat, meaty, fresh and joocy. Once you put it in your mouth, you won't be able to stop....normally i say no teeth, but this is kinda hard not to, just sayin' Desserts are good too, their pizookie was just too good, moist, warm and oozing wet with the melted ice-cream on top.  Never been before? Try it and you might like it."
Eddie G.,"San Francisco, CA",386,49,79,4.0,11/19/2016,The service was great and very friendly staff all around. The food was tasty and was very hot off the grill when it was brought to the table.
Don O.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,6,1,1.0,5/21/2017,"My wife and I came here for Veterans day since receiving multiple recommendations from friends. Started with a tatste of two beers and both glasses had crusty dried stuff on them. I moved past this mistake thinking perhaps it was a fluke however I spoke to my server who kept bringing me glasses with stuff on them until I asked for a manager and explained what happened in which they handled this quickly and investigated and found that their dishwasher had a fault of sorts and was thanked for pointing out this situation, I appreciate the manager handling it but I shouldn't have been served nearly 4 glasses before this was identified. Moved into the food and both my wife and i got the soup and salad and there is nothing interesting about it. Broccoli and chedder soup should have those little chunks of broccoli however it tasted like melted cheese with broccoli seasoning. The traditional salad was literally an unwashed piece of lettuce and maybe 2 pieces of vegetables which I did not finish. Finally the service was inconsistent, after each soup and salad I would place the empty dishes at the end of my table to signify they can be taken making way for our next meals however it stacked up with 3 dishes meaning the wait staff had come to our table at least 2 times and never took the dishes until I pointed it out to them. I will not be recommending this place to anyone I know, nor would I ever come back."
J G.,"Kings Point, MT",0,15,,4.0,4/10/2017,"Started bad, but got better! We had a horrible experience when the hostess, Karissa, was demeaning to my 75 year old father. We almost left but decided that would have made it even more humiliating. The waiter picked up on our frustration and provided outstanding service. The food was good too. Afterwards, we spoke with the manager, Miguel, about the very mean reception. He showed genuine concern and said ""she is in hospitality, she needs to be hospitable.""  I'm glad we stayed. One person does not reflect the entire team!"
Alicia M.,"Albuquerque, NM",87,17,4,1.0,1/21/2017,"Hello arrived at 6 for dinner with a party of 6.  Ordered two appetizers calamari and boneless buffalo wings.  Wings came out cold.  Sat 25 minutes without any attention. At 7:00 pm our food came out.  Wrong cut of steak and spaghetti and meatballs were cold, they were probably ready at 6:30 like the rest should have been.  Salmon entree reported good and Cajun dish was good but so spicy it was hard to eat- especially when your waiting 15 min for drink. When they brought out the steak the server said bad news bud we are out of baked potatoes, you ok with mashed.  Yeah she actually said that...They did bring out the correct steak and miraculously found a baked potato.  Asked for a hard cider it took 15 min to get it.  Dirty dishes strewn on table when desert was served.  Poorest service ever!  It's now 8:01 and we got two of the three desserts.... still waiting for last one#pickupdirtyplates"
C H.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,27,2,2.0,3/19/2017,"Abq location tonight.  Sometimes your waitress just stinks.  Approached the table asked what I wanted go drink.  Was interrupted by another waitress who had no idea where an order went.  Both of them just walked off.  Rude.  Then she came back got my drink order and my order.  Wasn't polite and when I offered my rewards number she wrote it down and walked off.  Rude again.  Keep in mind, I only just sat down and had no bearing on her behavior.  Don't know nor do I care how her day is going.  You're a server working for tips, it's in your best interest to be polite.  Tip will reflect her lack of service."
D P.,"Naperville, IL",0,3,,1.0,4/30/2017,How can you have a sports bar that doesn't show sports and is showing infomercials?  And the food isn't good either.
Junior B.,"North Valley/Los Ranchos, Albuquerque, NM",87,148,375,5.0,2/21/2015,"Greg tried his best to make us feel like waiting the one hour wait. Well worth it this time, a party of 14, we all had a good time as not over noisy and the wait staff as wonderful. I wish the app worked for more then 6 to reserve a table. Grag at the bar took good care of our birthday girl Thanks Greg!!!"
Brittany H.,"Rio Rancho, NM",5,18,2,3.0,3/5/2017,"Waited 15 minutes for a table even though the place was pretty empty, soda machine was broken, waited over 30 minutes for our food to come. They forgot a side salad, baked potato was burnt, and two of us had to wait even longer for our food. We got our food when we were ready to go. Giving 3 stars because the manager did come and apologize and take my order off the ticket. The food wasn't bad other than the crisped baked potato"
Ray G.,"Anaheim, CA",28,26,,2.0,8/17/2016,"Service was not that great.  It started out when the Host told us we could not be seated for lunch at 11:55 AM because the staff was not there yet.   This is a high traffic area in Uptown.  There were twenty staff members we could see around the place.  But the host told us it would be ten to fifteen minutes or we could sit on the patio which was 98 degrees that day.  Her attitude and stupidity were insulting.  She also told us we could not be seated and given drinks and wait for a server because there was ""no one to bring them to us"".  Yet there were three hosts standing at the host desk, and the aforementioned 15 other people roaming around in BJ's uniforms."
Melanie S.,"Albuquerque, NM",16,1,,5.0,9/10/2016,Literally my most favorite place to eat ever. If not for the delicious blackened salmon salad then for the wonderful wait staff... amazing service and easy on the eyes. We sat at the bar and had great conversation with the bartender who suggested an out of this world s'mores pizookie. I can't even with that pizookie. Will I be back?? A thousand times yes. BJ's is the B's knees!
Fawn B.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,8,,4.0,4/3/2017,"The food is okay their desert is amazing but I truely love their mixed drinks, their brewed soda and beer. :)"
Karen M.,"Albuquerque, NM",36,208,123,4.0,11/21/2015,"I am updating my last review from September.  We went back and this was a really good visit.  We had 5 people and we were seated promptly.  Server was very nice and food was really good.  As you can see from my previous reviews my visits to BJs can be hit or miss, but they do try to make it right."
Marshal R.,"Fremont, CA",107,242,27,3.0,12/6/2014,"Slowly and piece by piece, my love for BJ's is fading away. As others mention, things just take waaaaaay to long. Slow service and not the best quality. It's not even just this location, even in CA you get the same. I'm sure there are some better ran locations but it seems to be a company-wide issue. The last time I came to BJ's, there was a wait for the tables so we opted to sit at the bar tables which there were plenty of tables available but not cleaned or even cleared of the last patrons napkins and plates. I wish I would have remembered the name of the server though. She was actually pretty good and attentive. The Big Picutre, BJ's please take note that somethings needs to change. You haven't lost me yet, but it has become harder and harder to choose BJ's over other places.  The wife still insist on going here for the Great White pizza."
Robert L.,"Albuquerque, NM",91,13,,4.0,1/20/2016,Great atmosphere and good beer. I always tend to get a burger/fries here so I cannot comment on the other food.  The burgers are well put together and taste well. The shoe string fries are awesome.  I will however recommend any of of their pazookies. Basically a cookie in a pan with ice cream. Very good. The peanut butter smores version is amazing.
Wes T.,"Corpus Christi, TX",188,1314,37,4.0,7/24/2014,"Typically, a place like BJ's wouldn't garner 4 stars, because it's essentially just a run-of-the-mill chain eatery. However, BJ's has beer, and lots of it, and I like beer a lot so they get a bump. Go you, BJ's. So, yeah, beer. They have a lot on tap, all varieties and styles, in-house, guests, seasonals, you name it. Also stuff in bottles. Go nuts, I do. Food isn't bad, but nothing phenomenal. I do like their boneless wings. Also, they offer a good number of choices, even some low calorie stuff for those who are watching the intake. That's a plus. Service has always been good to me. I usually sit at the bar, though, so kind of hard to miss me. That being said, food gets out promptly even during rush and the servers actually do know a thing or two about beer."
