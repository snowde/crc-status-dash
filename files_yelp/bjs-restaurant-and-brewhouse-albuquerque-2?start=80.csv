Angelina C.,"Tijeras, NM",5,29,20,5.0,8/31/2016,Went there with some friends for a late night dinner after work. Service was really good. And the food was excellent. I ordered the Broccoli and cheddar soup in the bread bowl and the salted caramel pizoki. The food was exceptional and came out on time. I would highly recommend both of these menu items. A friend of mine also got the clam chowder in the bread bowl and she highly recommended that as well. This is one of my favorite places to dine. Can't wait to go back!
Monica B.,"Albuquerque, NM",7,25,35,2.0,7/11/2015,"I'm finally writing a review after three visits. The first visit was me wanting to go because they had just opened. The other two were friend suggestions. If someone suggests it again I will fight for not going here again.  The first visit was so so, we had an appetizer of calamari which was rubbery, soggy and not well seasoned. I had the shrimp scampi pasta and the pasta was over cooked so it was mushy but the shrimp were cooked well. Service was scattered and almost non existent.  The second visit we ate in the bar area. The service is much better in there but I think because it's a smaller area. Drinks were good and I decided on ribs. They were okay but nothing fabulous. The BBQ sauce leaves a lot to be desired.  The third visit was with a bunch of friends for a birthday party. There was about 30 of us. Service was actually better with 30 people than the service we had with just two of us on our first visit. There were two servers for our table and they did great. We all ordered food and drinks. I decided to try the flatbread pizza. Wow, that was a disappointment. It reminded me of a frozen pizza rolled flat. It didn't taste fresh or that good.  So the old adage ""three strikes you're out"" holds true here. We gave it a go three times and that's it."
Maria-Christina S.,"Rio Rancho, NM",140,151,214,3.0,9/11/2015,"I like this place. The food is good and the facility is pretty. I don't have any big complaints, I mean, the service is usually good but a little slow. We usually wait a while for everything, like the wait staff is overbooked. Also, it's a little pricey for pizza and the food in general. Like I said, no big complaints but also no big wins for me here either. I suppose I might feel differently if I could appreciate the brew part."
Howie K.,"Albuquerque, NM",3291,1194,3440,2.0,4/3/2014,"It's difficult to dog this franchise on craft passion. Most likely the numero uno quality I look for in any brew operation is commitment to craft, and judging from the tableside promotional materials I peeked, BJ's is all about educating the masses on the art of microbrews, they offer classes and presentations to prove it. Nationwide, this crafty thang is definitely catching fire, many smallish operations are attempting to claim the mantle of hybrid national/local beer wizardry. In ABQ, our first introduction to this movement is BJ's. And the beer speaks volumes: major corporate takeover.  The varietals ain't altogether bad, per se, but they sip like the set-up for a really bad joke: ""So this Anheuser-Busch rep walks into a micro-brewery..."" You know the punchline, it has something to do with firing the brewmaster. I didn't mess around, I went straight for some challenging pours, the Abbey Normal and Grand Cru. The color and ABV levels matched my expectations, but the flavors were barely discernible. Same went for the wife's porter and nut brown. And way too carbonated. These people should not be educating the public on this art. And when that Anheuser-Busch rep from my little joke scoured the menu of the little brew pub, he/she also decided to scrap anything remotely flavorful. Thus, the eats here are a snore. Such a shame. Like the suds, these plates (the few we tried: pizza, mahi-mahi, ahi tuna salad) were really flat, closely resembling some of America's champion franchise outfits (think Applebees, TGIF). So you're getting fizzy, empty beer and flavorless plates and probably waiting 20 minutes for a table on a Sunday night (we did). Sound like fun? By all means, avoid our stellar local breweries and dull your tongue at BJ's."
Chris H.,"Albuquerque, NM",10,18,10,4.0,11/6/2015,"You never know how your visit is going to be at BJs but tonight was a good night. The food has never disappointing but the service can be spotty. Tonight, however, was awesome. Bob had our drinks within 5 minutes and the Skinny Margarita rocked. Food was hot and oh so tasty. I will be back, hopefully with the same success as tonight."
Rika M.,"Littleton, CO",34,26,94,5.0,6/10/2015,"Best clam chowder this side of Maryland, plus an innovative & wide ranging menu makes this a must stop on your dining circuit (in Uptown, Louisiana exit off I-40).  Warning: portions are generous, so it's easy to over-order.  Also, it's a popular & busy place and they only take reservations for parties over six.  Belly up to the bar for an assortment of tap beers."
Fatima Z.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,16,109,3.0,3/26/2014,"Cross your fingers for a good server! Either they're great, or they ignore you. That's what the whole experience depends on.  It's a nice environment. There's always a TV to watch! It's a huge place. I love the food but I hate that they change their menu every time I come. I prefer the lunch menu to the normal one. All in all the menu is pretty confusing though.  I liked the watermelon salad but I think they got rid of it? They got rid of a lot of stuff. All I tried is pretty much gone. Tortilla soup is good. I normally go for the unlimited soup and salad. Caesar is good but I had to get extra dressing, it was super dry. I feel like the quality of this place has decreased since when I've come before. Would love to try a pizookie next time! Hoping my waiter will be in a good mood."
Nellie Q.,"Decatur, GA",13,63,79,2.0,5/3/2016,"I ate there yesterday with some colleagues.  The tomato bisque soup is decent, I also had jambalaya, less than descent and I've definitely had better.  The bartender was a joke, my drink was a joke.  I will not be returning."
Craig E.,"Corrales, NM",27,35,7,1.0,3/31/2015,"I ate lunch here with my wife and youngest son.  BJ's is the worst kind of chain restaurant:  A big impressive design that lures in customers only to empty their wallets on thoughtless food and slow, indifferent service.  We experienced hour of wait time and a very un-attentive waiter that got our order wrong.  The food was totally disappointing - its not worth my time to describe, but the recipes are just wrong.  Yuck.  We won't be back.  I hate to give negative reviews, and I do't do it lightly, but judging from how inconsistent the other reviews are, I think its safe to conclude that providing customers with excellent food and service is not the corporate mission at BJ's.  Even it is, it isn't.  The beer may be good, but its good at other places too. So why go here?  Albuquerque has a bunch of excellent local tap rooms now.   For example: Nexus - great southern food and fine beer. Il Vicino tap room - good sandwiches, beer, and a fun industrial decor. Others include Turtle Mountain, Marble tap room, Boxing Bear, Tractor Brewing, Bosque Brewing tap room. If you must do chain restaurants, a better alternative is Rock & Brews - good food and a fun environment for friends and kids (play structure!)."
Travis F.,"Albuquerque, NM",26,38,24,3.0,7/11/2015,"Food is decent, nothing to rave about. Service is very hit or miss. The deep dish pizza is moderately good. The different house beers are decent. There is plenty of local places that have a higher quality of food and beer for the same price."
Callista W.,"Albuquerque, NM",21,37,28,4.0,4/20/2016,"My favorite dish to get at BJ's, for some reason, is the spaghetti and meatballs. I find their recipe for it delicious! It seems like a weird thing to enjoy the most at a brewhouse for reasons unknown to me, but that's my go-to food there now. I've also enjoyed their fish and chips. I would advise against getting the chicken fried steak--unless they have vastly changed the meat they use and how they cook it, I'd say it was one of the worst chicken fried steaks I've had. It was so chewy that it hurt my jaw a little to work on that! And it didn't taste amazing. But, this being said, I cannot get enough of the spaghetti! The meatballs are really tasty...it's one of the few entrees where, if I'm hungry enough when I go, I'll eat all of it (totally did this the other night!). Also, I adore their stout. I love the nitro feel it has--so smooth, it almost seems creamy. It's a nice dessert beer--goes well with their also-delicious pizookies. Their brown ale is also delightful. Easy to drink and has a nice flavor. The service has been hit-or-miss here. One night, I went with my hubby and we ended up waiting for service for about 20 minutes--the girl who was supposed to be serving us...forgot us or something? It was weird, since we were sitting the middle of the room, so it's not like we were hidden in a corner somewhere! And there was another time when we had a server who seemed to forget us. But there have been other times when the service has been fine. Last time we went, we had a perfectly nice server with helpful menu suggestions.  I like the atmosphere. It's a big restaurant--lots of space, but the tables are private enough that no one interferes with anyone else's time there. In summary, I'd definitely come here again. It's a fun place to go with friends for sure!"
Zion T.,"Los Lunas, NM",1,4,1,2.0,2/20/2016,I got the Sriracha brussel sprouts at BJS and was very disappointed. When I received them they were burnt to a crisp see picture below. The food also took forever to get. One good thing that I can't complain about is the beer!!!
Jenn H.,"Sacramento, CA",98,125,495,3.0,3/11/2014,"I brought my best friend and her daughter from Oklahoma visiting NM here for appetizers and drinks on Saturday afternoon. I came here once before, and for some reason remembered it to be a lot nicer inside than it was. ?  Anyway, we arrived on a busy Saturday afternoon, the wait was only 15 mins. We were seated and it took 10 mins until we were able to put in a water order, then about 10 mins later we were able to place drink orders and our food order. Our server was very polite, and I know they were busy...but 20 mins to put an order in...I don't know about that.  Drinks...Margarita (Silver tequila), Strawberry vodka concoction, and non alcoholic berry fizzy drink. All were very tasty. No complaints there.  Food..MEGA sampler platter and pizza. The pizza was thin and good, but nothing extraordinary. The Sampler Platter offers all the fried foods, southwest eggroll wraps, mozarella sticks, avocado egg rolls, and spinach cheese dip. The only thing that stood out was the Avocado egg rolls, they were really good. Everything else was pretty standard.  For the price...maybe I expected better. I wasn't blown over by anything we ordered. I might go back, I might not. Either way I don't think I'd miss out on anything. 3 stars for literally just ""OK""."
Lexus Q.,"Rio Rancho, NM",94,33,16,2.0,6/6/2016,It was good food took forever some of our food came out cold. It was okay service could be better but I would go back.
Linds N Kris S.,"Albuquerque, NM",40,3,5,1.0,6/4/2016,"Wouldn't give even 1 star, got here at 5:12, leaving at 7:31.... 2 kids' meals were bad, no drinks filled, terribly long wait for the comped MINI dessert, cake and check was wrong, still waiting now together it fixed. Manager comes by to ""help"" not saying sorry nothing just to refill drinks, and then forgot to refill my daughters drink. No traditional cream soda, forgot to give samples twice, another server tried to help out and was great, but that's it. Usually a good time, NOT today! Just not inviting or a good time. I cannot believe we are still waiting for this check to come to our table ""fixed""."
Tammera M.,"Albuquerque, NM",107,9,96,5.0,12/10/2015,Bjs artichoke app was great and the tuna app was cool. Great chips. Friendly environment and great lunch crowd.
J-Shawna A.,"Albuquerque, NM",208,81,65,3.0,5/21/2015,"I really cant say much about the food because I ordered a salad, however my husband loved the food he. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They were very accommodating as we had a large number of people we had for a going away party."
Rand R.,"Albuquerque, NM",63,422,57,3.0,5/4/2015,"Let me disclose up front that I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants.  That being said, BJ's was a pleasant surprise and I understand why they stay so busy.  The restaurant itself is really nice--nicely decorated, great bar, lots of windows.  They staff was very prompt, friendly and professional.  The food was good--not great--but good.  On this first visit I had the Black and Bleu burger with thin and crispy fries.  I've had better burgers, but this one was good and the fries were tasty."
Toad M.,"Alpharetta, GA",33,189,73,3.0,1/1/2016,I used to love this chain and their pizza... it is kinda just another chain menu and nothing special or fresh with the pizza.  The chicken chopped salad was pretty bad..... sad because I expected so much more
Yazz T.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,2,,5.0,11/3/2016,Gabrielle was our server havent been before but will come back to see her. Excellent recommendation on the avocado eggroll.
