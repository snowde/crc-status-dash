Veronica S.,"Albuquerque, NM",24,23,22,5.0,10/11/2017,"The food at BJ's is great. We had been to BJ's in Oxnard, CA years ago and didn't know what to expect as far as food and service in this location. The service was great. The food was delicious.  I took my 4 kids out for lunch and they were all quite pleased with their food. The Kids menu is thoughtful of kids' preferences. Many kids' menus do not offer anything but chicken fingers and fries. I appreciate establishment that take kids into consideration. My 9-year-old could not finish his chicken alfredo with broccoli, so he took the rest home. The kids meals are a pretty good size. We topped off our full tummies with a Churro Pizzookie.  The Churros were terrible, but the ice cream was great. We'll try a different pizzookie next time. We will definitely be back. Thanks for a great experience."
Miranda M.,"Los Angeles, CA",62,7,,1.0,7/26/2017,"My husband and I just escaped from this BJ's, he ordered a beer which took an unreasonable amount of time to pour. When he received it, it was ~80% full. After complaining, the second beer came 85% full.  It seemed like there was only one server working the whole restaurant.  We had to listen to a bus boy flirt with the table next to us for several minutes, as several other (maybe?) servers and helpers walked by completely blind to customers who had had payments waiting for 10+ minutes. My husband's burger was cooked into a hockey puck.  They didn't get either of our orders correct. We even had a camaraderie with the table next to us about how bad the service was.  We had to wait so long for the check we were on the fence about a fine and dash.  Worst restaurant experience in recent memory, never going again. If I could give it 0 stars I would."
Adam B.,"Albuquerque, NM",9,68,8,3.0,1/5/2018,This place is hit and miss. Both in terms of customer service and food quality.  I stayed from burgers once and won't do it again.  Good kid's meals.  Excellent root beer.
Trish R.,"Albuquerque, NM",32,4,1,2.0,1/6/2018,While I enjoyed the environment & servers I can't say the same for the food. I've been there twice & both times received under cooked (raw) chicken. While the dish was removed from the bill I did not enjoy my meal with my family.
Bruce H.,"Albuquerque, NM",4,28,,4.0,12/21/2017,"Really good food at a reasonable price. I had the quinoa shrimp and it was fabulous. Lots of shrimp and tasty quinoa, arugula and tomato in a light garlic sauce. My companion had spaghetti and meatballs (something I would not have thought to order here) and she said it was very good, although way too much for one sitting. (She took at least half home.) They also have a very good selection of craft beers on tap at very reasonable prices. I had the Lightswitch Lager - excellent. The waiter was attentive but not intrusive. I hadn't been here in quite a while and I had forgotten how good it is. Now I'd like to return again soon."
Barbara E.,"Roseville, CA",0,28,16,2.0,10/9/2017,I was so hungry after starting the day super early ballooning at the International Hot Air Balloon Festival. Stopped by to pick up dinner on the way home and ordered small pizza and roasted Brussels sprouts which I e had before at a number of Bj's and we're absolutely delicious. This was what I found when I opened my to go box at the hotel. Major bummer. Will definitely think twice next time I need to grab dinner somewhere. :-(
Iara M.,"Rio Rancho, NM",6,21,53,4.0,11/13/2016,"Went to BJ's on Veterans Day (Friday) with husband for a late lunch.  The place was packed and even though it was a holiday, the service was friendly and fast.  Husband had the Late Night burger and I had Bacon Cheeseburger. Both were delicious and very juicy.  We also ordered beers. Husband had Blonde and I had PM Porter. And that's the reason I am not going to give 5 stars to this place.  My husband's beer was ok but mine, OMG, it was completely flat, like it was the left over from the keg. I couldn't drink it. I told our waitress about the problem with the beer and she promptly solved the problem, asking me what kind of beer I would like and chose the same as my husband. And they didn't charge the ""bad"" beer. I would definitely return there and recommend to my friends and family."
Steph R.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,60,23,5.0,3/13/2017,"My my my..... BJ's, DONE RIGHT!  We decided to have BJ's tonight again, because we really wanted it & was it the worst decision of my life??? I THINK NOT! It was a wonderful experience!!  As soon as we sat down, Vince (our server) greeted us with coasters AND silverware roll ups. We ordered calamari, it came out swift & fresh. Vince let us know about the Monday night pizza special, we got the chicken bacon ranch deep dish. We got our deep dish faster tonight than we did last night when we ordered chips/guacamole & Calamari. The pizza was excellent. Lastly, the pizooki did not disappoint! (It never does) :-)  We sat in the bar. It was getting fairly busy. About halfway full & Vince seemed to be the only server in the bar area yet he did not miss a thing.  Food and service was phenomenal tonight, in true BJ's fashion.  I will definitely be returning & I definitely recommend this location."
Jordan F.,"Albuquerque, NM",195,53,38,5.0,4/9/2017,"We had to wait about an hour for our table, but the food, dessert, and service definitely made up for it. As we were waiting for our table, the manager gave us sample of pizza in the lobby which was a nice gesture. Our server was very attentive and suggested a dessert that forever changed our lives. It was a super sized pizzookie that had all of our favorite things. This item is not on the menu, but man is it worth every penny. We will definitely be back here!!!"
Tania S.,"Albuquerque, NM",218,624,1495,3.0,3/28/2017,"(3.5) BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse is pricey chain food, but delicious eats! Was here on St. Patty's Day for green beer! Daniel at the bar was very kind and prompt with service. Made sure we were taken care of and made some recommendations through dinner this night.  If you frequent, their app is a fun add for rewards and the like. I recall eating for far less in my high school days, but isn't that the case everywhere else now? I wish they had more local beers on tap, but my most favorite is their house Tatonka Stout. Give them a try if you haven't."
Sammie L.,"Albuquerque, NM",5,95,2,2.0,1/8/2017,"I am a fan of BJs, and we normally go to the uptown location, but we decided to come here for dinner with friends. I was so disappointed. The snobby hostess should have been our first warning that the place was going to be a disappointment. I guess she believes that smiling will give her crow's feet, so she opts for the stick-up-her-ass look instead. The guy who sat us shared her same demeanor. Our server was pleasant, although, he was very forgetful numerous times.  The food was equally disappointing. Our friends ordered spaghetti for their three-year-old, and it came drenched with basil. Who the heck decided that putting tiny pieces of herbs in a kid's dish would be a good idea? So, our poor friend was picking them out one by one. Veggies or herbs should not be included in a kid's dish. I'm pretty sure the veggies on my vegetarian pizza were rancid. It smelled and tasted off. I ate anyway because I was starving, but I kept picking things off because it just tasted funky. I just warmed up my leftovers, and took about two bites and threw the rest away because I couldn't stomach it.  So, overall, this place was not what I was hoping it would be. I would highly suggest that if you're in the mood for BJs to go to the uptown one where the staff is more friendly and the food is a lot better."
Mariah V.,"San Clemente, CA",2,8,2,2.0,7/6/2017,"Let me start by saying I've been to this location multiple times and have enjoyed the food and service. Last week I went for my birthday dinner with a large group. One person in my party did not receive his food so the waiter offered a soup while he waited for his meal.. nice gesture-all is forgiven. When his meal came out it was not correct so the waiter had to correct the kitchen's mistake. We figured that was just due to us having a large party so we didn't mind it too much.  The time comes to collect our ticket. This is where mass confusion hits.. another table's entire ticket was on our tab. You would imagine this would take maybe 10 minutes to sort out- boy was I wrong. 45 minutes later I still had not received my dessert I ordered, the manager couldn't figure out how to fix the multiple mistakes on our tab, and we hadn't received refills on our drinks. When all was sorted out we received a discount on our entire ticket. My biggest complaint is that BJs has moved to a paperless program. The waiter was unable to fix his original mistake of accidentally placing another tables order on our ticket due to the program. The next complaint I have is that we made reservations a day in advance but they still gave us only one waiter who happened to have the least experience with large parties. And finally, Management should have stepped in quicker.. 45 minutes of waiting after meals are done is unacceptable."
Felicia K.,"Erick, OK",254,69,96,4.0,12/9/2016,"Whenever I am craving a burger I come here I love their black & blue burger it's always so good! Their thin fries top it off well. I also get their hand crafter root beer which is off the chains!  Their down fall is their customer service of certain employees they have had a hostess who has a lil attitude which can throw your mood off right away.  Also, I had experienced a time where I was soo excited to try their avocado egg rolls but when I got it the avocado was not good which threw off the whole appetizer.  Other than that I've always had good waiters/waitresses and my food has always been pretty good. There pazookis are the best! Also, the fact that the are open so late is always a pl"
Karen M.,"Albuquerque, NM",36,208,123,2.0,7/18/2017,After taking a Yelp break and thinking about writing this review  - I am finally sitting down to do it.  Why do you do this to me BJ's? Why do you taunt with my emotions so?  I have such a love hate relationship with them.   The two star rating has nothing to do with our server because he was absolutely fine.....but the food - bleck.  Part of the dough on my daughter's pizza was still raw. It was basically dough with a ton of sauce. And  I would have really liked some burger to go with my bun. The food just wasn't good at all. I never feel comfortable sending food back so we went to the mall and got a pretzel.  It's unfortunate.
Stephany N.,"Placitas, NM",35,11,3,4.0,10/22/2017,"This place is pretty cool, has a laid back atmosphere. The beer is served in super chilled glasses, which is pretty cool and not bad prices for a pretty large mug. Burgers are great and so are the pizzas if you have someone to share with. Large variety menu and a full bar. Good place."
Jan C.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,2,,5.0,10/14/2017,"This is the first time I have ordered from BJ's and will definitely order from them again. I have not been in the restaurant so I can't  comment about the service, decor, cleanliness etc. I sure can tell you about the yummy  good eats so here goes... We ordered enough food to feed 5 people and planned for leftovers. The servings were generous, and we were able to sample a bit of each other's orders.  I was pleased with the flavor and quality of everything I tasted. The Clam Chowder and Broccoli Cheddar soups were thick, delicious  and filling. Salads were fresh and crunchy. Burgers tasted as good as their aroma. The only thing that could be improved were the chicken wings. In all fairness I need to remember I'm not in Buffalo, and give the wings a ""7"".  This brings me to another review for the delivery service GRUB HUB. See you there."
Tricia C.,"Rio Rancho, NM",65,27,57,1.0,12/28/2016,"I've dined here multiple times and the biggest issue I have with BJs Cottonwood is their consistently bad service.  Tonight was borderline ok. Ordered a salad and a club sandwich and it took 40 minutes for our food to arrive.  Which finally came after multiple promises of our food being ""almost ready""!? I've been a server for years and that means that the server forgot to submit the order.   The other issue i have is with the last time we were here, we were going to the adjacent movie theater. The MANAGER actually suggested we order our movie tix from BJs because they were $3 less per ticket.  So i agreed, tipped on the total, arrived at the theater and was told that I had to upgrade to the regular price of $11??? That stinks of an upsell scam.  So, in summary; the food is decent but the service is never good.  Even from the manager.  Ugh."
Rene D.,"Seattle, WA",37,622,1015,3.0,1/11/2017,"Meh.. was ok. My best flavor was the Brussel sprouts without the sauce. I ordered that on the side thank goodness. Root beer ribs were ok, slaw too spicy for me! Bf had soba noodles. Defiantly NOT like Thai soba noodles... meh.."
Corina D.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,4,,1.0,11/3/2017,"I use to love this place.   I don't know what happened, but the last 3 visits where undesirable. I am patient when it comes to the food industry. I always give them more than one chance at a bad experience before I decide not to do business with them. I figure maybe server had a bad day, maybe they were short staffed......  These were my last experience on three separate occasions  1. They did not acknowledge us for at least 15 minutes after we were seated.  It wasn't until my husband got up and asked the hostess if our server was aware that we were there. Our food traveled at snail pace and we had to wait 20 minutes to get our check. 2. This time they brought me the wrong plate and by the time I got the right plate my husband was done with his dinner.  Since I figured it would take a while before I got my food. My husband and I shared his dinner. When my dinner finally came around, we asked for a box. 3. Last and final time. We had out of town coworkers that we invited to dinner. Our server got our drinks wrong and Once our server brought us our food, he never checked on us again. We had to ask the other servers for extra napkins, water, flatware.  He did finally show up, but only to drop and collect the check.   It's too bad, I really wanted to love this place."
Tracy E.,"Lufkin, TX",22,6,10,5.0,7/7/2017,"Dear baby Jesus why have I not been here before?! This place is amazing! It being a brew house I figured it would have a large selection of beer and brew and a skimpy selection for food. Since I don't drink, i was extremely happy to see the amazing food selection. The restaurant was packed and we only had to wait 2-3 minutes for a table. Despite how busy they were, the atmosphere was really relaxed and the service was GREAT! As an appetizer we ordered the calamari. It was a little overcooked but the great dipping sauces made up for it. I ordered the Southern Comfort which is the chicken sandwich of all chicken sandwiches! Crispy, juicy, fried chicken breast, bacon, ham and Swiss cheese! No veggies needed for this bad boy! Delicious! My boyfriend ordered the two bone pork chop and MY GOODNESS! IT WAS HUGE! It takes a while to cook this monster but well worth the wait. It was so tender and so juicy and seasoned perfectly. For dessert we got the beignet. This was the true test since we are both lovers of the Cajun cuisine. It was a nice light take on a beignet. The strawberry and ice cream topping set it off. A little different since it had sugar and cinnamon instead of powdered sugar, but a delicious twist none the less. I would definitely make this a go to spot for the future!"
Nbsp S.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,11,,5.0,6/16/2017,"We love BJ's at Cottonwood.  Monday is our favorite day because their deep dish pizza is half-price.  We like BJ's Favorite which has their excellently spiced sausage along with pepperoni, onions, peppers, mushrooms and plenty of cheese.  We were hoping to see Gary but our new server, Jonathan, was lively and helpful...brought us a box and condiments to take home with the leftovers and had tips for reheating in the box.  In any case, all of the servers make you feel like they are glad to see you.  What a fun place! P.S.:  Get on their email list and watch for coupons and check out the Monday through Thursday daily specials."
Bryan M.,"Dover, DE",95,4,1,5.0,7/28/2017,"Had a mini bacon chicken ranch pizza and root beer bbq boneless wings, both were phnoemonal. Our server Gary was great and probably one of the best we've ever had. Ask for Gary's section!"
John W.,"Riverside, CA",2,31,14,5.0,12/27/2016,"Danielle, our waitress, was incredibly accommodating and friendly. We enjoyed eating at this BJs and will come back for the excellent service and delicious food.   Daniel brought us various beer samples to help us choose the perfect beer. BJs has delicious home crafted Brews and we ordered the blonde. We left feeling happy and satisfied"
Robbie S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,4,,1.0,10/17/2017,"Bad Service, Just OK food, I ate at BJ's last night --What a Mess, the server got my order wrong -My corrected order was recieved  after everyone else had finished--So they ordered a dessert and the order was received 20 minutes later. The best is we had two servers - one was a trainee and while the training server was taking our orders the trainer--was texting on her phone."
Amanda D.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,5,9,5.0,7/8/2017,"Ahi Poke appetizer is the best and my go to. I look over the whole (very large) menu each time, but I always order the same thing."
Sean S.,"Albuquerque, NM",11,102,204,2.0,2/29/2016,This was my first time eating at a BJ's. I found the food value was very expensive. The service was not very good either. I only got one glass of water the whole time I was here. My waiter never asked if I needed a refill or anything. He left my glass empty throughout my meal. The food took forever to come out after we ordered it. I ordered the all you can eat soup special with salad. I got the clam chowder with a caesar salad. Not sure if I will be back again...
Felix L.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,14,16,5.0,10/25/2016,Getting drinks and talking with friends! Getting tatonka great food good times. All the food is great ! Try everything I've never been disappointed.
Thom R.,"Albuquerque, NM",14,4,,1.0,2/26/2017,The wife and I went here earlier today (Sunday).  We requested real sugar for my wife's tea and were told that they were out of real sugar.  This particular BJ'S is within a mile of a Costco with boxes and boxes of packets of real sugar. So what if it's not the BJ'S branded packets. At least the patrons would have had the sugar they were requesting. Quality at this location has gone down terribly.
Jimbo T.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",5,162,3,5.0,10/10/2016,"We are loyal BJ customers.  They're consultant and delicious.  I have to admit the chain has been slipping.  We're here on vacation and came here after traveling not knowing we're to go. This was a very good location and service was excellent.  This is what really made the difference.  Our server was Gary. Thank you, great job."
Elizabeth M.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,5,,2.0,10/6/2017,"This restaurant has a really nice ambiance inside and its very lively. I booked a reservation for party of 9 people and when we got there we were framed into two small tables that fit four people each. It was very uncomfortable having to sit elbow to elbow with the other people at the table. We also had two high chairs that were also crammed with us. The children literally had no table space at all. We asked the manager if we could a larger table and we got told that as soon as a bigger table opened up they would mice us. Nonetheless we were never moved to bigger table and no one followed up with us on that situation, not even our server. I feel like customer service is definitely not their priority at this place. Whenever we would ask our server for any additional item such as napkins she would just ignore us and walk away. Very bad experience. Hopefully y'all are able to fix this issue."
Michael O.,"Albuquerque, NM",9,73,246,4.0,2/20/2016,"We took our out of town in laws to BJ's last night. It was our first time there as well.  I've got to tell ya, our experience was nothing short of AWESOME! Our waiter Maxwell was excellent! He was SO polite and informative.  Each of our meals were excellent! Fish and Chips, Steaks, Salmon, Tuna and Salads!  The restaurant is super clean! The employees were SO helpful!  The beers were vast and crazy delicious! The atmosphere was high energy and people, we literally had a blast there!  Thanks BJ's  for making my in laws so happy! We WILL be back! P.S., ya'll really need to give Maxwell a raise!"
Sammy G.,"Rio Rancho, NM",0,2,,1.0,9/22/2017,Horrible chef/kitchen cooks. Can't  cook a steak medium well until the third try. Second attempt was medium raw at best and side were cold. I will not recommend this restaurant in the future.
Dan G.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,16,,4.0,4/28/2017,This place is managed very well. Gets busy fast. Great easy access location
Eva G.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,15,3,5.0,1/5/2017,"Went back to visit for lunch. Our servers were Greg and Luke. Both were on point! I was so impressed with the service I received. My meal was delish. Both were very polite and very welcoming. Both expressed the many different menu options as well as the weekly specials. My glass was never half full, and plates were removed from my table once we were done with them."
My D.,"Burnsville, MN",410,48,1210,3.0,10/25/2015,So I had to give this place a second try because the first time I came in was so bad. Let's see the first impression of this place was wow looks nice. The food was good but the service was lost and slow. Sat in the bar area. Hoping to get faster service but in all truth that was also lacking.                 The food takes so long that I even forgot if I did order anything. When they get busy. Everyone runs around with their heads cut off. If it wasn't for the drinks I don't think I would have the patience. Ordering appetizers is a safe bet. Can't messed that up. But if you go in for dinner just be ready to have a long wait.
Melissa G.,"White Rock, NM",32,129,276,3.0,5/14/2016,This is a good place to go and hang out. They have a variety to choose from if you have picky eaters. Wait staff is usually nice and helpful and the food is always warm. Sometimes when it's packed it's hard to get in and the wait is about average. Plenty of parking outside so you don't have to worry about that. Overall a good experience.
Marissa D.,"Tempe, AZ",404,6,,5.0,8/6/2016,"Johnathon was our server and he was excellent. My mother had extreme allergies and he was very accommodating. Even the manager, Shawn, came out to make sure everything was good. We will definitely be back and appreciate the extra effort."
Chris K.,"Rio Rancho, NM",29,31,10,1.0,3/29/2017,Been in CA a ton of times so I know the restaurant very well and the food is pretty decent but rather good by ABQ standards. However unfortunately they still haven't got the service aspect locked down at this location yet I would wait a few more months before visiting this location. Stood at the door with no line and yet no one greeted us for a while so after making eye contact with 3-4 employees we asked if it was seat yourself reluctantly a waiter in the bar section said yes so we sat in a booth and then did not receive any service apparently he told no one we had sat down and again after making eye contact with every employee possible in clouding the manager and yet still not even a menu or a glass of water or anyone to even let us know they knew we were there we decided to leave and go to Buffalo Wild Wings now obviously the food isn't on the same level but I will say surprisingly their service was ten times better. BJ's is a decent place but like I said give them a few more months before you check them out because if not you will end up not wanting to return. If it helps any management reading this is was the night shift around 10:30.
Teresa H.,"Corrales, NM",5,29,15,2.0,5/16/2015,"I hope they get better at this location.  The problem started with the call ahead. The boy who answered the phone didn't actually put my name one the list. In fact, he worked the take out line and had no business on the call ahead line.  Do all BJs hire snotty hosts? Well, this was no exception.  Our waitress was nice & efficient.  The food came. I ordered the bison burger -- medium. It came well done. My table mate ordered medium well but with sauce on the side. So they mixed it up?  The bathroom was unattended and in need of a lot of attention. No toilet paper, few hand towels, trash cans overflowing.  The beer was good."
Shannon C.,"Rio Rancho, NM",0,15,,3.0,2/5/2017,The food here is good but wow is the service lacking! We went here last weekend with my parents for dinner. Our waitress was MIA most of the night. We only saw her to take our order and drop off our check. Other staff brought our food and we had to ask other passing wait staff for refills. I ordered a dessert to go and thought she would bring it with our credit card slip. No such luck! Turns out that would be the last we would see her. We waited another 30 minutes for the dessert to be brought out so we could leave. My husband asked another staff member to remind our waitress that we were still waiting on her. She never came out. We finally asked for a manager who brought the dessert immediately along with a $20 gift card. He apologized profusely for the waitress's lack of attention. And he and the good food are the only reasons why this location get 3 stars.
