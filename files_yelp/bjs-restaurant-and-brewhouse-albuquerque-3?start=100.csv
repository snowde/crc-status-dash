EstMar M.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,23,4,4.0,4/25/2015,"So far so good. The place was packed and we got seated as soon as we walked in. Rene (I hope I spelled her name right) was really nice and gave us a lot of info about the place since it was our first time. As always we started off with our appetizer of calimari. We placed that order and not even 5 min later it was at our tabel. Perfectly cooked and crispy but not overly crispy. Has a good flavor and two dipping sauces.  We both had the roast beef dip, it came out pretty fast. However the presentation of the food was not pretty at all. It came with two sauces one au jus and other horse radish. The sandwich was not packed right all the meat was falling out from the middle because it was all packed there. Our fries were all in the horse radish. If you don't like horse radish then your kind of screwed. Food was good a bit on the pricey side. Overall it's a good choice just not to happy with my fries all up in the horse radish. We will be back."
Teri M.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,15,2,2.0,8/14/2015,The food is tasty. You have different options to choose from. Aside from that you're waiting for awhile to get service. It took a very long time just to order drinks. Then we order food and our order got lost. We waited for awhile before anyone asked why we haven't received our food. Very disappointed!!
Lizzie M.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,1,,5.0,6/3/2015,"Walked in on a busy Wednesday night and was put on a wait, there were two hostesses who were just AMAZING!!!!  Usually hosts tend to be rude but these two girls were very nice and chatty with us. At first we got sat at a table by the bathroom and we didn't want it so the host immediately offered us another table ( which was clean) but we didn't want that one either and wanted another one that was dirty, the host right away cleaned it and sat us. Then our server was also just WONDERFUL!! He was very attentive to what we needed ( we were very picky) and also chatty. The food was awesome for a chain restaurant, the pizzas are hand down the best thing on the menu. The handcrafted sodas are delicious and the Jeremiah red was great! Definitely will be coming back. Great staff, great atmosphere, and great food. A+++"
Lesley B.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,7,,1.0,6/29/2015,"First upon walking in the young girl was not welcoming more like your 5 minutes early and thanks a lot I have to work. She told us to have a seat and proceeded to seat others ahead of us instead of immediately setting our table and accommodating us she sat several people ahead of us. Her attitude was not at all welcoming. This BJs is brand new and is already poorly cleaned. The menus where sticky and just not appealing not to mention WAY TOO much on the menu. The server was very nice , honest about the menu, which we appreciated, and informative since it was our first visit. We ordered our drinks and upon getting them I cheered my Dads beer and my glass bottom completely broke off and the beer and glass went every where. The server was very apologetic however the manager Miguel didn't seemed too concerned and wasn't very nice about it at ALL. He didn't even try to keep us there and rectify the situation. We will NOT return and good luck to those who do. POOR POOR management ............"
Mike M.,"Albuquerque, NM",33,2,,1.0,7/2/2015,"I guess you guys got the last $80 from me.  Brought out of town guests to your restaurant tonight and was thoroughly and completely underwhelmed.  Server was very slow, mostly because she had to talk to her friends (or family, hard to tell) at the table next to ours.  She never cleared a single plate or glass even after we took it upon ourselves to move the dishes to an adjacent (dirty) table.  My wife's salad had a hair in it fully visible to even a casual glance yet the server set it down anyway.  I guess quality control is optional at this restaurant.  When alerted to the hair the server asked ""would you like me to make a fresh salad for you?"" No, just pick that hair out and I'll dig right in!  What the heck did she think?!  When the 'fresh salad came out, the plate had a large chip in the edge...quality control anyone?  My burger was ""charred"" not 'flame broiled' but I was hungry so choked down about half.  Our friend's salmon salad lacked salmon.  The server brought it five minutes after the meal was served and it had clearly been microwaved too long, crusty and dry.  Saw the manager grab-assing with the waitresses but never once saw him approach ANY table to engage with customers.  At the end of the meal we asked to see the manager but after 15 minutes waiting decided to bag it and leave.  The hostess told us ""Quite a few tables have asked to see him so he's busy making the rounds""  Of course in the hour we sat there, he never 'made a round' and I could see the entire restaurant.  Haven't had this kind of problem before so was pretty surprised and embarrassed that this happened in front of our out of town guests.  Learned my lesson though.  No more chances for BJ's.  Too bad because I like the beer and the atmosphere."
