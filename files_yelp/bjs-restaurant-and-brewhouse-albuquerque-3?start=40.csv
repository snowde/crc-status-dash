Jeff M.,"Rio Rancho, NM",9,118,94,4.0,4/20/2015,"Straight up - I avoid chain restaurants. Usually pretty awful... That being said, the new BJ's Brewhouse near Cottonwood mall is GREAT! The NY strip was killer! My son had the crispy jalapeño burger, and loved it! Home made root beer was AWESOME!  You HAVE TO order the cookie trio dessert - called pizukis??  Salted Carmel, cookies and cream and peanut butter cookie - TO DIE FOR!!! Service was stellar!!!  Ask for Gary or Cheyenne - they were really nice.  Had a great time.  Definitely a new favorite."
Heather C.,"Rio Rancho, NM",0,13,1,4.0,12/19/2016,"They have everything on the menu, so it is a great place to go hang out with friends. Great beer selection!  Good service!"
Stacy M.,"Rio Rancho, NM",13,4,,5.0,4/1/2016,Excellent food Excellent service! Great for date night.  You have got to try the Berry beer with the Red ale.
Nicole S.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,2,,1.0,12/6/2016,"Messed up our orders two times at the same sitting. Then found a nice long blonde strand of hair when they delivered our pizza (could not be mine I'm brunette). They replaced it yet again, only to have messed up the order for the third time. That was the last time I'll ever go there. Too expensive for horrible service and bad food.  Update: Whole family has been sick with food poisoning. WILL NEVER EAT AT THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!!!!!"
Tom A.,"Rio Rancho, NM",0,1,,1.0,6/1/2017,"The food was good as usual, however my rating is for the service by the bartender. I sat down at the bar and the bartender asked me what I wanted and never made eye contact and went to shake the hand of another patron that had been there for awhile. Basically a drive by. I told him what I wanted and then he proceeded to fill drinks for other people.Then he passed me off to the other bartender. The drink didn't arrive for at least 5 minutes. If I hadn't been traveling all day and hungry, I would have left. The guy shouldn't be a bartender if that's how he treats customers. It'll probably be the last time I frequent this BJ's"
C Javier H.,"Rio Rancho, NM",46,12,,1.0,6/16/2017,"Terrible service! First they did not have the meal i ordered and decided to change it for something different without really explaining what the change meant. Then I ordered a drink halfway through our meal that got to the table after the check. The waitress dropped the check on our table without even offering dessert. When questioned she said "" it was a restaurant policy to drop the check as soon as the customer asked for carry out boxes"" Not. A good experience at all."
Devin M.,"Albuquerque, NM",70,1,1,5.0,3/15/2016,"This place has some of the best beer and food I've ever had, along with the great atmosphere and hospitality, I don't think any restaurant in the area can beat it!"
Vicki S.,"Jacksonville, NC",31,99,224,2.0,11/12/2015,"Went to lunch there because they were offering a free meal to Active Duty and Veterans.  It was very crowded due to the Veteran's Day Special.  We sat in the bar because there was a wait and we were very hungry.  My husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich and fried; I ordered the lunch special unlimited soup and salad.  We told our server that we were both there for the Military special when we ordered.  My salad came out pretty quick and it was a very small portion.  Our main courses took forever! It took about 30 minutes for a soup and a sandwich.  When they finally came out, they brought my husband a BBQ platter not a sandwich and my bowl of soup was about a half of cup!  We didn't care at this point to say anything, we were so hungry. The bill was messed up twice, the server assumed that my husband was the only military person, eventhough, we clearly stated we both were.  I showed him my paperwork and he was able to fix it.  This process took 30 minutes since requesting the check. We were there for an hour and a half!  Not sure I am going back to this location, I will try the one at Uptown next time."
K Z.,"Seattle, WA",6,3,1,1.0,11/11/2015,"Unfortunately, this review is not about bad food. We couldn't even get in because the hostess was terrible. We went outside to wait because it was very busy and we had a cranky baby who needed some room to move around, and we told the hostess where she could find us when our name came up. Well, we never got called. And when we asked about it, all she said was that she called us and we didn't show.  I've heard nothing but bad things about the service here, but excellent things about the food. Thought we'd give it a shot. Oh well. Lost our business."
Pilar C.,"Albuquerque, NM",39,4,,4.0,8/6/2016,"First time at BJ's, good food, decent service, and we're planning on coming back! Our server was less attentive and kind than desirable, but overall she did her job and we had a good time watching the game on their multiple tvs."
Lisa B.,"Albuquerque, NM",37,11,7,2.0,10/9/2016,"This particular BJs tends to have the worst service! Especially when you sit in the bar. The staff will often stand around chat with each other while the manager stands by and watches. There was a particular evening I was in and I watched the manager just stand to the side and watch his staff consistently be off task but he did nothing about it. I'm sorry but not matter how long you stare at them, they aren't going work harder until you say something. Anytime I sit in the bar, with the exception of being right at the bar, I am here for an obnoxiously long time. Not because I can't decided what I want, but because I'm waiting on my server."
Amanda G.,"Corrales, NM",120,83,67,4.0,8/25/2015,"BJ's is one of our favorite date spots; it is a place where we know we can count on for good food and great service. The staff at this restaurant are very friendly, prompt, and helpful. We have never had any problems with service. The food is good. I have tried the Mediterranean tacos (which you may like if you enjoy Greek yogurt), the veggie and goat cheese flatbread pizza (very delicious), and the ahi tuna salad (tasty but has some wasabi-zing to it).  As for drinks, I have really been enjoying their Temple of Stone IPA lately, and let me tell you- I am not one to like hoppy beers. This beer is an IPA for the weak. ;) I can enjoy it down the last sip. My boyfriend also has been ordering it lately, and can drink IPAs like no other. We always come to dinner at BJ's, then walk on over to the movies. Makes for a great date night."
Phil B.,"Rio Rancho, NM",105,38,2,5.0,8/15/2016,We love BJ's restaurant.  Their pizzas and burgers are fantastic.  They have a great selection of beers as well as gluten free options with their hard ciders.
S G.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,24,,1.0,1/31/2017,"I really like the food and atmosphere at BJ's. But, their service is just terrible. I had to get up from my table twice to go find my waitress! It's been like that the last 3 times I have been there. It's not worth the hassle any more."
Elizabeth R.,"Rio Rancho, NM",54,59,14,4.0,1/3/2016,Great experience today. I had the ziti and my husband had the Parmesan crusted chicken. Both were good and my 9year old ate everything! Definitely will be there again. Enjoyed watching football and the wait staff was excellent!
Peggy R.,"Melbourne, FL",27,319,24,4.0,1/10/2016,"We have been here three times, the first time was a 5 star experience (partly because our waiter was nothing short of awesome)  and our food was very good.  The second time was for take out and they were wonderful while we waited offering drinks and keeping up up to date on our order.   The third trip was just okay, not bad but they were very busy and that seems to be a problem.  Our waitress was missing in action for most of the meal and some of the food was not hot.  They made it right and we left full and happy. My one real complaint is when it is busy it is VERY noisy."
Joann M.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,27,,1.0,11/28/2016,This place had horrible food and we had the worst waitress ever!!!!!!!   I will admit that the first time we went there it was good food and service.  It has gone downhill since.  Will not be back.  This region is packed full of superior restaurants so I do not need to waste my time going to a bad one!!!!!   Stick with Texas Roadhouse and the Outback if you want good food and service.
Marqui R.,"Albuquerque, NM",35,173,59,3.0,7/20/2015,"I came here for happy hour to check out the new location.  I am already a fan of BJ's having been to the one on the other side of town.  I love that they have such a large selection of items on the menu.  The skinny cosmo was very tasty.  I like that they have a variety of beer selections as well as cocktails and wine for happy hour at decent prices.   I have to knock off a few stars for service though.  We only ordered one drink here for happy hour because the waiter only came by once and then we did not see him again for nearly 30 minutes.  I would have ordered another drink but by that point I was fed up with waiting.  Once we got our check it took another 20 minutes to get our receipt.  If service is this slow all the time I will not be back, I do not have that much patience."
Christina H.,"Rio Rancho, NM",14,13,135,5.0,5/20/2015,"The food was great  Had the Shrimp Lettuce Wrap, is was amazing! Jeremiah Red (BEER) was delicious! AND you have to save room for dessert! The Freshly Baked HOT White Chocolate cookie topped with Vanilla ice cream was a perfect end to a perfect meal!  OH MY GOD!  Couldn't eat another bite.... Great Birthday Celebration! Almost forgot to mention the Friendly Attentive Staff. Our waiter Chris was awesome! He made the entire experience even more memorable!"
Ricky M.,"Gilbert, AZ",197,632,23,2.0,5/6/2015,I have been to each BJ's location in Albuquerque and both of them are really similar. The service is slow and the staff is rude. I showed up on a Sunday afternoon when it was somewhat busy went to the hostess to get seated and she just kind of stared at me without greeting me after giving me a blank stare for about 2 minutes asks how many are in my party and then just turns around and starts talking to her co-worker after feeling awkward since she didn't get my name or tell me how long it was going to be I just sat down and about 10 minutes later her coworker comes up to me and seats us at a dirty table so after the dirty table incident our waiter takes our order and about an hour later our food comes out. Sure the pizza here was good  and the avocado egg rolls are tasty but the service here is just horrible.
