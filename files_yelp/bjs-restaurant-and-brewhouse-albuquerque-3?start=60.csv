Wayne W.,"McKinney, TX",89,164,23,3.0,4/17/2015,Very Friendly staff!  Good Food!  Eager to please as they just opened up!  Keep that spirit going!!! Had 1/2 Rack of BB Ribs and a few Jeremiah Reds!  Good overall but gave 3 Stars as we waited too long for entrees and loaded baked potato wasn't as good as I expected.
Robert J.,"Rio Rancho, NM",2,5,,4.0,4/28/2015,"My friend and I went to this restaurant on a rainy Monday evening. I knew nothing about the place and neither of us had dined here before. So my entire experience was all first impressions.  BJ's impresses when you first walk in. It's a very open and spacious bar look and it was pretty busy even for a rainy Monday. The first thing people may want to know about the place is that it isn't a romantic setting in any way. The ceiling is very high and it has a ""stadium"" like feel and there is a loud murmur from the crowd at all times. The only people you can hear are the people in front of you. If you're looking for a quiet dining, this isn't the place.  Our waiter was exceptional. He answered all our questions and was fast and courteous.  The first thing you will hear, (and will be a common theme) is ""hand crafted"". This buzzword is abused here. Hand crafted beer, soda, pizza, blah blah blah. Who cares? Does it taste good and is it a value? The brewed Beers are clearly listed on a giant blackboard so that there is no confusion. The ""hand crafted"" sodas are actually really nice as they add a great deal of variety from the common Coke, Sprite, Dr. Pepper (""Is Mr.Pib okay?) nonsense from every other restaurant... ever.    The food is where this place looses that fifth star. For what little I was exposed to on my first visit, it was delicious. My friend had a ""hand crafted"" pizza and I had a deep dish lasagna. We debated on the large selection appetizers. Ultimately we got a  pepperoni pizza dip that was creative and really tasty. But, the quality and the taste of the food was not the issue.  The price was.  Holy crap. $15- $17 for a personal size pizza? Really? I hate to be ""That guy"" but you can get a large specialty (everything) pizza at Dion's for $12.  Dion's is the freaking place to beat in New Mexico and every New Mexican knows it. Pizza places just need to realize and accept that. This may be a chain restaurant, but please do some research! There's literally a Dion's Pizza connected to the SAME PARKING LOT.   Aside from the pizzas, I perused the entire menu. There isn't a single adult entree under $13. When you realize what you are eating is pretty much glorified bar food, it puts that into perspective. It's hella tasty glorified bar food, but still glorified bar food.  One thing that I will mention, and this is either a positive or negative depending on your personal opinion; The menu is huge. When they hand it to you, you're like: ""Golly, that is a weighty tome!"".  All in all, I enjoyed my experience at BJ's and I have every intention of visiting again. I will be weary of the prices when I go in next time and I will probably get a steak if I'm gonna pay that much. The steaks looked pretty good. We'll see."
Terrance E.,"Corrales, NM",37,67,28,4.0,6/15/2015,"BJ brewhouse has always been good for us, whether it's in Phoenix, abq or this new one on abq westside. The menu is huge kinda like Cheesecake Factory where they have something for everyone. And the microbrews here are very good too! As for tonight it was busy Saturday and walked in at 830. Service was fairly good for our waitress being overworked. Food came out on time and was just as we have come to expect, good.  I was impressed that all BJs new locations import waiters from out of state to help train the new staff.  We had a guy who was from California that he been there for couple weeks training others.  So that right there tells me this place puts a lot into making sure all locations are keeping up there great service.   So like I said, this place is good as all other BJs we've been too and will definitely be back again."
Michelle P.,"Albuquerque, NM",25,103,211,3.0,6/7/2015,"This location is still new, so they are still working out all the problems. I will update as time goes by that they can find their flow to run smoothly. The food is good, same as the Coronado location. Service is bumpy, and the food runners are still learning tables so you get them coming by with food and not knowing where to takeit so they tend to just ask every table down the row. I been there, I have done the restaurant biz before. I feel bad for giving only 3 stars, as I know once they get runing right It's going to be a great place. But however I do have to review everything honestly. Definitely try their brews. I particularly love the red WITH their cider added, yummy! Extra spicy wings and their burgers are my favorite"
Reva W.,"Albuquerque, NM",13,2,,3.0,6/30/2016,"Love the variety of brews, and the food is decent.  the service is fair but the prices are a bit high for a chain. I wouldn't make it a regular thing but ok for a change now and again."
Isaac D.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,15,,3.0,6/9/2016,The food and management were amazing as always. Our server took forever and we had to ask him 3 times for waters and our beers where empty for 20 minutes. I would recommend the food but not the service
Joe M.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,8,2,4.0,6/7/2016,"Went to dinner tonight and the food was good. The restaurant was very clean, not too many people but the service was a little slow when we first arrived and took longer then normal to get my beer."
Frances A.,"Charleston, SC",22,7,4,4.0,5/29/2016,Great salad ....to bad the brussel sprouts were raw :(. Everything thing else was very good and very filling. Good music playing and Great service .
Ashley E.,"Albuquerque, NM",226,338,106,1.0,11/30/2015,"Yeah....methinks not. Awful service, bad food, long wait time. I really don't think this place will last unless there are some major changes. The food is not prepared with love and care, it is very obviously pre-packaged frozen stuff that's just thrown into an oven, fryer, etc. Save yourself some money, time, and exasperation and go elsewhere."
Jesse C.,"Rio Rancho, NM",1,97,14,3.0,9/18/2016,Service was good..food was ok a bit pricey ..17 bux for a burger and beer..hostess looked tired or sad ..server was great ..all in all .i wouldnt eat here again..its just more of the same. the menue is boreing..
Cassidy Z.,"Corrales, NM",42,174,24,2.0,9/13/2015,"Let me just start by saying that I cannot stand having a book for a menu, which is exactly what is given to you when you are seated at this restaurant. Actually, you get two books--one for drinks, one for food. To me, its about quality over quantity. I want food made-to-order and made well. If a restaurant only has fifteen options, so be it, if it meets these standards. BJ's for all obvious intents and purchases does not. Its a chain restaurant so expect chain food. Not a fan."
Lena L.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,94,,4.0,2/26/2016,"I think I love this place just because it's completely random. The menu has something for everyone. They don't stick to any type of food. I like that. Burgers, chicken, fish, pasta, pizza, Cajun, Southern style....anything from cherry glazed salmon to jambalaya to tacos.  My first stop, I was pretty skeptical. It's just a big chain and I felt kinda meh about it. I ordered the BBQ bison burger with the Asian slaw, and I am now really sorry for being skeptical. That burger was really, really good. The BBQ flavor wasn't overpowering and I could still taste the meat. The slaw was nicely seasoned. I ate the entire thing, and I usually have leftovers. Not this time. The entire table shared the cookie trio with ice cream and everyone was  very, very happy.  I ordered their brand of berry cider and I was happy with it. Their beer isn't life changing, but it's decent beer. I tried the stout and was pleasantly surprised.  My second visit, I had the Ahi Tuna salad and again was happy. Tuna tasted good, and the salad had good flavor.  I took some family there who had flown in for vacation (they used to live here, so they have already been to all the New Mexican places). One of my relatives had the lasagna, served in a little cast iron pot, and it was really good. Just a nice, solid pasta dish.  I'm happy with this place. Chain or not, it's pretty good. Good beer, good cocktails, good food, and good service on the times I have visited."
Robert P.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",56,100,22,3.0,10/30/2015,"I have two very conflicting experiences here. One I would rate a 1-star, and the other I would rate a 5-star. Both experiences were with the same two people, at 10pm at night (after we got off work). Let's start with the 5. 5-stars:  The three of us sat at the bar and received great service. The bartender was extremely social and tended to our every need. He was on top of everything, recommended us great drinks, and joked around with us. The food came out great, albeit a tad slow, but it was a fine experience non-the-less.  For the one-star: We were sat down at a table this time by Amber (I believe, says she has a husband that works in the kitchen). She smelled like cigarettes, must have been after a break. She was alright in the beginning, served us our drinks and took our order fine. Now the kitchen was slow as heck this night, I don't know why. There weren't that many tables, either that or we all ordered at the same time. The food that came out was good though, no complaints on that. Where it fell apart was our waters were empty, and I was waiting to order another drink. When she came around we ordered drinks and ordered pizookies. We ordered the pizookies at around 10:50, and we didn't receive them until around 11:30. The worst part was, after we ordered our pizookies, without even receiving them yet, she brought us out our check. Dessert wasn't even ready, and you brought out our check? Not to mention we paid at 11:15, and she kept reassuring us that the pizookies would be out soon. At 11:20 she said, ""Don't worry I have a girl in the back that's going to bang them out in 2 minutes!"". Still, nothing until 11:30. To give us the kicker she gave us a coupon for $5 off $25 our next meal. What the f? Honestly, just an overall bad experience and no manager to be found. Very disappointed."
Lisa R.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,4,,1.0,8/9/2015,"My friend and I went in Tuesday 8/4/15 night what a disappointment. Waited literally 25 mins for first beer on tap with a half assed ""I'm sorry"" from the waitress. I finished my drink and waited with my friend until she finally brought his beer out, hallelujah!! She Said they had trouble with the hoses or something I don't know I'm not a bartender and really didn't care and At that point something should have been offered to my friend to offset the wait. Or while we were waiting an explanation with an offer of ""can I get you another kind of beer it's going to be awhile?"" ""Our manager can't seem to get his head out of his @&$"" is how I felt by then... But instead she avoided our table until said beer came out, weird.. Then, when I asked to speak to the manager he was unprofessional in his mannerisms and speaking skills stating quickly same scenario as waitress not acknowledging that waiting 25 mins is unacceptable and ""let me at least buy it for you.""  We Then had to ask for napkins from waitress to eat appetizers AND  she brought cocktail napkins no forks?? I thought when we asked she'd bring set ups? Maybe a fork for the avocado egg rolls but nope SO I had to ask for ""big napkins and forks,"" feeling like I was making a request from my friends 4 year old son. Was a mistake will not go back. As we were leaving I used ladies room thankfully or I would have lost my appetite as two toilets were backed up, the trashes both overflowing and icky stuff on the bathroom counters. Yuck!! I'll stick with Applebee's where if they screw up they make it right for the customer, and the waitress know if you're eating you need napkins and forks."
Nga N.,"Near West Side, Chicago, IL",5,3,,5.0,10/11/2015,"My husband and I visited Albuquerque from Chicago and wanted a spot to watch some Sunday Football with my sister and her husband and kids. What an awesome spot! Great food and phenomenal service from Jaclyn!! Made our family's vacation just a little sweeter! Great job, BJ's! Keep it up"
Mariah M.,"San Ysidro, NM",16,5,,5.0,11/15/2015,Service was good and food was even better. We were seated at a table really quick. Jaclyn was our waitress. She was nice and very professional. I had the baby back ribs which were awesome. My boyfriend had the BJ's classic pizza and he enjoyed that very much. BJ's is definitely our new restaurant for date days. Sorry Chili's lol..
Mike L.,"Blue Springs, MO",114,33,34,4.0,12/14/2015,"Great place for anyone who wants to watch football and either doesn't get the game or they are from out of town and need a place to watch their favorite team. Even better is the prices drop to happy hour level $1 off beers and $2 off appetizers. I love ribs, and the sliders are best with bacon!"
Marie M.,"Albuquerque, NM",24,51,67,3.0,5/31/2015,We enjoyed the deep dish pizza but the service was slow and disorganized. We had to ask for ice for our ice tea and we had to ask multiple times for to-go boxes. We just gave up ordering desserts.
Loretta V.,"Rio Rancho, NM",60,6,,2.0,8/21/2015,"Coworker and I went for a quick treat and I ordered a strawberry mojito during happy hour.  I had 1/4th of it left when the waiter came to bring my dessert and knocked it over. The person who knocked it over didn't say anything and left. He didn't come back to clean it up. When our waiter returned he didn't offer a replacement drink just cleaned it up finally! Am I crazy for not being offered a replace the drink??? Not my fault homie knocked it over! No water refills for my friend on her water either. I was so ready to leave a decent tip cause the waiter carded me when I ordered my drink! Too crowded, overrated, and lacking customer service. Lastly, wth is up with the parking lot and all its mini parking spaces!! Ok I'm done! Have a nice day!"
Jennifer B.,"Milan, NM",46,13,,5.0,7/18/2016,"Very good food and fantastic service. I had the hot ham and cheese sandwich with dijon mustard dipping sauce, it was great. I also highly recommend the peach Margarita."
