Pat S.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,34,,3.0,12/1/2015,"Been two times and just not thrilled.  I had to try again after a mess at small group lunch event the first time.  Very loud and very noisy.  Crowded and hard to move around in some portions of the restaurant due to table placement.  Even on weeknights.  Service slow at all points (getting started checking on drinks delivering food and especially getting the check) on both visits. Got dirty silverware and had to try 3 different servers to get a new set since I could not find my server.  Some menu items better than others as far as taste value presentation.  My girlfriend liked her fish tacos, my Caesar salad with chicken was blah.   A large menu of items and drinks to choose from. I will say if you can't find something you like you should quit. maybe part of the issue that I see and read about the slow service on the food. The building and restrooms are so new the only way they could mess that would be to not periodically clean/check them.  I personally will not be back unless coerced."
Jenn W.,"Rio Rancho, NM",44,366,76,3.0,5/10/2015,"I would honestly give this place 3.5 stars. We have been here twice - both times for a weekday lunch. Both times we were seated quickly and found the server to be efficient and friendly. The menu is massive - just about about anything you can imagine is served here...this might be why the kitchen is a little slow, not super slow...but expect lunch to take a full hour (even though we have been ready order to quickly). The food is solid chain-type food and has always been cooked correctly. It is easy to take the kids here because the environment is a little loud and distracting. I really appreciate that servers (other than the one assigned to your table) will run the food out, stop and check on you and refill drinks. This level of teamwork makes all of the difference for the customer. We will keep coming back when we are in the area and want a restaurant with a lot of variety."
Brandon H.,"Rio Rancho, NM",2,6,,4.0,11/19/2015,"Good food, great service for my son's birthday.  He loves the pizookie"
Stephen P.,"Clayton, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/3/2015,"Been going to BJs for 10+ years in California. Went here with family in abq. Slow service. Slow getting food. Missing orders. Won't get too nit picky about my salad, but was drenched in dressing, returned it and it came back the same way. Manager apologized for all of the above which was a nice jester but not much help when orders are missing and you're hungry. Should have offered something. Blamed it on his team, when he manages the place. Won't go back. Food was ok, nothing special. Should have had some beer, that makes anything better."
Alessandra H.,"Albuquerque, NM",27,11,27,1.0,4/27/2015,"Iv been to BJ'S brew houses all over CA and other states.. the service and beer was great... but the FOOD.. boo. I don't know what standards they hold but the BJS in Cottenwood serves at best mediocre food. My kids Mac and Cheese? Kraft! ! The Black and Blue burger seemed burnt and doused in Salt. My pizza was a small began size and saposed to be for 3 people, with Raw dough in the middle. The tomato soupe was chunky and cold and bland. Campbell's condensed would have treated my taste buds better. And there Famous Wedge salade had blue cheese dressing and no crumbles of blue cheese as promised plus the bacon crumbles? After a bit of a search I found three. Disappointing all around the table. Thankfully our server saw our disappointment and comped the cold Kraft mac and cheese."
Emily S.,"Rio Rancho, NM",32,23,3,5.0,10/14/2015,"Went here for lunch and was totally impressed! Everything was reasonably priced, the ""snacks"" we're about $5 so we were able to try a lot of items! And they were totally vegetarian friendly, which was great. I can say I was happy with everything we got to try with the pizza to soup to fired artichokes. We loved everything so much we even got dessert! Our server was nice and was able to keep up with us continuously ordering more food. Definitely recommend!"
Jon T.,"Rio Rancho, NM",1,8,,4.0,6/27/2016,"Food and brews are always pretty good, a little pricey, but quite good. Service is a bit wishy washy, sometimes you get great service and an attentive waiter, and sometimes you don't. I have walked out because I didn't get service after sitting down for 20 mins, my advice is to speak up. If I have a complaint they are typically quick to make up for it, for example, we had no service for about 15 minutes after sitting down so I grabbed the first guy I saw. He apologized and found our server for us and gave us a couple free beers each."
Tony R.,"Albuquerque, NM",5,14,9,5.0,9/8/2015,"I think that this BJs is even better than the one in Uptown. Despite being very busy, my waitress was incredibly attentive and efficient. My beer was awesome and my food was fresh. Absolutely a great addition to the west side."
Desirae W.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,20,1,2.0,11/14/2015,"My friend had to send back burnt food (beef ribs), which as a plus for this place, replaced at no charge; however, the wait time was excruciating. We waited 20-30min just for water a few beers. We waited 30-40 min for food and had to send some back. Then we waited for the unburned food for another 20-30min. Finally getting our checks was fast but the waitress took an additional 20min to process 3 cards. If you have even following, that equated to a 2.5 hour meal that was only alright and very busy staff that seemed too distracted to have time for us. We did go on a Friday night but it wasn't crazy busy. I would not recommend this place."
Shane A.,"Stafford, VA",4,1,,1.0,5/16/2015,"I usually like BJ's so this is in reference to this location, not the chain. We waited 2.5 hours for food and when it finally arrived most of the orders were wrong. Then the waitress just constantly made up excuses for why they couldn't get anything correct. She claimed the pizzas were taking a long time to cook but they came out cold. When the manager was called over he acted pissed off that we were bothering him. On the way out we heard several other people talking about how horrible their service was."
Timothy A.,"Rio Rancho, NM",3,41,9,2.0,8/26/2015,"BJs has that corporate chain restaurant feel. Don't get me wrong, the food is not terrible. The gluten free cookie and ice cream dessert is pretty darn good. The atmosphere reminds me of an Applebee's with more beer options. I went once and probably wouldn't go again. I don't like to sound negative because the food was decent and the staff was very friendly but I am more interested in local unique restaurant options. Food trucks and ma and pa restaurants are becoming increasingly popular so going to a chain restaurant for me has lost all appeal."
Shelby W.,"Albuquerque, NM",9,12,,5.0,4/18/2015,"Great food, great beer, great atmosphere! This location has just opened, but it wasn't insanely busy as most new places are. We were told on a Friday night that our wait would be an hour, but were seated within 20 minutes. Very cool system that allows them to text you when your seat is ready.   Their deep dish is amazing, and the best I've found anywhere outside of Chicago, and I love that it's one of the few places I've found that has layered beer choices! We are glad this is in our neighborhood, and look forward to many future visits!!"
Thomas K.,"Fort Campbell, KY",0,1,,4.0,4/26/2016,God food and good company.  Bar tender Stephenani was very knowledgeable about food and how things are cooked.  Great time at the bar.
Daniel K.,"Albuquerque, NM",12,3,,1.0,8/4/2015,25 min to get a beer. Then the mgr asks if he can do anything for me. Really!!!! Should have at least comp that one. And 50 bucks for 2 drinks and 2 beers and an appetizer.  LAST TIME I EVER COME HERE!!!
Selina G.,"Whittier, CA",69,58,5,1.0,5/2/2015,"The drinks suck. The food was mediocre. The wait for refills, your correct drink, the bill....was effing ridiculous. Enough time passed where I just decided to write the damn review there. Blah! Never going back"
M T.,"Jupiter, FL",0,64,23,4.0,5/14/2015,Pizza is delicious!  Iced tea brewed to perfection.  Fish and Chips tasted the same as the French fries - bland and needed salt and/or flavor. Clean restaurant- nice staff. Team work is obviously encouraged - staff walking by our table offered to take plates or asked if anything was needed.   Our waiter was efficient and friendly.
Michelle T.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,4,,1.0,8/23/2015,"Went in with a group of 10, was told that the wait would be about 20 minutes. 45 minutes later after large parties who walked in after  us had already been seated and we were the only people waiting. We got told twice that the tables were getting cleaned off by rude staff and then we just left. Very poor customer service."
Kristen V.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,19,,1.0,1/2/2016,"Feel sorry for the waiters, the hostess is one of the rudest I ever encountered! Gets the patrons started with a bad taste in their mouths. (Hostess with tattoo on left shoulder)."
Megan O.,"Albuquerque, NM",6,1,,2.0,7/28/2015,"Our first, and only trip, was terrible!  First off, patio lover, and no patio??  The one across town has a beautiful patio. We did the order online and your food was suppose to be done, or soon after, by the time you go there...not so much.  We order three entrées online and ordered one entrée when we were seated.  Our in-house order came out before the online orders, by about 20 to 30 minutes.  So in total, we waited about 40 minutes  for our online order.  We ordered an appetizer that never came. The fish and chips were swimming in the lake of oil...and served that way!  There literally was a puddle on my plate !  We had those removed from our bill, without argument.  They seemed understaffed or perhaps not trained properly.  There were busboys training servers, servers clearing large parties and arranging tables when the place was packed, and servers hanging out by the computers texting on their phones and, again, the place was packed!  Our poor server was incredibly nice but didn't seem to know what was going on, or maybe overwhelmed.  They had him serving tables at one end of the restaurant and serving tables clear at the other end of the restaurant.  Lack of management I guess.  The only positive...the beer was pretty good.  I think I might give them a shot again, maybe just for a pint and an appetizer.  This occurrence was when they first opened by about a month."
Andrea R.,"Rio Rancho, NM",15,26,3,3.0,5/14/2015,"Meh!  Our server was awesome, she was very attentive carefully took our order, read it back to us twice.   But the kitchen still managed to mess it up.  No mayo tomatoes is what I asked for, my burger came with both.  My husband was plain with grilled onions his didn't come with onions.  Hubby ordered a salad and fries and I just had fries.  My burger didn't have fries his did, the food runner said ""well can you just take them off his plate?""  Thank goodness I looked at my burger before I ate it.  Sent it back, all they did was change the bun, which could cause a problem with a person who has allergies!!!!!   The manager did come over and asked what happened, wasn't at all concerned about it.  Didn't comp anything from our ticket, could have at least bought my $4 beer, or our app.   Disappointing because I KNOW our server did everything she was supposed to do.   It will be a while before we go back."
