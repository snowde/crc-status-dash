Melinda S.,"Plano, TX",90,136,547,4.0,12/4/2017,How do you know when a restaurant cares? They read the Yelp reviews and respond. My last review got the attention of General Manager and Business Owner.  I received a professional phone call that offered a sympathetic ear. They returned the reward points that I believed were gone. And forward an E-Courtesy card to come back and try them again. We sincerely appreciate the acknowledgement and we will go back.  I will update this review at that time :)
Rafaela D.,"Allen, TX",23,37,41,2.0,12/23/2017,"My friends and I came on a Saturday night expecting a good time, but was let down by their service. When I go out with my friends, I already expect cheeky employees to look down on us because I understand we look young for our age (18) but I have never been so annoyed.  First thing our waiter, sir Mike, says with a smile as he hands us the menu, ""So I'm guessing you guys will be ordering cookies tonight? And I'm assuming ya'll will just be getting water"". I don't know if he meant that as a joke or not but most definitely we felt slightly irked and insulted; obviously he was trying to imply something (And he wasn't completely wrong, most of our group came just for their Pizookies). I quickly respond firmly but respectfully with a no, actually I'll be getting a Coke and a regular bowl of clam chowder. My friends were still kind enough to tip him because he still did serve us and occasionally check up on us.  Joke or not, whatever cheekiness he had shown was all completely unnecessary because a PAYING customer is a customer."
Jeff N.,"Allen, TX",5,48,33,2.0,12/18/2017,"First off, where did our server go?  Someone else serves the food so I know she's not busy doing that, how come we only see her every ten minutes or so?  soup served warm (not hot).  Ordered salmon, served us chicken.  Steaks tasted awful.  Tender, but somehow medium rare and still dry, weird texture, way over peppered.  So they adjusted the bill, which I appreciate, but this was a pretty poor meal.  Tried again since my wife likes a certain salad here.  She just said, ""remind me to NEVER eat here again.""  Slow slow slow slow slow."
Dwayne W.,"Frisco, TX",9,170,86,4.0,1/3/2018,We seem to eat here about once a quarter.  The food is good and potions are big with prices being acceptable.  I would like to food to wow me but it never really does but we keep going back.  I love their beer and variety.
Laura W.,"Dallas, TX",541,207,584,3.0,4/21/2017,"BJ's is ok. If you don't know what to get for dinner or the person you're going to be eating with wants something completely different from you, BJ's has the biggest freaking menu ever. This location is as ok as the rest of them I guess. I've been here several times and I don't think they've ever surpassed ""just ok"".  Our server tonight took our drink order and like 10 minutes later he walks by and says he'll have the drinks out to us in just a minute. Then like 10 minutes later he walks by again and my bf says ""hey can we get those drinks?"" and the guy says ""oh you want to order some drinks?.... *pause*...oh yeah, that's right! I remember."" And then he left to go get our drinks. We literally talked about it 3 times.... really? A half hour later we went through that all over again when my bf ordered another blue moon. Except this time the server actually offered it. So he forgot what HE offered. **face palm** The BJ's favorite pizza was great but the Mediterranean chicken pita was disgusting. It was soggy and smelled stale. I couldn't eat it. Overall, we've been here several times and we'll be back. There are tons of options and it's usually ok. Just don't expect much."
Amanda R.,"Plano, TX",50,232,776,2.0,2/19/2017,"First time ever eating at BJ's. Started off on the wrong foot with the hostess.  The table was dirty and still had the previous guests payment on the table.  I told her this was a dirty table and needed a wipe down. She said it was clean. Returned with a dry napkin and wiped the table sending crumbs to my lap. What a bitch move. Seriously.  Our waiter moved us to another table. Hard to move on to greater things after being treated as non-worthy customers.  Internally, I was fuming. I'm angry and ready to just leave. My friend says ""I'm hungry up to you"". Girl talk translation means enough/feed me.  My friends salad must've been really good. She would have licked the plate on that Asian salad had it not been over board. I had the blackened shrimp tacos. The sides were awful. Chipotle sauce, greasy chips, and some green tinged mayo avocado sauce. The tacos were good. They also offer flavored teas. Which are good if you can get them to bring you a refill. States unlimited. I got one refill. (Fail) The menu is like reading  ""War and Peace.""  It is overwhelming, way too many options. Doesn't appear that they have one speciality food that makes them shine.  They do offer a large variety of beers. Our waiter without a name tag provided ok service.  Never been here and you guessed right, don't think I will be returning. Absolutely nothing here grabbed my attention as wanting to be a repeat. I perused the web site and found this  ""We are an award winning company with an ""of service"" culture, anchored by solid hospitality and guided by our compass of quality"".  That is so laughable!  2017/23"
Terri J.,"McKinney, TX",130,339,570,1.0,2/26/2017,"Update: visited on 2/24 around 6 pm. Was not acknowledged for over ten minutes. Ordered a steak medium rare. Steak came out medium well instead. Tried to get a waiter to take it back but gave up after 20 minutes. Partner also got a steak medium and his was also medium well. We decided to get a pazookie and it took over 25 minutes to come and ice cream was completely melted. Such a disappointment. Wanted to use mobile app to pay and it doesn't work. Downgrading to a one star as the food and service have completely gone downhill apparently.  ***************** Ok. So I'm updating my review as promised. Chris, the GM actually reads Yelp, and sort of cares about what we think, which I find pretty freaking refreshing. So thanks to him reaching out to me, I took my Manchild and our two kids, who weren't with us last time, back to BJ's.  I signed up for the online app which gets you lots of perks. Through there you can check to see if there's a wait, and tonight at 5:30, there was none. When we got there three minutes later, there was a ten minute wait. So I'd say that wait list thing needs improving, but we were seated by 5:40, so it wasn't a big deal.  Service was excellent this time around except for the very beginning. We didn't get silverware until after the salads came and after asking twice. Other than that, it was a flawless performance. Victoria was a doll and she smiled the entire time.  I got a wedge salad and it was great. My hubs got a sirloin that he said was better than Texas Roadhouse, and for him that's like the highest praise ever. It was cooked PERFECTLY. The pic makes it look small, but it's a thick cut and he got a salad (not pictured). We both had cheddar mashed potatoes but you couldn't really taste the cheddar, which bummed me out. I got the Parmesan crusted chicken, which, in all honesty was not great. I'd seen pictures of this crispy chicken dish and what I got was drowned in lemon sauce and soggy. It still tasted fine, but wasn't my favorite.  So here's the real update: I originally stated in my review that this place is basically just Cheesecake Factory. I stand by that, but here's the deal: unlike at the Cheesecake Factory, I didn't have to wait an hour. I didn't pay $18 for that chicken...I paid $13. This place is far more kid friendly, something we didn't notice when we came here the first time. It's not as fancy as the CF, and that's good for our 4 person family. The kids menu here is pretty fantastic. Plus, the cookie pazookie is just something everyone has to experience.  I can't give it five stars. It needs tweaking still, but I can say that before the GM reached out if written it off. We just left and we are already coming back to watch the game later this week without the odd and try out the happy hour specials. It's progress that wouldn't have been made had the GM not reached out. So thank you. Get the salted caramel pazookie and thank me later."
Ralph D.,"Grand Prairie, TX",2,30,23,2.0,12/28/2017,"So in my mind going to a restaurant involves the three A's....Attentive-Accurate-Added Value. The BJ's brand and product speaks volumes in terms of menu options and dining experience.  Not the first visit yet first time at this location and missed the mark. Attentive a C-. Personable server, meatball appetizer (delicious) comes out promptly alas no silverware so looked good for what felt like 5 minutes.  Would have enjoyed more if not luke warm by first bite. Accurate a D. Order of the Best Beginnings came out wrong unbeknownst to us until the correct order was served. An apology was given yet the dinning rythem was off. Wondering Who's order we picked on.  Added-value a F. Apology aside no attempt to make the oversight right or presence of a manager to advocate this is not the BJ's product.  Clearly the taste is great yet for this first impression no interest in returning. Just saying."
Brixton P.,"Dallas, TX",23,262,182,3.0,3/20/2017,"BJ's is one of the few places in the area that serves food late into the evenings which is a plus in my book.  A lot of restaurants nearby close by 9 pm which makes this place very busy on the weekends.  We opted for healthy-lighter meals like the Roasted Chicken Peruvian Quinoa Bowl and Super Salad which were both good.  Service was decent for a large chain restaurant but can be spotty at times. If you sign up for their email promotions, you can get great deals which makes you want to visit."
Tim L.,"Richardson, TX",0,26,,2.0,12/22/2017,"Front staff , not the friendliest....it took 10 minutes until wait staff addressed our table...ordered tea , it was so watered down I sent it back.  We ordered flat bread CA club, decent...ordered lentil soup, decent taste, But luke warm,  no crackers...also individual pizza, aka dough ball, so much dough I just gave up. These items call for better management, somebody was asleep on the job."
Dennis S.,"Dallas, TX",510,854,21,3.0,10/11/2017,"My wife and I went here for lunch. We have lived in the area for three years and have never been here. It is very nicely decorated and inviting. Our server did not find us for several minutes to check on drinks. When she did, they were slow to come. The food we ordered was pretty good, but again, the delivery time was unreasonably slow. Our server apologized for the delay but we did not understand why. It was not busy or crowded. Anyway, the food was not exceptional enough to cause us to return. Check it out, you may have better luck."
Lokesh P.,"Frisco, TX",5,23,11,3.0,4/16/2017,"This was our second time here.. again for a special occasion...  First positive points: 1. BJ's Brewhouse Blonde Beer:  very nice, light flavor.. 2. Raspberry Lemonade: Fresh and not too sweet.. my kid loved it.. 3.crispy flatbread nachos (appetizer): Really good, they made light on cheese as suggested and it came out nice.. they should cut the pieces better.. we struggled with it for few minutes 4. Veg Burger: I didn't try it but it was finished so assuming that it must have been good... last time the soya patty was not cooked well... but this time it was good 5. Vegetarian Deep Dish Pizza: Yummy, loved it... light of cheese and very finely made.. can go anytime for that Low point: - Service: It took 20-25 minutes for the first server to come after we took seats... about 45 minutes for order to come.. and got our silver after food was served.. - Rest Rooms: Horrible (Both Men and Women).. stinky, wet, slippery... Yuks!!! Basic hygiene missing!!! I was thinking of complaining to manager... but then did not do it... Good food... make sure you don't drink too much to go to restroom ... cut one star for hygiene and service.."
Jack M.,"Celina, TX",1,86,1,1.0,8/14/2017,"WOW, Shame on me for not reading the reviews before going here. My wife and I went here for lunch on Sunday, since it was early in the day we did not have any of the good beers they offer. Our waiter Christopher F came to our table in introduced himself, he asked what we wanted to drink. We both asked for Ice Tea and I also asked him if he could bring me a packet of sugar since I only wanted a small bit in my Tea. A couple of minutes later he brought us some Ice water and took our order. Someone else brought our meals to us. Christopher came by a few minutes later during our meal to ask how they were and asked if we would like refills on our drinks. I told him we would love refills on the Ice Teas he never brought. He said he was sorry and walked away and came back and filled our glasses. Mind you I was polite when I said this to him. When our meal was done the bus boy came and cleared our plates. Christopher came by and dropped the check at our table and said thanks and walked away. And yes the Ice Teas were on the bill. I had to find him and ask him if he had any clue what good service was because the Ice Teas were still on the bill. He took it and walked away and came back and dropped off a corrected one. Never one word of apology. The meal was very good and I can get good meals at lots of restaurants, but the service is what makes us go back to a lot of places. When people ask why so many restaurants close down I tell them there's a good chance they had poor service. Also when done we could not find a manager to talk with. You need to fix your service if you want to stay in business."
Syprine H.,"Cerritos, CA",23,1,1,4.0,12/8/2017,"Food was good, but service sucked! Waitress was very incompetent. she wasn't familiar with the menu, forgot to bring us ketchup and charged full price for happy hour deal. When we asked for exrra plates, she brought us plates that were completely wet."
Gloria C.,"Allen, TX",159,213,633,4.0,8/8/2016,Came for a late night dessert after a concert at the Allen event center. This was one of the few places that were open past 10. All my husband and I wanted was the pizookie but it's been a while since we've been here so I forgot all of the different kinds they had. I was craving salty and sweet so salted caramel it was going to be. It comes in a mini pan so it's right out of the oven. The cookie is so warm and gooey plus the added vanilla ice cream makes this dessert so sought after when it's late or after a good dinner.  We had already ate dinner so we weren't going to get any food. The restaurant is big and there's a ton of seating available. There's a bunch of tv's so it's a great place to go when you're in need of food and also some sports action. Will def come back for the food.
Tara K.,"Dallas, TX",0,30,1,5.0,9/16/2017,"I'm a fan of BJ's and decided to give this location a shot while visiting from out of state. Excellent decision. I honestly have zero complaints! My husband and I went during lunch Friday, we were kindly greeted, and seated right away. The menu has loads of variety and their lunch prices are hard to beat. I ended up ordering the chicken tenders while he ordered wings and we weren't disappointed. Everything came out quickly, fresh, and tasted amazing. He'd recommend the rootbeer glaze if you get wings. Amazing! The atmosphere here was great too. Like I said, we were visiting from another state, but this location seemed to have a bit of a charm to it that was nice. Everyone was super friendly, our waiter was incredibly nice and on-point with checking in to make sure our drinks were always filled and our food was all right. Shout out to Matthew for being awesome!"
Jp S.,"Fredericksburg, TX",0,3,,5.0,9/12/2017,"Just came back to BJs... again, fantastic food and service. They always have the best of everything. If you haven't tried their brewhouse asparagus... it's a must! The manager usually comes around to ask how my meal was, which I really appreciate. Out waiters are always attentive... my drink is rarely empty!  Keep up the great service, Bjs!"
Karl V.,"Houston, TX",15,13,15,4.0,12/15/2016,"Went for dinner at this location last night. Service was great and food was alright. Ordered calamari and chicken wings. Pros: great service, friendly staff, descent tasting food, ambiance is alright, price is average. Cons: some food items could use some more flavor."
Trish T.,"Grand Prairie, TX",6,26,5,5.0,8/31/2017,I love this place as they have a lot choice of beer!!! Warm and good design restaurant. Even I made my engagement party here? They so nice to set up table for all of us for my of my extra friends came in the last minute! My daughter love lunch menu here
Jackson M.,"McKinney, TX",96,6,,4.0,5/2/2017,"Placed a to-go order for my girlfriend and me and came to pick it up. Walked to the to-go checkout where a server was talking to one of the hostess. Said hello to him and the dude stared me up and down with a cocky  smirk and walked away with no response. I just wanted some Mac and Cheese, not compete in a dominant stand-off as if I'm some threat to the woman he's courting. Won't describe how he looked or mention names because I'm no tattle tale, guy probably works hard. Maybe the managers should reiterate basic hospitality.  Food was good though."
Liz C.,"Allen, TX",8,29,2,1.0,12/18/2017,NEVER NEVER will I waste my time at BJs Brewhouse.  So fricken SLOOOOWWWW!  It's 4:30 on a Monday.  90% empty.
Ashish J.,"Bridgewater, NJ",111,218,958,3.0,6/20/2017,Very nice sports bar type place with very friendly service. Not too many veggie chocolate CSE but they are always s happy to improvise. Settled for veggie penne pasta plus a garden salad. Both were prepared in reasonable time and pasta was cooked really well. Big servings so bring some good appetite. Went by waiter's recommendation so did not spend too much time looking at the menu but they certainly had a good tap list plus quite a few veggie choices in the  pizza section.
Desmond S.,"Allen, TX",303,252,346,3.0,10/12/2016,"I'm not sure why, but I never really look forward to coming to BJ's for food or drinking.  I've never had a bad experience here. I think the reason is because it's pretty normal.  Nothing really stands out to me.  Don't get me wrong, I'll probably be back, but I won't jump through hoops to do so. The service here has never really caught my attention, it varies.  It's not horrible service, but not outstanding service.  And I mean never.  The food is good.  I've never had a bad meal here.  Just not a great meal either. On my latest trip with the wife and kids, I was greeted at the revolving door and seated a few minutes later.  We waited quite some time for service even though it wasn't too packed, but the game was on.  Our waiter was OK, not great, just OK and seemed rushed even though it was not packed. Our food came and it was good.  The food was warm and prepared well. Refilling the drinks was not part of the deal I guess, since the waiter didn't really come back too often to check on us. The place is clean, the bathrooms are clean, the staff is clean.  There's nothing bad about this place to me, just a bit underwhelming.  The beer variety is pretty good, so if the guys want to get together and have a few brews and watch the game, this place works."
Kimberly Y.,"Dallas, TX",12,247,154,4.0,8/8/2017,"I wish the lines weren't so long every time we go, otherwise we'd go more often!  The first time we went, we ordered a combo appetizer, clam chowder in a bread bowl, small pizza, and cheese burger with fries.  OMG! The food was delicious!  I am a huge fan of bread bowls and coming from New England I know bread bowls and BJ's has one of the best I've ever had!  It was huge, it wasn't so hollowed out that there was no bread to scoop with the soup, and the bread was so crispy that I ate the whole thing.  I LOVE CARBS.  And that is why I also finished the pizza I ordered.  It was a lot of food for 2 people to order and eat, but we did.  What can I say?  My hubby and I love to eat.  Our server was very attentive and we had a good eating experience.  The only down side was the long wait.  Maybe will try to go for lunch instead next time to see if the wait time improves."
Hea L.,"McKinney, TX",2,14,41,1.0,11/18/2016,S~~~~o bad management and receptionists... Waiting time 1hour they give to table behind us  peoples... We are so mad... Never go again..
Hayley B.,"Plano, TX",48,2,,1.0,9/9/2017,"After waiting several minutes to be seated in a half empty restaurant, we waited well over 10 minutes for a server. As tables were seated around us, they were greeted by servers while we were not. So, we left and headed to the BJ's in Plano which was awesome!"
Molly R.,"Frisco, TX",0,22,11,5.0,11/17/2017,"Always a great experience.  We had Mike as a server again today; great dinner, great service."
Devin E.,"Wylie, TX",44,37,5,1.0,4/21/2017,"Terrible terrible service tonight.  My wife ordered an Ahi Tuna Salad and I the prime rib.   The Ahi salad did not come out with the dressing.  The prime rib did not have the au jus nor horseradish.  The waiter never came around to check.  We had to get up and chase him down.  By the time the waiter had returned everything was cold.  We could not eat the complete meals.  We again waited for the waiter but no success, we had to chase him down AGAIN!  He did not ask about the meals (despite my wife's meal less than a third eaten).  My meal came with dessert which I had to again chase the waiter down and request dessert. (Geez).  The waiter's name is Zachary.  We will not be back."
Jarrod W.,"Allen, TX",75,3,,2.0,9/9/2017,"Food was pretty good. I liked that they had the calories on the menu. Service was mediocre at best. I want to be able to come back, but the service was bad enough I won't."
Christy D.,"Grand Prairie, TX",495,106,555,2.0,10/21/2015,"I never had a problem with BJ's service at any other location but this one.  First of all we walk in get sat outside and never get greeted by anyone for over ten minutes. We finally get ahold of a person to take our order and it ended up being the manager. (Thank you) because I felt like we basically didn't even have a server. The guy who apparently had our section finally decided to come by, no apology, not even a name. But whatever~ the food came out fairly quick and just how we wanted it. The stuffed mushroom is by far my favorite appetizer here ever! A must get if you love spinach & mushrooms!  I tend to try a lot of different things here every time I come, the pizza is good, the pastas are good, and the burgers are good. I specially had a shroom burger that day which was very satisfying. I wish we had room for their famous pizookie (giant cookie in a pan with ice cream on top) but I was stuffed.  Overall, thanks to the manager that made up for the lack of service we got. The food is good as always, but still hesitant to come back and give it another shot though."
Amanda S.,"Dallas, TX",506,175,133,4.0,11/19/2016,"I absolutely love this restaurant! They have delicious appetizers, entrees, desserts, and brew their own beer! What more could you ask for? My husband and some of our friends checked this location out on a weekday night with no wait to be seated at all. Our server was friendly. We specifically came for their seasonal brew, grand cru. They had a special going on where you can buy a beer and take a 15th beerversary(beer anniversary...youre welcome) glass home with you! The beer is pretty tastey, i would definitely reccomend it if you are a belgian tripel fan. Hubby and I also ordered the white chocolate macadamian nut pizookie...ugh it was flippin amazing! Its a cookie pizza, cooked to perfection, warm and gooey inside, with ice cream to top it off! Lol there were amazing things happening in my mouth! #laughingcryingface"
Joey L.,"Fairview, TX",23,1,,1.0,8/21/2017,"Came in on a quiet Monday night, put in our app order which took a while to come and then immediately right after the app is put down we get our pizza order which we put in once the app arrived.  Literally 2 minutes after it was put down...come on at least try and stage it so we get partially through our apps before you bring entrees. The food overall was underwhelming, nothing really special about the pizza and the artichoke dip was good but the chips it was served with were greasy and room temp at best. Only bonus was that the pizza was half off. To top it all off we had to specifically ask for the discount to be applied even after we had discussed it earlier with the waitress when placing our order."
Stanley S.,"McKinney, TX",3,69,7,1.0,1/2/2017,"Terrible last 3 times we've been here.  Half the tables were available all 3 times, but still a 30 min wait.  The last visit our order took almost 90 min to receive (for 4 people) and one of the orders was wrong.   Could they do any worse?   Very disappointed.  We used to love this place."
Darren M.,"McKinney, TX",0,14,1,3.0,10/20/2017,"Food is great, service is terrible.  Hardly saw the waitress and somehow got our table number switched with the table next to us.  So we had to keep redirecting food back and forth for them.  The menus are hit or miss to be sticky."
Jannat C.,"McKinney, TX",104,44,39,4.0,7/29/2017,"Honestly, I just go to BJ's for the pizookies. If you haven't had a pizookie, I would highly recommend it! Hot cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top is delicious. The rest of the items are alright and average. Nothing too grand going on with the menu."
C J.,"McKinney, TX",0,19,15,2.0,10/20/2017,I enjoy BJ's food but this location has the worst service and attitude. Drive to Plano and you'll be much happier.
Amy P.,"McKinney, TX",46,14,10,4.0,8/3/2017,I love their pizza and beer!! The biggest plus for me is they give my kids complimentary garlic bread and fruit while we wait. I think their biggest area of improvement is the wait time - it always takes soooo long to get the food! It's always super clean and I've always had friendly service.
U S.,"Plano, TX",0,19,8,1.0,9/28/2017,HORRIBLE SERVICE  no wonder they are not busy on Saturday night. Food quality is down the drain compare to what was before. Just cold feel all around will not return.
Katie C.,"Plano, TX",52,51,6,3.0,6/3/2017,"Their discount deals really do make a difference in keeping the check from being too pricey. It's often really loud and hard to have nice conversation. The food is inconsistent; something I will love one visit, is horrible the next."
Kaitlyn R.,"McKinney, TX",2,44,8,1.0,3/25/2017,"Wow worst experience I've ever had here, and I usually love this place. Service was SSSLLLOOOWWW. I understand it's a Saturday and it's busy, but part of our party had to go to the bar to get drinks, most of our drinks arrived the same time as our entrees, and our food looked like it was slopped on our plates like cafeteria food. I  asked for the blue burger medium rare, came out well done, thin patty (which wouldn't have bothered me but my bf got a burger as well and the patty was 4x as big as mine), burnt cheddar on the bun...my burger didn't come with cheddar, almost like they tried to scrape it off and reuse it.. I replaced my fries with Brussels sprouts... let me just say they looked like something a garbage disposal vomited up... I LOVE Brussel sprouts... I didn't touch them and they're usually so good here! I have a freezer bag of Brussel sprouts i can pop in the microwave at home at all times...those would have been a million times better, I am shocked they were plated in the first place, even more shocked they were brought to the table... nobody's food was cooked correctly. Idk if management changed recently, but something is no longer right here and quality has gone down the drain, it shows with servers, and cooks, customer service and quality no longer mean anything, sad to see."
