Barb N.,"McKinney, TX",32,219,96,4.0,1/22/2012,"Today, I was in the mood for something light.  Ahi poke sounded good and it was...Delicious!  We started the meal with a couple of beers.  I really enjoyed the franzar... hefeweisse dunkel.  It was so good with everything we ordered.  We shared the fried artichokes.  They are very very good!  The batter was very tastey with tartness of the artichoke.  Ahi poke is diced sushi grade tuna with avocado on a liitle julianned cabbage and the soy based poke sauce served with fried won ton triangles.  I love it!  My husband ordered a little salad with blue cheese dressing...kinda disappointing...iceberg lettuce, bleh.  Next came his ribeye with mashed potatoes.  Holy cow, that was wonderful!  Mm mm good.  The steak was a wonderful beefy smokey flavor and texture.  Steak is not usually my thing but I like to take a bite each time he gets one!  This was one of my favorites.  The steak and mashed potatoes were a perfect pair.  There was a hint of horseradish in the potatoes and they were so thick and creamy.  It was so good he gave me several bites of both.  YUM! This was by far the best meal I have had at BJs.  SO GOOD!  I can't wait to go back.  We may order the exact same thing again. Normally I would order the avocado eggrolls and possibly share a little pizza.  Although you can't go wrong with those, I'm glad I strayed from the norm today. Our server was named Kyle.  Good guy, great server.   The little salad brought my rating down.  If it weren't for that, this visit would have gotten 5 stars."
Stephen W.,"McKinney, TX",167,88,33,4.0,11/27/2011,"Went to this location for wife's birthday. Looks the same as all the other ones.....nice atmosphere, trendy, ext....Love their pizza's and the service we got here was excellent....ofcoarse, they have some solid in-house brews on tap I like to enjoy."
Jess L.,"Allen, TX",304,47,16,4.0,10/17/2011,"Foods always great. My only pet-peeve would be the portion size. Being a smaller person, I ALWAYS have lefts overs. Service is great, locations even better!"
Molly E.,"McKinney, TX",11,6,,5.0,1/20/2012,"The servers are very professional and friendly, the food is delicious and high quality. The menu is huge! Everything i've had off it has been good. But most importantly the selection of beers is great, they have their own beer which i've tried several times and didnt really care for but their vast selection of local beers makes up for it. BJ's signature desert the pizookie should not be overlooked, its a cookie cooked in a pizza pan with all types of yummy topppings."
Katsya A.,"Lubbock, TX",0,8,,5.0,5/3/2012,"Food is the exact same at both Allen and Frisco location. We originally had went to the Frisco location since it is closer to my boyfriend's place, but we had some seriously rude service there... stiff body language, curt short answers, eye rolling, deep sighing while I looked over the menu one more time after my boyfriend had ordered...after my appetizers were dropped off, my boyfriend suggested that we call a different server over and have him get us our check for the drinks and small plates that I had ordered and to cancel his entree. Yeah. It was that bad. I really enjoyed my chicken wontons, but that waiter really put a damper on our evening. So I finished them quickly, we got our check, paid, we left. I really like BJ's food, so we decided to drive over to Allen. We were seated immediately, and our waiter Brandon more than made up for our crappy waiter in Frisco. He kept saying ""my pleasure"", which I thought was kinda endearing/a mark of a new waiter, but that's neither here nor there. He was so adorable and prompt. I had ordered a few small plates for my meal (more thai chicken wontons!), and a few minutes later, he came back to ""regretfully inform [me]"" that the kitchen was out of chicken wontons and ""would [I] like a menu to see if [I] wanted something else"".  I've worked in restaurants, I understand that things run out. The way he handled it was so very professional and empathetic--he didn't roll his eyes or sigh once while I looked over the menu some more to pick out a different dish. No tapping of his feet, no deep sighing, nothing to indicate that he had ""better things to do"" than wait on me. I finally decided to go with some stuffed mushrooms instead of wontons, to which he said ""my pleasure"" and he hurried away to go put that order in.  Stuffed mushrooms were delicious, my other small plates were tasty (the meatballs have a liiiiiiiiiittle too much pepper in their marinara sauce), but that was easy to overlook with such a fabulous waiter. I'll be back and request you, Brandon. Please make sure ya'll have chicken wontons in stock! :)"
Kevin C.,"McKinney, TX",0,19,,1.0,4/2/2011,Too busy for their own good. You sure know how to make customers feel special (hahahahaha).
Jennifer P.,"Allen, TX",2,5,,1.0,2/24/2011,"We went there today for lunch and service was actually so bad it made me create a Yelp account just to let people know how bad it was.  We stopped for a quick lunch and it took them 2 hours to get us out.  They did at least comp the apps, since it took so long to get them and then also comp'd the sandwich they also screwed up.  My sons spaghetti was cold and my daughters Mac n cheese was burning up. I've had previous visits that were average there, but this has to be the worst service I've ever had.  Not sure that I'll ever return."
Dana C.,"New York, NY",14,40,354,4.0,6/26/2011,No matter where in the country I go the quality is always superb and the service is top notch
Ed K.,"Plano, TX",147,111,14,3.0,7/30/2011,"This restaurant, located just off 75, is a good place to meet with friends....it has both handcrafted and domestic beers....as one enters through a revolving door , the large bar area is off to the left with lots of tall tables and a couple of large screen TVs....the dining area is off to the right ....the menu has several entrees from which to select as well as appetizers etc.,...I had the Maui Pork Chop...which was glazed along with new potatoes, and string beans...the portion , although small, was just right for me.....wine is served in a carafe....."
Alex P.,"Little Elm, TX",104,148,1,4.0,4/3/2011,"I was there last week and I had dinner with my wife. One of the servers was busy, so the manager had taken care our order. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and they were fantastic. I also ordered a burger and it tasted great.. Top notch customer service and great food. I am definitely coming back."
J Q.,"Elgin, IL",0,6,,4.0,11/25/2013,"Went here on a Saturday night around 5pm, no crowd.  Nice atmosphere, casual yet with class.  They had a special going on 2 for $35 . . . one appetizer, 2 entrees, one dessert.  The meal was very good . . . had the calamari (seemed very fresh), blackened salmon w/rice & veggies (cooked to perfection), steak with mashed potatoes (would have been better if it wasn't over cooked) and a cookie chunk cookie for dessert (which we had 'To Go' bc our little ones were getting antsy).  The waitress was very nice but had to keep coming back to verify things for our order.  We'd definitely go back."
Jose G.,"McKinney, TX",0,5,,2.0,6/30/2013,"Went there for lunch! Staff very unfriendly! Hostess not friendly, no personality and hardly to never smiles! Sat down waitress got our drinks fast......Yay! Ordered apps. Apps was tasty..............Yay!! Ordered our lunch..............salad was taking long. Had to remind our waitress! Salad came 5 minutes later, then our lunch order followed 5 minutes later while salad is still being eaten! So food came and one of our orders was wrong and had to return Waitress apologized........Yay!! We asked for our check waitress came by dropped it off like it was a fly by in the movie Top Gun! Please remind your staff about CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
Kayla H.,"McKinney, TX",1,16,,5.0,6/25/2013,"This place is AWESOME, and you just can't beat the service! My husband and I are regulars at this BJ's, and it's all because of their amazing bartender Jeremy. He's hands down one of the best bartenders of all times, and we've never had a bad experience there. The food might be a little pricey, but it's delicious, and I believe it's well worth the money."
Leocris L.,"Chicago, IL",19,168,8,3.0,3/29/2010,"hmmm.. this place was ok. i'm not quite a fan so far. me and a couple buddies went here for lunch on friday. it's wasn't super busy, so we opted for a seat right at the bar, front and center. right in front of the main tv's. there was a good selection of beer on tap; i picked one of my favs- newcastle. i decided to order something exotic, so i chose the chicken fingers and fries. yummy. it's hard to mess that order up, so kudos to my lunch special. service was prompt, everything came out at the same time, and the bartender was friendly. thanks for a good lunch bj."
victoria j.,"Gaithersburg, MD",24,84,163,3.0,5/31/2010,"In general, BJ's has the best food and brewed-on-site beer, but I have to say I was a little disappointed with the Mediterranean pizza I had this time around. It was way too salty for my taste and it must've had a lot of msg b/c my body was dehydrated after that meal. As always, I had the Jeremiah red. This is a very strong red beer, a little on the bitter side, so watch out if you're the driver. If you haven't tried their beers, you may want to get the sampler and try 4 miniature beers. I tried the oreo pizookie for dessert (oven baked brownie topped with ice cream), but it was way too sweet. I should've stuck to my normal oatmeal pizookie. You can also do half and half with your choice of 2 flavors."
Sherry A.,"Allen, TX",0,35,9,2.0,7/22/2010,"Ehh not the best. They are very slow! We went once, and one of the people I went with ordered broccolie and cheese soup, and it took more than an hour and they finally came and told us that it was still frozen! Could they not have told us that in the beginning?! The food is alright, I've had better. Overall, not the best dining experience I've ever had. I'd try to skip it if I were you!"
Travis S.,"Auburn, CA",0,15,,3.0,9/2/2011,"It was hard to decide between 3 or 4 stars.  The beer selection alone deserves at least 4 stars.  This is the only place I have EVER seen Sierra Nevada Bigfoot on tap, outside Cali.  The food is good but nothing to write home about.  I have enjoyed the pizza here though and the burger melt.  This location is very convenient right off 75 and Stacy and the interior is what you would expect from these guys.  Overall a good place to go and have some food and driinks with your friends or just chill at the bar if your in the area."
Alex S.,"Mountain View, CA",0,35,,2.0,2/8/2013,"My friends and I went to this place for late dinner.  But after we ate there, our stomachs felt weird and sorta sick.  :/"
Elizzabeth E.,"Orange, CA",1,51,,1.0,1/19/2013,We went to BJ's on a Thursday night at 5:30 it was not busy at all yet it took an hour for our food to arrive and our waitress was horrible! I love BJ's but not the service
Moriah A.,"McKinney, TX",194,23,1,4.0,2/14/2010,"I am actually completely shocked by the other reviews of BJs.  My husband and I love BJs and are frequent customers of both the Allen and Plano locations.  One big difference I have noticed in mine and other reviews is the time of dining.  We normally try to make their happy hour to take advantage of the half price mini pizzas (you can't beat $5 personal pizzas and drink specials).  You have to sit in the bar area but, that is as comfortable as sitting in the restaurant if not better.  We have never had a wait and have always had wonderful food and beverages (their brewed Porter is my favorite and the hubbie goes for their root beer).  Their pizzas are pan pizzas and loaded with topping thus equaling my opinion of awesome!  I would hate that people are missing out on a great place because of the other reviews.  We have tried a few other things on the menu and have been happy with them however always venture right back to the pizzas."
