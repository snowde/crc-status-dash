John P.,"Bloomington, IL",144,79,377,3.0,1/10/2015,"Very long wait, very average food, high price for the average quality food. I doubt I'll be back to this place. Not impressed. Too many better options around town!!!!"
Rochelle C.,"McKinney, TX",71,129,98,4.0,11/30/2014,"Great chicken club sandwich (the garlic mayo ties it all together) but the skinny fries weren't edible once they cooled down. Great double deluxe burger too and really good service too. I just don't understand  why restaurants make kids' grilled cheese sandwiches with cheddar? $5.50 for a glass of milk and some grapes that were eaten from the other fruit served from the daughter's meal. The peanut butter s'mores Pizookie was mind-blowing! I honestly couldn't have cared less about the vanilla bean ice cream melting on top! Carmelized marshmallows on top of Godiva chocolate on top of a peanut bitter cookie? Yes, please!!"
Audrey L.,"McKinney, TX",4,5,1,3.0,3/13/2016,"The food is really good, the staff is really nice, the decor is nice, it's not really loud, the bar is really cool! But it takes FOREVER for your food to come out. It tasted good (the horse radish wasn't spicy, it was really sweet, which is weird) But don't come here if you're short on time! The pizookies are really good too! But they take a long time to come out too."
Jack L.,"Greenville, SC",22,535,342,3.0,2/5/2015,"I have to go to Texas for corporate meetings about three times a year, and at least once per year, our large group of people (about 50) goes to BJ's. This was the first one I ever went to, and I enjoyed myself. The beers are decent, but not the best in the world. The food is average and doesn't always seem to be fresh. Service has always been a bit slow, whether we have a large group or just a group of 4. The flatbread pizzas are probably the thing on the menu. I also had some Moroccan chicken that was pretty good, but everything else I have had has been completely average to subpar. With all of that being said, I always enjoy myself when I go here, so I keep going back whether mandated by the suits in corporate or not."
Michael W.,"McKinney, TX",143,13,8,3.0,12/7/2014,"This was our first time to eat at BJ's. A little word to the wise, if you are an indecisive person this place isn't for you. There is no theme here. There is Italian food, Mediterranean food, Burgers, steak and potatoes, Fish and even clam chowder in a bread bowl! I had a Jalapeño burger, which was delicious! I ordered it Medium and it was perfect! Being a Sunday afternoon, it was pretty busy. The service overall was pretty good, but I had to be on the lookout for my waitperson a time or two. The atmosphere was great. Lots of energy. Plus, there were plenty of screens to watch some football! BTW, they have a large variety of beers, especially local brews. I LOVED the Revolver Blood & Honey. If I was to compare it to a more popular beer, it would be Shock Top. My wife enjoyed her Chicken Alfredo and my 2 year old, Maximus, loved his Sliders."
Katie R.,"Frisco, TX",199,312,645,4.0,6/4/2013,"The avocado spring rolls are delicious. That may be all that you need to know. Oh, and they brew their own beers, so be sure to try those out! The service is typical bar/restaurant. Bar area is seat yourself, which is what we chose at a high top table. Their appetizer platter is only $17 and came with a lot of food! I was expecting perhaps 2 egg rolls, 2 -4 cheesesticks, etc. but those numbers were doubled! Such a good price for the quantity - without suffering quality.  Lots of TVs so there's always a game to watch or something to catch while you're there.  And I know from previous experience that you should try the pizookie.  Also, they have a loyalty/points club. You can sign up with the KEYRING app on iphone or android."
Damon B.,"Arlington, TX",541,287,77,3.0,9/16/2014,"OK, this is a first.  Normally when I go to BJs it's not during lunch time (no beer for me today), so it's nice to go during the day.  We had 5 in our party and 2 had the beef dip, 1 had the chicken Caesars salad, 1 had the lunch bbq platter, and I had the California chicken club. The club was ok, not great.  The chicken had no flavor and the sandwich was dry.  I asked for a side of mayo, hoping it would have been the roasted garlic mayo that came in the sandwich (which if it did, I did not taste it) and here comes regular mayo (dang IT). It did little to add any flavor.  The avocado was real soft and I thought it was guacamole (I even looked).  The skinny fries are a nice touch, but next time, wedge cut fries.  The club that I am used to has three slices of bread.  This sucker had two thick pieces which added to the blandness and dryness of the sandwich.  Will not order that again. The service was good, and the tea and waters we had were refilled.  Too bad I could not order a beer...and maybe the beer has always helped when tasting the food... Stay hungry me friends..."
Robin L.,"Kingwood, Houston, TX",19,67,57,3.0,3/1/2016,"stopped in while visiting some friends in the area. Not bad, but in the same vein as Applebee's, etc. Good for the prices, but don't get too excited if its not all that. Good value for the prices."
Ronnie S.,"Lawrenceville, GA",275,71,39,5.0,11/25/2015,"BJ's is an excellent resturant to go as a group. My first experience was amazing! The waitress was nice and explained the menu very well. We ordered the 24"" chicken bacon ranch deep dish pizza. It tasted very good and well worth $24.95 which we split. Along with that we also ordered the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. What a great way to end the night off with."
Aaron C.,"McKinney, TX",24,14,3,2.0,7/15/2014,"Preface: Service by waitress was average to above average. My personal dish, the beef dip, was standard for this restaurant.  No issues. My partners dish: Absolutely wrong on many levels. She ordered the new top sirloin with white cheddar mash and asparagus.  First attempt came out burnt, way over medium and clearly blackened.  The seasoning was overpowering and carbon flavored as well.  The second attempt was delayed because they were busy, I can only assume we weren't made a priority and had to wait in queue with the rest of the food orders.  I was finished and had a box for my leftovers before she got her second attempt.   Round Two: Second steak not as badly burned, but they decided to leave the side that was burned on top as the presentation side like a big fuck you.  Had to scrape off the over powering seasoning again because they apparently felt the need to choke the steak out with seasoning.  Mash was average, asparagus came out half cooked and some was raw. In Summation: We will never again order steak at B.J.'s, I can do much better at home on my grill, not counting the fact that I'm a chef as well."
Emily C.,"Keller, TX",233,328,573,2.0,3/11/2013,"PIZOOKIE. After I found out that my fiance has lived his entire life without ever knowing what a BJ's pizookie was, I made it a mission to deflower him and make him see what he has been missing out on. Unfortunately, the delicious pizza-cookie was pretty much the only good thing going on, food-wise, at BJ's. If I didn't have the vanilla ice cream melting into the ooey hot, freshly baked cookie to round off my meal, I would have been slightly underwhelmed by our dinner of buffalo burger and fried shrimp platter. While the buffalo burger was surprisingly good for being on the skinny menu, the fried shrimp was just typical American fare. Service seemed a little blah, no niceties but it was quick and to the point. BJ's. Go for the pizookie. That's pretty much it."
Christy J.,"Allen, TX",0,2,,2.0,8/15/2016,"I love this place, but the staff was very rude during our meal. We had a fairly large party, but it was reserved way ahead of time. I understand large parties are always stressful, but everyone was polite to the staff, even when they were downright being rude to us, rolling their eyes and sighing very loud. It was very unprofessional, especially when we are paying for our meals and celebrating an event. The service really put everyone in a mood, but the food was good, like always."
Dianna P.,"Placentia, CA",55,39,9,2.0,6/4/2015,"We come here a lot but I have to say, this has been the worst experience. Brought my son and his friend for lunch after graduation. Took them over 40 minutes to get outta food!  And they're not even busy!! My chicken artichoke pizza is barely warm, salty, chicken is super dry. Not happy."
Emma B.,"Prosper, TX",37,47,,2.0,8/16/2014,"We love BJ's and usually go whenever we are in the Allen area. The food is consistently good, but the service here is pretty poor.  I always order my toddler's food when we first get drinks so she can start eating and will be more manageable at the table. However, today her pizza was completely forgotten until we were almost finished eating our meals because it had ""gone to another table."" My mother-in-law had to return her salad three times because they kept forgetting ingredients/adding incorrect ingredients. Server was less than enthusiastic about serving us and while the food was good, I am not sure how soon we will be back at BJ's."
TXBigKahuna R.,"Texarkana, TX",2,57,,4.0,12/7/2015,"Wife and I had late lunch Sunday, she had the bbq pork sandwich and I had the new baked ziti.  The bbq pork was quite tasty.  The baked ziti was ok, it is mentioned as deep dish and sounds like it would be big.  Well, the only thing large on the baked ziti was the price.  The dish is very small and I know this is picky, but they served it with penne, not ziti.  Come on now, let's at least get the pasta correct."
Marvin F.,"Garland, TX",17,1,,4.0,12/2/2015,"Great food, great service!  Love the New Orleans jambalaya!  Keeps me coming back .  The service was fast and attentive.  Great after work dinner."
Brittani S.,"Lewisville, TX",1,27,4,4.0,8/12/2014,"We went to BJ's this past Saturday for lunch. Three children, three adults. We were seated immediately & they seemed pretty busy with it being tax free weekend. We asked for a booth and thankfully they had one! Our waiter was Trevin. We loved his name and he was just super nice! He was also quite helpful. Our only complaint (very minor) is that he didn't come to our table as much as we would have liked. This is totally understandable though. They were so busy & Trevin kept up his kindness and professionalism. I'd love to sit at his table again. The noise level was typical for BJ's too. Lots of families and cute babies there.  We ordered a few mozzerella tomato salads (so good!). We had pizza for the kids. A gluten free pizza for my gf mom. I had a salad and fettucine alfredo. Also we had a cajun pasta. Everything was good! We ate all the pizza. All the pasta. And all the salad.  Also, it was nice and cool in there which was nice after coming in from all that heat. Not a single person was in outdoor seating!  Typical BJ's experience! Just great."
Sd J.,"Allen, TX",3,18,8,5.0,10/15/2015,Matt at the bar does an awesome lemon drop martini!!!!!!! And the HH price is only $5 too AWESOME!!!!
Derrel A.,"Allen, TX",174,53,47,2.0,5/11/2015,"Wow... $3.59 for a simple side of mash taters for the baby. Server attention was quite minimal. This is probably a better place for work lunch, not Sunday dinner/lunch. I've had better at the Lewisville location."
Christopher W.,"Plano, TX",0,1,,1.0,3/15/2014,"I generally enjoy BJs but I think last night's experience has effectively removed them from my list of options in the future. My wife and I arrived to find the restaurant somewhat crowded, not unusual for a Friday night. We were told that inside seating would be 10-15 minutes, but if we were willing to side outside (in deteriorating weather) that we could be sat immediately.  Not expecting a long stay, we opted to sit outside. Apparently saying ""outside is fine"" is BJs-speak for ""I have influenza"" as we were sat in the farthest corner from all other patrons and were completely ignored at that point, without a single member of the staff inquiring as to whether or not we had been helped despite food delivery and clean up going on at multiple tables in the area. Thankfully I was amused more than upset.  After about 20 minutes, I called the restaurant's carry-out ordering number and asked to speak to the Manager. After waiting for a few minutes, I finally reached him, explained that we were already seated and asked if he could help us get some service.  He said someone would be out there right away. About 2 minutes later (way too long, given the circumstances, unless I caught him on the toilet?), he and a waitress came out, and finally we had our orders taken, ordering much smaller items than usually as we had little faith in the rest of the experience going well.  The manager also offered a free appetizer. I thought I had seen Dorothy and Toto fly by in the wind just a minute prior, and would have preferred an offer of an indoor seat instead, but the gesture was appreciated.  My wife was ready to leave but the experience was like a train wreck so far, and it couldn't pull myself away from it in case they messed up again. I wasn't disappointed. After waiting about the usual amount of time for our food, our entrees arrived, yet the appetizer never came. Refraining from laughing, I asked about the status of that particular item, and the server said he would check. A few minutes later, the appetizer finally arrived (potato skins) but they were overdone and very dry - oh well, they were free, we can deal. The rest of our food was good (burger and a sandwich) and at least one thing went right - the appetizer was indeed removed from the bill. The waitress was also friendly, but seemed a bit nervous - perhaps she was new? We still gave her a healthy % for what I hope was a unique experience. Overall, a terrible yet amusing experience that marked the end of my trips to this particular chain.  For those visiting this location, I recommend you get a drink at the bar before being seated to help you mellow out before your ""dining experience"" begins!"
