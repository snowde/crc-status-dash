Matthew C.,"McKinney, TX",210,312,64,2.0,6/7/2012,"I wont slam them, I won't slam them......Oh! sorry just praying for some patience. I took my family to B.J's for my son's graduation dinner on June 1st.   We had a party of 10 and had called ahead for seating (what I was told to do when I called earlier in the week for reservations).   It made no difference, as they wouldn't seat us until our party was all there.   Apparently the group behind us had parties showing up to their empty seats after we were seated.  How is that?  I frikkin called ahead and had to wait, looking at my empty and already set up table, until all of us showed up.  I decided to go with the flow and not get upset.   The service and atmosphere were very good.  The waitress was very nice, though she disappeared once in a while for a few minutes too long. We ordered a variety of things:   My wife ordered the ""pot stickers"" appetizer (6 chicken pot stickers w/ dipping sauce).   Looked good and was tasty.  For what it was, the price was a bit out of bounds, being $6.95.   She also ordered the lettuce wraps, and she ate about half of it, and boxed the rest to go. The Mom in Law  ordered a ""Crispy Chicken sandwich"".  It looked good, but she only ate half of it and picked at the second piece of chicken in it.   The chicken looked like the ready made breaded tenders you get frozen at Walmart.  She said the wedge fries were good.   The burger had heat wilted (from the chicken) shredded ice berg lettuce on it which made it look cheap.  She didn't box any leftovers. The three boys with us ordered medium (12inch) deep dish pizza's for a whopping $17.25 each.  Ouch!   They eat like horses, and neither had eaten more than a couple of slices before we left.  These got boxed, as I know they will eat them later.   The youngest ate the rest of his later that evening. I ordered the T.v. advertised ""Crispy Jalapeno Burger"".   It was nearly cold when I got it, the same issue as the Mom in Law, wilted crappy ice berg lettuce.   The patty was not hot, not seasoned well, overdone, dry, and not good tasting.   I would have been happier with a Big Mac.   This two-part dinner set me back $10.25 cents.   The fries were good!    The beers and drinks are tasty.  I usually won't spend $5.50 for a beer, or $6.95 for a glass of wine.   Did it this once to please the ladies.   Dang! This  place needs a new name!  Change it from ""B.J's"" to ""Screwed""!"
Phoebe H.,"Frisco, TX",58,75,,3.0,9/21/2015,I love love love BJ's pizza and  that's pretty much all I order when we go here. My husband likes a lot of the other menu items but I am unimpressed with them. Not good enough to be wasting my valuable and limited calories on. I only go back for the deep dish pizza that takes half an hour to order. Yum.
D D.,"Houston, TX",8,56,43,5.0,5/11/2015,"Had a revolver blood and honey beer and the Spicy Pig Tavern Pizza ( ham, bacon, jalapeños and pineapples).  The tavern pizzas ( 6 different types),  have a real thin nicely charred crust. Good and crispy! It was nice to ""indulge"" on some tasty pizza without feeling totally bloated afterward."
Jeffrey D.,"McKinney, TX",10,21,2,4.0,6/4/2015,Best experience here by far. Our server Zeb was fantastic. He was great interacting with my kids and super friendly. Good was fantastic.  My wife had the barbacoa chicken and loved it!  Kids meals were great as well. I had the bacon cheeseburger and it was huge and delicious. Overall a great experience tonight. Very pleased overall!
Chris W.,"McKinney, TX",2664,646,963,3.0,3/25/2014,"This was my first time at a BJs.  I arrived on a busy Saturday night.  There was a 30 minute wait for a table of two. It was crowded at the bar so we had to wait at the front.  When we were seated my husband and I started with fried cheese sticks.  My husband picked them since they don't serve queso.  I really get overwhelmed when a menu is a book or when a restaurant is American fare and serves everything.  I asked the server what they liked to eat,  so I took his recommendation of the chicken lettuce wraps.  They were good, were light, but filling.  My husband ordered a burger and said it was OK.  There was nothing outstanding about this place to make us go back, unless a friend wanted to meet there."
Frank L.,"Allen, TX",0,1,1,2.0,11/21/2014,"The food was horrible, I had rib eye medium, but they give me well done and one side is burt. The service was okay"
Bill B.,"Dallas, TX",102,580,1772,5.0,8/5/2015,"We had a very simple lunch, salad and soup. I opted for the Caesar salad along with tortilla soup and my spouse opted for the garden salad along with clam chowder. My salad was excellent. I would prefer the tortilla soup not have the added thickner which it did. Not a lot of chicken in the chicken tortilla soup. The spices were about right for me but too spice for my spouse. Her clam chowder also had the thickner in it which was also a little too much. The garden salad was fresh and the Italian dressing was on the side so she could add as much or little as she desired. The menu is extensive. Just about like a Cheesecake Factory menu. A lot of different items which seems to mean that they must stock a lot of food and the cooks must now about a lot of the times being cooked by them. The first part of the menu is all about the various drinks available. The interior of the restaurant is very nice and done up in mirrors, dark woods and good lighting. Wait service including seating and management checking on diners was very good."
Summer N.,"Allen, TX",0,9,4,1.0,2/26/2015,I called a couple days ahead for 8 people on a Friday. The manager was nice but wasn't very accommodating. Not only was he unable to help get a table but when I asked if another time was better he still said he can't. I then offered going somewhere else and he agreed. Very disappointing.
Laurie H.,"Allen, TX",2,6,,2.0,8/14/2015,"The food is really good, but the last 2 times I have been there the service was TERRIBLE!!! I don't want to go back for a LONG time! I was a server through college, and know what it takes to be a good server."
Faniie C.,"Allen, TX",2,4,,5.0,7/12/2015,I absolutely love this place and the manager Greg is super cool ;) the new burger bacon and brisket it's delicious!!! Great place to have a good lunch or dinner! ;)
Scott N.,"Plano, TX",0,30,,2.0,7/19/2015,"We came in on a Sunday night around 900 we were sat very quickly.  The waitress was busy, not sure why, the place only had a handful of tables which had patrons.   Someone brought us drinks, not sure who, but we did get them.  Once we ordered the food was brought promptly.  It was hot and had great flavor but we were missing food.  Asked the waitress when she came back where the food was, she went to look.  Eventually I got the rest of my food once I was done with my meal, how wonderful.   I guess it was my dessert. The table behind us was missing  a salad.  When they asked where the salad was, the response was "" I don't know,  I was just told to bring  out this food."" Good food poor service, that has been every time we have been here.  Which is why we only come a couple times a year."
Shana H.,"Forney, TX",2,17,,5.0,4/11/2016,"Other than the long wait, experience was great!  Service was super!  Food was awesome as always!!  Great place if you need a wide selection of good food!!!"
Harry M.,"Plano, TX",0,7,,1.0,9/7/2015,"Start with ice tea - about 3 ice cubes in each glass; had to ask for sweetener, had to ask for lemon. Order fish and chips - partner meal came 10 minutes before mine although the server said ""your meal will be out immediately, I promise"". Had to ask for flatware, had to ask for ketchup. My meal arrived only to find there were 2 pieces of fish while my partner had 4 pieces!. Food was only luke warm. had to ask for ice tea fill up. In short, a management circus!!"
Nichole A.,"Frisco, TX",23,22,,4.0,6/1/2015,"Food was enjoyable, but service was very slow for how busy they weren't. I will give the restaurant a try again and see if the experience matches this review or if I'll need to change it. I hate writing reviews when it could have just been an off day for the waitress."
Chelsey E.,"McKinney, TX",0,3,4,1.0,7/19/2014,"If I could give less than a star I would. It took almost 2 hours for us to get seated, then once we got seated it took almost 20/30 minutes for them to take our drink orders. Then another 15/20 minutes to actually get our drinks. After we got our food our waitress only came back twice in a 45 minute time period. Once she did come back she brought drinks, while putting our drinks on the table she spilt two drinks on my friends and I. However after that incident the manager did come over and apologize and took care of our bill for us and got our information to give it to their head office.  Overall our experience here wasn't even worth a star. I definitely will not be eating here again."
Kimberly J.,"Justin, TX",0,8,1,4.0,4/13/2016,Love BJ's! I can not get enough of their Avocado Rolls! Don't even get me started on the cookie ice cream for dessert!
Allison E.,"Birmingham, AL",300,328,242,4.0,6/5/2013,"This place is just what you expect it to be - large restaurant with loads of tables, decent sized bar area, extensive menu choices (salads, sandwiches, pizza, pasta, etc..), casual atmosphere and decent service.   BJ's offers quite a few beers to choose from, including their own in-house brewed.    I am not a huge beer drinker, but I do appreciate a restaurant that brews in house!    I've been to BJ's a few times now (different locations) and each visit has included sitting at the bar and sharing apps.   My last visit was no different...  we shared the appetizer platter and it's a perfect size for a few people to share; the portion sizes are really generous and not skimpy.  The best of the bunch was the Avocado Spring Rolls - - perfectly crispy on the outside, creamy avocado on the inside.   Seriously outrageous. This is a good place to enjoy a casual meal, watch the game with some friends or even just grab a beer after all that Outlet Mall shopping!  Maybe during my next visit, I'll try a meal or even that Pizookie that everyone seems to rave about!"
Mike V.,"Allen, TX",54,294,129,2.0,10/29/2014,"I have to agree with other reviewers on the service. it has been steadily getting worse over the last 6 months. Also, I had the French dip, one cool thing I like about bjs is that they try different menu items frequently.. but today. the French dip sucked. whatever wack thing they did to the au jus .. was a total miss."
Travis B.,"Allen, TX",133,65,28,3.0,1/15/2014,"We went on a Tuesday night around 7pm.  Typically we do call ahead, as we did this night and went with a group of 8 to have dinner, and celebrate Codymans 20th Birthday who is in Heaven.  We waited I think a bit long since the place was not busy at all, but I am a pretty patient person, just hungry.  After we got seated our server was stellar and provided TOP notch service.  However, we waited so long for our food, and some came out warm at best, and the pizza our friends got, was not even hot.  We waited mind you over 30 minutes for our food, and on a not so busy night seems not right, and not once did management ask if we were ok.  Our server did continue to bring fresh drinks, and tell us our food would be out, but nothing else.  I feel we have had better service before, and it would be sad if this whole chain is having a lack of service infection.  This is also my 2nd review for BJ's, the other one was in Lewisville.  Still love the place though."
Sarah P.,"Lower Greenville, Dallas, TX",2,37,79,4.0,1/26/2014,"Good all around chain restaurant! I have been to BJs Brewery multiple times at various locations throughout my life and am never disappointed. There is so much variety to their menu, definitely something for everyone no matter what you are in the mood for! I usually order one of their salads, which are always amazing! Tonight I branched out and ordered the chicken Parmesan. It was very tasty. If you go it is a must to order one of their famous pizookies!! Baked warm cookie with vanilla bean ice cream on top, mmmm! A variety of flavors from chocolate cookie to red velvet to peanut butter and more. My personal fav is the classic chocolate chip! Check it out!"
