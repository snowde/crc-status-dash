Jennifer H.,"McKinney, TX",5,50,135,4.0,9/6/2013,"Took the family to BJ's in Allen, TX a few months back and they definitely have something for everyone!  Wide selection of beer from darks to lights.  The appetizers are awesome and the pizza is really great!  Lots of different styles of pizza to choose from.  They have a good lunch menu too.  The only thing I didn't like is when we went for dinner the lighting was extremely low!  We could barely see our food."
Lisa O.,"McKinney, TX",0,34,,4.0,7/29/2013,"TIP:  If you call ahead when you're on your way cuts the wait time. One of my favorite restaurants for casual dining.  Consistently good food and service with many healthy options. Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps are AMAZING and my personal favorite. Broccoli Cheddar soup in a bread bowl is SINFUL!  I have tried Thai Chicken Mango Salad, Tuscan Tomato Bisque, French Dip, Calamari, fried Artichokes, watermelon Feta Salad, burgers,  Avocado Egg rolls etc...  Never had anything bad here yet, well except a Pizookie (skip that ulnless you like a nasty underbaked cookie).  On one occasion I ordered Seared Ahi salad and the tuna was way over cooked.  Server said they get complaints for it being under done. What!  Don't order Seared Ahi tuna then! DUH! They quickly took back the plate and returned with perfectly seared tuna."
Michael J.,"Plano, TX",8,4,,1.0,8/30/2014,Normally good but waited 20 minutes today and had to walk out. Waiter never came by the table to take our drink order say hi or anything.
Mishari A.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,291,70,3.0,8/18/2014,I Don't know why I keep eating in this place even though I already know that I'll have a stomachache after that!
Jay C.,"Plano, TX",8,8,8,4.0,10/9/2014,Great pizza the sauce is amazing. Happy hour 3-7 Wells and specialty beers and food on special as well. Pzookies are amazing I try a new one every visit. Jeremiah red favorite beer.
Bill P.,"Dallas, TX",1,65,,4.0,10/18/2014,"Nice ""brew house"" atmosphere- really good menu that doesn't challenge the staff too  much. It's hard to knock a chain when they actually deliver on a consistent basis, been to several and they always seem to get it right. Always a line at dinner time so I hit the bar, there's always some sports on the TV but not so many TV's that you feel like you're in a sports bar. The place is kept nice and clean, have some decent ""home brews"" too as well as a decent wine selection and full bar.  Once again, these places are usually in the 'burbs so there's not a whole lotta competition."
Don C.,"Dallas, TX",4,1,,1.0,1/25/2015,Went to have dinner with my wife and kid. I arrived early and was seated in a booth to wait for my family. After about 5 minutes not a single person had come by to say hello or even ask what I was doing.  A family of 3 came in shortly thereafter and was seated 2 booths down.  A server immediately came and greeted them and took their order.  I watched as he went and got their drinks and came back and took their order.  Still to this point not a single person even acknowledged my presence.  so I went to the hostess and asked to speak with a manager.  she turned and pointed to the bar at a man and went and told him I would like to speak with him.  He looked at me and turned and walked into the back and sent out another manager.  If the manager of the store wont even acknowledge your presence why should the staff?  I wont state the obvious but I will NEVER go there again.
Luis H.,"McKinney, TX",159,7,3,2.0,4/27/2015,Went here on a Sunday night pretty busy waiter Tom Tom ? Was rushing us all night as previously stated no theme here they have a variety of everything hard to make a decision so I went with good ole bacon cheeseburger and thin and crispy fries I'll tell you those fries were thin and crispy and stale the burger halfway through the meat was dry whatever not my night my fiancée's dish was Parmesan crusted chicken really good ! We got the cream sodas for grand total of 51.47 now here's the funny part our server who was rushing us all night couldn't even get our check on time we told him we had to leave by a certain time gave him 15 minute notice in grand total took him 17 minutes
Brent B.,"McKinney, TX",100,107,,5.0,10/28/2012,"My wife and I went here last night.  The place was crowded.  On a Saturday, that can be expected when you arrive after 5:30. For appetizers, we had the avocado spring rolls.  There were six of them and they were excellent.  With the spring rolls, they have the hot mustard and sweet/sour sauce that you can dip them in. From there, I had maui fish tacos and my wife had a vegetarian pizza.  I also had a small side salad with the fish tacos.  There were only two fish tacos so I would not necessarily say that I left full. Because I did not leave full, we were talked into a dessert that was a heated berry affair with two scoops of vanilla ice cream that was unreal.  It was very very good.  It has been so long since I have had any hot dessert ice creams. I think this is our favorite restaurant and don't forget they have a variety of beers."
Leslie W.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,18,,2.0,3/14/2015,"Service was poor, food was adequate, and it felt like the longest meal ever.  Won't be back"
Shari J.,"Irving, TX",0,4,,1.0,9/1/2015,"Went to the Allen location yesterday with a co-worker for happy hour.  We have a few happy hour items, drinks and then get the bill. My co-worker has the mobile app that allows payment etc.. So after the bill is split between food on one tab and drinks on the other ($12.99 food and $16.99 drinks), I give my card to pay the food tab which I agreed to pay. The server swipes my card and brings back the slips for me to complete the sale. She takes the competed bill I've tipped and signed for and my co-worker stated that they've already paid their check on the mobile app. The server stated that she had to look for the mobile app transaction because she could not see it as competed on her end. She goes back to the computer and brings ME back the check I'VE already had my card swiped for and says that the check paid on the mobile app HAD PAID THE CHECK MY CARD WAS SWIPED FOR and closed the ticket..... So the higher bill was unpaid. Huh? I was  confused as to how another payment was allowed to be processed and closed out on the same ticket whilst another payment was still processing. I also did not understand how she couldn't find the payment from my co-worker but all of a sudden it was closed out and off of her computer. The server said she wasn't sure because of visibility on the mobile app being private. So I was assured that the payment swiped on my card would not process so I paid the $16.99 tab. The manager came over and gave about just as poor of an explanation as the server did of why the mobile app allowed two payments to process on one check but allowed the mobile app to pay and close out the wrong ticket completely. How do you not have any knowledge of the app related to services within your establishment works? Well after the server hands me back the original ticket I thought I was paying for and says that it won't go through because she didn't close the ticket out I am a little peeved because that is not the case. Both transactions were processed on my card... Even though supposedly one check had already been closed out on the app. So I do a little research on the app and see that it allows the person to split the check, pay for whatever they want or NOT pay whatever they want. My co-worker stated that they paid the balance that was left after my card was swiped..Interesting....that would mean the balance would've been $16.99.  So there's a red flag. Where is the disconnect between the mobile app and the restaurant's financial / reimbursement process? How does the app allow a patron to control the closing out of payments? Isn't that the servers job?  BJ's in Allen  Tx owes me an explanation because I'm furious. It's not the difference in bill totals that is my issue; it's the principle and lack of accountability by the staff. Not to mention the mobile app allowing the account holder to divide the check between anyone ordering on the same ticket to their liking/advantage  and giving them the ability to give the illusion that they've divided fairly but actually allows manipulation of the system that has now created a bad taste in my mouth with the restaurant and a suspicion of dishonest behavior from my co-worker. I'm going to contact the technical support for that mobile app and see if I can get my questions answered. I'm sure they have visibilty to transactions that are linked to table or ticket numbers especially when a 20% discount from the app was applied to the sale. What if a stolen credit card was used under a fake profile to pay for a check on their app? I'm going to also write a formal complaint to their corporate office for the lack of training and inability to correct the situation or truly show that they understood their app process in the first place. No app should allow the closing of sale by a patron until all payments have processed accordingly or allow another method of payment to be allowed to process on the same tab simultaneously when there is already a payment still in pending status that has not been cancelled by the MOD. I just want a true explanation and accountability; from all involved if the arrows point in my co-workers direction as well. I am EXTREMELY angry with this situation."
Melody T.,"Las Colinas, TX",608,639,2746,5.0,8/23/2012,Love this place! Super clean and I always sit at the bar. I love the late night happy hour which is sunday-Thursday's from 9 till close! It's super good. The bartender always remembers me!!! And always check out the small bites menu! The ma and cheese is worth every bite!!
Loni H.,"Allen, TX",19,13,1,2.0,6/2/2015,"I really came here with a friend to have dinner and a pazookie for dessert.   However, service was dismal.  We ordered sliders with wedge fries; spring rolls; and water.  My friend emptied her water and it took forever to get a refill, so she just asked for a second glass.  It took forever for our food to arrive and when it did the spring rolls were soggy and barely warm; the sliders were warm not piping hot; and the delay was because they were still cooking fries.  The spring rolls were inedible, so we sent them back.  By this time, my friend was tired of waiting and now not in the mood for any food or the long wait to follow.  My fries arrived at the table and were the only thing piping hot.  We had trouble getting refills on water and it took forever to get the check.  A manager did stop by to apologize.   I skipped the pazookie because it was clear that neither the kitchen staff nor our waiter were on the ball on this night."
Christina M.,"Karnes City, TX",0,4,,5.0,12/28/2015,"Love this place, the food is great! Fish tacos, California chicken club and the salted caramel pizookie are my favs.  Our waitress Samantha was amazing and super friendly, she recommended the pizookie and I'm sure glad I tried it, it was to die for.  First time bringing my dad to try it and he loved it, plenty of options for every taste bud.  He really loved the California chicken club with the super good toast as the bun and he kept saying how good the fries were."
Raza G.,"Munich, Germany",1,1,,4.0,12/1/2013,"This place is excellent if you just want to have a laid back time and relax. The outside sitting is very comfy and homely as well. They have a good beer menu and the bar area is quite good.  Prices are reasonable as well and the service is great. If you are looking for a decent beer + hangout place, this is it."
Brian G.,"Fairview, TX",0,10,,5.0,5/30/2015,Definitely my favorite restaurant! Tremendous beer variety at great prices. Huge food selection between $10 & &18. Fabulous service.
Brad N.,"Frisco, TX",486,1053,234,4.0,12/21/2010,"We visited this location for the first time after the Texas Stampede Rodeo at the Allen Event Center (great show, BTW). We had a friend who had flown in from out of town, and we wanted to get some decent eats if possible at this late hour.  It was quickly obvious that they served a limited menu after midnight, and we were very apprehensive to the point of almost leaving, but there aren't that many alternatives in this area, so we stuck it out. They were still serving their always outstanding pizzas plus ""anything fried"", so we chose some buffalo wings and pizzas; all were delicious and cooked to perfection. The pizza had a crisp crust and fresh ingredients, and while the wings could have used some more heat, they did have a good flavor. My Blue Moon beer went down nice and cold, and all in all, we did have a decent experience here despite the limited menu.  I know some will complain about the prices, but I'd rather pay more for good food than less for crappy food. I've never had crappy food at BJ's."
Jim M.,"McKinney, TX",25,84,2,4.0,7/18/2012,"Have gone to this location with a small group and a large group - always have been seated very quickly.  Lots of options on the menu from beer to burgers to salads to steaks - just a great selection of food. Love the appetizers - chicken pot stickers, nachos and sliders - yummy. Love the beer - normally get the blonde but enjoyed the pale ale and jermiah red."
Jennifer H.,"Frisco, TX",0,1,,1.0,11/7/2015,Saturday afternoon lunch. Understaffed. Poor waitress at the bar working hard with no help.  Food can out cold for us and others. Don't recommend!
Dylan T.,"North Dallas, Dallas, TX",0,2,,1.0,4/24/2015,Absolutely terrible service at the bar. Lisa (I think that's what her name was she never told me had to ask) was to busy doing her closing side work and talking to her coworkers to refill water and even ask us if we wanted to order food. Once she got me my first beer she never said one word to me again. And once I paid out not a thank you or a have a nice night just gave me he credit card receipt and walked away.
