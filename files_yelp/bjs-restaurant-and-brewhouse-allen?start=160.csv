Karen L.,"Dallas, TX",385,505,3058,3.0,8/28/2012,"Good food. Average service. They're always busy and the servers tend to forget to check up on you. If you plan to go on the weekends for dinner, expect long lines. Pizza is always a good choice. Salads are huge. Cajun pasta is delectable. Ribs are juicy and tender. Beer is refreshing. Definitely worth trying!"
Chassity F.,"Howe, TX",16,48,9,4.0,1/21/2012,"It has its good and bad. I went for the first time with a group of 8 on a Friday night. We had an hour wait and it was no big deal. We lost track of time so i asked the hostess how long was left and this was her reply ""We quoted you 1 hour and its ONLY been EXACTLY 53 minutes so hopefully within 10 minutes."" I asked nicely so I did NOT need attitude. A few minutes later they tell us our table is ready but we would have to site at two different tables. This was a female manager tell us that our group could sit at 2 half circle booths next two each other. Why would we go out as a group to sit separate? This was annoying! Finally we got a table! Server: I do not remember his name sadly but he was great with our group. Drinks: All the drinks we had were great! Our favorites were the Irish Root beer, Strawberry Patch, A Drink Like That (yes that's the name), Throw Back Cherry Cola, house Margarita. Food: Great! Large portions and yummy. I had BBQ pulled pork Sanchez and most of the people had burgers. I also had dessert. The baked bengiet. Almost as good as in New Orleans.  Overall I will go back and hope that management and hostess are not as rude."
Shariq A.,"Allen, TX",2,60,,2.0,5/10/2015,This place has gone downhill.  Filthy restaurant with mediocre food.  The 2 stars is for the exceptional service.  Will not be back and very sad about it!
Joe S.,"Allen, TX",0,1,,2.0,7/31/2015,"The place was very busy on a Thursday night but we were seated quickly. Service was slow, beer was great, food was lukewarm and tasteless. I do not think I will go back."
Jazmine D.,"Allen, TX",1,14,4,3.0,12/12/2014,"Ordered take out. The service was prompt and fast so that's mainly where the three stars come from. However, the jambalaya was waaay too salty. Cajun is supposed to be spicy, not salty."
Deborah K.,"Richardson, TX",242,127,31,4.0,9/5/2011,"How lucky am I to be able to enjoy a nice dinner out on the patio with the boyfriend and family when the Tejas heat finally cools down! Perfecto weather!  I'm sure we all know BJ's is known for their pizza and brewery which is exactly what we decided to get along with a few other pasta dishes and what not.  Now if you're wondering about a particular dish I'm sure other reviews will provide. All I'm here to do is talk about the red velvet pazookie. When the hell did they start making this and where the hell was I during this glorious birth of such a lovely creation?!?!  Anyway, aside from the always good chocolate chip pazookie the red velvet definitely made a statement. It's exactly how it sounds. Red velvet cake in the form of a cookie, cooked for 6 minutes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Cant get any better than that folks! *happy dance* from me!!! Hallelujah I've found another damn good dessert. Booyahhhhhh!!!"
Lena L.,"McKinney, TX",31,16,9,1.0,4/21/2013,This place sucks! Food comes out raw after waiting 30 min for a burger? Never Again!
Alex S.,"Frisco, TX",302,293,,4.0,8/25/2011,"If you've never been through the shopping center this location rests in, do yourself a favor and give yourself 15 minutes more time than you think you need to find the place.  You can see it with no trouble from 75 and you'll probably be able to get to it easily... you'll more than likely be stuck behind other drivers not sure of where they're going or what they're looking for since literally every business that has ever existed is within a two-mile radius of this shopping center and you can be sure you'll be stuck behind the guy doing a whopping 5 mph looking for the antique lamp store.  But once you get there, then you have to find parking since this BJ's does a phenomenal amount of business after 6:00 p.m. You'll come in through a revolving door and be in a small waiting room for the crowds that are usually generated - they have benches outside for overflow but if it's a typical day of Texas-style heat, you may be better off finding any standing room you can inside.  The front desk staff has always been attentive and quick to meet your requests if you ask ahead of time (read: if you want to sit in a booth, ask when you put your name in, not when they take you to a table and then you blame them for your own lack of planning).  Speaking of which, one thing you may want to take advantage of is their wait list phone-ahead offer - I believe if you call them before driving out there in the evening, they'll add your name to the wait list upon receiving your call so when you arrive, the wait time is minimal.  And even if it is long, another waiter/waitress can be seen walking through the waiting area with free samples of pizza for customers who have not yet been seated.  Bonus! The place is packed on a regular basis, usually with Allen families, visiting shoppers or folks getting together for whatever random occasion they feel like celebrating then and there.  I always make a beeline for the bar area because not only is it self-seating, but it's elevated above the rest of the place, giving you a great view of two other dining rooms that look like controlled chaos.  There's a number of booths up there and some high-top tables, along with a fairly expansive bar that seats more than you'd initially think when you first see it. A number of ex-Cheesecake Factory executives have made the transition to BJ's in recent years and the food selection shows.  The menu is vast to the point where if you can't find something you want to eat across its many pages, either you were reading it upside down or you decided to declare war on food.  And because it's a brewery, you can be sure they take special pride in their handcrafted beers, which you will hear about when you sit down through the pre-programmed delivery of the host/hostess.  Stick with the Jeremiah Red if you want one of their own, otherwise browse the pages and enjoy some lesser-seen selections (Ugly Pug!). Back to the food, though: it's easy to get overwhelmed by the selections.  Come for lunch and enjoy their special lunch deals (that lunch chicken parmesan is an essential meal).  Split a large pizza with your group (just stay away from the bacon cheeseburger pizza - in the ""mini"" size, I'm pretty sure it's lethal; in a ""large"" size, I'm sure it's illegal to serve).  Chow down on a number of teriyaki dishes, munch on their sandwiches (French dip for the win) and then save room for their famous Pizookie desserts, which sounds like a crime against humanity a la Dr. Frankenstein (what with the blending of ""pizza"" and ""cookie"" into one very holy union) but in reality is a gift from heaven above.  Just be sure and avoid the overly chocolate one and go off the beaten path with a peanut butter cookie in your selection. There's televisions lined throughout the place but if you're expecting to really get engrained in a game, stick to the bar.  The other dining rooms get too crowded for their own good and you don't always have the best view of the TV you're looking for. Plan ahead, get their early, sit in the bar and repeat."
Dallas F.,"Dallas, TX",0,5,1,1.0,12/21/2015,"Truly enjoy certain items on this menu or had before. We called ahead of time and got sat promptly, which was great! We were able to semi-customize our order, which was good. The pita tacos weren't as great tasting as they once had been, this time around. It was my father bday so a few of us got steaks. Unfortunately, the girl that served our food took some plates without asking if we were done. Which had my toddlers muffin on it. This was disappointing and rude if you want to call it serving. Always ask first! Like last time we came we waited 25+ mins for our food. This was VERY crappy, considering we had movie tickets. Which we had to trade for another day and time, while waiting. Mind you this is still my father bday, so we asked about a bday dessert. He ordered one, then the server said they were out of that kind. So he ordered another kind and then we waited another 20 mins. Really??? What crap! As we were leaving, after paying over an $90 dollar bill with tip. I mentioned to the server we never got the damn bday dessert. She said hold while she gets it Togo. Then she came back and said unfortunately it went to another table. If we waited another 2 mins she could get it to go. That was it! 2 mins to get it after 20 mins of waiting and 90$ later? This place and service is a joke. My dad was so let down. I spoke to the manager and all he could say was he was sorry. Really? If you were truly sorry, you would comp our meal or offer something for our second terrible experience. I mean no dessert and no movie for my father b/c of the crappy service. The owner of this place should be ashamed of himself and his investment."
Lashuna J.,"McKinney, TX",14,27,5,2.0,2/21/2014,I ordered the vegetarian hand tossed pizza and I swear Chuck E Cheese pizza tastes better. I forced myself to eat it.. Would have done better jst ordering Dominoes
Eric H.,"Allen, TX",8,12,,4.0,5/29/2014,"The deep dish pizza I had was delicious. Service was great and the setting was enjoyable. Nice and up to date flat screen televisions and if there is a particular channel you would like to view, they were willing to change the channel without any hassle. Prices were reasonable depending on what you ordered. Very tasty desserts."
Lindsay P.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",427,65,8,5.0,1/31/2014,"My husband and I went there with our son. They brought my son's food out with the drinks, which I was very impressed with. He loved the food too. We had the Cajun pasta, avocado egg rolls and turkey burger. Everything was very delicious. The waitress was extremely prompt and such a great server. A little pricey but honestly worth every penny."
Lianne K.,"McKinney, TX",0,2,,3.0,3/15/2014,"The food was amazing but the service was awful! Not only did they not have our reservation ready, they also didn't even get the number of chairs right and our MORP group had to split into 3 tables."
A L.,"Highland Park, Dallas, TX",405,152,39,1.0,9/1/2013,"The food was overwhelmingly underwhelmingly..yuck i spent 53 dollars on this I was so ticked..We tried appetizers,we tried entrees chicken,burgers,pizza..Oh my gosh it is just awful..Guys rethink your cooks,rethink the menus do something I have tried this location now twice/I sure do dislike dishing bad reviews but this is very necessary..Eeeks!"
Elaine A.,"Allen, TX",8,96,,5.0,3/9/2013,"Possibly one of my favorite restaurants.  their deep dish pizza is sooo good, I hate to say that I fantasize about it sometimes.  otherwise, their appetizers are excellent, and their desserts and stupid good... [PIZOOKIE - I want to make love to you]."
Ken C.,"McKinney, TX",0,14,,3.0,3/10/2012,"Definitely a mixed bag at this particular location. Our most recent encounter: dining with 2 kids is always a practice in patience, so we take advantage of call-ahead seating when available.  We were told 20 minutes, so we took our time getting there and arrived at the 20 minute mark.  When we checked in, we were told it would be about more 15 minutes.  When 15 minutes elapsed, we were told it would be 5 to 10 more minutes.  (Granted, they were very busy.)  Here's my request though: if it's going to be 45 minutes, tell me that when I call so 1) we can plan accordingly, and 2) the kids don't get restless. We had pretty much decided to leave when the GM (Jennifer) talked us into staying, and I was actually glad we did.  The food was delicious and portion sizes were perfect if not on the bigger side.  Had we been given accurate information about seating time, I would rate this 4 stars."
Deb G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",59,531,63,3.0,8/31/2011,"Unless you are there for the delicious deep dish pizza, it will just be an average, at best, experience.   Fish & chips was pretty bad.  Greasy small portion of fish - more chips than anything for $12.   Chicken Marsala pasta.... just don't go there - fatty chicken, chewy pasta.  Oh well, at least they have the pizza option!"
Amy J.,"Allen, TX",3,17,2,2.0,9/1/2014,I've been several times....I met a friend for lunch on Labor Day. Had lunch special 1/2 flatbread 1/2 salad. Awful is how I would describe it. The flatbread was so cold & under baked I could barley pull apart the pre cut pieces. Salad looked dats old & over dressed. The beer was cold!!! :-)
Janine M.,"Dallas, TX",89,146,65,2.0,9/5/2011,"Wasn't very impressed with Bjs which makes me sad because all of the menu items seemed so appetizing. I had my 21st birthday dinner here and had and appetizer, dinner and dessert and the only part of the meal I actually enjoyed was dessert! The avocado eggrolls were very bland, the mozzarella wasn't anything special and the ahi tuna was blah. My server was very friendly but other than that, it didn't love up to my expectation of Bjs..."
Thomas O.,"McKinney, TX",0,6,,4.0,6/4/2012,"This is one of the best chain restaurants that I've eaten at.  The food is consistant accross all of the  BJ's I've eaten at.  The only bad thing I've ever had happen at BJ's is they changed their blue cheese dressing from very good to very sweet.  We said someting about that to the manager; the next time we came in they had changed it back.  These things happen when you changes suppliers. I would have to say that there are only a couple of knocks against BJ's;  1)  the wait can be long (but you have to expect that to a degree for any good restaurant). 2) it can get load at time. The food and service has been execellent everytime I've eaten here; whether in San Francisco or here in Allen, TX."
