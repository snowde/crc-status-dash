John K.,"McKinney, TX",0,9,,4.0,3/5/2015,"Good choice for their craft beer, good selection of foods. Service has been consistently above average though can be a little slow to get the first visit. Love their chicken crisper salad. Our group has visited several locations, one each month. BJs was one of the better venues for our visit."
Aimee Z.,"Wylie, TX",677,661,18,4.0,9/29/2010,"My boss had been ""deployed"" for nearly 5 months working at an off-site location.  Trying to get her back home on Sunday was a long long disastrous chain of a comedy of errors.  That chain didn't stop until Monday morning.  And when she finally got to work she proclaimed.  ""We are all going to lunch at BJ's because I want Root Beer"".  I'm thinking I might have wanted something a tad stronger but it was 10am. I called and made reservations and they had our table ready for us when we arrived.  Most everyone enjoyed what they ordered.  I have eaten at the BJ's on BeltLine in Addison more than a few times and on this day and at this location, I finally found my favorite thing here.  The Angel Hair Toscana with Shrimp ""Our delicate angel hair pasta tossed with olive oil, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, fire-roasted red peppers, fresh basil, feta cheese, pine nuts, Roma tomatoes topped with fresh Parmesan cheese and parsley."" Their home brewed Root Beer is absolutely yummy and it is made with Beet Sugars so it doesn't cause those horrible diabetic sugar spikes as with other sodas. I hadn't been in this area since they broke ground about 2 years ago and after lunch the car with all the women in it had to drive around and see what all was there and open."
Ali B.,"Allen, TX",24,50,1,4.0,12/3/2012,"Good food. My favorite is the dish pizza (barbecue chicken). But...I went with one other person and when I got the check..... needless to say my heart was pounding and sweat was dripping down my forehead. It's not crazy expensive, but bring a fat wallet."
Stephanie D.,"Folsom, CA",16,65,893,4.0,1/24/2011,"The fresca flatbread pizza was delicious, the sauce was sweet. The loaded baked potatoes with chicken & broccoli are huge; not sure what the little side of Alfredo sauce added, though. Chips & salsa just ok. Asked if they had a cheese sauce and they flat out sad no, without offering alternatives, like the artichoke dip.  The crayons for kids are genius, shaped like triangles so as not to roll off table. They let me have two extra packages to take home."
Rachael M.,"Dallas, TX",238,447,109,3.0,8/17/2010,"After a ridiculously long & hot bike rally, my friend & I stopped on our way home to refuel.  I'm sure we were quite the sight for everyone that worked there, but we were hungry & just didn't care.  Fortunately for us, it was late in the afternoon, so the place wasn't too busy & there weren't too many small children to frighten with our lovely bike clothes. We were seated quickly & immediately started chugging water.  Poor waitress probably didn't see that craziness coming.  She probably should have just left us a pitcher & saved herself all the trips.  We jumped on order food & started off with an order of the avocado egg rolls, which are great for sharing.  They certainly don't skimp on the avocado & the dipping sauce adds a nice kick to the dish.   For my meal, I went with another appetizer that I hadn't seen before - Thai Lettuce Wraps.  These came with plenty of veggies, a light dipping sauce, and yummy little shrimp.  The lettuce was fresh & large enough to actually hold everything inside.  I hate lettuce wraps that bust apart from the get-go & leave you scooping everything up with your fork.  Honestly, they could stand to give you a few more shrimp on each one, especially since they were the highlight of the dish.  They were smooth, tender, & spicy *yum*  My friend enjoyed his sandwich, too, but I didn't dare try to steal any away from him lest I lose a finger or two in the process. Our waitress was pretty good, too.  She was polite & refilled our drinks with decent speed, though they went dry a few times.  No biggie - we weren't in a rush & she was nice, so it all worked out.   Overall, this place is alright given that they have a big menu, great drink selections, and plenty of space to accomodate a big crowd.  Price wise, it's so-so, really.  An appetizer, two lunches & a soft drink ran us about $40+ after tip.  Don't get me wrong, it's perfectly decent food, though the prices suggest that they are a little proud of it if you ask me."
Mark C.,"Allen, TX",354,385,57,2.0,12/15/2009,"Hint for the families out there: BJ's is not a place to bring kids on the weekend. Especially ones that require any sort of timely service. Our 19 month old daughter does just fine in restaurants as long as the food comes out in a reasonable time frame. Kid's spaghetti and chicken fried steak are clearly out of the timeframe for BJ's. Then when the CFS did finally arrive, it didn't have gravy on it. So back to the drawing board, another 10 minutes to complete the meal. Other than being cold by the time the whole meal was out, everything tasted fine. I'll likely be back when it is just my wife and I, as this is very close to home."
John B.,"McKinney, TX",0,5,,1.0,12/19/2013,This was the worst meal I have paid for in years. The meal was almost uneatable and I can eat just about anything. The establishment was not busy they may explain the constant up selling including asking about desert while you are still trying to put down this miserable meal. I have probably complained twice in my life at a restaurant about a meal or service. I waited 30 min for a manager who never showed up to complain but that is probably because he had already been called to another table next to us and did not want to be bother again. Save your money but if you do eat here don't venture away from the burgers... Worst $79.00 dollars I have ever spent four hours later and I'm still pissed...
Amber P.,"Plano, TX",3,53,10,5.0,10/16/2012,Great food and great atomsphere! Was not crowded when we went so we got a super close parking spot. Definately will be returning here!
Juan B.,"McKinney, TX",0,2,,1.0,9/20/2015,"Very sad to say that BJ'S has lost a loyal customer.  After a terrible experience last week we decided to give them a chance to redeem themselves.  After all, it's been our family's favorite restaurant for years. Tonight we experienced the same problems as last week causing us to believe it has to be a change in management.  We were seated and then a few minutes later asked to move because the waitstaff had too many tables in that section.  We were okay with it, thinking we would get better service in an emptier section, not the case.  It took a long time for anyone to come take our drink orders when we also ordered an appetizer which then came out before our drinks!  We didn't even order anything from the bar so I am puzzled why it took so long.  Then the appetizer was missing the chips, they said they were making new ones which we got (mostly broken chips) after the rest of or appetizer had already been eaten.  We did talk to the manager on duty who was nice and seemed to want to correct the situation, unfortunately he didn't do enough to keep our business.  When the food came out it also missed the mark.  Soggy, bland blackened chicken pasta wasn't even edible.  Even the manager agreed it looked awful.  Unfortunately, there are just too many things that went wrong and it's just not worth spending our money at a place that is going down hill fast.  We hope the problems are resolved so maybe one day we can return to our once favorite place, but until then we will be elsewhere."
Re O.,"McKinney, TX",0,15,,2.0,9/30/2009,"This is a new location to the many BJs around the DFW area.  I've been the the BJs on 75 and the one on Beltline.  Both of them outclass this new edition by a far mile.   My wife and I visited Bjs just last Saturday night 9/26 @ 5:30pm.  We were told the wait would be 5 minutes and 20 minutes later we asked where we were on the list and we were 9th.  Another 25 minutes later and we were finally seated.  Well, at least we were seated but they rang us and then thought we were some other party but then still seated us anyway because then they couldn't find us in the system... Unfortunately we were seated directly under an A/C vent.  It was running full blast (even though it was not that hot out that day) and literally my wife was shaking from the cold.  I swapped places with her and couldn't believe how much air was blowing.  My hair was blowing all around and I have generally short hair.  This had an impact on our food as just a minute or two after it was delivered the food was cold from the A/C vent.  Why they don't have a diffuser is beyond me. My wife had a pizza and I had one of their burgers.  The pizza was bland and had very little sauce.  It can best be described as basically cheese bread.  (My wife has had the pizza many times on 75 and this is a case of night and day--the pizza on 75 is far, far superior.)  My burger was nothing special and I've had better. The service was average, nothing stood out with our waiter and nothing was deficient either.  The bar seemed to be full, but it's hard to say if that was from people waiting for seats or just bar flies hanging out. Overall, I'm disappointed in this new establishment.  I seriously hope they can whip themselves into shape as I really like BJs, but if they don't change I'd rather drive another 25 minutes south on 75 to have good food than stay here in Allen."
Ivan H.,"Carrollton, Dallas, TX",34,19,14,4.0,9/29/2010,Very good octoberfest beer...and the chicken fried steak was very texas-like.  Good times.
Phyllis G.,"Fairview, TX",3,28,4,3.0,3/25/2010,"First of all, be sure to come before 7pm to avoid a wait. Service generally good, portions large, somewhat upscale bar food with standout pizza. Lg beer selection.  Oh wait, my son says the pizza a bit greasy and spices overloaded!  We agree the salads reAlly good!"
Amanda G.,"Little Elm, TX",107,172,59,5.0,9/14/2012,"They donate to the Cystic Fibrosis foundation whenever you order a pizookie!!!  The pizza's are great. They are known for their beer but I haven't ever tried it. My brother in law seemed to really enjoy them as he tried several! LOL Seriously, Chili's prices and much better food!"
M L.,"Allen, TX",1,14,3,4.0,5/5/2013,They have a wide variety on their menu. I have tried several dishes and so far all good. Husband is a fan of their jambalaya and loves it. Their in house soda are very good. I have been to several BJ's and I have to say this one has the best customer service thus far.
Doug B.,"Allen, TX",0,7,,5.0,10/15/2012,Had Octoberfest beer and it was awesome .  Pulled pork sandwich was very good and deep dish pizza was awesome as usual.
Ryan N.,"Washington, DC",78,134,2,1.0,10/26/2011,"Where to start.  I called ahead for seating, then had to wait 10 minutes because they didn't have enough servers for the patio. Finally got seated, waiter took my order, food didn't come!?  Yes, it didn't come. 20 minutes and manager came out to apologize. I asked for my check as I was in a hurry, then signed check and food still not there. Finally food came. I had two slices of my deep dish, and then took my daughter to the rest room. Came back, and the table was clear. Frustrated beyond belief. Anyone, everything took forever, but they sure could clear my table in a hurry. Thank god there are a to of other restaurants in the area."
Bruce J.,"Allen, TX",3,61,3,4.0,2/16/2011,"Let me start off by saying, you need to get the California Chicken Sandwich, it was amazing!  OK, I've visited this location several times, I've never really been impressed with the food (until I tried the CCS), and I'm actually shocked i haven't written a review yet. Until this last visit, i would have rated BJs at a 3 star, mainly because I do love their brews and the soup here was good. But this last experience was great, the bartender served us, and suggested the California sandwich, and I had a few brews. The service here has always been above average, but I thought he did an outstanding job. We were mixed in with the over dressed church crowd, and really didn't expect to eat out, so we were not dressed to impress, and in my past when this is the case, the service has sucked, but this was not the case, so Kudos to the staff!"
Jason M.,"McKinney, TX",19,74,63,4.0,5/8/2010,"Today we went to lunch at BJ's Brewhouse and it was great! The hostess and waitress were really pushing the pizza's! The staff was very nice and always brought us everything when we needed it. My glass of root beer was never empty! Speaking of Root Beer, you have to try their homemade version.....it's delicious. I had the fish tacos and they were wonderful! The fish was fried and not too greasy and the seasoning was perfect. The menu is huge with a wide variety of home brewed beers, cocktails, and lots of food. If you can't find something you like here then there's nothing you like!"
Christie F.,"Columbia, SC",4,11,3,4.0,6/12/2012,"Excellent menu for pizza (deep dish - ingredients are cut to order it seemed) and other options.... Amaaaazing selections of brews.  For a chain, high marks for atmosphere and menu, bc it didn't feel like it."
Michael G.,"McKinney, TX",5,3,2,1.0,6/30/2013,"1pm on a Sunday afternoon. We were given a pager to let us know when our table would be ready. When our pager went off, I handed it to the hostess who wasn't too interested with us. In fact, she took our pager and didn't say ONE WORD  or even make eye contact with me while we stood there waiting for another person to seat us.. Long hard day-I just dismissed it as stress. The waitress was pleasant for the most part. She took our drink and appetizer order and simply told her we would order our food when our appetizer came out as we were waiting for one more person to arrive. Drinks came and she told us our appetizer would be ""right out"". Few minutes later, a server brought it out. As we were enjoying our appetizer our waitress did not come by to take our order. In fact, as she was taking another table's order, we HAD to flag her down to come back and take our order. 2 people in our party ordered a pizza. I ordered ""Fish & Chips"". As I gave her my order, right away she asked me if I wanted ""wedge fries, thin fries, or regular fries"". Told her I wanted ""wedge fries"" along with a side salad. She then asked me if I wanted my salad before or during my meal. I stated that I'd like my salad before. Few minutes passed as we were finishing up our appetizer. She came to refill our drinks at one point. She prepared our table for the arrival of the pizza, and dropped off some ketchup and malt vinegar. Then another time she came to take our appetizer plate away. As she took it away, I asked if my salad was on it's way. She told me it would be right out. How long does it take to make a salad? It took about 10 minutes and me asking before my salad came out... Again, I dismissed it as a stressful, busy day. Couple minutes later, my salad finally came out. At which time she said our food would be right out. 2 bites into my salad my entree arrived. Since I was the only one with an entree (the other's shared a pizza) and I was trying to enjoy my salad, the server asked who the platter was for. With my mouth full of salad, I raised my hand and said it was for me. Just as fast as he set our food out on the table, he was gone. HOWEVER, he brought me ""Shrimp & chips"". Who eats shrimp & chips with malt vinegar?? When I saw our waitress, I flagged her down and told her I was brought shrimp & chips instead of fish & chips. She then reached down and grabbed the plate and told me she would bring it back with no apology or anything. At this point, I'm thinking this establishment needs a serious ""customer service"" adjustment. She came right back and finally apologized and told me my food would be right out. She brought my food out and everything seemed fine and dandy. HOWEVER, I expected a simple explanation or another apology about the mishap. but it never came.  When this happened (unfortunately) before at the Alliance location we've had a manager come out and apologize for the error. We were even offered a free pizookie. The Allen location didn't seem to care. In fact, after signing the receipt she said thanks for coming, and mumbled her way away from the table. We didn't know exactly what she said because she wasn't focused on us but focused more on the next table.And Not ONCE did she acknowledge her mistake again, or tryto make up for it. Granted she did come out (eventually) with the correct plate, she made us think we we're in the way or were bothersome.  Lack of customer service and courtesy is the reason why we tipped only 10%. My rating would've been 5 stars because of the food, but the lack of ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"" deserves minus 4 stars as we we're NOT happy I'll come back to this location, but I seriously hope to get better customer service and never get that awful waitress again. On this visit, CUSTOMER SERVICE was severely lacking. I hope to never experience that again."
