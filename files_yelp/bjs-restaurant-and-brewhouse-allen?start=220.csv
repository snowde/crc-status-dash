Tim F.,"McKinney, TX",0,12,,3.0,10/5/2011,"Been here several times.  Sat at the bar area several times and one time out on the floor for dinner.  I like there appetizers and the pizza.  The beer selection is good as I all was get the ""Blonde"".  I would return and will return."
Chris T.,"Allen, TX",0,3,,1.0,1/23/2010,"I really like BJ brew house in Plano on 75 so I was excited we were getting one here in Allen. Well that excitement is over after the ridiculous visit to this new location. It started of not out of the norm for a Friday night we were told the wait would be 45 mins.  Well an hour later I asked how much longer and was told we were next on the list. 20 more mins and we were finally seated. We thought finally we are so hungry now we can order. Well another 20 mins we finally saw our waiter placed our drink order and I guess should have placed food order then too. It took 15 mins to get sodas and waters and he didn't stop to take the order then either. It was anoted 10 mins before he came back to take the order.  The food actually came pretty quick not surprising since half the place was empty now. I had wedge salad and a pizza.  The wedge salad was tiny to say the least but the pizza was ok.  It will be a long time before I come back to visit this location.  So all in all it took an hour and half to get a table, 40 mins to even place the food order an about 15 mind for it to arrive. If I could give them a negative rating I would."
