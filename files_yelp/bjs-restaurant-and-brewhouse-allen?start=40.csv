Leigh C.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,1,1.0,10/14/2017,"Let me first start by saying our waitress Isabel was amazing last night. She was attentive and on top of it. I ordered a BBQ pork sandwich and fries. The Pulled pork was burnt, chunky, and cold. The bun was burnt so badly that if you had of threw it at a wall it wouldn't have broke. It almost seemed like because we were there at 10pm that they weren't cooking fresh food anymore. The fries were cold and burnt. I let our waitress know that my pulled pork sandwich was cold. She was super amazing and took it back. When it was brought back out it was the same burnt pork but heated super hot. I took one bite, paid our tab, and left. I did not want to give our waitress a hard time  because she was amazing. Note to BJ's , please manager your kitchen during later hours to make sure they are cooking fresh food for customers. Dont open until midnight or 1 if you do not plan on selling the same quality of foods at that time."
Martin M.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,1.0,10/8/2017,"This is my personal experience this afternoon and you should take this review as such.  Running errands I stopped in for a bacon cheese burger and fries. Ordered and was asked if I was okay with the burger done Medium Well (defined by the food network as 145 degrees with 3 minutes rest or between 140 to 150 degrees). I took one bite and then looked at the burger and found it dark on the outside and red throughout. Not pink in the middle, but from the layer of black on the outsides to red and uncooked inside throughout; it was raw! After I pushed the entire meal away and asked for my check I was offered to speak to a manager?!? Why would I debate uncooked food with someone is beyond me. So I said no, give me my bill and left a 15% tip over full price for a burger that had 1 bite, that I describe as a perfect home for a parasite. This is my personal experience today. If you enjoy this place I say good for you and please don't let me stop you from enjoying but as a local who has visited this restaurant as part of his weekend ritual before running errands this place has gone down hill.  Oh, the triangle napkin placed on the bar prior to my plate being served was filled with crumbs, so clearly I received an unwashed napkin used by who knows how many previous customers. I should have left then.  I am not returning there and want nothing from them in way of apology or free anything. I am done giving this poorly run establishment, in my opinion, any more of my money."
Blake S.,"McKinney, TX",0,3,,5.0,4/11/2017,"This is by far the best restaurant in Allen Texas! From the pasta to the pizza to the burgers,they know how to cook American food. I went their before I went on vacation and didn't wait a full minute for a table. Sat down and looked in their menu and orders baked ziti ( if I remember) and orders a drink with it. The cutlery was a little dirty but sanitary for me! About 30 min later the food came out and I tucked in. Let me tell you that  was amazing, I have never had a bad thing there and that was not bad at all!!! After I was finished, I asked for a chocolate chip pazookie''! About twenty min later it came out and the ice cream was solid ice cream! I told my family I was going to the bathroom and let them pay! I came back grabbed the leftovers and left! Best place of food restaurant ever existed in Allen! :) :) :D"
Gj M.,"Allen, TX",0,24,9,5.0,3/18/2017,They have a good selection on their menu and the food is delicious. Their salmon with lemon cream sauce is better than most high priced restaurants I like the thin crust pizza the best.
Chelsea E.,"Frisco, TX",18,1,,3.0,3/17/2017,"Ordered the Prime Rib special. Was not informed that the piece I would recieve would be the last piece, the end piece, of the prime rib. Was not pink or marble-y at all. Very over done. Waiter DID offer to get me a different steak, but I wanted prime rib, so I stuck with it. Prime rib special came with a pazookie. They were out of the pazookie we wanted. That coupled with the well-done prime rib should have resulted in some sort of discount or compensation. However, the table next to us received comped appetizers and desserts because they wanted to speak to the manager to thank him for already donating pizzas to their fundraiser the next day and he never made it out to their table. So on top of their donated pizzas, they received free appetizers and desserts. Same waiter. Which is awesome for them, don't think it shouldn't have happened. Just think all things should be considered table to table.  White cheddar mashed potatoes were delicious as usual."
Foodie G.,"Carrollton, TX",29,69,21,5.0,5/1/2017,Today was the first time we tried their pizza (crazy right) and it was awesome! Monday's is half off a large pizza day! We had the BBQ chicken and omg yummy yummy yummy. Will definitely be going back for more the next time I have a hankering for some pizza! Side note: Their Parmesan crusted chicken is the  !
Randi T.,"Oceanside, CA",6,13,11,1.0,9/25/2016,"From the minute we walked in, the staff never once smiled or welcomed us.  It took over 8 mins. for waiter to come.  When we told him how happy we were that somebody finally came to attend to us he said he wasn't our assigned waiter but saw we looked like we were ready.  Ok so that was good/sarcastic depending how you look at it.  We ordered a salad and soup in a breadbowl making particular mention my friend and I were sharing the food i.e split our salad.  20mins later when food finally came, found our utensils dirty (my knife had some food gunk on it) and salad was not divided up. Not coming to this location again - horrible customer service from start to finish."
Apryl M.,"Plano, TX",7,35,21,1.0,8/25/2017,"BJ's doesn't deserve even one star, so i wish it was an option to give ""0"" stars. went there for dinner tonight at 5:30pm. the place was busy but had probably 40% of tables open. by the time we left, they were packed. we ordered the $3 guac and chips. it's $3 because it's flavorless. the tomatoes on top the mashed avocado tasted like nothing. my husband ordered a burger and fries. i ordered the fish and chips. the fries were cold, stale and disgusting. we had to wait about 5 min to flag down a server (not our own because she never came by) to get ketchup, the malt vinegar they offered before and didn't bring and to get fresh fries. the food was greasy, not fresh, cheap and flavorless. we will never be back. i really don't understand how they stay in business. i guess a lot of people have really REALLY poor taste. the manager did comp our entrees but we paid for the guac and chips.  he didn't seem sincere and was not apologetic at all."
Jeff B.,"Plano, TX",0,3,,5.0,11/18/2016,"Just wanted to say THANK YOU to AUSTIN !!!! Great server, great customer service experience !! We will be back. Especially on Mondays.  Ask for Austin !!!! BJs menu was VAST. Austin helped us navigate it , and educated us well.  Everything we had was amazing !!! Stuffed mushrooms omg.    Jeff and Tara Blackburn."
Christopher L.,"Princeton, TX",2300,644,44,3.0,6/12/2016,"Only worth stopping for lunch if you've got a coupon or something is on special, since the prices are pretty high for that type of meal.  The plus side is that coming into this shopping are at lunch on a weekday keeps the traffic to a minimum.  Never been here during dinner or for bar hours, so I can't speak to the beer and alcohol selections except that the prices looked pretty high for a chain selection (including the chain style craft stuff)."
Makayla P.,"Hurst, TX",255,15,7,5.0,5/9/2017,"Seriously the best customer service I've received in a long time! Gene was awesome! Our food came quickly and was delicious, definitely recommend the pepperoni flatbread appetizer, and the salted Carmel pazookie!"
Catherine B.,"McKinney, TX",105,5,,2.0,5/1/2017,"Sadly BJ's seems to have gone downhill. I used to really like this place, but the last couple of times were just not good. Gave it another try today and 4 of the 5 dishes we ordered were cold when they got to the table. Our server was nice, and the manager did come over and remove one of the meals from the check, but the quality of the food in general was lacking. I also realized after already paying the check that I was charged 2.25 for a ""rogue dead guy taster"" that I am assuming is a beer taster? that I didn't order or receive. Probably wont be back, there are just too many other places to eat that have better food."
Jean W.,"Celina, TX",14,48,9,1.0,8/19/2017,"Once again I must complain..this is unusual for this restaurant.  I ordered a lettuce wrapped hamburger, it came on a bun. The server right away took it back to be fixed.  I ended up with one piece of the bottom of a leaf of lettuce which didn't even cover the meat and one thin piece on the bottom. Definitely could not pick it up. Also, it was the jalapeno burger...i couldn't find the jalapeños at all..they were so thick with batter and when I looked I finally found a tiny sliver of pepper in the dough ball. Very disappointing"
John M.,"Anna, TX",0,9,,2.0,1/21/2017,Planned an evening out with the family drove 30 miles south to go to my wife's favorite restaurant. Being a Saturday we called ahead to ensure that we would sat in a quicker manner. Once we arrived even though we were on time for our reservation they informed us that they had multiple parties of 15 and 20 people and that it would another 45 minutes to an hour wait. Obviously these parties had reservations if that was the case why would they not have informed us of the delayed seating time prior to then so we could plan accordingly. Poor service in the form of lacking communication.
Amy C.,"Farmersville, TX",40,100,34,4.0,7/23/2016,"Bjs is another mainstay in our choices.  I am a HUGE fan of their black and blue burger but I get a salad instead of fries.  My son always gets the parmesan crusted chicken.  They are fairly consistent every once in awhile my burger won;t be as tasty as usual or my lettuce will be wilty but for the most part they are good.  I had the veggie flatbread once and it was to die for so I got it a second time and it was just so so.  I never got it again.  Overall, we will continue to go here for a bite.  They have a really good light menu too and the lemon chicken and thyme I think it is is really filling and good I usually can only eat half......like 600 cals total and I half it."
Don M.,"Clinton, CT",0,29,13,3.0,6/28/2016,"Fun atmosphere and great (!) beer selection. This is my second trip and food is very good.  A few peeves lower the overall grade... 1). Menu is huge!  Too huge, and font is too small to read in the ""dinner light"". There is a separate spirits menu that is repeated for the first 6.5 pages of the main menu before you get to the food menu. Too much.  2) ""We don't serve that anymore"". Well, if you don't, reprint your menu. Although when your menu is larger and more difficult to read than a Gutenberg bible, it's an intimidating task.  I think I like the atmosphere better than anything else and Daniel the bartender (for both visits) is outstanding.    Give the place a shot and bring your reading glasses."
Scott P.,"Frisco, TX",22,15,3,3.0,1/27/2017,"I love the app. Ability to join wait list early and pay at the table with phone are great. However  when the app says the place is closed when you try to book on the waitlist and it's not, there is a problem.  The wait was 45 mins and should have been 20. Not happy about that but still love the beer and food here. So a lower rating this time . Watch the tech."
David D.,"Allen, TX",28,118,7,3.0,12/16/2015,"3 stars about nails it. Our experience, Good service Thick menu looks promising, but don't be fooled, food selection is fairly limited, and very safe. Tastes? The Lettuce Chicken wraps not great, chicken chunks far too large (s/b minced), lettuce leaves were not pliable at all, not from the ""green"" part of the lettuce. We've had them 2x before and they were better. Sante Fe Eggrolls good Without going into details, I'll just say the the entrees defined ""corporate menu researched and preparation"" ordinary.  Danged fine margarita tho :) and a good beer selection.  Atmosphere was nice. Helpings huge. Not bad, not real good, just a tad above average. I dunno, I'd trade huge helpings of average food for regular sized helpings made with more premium ingredients."
Tom M.,"Plano, TX",25,4,3,3.0,8/14/2016,Dinner there Sat. night and waitress very pushy. Guess she wanted to turn her table over quickly. Drinking water warm and bread cold. Las Vegas Bonefish much better with greater dinner selections. Not sure if we will return as pretty pricey for what took place.
Karen W.,"McKinney, TX",0,2,,1.0,8/8/2017,This evening has been the worst service. We've waited to order water for 10 minutes. It took another 15 to get it. The waiter has 4 tables and can't seem to serve any of us. The only good thing is we have bonded in our annoyance of the situation. Another table asked for a different waitress. If they are short-staffed I wish he'd tell us so we could understand. Hopefully the food will make up for it.
