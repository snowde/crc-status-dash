Matt W.,"Allen, TX",0,5,,1.0,5/30/2016,"Staff is rude, service is horrible, managers try to repair nothing and you can plan to sit for two hours. Beer is good and so is food. Probably won't come back. There's plenty of other good food around."
Bob R.,"San Antonio, TX",0,34,29,4.0,7/17/2016,I am always happy to see a BJ's Brewhouse when I go to Yelp!  Good beer and good comfort food.  I tend to order the Jambalaya which is great! Fun atmosphere and plenty of TVs.  Can get a bit noisy but not tonight.
Mark L.,"McKinney, TX",5,10,1,1.0,7/17/2016,"This review is for their Rewards Card only.  Food and service I've always found great. They signed me up for their rewards card a few years back.  I have created an account with the rewards card online, and tied it to my cell phone number and email address.  I even scanned the card in StoCard on my iphone.  However, every time I go (every other month), they can't find my account.  I get home, sign back in and...vola...my account is there.  I have ZERO point so far from my countless trips. I then had a friend sign up last time and try his luck.  Same thing for him. I suggest you either abandon this program or make it work.  There is nothing more frustrating than to push something like this and then not support it.  Please fix this."
Shelly B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",44,10,,5.0,1/29/2017,Good happy hour location.  Skinny cosmo is good and bar area is relaxed.  pizza is delicious.  A little higher priced than most happy hours (i'm ridiculously cheap) but still worth visiting.   pizooki is great.
Alexa O.,"McKinney, TX",32,5,,4.0,1/28/2017,"Whenever I go to Bj's, I always have a good experience. I always want to try something new from their extensive menu and they never stop amazing me with their food. No matter what I get, a deep dish pizza, their pasta, or a salad, you will leave satisfied. But! You cannot leave without dessert. They have an amazing selection of Pizookie's and other desserts as well. Will definitely be going back time after time."
Autumn F.,"Allen, TX",137,1,,1.0,7/31/2017,"I've been to this location multiple times and every time i've gone the service has been extremely slow. I will no longer be going to this location after my last experience dining there. It took 2 hours to get our food, half of the orders were wrong and took another half an hour to correct. We had to ask for refills multiple times and had to hunt down another waiter to ask for refills at one point. The waiter was extremely rude and had the audacity to rush us to pay. We asked to speak to the manager and after everything by the end of the night we never even received a single apology, not even from the manager himself. Customer service should always be number one priority!"
Margi W.,"Frisco, TX",0,22,,5.0,6/23/2016,"BJ's is our #1 'go to' place.  We probably eat here 10-12 times a year.  The food is consistently awesome and the menu is crazy wide range, so my husband and I can be in completely different appetite moods and have both our needs are met so we aren't arguing over where to go!  My absolute favs are: the house brewed Heffeweisen beer, the Santa Fe Chicken salad, pan pizza, or love their individual flatbread pizza.  All five star.  My hubby gets the Cajun Pasta and loves it also.  I've had their burgers which are great, but typically too much food for me. Last visit tried the batter fried asparagus appetizer.  OMG that was to die for!  Totally non-greasy and asparagus was fresh and crunchy, long strips of yummi-ness ! The service is good and staff has always been very friendly, especially the front hostesses.  Couple of times our service has been slow, but overall they hit it out of the park.  An additional perk - they have a BJ's rewards club which gives back to their patrons who frequently visit.  Just provide your BJ# and you build points.  We save up and you then get $$ off your bill.  It's an awesome program."
Janell W.,"Allen, TX",95,61,4,3.0,12/17/2016,This place is always crowded. I honestly don't understand why. The food is so so. I come here for the Pizookies!
Susan H.,"Denison, TX",15,98,63,5.0,8/4/2016,"A group of four came here for an early dinner.  Glad we got here early because we were seated immediately.  Everyone was very pleased with their meal except one.  His was only warm when served but, he said it was delicious.  The beer prices are a little steep but icy cold beer in the middle of a hot Texas summer is very good!  Our waiter, was very attentive but not in a pushy way.   He gave honest suggestions on beer and menu items.   We even got to sample one of their own brews before ordering it.  (We did order it!).  Everything he recommended was spot on.  We will be back!"
Shawn P.,"Anna, TX",44,4,6,1.0,9/17/2016,We are done with this place! Service sucks be prepared to wait. Here on a Saturday wasn't busy at all. We thought we'd give it a second chance same issue.
Yalda S.,"Plano, TX",41,5,48,5.0,10/28/2016,"I love this place , The food is awesome and the people who works there they always willing to help you out to get the right order I had the amazing dinner with my family and that was my first time I really enjoyed I absolutely recommend it"
Mark R.,"Melbourne, FL",11,64,151,4.0,6/25/2015,"Pasta with scampi-Plenty of shrimp good flavor. The clam chowder is very tasty. SantaFe salad-this salad will fill you up, lots of blackened chicken, tortilla chips & lettuce."
Kaci H.,"Dallas, TX",2,10,33,1.0,10/26/2014,"I hadn't been to BJ's in a while and some friends and I went to the Allen location yesterday. The waitress Alexandera was nice and polite and did a good job. We ordered 3 cesar salads and 3 personal pizzas. When the salads came out, mine looked different. (The salad looked wilted and there were no croutons. They are the best part, right?!!!) I tried to eat it anyway but eventually I was just stirring it around. Then I found something interesting...A LARGE BEETLE!!! When we brought it to the managers attention he apologized. But then he stated that he was very proud of the restaurants cleanliness and that the salad was prepackaged. I'm not sure what he was getting at because either the bug was in the  prepackaged salad or it was in the restaurant. Either way, it shouldn't have made its way into my salad! Our pizzas were fine and the manager took all the salads off of our bill and paid for my meal. That was nice enough and what I would've expected a manager to do in that situation. But when my bill came I was still charged for my soda which was $2.95! (That is outrageous!!) They ended up taking that off the bill too but needless to say, we will not be returning."
Khushbu B.,"Plano, TX",0,4,,5.0,4/1/2017,"This is a family favourite due to their large variety! My family is vegetarian. We get their amazing, juicy burgers! (Try the crispy jalapeño and portobello burger). Their tomato soup is my mom's favorite! It's super rich and good. Their pizzokie is to die for! (Cookie and cream is my favorite). They also have a good variety of apps. We have tried and loved their queso, spinach artichoke dip, avacado rolls and their flatbreads. DONT EVER LEAVE BJ's WITHOUT GETTING A PIZZOKIE."
Der Juana T.,"Richardson, TX",48,6,,2.0,9/24/2016,The food was ok ! My Jalapeno Margarita was delish!! We (my out of town guest) ordered the wings which were good. My Mediterranean Pizza not so good. I wish I would have ordered the thin crust. Perhaps if my not so good waiter would have reminded me of the choices. I would have ordered the thin crust as illustrated in the menu picture. My waiter Issac was in an obvious rush to get to the next table!! He was kinda rude with his fake smile. So next time we will perhaps get a nicer waiter .
Bonnie L.,"Mexia, TX",31,16,1,4.0,9/10/2016,"Great food! Service was a little off tonight, but will definitely be back! Waitress was friendly,  just had too many tables."
Douglas B.,"Prosper, TX",3,23,4,1.0,9/7/2015,"I have gone to BJ's frequently and my parents love their craft beer and food when they visit from out of state. Today we went to BJ's and it was the worst experience in several aspects. Our calamari appetizer was dark brown with dark brown grease on the plate. One bite and you could tell the grease needed to be changed out. I informed the waitress and five min later another server brings me the same exact calamari re-dipped in the same grease.  It was even worse. My mother ordered pizza and it came with half the ingredients she asked for. When the check came they charged me for two calamari apps and when I asked the waitress stated ""oh yeah I meant to take that off. Sorry"". She was anything but sincere.  It's really too bad because while I don't frequent chain restaurants, this one was an exception. Poor service, horrid food, and a half-ass apology just cost this restaurant several customers."
Jeff D.,"Frisco, TX",17,32,27,1.0,11/19/2015,Had the chicken fried steak - not good.  It was dry and over cooked.  Service sucked.  Complained to manager but he said he was sorry but nothing else.  Most food items are $12+ so be prepared to spend $60 for family of 4. I will not return to another BJs based on this experience.
Nicole S.,"Allen, TX",0,32,5,3.0,3/5/2017,"So so... if you are up for having ""chain food"" I suppose it's a good choice. Today I ordered their pizza smallest size, supreme. Honestly, I've made Stouffers in the toaster oven with better appeal. The crust was ""doughy"" and it was served on a little white plate. Maybe in a cast iron skillet would have looked more authentic. My son ordered Broccoli cheese soup in a bowl. We both had a Caesar salad. The salad was good, lettuce was fresh and I was pleased they used romaine lettuce since last time my Caesar salad was made with iceberg. Service was a little slow for not being very busy. Server was nice though. In fact, the server have always been very nice and aim to please at this location. Filled the void but just nothing outstanding."
Barry B.,"Allen, TX",0,11,1,2.0,6/2/2016,"I haven't been going to BJ's because the food is good one time and bad the next.  I went this week for the first time in months.  I ordered fish tacos, the waiter assured me they were really good.  When they arrived it was like trying to bite thru cold canvas.  No a good experience"
