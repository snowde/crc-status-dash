Tina H.,"McKinney, TX",51,5,1,5.0,10/1/2016,"First time! And I don't know what I have been waiting for! Good drinks, good food, and excellent service! The server GiGi was very helpful and provided suggestions that turned out great! I will be back!"
Mileena D.,"Allen, TX",24,120,198,1.0,7/26/2014,"A few months back, I remember complaining to BJ's on their Facebook page about my experience. They deleted my comment.  Anywho, I came on a Friday night with a couple of friends. It took 20 minutes just for our waiter to finally approach our table. Then it took another 10 minutes to actually get our drinks to us. She didn't even bother taking our order... After waving her down, we  give her our orders. I don't think it takes close to an hour to get our food?  I must say, the food was great . However, our waitress barely came to check on us throughout the whole time we were there. She never even apologized or notified us of the long wait. We then asked her for dessert when we flagged her down again, and after 30 minutes of waiting again, she got our orders wrong. Whatever. She even seemed to have an attitude.  We spent more than 2 hours here, and we had terrible service, so we didn't bother giving her a tip since she was so bad. We walked outside the restaurant to chat a bit before we left, and before you know it the waitress chased us out to the parking lot to yell at us for not giving her a tip.. Really? How unprofessional . I understand that tips are a huge deal for waitresses as I used to waitress at 2 restaurants myself, but when you can't even serve us yourself ( I saw other servers come to us for help more than she did ) , you don't deserve a tip.. I always hesitate to come back because I never want to see her again"
April B.,"McKinney, TX",120,728,447,5.0,1/15/2016,Always good service and great food. Love the lunch specials. Pazookie is very addictive.  This is my daughters favorite place to eat.
Arika C.,"Allen, TX",0,19,15,5.0,8/7/2016,Stopped in after back to school shopping and had a great experience. Our server Tim was attentive and the food was good. The manager stopped by the table at the end of the meal and our kids loved the triple chocolate pazookie. Glad we choose to eat here.
Anj L.,"Irving, TX",321,392,472,3.0,6/17/2014,"We usually go to the Lewisville BJs, but my hubby wanted a beer before hitting the Allen Outlet, so I figured it would be the same. Definitely not. We (party of 4) ordered as soon as our drinks arrived. One tomato salad, Ahi Poke, and 2 flatbreads. And then we waited..  The tomato salad arrived... we watched her eat almost all of it. I had to ask for a refill, it was taking that long. I was really surprised. Now, if you have ever had Ahi Poke, it is served raw. No cooking needed. It took 25 minutes to receive it. That arrived with the 2 flatbread pizzas. Had to ask for plates. The saving grace was that the food was good.  I will stick to the Lewisville location."
Charlie S.,"Melbourne, FL",64,118,128,4.0,11/18/2015,"Can't go wrong here. Huge menu with something for everybody and everything I have tried has been very good.  The service is always top notch and people are very friendly. The prices are reasonable and portion sizes are above average. The pizzas, sante fe salad, and Parmesan chicken I would highly recommend, for appetizers the ahi poke, and bruschetta are excellent. Full bar with craft beers and several TVs all over the restaurant."
Mike W.,"Colorado Springs, CO",2,5,2,2.0,5/5/2016,This places kitchen has gone down hill.  Service was ok. Had a reservation for 8 still had to wait for table with 1/2 full restaurant. Server was great.  Ahi salad was terrible used to be great.  Beer the same but food sucked all around table.  Bummers :/
Polly S.,"Little Elm, TX",215,236,352,4.0,7/4/2015,This place is nice. Bartender I think his name was Mike was really sweet (evening though it was about closing time.) he also asked me for ID lol so bonus points! Lols get the Tickled Pink its good if you dont like Absolut Vodka then not for you
Danielle M.,"McKinney, TX",0,16,7,5.0,8/13/2016,My boyfriend and I have been really into Pokemon go & they put a stop inside of BJ's! It's made us go there more often at night to get appetizers and beer and just chill out and play for awhile. I get the watermelon feta salad and I'm absolutely obsessed! I also get the fried portobello mushrooms and those are equally as amazing. My boyfriend always gets himself a beer and a pizookie which makes him really happy. We have never had bad service thus far.
Myia B.,"Dallas, TX",503,698,850,3.0,5/20/2014,"Came here on Sunday and decided to dine on the patio. There was a decent crowd but it quickly dwindled around 8:30pm.  David was our server and did an okay job of being friendly. I was hoping they'd have some type of reverse happy hour (even though I promise I don't drink ;p) but they didn't.  Tried the calamari (around $10) and it was nothing spectacular. It needed salt. The wind (which we miscalculated to be much calmer than it was) quickly chilled us and our appetizer which didn't help the fairly bland flavor of the dish. It was served with a pretty ""mayo-y"" aioli and a marinara sauce.  Tried the Mediterranean pan pizza (around $16) after being steered in the pizza direction by David upon contemplating between a pie and a burger. I ordered it with extra pesto. The dough was good. The toppings were ehhh. The peperoncinis could be replaced by onions or something else with bite on this pie. The Kalamata olives and the peppers were competing for flavor punch. The dough would have been even better had it not been so dry - even though I asked for a little extra pesto, I barely got any. I ended up requesting some on the side (it was brought out ice cold but was tasty and did the trick at wetting the thick dough). Tried a slice of the chicken bacon ranch pie and also filed it as ""okay."" The menu offers up a decent selection of different food items (wings, pasta, steak, ribs, burgers, salads, sandwiches, seafood dishes, pizzas, etc). I've tried the grilled chicken pasta before but wasn't impressed. The next time I venture in I'll try something else - their double burger. I'm not in a hurry though."
Fernando M.,"Dallas, TX",12,16,10,1.0,6/5/2015,"A book full of food for a menu, half of which is beer - duh, it's a brewhouse... I was probably expecting a much better experience, but these franchises never fail when slammed with large crowds all at once (Allen High School's Class of 2015 just let out of Eagle Stadium). Our food was cold, unflavored, and well, what more can I say? Over-iced soft drinks meant flat soda pretty fast... Such a let down.  Will I give it another chance? Nooooo..."
Tiffany W.,"Lower Greenville, Dallas, TX",132,125,103,5.0,5/18/2015,"We came here on Saturday to celebrate my son getting his Black Belt, we had just left his test. Everyone from the hostess to the waiters to the manager was extremely helpful and service was stellar! Our food was great and we had a large party of 15. I appreciate them accomidating us with a large party and keeping service top notch!"
Amanda P.,"Killeen, TX",46,16,6,5.0,8/2/2015,"My husband loves the beer and I love the food. We tried BJs a while ago closer to where we live and it was horrible. We stopped here on the way home from a weekend with family. This place has changed my opinion of BJs. We had the potstickers, mahi mahi and shrimp and a black and blue house burger. Everything was so so so so good. My fav was the mahi mahi and shrimp."
Christy V.,"McKinney, TX",26,11,,5.0,7/2/2016,"Great selection of craft beers, terrific food and awesome service! We have been to BJ's many times but Daniel has been our favorite server by far. Ask for Daniel, he will make sure you are taken care of!"
Bill N.,"Allen, TX",314,52,7,4.0,12/22/2016,We have eaten here many times but first review. My wife and I ate there last night. We had great service. We were seated immediately and our server was great. He listened well ( I also placed an order to go). I had the BBQ Brisket Burger. It was excellent. Cooked just exactly as I had asked. My wife got a club sandwich and she said that it may be the best club sandwich she ever ate. I should know because she orders them almost everywhere we go. BJ's food is usually good quality and they have a very diverse menu. BTW we order the queso and it was excellent also.
Shelly N.,"McKinney, TX",15,15,5,5.0,6/20/2016,The root beer bbq ribs are amazing.  We hae been going there for years and always love everything we have.  The staff is very attentive and kind.  Pazooki desert is a must try.
Kristen G.,"McKinney, TX",125,9,,5.0,2/26/2016,"This is my favorite BJ's in the area. All are great but this one has such a friendly and helpful staff. The food always comes out hot and fresh, the menu selection is large, and the prices are fair. The service is always fantastic. The bartenders know what they are doing. Alexis was our server and she was knowledgeable and high-energy. Great place to go. Highly recommend trying this one."
Justin L.,"Metairie, LA",297,109,8,3.0,1/27/2015,"Man, I just wrote a three-star review 10 mins ago. This place is another stretch for a 3-star as well. We ordered the veggie egg rolls. Wow. Uh. So not impressed. I should warn you that any time I eat a Mexican-style-western-style egg rolls, it's pretty weak in general. Egg rolls are an Asian thing, not a white-man thing (usually). It's like buying a Pitt bull but getting a rat terrier in strength.Yeah, both are loveable dogs but that's about it in similarity. The  fried calamari appetizer was pretty decent. I mean, its a fried food. Just b/c you are in the south doesn't make you an expert, but the batter was decent and the calamari was pretty fresh. However, it is a franchise so how good can you really make it?  Then we ordered the Mediterranean pizza (deep dish, large). Decent pizza; crust similar to that of Pizza Hut's (PH) pan pizza. Although PH is cheap, it's so much more delish...b/c it's cheap. But if I'm paying $25 for a large, i rather take my money and go to Whole Foods. They have some legit pizza, and it's a Grocery store.  So if you care about ambiance and a bar, they make strong drinks and it does look nice. But if you come here for food (Tuesday night), it's at par at best."
Scott M.,"Aubrey, TX",16,59,19,5.0,6/17/2016,"So grateful for Kevin and his team at BJ's. My wife and I always have a great time when we come here for dinner with our son. It's like our go-to spot to eat out. This last week we had a very uncharacteristic experience that wasn't at all like the service that we have enjoyed on countless other occasions.  Leaving us feeling kind of sad. But Kevin runs a tight ship, and went above and beyond to make sure that the situation was corrected. We were once again convinced that BJ's is still the restaurant we know and love. Highly recommend!!! Even if you're not hungry, you MUST get a pizookie! There is always room for a giant cookie with ice cream. :)"
Kelly T.,"McKinney, TX",70,220,14,2.0,12/24/2015,"I can't remember the food being stellar but it was passable for a chain. In a recent return the burger I had was super creamy and greasy. I tried to scrape off some of the mayo/sauce to make it edible, but in the end left most of it. Won't be returning for some time.  Everything we had was just way over seasoned or greasy."
