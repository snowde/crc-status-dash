Bobby L.,"Irvine, CA",194,21,1,5.0,1/6/2018,"My friend and I went here this past week to watch some football and get some good food. The service was amazing. I wasn't able to get my server's name, but he is a tall Asian gentleman and he was super dope. I finished my drink and he brought me another one right away without me even asking. Thats A+ service! Great food, great people, and great atmosphere!  10/10 recommend!"
Manny P.,"Bradbury, CA",21,41,1,2.0,1/5/2018,"Hey guys, I just wanted to give a quick review the Bj's in Arcadia. I went the today because I had gotten a gift card but normally I would never go there because of the crowd and noise level. I went there today with my mom because of their mini pizza and salad. To our surprise they have expanded their lunch menu. Our waitress went and asked us what we wanted to drink, we asked for and iced tea and a hot tea plus two waters. After looking through the menu I decided to go with the Meat Lover's Piadina. For a $1 more I get an endless refill in ice tea (Which is typical at any sit down joint.) and end bottomless fries. Like Island's but I know these places will not ask you if you want a refill on fries. What I wanted to know is the server is honest enough to switch me over to the $1 make it meal option. Instead of charging me $2.50 for just the drink. With my Piadina my mom ordered the turkey burger. After we received our order both looked good. The turkey burger was ground turkey and very juicy. If it would have smoked ham or applewood smoked bacon on top it would have been perfect. The Meat Lover's Piadina was like a meat pizza wrapped in a crispy thin crust tortilla with crispy fries on the side. Both were very good, but I didn't get any extra fries. Now to the bill. I was charged the $2.50 for the ice tea so she didn't give me the $1 ""Make it a meal"" price. Uncool. I always like to check the integrity factor of a chain establishment and these guys failed. Yes I give a big mark down for that.  I was going to give a 1 star rating but since the food was good I gave it 2 stars."
Theodore M.,"Chicago, IL",23,16,6,3.0,12/18/2017,"The seating and sit-down meal areas brought a lot of families with children weekend nights while the sports bar area was good for groups of two to six people. As a sports bar it's about average. There is one giant screen that shows one or four games (the screen can split to quads) depending. There is happy hour during the ball games with solid drink prices and half-price mini-deep-dish pizzas (the mini's were more topped bread balls than actual deep dish but were certainly cheap). For apps the stuffed mushrooms were great and the calamari was good, and for a meal the prime rib was underwhelming (think veins, fat, meh). Went there with a friend two nights in a row and three of the four bartenders offered very good service (I'm bad with names but they were: man short-brown hair 40's slight frame, woman blonde bob multiple rings, and woman maroon hair with tattoos).  Overall, the place wasn't bad and it wasn't good. I went and got an average experience, went back expecting more and got an average experience.. better than average service with worse than average food .."
Nancy T.,"Rosemead, CA",178,198,491,5.0,9/13/2017,"Was kinda scared after reading all the recent reviews, but wanted to give the place a shot anyways. My friend and I got here around 715p.m and it was pretty much half empty.  When we first walked in, nobody greeted us or anything, and we ended up waiting about 5 minutes or so before someone asked if we've been helped. After hearing we haven't been helped, he just ignored us and later someone else came to help us. This scared me as I thought 'oh no, the reviews are correct'.  But we got seated and our server Steven came over to greet us. He got us our drinks and gave us a couple minutes to view the menus. I ended up ordering a sweet peach, and my friend got a hot water. I ended up ordering the shrimp and asparagus penne, and she got the Maui Maui. We also ordered the spinach artichoke dip with chips as an appetizer.  Overall, the food was mediocre and the price is I guess average for the type of restaurant it is. But customer service was on point. Steven was very interactive, made conversation, checked up on us constantly, and was just overall super sweet. Probably would come back just to try something different. The churro pizookie was on point though! When you download their app, you great a free small pizookie! (:"
Rola T.,"Burbank, CA",193,178,116,3.0,12/11/2017,"Great service. I wish I caught our servers name, he was so kind. He brought us a snack for our twins (even though they don't take solids yet) and offered to warm our bottles for us. Really sweet of him. We ordered the sirloin steak medium rare; which came out well done but we didn't have time to wait to take it back. Kinda disappointed. Also got the cherry chipotle salmon. It was tasty, however the asparagus was burnt. We ordered a side of Brussel sprouts and honestly that was the most disappointing. They were dry, crusty, burnt, and tasted really really old. Over all the food was alright. I could have made a better steak and salmon at home that's for sure. Our server was nice enough to give us 10.00 off our bill. Better than nothing!"
Tiffany N.,"Arcadia, CA",651,473,691,3.0,5/18/2017,"Happy birthday to my dear cousin, Heidi! We took her out to dinner tonight and she wanted BJ's! I've been to this location so many times but I will say tonight wasn't the best dine in experience I had. The table and booth weren't cleaned well and I didn't want to even look at the ground. I was afraid.  We ordered: -Boneless wings appetizer (extreme hot and parmesan cheese) -Spinach Artichoke Dip appetizer -Deep dish ziti  -Large great white pizza (10 slices) -Deal for full rack of ribs on Thursdays  -Pizookie Trio -a few drinks Total was $124 for 4 of us.  I definitely love their appetizers and I love coming to their Happy Hour!"
Ophelia N.,"San Gabriel, CA",239,261,156,3.0,12/11/2017,"The service has been consistently great here so it definitely makes a difference. The food is pretty good and their menus are enormous. If you're looking for an easy, relaxed, and nice meal with a friend or a date then this location is a good option. My only tip is to either come at off times or make reservations because the wait time can really range."
Teana B.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,7,5,1.0,12/19/2017,Ordered the New Vegetarian-Style Peruvian Quinoa Bowl. It was absolutely disgusting! Hard pass!
Michelle N.,"Alhambra, CA",109,288,698,5.0,3/1/2017,"Birthday lunch , thanks to the company I work for (:  As per usual, I get the delicious salmon and the Pazookie sampler . I mainly come here for the pazookie- the white chocolate  is my absolute favorite (:"
AJ E.,"Westlake, Los Angeles, CA",2,20,25,3.0,10/10/2017,"I love Pizookies!!!! If for no other reason than that I probably would not eat here.  Last night (around 7pm) my hubby and I decided to participate in the $3 pizookie special and it happened to be $5 margaritas and half off a large pizza night as well. The host that was there neglected to greet me. I stood there for about 3-4 minutes and she never looked up or turned around to even see if anyone was there. You'd like to think that her post being positioned right in the door way so that she can see guests was enough... nope!!! She was more focused on talking to the wait staff. It wasn't until her manager walked up and said hello to me that she finally acknowledged my presence. With no sense of urgency or concern for her lack of observation she just said ""Oh, hi... how many?"" If it wasn't for the $3 pizookie they would've lost 3 customers.   I gave a 3 because I loooove pizookies!!!! And they were cooked perfectly. The margaritas were strong  and the pizza was delicious. If I had to grade based on my waitress and the host it'd be 1 stars. The deduction is because of those things. My waitress was wired a little loosely and the host was negligent.  It could've been a 5 guys. Let's do better!!!"
Sonia C.,"Duarte, CA",1,10,,1.0,12/5/2017,"Black people beware! Having grown up in Duarte, I've been to this BJs countless times. I had my first legal beer here at age 21. My girlfriends and I celebrated my engagement here. I was just here a few months ago celebrating my sister's birthday. The food has always been consistent and I don't remember service being bad. So when my husband got a BJs gift card for his birthday we thought, ""Awesome. We'll definitely use this."" So a couple nights ago we ordered takeout via the app. It should have been very simple. Our orders weren't complicated: two burgers and fries to go. But when my husband tried to pick up our food the hostess asked him to wait for the manager. When the manager showed up he then accused my husband of trying to pay with a ""fraudulent gift card."" All of this before even looking at the gift card or trying to run the gift card. They saw a black man with a gift card and assumed it was fraud. When they finally ""tried it"" it worked as gift cards usually do.  Needless to say we will not be eating/ordering from this location again."
Lisa C.,"Monterey Park, CA",8,102,116,5.0,8/13/2017,"What a nice Sunday lunch with the family. Thanks to ricky, our server, the experience was awesome.    * kids menu - very extensive and yummie. The kids finished it all.  * appetizers - we usually get a bunch of appetizers and share among everyone. They have great small plate selections. My favorite is the portabella and asparagus salad along with the calamari. * drink - very good drink menu. The blood orange sangria is still my favorite."
Lilly M.,"Altadena, CA",34,5,,2.0,12/21/2017,I'm not so happy with the service from tonight. We sat for 25 minutes before we were even approached and got a order in just for drinks.
Cianna B.,"Kaneohe, HI",272,41,87,5.0,6/3/2017,"Haven't been to a BJ's in a while. For apps I ordered the avocado egg rolls to share. Each bite is jam packed with creamy avocado. For dinner I ordered the spicy pig pizza. Pizza is a thin crust pizza but a decent size especially if you are saving room for a Pizookie (For the record I ordered the peanut butter Pizookie)! The spicy pig is basically ham, cheese, pineapple and jalapeños. Don't judge me for eating pineapple on my pizza (I figure pineapples are healthy so having fruit on my pizza makes this healthy right?) In my opinion the pizza was not too spicy but I also have a higher tolerance for spicy foods. Everything was delicious and the service was great! The wait time was minimal for a Saturday night. We walked in at 6pm and were seated in less than 10 mins. I'd come back again to checkout some of the other items on the menu!"
Eddy R.,"Capistrano Beach, CA",7,63,81,1.0,10/2/2017,"I NEVER give BJ's bad reviews, but this was the first time I ever returned food in my life. Ever! I can't complain about our waiter, he was cool... But I ordered a Bacon Deluxe burger expecting BACON. There was literally a single 1""x1"" strip of bacon torn into a few small scraps and put on the edges to appear to be there. The size of a quarter of bacon. I sent back the first plate of food I ever have in my life (yeah, I've seen the movie ""Waiting"" but this was unacceptable). The waiter apologizes, brings me the plate back. I open the bun and there's a ton more avocado spread on top of a single strip of bacon ripped into small pieces. I'm never a complainer. Swear I haven't ever sent back even the worst plate, and treat waiters with the utmost respect. It's either management being stingy with resources (bad service, deserves a bad review) or a chef that ran out of resources (also deserves a bad review). Fix your sh**, BJ's. I LOVE your food. I will never return to this location, no matter how apologetic and chill the waiter was. The food sucked. And that's hard to say about a place I regular often"
Grace A.,"Arcadia, CA",61,3,,2.0,9/23/2017,"My husband and I Love BJ's and eat there whenever we can. However today was a long day so we ordered Take Out and one of the items in our order was a Full Loaded Baked Potato, looked and smelled good in the car but once we got home and was ready to eat turns out it was THE WORST POTATO EVER!!! It was hard as a rock and we had to microwave it longer than normal in order to eat it. Imagine if we didn't go home and ordered it for an outdoor event, it would not have been a good night. All we ask is when someone orders a Baked Potato for Take Out, PLEASE cook it all the way through so it's edible. Thank You.

Elite T.,"Los Angeles, CA",390,97,2807,1.0,5/21/2017,"This is my 3rd time to BJ's and I always get honey chicken salad and the dessert. Since we want to try something else, we ordered the jambalaya , rib eye steak, pasta, calamari and also the deep dish pizza.  When my jambalaya came and took a bite , oh my.. the rice was so hard. I tried a few bites and asked few people to try it to make sure it is not my imagination. We called the waiter and she took the plate away to get us a new one.  While taking my plate away, she told us that she forgot to put in the steak order. Oh man.. our cousin is super hungry at that point. So the waiter offered claim chowder on the house. When the steak came and it was a well done steak. He ordered medium rare. So the waiter took it back again. Now, the waiter/manager came with a new plate and asked him to cut it to make sure it is how he wanted. It was perfect medium rare but when he started to eat it .... it was super salty!  The waiter offered him dessert on the house for the mistake. Overall the food is BLEH and SALTY! So sad. Not sure if they are overwhelmed with orders or the chef is new or.... Even they dropped our calamari :( Anyway, the waiter is very friendly but the overall food experience is disappointing."
Kristen C.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",112,81,61,5.0,12/2/2017,NICOLE IS AWESOME. Raspberry lemon drops were superb. That's really all you need to know.
Reen C.,"Pasadena, CA",59,47,11,2.0,8/24/2017,"sooo, I've been at the Arcadia Bj's for an Hour, interacting with the waiter guy. That's his name for now 'cuzz he NEVER told me his name...So for that & just that ALONE==PISS-POUR-SERVICE.  You best believe. the TIP will be PISS-POUR. Do unto OTHERS.. E.M.A..waiter-Guy *U suckkkkkkk*"
Xariklia G.,"Alhambra, CA",42,19,6,2.0,12/4/2017,Annoyed with the take out tonight. The point of ordering ahead is so I did not have to come in. Here I am inside because apparently the kitchen ran out of the soup I wanted and the associate didn't think it was a good idea to come out and let me know. He came out so quick to take my payment and then disappeared on me. When I went in he just kept repeating the fact that the kitchen ran out! I would have been ok waiting if he would be let me know! That is the point behind this!
Meilyn A.,"Arcadia, CA",155,124,197,4.0,4/2/2017,Pizookie ALL THE WAYYY. I love BJ's. They've got a great selection of beers and foods. The pizza is great.  Dry-rubbed Wings: 5/5  FANTASTIC. Just as good as Buffalo Wild Wings or Wing stop. Well made! Comes with celery and ranch.  Pizookie: 5/5 Get the trio! You get to pick which ones you want. I love the cookies and cream and salted caramel. So delicious and shareable.  Chips and Dip: 5/5 Can't go wrong with this dish.  There's just so much to get at BJ's but the drinks are great. They've got a good variety! They get busy so if you're just a couple of people go straight for bar seating. Don't forget to check on happy hour to get some great deals.
Winnie L.,"San Gabriel, CA",551,283,867,4.0,9/10/2016,"DEEP DISH PIZZA... FEED ME. Okay, but seriously.. their deep dish pizzas are something you need to try. I've tried their BBQ chicken & Sweet Pig (Ham, Pineapple) deep dish pizzas. The Sweet Pig is a Hawaiian pizza so you'll like it if you're a pineapple fan (like me). The BBQ chicken pizza is a classic & it's not too heavy on the BBQ sauce which I liked. You can still taste the BBQ sauce though! Both are great choices I recommend. It's more on the heavy side but the thick bread like crust is what makes it GOOOOD. Save your carbs for the deep dish pizza. It'll be worth it!!  I also tried the chicken lettuce wraps. The chicken is more on the greasy and saucy side. It comes with two sauces. A sweet ginger asian one & a mustard that tastes like.. wasabi? My boyfriend liked it though! I can't stand wasabi so I stuck with the sweet ginger sauce. We also ordered the Santa Fe salad with chicken. It was very heavy on the dressing so eventually it made the crisp romaine leaves kinda soggy :( Comes with corn, cheese, wonton strips, chicken, red onions, avocado. It was good though and they added this red condiment on top which gave it a nice kick of flavor. Maybe it was paprika? Idk but it was bomb.  MONDAYS: half off an large deep dish pizza!!  Pizookies are good too but I don't think it's worth getting everytime. I'd create one at home myself. I come here for their deep dish pizzas because no other place makes it as well as BJs."
Karen K.,"Monrovia, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/30/2017,"Got the pull pork sandwich this afternoon.... it was super sweet with bbq sauce,  I think the pull pork was bad,  as I am having symptoms of food poisoning.  :(  update - definitely food poisoning, not pleasant.  Won't be eating there for a while if ever"
May A.,"Arcadia, CA",127,135,285,4.0,3/17/2017,"First-time lunch at this place and I have to say I am pleased with the food, service and the overall atmosphere.  We like the vibe and the modern feel, as soon as we walk in, the host greeted us quickly showed us to our table and left us with the menu and mentioned our server's name who will be attending to our order.  We ordered their mushroom appetizer, Honey glazed ribs, Deep dish pizza, and for dessert a baked beignet. What a treat!"
Carmen Z.,"Rosemead, CA",90,5,7,2.0,10/15/2017,"I love the restaurant. But at this location, I felt the waitress just didn't like serving me and I just felt uncomfortable. And then while paying, my friends and I did cash then card. My waitress specifically asked if we wanted to do cash then card and I said yes but they went ahead and charged it all in my card and took the cash as tip. I signed without realizing so I'm not going to put all the blame on them but I'm a bit pissed off. This location specifically gave me bad vibes and I felt I wasn't treated very great. I honestly don't think I'll ever be coming to this location ever again. It was a terrible experience for me."
Tactical Girl L.,"South Pasadena, CA",22,19,8,5.0,1/4/2017,"Picture this. You walk into a place full of beer and protein. And the front desk lady is GORGEOUS and smiles sweetly at you. She welcomes you like a coming home party after you've been away.  Heaven right?  Her name was Stephanie and she stepped in to take good care of me and other guests while her front desk counterparts stayed in the shadows. She was the friendly rock star of the group!  Thank you also to the fun, personable, helpful, outgoing, attentive, caring, diligent and hardworking Paul H. who hooked me up with a whole thing of beer for just $4.00.

Florencio B.,"West Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",10,5,,1.0,6/8/2017,"This BJ's location has been in steep decline for years. Today I placed an online order for curbside pickup. My order was placed at 10:15 PM and scheduled to be ready at 10:30 PM. I drove to the location, arriving a few minutes after 10:30 PM, parked in the curbside pickup stall, and called the restaurant informing them that I had arrived for my order. The first employee I spoke to complained that the restaurant was too loud and she could not hear me, after yelling my name into my phone for the third time, she got it (wrong, but close enough to confirm my order). She stated she would let someone know that I had arrived for my  order. So I waited...and waited...and waited. 20 minutes went by and no one had come out to my car with my oder. I called the restaurant a second time, and a different employee answered the call. I told her I had been waiting for 20 minutes for my order to be brought out to me, and no one had showed up. She then says, ""We don't provide curbside pickup after 9:30 PM, it's company policy."" I politely informed her that at no point during the order process was I told that curbside pickup was not available after a certain time, nor were there any notices in the pickup stalls, and the previous employee made no mention of it when she said someone would be out with my order. She then proceeds to tell me that I must come in to the restaurant to pick up my order. I must've not mentioned that I have a knee injury that makes it painful to walk, hence why I ordered curbside. She said the only way to get my food was to come inside the restaurant. I told her I would not be doing that, and I cancelled my order. I could hear her become indignant as I was hanging up and driving away. This is terrible customer service. Never mind if a disabled person orders curbside because they cannot make it inside, BJ's is refusing to accommodate a customer who now may potentially have a legitimate ADA complaint on their hands. Avoid this location and its' terrible customer service."
Kathleen R.,"Azusa, CA",17,10,,5.0,11/12/2017,This was my first time dining at BJ' S the food was very good..the waiter Ricky was not only very professional but felt like we ..my daughter Jen...and I were talking to a friend..when one dish was a little under cooked Ricky promptly exchanged it..been to many large chain restaurants but BJ will be our go to place from now on
mandy v.,"West Covina, CA",155,113,4,1.0,9/17/2017,"I needed my football fix.  The place was not crowded. I sat down at the bar and waited,  and waited,  and waited. 5 servers walked right by me.  No menu,  no water,  nada. I ended up chatting with a manager and declined her offer for immediate service. Bummer!"
Ally B.,"Manhattan, NY",7,181,375,3.0,5/25/2017,"Not the best meal of my life, but certainly not the worst.  I'd just call it average.  We were staying nearby and needed a quick dinner and this was within walking distance.  They do have TVs all over there restaurant so that you can watch your favorite sports teams and they will change the channel for you."

Stephanie G.,"Glendale, CA",652,204,355,5.0,3/1/2017,"By far; the best BJ's I have ever been too.! The service was really really good!

I'm definitely coming back tomorrow"
Jose R.,"South El Monte, CA",12,9,1,1.0,9/4/2017,"Horrible experience, I expected their negative vibes another time.  After having a guys night out we came to have a sit down dinner.  Sadly it wasn't peaceful.  For once I wanted a sit down meal with my family but the service was awful.   My personal space was invaded twice, both my server and manager stepped on my shoes.  Apologies are not accepted when it comes to my personal space even more when my shoes are being stepped on as if it wasn't a big deal.  Server was being a smarty pants and she did not care.  Was food and beverage this rude at BJ's?  I am a very upset and dissatisfied customer."
Becky H.,"Phoenix, AZ",51,1,,1.0,10/15/2017,"I understand this is a sports bar, but they have a full menu including breakfast. A basic knowledge of how to cook eggs for breakfast menus, should be a a given. Not here! First, I specifically asked if their ham was a ham steak type, he said not a steak but its pretty thick piece. NOPE!! He comes out with deli style, thin sliced & apologizing that they just changed the type of ham. I ask for bacon instead. Then I look at my eggs. I asked for over easy. They are over medium with semi hard yoke. He takes it back, he comes back with the eggs cooked even HARDER! JEEZ!!! Over easy, I explain, soft yoke, soft whites. Waiter even sez we shouldnt serve breakfast if they can't cook eggs. They go back to the kitchen. Gawd I hope they are right! Yay! They came out right, but by this time the other foods, toast, potatoes & bacon are cold. Ughh. Someone else comes over & apologizes for the eggs, but no mention of a discount or other  type of ""comp"". Really, only an apology? An explanation for this was that the cooks egg pan was cracked & he didn't realize it until we brought back the eggs. 2nd time, it was mwntioned???!!!??? This comment will go to FB, IS, BJ Corp, their website, etc. Oh, but wait ... The Bloody Mary's were good"
Nicole F.,"Garden Grove, CA",232,207,215,4.0,7/29/2016,"Came here last night with my boyfriend to grab some food (obviously) and because they had a free appetizer deal. Our waitress was Elizabeth, or Liz for short, and she was great! She had a great attitude the whole time and it was busy too. Drinks came out quick. We ordered some fried calamari as an appetizer (which in my opinion is the best calamari ive had... I know, weird). We ordered a Caesar salad, clam chowder, and chicken pita tacos. All of it came out in a timely manner and at the correct food temperatures. The check took a while to come out though, but other than that everything else was great. I usually don't like eating at corporate locations, but I really enjoyed this restaurant."
Pat K.,"Rowland Heights, CA",42,410,359,4.0,9/27/2016,Excellent service from our server: Thomas P. Thomas was wonderful - the epitome of a server! He even tried to get the TV to display close captioning so we can watch game. Specials for the evening: half off all pizzas!  Thomas let us know and asked his manager if he didn't know the answer. Happy hour prices even at the dining tables. Green flash beer was super yummy and went well with the pizzas. Also got the calamari and have to say: it's been a long time since someone actually made fried calamari the best.  A line cook on the fryer did a super good job! Overall a nice spot and the server made the difference! We did not forget to tip Thomas the full amount before the $30 discount!
ED L.,"Los Angeles, CA",926,714,2101,3.0,12/9/2015,"This BJ'S in Arcadia has been around for quite awhile. It's a decent place to go for Happy Hour while you save a few bucks here and there. The actual dinner dishes are just okay. A bit pricier for the same mediocre food. But ordering their pizzas and flat bread pizzas is the way to go here. They have a good variety of tap beers served here. You can go with their pale ales (stronger and more bitter) to the cider beers which is fruity. They basically will have something their to tickle your fancy. Just ask the waiters or waitresses and they'll be able to explain to you  the different kinds of alcoholic beverages to fulfill your cravings. I like their pizzas because it's always freshly made for your order. I particularly like their flat bead pizzas with whichever toppings you like because it's not as heavy compared to the thick crust that's heavy enough with cheese and bread to bloat you. The Buffalo wings are also delicious. You could order regular spicy wings or the non spicy sweet ones to the tangy ones. It's usually served with a dipping sauce along with celery sticks and mini carrots. Other items such as the salads, sandwiches, pastas, can be a hit or miss. Certain times it doesn't seem to be as fresh... but at least it's still okay. Their steaks are good. A couple times a bit dry even when cooked medium... which was probably medium well. But again no complaints since it was enjoyable as it was also flavorful.  The service here... again can be a hit or miss. Sometimes superb, and other times a bit lacking. What it basically boils down to, is how busy they get. On weekends,  this BJ can become packed with people. There could be a decent long wait with nowhere to sit. And can be horrendous if it's really cold and rainy outside. But oh well... I'll give up my seat to an elder and suffer. I like this location since it's convenient. And I finally figured out when to come and not come. But I'll keep it a hush. Ultimately, this place is average at most for the time being until something changes.  Happy eating!"
Steve S.,"San Gabriel, CA",311,177,409,4.0,9/5/2016,"Ok so this review has been long time in the making. I think I have a handle of this place since I use to go to BJ's and probably before this one  opened. We frequented BJ's quite often before the invention of Yelp and before they were open here.  First of all, consistency, consistency, consistency. For the most part the food is very very consistent with most BJ. Thankyou BJ university for training your chefs to be consistent with flavor taste and presentation. Now the wait staff/bar keeps need to keep an eye out for the consistency of the head on the beers from tap. We had visited with in a few weeks several times and ordered same beers and the heads were consistent till this latest time. Big foam head for our red buffalo :( fail. The head on the beer is tasty and flavorful but it's a bit much and we like the drink not air flavored beer. Please don't deliver beers that have huge heads or no heads, just about a half inch is good, not 1 1/2"" one that's a bit much. The wait staff is very friendly helpful and great, they even were able to separate the check out when we mixed in our seating. They also made great suggestions for food. We love this place. Here's to another good hang out place when the Rams start their normal season. Edit: Again the waitstaff tonight was great, totally took care of us, the food again was very solid, love the cherry salmon here, so tasty."

This BJs seems like it has been here forever!  The bar area in the middle reminds me of a Friday's. I actually prefer the look of the newer BJs.  Last night we had Francisco (Frank) take care of us. Let me tell you this: we were well taken care by this guy!  Minimal wait times for everything.  Good suggestions and tips. Also, this seems to be the only BJs where you can order extra sauce on your pizza and they ACTUALLY add it (#1 gripe is their pizza is too dry so I have to add sauce - not here though)!   They brought me a dirty plate, but Frank switched it out quickly when he saw it. I don't like eating someone's baked on food from a previous meal... But I will eat off their plate if they are sitting next to me! My friend ordered their country fried chicken.  He let me have a bite and it was tasty. It immediately made my tastebuds happy and they did little tap dances in my mouth.  I loved looking at the dish when it came out... All that Golden chicken on top of a bed of corn with gravy. Mmmmmm. My other friend ordered the Atlantic Salmon. He wasn't as generous and didn't want to share even a nibble. Must have been good because I'm sure he would have licked the plate if no one was looking.  For me, I had the pizza. BJs is known for it and I think it hits the spot after a long day working.  Did you want to see some pics?  Sure you do!"
