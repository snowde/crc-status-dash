Leah N.,"Honolulu, HI",18,18,6,2.0,6/26/2014,This is the worst BJ's Restaurant that I've ever been to.It wasn't busy and it was really late so there was almost no one in the restaurant but for some reason our waiter only came to our table maybe 3 times during the whole entire meal and he left to go get me a refill and didn't come back for another 15 minutes. I asked him for a side of dressing and he didn't return until we're already done with our meal. On top of all that they accidentally spilled something and it splashed on to us and we received almost no apology.  The food was still good though.
Chris C.,"Monrovia, CA",0,14,5,4.0,1/31/2016,"The service is ""okay"". There's a very ""franchise"" feel about the staff. Kind of ""it's just a job"" type attitude. Not bad, but not great either. The food is very good. It's consistent and tasty. My favorite is the Mediterranean pizza, man is it good. They have their own beer selection that they brew themselves, as well as guest draft beers and a pretty broad selection of bottled beers. The atmosphere and decor are interesting and tasteful. Lots of screens to watch the game. I've been coming here for what seems like decades. Always a good time."
Alethea C.,"Arcadia, CA",687,113,454,5.0,9/19/2014,"The food was hot and on point! Their dessert is the bomb! Hot baked cookie comes in a round mini dish pan that is soooo delicious and moist and they add on a couple scoops of ice cream on the slightly baked cookie. If you're craving for some ice cream and cookie, this is definitely what you should get.  Customer service has always been great here. Never felt shafted (: This is a great place to grab a nice dinner with family and friends. Great atmosphere. Nice ambiance."
Rene H.,"Inglewood, CA",131,14,4,1.0,10/4/2014,"Waiter was extremely helpful not his fault...ordered chicken wings and was served chicken ice cubes!! Â The bones where literally ice cold the waiter quickly replaced them that was a plus but......we mentioned the situation to the manager just an FYI.. she replied very rudely and sarcastically ... (thank you for letting me know we fix the problem) and just walked away completely unsympathetic. I didnt expect anything ""free"" just maybe an understanding and some sort of apologie.  Maybe the waiter should get a management promotion??"
Dale H.,"Columbia, SC",195,4,,5.0,6/24/2015,"I am from out of town tonight was my second time there and I hope I can come back or they build a Bjs where I live! The food is great and the service is spot on. Two young gals, Mariana and Ericka recommended the Jeramiah Red and it's now my favorite beer. I came again tonight and Zack took care of me. Five stars all around!"
Robert B.,"Arcadia, CA",1,4,1,1.0,4/19/2014,"Horrible service. Hostess took wrong number in my party, quoted 20 minutes and took 53. Hostess was playing on her cell phone. Food took forever and our waitress seems comfortable enough to sit in everyone's booth and not refill chips. Worst experience at a BJs ever."
Phil Q.,"Arcadia, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/8/2016,"Very bad service. After waiting over 15 minutes for someone to take our order or at least our drinks. It required speaking to a manager for someone to finally come to our table to take our order. Looking at all the other BJ's in Yelp I now understand the reason why they receive 3 stars. Service is their biggest problem. This is the BJ'S located in 400 E. Huntington Ave., Arcadia, CA 91006."
Cori T.,"Duarte, CA",54,22,3,4.0,6/10/2014,"I don't know who these other people have encountered. Every time we come here, we get seated right away & the waiter/waitress comes right after. It is a little bit of a wait for the food, but I expect that everywhere I go. Their potato skins are freakin' delicious and every other thing I've tried is just as good."
Ayumi S.,"Pasadena, CA",3944,984,1478,4.0,7/16/2012,"Bf and I decided to go try out the BJ's up in the hood of Arcadia since it's fairly new. Saw a good amount of people waiting outside and inside.. already didn't like the look of it..but on we went! Walked inside, and it was pretty tiny! I was expecting it to be big..but meh. We only had to wait about a good 10-15 minutes, not too bad.  We got seated on the outer area near the windows, AC on blast! Our waiter James was a pretty cool guy. The first thing he asked me was..are you wearing Daisy Marc Jacobs? I was like ... O.O YES.. First time a dude knew what perfume I was wearing. PROPS JAMES, PROPS! Kind of made things a tad bit awkward, but all gravy.  Bf got himself the Blonde Beer, and I tried out their strawberry mojito. Honestly, it was super duper sweet and extra fizzy. Didn't really like it.  Bf was craving fried calamari for the longest..and me not liking seafood, I woman-ed up and tried it out. Tasted like chicken! So I can say I like it..because it doesn't really have a distinct seafood-y taste.  I ordered the turkey cobb, my fav, and bf got the burger melt which might be my second fave. I actually give them more props for being so quick with the food and service! Our food was out within 10 minutes or so. BJ's up in Torrance has never been that quick. I was pretty surprised.  I always ask for no lettuce on my sammiches and hamburgers, and my sammich came with the shredded lettuce. I gave the -__- face, but James noticed it right away. He was gna take it away and have them make a new one, but I didn't want them to go through the trouble. Good waiter.  We inhaled our yummy food and we were ready to bizzounce.  Our bill totaled up to 48 bucks and some change. 2 drinks, 1 appetizer, and 2 entrees."
Loretta C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3524,954,21688,4.0,1/10/2011,"The ambiance is pretty neat, with televisions all over, like a sports bar. The food is good, the service is so-so. When we came in, the greeter simply told us to ""wait there"" and we waited for a long time while a waitress standing near the greeter punched in numbers on the computer for a long time, without saying anything to us. I was satisfied with how quickly the food came but they mixed up one of our pizza orders. It happens, right? It can get really busy here and it's sometimes difficult to flag down the waiters! Great White, Southwestern and Buffalo Chicken pizzas are good and filling. As for appetizers, calamari was soggy but I highly recommend mozzarella sticks."
Kaila N.,"Monrovia, CA",0,13,,4.0,1/5/2016,I went in on a Saturday night so I expected the wait to be long but they told us it would be about 25 minutes and ended up only being 20. The food was great I ordered a deluxe double cheeseburger or something like that and they gave a good size portion. I only finished half. But service was fast employees were nice. Always end a meal at BJ's with a Pazookie!!
Skat P.,"Anaheim, CA",32,51,4,3.0,10/8/2015,"Decent food, decent drinks. A little pricey but it does the job late night,."
Spring Z.,"West Covina, CA",1,12,17,5.0,3/7/2015,"First timer, didn't know what to expect. 5 stars only because our server Valerie was amazing. She was fast and paid attention to our needs. The food was alright they messed up my pizza but made up for it by giving us an extra. Weak ass cocktails (writing this review after 3 long islands!!!!) Excellent brew and I love their fried artichokes (heaven in each bite). Anyways if you go to this location, ask for Valerie. You won't regret it."
Jenny L.,"San Gabriel, CA",76,305,168,1.0,3/21/2015,"First thought, CAN I LEAVE ZERO STARS? The service was BEYOND atrocious and this is coming from an EX-regular customer. I have never experienced anything this ridiculous at ANY restaurant. I don't even know where to begin. We walk in at 10:30 AM...30 minutes after they open on a Saturday morning. There are 2 other tables with people at them, they didn't have any food, but oh they probably just ordered. The A/C is blasting and we get seated far away from any of the other tables. Despite freezing, we wait for the waiter and then my mom orders a coffee and we quickly place our orders (now it's around 10:40) for food. Like I said, WE WERE REGULARS so we know the menu pretty well and have never had problems. 10 minutes pass, the coffee finally comes with 3 tiny creamers. My mom asks for more cream, 5-10 minutes pass, then he hands us a small bowl of creamers. Ok cool, no where's our food? It's been 20 minutes since we ordered. The manager comes around and asks if we had ordered...what??! YES. My mom POLITELY tells her ""we've been waiting 20 minutes"" The manager RUDELY says ""What? What have you been waiting for?"" WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR OUR FOOD. YOU'RE WELCOME FOR CLARIFYING. She had the WORST attitude, which carried on throughout our experience. Anyways, my mom finishes her first cup of coffee, so naturally she asks for a refill, 5-10 more minutes pass, no coffee. We ask the waiter what is going on with the coffee!? OH, THEY RAN OUT. How do you run out of something so easily made?? Also how do you run out so quickly when we are literally the 3rd table there. Are the other tables filled with big parties? NO.  OK, so NO COFFEE. Let's wait until they BREW MORE. When they finally brew more, they bring the coffee over and the waiter doesn't take ANY of the other empty creamers or the previous empty coffee cup away....OK COOL. At this point, I'm already pissed from waiting for more than 20 minutes for food and even more irritated by the awful attitude we kept getting from the manager, but again, this had never really happened before, so I'll try to be patient and lenient. However, every time we asked about the status of our food, we were met with DISHONEST answers about it just taking ""a few minutes""...oh really? Because ""a few minutes"" ago, we were told our food was ""almost ready.""  Total wait time before we got COMPLETELY FED UP = 50 minutes. I go up to the hostess and tell her, hey I know it's not your fault, but we have been waiting more than 40 minutes at this point for our food and we have somewhere to be at NOON. She was the only helpful person all day. She grabbed the manager and I explain how PISSED OFF we were because we go to this particular BJ's a lot and the service today was ridiculous and I explained literally everything I had just written above and ALL I was met with was her dumb robotic answers, ""Oh. I know. I understand. I'm sorry."" THEN, she had the nerve to ask if we wanted our food to-go, IT WILL JUST TAKE A FEW MINUTES. Are you kidding me?? WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR MORE THAN ""A FEW MINUTES"" THIS WHOLE TIME...NO. And then she said there was a problem with our order, which would explain ""why other tables got their food before us""...EXCUSE ME? I could've gone to Ralph's, made the exact same thing, in less time than we had been waiting. Our order was NO where near complicated. The most complicated thing I had requested was to include EGG WHITES instead of normal eggs. We had ordered straight from the menu.  Because of all of our WASTED time, I'm now sitting and eating my delicious chipotle while writing this review because we were starving and we needed something way faster to make our next appointment. THIS BJ'S MANAGEMENT IS INCONSIDERATE AND UNPROFESSIONAL. I have NEVER walked out of a restaurant after waiting so long, but there's a first time for everything. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Not just worst BJ's experience, but WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE. AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID. GO TO A DIFFERENT BJ'S IF YOU HAVE TO. After years of eating here, I would say today is my last..but oh wait, I DIDN'T GET ANY FOOD."
Carlos C.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",46,24,3,3.0,10/19/2015,I had take out for the first time today. I ordered through the app it was fast and easy. I ordered for pick up at 1030 and when I got there my food wasn't ready. I liked the fact that if they don't understand the order they give you a call to double check but call me before not at 1030 when the order is suppose to be ready. The cashier was nice and friendly.
Jason D.,"Arcadia, CA",1,12,7,2.0,10/16/2014,"The food is what you expect from a BJ's... OK. There's nothing wrong with ""OK"" food, but pair that with mediocre service and you end up with a heavy feeling inside made up primarily of regrets (why oh why didn't I just go to Olive Garden next door?). We sat at our table for over 10 minutes with no service at all. A lady and her son sat down at the next table and within 2 minutes the server was asking her about drinks. To which I said ""Excuse me, we've been waiting for 10 minutes"", the server replies ""I'll be right with you"". I guess it doesn't matter who is seated first. The rest of the staff brought all the food and checked in on us frequently after that but, once you get off on the wrong foot, it's done. Nothing kills an appetite for OK food faster than aggravation."
Irene N.,"Rosemead, CA",133,242,30,2.0,11/10/2012,"I've been to several BJs establishments.This was the very first one I had ever gone to. It's been years since I've been back. And I have to say my experience here was just mediocre, probably won't come back to this one in particular. It was super bright in there.  We came here randomly because Souplantations line was out the door and starting to wrap around the building and the wait at Olive Garden was almost an hour. Â The beers are always good here and the food was tasty. We had the Shrimp Lettuce Wraps and a BJs favorite pizza. We mentioned and pointed several times to our server that we wanted a small pizza. But our server ended up putting in our order as a medium instead and we just paid for it and took the leftovers home. It really shouldn't be called a deep dish. It's just a regular pan pizza. We got my early birthday mini p'zookie which was yummy!"
Devin C.,"West Covina, CA",6,2,3,5.0,3/7/2015,Valerie was a great waitress. She was very attentive and took her time to cater to our needs. Because of Valerie I will for sure be coming back.
Katerina Y. Y.,"Arcadia, CA",13,125,385,3.0,11/29/2015,"The service is slow on a Monday night. Â It's interesting to me when the restaurant is really busy on the weekends and at lunch. Food is pretty Â good and the piezOokies are their signature dessert. Â Kids lone the cookies and ice cream. I like the bbq chicken salad but you always have food to take home. It's a 3.4 food place, but getting the lower score because of the service."
Wendy C.,"Arcadia, CA",481,118,32,2.0,9/28/2012,"Gross.  The food is just not good! I've been here several times for banquets, birthday celebrations, and just dinners in general. It's just not good. All the pizzas suck. Seriously, I have tried almost all of them. There was a waiter who recommended the mediterranean one before and it was the worst. The pizza was dry with almost no flavor.  However, BJ's earns1 star for pizookies :) Oh, and they usually have sports playing which is nice if I'm missing the game to have dinner or something."
