Keilab A.,"Lahaina, HI",9,200,228,3.0,3/26/2016,"Bj's, known as the beer joint ;) This restaurant overall is OK: the service, food, restrooms, and drinks. I feel like all of these chain restaurants are tending to be not the best. While the food is filling and tasty, do not come here if you are in a rush. The food takes a while to come out, and getting seated sometimes does too. There are plenty of tables open, but the waiters still make you wait. Not the best, but not the worst."
Endy K.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,30,8,4.0,11/12/2016,"Went there in a big party of 15 something people. Food came out pretty quick, waiters are polite and helpful. Overall it was a great experience. 1 star deduction because they only gave us 1 waiter, although he was nice, 1 person couldn't serve 15 people in a timely manner - its just common sense."
Wan L.,"Los Angeles, CA",642,587,6635,1.0,12/26/2013,"Disappointing... Food: *Buffalo Chicken Pizza- Lukewarm!   *California Chicken Sandwich- Cold!  *Grilled Chicken Club- bread was too buttery and oily...  *Black & Bleu House Burger- asked for medium but it was well done and there were hardly any bleu cheese crumbles...  *Fries: lukewarm and soggy...  *Appetizer Combo (spinach & artichoke dip, mozzarella sticks, avocado egg rolls and santa fe spring rolls)- only dish that was decent.   Service was BAD.  Our server was nowhere to be found.  Plates and utensils were DIRTY & CRUSTY...Disgusting!   Will not return!"
Cydney M.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",82,670,3555,2.0,12/14/2013,"The Wolf Pack and I just finished hiking up at Chantry Flats and we were starving.   Normally I don't like to review chains, but this one needs to get their act in gear. Service: 2/5 Stars We practically had to pick out our own seating arrangements because they wanted to put our party of five at a table for four.  The hostesses really didn't have a clue.  Then we get a server who was never around when we needed something.  All of out dishes came out and most were luke warm or soggy.    Obviously our dishes had been sitting out quite some time before they got delivered.  We would have sent things back, but we didn't feel like waiting another half hour. Food:  1/5 Stars I don't think any of us were happy with our entrees, but the mixed appetizer was fine.  We enjoyed each others company so we tried to make the most of it.  I had a chicken club that was awful.   The toasted sourdough was really sour and my fries were soggy. Parking:  3/5 Stars In the middle of a big strip mall, so there's plenty of parking. Ambiance:  2/5 Stars It's a sports bar chain, so don't bring your date here.  Trust me on this one. Recommendation: I think I'm done with BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse for good."
Puzant C.,"Los Angeles, CA",214,559,460,5.0,5/22/2014,"2014 YELP 365 CHALLENGE - 127/365 I really enjoy coming to this location. I love that you can come in for a late dinner, and there are always people at the bar watching games. Customer service has always been great here. Never felt shafted or like I received crappy service. This is a great place to come grab a medium pizza and a couple appetizers with your friends. Great atmosphere. Friday, Sat, Sun there are waits but that is expected. They have plenty of seating inside and outside. And their pazookie's are AMAZING!"
Ana C.,"Pasadena, CA",0,11,,5.0,6/17/2017,"I just had a college celebration dinner for my son, I had 27 guests. We had 2 waitresses Elizabeth was one and I didn't catch the other girls name but they did an excellent job. Our cups stayed refilled and the food was warm and delicious.  Shea the manager of the restaurant kept checking on us to make sure that everything was okay. Customer service was way better than expected, they went that extra mile to make sure all my guests were happy. If you ever plan on having a group dinner, just know that you will get the best service at BJ'S in Arcadia."
Mark W.,"Duarte, CA",13,47,10,4.0,10/29/2016,"Started with the spinach artichoke appetizer, which was excellent, then onto dinner, ordered the New Orleans Jumbalia  (sp?), it was suppose to come with chicken / shrimp / sausage, mine did not have the shrimp (or if it did not much and I could not taste it), so I'm a little disappointed. My wife had the French Dip  and she said it was good. Overall a pleasant experience.  Our server was very good."
Jesus R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,32,27,1.0,12/15/2014,"My wife works at the Bjs in Glendale, so I know a thing or two about the BJs standards.  The bartender tonight, Joshua, needs to get an attitude adjustment. We've been waiting for about 35 mins for what they said was going to be a 15 minute wait and had to ask him for a glass of water because he did not have the decency to offer any.  In addition to Joshua, the manager came over just long enough to adjust the bill and take our payment. We didn't receive any ""happy holidays"" or even a simple ""how are you doing today?"" I'm sad to say that this location has very low standards and treats the customers like they're invisible.  Unfortunately, not all BJ's locations can be held at the same standards, but we can try to raise awareness to corporate about this undertrained group of workers here. Hopefully they get their act together soon!  Good luck Arcadia Bjs !"
Elisa H.,"Pasadena, CA",1,34,2,1.0,5/10/2017,Very very VERY slow service. Waited over an hour for food. Just asked for it to go after the hour passed. I've attempted to give this place several chances but always disappointed. Never again.
Matt B.,"Chicago, IL",4,65,,3.0,7/20/2016,"Food was good, not great, and the big menu is a nice plus. But the beer at this 'brewhouse' is not very good at all. If you want good beer, go elsewhere. The food makes it a good place to go, and the service was pretty solid. A good place for a group and overall worth the visit, but just nothing special."
Kat O.,"West Covina, CA",128,89,610,3.0,11/11/2014,Lunch time rush starts at 11:30. Come a few minutes earlier to beat the crowd! The BJ's Restaurant chain offered Veterans a free meal under $9.99 off of their lunch menu with proof of military service. My friend and I were lucky enough to snag a table before the lunch rush. Food was great. Service was OK. Parking is not hard to find. Place was clean.
Alexa P.,"New York, NY",373,100,142,3.0,9/13/2016,"A group of us came here for dinner while traveling for work and was very ""meh"" about the place. Our service was not great and our waitress, while very friendly,did not check on us enough. The food we ordered took a very long time, and once three of the four meals came out we were informed that the mini pizza that one person ordered was not available. When they finally brought out the pizza it seemed like a full sized pizza dough shoved into a mini pizza mold. Then we ordered a pizookie after our food came out and before we finished eating we received the pizookie. It was strange timing but the pizookie was SO GOOD. Gooey, chewy and hot, the pizookie is a must have."
Natasha Z.,"Valencia, CA",2,4,,2.0,11/23/2015,"Yikes, another incident of poor service at our neighborhood BJ's. We walked in Sunday night, restaurant didn't seem too busy. Two managers welcomed us from the host stand and I asked if the bar had open seating (we planned on watching the game while we ate). The manager motioned us to take a seat and his hostess would bring menus and silverware.  All set at our table, we thumbed through our menus and eventually made our decisions for dinner. So we waited for the server to come by as we had seen two different male servers in the bar area talking to tables. Nothing, for 5 minutes or so. One of the servers hustled past us to make conversation and watch the game with another server at a nearby terminal. Nine minutes, still nothing. We even tried to make eye contact with one of the two bartenders but they were helping their own guests and making conversation with servers picking up drinks.  After 12 minutes we decided to take our business elsewhere. I'm a server, my fiancé a kitchen manager with one of BJ's competitors. In a word, we were disappointed, but not surprised as we had a similar experience in the actual dining room. Please be mindful of your guests' time."
Han J.,"South Pasadena, CA",4,42,72,1.0,11/13/2015,"I came in here around 4:00pm and was sitting about 15 minutes while waiting my friend to come. After all of my parties came, the servers never came to other table for about 10 minutes. They did not even come bother to ask for the drink. We just came out from the restaurant. Horrible service. Never would go back.."
Angela S.,"Monterey Park, CA",54,22,3,3.0,10/6/2016,"Local restaurant in the same parking lot of my job. Never had any problems until today. I placed an online order, site didn't seem to be working properly. Called ahead to verify if my order was received. Spoke to someone name Kara, said it might take a while until it updates. Short moments later she asked the name of the order, and she verified it was received. Come around to my lunchtime, got to the restaurant to find out they never received any orders. Long story short, only ended up having a 30 min lunch instead of an hour. They offered to expedite my order while I waited."
Kimberlee D.,"San Gabriel, CA",1,10,5,5.0,3/19/2017,"We always come to this location and always have a great time!  The food was absolutely amazing and our waitress was cute and full of energy.  The Strawberry splash I believe is called is delicious, you need to try it!  My boyfriend and I both had burgers that were also delicious and finished off with a trio of pazookies of course! I believe our waitress was named Mayra and she did an amazing job and was super fast with our food. Will be back soon!"
Jennifer R.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",282,14,8,5.0,5/28/2016,"Spectacular experience! My entire family came here to celebrate for my brothers graduation. We were a pretty big group and got seated right away! Our server was Cassie. She was SUPERB!!! Very patient, polite and super sweet. Food was delicious! Of course we ordered the famous Pizookie and as always it did not disappoint. We haven't been to this location for years but it was totally worth dropping in. Thanks Cassie for top notch service!"
Mike B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",38,2,,1.0,10/22/2016,"Worse experience to go to this place .im from LA I went to have a dinner with my girl and her daughter, the lady she got my order I mentioned no susage and chicken breast and shrimp after 15 minutes the waitress said Im Gonna be on break and this gentle man takecare of u guys . When he brought the food on table I saw the chicken it's not breast actually it was the chicken leg bkz it was alot of fat around the chicken.  I try to explain to the waitr and he try to convince me it's chicken breast and I told him im  a bodybuilder I ate chicken breast twice day plz im not the kid to force me to eat what ever u have anyway I left and I never wanna go  back to that place ."
Doc I.,"Willow Creek, CA",30,37,1,4.0,4/13/2016,"If it wasn't for Junior I'd give this place another single star .... seriously  I went back, even after this issue with my service dog .... but I love the fried chicken dinner and walking distance of the hotel I sat in the bar area at a high top table and waited .... waited .... waited .... and a nicely inked waitress even came by and diverted her eyes (no kidding) .... so I waited some more ..... then came along Junior and saved the day .... just like Mighty Mouse of old.  I'll never bring my wife and my service dog in here again ..... but I love the fried chicken dinner, close enough to the hotel so I don't have to drive and I'll always ask for Junior"
Erick A.,"Monrovia, CA",6,3,,1.0,5/25/2016,I lost my phone last night at the restaurant last night. Got it back but one of your employees thought it would be nice to steal my 100$ phone case.  I'm sure they were an iPhone user and knew I can trace back to my phone. Will never go back. Get new employees.
