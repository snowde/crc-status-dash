Tiffany P.,"Duarte, CA",0,2,1,1.0,3/13/2017,Worse service ever! Will never be coming back again. We came to celebrate my mother in laws birthday & was probably  the worst pick to come here to eat. Waited forever to receive our food. Not once did me or my family get asked if we wanted a refill. When my food came out the bread was hard and burnt. When we told the manger he didn't even seem to care. Everyone had a attitude here. I never recommend anyone to come & eat here!!!!
Maynard H.,"Pasadena, CA",0,7,,2.0,9/9/2016,"As always I'm reviewing the WiFi, not the food or anything else.  I'm generously giving them two stars, but I'd prefer to give them 1.5. WiFi works but it's behind a stupid interstitial. There's all the usual interstitial crap that comes along with that --- no automatic connection when you revisit the site, SLOW wait while the interstitial does whatever the hell it is doing, you even lose connectivity occasionally when your phone goes to sleep then you wake it up five minutes later. They're one step above a restaurant without functioning WiFi, but only the very smallest step above that level. Utterly unacceptable in 2016."
Barbara T.,"South El Monte, CA",215,41,22,4.0,8/25/2015,"Came in for a quick bite on a Tuesday night. We usually order buffalo chicken wings and the shrimp scampi to share between the 2 of us- And it never disappoints!  Tonight we decided to change it up so we ordered a house salad (sad they were out of the creamy garlic dressing), ahi poke, & broccoli cheddar soup in the bread bowl.  Ahi poke lacked a bit in flavor, salad was okay but a little heavy on the croutons. But.... The bread bowl was TO DIE FOR! Seriously I don't know why I always ordered my soup in a cup. The bread bowl was nicely toasted- never had it like this before. Oh and the best part was the top of the bread bowl was smothered in what seemed like a buttery coating- drool. This is by far the best bread bowl I have ever had. :))  Of course we will be coming back!!! Until next time! Cheers :)"
Rachel R.,"Azusa, CA",40,33,30,1.0,8/3/2016,Came in at 10 pm Tuesday Just for a pazzoki for dessert. Are waitress was surper nice but took forever to take our order and came over twice forgetting our check.
Sara K.,"Los Angeles, CA",273,320,239,1.0,8/30/2015,Disgusting. I am so grossed out by my chopped barbecue salad. Half of the ingredients are missing and the lettuce is so old it smells. Waiter was nice but come on what the hell is this. Will not be returning to this chain again
Jeffrey V.,"Albion, RI",46,28,,5.0,8/25/2016,"I stayed a few blocks away in Monrovia and this was a nice place to grab a meal and a few beers.  The staff was very welcoming and they had enough tvs for the games.  The pulled pork burger was good.  If I ever go back to Arcadia, I'll definitely stop into this place again."
Grace C.,"Monrovia, CA",272,841,720,3.0,7/7/2013,"4 pm lunch. AHI POKE: small appetizer with 4 sections of 3 chips each and the poke in the middle (with some lettuce and avocado mixed in). The poke is heavy on the ponzu sauce. =/ 9.95 BARBECUE CHICKEN HAND TOSSED PIZZA (shareable): love the pizza, excellent BBQ sauce that didn't overpower the pizza, thin crust and chicken that is not dry. A bit steep with the $19.35 price tag. FISH AND CHIPS: it comes with 4 pieces of fish and thin crispy shoestring fries and some tartar sauce. Fries are good and the fish wasn't too deep fried. $12.95. JALLELUJAH FRIES: pretty much shoestring fries with some seasoning. yummy but gets pretty salty quickly. $2.95 CHOCOLATE CHIP PIZOOKIE (individual size): a more reasonable sized pizookie with vanilla bean ice cream. Eat it before the ice cream hardens the cookie but beware of the hot chocolate chips (it burned my lips). $3.25 The food was decent and yummy, though some seemed a bit overpriced. Great place to cool down and watch a game. Ample parking lot. Our server, Tawney, didn't check up on us too much (our water was down many times due to all the sodium we were consuming), but she took care of us. Great service. Make sure to sign up for the BJ's Premier Rewards program for some pretty sweet deals (our Jallelujah fries and fish and chips were free!)."
Cindy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",401,663,2002,4.0,5/13/2014,"I've been to a few BJ's locations and the food is on point majority of the time.  On my most recent visit, I ordered their BBQ chicken chopped salad and it was excellent. I love the fried onion strings on top. Now this salad isn't for someone who is looking for a healthy option because I looked at the calorie and the salad was about 1000+ calories. It's drenched in bbq ranch dressing but it was soo good. The portion is big. I was defeated before even finishing the salad.  Lunch prices seem reasonable here. I will definitely come back to try their lunch deals!"
Tania H.,"Brooklyn, NY",43,56,91,4.0,6/11/2016,"Food is delish, and the restaurant  is big and nice so there is no wait. However the server I had could not answer questions regarding the dishes on the menu. I couldn't decide on what to order and he was no help. Anyway after finally deciding on the salmon I was happy with my choice."
Cherish C.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",455,217,528,4.0,10/1/2015,"Great lunch deals! The unlimited soup & salad is perfect for those that have a difficult time making decisions =P The clam chowder and tortilla soup are both good (I couldn't eat more than two bowls). My friend enjoyed the broccoli cheddar soup too. If you get the salads, I recommend asking for dressing on the side or else your wedge could come DRENCHED in bleu cheese dressing. Very reasonable prices too. I consider it a win whenever you can leave a chain restaurant with a final bill under $10."
Krystal H.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,84,13,1.0,11/24/2015,"If you have plans to do anything after grabbing dinner DO NOT GO HERE.... really this service is just about their service, and not the quality of the food, however service did affect quality... for our party of 4 it took 2 hours to serve us out entrees, pizookies, and give us our bill.. the first member of our party arrives at this location at 5:45, my self at 6, and the last two at 6:15 and we didnt leave the restaurant til close to 9pm.  I dont understand how it took 2 hours to serve four people their entrees of soup, pasta, a pizza, and a flat bread and the pizookie trio... our FIRST waiter... (i say first because we had to go through 3 waiters and the manager to get served) took a little long to get our last part of the party's drink order. Once the drinks arrived she left without asking us if we were ready to order our meal, which we were... in the time it took for her to ask us our order and for the SECOND waiter to bring it to us two parties that had arrived AFTER us not only received their meal but were done with it (their meals consisted of appetizers and a main course).. when we asked our second waiter for our check and pizookies he left and never returned...  25 min later i noticed one of the other waiters was an old high school acquaintance and asked him if he could check on our order and bring the manager over to our table.. (him now being our THIRD waiter) he left and returned with our pizookies and told us they were just finished... we werent so sure since the pizookies didnt seem super hot and the cookies were already hard from cooling down and not gooey...  The manager followed shortly as we told him that in our wait we saw two parties order appetizers, their entrees, finish their dinner and leave.. he apologies and comp'd us on the pizookies as we reminded him we had also asked for the check a while ago (now roughly 40 min)  he said he would be right back with that and never showed  as we wait.. now 10 min longer we asked our second waiter who was busy serving a party next to us their meal for our check that we had asked for... he then pulls the check from his apron as it took everything for one of our party members to hold back her anger and my friend and i to burst out from laughter because it was just so ridiculous that he had the check in his apron pocket the whole time and didnt think to bring it to us even after he was catering to the party's needs..  we paid, we left, and warned other patrons that were waiting to be seated to leave and go somewhere else where they dont waste your time...  BJ's poor service caused one of the members of our party to miss her study group because it took 2+ hours to serve 4 people..."
Ken R.,"Pasadena, CA",43,17,,2.0,1/2/2017,"Not too great a BJ's......We requested rolls and the server brought us 2 tiny rolls and Im 6''3""...Our order took a little longer than expected so they were happy to bring 2 more rolls, wow !!   The food was ok but guess I just dont care for this location...,,"
Franklin F.,"Hampton, VA",55,62,56,5.0,5/15/2014,"We visited the BJ's of the evening of the 1st round of the NFL draft. It was early evening on the west coast and we were just finishing a job in the area. We walked in the front door and not one of the many TVs in the restaurant were playing the draft. I'm walking to our table with my radio to my ear waiting to hear where the marquee players were picked and who my Ravens were going to select. When we were finally seated, it was in a booth right under a tv. We immediately asked our server if he could switch our tv to the draft. After taking our drink order, he left to get his manager to switch the station. After a few minutes the station changed and the manager peeked her head around the corner and said, ""you all look like you want to see the NFL draft."" We laughed and talked to her a few minutes about football and our favorite teams. Before long our drinks arrived and we ordered our dinner.  I got a small, hand tossed pizza with mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni. The food was hot and the flavor was on point. But my main objective that evening besides seeing the draft was to order a pizookie. BJ's has an awesome dessert called the pizookie. It comes in a round mini deep dish pan that I assume is used for personal pan deep dish pizza. The pan has a hot baked cookie in it that I believe they slightly under bake because it is so moist, delicious and not totally firmed up like cookies that have been sitting for a while. On the top of the cookie they throw on a couple scoops of ice cream with a chocolate/caramel drizzle. If you don't do anything but order a pizookie, do it. Hands down one of the best items on the menu.  We loved the hospitality from the staff and the manager coming over to make sure that we were squared away with the draft. The food was excellent and the night was capped off with a pizookie. Great outing for our entire crew."
Anthony J.,"Pasadena, CA",13,7,2,4.0,6/23/2016,their food is always undoubtly good and pleasing. the price might be quite up there but its definitely worth it. The waitres are very friendly and would try to please you.
A K.,"Pasadena, CA",15,42,22,1.0,12/8/2016,"The problem I had was the food. Seems like this location went down hill. The usual items that were ordered did not taste the same. I ordered the Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatballs. The meatballs were falling apart and chunks of ""hard meat"" ( I'm guessing) in the middle was disgusting. The noodles were short like I got the left over bits. My boyfriend ordered The Parmesan Crusted Chicken Breast which lacked flavor and the chicken didn't taste good. The mashed potatoes were not hot (seemed like it was just sitting for a while because parts were hard). Like I said, I've ordered these items before and never had a problem until my last visit."
L. T.,"El Monte, CA",0,11,1,2.0,1/1/2017,"Mediocre at best. Cold appetizer plate, flat beer, sub-par service. Was surprised by this all, I've never been to a BJ's where everything was lacking. For a $20 appetizer plate, those mozzarella sticks better be stringy and buffalo bites better be hot. Not the case...disappointed."
Bryan M.,"Arcadia, CA",604,444,1356,5.0,8/20/2014,Anytime we're here our experience is nothing but great! Usually we get a table by the bar and avoid having to wait to be seated. My reason for returning here has to be that Jeremiah Red!! Yum! Can't ever go wrong with a Pazookie!!
Chris L.,"Pasadena, CA",1,22,1,5.0,8/1/2016,"I've been to this location several times and i have to say the food and the service are great! Anthony M really took care of us, constantly bringing us drinks and making sure everything was perfect. We also used the BJs app to take care of reward points and stuff. great job!"
Denise R.,"La Verne, CA",0,10,2,1.0,7/2/2016,We wanted to go and enjoy our dinner I don't know if it's because we got there at 12 midnight but we got the worse service and our food took a very long time and it wasn't even busy we also wanted desert but our server handed us our bill before we where even finish with our dinner she never came to tell us if everything was ok we had to keep asking for more water not a good experience
Steve T.,"Arcadia, CA",0,4,1,1.0,3/20/2015,By Far this is the worst experience I ever had at BJ . I order a large pizza before I finish eating it at the end of the crust I found a hair in my crust dough they send me another one they didn't say sorry or anything and what bad was when my other pizza came out it was uncook . I will never go back there again.
