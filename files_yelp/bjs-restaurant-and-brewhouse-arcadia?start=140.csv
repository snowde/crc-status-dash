Elizabeth M.,"Paramount, CA",54,4,1,1.0,4/4/2016,Went here over the weekend waiter was Conner. Just seemed like he didn't want to be there. No kind of customer service. Asked him for a few things that other bjs do with no problem like split my salad he said no I can bring u a plate and you can do it yourself. Bathrooms weren't stocked either. West Covina bjs much better and way worth the extra drive. 1 star today because of the bad service still gave 20% gratuity but he really did not deserve it.
Kaylyn S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,205,10,2.0,11/16/2016,"We chose to host a birthday gathering at this BJ's.  First, we called to make a reservation and was told that they don't take them.  But then, when we arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes before the time we told our guests, we were asked if we had a reservation.  What???  They told us it would be a 10 minute wait.  After 20 minutes, we asked when we would be seated and we were told that we wouldn't be seated until our entire group was there.  Our entire group had been there almost the entire time.  We were seated in a large booth in the back corner of the bar (we had three minors with us).  As the hosts, we asked for a different table, as this table was embarrassing.  There was a huge tv in the booth, a speaker right over the table, and the door to the kitchen right there.  This was NOT an appropriate table for a child's birthday party!  We were told that this was the only table available.  Looking around the restaurant, at 5:00 PM, there were several tables open, especially in the side room.  When we asked about those tables, we were told that they were reserved.  We explained that we HAD called for a reservation and was told that they didn't take reservations.  The hostess stated that this was the only table available and if we didn't like it, the wait would be another hour.  Clearly she was full of &*#$ - again, half the restaurant was empty.  To avoid a scene we joined our guests in the crappy corner booth.  The speaker was so loud that we were all having to yell at one another.  The server couldn't even hear us (which likely explains why almost all of our orders were WRONG).  Through the course of the evening we asked the server THREE times to turn the speaker down.  We also asked the busboy once and the food delivery person once.  When we asked for a manager, we were told one wasn't available.  On to the food.......When the soups and salads arrived we didn't have any silverware.  We asked the food runner - none.  We asked the server - none.  We asked a bus person - none.  We asked our server again - he dumped a handful of silverware in the middle of the table.  By now, according to our guest who had soup, the soup was barely warm.  Finally, a woman, don't know who she was, brought us proper settings wrapped in napkins.  When our dinners arrived, as previously mentioned, most of them were wrong.  We tried asking the server to have things corrected, but it just started going from bad to worse.  For example, we sent one plate back for a correction, only to have an entirely different meal returned.  Had to send it back and wait for the right order to be sent out.  Also, it is extremely irresponsible for a restaurant to put a scalding hot plate in front of a young child - especially without saying anything. Fortunately, the adult sitting next to the young child touched the plate before the young child did, so she was able to move the food to a cool plate.  Overall, it was it was an extremely horrible evening, and as hosts, embarrassing.  This wasn't the first time we had hosted a large group at BJ's, but it was definitely the last."
Comedy P.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,192,314,4.0,8/29/2015,Stopped in for a late night bite on Friday night. Still a good crowd at midnight. The girl at the Take Out desk was friendly and knowledgeable. Very patient about going over suggesting quick bites. My order was fast. I took the Bone-In Wings and Stuffed Potato Skins to my hotel room. I had a few wings that were inedible. My potato skins were okay. I would have saved a bit if I'd stayed for Happy Hour and ordered the same thing. And then I could have returned the the wings that were dried out and mangled.
Ruby Andrea A.,"El Monte, CA",8,7,6,5.0,5/19/2016,We came on a Wednesday night around 1030pm and we had a great experience..the food was great as usual but this time we were served by a very nice and efficient server her name was Kristen...Thank you Kristen for making our experience that much better!
C W.,"Pasadena, CA",0,132,18,1.0,4/23/2016,"SERVICE GOT WORSE. Came 3/27/16 for dinner, not that busy since it was Easter Sunday. Drinks were ordered quickly, then it took a long time for waiter to come back to take food order. Then our waiter disappeared. Food came but no utensils, took a long time for us to get another waiter's attention to get utensils. He said right away but went to do quite a few other things before finally getting forks for us, we just sat there watching him do other things while our food got cold. No service or drink/water refill while we ate. Took forever but the 2nd waiter brought our bill, then took forever to pay too. I guess our waiter changed during the course of the meal but neither bothered to tell us. Don't waste your money and time here."
Travis G.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,10,,5.0,4/12/2015,"Just had the buffalo chicken pizza at BJ's.   Quite yummy!    I work across the street at the Hampton Inn Hotel, I walked across the street for lunch/dinner.   The manager Hugo was nice to meet and took good care of me.    Close to our hotel and good pizza."
Cecilè C.,"Los Angeles, CA",290,236,688,2.0,12/8/2013,"I typically don't like giving lame reviews of restaurants because something made me walk into a place to try it out.  The worst feeling is getting uninviting customer service.  We decided to venture to BJ's after a hike, we were patient, the table was ready within 10 minutes so no complaints at all there.  Where the problem lies is when you sit down, the table has left over cheese from a previous patron.  No worries, wipe it off, plates were not clean, waitress was very robotic, almost like she was programmed to state 10 words or less, leave, and come back with an apology. In short, was NOT impressed with the pizza, it came luke warm, and I was told by the waitress ""it's our signature dish,"" well, if your signature dish comes cold, and under cooked (oven rather) then I'm afraid to try this place again.  It could be a one-off but overall I was not a fan, and seeing my friends food too that came cold, I definitely won't hold it to ALL the BJ's but this particular location might need a meeting with staff to get on the same page."
Ed M.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",43,127,21,3.0,1/27/2016,"Had a really good salmon salad for lunch.  Good place for basic pub food, good menu selections.   Large enough to bring all your friends.   Can't speak about the beer, but there's plenty.  Portion sizes are ample.   Not too loud so you can hear what the person you're eating wig has to say."
Christina V.,"Los Angeles, CA",272,296,179,4.0,1/26/2014,"Came here for my friend's party of twenty-something people. Despite the large group and all the continuous, scattered requests of ""More ranch!"", ""Buffalo sauce, please!"", ""Can I get utensils?"", and ""I need a refill!"" they did an excellent job! Of course, service was a little slow for everything but eventually they did bring what you asked for. I applaud all their team members!! Food was mediocre. I got the gluten-free pizza with fire roasted bell pepper and artichoke hearts. Veggies were good. The pizza crust was leather, but tasted pretty good least (no weird aftertaste like other gluten-free pizzas). You really get a jaw work out trying to chew it, and yes, you can use knife and fork if you'd rather get an arm workout instead. You'll build biceps by the time you finish cutting up the whole pizza. Strawberry lemonade was too sweet for me, but fine when the ice melted. Meh food (3 stars). Geat service (earns a fourth star)."
Jackie C.,"Alhambra, CA",245,204,164,4.0,12/30/2013,"WHO DOESN'T LOVE PAZOOKIE?!? Ice cream on a hot cookie yes please! I am sucker for sweets and pazookie is the perfect combination!  BJ's service is a hit or miss, so far i've had it pretty good so i can't complain.  I don't like their entres so much cause majority of them are over priced and the meat selections are usually dry. But I do like their appetizers, small bites and burgers. My favorite is the gourmet bacon mac & cheese and fried artichoke! YUMMERS!"
Deanna G.,"Temple City, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/31/2015,"Came here to have a nice Halloween dinner with my boyfriend. Very disappointed with the food. My boyfriend's deep dish pizza seemed like it was served with old ingredients because it was disgusting. Pizza wasn't even hot. Ordered the pasta asparagus dish, and again the dish wash not hot either.  The waiter Mark was very helpful and nice but I don't think I'll be coming back again."
Mighty M.,"Glendora, CA",10,64,2,1.0,12/5/2014,"So I had a chance to call this restaurant and spoke to the manager about my double transaction.  Their excuse?  They said the table next to us happened to have the same total amount so my card was also used to charge their transaction.  WTF?  First of all that's PURE BULL SHIT.  So the people next to us had orders with the same price as ours and left the same tip?  Did they order a kids meal too?  Really now???   And that lame excuse to use my card?  Hahaha!!!  I sure don't remember saying ""Merry Christmas everyone, your food's on me!"".  These lowlifes need to be investigated for fraud.  Business must be really bad and they are probably having a hard time meeting their quotas so they have to do these illegal stuff.   So again, if you happen to visit this place check your transactions.  These crooks are out to steal your money if you aren't looking."
Renato V.,"Rialto, CA",0,4,,5.0,11/28/2016,The servers are very attentive and boy did they take care of me. Recommend old fashions for those who love Remny Martin.
Mercedes H.,"Oakland, CA",2,37,10,1.0,4/13/2016,They never answered their phone so I couldn't order curbside pick up. I walk in the restaurant and wait for 10 minutes to place a to go order only to find out that the stuff on their published menu is unavailable/discontinued. Maybe this is why I stopped coming here. Smh
L L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/5/2015,"My credit card was accidentally left at this location.  I called to ensure it was there and it would be kept in a locked location.  They confirmed both. When I went to pick it up it took 30 MINUTES waiting for them to bring it to me. When I checked my credit activity the next day I learned someone had taken the card and spent nearly $1000 on it at various locations. I spoke with the ""General Manager"", Scott and he kept telling me there was no way to know it was anyone there who had done this - which I initially took as a reasonable assumption.  However, he continued to insist on this even after I pointed out to him: 1.  I had confirmed immediately they had my card,  2.  I confirmed with the credit card company the fraudulent transactions were made with the PHYSICAL CARD 3.  I informed him I only had ONE copy of the card ....he STILL insisted they had done nothing wrong and there must have been a mistake. Sketchy people, no ethics, no accountability."
Christina C.,"Glendora, CA",97,73,49,1.0,11/9/2015,"Horrible service! When we arrived the greeters were talking, and once they seen us they had the ""oh, great,"" look. We sat down and our waiter was in the worst mood ever. We felt like he didn't want to serve us. Horrible attitude. We even had a eye roll, because we were asking questions. We ordered two tortillas soups that came out cold. I asked our waiter if he could please warm them for us, and he did with an attitude. Not once did he come to check on us and ask if we needed anything. I will never come back to this Bj's. All their employees need to have a better attitude."
Robin B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,3,1,1.0,2/15/2015,"I've never had such bad service in my life. Like, we are beyond confused. I work in a restaurant and I can understand why a server might be slow, but it's a Sunday morning and this girl literally had only 1 other table in the beginning.  We got our drinks and appetizer in a timely manner, but she never came back to take our order. Sure she refilled my water, but she got 2 more tables and never came back. In fact the table after us got their food!  Did we offend her? We were having a conversation but we were there for food, so please feel free to interrupt us to ask us what we'd like to eat.  Had to finally ask for the check and leave because she still never came back! Really just to get out of there, won't be going back to this location."
Scott C.,"Elk Grove, CA",115,22,4,5.0,3/26/2016,My family and I eat here regularly. The manager greets you every other time. I love when they make sure everyone is happy and attended to. The server we have had for the last two times has been phenomenal. Never lets my drink go empty and is such a pleasant attitude. We over tip him every time. I appreciate the patience that they all have for dealing with the public. Thanks!
Jenny H.,"Riverside, CA",22,14,4,1.0,2/2/2015,By FAR one of the WORST experiences I've ever had going into a restaurant.  Some highly intoxicated person claiming to be the owners son approached my boyfriend got all up in his face with a rude attitude as we were walking in the door. They started exchanging words and you would expect the personnel to step in and handle the situation yet they were just standing there doing absolutely nothing. They ignored the fact of what was going on and ended up giving us a table.  The guy went out came back in started pointing fingers at my boyfriend kept looking at him as if he was going to do something to him. Went into the bar area drank some of his beer and kept looking back at him. A waiter just passed by us shouting don't listen to him he's drunk. Does this place not have regulations???  We ended up leaving. Didn't feel comfortable at all. & most definitely will never return again.
Arie J.,"Monrovia, CA",0,4,6,5.0,7/18/2015,"BJs is one of my favorite restaurant especially here at this location in Arcadia. The customer service is excellent and the food is amazing especially the Jambalaya. The Jambalaya is one of my favorites, I usually substitute the rice pilaf for angel hair noodles and add their creamy tomato sauce and it taste 10x better. If I'm not too full I will conclude my meal either an White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pizookie or a Chocolate Chip Pizookie ; their both delicious. Another great entree is the Parmesan crusted chicken. For starters they have a wide variety of selections. I usually get the stuffed mushrooms. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for great and satisfying food and also great customer service. They also have a great bar with a lot of TVs which is good for any big sport events going on."
