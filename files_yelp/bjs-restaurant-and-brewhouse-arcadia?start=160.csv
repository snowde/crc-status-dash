Katy Y.,"San Gabriel, CA",15,660,512,4.0,2/5/2015,We came here yesterday to have lunch while on break from our conference. Ordered from the lunch special ($7.99) and it was really worth it and delicious. Most of my friends ordered the unlimited soup and salad. I ordered half flat bread and salad. The flatbread pizza is soooo tasty esp the California one i ordered. Makes me want to return just to have it again!!  Service was really good. Overall a great experience!!
Siaosi L.,"Los Angeles, CA",480,176,785,5.0,9/26/2015,"Came here for happy hour. I've been here a few times and never had a problem. The bar and restaurant is always clean and service is good. The food is consistent and delicious. Place overall is very good and would continue to come back. Pizzookie, bruchetta, spinach artichoke dip and avacado egg rolls are the bomb. Octoberfest is a good beer and pizzas are delish."
E L.,"Alhambra, CA",314,220,139,5.0,6/2/2015,"Great beers for happy hour!  $4 pints for their in house beers!  Their stout and IPA are pretty good and you can't beat that price!  Went here with a friend for her birthday and received a free Pizookie!  There have many other craft beers on tap if you don't want to try their micro beer selections. I didn't have to wait for at able and just decided to set at the bar tables, faster service!  Staff was nice and friendly!  I would definitely go back here!"
Tori M.,"Baldwin Park, CA",5,17,3,5.0,11/18/2015,"Best thing to do is make a reservation, wait time wasn't that bad, even though we . Edgardo was our server and he was great. Positive attitude and willing to help.we had a big party and although one of the greeters was a little stand offish the other one was great! (The one with dark blonde hair was a little rude)"
G s.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,70,,5.0,1/2/2016,"Dined at this location on consecutive days to catch some of the New Year's college football games.  What defined my 2 experiences was the service provided by BJ's.   On the 1st night, I made a mobile reservation that for whatever reason, was not showing up when we arrived.  We were initially told a 25 minute wait.  But one of the hostesses was kind enough to fit us in, knowing we had sincerely tried to make a reservation.  They could have easily said sorry but nothing we can do.   On the 2nd day, we also had an issue with a promo that we missed, but Nick the GM made sure we were taken care of.  It's this level of going above and beyond that makes me want to continue to dine at BJ's.  They listen to their customers and care about their experiences.  Many large restaurant chains seem to treat customers like it's an airport, yet Nick and his staff make sure you feel like they value your business. Also, our servers on both occasions were friendly and responsive as always.  On the second day, we stayed passed the end of our meal as we were waiting to pick up our daughter after the Rose Parade.  They were kind enough to let us linger a little longer as there was a delay for the buses to return. Thank you BJ's Arcadia!!"
Phil Z.,"La Puente, CA",21,39,197,4.0,1/22/2015,"Cool spot for some bar/restaurant food ! The Calamari is good not great , have some delicious pizzas to order from and their beer selection is good. Happy hour starts at 10pm. The Atlantic salmon is really good, must try!"
Vicky C.,"Baldwin Park, CA",1,60,86,3.0,6/11/2015,"Had dinner- ordered the Cali Club flatbread pizza, spinach mushrooms, and chicken wings. The wings were not really good but they do give you about 10. The waiter did not bring us utensils and we had to ask for them which is why my review is low."
Whitney P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2785,365,400,4.0,9/25/2014,"Was meeting some old friends from my college days at University of Miami.  One guy was here for work from Miami, why else would I be running out to Arcadia from West Hollywood on a Wednesday night.  When he said, 'BJ's' I thought that he meant that low rate wholesale discount shopping place and I kept thinking ""Why are we going shopping for mass quantities of toilet paper together?""   Luckily, he meant this chain restaurant next to his Hampton Inn.  It was the night the Dodgers won the West Coast title so it was packed and loud as hell with cheering sports fans (which I hate) but it's not like I frequent this place, so it's all good. As far as a chain restaurant the food was WAY better than a Ruby Tuesdays, Fridays, or one of those other garbage chain restaurants.  I had the Parmesan crusted chicken and it was actually really good.  We also shared the avocado eggs rolls and those were disgusting.   I think the other guys liked them, but to me they the mush in the middle of 100% avocado was just not what I wanted after biting into a crispy egg roll skin.  It was like pre-digested baby food in a crispy wonton shell- sounds good right? GROSS!  I don't know why this item is popping up on menus these days- Avocado overload in California?  I don't like it, not one bit, that's all I know.   All in all it was a nice, chill, non-Hollywood night in the Pasadena area, away from all the hustle and bustle.  It was amazing at what ease I had parking in a mega lot right out front, as opposed to having to pay for valet or literally avoid places in Hollywood all together because of the poor parking situation.  What a treat! I felt like the old days of the suburbs growing up when my biggest night of the year was my birthday when my parents would treat me to my favorite restaurant of the 1980s- Chi Chi's."
Juan M.,"Montclair, CA",111,302,214,4.0,1/2/2015,"This BJ's did a complete turnaround from my first visit many many years ago. The wife was pregnant so anything with a smell made her nauseous. What I remember from that visit was that it was really dark, and that I can't remember what I ate. Fast forward to this past Monday, and I am impressed! So impressed that I think BJ's is my new favorite casual restaurant! My ""first"" memorable BJ's experience was back in November at the Downey location where I tried the Pork Chile Verde fries and instantly became a BJ's fan. That location is about 3-4 times the size of this Monrovia location, but Monrovia's customer service can't be beat. We came for my sister in law and her fiancé's birthday so we had a party of about 25 with about half in our party being kids 13 and under. What I liked the most about this BJ's experience is that the whole staff worked in a team and took care of all of our needs. One server in particular, I wish I could remember her name really stood out because every time you asked her for something she'd say ""my pleasure"". Well it was my pleasure because we really didn't have to ask for too much. I had the California Burger (half-pound patty served on sourdough bread, topped with avocado, roasted green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise and ranch dressing) which was awesome, my wife had the shrimp scampi pasta (Flavorful shrimp tossed with delicate angel hair pasta in a light blend of olive oil, butter, garlic, lemon juice and Roma tomatoes. Topped with Parmesan cheese, seasoned bread crumbs and parsley) and my daughter had the Cajun chicken pasta (A creamy tomato sauce with blackened chicken breast, fire-roasted red peppers and red onions tossed with fettuccini noodles and topped with fresh Parmesan cheese and green onions.) and they were ALL DELICIOUS. One thing I wanted to mention was that we finally got to try a pizookie, which one of my buddy's from work never stops talking about. We tried a salted caramel one (A little sweet and a little salty. Made with caramel cookie dough, pretzel bites and white and dark chocolate chips. Topped with vanilla bean ice cream, caramel sauce and a Ghirardelli SQUARES® dark chocolate.) and it was off the chain! But what's really awesome is that for every pizookie they sell, they donate money for cystic fibrosis research. What an outstanding way to contribute to the community! Don't forget the dessert guys! Overall, I think I will come back to this location because of the wonderful dining experience. Next time we come back, I think I'm going to try a steak. The bar has been set now BJ's so please don't disappoint!"
Yasmin C.,"Monrovia, CA",29,42,6,5.0,4/3/2016,Mariah was a great server! Food was delicious and the drinks were very tasty! It was our second time having her as our server and she was absolutely amazing! Ambiance was pleasant and we enjoyed our visit! Thank you!
Primitivo G.,"Baldwin Park, CA",2,4,1,1.0,3/14/2016,Had a very unpleasant visit tonight we had a party of 15 and they took ONE hour serve our party. I really recommend you to go to another BJ restaurant. Very disappointed with the service.
Natalie K.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",1164,913,2031,1.0,3/3/2013,"I am a little more than pissed off at this BJs right now. After a rough day of drinking a little too much the night before, sleeping only 4 hours to go on a hike that I couldn't even finish (my own fault for not resting the night before) and having a bad reaction to my new allergy eye drop, I ended up in bed all day without eating anything. I finally felt good enough to eat and leave the house at almost 9pm so I decided to call in an order for a BBQ chicken chopped salad and buffalo wings from BJs. What a mistake... They placed me on hold for 5 minutes. A girl, whom I later learned is the shift manager, then picked up and asked to take my order. I had 2 simple items that I've ordered regularly and the phone conversation took forever. She wasn't paying attention! I was telling her what I wanted and was interrupted when she said goodbye to an employee leaving saying ""bye, see you tomorrow!"" while I was talking! This happened a few times and she kept repeating my order and asking me questions that I already told her the answer to. The whole thing including hold time took almost 10 minutes. I have never spent that much time ordering 2 simple dishes to go in my life. I got there 15 minutes later and my order was ready. The girl asked me to go ahead and add tip and sign my credit card receipt. First of all, why are you asking me for a tip when it's a to go order? It's not even curbside. Plus my phone experience was so horrible that I wouldn't leave a tip anyway. I got home and my order is wrong! I have always been a fan of their BBQ chicken salad. I have been ordering it for years. It comes with BBQ ranch dressing with BBQ sauce drizzle on top. My salad had regular ranch tossed in and no BBQ sauce. How can it be a BBQ chicken salad without BBQ sauce???? Now I'm so peeved. I called and asked for the manager. She still didn't pay attention to me. After I told her my issue, she asked to place me on hold. She then came back and said ""would you like us to reimburse you since we didn't put enough BBQ sauce like you wanted?"" Is she f-ing serious? I just finished telling her that my salad had regular ranch instead of BBQ ranch and no BBQ sauce at all. So I guess she's right since no BBQ sauce is definitely not enough BBQ sauce? She wasn't even apologetic until I asked for her corporate office's phone number. She ended up calling me back a few minutes later saying that she has adjusted my credit card to give me credit for the salad. She then mentioned that she is very sorry and even though I said I would never visit their location again, she hopes I would consider giving them another try. Funny thing is I never said that. She didn't even pay attention to what I said. I can't believe this girl is a manager. I'm thoroughly disappointed."
diana l.,"El Monte, CA",4,195,2,1.0,2/15/2017,"Worst service ever received at a BJ's. The waiter came to us without greeting us or a smile. He took out order and disappeared without getting our drinks. We finished our salad before our drink came out. The soup came out later and it was room temp. We waited another 30 minutes and nothing. We kept trying to waive our waiter down and he did not look our way once. We stopped someone else's waiter and he said he will get us our waiter. When our waiter finally decided to come over he looked annoyed. We asked for our pizza and entree. He went to the back and brought our food. Everything came out room temperature. It was probably sitting there for awhile. We were so annoyed, we decided to pack up our food and take it home so we could heat it up. When our waiter brought us our check he didnt say anything. He didn't thank us when we paid and he just walked away. As we were walking out, I told the manager and she said we should have said something earlier. We are not the type to complain because I don't want them to retaliate. I knew people in the food industry who would spit in your food if you complained. No thanks! This is one of the worst BJ's around. They need some lessons in customer service."
Cathy C.,"Westwood, Los Angeles, CA",5,15,22,5.0,3/25/2014,"three words: Salted Caramel Pizookie!! WOW, honestly just wow! If you're like me and LOVE sweet and salty desserts and love pizookies, then you must try the new salted caramel Pizookie!! It is heavenly.  The cookie has white and dark chocolate chips, pretzel bites, caramel cookie dough bits, and a big Ghiradelli chocolate square. Then it is topped with 2 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream drizzled with caramel sauce.  Also, the lunch specials are ridiculously good and so reasonably priced!"
James C.,"San Jose, CA",39,180,2,3.0,2/10/2016,"We came on a crowded night. The wait was longer than we were told. Then, when we were seated, it took the server a long time to get to us, a long time to get our drinks, and a long time to bring our bill. Food and drinks were good though as with any BJs."
Jennifer W.,"Monrovia, CA",552,762,2384,2.0,2/24/2013,"I've dined at the Monrovia BJ's location twice this year, but both times the service and consistency were not up to par.  First Visit Our server must have been new because: 1) Lunch took two hours to get through 2) Our soup took so long to get to us that by the time we got them, it was lukewarm and our accompanying entrees came shortly after (not enough time to enjoy our soup before entrée). We even had an inconsistency with soup spoons, some were soup and some were serving spoons that were too large for the bowls. 3) Long time to refill drinks; instead of bringing us a brand new glass, he'd just grab our old glass to refill after forgetting the first time. 4) Mix up with our rewards program card. It was switched with another party's rewards card. Second Visit 1) Our server would check in on us, but never stayed long enough to hear our responses. We lacked napkins, accompaniments for our dishes as well as answers to questions about the food we ordered. 2) The cloth napkins were wet because the utensils inside was wet when they wrapped them... we waited a long while to get paper napkins... after consuming chicken wings.... 3) The Piranha Nachos sucked, all of the ingredients were on the bottom, except for the cheese (which was already lacking)  4) The pazookie was supposed to have two scoops of ice cream, which is actually one   vs. their stock photo posted on Yelp  5) Ice chunks throughout our scoop of ice cream  The Arcadia location really, I mean REALLY is not up to par with other locations I've dined at. I might have to stick with other locations like Temecula, Oxnard, Long Beach or even West LA.  I would probably choose another restaurant down on Huntington Ave. before considering dining at this location. Yelp 100 Challenge 2013 - 11 of 100"
Grace W.,"Alhambra, CA",1,32,23,2.0,4/7/2015,"This is the second visit to this restaurant and tonight was quite a disappointment. First, we came here to celebrate my boy's 15th birthday. As we were seated, I told the hostess and she assured me that she would mention to our server. But to be safe, I told the server myself and he said he would do something special for him. There were five of us, we ordered five entrees and an appetizer. We wanted to make sure the appetizer has enough for all five of us. We asked how many servings for the Thai Shrimp Lettuce wrap, our server told us 6, but there were only 4, so my husband and I shared one. Minus a star... Out of the five entrees, two were terrible. My husband ordered the Shrimp Scampi Pasta, it was so bland, it was like as if the chef forgot to season it with any salt or flavor. Mine was the Balsamic Glazed Chicken, the chicken was so dry! By far, it was the worse I have ever eaten. The flavor was good but how could you overcooked chicken breast?  I thought I could handle it (it is not like I haven't had dried chicken breast before), but in the end, I have to ask to return it and reorder another dish. So, minus two stars for the quality of food but add back one for the friendliness of the management to make the change without a fuss. The other entrees were pasta and a burger and they were ok but definitely not as good as we remembered from previous visit. Well, in the end, the server forgot to give my boy the special dessert for his birthday. But he did something else, when we asked if my kids could bring the remaining strawberry lemonade home (they had a refill and could not finish the rest, both had 3/4 glass left), he brought back not two to-go cups but two cups filled with strawberry lemonade.  So, I give him back 1/2 a star. Overall, friendly server and management deserved 2.5 stars but I have to round down here for the so-so food quality."
Jon A.,"Monrovia, CA",115,65,11,2.0,2/16/2015,What the hell BJ's....! No more hand tossed pizzas?? Way to ruin your overly stocked terrible menu.
Sal L.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,12,2,5.0,8/18/2016,The best service I've had in a longtime.   Showed up at 6:30 pm by myself.  They sat me in a corner and ever time I started to wonder if my food or drink it was there.  Hats off to Kristen and all the people involved .
Sandra P.,"Arcadia, CA",2,6,,1.0,5/21/2016,"Horrible experience here.  To think this would be the perfect place to celebrate our friends 21st birthday. The place was so cold and the service was beyond bad. We got started with drinks  which took pretty long to come out, and our food as well. 10 people in our party which I though was the reason for them taking so long.  It was okay until they got our order wrong. The birthday boy ordered a pizza & they brought the wrong to our table they apologize and told us to wait. 30 mins later after everyone at out party was done eating they bring out another pizza and it was wrong too. They finally get the right pizza to the table and we tell the waiter that was definitely not okay. We get the manager to our table and it just went downhill. Where trying to explain to him what was going on, he started off talking to us  like we were children and then he tries to make a joke about it. I stopped him and told him it was definitely not a joke, one mistake is okay but bringing 2 wrong pizzas to our table was not okay and he asked well did you get the right one this time?. Very Unprofessional.  We ask for boxes and our check because everyone at our party is pretty done with the service and even that took another 35 mins to come. It was just a horrible experience to say the least. Not returning again.  Slow service & bad management."
