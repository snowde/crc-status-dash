Les R.,"Duarte, CA",25,72,445,2.0,9/6/2015,Customer service has gone waaaaayyy down. So disappointed. I did get seated promptly however the order of the food came out wrong wrong wrong. First they brought my father the wrong soup. Ordered clam chowder and they brought him broccoli cheddar. Then they brought the wrong pizza to us. Then brought my soup but no crackers. I did ask for them and by the time I got the crackers I had to ask for my soup to be warmed up..it took THAT long to get some crackers that my soup went cold. Not to mention my mother's Margarita was watered down to the max. I waited and waited for my water to b refilled. Finally had enough and called for a manager. She subtracted two items off our check which is appreciated but to have such terrible service is so disappointing. Won't b coming back for a long time. Such a Shame cuz their dessert is delicious.. Just don't care for the terrible service.
Diego M.,"West Covina, CA",215,115,191,3.0,2/20/2013,"Fair pricing, and the amount of TV's and available soccer channels make this a hot spot for lunch. Barcelona games, etc.  The service is always choppy here- It can be close to dead on, and it can be 35 minutes before your food is out and you've got to chow down quick before headed back to work. Prices are fair, and the salmon lunch special is my favorite."
Angelie D.,"Arcadia, CA",819,619,355,4.0,12/17/2010,"Remodeled and looking FLY.  This BJ's recently remodeled their store, so the upholstery is fresh, the bar is looking modern, the ceiling looks intricate, the floor is shiny, and the enterance area looks sleeker. Overall, this was a good change for BJ's.  They have come out with a new dessert that is out of this world! Watch out PAZOOKIE.. you are yesterday's news... HELLO STRAWBERRY BEIGNET.. with your friends Vanilla Ice Cream and Sweet Strawberries. This trio is here to stay and everyone is ordering it! Well I know I am!  Beignet - donut like amazingness  Strawberries - sugared and sweet  Vanilla Ice Cream - light and creamy  Eat this with a glass of Berry Burst Cider and you are good to go!  Been here 3 times the last two weeks.. why not make it 3 more!"
Tiffany C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1998,829,6041,1.0,11/11/2012,"Ugh, I have to say that my dinner at BJ's was the worst dinner I have ever had in my entire life. I have never been unable to finish a meal simply because the food was unappetizing.  Since BJ's is pretty much the only restaurant open around the area after 10:30, the bf and I decided to stop by for a Friday night dinner. I was surprised at how many occupied tables there were. Apparently high schoolers like to come here after their Friday night football game, dressed in their cheerleading and football attire. They are half the reason why the atmosphere at BJ's is so loud. So we were seated and given a very large menu with an incredible amount of choices.  Ordered the avocado egg rolls, small barbecue chicken pizza and the california burger. The bf ordered a hot tea which was basically hot water, a packet of honey, a tea packet and some sugar (and that cost almost $3 when you can get much better tea at any Asian tea shop!)  The avocado egg rolls came out and while they looked good, they didn't have what the description stated they would have ""Crispy golden wontons wrap a tantalizing blend of avocados, cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, pine nuts, chipotle peppers and spices. Served with a sweet tamarind sauce."" There were no sun dried tomatoes or cilantro or pine nuts! All I could taste was the avocado and the heaviness of the egg rolls. I ate two and that was two too many. The egg rolls must not have been cooked all the way, but I got an incredible stomachache and was unable to eat anything else after that.  When the pizza came, I took a few bites but not only was the bread incredibly dough-y and tasteless, it was really disgusting! CPK's pizza beats BJ's by a hundred percent and even Little Caesar's $5 special is better than this garbage.  And when the bf's California burger came out ... it was on sandwich bread and looked really unappetizing. It was incredibly heavy, which ... I guess I can't say anything because what do you expect from an American restaurant? But it just tasted bad! I have never had that much inedible food left on a plate from a dinner/lunch ever! I felt really bad when the waitress asked if she could take anything away or if we were still working on it. I mean, it's not her fault the food sucked. I asked for a box for the pizza, but I honestly will probably not eat it. It's currently sitting in the fridge awaiting its fate in the dumpster. My stomach was so uneasy I couldn't eat the pizookie that my bf and his sister had ordered. I just sat there drinking ice water, waiting for them to finish so I could go home and use the bathroom.  One of the reviewers mentioned that there is happy hour from 10 to close and there is $2 off appetizers? I didn't get $2 off the Avocado Egg Roll! Looking back, I do wish I had said something about the taste of everything, but I was in such a hurry to get home I couldn't even think about that. The waitress was nice though, and when I had asked about the $2 off any small pizza Yelp deal, she said I had to sign up for their Rewards program. She ended up giving us a free pizookie instead of givign me $2 off the pizza, but oh well.  I just thought the entire meal was too heavy and just not great. I was pretty disgusted by the inedibility of the meal and the fact that I couldn't even get through half of it. And when I got home, my boyfriend's brother mentioned that he never comes to BJ's because this was where he got his first and worst dose of food poisoning - yikes! I am going to stay away ... A super expensive meal that was not at all worth it."
Neel P.,"Pasadena, CA",0,13,4,5.0,1/14/2016,My go to place in Pasadena! Fire Roasted Barbacoa Chicken!!! It doesn't get any better than that!
Toma C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1042,4186,1.0,1/31/2013,"They have a lunch special that is not too bad for the price.  I usually go only when friends pick this place.  The bazooka dessert is best but then everything else is just okay.  I get the sliders, pizza, and salad.  This was my earlier review.  I never finished. Today 1/30/13 The salads here are good but it is expensive.  We order out 4 salads one sandwich for only 68.00 really?? I like the Santa Fe salad with salmon.  But I don't know I will only go here on someone else dime.  To top it off they said 15 20 minutes we get there in 20 and they forgot to make the sandwich, we had to wait another 25 minutes, REALLY?  Won't be back for a while.  There are too many other places we could have gone to.  Oh the salad was just salad, they didn't even give us any bread."
Teri W.,"Henderson, NV",134,833,390,4.0,8/1/2013,"BJ's is one of my favorite stand-bys.  They always have a great beer selection - of both craft beers and in-house brews and their food is delicious. This location is no exception. I was in here around 1pm on Sunday afternoon, since I couldn't check in to my hotel.  This restaurant is within walking distance to quite a few hotels in the area, so I assume that they stay pretty busy. I sat at the bar and was immediately approached by the bartender.  Although I am familiar with the menu, I still took a peek.  It was cool to see that they offered Sunday Brunch, I don't think my location does that.  I ordered a BJ's Irish root beer and the fried artichokes and got excited when the Gold Cup Championship was starting.  Great timing! Everything was as it should be:  the drink was frosty and delicious, with just the right amount of kick and the artichokes helped soak up some of the beer I drank the night before! ;) The service was fast and friendly.  I rarely find myself disappointed in BJ's.  Keep up the good work, guys!"
Jemal Y.,"Torrance, CA",63,86,12,3.0,7/31/2014,"Back again. Service is still decent. Good is still lacking. This time the chicken lettuce wraps. They weren't bad. They just weren't great.  Very average. In fact, it seemed like more filler than chicken. It was also a Smallish happy hour portion, which is fine, but give me less lettuce so I don't notice that it was only enough for 2.5 wraps when you gave me enough lettuce for four.  Also had the chocolate ice cream. Nice and cold, but there was also ice in it. Not good.  I would order everything I had today again."
Adriana E.,"El Monte, CA",21,9,3,4.0,9/28/2014,"For those who are vegetarian like me, BJ's does have plenty of meat free meals to choose from. Avocado egg rolls are on point! The angel hair Classico is a must have as well.  Other vegetarian dishes include pizza, salads, and veggie burgers :)"
Dave D.,"Monrovia, CA",0,22,11,3.0,9/11/2015,"""Hi, my name is Valerie and I""'ll be your server. I just have a minute to get your drinks before I go on break..."" Seriously you can't make shite like this up... So we chat...she's going to have her dinner. And I start to wonder whether I will have mine. OK...8 minutes in. Valerie is warming up her dinner shoes...oh goody....score, at least the beer showed... OK Val...best move, transferring the table to Eric. Eric, you have your stuff together. Thanks. Rating goes from 1 to 3..."
Jun L.,"Pasadena, CA",432,391,3508,4.0,7/16/2013,"Pizookie!!!  So good if you have a sweet tooth!   Tried the red velvet and the white chocolate macadamia nut.   Celebrating dad's birthday so he got his own mini chocolate chip pizookie. For lunch we had the pork chop, rib eye steak, jambalaya, and salmon.   All food was pretty good and entrees came with either soup or salad.   Joey, our server, was very good in making sure we had everything we needed.   Would definitely come back again with family."
Derrick A.,"Temple City, CA",270,41,17,3.0,11/13/2015,"Decent prices and decent food. This place is just like any other major bar and grill restaurant like Bennigan's, TGI Friday's et al. The server was great and like I said, the food was passable. We got the ""Chicago Style"" deep dish pizza. It was good pizza but nothing at all like a real Chicago style pie. But it tasted good and the crust was actually better than expected. WE also got the ribs, which were pretty decent but not anything to come back for. Drinks were ok and they have a great selection of beer and spirits. WE also had two pizookies, one of which was comped by our waiter. They were good. Again, decent food at a good price. Don't ever really see myself coming back with all of the other places to check out."
Christian B.,"Monrovia, CA",28,9,4,2.0,5/8/2014,"I've never had bad service from this particular BJ's, but tonight (05/08/14) was different. My friends and I came here with a party of 7 on a Thursday night and it was fairly slow. We were having a simple going away dinner for our friend.  Our first server was a very nice gentleman that was pretty good. He only forgot our utensils and only gave them to us after we asked and after all of our plates were in front of us. No biggie :) About midway through dinner, he tells us that his shift is ending and that another person would be helping us out from there. What he didn't tell us was our service was also going out the door with him! It all went downhill from that point...  We were never offered one refill for any of our empty drinks. We didn't get checked up on. We asked for the dessert menu and the single menu she eventually brought us took long to come out. After 15-20 minutes, the server still didn't show. Eventually our friend that was going away went to the front desk to ask for the manager to come to our table.  She came by and we told her what was going on. She didn't apologize, she didn't offer us anything, and she didn't seem like she wanted to make the situation any better. All she kept saying was ""Ok. Ok. Ok."" We asked for our checks and she only gave us one pen to use among the 7 of us here... Weirdly, the manager only took a couple of our checks at a time and didn't wait for all of us to put together the money for all of our bills. My friend eventually told the manager that he was upset we were forgotten and that no one apologized for what happened to us. She finally said sorry and she said she ""thinks"" we got bad service because she ""thinks"" the girl got too busy... I'm no expert but- oh wait I am- I work in customer service as a manager and that is no excuse. Recognize the spike in business and redirect your employees accordingly. Also, if you were as busy as you said you were, why did we see you casually talking to the host as we're walking out instead of helping your servers? You lying girl. Luckily the balsamic chicken was great as always."
Sal M.,"Los Angeles, CA",293,1582,2037,3.0,1/15/2013,"Was there last night and the service at first was good,but as less people were there the waiter went somewhere. It seemed since we were only having a sampler and some drinks we were not worth the time. Been to this one specific place a few times and service has always been good. Oh Well"
A C.,"Alhambra, CA",17,75,7,4.0,5/31/2015,"BJ's is always good! My favorite orders are calamari, Marghuerita Fresca flatbread, and their house Hef. Have also tried the burgers, sliders, and artichoke dip. And the Blonde beer. All good."
Brianna C.,"Rowland Heights, CA",21,14,3,2.0,4/28/2015,"My sister & I came here on a Sunday evening.  This location is smaller than some of the other ones I've been to & although the place seemed pretty full, we were seated as soon as we stepped in.  And this was pretty much the extent of timely service we received... We waited for at least 15-20min before the waiter even came over to ask if we wanted drinks or if we were ready to order.  Upon ordering,  we waited another 20min for our food which only consisted of their Thai Mango Salad & their Seared Ahi Tuna Salad.  The waiter never came over to check on us & when he finally did,  we asked for the bill & a couple boxes.  This took another 15-20min.   Although we enjoyed our food... the lack of ""flow"" & teamwork at this establishment was disappointing.  There were at least 3 different waiters/waitresses working the area we were sitting in, yet there service was still slow.  As much as I enjoy the food from BJ's (4 start-worthy!), I had to give this location only 2 stars :/"
Anita A.,"Chino Hills, CA",1,4,2,4.0,1/4/2015,"Great place to come for happy hour. Service is good but does not stand out. We usually order the artichoke dip, bear and the fries for two people."
Tina L.,"Arcadia, CA",135,16,1,2.0,6/28/2015,"""Welcome"" is not how we felt walking in tonight... the hostess made us feel like we were inconveniencing her. If it weren't for the other good experiences we've had with the bar staff, I would've given one star. The hostess tried twice to put us at a 2-top that was in a tight corner, and after asking for a different table, she rolled her eyes and put us at a 4-top in the middle of the dining room... and at a table that hadn't been bussed yet. It was a couple of hours before closing, so there were plenty of tables and booths available. I was so disappointed, we walked out. We normally visit during happy hour on the weekdays, and the bar staff provides great service. Whoever trains the bar servers should extend the same training and expectations to the host staff. Just sayin'!"
Elizabeth Y.,"Alhambra, CA",48,236,631,2.0,11/9/2014,"Why the lady put us at the bar??!!! Clearly, we came in as a family ... I don't drink and either does the rest of the family!!! Another server did the same to another family!! What's going on here!!! I realized that part of BJ is a bar, but it's quite obvious that it's not what we are looking for!!! The other family, also, gave the server the ""eye"" & asked to be seated elsewhere, away from the bar ... Thank goodness that we were elsewhere later on!"
W T.,"Arcadia, CA",53,87,34,5.0,6/30/2014,"This is our goto restaurant for a fun and informal family night. The atmophere is lively, esp when there is an important game. We watched the Stanley cup final there and the whole restaurant was clapping and cheering together!! No wonder there is always a long wait in this restaurant. Food is alright. We love the deep dish pizza. Our favorite is chicken ranch deep dish. It is very satisfying. We like the ahi poke, and spinach dip to start out. They got a wide range of menu items to choose from. The price is all reasonable. And of course, you got to finish up the meal with a good dessert. Pzookie is always our fav. Just a perfect end to a great meal!!"
