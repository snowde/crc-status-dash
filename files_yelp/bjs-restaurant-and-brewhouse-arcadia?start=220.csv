Dayae K.,"Los Angeles, CA",182,331,7,3.0,1/31/2012,"The service!!! My cousin visited from Korea and my family wanted to go to an American restaurant close by. My parents got to the restaurant first and put our name down for reservations. They hostess told us about 30 mins. We waited for a good 40-50 minutes before we were called... a group that came before us, also with a party of 5, got seated way before we did. So we were finally seated at this awkward shaped corner booth. We got our menus and was trying to order, but it was SO DAMN LOUD in the restaurant. There was a birthday party for a baby right next to us and the baby was screeching and yelling because she wanted to take off her shirt. I understand she's just a baby, but as parents, shouldn't they have done something about it? All they did was laugh and point for a good 10 minutes of the screeching until they finally let the baby do what she wanted to do.  So we order amidst all the noise and chaos and receive our food. The food was good and portions were enough.  What we hoped would be a good family dinner, turned out to be a chaotic, noisy, out-of-control dinner. We ate and left as quickly as we could."
Nina W.,"Torrance, CA",211,325,164,4.0,6/22/2014,"Great location, ample parking and the staff are all super nice!! Our server checked up on us multiple times. I came here with my dad and I got the mahi mahi tacos and he got a chicken club lunch combo. The mahi mahi tacos are nothing special... I actually think the ones at Elephant Bar tasted better. My dad seemed to enjoy his sandwich and didn't even let me have a bite. haha.  Inside is very clean and has many TVs for your sports-viewing pleasure :D"
Steve C.,"Glendora, CA",42,47,55,4.0,3/10/2015,Pizza and fresh brewed beer..what else to say!
Mason F.,"Sunnyvale, CA",80,14,3,5.0,3/19/2015,I went there for my birthday tonight and Paul was a great server! I also got a complimentary pizookie which was DELISH. Also the potato wedges were bomb dignity and a mini pizza appetizer during happy hour was SO WORTH IT. Good job BJ's. I'll be back
Marissa D.,"Boston, MA",1,9,7,5.0,11/20/2016,"Came here to have dinner tonight because they have a large gluten free menu for my sister. If you have a gluten allergy, it's really hard to find places to eat with large menus. So far BJ's is the only one we can find that has many options! I can't say enough how impressed I am. I have eaten at other locations but this one surpasses them all. It was packed when I walked in for dinner and I didn't even have to wait to be seated. The waitresses we had, Liz and Maria, were super friendly and helpful! Yelp alerts you to the special written in Orange when on the app. I found they have a 2 for $25 deal so I did that. The waitress was kind enough to tell me we could upgrade the pizza to a large for only $3. She made my night. We had the BJ Favorite and it was wonderful. We all had side salads (can choose from house, wedge, Caesar, or tomato and mozzarella) that were great and we got pizookies for dessert. If you have never tried one, boy are you missing out! Overall this is a great family place with wonderful food and excellent service. We will most definitely be coming back to this location. Most worth the further drive! BTW if you plan on coming often, they have a great rewards program and a nifty app!"
Jenny M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,11,,4.0,10/30/2015,"Four stars because: - Service was outstanding. She was attentive to our needs and didn't make any mistakes on our orders! - Food was hot and delicious, which meant it didn't sit at all while it was in the back Came here for dinner and drinks with my girlfriend on Thursday night, and it was great! I absolutely love the ambience of BJ's. It's so lively, and I'm not one of those people who hate noisy places, I adore them! Our server was Camille and she was exemplary! She was nice and attentive, no complaints on service! Food was delicious. We started off with Mojitos and it was really worth it. We also got appetizers, spinach and artichoke dip. I was expecting it to be small, but the portions were outstandingly big! We didn't even get to finish it, but it was so good! My friend got the Ziti, which she commented was really good. Normally, places like BJ's who serve multiple ethnic foods like Asian, Italian, Mexican dishes don't really do well because they don't have a strong flavor palette, but this restaurant is the exception! I got the black & bleu burger. It was delicious!  I would have to say the ONLY minor drawback was the seating. We were sat all the way in the back, at a little table. I know it's not their fault & they were busy, but this was the only reason why this review wasn't five stars.  Overall, a good experience! Will be coming back again for happy hour! Good job BJ's!"
E Z.,"Pasadena, CA",2,27,21,5.0,3/2/2015,"Warm, familiar feel. I used to come see a friend here often. Came back after a long while and people still remember us. Feels good. I'm sure it can get hectic but we weren't rushed and all our food tasted great. Awaiting that pizzookie!  Yum."
Craig C.,"Temecula, CA",9,34,14,1.0,1/2/2014,"Our group of 6 was looking for a light dinner after the Rose Bowl game and agreed on BJs Brewery because they were located between our two hotels -- also because I've been to their Temecula location on several occasions and was never disappointed. I wanted to show our MI guests a nice restaurant with good food, atmosphere, and service. Everything started out great with no waiting for a table in the bar, waters delivered, and our drink orders taken.  After a few minutes, and as expected, our server delivered our drinks, with the exception of mine (everyone was drinking beer or wine and I ordered a diet Pepsi).  No big  deal, except it took her about 10 minutes to finally bring it out.  I survived and would not downgrade an establishment for that.  After placing our orders, our server promptly brought out our salads, which mine was very tasty.  After bringing out 4 of the six people's main entree, our server told us they ran out of the size pizza my wife and I ordered so they were making us a larger one, but it wasn't done yet - they need another 5 minutes to finish it.  We said no problem, we can wait while the others start their meals while they are still hot. After about 10 minutes the server and manager came over to apologize and said it was taking a little longer to cook the medium pizza and offered us some bread or salad while we waited for our food.  We declined and said we can wait a few more minutes.  As you can probably guess where this is heading, the pizza finally was placed in our table 30 minutes after they said it would only be 5 minutes. The rest of our party had already completed their meals, and of course everyone was exhausted after spending the entire day at the parade and football game. My wife and I offered some of the pizza to our guests because it was too much for us, and we ate as fast as we could so everyone could get back to their hotels.  The worst thing about my experience is that this specific pizza wasn't very good.  It seemed dry and not warm enough for my taste.  I've had this same pizza at the Temecula location and it was always excellent.   When the bill came I really expected the pizza, that was 30 minutes behind the rest of our parties food, to be taken off the bill.  I guess that was my fault for expecting them to do the right thing.   Based on my total experience, I probably won't return."
Laine C.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",545,227,1050,4.0,3/16/2012,Super great service when I came here with the parents. I ordered the Seared Ahi Salad which was delicious. Also had the Buffalo Chicken Deep Dish Pizza as recommended by the boyfriend. The buffalo chicken and the ranch combined on a pizza was good stuff.
Denisse G.,"Temple City, CA",204,59,108,3.0,10/16/2013,"For pizza, the restaurant isn't bad at all. It's not gourmet pizza and I would say a very different level from let's say, Tribunali, but for something casual and of course, American, it's good enough. It does it's job, which is to fill the stomach, and feed a table of customers.  My main reason to come is for the pizookie. The concept is very easy and widely known, but for a pizza joint, it's much more interesting. A pizza sized cookie amounting to at most four cookie flavors is cooked in a deep-dish pizza pan and then topped off with two to three scoops of ice cream. Sugar rush, anyone?  Good for large groups for any type of event. Beers on tap are a variety since they are also a brewery and cocktails are actually quite good too."
Joseph B.,"Malibu, CA",1,74,8,1.0,9/30/2013,"Got here at dinner time. For several days, I had been craving the seared Ahi salad.  The hostesses were friendly and indicated that it would be a very short wait. They were correct, 5 mins later my assigned  reservations ""vibrator"" was activated.  Ordered the Ahi salad and a lightswitch ale. Large crowd, a bit noisy and a few screaming kids, no big, its expected. Then I left to use the restroom...interestingly, the urinals and toilets were all filled with urine...WTF? this is odd, then I realized why, certain ethnicities don't flush toilets after just urinating....bizzare. same thing on my return trip 20 mins later. These individuals , wash their hands properly but refuse to flush toilets with only urine is involved...Geez, never again will I return to this part of town. I wont mention which ethnic group, but its obvious and amazingly, very consistent. I was tempted to yell at all these idiots, however, being a pacifist and a follower of Ghandi's teachings, I did not wish to fight that night so the restaurant's male patrons were all safe and very lucky... FLUSH THE TOILETS YOU DISGUSTING IDIOTS! The one star is for the patrons, the food was great, service was exceptional...customers sucked...."
Diana S.,"N HOLLYWOOD, CA",73,248,57,3.0,7/1/2014,"I am a HUGE fan of BJ but not this one at ALL. The wait staff was completely OFF. He brought me a cup a coffee and half the cup was in the saucer.  Coffee: Ok how can any place mess this up well it was cold, watered down and no one ever asked me if I wanted a refill. Minstone Soup: this was ok Wedge Salad: there was still water in the plate so when they put the dressing everything was watered down.  I just felt like this place was dirty the table was dirty when we sat down as well. Over all I don't know if I was there on an off day but I won't be back to this location any time soon!"
Jenny L.,"Arcadia, CA",60,277,581,4.0,6/26/2014,"I feel like I've re-discovered  BJ's.  I remember them having an extensive pizza and beer menu...they still do.  But I see on their menu now they have lunch specials, premium salads and calorie-conscious items such as grilled scallops with brown rice.  Lots of big screen tv for all the sports fans.  The couple of times I've been to this location, the AC is on full-blast.  This last time I was there was around 9pm and the greeters sort of checked out already."
Kim-lien N.,"Pasadena, CA",1,6,7,1.0,8/9/2015,I've been to other BJs and their food were good. Be careful of the pizza here. It's not fresh and tasted preheated. Don't waste your money and the service is slow.
Kristine N.,"Pasadena, CA",149,18,4,1.0,5/29/2015,"Everything was great until it came time for dessert.  Currently, we are waiting for our pazooki and we've been waiting almost an hour..."
William D.,"Temple City, CA",475,59,51,2.0,12/15/2013,"It's a always hit and miss here. Tonight was unfortunately the latter. It began with a bartender who couldn't mix one of BJ's own signature drinks. Next the food took so long to get to us that it's temperature ranged between luke warm and arctic. We would have complained to our waitress but she vanished quicker than Houdini as soon as she dropped off something at our table. Maybe we shouldn't have eaten in the bar, but we wanted to watch the football games. I guess we will have to go to The Boat next time."
Melanie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",351,261,1075,3.0,10/19/2013,Customer service - SUPERB!!  Clam chowder - too salty  Minestrone - just okay Spinach & Artichoke Pizza - not impressed at all :/  Red Velvet Pizookie - good  White Macadamia Nut Pizookie - good
Maggie H.,"Evanston, IL",391,461,451,4.0,1/21/2012,"I'm just surprised as you are that I'm giving BJ's four stars, but this location has come a long way. I remmeber back in the days, I came here with a group of friends before the Valentine's Formal because Olive Garden was too full. Oh, high school.  Anyway, this BJ's has since gone through a nice renevation, complete with flat screen tv's everywhere. They also have delicious beer, delicious drinks, and even the food is not half bad. I like that when you order a salad here, they don't try to skimp on the leafs. I mean, c'mon. Great local place to relax and hangout! I would say it's on par with Yardhouse."
Susan E.,"Arcadia, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/20/2016,"Very disappointed. The customer service was non existent until I got a manager to assist. He didn't do much but apologize, but he tried more than the girl who answered the phone. My order was to go. When I got home, my son's chicken club had so much mayonnaise on it that it was almost inedible. My child size pepperoni pizza was a blob of dough with some sauce and cheese thrown on it. Not a pepperoni in sight. It's no wonder I don't eat at BJ's often. Now I doubt I'll ever eat there again. Bad service, mediocre to bad food and it cost me over $30."
Sarlyn P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",295,433,371,3.0,6/3/2012,This BJs was okay. Nothing really special. We went here because most place were close around 10:30pm on a Sunday. I really like the stuffed mushrooms mini meal..but kinda disappointed with the clam chowder. Service was decent. Place was very attractive and clean. I like the HD Screen where they just show the menu and pictures of food. yum!
