Chris B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,10,1,4.0,9/26/2014,Good food service  but a little slow  My order was wrong I had to wait for my meal and the  rest of my party was finished eating by the time I received my food the manager came over and said she is very sorry you shouldn't have to wait for your meal  My meal was free thanks to the manager on  duty
Regina W.,"Los Angeles, CA",124,780,2001,3.0,6/2/2012,"3.5 stars for BJ's!!!! I've been going here for years and it's a great place to watch sports games. There are televisions all around and an enormous one at the bar! The food is pretty good but it depends what you get as some dishes are better than others. I personally love their wheat pizza, meatloaf sandwich and chicken marsala. The service is always good and the place is very new after they remodeled a while back."
Robert M.,"Del Mar, CA",0,15,21,3.0,7/12/2015,"The selection of BJ's Beer is good, and they have a broad selection of guest beers. The wines are pretty generic. Food was all American, emphasis on burgers and pizzas. I had the kale and brussel sprouts salad with chicken, which was not bad! And the other person in the party had cheeseburger which was very tasty! Overall a nice easy place for lunch or dinner, but a bit generic."
Ricky S.,"Los Angeles, CA",87,262,906,2.0,3/3/2014,"I visited this restaurant on a Friday night around 8pm. This place definitely gets packed. I was here with just another person, so I was thinking that the wait would be short. We decided to eat here because we use to enjoy this place when we were both in college. Also, I was craving some good pizza. I haven't been here in a while, but I remember really enjoying the food. HOWEVER, I was very disappointed.  To start, I ordered a bowl of tomato bisque, side of wedge potato fries, and small pizza. It was a rainy day, so I ordered the soup. It still tastes great, one of my favorite places to order a tomato bisque. The side of wedge potato fries were very disappointing. This dish use to be served with sour cream, chives, and shredded cheese. Unfortunately, they just serve the fries alone unless you request for certain things on the side. Lastly, the pizza was horrible. I've been to other BJ's and I've enjoyed their pizza....even this location, before. I wasn't sure if they were just busy and overlooked my pizza, but after reading other reviews...their flaw appeared to be consistent. I ordered a small pizza and split it with a great white and sweet pig. The pizza came out lukewarm...not even hot at all. That was real disappointing. I felt like the dough itself was still raw. I probably won't come here again for their pizza, but maybe other items here are still good.  The service...I have mixed reviews. My first waiter was great, he stopped by and refilled out waters and checked in to make sure everything was fine. However, he took a break and switched out with a waitress. Once that happened, we were ignored the rest of the night except when she rushed us to pay the bill. Her name was Erika. I probably won't return to this place, maybe if I am looking for some tomato bisque. If people ask me for some recommendations or decide to choose this place for a night out, I wouldn't suggest this place."
Rene D.,"South Pasadena, CA",5,36,50,1.0,2/7/2014,"Horrible service from our waitress (Crystal) if you get her give her a verbal tip! On taking etiquette and customer service classes. She asked if I wanted lemon in my water I stated ""yes that's fine"" her reply was abrasive of ""WHAT"""
Faith L.,"Monrovia, CA",0,23,6,1.0,2/12/2015,"Words of advice - don't go!! If you happen to like BJ's and I understand that just go somewhere else. I consider myself a foodie I enjoy going to many different kinds of restaurants. So it was no deal yesterday when I decide to meet up with a friend have a couple drinks and dinner. I really wish I would have read these reviews first before coming to this location. I was going to tell you straight up they don't care about your well-being. Never in my life have I have been so sick in the past 24 hours, and I knew something was wrong with my stomach while I was there and I had ordered and Gingerale. The minute I got home I was profusely sick. While on my way to the emergency room I called the manager let him know what was going on for concern for other patrons. At first he seemed to care and he told me he would refund my money and asked me for a receipt. I told him I did not have that and then I was headed to the emergency room, after I got back from the hospital I called him again. That's when everything changed including his story. Basically made me out to be a liar and said that it was not his restaurant at all that made me sick and that he was not going to refund my money nor that he told me he when in fact he did. he also lied about me needing a receipt and said that all he needed was a card number. I hate nothing more than liars- and I don't know what his agenda was but don't lie to me !! like what do you think I'm stupid? like I'm not gonna recollect what you told me?  And to add insult to injury he told me that the company will get back to me when they can about the situation. And he refused to answer me when I asked when can I expect to hear back form them. I'm sorry I don't deserve this - I serve my community and I deserve much better customer service and then get food poisoning and then be treated like this told that it's not their problem night wasn't them and then lied to twice. That's just disgusting !  Just take your money elsewhere and save your health, they don't care."
Anthony R.,"Los Angeles, CA",88,59,1,5.0,2/10/2015,Great food and very courteous staff.  I dropped by at this place with my buddies for a Sunday lunch and was pleasantly surprised with quality of food and service. Crispy Salmon and avocado rolls were beyond delicious.
Ann F.,"Pomona, CA",265,133,181,4.0,3/24/2014,The five of us arrived at 6:30pm to be waited for 30 minutes with a pager.  It was busy with March Madness games on TVs. I ordered brewhouse burger which is my usual cause it comes on a bun that reminds me of cheesebread I miss at Sizzler!  I picked thick fries; which is good!   We've been using the Rewards and a $5.00 off coupon.  Looking forward to coming again there!
Stasha R.,"Pasadena, CA",0,12,,1.0,8/2/2013,"I've been to this BJ'S a number of times before, but never had I experienced a lunch like the one I did on Tuesday the 23rd of July.  The waitress was horrible!!  From the moment she came to our table, by the way which was 10 minutes after we had set down she seemed like she didn't want to be there.  Then she continued to miss items form our order.  When we finally received our meal we had to take it to go because we spent an hour waiting for it.  I am not sure of the waitress name, but if you go to this BJ's and see a waitress coming to your table who looks like she is having a bad day ask to be seated somewhere else, because you will be enjoying your lunch at home for dinner! S."
Caroline M.,"Summit Point, WV",5,2,,2.0,7/9/2015,First time visit with unfriendly and terrible service. Seems like they don't even care about their customers. Food was average. Would not go there again!!
Yvette D.,"Covina, CA",128,57,188,3.0,3/12/2014,"Disappointment with the service is the reason for the 3 stars! Came for a late lunch and stood at the front for a good several minutes before being somewhat greeted! They were definitely not on point in this area! Finally, after being seated we were not given menu's. When the waitress came, she had to get them for us. She was very friendly and accommodating. When the food was served we realized they did not give us place settings and had to get up and get them ourselves. :( Our food was delicious as always... I got the Pasta & Soup lunch special (Cajun pasta & tortilla soup... Favorites of mine!). Service was mediocre, which was surprising because they were not that busy. Overall, I was not impressed by this location, but love BJ's!!"
Holly L.,"Rosemead, CA",369,65,15,5.0,12/27/2013,"Eric. He is THE best. Super friendly.  Very knowledgeable about the menu. After last weeks horrible experience at the bjs in montebello, I decided to come back to this location to see if it was as good as I remembered it to be and it was.  The food was on point. It was all cooked perfectly. I feel bad cause my review is mainly about the service which again was perfect by eric. Our drink were refilled when needed. The food was placed very nicely onto our table and he brought boxes for our leftovers. Continuously checking up on us until the end. The drive is a bit further but we'll definitely come back here instead of the montebello location."
Richard B.,"San Gabriel, CA",690,252,1289,2.0,10/13/2013,"Food 3 stars Atmosphere 3 stars Service 1 star Some of the staff seem okay, but they need to smile more. I don't go out to put up with unhappy servers and debts that don't remember the orders. I especially don't appreciate excuses when they make mistakes. Just say sorry and do your best to make up for the mistakes. Stop making lame excuses and blame it on your coworkers!! I doubt I'll be coming back!!"
Dark Slide Paranormal M.,"Temple City, CA",13,14,92,1.0,9/9/2013,Runny wet and wilted lettuce filled shrimp tacos. Left overs?  UGH!!! Won't return here again. The waiter...never asked how the salty food was or why I was wiping off my taco shells with a napkin and squeezing lettuce lol.
Robert L.,"Alhambra, CA",5,17,,1.0,10/4/2014,"My most recent visit to BJ's at Arcadia yielded a very disappointing experience. BJ's is supposed to be a relatively up scale sport bar/restaurant. The food and service quality should be above average, which make the experience worse. We ordered five dishes including pizzza, spaghetti, sampler and etc. Spaghetti is so soft that I cannot hesitate proclaim that I can even make it better at home. The other dishes are mediocre at the best. When the waiter bought us extra plates. They were still stained with leftover food. I mean, come on, he should have inspect them before handing over to the customer.   Definitely not going back again. Not even if the food is free."
Rita L.,"Monrovia, CA",188,471,306,4.0,2/22/2015,"We were a large group of 15 and they sat us in the back with 3 tables pushed together to accommodate us for happy hour. Our server was really great, and understood our needs as a large party. We got beers and cocktails, pizzas and appetizers, and no complaints at all. I enjoyed the strawberry mojito, though weak, was still very refreshing. Best part was the giant pazookie my end of the table ordered, 3 flavors of cookie and a massive pile of vanilla bean and chocolate ice cream in the middle. Our meal lasted over 2 hrs, and even after we got the check and paid, there was no rush to move us out. The happy hour appetizers were very shareable: the personal pizzas were large enough to split between 2-3 people, and the avocado egg rolls were pretty heavy so good for 2-3 people as well."
Ron H.,"Philadelphia, PA",462,426,657,1.0,8/11/2013,"We walked in here during X-Games LA and we couldn't get a table or service while standing at the bar.  Yes, there was 6 of us, but there were open 4 tops all over the restaurant and no one wanted to slide anything together for us.  We waited 25 minutes before a patron in the bar made room for us by sliding over to a different table so we could make our own group table... then it was a fight between going trying to get a waitresses attention for a drink refill and walking up to the bar to try and just get our own.  I should also mention that the other patrons around recognized one of us (he had a Gold medal around his neck he won at X-Games about 4 hours earlier) and he posed for plenty of pictures and signed autographs with the patrons at the bar. We had an average size food order, but there were multiple mistakes on it, not to mention we didn't all get silverware and had to twice ask for plates so we could share the appetizers. The food isn't bad, some dishes are actually good enough to order a second time (tuna with pita chips and wasabi sauce), but the service is so horrible I wouldn't return if the meal was comped and the GM was waiting at the front door to seat us personally."
Harue S.,"Los Angeles County, CA",153,33,31,5.0,1/5/2014,"Great service and food were excellent. Had Bison Burger (bufflo burger) and was delicious; dosen't taste gamy, excellent flavor and not dry. For people that are on diet, this is best burger to have. High on protein low on fat :) my bf had clam chowder in bread bowl. He said it was real good as well."
Jennifer G.,"Monrovia, CA",0,12,6,4.0,12/1/2014,"Came in tonight for a Bailey's and coffee, &  a Pazooki for my B.fs birthday! Recieved amazing service from our server Alexander J. Very attentive with refills,  considering we got water;  & one drink.  Most servers ignore you if you aren't spending crazy money on dinner,  but sometimes at 10 at night all you want I'd dessert!  We're frequent diners here, & have never received such great service!  Two thumbs up for Alexander!"
Denise G.,"Monrovia, CA",6,35,10,4.0,2/24/2014,"Personally I love BJ's .  Their food and dessert ""pizookie"" are the best ! This restaurant tends to always be pretty busy, although they're busy they always get to you fast. The staff is very friendly and makes you feel welcomed.  A few times they have messed up on out order but they fix it right away. Great restaurant , come here very often. Best is when they have their 2 for 20 special ! It's such a bargain ! You get a lot for your money."
