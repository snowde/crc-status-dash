Marji E.,"Monrovia, CA",18,20,,2.0,2/21/2014,"Disappointing! Went at 5:30 sat in the bar. Caution: don't order a mojito lite. Awful. Server was bad, ordered 2 appetizers he only brought one. No napkin or silverware, never asked us how it was. The 2 managers we spoke with were great. Advice to servers everywhere: don't have a personal convo when you are ignoring me and I can hear you.  Probably time to cross this one off my list."
Katie P.,"Pasadena, CA",26,31,,1.0,3/26/2013,"We were a party of four, greeted by extremely rude hosts. No eye contact, no smile. I've been working in restaurants for about 8 years so it's safe to say I have high expectations, but even so this was so bad. We were quoted 20 minutes and were seated after 35. We got to our table and waited for 10 minutes to be greeted. The first thing that happened was that my glass was dirty. Like, disgusting brown goop along the INSIDE of the glass. I was drinking a Coke (which is dark) so I didn't even noticed until I had taken a few sips. I tried getting our servers attention for 10 more minutes to get it replaced. I was very polite about it and even apologized for requesting a new glass. Our server was rude and snatched the glass off the table. When it came time to pay, the four of us needed four separate checks. Now, I'm a sever and i know how to split checks efficiently, it isn't complicated if you enter the orders under the correct seat number in the first place. And even if you don't it's an easy fix with the managers help. He asks us to split it, use a calculator, write down the last four digits of our card numbers, all this unnecessary crap. When we give him the calculations, he returns and tells us we didn't add in the tax. Are you kidding me? That's not either of our jobs - that's what the computer does. Ugh, anyway. I felt bad tipping low but this was honestly the worst restaurant experience I've had. Try the Chili's down the street."
Jane A.,"Pasadena, CA",0,15,2,2.0,3/28/2015,Haven't had such bad service in a while. Working in the food industry myself takes a lot for me to rate this low because I can understand how tough it can be but not this time. Went in Thursday night with two of my friends. Don't remember our waiters name but she had red hair. Anyway they were clearly fully staffed because the number of waiters/servers was more then the amount of tables taken. She took our order and brought our drinks then food which was fine until we obviously needed refills and she would look at our table and keep walking. She did that about 6 times. My friend had to wave her down. She finally brought us refills and our bill at the same time. That was the only time she checked up on us. We then waited another 30 minutes for her to come back and get the bill. Rather drive the extra 10 minutes to the Monrovia location next time.
Marko S.,"Upland, CA",1,70,14,1.0,7/20/2014,BJs what happens to you? disgusting...listen to this we come to BJs a lot but not this one in Arcadia. First off we ordered our pizzas with no olives or tomatoe because my daughter is SEVERELY allergic to them. so after 40 minutes the pizzas come out full of olives we send them back and they come 40 min later with double tomatoes and my slice had a huge hair on it as if almost to say here u go buddy. the Female manager on duty was very nice and helpful and the waiter was ok but man they really need to teach the kitchen staff that some toppings can hurt people and they have to be very careful. I won't be back to this location...
Natasha B.,"Duarte, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/1/2016,"I came here tonight with my family and ordered the boneless wings and kids deep dish pizza (we ordered other stuff that was edible at best). My daughter's pizza arrived burnt (black dough) and the wings were completely disgusting. They were basically jack in the box nuggets half assed microwaved and dipped in like orange powder and the garlic ones were dipped in what looked like jiz. I'm a Christian so I don't usually complain but holy christ it was bad. We spoke to the manager who looked bewildered the entire time I was explaining the situation. In conclusion, the waiter was cool, the manager was either incompetent or didn't like my complaint because we ended not paying for the kids pizza, but he only gave us a total of 20% off the meal so we still ended up paying for those awful wings. The only reason I didn't go ape shit is because I'm a Christian. And because my husband and kid wanted to go get Pieology."
Bran S.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,18,6,2.0,3/14/2016,"We literally waited 15 minutes to be seated at a table that I asked to be seated at that was empty our entire wait , very very frustrating and we almost left. Now the experience is over and I wish we would of."
Alice G.,"Pasadena, CA",38,128,11,1.0,1/15/2013,"The competence of one of our servers here was awful. It was happy hour, and we sat at the bar for the happy hour specials, and we ordered from the happy hour menu, while asking about what they may offer for happy hour drinks. See where I am going here? Then when we get our check we notice, she didn't give us the happy hour price for one of our orders. When. We ask her about it, she says ""oh you guys were looking off the regular menu so I assumed you wanted the regular order. Because this spinach artichoke is actually bigger than the happy hour one. So I billed the regular not the happy hour one."" What ever happened to asking instead of assuming? Needless to say we did dock her tip since, this ""mistake"" shouldn't have happened in the first place. Why would we order a regular-order when we ordered everything else on the happy hour menu while asking about the prices about items on the happy hour menu. All I wanted to do was get a snack, not pay 30+ for a mistaken meal.  Another thing is, different servers passed by at least 15 times before my little sister had a refill on her empty soda. This was a good 15+ min, we were near the kitchen so they were passing us a lot. Oh best part was, there were about 5 groups of 2-4 people in the restaurant total. So we didn't come in at a super busy time.  I did notice the waitress chatting it up with the bartender most of the time though.  For the service and the handling of the situation, I don't think I'll go to this branch of BJs again.  And who serves warm beer?! It was sitting on the bar top for a while before it was given to our table. Never coming here again. I have had better service elsewhere. This particular location left me disappointed with the BJ's chain restaurants.  I'm sure the waitress knew she was wrong because she kept coming back while my boyfriend and I discussed the amount of tip we were going to give her. She checked up on us more often when we were discussing her tip versus the whole afternoon we were there for drinks and food."
Daisy K.,"Pasadena, CA",877,1020,283,3.0,7/1/2011,"Their lunch specials are fairly affordable if you need to go the mega-restaurant chain route. Parking can be a pain if it's a busy day, but lunch is usually tolerable. Service is nice and friendly -- been here a handful of times and haven't had issues yet. Although, I must say, pretty disappointed when I ordered chicken tenders at 12pm on a Thursday and was told they ran out. =( Fail!"
David W.,"Santa Clara, CA",601,1208,866,3.0,8/21/2011,"Happy hour is at the bar ONLY which is kinda lame...so don't come here if you have a big group. Pizzas are not as good as they used to be.  Tried the Pale Ale Nachos.  Name sounds cool, but tastes like regular Nachos to me."
Alexis A.,"Glendale, CA",65,95,22,5.0,11/28/2014,Amazing food! Great service! Couldn't be any happier! We didn't have to sit and wave our hands waiting for our waitress. She was so quick and was very attentive! We enjoyed this location a lot! Oh and parking was amazing!!!!!
Joanne L.,"Rosemead, CA",420,296,135,4.0,10/30/2012,"One of the few chain restaurants that I love! Deep dish pizza and pizookie FTW! Happy Hour 3-7pm and 10pm to close: $5 mini pizza and $2 off appetizers. That's a deal to me! Pizookie: One of my all-time favorite desserts. I didn't know there's a red velvet option, but I think I'll stick with my half white chocolate with macadamia nut and half chocolate chip cookie.  ------------ Service is generally good, but the last time our server was being a doofus. We asked her what the happy hour specials were and she said it's not written anywhere and then proceeded to recite specials in blazing light year speed and then walks off, giving us more time to decipher what she blurted out. ""...Huh? Sorry ma'am, I don't think we caught any of that. Can you repeat that again... slowly?"" I don't think she understood the idea that she is supposed to sell us what was on the menu, not deter us from ordering. Finally, I asked about Monday happy hour, which she then realized she missed a couple happy hour specials and finally found the happy hour menu on another table. (I thought you said it wasn't written, you liar, pants on fire). Anyways, aside from that mishap, everything else was swell."
Michelle K.,"Pasadena, CA",532,691,249,4.0,12/8/2010,"I'm definitely a fan now that they remodeled the entire restaurant! It was always an easy default place for me and the bestie when we wanted a quick drink and bite, but I'm thinking we'll be here more often because... 1. they remodeled everything and they now have pretty wood ceilings and nice booths and the bar is GORGEOUS!!! 2. their new dessert...the beignet.   and a half. Strawberries, cinammon, and ice cream = fantastical 3. Berry Burst Cider - where have you been all of my life?!?!?! This stuff tastes like cherry 7up on steroids and I'm so glad I asked the server about it and he was overly enthusiastic about me trying it.  So glad I did. AMAZING experience...and great times with the bestie as always.  ""Ummm...is that who I think it is?!"""
Skj T.,"El Segundo, CA",22,517,32,1.0,1/4/2015,Wow!! Expensive !!!! $45 for one pizza and two pizookies !!!! Maybe if the food was really good but paying $45 not including tip was not worth it at all! I can stick to alternatives... Hello Pizza Hut !
X-Tina G.,"Monrovia, CA",111,23,32,5.0,12/12/2014,"Went on a date with my husband and ordered spaghetti with meatballs. When I got my meal there were no meatballs :( The staff was accommodating and ordered up a side of MB but when it came out it was mushy. Although the meatball situation was not so good, I give a 5 star because the manager & waiter were so nice and sincere about my concerns with the dish. They offered solutions & went out of their way to remedy the situation."
Brian S.,"Sierra Madre, CA",1175,414,248,3.0,9/21/2012,"BJ's tried to cryogenically freeze me. I know this because I asked the waiter if he could turn down the AC not just once, but five times. Each time he said ""sure"" and each time after I asked, I swear to you, it actually got colder...  I think the secret plan was to have a customer for life. They were going to stash me in the freezer and when business was slow, grab my credit card from my frozen body and just ring up a couple of beers. Maybe a pizookie or two... ...but I'm on to you BJs! Next time, I'm bringing a sweater. I don't care if its September and 100 degrees outside. I'll be prepared.  On another note, good happy hour after 10 pm. Unfortunately, its in the bar area only, where the polar bears hang out..."
Qui C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",730,844,191,4.0,12/25/2010,"PRO: Great White pizza - My all time favorite! What a great creation :) CON: Sweet Pig - I can get a better Hawaiian pizza at Papa John's for half the price. Recommended Special Brews: Hefeweizen, Blonde, and Tatonka."
Jon P.,"Zürich, Switzerland",24,93,2,2.0,5/30/2013,"This place is pretty whatever. Some food is OK (pizzas and the like) some is bad. Beer is OK, but pricey. A resounding 'meh'."
Dwain C.,"Rosemead, CA",1014,1262,2656,4.0,10/24/2013,"I ate dinner at the B.J's Restaurant & Brewhouse in Arcadia, CA on 10/21/2013.  I've been there a couple of times before.  This time I ate with the Jacks and Queens group.  I had their Moroccan salmon ($12.95) and coffee ($1.99).  The Moroccan salmon was very good.  Joey, our server, was attentive as well.  The only problem with B.J's is it is very, very loud place to have dinner."
Brittany J.,"Monrovia, CA",15,12,1,3.0,1/8/2014,"PAZOOKIE. I could say it a thousand times but it weighs little on the overall experience of pizza, warm brownies and the amazing pomegranate lemonade. Used a groupon on date night and the service was great. The booths are comfy(always a plus) and the server was considerate. The ambiance was nice, and the game was playing on every television...that makes it a 3.5 star review."
Joy Krisette D.,"Temple City, CA",73,5,,1.0,8/7/2014,"We came here for my sister's post wedding rehearsal dinner and the service sucks!!!  First of all we have a reservation at 7pm and we didn't get to sit until 8pm!!  The food didn't get to us until after 30 mins, the visitors were all hungry, the service is too slow."
