Jackie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,186,31,3.0,11/23/2013,"Since Cheesecake Factory was too occupied we decided to go here as a last minute plan. Olive Garden is next to it, I've never been to Bj's. My friend who I went with said it's like Cheesecake Factory. It was not like Cheesecake Factory, not even close. First of all I felt way too dress to have dinner here. Everyone's so casual. The floor was so slippery, ladies I don't recommend you to wear heels in this restaurant. It's like walking on ice or something. Why do they take forever on their service? Or at least to us they did. Waiter took forever, and when he got our orders.. The cook brought out the wrong plate for my friend. My friend even pointed to the picture of what she wanted, how do you get it wrong. If you're unsure, just double check. It's better to be wrong and correct it than wasting a plate of food already cooked. (I used to work at a restaurant so I'm aware of double checking in case). Anywho, we now had to wait for the right plate to come out. Another waiter came by to let us know that they've already ordered the right plate. Then the floor manager came by and asked if everything was okay, apologized and made sure we were taken care of. At least that was the right thing to do so I will give them credit for that. We ordered the traditional wings for appetizer, I got the angel hair toscana and my friend ordered the parmesan chicken. My pasta was good, but my bread just seemed a bit hard like it was sitting there for a while waiting for the pasta to be done.The 2nd waiter was better, he got us refills and made sure we were alright. And towards the end, we did wait a while again to get our check.  Overall, food is decent. As for customer service, I'll let you decide by reading my review if it was great or not."
Angelina L.,"Manhattan, NY",158,44,14,2.0,11/26/2014,"We somehow always end up here whenever we're back in Arcadia to see the family. Decent pizzas and pastas but not something I would intuitively suggest to anyone. Beer is good though! And don't forget the pizookie, which is this ooey gooey warm giant cookie topped with ice cream."
Feeleep O.,"Baldwin Park, CA",571,45,18,1.0,2/18/2013,"Long wait time, expensive pricing, and not so great service. Our server rarely visited us or asked us if we need anything else. And worst of all, my food came out horrible. I ordered the rib eye medium. It came out extremely well done like burnt piece of charcoal and tasted like it as well. I flagged down our server after several attempts and finally got it redone. When it came out the steak was fine but my sides weren't there. Then I had to ask again but the food never came :/ Chinese cafes have better food and service than here."
Saroya W.,"San Francisco, CA",238,174,94,3.0,7/10/2013,"I generally like the BJ's chain of restaurants. They've got a large selection of food, dessert, and drinks. It's a great spot to choose if people in your party don't know what kind of food they want. And it's an easy place to accommodate parties of higher numbers. I went to this one recently to meet a friend for dinner and dessert. I wasn't particularly hungry so I ordered the mozzarella tomato salad, and had a glass of the moscato. I really enjoyed the salad: it was light, and crisp and cool on a hot night. The moscato was a bit too sweet for my taste. My friend ended up ordering the white chocolate pazookie; she let me have a bite and it was really good. The reason I'm giving this three stars is because the bartender kept rushing us to make a decision on drinks, dinner/dessert, and to pay the check. There wasn't a huge wait by any means. It just felt like she wanted us to get out of there."
Angela O.,"Torrance, CA",50,18,3,5.0,11/13/2014,Honestly. Â Everything went wrong but the manager Jennifer made my experience a more positive one.
Jennifer D.,"Irvine, CA",8,13,3,1.0,10/15/2012,"Never going to this place again.  I ordered a build your own pizza - with pineapple and olives. They came back with pepperoni and olives (I'm a vegetarian) so I let them know that I ordered pineapple, not pepperoni. The waiter said sorry and a few minutes later came back with the correct pizza - but it was obvious they had just removed some of the pepperoni and put pineapple on top, for I could see the pepperoni on the bottom. By this time everyone in my party was done eating -_-  Needless to say, I was pretty upset. When the manager finally came out with the right pizza, he apologized and said it was free. However nice that is, it doesn't take away the fact that they had attempted to cover up their mistake instead of fix it."
Judith G.,"Duarte, CA",0,15,,4.0,3/14/2015,"Great food, fun atmosphere and service is not too bad. If you get sick and tired of places that only carry the typical Bud, Coors, Miller and Blue Moon beers, then this is a great place to come!"
Cynthia S.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",382,284,61,2.0,7/9/2012,"Not sure if people work here for the job, or they work here waiting for girls to walk in so they can check them out in a very awkward and obvious way...  I mean I didn't even have make-up on... sure my heels were sexy as hell but what does that matter when they make the floors so slippery that you can't walk on them... Wait time 20 min... hostess told us we could wait by the bar grab a drink till they call us.. Why not! Got a seat at the bar... Waiter came by 3 min after we sat asking what we wanted... Told him to give us ONE min, he left and never came back! WELL OK THEN!! 15 min later we get called for our booth!!!  Sit.. look at the menu... wait for the waitress who didn't seem to know much about the drink menu. Ordered the new watermelon mojito (she thought its non alcoholic) she came back to check my ID! lol The Bartender (who had spilled his drink earlier cuz he was too busy checking me out) obviously wanted to get us drunk... The drinks were TOOO strong and not very good either! [usually not a bad thing, but I was driving]. Ordered the mozzarella sticks for appetizer, Not so good!  Got the avocado egg rolls for dinner and the Sate Fe Salad... Salad came out 10 min before the egg rolls! BOO... Salad wasn't the best, tasted bland... the avocado egg rolls were really good, but the sauce was too watery! Not gonna complain since I love the egg rolls too much...  Got a mini Pizookie.. Didn't taste like the Pizookies I've had at other locations.. Not the best...  Got the Check before we got our dessert! This is NOT McDonalds, I dont want to pay before I'm done eating... I put the check on the booth right under my purse and the waitress tried to get it out! ''We're not ready to pay yet"" GEEZ let me eat the pizookie first! Parking is easy... Food wasn't the best I've had at a Bj's... Service not the best... All male workers are waiting for a girl to walk in so they can stare them down! Awkward!!"
Anthony L.,"San Dimas, CA",7,40,7,1.0,11/11/2014,Extremely disappointed in the services. We order appetizers only and it took 45 minutes. I will never come to this place ever again.
Guy D.,"Debenham, United Kingdom",64,222,66,2.0,6/18/2013,"This place is the definition of average. Wings, beer, service, laminated (sticky) menu, welcome as you walk in ... all average. It's the kind of place where no one is actually rude but the smiles seem forced.  Parking is easy enough but I would try another of the many other eateries in the area first."
Victoria C.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, CA",65,13,,1.0,5/5/2014,"Went into the restaurant and waited with no host to seat us. Finally ended up just walking up to the bartender to ask where to sit. Once we self-seated, no waiters came to give us a menu. Even after calling out, making eye contact with the servers, and politely trying to call their attention, they completely ignored us. Worst service ever. In fact, there was no service whatsoever."
Mandy C.,"Arcadia, CA",8,54,66,2.0,11/29/2015,I ordered a burger and the waiter forgot to ask me what kind of fries i want. He was also rude and not polite at all. He didn't explain the specials I asked about. He just pointed at the menu and said read it. Its on there. Really rude. Not happy at all. I would not recommend people to come here or come back ever. The only good thing here is the beer.
Jane F.,"Altadena, CA",125,57,,1.0,6/18/2012,"Now I'm not some hoity-toity gourmand. Honestly, I am not overly critical of food. I didn't go to BJs expecting any out of the ordinary cuisine for that type of chain. However, this was so far below standard that it was stupefying. I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich (sans tomato), which bore the following description : ""Lightly breaded tenderloins of chicken, fried to a crispy golden brown and served on a toasted garlic cheese French roll with honey mustard, green leaf lettuce and sliced tomatoes."" Sounds delicious, but that isn't what they brought me. The Roll : NOT a garlic cheese French roll. Plain French roll; forgivable.  Honey Mustard : A layer so thin and hard to see that the CSI folks would have a challenge detecting it. Green Leaf Lettuce : Wilted, brown corners. The Chicken : The greatest offense of all. Fried strips, that were so sparse on chicken I had to use my knife to scrap of slivers from inside the layers of their deep fried cage.  I tried to choke it down, I really did, but only consumed a quarter of it. I blame the fact that I didn't send it back on my personal shock. I figured the consolation prize would be sharing Cate T.'s whipped potatoes. She and I were mortified when we recognized that they were made from an instant powder.  Being the twit I am I allowed them to box my meal. It'll look prettier going into the nearest trash can ? The glorious Coup de grace ? The finishing fracken stoke of genius ?! An hour of vomiting. Oh that technicolor yawn of shame. I have heard that other BJ's are better. Good for them. This bitter old witch doesn't care to know."
James R.,"Odessa, TX",0,1,,5.0,7/29/2014,"awesome service, great drinks, excellent food! If u want a boring, silenced meal don't come here! expand your horizons eat at BJ's!"
Baby C.,"Kapaa, HI",201,123,22,5.0,10/20/2014,"I enjoy watching games here and I like that they have 2 happy hour times during the week. Their beer is really good and I LOVE going on tuesdays, when their wine, even bottles, are half off all day. They even have gluten free Pazookis. It doesn't get any better"
Danielle C.,"Pasadena, CA",32,6,,3.0,9/26/2012,"This place is a hit and miss for me. Sometimes the service great, but sometimes the service is horrible, even on slow nights!  The food is pretty good. And the prices are reasonable. Best part are the pizookie's. so delicious!"
Pateel C.,"Duarte, CA",237,147,11,4.0,4/29/2013,"I don't come here that often, but I've come twice with my dad in the last month, and I realized how much I love this place. I mean granted it's pizza and beer, but everything I've had has been tasty. Last time we came, the waiter was super friendly and suggested that we do the 2 for 20 deal (which they don't have all the time). You get a soup or salad each, a medium pizza to share, Â and a pazzoki to share. I think thats a pretty good deal..you have to be part of the premiere club, but that's super easy to sign up.  I know it's a little fatty, but the food is good, the service is nice, the wait isn't horrible, and it's good for groups of even just two.  P.s. Tons of TVs and they will change the channel if you ask them too (to a sports related event obviously)."
Aly S.,"Solvang, CA",149,3,1,5.0,10/10/2013,"I've come here so many times with my boyfriend and each time we've had a horrible experience. Tonight we came as a last minute meal choice and I'm so glad we did.  However I do feel bad for our server because the restaurant just double seats him and no one helped him at all. But with that being said, Jerry (tall gentleman, glasses, short dark hair) did an absolute amazing job. He was friendly, acknowledged that we did have to wait a little long, and truly showed that he cared. Jerry alone has made me want to come back to Bj's Arcadia, but we will only sit with him! He has completely changed my attitude towards this restaurant and I wish there were more servers like him. Thank you Jerry for amazing service. You were great!"
Linh T.,"San Gabriel, CA",26,95,14,4.0,7/19/2012,"I was always biased against BJ's coz the first time I tried it years ago, they screwed up my order and gave me some nasty tasting plain old cheese pizza. Half a decade later, my coworkers decided to go here for lunch I had no choice but to give it a second chance. Came in a party of 6 and was seated in a corner both with a TV on. If my boyfriend was here, he'd love it since he can watch a sports game... but for me and my coworkers... it didn't mean much. Food came out pretty fast... for my coworkers that is. I think they forgot about my order. I think BJ's just has it out against me. Waited a while and then the manager personally came out to give me my jambalaya after we had asked about my order. But.. I guess the jambalaya tasted pretty good, so it was (almost) worth the wait. Portion was huge, I took the leftovers home and it was enough for dinner. Waiter seemed okay to me... but my coworker said he was rude to her (I guess I wasn't paying attention when that happened).  So I guess overall, it was a okay experience. Way better than my first at least. Good enough to say I would come back and try some other stuff and maybe their happy hour (I'll just stay away from cheese pizzas)."
Ellen C.,"Tujunga, CA",367,374,696,3.0,3/24/2010,"Don't get me wrong...I do like this place, it's just that there are so many better places out there.  It is however a pretty good place for a ""deep dish pizza"". I like their slightly greasy thick crust...... and their Pizookie is to die for.  I usually order the BJ's Special Pizza, but thought I'd be daring and try something new.....Getting out of my shell and comfort zone!! haha  We ordered the cheeseburger pizza. I was a little scared. I didn't feel too safe having American cheese on my pizza..but it was gosh darn good.  It's great for groups and they have nice selections of HH appetizers."
