Andre N.,"Alhambra, CA",456,445,257,4.0,1/30/2011,"Not a big fan of their deep dish pizza (been to chicago and love their real thing), know that everytime I go to any BJ's. However without pizza, I still love this particular BJ's since its been remodeled. They have a good selection of beers on tap and I enjoy their ones they brew themselves. If beer is not your thing, you can always order some hard liquor, and they know how to mix.  This is also now a great place to see sports, since they have a vast amount of flat screens, so many I consider them the whores of flat screens. But the winner of the bunch is the 103 inch screen (crazy huge) overlooking the bar.  As for food, its ok, I do love their Chili and BBQ chicken sandwich for lunch, but no so much into their pizza and italian dishes. So yes I will still attend BJ's to get my beer and watch my Lakers/Clippers on the big screen."
Christine H.,"Pasadena, CA",1020,355,67,5.0,12/18/2012,"Can I just say, the Pazooki was an invention by God to keep all womenkind from starving ourselves?"
Jessica R.,"Rosemead, CA",2,6,3,5.0,11/2/2014,My husband and I are regulars here and we love it! Once in a while we'll sit in the restaurant area but for the most part we sit at the bar. Alex is ALWAYS our server (bar area)  and he is fabulous! Definitely recommend him to anyone that wants great service!
Dana P.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,57,17,3.0,12/28/2014,"Came here on a quick break from Christmas shopping.  Usually like the other locations I've been. This is probably the slowest and worst of them all. We were really hungry and ended up waiting for quite some time for a table. Even getting on orders in took a good while. After our waiter final came to take our order we were hoping to get served at least our drinks, but even that took a good 15 minutes. It probably took longer to get served food than to actually eat our meal. Although our food turned out okay I was already pretty peeved to enjoy it."
Hemang S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1346,577,433,4.0,3/22/2010,"The nighttime chill place for local students. I used to roll in with my friends for some good ROOT beer fun (pre-21) and some delicious Great White Pizza. FREE pizookie(cookie pizza covered in ice cream) on your ""birthday."" HINT HINT. Waiting staff revolves as local students quit and get hired, but lots of beer selections and $5 personal pizzas during happy hour make me a happy boy."
Mary N.,"Arcadia, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/18/2014,I was disappointed to try the house special lasagna to find it to be pre made ravioli filled cheese layered in a dish. Tasteless and in need of seasoning. I dought I will be back.
Jim T.,"Duarte, CA",297,226,41,4.0,8/26/2012,"We have been to BJs about 4 times now.  Today was our first lunch visit, a lazy Sunday afternoon.  Not too crowded a bit past noon and plenty of parking.  There is a large menu of appetizers, salads and main dishes. I am currently on a low carb diet and there were several available selections, I ended up with the chicken lettuce wraps, served with a hot mustard sauce and a light soy type of sauce.  Very delicious, however if you do not like hot mustard, stay away from it, it will clear your sinuses!  My wife got the breakfast scramble and it was large.  Bacon, eggs, cheese, avocado  tater tot type potatoes,  and toast.  She will take about 2/3rds of it for her luch tomorrow. The service was excellent, attentive but not hovering."
Emre C.,"Baltimore, MD",0,8,,1.0,5/16/2015,I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone. They don't prepare your order not the way you wanted. Consider other places and don't waste your time and your money. If I could take a star away from them I would. Unfortunately I had to give a star for this place. Yelp should find a way to fix this. This place doesn't deserve anything.
steve s.,"Monterey Park, CA",1,1,,1.0,6/23/2016,"I dont come here for the food.  My friends and I generally enjoy the atmosphere for games some apps and generous pours on drinks. However, one afternoon, my kids and I didn't want to wait the que at Souplantation, kid friendly , and I asked them if they wanted some pizza or mac n  cheese.  We crossed the street to BJ's. After being seated, had to wait 15 minutes to be served by eye rolling waitress who had been to table right next to us 3 times and never acknowledged us. I understand kids can be a pain,  but they were behaving. The place was 25% full.  She took our order and then proceeded to take orders from two newly seated orders. Expediters brought plates, obviously for chiildren, that were too hot to touch and apologized before they even made it to table. My 9 yr  old understood, but the 2 yr old not so much. My food was over cooked. I spoke to the manager, but he looked right through me. There are lots of options in this area and I won't be coming back."
Stephanie R.,"Alhambra, CA",46,60,48,2.0,6/22/2014,"The ONLY reason I gave it a two is because by dessert time, we talked to the manager and switched waitress, well we had a waitress and ended up with a good waiter. Anyways our waitress sucked. Attitude problems, we waited 20 min, no refills. The worst. She would look our way and then leave. I was there tonight 06/22/14 around 7-9p bad. I'll try to go again, I'm sure it was just her that sucked. Btw, it wasn't even busy lol"
Gigi H.,"Indianapolis, IN",1,19,42,4.0,10/14/2014,BJ's just as good here as in Indy. Nice to find consistently great food and atmosphere across the country.
Jay B.,"Pasadena, CA",1,7,,1.0,4/6/2015,"I witnessed something yesterday that made me so uncomfortable I felt compelled to share with others so I'm posting on both sites involved, even if nothing ever comes of it. I was dining at BJ's with my family for Easter Sunday (which is another reason I didn't say anything at the time) when all of a sudden the police showed up, I'm assuming to escort a group of young adults out as I had noticed a manager was speaking with them a few minutes before. It seemed like a ""0 to 100"" type deal as there wasn't anything inherently wrong with that party. I couldn't help but notice that the 2 guys were black and the ladies were Latina's, meanwhile everyone else was white. From what I could overhear the accusation was that they were loud and unruly. I was sitting within earshot and they were neither too loud nor unruly; They were, however, clearly having a good time and last I checked, that is not a crime at a sports bar. They were literally surrounded by middle aged white folk who chose to sit in the bar area next to them. Honestly, I was ashamed of my own people who judged and muscled them out. The situation became painfully uncomfortable when my children asked why this was happening. I couldn't eat another bite and watched the officers (2 head-shaved white men) and BJ's management basically B.S. and belittle the kids until they left. I hope someone out there reading this is in a position to rectify the situation although I highly doubt it. It was disgusting and disheartening in 2015 in California, I felt transported to the Cotton Belt circa 1960."
Deb T.,"Pasadena, CA",343,647,73,4.0,8/1/2012,"I was craving a Pazookie and lo, and behold, I got one at BJ's in Arcadia. The menu has changed sooo much since I was last there and they have a great lunch menu. For those with gluten allergies, GUESS WHAT! There is a gluten-free menu! The boyfriend and I came her for lunch and it was super busy! He ordered Calamari and a mini-pizza; I ordered the chicken fingers. The food was good and when I got my cookie dessert I was a happy camper. The prices are a little on the steep side, but you get what you pay for so that's always a plus. Parking is horrendous! If you don't want to circle the lot, time your visit right or find street parking (if possible)."
Joe B.,"Covina, CA",19,6,1,5.0,10/24/2015,"I went there with my brother on a Saturday & as usual they are pretty busy.  They told us the wait was 25 minutes so we went to the bar ordered a drink while we waited and it was actually 15 minutes before we got seated, which was awesome. We received very good service and the food was pretty good too.  Will come back again"
Andrew W.,"New Haven, CT",446,250,30,5.0,7/25/2010,"This place is great, for small groups and large. They have long banquet tables that you can reserve, and I've come here with parties of 20+ a few times already.  For appetizers, the avocado egg rolls are amazing, and I don't even like avocado that much. Their pastas are pretty decent for a restaurant of their kind; my dad thought the shrimp scampi was quite good. The deep dish pizzas aren't as good as Chicago's of course, but they're decent enough for a restaurant in California. The Great White pizza is probably my favorite. For dessert, if you manage to make it that far, the pizookie will definitely satisfy you. Service is not bad, although the waitress mixed up some of my party's drinks once. No biggie. Oh, and they also have a bunch of wide screen TVs, so I could watch the Lakers destroy the Celtics last season."
Diana I.,"El Monte, CA",1,56,2,4.0,2/19/2015,"Ive never had a bad experience at any BJ's restaurant but one thing I noticed is that they seemed to always rush the customer. My friend and I decided to meet up at this BJ's location so we can chat and have some lunch. The service wasn't bad, the food was great.  The waiter constantly checked up on us and was quick on the refills. But like I mentioned before, I always feel very rushed. He brought to-go boxes without us asking him to, & he brought the bill without us asking for it. I've never worked in a restaurant, so i don't know if that is normal because at any other restaurant, they usually wait until we ask. So how did he know that we weren't gonna order some more food? Or how did he know if I was even done eating?  My friend and I ignored the fact that it looked like we were being rushed out, and we stayed another hour just to finish catching up. Other than that, his service was pretty good. I'm sorry for all of the people that had negative experiences because I've been to this specific location several times and I've never encountered such things."
Bry D.,"Monrovia, CA",0,3,1,2.0,9/6/2015,My food took sooo long to come out. No one seems to want to work here. Food was very good though.
Sarah H.,"Yorba Linda, CA",2,26,3,1.0,11/16/2014,"This was by far one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever encountered. We were there for a birthday lunch and had a large party. Before we even ordered, we requested separate checks. The server said he would divvy up the checks at the end. Then he half-assedly took our order, looking bored and not writing down key details. When asked if the gluten free menu was available, he said he didn't know and then stared at us. No offer to check. The food came out 45 minutes later, and they had put cheese on my dad's burger (he's lactose Intolerant). They also took 30 minutes to bring him a new one (the rest of us were halfway done eating). He checked on us maybe once or twice in 2 hours. We ordered dessert and it took an additional 45 minutes. THEN, the waiter brought the bill--the whole very expensive bill--to one person instead of splitting it like he promised. At this point, we were fed up and just wanted to leave, so we just paid it the way it was. The grand finale? We didn't know that gratuity wasn't included (it usually is on large bills) or we would have included it (even though the whole experience sucked). The hostess brought the bill back and rudely informed us, ""Just so you know, trip is not included in this bill"". Wow. A three hour lunch  horrendous, rude service and they practically demanded that we tip. Again, we intended to tip because we aren't terrible people, but seriously? We will never go back."
Joanne T.,"Alhambra, CA",25,157,,4.0,1/26/2012,"I highly recommend making reservations if you have a party of 4 or more. Luckily, I came with just one other person and we were seated right away. This place gets BUSY FAST.  There's a cocktail bar located in the center of the restaurant, which is great for watching any type of sports game. I ordered the fish tacos, but they weren't that great. Avacado egg rolls are delicious. I think the pizzas taste better here and definitely order the pizooki with white chocolate macadamia nuts and vanilla ice cream. I don't really eat chocolate, so I eat around it and it goes great with vanilla ice cream! MMmmm. Servers are quick, which is good. The menu is huge, so you'll have to go back multiple times to see what items are best.  This place is good for young crowds or group settings."
Christine H.,"Baldwin Park, CA",71,126,256,3.0,11/24/2013,Tuscan Chicken Limone was not up to par when I ordered it this time :( there was too less sauce and still too much oil! Asked for more spinach/veggies and got the same portions! Aye aye aye!
