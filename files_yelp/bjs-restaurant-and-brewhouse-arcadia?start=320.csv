Bob P.,"Littleton, CO",3,51,5,5.0,10/6/2012,"Great Service, Dry Pizza. Went here today to celebrate my godson's football win.  Originally was going to Olive Garden next door, but the wait was 45 minutes.  BJ's seated the 6 of us right away. We all ordered different things.  I ordered the small Gourmet deep dish 5 meat pizza.  Unfortunately, it was the driest pizza I had ever tasted, and was only able to eat one slice.  We looked in vain for some evidence of sauce, but found none.  When we mentioned it to the server, I got the distinct impression that her attitude was ""too bad, so sad"".  However she must have told the manager because shortly he was at our table apologizing.  He said that they keep the sauce light unless the customer requests extra.  Believe me, there was NO sauce on the pizza.  To his credit, the manager took the pizza off the bill, without a request from us. I still give 5 stars for the great service, and my companions all liked the food they had."
Joseph S.,"Newport Beach, CA",85,199,27,4.0,5/20/2014,"Great BJ's!  The staff was friendly and attentive, as are most of the locations. The pizza met my high expectations.  Definitely will be back."
Fudge R.,"Pleasanton, CA",76,108,,4.0,6/7/2015,I've been here twice for lunch and enjoyed my meal each time. Maahi maahi tacos are very good as well as their ceaser salad and broccoli cheese soup. This is the kind of place you go to and know you will have a good satisfying meal no matter what. Service was very good each time and washrooms are quite clean.
Matthew M.,"Monrovia, CA",180,11,,4.0,8/25/2011,"+Good food +Good service +Nice Ambiance I come to this BJ's about once a week. It's one of the best places around to just enjoy a beer, talk and have some decent food.  I've never had to send anything back due to poor quality, under cooked or over cooked food.  The food is always tasty here, mostly everything is either fried or has a lot of carbs, but they've recently come out with a 500 calories and under menu, which I hear is really good. Recently, I've been coming in and getting the flat bread pizzas just so that I have enough room for the white chocolate macadamia nut Pizookie (obviously, I'm not in the business of watching my figure.)   Last night, I tried the fried artichoke hearts and the macaroni and cheese off of the new small appetizers menu and they both turned out to be pretty decent, and I would definitely order them again.   They improved on the interior design about a year ago which has definitely added to the comfort-ability of the restaurant and actually has brought in a new, nicer and quieter crowd. I've seen a lot more white collar workers come in and less trouble makers.  It seems that they have all migrated to old town Pasadena. I personally know a lot of the staff there, so my perspective of the service is going to be biased because I get treated like a friend there and not always like a customer, but from what I gather, most of the staff there are very friendly and welcoming.  The only issue that I've run into here regarding service is that occasionally, there will be an issue with the order in which the plates come out.  Every so often I come to eat with the family, we always order wings and some sort of main coarse, and there have been multiple times where the wings will either come with the meal or after it, which really defeats the purpose of an appetizer.  All in all, I love this place, but I'm not in love with it... You know what I mean?"
Nikolas H.,"South Pasadena, CA",0,28,,5.0,7/3/2014,"Another great meal with great service, this time by bright and energetic and very friendly Katie.  Love the peanut butter pizookies.  Great way to start the 4th holiday!"
Grace C.,"Brea, CA",225,721,558,4.0,4/12/2010,"The Pizzookie deserves a 5. warm right out of the oven cookie with ice cream on top?!  Their menu has changed over the years, but what can you expect with a chain restaurant. That's inevitable. My favorite sandwich used to be their bbq chicken sandwich, but they changed the bread and it just hasn't been the same since. Their pizzas are pretty decent. deep dish style.  overall, it's a place I frequent since it's rather convenient, and the food is pretty good."
Danny D.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",219,194,33,3.0,6/30/2014,"This restaurant use to be a lot better but now I feel that it has lower it's standards. The customer service was the best and so was the food now I'm sorry I can't say that anymore. I loved bringing friends here especially since they're open late, but why not save the money and cook something at home when I have to ask for the same thing more than once to the same person. Not to mention I asked someone else who I think was the manager and even the manager forgot to bring me what I asked for. And to top it off all I wanted was lemon slices for my water.."
Farynn S.,"Azusa, CA",43,44,7,5.0,4/1/2014,"Love coming here to unwind. Great food and drinks. Staff is attentive and helpful. Last visit the sun was in my eyes half way through my meal and I asked for blinds to be pulled closed. however, The blinds being closed wouldn't have helped because the sun was above the blinds. So the manager came out and apologized and offered us a new table. very satisfied with this location."
Summer S.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,681,3,4.0,9/7/2012,"This BJ's is pretty awesome. I have lost count on how many times I have frequented this establishment this past summer. Oh well! The most recent time was when we were next door at Olive Garden and couldn't stand the wait. Thus we walked right into BJ's and was seated IMMEDIATELY. The waitress wasn't super attentive but she was very friendly. She also honored a special offer that we had (since we were BJ's club members). I usually like ordering the Grilled chicken/broccoli/cheese baked potato, but this time I had their thai mango salad. It was delicious with the right amount of avocado. I also tried my BF's burger and skinny fries and it was just as good.  I also recommend their pizzas, although I haven't had any as of late.  As for the drinks: BJ's also has great berry cider, and they serve Wyder's ciders too! These are my Go-to.  As for appetizers, I recommend: the avocado eggrolls, the spinach stuffed mushrooms (although it won't be too filling), and the nachos. (but be forewarned, that is over 1000+ calories). All in all, this place is my Go to! Whether it's with the BF, or graduate school classmates, it got me through this last semester of my master's degree program with its yummilicious food and drinks. MM..."
Jack C.,"Long Beach, CA",193,195,104,4.0,5/27/2012,"BJs is a classic for me. I've been frequenting this place since high school, but the one thing that the economy, specifically the recession, has affected is the size of their free birthday pizOooOOkies. Before, way back when, it came as a full entree size, but now they shrunk it down to a mini. I'm still not gonna complain too hard on free. Those things are delicious btw. Get one with half chocolate chip and half white macadamia nut. That'll satisfy your sweet tooth ferociously. The pizzas are really where it's at. You absolutely can't go wrong with the BJ's favorite. It's deep dish and served in just that a deep dish. Others that I've tried that are also worth mentioning are the classic combo, and BBQ chicken altho the bbq chicken was a bit too tangy for me. Their salads and other appetizers are just okay. The italian sausage and basil flatbread is surprisingly good.  They have a generous selection of beers to choose from and service has always been great. If you want to catch a sports game of some sort they got tv's plasters all around the restaurant. Great spot to come with friends as the environment is generally really lively. Just be weary that the noise level can get kind of loud."
Emi K.,"Irvine, CA",193,457,262,1.0,5/17/2011,"We decided to eat dinner at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse Arcadia after Olive Garden informed us that our wait time would be approximately 40-50 minutes. Lame - that is, the wait time, but also our dining experience here which I'll get to in just a sec...  I'll keep this short and sweet & sour: mediocre food (spaghetti with marinara sauce - slightly salty and oversauced), loud ambiance (widescreen TVs blasted sporting events from every angle you turned your head), pricey ($12.95 for a bowl of cooked noodles drenched with pureed tomato sauce), and lousy service.* *Additional Notes On The Lousy Service: Our server, Jerk (ahem, Jason), failed to check on us, failed to refill our drinks, and failed to check his attitude at the door. He appeared hot and bothered when I requested lemon for my water. Maybe he was overworked. Maybe he was tired. Maybe he needs to reconsider his employment options if he's going to make customers feel bad for making reasonable and ordinary requests.  Major disappointment."
Alan K.,"Los Angeles, CA",506,1367,207,4.0,2/25/2012,"I really enjoyed the adult atmosphere of this restaurant and brew house. We came here during lunch time so to our delight, they had some wonderful inexpensive lunch specials. We got the mini pizza and side salad lunch special. Both of these plates were portioned well. The salad was actually nice and cold (just the way I like it) along with a pizza that was sort of deep dish. Also, during lunch time, their beer on tap is $3.50 which was a great deal. We ordered the Hefeweizen on tap and really made the day much more enjoyable."
Luis A.,"Rosemead, CA",0,9,,5.0,8/6/2014,"Great place for drinks and bjs pizza. Cannot go wrong with their happy hour. If you eat there, top it off with a pizookie, trust me."
Jennifer M.,"Azusa, CA",0,11,4,1.0,8/3/2015,"If I was able to give them no stars I would. Worst service I have ever had at a restaurant. I came on a Monday afternoon so this place wasn't busy at all; I'd hate to imagine how my service would have been during rush hours. They messed up on my order(yes I am aware that everyone makes mistakes) but when I have to practically chase down the server for a drink, that's where I draw the line. Plus, the server was rude and didn't even introduce himself to my family and I. I will not be coming back to this location again."
Eugene N.,"Temple City, CA",416,338,89,4.0,8/10/2011,"This used to be like my second home. My friends and I would come here twice a week just to hang out and drink beer. The service back then was pretty good then one night... a bad experience happened... please note that this was a long time ago, but I'd thought I'd share it with you guys. (It does not effect my current rating) My friends and I like to consume beer... like a lot of beer, but we're not light weights. So one night we exceeded the, what they call the maximum beer limit, so the manager stopped us from ordering more pitchers. None of us were even drunk, or even close to it! That manager was the main reason why we stopped going. Not sure how that effected their business because we used to go in with at least 15 people. So we went from going 2-4 times a week to not going at all. When we found out that manager left, we started going back again... Never forget! haha Today, it still stands as one of my preferred hang out spots even though we don't hang out as much anymore (*sigh... the good ol days...). Still I'm a fan of this BJ's"
Anthony E.,"Milton, MA",54,35,,3.0,4/4/2014,"Pretty standard fare, but decent quality. Most people in my group ordered some kind of fish (salmon, mahi-mahi) and no one seemed disappointed. I got fried fish tacos which were pretty tasty and I would definitely order again. The plus is definitely the beer. Everyone was really happy with their beer selection, I would go back just for the harvest hefeweizen or the red ale!"
Mariko B.,"Irving, TX",175,643,466,3.0,1/23/2014,"Came here late one night because it was across the street from my hotel and I didn't want IHOP or In n Out. No host when I walked up so I sat at the bar, had 2 drinks & the shrimp pasta, it was bland but I was starving. The bartender was nice, maybe I'm not that talkative but he only spoke to me when no one else was at the bar. Whatev, just a standard BJ's, not much going on here. Smelled a bit too much like a bar though, spilt liquor? Meh."
Kevin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",199,73,4,1.0,9/4/2013,"Being a chain-restaurant, I'll just make a comment on the only difference between this location and others; the service.  I came here with the girlfriend and her sister during happy hour in the middle of the week. We sat in the bar area, because that's the seating eligible for HH-prices. If it was normal hours I would have sat else where. So we get our waitress who takes our order and tries to be upbeat about it.  We get order 3 appetizers and drinks for each of us.  We get our drinks probably 10 minutes after ordering.  Normally this would not be that big of a deal except for the fact the place was near empty. What hold up is there between taking your only customers' order and bringing it to them. Our waitress was no where to be found. It was actually another server who brought us our drinks. 25 minutes later we finally get our food, again from another server. The girlfriend's sister got the endless root beer and either that was false advertisement or the waitress didn't care enough to give her a refill. It basically ended up being a 5 dollar root beer.  When all is said and done, I get the bill. I'm scanning it and the numbers don't add up. After sitting in the bar just to get the HH-pricing, the waitress rang us up at NORMAL hours and NORMAL portion prices.  We were basically served the HH portioned food but charged full price all around. I stop the waitress and I ask her what is going on. Her response basically clinched it for me, ""Oh you weren't looking at that part of the menu so I assumed you wanted the regular one"".  Working retail myself, I know that if I ever make a mistake it is my responsibility to own up to it and make amends for my mistake. Instead, this girl tries to say it was my own fault. But how could I have known the pricing until after the food and drinks were consumed?  I have never tipped less than 15% at any restaurant, no matter how poor the service is. It actually pains me when I give any less. But this was the ONE exception. I reluctantly tried to put down the normal 15% tip but my girlfriend angrily looked at me to ""tell"" me otherwise. I left like 5% and walked out the door shaking my head.  No excuses for service so bad. You weren't rushed. If you thought I meant to order the larger portion, you could have ASKED... or actually given me the normal portion if that was the case, not charge me more for less. Never again."
