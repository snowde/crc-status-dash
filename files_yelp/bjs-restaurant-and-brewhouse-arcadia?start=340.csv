Gilbert B.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,24,4,4.0,9/2/2012,"The service fast and friendly, Enjoyed the potato skins, and steak dinner. Due to it being a Holiday weekend ,we did not have to wait to be seated. With Such a large menu ,took me more time to decide what to eat, then it took them to seat us.      Great Service, Great Food, & Great Company, what more can you ask for"
Tiffany T.,"Tempe, AZ",273,76,100,3.0,2/5/2014,"came here one night with my boyfriend because the olive garden next door was way too packed. the food was okay. the service wasn't great either. the waitress wasn't that familiar with the menu and she wasn't really present unless we called another waiter for service.  the only thing i like coming here for is their pazookie! yummmm. so delicious. a plate of cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top. other than that, i'd rather eat at home."
Melissa Y.,"Temple City, CA",1,8,11,1.0,5/1/2014,"If I could give 1 star, I would. I remember why I don't come here anymore, the workers were extremely rude to me and my friends. We arrived at the bar and could not find an open place, usually servers come and ask how many and try to help us find a table but not in this case. We managed to find a table and added a chair to a 2 person table. However, once seated a server came by and rudely told us he needed to get by without saying excuse me or being polite. That just ruined my thought about this place. If they had nicer staff, then I would be back but I won't."
David B.,"San Diego, CA",45,3,,1.0,3/25/2014,"Not sure what's going on at this location. They got both my salad and main course wrong.  The worst part is, I did a curbside pick and didn't realize until I got back to my hotel."
Alison W.,"San Jose, CA",413,1590,952,4.0,11/15/2009,"BJ's is probably my favorite big chain restaurant. But not even because of the food really. I love their pizookies. And that's bad really, because it's totally something you can make on your own. It's just a giant cookie with ice cream on top. Somehow BJ's has perfected it and made it taste like bliss. Warm and soft with the right amount of gooeyness paired with the coldness of a scoop of ice cream. Ahhhh. I always step into that place with the same plan. Eat an appetizer or half my entrée and save as much room for the pizookie as possible. Since I'm usually the only one who likes to order dessert, I end up having to share with the other people in the party. Let me tell you, it hurts. But I don't want to be known as the selfish person who didn't offer to share her dessert. After everyone's had some, I happily dig in. It's one of my few indulgences.   Food-wise, I rarely go for dinner. At lunch they have specials so I stick to those. The mini one topping deep dish pizza is good and comes with soup or salad. The sliders are filling. They come with wedge cut or crispy fries. This last time I had half of a chicken sandwich with soup (clam chowder). All quite wonderful. And under $10. Strawberry lemonade is also my drink of choice. We've never had any problems with service either. A definite thumbs up all around."
Michelle H.,"Upland, CA",0,10,,5.0,5/18/2015,"Had a late dinner at this location last night.  Great service, our server was helpful and attentive.  Kept our drinks full (didn't even have to ask), and was constantly moving from table to table taking great care of all his customers.  I was very impressed with his service.  Thank you!!"
Robinson E.,"Monrovia, CA",0,3,,5.0,6/12/2015,"Went to bjs last night to watch the basketball finals, even though the game was quiet, bjs was the spot, the customer service was excellent and the appetizers like the Buffalo wings an cheese sticks was great. Will be going there again"
Kevin J.,"Mira Loma, CA",27,262,1051,4.0,1/9/2014,"this is for the happy hour menu  we got the flatbread pizza for 4 bucks, had chicken bacon and some white sauce it was really good  9/10  but it was really small but its just 4 bucks so its worth it buffalo wings was 5 bucks i think and it was pretty good, bonelss :( i want bone in! better experience, only had 4 peices!!! whaaat oh well 7/10 we got the calamari...dont ask why 2/10 it was really bad, looked NOTHIGN like the picture, it was dry and did not taste good, the manager happened to walk by our table and asked how it was and we said super bad haha and she took it off our bill quickly so that was nice but i would recomend this place, had a lot of beer on tap, lots of tvs so you can see from basically any seat"
George L.,"Fullerton, CA",23,9,,1.0,7/7/2012,"We went to the restaurant on July 4. The place was not very crowned, but the waitress looked a little bit overwhelming and slow.  She took the wrong beverage. More importantly, We saw the weird sticker or paper in the cup. If the date were not holiday, my aunty  would tip her under the standard."
Trinh L.,"Rosemead, CA",33,61,1,5.0,1/8/2014,Good food for cheap price. Only 80$ for 5 orders & good service even though it on the weekend . Would love to come back one day
April K.,"Glendale, CA",904,426,242,4.0,5/21/2011,"Loved my server Kai. He was super friendly, efficient (but didn't rush us) and got the orders perfect. Also loved the new lighter options for lunch specials. I had the 1/2 flatbread pizza with salad ($6.95), so did one of my friends, and my other friend had the tilapia lunch special. That plus a coffee (just as insanely delicious as at other BJ's with a hint of chicory), an iced tea, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream came out to $33.  WAY cheaper than I usually drop on a meal. So of course I gave Kai a fatty tip."
Mandy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",219,29,41,1.0,5/15/2013,This was definitely a below par dining experience. There were 9 of us altogether. Our server went on break shortly after taking our order; the person who took over never refilled our drinks until after we waved down another person because they had been empty for so long. My brother in law had to  cancel his wine order because she never came back with it and he was already finished with his steak. We repeatedly had to ask for refills and rarely saw any servers in our section. Terrible customer service.
Dorothy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",849,422,753,4.0,12/27/2010,"Thankfully this location recently remodeled, and restyled their beer selection! (I love beer, but I just cannot seem to like any of the BJ's brews...) I'm very happy to say that they have added more good draft selections to their beer offerings!! AND BJ's may have the best happy hour food of all time. That is the sole reason it is a staple happy hour place for me and my sports-loving boyfriend. We love to stake out spots during NBA Finals or MNF or just a regular old Wednesday after work. We think BJ's has the best chicken wings around. To accompany those amazing wings, we vary between a mini favorite pizza, nachos, or my new fav on HH - pork sliders. (You GOTTA try those - with the pulled pork and onion ring strings... OOH WEE!) I also love that their HH goes until 7:00 p.m. weekdays. It can get pretty crowded sometimes, but just try to get there ASAP before 7, and you should have a wonderful experience!"
Jireh H.,"Monterey, CA",1049,365,1472,2.0,1/22/2011,"Summary: 1. Food sucks. 2. Service sucks. 3. The wait for a table sucks. 4. Crowd during games are fun. 5. Drinks, well Jeremiah Red, win! Detailed: I'm going to try to be fair in this review but honestly, what is the hype with this place? The last three times I visited this with friends, I could only wonder why I was stupid enough to actually give this place the three visits. 1. 30 minutes to get a table. I'm not complaining but fine, at least let the experience be worth it. 2. 15 minutes without any sign that our server was alive. 3. 20 minutes for our food to finally arrive after our server was resurrected from AWOL. 10 minutes to get her attention that two out of our six orders was wrong. 4. 20 minutes to get the last two orders right. In the meantime, we were wondering what crap was actually served to us. Never tasted anything this terrible...overcook night? Fine, I'll bite my tongue. 5. Jeremiah Red preached serenity into our hearts. 6. Watching Lakers win the game, well, WIN? (The crowd was nuts.) Anyways, next time I ever come here with friends, we'll stay at the bar. Food and service here sucks so bad, I'm wondering why I even bother to wait 30 minutes on a game night. I guess my friends and I have the obsession with Jeremiah Red to keep our tails between our legs to come back again for another night of pathetic service. GO LAKERS!"
Ping G.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,17,41,1.0,12/22/2012,We made a reservation over the phone for our party of 25 and when we got there the hostess wouldn't seat us so we went elsewhere.
Michael C.,"Rialto, CA",1,10,,5.0,4/2/2014,"I have always loved BJ's. They have decent customer service at this location, but the food is spectacular (as per always). The best part of this restraunt is how empty it was! My friends and I came in on a Friday night and it was so calm it was amazing."
Maggie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,35,8,5.0,1/12/2014,"Greaaat Customer service from start to end ! Everyone was smiling and very polite ... I had a bad experience at the Olive Garden next door to them and thats how I ended up here, which was the best thing my boyfriend and I could've done. FOOD WAS GREAT ! I highly recommend the boneless buffalo wings with ranch , they have the perfect taste and go great with a Blonde Beer... Stuffed mushrooms were very good as well ... Great Customer Service , Great Food and two happy customers that will definitely be going back soon !"
Eric B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",2129,5344,4760,4.0,10/19/2008,"3.5 Stars (Rounded Up) This BJ's is across the street from the Embassy Suites where I was staying.  After I checked into the hotel and called Gayle, I wandered over and sat in the bar to watch the Red Sox pull out an 8-7 victory over the Rays.  Great game, but ultimately not enough to get Boston into the World Series again. Both the beer and the pesto appetizer pizza were yummy, the prices were reasonable, and the service was excellent.  This place was a good solid choice and would gladly come here again."
Jennifer J.,"Fullerton, CA",190,245,241,4.0,9/11/2010,"Hungry for BJs No, not that kind, you sicko. Oh.em.gee, need food. Order big sandwich. Shove into mouth like caveman. Oh.em.gee, so full. Yum yum pizookie. Willing to eat without spoon. Cookie and ice cream. Haikus are easy. But sometimes they don't make sense. Refrigerator."
Carol H.,"Temple City, CA",1,48,18,5.0,3/1/2013,"My 5 star rating is for our server, Eric DeMond!  I tried to write a review on the restaurant website, but the website was not easy to work with.  So I am writing on Yelp.  My husband and I eat at BJ's Arcadia every week.  Tonight was the first time we had Eric DeMond served us.  He is by far the BEST server!  We spent 7 times more money at the Parkway Grill Restaurant in Pasadena 2 weeks ago, but the service was not as good as the service we received tonight from Eric at BJ's Arcadia.  I hope someone from the restaurant will see this post and let the BJ's restaurant management know about this valuable employee!"
