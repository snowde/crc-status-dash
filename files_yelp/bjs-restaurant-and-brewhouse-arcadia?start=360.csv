Aaron F.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",215,424,,3.0,7/14/2011,"This is a decent B.J's with much better service than the other ones I have been to. I was sat almost immediately for lunch with some clients and had no problems. Our server was pretty hot so I was happy :) All I got was a salad which was good but not great. I usually don't have salad but wanted to try it out here, I really wouldn't recommend it. Everything else I probably have had at other locations.  Parking sucks at lunch, badly. good luck finding a spot."
Jeff C.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,8,,3.0,3/27/2014,"Went there for lunch yesterday we sat down 10 to 15 mins later we were asked what we would like to drink, we were ready to order by then.  35 minutes later the waitress comes over to tell us manager will be over shortly. Manger come's over and say's food was still not ready but she would bring it to use right away. Now it has been 45 mins our food comes, my personal pizza looks like a frozen pizza and was cold and the cheese wasn't fully melted. I do not recommend eating at BJ'S on Huntington Ave. Arcadia service and quality of food were horrible. I changed my Star rating after I was contacted by two different managers to make the problem better."
Julius G.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,300,74,2.0,10/30/2013,"My grilled chicken was fishy , they must have not cleaned the grill prior to cooking."
Joe G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,,2.0,3/19/2015,"Only two stars because of the pazookie.  The pizza was absolutely terrible.  I had the deep dish and was sorely disappointed.  I left feeling uncomfortably full, but not satisfied.  The food was over processed and un-inventive. I would recommend trying your luck elsewhere. The venue is ok and the service was prompt and friendly."
Patrick P.,"Monrovia, CA",160,460,621,4.0,2/27/2011,"[Hold on, I have to wait 'till my cousins stop laughing at the name of this place... Okay, ready now.] Came here on a Friday evening, with the skies pouring down outside. Parking is always awful here around this time, and the rain didn't help the situation. There was a line of people waiting to be seated. Our party of 3 were told that the wait would be 30 minutes, but then we ended up only having to wait perhaps 10. The ambiance of this place is loud. Can hardly hear yourself think. They have a lot of big screen TVs... too bad you can't hear any of it. There have been times when I've come here and just got an okay experience, but this time around... I ordered the California Burger. The traditional buns are replaced with garlic toast. Inside is a half-pound Angus patty with avocado, green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise and ranch dressing. And while there felt like there was something missing that could have made it over-the-top epicness (perhaps something as simple as lettuce?), it was still rather awesome. I love this burger. I had their strawberry lemonade. I tend to order this drink a lot at different places. It was okay, but still doesn't beat Red Robin's version with their awesome twirly cup and bits of strawberries inside. Their famous Pizookie, a giant cookie topped with vanilla ice cream, is too much for one person. I've only had it once, and dare not to try it again. Perhaps if you're with a large party... The next time I crave their California Burger, I may consider doing their Curbside Take Out. Enjoy the burger without the hassles of waiting and the loudness."
Kirsti E.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,33,,4.0,3/11/2014,"BJs is delicious. My group at work comes here all the time for birthdays or beer during lunch. My only complaint is that every time we come someone's order gets messed up, it's not usually a big deal because everything is good here. Thanks for the consistently good grub!"
Nick V.,"Sierra Madre, CA",41,160,32,3.0,2/9/2011,"Foods great, if it wasnt for bad service it would be a 4 or a 5 (lets call it 4 1/2)  But our waiter completely forgot about us, i read his lips as someone reminded him he was our waiter he said (oh shit i forgot about them) (his names devon)  Im not sure but our guess was that they put all the shity waiters for lunch hours.   The food on the otherhand was pretty legit.  Do yourself a favor and try either the soup, brocolii and cheese is as good as it gets, or tomato soup.   Chicken fingers and fries were amazing....GET THE BUFFALO SAUCE it was a 10/10.   Summary for lazy people :  Food = Good.  Service = Bad. Devon sucks"
Josh P.,"Los Angeles, CA",146,36,22,4.0,12/3/2010,"I got the porkchops and they were absolutely delectable. They were moist, flavorful, and the baked apples that came with it were the note that put it over the top. The mashed potatoes on the other hand were dry, practically flavorless, and nothing (not even a pat of butter) came with them. They were literally hard to swallow. The beer here has won many awards, and I can see why. My wife had the hef, and I had the red. Both were so amazing that if we weren't driving we would have ordered a pitcher of each. It's a cozy atmosphere and the food is better than almost every chain restaurant I've been to so I would definitely recommend it."
Vickie T.,"Arcadia, CA",192,332,344,1.0,5/7/2011,"Summary:  1. Food sucks.  2. Big TVs 3. Average drinks.  Oh where do I even begin... Let's see, the Jambalaya was unbelievably salty but the saltiness was topped by its Bacon Pizza. I took one bite and then I spitted it out. Its saltiness was beyond bitter, beyond belief. At one point my friend handed me a slice with lots and lots of cheese on it and said ""Try this piece, the cheese might covered the salt a bit""...  Then came the Spaghetti... it wasn't fully cooked. The noodles were powdery and hard. We returned the dish to eventually experience the same thing with the newly cooked one. I think it at least deserves one star because the bar was okay. I enjoyed watching the Lakers game on its 60"" plasma  TV mounted above the bar while sipping on a glass of ""Strawberry Splash"". It is a great restaurant for friends' get-together. That was before we sat down and ordered the food though...  ."
Fawn D.,"Los Angeles, CA",233,232,72,3.0,6/8/2013,waitress was nice but please get the orders correct next time. Pizookies are always on point.
Jay C.,"Los Angeles, CA",274,328,791,2.0,4/29/2011,The one in Chino is waaaay better.  Go there if you can.  Our pizza came soggy.  Completely disappointed. Service was excellent.
Michael C.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,112,62,4.0,1/13/2011,"When my husband and I went here for dinner I ordered their Angus Pot Roast Sandwich which is one of the items featured on their 'Knife & Fork Sandwiches' menu; amazing. The pot roast was cooked to perfection then covered in a hearty mushroom gravy along with their white cheddar mashed potatoes all on a fresh French roll. Whats not to love? To drink, I had their Harvest Hefeweizen. I will be going back for this beer alone. The service was fantastic, the food was awesome and the beer, heavenly."
Denny V.,"Cerritos, CA",47,104,97,5.0,12/21/2010,"This is my first time ever trying BJ's!. I know, i'm late...i've been living under a rock, okay? :)...anyways, I came here for a birthday dinner. The inside was very neatly decorated. The staff was very friendly. And the waiter was for sure a A rating. Everytime, we needed a refill, he will help us. I tried the New Orleans Jambayala, (first time trying jambayala as well). and wow so much flavor. I would go back just to have that dish again. My girlfriend had the grilled porkchop, and i never tasted so much flavor inside before. I tried before on pork lion and failed! so i know how hard it is to get flavor inside. but anyways, i had a great experience, despite that i went during the raining week of southern california. I would come back here again. Price wise...the entrees are like any other places....$10-15 for dinners.. Drinks $2-4 Btw, I tried the pazookie....yummy! hot cookie + ice cream....  enough...u go try it!"
Lauren L.,"San Francisco, CA",65,387,6,3.0,3/20/2011,"Well, we all know this place is average.  Just stating a fact.  Good for big groups & parties. Not good if you're looking for the most delicious food.  Yesterday, I came to this location with my sister for lunch, and it just affirmed my belief that it's simply a mediocre restaurant at best. Yeah, it's fun for large groups on Friday or Saturday nights because of the loud, buzzing ambiance. But negative points for the food. My Caesar salad was drenched in dressing. And that's an understatement -- I could barely see the green lettuce. Yes, it had that much dressing. Ewes. Anyways, i've been to quite a few BJ's restaurants all throughout California, and I must say they need some sort of quality control. The BJ's in Huntington Beach is much better than the one in Arcadia in terms of salads, sandwiches, and main entrees. Trust me, it is. They need to prepare the food with more care at the Arcadia location, that's all i'm saying.  Well, if you have a large group and you have nowhere to go, i'd come here. If all fails, the Pizookies are good."
Eric R.,"Whittier, CA",94,406,19,4.0,3/11/2013,"It's BJ's, consistently friendly service in my experience. Good selection of beers. Good food."
Mike M.,"Richland, WA",3,16,4,1.0,8/19/2013,I travel all over the US and this is the second and last time I come to this place. No WiFi means I can't connect while on the road. While there the other people at the bar also chimed in there frustration along with the work staff. I was a little vocal and the management at this facility should be banned from the Internet for there ignorance. I'll never go here again. Staff was courteous.
G W.,"Manassas, VA",350,478,215,4.0,9/7/2012,"Good service tasty beers. Forgot to get the Pazookie (damn), but drinks and apps were money. Mushroom caps and combo platter was tasty. Oktoberfest brew was money!"
Cindy P.,"El Monte, CA",82,31,3,4.0,5/5/2013,"this location is excellent.  Great customer service, the timing is right and the dishes are delicious.  Variety of things to choose from.  This location is way better than the Montebello location.  The pizokee is yummi"
Kris K.,"Fairfax, VA",13,48,,4.0,7/9/2013,A chain that holds a special place in my heart for my younger brother and me. It was the first place we visited in California after driving across the country for his big move. We ate there the first night and the night before I flew back to DC. *tear* Great food and drinks. The chocolate chip pizzookie was a nice finish to our meal as well.
Linda E.,"Covina, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/4/2015,"My friend and I stopped in for lunch, I ordered Avocado Egg Rolls, They tasted bad, when I opened one up the Avocados were rotten trying to be disguised with a few fresh ones, I sent it back and got another order which were a little less rotten, sent it back and got a too salty pizza which I just ate, by that time my friend was done with her lunch and waiting for me . The manager offered us nothing for our trouble!"
