Patty A.,"Los Angeles, CA",356,191,36,4.0,2/25/2013,"Always a fan of BJ's! It was a little loud (probably because the Oscars were on) but all in all, I had a good experience. We actually ordered our food to go because I was so sick. Our server was nice and boxed it up right away for us."
Starr G.,"South Pasadena, CA",20,6,,1.0,5/6/2014,"My experience with one of the closing managers on 5/5/14 was a disappointment. The manager had the worst attitude I've ever experienced at a restaurant. My sister and I ordered for curbside a little after 10pm. The manager took our order and told us to call the curbside number when we got to the restaurant. We arrived at Bjs in Arcadia and called the curbside number. She told us that she forgot to mention that curbside ends at 9pm and we need to come inside. My sister and I decided to drive to Arcadia solely for the fact that they offer curbside since her son had fallen asleep in the car. The Pasadena location is within closer proximity to our house, we would've went there to pick up food if she had remembered to mention the curbside hours when we called. Ultimately, driving to this location served no point as the manager who we spoke to ""forgot"" to mention curbside hours were until 9pm considering we spoke and placed the order after 10pm, which is over an hour later. She did not consider to call us back either to let us know. In regards to our food, our order of grilled chicken pasta, the manager refused to pack a container of shredded Parmesan cheese, instead she gave Parmesan packets for pizza and told us ""we don't do that here."" I have been to this location before and mentioned that I did not have problems with receiving shredded cheese with my order before. She responded, ""I'm sorry but employees were not suppose to serve shredded cheese."" Apparently a small ramekin of shredded cheese will not be given under any circumstance, she did not offer any option except telling us no. ALSO, two sodas were ordered with no ice but she failed to get that done correctly. ""No ice"" was printed on the sticker-label when we picked up our food, however she still put ice in both drinks and they tasted diluted. On the phone she sarcastically responded to me with ""uh huh"" and ""right"" after every sentence I spoke. Her communication skills are lacking and her attitude is most inadequate for a management position as she was a poor representation for Bjs in Arcadia. Her customer service was the worst we have ever experienced at a restaurant."
Mary S.,"Burbank, CA",0,32,11,5.0,10/16/2014,We came for dinner. My son ordered the shrimp scampi. Shrimp were good but the pasta was overcooked n kinda not good. Our server was so awesome my son did not want to complain. (I think he thought it would reflect on the server). I told the server and the manager was so nice and totally professional. Amazing customer service!! My clam chowder was really good and so was the pear salad. I gave a 5 because when the staff try to do whatever they can to make things right it makes you want to return.
Nancy Q.,"Alhambra, CA",181,288,665,4.0,4/12/2011,"good, way better than Olive Garden's wait time and service. The host at BJ even offered to bring back the O.G. pager I had in hand.., lol This food is consistent in taste, service good, parking sucks... everything else here is fine."
Vivian C.,"Arcadia, CA",70,9,,2.0,10/2/2010,"if you r thinking about going to Bjs on a Saturday night, you will not like it!!!!  The food are pretty good!  the service was really bad!!!!!!  the manager's attitude is really mean....  yeah , we are young girls but we are ur costumers okay?  they treat us not very kindly  i don't now how come there so many people going there  BTW IF you want to celebrate ur bday there, u will REGRET !"
Suzanne S.,"Glendora, CA",0,29,1,4.0,11/12/2013,"The food and the service are great. Although the Saturday need to wait a longer period, however, it is definitely better that the neighbor Olive Garden than at least one hour of wait time during the weekend."
Ben K.,"New York, NY",29,306,2,3.0,11/21/2010,"Considering what is available in the immediate area, this almost deserves 3 stars - though in a more populated area we'd be down around 2. Classic American sports bar style food, executed fine, and priced commensurate with similar places in LA. The house beers are reasonably good, though nothing to drive out of the way for.  The day I was there, our server was so scattered I'm shocked we got anything. Nearly every order was slightly wrong, delayed or handed to the wrong person. That said, the place was nearly 1/4 full, so I'm sure they were super busy."
JC W.,"Arcadia, CA",1,59,3,5.0,7/5/2012,"We been here 8-9 times with relatives and friends to watch the games. Their burgers are really delicious and juicy!! but since this is a chain restaurant and brewery, I wouldn't order anything too difficult from this restaurant, like filet mignon or even pastas. I like the environment and good service is always in. Foods I tried:  pizzas- 3/5 ahi salad-  4/5 but tiny proportions. (they want to starve me?) burgers- 5/5 to die for! Very juicy meat! kids menu- all ok. Clam chowder- salty We almost always had pleasant service."
Ven R.,"Glendale, CA",10,24,3,4.0,6/29/2013,"Absolutely love this place, Was my first time coming here. (been to the one in modesto but one time). Anywho came with a friend. Great service. Great drinks. The food was amazing. I will most definitely come here again. That is for sure."
Patrick M.,"Monrovia, CA",11,232,12,4.0,12/15/2012,It's BJ's: Great beer to go with their food. I usually sit at the bar (it's full service) and get a few beers and an appetizer. I like coming here instead of going to some of the dive bars in the area.
Kendra F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",45,10,,5.0,10/18/2014,"This is the best BJ's!  We had a group of 40 cheerleaders who were tired and hungry.  We were coming from Hollywood, and I called ahead to see if they could accommodate our big party with such short notice.  We had the pleasure of speaking with the manager Latricia who was pleasant and welcoming.  She explained that she would do her best to seat our party as quickly as possible and to come on in.  When we got there, our party had shrunk down to only 20, but they had enough seating ready for the 40 and assigned several experienced servers to take our orders.  From the moment we walked in, our service was superb.  From the manager, to the hostesses, and waiters/waitresses...they were friendly, patient, and fast on their feet. They stayed one step ahead the entire time.  Our drink glasses stayed full, our orders were taken in a timely manner, and our food came out quickly and all at once.  This is one of the best experiences we have experienced at a BJ's.  We will definitely be back!!!' Thank you!  A+++++"
Hayley E.,"Arcadia, CA",3,26,,3.0,5/25/2013,"The food was delicious.. I mean you can NEVER go wrong with a pazookie, but at this particular BJ's I felt our waitress constantly went to other tables and served them before us even after we had already ordered before them. Maybe it was just the waitress or maybe she was just having an off night, but this particular waitress was slow and not very efficient! I might go to a different BJ's next time I crave a pazookie!"
Deanna A.,"Crofton, MD",61,55,37,3.0,12/30/2010,"I'm strictly writing this review on their new menu item.  Like many other yelpers Bj's pizza is amazing and what I normally get. Well I wanted to try to get something new I had a gift card and figured why not......  Well I was very disappointed I tried the new Tuscan Chicken Limon Pasta. It sounded really good sun dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, lemon butter and garlic. Well I did not taste any lemon at all, the pasta noodles were really dry and the chicken was a bit mushy since it's breaded. I actually added lemon and some other ingredients just to make it more saucy. I really did have high hopes for this dish. Maybe it was my fault for ordering it to go but normally pasta is not a dad thing for takeout.  This is one dish I will not be trying again...  Stick with their pizza and beer you can't go wrong!"
Jacqueline C.,"Arcadia, CA",454,69,171,4.0,11/28/2013,"This is another chain restaurant I don't mind going to. They've got a great variety of food and they've got good beers. They even serve a FRAMBOISE. Not many places do around here so that's a plus! A repeat plate for me is the california burger but I get it with a turkey patty + a side of ranch and I like the shoestring fries because they're always delicious and nice & crisp on the outside! Their pizzas are pretty good but if you are an advocate fan of thin crust pizza I would recommend not to get it...their pizzas are a deep dish pizza with lots and lots of bread. They also have some good ""small bites"" that are inexpensive and you could get two or three and it'd be a nice portioned meal. Their stuffed mushrooms are decent...a little on the bland side because the mushrooms aren't seasoned all that much, their friend wontons are good (especially their buffalo and asian ones), their mac and cheese has got some bacon in it...also decent...a little on the bland side, and their fried artichoke which I think is the best out of all of them. The artichokes are perfectly fried and the sauce does it a good solid. & I would DEFINITELY recommend getting a pizookie...no other restaurant has it and they have a few different flavors. You can even get a half and half of two flavors you like!! It always comes out hot and the cookie is cooked to perfection and its warm ooey gooeyness marries well with their ice cream!"
Stuart S.,"El Monte, CA",217,416,53,4.0,9/27/2012,"Typical BJ's fare and pricing.  This place gest packed...it is a great business.  Avoid their mozzarella cheese sticks -- they are pretty bad.  The pizza is really tasty, and their craft beer is very good.  Enjoy!"
Tiffany L.,"Temple City, CA",82,163,111,4.0,10/22/2012,I looooove BJs!! Especially their lung specials. And their pizza. And pasta. Woohoo :)
Priscilla C.,"San Gabriel, CA",2,38,,3.0,6/19/2011,"Good place for large groups, lots of shareable items. Prices are debatable---some stuff isn't worth the cost. I usually head over here for some appetizers and drinks---their lettuce wraps are pretty good. I don't do many entrees here---I used to, but they just weren't leaving the greatest taste in my mouth and hated paying for something that was just mediocre at best. Their pizzas are okay, their salads are meh--not a huge fan of their sandwiches. Their big ass baked potatoes aren't TOO disappointing but I do love their pizookies! Damn those cookies.  Not my first choice when it comes to lunch/dinner but if I'm around the area and can't make up my mind, I end up here. Their drinks aren't too bad either, FYI. Oh and the staff is 50/50...some of them are pretty awesome and some of them are just big strugglers."
Lisa E.,"Monrovia, CA",17,8,1,1.0,11/12/2014,Within the past 6 months both my daughter and I have gotten sick after eating atv the Arcadia location. Not going back!
Lisa L.,"Monrovia, CA",12,218,8,2.0,2/11/2012,"We haven't been here for quite a while, so we decided to come back. We were very disappointed. The wait was long about a half an hour, and when the time came they didn't have the right table. We didn't want to wait another half hour so we settled for that table. My mom was with us and was in a wheelchair, it didn't fit at our table, so she had to get up and sit in the booth, it was difficult. The service was very long, the tea wasn't good, and the food was average. I don't what they fry their food with, but it leaves a bad aftertaste. Mental note: don't eat anything fried there. We should get the baked potato next time."
Bianca N.,"Pasadena, CA",2,10,,5.0,7/29/2014,My boyfriend and I were just passing through town for a quick bite and didn't expect much. Our server was Kevin and he was exceptional. We appreciate his attention and eagerness to make his guests happy. Definitely coming back.
