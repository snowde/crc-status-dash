Ric R.,"South East LA, Los Angeles, CA",17,5,5,1.0,4/29/2017,"Horrible service! Our waitress left right after taking our order and never brought a drink that we ordered, I ordered the California chicken club and was brought to me w stale fries! Waited for someone to come by and notify them but no one came I had to get up and look for the manager, told him about the drink and stale fries and he sent someone over w fresh fries and the missing drink, I then saw our original waitress leaving the restaurant and still waited a while before someone came to refill the drinks. Manager didn't seem to care much. This may have to due w the fact that we got seated way in the back by the restrooms and in a corner. Will not visit this location ever again!!"
gabriel m.,"San Gabriel, CA",25,20,6,1.0,12/8/2016,"I have know idea where to start. First off the greeter in the front was really snobby and couldn't even muster out simple words as ""hello, welcome"" she instead greeted us with a ""oh party of two"", really!!!!!!! That should've turned us away heading for the front door exit but it didn't.  2nd we must of had like 4 different people waiting on us made it confusing on who to ask for refills, oh! Yes we had to ask for refills.... I could go on and on. As my dad would say ""long story short"" stay away from here"
Jenelle L.,"Arcadia, CA",202,2,2,3.0,10/19/2016,"Service was.. below average. It was somewhat understandable because it was close to closing time at a chain restaurant.  The restaurant was generally empty, but we stood at the door waiting to get seated since nobody was at the podium. Once we got to our table our waiter introduced himself and got us water. My water had little chili and pepper flakes in them, so I complained and got a new cup of water.  We ordered garlic parmesan traditional wings and a regular chocolate chunk cookie. The wings were good, but the pizookie was amaaaazing! The waiter did a good job of timing when to bring out the pizookie--right when we were finishing the last two wings. The cookie was warm and gooey, and the ice cream was still freshly placed on top. Definitely made up for the bad service earlier.  Definitely a good spot for cheap and good late night munchies."
AP H.,"Temple City, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/21/2017,"I am extremely disappointed with my recent take-out order at Arcadia BJ's for three reasons. First of all, the order was not ready when I showed up 10 minutes after the estimated ready time.  This is not the first time that the order was late and I intentionally showed up 10 min later.  But it was not ready. Secondly, I had to unfortunately wait even longer because the host had to get an approval from the manager for the ""Monday half off pizza"" offer. This promotion has been running on and off for a while and ALWAYS the host/hostess would try to charge me the full price unless I mentioned the offer.  Then they would get manager's approval.  As a customer I feel that BJ's does not really want to offer this promotion and instead trying to get away with it when possible. Thirdly, I ordered a half & half specialty pizza with BBQ chicken and BJ's favorite.  The BBQ chicken side was fine but the other half has only cheese and tomato, NO housemade meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers, black olives or white onions.  So we actually only got half a pizza! Wow, what an disappointment! I have sent a message to the manager and got no response yet.I see in the news that it has been tough for BJ's and other chains in terms of business and this is not helping at all."
Salma W.,"Arcadia, CA",142,34,73,5.0,3/22/2017,Best vegetable pizza! Service was great and fast. Pizza was just made fresh with fresh vegetables. I love it :)  If you just want to go out for dinner with friends or yourself BJ's is perfect place to go.
Cami N.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",14,11,7,5.0,8/1/2017,"Always good service, Plenty of food choices and love using the bjs app with discounts and specials. This is definitely a go to for my family and I."
Bert A.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/1/2017,Service is horrible. We waited for 45 minutes for food that is in a close race with Mc Donald's. No wonder they sell alcohol.
Clayton H.,"San Gabriel, CA",10,88,1299,4.0,2/12/2017,I haven't been here at BJs for quite a while. Coming here to celebrate for my friend's bday. I ordered the clam chowder in sourdough bread. it's really good. the sourdough bread is soft inside and crispy outside. great combination.  Thick bread pizza is always good. Love their dessert Pizookie with ice cream.
Jonathan S.,"San Jose, CA",15,65,31,4.0,12/21/2016,"Lived the ginger infused ipa.  The cheddar cheese mashed potatoes was good. So was the broccoli cheddar soup. They cooked my top sirloin to perfection,  MR. The parmesan shrimp was not to my taste. I probably should have had the crispy shrimp instead. Great service."
Robert E.,"West Covina, CA",54,14,,1.0,6/24/2017,"This location has terrible service. One night my girlfriend and I put our names down to be seated. We noticed that people who came after us were being seated before us. I talked to the hostesses and she assured me we were next that our table was being cleared up. We sat down and a family of 4 walks in and they got seated right away. I asked to talk to the manager and she basically ignored us and walked away. We finally got seated and the server was really apologetic. He offered us a free pazookie. I highly suggest you don't come to this bjs. Besides the nice server, the rest of the service sucked!"
Sonlay V.,"Southern California, CA",221,917,283,4.0,5/2/2017,"Typical BJ's joint. Satisfactory for beer drinkers, pizza lovers, and individuals who just want to watch a game without their nagging family member behind them."
Stella L.,"Monrovia, CA",423,444,1956,4.0,8/10/2015,"My 2nd visit and I had a great dinner here at BJ. We came on Friday evening and had to wait for at least 1/2 hr but the wait is worth it. Great ambience, service, food, wine and company!  ~ Ordered Baby Back Ribs, ribs has a very nice smoked flavor and BBQ sauce for the meat complement the ribs really well.  ~ California Club Flat Bread looks like pizza but it is pretty good too ~ Chicken Wings is normal, nothing to rave about  ~ Parmesan Crusted Chicken is covered with a layer of crispy crust. Not too bad but not a fan of it.  ~ Usually I came here for the draft beer but this time we tried white wine and it's really good."
Judy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,27,164,3.0,2/15/2017,"Food came out at a decent time, but the service was super slow. Took forever to get a server to take our order and he only came to check on us once. Same slow service getting the check. Surprising since it wasn't even crowded on a Wed evening."
Jassy G.,"Pasadena, CA",3,75,13,5.0,6/17/2017,"I loved everything about this place. This was my first time coming to this restaurant. We were celebrating two graduation and let me just say my first time here was a great experience. Shea was awesome he came and greeted my family and said congratulations to those who graduated and on top of that the customer service was amazing. We had two girls helping out tables but unfortunately I only got one name which was Elizabeth. Elizabeth and the other waitress went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect. Mind you we had a huge party (24 people). I just want to say thank you very much for making my first time there a great one, the food was great, customer service was great, I just wish people can take notes on you guys the staff are amazing here. I will be back!!!!"
Doreece C.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",5,10,6,5.0,6/17/2017,If I could give this place 10 stars I would. Omg today we went here to celebrate my brothers graduation we had 27 people and our waitresses were amazing Elizabeth was one of them and she made sure no one cup was every empty if we needed anything she was right there this young lady was amazing as soon a new guest walked in she would asked them what they would like to drink. The other young lady I didn't get her name but she was amazing as well they went above and beyond what we could of asked for. My experience was beyond what we could of asked for it made it easy for us to enjoy that moment of my little brother graduating college just that much better. Thank you sooooo much we will definitely be back
Shelly A.,"Pasadena, CA",15,41,346,5.0,5/22/2017,"Great service!!! I asked for a booth that has a charger and the front host did a great effort to find me and my friends a booth with a outlet. Thank you to the front host Crystal, you did an amazing job!"
Josh R.,"Duarte, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/13/2017,This place has the worst service ever. Took them About 30 minutes to come back and ask for refills. And when they brought the food the bread on our burgers were so crunchy. On top of that all the waiters would just walk past us with a bad attitude. I would not recommend this place at all!!!
Nana W.,"Arcadia, CA",145,11,32,4.0,1/2/2017,Had my new year's day late dinner here. We arrived around almost 11pm and the place was packed. We had to wait 5 minutes to get a table. The server was very nice and the food is always tasty. Especially my favorite pazokies!
Aura M.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",1023,321,2120,4.0,1/12/2016,"This is the Bj's I frequent the most. I always have a great experience here, good customer service and a large drinks selection. There's always a nice atmosphere. I noticed today that their menu looks like a magazine, so BIG. You could get a little bit overwhelmed but still a good choice."
Mark H.,"Riverside, CA",2,47,,4.0,5/24/2017,Good selection of beer except Coors lite. Their amber was almost as good. Service was efficient and friendly. He pointed out a large pizza was on sale half price so it was actually cheaper than a medium. Pizza tasted very good as did the stuffed mushrooms. Our only complaint was it has a loud atmosphere and it was hard to talk.
