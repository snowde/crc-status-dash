Jonathan C.,"San Gabriel, CA",42,250,140,4.0,7/12/2010,"One word: pizookie! Either a pizookie trio or a good ol' regular sized pizookie, deliciousness is located at BJ's.  Good: Great service, cleanliness, and great food. Bad: Parking and lines can get bad here. Final: Pizookie...yum!"
Frank A.,"San Diego, CA",0,18,8,5.0,12/17/2012,"Always a great pick for lunch! Today I had the pleasure of being served by Keith A. I ordered a Ceasar salad, requested no croutons. The salad arrived with the unordered croutons and Keith stepped up for the mistake and offered a free bowl of soup after apologizing for the misstep. He had a great attitude and is big on customer service."
Darlene Q.,"Temple City, CA",15,241,58,5.0,10/24/2010,"Service is always great here. Their food portions are worth the price. I always like their desserts. I use to only order the pizookie, but now I like their mini dessert to try different items. The service here is a lot better than Montebellow. To not have to wait for seating just go into your app for BJ'S and put down your name and time you are showing up.  Calling is OK too,  but if they day they're not busy and you can just walk in,  I would make a time online because when we walked in the lace bad a lot of people waiting. I'm glad I went into my app."
James T.,"Arcadia, CA",2844,275,2520,4.0,6/27/2011,"I like BJ's....  If your feeling pizza you can never go wrong with the Great White.  They have this new dinner entre, oven roasted talapia topped with tomato olive and served with rice pilaf and baby greens.  I would ask the fish to be prepared medium rare so the fish will not come out dry.  This plate has less than 500 calories btw.  Jeremiah RED!!  Enjoy."
Vanessa L.,"Los Angeles, CA",194,54,161,4.0,8/29/2010,"The food here is always good- I've never had anything that I didn't like.  My two favorites here are the BBQ chicken pizza and just a plain cheese pizza with tomatoes. The appetizer sampler is also fantastic. I'm not going to lie, I think the BBQ chicken pizza here is better than the BBQ chicken pizza at CPK. Ok...hold the eggs...BEFORE you throw them at me, let me just say that I think what sets the BBQ pizza apart from CPK's here is the fact that they have stewed tomatoes on theirs. I think what attracts me is the sweetness of the tomatoes because I feel that it complements the rest of the flavors very well. I'm totally fine with CPK's version, this just seems like a different but more delicious twist. (Well, I guess it's not really much of a twist since the only thing different about it is the tomatoes.) The pizookies are good- I like the Ghirardelli Chocolate one, even though sometimes it can be a little bit too rich. Sometimes, service can be a little bit slow when the restaurant is jam packed and the quality goes down a tad. I once came at 11 pm on a Saturday night and got the pizookie trio. Because I was so impressed by the Ghirardelli pizookie, I came back on a Saturday evening and ordered a regular sized pizookie. It wasn't very warm; I guess it wasn't in the oven for long enough. Oh well, the food here is frign sexy anyway."
Jesse N.,"San Gabriel, CA",215,7,1,4.0,1/8/2013,"Great service, food, and environment to hang out with friends! There is a high variety of food selection and they are also good.  You have televisions everywhere making it a great sports watching environment. The waiters were also very polite and always asked if everything was alright. Overall, it's a perfect place to watch that Sunday night game with your friends!"
Emir R.,"Monrovia, CA",24,10,1,3.0,5/7/2013,I would say the food is OK. Got a burger that was supposed to be medium but it was more like well done.. I think next time I'll try the happy hour which is all day on Tuesdays.
Michael P.,"Sacramento, CA",0,49,2,1.0,1/1/2014,"Usually if the food is even remotely worth eating, we give it a score of at least 2. That is why this BJ's gets a 1. Environment is extremely LOUD, so you can not hear anyone at your table. The food is terrible! We ordered the gluten free pizza due to having severe gluten intolerance. We stressed to the waiter how important it is to get the gluten free right so I don't get ridiculously sick, and after about an hour wait, the server brings out a big, fat, greasy, gluten full regular pizza. Thank goodness we asked if it was gluten free and didn't trust that they would bring out the right food. We had to send it back for the gluten free pizza and wait another 20 minutes. After about an hour 20 mins, we realized it was NOT WORTH THE WAIT- greasy (literally the pizza was drenched in grease), nasty texture, no flavor, HUGE globs of cheese. Baked potato was dry and came with basically nothing.  The only decent thing was the bottomless lemonade, which tasted like the frozen stuff you can buy at the supermarket. Even my husband who eats food off the floor said this place was terrible. Yucky."
Danny H.,"South San Francisco, CA",230,458,11,4.0,4/29/2010,"Trade memories from moments Treat love to be lonely Guess that's just the man in me Blame it on..BJ's RESTAURANT AND BREWHOUSE! - usher (fooling around) Random observation - I realized at this restaurant that i will never ever ever beat anyone in finishing a meal, especially if i had to eat the same amount of food as them - it would be impossible. Another random observation: I've never reviewed this chain before, even though I've been here a handful of times.  We ordered some kind of long thin crust pizza thing and it would've been more than enough for me as a meal lol. It had basil on it and looked light and tasted fantastic. I wanted to order the fish tacos but was made aware that if they were fried - its not healthy for you...so i asked and lone and behold they were...lol damn so i ordered the grilled shrimp tacos. It was a little messy and i could only finish one and a half of em (so at least i didnt look too bad that i was gettin outeaten by a mile) I heard their dessert cookie was a huge selling point for them but needless to say we had no room for dessert so with enough willpower, we decided to pass.  p.s. - i know what an arnold palmer is now! Food: 3.5 stars --- Service: 5 stars --- Atmosphere: 3.5 stars --- Price(value): 4 stars"
Jasmine N.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,40,27,4.0,6/8/2012,"My first time at a BJ's and it was very yummy. The food is tasty and the portions are big. The Pizookie desert is good but very sweet. You constantly have to be  drinking liquid so it could go down. They gave pizza slice appetizers while we waited to be seated. They were so good, it's almost like pizza from Pizza Hut. Service could've been better. We ordered the desert and the waitress took about 10-15 minutes, and still got the order wrong. So we had to wait another 10 minutes.It's a little noisy in there, or maybe it depends on the time you go. If you go on a date, and the guy is into sports, BJ's is not the place to go lol. There's TV's everywhere."
Chris J.,"Pasadena, CA",310,99,,4.0,5/14/2013,"What can I say, I love this place!! I come here often with co-workers or friends, and I cant complain. The service is great, the food is delicious, the house beer is fantastic, and the PIIIZZZOOOOOOKKKKIIIIIEEEE IS LIKE AN ORGASM IN YOUR MOUTH!!! Am I allowed to say that on Yelp?? Anyway, that's my take on this place. Do yourself a solid and try this place out if you have not done so yet!"
Marilee V.,"Altadena, CA",109,23,,5.0,6/20/2010,"Every time we dine here, we are greeted promptly and cheerfully. Last night was no different. The hosts took our names, quoted a 15 minute wait and off we went to the bar where we were promptly served two fantastic brews. A few sips into our beers, our pager went off and we were whisked away to our table. Again, prompt greetings, beverage and food inquiries and before we knew it, we had a delicious pizza in front of us. We almost always order a large Spinach and Artichoke pizza with grilled chicken and garlic added. We eat a piece or two, share a mouth-watering Pizookie and take the rest of the pizza home.  We are not recognized regulars--so the staff is not giving us special treatment. The excellent service and outstanding food can only be a testament to the Management's emphasis on training and quality."
Food C.,"Olympia, WA",9,74,1,3.0,6/15/2012,"Went here the other night with my husband. It was just okay. Ordered the Calamari and it's not as good as bucca di beppo. I ordered pizza it was good.. but when I had the leftovers today, it taste like pizza hut, yuck!  My husband ordered the jalepeno burger and that was really good! So, overall these three stars are for the burger, YAY!"
Bailee C.,"Pomona, CA",18,9,,5.0,11/17/2012,"Went there today to watch USC/UCLA Game today.  Had a great time!  Food was good, service was even better!!  Waiter was Jeff, very friendly and the Manager, Tom stopped by to see how everything was.....Top Notch!  Would definately recommend!!  Only downfall was UCLA won.....FIGHT ON TROY!!"
Hao X.,"Ontario, CA",0,5,1,1.0,6/11/2015,"the waiter just keep asking me ："" ready for the check？"" like every 10mins，well ，suck！"
Marina B.,"Monrovia, CA",67,11,,2.0,5/26/2011,"**This is review on the take-out service provided by this location** I wish I could give them a better rating but in this case the lack of good customer service overrides the quality of the food. For the 2nd time in a month my husband and I have ordered food for pick-up and not only did my husband wait for someone to come to the pick-up counter while our food sat under the warmer, when he got home our order was wrong. So we called to let them know we were on our way to return it for a hot and correct order. After trying to explain this several times the kid at the counter offered  to just fix it & give us a pazookie. It took a bit of convincing for us to get a conversation with the manager and for him to understand that we weren't going eat cold food. Do you want us to come back and order there again? We have come to the conclusion that the kids at the counter are not required to be educated on the menu or when they check the orders they would know what was missing and what isn't.  I am very disappointed because I love their food. But when we are looking for a place to eat destinations who fail to provide us good service both in store and for take out are last on our list."
SoCalSparky o.,"San Diego, CA",34,374,130,1.0,3/28/2011,"We were passing through this area while visiting family and had one of the WORST experiences ever with one of the hostesses. (age: late teens/early twenty something, dark mid-length hair, dark features, short stature) When we walked into the restaurant it was fairly busy, but by no means ""crazy"". The hostess was rude upon entry and had the other host show us to a small bar table in a corner of the bar. Being 6 months pregnant (and showing) I found this to be odd, but then realized that there were a lot of open tables in this establishment and decided to ask for another table. We went back to the hostess and asked for another table. This young obstinate girl was ONE OF THE RUDEST AND MOST UNFRIENDLY people I have ever encountered in the service industry. Being that I have both bar/restaurant management experience, as well as have worked  as a bartender, server, and hostess throughout my late teens and twenty something years, I can guarantee that I would have fired, on the spot, any employee who acted like she did to a paying customer. First off, when I asked for another table, she looked at me like I was her worst enemy and then told me that I should have ""said something from the beginning because they seat people wherever they want on rotation"". Honestly, I'm well versed with rotations you snide little brat and am shocked you even know what the word means. Although our server was very nice, the management seemed overwhelmed and could have cared less about this hostile, (could be racist and sexist), hostess. It's a shame that in today's society we still allow the race card to affect how we serve people in the service industry. If I were someone looking to eat at a restaurant in this area I'd strongly consider choosing Cheesecake, Chili's, Olive Garden, Acapulco, CPK, or another chain restaurant within the 5 mile radius of this establishment. Obviously their customer service at the door is less than to be desired...and watch out for the blatant hostility of the hostess who apparently thinks herself God's gift to the world in her ridiculous bottom of the restaurant chain hostess position."
Beth G.,"Covina, CA",36,9,11,5.0,7/9/2012,"We had an amazing experience last night, our waiter Jerron was the bomb! They seated his section all at once and he handled it with ease. We shared appetizers and my husband has a burger that was cooked perfectly. We eat here about twice a month and will be back!"
Hiro N.,"Torrance, CA",7,15,1,1.0,5/20/2010,"I normally am a fan of BJ restaurants...love the food and the atmosphere there...but this particular one has got to be the WORST in terms of service.  There was a Laker game on at the time and the wait was at least an hour.  We decided to wait and noticed groups on the list behind us were being seated. We asked what was going on, they took our pager and asked us to wait to the side to be seated.  We waited another 25 mins...they apparently forgot to seat us.  While my wife was complaining, I was waiting by the register and overheard that some of the employees have been trying to seat their friends in before the rest of us who have been waiting for over an hour.  Once I heard that, I just took my wife and we left for Cheesecake Factory.  Will never go to this place again.  Mind you, even the manager was there overseeing this disaster and nothing was done."
Brandon H.,"Arcadia, CA",0,2,,3.0,8/28/2013,The BJ in Arcadia sometimes has its perks but it sometimes also lacks service. The other day i had a waiter that felt like he didn't want to be there at all. WHAT KIND OF SERVICE IS THAT???? and to make the matters worse when I ordered a pasta it didn't come with the meat and they charged us same price. The one in Arcadia is not the one to go to but I do suggest the one in Pasadena.
