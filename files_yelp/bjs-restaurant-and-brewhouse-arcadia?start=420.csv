Wolf L.,"Portland, OR",394,892,22,4.0,3/7/2009,"In my opinion, restaurant chains are usually crap. Don't even get me started about Olive Garden. Oh, a chill just ran down my spine when I thought about...Red Lobster...ay, there it went again...and something else ran down my leg. BJ's, however, is not your typical, craptacular restaurant chain.  This BJ's is within walking distance of my house, which is convenient if I'm planning on drinking mass quantities of beer. The beer they brew at BJ's is pretty decent. Certainly not high-quality microbrewed stuff, but it tastes fresh and flavorful. I like the Tatonka Stout and the PM Porter the best. BJ's also has a full bar--we often eat in the bar area to avoid a wait--and they make a damn good margarita, I must say. The food is consistently good and I've always been impressed with the level of service at this very, very busy location. There's always a big crowd on weekend evenings and I've never had bad service.  The avocado egg rolls are my favorite appetizer. For dinner, I often get the Cajun chicken stuffed baked potato. I also like the pizza--better than CPK, in my opinion. For dessert, yeah, it's the Pizookie. What kind of diet-smashing monster thought that concoction up? Freaking giant-ass cookie slathered with melting ice cream. Demon! Anyway, I'm glad this place is in the neighborhood. Makes up for all the other lousy joints on Arcadia's restaurant row."
Daisy C.,"Duarte, CA",7,1,2,5.0,8/2/2012,"Great pizza,  buffalo chicken pizza the best! I been here several times with my co-workers , everytime we go there  the service is good and the food  always has a great taste. :)"
Tiffany P.,"Monterey Park, CA",299,640,47,3.0,12/19/2011,"Came here during happy hour the other day.  Even though it wasn't busy, the service was pretty slow.  It seemed like it took a long time to get our drinks, when all we ordered we some shots (room-temperature albeit).  The food is decent and you generally can't go wrong with anything fried."
Heather H.,"Pasadena, CA",64,147,,4.0,1/15/2012,"Always have great food here. Service was great  as well. We had the Caprese salad starter, chicken tortilla soup, potroast, and pizooUkie with ice cream for dessert.  Berry cider is my favorite.  Can come  with friends or my kid and we always have great choices."
Sherry V.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,228,,4.0,1/10/2012,"Wow, they've really revamped their menu. Every entree shows the calorie count next to it. Extremely helpful, though I'm sure most people try not to look at it. I tried the Chicken a la fresca from their ""Enlightened Entrees"" menu. Marinated chicken breast w/ rice pilaf and a ratatouille with Dijon taragon au jus on top. That sauce was flavorful and light. I felt good about resisting their pizzas for once. But at the end of the night, I did share the red velvet pizookie. I wasn't a big fan of it-- I think the white chocolate chips have got to go. Red velvet w/ cream cheese mixed in the batter and vanilla ice cream on top should be sufficient enough. If they wanted something diff, they could've added cheesecake flavor ice cream on top or something. But the white choco chips just straight up made it too darn sweet. Bleh! Definitely needed a glass of milk."
Kaylin O.,"Los Angeles, CA",219,887,306,3.0,10/25/2009,"Came here for a friend's bday dinner.  Since I had eaten already, I only had an avocado eggroll and white chocolate/chocolate chunks pizookie!  The avocado eggroll was bland and disappointing.  It was also a bit pricey for what we got $9.95. The white chocolate part of the pizookie was sooooo   goooood.  Both my friends and I noticed  how shallow the cookie pan was.  They reduced the amount of cookie so you get less for your money.  Service was decent considering we had 13 people in our group."
Ed A.,"Arcadia, CA",5,106,35,4.0,3/19/2012,"I love BJ's for lunch.  The lunch pizza is a good deal.  They also have lunch specials.  You can sit at the bar if you do not want to wait for a table, but usually during lunch the wait is reasonable.  They have a nice selection of items on the menu."
Julie B.,"Arcadia, CA",18,41,5,5.0,5/11/2014,"Bj's is the best place to celebrate-anytime!  Their food is delicious-especially the potato skins and stuffed mushrooms, and their new Fried Chicken Breasts are so good!  The service at BJ's (especially from Valerie and Katie) is top notch and they go over and above to make everyone feel special!  We come to BJ's for every special occasion and are never disappointed!  If you want to treat anyone, from child to senior, you can't miss with BJ's!"
Louie A.,"Pasadena, CA",18,126,53,3.0,12/17/2011,This is a great place for deep dish pizza! I particularly liked the BJ's favorite and the Great White Way. Of course you can't go wrong either with the Barbeque Chicken Pizza.  Nice ambience for hanging out with beers. The Calzone is a BIG mistake! Guys stick to your pizzas...awful attempt at the calzones...
Oswaldo C.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,16,55,5.0,6/21/2012,Love the experience. Great Beer! Great Environment ! Enjoyable!
Joseph O.,"Duarte, CA",2,39,,5.0,4/15/2012,Food is always great. drinks are good. beer is from the tap. prices are good. great service always. i come here for the food and drinks. i love the chicken parmessan with cheesy mashed potatoes.
Candia M.,"Albuquerque, NM",35,159,13,4.0,8/28/2013,"Love the convenience of having my calorie count on the menu.  If you, like me, are desperately clinging to your youth and trying not to gain weight, the Enlightened menu is a godsend.  If you are new to being a travelling consultant in Southern California and would rather put your hand in a blender and hit frappe than get back on the effing freeway after a long day, and you find yourself at a chain such as BJs in Arcadia, thank your lucky stars that BJs is within walking distance from the Embassy Suites and Hampton Inn.  Further thank whatever gods of food and comfort as you can imagine that you are seated in Myra's section.  Yes, a good Hawaiian mahi-mahi under 500 calories, a standard but well-chilled pinot grigio, and far above average service from Myra can make a far from home dinner at 8 pm a relaxing and reassuring experience.  And I don't have to get up at 4 a.m. to do penance on the treadmill.  Nice."
Jimmy Z.,"Orlando, FL",365,6,1,4.0,4/24/2011,"I've lost count to how many times i've been to this BJ's. Main reason being i work at the Olive Garden next door. Hungry after work? walk next door to BJ's for there happy hour on weekdays. 2 bucks off apps and half off mini pizza's. I love there Avocado rolls, Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps, and Ahi Poke especially after a long day of work. I enjoy there Baked Beignet, more so then the pizookies, i find the texture of the pizookies to be too gooey but that could just be a personal preference."
Santos L.,"Pasadena, CA",2,5,,1.0,4/1/2012,"This place is a complete disappointment.  I've been here at least 4 times within the past 3 months, with co-workers (their choice).  Why I thought this place might get better, I have no idea, delusion perhaps. The first time (around January) we came here for Monday Mojito specials.  The bartender seems to pour the mojito from a pre-made mojito jug.  Tastes like lemonade with mint.  I suppose this is what you would expect with a 5 dollar mojito.  Do not come here if you follow a Vegan diet.    All times I've been here I've scoured the menu for anything vegan... Thus far a salad is the best option.  Now let's get to the salads... I ordered an Italian market salad (Minus all meat and diary, seemed like the best choice for toppings) When I received the salad it was  99% ice berg lettuce.  The said toppings were meek, and sad looking at best.  Kalamata olives looked as thought they had been sitting outside of the jar for weeks (A gross light brown color).  Minimal tomatos, red bell peppers, and pepperoncinis.  On top of this all I found pieces of bread in my salad, very small pieces... (why?) Bread was no where near the description of the salad, very weird and disgusting. Other than expecting all disappointment from a chain like this, I will say, If you are into and expect a mediocre time, with mediocre (at best) food, mediocre service, mediocre drinks, and mediocre music, by all means go to BJ's"
Evan L.,"Pasadena, CA",27,4,,5.0,5/18/2012,"I went here with my girlfriend not too long ago, and the service was nothing but outstanding! I wasn't expecting our waiter to go above and beyond, and when there was a complication with the registers, he gave us our desert for free! Absolutely recommended."
Nathan W.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,111,17,5.0,1/21/2010,"My uncle told me to meet him at BJ's for food and I thought wow hes gonna bring me to BJ's wholesale and buy me booze. Turns out its a restaurant and a dam good one. Try the avacado egg rolls, they are to die for"
Sophia H.,"West Covina, CA",116,102,483,5.0,7/31/2009,Delicious Pizza (SPINACH & ARTICHOKE) + Good Beer + YUMMY Pizookie (COOKIES 'N CREAM PIZOOKIE® WITH OREO) = A mouth watering experience. I LOVE this place for any occasion.
Kevin T.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,321,17,4.0,7/19/2009,"I don't usually like to review chain restaurants, but I feel like I can make an exception for BJ's. It has become my favorite American-style chain restaurant... better than Cheesecake Factory, Applebees (Unless I go for half off appetizers in NJ, which is freaking awesome), Chili's, TGIF, and the like, I'd definitely chooese BJ's over all of those. I've been to this location several times and to one in Norcal, and every time, the service has been exceptional. Someone comes by the table frequentyly refilling waters and checking up on us, and the food comes out in a good time. My favorite dish has been the avocado eggrolls. They're pretty oily, but are delicious! The spinach and artichoke pizza is awesome, and if you get a burger, always get the seasoned wedge fries. I've also had one of their cocktails, the Pomegranate Sunrise, and it tasted delicious, not much alcohol feel to it, just sweet and savory. Of course, you gotta have the pizookie (if you have any space left... their dishes are HUGE). I LOVE it... best dessert idea ever. I'm craving some right now... sadly, it's 3:40 in the morning and they're not open. If you're thinking of going to one of those other American bar/grill type restaurants, skip it and check out BJ's. It'll be totally worth it."
Liz Z.,"Duarte, CA",0,12,,5.0,6/14/2012,Best Pizza crispy and loaded! Nice staff also and fun atmosphere.
Sam M.,"Pasadena, CA",19,171,,4.0,2/15/2009,"One of my favorite chain restaurants.  Good deep dish pizza, but the best thing about BJ's is the beer.  They brew their own beer and it's very good.  The beer makes everything taste better.  The portions are huge.  Some of their pastas are reasonably good. It gets too crowded on weekends, and they don't accept reservations."
