Cliff R.,"Lompoc, CA",5,153,1,3.0,8/9/2011,Great spot for a business lunch (as long as you'll can stand the noise).  The food is predictable.  Which is a good thing if you travel as much as I do.  I like eating here from time to time.  I give them a solid three stars for atmosphere and food.  4 stars for their bubbly and attentive staff.
Maria R.,"Pasadena, CA",18,269,,2.0,8/2/2009,"8/1/09; Saturday; 5pm 3-star food (minus) 1-star service = 2 stars. Dinner with a friend; we got in just before the dinner rush, so there was no wait. Strawberry limonade (don't do it - it's just liquid concentrate with one ounce of water added) and 2 mini-pizzas (delicious, but TINY, really tiny). Both pizzas were yummy, but overpriced @ $10 for each appetizer-sized portion.  Good food was overshadowed by bad service. Really bad. ""No tip for you/where's the manager"" bad. Wow. From the intro, our waiter was angry, sour, and slow. So slow with our drinks, that I finally got up and went to the bar myself. That seemed to alert Mr. Angry that he had a situation on his hands and he went into full fake-nice cover-up mode (layered right on top of the angry). Sorry......too little, way too late.  We were asked about dessert right after the food was delivered; the bill came while we were eating. Clearly a table-turning hustle to appease the masses in line outside. I'm rarely in Arcadia for dinner, but the next time, I'll skip this clip joint. p.s. to Mr. Angry Waiter:  Honey, I really am sorry that s/he cut up your clothes and left you right before your shift, but please call in sick next time."
Eddie W.,"Monterey Park, CA",161,71,9,3.0,3/16/2011,"if you like alcohol...this is your spot. if you like fatty food and don't give a crap about your health then again...this is your spot. im not hating on the food or anything but this isn't where you'd go if you want a healthy or even remotely healthy meal. pazookies are friggin amazingly good and so are most other desserts/appetizers. i came here for their buffalo chicken pizza, but it was pretty disappointing...didn't have enough of the buffalo sauce taste and the small but hard celery pieces were very annoying to eat on a pizza. alondra's does it better :\ plus this is on the pricy side for this kind of food."
Peggy A.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,117,12,4.0,5/23/2011,This place was prettying nice. Went here on a lunch date with my friend and were seated super quickly. Our server was nice and food was pretty good. Its nothing different than the other BJs I've been to but its pretty chill. Ill be back but only if I'm around the neighborhood
Tom N.,"Glendora, CA",64,155,87,5.0,5/23/2011,"I think any place that brews beer is doing the Lord'a work,lol. Good place to hang out have some beers and a good dinner. Food is very tasty and yes better than olive garden and less wait time."
Ayako H.,"Chūō, Japan",3,2,,3.0,11/30/2011,"The inside atmosphere and the service were good.  The pizza we ordered was delicious, though I expected more on the ale."
Michael P.,"Arcadia, CA",14,3,,1.0,1/26/2012,"Every time I go to BJ's its because I forgot that I said I would not go there again. Ordered take away got the ""Angus Beef Sliders"" to share the ""Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo"" as an entree and a pizookie for dessert. The sliders were very greasy, the chicken dry the fettuccine looked like it had sat around for an hour and was drying out. (I live 2 minutes away and got there 10 minutes after I ordered) The pizooke was on the verge of being burnt. My fault I couldn't send it back 'cause I took it to go. Waste of $. Much better restaurants close bye."
Reina J.,"Glendora, CA",57,42,97,2.0,9/28/2011,"This used to be my favorite BJ's. I learned everything there is know about Bj's here....BUT ever since the remodel, something is askew. One night I went there with a friend and they were really packed. I don't mind waiting for a seat cause I can just sit at the bar till it's ready. This time we got stuck in the corner on a table barley big enough for both your plates. The waiter had to keep taking the plates away to make room for new ones. We had to scoot the table yourselves to make room because we were so close to the other table, the waiter had a hard time gettiing by with his plates of food. I was very dispaointed the last coupe times I went. After the remodel, the service should not have to suffer. I will be going to the other locations in my area. I have already checked out the La puente location...I like it!!!"
simon c.,"Arcadia, CA",2,30,2,1.0,9/22/2013,Just bad. Dishes that they brought were dirty as well as utensils. There were cheese particles stuck on the plate. We ordered chicken fetticini Alfredo. Chicken was not even cooked on a few pieces. Told the waitress which got the manager. Manager Asked if we want a new one cooked or something else. We kept the same dish since we were craving for it. When they brought back the plate they removed the chicken that was not cooked and gave us the plate back. Waitress never came back to our table after that. Our cups had no water and had to flag down another waitress.
Harleen Q.,"Anaheim, CA",0,3,2,1.0,1/10/2014,"walked in. stood around for a good 5 min into any empty bj's i had to be the one to approach an employee to be ASKED to be sitted. bjs employee then tried to sit me at the bar (i had walked in with a baby, mom, and younger sister) so no i wouldn't know why they would suggest that.. i asked for a booth (girl rolled her eyes) as soon as we were sitted no waiter waited on us for about 20 mins. finally after someone approaching us the girl seemed wack with no energy and just very unpleasing at which point who the fudge would hire that type of person for this type of setting (it definitely does not make me want to come back at this location for sure) she didn't really give us or asked us for we were ready to order she just walked away without say. 10 mins later we apparently have a different waiter who was just as bad.  i hope they didn't spit in my food. this location was the worse experience ever! i should have went to mcdonalds instead they have better people skills.  i want my time and money back."
Priscilla S.,"El Monte, CA",231,145,21,4.0,5/5/2011,"came back during Christmas time with the boyfriend for his company Christmas dinner. It was a buffet-styled dinner with a variety of pizza and some pasta. Holy crap. The pizza's fcking awesome. Sure, the calories may be in the thousands, but it's still some of the best pizza I've ever had!  I wouldn't mind going back.... but just not until after I work off all those extra pounds I gained eating that delicious stuff haha."
savannah w.,"Ontario, CA",5,7,,4.0,10/28/2009,"So my first review & yes a chain restaurant. Saturday night the place was crowded, but seating took a quick 15mins. It was actually a USC football night...big screen tv's were everywhere which is nice to enjoy all around. Service was a bit slow, but considering it was a busy night. Menu items that we ordered are Great Beginings- Crispy Calamari Entrees- Balsamic Glazed Chicken -Scampi pasta with a good amount of shrimp both were enjoyable and took doggie bags home. Recommended to go with dates or family"
Jessica S.,"Pasadena, CA",24,26,6,4.0,8/26/2009,"I like this BJ's better than the West Covina location. It's smaller and a lot more intimate, instead of being inside some giant room where everyone is yelling. The front desk isn't too friendly, a couple times I've come, we just ended up looking around for someone to set us. The service is usuaaally okay. I think it's a toss up if you'll get a good server or a bad one, so if you find a good server, I recommend just asking for them all the time! The food is always GREAT, but if it's busy, be sure to order as fast as possible so you don't wait too long"
Kris B.,"Nice, France",50,86,35,4.0,3/31/2009,"on my quest to learning about beer...here in America  they are very proud of their local brew per say I decide to go to BJ's .... I heard fro many people to go to a place where they offer their own beer, so I did order a beer/malt with a chocolate flavor with a steak, once I was finished with it I requested a lager that would enhabnce the flavor of the red meat... I applied the White and Red wine rule, with beer but it works differently. I enjoyed my steak with a lager beer, after 1 dark and 3 lagers I was pretty satisfied with the flavor... I;m not a beer drinker. but I Appreciate a good brew and for sure this place has a carte with their flavors... After a great meal plus the extended calories of 3 beers we decided to order dessert, a BJ's famous Pizookie...!!!!!!DELicious~ great place...~ I will def. come back.... if anyone wanna teach me about beer some more I would love to hit another place... thanks."
Chris n' gel S.,"Monrovia, CA",36,172,175,4.0,5/8/2011,"husband and I go here for our lunch.our fave foods are their santa fe chicken salad,Chinese chicken salad,avocado rolls, and of course their famous pizzokie for dessert!"
Esther K.,"Arcadia, CA",315,825,2224,4.0,6/19/2008,"I used to absolutely love this place. In high school, whenever my friends and I would meet for dinner, we would come here. It's conveniently located, lots of parking, lots of food. Good times. On the downside, however, I think we OD'd on this place and cannot come back for a few more years :P But it's a good place to go to with friends. They have quite a lot of seating, and there is a large bar in the middle surrounded by TVs which is nice if there's a game on that you want to catch. On the weekends the place can get pretty crowded so you will want to make a reservation if you have a decent sized party. My favourite part about BJs is their pizookie. I *love* their pizookies. It is just so nice and warm and delicious!!! Which is why I used to always go there on my birthday, because they give you the pizookie for free then :D Their other menu items are good too. They have pretty much faded from my memory, but I think they give a lot of food. Their pizzas are good, of course. And their drinks aren't bad either. The pizookie is still the best though ;) Hmmmm.. now I want a pizookie.."
Lisa F.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",54,60,22,5.0,7/13/2011,This place serves the best Chicago deep dish pizza.  My daughter got a kids meal of macaroni and cheese and I have never seen such a big portion for a kid.  She did not eat it all and definitely could have shared it.  We topped off our meal with a pizzooki.  It was gone in a flash.
Michael E.,"Monrovia, CA",7,34,3,5.0,9/20/2012,"amazing food, amazing beer, lots of tvs, fantastic service. I come here whenever I'm in the area, i always get the same few things, but sometimes I switch it up. I like to ask the servers what they recommend, and so far, i have not been let down. My server was CAMERON,  and to be honest, I don't think they get any better, I asked him what he recommended, and he told me Jambalaya, but I'm not a big fan of jambalaya, he told me to try it with pasta instead of rice. amazing! whenever i go here, i ask personally for Cameron to be my server, I'll even wait a little bit longer if I have too. he's that good. very good personality, and good honest... pretty good looking too."
Michaela O.,"La Crescenta, CA",92,98,2,4.0,5/1/2010,"Sure, we live in a city where we're so over the ""chain restaurants,"" but this is one chain I'm not over. I really only come here for the late night HAPPY HOUR and the four stars are strictly for the delicous mini pizzas.  After 10pm. they are $5 instead of the regular $10"
Erica G.,"Monrovia, CA",0,3,,2.0,12/13/2014,"BJ's was always the convenient restaurant to pop into right by our house, but after last nights experience, I don't think we'll be going back much. The wait staff was very sweet and helpful. They did whatever they could do to be as accommodating as possible. Where our frustrations came in was when we ordered a pizza, the pizza was made wrong, so we sent it back. They sent out the same pizza just with a missing ingredient burned into an already unsatisfactory pizza. We tried to eat the pizza but it was so not appetizing and not what we ordered. So finally, our server placed another order for a fresh pizza. After waiting for a fresh pizza, they finally brought it out, along with the manager. This is where my issue is. The manager did nothing but smile, point out that the pizza previously ""looked funny"", stood there for a minute while we got served, and then walked away. I thought, ""surely she will do the right thing and either not charge us for the pizza, take off our appetizer...something"". The manager did absolutely nothing to make up for the mistake. We ended up walking out over two hours later with a full price check. I'm in customer service and I would never have handled that situation like that, as a manager. The wait staff was very sweet and they apologized a million times and tried to do what they could to make it right. The manager dropped the ball on this one. And that seems to be the case most of the time at this place. They really need to step it up in the quality of their management."
