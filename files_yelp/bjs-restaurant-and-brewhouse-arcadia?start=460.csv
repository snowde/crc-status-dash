Chrissy L.,"Corpus Christi, TX",38,123,2,4.0,6/26/2008,"I have been coming to this BJs ever since highschool. I love the lunch specials - sandwhich and salad/soup. I love love their chicago style thick pizza - esp BJs favorite or barbeque. I eat it with a fork and a knife. I love love love their Bazooka! Ridculously sweet but good.  Drinks have always been my favorite there - shirley temples for sweet fun or pear ciders for sweet alcohol. Prices are good. Sometimes there is a wait, but it's worth it! This is my fav restaurant and sports bar."
Vipul C.,"Glendora, CA",48,72,23,1.0,6/19/2012,"Not happy with our experience there!  Normally BJ's is a standard restaurant - not to good, not to bad...but our last experience was terrible.  40+ Minutes waiting when told 20 minutes.  Sat us in a freezing section.  When we asked to be moved, the waiter told us to go back up front, without escorting us, then disappeared, leaving us to find out what's going on by ourselves.  They, gave away our 2nd table to another lady who was complaining louder than us.  Finally, when we sat down, it took forever for the waitress to come and take our order.  She thought we were waiting for more in our party?!?!  Then, when asked if we can add a few onions onto the salad, she said we'd be charged for that...but didn't want to discount when we didn't want bacon on the potato skins...what's up with that?  In fact, she would of thrown on a few onions - it's really no big deal - we were 5 people and probably would of ended up spending $100 for dinner/sodas that night, plus her tip.  Needless to say, that was the last straw and we left after wasting all that time.  It seemed like that waitress didn't really care - like she's been there for 100 years and was burned out - whatever!"
Kyla H.,"Temple City, CA",46,37,,3.0,6/18/2011,"As chain restaurants go, this is a better than most. Beer is good and the menu's not bad :)"
Gerard I.,"Pasadena, CA",501,806,351,5.0,9/20/2007,"Who's got two thumbs, spikey hair, and loves Bj's? THIS GUY DOES!!!! The best dish here is the blackened chicken potato. You could chuck it at someone's head and give them a concussion--They're that massive! The pazookies are great, if it's your birthday--they'll give you one for free. Let's just say it's my birthday every time I come here. ;-) Now, the beer! They brew their own. The Tatanka, hands down the best around, yes, even better than GB's.  Try the sampler beer platter. They bring out several mini glasses of all their brands for you to taste. That's a prerequisite when coming here.  The ciders are also pretty tasty. Now in the words of my boy Quentin Tarantino, ""Is that a tasty beverage, or is that tasty beverage!"""
Kim B.,"Pasadena, CA",39,127,8,4.0,10/28/2006,"Your basic American brewery restaurant.  Food is reliably decent and the service at this particular location has always been good.  It gets very crowded at the expected times, noonish and 7ish.  Otherwise, seating isn't a problem.   I always order potato skins.  They're crispy without being dry.  And, they're covered in about 2 lbs. of cheese.  Also, they have great onion rings."
Brian H.,"Vancouver, WA",8,66,3,4.0,3/26/2008,I do not suggest eating at the bar itself....it is a logistical nightmare. Other than that...the fish and chips and my salad were great.. They have a killer selection of beer on tap.  Great bar atmosphere..... I'm not a big sports guy but all my co- workers were really into watching the games on their many t.v.s
Wen H. L.,"Arcadia, CA",0,13,,4.0,5/7/2013,"Came here for our weekend family dinner on Saturday night.  The place was crowded but the wait wasn't bad.  Our server was nice and friendly.  The appetizers that we got, avocado egg rolls, crispy calamari, Santa Fe spring rolls and the flat bread pizza were all delicious and I highly recommend them. The Salmon and the Caesar salad were also great, but their Sirloin and the lobster tails were a bit dry.  Overall, I do recommend the place and will be coming back soon."
Raymond R.,"Arcadia, CA",253,19,,1.0,6/30/2013,It's official. I am not ever coming back to this bjs. It's sad but they just keep getting worse.
Rajiv P.,"Arcadia, CA",74,166,,5.0,1/13/2010,I want you guys to understand that this is a 5 star review specifically because the sliders are great and they're only $5.50 during happy hour and the mini-pizza's are $5 during happy hour.  If you only order those two things during happy hour BJ's is AMAZING.
Theo D.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",4,25,,4.0,11/6/2010,Cold - COLD- C O L D beer.  That seems all I can remember by now. Some how I think I can remember myself doing a dance on some type of dance video game. I also think I remember a warm and crusty bread stick.  The beer is cold.  My nephew seemed to have a good time though.   I enjoyed the beer.  Lots of beer.
Cindi G.,"Norco, CA",0,20,,4.0,7/20/2013,"we frequent bj's because they make some pretty decent gluten free food for my son.  the place tends to be a bit too noisy.  the wait staff can be a little rushed as it does get busy.  they tend to have a few goofs once in a while, but overall, the food is pretty good.  i like the chicken bbq salad. one time, all of our glasses were split / broken and we ended up getting some excuse that the dishwasher gets them too hot, then the cold tea cracks the glass.  ugh...not my problem.  another time, all of the cloth napkins were damp and smelled a bit, so when i asked about it, the manager informed me that they had been out in the shed and got rained on.  ???  i guess that was okay with them.  another time they forgot to bring out some of our food....then when we asked about it, they attempted to bring it after the rest of our party was done eating....no thanks, we're leaving now.  so there are some weird problems that pop up, but the food is good....and gluten free."
Richard R.,"Altadena, CA",0,104,,5.0,1/24/2009,"A little pricey, but great overall. The pizza is the best and maybe only Chicago-style in town.  The other options are surprisingly good.  If you have room, the Bazooka is the #1 desert option in town. The beer selection is top-notch.  There is always a wonderful seasonal microbrew and they even carry some Belgians in bottles. The service is good and the atmosphere is casual. My only gripe is that there aren't enough high-quality TV's for the sports fan in me.  It is a cool place to watch the UCLA game though."
Ninkasi D.,"Pasadena, CA",32,121,4,2.0,7/1/2007,"Waiter! There's a fly in my salad. No - seriously! The last two times I came to this BJs, I wound up getting sick. Which is sad, because at one time, this was one of my favorite restaurants. Let me just say that the quality of the beers they brew and serve here is great - though I'm not so sure they actually brew on the premises at this location. Still, the variety of BJ's beers and the quality has remained consistent for as long as I can remember. And that, first and foremost, is the reason why I started coming here in the first place.  But the food...well. Now that's a whole 'nother story. At one time, the menu was good and solid. The food had variety and, more importantly, flavor. Flavor in food is a good thing. Really. But in the years that I've frequented this location, the menu has been changed at least three times, and with each change, the offerings have become bland and tasteless more and more. The last two times I ate here I got sick to my stomach. I'm not sure that it was food poisoning - and I'm pretty sure you KNOW when you have food poisoning - but let's just say that the food didn't sit well with me.  The first time I had a bowl of tomato-basil pasta. The sauce was the most tasteless concoction I'd ever had. Even a generous layer of powdered and chalky Parmesan cheese didn't help.  Thank goodness for the Piranha Pale Ale I washed it down with. I can't remember the last meal I had there because I was traumatized by the dead fly found in my friend's salad, made worse by the lackluster response from our waiter, and fact that it took 15 minutes for the manager on duty to come over and offer his apologies.  He also offered us a round of drinks, which considering the circumstances, seemed like the right thing to do. We didn't learn until later that when he offered ""to get us ladies a round of drinks,"" he meant it literally - that he would go and get them from the bar and bring them to the table. We still had to pay for them. Thankfully my friend whose food had the fly in it was not charged for her bad experience. Whatever I had that night made me all barfy the next day as well. If I go to this BJs again, it will be for the beer."
Trent S.,"Santee, CA",15,15,,3.0,4/29/2011,"Restaurant was very close to hotel we were staying at - within walking distance.  We were seated very quickly, no wait.  Our waiter was a bit over zealous while we were trying to decide on our dinner.  Beer was OK.  Food was alright, a little bland for my tasting."
bob b.,"Monrovia, CA",2,17,2,3.0,2/15/2011,"I have been to Chicago and no part of this restaurant is close to being a Chicago pizzeria. Food is decent by chain restaurant standards, but you'll feel it in the morning. Beer gets a good nod though."
Timothy D.,"San Gabriel, CA",546,27,12,4.0,10/29/2010,Great service and food! I come here about once a month if not twice. Burgers here are great! The cajun pasta is my personal favorite here. Prices are reasonable and well worth the portion. Don't forget to order their famous pizookie! No dinner at BJ's is complete without a pizookie for desert haha.
Jerry M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",36,56,4,2.0,1/24/2011,Food was ok. Server didn't get the order correct.  Not sure why they don't write the order down!  They always mess our order up here. I guess the customer should go directly in the back to speak to the chef personally. They weren't even that busy.
Matthew H.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",3,50,14,2.0,8/20/2010,Mini pizzas are ok...not great just ok. Mine was actually cold. We only got a third of our order. Service was slow but they cleaned our table and brought the check real fast. Business was slow though so they have no excuse. Sad really.
Keikilani S.,"Kapaa, HI",4,22,,4.0,12/30/2010,"Excellent customer service, atmosphere superb and food menu seemingly standard American restaurant fare. Food is delicious! We has the Derek'S meatloaf sandwich, giant baked potato with pale ale chili, and bleu cheese wedge. All excellent. Brewery menu was great. Enjoyed having porter for breakfast :)."
BustA G.,"Pasadena, CA",397,187,224,4.0,5/4/2008,"This place is usually packed with families and and kids/grown ups that are stopping in for a bite to eat after catching an outdoors, local sporting event.  There's several flat screen TV monitors located in and near the bar to catch the latest sporting events.   My family has dined at this location many, many times.  My oldest always orders the small cheese pizza and BBQ chicken sandwich and savors every bite.  My youngest usually has the small pepperoni pizza and usually takes home leftovers.  My hubby usually orders the vegetarian type pizza and we share an order of the southwest avocado rolls.  The rolls are served warm and are an excellent combination with the sweet tasting dipping sauce that it comes with.   Recently I tried BJ's cobb salad where I should have ordered it WITHOUT turkey.  The turkey didn't look like it was freshly prepared, it was in cube-sized portions.  I had extra bacon added on my salad.  My salad was so tasty that I didn't have any leftovers.  My hubby had a similar salad which was prepared with Atlantic Salmon.   BJ's will always be a place where our family can go for a good meal.   One note of caution, since BJ's caters to large groups and has a bar in the center of the restaurant -- the noise level is very high during dinner time.  BJ's isn't the eatery to go to for an intimate, quiet dinner."
