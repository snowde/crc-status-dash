Gabby T.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",2,31,27,1.0,2/17/2012,"Came here for Valentine's Day at around 7 and the place was crazy busy. The wait was an hour and a half but better than the 2hrs at Olive Garden.  A lot of people didnt show up so our wait was more like an hour. Our waitress's name was Lydia and she ruined my dinner date, along with the lack of quality in the food. Lydia was the type of waitress that made you feel bad for asking for anything extra and i dont really appreciate that when your expecting a tip. She gave me attitude when i didnt like the watered down iced tea and asked for less ice next time. When i asked for lemon she actually slammed them down on the table, b/c she had more stuff for the next table. i was truly appalled by this and couldnt believe this just happen.  My boyfriend's medium well steak was OVER DONE and BURNT and his mash potatoes were thick and dry. He didnt even eat half of it. My pasta limone was just ok. BJ's is famous for its pizookis so we couldnt leave without having one. So over the awful customer service, we decided to order it to go and Lydia had the nerve to make us feel bad about our decision. She said "" the one you ordered is already out of the oven, so you're going to have to wait another 10 minutes for another since you changed your mind. is that alright?"" we got our red velvet pizooki, which was way TOO sweet, and left. She did not get a good tip and ruined my dining experience. It's not my fault you got stuck working Valentine's Day, so dont take it out on paying customers. I like BJ's but this location was definately lacking in customer service and food quality."
Sevag K.,"Pasadena, CA",0,11,,1.0,9/18/2009,"I will never go to this restaurant again. I regrettably ate a bacon cheddar burger recently at this particular BJs. I woke up the next morning and started throwing up. But this wasn't any ordinary puking. The smell of my vomit was so disgusting that I had to flush my toilet many times. I was served one nasty burger. Before this happened to me, I had gone to this restaurant maybe twice and my experiences were bad as well. The ""pazookie"" they serve tastes fine when you're eating. Upon burping, you get this sick taste in your mouth that's perhaps comparable to the taste of eating $hit.  Please don't go to this restaurant."
Priscilla H.,"San Gabriel, CA",44,146,5,4.0,5/22/2007,"Their pizookies are off the chain!!!!!!! I think the chocolate chip one is waaay better than the macadamia nut one... it's dry and not as tasty!  Their bloody marys are soooo good!!!!!!!!!! they have hoegaarden!!!! Their food is pretty good (nothing ultra amazing, except the pizookie) and they have pretty good service. There are a bunch of tv's around so you can watch the game, even if you aren't sitting at the bar."
Greg P.,"Covina, CA",11,521,53,5.0,12/4/2006,"This is a great Happy Hour place!   It has it's own brewery and like 7 different beers.  I usually get the Blonde or Hef.  Happy Hour has mini pizza's half price, and discounted drinks and appitizers.  Lots of TV's to show all the sports you need.  Big bar section to chill with friends also. The restaurant part is your typical American spot, mostly known for it's Chicago Style Pizza, but they have sandwiches, pasta, and meats.  If you go for dinner, spend the extra and have dessert, at least share!  They are known for their Pizookie desser, which is a big cookie that they cook and top with ice cream.  It sounds real simple, and while it might be, it's soooo good.  A great dessert to share.  You will always have a good time here."
Joanne D.,"Las Vegas, NV",70,80,,2.0,7/12/2014,"We were there on Friday July 11 and frankly was disappointed with the service. It was early around 4P, not crowded. My sister had ordered a Dirty Martini with Gray Goose, extra olives. Upon sipping it she knew it was wrong (plus there were no olives in it). We called over the server who brought another server who was taking over  our table. The new server said he can tell by smelling it if it was correct. Well  of course his nose said it was but my sis who drinks these things when she can said no it isn't. He did return it and a new one was brought out to us.  They did not bring out the appetizer ordered before our meal but with the meal. When I said it to the girl she said oh. Put it on the table and walked away. They never brought my sisters salad so at the end of the meal we had them deduct it. I had a pizza but found no sauce on it and it was undercooked. Overall I am a fan of BJ's at the Paso Mall in Pasadena, and by my home in Vegas. This one I would avoid. Just something wrong with the whole experience."
Oro O.,"Burbank, CA",1,73,39,4.0,4/2/2007,BJ's serves my favorite desert from a restaurant:  Pizookie. Nothing like a moist chocolate chunk cookie right from the oven topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Delicious!
Paul I.,"Los Angeles, CA",59,21,19,4.0,7/25/2009,I went here for my birthday which was on a Friday night so there was a bit of a line.  I decided to get the California grilled chicken with steak fries since I was feeling like a sandwich and it looked good on the menu.  I asked for no Chipotle mayonaise since I'm not a fan of mayo.  We decided to get drinks so I got the porter which is a heavy dark beer.  After a little while we received our food and the food looked great.  The sandwich was good but I think there was some chipotle mayo in there and decided not to give a fuss.  Overall the food is pretty good here and I usually get the nachos when I'm drinking.  I wouldn't recommend watching a big sports game here because the TV's arent big enough.  The reason I say that is because you may get seated a bit further from the tv and then its hard to see.  They brew their own root beer which is pretty good too
Kris S.,"St. Cloud, MN",0,19,1,1.0,1/2/2013,"Any business open near Pasadena after the Rose Bowl parade should be staffed for crowds and BJs was NOT. We called ahead which only ""cut wait time in half"". After half an hour we placed a to go order and waited an hour and a half to receive tasteless cold pizzas, salads, sides, and chicken in the $99 package to serve 8-10."
Lea N.,"Duarte, CA",155,171,146,3.0,6/18/2009,"Food is always yummy-especially the avocado eggrolls! my only complaint was the rude waiter who serviced us at the bar area.He wasnt very attentive and acted like a total jerk. Other than that, the rest of the staff seems very friendly and the food/drinks are a-ok."
Bo F.,"San Gabriel, CA",1,39,,4.0,2/1/2011,If I were to rate their food only it'd be a 5 stars. But since these types of restaurants are a bit pricey I took off one star lol. First time I got a pizza with chicken and mushrooms as toppings. It was probably the best pizza I've ever had but very expensive. I tried the pizookie and thought it wasn't as great as everyone says. Second time I ordered their bbq pulled pork sandwich and it was really deliciouuus! The last time I got the best things appetizer platter and shared it with 2 others. It was good but I wish I was more hungry. I like the avocado rolls the best.
Melissa B.,"Pasadena, CA",0,8,,3.0,1/27/2013,"Fairly predictable menu; food leans more toward comfort food to me. Can be a little greasy and sometimes seems a little pricey for the quality, but it's an easy spot for a group of people.  They still have lines from time-to-time, so clearly people enjoy going back.  I'm included.  It's a spot that is good for a drink and some appetizers.  Not anything I'd want to do on a special occassion."
Nathaniel S.,"Duarte, CA",2,1,,1.0,11/30/2011,My gf had a birthday dinner recently at BJ's with 8 guests. It was a Saturday night with no reservations so our wait time of 45 minutes was expected. This is where the night took a turn for the worst. Our waiter Marcos C #895 seemed to be too busy to attend to our table and we had to constantly remind him of things we asked for. The worst part is that at the end of the night he would not split the check for the individual people even though we have done it many times in the past at that particular restaurant and with even more people. Everyone paid with cash and I with card with specific instructions to charge $32 to the only card that was presented for our party. We paid and left. When I get home I get a notification from my bank that $132 was charged and on top of that am additional $32 was charged to my card that night. We called immediately and spoke to the manager. He said we would have to wait until the following Tuesday to receive a refund. It is almost a week after that and I still have yet to see any credit to my account. Bottom line is that their employees are careless and do not even mention that they over charged you and charged you twice on top of that. I was most upset that I had to be surprised by the bank and no word from the waiter that made the mistake. Diners beware with your cards at BJ's.
Ann S.,"Arcadia, CA",3,10,,4.0,9/7/2010,"Literally located few steps away from my office. Great for lunch cos my friends and I always get the usual...1/2 sandwich and salad, which is only 6 bucks. They do have house beer specials, which is $3 and happy hour specials are good too. We did enjoy this place during the World Cup! Parking is a hit and miss cos of the other restaurants around and the Auto Club next door but just drive around and you'll find one...just don't take my parking space. Lol."
B D.,"Pasadena, CA",0,22,18,1.0,10/14/2012,"Wish I could give 0 stars. NEVER GO HERE!! This was literally the WORST dining experience I've ever had.  We went as a group of 5. 3 of us got there at about 1pm. By the time the other 2 of us arrive 30min later, they still have nothing at the table. I ask ""you haven't ordered yet??"". They say they ordered drinks 20min ago.  It takes 15 more min for our drinks to arrive. We sit at 2 tables, so we ask if each table can use a coupon, since we're separate bills. She says sure. One table orders soda, lemonade, mini pizza, & large pizza on one check. The other table gets soda, burger, & large pizza. About 10min in, someone brings the salad that comes with my burger & puts the pizza-holders on our table. 1hr later we still don't have entrees. The table next to us has sat, eaten, & left.  We've now been @ BJ's for over 1.5hrs. It's not even busy. When we finally get our food around 2:45, one of us asks to pay her part of the bill b/c we've been there so long that she needs to leave. We want to try the new raspberry pazookie so we order the trio-raspberry, Ghiradelli, & oreo.  After another 30min, it arrives & we realize we've been given the macadamia nut instead of the raspberry. We eventually flag down the waitress-who has basically ignored us since we walked in. We tell her we think we might've been accidentally given the macadamia.  She rolls her eyes & rudely says 'it IS the raspberry'. We reply that we can't taste or see any berry. She says 'they're just raspberry SHAVINGS'. We dig thru the cookie to show an obvious lack of anything berry, & she tells us they're in there but YOU CAN'T SEE THEM.  We then tell her it has macadamia & she says 'no, they're almonds'. We hold up a piece of macadamia & tell her that it has macadamia in it, so isn't it the macadamia one? She insists that the raspberry one HAS macadamia, so it IS the right one. We ask ""are you sure, b/c we thought it said it only had almonds"" & she replies ""NO, it has MACADAMIA NUTS"" ""and almonds?"" ""AND almonds"". We tell her that we can't find any almonds in it either, so it must be the macadamia one, & she finally huffs & barks ""so what, do you want ANOTHER one or something?"" ...yes, we would actually like the dessert we ordered (especially since that one was the only reason we ordered dessert at all!). SHOCKING. We get a menu from the front, & we're right - the raspberry only has almonds. Not only did she make an error, she ARGUED with us about it & BLATANTLY LIED to try to push the blame on us. What if we'd been allergic to macadamias? Would she have just kept insisting they were almonds?? She didn't apologize for the wait, the error, OR for blaming us for her error. She brings the bill 15ish min later-we still don't have our last pazooki.   She's put everything on ONE bill. Not only that, she's TOO LAZY to type a new bill once one of us had left, so THAT PERSONS'S mini pizza & lemonade are STILL ON THE BILL. She hands it to us & tells us to take off $12.95 (the cost of the mini pizza) & walked off. Totally unprofessional! The whole point of the bill is that it's a record of what you pay, not a random amount. AND even if we took off the cost of the mini pizza (& the lemonade!), the TAX for those items was STILL on our bill! To top it all off, instead of $4 off on each of our pizzas, she had only taken $2 OFF. We decide to speak to the manager. We explain everything.  Instead of apologizing, he says OUR COUPON IS WRONG, & that it's actually SUPPOSED TO BE $2 off a MEDIUM. Shouldn't his first reaction be 'I'm sorry your service today was AWFUL & your waitress LIED TO YOU & you've been sitting here for HOURS'?? We say no, it's $4 off & we didn't order mediums! He says again that we're wrong. We pull up the coupon on our phones-which clearly says $4 off a large or share-size pizza. At this point the CORRECT raspberry pazooki arrives - it looks, smells, & tastes totally different & has obvious red splotches of raspberry, NO MACADAMIAS, etc. He comes back 15min later with 3 checks. He says the trio will be free (we assume as an apology for the CRAP service we've had).  There is a bill for our friend who left & already paid, & bills for each of our 2 tables. He says the coupon isn't working, but he'll just take $2 off each bill (he crosses out the amount & writes an amount $2 less beneath it).  ....except that when he split them up, he put the original -$2 & -$2 on the receipt of our friend who left! So he took $4 off HER bill, but she had already PAID IN FULL, so she didn't get that discount! I ask about it.  He says ""well I GAVE you free desert for $9.45, so it comes out the SAME"". So the pazooki WASN'T free, b/c with the extra he charged us & the tax on that, we ended up paying $6-$8ish of that anyway. As we're walking out the door-more than THREE HOURS after the first of us arrived - a guy working at the front says ""So sorry about that, guys."" This is THE FIRST TIME someone has apologized to us THE ENTIRE TIME. RIDICULOUS."
Winnie L.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,6,1,3.0,10/3/2012,"When I get off work, and just need to relax and have a couple drinks and dinner, I always end up coming here. The food is pretty good, and they have happy hour. But the main attraction here has to be the pizookies! I always need to have one whenever I come. I usually sit in the bar area, so I never have to wait. However, it can be hard to get a hold of your server most of the time, because they are never around. That's the reason I only give this 3 stars. Also, I don't want to sound like someone who likes to complain at a restaurant in order to receive a comp, but every single time I come here, something bad has happened, where the manager gave us a free dessert. I swear I don't do it on purpose, but something wrong always happens to our food, whether it was cold when we got it or we found a hair in it. Otherwise, this place is pretty chill."
Jocey K.,"Monrovia, CA",49,428,,3.0,3/18/2012,"The food is really good here but the one time I came here I was not happy about the service. For one our waiter came up but seemed rushed. It was empty in the restaurant so I was baffled but got over it. A few minutes later he brings appetizer and then introduces us to our new waiter since I guess it's his break time. The new waiter was really freindly and only tasked with bringing our order out. So he brings our food but noticably missing is my entree. I waited and nibbled off the appetizers thinking it was just taking longer to cook the non pizza stuff. Finally when he came to check up I knew something was wrong. I asked about my entree and he said Oh let me go check if it's ready, he then comes back and says oh it was never put in,I'm sorry..would you still like it.  I mean HELLO,I was so shocked but wasn't starving because there was a mini pizza&appetizers still to eat off of. So I just said yes because I was looking forward to it. It came out but I really feel like he should've asked when he brought the food the first time if everything was here. Idk,if I come to this one again I will be watch them very closely. The food was all hot&good but that snafu really annoyed me!"
Brianna C.,"Temple City, CA",0,3,,4.0,11/11/2010,"Fantastic Chicken Wings!!! Amazing service, excellent.       Last time I went there, I couldn't get enough of their chicken wings, I ate it over and over again. Delicious hot sauce ranch dressing and their tender perfect chicken wings. Also, their pizookie...oh my goodness, the best ever! I especially LOVE triple chocolate cookie with chocolate ice cream, not too sweet and not at all bitter, it is delish!!!!"
Lizeth M.,"Pasadena, CA",1,18,12,5.0,5/5/2010,I hate the fact that I love a chain restaurant so much...and I constantly try new places but I end up coming back here at least once a week. Let me just add that I only eat/drink at the bar and only during happy hour.  Service is always attentive and the drinks are always delicious!
Benito C.,"Pasadena, CA",2,12,,4.0,3/16/2009,"This is one my regular happy hour spots. I do enjoy the whole brewhouse/restaurant market when it's done right. BJ's beers are great, though not spectacular when compared to other craft beers. However, their seasonal beers are something to talk about. I've tried all of their SOCAL offerings and have enjoyed them every time the season comes around. I wish that I lived near one of their actual brewing locations as the beer is fresher. The BJ's in Arcadia is nice and quiet. Its got everything you need for a good happy hour: cheap prices for beer and food, large televisions, lots of parking, friendly bartenders, no large crowds, and quick service. I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a decent place for happy hour with friends. Cheers."
Karolein W.,"Monrovia, CA",0,28,,4.0,6/19/2010,"The food has been consistently good here.  The pizza is really, really good.  I'm giving it 4 stars because it tends to be noisy, not a place you can have a conversation unless you're in the very corner behind a wall.  We'd go much more often if we could talk to each other over dinner, but I suspect the noise level fluctuates a great deal depending on the night of the week, the time of day, etc."
