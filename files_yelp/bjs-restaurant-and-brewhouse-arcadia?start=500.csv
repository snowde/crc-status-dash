Catherine C.,"Arcadia, CA",32,61,27,4.0,11/7/2009,"The food is fantastic, the servings are large, the menu is large, and the service is awesome. Someone tell me they have had the oreo cookie pazookie? Need I say more? Its a pizza restaurant, but everything they have is as equally good as the pizza, if not better. I suggest the baked potatoes (which are huge!!) The BBQ chicken pizza or the wedge salad. Yum Yum Yum. The only downfall, is the bar can get a little rowdy and loud."
CF L.,"San Gabriel, CA",44,70,42,4.0,10/24/2009,They have the best pizza in my opinion along with pizooki for dessert.  You also have to get the taster so you can try out their selection of beer.  Decent price and good service from the few times I've been there so I would definitely recommend it.
Erin A.,"Signal Hill, CA",79,7,,1.0,4/12/2010,"OK I am so VERY disappointed with BJ's and I am specifically talking about the Arcadia, CA location. I called in an order at about 2:15PM for a pizza and some pasta. The girl on the phone said it would be ready in 15 min. We get to the curbside parking at about 2:40 and call the number on the sign. The guy that answered was named Ross and he asked for the color and make of my car and said someone would be right out. Kid you not we sat there for 15+ min and no one ever came out. So we left and no one from the restaurant even called us to see what happened! Horrible JOB BJ's!"
Brandy L.,"Pasadena, CA",131,101,16,4.0,12/2/2008,"it was around 1030 pm when we decided we should go get some grub. the tv was on the food network.  there was something on about BBQ, which made us crave bbq.  So, we drove over to woodranch in the santa anita mall but they close at 10pm.  damn! so we drive over to tony roma's.  they were closed too.   we ended up at BJ's (yay for staying open until late on weeknights).  thank goodness we did.  their ribs are bomb!  the sauce is not too sweet, not to sour.  this is coming from someone who usually avoids bbq. wait, that makes me a bad judge?  ok, well my papi chulo was licking his fingers, and he likes bbq. our server was great.  gave us our extra cheese and green onion for our baked potato, kept our glasses full, gave us our extra plates so we could share the full rack of ribs, and was overall a cool guy. ...now you know about the bbq"
Monica N.,"Baldwin Park, CA",58,25,139,4.0,8/3/2009,"I go there w/a big crowd of co-workers all the time...food & alcohol is always good-but yup, about 75% of the time we're not satisfied w/our waiter...i gues they have to much on their hands 2 handle cuz we wait 4evr 2 grab their attention & wen we finaly do..they rush off & come back & fulfil our request about a min 2 late..then rush off again! Lol..they need 2 hire more staff for those busy days."
Jemdot H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,30,,2.0,11/18/2013,"My parents and I were trying to go to Olive Garden but the wait was too long. That's the only reason why we ended up here.  The food is decent, as far as chain restaurants go. But the service is horrendous. Actually, I'm  only talking about 1 specific waitress there. The others seem to be pretty friendly. She was an older lady (maybe 40-50 years old?). I only say ""older"" because most of the other servers there are young; teenagers or in their 20's. So if you ever go here and see a waitress that is older, overweight, brown hair, looks like she hates her life, then steer clear.  When she took our drink orders I already noticed something off about her. I asked her for an iced tea and she just stared at me before moving on to the next person, no response whatsoever, not even a nod, nothing. But magically an iced tea showed up at our table, so she must've understood what I was saying. Then when she took our orders, my parents ordered the $35 meal for two, which comes with a salad, a soup, 2 entrees, and a dessert. My dad said ""We'll have the $35 meal for two"", and then he paused and waited for the waitress to acknowledge this. She responded in an annoyed tone ""okay... and what?"" So my dad proceeded to tell her they wanted the caesar salad and minestrone soup, and she interrupted him and said ""no, what entree do you want?"" At this point, I was LIVID and about to cuss her out, but I didn't want to embarrass my parents.  He let her know what entrees they wanted, and she made them go BACK to the soup and salad. Really, you crazy beyotch? Sorry my dad didn't order his meal in order that you wanted, but you can't remember a soup and salad that was told to you literally 2 minutes ago? No wonder your life career is server at BJ's. She must've realized later what a bitch she was being because she did become nicer towards the end of the meal. 2 stars only for the semi-decent food and awesome pizookie."
Donna S.,"Glendora, CA",334,752,4899,4.0,6/13/2008,"4/28/08 Update: Wow. The ribs are good here. Tender. They come with a house salad and a baked potato. I thought I would trade out the baked potato for veggies. Meh, they tasted like over-nuked frozen veggies. I got the house salad with it. Remmber to ask for REAL lettuce if you chose this. It comes with iceberg. Also if getting the rib/chicken combo, it came with white meat. I am so done with chicken breast. Gimme some damn juicey dark meat."
C L.,"Rowland Heights, CA",0,4,,5.0,4/10/2012,I want you guys to understand that this is a 5 star review specifically because the happy hour is amazing here.  Mini-pizza's are $5!!!  Their Nachos with grill chicken is waaay superior compared to applebees.   If you only order those two things during happy hour BJ's is AMAZING.
Karla O.,"San Dimas, CA",206,104,11,3.0,2/26/2009,"We were seated rather quick! We thought it was going to be a long wait because there was a huge group waiting up front and more ppl waiting inside to be seated, but they took us in right away and led us to our table. That was a plus! =) The food is still good like always! The pizza's are so delicious! This time I got the cilantro pesto appetizer pizza! Thin crust European style 10 inch pizza, I ate the whole thing! It was filling, but not too much where I feel stuffed. Soup and salad combos are both good over here too, they have good caesar salads and the claw chawder bread bowl was yummy! The only thing I was not pleased with was the service. Our server was completely rude and was very pushy with us!! He seemed like he was in a hurry get us to order, eat, and out the door! We sat in a booth that is right by the ramp going up and instead of our waiter coming AROUND to serve our plates and silverware, he would reach down over the ramp and put it on our table! I didn't think much of it the first time he did that, but after about 5 or 6 times, I thought it was ridiculous. He almost hit me with the pizza holder when he grabbed...again over the ramp instead of coming around. Didnt even ask if i was done. Threw the bill on the table again OVER the ramp instead of coming around. What a dumb a**..... Tummy was satisfied, not satisfied with our service. We called the manager not to complain, but to let him know our feedback about the service. Manager was understanding and I do hope he speaks with his waters/waitresses about better customer service.  So with that, it was a good night with my best girlfriends, good food, bad service, we didnt cause a scene, just a simple call to management and we ended our night on a good note =)"
Jas G.,"Anaheim, CA",1,37,,3.0,12/6/2013,"I've been going here for years so I have a pretty good perspective. Unfortunately it has been going down hill for a while. I can't put my finger on it, it's really a combination of everything...the service and quality of food. Last time here we had a large party. Over half the group either sent their food back or didn't finish what they had because it wasn't as good as it used to be. We even called their corporate office to share our experience. The were very good and responsive. That is why we came back today. The menu has really grown. It seems like they have lost sight of what made them great. The beer selection is still great and good quality. The food is inconsistent. Some says it good others not so much. I have a child that likes Mac-n-cheese. They serve what I am sure is craft mac-n-cheese out of the box. Come on, I can do that at home. I'm sure I will be back because I am hopeful it will get back to the good old days... Just won't be there on a monthly basis like I used to."
Maria L.,"Tucson, AZ",14,265,28,3.0,4/24/2009,"This location is very happening...they're open pretty late on weeknights, I think til 12...and it's a good place to hit up for a drink or if you want to watch a game.  The food is good too, I'm just not crazy about deep dish pizza.  I always have the pizookie when i come here with the chocolate chip cookie.  It seemed smaller to me when I went the last time tho.  Their drinks are good too, I had a strawberry daquiri.   If your ever bored on a weeknight this is the place to go."
Patricia J.,"Pasadena, CA",0,13,,5.0,7/9/2011,"I love this place!!! I have eaten here for years and NEVER been disappointed with my meal. Some favorites: avocado egg rolls, sante fe salad, any pizza but spinach artichoke is especially good. I am also a big  fan of their beers.. Jeremiah Red is my favorite."
Gram L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,4.0,7/22/2013,"I finally answered my BJs craving for food!! I placed my order on-line & I must've changed it a few times, but it's easy to use. So I got the crispy jalapeno burger minus the pepper jack cheese & special mayo. There were a few of the crispy/fried jalapenos in it, & I ordered the individual vegetarian pizza. I had the burger. The patty was huge & it was tasty if you like lettuce, tomato, & onions w/ it. I couldn't eat it w/ the whole wheat bean because that alone was heavy. The pizza was smaller, way smaller than the box, & pretty basic - green bell peppers, mushroom, black olives, onions & of course cheese. You can add additional toppings for $1. If you're eating at home, it might not be worth it if you already have the extras at home.  Since I ordered on-line , I took advantage of the designated curbside parking spaces (2). The number is posted if you don't want to get out of the car, but I did even though my leg was messed up. I felt hot just walking in there, but the ambiance inside is really dark & romantic. Anyway, they were prompt w/ my order. I selected the 1:15 pm time slot & got there around that time, so 4 stars!!!   My expectations are high so I left a star out ( for myself for leaving a tip)."
Lindsay L.,"Arcadia, CA",23,138,,4.0,7/27/2008,"In general, I think all BJ's are pretty good with consistency and taste. Although I must admit the pizza is very doughy and lacks sauce, it is neverthless very good and of course, filling. The Arcadia BJ's is pretty good, although sometimes there's a long line. But that's how ALL BJ's restaurants are if you go during prime hours."
josh e.,"Victorville, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/20/2011,Horrible service.  Waited 1hr for our food and they got the order wrong. waited 1hr for our bill and it was wrong. waited another 45min for the corrected bill.
Angelica G.,"Duarte, CA",0,11,,3.0,2/25/2011,Pizza is delicious but RIDICULOUSLY overpriced.  The beer was delicious however.  My friend had the F-Alfredo and it was delicious as well. I'll get that next time better.
Jennie K.,"Alhambra, CA",159,96,82,4.0,3/7/2008,"Bj's is pretty cool. I love their Giant baked potatoes.. hehe... It's soooo yummy!!! my favorite appetizer is actually the Onion strings, but their appetizer menu is pretty big.  Let's see, yes, their sandwiches are awesome too... Service is great...but if might be a long wait on weekends."
Kim C.,"San Francisco, CA",68,256,,3.0,7/15/2009,"I've been here to enough to try a bunch of stuff on their menu. The sandwiches and pastas to me are mediocre. What I come here for are the pizzas! I love the deep dish style and I'm usually full after two slices. I recommend the BBQ chicken pizza, potato skins, and sliders. Their pazookies are pretty good too (mainly the white chocolate macademian nut and chocolate chip ones), although a bit on the sweet side. One of the few chain restaurants I enjoy eating at."
Cat T.,"Los Angeles, CA",180,545,21,4.0,5/16/2007,"Home of the Pizookie! A wonderful cookie baked in a 6 inch pizza tin hot out of the oven with a giant scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. The pizza here is okay. Not the greatest. Their barbecue chicken salad is pretty good. The rest of their food is a bit salty for my taste, but overall nothing stands out."
R M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",78,33,,4.0,1/28/2010,"As long as I have been going there the food is great, the deserts are awesome and the beer is hoppin. There were some nights that the food was not up to there standard, but I would go back."
