Matt C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",41,53,4,2.0,11/18/2007,"the very first time and maybe even the second and third time i went here the place was pretty good but the last probably half a dozen times i've given this particular bj's a go it was absolutely awful.  i kept giving them a chance assuming that there was no way that we could get horrible service and cold food that many times.  little did i know.  the waiters/waitresses were complete jerks, though i've never waited a very long time for my food there it always came out cold.  i'm not big on sending my food back just because i've seen far too many movies. other bj's are decent but this one i will never visit again - not a chance in hell."
Roseanne F.,"Temple City, CA",143,175,5,1.0,1/24/2009,"My daughter loves this place, so we try to go there a few times a month as a treat.  The last time we went there, it took FOREVER to get seated.  So, since they said that you could ""call ahead for priority seating,"" I decided to do that last night.  I called at 6:30 p.m. and tried to make reservations for the two of us for 7:30 p.m., and they told me that they didn't take reservations on a party of less than 9 people.  WTF?!  They didn't mention that ANYWHERE before, so I thought that was false advertising.  Anywho, they told me that even if they put my name on the ""list"" it would probably take a half hour to get seated when we got there.  Things are starting to sound worse, but I sigh *OK* and give him my name . . . like FOUR TIMES.  I spelled it out, slowly, phonetically, and he still didn't seem to get it but said he put us on the list anyway.  Can you guess what happened next?!  We got there and when we told the hostess who we were and that we should be on the list for 7:30 p.m., she looked for our name everywhere and it wasn't there.  She asked another guy who worked there if HE had taken our call, and he of course denied it.  They asked me the name of the person to whom I'd spoken and of course I didn't remember, so then I looked like a liar.  I do NOT think you should have this kind of ""priority seating"" program if you don't know how to do it right!  We ended up leaving and going to Chuck E. Cheese for pizza instead, which was a whole other mess.  Not the best night."
Ally S.,"Templeton, CA",10,100,9,4.0,3/15/2009,"This review rating is purely based on Nachos, Beer, and Pizza.  Huge fan of  Stone IPA and this is one of the few places in the area I've found that has it on tap - note, if it is removed, I shall revise my review.  (I wish there were an ""on tap beer"" search engine.)  I usually go after work, sit at the bar, and order some nachos or pizza... mmm.  The place is wrought with out-of-towners - not too many regulars it seems, but I should swing in on the weekend to see for sure.  The other thing I hold onto in my review is the bartenders, and Charlie will take care of you!  I like the cozier feel of this BJs compared to some of the other ones.  Parking hasn't been a problem during the week.  The menu selection is great, anyone can find something they like.  Oh, and with all the out-of-towner business men, it can sort of be a pickup joint -- watch out ladies, unless that's what your into (I don't wanna know)."
Rya L.,"Stanislaus County, CA",117,211,19,3.0,2/11/2007,"american food with a hint of italian. their pizzas are great...and their artichoke dip and avocado eggrolls are yummy...but that's about it. quality of the food is so-so...mostly a big hit with the beer drinkers because they have a variety of house-brewed beer. this place is good for big parties, and make sure you reserve days ahead or else you'll be waiting an hour or so at dinnertime on the weekends...not really worth the wait, but if you have no choice then you're outta luck!"
