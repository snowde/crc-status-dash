Alonzo B.,"University Town Center, Irvine, CA",18,9,3,5.0,6/21/2017,Great food and service! That ziti I ordered was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. The ambiance was nice and had multiple nice size screens where everyone can be entertained. Great place for a family dinner or a business lunch.
Justin B.,"Monrovia, CA",2,10,3,1.0,12/2/2016,"Not sure the last time i got a delivery 2 hours and 15 minutes  after ordering, if im lucky, its not here yet....  but this is a good time to mark an issue with an establishment, only order with them monday through thursday i guess... guess i need to talk to jack the manager,  because after getting our order 2 1/2 hours after we ordered it, you would think our bbq chicken salad would come with bbq sauce like it always does... plus a pizza  that is hot, not room temp... sucks when you expect so much more... spinach artichoke dip room temp by this time too, just as a side note, (i guess)... By the way, i went to reheat leftovers the next day and realized the pizza was all toppings and no cheese after i picked up a slice and everything fell off, and i was left with was a  triangular shaped piece of soggy  bread in my hand... not kidding!!!"
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,2.0,12/18/2015,"Did not love. Place was busy and noisy, not good for holding an actual conversation. Server was all over the place, had to wait forever for refills. The pizza would be the highlight here, I prefer the thick over the thin crust. Prices are pretty high for the quality that you get, very much your average chain restaurant, not worth returning."
Ramon G.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,2,5.0,6/16/2017,"Paul was our server was awesome.  Great service, excellent quality food and reasonable prices all in one package."
Thor H.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,5,5,3.0,5/26/2017,"Update: Oct. 2017 Visited this location last week and had the appetizer platter. It was actually quite good. Service was great, must have been an off day the last time I came.  Just finished eating here. Been to BJ'S a number of times. Two stars because the appetizers are okay, the pizza is pretty good, and I like the white cheddar mashed potatoes. Just had the new ""treat yourself"" brew house slow roasted menu. It come with the prime rib and let me tell you....not impressed. Tastes kinda similar to cafeteria meat. I mean I understand it's BJS...but still what a disappointment. So basically don't ""treat yo self"" to this meal.  My friend had the kale and roasted Brussel sprout salad. She had to send it back because the salad had a strong and pungent pickle taste. I don't know if it was the Brussel sprouts that were pickled...but I will recommend if you're a pickle lover and looking for your fix, this salad will do the job."
Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",107,2372,8712,3.0,1/18/2015,"I remember years and years ago when this BJ's restaurant opened. It was really busy and quite popular. BJ's had amazing pizookies and incredibly large baked potatoes that could feed you for days.  But gone are the days of those gigantic potatoes and quality of food (well at least for some of their food items)... and now fast forward to today... I have not been back to this location in over 10+ years until just last week. I came twice for two separate to go orders and ordered the following: Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad, $9.75 prior to tax- I really enjoyed this salad, but wasn't a fan of the goat cheese and red onions (I only like cooked onions, never raw). But aside from that, the flavors and textures in this salad was excellent. The dried cranberries and grapes gave this salad a nice light sweetness and the candied pecans had a nice added crunch. I also liked the Brussels sprouts were cooked well and not charred like they are at other restaurants.  Shrimp Scampi Pasta, $16.25 prior to tax- This was one heavy cheesy and creamy dish. Definitely not a heart healthy entree, but I did like it. The garlic bread served on top was nice but I could do without it. I was actually surprised with the amount of shrimp you get in this pasta dish and the size of the shrimp. More than expected (most seafood dishes are usually pretty skimpy on the seafood). New Orleans Jambalaya, $16.50 prior to tax- This dish was good, it was quite hearty and filling with the chunks of chicken and sausage. My husband and mother also enjoyed this dish as well since the portion size was plenty for more than one person.  Honey Lime Seared Scallops, $14.50 prior to tax- I liked the scallops in this entree but it did not have a honey lime flavor to me. Scallop naturally taste wonderful so really there is no need to add anything else to it. I wished there were more asparagus in this dish but it was good and the brown rice was made perfectly.  Balsamic Glazed Chicken, $14.50 prior to tax- The chicken was moist and pounded thin. This entree came with 2 thin pieces which is perfect for sharing. The mashed potatoes were buttery and creamy. The crispy fried onion strings were also a nice touch.  Barbecue Bison Burger with Baked Potato as side, $10.25 prior to tax- I really liked this bison burger. It was cooked perfectly. I liked the pico de gallo on the burger and the chipotle barbecue sauce wasn't too spicy for me.   I would have rated this BJ's higher if it wasn't for the customer service. Both of these to go orders were made on line. It is nice that you can pick what time you would like to pick up your order. On my first visit to pick up my order, I was quite disappointed to see my salad just sitting out on the counter instead of being placed in a refrigerator to ensure that my salad is nice and crisp. But aside from that, pick up was easy. But on my second visit, it was on a Wednesday evening and they were pretty busy. Instead of my food being ready at the time quoted on line, It ended up being ready 30 minutes later. Also since I was using a coupon on this order, I had to wait a long time for a manger to come and approve the coupon (only managers can do this and not employees). The manager even was making it a little difficult to use our coupon at first and asked where did I get it... as if he was questioning the validity of my coupon. And people in line before and after me had the same coupon (it was a buy one, get one free entree coupon which I got in my email box because I joined their rewards club sometime back).  So thus, a 3 star rating is rather fair for my last 2 visits.  By the way, this BJ's restaurant is located in the same plaza as The Olive Garden (also across the street from Souplantation). The parking lot does have a lot of parking, but you may not be so lucky to get a spot right in the front if you come on the weekends here. Try finding parking in the back."
Jon M.,"San Dimas, CA",4,23,1,1.0,12/9/2015,Ok guys this is a mess.  I come here all the time after work and tonight.  I getting ready to leave and the bartender drops a glass of something on top of me and I am covered with red sauce. Arm. Stomach. Leg. The works. I ask for a manager and he tells me he is sorry. Not good. Not enough. I am now told by Shea Vasquez that he cannot help me and his General Manager is not here.  This is a mess   My custom shirt is a mess. I look like a mess. I have have been turned down for a 150 dollar gift certificate. Oh. And I paid my 22 dollar bill. I await the call from the mystery manager.   Do not spend your money here if they will not to trigger by their mistakes.
Eunice K.,"Los Angeles, CA",552,443,2559,3.0,6/26/2016,"Came here to enjoy happy hour with coworkers. Unfortunately, everybody else was there for happy hour! Happy hour is only served if you can find a seat in the happy hour area, and it is first come first serve. We had a big group and it was a bit difficult to find seating.  Good news is a lot of things (foods) are half off! I was able to order the mini pizza for $6, originally $12 for 50% off! I also got a $1 off my glass of riesling and my coworkers were able to bank on the discounted drinks. Of course one of the best things about coming to BJ is their pizookie. Always the most perfect ending to any meal!"
Chris C.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",0,2,,2.0,6/28/2017,"Today was my best friend's birthday and we wanted to have a nice lunch at the Arcadia location of BJ's. The meal was fine and at the time my friends and I enjoyed ourselves and the servers. As we gave the check to our waiter Mike, we told him the exact change was given so he would not have to go through the hassle of calculating change. As we were about to leave we left a $12 tip for our waiter on the table since he was kind to us at the time. Know that we are high school students and are already struggling because most of us do not have a job. Anyways as me and my best friend waited outside for our other friends to finish using the restroom, Mike (our waiter) stormed out of the restaurant claiming that we did not leave a tip for him. He yelled and I quote, ""Was service not good!? Because there was no gratuity left in the bill!"" He stormed back into the restaurant not allowing us to explain ourselves. We were shocked by his statement since we did give a tip, and we are still insulted that he would accuse us of not being grateful. After leaving the restaurant our day was ruined and my best friend's 17th birthday at BJ's is now something we will all regret. Now we are all seriously questioning whether to go to BJ's ever in the future."
Sara J.,"Azusa, CA",76,5,,1.0,5/4/2017,Medium well steak. That does not mean raw in the center. Twice now I have sent a steak back bloody and gross. Medium well. Cooked please. Ugh.
Wendy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",258,32,30,1.0,9/3/2016,I ordered the Barbacoa Chicken entree which states  it comes with brown rice and I got white rice.... 1 star for inaccurate description.
Ben A.,"Arcadia, CA",4320,743,1968,4.0,10/12/2014,"For many years, Arcadia has tried to build up a downtown area. This has proven somewhat problematic, in the sense that Arcadia is a fairly spread out town.  The business centers of the town tend to string along the 210 freeway to the north and south, with residential areas tipping a few miles below and up towards the foothills. With such a diverse community, it never surprises me that in this so-called downtown area, one can find restaurants with foods from every corner of the planet.  Korean barbecue, sushi restaurants, Chinese bistros, Italian delis, and good old-fashioned American bars... To name a few. Back in the early 90s, this particular restaurant was a Bennigan's. The menu and bar were roughly similar... and like BJ's, it was a popular lunch spot for Arcadia's professional community. One nice thing about BJ's current menu is that it does offer several options in the low calorie but not low on taste department. Of course, I mitigate this potential caloric savings by ordering something blonde cold and bubbly.  That said, this is a casual and laid-back place to have a drink or two with friends, take a second or third date, or just sit at the bar and watch whatever's playing on the giant TV. Service here is always awesome.  They take good care of you, and on your second or third trip, they will remember you.  They used to have a lunch special called the Nooner. The marketing might have changed on it, but you can still get that deal... Plus there's something lowbrow humor enjoyable about asking your server for... Well you get the idea. Parking can be a little tough around the lunch hour, particularly with several restaurants right next door, and office buildings behind.  Best bet is to go in one car with several buddies and enjoy your time there."
Valerie P.,"Glendora, CA",409,29,62,2.0,12/27/2016,I came here yesterday around lunch time with a friend. It was not too busy. The front hostess was bewildered as to where to seat my friend and I so I suggested that we seat ourselves at the bar. It took forever just to get a glass of water but we were finally helped. It took forever to order. We finally got our food after waiting for several minutes. I ordered a lentil soup and when I took in a spoonful I found a pebble and almost cracked a tooth. The manager apologized and took the soup off the bill. The server was not that friendly and looked stressed out. The service is not that great here and the employees look miserable including the manager. This place makes me sad. I won't be back.
Janelle Marie G.,"Duarte, CA",54,11,,1.0,5/19/2016,"I was here 2 days ago for a birthday dinner. My boyfriend & I ended up getting food poisoning. My boyfriend got it as soon as he got home & threw up for multiple hours until the morning. I got it the next day. He ended up going to a store the next day to get me Gatorade & crackers... He was talking to a cashier at the store & another customer over heard that we both got food poisoning from this restaurant & the specific location. The customer that overheard the conversation said that she was a former employee from here & that they would get a lot of calls about food poisoning. It's a restaurant. No matter how careful a restaurant is it is unfortunately bound to happen. But the fact that a former employee said they would receive a lot of complaints is pretty disgusting & scary. I've gotten food poisoning before, but this one feels much different. Almost like something bad is sitting in my stomach & HORRIBLE cramping pain. I will not be going here again & if you were thinking of going, I would examine your food first especially from reading other reviews of dirty plates. This is what led me to write a review because obviously things aren't being done as thorough as possible."
Kimi T.,"Arcadia, CA",697,2,,3.0,9/15/2016,"I have always love Bjs, but tonight's meal has disappoint me. My buddy of mine ordered and waited over 20 minutes for strawberry lemonade and still nothing.  I ordered 16 oz steak, side of baked potatoes, and side of asparagus. The baked potatoes and asparagus were 5xs better than the steak itself. The steak was extremely salty, I have never tasted anything so salty before. Thank god, I had a couple drinks so the meat was bare able but after a bit it made me lose my appetite.  The service was eh, so she received one star. The drink got one star and as of the third star; its for the baked potatoes."
Jillian H.,"Arcadia, CA",155,2,,1.0,11/11/2017,"I came here around 10:30 with some of my coworkers on a Friday night. I will admit that we can sometimes get loud and that can be seen as obnoxious, but we all work in a restaurant so we go out of our way to be good guests when we dine in other restaurants. Firstly, we placed our order and waited for 45 minutes, and someone in our party had to leave before the food even came out. This person has just ordered a mini pizookie, so we requested that they just package it to-go so he could still get home as soon as possible. They brought out a broken, mashed  up cookie that looked like someone had chewed it up and spit it back out. We sent it back and he had to ask for a refund and leave without even getting to eat anything. Throughout our entire visit, our waitress, Nicole, was incredibly sassy and short tempered with us. She provided the bare minimum in regards to basic customer service. Once again, all of us work in a restaurant and are fully aware of the struggles of working as a server, but we also know that there are supposed to be standards for customer service. I am VERY dissatisfied with our experience and honestly, I don't think we will be coming back. (Note: this was NOT my first experience like this at this specific location)"
Nicole M.,"Arcadia, CA",251,2,,1.0,6/22/2017,"It seems like everytime I come into this BJ's location, the service is absolutely horrible. It takes way too long to be waited on. Today when I came in with some friends to just get pizookies, our waitress Kristen was just very unfriendly. She seemed annoyed. And this isn't the first time this has happened. I've had her as a waitress before and she is just not the most pleasant person to have. You come to Bj's to have a good time and go out with friends, not to be served attitude with your food. We forgot to ask her in the beginning to split the check so we asked her to do it at the end and she gave us the dirtiest look. She acted like she didn't want to do her job. She let out a big sigh and was very blunt and rude. It took her about 15 minutes to split it and when she came back with the checks split we thanked her and she didn't say a word to us, just walked away. We were never once checked up on throughout our whole time here. I honestly believe that she needs to take a class on customer service because there was absolutely no good or even half way decent customer service given here. This was just an absolutely horrible experience. If you ever get Kristen as a waitress, ask to switch."
Kayla B.,"Arcadia, CA",0,11,3,1.0,6/21/2017,"This honestly shouldn't even get one star but that is the lowest the review can go. My friend and I ate here mid afternoon when the dinner rush had not yet come in. When we were greeted by our waitress, we could tell right off the bat that she was intoxicated on something as she didn't say anything. She stared at us until we initiated our drink order. Once we got our food we asked her for one more ranch and some refills on water. It took two more times to ask her then I had to get up and ask her coworker because she ""forgot"" about us. Her service was consistently horrible amongst her other tables that the girls next to me even asked if we thought something was wrong with her. The manager did not offer anything to us nor did it seem that he even understood how bad it really was. We left without a waitress, and an apology. To top it off she added a whole other table's order to our bill. I will personally never go back."
Tony T.,"Pasadena, CA",0,2,,4.0,3/13/2017,"I've always a great experience going to this BJ's.  The servers are always very friendly and attentive.  Although the food is generally appetizing, people normally go there for the atmosphere."
Stacy P.,"Temple City, CA",8,18,1,1.0,2/9/2017,"Pulled into the parking lot and it was practically empty. I was happy because I figured that meant a short wait. It was pretty quiet inside the restaurant as well. The bar was bumping, but other than that it wasn't very busy. So, why did the hostess sit us in a tiny corner where we were practically sitting with another family?! I understand having to sit with other people when it's really busy, but there were only 2 groups in that section and they made us sit in between them! Not even a table separating us? We could here every word they said and see every bite they were taking! Hint: some people like a little breathing room when they eat. We got up an left because it was so uncomfortable. I will stick to the BJ's in Montebello."
