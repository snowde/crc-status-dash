Joe D.,"Midlothian, VA",2,64,1,4.0,7/1/2016,"Pizzookies are the way to end the night. Warm personal pizza sized cookies with ice cream.  Overall, the menu is a little daunting... Sometimes less is more. The burgers are good, decent beers... Just expect a long wait on Friday and Saturday night."
Melanie H.,"Arcadia, CA",0,4,,5.0,3/12/2017,Bjs is great! It never disappoints! Love the pumpkin seasonal beer! Chicago style pizza without the flight! Highly recommend! Love their lettuce wraps! The chicken is so moist and the dipping sauces complement so well. However my very very favorite are the PIZOOKIES! They are to die for! The best is the cookies n cream/Oreo pizzokie or the traditional chocolate chip! The other amazing pizza is the Hawaiian with canadian baconand pineapple! Everything here is so delicious and worth visiting!
Josephine C.,"Los Angeles, CA",92,425,1832,3.0,7/11/2015,"I went to try their Peach beer at dinner time on a Saturday night.  The waiter took us to the bar area next to 2 crying babies.  I told the waiter I rather sit somewhere else.  So we sat in a better view of the bar.  I hate it when all the tables are crunch up together that I have to hold my breath to sit in the small table.  Good service on refill of water and beer.  The food was good too.  By the time we were leaving, long wait to eat there."
Anne Marie S.,"South Jordan, UT",57,295,187,3.0,10/17/2015,Order food for takeout. I wasn't too bad. You can't really mess us wings but it wasn't all that good. The place was crowded. It didn't take too long to get my food. Dessert was good.  It was just OK.
Jo C.,"San Gabriel, CA",66,8,11,1.0,3/22/2016,"I ordered a medium size pizza, half great white and half build your own. Yes, I had 6 toppings on my pizza, however, I did not expect to see absolutely NO cheese and all my toppings just roll off of my pizza. As I shared my concern with our server, Brittney, she shared how she was not one who made our pizza and scoffed as if we were Ridiculous for being dissatisfied with such a ""delicious"" no cheese, crap filled pizza. It's obvious she was not working in the kitchen and Is our waitress, however, with such a terrible attitude and service... I will just leave it at that. At that moment, I wish she was in my position because she was Clearly disregarding my con cerns. I don't choose to pay and visit restaurants to receive crap food and terrible service."
R W.,"Arcadia, CA",0,10,,1.0,10/14/2016,"Ordered takeout of a large soup and some potstickers. So why 1 star? A) 30 minute wait! Seriously, how long does it take to ladle some soup and fry some potstickers. B) It cost me $19! C) The large soup is only 10 oz!  It came in such a small container, I had to confirm that it was the right size, and she said yes. They have a regular size that's even smaller. D) Bad service! First server barely took her eyes off the register, asked me my name,  ignored me for a minute,  then schlepped me over to the second server, who did not acknowledge me whatsoever. I waited a few minutes while he worked diligently on the register for some other issue,  then he finally said hello and took my payment. Then he schlepped me over to a third server with instructions to go get my order. Third server shot the breeze with a fourth server for a few minutes, then decided to go to the kitchen. Finally,  a fifth server came out with my order. All in all, I'll come here if it's the last option. Just not worth my time,  money,  or headache."
Brian L.,"Orange, CA",243,120,35,2.0,5/1/2016,"This place is a typical bj's. Food is the usual and service is fine. Was having a fine night until the bill was requested. I asked the waiter if I could apply the $10 off $35 on my bill. He didn't know how so he went to ask his manager. The manager comes over to my table and tells us that our bill doesn't add up to $35+ before tax like we were idiots and we couldn't add. I calculated everything before hand and I pointed out that the bill was missing something. The reason why I'm giving this rating, which should be lower, is because of the poor attitude the manager exuded toward my friend and I. You're a manager. It is your job to make sure everything runs smoothly and to treat the customer properly and with respect instead of treating them like idiots. And I'm not sure if what it was exactly but my friend and I had stomach aches after."
Eric C.,"Arcadia, CA",159,91,24,5.0,11/12/2016,Got takeout here. Great service from Rachel. Prompt and professional! She was extremely professional and got my order down perfect. I would definitely get take out from here again. Thank you Rachel for the great service!
Raul P.,"West Covina, CA",185,4,,2.0,3/30/2016,"Uh! Service was slow and it wasn't even that busy. My steak was way well done when I ordered med/well and then when we ordered dessert it took way too long to be served. I ordered two scoops of ice cream. Really does it take that long?!?! And no mention about the unusually long wait...  It wasn't all bad though, but definitely not up to the normal standards."
Delina K.,"Azusa, CA",316,91,135,3.0,9/3/2016,"Come here often and normally have a good time with good food and drinks. Service is normally great as well. However, your only as good at your last visit. Today was rough. Got seated quickly which was great, server was so sweet however the rest was just a huge disappointment!! My buffalo pizza was so awful! Service was so slow and they were not even very busy. It took 20 min to even check t see if we were ready to order and 45+ min on a slow night to even get my Luke warm pizza. Overall, don't know if I'll come back here."
Stephanie L.,"Alhambra, CA",49,42,22,2.0,12/4/2016,"I love going to the BJs for their calm chowder bread bowls. Last time I came, I ordered the late night burger and it was absolutely deliciously. So I came again today for the burger. My boyfriend had the hickory bacon burger. We were going about our meal until he found a hair in his food. It was disgusting. He didn't want to make a big deal out of it. In the end, he told the manager about the hair. The didn't even apologize, or at least it was not genuine. Now I have a feeling that a hair is in mouth. It didn't leave a pleasant taste. I know for sure, I will not come back."
Stevo O.,"San Gabriel, CA",197,627,975,4.0,3/12/2015,"This is the best restaurant for service and food.  I joined up with the BJ Club and found electronic coupons for appetizers and specials.  I feel this chain of restaurants really focuses on customer service, as I can tell from the waiter (Alex) and all the others I've encountered.  Although you would consider this a sports bar, it has qualities of high end restaurants and is great at training their employees about service and kindness.  To speak of food, the quality is up there with other major chains and is served with quality and quantity at a reasonable price.  I had the Lemon Thyme Chicken which was probably the most delicious healthy food I've ever had.  My wife opted for an appetizer of Thai lettuce wraps which were also well seasoned and delicious."
Joy R.,"Seal Beach, CA",10,113,346,5.0,3/6/2015,"AWESOME way 2 kick off the weekend!! Food & service were OFF THE HOOK...in a GREAT WAY!!! Special shout out to Antonio for EXCELLENT customer service. My Mom & I split the newest Deep Dish Veggie Pizza. Wonderful surprise to have Brussel sprouts & artichokes on our pizza.  Mom loves mushrooms so Antonio made sure we had some on it. WELL DONE, Antonio!!! We finished our meal w/ a Beignet covered in ice cream & strawberry sauce. It was like a Strawberry Shortcake on steroids!!! Great suggestion from our server. We'll be back :)"
Cassandra D.,"Monrovia, CA",0,3,,4.0,1/6/2017,The Spicy pig is a family favorite.  Thin crust pizza and they don't skimp on the bacon and ham. Really great service even on a busy Friday night.
Ivy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1536,1308,2750,3.0,1/20/2016,"I still remember the days in high school when I first discovered and fell in love with dining out and thought BJ's was one of the cooler chains. Back then, I used to frequent this place often although my friends and I obviously didn't meet the minimum drinking age. I hadn't eaten here in eight years or so, until recently, for drinks and a basketball game with a few friends. There are plenty of beers on draft (they're a brewery after all), a full bar, and plenty of bar food and large entrees to munch on. The food is okay, nothing to complain or write home about. Dessert menu is decent, as they offer their famous Pizookies (a scoop of ice cream over a freshly baked ooey-gooey cookie), and other tasty desserts such as their beignets, which are surprisingly good. The servers are mostly nice and friendly. During our last visit, the kitchen messed up on one of our orders and somehow forgot it or something, so management comped an appetizer. We didn't mind about the mess-up, so it was a nice gesture."
Gloria R.,"Downey, CA",506,455,2299,1.0,1/11/2014,"I hate giving a business such a terrible review but this was such a disappointment, especially for a chain that I frequent quite often. After our hike we had built up such a hunger and decided on BJ's to feed the beast! We had a party of 5 which isn't too large but they had a difficult time seating us. They tried to stuff us in a table for 4 by adding an extra chair which would have made for a tight squeeze. We told them we wouldn't mind waiting for a booth and proceeded to wait. This was just the beginning of our disastrous dining experience.  We started off with the sampler appetizer platter and the plates that they brought us were dirty. So we asked to get a few clean ones, but upon return the newer ""cleaner"" plates were just as dirty as the ones we returned. We didn't even bother to ask for new ones and opted to just not use them.  We each ordered our food, I chose the California Chicken Sandwich with wedge cut fries. We waited quite some time before our food came out. When our server came around to check on us after such a long wait I asked for a water with lemon and when she returned the lemon looked as if it had been chewed and then thrown in my cup. Yuck! The food that I ordered came out cold, the bread was mushy as if it were sitting for awhile. I didn't even want to try and send it back, first because our server was nowhere to be seen and second because of the length of time that it would take to get a new plate. I didn't finish it to say the least.  This was terrible all around and I won't be back."
Charlene C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1498,929,5247,2.0,1/17/2014,"I have to admit that I've been here a lot, only because it's super close to my work.  I try really hard to avoid this place and try suggesting other restaurants, but BJ's ends up being the ""default"" place to go to.  Been here mostly with large groups anywhere between 6-15 people in our party. I've also been here with my husband since we had a gift card.  A majority of the time, the food takes SO LONG. It doesn't matter if we get there early either.  The service can vary. Most of the time, you feel neglected. The food doesn't come out all at once. Other times, the service is pretty good. I usually order from the lunch menu. I've tried their AYCE soup/salad , personal size pizza, sandwich, BBQ combo. Most of the time, I find their food salty and just ""eh... it was okay."" BJ's has their Premier Rewards card and the servers will try to make you sign up for it. You can earn points every time you go there.  At the end, I'd really avoid coming here and wouldn't care if I never ate at a BJ's again, but I know I'll end up here again. Someone at my work will end up choosing to come here for lunch (taking consultant to lunch, someones birthday...etc.) The only thing I truly enjoy though are the Pizookies... 15/100 Reviews for 2014."
Kurt T.,"Arcadia, CA",372,300,643,2.0,8/20/2016,Nice place to chill and have a drink or two as well as grab some food at the same time. The waiter was average but he seemed to get annoyed but I don't blame him. I am not sure if the barista knows how to make alcoholic beverages since the mix of drinks did not taste right for a variety of drinks. They also give very little alcohol in their drinks as they add almost 3/4 cup of ice. As for food I ordered the potato skins which were very flavorless. I felt like I was eating a plain deep fried potato. I will give them credit for their avocado egg rolls. The plum sauce complimented it very well and the avocado just made it taste amazing.
Andrew M.,"Covina, CA",531,2,,5.0,12/28/2016,Luis and Anthony provided the best service we've had at BJ's by far!!!  Thumbs up to Colette for great service too.  it's not easy serving for a party of 30 Magallanes's!!!
