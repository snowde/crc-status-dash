Jenny N.,"Arlington, TX",89,14,9,5.0,8/16/2017,"I came in today since today was the last day for their $10 off with a purchase of $35 or more! I ordered the Grilled Chicken Alfredo :) it was really good!!, but my parents said it's too creamy lolol *shrugs*  I forgot the name of the waiter :( but he was extremely nice and patient (my family takes a long time looking at the menu haha) and he always came around from time to time to check up on us.  This place is a really great place to try out. I've only dined in a couple of times - two times with my family, and two times for a tennis banquet LOL"
Michelle P.,"Philadelphia, PA",431,1145,4420,3.0,1/4/2018,"Having never heard of a BJ's Brewhouse, I was excited for the brewery-pub concept. After visiting, I essentially see it as a TGI Fridays that happens to brew their own beer somewhere in the world.  After being shut our previous dining attempt for the evening closed early, we made our way to BJ's. There was a wait so rather than crowd into the lobby, I hit the bar. They had a few of their own brews on draft, in addition to some craft brews that are pretty common to find throughout the US. I opted to try their season Grand Cru. It was pretty standard as far as Belgian Strong Ale's go.  It was really hard to connect with the bartender to settle up and get a glass of water once the table was ready.  Having already eaten a large snack, I was opted to just go with the tomato basil soup. It was salty but better than a canned Campbell's. I used a friend's roll to dip into my soup since it's didn't come with bread. There was nothing wrong with anyone else's meals, they just weren't overly exciting.  Our server was friendly and pleasant, but wasn't the quickest during any step of the way. Aside from the service, there wasn't anything wrong with our experience, it just wasn't exciting, special or worth a return trip by any means. Since nothing was wrong, I won't give them two-stars, but consider this review a low-end three."
Lisa A.,"Tucson, AZ",1,4,,3.0,12/11/2017,"I have always liked bj menu and what it has to offer. Usually get burgers they are fantastic, I decided to go out on a limb and get Santa fe salad, I always get this when I go to Chilis,  I was disappointed here. The salad was premixed, meaning it come with chicken, but they mix it up so you really can't tell how much or in this case how little came in the salad, the menu says avocado come on it also, I found 2 small pieces the size of my fingernail. They flavor was good, but I will not order this again from them, did not think the salad was worth $13. Our service was good, my husband did order a burger and they forgot to put the bacon on it. The waitress brought it promplty, so service was good. I guess there's room for improvement in the kitchen"
Phuong V.,"Arlington, TX",20,146,65,1.0,9/2/2017,We love eating here but tonight our waitress never checks on us. No ketchup Tabasco sauce or anything because she just doesn't show up. Our food comes out and its not her and I'm geting a bit frustrated as I write this review.  Appetizer is cold and not crispy. Just fed up with this place now. My wife won't eat her clam chowder without Tabasco. Our entree was out before we even had sauce. Can't even eat.    Will not ever come back here.
Adrian O.,"Waxahachie, TX",7,10,6,4.0,1/5/2018,"To start the wait was an hour. It was a Friday however I would recommend more bar tenders to serve people waiting for seats just a suggestion. We were seated we all ordered drinks and they were out in about 10 minutes. We ordered an appetizer and house salads out first, egg rolls were not that great. I ordered a ribeye recommended by the waitress with mash potatoes, asparagus and the mac and cheese, also ordered a glass of wine. The steak was supposed to be medium however it was cold in the center and the Mac and cheese was also cold. I asked to speak to the manager. He came and was nice offered to pay for my steak and replace it I said I didn't was another one bc they reheated mine again so it was fine, he also gave our party free dessert. Therefore I rated a 4 star the kitchen needs to ensure food is cooked properly. The manager was very respectful and accommodating. I will come back soon."
Corey R.,"Grand Prairie, TX",52,116,318,4.0,10/5/2017,Food and service usually isn't bad here. We like to sit on the far end of the bar because you can hear about the latest drama among the wait staff.  This place is a chain and rather corporate but it's not a bad option on a busy afternoon of errands. The bartender is always friendly there too.
Daniel C.,"Irving, TX",15,50,76,3.0,5/21/2017,"We went in and got seated. We waited for our server for at least 5 minutes before my girlfriend went to go ask for one. This was only a problem because we saw multiple servers walk by helping out people around us, but skipping us every time. We weren't that hungry so we just got an appetizer and a dessert. Cheese sticks, which tasted as they should, and a Pizookie, which ended up being thinner than what is seen in the picture. My girlfriend wanted something sweet so we mostly came for the Pizookie, which had a bowel that was deceiving to make it look like there was more than there actually was. Overall a disappointing trip, but the server was nice once we got one. Food didn't taste bad, but nothing outstanding either."
Ryan E.,"Arlington, TX",51,188,61,1.0,12/26/2017,"Hate to give BJs a bad review but this location has the worst customer service. Curtis, the manager the night I was there, was very rude and inconsiderate to our party. When we asked to resolve a situation with our food, he was very hesitant to do so. When we finally had enough and asked for a refund, he stated it would be a lot of trouble and went on about the hassle it was for him. Finally, we got a refund but one of the wait staff informed us rather than Curtis. Avoid this location unless you don't mind dealing with a manager who doesn't like to be wrong."
Anna R.,"Fort Worth, TX",11,226,1114,4.0,2/21/2017,"Not a huge fan of their pizzas or pastas, but there's something I always come here for -- AVOCADO EGG ROLLS! These are simply amazing. If you like avocados, you'll definitely love this!  Came here one afternoon just for the Avocado Egg Rolls but ended up getting the Fried Calamari as well. Didn't expect much but was taken my surprise. It was really good! I'd get it again.  And of course... their Pzookies! It's basically a cookie straight out of the oven (oozing hot) with an scoop of ice cream on top. It's always nice to end the meal with a great dessert :)"
But N.,"Irving, TX",196,16,64,5.0,7/26/2017,"I have been here MANY MANY times because my girlfriend LOVES the pazooki here. I'm not sure why the rating at this place is average because I always had a great experience here Decor/atmosphere --5/5 - This is a great place for a date! The lighting is kind of dim and they have tables/booths -There are TVs with all the sport channels just in case you want to catch a game -Also great place for large groups Service--5/5 -The servers are always attentive and I never have to ask for refills -Very professional services -Only downside is that the food some times take a while Food-- 5/5 -The food is great here! It is a little pricey -For appetizer I suggest getting the Hawaii flatbread!  -I normally get the chicken Alfredo pasta! It's great and the Alfredo sauce is just right -The deep dish pizza is also great for sharing -For desert, we ALWAYS get pazooki!! This thing is so simple but sooo satisfying! It is basically a hot cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top.  Will I come back? Definitely! Been coming back multiple multiple times! Love this place"
Dee N.,"Grand Prairie, TX",5,45,116,4.0,10/19/2017,Great place! Especially during NFL season they have so much happy hour. The food was great we had the best spaghetti ever it was such a huge plate I had to take half of the food home. The pork chop was awesome it was done medium rare if your okay eating it that way. The seasoning on the pork chop was awesome. The waiter was awesome he came around the clock and made sure we was good and brought our drinks and food out pretty quick.
Jen L.,"Carlsbad, CA",5,20,32,4.0,9/17/2017,"I swung by BJs for a quick bite after doing some shopping at the Highlands. I'm no stranger to this location, it has been consistent, clean and accessible for the most part. Our server Jonathan M. was so attentive and patient even though he was extremely busy so kudos to him. I had the bbq chicken salad and he had a jalapeno burger, both were delicious of course. Overall no complaints about this BJs except the menu did feel a little stale but then again if it's not broken don't fix it right? One last thing if you have money to spare please donate to their cause for child hunger and you receive a free pizooki card. Keep it up BJs!"
Demetria C.,"Dallas, TX",401,244,1847,1.0,10/9/2016,"My friend Lisa and her husband were in town from Atlanta  & we decided to try out a few bars.  BJ's was our 2nd stop & I must say I've never felt more rushed in my life.  We informed our waitress that we were only having drinks & didn't need a food menu.  For some reason she appeared upset by this.  I thought that was strange but let it slide & continued to enjoy my company. After our 2nd round of drinks the waitress dropped off our check.   Everyone at the table was shocked.  We were very friendly to the waitress & for some reason she appeared to be in a terrible mood the entire night.  It felt as if she wanted us to chug our drinks and get out.   I've enjoyed BJ's in the past & this was my first time at this particular location.   I hate to judge an establishment based on the actions of one individual that was obviously going through something in her personal life & maybe unknowingly took her frustrations out on her customers. But come on now, please don't bring the check before asking your customer if they are ready for it. We were planning to spend a lot more $."
Lisa B.,"Arlington, TX",28,5,,4.0,12/16/2017,"BJ's is my go to place for a great mix of cuisines.  Service can be spotty but only in very busy times.  Love the Mediterranean tacos with grains on the side.  Perfect portion and the cucumber yogurt sauce is yummy.  I had the Spicy peanut chicken with soba noodles recently and it was very good.  I love their pizza as well, both the deep dish and the flatbreads.  Beer choices are interesting and my kids love the root beer.  Sadly, they stopped serving their seasoned wedge cut french fries which were the absolutes best fries ever.  I miss them terribly and have stopped ordering anything with fries on the side.  If I'm going to splurge on fries, they need to be worth it and unfortunately, the replacement fries are just average.  Sports bar atmosphere can get very loud but overall it's a fun place for a nice meal."
Laura J.,"Fort Worth, TX",3,30,13,5.0,9/20/2017,First time I came here I had an issue with one of the servers not wanting to take my coupon but the manager Paul was amazing at hearing my concerns and helping me come back to give hem another chance. 2nd time came with my parents and had an amazing time. We received excellent service from Renee. She helped my parents navigate the menu and find something they both liked. I am impressed at their commitment to service here and the food is great too! There is something for everyone in their extensive menu. For desert we had the peanut butter pizookie and it was delicious! Will be coming back for more!
Alex A.,"Coppell, TX",244,142,250,5.0,9/10/2017,Elizabeth was awesome! A group of 4 of us went after a concert on Friday night and had a great experience. All the food and drinks were great. Highly recommend Elizabeth as a waitress too. Their no calorie peach tea was the best I have ever had!!
Emily M.,"Grand Prairie, TX",23,120,88,4.0,4/8/2017,I always loved BJs but the location where I used to live had sucktastic service.  Today we had the best service at the highlands location. We had our drinks and starters within minutes of ordering and the waitresses never let us be without anything.  Will come here again.
ken k.,"Mansfield, TX",10,16,,5.0,12/30/2017,"We love this place.  We eat there at least once a month and it is consistently good.  Their salmon, pizza, jambalaya, desserts and everything else on the menu we have tried is always very good.  We have never had a bad experience or a ""down"" time.  Good service, good brewery selections and excellent food make this one of our ""go to"" places."
Debra R.,"Grand Prairie, TX",16,3,6,5.0,9/11/2017,"BJ Brewhouse. This place is good. I love it. First time here great service. Good food. Y'all gotta try the churro pizookie, it's to die for . Lovely setting feels relaxing and great place for date night or bring the whole family. I don't have one complaint about Bjs."
Brian C.,"Washington, DC",82,16,10,5.0,11/10/2017,"The environment of the restaurant was very clean. The wait staff was fast and proficient on our food order. Good presentation was on point, and very delicious."
Lona S.,"Dallas, TX",1,8,6,1.0,7/17/2017,"This review is in regards to the take-out section of this restaurant. This is my second unfortunate contact with Alyssa M in the take-out section. Her attitude is bad and her customer service is terrible.  I place a to-go order and asked for no lettuce. When my order came out it had lettuce; so, naturally I informed her of this. She rolled her eyes and then went to the back for about 3-4 minutes and came back with my sandwich. I asked her if they had just removed the lettuce and her reply was (with an attitude), ""there was no lettuce, it was just a little piece that was stuck on the sandwich!""  Excuse, but there was lettuce and you just admitted to such.  I asked her if her name was on the receipt and she replied it was so I asked for my copy. She then tells me I don't have your copy, again with an attitude. I inform her that I gave the gentleman that I paid with both copies of the receipt. She then goes, ""well, maybe he has the copy because I don't!"" She again travels to the back. However, this time I hear her talking to people in back about how it was just a little bit of lettuce on the sandwich and that she doesn't know what it was a problem or why I was acting like a ""bitch""  Are you serious? Is this the kind of service that anyone would deem appropriate? You got my order WRONG! When she finally came back out with my receipt I asked to speak with the manager and I informed him that i could literally hear everything she was saying in the back. He shrugs like this wasn't an issue, but then said sorry."
Kevin T.,"Mansfield, TX",73,114,216,4.0,1/7/2017,"Our dinner started off absolutely fantastic.  Was greeted well and seated within 15 minutes. But, we went to the bar first to settle down with a nice drink.  Andy served us very well.  Our waiter at the table was Casey.  He greeted us within 30 seconds.  I was extremely impressed with him through our mealtime.  As for the food? We started off with the Avocado Eggrolls.  They were perfect.  I also ordered the sirloin with the roasted Brussels Sprouts and Asparagus.  It was all good.  My wife ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Salad. It was FANTASTIC.  Our full dinner experience was great.  This BJ's does it right.  4-Stars. They deserved it."
Rhonda H.,"Grand Prairie, TX",24,14,13,2.0,7/26/2017,My last trip to BJ's was probably 6-7 years ago. We went on Sunday 7/23. We had a large party (14) for my sisters birthday. They didn't want to seat us until 90% of the party was there. Understandable. We get settled into our seats. They arranged the table for 7 people on each side. We were sitting really close to each other. The waitress was prompt on getting our first round of drinks. It took a while for her to take our food order.  The restaurant was probably about 85 degrees inside.  We were all fanning ourselves and pulling our hair up.  The food starts coming out for half the group. About 10 minutes later the food for the other half of the table comes out.  By this time I'm literally sweating and ask for a to go box. It was too warm in there for me to enjoy my meal. 2 people had undercooked hamburgers. The waitress went and had one of them remade.  It was obvious the waitress needed help since she was unable to come by to refill drinks.  The manager acted like he was going to get our refills but our waitress returned with drinks.  It took another 15-20 minutes for the birthday girl to get her pazookie.  Maybe we will try again when there are fewer of us.
Emmy F.,"Fort Worth, TX",131,143,818,2.0,5/4/2017,"Used to go here quite a bit when in college. Would bring family over too when they visited and they really enjoyed the food. I will still say the food is pretty good, but service was pretty atrocious, hence the 2 stars.  I don't give a lot of bad reviews, but the service was that bad that I think it deserves it. We essentially felt ignored majority of the time. Waiter seemed a bit on the rude side too initially. When I asked for a certain hot tea he was quick to say that the only thing they had was regular tea. Then he checked his thing and realized they had it. He thought they had run out since they didn't order any previous week..... but I thought it wasn't right for him to say it was out straight up right away. Already put me at edge with the guy. There was a large group he was taking care of as well, so I understand he was busy, but he never checked on us, never stopped by real quick to see if there was anything, never asked someone else to check on us, and didn't even look at us. We were legit ignored for a straight 30 min. By the time our food came out, it was either room temperature or cold. A different server brought it out for us, and by the time she came back with more hot water for my hot tea, we asked her if our food could be reheated. That's when I believe the manager came to us and started taking care of us too. When our food finally came out it was hot enough for us and we were pleased with the food. Had the Thin crust classic pizza, as well as a club chicken sandwich and a bowl of the clam chowder. I have nothing to complain about with the taste of the food but wasn't happy when it initially came out (obviously). We also had room for a mini monkey bread pizooki which I really liked. The atmosphere is great at BJs too. A lot of TVs, my friend wanted to watch a basketball game with some beer and BJs is a great place for that. Lots of drink options! Prices are maybe a tad bit over fair but had we had good service I would've been content with the price. The thing that disturbed me the most is that when we got the ticket, they had taken off the price for the meals and said ""guest recognition"" but then the meals were charged a 2nd time anyways. I'm not saying I expected a free meal at all, but why did you bother putting that in my receipt in the first place just to charge it again and make it he same price it would've been?? It seemed a bit RUDE to have that. I may sound a bit on the prissy side but seriously, why bother with it anyways? We did however get our mini pizookie for free. I do appreciate that. However enough damage was done. There are plenty other places where I can get the same atmosphere and better service. No thank you Rocky and Damien. I'll eat elsewhere. So disappointed."
Trang T.,"Arlington, TX",174,20,3,5.0,10/7/2017,I was a bit hesitant to try bj's because of all the bad reviews but I'm so glad I did . I thought the food and the service was great !! We started with the fried calamari although it was a tiny bit under fried I still  enjoyed it . I had the ahi tuna salad which was great .. super refreshing. My brother had the clam chowder bread bowl and my daughter had the mac and cheese with a side of fries . I picked off everyone's food and liked it all . No complaints.. I guess I was expecting worse but everything was great . Pizookie are only 3 bucks until the 15th of this month !! Go get you some !! Delicious! I had the all chocolate one ... oh man .. my belly was happy .
King G.,"Mansfield, TX",0,39,2,4.0,7/30/2017,"Pretty good food, great service. Of course the pazookies are awesome. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere."
Ramiro L.,"Dallas, TX",1,21,2,3.0,7/5/2017,Hands down one of my favorite places to eat. Plenty of options and amazing desserts. Always a good atmosphere going. Family friendly and a great bar! Their beer is amazing and a great place to watch sports! Everything from the chicken wings to the breaded crusty chicken breasts is great !
Ivan F.,"Daly City, CA",0,12,10,3.0,6/30/2017,"This place is hit or miss most of the time. Going there almost once a month they will either serve delicious perfectly seasoned / perfectly cooked steak or tender fall off the bone ribs, while other times i'll have overly salted steak, and bone dry ribs. Definitely dont ever try the country fried steak though, that thing was just gross. Overall, i guess depending on how the cooks are feeling that day, that will determine how good your food is"
Gigi E.,"Arlington, TX",125,131,238,3.0,8/13/2016,"Not impressed. Sure it's Saturday foodies and yesssss I'm at another chain but have always had better food here at BJ's.  Flat bread Pizza soggy and the salad was boring, the sad bowl warm. I ordered Chicken Cobb but it had no taste. Not even with salt and pepper. Feeling bummed."
Chuck M.,"Fort Worth, TX",1281,673,344,4.0,8/10/2016,"It was lunch time and Terry and I didn't want to cook so we headed out for a quick lunch. We like BJ's since it has an extensive menu, yummy selections, and good service. Plus we knew some of the big screens would be tuned to the Rio Olympics. We were following several of the competitions and didn't want to miss the end. My wife ordered a side salad and I ordered the ""Twisted BLT"" salad. We also ordered the small bites of the fried Portobello mushroom slices to share. Even with the small bite plate there was plenty to share. Service was brisk and the food was awesome. We love BJ's and will continue to be a customer."
Brian M.,"Arlington, TX",0,15,9,5.0,6/3/2017,"Omg, just had the new couscous Mac & Cheese. The best I've had anywhere. Del Frisco's and Eddie V's, take note.  Tumeric cauliflower, awesome.  Enlightened menu is awesome.  Menu keeps changing and it's great."
Dani M.,"Dallas, TX",181,25,583,2.0,12/28/2016,"Went as part of a birthday dinner for a family member and while our waiter, Tyler, was great, it was very clear that they were understaffed and no one really seemed concerned about it, least of all the manager. The wait to get our table took awhile, but that was understandable because there were quite a few big parties also there at the same time.  Drinks took a long time to finally get, even just water and soft drinks. Our alcoholic beverages took even longer. One never even got delivered (a bottle of Corona) and two Margaritas had to be sent back because they weren't made properly. Since it was taking so long, they were taken back to the bar directly by us and the person that was actually behind the bar was rude and seemed to be insulted that we didn't like the drinks. Though we finally got the Corona at least. The food took an incredibly long time to finally get. Some of the food was cold by the time we got it. But we were all hungry so we ate anyway We had to request the manager 3 separate times (one time before we even got our drinks, in this case the water and cokes. Once after we finally received our appetizers but before we'd gotten our drinks, and the third time was before we ended up taking the drinks back to the bar ourselves) during our visit before he finally stopped by our table. When he got there he didn't seem very concerned when we were explaining our concerns nor he did he even so much as apologize for all the waiting. He basically just kept insinuating that none of it was his fault because he was called in to cover someone else and he personally hadn't made the schedule so it wasn't his problem. He comped the margaritas, only after he was told we weren't going to pay for something we didn't even drink. He didn't apologize for the service or being understaffed, he didn't apologize for the long waits, he didn't even offer to take a couple percent off for such a long wait. We got seated around 7 and didn't get our food until closer to 9.  All-in-all, I probably won't be making plans to visit BJ's anytime soon. Our waiter was nice, but the manager wasn't nor was he helpful. The food is expensive and I could get the same thing elsewhere for less."
Jessica P.,"Arlington, TX",2,24,33,3.0,8/27/2017,"Went here last week on lunch time on a Tuesday and it was alright. They have a huge menu to choose from. We got a white sauce pizza and a few appetizers. The garlic knot was awesome and also the clam chowder. Those are the only two things I would come back for more but other than that, everything else was mediocre. The only thing we didn't like was the service. Hostess was on her phone facing other side and didn't notice us until we said hi. She sat us at a smaller booth but we ask if we could have a bigger one so that we could sit together but she didn't say anything, just started walking and put the menus on the table on the other side of the restaurant then walked away. We thought that was a bit strange because how could you be all grumpy when you're the hostess of a restaurant. We didn't care much but just thought that they should have a smile on when working in restaurant industry because that's what matters most. Another thing that puts us off was that before they bring out our food they gave us two plates to share, it was all wet and dirty we completely lost our appetite, despite the fact that we were very hungry. I recommend to order take out next time you come here just so you don't have to deal with all of these."
Lili S.,"Arlington, TX",158,82,101,4.0,2/23/2017,Curbside pickup is the bomb!  I ordered the chicken club sandwich and it was sooo good! Also got a peanut butter pizookie for dessert I prefer the cookies and cream better
Shay L.,"Cameron, NC",0,96,44,5.0,5/31/2017,"Excellent Tomato Basil pizza and Tuscan soup, root beer flavored ribs, amazing!!! Steak under seasoned and when they brought another it was overcooked and dry.  But overall, great experience and atmosphere. The supervisor accommodated for the steak."
Randy R.,"Dallas, TX",1,9,9,5.0,9/10/2017,Went to BJ's this afternoon for lunch with 3 others. Quick and speedy service. Waitress was very nice and checked in to see if we needed anything. Our food was brought out and I had something missing. I ordered a lot but she still recognized something was missing and in 1 minute had my food out to me. Great food choices and great customer service.
Roger S.,"Shreveport, LA",26,29,22,4.0,9/9/2017,"A sort of sports bar with great food and interesting craft beer. After a Rangers game we met friends for a light dinner and drinks. Fantastic clam chowder and pizza. All food coming out of the kitchen looked good to me , and I was no longer hungry! Several tv screens to watch sports, but the drinks and food are some good!  We will be back!"
Katrina S.,"Grand Prairie, TX",83,10,1,5.0,8/12/2017,Second visit to BJ's. Both times service was impeccable. Good was delicious and we left happy. I ordered ahi tuna salad and it came out great. My son ordered grilled chicken alfredo and he cleaned his plate. Will visit more often
Hoda T.,"San Francisco, CA",1,47,5,3.0,7/6/2017,"It was the only place open at 11pm. The jambalaya was extremely salty, siracha chicken wings were too greasy and the Asian salad had way too much dried egg noodles. Average bar food. Good service."
Joanna T.,"Fort Worth, TX",35,279,55,2.0,11/26/2016,"Our server was HORRIBLE. She was so slow- if you didn't give her your requests on her first visit then you can forget about it every getting to you. She took forever to refill our drinks, bring our other request. She forgot to bring an entree and didn't bring one of the sides to another entree. I also ordered my burger without certain condiments and all of them were on there still. The food was pretty good and so are their fries! But overall it was just a horrible experience due to the lack of good service."
