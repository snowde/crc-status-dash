Tarra T.,"Chicago, IL",97,231,158,3.0,9/8/2010,"BJs is a great chain with a good selection of domestic and international brews. Went here on a Tuesday night for their 1/2 price wine special and ordered the Riesling which was a good choice!! Also ordered the chicken pesto and margarita flat bread pizza. Excellent choices. Great place for after work happy hour or dinner with friends. Our server, Tanner, was nice and quick. I have no complaints with this place."
Cass D.,"Dallas, TX",5,30,4,3.0,12/5/2011,"Went to BJ's with the hubs on a Saturday afternoon. The place was pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait. We were seated right away at a small table for two and we had a great server named Shannon. Looking around, there was a noticable age difference between me and the hubs and the rest of the crowd. Most of the tables were occupied by patrons over the age of 50...this didn't seem to be the place for us. But we stayed.  We ordered: Spinach Dip-Do not order this. It is bland. Really, really bland. We tried adding salt and pepper, but all you can taste is cream cheese. Our server took it back and gave us another appetizer instead. Avocado Eggrolls-These were ok. They are served with a sweet sauce, and you need to dip them in it. They are completely lacking seasoning without it. The texture reminded the hubs of a boiled egg. Portabello Pizza-Not so good. I could only eat one slice off a mini pizza because it was so doughy in texture. There was absolutely no crunch or any other texture besides mush. It was advertised as having a ""drizzle"" of balsalmic, but this thing came SWIMMING in it. The pizza also needed more cheese; all I could taste was sweetness. But honestly more cheese wouldn't have saved this thing. Regular Burger-This was very good. It was moist, had good seasoning and was cooked perfectly (medium well). It was served with shoe string fries which were very crispy and not at all greasy.  I originally ordered raspberry tea, but I ended up with some kind of pink lemonade. I didn't complain because it tasted good.  I didn't have a good experience with the pizza, which everyone else seems to like, so I wouldn't recommend it, but the burger was good. Just be prepared for the portion sizes. The burger alone was big enough to share and the appetizers could feed 4 people!"
Alisa B.,"Van, TX",9,59,14,4.0,7/14/2012,"I have been here multiple times and LOVE the pizza...the avocado egg rolls rock too! The customer service is hit and miss, but the food is usually good. A lot of people go here at night during the weekends to have drinks, but it is not to crazy for the kids. I had a couple instances where I had to send the pizza back because the crust was raw, but they cooked me another one quick and with a smile...no complaints. Love the food,"
Sean V.,"Foley, AL",67,40,16,3.0,2/8/2010,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is another typical restaurant chain. the food is OK. The service can widely vary.... this particular location was satisfactory though for a Sunday afternoon. I wanted something light so I got the Avocado Eggrolls. They were decent! I'd definitely get them again. My GF got the Pot Roast sandwich which I had a bite of... It was good too. A friend had the Chicken Parmesan and I tried some as well... not bad... I actually tasted real Parmesan cheese! Washed it all down with a few glasses of Iced Tea which the wait staff never let get empty.... very nice! Prices are a little bit higher then I feel is fair for the food, but I do understand that you pay for the other things like the decor, plasma TV's on just about every wall... etc.etc."
Adam B.,"Grand Prairie, TX",59,187,35,4.0,5/3/2012,"The stars of this show are the tomato bisque soup in sourdough bread, and the macaroni & cheese.  If you haven't tried them, you're seriously missing out.  I frequently visit BJ's with the same bunch friends.  The service is very good and so is the food.  They have great drinks too.  I really like their bloody marys.  But make sure to tell the bartender to mix it up.  The first one I got there had all the vodka on the top (and I was drinking it with a straw). Sufficed to say when I was done with the tomato juice portion of it, it was too strong to finish. :)"
Selena B.,"Arlington, TX",0,6,1,1.0,12/12/2012,"HORRIBLE Experience, Thoughtless and Inconsiderate Manager. Arlington Texas location 455. Was there for dinner with my family a party of 5. We thought we ordered a hand tossed large pizza but mistakenly the classic which is usually a hand tossed else where is actually a deep dish at this restaurant. We eat here about once a month but had never ordered pizza, we have a couple of favorites that we usually stick to but for tonight we felt like trying something different. Well it took about 40 minutes for our main course and we were hungry from Christmas shopping so we dug right in and we didn't know the difference until the bill came. It was only a $4 difference but when speaking with manager Jennifer Crenea she told use that since we ate the pizza we had to pay the higher price. Our bill was $111.94 and I was only asking for an adjustment of $4 because the waiter did not inform us that classic meant deep dish which is not the case at any other restaurant. Then she went on further to say, ""I don't know what to tell you"" when I tried to explain that she was risking the loss of 5 monthly customers who spend over $100 each visit over a $4 issue. She didn't care. Well my family and I will most likely never return. And this mgr couldn't care less about the lost in profits from our family nor did she care about me sharing my experience with my PTA, Dance, Cheer, Choir, Mathaletes, or Girl Scout troop moms whom have all met for late lunches and meetings here. Not anymore, We will be looking for establishments who actually care about their customer's experience."
Cherie T.,"Kemp, TX",77,13,8,5.0,5/9/2012,I love this place! I recommend the Mediterranean pizza. Have never had a bad time at BJ's.
Eric E.,"Ferris, TX",20,101,36,4.0,8/13/2009,"Great food and good beer! Their deep dish pizzas are great! You could go there every week for a year, order a different thing each time, and still not cover the entire menu before the year was over. That is how diverse their menu is. Very busy place and somewhat noisy, but that would be expected with the environment they have established. Eaten there several times and have only had one ""hiccup"" with the food still being a little cold. Sent it back (to be warmed up) and manager comped the entire check! Outstanding service!"
Cheryl B.,"Dallas, TX",0,14,,1.0,4/15/2014,"Incredibly disappointed in this location.  Our party of 27 was turned away; while that's a chance you take with a no-reservations policy, we called twice during the week to provide ample warning, and arrived over an hour before we'd asked our guests to come for my birthday dinner.  I adore BJ's burgers & good beer, but my money will now be going to the Chuy's down the road who graciously accommodated our group at the last minute."
Kathryne P.,"Round Rock, TX",18,29,4,4.0,12/1/2011,"Always great food, usually great service. Just don't go during peak hours."
Aaron H.,"Los Angeles, CA",48,64,17,4.0,6/20/2009,"BJ's has the most awesome deep dish pizzas anyone could ever want. You also have try their deserts, this place rocks.  Go hungry and leave stuffed."
Terry D.,"Cleburne, TX",0,63,,3.0,2/17/2009,"I've been to BJ's several times for various events-- parties, meetings, or just hanging out with friends. Every time I've gone, there has been a wait of at least 45 minutes. And I'm not talking on Friday or Saturday nights-- I'm talking on your random Wednesday or Thursday night at 8PM. It's definitely not a place to go if you're on a time constraint. The menu is wide and varied. They have everything you can imagine here- from pizza to chicken to salads to massive potatoes you practically need a saw to cut through. All the food is decent. This would be a good choice if you have a group that just can't decide what kind of food they'd like to have (my all-time favorite menu item is their sourdough bread bowl of Tuscan Tomato Soup, but I digress). I've never had a problem with the waitstaff, but keep in mind that this place is HUGE and normally very busy, so it takes awhile to get your food. Also keep in mind that this a sports bar, so it tends to be pretty loud with TVs blaring in the background and people occasionally breaking into random cheers. Not exactly a cozy environment, but I guess it all depends on what you're after. All in all a good experience-- good, not great. It might be a better experience if not so time consuming."
Vic H.,"Keller, TX",57,33,21,2.0,7/8/2011,"Their food is tasty but their service is slower than molasses in January.  Also, if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, plan on waiting a long, long  time.  So bring a book and don't go while you're hungry."
Michelle M.,"Arlington, TX",19,9,32,2.0,8/19/2011,"GREAT FOOD.....LACKS SERVICE.  Our medical office staff frequents a lot of restaurants in the Arlington Highlands in Arlington, Texas on Fridays as it's the only day we can all have lunch together, and BJ's is one we've come to enjoy for lunch-hour prices BUT today we had a bad experience. How are offices expected to maintain their ONE-HOUR LUNCH when it takes the main course 45 minutes to get out to the table? This is the second time we've had this sort of experience there. Last time we had more time. At any rate, we asked for management this time around and she comped our meals. We had 8 minutes to get back to our medical office. THANK YOU to the manager who didn't give us her name or a business card at least for doing that. We did ask for the checks previous also but to no avail. Hoping that our next lunch hour experience is better!"
Steve J.,"Duncanville, TX",0,18,,5.0,7/1/2013,"Girlfriend and I went there for our two year anniversary, great beer,,,outstanding ribs which we had to take home they were so large and excellent waitress Nicole.  What more can you ask for!  We will definitely be back!"
Michael B.,"Weatherford, OK",0,8,,1.0,7/20/2012,"My wife and I found a dead spider in our food. We alerted our waitress who sent a manager over. The manager said ""oh, that's so embarrassing"". We got the wings for free."
Cynthia D.,"Arlington, TX",0,57,,3.0,2/22/2011,"Even though it is a chain, it is a place we like to frequent probably because of the beer selection. The bar service is friendly."
Sara H.,"Richardson, TX",109,11,,5.0,12/21/2010,"My favorite thing to get here is the brew sampler.. nothing beats micro-brews w/ dinner.. try their chicken crisp salad, it's super yum for health nuts.. the Berry Cider here is awesome too!!"
S V.,"Arlington, TX",0,20,,5.0,2/16/2013,Amazing avocado egg rolls....juicy tasty italian meatballs...five meat gourment pizza was amazing. ..though I doubt it was deep dish...tasty nevertheless...the wait staff was kind too....
Kay L.,"Dallas, TX",6,126,200,4.0,8/13/2012,"Beeeerrrr, goooood food...you should be convinced right there. Long wait on a Friday night, but it's in The Highlands, so that should be expected! We had a large party of 9, so we waited for about an hour and a half. We had drinks at the bar and watched the Olympics. Bar service was slow, but they were very busy! Had their house margarita, which was good and super fresh from the lime. Once we got seated, we had calamari for appetizer. Everything came out very hot, which can be tricky with a large party! Very tasty. Ordered the portabella mini pizza with whole wheat crust for entree, paired with a light beer. The pizza could have used more toppings, but was good overall. I sampled everyone's entrees: jambalaya, margarheta (sp?) flatbread, wings, california burger, veggie burger, and a few others. Nothing disappointed! They have an extensive menu, so we'll be back. Brandy was our server, and she did a great job. You'll be pleased if she serves you!"
