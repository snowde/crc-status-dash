Rimshaw H.,"Mansfield, TX",3,23,7,4.0,11/22/2016,"Their chocolate pizookie is a must try for dessert. The atmosphere looks Tumblr-ish with the dim lights and cute chandeliers. The waitress I had was very nice and checked on our table a few times. Great service, loved the dessert."
Ki P.,"Dallas, TX",0,5,,3.0,6/27/2016,"I have always been a huge fan of Bjs  since my friend took me to one. So when i finally had a night off my husband and I decided to go celebrate here at this Bj's. The food and drinks were Great! They both came out at decent amount of time, seeing as how busy the place was. The only complaint I have is the fact that our server took forever to come by and when he did he dropped water off and left and then took him another 20 minutes to even come by back again to get our order. It would of just been nice for him to at least swing by real quick and tell us he'll be with us as soon as he can. We will still go back next time we're up in that area again. Keep up the great work and amazing food!"
Alan N.,"Arlington, TX",59,19,56,5.0,9/6/2015,"My wife and I decided to try a place we had never been before on our date night.  We sat in the bar area and were immediately met by our waitress, Megan.  She was very enthusiastic and willing to help us decide on drinks and food, giving her opinion on it all, which she did in a very friendly way. Our drinks were brought and they were cold and very good. The only funny thing that happened was that our entrees got tongue table before our appetizer did, but it all worked out in the end. I had the Jambalaya and it was a very good sized portion and it tasted very good. My wife had a salad and also decided to use the appetizer as part of her meal. All in all we give BJ's and Megan a big thumbs up!!!!!"
Tooba M.,"Grand Prairie, TX",1,5,9,2.0,1/31/2016,We come here a lot and love their pizza and pazooki but was really disappointed by their service tonite. As soon as the waitress (Elizabeth) found out we were only here to get dessert she had an attitude. No eye contact and no greetings she didn't even ask us if we wanted to drink something just brought out our dessert and didn't bother checking on us in between. Took forever coming to take our check at the end. We did not tip her!
J F.,"Wilmington, NC",1,49,4,3.0,4/22/2016,"Good beer, weak service. Good place to grab a beer and a bite...in the bar. This was my third strike taking a 10-20 person group to the restaurant. The service is consistently bad. Received wrong drinks, extra drinks, cold food, missing food. The server served my beer to another person, we both tasted and rejected what was served. Server swapped out drinks and emphatically insisted that it was no problem to drink out of someone else's glass. Calamari arrived 60 seconds after ordering. It was cold. Other apps showed up 20 mins later. One dinner was served 30 mins after everyone else's. They did credit that one."
Christina N.,"Madison Heights, MI",0,33,11,5.0,12/3/2016,"We tried this restaurant because we found the buy one get one coupon. We went on a Friday night and only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. Our server Randa was fantastic. We asked for menu suggestions and she gave us preferences from each category. I had the Parmesan crusted chicken and it was juicy, flavorful and enough to fill me. My mom had the sirloin and it came out cooked perfectly and was melt in your mouth quality. Definitely save room for dessert! We had the trio sampler of the pizookie (salted caramel, Oreo, chocolate chunk). We couldn't choose a favorite. All of them were spectacular! This is definitely a perfect place for the family, a great atmosphere and amazing food!"
Tony S.,"Arlington, TX",145,761,55,3.0,5/11/2014,"Ok restaurant, w/ ok food.   Restaurant is nice & clean.  The waiters are fast & friendly.   I thought my deep dish pizza was just ok.  Not near as good as Uno's pizza.   With that said, everyone else in our group really seemed to like their meals."
Kathy B.,"Grand Prairie, TX",50,3,,1.0,5/31/2016,"First visit to this BJs, have always had good experiences.  Not this time!  We ordered unsweet teas, had to ask for sweetener.  My hubby ordered a burger & fries, I ordered ceasar salad & clam chowder in a bread bowl. Salad was great.  Hubby's burger took a long time & was just warm, & fries were room temperature.  I got broccoli & cheese soup!  It took awhile to get our server's attention. Then it took awhile to get my soup.  It was hot when it arrived.  The manager did come by our table,  apologized & gave us our meal for 1/2 off.  I hope this was an isolated incident!"
Bree K.,"Duncanville, TX",57,36,5,1.0,1/18/2015,"We arrived and was told it would be a 30-min wait for our party of 18. It took an hour because they did not have enough waitstaff to serve us. Our one waiter was working a party of 18, a party of 6 and a party of 12. It was horrible. We were there for 3 hours!!!!!!! Then our waiter stated that they only had ONE server bringing food out to all of the tables!!!! Ridiculous!!! Then to top it off, a lady sits down next to us with her husband and a freaking dog in her purse!!! Her husband pulls the dog out and starts petting and playing with it at their table!!!!!!!"
Andy A.,"Springfield, MA",0,10,,2.0,5/30/2016,"The hostess had an attitude, she did not greet us at the entrance and took us to our seats, she wasn't nice at all. Our waitress however was really nice, helpful and attentive. Food wasn't good either, I ordered the ribeye, it came all burnt with the burnt taste. I was very surprised of how bad this BJ's in this location has become. Not recommending it."
Steve C.,"Arlington, TX",0,5,,5.0,5/30/2016,"The food selection and taste is always wonderful. But it's the employee's that made my last dining experience here even better. Our server (I've forgotten name) was awesome. As was the manager. I had a strange question about another restaurant that I thought was run by BJ's, (it wasn't , Lazy Dog Cafe) but our waiter didn't have the answer and must have gone to the manager who was extremely nice and talked with us about the other restaurant. They are both excellent employees !!!"
Jessie B.,"Dallas, TX",14,89,6,4.0,6/9/2015,I have always loved coming here. Such a great diverse menu to select from. I love their apps and small bites. Great portions and an amazing selection of beer.  Great service and atmosphere.  Thanks BJ's for never letting me down :D
SeRita K.,"Arlington, TX",0,5,2,5.0,4/15/2016,"This place is soooo good. The best drinks and pizza, and it stays packed so that should also tell you it's well worth it."
Donald G.,"Arlington, TX",45,18,1,5.0,4/14/2016,"They have the best Root Beer in town, love the I clam chowder soup! Service is great! Melissa is the greatest!"
Doug T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",724,324,1083,3.0,10/6/2013,"I came here after the football game between Arizona State and Notre Dame because we were looking for a restaurant that was open after 11pm on Saturday night. So our choices were limited.  We were seated very quickly and the waitress greeted us right was. She was pretty friendly, happy, smiling. Nice since we weren't is the best of moods since we lost and were hungry.  I had the fish and chips with wedge fries. It was huge with four pretty big pieces of fish. Only problem is that there wasn't that much taste and had to use the tartar sauce. My wife and daughter split a huge plate of spaghetti with meat sauce. They enjoyed the spaghetti. My son had the fettichini with chicken. Very bland.  The service was great. Served us quickly and she always made sure we were taken care of.  Just not a fan of the quality of the food. Felt it was a little too bland for my liking. So I'm scratching my head and wondering why this place was so packed at 11pm on a Saturday night. Did we just order incorrectly? Oh well"
Kati W.,"Beggs, OK",0,8,4,5.0,8/23/2015,We went here for dinner and will definitely come back the next time we are in the area! The food was excellent and the beer was interesting. The waitstaff had good recommendations and was knowledgeable about the different beers. The atmosphere is welcoming and comfortable. No need for an appetizer the portions are so large that after having a beer even my husband couldn't finish all his food.
Laura L.,"Arlington, TX",0,4,,2.0,10/23/2016,Ordered take out; got the portobello swiss burger with a veggie pattie with a couple of toppings left off and received a burger with only the pattie and mushroom and no toppings at all. Very disappointing.
Sandra G.,"Arlington, TX",0,9,1,1.0,12/26/2015,"Extremely disappointed. They changed up the menu. No longer serve bruschetta , their lettuce wraps were bland, asked for the sesame soy sauce it usually comes with and was told they no longer carry it. The chicken was not very tender. I think they have a new chef...no Bueno. Will not be returning. Disappointed"
Cecelia S.,"Arlington, TX",5,7,2,5.0,5/14/2015,Super friendly servers!!! They are fast on bringing your food out too :) Excellent pizza and pizookis!!!
Felicia C.,"Cedar Hill, TX",3,11,1,4.0,9/6/2016,BJ's is a great place to relax and enjoy great food! I always encounter great servers there. And the wait time is never too long!
