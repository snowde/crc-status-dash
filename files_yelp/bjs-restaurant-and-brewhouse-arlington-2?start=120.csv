Raymond O.,"Irving, TX",74,119,35,1.0,8/5/2014,"Always ignored by the same server at the bar. I have always had luck with the staff here, but lately one person new to the bar area has been lacking in service. The food is fine, the drinks are cold, and maybe the kitchen might be a bit slow at some times. My review focuses on 1 particular person at the bar. She always checks her phone when she can, slow to asking how are you or if you need anything else, and you'll need to get her attention with a loud audible tone. This is not the 1 st time I have bad service with HER, but the 4th maybe 5th time. I'm a good tipper but people  don't always deserve gratitude in monetary form. Please if your at the bar area be careful and try not to get HER. She might be nice I guess, however I think she might be one of the worst employees at BJs.  Please pray you do not get ""Elizabeth"" or pray she learns that she discriminates toward some people and provides horrible service."
Arielle H.,"Duncanville, TX",67,97,15,4.0,2/19/2015,"I went here with my family for  lunch one day and it wasn't really crowded which was surprising for a Saturday. Our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful with recommendations. I ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta and it was really good, far better than I expected.  I think this is great spot for casual lunch/dinner hangouts; the price was decent and the waitstaff was very friendly."
Kim R.,"Arlington, TX",0,47,,4.0,9/21/2016,Great food and service. We ordered a few pizza's and the cookie dessert. Great dinner night out.
Kelicia C.,"Euless, TX",283,307,262,4.0,2/10/2011,"I really like BJ's. No matter what location I go to , I always find that the servers are so freaking knowledgeable regarding the menu. And I have always been blown away by great customer service because it's a huge plus when you have good food. I tried the flatbread pizza this time, very yum. I try to cut corners with regards to bread, but yeah......that never really works for me.  Lemme tell ya'll about this mac and cheese they have. HOLY SMOKES!  Bacon, mac and cheese, breadcrumbs, baked. I really could have eaten just that as a meal, that's how good it was AND that's how much you get. Next time, I know better. I ended up taking the whole pizza home with me almost because I was full."
Suzanne W.,"Seattle, WA",110,189,108,3.0,12/26/2014,BJ's is actually probably one of my favorite chain restaurants. I usually order the deep dish pizza which I think is pretty good. My dad's favorite is the Asian chicken salad they have (I don't remember the actual name) One time they accidentally made extra pizza so they gave one to us which was really nice. The service is pretty good and the decor is upscale.   Also if you come here the group of friends order the Pazookie; it's a giant cookie with ice cream on top and it's amazing fresh out of the oven.
Gabrielle E.,"Richardson, TX",151,27,4,4.0,3/17/2016,Food was absolutely delicious. Bar atmosphere is spacious with plenty of televisions to watch your favorite team! I will be back during March Madness!!
Shardá T.,"Dallas, TX",211,105,39,2.0,10/20/2014,"I like BJ's. I'm never blown away and I'm never disappointed. But I will say this last trip I asked for a skinny girl margarita and the waitress forgot allll about me probably because shift change was happening, and honey looked like she'd been on her feet and day and wasn't checkin for me. But I'm gonna let her slide because I've been a waitress myself I get it. And ways my food was OK no good but okay. I had the parmesan crusted chicken this past trip. It was tasty some of the chicken was a little dry could have used more sauce. Anyways that's my review. I know food best"
Thiviyah R.,"Nashville, TN",50,40,10,5.0,8/2/2014,BJ's can get a little pricey but they have a really good beer selection and a really nice ambience as well. The staff are very friendly and helpful.  I tried the snakebite and I loved it. It's a mix of guiness and cider which I used to drink a lot in London and this is the only place in America that I know of that has this drink.  I also tried the clam chowder soup in the bread bowl and that was fantastic as well!
Karen L.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",80,615,3,3.0,6/15/2013,"We stopped in here for lunch yesterday, and it was...ok.  The restaurant itself is huge, (and gorgeous), so it seemed a little odd that our party of four was seated at a booth right next to a wait station and the restrooms -- it was around 1pm, not exactly peak lunch time.   Service overall was underwhelming.  Our waiter seemed nice, and gave a good impression of competence, but simple requests like silverware (since the table only had two sets, not four) took a loooong time.  I mean, there's appetizers sitting on the table -- perhaps we'd all like forks and a napkin? The food was a mixed bag for me.  The appetizers, bruschetta and a watermelon and feta salad, were good, though the bruschetta was not really bruschetta...I don't understand the urge to add melted cheese to this dish!  I ordered the unlimited soup and salad for lunch, and while the clam chowder was excellent, the salad was pretty blah, and contained a lot of stems.  Also, while I specifically requested the ""unlimited"" option, which was actually a dollar cheaper than the soup and salad lunch, at no point was I offered another portion of either soup or salad (and I wouldn't have turned down another chowder). Overall, it was fine, but not something I'm eager to return to.  Better service would definitely make for a better experience!"
Hollyanne S.,"San Diego, CA",947,297,211,4.0,6/29/2014,BJ's provides the biggest menu I have ever seen at a restaurant. It is literally 5 pages long. The variety of food is off the chain! They have a great under 750 calories section that is delicious. The place brews their own beer and handcrafted sodas. The prices are a tad high but worth it. The pizzas is where it's at!!
Becky K.,"Crystal Lake, IL",124,124,474,5.0,7/16/2014,"Love BJS. We are there a few times in Ohio and tried one in Texas tonight. Same great food. Beer was so cold and crisp. Appetizers we ordered fried artichokes and corn fritters with aioli. Out of the two the fritters were my favorite. The artichokes were good but mostly tasted like fried food, which is never bad :-). I ordered the deep dish pizza and it did not disappoint. My husband got the chicken lemone and said it was delicious. My friend ordered the new pasta Classico and she said it was garlicky and amazing. Overall, the food was fantastic and the drinks were superb!"
Nichole S.,"Tampa, FL",0,10,3,3.0,9/18/2015,"Waiter wasn't exciting or happy to be working. No silverware on the table & had to scramble to find some once the food came out. Food was just OK for all 3 orders - burger, two salads, & soup. Bar food in a nice atmosphere."
Jacob J.,"Chicago, IL",705,2453,3000,4.0,1/5/2012,"Wait, wait, read it first don't just jump to conclusions. I know, I know.. but Jacob it's a chain!  Thirteen states nationwide have locations of this cookie cutter, chain establishment but there's no denying, it's rockstar for cookie cutter. Walking in the other night, one would never know that there is a shite economy going on presently.  TV's showing sports, people smiling and conversing with one another, brews pouring and tables filled with food and cheer.  By the way, it was about an hour to close and we were able to get a seat right away.  Not the always.  This area is a widely popular go-to for shopping and eating.  The typical busy days and hours of the week should be avoided.  Calling ahead is only good for carryout. Take a quick gander at their menu online, though pricing is not included,  much of it is affordable whether your taking out the kids or having a date night.  They offer this crazy weeknight special (I think for the holidays only) where two, get salads, a specialty medium pizza and dessert for under twenty dollars before tax.  That's insane since many of their medium or large pizzas at regular price are about that price.  You can opt to tack on an additional charge to get two movie tickets at a discounted rate.  That's a bangin' deal!   Recently they introduced small plates.  Think about their regular appetizers but in a smaller portion for a more affordable price.  Try some at $2.95, not bad. BJ's boasts having deep dish pizza and having displayed that on their website I'm surprised they don't have (even) one location in Illinois.  As a Chicagoan that often eats his pizzas deep, I found it not to be the same thing.  If you like dough; say a fan of bread you'd love their deep dish.  It's like a double dough pizza.  My only advice is to inquire with your waiter / waitress whether they would add an ample amount of sauce or just go for it and ask for extra.  My first time our pizza suffered from not having enough pizza sauce.  It was dry and by the time we got a side of warm sauce, it just didn't matter. Good times had with a great bro and made awesome with stellar service.  The prices were right and I think if I happened on another location, I'd try it again. Note to the wise.  If hitting on a girl and wanting to grab a drink with her.  You may not like to start the sentence saying, ""So, I'm a fan of BJ's and was thinking we could.."" instead you may like to say "" So, I'm a fan of BJ's brewhouse and was thinking..""   Double entendre can be fun."
Keirra V.,"Dallas, TX",0,2,,5.0,6/13/2016,First time here and everything was amazing!! The pizookies are a great finish a great meal.
Cee G.,"Arlington, TX",20,79,52,4.0,5/31/2014,"Great Service, Great Prices and Great Food. I ordered the Grilled Salmon, my husband ordered the Crispy Jalapeno Burger and he loved it. We both had Top Shelf Margaritas, Great!"
Shawn L.,"Richardson, TX",2,62,12,3.0,7/23/2015,Not my cup of tea. I didn't find the food that great. It is a good place to hang out with friend though.
Aleisha T.,"Grand Prairie, TX",41,2,,1.0,1/17/2015,"Terrible food, over priced beers.  A bottle of Miller lite was $5.00.  Service was ok but the food is mediocre at best."
Jay M.,"Arlington, TX",39,10,21,4.0,6/29/2014,"BJ's menu has so much to choose from!  It took me a while to decide what I wanted. I ended up getting the New Orleans jambalaya. The presentation of the dish was nice and the taste was even better. It had just the right amount of spice in it, and the chicken and the shrimp were delicious. I will go back to try more from their menu."
Jim S.,"Grand Prairie, TX",6,41,2,3.0,5/17/2015,Went for lunch and was very pleased. Portions are very big. Waitor did a great job. Great food. Will definitely return! very expensive for what you get  though
Mari B.,"Midlothian, TX",120,20,3,4.0,8/6/2015,This is such a good restaurant!! The food is delicious and the staffs not too bad either! The prices are fair for being in the highlands and my order usually comes out in a timely manner! I always get Parmesan crusted chicken with extra sauce on the side and their cream soda! My favorite dish here! The pizzas pretty good too! Definitely well worth the visit!
