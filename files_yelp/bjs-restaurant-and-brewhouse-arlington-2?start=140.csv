Quincey M.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,6,,1.0,7/15/2016,great waiter but horrible food. do not i repeat do not get the hickory burger. i have been coming to bjs for a few years and this by far the worst thing they even made. not sure if it was the cook or what. it was dry salty. felt like my pattie been out all day.
Txgirl M.,"Dallas, TX",29,146,4,1.0,11/16/2014,"I went here last night and the food is horrible. Any place that offers a variety of different foods you have to wonder what is really good. We ordered the pizza dip appetizer the bread was stale and the California burger was okay but the fries were cold and no flavor. The waiters we had were awesome but it still didn't make up for the terrible food. Also, the food is way overly priced."
Mel R.,"Arlington, TX",6,47,54,3.0,3/27/2014,"Nothing to brag about. The food was just ok,  and the prices are affordable. The restaurant is clean and the customer service is great. Went with 4 other people and we all felt the same way about our food."
Hannah B.,"Dallas, TX",8,10,7,4.0,4/13/2014,The chicken bacon ranch deep dish pizza was delicious & more than enough for my husband and I to split ($20). Our waiter was friendly & even gave us a complimentary dessert for it being our first time. The biggest negative was the wait time - we waited quite a while before having to ask if our buzzer/pager was broken. Evidently it was because there were opened tables waiting & they then escorted us to one of them. Very busy on a Saturday night.
Shauna T.,"Arlington, TX",257,267,289,2.0,8/20/2013,"My boyfriend and I came here a handful of times (maybe 3 times) in the past year. Each time we come here, he swears to never come back because he is always disappointed by the food. I personally don't think it's too bad, but many things on the menu don't present a wow factor and are available at other restaurants for a cheaper price. I haven't tried too many items from the menu, but I have tried enough. The best thing to order is probably the pizza from here since it's a difficult item to screw up. Food takes at least 30 minutes to get out of the kitchen and onto your table; this includes ordering something simple, like pizza. I don't recommend coming here unless you have an excessive amount of patience. Oh, and don't come here if you have an entire party of guests. My friend recently had a birthday get-together at BJ's and we waited over an hour to be seated. She had made reservations prior to the occasion, but the hostess refused to let us sit in our reserved seats because ""at least half of our party of 20 needed to be present"". Great, more waiting. With many other restaurants in the Highlands, I recommend skipping past this one and trying another."
Lenin P.,"Dallas, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/19/2014,"Very bad on service, can't even get a simple  calamari dish cooked right, my steak and pasta was over cook and over all  just a very bad experience and poor service."
Rob W.,"Grand Prairie, TX",5,23,19,2.0,1/13/2015,"Went to see the National Championship game (Ohio/Oregon) last night. Waiter was nice. Ordered a beer (game day special with some food specials), my buddy who was in the restaurant business for many years asked ""do you smell that?"" And I said no, he said it was reused oil that has been scorched.  We ordered the Egg Rolls and a mini-pizza. Wife didn't care much for the Egg Rolls, they didn't knock me off my feet either. The pizza was really good, wife ate her half and I was eating mine until I found a hair in the food. Being nice, I didn't reorder. They comp'ed my pizza. My opinion? The whole thing should be comp'ed but I didn't raise a stink about it (wasn't even that much and a manager didn't even come over).  Wrote on the receipt, ""waiter was great but please keep the hair."""
T L.,"New York, NY",5,77,61,2.0,12/16/2012,"Decor is great and the service for me was friendly prompt and fantastic-- 5 stars there!  Based upon the food though, I got the impression that the kitchen staff just isn't trying.  Ordered a burger that was saturated in grease, just soaking the buns.  I've eaten sloppy joes that were less sloppy.  We're talking your entire fingers wet with grease.  Disgusting.  How does that happen?  So that meal went unfinished by far.   Then I tried the BJs Brownie, essentially a brownie with ice cream.  It arrived literally 6 inches tall, with WAY too much whipped cream.  Think between 1 and 2 inches all the way around a scoop of ice cream.  So once most of that's scooped off I notice the brownie is barely 1/4 inch thick, hard, and adhered to the pan so strongly you had to chip it away with a spoon.  Obviously overdone.   Had the cook been more attentive and less sloppy, it woulda been a great meal, but not so.  I just get the feeling that the folks in the kitchen don't know any better, or don't care.  Where's Gordon Ramsay when you need him?"
Audrey K.,"Mansfield, TX",0,38,,3.0,4/20/2015,Ordered deep dish pizza but the waitress brought out thin crust. We were so hungry we went ahead and ate it but we're not impressed. Waitress gave us the pizza for free so that was positive.
Kayla T.,"Corpus Christi, TX",190,134,434,5.0,8/28/2014,Ok I orders at this place yesterday I feel that they have the best pizza they had it ready when I went to go get it that impressed me ! Then when I brought it home it was still hot ! They have and impeccable carry out service ! The pizza was Amazing I had ordered three pizzas and they where the hi light of the night (: I definitely will be a tending again(:
Nedra W.,"Arlington, TX",4,9,3,1.0,6/8/2014,"On 6/7/14, I along with 12 others were set to celebrate my birthday at BJs in the Highlands and because of the knowledge that it was graduation weekend, we sent a person ahead to list our name. Our name for a table was given at 6:30 and was told it would be an hour and half wait. We stood around and two large groups that arrived after us were seated before us. An hour and fourty-five minutes went by and when we asked how much longer, it was told to us that it would be another 10 minutes, 10 minutes later we were told another 15 minutes the table was paying. 20minutes later I returned to the counter and was told 10 minutes. My aunt shortly followed and asked why the hold up as did my cousin from another side of the table. The hostess said it would be another 10 minutes the table was finishing their dessert.  I then walked back up and said you keep saying 10 minutes and 10 minutes and we haven't gotten any closer to being seated. At that point instead of apologising, the hostess proceeded to tell me ""you just asked 5 minutes how much time do you think has passed"" At the same time my cousin was speaking to the manager Joe, and told him how long we had been and that we keep getting 10 minutes 10 minutes,  Joe answered and said it is not our fault that we are this busy. I told the guy for your party that it would be an hour and half before seating. Myself and my cousin and my aunt all said, "" that was at 6:30 at this point we were going on 2 hours 20 minutes.  No apologies no beverages offered for the wait. Literally no attempt to better the situation. We politely turned in our beeper and retrieved the birthday cake  were they misspelled my name after telling them how to spell it,  and we left and went down the hill to RUDY'S where there was no line, seating was open and the customer service was outstanding.   It was my first venture to BJs and my last one. Unprofessional and Rude from management to staff."
Lana Y.,"Grand Prairie, TX",352,338,329,4.0,7/8/2011,"This place different kinds of beers to try if youre into that...And they have just about everything on the menu to eat....from Italian to Mexican to burgers and steaks! Try it, they wont let you down!"
Portia H.,"New York, NY",54,364,223,3.0,4/10/2013,"We went here one night at 10 PM for Happy Hour Specials. We got the Thai Wantons but they weren't as good as we'd remembered when we got them the first time in Hurst.  The Srawberry Mojito on the $5 Happy Hour menu made me wish I could've paid $2 more and gotten the Blueberry Mojito at Ruth Chris.  Luis got the Dragonberry cocktail next and it tasted like Koolaid.  The Sliders were $2 off on the Happy Hour menu, BUT they added $2 back on cause we got them with cheese. Of course we were never told this up front. They were so skimpy that we added on the $1 fries. We should've gotten the message after the sliders. Now we just drive home. The shoestring fries were plentiful and very mediocre. Now we just drive home. This mediocre food which included (3) cocktails cost approx $30. I used to order the meatloaf and mashed potatoes a lot from here and the potato skins and they were always good."
Heather S.,"Arlington, TX",1129,354,2335,2.0,7/9/2012,"I normally adore this place.. But I am sitting in my booth right now and they have allowed a table of three to bring in puppies.. Like 6 week old little puppies and I'm watching all the staff pet and hold them !Uh.. Hello.. is someone gonna wash their hands?!?Iif they are that lenient on letting pets in, I'm concerned about how clean the kitchen is..."
Anye F.,"Frisco, TX",277,685,7,4.0,3/13/2011,"BJs was a really pleasant surprise.  I'm generally not a big fan of chains and rarely have high hopes for their food.  But I was VERY pleased with my first experience there a few nights ago. The ""gourmet mac and cheese"" was delicious.  I probably could have made a meal just of that, because it is rich.  It isn't gigantic but it's $3.95 and a real bargain at that price.  If they had a full size version I'd eat that too.  It was just perfect.  This is not Kraft, people.  It's pasta with several cheeses, a little bit of bacon, a little bit of breadcrumbs, baked in a ceramic dish to get the perfect level of crustiness.  Divinity in a bowl.  My honey ordered the stuffed mushrooms, which he said were very good, but since I detest mushrooms I just took his word for it. We also ordered a pizza since we'd heard the pizzas were good.  I didn't have my hopes up though because as I said I am usually skeptical of chains.  But, I enjoyed their pizza more than any of the other pizzas I've had in Arlington yet.  It was a thick deep dish pizza, but the crust was light and airy rather than heavy.  The sauce had a very nice flavor, the toppings were of good quality and substantial (I ordered pepperoni, italian sausage, black olives which is my standard pizza).  We had ordered extra sauce since the menu said the pizza was ""lightly sauced"" - our waiter noticed that it wasn't too heavily sauced when he brought it so he went and got us two large sides of sauce (much more than we needed, but the sauce was so good we dipped the breadsticks from my mac & cheese in it). My honey ordered a beer, which he enjoyed a lot.  I ordered the ""Lime in the coconut""  martini - which although was advertised as being made with coco lopez, which is VERY sweet and VERY coconutty, tasted more like lime than like coconut.  It wasn't bad, but it was small and not coconutty enough for me so next time I'll try the pina colada / strawberry concoction they have advertised instead. Every silver lining has a cloud though - the cloud at BJ's was the wait.  Our fault for attempting to dine out at 8pm on a Saturday night but we ended up with about an hour-fifteen minute wait (we went to the pet store, bought dog food, drove back and still waited quite a while).  We saw after we got there that they have call-ahead seating -- trust me, you'll want to use it.  We definitely will. I will be back.  I may get my next take-out pizza from there, and I definitely want to try the cajun pastas and see if they stand up to the other ones.  But, even if I never ate anything besides the gourmet mac & cheese and the pizza, I'd probably be back here more often than was healthy for me."
Tiffany D.,"Arlington, TX",1767,869,756,4.0,3/27/2010,"In my opinion, this place should be 3 1/2 stars but for Yelp's whole star rating scale, I'll give them that extra half.  You have to have a different mindset when you come dine here.  Expect a 30-45 min wait and not be health conscious.  Grab a beer at the bar while you wait with your party. Trust me, it'll make the wait more bearable.  Share a pizza, try their microbrews, and end with a pizookie,  Their portions are huge hence the extra $2 on everything.. I dare you to finish their turkey club sandwich. Um stay away from their salads.. they kinda suck and they use weird tortillas for their fish tacos.  Try a pint of their blond with 1/4 cider. It's fruity and quite yummy. Side note: If you're health conscious/vegetarian , walk straight out of here. This place isn't for you.  I went here last week on Friday where I wasn't feeling like eating something cheesy, meaty (Lent), or seafood-y. I was hoping for a lighter fare, give my tummy a break since I've been eating naughtily the past few days. I opted for their tomato soup and mediterranean salad. The salad was eh (it was supposed to have some romaine lettuce but it was all pale iceberg). The tomato soup was too rich for my liking but if you like your tomato soup super creamy and cheesy- give it a try. :)"
Kayla J.,"Arlington, TX",8,46,,4.0,5/7/2012,"Juicy, yummy, delicious, drool-worthy. I can't say enough about the food. My friends and I all ordered different plates and tasted each others foods. I got the turkey burger while my friends got the California chicken and chicken fried steak. We all shared the calamari appetizer. Sadly I wanted onion rings, but they were out. I wanted the stuffed mushrooms, but they were out of that too.  However, from the food we ordered, none were disappointing at all!  Yes, the wait is kind of long, but I work at a restaurant so I understand. The only thing is that the restaurant better make the wait well worth it, and BJ's definitely succeeded."
Roxanne B.,"Arlington, TX",1,54,4,5.0,4/16/2014,"Oh boy what a menu!  Deciding what to order can be time consuming.  Hard to go wrong with so many items.  They also have a great happy hour with many drink and appetizer items.  Can be a bit busy, especially on a weekend, but worth the wait!"
Karthik K.,"Arlington, TX",7,21,,4.0,3/31/2012,"Great food and Great Beer. What more could you ask for in a brewery restaurant? Their Avocado rolls are to die/kill for. those go superbly with their home brewed beers.I have tried three of their brews (ale/lager/porter) and all three were fantastic. And...Oh their burgers...YUM!! one of the best I've had. I sampled one of their deep dish pizzas, but it didnt meet the standards i expect from them. I hope it was just a one off. This is my favorite place to spend a weekend night for dinner/drinks with friends, watch some sports and chill out. The service... though not top class wasn't too bad. Our server seemed kind of disconnected, but he suggested some good drinks, so I am not complaining. Totally suggest this place if you are in to good beer/pizza/food."
Gerald W.,"Grand Prairie, TX",73,229,162,4.0,5/26/2012,"I like this place but service is really hit and miss... the food is usually really good and the beer is cold and so very good... the deep dish pizza NEVER comes out hot, and I can not figure that out, it does not come out cold, it just does not come out pipping hot... but that goes for ALL BJ's...  the chicken coated in parmigiana cheese is a real treat.  The salads are good and I like the menu as it is full of variety.  All in all I like this place."
