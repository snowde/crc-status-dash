Whitney M.,"Burleson, TX",0,39,34,2.0,4/5/2015,"Went here with my hubby for a night out and I was really excited about going here I gave it a two stars because of the atmosphere is pretty cool but as far as prices and food eh it could have been way better in my opinion also the gluten free pizza was not magical at all ,nothing special about it and that was the main reason we came plus gluten free beer options . So all and all it sucked :/"
Deanna M.,"Arlington, TX",0,10,,2.0,3/31/2015,"How about 2.5 stars, certainly not the A-OK 3 stars. Parking there is awful. Visited on Sat. 3/28, 6pm, party of 6 (including an 11 and 6 y/o).  Seated at 6:40 or so.  Ordered 2 waters, 3 sodas, 1 tea, when delivered we asked how many potato skins per appetizer, waiter wasn't sure, maybe 6 or 8; so we ordered 2 orders.  Came out with 10 per order which ended up being too much.  They Do Not skimp on their potato skins!  Each skin was probably palm sized and thick, they were very very good and served super hot. One adult ordered a rack of ribs and gave 4 ribs to the youngest child; ended up being too spicy for the kid so we scraped off the sauce and rub (I like spice and thought it was overkill for ribs), the meat was pretty dry too :(  , the nice sized baked potato was served with nice portions (we thought) of sour cream, cheese, chives, bacon, and some butter (I don't think anything was an extra charge if you can believe that, a lot of places seem to charge extra for some of those items), it looked really good. Two flat pizzas were enjoyed by 2 adults. I couldn't decide what to order off such an extensive menu, so I decided to be bad (fried food) and order the chicken fried chicken.  I was surprised my dish was served in a shallow Bowl of all things, mashed taters (which were very tasty) piled in the center, corn/pepper mix was surrounding (and under-not cool) the mashed and two pieces of tender chicken (one half breast pounded and split) stacked on top of and off center on potatoes resting on bowls edge-weird to me, but hey goin' with the flow.  What I did Not Like was the gravy (tasty too, certainly not a mix) poured all over the top of the potatoes And corn, and partially on each chicken piece.  This kinda ruined it for me; first off I hate my food being stacked (as this isn't gourmet dining, soooo...) if I want my flavors combined I'll do it myself.  To have that yummy gravy all over the buttery corn was a big mistake. .  IF I ever order this again, I'll definitely ask for the gravy on the side, and hopefully my potatoes will not be sitting on top of a good portion of the corn. The waters and the tea were never refilled nor was it offered, one of the kids saw the waiter pass behind our table and asked for more sierra mist soda, when that was delivered one adult asked for water b/c her soda had been empty for a while. I myself was engrossed in conversation so I failed to be quick enough to ask for more water, dang it. I believe that is the only time the waiter came to the table after the dinners were served.  We all shared a small birthday desert, a Pizookie and dang was it taaaa-sty!  I thought it was a choc. chip type cookie with toffee chips too and caramel on top of it and the ice cream scoop, but I don't see anything that resembles that on their online menu.  Whatever, it was very very good.     Our waiter was a pleasant guy, didn't hound us, but at the same time not refilling our drinks was poor.  Lol, when he came to pick up the bill he did ask us if we wanted anything else to drink. You think that would've been offered as we ordered desert, or even during our meal! Yes, we lingered at the table, the bill was close to 115.00 and he was tipped very well. I really like this place's atmosphere too."
Frankie A.,"Sacramento, CA",3,111,4,5.0,9/8/2014,"I was so impressed with the food but mostly with the quality of service. I sat in the bar area. We had wings, pizza and beer. The server was very knowledgeable about the beers and very attentive. This was our first time at BJ's. Definitely coming back!"
Jessie E.,"Arlington, TX",4,21,7,2.0,6/28/2014,"The food was mediocre and the service was terrible. We waited almost 20 minutes to get our drinks taken on a Wednesday afternoon at 2. It wasn't very busy. Also, the pizza dough is left sitting at room temperature over night with the pizza sauce on it according to our waitress. A member of our party is allergic to tomatoes and when the waitress explained the pizza dough sits over night with the sauce on it we were all disgusted and changed our orders. It makes sense for the dough to sit, but out at room temperature? And with tomato sauce already on it? The waitress said you can call 24 hours in advance and they will make a pizza without sauce over night, but in reality who plans on going to BJs? Definitely will be going to Cheesecake Factory next time down the road, where they actually make fresh pizza instead of letting it sit out all night."
Alay P.,"Dallas, TX",2,9,2,3.0,2/18/2013,"I'm always a fan of trying new restaurants that have their own specialty microbrews, but it's usually hit or miss.  BJ's was fairly crowded for our Friday night visit, with our wait time being about 45 minutes.  The front staff was less than admirable however, as even after our buzzer rang off, we were made to wait while other parties who came after us were seated before us (same size parties too). I would rate the food as slightly average considering the prices they charge.  I tried the hefeweizen which was pretty good, and not too costly even at regular price ($5.25).  I ordered the steak and caramelized onion flatbread pizza which was delicious.  Definitely must try their pizzas.  They have an extensive menu which could satisfy most people's food preferences. In short, decent food but slightly overpriced, in a comfortable environment with friendly waitstaff."
Kelly J.,"Fort Smith, AR",0,17,16,4.0,7/8/2013,"We chose BJ's randomly before heading out of Arlington after a Rangers game and I'm glad we did! To start we ordered the Calamari, it was crispy and fairly large for the price.  They served it with maranara and a garlic aoili that was heavy on the lemon (definite A+++ I love anything lemon). For my entree I ordered the Blackened Chicken Alfredo.  It was good, the sauce was creamy and simple and the chicken was blackened and a touch spicy.  My husband ordered one of their deep dish pizza's.  He ordered a medium with pepperoni and sausage and it was too big for him to finish.  He said it was the best deep dish he'd ever had.  I tried it and thought it was very good!  I believe his was close to $20, a little pricey for a medium.   Overall I'd give BJ's 4 stars 4 stars for food, 4 stars for price, 4 stars for atmosphere and 5 stars for service."
Brandi B.,"Duncanville, TX",98,132,170,5.0,5/3/2014,Went here after the comedy show....had the shareable hand tossed pizza....half bj favorite and the other half the 5 meat....as always this is a great spot to eat. I love bjs no matter the location you can't go wrong!
Brittany G.,"Arlington, TX",0,3,,2.0,9/19/2014,Every time I have gone here I have had terrible service. Food comes out great but because of the service I will personally not be going here anymore. Wish it was better.
Letty S.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,1.0,9/12/2015,The food was good but the waiter was terrible. My husband and I ordered pizza and drinks.  I got my drink pretty quick but my husband waited for at least 15 minutes for his drink.  The waiter seemed like he wanted us out because instead of asking us if we would like another drink he just brought us the check. We didn't feel welcome at all. Thanks to the waiter. The waiter to me represents the whole restaurant. This was our first visit and we were not impressed at all.
David F.,"Arlington, TX",354,222,536,1.0,12/5/2011,you don't come here to eat.....you come here to wait!!! and wait!!! I have been here on two occasions. Both time the experience was pretty bad. I walked in and was so impressed with how nice it looked and was looking forward to an awesome experience. The first time I went they did not have any of their own beers!!! what the hell!!.  The second time I went was during lunch hours. We ordered chips and salsa which we never got and they tried to charge us for them. The wait for the food was ridiculous and the wait staff acted as if they did not give a shit if we were waiting 45 minutes for our order.  Ill never go back.
Kerri V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,48,7,3.0,7/26/2014,Beer is great!  Good is ok but not great.  Service is hit it miss.  Kid friendly and they love the chicken fingers and flat bread pizza.  Pizzookie is the best desert ever - so skip dinner and order beer and desert!
Geoffrey R.,"Atlanta, GA",189,225,299,4.0,8/11/2011,"BJ's is just down the road from my house, and though I pass by it frequently, I've just started darkening their door.  Came in about 11pm a few nights back, ordered nachos & a small pizza, tipped back to the house w/o checking my order. The pizza was excellent...just what I ordered. The nachos were a COMPLETELY different story. Light on the cheese, no chili whatsoever, and no onions/tomatoes to be found.  Decided to come back the following day to voice my displeasure to the manager on duty, and I was pleasantly surprised. Nick, the MOD, apologized at least 3x in the 5 mins after I explained the issue with my order. He then offered to give me another order of nachos, or whatever appetizer I wanted to swap them for, on the house. I told him that I'd just like another order of nachos, but I would also like to place an order for another pizza. He comped the nachos, and to my surprise, the pizza as well. Everything came out fresh, hot, and with a drink to boot.  All in all, what started out as a poor experience, was turned around by excellent customer service. I'll be back...frequently. Outside of the excellent service the 2nd time around, the happy hour specials are awesome..."
Nikki C.,"Arlington, TX",2,17,,4.0,10/14/2012,"A bit pricey, but the food is great. Great variety of food and drinks. Be prepared for a wait though, if you can make reservations."
Angelica E.,"Dallas, TX",49,29,20,2.0,9/2/2013,"I come here quite often because my friends are a bit obsessed, and each time I swear to never come back because I always leave very disappointed, and  needing a shot of Pepto. I have eaten in the Lubbock and Arlington locations and the verdict stands the same. I will say that their service for big groups in the Lubbock location is always spot on, and they always seem to cater to our obnoxiously loud group staying for hours after close to take pics with the birthday dinner guest. The prices could be a bit more affordable seeing as you could go across the street to the other 20 or so restaurants in the highlands and get the same entrees for a  cheaper price. The build your own pizza is the only thing that binds me to this place, but I pray I don't have to go back for another last minute birthday dinner."
Will S.,"Arlington, TX",14,9,,4.0,11/15/2013,"Went here for the first time with a friend who lived in the area and loves the place. The beer was fantastic and the food was very good. I ordered the crispy jalapeño burger and 2 hopstorm IPAs and I couldn't have been happier. There was a bit of a wait to get in and the fries with the burger weren't the best I've ever had, but that's just nitpicking... this place is the best brewpub I've been to in Texas so far."
Dano F.,"Arlington, TX",0,24,71,4.0,3/23/2013,"The atmosphere is one of a normal ""Sports Bar"" I'm not a big sports type so that didn't impress me.   They seem to push the booze more than the meal, but then again it is more than less a ""Sports Bar"" I had the Shrimp Teriyaki Dinner, which was good and well cooked, how ever the amount of the serving was lame.  Able was my server and was quite good.. He was attentive to the replacement of an empty glass and asked how the entrée was cooked.   Cost, per serving size was a little pricey but over all the meal was very good."
Joe J.,"Arlington, TX",0,24,,2.0,5/22/2011,"6-8 times here and never a disappointment until this week.  We arrived about 5 PM to enjoy a beer and pizza. We decided to sit at the bar to watch a game and the bad experience started from the beginning.  There was one other couple at the bar, which sits about 20 people, so it was not very busy.  At the end of the bar were two bar servers and two other wait people.  We sat there a minute, 2 minuted passed, 3-4 minutes passed and the 4 employees were still laughing and talking at the end of the bar. Finally, I got up, walked about 10 steps and said ""Could we get a couple of beers down here?""  We walked the 10 steps back to our seats. ""What's it going to be""? was the greating.  No ""Hello, how are you?"" or ""Sorry you were waiting"". As time passed, the bar server did pay some attention to us by asking a couple of times ""Another one, Bud?""  Well, my name is not Bud and I was not drinking Bud.  I'm twice his age.  The ""Bud"" tag just did not feel right. Then, when we were close to leaving, he switched names for me.  ""Anything else, Boss?' Maybe I'm off base here, but calling customers ""Bud"" and ""Boss"" will not work with many people. A word about the food.  We come here for both the excellent beer selection and the food.  The beer did not disappoint.  One of our favorite foods is the BJ Pizza, in our minds, the best pizza anywhere.  But, on this particular day, the pizza came out way over cooked. The top 1/2 inch of crust was actually charred, and the rest of the pizza top also suffered from too much time in the oven. It was still pretty good, but not up to the normal level of excellence.  It will be awhile before we go back.  There are too many places with excellent food, service and a good selection of food."
Kenji S.,"Hartford, CT",119,19,33,4.0,6/4/2013,"I love dark beers, and their PM Porter made it among the top. Their low-cal Moroccan Seared Salmon was amazing; however, I only go there for the beer for most occasions. Service was good, similar among other chains in the area."
Kayla S.,"South Padre Island, TX",4,15,,3.0,1/29/2014,"This place was kind 'eh' for me. I've heard the pizza is good so I decided to try it out. We were seated quickly, our waiter had the personality of a piece of cardboard though; he did his job, got our drinks and orders, but that's it, nothing more-nothing less. Although I saw him being really friendly with other tables?  My pizza was a bit soggy in the middle(gross) not sure what happened there, maybe it wasn't cooked all the way? Too many toppings? Grease? Whatever, I'm not big on complaining, it could be worse, I could box it up, recook it in the oven and make it crispy.  Not even 10 minutes into our meal the waiter comes to ask if we need to go boxes, we weren't even done eating? Felt a little rushed, especially when he brought out the check with the boxes. That kinda sucked because this was my birthday dinner, I wanted to have a nice meal with my family but I felt as soon as I got the meal part, he was trying to get us to leave. I didn't even get to try any of the beers, he snatched the menu away after we ordered our food.  I wish I could give this place 5 stars, it seemed to have a nice atmosphere. It wasn't a terrible experience, but it definitely could have been better. The pizza was good, well... the cooked part anyway, and nobody else complained about their food. From the reviews I see that this location is really hit or miss on service and food wise, guess I just got a miss :/ Might give it another shot but not for awhile."
Laurie P.,"Grand Prairie, TX",13,76,1,4.0,1/10/2014,Really enjoy this place. Great Lemon Drop Martini's. Nice variety on the menu with good specials. Fun place to watch Football and good service.
