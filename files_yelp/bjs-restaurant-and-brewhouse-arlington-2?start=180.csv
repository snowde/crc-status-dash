Coach P.,"Fort Worth, TX",26,103,91,2.0,5/25/2009,"The pizza is doughy and greasy, much like a frozen deep dish from Wal Mart. Wide variety of brew. However, no domestic beers are available on draft, that is un-American.  What a half baked idea, just like the pizza.  Just another bloated restaurant that gets over on it's decorations and dark lights."
Brian Banks T.,"DeSoto, TX",25,9,,5.0,2/9/2014,The service was great and the was great. Always a high traffic restaurant be prepared on a Saturday night to wait minimum 20 mins even a 10pm which is when we go to the restaurant.
Gerald W.,"Grand Prairie, TX",55,155,1,4.0,2/27/2013,"O. K. it's a chain, but the beer is good and cold. Big screen TV's throughout and a menu that pretty much will satisfy everyone. There is a full bar with liquor, beer and wine. I wouldn't say it was noisy, but rather lively. I prefer sitting at the tables in the bar.: the service seems a little better, especially if you are ordering drinks. They do have a gluten free menu, but if you are gluten free you have to lay off the beer. Too bad! If you are not into specialty beers, you would only give B J's three stars. It is especially good for late night dining. The pizza is really good, but somehow it doesn't come out of the kitchen hot enough."
June M.,"Arlington, TX",0,7,,2.0,6/6/2013,"Awful service! Last two times I was there the waitress ignored me for 10 minutes and the  other time, other waitress left with without drink for a good 15 minutes. And the food is not even that great."
Mimi T.,"Dallas, TX",73,482,74,5.0,7/28/2011,"THEY HAVE RED VELVET PIZOOKIE (with white chocolate chips)!! I'm such a red velvet fanatic! My friend from Los Angeles told me she went to BJ's for a red velvet pizookie, and thought of me. After she told me that, I called the BJ's here to see if they had it, and I came to try it that very night!! Happy hours are THE BEST!! Ordered: 3 mini pizzas (50% off), flatbread pizza ($2 off), sharable appitizer ($2 off), a cocktail ($2 off), and a mini red velvet pizookie! Damage was $40.  The mini red velvet pizookie is BETTER than the regular size pizookie. The regular one came out too thin. I love red velvet! I love happy hour! So, I really like BJ's! Happy hour: Everyday EXCEPT Saturdays. 3-5PM(?) and 9-11PM!"
Kimmie W.,"Grand Prairie, TX",57,72,31,3.0,7/19/2013,"So I've been coming here for over a year and I have to say I'm pleased. All the food is good according to everyone I've asked and there are plenty of regulars. They have a food sensitive menu for the gluten sensitive folks and their gluten free pizza rocks. They have a few gluten free ciders but don't offer and decent gluten free beer options. I have never been ""glutened"" when it came to their gluten free food. Very pleased..."
Chey R.,"Austin, TX",23,60,15,4.0,8/20/2013,The food here is always great. This is one of the few chains we go to. I am only giving 4 stars because I don't like any if their beer :(. Other than that its great! We've always had great service at this location too!
Amber P.,"Garland, TX",1,12,3,1.0,2/6/2014,Went there once with my boyfriend and it was slower but there was no reason for the lack of service. we were neglected it took over 10 min to get drinks. the food took forever to come out and I am not one to complain but the server kept walking past us and not bringing the things we asked for so I flagged down the manager and explained my dissatisfaction with the situation and he made things better but there was no reason for the bad service in the first place.
Suzy F.,"Arlington, TX",12,75,1,4.0,11/20/2010,"My co-workers decided to try a new spot for HH, and I recommended BJ's.   Recommended HH locations were put to a vote, and BJ's won :).   I made a reservation, but we had to start at the bar until we had enough people for them to move us to our reserved table.  The transition from the bar area to our table was pretty seamless, but it was a little annoying that we couldn't just start out at our reserved table. However, the HH specials (5-7) followed us to the table.  $2 off shareable apps, $1 off draft beer, 1/2 off mini pizzas, etc. were pretty good deals.  Everyone seemed really happy with their choices, and there were lots of us to please.  The craft beers on tap, avocado egg rolls, spinach and artichoke dip, nachos, chicken pot stickers, pizza, roast beef dip sandwich, etc. seemed to go over really well.  The menu is so diverse, the most finicky eaters as well as foodies can find exactly what they want on the menu. The service was great, considering that we were a large party.  They kept up with who ordered what beer, appetizer, and entree, and gracefully handled 18 separate checks."
Donnell J.,"Arlington, TX",8,80,3,4.0,5/6/2013,Just another corporate restaurant. The menu is all over the place. Definitely should be reduced for service sake if nothing else. They have their own selection of craft beers. Grand Cru is one of there seasonal that is AWESOME! I recommend sitting at the bar with the huge tv that can be switch it 6 smaller tv's. If you do choose the bar make sure it's Stephen or Aimee bartending...if not you're better off sitting in the restaurant. The 4 stars is pretty much based on the service of those two. If not for them (and Grand Cry) it would be a 3 possibly 2.
C J.,"Dallas, TX",3,5,,5.0,9/8/2013,"Been to this place three times now and everything was amazing. A little pricey but WELL worth the cost! I'll continue to go to this restaurant! Don't miss out on an amazing meal......Oh, their home brew is very good also."
Daniel M.,"Arlington, TX",86,28,14,4.0,3/14/2012,"Place is great, I recommend the meatloaf, anything that comes with a baked potato, their pizzas. Great bar with huge screens to watch the games, great home brewed beer. Tends to get pretty packed so don't always expect to just walk in and be seated, usually have to wait a bit."
Dan S.,"Grand Prairie, TX",236,196,42,3.0,7/19/2010,"This is one of my wife's favorites, and it has certainly grown on me.  The sandwiches are good, and I like that they give you a choice between thin and thick-cut fries with them.  The gourmet pizzas are good, but a little on the pricey side for their size, in my opinion.  The house-brewed beers are what you would expect, and I rarely drink the.  The house-brewed root beer is great, however, and I drink it regularly. The drinks are a little on the high side (about $7 for a top shelf mixed drink).  That being said there are plenty of choices in the area for drinks after I have eaten here."
Toni M.,"Euless, TX",3,7,1,4.0,7/21/2013,We decided to come to a familiar place after our soccer tournament was cancelled due to rain. Greeted by friendly faces and surprisingly not a long wait.  Roasted French dip was yummy with sweet onion and melted provolone cheese.  I always enjoy the handcrafted beer selection at this restaurant. Went out of my comfort zone and ordered a Piranha Pale Ale. A little more hops then I prefer but a delicious ale. Will stick with my ole stand by Harvest Hefewizen next time.  We decided to order dessert.  Best advice- order the dessert while you are eating. The BJ Brownie was worth the wait but not if you are pressed for time.
John V.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,8,,4.0,7/19/2012,"Thursday, at 12:30 in the middle of the lunch rush. Myself and my lady decided on this for lunch today, and I have to say it was a pleasant experience.  The service was friendly, attentive, and very quick without being pushy.  We shared the avocado egg rolls, which were fantastic!  I ordered a parmesan crusted chicken sandwich and my better half had the fried chicken with white cheddar mashed potatoes. Not a single fault with the meal.  Both of our orders arrived together and piping hot.  Both meals were cooked very nicely, flavors were spot on and seasoned well.  It was a bit noisy but neither of us had to strain to talk or be heard.  The decor is very nice/pleasing to look at.  I'm not too thrilled at all the TV's everywhere but they didn't bother me much. A fantastic experience and I plan on return visits, hopefully when I don't have to return to the office so I can try their craft beers!"
Pammy S.,"Washington, DC",6,38,,2.0,4/30/2013,"Meh. Not so great. Only good thing about it was the blonde style beer I ordered. Service was slow and inattentive at best. Then again, i'm not really a deep-fried burger sports bar type... but it wasn't my choice."
Tater J.,"San Francisco, CA",1,21,,1.0,3/10/2014,"I'll start with the positive, the beer. There's a decent selection of overpriced non-traditionally(German purity standards) brewed beers. As with most visits it took almost 10 minutes to even have our drink order taken. The food isn't bad, but it's not $20 a plate good. They have a less extensive and exciting menu than Cheddars at twice the price. I've regretted all 3 of my visits to a BJ's in the past 5 years, and I will be happy never going back. If you want a quality local brewed beer with excellent food check out Gordon Biersch instead. They don't use fillers in their beer, and actually offer some dishes resembling a fine dining establishment."
Celeste A.,"Lewisberry, PA",198,815,1013,3.0,10/21/2010,"Its ok. Its like Chili's or Applebee's with a good overpriced mixed drinks. I like their mojitos, I've had various martinis, pretty decent if you want unhealthy food and need to take the edge of your week. If you go on a Friday it is always loud and there will be a long line. I dig the French Dip sandwich with au jus. The pizzas are lackluster. The pasta is really hit or miss. Salads are gigantic and semi healthy if you want to offest the caloric content of your booze. Even though they have kids offerings I wouldn't take a child in here."
Sith S.,"Dallas, TX",8,43,39,2.0,8/22/2012,The food here wasn't that good and the service was kind of rude and the drinks here is not that good also. I regret coming here
Ty L.,"Dallas, TX",1,55,,3.0,11/8/2010,"The first time I went, I made the mistake of ordering something other than pizza for dinner.  Don't get the baked potatoes and don't get the spinach and artichoke dip. They were pretty blah. I'll usually eat meh food just because I know I'm paying for it, but after a few nibbles... I just gave up. After that, I've stuck with the pizzas, other appetizers and chicken-fried steak. I really enjoyed the Mediterranean pizza, and I love their southwest eggrolls. My sister never orders anything other than the chicken-fried steak and she gets about three meals out of the giant portion they serve you. Go somewhere else for drinks because they're pretty damn steep here."
