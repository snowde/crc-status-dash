Danny Z.,"Grand Prairie, TX",17,25,25,4.0,8/3/2009,"Great deep dish pizza! From the simple Cheese and Tomato, to the Hawaiian, to the Works. I haven't had one I didn't love yet. They also have a variety of other food from great salads to burgers and I even saw some chicken lettuce wraps. Something for everyone for sure, but first-timers should definitely get a pizza as that's what they are known for. The beers are good too. They have something for every taste. If you want a light American beer, go with the Blonde and you'll likely enjoy it. Don't be afraid to try something different!"
Todd C.,"Hurst, TX",4,27,,3.0,1/24/2010,We went to the one in Hurst.  it is a very nice place.  The food was good but it is kind of the same ol same ol that I've grown used around HEB.  Nothing on the menu looked too interesting so I ordered a turkey sandwich.  I'm always leary of getting sandwich at these types of places because they are extra thick and stacked high.  When you go to take a bite everything falls out of the bottom.  It didn't turn out that bad though.  I guess if you are a beer coniseur you can try their micro brews and watch sports.  Not many choices for desert.  Some kind of cookie with a weird name.  Good place for what it is.
Sir S.,"Arlington, TX",0,29,,3.0,8/18/2011,"Not bad.  Food is decent, and they have a ton of screens to watch the game.  On par with like a Chilis or Bennegans..."
Tina L.,"Bedford, TX",2,4,,3.0,2/23/2010,Good place 2 go for happy hour. It's your typical restaurant /bar. Good non-alcoholic drinks. Their pizzas are good. $$$.
Dannie W.,"Fort Worth, TX",108,51,8,4.0,8/7/2010,"So many beers so little time.  Be ready to wait if you don't get here early for dinner.  But if you do have to wait, they walk around with free samples of pizza during dinner.  Sweeeeeet!!!  Too bad they don't walk around with free samples of the beer too!  The portions here are huge so split something you have room for the pizookie!!"
Joyce L.,"Tarrant, TX",0,5,,1.0,4/19/2012,"This is the seventh time we have been there.   It will definitely be the very last.  Lunch April 19 2012 11:30AM. Not at all crowded. Husband prefers bar area.  First of all I have hated the place from day 1.  Ask any member of my family where I won't go in the Highland's Arlington Texas and they will tell you Not BJ's.  3 evening meals crowded and rushed.  Not the right drinks we ordered and we were not in the bar area.  The chicken dish ordered was cold and mushy noodles.  Paid our bill and always tip 20%.  Another time on a Sunday after church. again a mistake crowded and not good service. Vowed never to go back.  Next time lunch time during week.  Soup and sandwich, broccoli cheese for hubby.  Came out cold my chicken strips and fries were awesome.  Next time Saturday lunch was awful. No crackers for soup.  What restaurant does not serve crackers with soup.  No sweet and low for tea.  Have so many rules bout lunch and dinner menus.  OK have a separate menu.. ONE FOR DINNER AND ONE FOR LUNCH. TODAY APRIL 19 2012 ordered Cream Soda and Root beer your own brew.  Guess what no Cream soda.  Ordered Broccoli Cheddar soup,  Right you got it not Broccoli cheeese soup today.  Something else.  Oh forgot the menu on the page we were to order from had nasty dried food on it.  Husband asked for manager, she thought he was joking.  Do you want to order now she said.  NO was our answer?  The waiters everytime we have been there are not attentive, Oh we asked for water with lemon.  No lemon.  Had to ask for that.  Do not go there unless you drink and don't give a rat's hair!!!!"
C K.,"Arlington, TX",4,24,,4.0,6/17/2009,"Yes-it is a chain.  But, dangit if it isn't always good.  I have never had a problem with service or food.  Last time our avocadoe eggrolls (best thing there) came a little late (which we wouldn't have known if the manager didn't tell us they would be) and they paid for our appetizer.  This never happens anymore.  All of the sandwhiches are fantastic and the fries are always crispy.  There is nothing worse than soggy food.  The fish tacos are even good.  I really enjoy the beer-try a flight if you haven't had many varieties."
Solomon W.,"Austin, TX",514,2583,7,3.0,1/12/2009,"Great place for parties, but it is always an insanely long wait on busy nights.  Overall, the food is pretty good for franchise cuisine.  The deep dish pizza is a reliable choice here and is the house specialty.  I don't know how it ranks up against true Chicago deep dish, but I can say that the toppings are numerous, and you have your choice of many different combos.  Offerings range from corn to chicken to sausage.  I usually get the 5+ topping pizza and just completely smother it in random ingredients.  Crust is a bit soggy, and doughy, but maybe its meant to be that way, as the pizza is extremely thick and hearty.  Not too greasy, but nothing too special.  I don't think it classifies as true Chicago deep dish, but it is not bad pie.  Other offerings are traditional American group food such as burgers, pastas, and dinner plates, all of which are not bad.  Most are just slightly fancier than casual cuisine and are prepared fairly well.  One big perk here is the ""Pizookie"" which is basically a deep dish cookie.  4 different flavors, all pretty good and sweet.  Great place to take a group for a fun night with some alright food.  There's a little bit of something for everyone, even beer lovers."
