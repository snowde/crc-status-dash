Nathan G.,"Galveston, TX",21,9,3,2.0,8/9/2017,"I've been to a few bjs and every time their vegan lentil soup is on point. But every time I eat at this particular bjs, the soup comes out lumpy and Luke warm. My cucumber mint sparkling water was nasty af. But the spinach artichoke dip is always on point! Come on BJs!!"
Rebecca R.,"Buffalo, MN",5,45,35,2.0,11/1/2016,"Overpriced for the service, food and quality. Better off getting a steak.  They brought salad and no dressing.  Had to wait 10 minutes to get it, once we caught her attention.  Tortilla soup had soggy tortilla strips,  asked for more or to replace with fresh ones. That took another 10 minutes.  Servers cater to business people verse regular customers."
Leslie D.,"Arlington, TX",44,124,293,2.0,5/25/2016,"I am not a huge fan of BJ's but the mom wanted to visit for Mother's Day since she likes it so you do what you have to do. It feels like a glorified Chili's with an even bigger menu to slog through. We started with the avocado rolls, in which the menu boasted this glorious picture of these delicious fried spicy avocado spring rolls. What we received were soggy, not fried enough, and doughy pieces of ""rolls"".  I had the steak and it came with two sides.  I chose clam chowder which tasted decent the next day when I heated it in my microwave instead of the stone cone bowl they served me. The tomatoes and mozzarella with balsamic had good flavor and was my favorite part of the meal.  The steak was fine. It was cooked as requested and was about what you expect for the price and restaurant. The kids meals were the standard fried junk or lackluster pasta.  The best part of the meal were the pizookies. OMG how delicious!! I will be back just to order these for dessert. We had the pick three and got salted caramel, white chocolate macadamia, and cookies and cream. The salted caramel was out of this world good."
Michael S.,"Fort Worth, TX",30,209,59,3.0,11/14/2016,"""A-OK"" is probably slightly over-rated for this visit, but I might give this place another chance.  The food didn't agree with me, but it had good flavors.  I'll just try something different next time."
Jimmy-Mandie N.,"Eastland, TX",2,10,4,5.0,10/7/2016,"First: with expectations of a 30 minute wait we got seated 15 minutes into the wait.   Second: the server Kennedy was on top of things!! Everytime we needed anything she was there, I'm telling y'all if you can ask for her. We dined in at 8:30 pm on a Friday night and the place was slammed yet she was there everytime.  Third: the food was so good...we ordered the steak also the Bacon Brisket topped burger. Both of our meals we so good."
Nara C.,"Arlington, TX",0,7,2,5.0,10/11/2017,My husband and I decided to try this restaurant a few months ago. So far the food has been great. The service is a hit and miss. We have experienced attentive wait staff and not so good wait staff. They also have a lot of choices. They have a book for a menu.
Cecelia S.,"Arlington, TX",38,59,1,5.0,12/13/2016,"Came in for a late afternoon lunch ... started with one of their signature side salads, mushrooms with asparagus, it was delicious!  Followed by an actual French Dip, on a toasty bun with lots of delicious pot of juice to dip it in!    Service was fast and professional, my drink was kept filled, and someone checked in on me enough to be complete but not so much as to be overwhelming.   A very nice, warming experience, good for ""one person"" or a family or group.  Definitely a win!"
Allison L.,"Arlington, TX",0,1,,2.0,9/25/2017,"First off, our waiter wasn't the friendliest.. my hubby's chicken that he ordered was super dry and the waiter tried offering him a sauce to make up for it... ummm no, sir. I ordered a simple chicken salad and it was awful. It tasted like someone had put mint leaves in there! Our waiter seemed annoyed that we didn't want either of our meals anymore (we only took a couple bites of it). Manager came over, offered to replace our meals and give us a dessert (very kind of him). We honestly just wanted to get the heck out of there. We waited about 10 more minutes for our waiter to bring us our check for our appetizer and finally just up and left with cash on the table. Very unsatisfactory service :-/"
Al U.,"Grand Prairie, TX",1,5,,1.0,8/8/2016,Went to BJs tonight The waitress was awesome  I have a credit card that looks a little rough but when entered manually goes through just perfect  I gave it to the waitress and let her know it wouldn't swipe and needs to be entered manually. I have used this credit card dozens of times with no problems. I work retail and am currently a retail manager for 17 years  The manager comes over to our table and refuses the card. I asked why and he said he couldn't take it. If he entered it manually he would loose points. Wow--- loose points was the only reason. In the customer service business credit cards are ran manually for numerous reasons.  Loosing points is not one of them So sad. Lucky I had another credit card and did not push the issue.  Let's get it together BJs I am not the only customer that needs a manual push through.
Samuel C.,"Arlington, TX",10,17,11,3.0,9/12/2016,"Went to lunch with my wife today app was great, burger and potato wedges was great came in a 1/4 size tray instead of plate my food was good but service was disappointed. Our waitress start off great but after drink and took our order didn't get to see her again. Our drinks was empty for a long time and many servers walk passed us no one seem to care then she pop up to clean the plate and asked for anything else then refilled my ice tea  with no iced in it....iced tea or warm tea not sure"
tammy b.,"Arlington, TX",0,14,4,5.0,11/17/2016,We love coming here for date night awesome atmosphere great bar food and drinks are the best - we live the service
Brian S.,"Arlington, TX",9,62,10,5.0,1/28/2017,"In the past month I have frequented this restaurant about 3 times. I have zero bad things to say about this place.The food is always tastes perfect.  The menus is huge and it is SO HARD for me to choose what to eat. This place doesn't just have one type of food they have Mexican, Italian, Chinese, American, and more! They have something for EVERYONE. The servers are good too!"
Nikki A. J.,"Fort Worth, TX",144,172,135,5.0,3/4/2016,"I do believe I have found my favorite drink at BJ's but the food and the atmosphere were both fantastic as well. I've only been to BJ's once, awhile ago and never really thought to return simply because I forgot there was one in Arlington and one near me in Fort Worth.  The atmosphere was pleasant. It was quite intimate for my date and myself. It wasn't too noisy or crowded when we went on a Monday night.  The food was great for the both of us except for the calamari. We wanted it a little more spicy and crispy but nothing a little Tabasco couldn't fix. I had the Pink Panther for my drink choice and it was phenomenal, unlike any other drink that I have ever tasted. I was very impressed. He had a grilled cheese sandwich which was really tasty and I opted for chicken Alfredo (I know boooooring) but it was actually very yummy as well. The sauce was creamy just the way I liked it! I will definitely frequent BJs more often!"
Kendall S.,"Fort Worth, TX",3052,762,1332,4.0,11/26/2014,"I stopped in here for lunch with my brother recently, and our whole experience was pretty good. Our waiter was training and he seemed a little bit clueless about the menu, but he was really nice and attentive, so all was well.  We each had a berry cider (BJ's own), which are always bright and bubbly and good (about $5 each). Then we decided to share the roasted kale and Brussel sprout salad ($10) as well as a gluten free pizza with roasted garlic and pepperoni ($10 small pizza + $1 per topping). For a restaurant that seems to serve absolutely every genre of food ever, I think BJ's actually makes a really great GF pizza. It's small, but the crust is nice and toasty and the toppings are fairly generous. The salad was also really delicious! All of the ingredients went great together; kale, goat cheese, dried cranberries, candied pecans, apples, and Brussel sprouts (although they were a bit tough). For dessert, my brother convinced me to share the GF chocolate chip pizzookie with him, which was good but way too sweet for my taste. It's like a giant, undercooked, doughy, hot and melty cookie with cold vanilla ice cream on top. Really delicious GF dessert (at least for the first few bites for me). So sweet and filling! Service was good and I continue to be impressed with BJ's menu despite that fact that it's so varied. Plus, prices are fair and this place is open pretty place, giving me a safe and satisfactory GF restaurant to retreat to after a long night!"
Amber W.,"Irving, TX",70,36,36,3.0,9/6/2016,"I come to this place specifically for the avocado egg rolls and the pizookie ! Both are so good. I'll keep returning to this place because of these two items. As for the service, our waiter seemed very busy and flustered. He brought us our appetizer without any plates. It took another 8 minutes for him to come back to our table to give us plates. I will still return, because the food is excellent. Hopefully just receive a more attentive server the next time."
Dan A.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,2,4.0,7/14/2016,"As a former California, Bj's was the place I would go drink and hangout with coworkers after work. I was so delighted to find out that Bj' is also close to me here! I love the burgers here, I forget the name of the burger but it comes with guacamole, pepper jack, and bacon. It goes great with a nice cold one.  The service was great my waitress had always had a smile, was always checking up on us, for the hour we were there are mugs were always full. The atmosphere reminded me of California with a southern twist."
Clifton J.,"Grand Prairie, TX",3,15,,4.0,1/22/2017,Great food and service today at BJ's.  Wife had ribs and baked potato and it was excellent.  I had jambalaya and it was very tasty.  Dessert time.
Loni B.,"Beacon, NY",134,4,1,4.0,5/9/2017,Great place with great food. Service was fast and friendly. My mom ordered the guacamole bacon burger and said it was phenomenal. I had the BJ burger with bacon and cheese. It was a nice size and had good flavor. My daughter ordered from the children's menu and enjoyed the child sized pazookie!!
Doc G.,"Dallas, TX",180,265,499,4.0,5/28/2016,"Love the Sriracha Brussel sprouts.. Wow. Last time I was here I had to order another skillet full of sprouts to enjoy the next day. Nice atmosphere. Surprisingly not too grown on a Saturday night, thankfully since our son is with us. Good, mixed crowd. We three were able to find something to eat - no small feat. Good, lively music, but not too loud. Overall, a good experience worth repeating, especially with the TVs showing NBA playoffs and boxing! Yessir"
Julie C.,"Parker, CO",16,66,21,4.0,2/1/2017,"I've never had a bad experience at any BJ's in any state. I wish there was one close to where I live. I love going there on my birthday when I can splurge on a pazookie! A cookie baked in a griddle with ice cream on top. The pizza is delish. The tap beers are always good. My favorite entree is the honey mustard chicken salad. The restaurant is attractive and offers something for anyone. It deserves more than an average of 3 stars. Come to Parker, CO please! PS there are plenty of tvs."
