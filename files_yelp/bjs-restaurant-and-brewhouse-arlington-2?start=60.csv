Cyrill K.,"Dallas, TX",0,44,,4.0,4/8/2017,"Great food, great beer, try the ahi tuna salad. The restaurant is always supper busy. Love it here"
Tatiana M.,"Long Beach, CA",166,2,2,1.0,3/17/2017,"Terrible service for the two times I've come here. The food is ok, but the service has made each dinner a negative experience."
Lana M.,"Grapevine, TX",2,19,2,2.0,1/22/2017,I have been coming here for years fish tacos. They were always the best in town. Now the fish sticks are half the size they used to be and the tea glass as well. What is that????  I will no longer go out of my way to eat here
Raimond N.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,7,,2.0,8/4/2016,"20 minutes for a glass of water. I literally just gave up on waitinf and started waving my hands at every server there. Two of them walked past me even though we made eye contact. Honestly the servicewas terrible.  I thought the Pizookie and the ravioli was bomb while eating it... But... Honestly the pizzookie was very thin. Like we orderedyhe regular aized one and it was like a thin pizza crust. I feel like the only thing I would come back for is the ravioli, but I feel like I could get that cheaper somewhere else."
Brittany D.,"Grand Prairie, TX",16,16,,3.0,7/12/2016,"I order the same thing every time I'm here.  It's never consistent.  There are good days and bad days.  Salty days and bland days. My brother loves this place, so the chances that I'll be back are high. The upside is that I would definitely order the desserts and appetizer sampler!  P.s. don't order the burgers. The buns are dry, but who knows. You might be lucky and get a soft fresh one."
Lauren M.,"Fort Worth, TX",273,219,642,2.0,7/24/2014,"Dined here with hubby on a Monday night and we were greeted and seated immediately.  Our server, Amber, was friendly, helpful and quick eith service and checking back. I had the Very Berry cider that was awesome!  Cold, crisp and refreshing.  Hubby had some kind of weird beers, both of which he enjoyed. I ordered a mini-pan pizza, with extra cheese, extra sauce on B J's favorite.  I mistakenly ordered that instead of the Classic Combo, which is what I really wanted.  I also added a house salad, which was $3.25 with the pizza.  The salad was a mix of that tickley lettuce, carrots and croutons.  Pretty small for the price tag. Hubby ordered the Ahi Poke, which is chopped sashimi grade ahi tuna, mixed with onions and some kind of sauce.  Served with crispy won ton triangles that were great! My pizza arrived, on a plate, not in the pan like the bigger ones are served.  I cut up one piece and noticed there was NO sauce and it didn't look like extra cheese.  Amber offered to bring me a side or sauce or to have it remade.  I opted for the remake and she was sweet enough to have them hold the olives for me!  (Cost of my mini pizza was $12, and nowhere near a good value.) The replacement pizza came and had a smudge of sauce, not much cheese, and by then I was ready to go, so I ate one small piece, boxed up the rest and in the trash it went later that night. From the restaurant, we went over to a friend's house and when he heard about my pizza foibles, he quickly ordered two larges from Pizza Hut!  Those pizzas were much better than the mini at BJ's, without the hefty price tag!"
Mary N.,"Mansfield, TX",121,92,18,1.0,3/22/2016,Almost every single time I order a chocolate chip cookie pizooki to go for me to pick up.....IT'S ALWAYS BURNT! And I only live 8 minutes away it's not like my food is sitting there for 20 minutes or something without me touching it. Hope this doesn't happen to everyone but it seems to always happen to me. :/
Victoria E.,"Dallas, TX",103,185,292,4.0,5/13/2016,The Parmesan crusted chicken with fries and a salad is definitely the way to go. But honestly you can't go wrong with any item on the menu. I will warn you if you plan to come during their prime hours be prepared to spend at least two hours.
Kellie S.,"San Antonio, TX",2,7,,5.0,4/19/2016,"First visit to this BJs. Couldn't have been better. Really enjoyed the food. We were visiting with family and were not rushed or hurried along. Keep it up! The server was attentive and didn't mind special requests, and she took special care to make sure the pace of the meal was appropriate.   We were a table of mostly seniors, so there was a lot of sharing of entree's and food changed from menu specs'.    I've not been to a bad BJ's yet."
Keith D.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,33,1,4.0,7/8/2017,Great fresh food. Had a salad everything was fresh. Really impressed. Bit pricey but worth it.  Customer service was good. Nice atmosphere.
Christy D.,"Grand Prairie, TX",495,106,555,4.0,4/21/2014,"I come here frequently, mostly because it's one of the latest restaurant that stays open till 12 in the highlands.  I always start off with the spinach stuffed mushroom! The sauce that comes with it is so good. & The tortilla soup is my favorite! It would be better if the soup came out hot, and not warm/room temp. I've tried many of the pastas, my favorite one though has to be their jambalaya! It's much better than their cajun pasta.  If you're looking for pizzas, BJ has deep dish, hand toss, and even flatbread pizza. I just recently tried the BBQ chicken.. It was okay. You would think it'll look more appealing, but it came out looking so plain! Just chicken & cilantro. I order pizzas in individual size and it's still shareable.  I do like BJ's menu though, they have a huge selection of food and drinks.  For desserts of course you have to have a pizookie!! Or their beignet, it is delicious :) not anything like New Orleans beignet, but one of the better beignet you can get around here."
Candice A.,"North Richland Hills, TX",5,4,2,2.0,6/14/2017,"I am only giving BJ's two stars due to the service. My husband and I went for dinner Friday evening.  First, the hostess sat us in the bar without even asking if we were ok with sitting in the bar area. Then, when our order arrived, my husband did not receive what he ordered. When my husband informed the waiter that he didn't order the California Club flatbread, the waiter said ""you did order the California club flatbread"" I wish I could remember the server's name so I could warn everyone. That was so rude that he actually started to argue with a customer as to what they ordered. What kind of customer service is that???? He also mumbled and barely spoke to where you could understand what he was saying.  Also, the mozzarella sticks were supposed to have been a happy hour special for $6. We were charged the full $8.95. At that point, my husband was too frustrated to even say anything. I'm sure the server would have probably been rude about that too. Overall bad experience, not sure yet if we will return or not"
Meagen R.,"Mesquite, TX",154,6,1,5.0,1/11/2017,"Me and my boyfriend went out for a late lunch today, havent even got our food yet (although im sure it will great), but i just had to say that our server Andy has been absolutely amazing! Very polite, helpful and just an all around great server definitely will be back and will only ask for Andy from now on !"
Donna W.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,6,,1.0,12/26/2016,"I love BJ'S  and what they stand for.  Just ask a waiter or waitress to show you their card with principles expected.   However, this location is always challenged.  The wait staff is great, but the kitchen slow on last three visits.  Food served cold, really short staffed tonight.   The manager made it right but still, they need to fix this."
Kimberly Y.,"Arlington, TX",234,115,154,2.0,4/4/2016,"Food: Food was ok. I got a Clam Chowder in a bread bowl and by group consensus, my Clam Chowder came out waaay too salty. It tasted like they scooped this soup out of the Dead Sea. No one was able to finish it. But the Sourdough bread bowl it was in was amazing, it was a shame that the soup inside was not. The artichoke dip was also very lacking, it tasted very store-bought. My salad was pretty ok, kinda hard to mess that up.  Service: Alright this was a kicker, so I call earlier in the day and ask if BJ's takes reservations. I get told they don't accept reservations for dinner times after 6 or 7pm (I forget) and was then put on the phone with the manager to see what they could do about it.The manager said they could ""put my name down"" to keep us in mind. WHAT? If yall can't take reservations just tell me ""No""! I'm an adult who can handle rejection, just tell it to me straight. So I give them my name to see what might happen later. Later my family and I arrive to BJ's. There was a confusion about why my name was given and that they'd do the best they can to accommodate us. 30-35 minutes later, we get taken to our table. Emphasis on TAKEN TO OUR TABLE. Because, our table of 6 had 2 chairs! So 4 of us stood there at the table like idiots for 5 minutes while waiters were scrambling to find chairs.  Why even seat us if you don't even have CHAIRS for us all to sit in? I'd rather have waited that extra 5 minutes than have 4 of my party stand there awkwardly avoiding people's weird looks as to why we were starved of chairs."
Sohaib A.,"Grand Prairie, TX",3,10,31,2.0,1/31/2016,"We come here regularly for amazing pizza and dessert.  Love the BJs pan pizzas that we can't have up in New York. Service is usually decent but today our waiter (Elizabeth) was completely uninterested and lacking any sort of customer service from the start. No offer of drinks,  and the check was brought to us without asking if we were even done! Not a single time were we even asked if everything was ok. Surprised that mgmt would allow service like this."
P H.,"Grand Prairie, TX",2110,1595,4321,2.0,1/3/2015,"Decor: 3/5 -Booths and tables that can comfortably seat 5-6 people Service: 3/5 -standard, nothing out of the ordinary Food: 2/5 -I had the Jambalaya (as recommended by the server) and the dish was just extremely salty. Same with the Cajun Pasta -The apps were good however. I enjoyed the avocado rolls and the flat bread pizzas. I wasn't impressed with the fried calamari."
Tung N.,"Arlington, TX",416,133,139,2.0,1/7/2016,"One of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. I came there for a birthday dinner, which is usually the only reason why I would go there. They took our drink orders pretty quickly, but it took at least 10-15 minutes for me to get my beer...wut. I ordered the clam chowder and a ceasar salad, and it left my stomach hurting. I don't know what it was, but my stomach was churning after I finished my food. It never felt like that before. To add more salt to the wound, it literally took probably 45 minutes to an hour to get our checks. I couldn't even bother to have any of their desserts, famously the pizookies, because of my upset stomach. Safe to say I'll try to avoid this place in the future if at all possible. The reason I gave it an extra star is because our waitress was really friendly, but that was the only up side to my experience."
Andre C.,"Arlington, TX",47,21,2,2.0,1/14/2016,"Terrible overpriced place. Their pizza decent, but service is horrible. Do not get the any kind of cheese dip or the artichoke dip! VERY GRIDDY! Taste like it was made with government cheese!  I've been here a several times and its always the same. Bad service, overpriced food and drinks. This is Arlington, so many better place to go."
