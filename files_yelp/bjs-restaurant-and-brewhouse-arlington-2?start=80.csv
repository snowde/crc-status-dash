Faira C.,"Fort Worth, TX",50,3,1,3.0,8/7/2016,The food was meh! We had the sampler appetizer platter and there was no real flavor to it.   But the beer and spirit selection is what keeps people coming back.  Service was excellent!... But man the food needs to improve. I would give the drinks and service a 5 star.
James C.,"Cedar Hill, TX",15,9,31,5.0,5/21/2016,It was very good food.  The waitress was so friendly.  We enjoyed our time. They want me say more so what do you add it was great and we really did enjoy our time
Brandee G.,"Eastside, Fort Worth, TX",183,147,225,3.0,2/10/2015,"I always get the balsamic glazed chicken that comes with mashed potatoes and is served over baby greens, you get all the flavor of an unhealthy meal and will be satisfied without feeling too guilty because the chicken is grilled, and there are greens on the plate! My fiancé likes fish, but I would not recommend eating seafood here. It's not cooked well in my opinion- this is a sports bar, so not everything on the menu is excellent. I am not fan of the avocado egg rolls, the snacks and small bites are tiny, not really shareable. The pizza is always a great choice, my favorite is Mediterranean, but they are all delicious. And if it's your first time and you like sweets don't pass up on their signature dessert, the pizookie! Fresh baked cookie of your choice topped with vanilla bean icecream. The menu is diverse, so there is something for everyone."
Cassandra G.,"Dallas, TX",84,37,73,4.0,3/3/2016,I got the Quinoa Bowl with Roasted Salmon  and my Friend got a Classic Burger. The food and Service was good. Enjoyed it!
Maria P.,"Burleson, TX",2,51,13,1.0,7/28/2016,"The food was tolerable. Nothing to rave about. The ""pan pizza"" was dry and not worth the money. The shrimp tacos well, were all cabbage so I sent them back for the fish.  The fish tacos were pretty awesome and spicy, but maybe a little too much sauce. I would come back for the fish tacos had everything else been better. The service was HORRIBLE! Our waiter was polite, and I didn't stiff him for his tip even thought we thought that was the worst restaurant service we'd ever experienced. We sat forever! After having to find people to ask for tea & water refills and out waiter forgot to bring  salad dressing and marinara for the dry pizza, we were done. I took my check, got up complained to the manager and paid him then left.  Even he was too busy. BJ's is understaffed and unorganized. We will never go back."
Ben M.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,6,,4.0,10/28/2016,"Got a chance to visit this location and I must say the bartender was fabulous.  He was engaging with her lunch customers,  very attentive.  I stop by for a glass of beer and they had a huge variety. Even if the food sucked I would have rated my visit favorably.  However the food was fantastic my birthday lunch was nothing short of fabulous.  Great job I will be back."
Roy D And Lisa Kay E.,"Burleson, TX",4,5,,1.0,9/27/2015,"No Stars for this place!!!! Melissa Johnson the Dining Room Manager denied my wife service, for two reasons, #1. She stated she saw my wife stagger, don't understand where that came from at all! #2. She additionally stated that after speaking with my wife she felt unable to serve my wife. Guess what my wife has a SERIOUS speech impediment resulting from a serious automobile accident when she was 18 of which the physicians didn't even expect her to live, additionally they said she would NEVER be able to speak again!  NEVER!!!  This woman overcame those that came against her and persevered and LIVED!!!  And you have have the audacity to refuse her service because you said someone saw her stumble and after speaking with her you deemed her intoxicated?  She was legally DECAPITATED!!!  I will be glad to show the EMergency Room reports showing her prognosis.  We will NEVER come to this establishment!  And we will follow up with the General Manager and Shareholder, Paul Bentley.  I sure hope you have video, because this is gonna get good!!!"
Alison J.,"Fort Worth, TX",290,170,721,3.0,12/13/2015,"I've had some bad experiences at this restaurant. I've gone here multiple times to try and eat and there's always a super long wait. One time they said it would be two hours, I looked inside and half of the restaurant was empty. Luckily for me, when I went there this time there was no wait. We ordered the chicken flatbread and a kids Mac and cheese. We had a little issue thing to order the Mac and cheese, the waiter was like I don't know if we can do that, but I'll have to ask (keep in mind I'm an adult, but I didn't want to eat anything else on them menu and I wasn't that hungry so I thought it would be fine). I'm thinking to myself, why can I order the stupid Mac and cheese!? Why would she even need to ask her manager?! Our food came out later, the flatbread tasted really good. It had chicken, avocado, some tomato, cheese and a garlic aioli sauce. My Mac and cheese tasted like a poor attempt of making Kraft Mac and cheese. It looked like it was taken out of a microwaveable tray and put on a plate but whatever, maybe kids love it. I'm giving this place 3 stars because the food was decent and the place felt clean, but combined with previous experiences being here is why it's not higher and plus this place isn't any different than your other food chains."
Daniel B.,"Mansfield, MA",23,61,44,1.0,10/13/2015,This is the 2nd time I been here and service is no good told that the  photo of darkside of the moon beer I ordered is photo shopped. The beer comes mixed ? Its in the menu as like a black and tan . a porter on top of a blue moon .  I was here 8 months ago and they try telling me a stip steak was a ribeye steak .it took them 1 hr to get it right and didn't take anything off the  bill or say they made a mistake. I will tell everyone I know don't go to any of this places!
Paul C.,"Arlington, TX",0,16,,3.0,10/6/2016,"We were promptly seated and not a busy night. Sat at table for over 10 minutes without being  acknowledged. I get it but at least acknowledge us. We chose to leave. I will absolutely go back and try again, just disappointed on this visit. Revised my rating as the GM reached out immediately to resolve my concern. I appreciate that."
Damon B.,"Arlington, TX",541,287,77,4.0,7/22/2015,"Whenever we come to BJ's my family is never disappointed.  We came for an early Friday dinner and we were sat immediately. Having been to BJ's many times, we all usually gravitate to our normal choices, Pizza, Hamburgers, the like.  This time, we all ordered something different. We started with our normal off the menu appetizer.  Bruschetta and Spinach/Artichoke dip.  BJ's used to have this on the menu, and every time we ask for it, they say no problem.  It is a FANTASTIC COMBO! I really wanted a pizza, but no one wanted to share.  I wanted the Chicken Bacon Ranch (Great by the way), but I had no takers.  DANG IT!   Well, my wife ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, my daughter had the BBQ pulled pork, my son had the California Chicken Club, and I had the baby back ribs.  Everyone loved their food, but daughter only had a few bites of her pork sandwich because she did not like the taste of the sauce.  One to always come to the rescue, I gave her some of my ribs in exchange for her sandwich. She really liked the ribs, and I really liked the pork sandwich.  DAD saves the day again. We all shared the Pizookie Trio, of chocolate chunk, salted caramel, and cookies and cream.  All three were fantastic. Service was great, refills were taken care of, and another great meal at BJ's.   They do have other things on the menu besides pizza.  Also, try the Jeremiah Red.  great beer. Stay hungry my friends..."
Hannah M.,"Arlington, TX",0,2,,1.0,3/11/2017,"I love BJs but our service last night sucked! Our waitress talked to two other waiters the whole night and literally gave my friend and I the worst service ever! Plus, she pulled out her phone by the bar when we were waiting for refills and our check... she asked if we were ready for our check and then we ended up waiting 10 minutes for it while she talked to the two other waiters... My friend and I got there at 10, got drinks shortly after and we didn't leave till 12:35... the only reason we were there so long was because we had to wait forever on our server! Seriously, I wanted a quick meal and Pizookie but I ended up waiting for my server while she talked to her friends the whole night... I was really planning on giving a good tip that night since I had just finished working a double at the restaurant I work at... SORRY Blanca, you did a very poor job."
Rudolph P.,"Dallas, TX",405,15,120,5.0,1/12/2016,"Awesome awesome AWESOME PLACE!!!!!! The atmosphere is off the chain, the wait staff is incredible, and the food, no matter what you order, you'll love it!!!!!"
Asher B.,"Nashville, TN",55,59,166,5.0,7/30/2014,"I'd honestly like to do two separate reviews for this place. One a five star review for the beers they serve, and a another, a four star review for their food. I've been to BJ's more than a couple of times but never sat down to write a review until now. I must say, I just love the beers they have. I've tried most of them but here are a few favorites and why - PM porter for it's coffee like taste, Jeremiah Red for it's distinct taste (a lil fruity), Harvest Hefeweizen for this being my chill beer. I tried their clam chowder soup in a bread bowl and it was quite delicious. Their hand tossed pizzas are also quite well made, nothing extraordinary but not disappointing too.  Their staff is friendly and keeps a check on you when required. If you are confused between a few dishes go ahead and ask em, they do quite a good job in helping you out with what to order. All in all BJ's is a nice place, be it for a date, just hanging out with friends or even for lunch."
James P.,"Arlington, TX",260,190,130,4.0,5/27/2016,Service is always on point. Food for the most part is good. I really like the cream sodas.
Shelby B.,"Arlington, TX",0,8,,3.0,7/17/2016,The pazookie is the only thing that will really bring me back to this place. I've tried multiple menu items from the shareable pizzas to the fancy salads and they just don't measure up to the quality or price you'd want to spend.
LaShaundra H.,"Arlington, TX",9,19,6,5.0,7/16/2016,there's a flatbread California chicken something with avocado..thee best! love the atmosphere and the kids love their cheese and pepperoni pizza. not too pricey and fills you up. oh and I like the chocolate chip pizookie
Reena P.,"Dallas, TX",13,59,2,4.0,6/1/2015,"I've been to BJs numerous times and I have never had a bad experience.  I have tried many of the flat breads and their new chicken pita tacos.  Both are delicious options.  Their drinks tend to be on the sweeter side but still not too bad.  Last time I went the service was a little slow but they were also incredibly busy so it was understandable.   I usually get the pazookie for dessert, but this last time I tried the strawberry beignet dessert and it was DELICIOUS.  My brother and I shared it and it was disappeared in under a minute.   Not a bad place to enjoy a casual night!"
Brian R.,"Brownsboro, AL",2,235,135,4.0,9/6/2015,"My friends and I were in town for the BAMA WI game and had great parking in the media area but everything close by was packed with a waiting list.  We wanted some drinks and snacks.  I called an Uber driver to help out someone in our group in the media and he said go to Arlington Heights.  Great recommendation.  I've been to BJ's in CA and NC.  We now have one in Huntsville, al.  This was a great location before the game.  I wish we had know 2 hours before hand.  Had a few drinks and snacks and we made it to Jerry's world with plenty of time to spare.  Avoid the crowds and go here.  Close enough to stadium even in traffic to get to your seat.  BTW, the beer choices are great and the spinach artichoke dip was the bomb."
Pat K.,"Alvarado, TX",0,14,,2.0,12/26/2016,"Food was okay, nothing spectacular. We waited too long for each course, from our beers to dessert. In other words, service was really bad. Our waitress appeared to be working in a different world. We paid our check before even getting our dessert. How ridiculous was that!! I might try it again, but not at this location, nope, no way."
