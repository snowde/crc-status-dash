Yvonne H.,"Denver, CO",59,67,165,4.0,12/15/2017,"We've been to this chain quite a bit in Phoenix, this first time here . The drinks were spot on. We had the Blood Orange Pom Sangria, because it's Sangria. Well this Sangria has Fireball whiskey and it has a nice kick.  Ordered avocado egg rolls. Tasty but a bit pricey. Plenty on the plate for sharing.  The food: It was a bit busy, yes Friday night busy. It finally came delivered by a chef and both the salmon dish and my Portobello buger were both warm/lukewarm. I'm hungry so I scarfed  it down it was good but a bit dry. Since it wasn't hot it wasn't juicy like I've usually received it. My other half was starving so he ate his salmon,warm but not hot. His side's were a bit on the cold side. Now I'm sure it's because it's Friday busy the food was not terribly bad but it was ok. Next time I'll stop by on a non weekend."
Jim C.,"Aurora, CO",0,36,1,3.0,1/1/2018,"I'll be honest, I come here for the root beer.  The ambiance is nice, the hosts usually seat us quickly, but I've never had an experience here where the following 3 criteria are met: 1) the order is actually right 2) the service isn't really slow 3) drinks are refilled Usually we get 2 out of 3, but never all 3.  It's too bad, really, because we drive 30 minutes to come here.  I think I'll stop though.  Good root beer isn't worth the other hassles."
Jennifer L.,"Aurora, CO",63,48,45,2.0,12/16/2017,"I've been in this BJ's brewhouse before and had pretty good service.  Actually been in here and had pretty good food before as well. Last night was a completely different story. Ordered a couple of pizzas and some snacks for my son and his friends. Had it delivered Via Door Dash.  Total came out to a $100. Had little bit of sticker shock, but ordered anyway.   The appetizers, salad, and cookies were good. The cookies were a little drier than I would have preferred. But they were certainly passible. The decent quality of these other items is the reason you get 2 stars instead of one. The pizza was terrible. I mean really really bad. The toppings were mostly centered in the middle of the pizza with the exterior a huge burned section of bread.  It tasted terrible, borderline inedible. Super disappointed, will not be giving them another chance on that front for sure.  I'm not a fan of spending a $100 to get pizza and snacks, but when I do I do not like to be burned, pun intended!"
Melisa U.,"Elizabeth, CO",52,179,568,1.0,9/26/2017,"Wow. Really bad service and really bad attitudes of employees here. I've been eating at BJs for years and have not had such a bad experience as I have had yesterday. We had a group of 5, with three of us not exactly skinny minnies and they tried to seat us in a small table (not even offering to move tables together) so we declined and asked to sit in a booth, which the hostess quite rudely said 'those tables are reserved for parties of 6 or more'. First of all, I saw three tables of four sitting at these round booths so that excuse was invalid. Secondly, we're not the skinniest of people, we probably could have been considered party of 7+ (weight wise) if you wanted to get technical. Our waitress Gena R. was amazing compared to the crap show of people hired at this location. She was attentive and kind and honestly the only good thing at this restaurant. The food was decent but the presentation of some things were severely lacking. The jambalaya plate was sloppily thrown together and they didn't even have the courtesy to wipe the edges clean before presenting it to us. The flatbread was cut very haphazardly, some pieces 1 inch while some were 3 inches. Very hard to eat when we were trying to divide it up between our group of 5.  The attitude of the workers here also needs to be improved. They literally smirked at us as they were delivering the food to the table. The only good waitress was Gena R."
Robert H.,"Denver, CO",164,634,1935,3.0,11/10/2017,"BJ's Restaurant is one of those places you go to grab a $6 beer and watch the game or celebrate a friends birthday over a $15 burger and $10 dessert. You wouldn't eat here for a casual $50 dinner in a sports bar style environment unless that's your thing. - Expect about 60 minutes from start to finish - Small parking lot - Good lunch/holiday specials - Excellent fries - Freebies with rewards program - Snag a table in the bar area to avoid waiting  When it comes to value compared to quality, there are plenty of other places to eat. If you're looking for some decent food and good beer while eating with good company, the long service wait times won't bother you. I enjoy talking with my wife, but for those of you that don't it may make the long wait bother you. Be sure to arrive with food company and not be in any type of rush. I've never made it out in less than 60 minutes and usually wait around 45 minutes for a table.  I ordered the chicken fried steak burger ($12.50) and the fries tasted double fried delicious. The burger was average size with a decent portion of avocado. I would order it again. Following my meal I ordered them snickerdoodle pizookie ($4.95) and it was gone in a few bites. Not recommended as a mini for two people."
Carrie P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",128,145,329,4.0,8/28/2017,"Big menu, great selection of drinks and fun atmosphere. I love that they offer vegetarian options! The cauliflower tacos are awesome!Seriously, it may not sound like your thing but don't knock them till you try them! Full of flavor and the salad that comes on the side is also amazing. I can't wait to try making these at home, I found a new favorite!  The iced coffee wasn't the best but once I added a shot of kahlua it was delicious!"
Carly P.,"Bennett, CO",979,601,2080,3.0,3/10/2017,"I haven't been here since I first moved to Colorado back in 2006. So it seemed I was long overdue to stop back in for a visit. + BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse prides its self on a rather impressive tap list. Which I'd have to agree is pretty darn good. + They have a selection of lighter options (called ""Enlightened Favorites"") on their menu which I decided to try and found the North Beach Mahi and Shrimp to be both tasty and filling! + My server was on point. He explained their rewards program to me, offered me a sample of a beer I was interested in, and checked back with me often to ensure everything was to my satisfaction. + Ambiance is nice. Like a classy dimly lit brewhouse. +/- Prices were alright. A bit more than I expected. - Felt like the rewards program must be a new focus and was almost over mentioned to me during my visit. The hostess mentioned it as she sat me and the server several times during my visit. I would probably just have the servers discuss it with their tables personally.  I'd definitely like to stop back in and try some of their other menu items!"
Avi Y.,"Woodland Hills, CA",193,2,,5.0,12/30/2017,"Came into Aurora with family. Service was amazing!!! Our server, Jordan, was super cool and took care of us like we were her friends. Food was the expected BJ goodness"
Kristin S.,"West Hills, CA",196,3,,5.0,12/30/2017,"We are in town from California, and I just want to say that we had one of the best experiences here. Our wonderful server, Jordan, took amazing care of us. She got every meal right, was extremely personable, and made us have a blast at our dinner table. She went out of her way to get our table of 16 people, everything we needed. So impressed! Go see Jordan at B.J.'s!!!"
Steven S H C.,"Denver, CO",745,646,1874,3.0,7/26/2017,"it's very spacious restaurant with hostess manning the front.  there was larger group sat next to us but luckily they were finishing up. I was hungry so as soon as waiter showed up, ordered everything.  appetizer came out very quick  (just chips and queso) but drink tool awhile.  has to remind him and he finally brought it out. food was huge portjon and price to match.  around $15 for entry.  check out the specials which are great deal.   3 stars suffice!"
Emily R.,"Pearland, TX",164,2,,2.0,1/8/2018,"The hostess was the most rude hostess I've ever dealt with. She rolled her eyes when we asked to sit at a booth with our kids. After that I saw her go up to two different people that worked there and say something that was clearly about us. She was just unpleasant from the minute we arrived and we were nothing but nice to her. This was yesterday (1/7 around noon). The food was okay and our waitress was good. We go to BJs a lot on our home town of Sugarland, TX frequently and never have had an issue."
Jacob F.,"Aurora, CO",12,98,66,1.0,4/15/2017,"Used to love to eat here and would once every few weeks however after an incident with one of the waiters that I won't go into and then another time when my wife ordered pasta and it came out frozen I refuse to go back. If it weren't for those two experiences then I would rate it much higher. Update: Terrible, terrible, terrible service. It seems like every time I go there we have an issue. Tonight we decided to give their delivery service a try. After 2 hours, we called to check on the status of our order and the person who answered said our order hadn't been processed yet and it would take another 90 minutes........really crappy because we used to enjoy their food for the most part, but the service always lets us down."
Leena N.,"Aurora, CO",82,116,164,3.0,2/7/2017,"Came here on Monday with my brothers to celebrate a birthday. We came here because it was in close proximity to where we were. We ordered the seared ahi salad, classic rib eye, and portobello swiss burger. It was not busy on a Monday night, but it still took awhile for the food to come out. The seared ahi salad and portobello swiss burger were delicious! However, the classic rib eye was okay. It was a bit tough and I was not a fan of the mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were lumpy and did not have a smooth texture. On the bright side, the waiter offered to buy a dessert for my brother for his birthday. The waiter was nice and attentive."
Tina R.,"Aurora, CO",20,40,3,5.0,11/11/2017,Excellent food and service Every time we have eaten here. It has become one of our favorites because there are so many wonderful choices. Really great drinks too.
Debra S.,"Parker, CO",0,25,2,3.0,12/27/2017,"I really like this place, the food is great, they have a variety of items but be sure to ask for your bill as soon as your food arrives or you could be waiting for awhile.  For some reason once your food is served they seem to forget you're there.  I'm not sure if they don't have enough staff to cover shifts but I can't tell you how many times I've waited and waited for my check and been late back to work after lunch."
D. Chase H.,"Arvada, CO",153,8,,2.0,9/11/2017,"I offer an extra star for effort. Speedy & accountable delivery services - perfect balance of competence & rapport. But the food needs serious work. Avocado egg roles were greasy as shit - could only handle half of one before my gall bladder started to spasm. The tomato bisque was a tasteless, boring, overly salty & bloating, dairy-gassy-constipating disaster. The Brussel Sprouts were flashed-cooked frozen disappointments. The baked ziti was a pile of shameful, lackluster noodles - tangled up with Slim-Jim's & cheese whiz.  Good workers though (honest, misguided?) - but sadly have no understanding of good food."
Annie G.,"San Diego, CA",844,111,303,3.0,10/24/2016,"Let's start with the pros: the beignets on the dessert menu and the overall variety of food/beers. Not sure what's going on here but service is awful (like others have noted). I recently went on a Sunday night with two girlfriends. There was no wait and the restaurant was fairly slow. Despite the empty place, no one checked up on us for the first 15 minutes, which set the tone for the rest of the night. Returning to order - slow. Getting our beers - slow. Getting our check - slow. Everything took a long time. I love the selection on the menu but it's also pricey for average bar/grill food (and $16 pastas)."
Mike S.,"Aurora, CO",1,11,,5.0,9/29/2017,"Wow!! What a fantastic experience!  Everyone from the waitstaff to the Manager Maria were amazing!  The food was great!  They were also very helpful with the two children we brought with us.  Even though they no longer make the Cheeseburger pizza (my favorite), Maria agreed to have the kitchen make us one.  I can't wait to be back!!  Great job Maria and Aurora BJ's!"
Una D.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",122,657,,3.0,6/5/2017,"this is a solid three star place. nothing glam, nothing to make you have diarrhea, u get me? i came here with one of my girlfriends while visiting from out of town. she did warn me about the lackluster food in the area but we arrived here to shoot the s  h   i  t. food ribeye-meh, rubbery texture despite being medium baked potato-good salad-good service our waitress seemed to take a really long time to get things to us and could have been a bit more attentive. but hey , a 20 year old doing this generally isnt doing it as a career incentive so i cut her slack, my friend was not happy about it, though because she had work in the morning price good for portion size ambiance i like this the most about this location, lots of booths which are spaced out parking free, lot overall: standard , american fare. i have been to another location before, this was not the first and it wont be the last.."
Jenn M.,"Pueblo, CO",36,131,24,5.0,4/12/2017,"Try the root beer.  It's really good.   I went in for lunch.  I was greeted by very friendly staff and seated immediately.  The service was quick and friendly.  The waitress was upbeat and made recommendations, without being pushy.  I ordered the root beer, so yummy.  I had the grilled ham and cheese sandwich.  I know, not the most exciting thing they serve, but very good.  And I don't even like sourdough bread, as a general rule.  But this was just drenched in melted cheese, with thick ham slices.  The fries were good.  Not spectacular, but better than average.  The waitress checked on us, without ever being intrusive.  I was on a first date that went well, so we were there for awhile.  But I never felt rushed.  I didn't get to dessert, as my sandwich was so good and filling.  But next time, I'm trying that cookie thing.  When I left, the staff smiled and said good-bye. The food was very good.  The service was above and beyond."
Alycia M.,"Aurora, CO",152,39,57,4.0,4/18/2017,We come here every once in a while because the food is really really good! The service has never been outstanding but isn't terrible. There are constantly people walking around so they can help with refills and such. The cookie pies are so delicious! It tends to be a bit pricey but I'm okay with that because I always have leftovers.
Lisa W.,"Aurora, CO",0,39,8,5.0,9/30/2017,"This restaurant is still a great place to eat.  Ordered a steak and it came out just as orderded, pink inside and it was a thick steak. mashed potatoes were stiff, not even butter did much good but the steak was more impprtant! good jog guys!"
Nina B.,"Mililani, HI",0,2,,5.0,9/16/2017,Had such an awesome experience this evening! The manager Elka Zlot and server Brittany S took amazing care of us! Thank you! We'll definitely be back!
Sarah F.,"Aurora, CO",0,3,,1.0,8/1/2017,"On 7/29, my husband and I went to dinner. I ordered the sirloin steak cooked well-done. When my steak arrived, it was (at best) cooked medium. My plate was covered in bloody juice. I brought this to the attention of my server. She agreed that it was not cooked per my order. She took my steak back from me on a separate plate. While I waited for my steak, I tried to eat my baked potato. My baked potato was still hard and also not cooked all the way through. Since my steak was already messed up, I didn't both with requesting a new potato. I waited about 15 to 20 more minutes to get my steak back. This time, it is burned. I accepted it and left it at that. When my server came back, she said that her manager wanted to send me out a fresh side of asparagus for my steak since the original steak was undercooked. That never came. The server asked me after when we were finishing up if I still wanted that asparagus since it still hadn't come out. We didn't bother getting it.  When I have had my food undercooked at other restaurants, the manager has always been the one to bring it back to me to confirm it being made correctly. I am disappointed that this BJs manager stayed in the back and let the server do all the work. I am also disappointed that the manager would offer a free side and then not follow through with making sure it was delivered. I do believe that after this failure occurred, the manager should have at the very least offered a free dessert or to discount our bill in some way. None of this happened.  I very much doubt I'll be coming back to this place any time soon. It was horrible cooking for a $50+ meal. Seriously floored that someone could manage to screw up making a baked potato of all things.  I do want to single out Shonte's (Shante?) service. She was great through the whole thing and very apologetic about the situation."
Steven C.,"Aurora, CO",1,2,2,5.0,9/9/2017,Great food and great service. We love this place. French fries have this light coating that makes them excellent. Ahi tuna salad is one of my favorites.
Bianca S.,"Aurora, CO",42,128,32,5.0,6/6/2016,"I seriously love this place. I come here sometimes twice a week!  My favorite things on the menu that they have definitely have to be the calamari, seared ahi salad, the crunchy fries, & their flat bread! Sooo freaking good. The seared ahi salad is huge and has just the right amount of wasabi and vinaigrette in it.  They also have a to-go type service, you can call them and place your order, they tell you how long, and then you can pull up on the side in the take out parking, call the number on their sign and they'll bring your food out to you. Which is super awesome since I usually come after the gym & do NOT feel like waking into a restaurant to get food.  They have this awesome seasonal peach beer and always have awesome seasonal brews. They're house beer is great too.  LOVE this place, it's HUGE so there is never a wait when needing to be seated.  Staff has always been efficient and friendly."
Kati E.,"Denver, CO",140,8,,5.0,9/4/2017,"My ""go to"" after work! Awesome beers and good food! The staff is also very personable! Love the pizza and Brussels!"
Anita R.,"Aurora, CO",81,32,6,5.0,7/4/2016,This is one of my go-to spots. The Kale and Brussel sprout salad with shrimp is quite good. I've also enjoyed the Mahi-Mahi with shrimp. The menu has a good mix of American fare as well as a large health conscious selection
Jess M.,"Aurora, CO",90,153,33,3.0,10/8/2015,"We live right down the street from BJ's so it has turned into a frequent stop for us. We have always sat in the bar area because that's where we're most comforrable. The bartenders have always been very attentive and friendly. They keep a good eye on our drink levels and are quick to talk up the any new beers. The beer selection is good and the seasonals are usually pretty decent. During our last visit we tried the fall seasonals, oktoberfest and the pumpkin. Both were good. The pumpkin was subtle which I liked...a lot. Some pumpkin beers smash you over the head with pumpkin spice. BJ's is noticeable and enjoyable but not in your face. While the beers are always good, the food can be a little hit or miss. Their thin crust pizza and stuffed mushrooms are good. I would steer clear of the sliders. The patty is teeny tiny, like smaller than white castle burgers tiny and they don't have much flavor. The one time we ordered cheese sticks, they weren't melty all the way through. Sad clown face. We ordered both of those food items on the same night so it could have just been an off night for the kitchen maybe?  I'm positive we'll continue to go to BJ's and work our way through the menu little by little. It's close to our house so it's convenient and we have always had great service and beers."
Chop H.,"Aurora, CO",0,7,,5.0,11/10/2017,"Every time we come here the food is spot on, service is very good to excellent, place is clean with a good energy!  Keep it up, Aurora doesnt have alot of top notch places to dine in and BJs hasnt failed yet."
Reese D.,"Denver, CO",301,216,414,4.0,8/26/2015,"We are moving out of Aurora, so I need to catch up on the reviews from this area. I've been to this BJ's probably a dozen times. I know it's a chain restaurant and many poopoo it, but it is seriously one of the only breweries in Aurora. Yes, it is a brewery. They brew on the premises and have a brewmaster. They have seasonal beers. They host beer-pairing events. They are also a restaurant and update their menu frequently. They have happy hour M-F both early and late night. I've never been disappointed in their pizza. Most of the food I've tried has been good to excellent. I've never had to send something back. Service has been from just okay to phenomenal. So, if I compile all of my reviews into just one star score, it is a 4. If it was less, I wouldn't have kept going back. They also have a rewards program and are constantly sending me freebies via email and their new app. I've never paid full price for a meal there, even if it is just a free Pizookie(tm). (It's a cookie pizza and they have killer flavors like Red Velvet, Salted Caramel, S'Mores, etc.) They once had a Bourbon Barrel Aged Stout that knocked my socks off. If they ever have it again, get it, lots of it. If not, get the Tatonka Stout. My personal fave. All of the other beers are well-crafted and you can't go wrong. So, if you are ever stuck in Aurora, this place is a very very safe bet."
Marie C.,"Glendale, AZ",0,8,,5.0,7/29/2017,Normally I refrain from chain restaurants. I was traveling with two others. After a long day of work and play we wanted to eat and go to bed. We were so hungry and of course all wanted something different. BJ's it was. It was quick to get to and had a variety of food. I was pleasantly surprised how the menu has changed with excellent vegetarian options past a traditional salad list. They even have small plate options that gave the feel of tapas eating style. Everything was delicious. Our waitress was fabulous! She had personality without losing her professionalism. I'd be happy to go back to that location.
Kathey H.,"Bend, OR",13,2,,2.0,6/22/2017,Six of us came into this restaurant about  5 pm on a Thursday when there were perhaps two or three other tables filled.  We were exhausted and thirsty after a long day in the mountains. We ordered water and drinks for 3 of our party first. It took an unusually long time for our waiter to bring them.    We then ordered dinner which was brought quickly enough by other staff. We needed a couple more plates and had to wait to flag down our waiter to bring them.    He never returned to refill our water glasses that sat there empty for most of the meal. We felt that this job might not be what he was cut out for. He was easily confused in taking both our dinner and dessert orders.  I really believe when eating out the experience should be about the food and the service. The food here was good but the service left a lot to be desired.
Lindsay M.,"Denver, CO",34,20,6,5.0,10/4/2016,"Love this place! Great variety, but my favorite is the potato skins appetizer. I just moved to Denver from Saint Louis, MO and my folks recently came into town for a visit. While here, we went to dinner twice at BJ's because they're just THAT good! The service is friendly and they brought me a Pizooki for my birthday without request!"
Ruhama G.,"San Francisco, CA",295,92,159,3.0,8/29/2016,"Oh BJs, I really want to love you, in fact I've come back time and time again after countless bad outings and you have yet to prove yourself to me. It seems to me that there is definitely some sort of disconnect in the kitchen because orders rarely seem to come out right. This particular visit I got stale fries, and a burnt burger that was in fact supposed to be cooked medium. As far as orders coming out incorrectly, this has been my experience every time I've come but the food DOES actually taste good (which is why I keep coming back).  On a BRIGHTER note, our server Eric was fantastic. He was friendly, prompt with our requests and handled our complaints graciously. It's rare that I feel the need to send back food, I usually just suck it up but this time I couldn't ignore the mistakes. The manager did offer us complimentary soup/salad/dessert etc. which we kindly declined--it was a nice gesture but we were just ready to leave at that point.  I'm still holding on to hope for a better experience at BJ's, it has all the makings and potential for a great restaurant -- maybe my run of bad luck with them will end soon.  Xo."
Bria M.,"Denver, CO",71,9,11,4.0,12/8/2016,"Awesome place for casual dining. Our server was pleasant and attentive. The food tasted fresh and delicious, overall really pleased with our experience here. We had the Honey Sriracha Brussels, Seared Ahi Tuna salad and the Kale and Brussels Salad with Oven Roasted Salmon."
Angela K.,"Aurora, CO",202,10,,2.0,7/13/2017,"So within a week I had BJ's twice. Once DoorDash delivered it. The food itself was good. But so much was forgotten. This was not a DoorDash issue but BJ's forgetting these items. My boys meals were not complete. DoorDash did rectify the problem. Then a few days later we went to BJ's with my dad who was visiting from out of town. It was strangely busy for a Wednesday night. However, we were seated at a table that still had drinks, napkins and check on it. My dads tacos were wrong and I was missing lemon in my water (small error). The food again was good, but I am becoming more and more unimpressed with service and accountability. With my dads tacos they did correct it before he asked, which was awesome, but all these errors in such short time for parties that are not big is turning me off from wanting to eat there physically or takeout."
Karmen K.,"Aurora, CO",0,11,7,2.0,2/21/2016,"I got sick once when I ate here. Even so, My brother wanted to come here for his birthday. Mom ordered online. It lost half the order and screwed up what it kept, first of all, and second, there's still a wait, so don't bother with it. Online or in the restaurant, you're still in for a wait. The ciders weren't cold enough and tasted like cough syrup. The girl who sat us didn't seem to get that we already ordered. She tried to get us to order more.  The food: I got the Margherita flatbread. Here's how it looked online and IRL. I could only taste cheese. I figured try the kale and brussel sprouts salad. It was good. That and the staff's willingness to bend over backwards is its saving grace. I did try a bit of brother's birthday pizookie. It was great. At least they used good ice cream."
Corinne H.,"Aurora, CO",204,170,914,3.0,2/26/2016,"Pretty much what I come to expect from chain restaurant food. OK service a bit inattentive and on the slow side for the amount of customers they had. There is literally a 16 page menu...16 pages can be a bit overwhelming but I guess there is something for everyone with that many choices.  I had the jambalaya and hubs had fish and chips. He enjoyed it, said it was slightly bland but was good after the addition of the malt vinegar. The jambalaya was okish and recommended by the waiter.  Decent flavor, seemed like minute rice, and the veggies in it were way undercooked. We also had a pizookie but it was doughy and also seemed undercooked. This won't be my first choice ever but nothing to bad to keep me from coming back."
Jeff S.,"Aurora, CO",289,627,21,4.0,2/2/2016,"I've no idea how a review of BJ's has eluded my list for so long.  If Old Chicago's and Rock Bottom had a child, it would be this.  And I'd totally be willing to babysit. I've been here a couple times in the past, but in the last year Jess M. and I have been coming here quite often as it's just down the road from us.  It's a place we come for a quick impromptu date night.  They have great beers, the wine list isn't too bad either, and they do have some good signature cocktails. We've sampled much from the menu, pizza is tasty, and most of the appetizers are good.  The only thing that I would recommend avoiding is the sliders, as the meat is the same size as the pickle on it.  Other than that I love everything I've tried here.  And I would be remiss if I neglected to make special mention of the pizza cookies (which apparently are bad for my heart and that brings up a source of contention between me and my bride to be which will not affect your review at all provided of course that you make it a point to sneak me a salted caramel as often as possible when she goes to the ladies room but I digress). Service is always great.  We always sit at the bar and they have consistently impressed us.  And the ladies at the host stand are always smiling and welcoming.  Jeremiah Red and Tatonka Stout are my favorite of their own beers, but they also offer outside drafts as well. I really like being close to BJ's, and I've no doubt that I will continue to lend my patronage. Cheers!!"
