Jeff R.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,3,,5.0,6/12/2014,This was my first visit and I was blown away! They have a huge menu so all my buddies could find something to eat.  Lindsay our server was attentive and educated on the 16 page menu. Try the Nutty Brunette. The managers were out talking to people and making us feel welcome. Even after along day of construction.
Missy M.,"Westminster, CO",41,27,,2.0,4/18/2014,"we come here for happy hour sometimes, they have a good menu, but the service is pretty mediocre. Last time several people's orders were wrong and they didn't do anything to correct it. The food is ok, nothing special."
Marshall C.,"Newman, CA",0,42,14,4.0,1/24/2014,"Haven't been to BJs in a few years.  First time at this one, and I'd go back. Amanda was our attentive server.  The lunch specials are a great deal for decent food.  I really enjoyed their brews too."
Frederick S.,"Denver, CO",1,19,,4.0,10/17/2010,"Beer and good food. What could be better, right? BJ's Brewhouse features their own brews on tap, much like many other brew pubs. What makes them different is that they feature many other beers from around the world...which I think makes them unique. You want a Belgian? No problem. English Stout? Yep. Plus their own brews are darned good too. The menu here is extensive. Apps are interesting and different...like the avocado egg rolls. Really unique and really good. Pizzas are really loaded. Burgers are good. Been here many times, never leave hungry...always leave happy."
Michael W.,"Aurora, CO",66,238,18,2.0,9/12/2010,"Won't be going here again. Only upside on this visit was the beer.  I was there with a going away party and another large gathering totally took over the entire area. No one told them to quiet down or stay within there seats, it was annoying.  Then when I needed to jet to pick up my daughter the bartender was a total a-hole about helping me close out my one beer bill.  This confirms my long held belief that jerks are hired here often. If they treat there customers like that, I wonder how they really treat your food."
Brandon J.,"Cherry Hills Village, CO",0,37,1,4.0,4/5/2014,"The food is delicious. a semi boogie kind of restaurant - the food is rather expensive. The wait staff is not fantastic and is often rude. However, the best part of this restaurant is the pizookie. Save room for this fantastic dessert....it is an incredible cookie, baked to perfection and topped with delicious ice cream."
J V.,"Orange, CA",56,23,9,1.0,1/15/2015,Visited this BJ's while in Colorado for business with my son. Staff at the reception area were polite but more interested in talking to each other than greeting customers. Server seemed hurried and unfriendly. Steak was a high quality piece of beef ruined by the chef who must never taste anything he/she cooks--extremely salty as was the asparagus. My son's fish and chips was delivered to the table minus chips. Had to remind the server the meal was incomplete. The fish was over cooked rendering it tasteless. Not worth $48.
Sean DeMarco G.,"Aurora, CO",58,21,13,3.0,12/22/2012,"Not a bad place. Their menu is waaay too big. When you eat at a restaurant you generally want to order what they're known for. (In this case, beer & pizza). any place that shows they make everything means they don't specialize in one great dish. Just a bunch of average stuff. My advice? Cut the 6-7 page menu and concentrate on what you do best. (again, beer & pizza)."
Fred D.,"Aurora, CO",0,23,,5.0,9/16/2014,We just ate there and the food was perfect as always. Shaina is really fun to watch because she gets every drink in the place and still serves food to the people at the bar and makes it look easy. She is always very sweet to my wife and I. This place has moved up to be one of  my favorites.
Janet S.,"Denver, CO",2,8,,5.0,3/23/2014,"Pizza was amazing! We had a pepperoni and pineapple deep dish! After an Oreo cookie w ice cream! I think what made it even better was out service! Jerome was so nice, attentive and personable! It was A+ service with wonderful food! I wish every dining experience was like this!"
Keith B.,"Littleton, CO",0,6,,1.0,3/18/2013,"Wow....what a horrible evening!!!  We arrived and were seated promptly and that's the only good thing I can say about BJ's.   After we were seated we were given menus and the waitress told us she'd be right back.  20 minutes later she came back and took our drink order and another 20 minutes after that the drinks finally arrived.  I should mention that we asked for water when we were first seated and that never got to the table.  Anyway, we finally flagged done our waitress and told her we wanted to order some food and she told me that we would have to wait a couple minutes for her to return.  After 25 minutes she finally showed back up but at that point I was so pissed we decided to leave.  Maybe a good place with a different server but I won't be going back to find out."
Jeff K.,"Saddle River, NJ",323,302,33,4.0,7/30/2010,"I had very good experience with the BJ's Brewhouse in Cerritos, CA. I was pleasantly surprised to find one in the denver area.  The brewhouse wasn't special, but it didn't disappoint either. The food was good. I had the miso salmon this time, and it was done just right. The beer was also very nice. Instead of the red, I stuck to the stout this time.  I am still hoping that we get a brew pub of this caliber or better in our area. Is that really too much to ask?"
Shannon S.,"Denver, CO",0,17,,2.0,1/19/2014,"The drinks were excellent. The beer and mojitos were awesome. Otherwise they would have gotten 1 star. Service was poor. The waiter messed up my order twice. And after I gave up and just ate what I got, it wasn't very good. There were 2 of us and he gave my drink and my food to my friend and visa versa. Not hard to give the right stuff to the guest when there are only 2 people. We had to flag him down to ask for stuff. He was friendly enough at least. I've eaten at other the Westminster location and that was significantly better."
Dwayne F.,"Littleton, CO",0,5,1,1.0,1/10/2015,"Ridiculously poor service tonight.  The server's face said, ""I don't want to be here or serve you"". 15 minutes for her to get to the table. And I had to ask for her....15 more to get a drink. ..side salad completely forgotten. Had the nerve to ask if I still wanted it....never again."
Doctor G.,"Alameda County, CA",0,1740,1,3.0,9/14/2011,"This BJ's looks almost identical to the BJ's I ate at about 1000 miles away.  A sports bar concept here.  Food was decent, and the service was very good.  No complaints here.   It's a bit pricey, but food quality is consistent."
Jaxon K.,"Englewood, CO",1,48,,2.0,1/28/2013,"Like the room and location. But the meals have always failed me.  I have gotten pizza and a burger here. They were both very average.  I will stick with the apps and the beer next time.  They have been decent.  I also had a root beer there that was pretty not good.  But I may have been expecting more from a brewhouse.  Shame on me, maybe."
Leonard E.,"Mobile, AL",26,116,,3.0,5/19/2013,"Great place/environment and friendly staff.  Great micro beer selection and taste.  I had the blond.  I had the bacon cheeseburger to eat.  It wasn't the best burger I've ever had, but the taste was acceptable and I didn't feel to guilty after eating it.  It wasn't greasy at all.  The fries are good.  It's a great place to hang out."
Aja T.,"Denver, CO",3,8,1,3.0,7/26/2013,"The clam chowder and fried artichokes are my go to when I eat here. I've tried a few other things (santa fe rolls, pizza, salad) but they aren't as good as my faves. With that said its worth a visit especially during the lunch hours."
Sarah S.,"Aurora, CO",32,11,2,2.0,11/10/2014,"I have come twice for the unlimited soup and salad lunch special. The salad is good.  The soups are also good with a decent selection.  Service was extremely slow both times.  I believe""unlimited refills"" depends on how many times you're willing to wait 25-30 minutes for your server to return.  Overall,  the food was a good value but I may reconsider returning unless I have a long time for lunch."
Beth F.,"Boulder, CO",63,117,20,1.0,5/31/2012,We sat at a table for 15 min with no server and no water. We ended up leaving. Totally ridiculous.
