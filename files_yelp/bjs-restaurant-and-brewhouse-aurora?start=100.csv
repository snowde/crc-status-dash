Brian A.,"Aurora, CO",1,23,,3.0,5/11/2016,Not a bad spot to grab a drink and the service is pretty good but dips when it gets busy. The poke salad is one of my favorites but it seems like the bigger dinner plates are not that good. I would recommend lunch or after work drinks and apps. The Beer is really good and huge selection. I think the food is not consistent because the menu is so large but you have plenty of options to choose from. I am usually not that pleased when I order anything other than my favorites. They have really good hours and are open pretty late
Nick A.,"Los Angeles, CA",541,522,2033,4.0,11/8/2013,"Went back there again after poor service and a 2 star rating the first time I went there. MUCH improved from last time!  They have really good lunch specials. Pizza and salad for $5. I had a burger and fries for under $7. It was plenty of food. They can get busy, but you can call them and be put on the waiting list so your wait will be minimal. By far the best part of the experience was Nikki, the server. Personality plus, along with excellent service. BJ's should be super proud to have her on their team! 10 stars for Nikki!"
Robert R.,"Colorado Springs, CO",65,606,38,4.0,2/24/2014,"We always get great service at this location as we usually have a large group and sometimes that is dicey.   Just apps and drinks this last visit.  We failed to call ahead (we had a group of 10), but they quickly put together a table for us.   Drinks were quickly delivered and the apps followed.  We got the sampler plate.  Really not my thing, as there wasn't much on there that I liked, but  that's me. We will be back.  easy, convenient, consistent."
Michael J.,"Aurora, CO",252,35,13,4.0,3/8/2015,"We went there today for Dylan 5th birthday celebration after a crazy time at the jumpalene place. It was a good experiance. My 3rd time to this chain. Once in Long Beach Ca. And the other time here. The waitstaff was very good.  We started off with calamari  appetizers.  I thought it was very good. Very light not greasy. The had a blond beer that was very good there and thoroughly enjoyed.i had the chicken that was crusted with parmigiano cheese, mash potatoes and my favorite broccoli. Some fold had burgers but all were satisfied. Dylan loved the bottomless chocolate milk. For desert the have those fresh baked cookies with ice cream. Dylan was free but he never touched it! Over all a very good experiance. I recommend it."
Ryan T.,"Denver, CO",1,15,5,2.0,5/2/2015,"Excellent food,  great atmosphere. Terrible service. We came for lunch. Food was cold. We had to wait for fries. Being the bill took 15 minutes.  If you are very patient this is the radiant for you."
David R.,"Denver, CO",0,3,,5.0,4/11/2016,Incredible food great beer excellent service not the kind of place I expected to find here this area is obviously up and coming
Ron D.,"Aurora, CO",0,39,,1.0,1/4/2016,Every time I have went there the service has stunk. Slow waitstaff that left me sitting with no food for over an hour (including an elderly couple). I will not return ever.
Sara R.,"Denver, CO",9,51,69,4.0,1/30/2016,"I think this place deserves more than the 3 stars given by other reviewers because it is one place in Aurora that you can get a little vibe going. If you want beers and TV's they have a really nice set-up. Great for football games because, in the bar, I can see all the TV's and the tables aren't crammed together. If you want a cozy booth for a romantic date, they have that too. The dining room can also accommodate very large groups so it would be good for holidays or office lunches. The dining room reminds me a little of Maggianos where it is open and decorated to the hilt. The beer list is very, very good. I am a picky beer drinker and I found at least three good beers: the brew house blonde, the Tatonka Porter and the Jeremiah Red, all native to BJ's. They have a bunch of common domestics like Blue Moon and Kona Brewery. Tons of IPA's. The food was better than decent. I don't like deep dish pizza but theirs is light and fluffy!!! (Not sure how you do that unless there is egg in the dough?!? Seriously it was that fluffy.) The deep dish Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza was yummy. I had the avocado egg rolls as a meal and, with the sauce, it was a solid 6. I say give it a shot. Your other choices on this street are chili's and TGI Fridays and this is way, way, way better than that."
Melissa C.,"Aurora, CO",4,52,23,5.0,3/22/2015,I love this place!  It's close to home and is always a great dinner hot spot.   The hostesses are always friendly and the beer is great.  The main reason why I keep coming back are because of the avocado egg rolls. They are to die for. I always get them as my meal with a salad. As long as they have those in the menu I'm in!
Stephanie B.,"Aurora, CO",48,8,4,2.0,11/29/2015,"We have dined here with the entire family many times (3 kids and ourselves). The food is usually really good.  The service is hit or miss.  Yesterday we had a late lunch and ordered 2 appetizers and a pizza.  We asked them to substitute mushrooms in place of tomatoes.  And also the the chicken wing be extra crispy.  The chicken wings were good, bit the skin was rubbery, then the pizza didn't have mushrooms and they put them on and put it back thru the oven which made the normal yummy buttery crust hard like  a petrified tree in the forest.  My other pet peeve with this place is that when you have 5 people sitting at a table meant for 4 with out grabby kiddos, I would really love that you take away as much as you can of used dishes, not set down main course and walk away while leaving a stacked (by me) pile of dishes.  We are tight on space to start with!!!!! Oh and for the lady sitting next to us....DONT EVER EVER AGAIN ORDER STINKY FRIED FISH.....you stunk up the entire restaurant with that crap!"
Heather T.,"Denver, CO",335,803,984,3.0,11/18/2013,"I'm just not a fan of brew pubs in general. I find them to have standard fare without much originality.  BJ's has done a better job than most of mixing things up a bit.  We came here for a business lunch and realized too late there is no wifi. Boo to that but understandable.  Our service was pleasant but scattered.  We ordered the fried artichoke heart appetizer which was good and had exactly the flavor profile one would expect. For my main I ordered the garden burger with a side salad. The salad was sad. Iceberg lettuce with croutons, sliced cucumber and tomato. The lettuce was drowning in dressing - do I eat or resuscitate? The veggie burger was a standard garden burger. I has asked for it plain and that's what I got and it tasted exactly like I thought it would. It filled me up but didn't rock my taste buds."
Cat S.,"Aurora, CO",251,381,304,4.0,5/24/2011,"When we stepped into BJ's, I was wary - thinking it kind of reminded me of a large Cheesecake Factory.  BJ's definitely surpassed this and was a pleasant surprise. We started out with the fried artichokes appetizer and some beer: I had the Berry Citrus beer.. that tasted like carbonated fruit juice and I loved it. The boyfriend had the Irish Root Beer - a concoction of root beer with liquor. Delicious. As for the food, everything that we ordered was very good! I had the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps which were fresh tasting and the well balanced between sweet and spicy. The boyfriend got fish and chips and the I loved the wedge fries and the beer battered fish. Friends got stuffed mushrooms, mozerella sticks and the veggie burger. All very satisfying. I wish I could say we had room for dessert, but unfortunately, we were all stuffed, which tells you how big the portions are (most of us got appetizers!)."
M K.,"Chandler, AZ",1,26,,4.0,8/27/2015,"I will give you the best advice ever if you want to try this place. Avoid Friday and Saturday nights. Everything else was great. Good food. Not a huge fan of the 'appetizer's. Good burgers, GREAT ribs, good sauce."
Nathan S.,"Belleville, IL",1,3,,3.0,9/7/2014,"Great food and unbelievable black Cherry soda, but wait.  This location is one of 3 stores that do not have the black cherry soda.  What a disappointment.  I am traveling out of town and was so looking for to a great black cherry soda as we do not have BJ's in St. Louis. Almost got up and walked out when I heard the bad news. At least they do have the under cooked cookie for desert."
Lori P.,"Aurora, CO",48,207,720,4.0,1/1/2013,"We normally rely on yelp for our eats and try to stay away from chain restaurants. I can be picky with my pizza and BJ's happens to serve my very favorite pan pizza in the state of Colorado.  The portions are large, atmosphere is fun and the drinks good. We'll continue to come back !"
Roger G.,"Aurora, CO",133,211,65,4.0,8/13/2013,This place is a good place to get a chicken fried steak for dinner.  They do pizza and a hundred other things (reminded me of the cheesecake factory).  Anyone can find something to eat on this menu.   We had the chicken lettuce wraps which we thought were tasty.  I recommend the watermelon salad. They have their own root beer and cream sodas which is a big plus for me and gives them an extra star.  Service is attentive and good.
Tsvetanka T.,"Aurora, CO",33,1,,4.0,3/2/2016,Really like the food. Our server Sierra was amazing.The only think we didn't like was the hostess Narda really extremely rude and her attitude was horible.
Broderick G. D.,"Aurora, CO",0,12,1,4.0,2/18/2015,"It was my 1st time here , my wife and i started off with the avocado egg rolls and they were very good. I had a strawberry lemonade  ( made just right ) along with the jambalaya,  I've never had it served on rice pilaf before but it was good also. The service was great and the atmosphere was very nice also , i think we'll take out of town guest there whenever they visit."
Julie J.,"Denver, CO",46,21,8,4.0,12/1/2014,"Nice atmosphere, good lunch menu with very reasonable prices!  Service was good, not to noisy for a large restaurant.  We will definitely be back for lunch and dinner as well."
Kyle H.,"Aurora, CO",48,4,1,4.0,12/30/2015,"Good beer, good food.  Our server was a little absent at times, but we had a great time.  We'll still come back"
