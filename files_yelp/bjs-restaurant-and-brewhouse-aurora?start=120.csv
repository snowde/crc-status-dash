Brittany C.,"Denver, CO",0,6,1,1.0,12/29/2015,"Where to start... first off we got sat by a noisy party. In a timly manner a server came and introduced herself. We had asked to move to the opposite side of the wall because how loud and crowded it was with the large party. She gave a dirty look and said well it won't be the same server and just walked away. So we move... and wait... no one came over. The same server walked by multiple times. Finally, what looked to be a manager whom never introduced himself asked if we needed drinks. We got drinks and then he took our order. A random person asked if we needed plates, another person brought our food, no one came by to get us refills, I got up and went to the bar, even though a bunch of servers walked by our unrefilled drinks. All in all the food was good but the service was so disappointing. The ticket says our server was Laura but from our experience we didn't even have a server."
Sunday W.,"Denver, CO",276,331,317,3.0,9/7/2014,"Ordered Take out! I order the same thing every time I order from BJ's. Cheeseburger and fries.  2 reasons for the 3, instead of 5 stars.  The cookie we ordered was very, very thin. I don't like thin, barely cooked chocolate chip cookies. I was expecting way too much and got way too little.  Second thing. The kids menu pizza. On the pic, it looked like a yummy deep dish personal pan pizza. Although tasty...looked nothing like the picture. My daughter, who is not too hard to please, was obviously disappointed. Burger was good and they gave me more than enough fries."
Brian M.,"Aurora, CO",15,2,,3.0,1/24/2016,Food was great but the server(Travis P.)was terrible. There were 3 tables in his section (including mine) and he was more interested in helping his friends and watching football.
Eric B.,"Aurora, CO",0,6,,3.0,7/25/2016,"I enjoyed their version of a caprese salad and was looking for the recipe when the main course Ribeye arrived. As an avid meat eater, I was very disappointed. How can you screw up a med - rare ribeye? This seemed like it started with a tender cut and yet it was flavorless. Their double secret spice rub is aptly named, please don't share this flavorless rub with anyone else. The most flavor came from the slight charring. The brussel sprouts were also unimpressive."
David P.,"Denver, CO",17,14,8,3.0,7/4/2014,The atmosphere was okay. The waitstaff  kind of all hung out at the reception desk though. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and it was kind of bland. There was next to no seasoning and it was was extremely greasy. I probably wouldn't return again.
Kara C.,"Huntingdon Valley, PA",0,14,14,4.0,10/21/2015,"This place is great. First of all, I love the giant dining room with all the decor and high ceilings. As far as an atmosphere goes, this place is awesome.  The food is incredible, too. We've been here twice now in the month that we've lived in Aurora and this place has come through as a solid dinner choice both times. My boyfriend and i were throughly satisfied with our meals, and I was impressed with the beer selection and the elaborate menu they were displayed on, with a guide to help you pair your meal and beer together perfectly.  Our servers both times were very friendly and informative. The only slight complaint I had was that it seemed a little under staffed. The first time we went in was on a Tuesday, so it wasn't that busy and I felt like the service was a little slower than it should have been.  All in all I would highly recommend this place to any friend if they are looking for a nice big brewery to go to with great food and drink choices."
Alycia M.,"Aurora, CO",102,17,,4.0,12/13/2015,We come here every once in a while because the food is really really good! The service has never been outstanding but isn't terrible. There are constantly people walking around so they can help with refills and such. The cookie pies are so delicious!
Mardell M.,"Cottage Grove, OR",137,16,4,1.0,5/22/2016,"Visited this place on a non-busy, Thursday night around 7:30. We were seated at a table in the bar. There was one large crowd, about 8 people at the table next to us that was just finishing up.  1/2 the other empty tables around us had not been cleared from the previous patrons. We sat for over 15 min before being acknowledged by any staff members.  We ordered beers and the avacado egg rolls right away, and waited another 15 min. I could see our waitress talking to another guest as our beers sat at the servicing area getting warm.  Another server delivered them to us and said "" it looks like she is busy talking to another customer and it really sucks when you can't get away. Is there anything else I can bring you?"". We asked for waters...  our beers were about half gone when server 2 delivered our appetizers and waters.  Our original server was still talking to the same customer. The food was mediocre at best."
Mike R.,"Somerville, NJ",24,225,352,4.0,8/23/2012,"Every time I'm in town to visit family, we end up here. On a recent trip, we ended up here twice in two weeks. I love the interior (and usually that stuff does little for me) and ambiance. The beer selection is good and well-presented. Not cheap, but not exorbitant.  The menu is similar to TGI Friday's and other pub chains: pizza, burgers, sandwiches, ribs, etc., but it's not generic.  No one thing stands out, but the overall package makes for a pleasant experience. Tell them DRAGON sent you and they won't charge you extra."
Rick G.,"Aurora, CO",7,2,,2.0,6/29/2015,Service was slow and took a long time to get our food.  Our waitress had no personality.  Probably will not be coming back here again
Ash A.,"Aurora, CO",1,17,,5.0,12/27/2014,"I am slightly biased because my little sister works here, but I am always impressed by this place and have been coming long before she began serving here.  The staff at the front is always friendly and helpful, and constantly keeping busy. My sister is of course phenomenal but when she has not been there I have received amazing service from everyone else as well. The food is delicious, and I like that they have different things to try. And of course, the beer is always amazing."
Jeff B.,"Englewood, CO",65,335,429,3.0,6/15/2014,Ice been to BJs Brewhouse 2x before writing this review.  I would describe it as cheesecake factory meets microbrew meets Pizza place.  It's good to take the kids and family to a nice dinner.  Or do happy hour with friends.  I've always had good and friendly service.  the food comes up in relatively good time.   They have a nice drink selection.   I'm impressed they have a gf menu.  For the money I just don't see anything compelling to brag about.  They're consistent and good.  3 star bordering 4
Mike Z.,"Mesa, AZ",0,6,,4.0,11/25/2015,Came here a few days back and got a deep dish pizza! Outstanding!! Food has always been great at BJ's!
Jenyfer K.,"Aurora, CO",2,107,2,3.0,8/1/2015,Our favorite place for dinner. Everything we have tried is awesome.  Love the unique beers. The waiters however have a lot to be desired. Forgetting my drink then our appetizers. Can really ruin the experience
Dave S.,"Aurora, CO",7,46,,2.0,5/28/2016,"Nice decor but lousy food.  Ordered a club sandwich and a blue cheese burger.  The burger was supposed to be medium and I got well well done not a drop of juice tough burger with raw bacon, blue cheese and none of the chipotle sauce.  The club had 2 slabs of thick chicken, raw bacon, I mean not even warm, greasy bread and avocado..  We asked that the bacon be re-cooked and it came back uncooked slimy and warm, it took a 3rd time to come out just a little crispy. The waiter was very nice about it but the kitchen was not there.  I have had better burgers at good times.  Go for the beer but forget the menu."
Maria B.,"Denver, CO",50,332,116,4.0,7/31/2012,"Avocado rolls - fantastic!!!  I don't know what's in that dipping sauce, but it's a heavenly combination.   I am not a fan of chain restaurant; this establishment will have to be an exception to my rule."
Theodore S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",41,255,88,4.0,5/8/2015,"I like BJ's pizza. They have a good selection of beers to choose from and a great menu for food. The Avocado Egg Rolls are by far the best appetizer they have. I wish they would add the Spinach & Artichoke pizza back to the menu, even though they make it for me anyways. Its their best pizza!"
Bill C.,"Goodyear, AZ",1,1,,1.0,8/12/2015,Spent over 2 hours for a half cooked meal. Service from kitchen terrible at best. Atmosphere only good thing!
Jay A.,"Denver, CO",101,128,272,1.0,4/19/2015,"Aurora, Colorado- The menu is huge- 16 pages. Would you believe there is not a single vegan option? I can't believe it. Since everything is pre-made except a salad, I guess I'll go that route hold the meat and cheese. Again. Ugh. Why is this so difficult for the restaurant industry?"
Vicky L.,"Golden, CO",90,25,,1.0,9/10/2013,"Why this place has any good reviews is beyond me. I have many friends in the food industry and chain restaurants like these have there cooks come early in the morning and cook all the food which most comes from bags and then it sits in a hot drawer tell served.  Many don't know this but it grosses me out and really all this place is, is sit down fast food with alcohol. Yuck"
