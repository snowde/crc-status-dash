Big M.,"Fenton, MO",0,7,1,4.0,6/29/2015,"They have a good deep dish pizza. The peanut butter, chocolate and ice cream dessert is on point as well!"
Sic S.,"Aurora, CO",1,24,6,2.0,8/12/2015,This is the place for the yuppie beers with co workers grab a burger place.. The burgers here are pretty good.. The steak was horrible..  Obviously frozen and thawed in hot water. The waitress Nikki was amazing and kept apologizing for the food but she was running her tail off. For a group of 4 dudes pounding drinks that's saying something
Max C.,"Littleton, CO",8,263,304,4.0,2/14/2012,"I've not had any real food at the restaurant but the beers at the brewhouse are really nice.  The bartender, Tamara, was very helpful, friendly and allowed a tasting of all taps that interested me before committing to one.  I did also try the ahi tuna small plate ($3.95) and it was pretty nice with the best hottest wasabi i've ever had! :D I'll have to come back to try the food sometime. Tip: BJ's Jeremiah Red is yummy!"
Marcia N.,"Denver, CO",0,21,,4.0,4/14/2016,"Good food, always hot and flavorful.  My friends love the burgers at BJ's.  I typically go there at lunchtime and never have to wait.  It's near the Army base, so lots of military women and men frequent the place, and all customers are typically treated with respect.  Sean is a great waiter; the 2nd time I went there he remembered my name from my credit card receipt!"
Coco B.,"Denver, CO",106,224,45,1.0,1/23/2014,"eh...... if you want under seasoned, and average food for a ridiculous price just stick to olive garden!!!! we ordered parmesan crusted chicken with mash, thai shrimp lettuce wraps, chicken club sandwich and the sampler. needed salt and just flavor in general. what a disapointment"
Katie F.,"Denver, CO",1007,856,646,4.0,11/7/2011,"After a long week at work, I met up with Brittany H for some much needed cocktails and catching up! I arrived still in time for happy hour and  thankfully Brittany had snagged us a nice booth in the bar area.  This place is HUGE, full of a million beers and has some of the best food there is. We ordered a few appetizers [tuna, eggrolls and chips and salsa!] and were pleased with everything we sampled. Brit raved about their pumpkin beer, which was in fact quite good! I settled on a mojito [strawberry!], which tasted great! The $1 off for happy hour [cocktails and beer!] made it taste even better. Here is the overall breakdown: The Staff- Super awesome, friendly and accomodating. We stayed in our booth long past happy hour, but did not feel the rush to turn over the table. Our waitress continued to fill our waters, grab new beverages and would check back frequently with us...yay! The atmosphere- Cozy and fun. Depsite it being cold outside, the warm colored walls, big fireplace, and dimmed lighting made for a nice & cozy evening with friends. The food- awesome! everything we sampled, we enjoyed! The prices- a little high, but worth a try...for sure. i even made a rhyme! happy hour is your best bet for cheaper food & drinks. Return?-absolutely :)"
Deb S.,"Keenesburg, CO",33,47,5,4.0,2/7/2015,Fun place. Great selection of food. Wait Staff was very good. First time we had been there can't wait to go back to sit on the patio this summer. Prices were reasonable
Mary Jo S.,"Denver, CO",321,560,233,4.0,12/10/2011,"BJ's in Aurora did not seem like my type of hangout because it is deep in Aurora (too far from home), it is kind of a sports bar, and I was not crazy about the name. However, the husband's friends invited me to join them for cocktails along with the husband and I wanted to catch up.  I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised with BJ's whole nine yards. From my pumpkin ale, the apple cider, and the ahi poke to the dark wood walls and inviting atmosphere, BJ's sets a gold standard. In fact, BJ's mission statement has to do with the Gold Standard of Operational Excellence and they are not blowing smoke. The staff was very attentive, knowledgeable, and fun.   To wind up, let's revisit the ahi poke. This dish was wonderfully prepared and was almost identical to one of my favorite uptown restaurants except at half the price; I would return just for that dish with a handcrafted brew."
Jennifer M.,"Aurora, CO",0,6,,1.0,3/26/2016,"Have been here a couple of times for happy hour. Will definitely not be returning. They don't really have HH specials (almost $7 for a well drink?!?), and the staff act completely put out to be serving you. Every time I've been to this BJ's I've been treated incredibly rudely, to the point that some of the wait staff huddled together, pointed toward our table, then mysteriously kept bumping into us as they walked by. Obviously they don't want our business. No problem. There are better places to go, with actual HH specials, and staff who smile!"
Hilary T.,"Aurora, CO",34,31,3,1.0,10/20/2014,"Unfortunately today was a very disappointing visit. It started out that my husband, who is an AGM at a local 4 star restaurant, my daughter, and myself came in for lunch. We walked in and were eventually greeted by a cranky hostess, when she tried to seat us at a table I apologized for not specifying early but we needed a booth for our young child who does not yet sit well in seats. She was very unaccomodating and was very short about seating us elsewhere. We then ordered our daughters food and drink and our drinks. Our daughter fries and drink did not come, only her entree came. When our sever came back we ordered our appetizers and asked for the rest of what our daughter ordered. She brought back our daughters drinks and our drinks and took our order. After waiting and waiting our food came out. Never our appetizers and the food was brought incorrect. At this point we had been there almost an hour, and nothing had gone well, we hadn't even had a bite to eat. We were both so appalled by the overall worst experience we have ever had and were beyond frustrated we sought out the manager who was eating at a table in the back. My husband tried to explain our frustration, the manager never even put his fork down or attempted to solve anything. We left. Our server decided to come running out of the restaurant  and confront us, which is a huge violation. Overall this was the worst experience we have ever had. I wanted to write you so hopefully you can prevent anyone else experiencing such a terrible experience. We will never be visiting this establishment again. Period."
Caleb S.,"Denver, CO",1,30,,2.0,3/8/2015,Server checked on us twice the entire meal. Burger was dry. Very few fries to go with the dry burger. Not a good experience.
Allison A.,"Denver, CO",8,118,17,5.0,2/8/2015,"This is a nicer upscale establishment the area needs to have. The food is delicious, a huge selection."
Joe J.,"Denver, CO",68,474,93,4.0,5/13/2013,"We've actually eaten here twice in the last month and I'm just now getting around to reviewing it.  Clearly, if we're stopped in twice, its a good thing!   On our first trip in, I had a BBQ chicken salad.  This is what I call a salad.  Wow, stellar flavors, well presented, and very good size.  I can't remember the exact name of the beer I had, but it was a lager (which I prefer) and it scored high marks in my book.  On the second trip I had some ribs, which I enjoyed, but probably wouldn't order again.  They were a solid 3.5-4 star meal, but if I had to pick between the salad or the ribs, the salad would probably win out.  Again, same beer, still can't remember the name.  We had potstickers as an appetizer.  They were good, but not what I would normally order.  I don't think there was a thing wrong with them, but just not what I preferred. Overall though, the price is fair, the food is good, the beer is great, and the atmosphere and ambiance score very high in my book.  I'll definitely visit again."
Gayle C.,"Honolulu, HI",63,155,144,4.0,7/19/2014,"New summer cocktail is the Watermelon Mojito, that was delicious. The service was excellent.  Had a group of six with separate checks and the server was able not only to get the orders all sorted correctly but did it efficiently. No automatic gratuity added. Everyone only had praises for their entrees. An wide range of choices from pasta, pizzas,  seafood, sandwiches,  steaks, wide variety of salads."
Jennifer H.,"Aurora, CO",5,40,4,1.0,1/10/2015,Ahi poke appetizer was good. Hostess was short with us and rude. Server didn't check on us much. We both got steak which was a big mistake because we both ordered medium rare steaks and got well done. The sirloin was tough and the consistency was like hamburger meat. The ribeye also sucked and was gross. We waited to see if we could have the steaks sent back but she took so long that we just ate them since we were hungry. Definitely will not be going back.
Karen M.,"Aurora, CO",121,442,50,3.0,1/10/2013,"Stopped in to BJ's after a long day of moving.  Thank you for letting our scruffy looking selves in to the place!   It will be no surprise to any of you to know that what I like about BJ's is their great beer selection, whether it's their own brews or their vast choices from the cooler.  Second, I love their small plates - inexpensive and some nice choices. We tried the deep-fried artichoke hearts and the italian meatballs.  The artichokes were cooked perfectly; the meatballs were tender and very filling.  They have a huge menu, so if you are looking for a place that will satisfy lots of different tastes, this is a good bet for you."
Chanh S.,"Denver, CO",78,160,25,4.0,1/20/2013,"I think this is one of the nicest looking breweries/restaurants that I have ever been to.  It's a great place for a romantic date night or with a large group of friends.  The high ceilings make conversations great and it's not too loud in there.  It's not the best for watching a game unless you get a seat by a TV. The pizza was pretty awesome but it's still a far cry from real Chicago deep dish pizza.  The beer is pretty good too but I can't really judge it too much since I only had one pint.  However, I think I will be going back whenever I'm in the area. Service wasn't that great but I think it's just cuz our waitress sucks but the other staff around us seemed like they were doing a good job.  The prices are pretty reasonable too so stop in if you want a nicer than normal brewery with good food."
Monte W.,"Aurora, CO",10,6,2,5.0,7/25/2014,"This is my favorite restaurant of this kind. I have never had a bad meal and love the atmosphere. Pizzas, appetizers, entrees, you can't go wrong. I don't drink so I can't review the beers but they make custom root beer, cream soda, and orange cream. All really good but the root beer is my favorite. Go there and treat yourself. Wrap it up with a p,zookie. U won't regret it."
Shabana W.,"Denver, CO",87,100,7,3.0,1/30/2015,"Middle of the road food. Drinks over priced. Nothing memorable or notable about this place. Staff is ok.... What you'd expect for a chain restaurant. Gluten free options are ""ok"".... Last time I came in our server was very nice though."
Anthony K.,"Aurora, CO",0,4,,5.0,4/10/2015,The food and beer is great. The service was awesome. First time here and I am not disappointed. Thanks Shane for the excellent customer experience.
