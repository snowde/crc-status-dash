Natasha A.,"Aurora, CO",3,15,,3.0,12/4/2013,"This place has awesome brews and housemade sodas on tap.  The food ranges from pretty dang good to ""eh"" depending on what you order. The service is what really brings the rating down.  The majority of the time the service here sucks.  They are extremely slow at getting to you to take your drink order, bring your drink order, take dinner order, and getting the check to you.   They also aren't that great at checking up on you after they've delivered your meal. But sometimes late at night when we are craving appetizers and beer we make our way over here. It's worth it for a beer, apps, and a football game."
R S.,"Goodland, KS",0,48,34,5.0,2/15/2016,We met family for some drinks and apitizers. We had the pot stickers & lettuce wraps. They were both Amazing. Was very pleased with the waitress and staff. Busy place but they kept up. Good clean place to take your family. Kids are always welcome. They have a good kids menu.
S B.,"Denver, CO",2,53,,4.0,12/10/2012,"I love the beer, and the avocado rolls. I enjoy the ambiance. It's a tad expensive which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.  Not bad for a chain restaurant."
Danette D.,"Denver, CO",8,17,18,4.0,12/1/2014,"Went there this weekend for the first time. The food selection is great, they have a variety of food options from sandwiches, pizza, pasta, jambalaya etc. A great place to choose if you have a group that can't decide on  one thing. Boyfriend and I started off with the avocado eggrolls, then I had the brewhouse  burger for dinner and he had the jambalaya.  The avocado eggrolls were great, very flavorful and the sauce with it was tasty. My boyfriends jambalaya was the best, the amount of spices and seasonings they had on it was bomb, a MUST try! I was a bit dissapointed with the burger, for being one of their house specialties I expected more but it was about average. Will definitely  be coming back !"
Alexis G.,"Denver, CO",91,192,29,4.0,12/16/2012,"Notice:  BJ's will no longer offer half priced appetizers for Tuesday night happy hour.  We heard BJ's has a good happy hour (half priced apps), so my colleagues and I decided to drop by after work.  I had the fried calamari which was a little too spicy, but I had no problem cleaning my plate.  Our server informed us it was the last night BJ's would offer half priced appetizers for happy hour. From now on, they will offer a couple dollars off appetizers. Bummer."
Rob T.,"Morrison, CO",31,166,15,4.0,6/21/2013,"The food is good, the beer is good and they have a nice bar area and outdoor patio.  It's tough to give a chain 4 stars, but they do everything they advertise well so you can't really knock them. Nice TV collection in the bar area to watch the game and a nice outdoor patio to relax for lunch.  You could definitely do worse in this area than BJ's"
Matthew H.,"Denver, CO",3,76,1,2.0,12/16/2012,"Good location in Aurora, at least if you live in Aurora or east Denver. The staff has always been nice when I've gone and it draws a good crowd. The beers are good but nothing special, you know what you are getting, nothing bad but nothing that will bring you back.  Kind of like generic versions of what New Belgium offers. The food is disappointing and the portions are small for the price.  You would think that the appetizers (wings, chips and salsa, etc...) would be typical bar fare, but they try to put their own spin on bar appetizers and it just comes out... weird.  Bar appetizers need to be tasty, some-what filling and also need to soak up a little of the beer that one just had.  BJ's appetizers don't do any of that.  Lets face it, most people drive here and then will drive home.  I may want to go for that second beer, and I will want a little filling food to ""moderate"" it. I had dinner there once, but I can't remember anything from it.  I guess that's about it."
Kelly H.,"Aurora, CO",22,5,,1.0,5/2/2014,Went to have a late dinner the other night. The hours posted say they're open until 11pm. It was 9:45 and they were closed. What gives?
Shanah Z.,"Colorado Springs, CO",67,33,43,4.0,6/4/2011,"I've dined here a couple of times now. Both times we had a really nice servers. Although both times it took awhile to get our food. They were busy but not a line out the door busy. I wanted to eat here originally because I received an ad in the mail picturing their Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms. On our first visit we ordered them and they are delicious. I also thought they were priced reasonably.  Also on my first visit I ordered the Angel Hair Toscana for my entree. It is angel hair pasta tossed with olive oil, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, red peppers, fresh basil, feta cheese, pine nuts, tomatoes topped with fresh cheese and parsley. It was really delicious and it was great for left overs. We decided to share a Pizookie which is a giant cookie. They have a few different kinds but we went with good ol' chocolate chip. It was also really good. There's nothing like a giant, warm, gooey cookie with ice cream on top. Om nom nom. My second visit I ordered the Balsamic Glazed Chicken. Chicken breasts served over field greens, caramelized onions, white cheddar mashed potatoes, topped with fried onion strings and drizzled with balsamic glaze. The meal was delicious and I loved the onion strings and the balsamic glaze. I will definitely eat here again. Their menu is huge and they have more dishes I would like to try."
Kris R.,"Denver, CO",55,17,,5.0,10/14/2014,"First time visit for lunch. Gilbert was an excellent server: attentive, humorous, overall amazing service. My friend and I shared the artichoke stuffed mushrooms, avocado egg rolls, and California club flatbread. I tried the pm porter, which was delicious. Will definitely be back soon!"
Sheila C.,"Denver, CO",4,25,5,2.0,6/21/2014,"Yelp might do better to have separate ratings for food & service.  My friend and I came early on this summer Saturday. We simply wanted to have a drink and an appetizer or two.  Our waitress took our order promptly but it felt like she was disappointed that we were not having a full meal and started out only ordering one appetizer. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms at the same time as our drinks. Our drinks came promptly and then the small platter of a small amount of mushrooms came. No napkins, no table service. My friend did not want to make a fuss about it. But after eating the mushroom my hands were dripping. I signaled for the waitress who was busy chatting up another employee who alerted her. She sauntered over to the table with a big ol' attitude and plunked down the silverware wrapped in a cloth napkin with what looked like a forced smile. No words. All her communication with us was prefunctory, and in an unfriendly tone. As it was I ordered a second drink and a couple of more appetizers so the bill increased. I tipped her 20% but she would have gotten more if she'd been friendly and done her job properly.  The calamari was good and the creamy sauce it came with was tasty. My Margarita was not good. Too much Rose's Lime juice & ?.   I may be back - If so I hope for better service."
Li M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,16,4,1.0,7/12/2015,"Horrible attitude from manager. I brought a party of 40 with appointment, they ended up do not have enough space for us. No apology or nothing. So several friends had to sit at the bar almost for an hour. Food was very mediocre. Finally customers sitting at the table next to our party left, and I politely asked the manager if we can combine the table so my poor friends could join us. The manager literally yelled at me:"" yeah yeah yeah!!! You already told me before, didn't you? Why do you keep asking???"" Then he gave me a dirty look and left. How rude! I just want to remind you they just left and please had somebody clean the table! Considering I just brought you 40 people's business! NEVER return or book any events at this hell hole!"
Jay D.,"Broomfield, CO",13,8,14,5.0,5/2/2012,"My visit here didn't start out good. It was my first time at a BJ's and when I sat down and ordered Dr. Pepper... I was told they don't serve Dr. Pepper!!! The humanity!!! How do these places stay in business when they don't serve the nectar of life!?!? (truth be told, I boycott places that don't serve Dr. Pepper--meals just aren't the same without it). So while I was mortified and having to eat good food without good drink, I decided to stay. I had a gift card. ...otherwise I literally might have walked out. So why five stars??? Read on. My burger came out with avocado only on half so I wasn't too pleased with that either. But no big deal, they can bring me more avocado. The manager came around to each table, asking how things were. When he got to me I gave a little smile and said things were okay. This manager could read through my fake smile, however, and asked what he could do to make it better. I told him there was nothing he could do, just that I was greatly disappointed they didn't serve Dr. Pepper. He apologized but eventually moved away. Literally 5 minutes later he showed back up at my table with a cold bottle of Dr. pepper on a tray!!! FREE of charge! HE LITERALLY WENT ACROSS THE STREET TO THE GAS STATION AND BOUGHT ME ONE!!! WOW... that's customer service. I was ready to write a mediocre review and never go back... but how can I not give the management the props they deserve? They know how to please their customers. He did mention that they would start carrying Dr. Pepper about two weeks later. I haven't been back yet to find out. But I likely will. Good service brings repeat customers. So I'm HIGHLY recommending BJ's but I'm MORE specifically recommending THIS specific BJ's in Aurora, CO for obvious reasons."
Sheila G.,"Aurora, CO",2,4,4,4.0,9/17/2013,The service was decent and the food was great!! I went with burger melt with bacon very tasty!!
Black G.,"Aurora, CO",0,27,,3.0,1/7/2016,This place has kind of become our fall-back if another place isn't open or something.  Great selections and beer.  Great atmosphere.  Staff....eh depends on who you have.  Sometimes they're a disaster.  Other times they're great.
Michelle D.,"Denver, CO",0,8,,2.0,1/4/2015,"I ordered the garlic parmesean wings, what came out was half garlic parm and half buffalo style so I sent them back. What then came out was the same garlic parm wings (now cold) and the same buffalo wings with the buffalo sauce rinsed off and garlic parm sauce applied.  That is piss poor. 2 stars for the beer."
Ashlee H.,"Aurora, CO",37,55,3,4.0,6/19/2013,"I reviewed BJ's back in March and gave 3 stars - Today, we picked up lunch to-go and brought back to my client's office. My salad was super - a new grilled chicken/Thai/mango salad. It was simply fabulous. I just wish the service was better...They told me it would take 20 minutes - I arrived probably arrived 30 minutes after I called and it still wasn't ready. I waited another 5 minutes at the to-go counter before someone told me it would be a minute. I find that incredibly annoying. Great food today, but PLEASE improve on service."
Angie L.,"Aurora, CO",0,6,,4.0,12/30/2015,I have always enjoyed the atmosphere provided at this restaurant whether it be for a sports game or dinner with friends and family. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Food is amazing as well!
Tyler S.,"Denver, CO",192,257,113,4.0,1/3/2012,"Located by the Aurora mall on the east side of town, BJs brewhouse is where it's at. I recently took my pops here for lunch yesterday and I'm glad I did. BJ's has quite an expansive menu. Ranging from some of the most delicious pizzas I have eaten to their sandwiches, salads, and pasta. I am always impressed with the size of their menu and the array of foods geared towards pleasing everyone in your group. I usually order a pizza every time I come to BJ's - half buffalo chicken and half great white. The buffalo chicken side is always fantastic! They add freshly chopped red onions, chives and white chicken to the buffalo style sauce and then drizzle it with fresh house-made ranch (not the most healthiest, but it is sure tasty). The great white side is an alfredo based-sauce (again not the most healthy I know), with chicken, fresh garlic, and a bruchetta-style tomato. The crust is the best part - it is served deep dish and is thick and moist and delicious! Yesterday, however, I ordered their all you can eat soup and salad combo - and so did my dad. For the salad, went with a boring caesar salad light on dressing and for the soup I went with the chicken tortilla. The salad was pretty ordinary, nothing super special about it, but the soup was incredible! It came in a separate container that our waitress poured into our bowl around some crunchy tortilla strips, tomatoes, and freshly chopped avocado. The avocado in the soup was a nice touch! All-in-all, BJ's Brewhouse is a great place to check out (especially if you have some picky eaters in your crowd and you want to please everyone). Their beers are also great - I didn't order any yesterday, but they are always up to par with what meets your style or craving. They also have another location up north off of 104th by the Promenade Shops and movie theatre if you are on that side of town. Enjoy!"
Carla H.,"Aurora, CO",0,33,,4.0,11/15/2014,"Okay, I'll make this short and sweet. Go during happy hour....yummy food and good priced drinks. Their pizza dip is ahhhhh-mazing, or if you want something lighter-they're salads are great too. However, nothing compares to their pazookies! Get one. Don't think just do!!!!"
