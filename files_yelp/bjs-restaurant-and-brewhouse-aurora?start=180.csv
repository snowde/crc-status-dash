Dave S.,"Frisco, TX",1,37,264,5.0,1/19/2011,"Excellent weekday, lunchtime visit to this chain's location. I've been to about five different BJ's locations over the years; this one was on par -- no better or worse than the other locations. ""Same everything"" in terms of beer and food choices. The day we visited we had decent service and the food was great. My two teenage daughter's were very happy with their choices (pizza and chicken parmesan) while I had unlimited soup and salad. They had a specialty beer on tap (their Grand Cru) that was really excellent; I'm a huge beer geek and hophead. IMO the Grand Cru needed more coriander notes to be on-style but now I'm being picky. :-) Beer selection good; I do like that this chain provides guest taps for more choices. Our visit was in the winter so we did not sit outside; however, their patio looks to be quite awesome (and large) for summertime outings."
Jessica S.,"Denver, CO",0,35,,3.0,11/6/2014,"This place is meh. The food is okay, but pretty pricey for the quality and the quantity. The beer fits into the same category as the food; okay but pricey for what it is."
Wayne W.,"San Pedro, CA",7,166,80,4.0,10/12/2012,"Large variety of food and beer. I had the Jambelia and my wife had the pulled pork sandwich.   Both were very good.  Returned on the way back to LA. Waiter worked with me to merge the ingedients of two of their salads; each had good elements but needed something from the other to be complete.  Came out great. Large restrurant with long bar, plenty of sport screens, lots of windows, wood and brass.  Kept the sound on the sports down so it was not dominant (unless you were at the bar). Good servicer but somewhat forgetful. Hot cookie desert with ice cream is a nice touch; rich but good."
Charlie M.,"Skiatook, OK",0,10,36,4.0,7/5/2014,I had the house top sirloin maybe one of the best steaks I've had in a while. Topped off with there great beer selections it's a can't miss.
Jason S.,"Ronda, NC",63,50,1,4.0,3/20/2012,"BJ's is basically a more blue collar Cheesecake Factory. Oreo Pizookie is great, my wife highly recommends the Angel Hair Toscana."
Brittany H.,"Denver, CO",409,454,112,4.0,10/6/2011,I salivate at the thought of BJ's Oktoberfest and Pumpkin beers. Go get them.  For realz.
Allison S.,"Arvada, CO",91,59,27,4.0,8/31/2012,"A friend and I came here on a whim.  I wanted pasta, she didn't care too much and just wanted food.  They have a pretty big menu that has a bunch of choices on it.  Our waiter was pretty good and helped me in making a decision on what to get.  The food was good.  Nothing spectacular, but better than Applebees... I'll def go back..."
Bruce K.,"Charlotte, NC",1414,8479,16594,4.0,8/17/2009,"Great (strong) beer and great service, I had to visit TWICE today - once for lunch (without the beer) and then after work, where I enjoyed two. BJ's reminds me strongly of Karl Strauss Brewery, a very similar California-based microbrewery/restaurant with the same sort of formula and I think very similar offerings.  At lunch, I enjoyed their lunch sized Cobb salad (pre-tossed) with what was billed as a ""large"" bowl of Tuscan tomato soup that was a little on the small side. Both tasted excellent, but I left hungry. Great service. Returning for dinner, the little man on my right shoulder pointed his pitchfork at me and I had no choice but to order the open-faced chili cheese burger, which was more food than a human should be allowed to eat in one sitting. A half pound burger with a generous service of chili and cheese on top of a burger bun with a massive pile of fries (your choice: thin or wedge cut). I was barely able to eat the burger and chili, leaving both bun halves and three fourths of the (delicious) fries. While downing this monster portion of food, I partook of one pint of their hefeweisen and one pint of blonde, which I swear must be stronger than we usually get back in Charlotte. My dinner waitress was attentive and seemed to understand the pace of the meal I was enjoying, stopping by at appropriate times to check on me. I was very pleased with her service. The same for lunch. The walls all have TV's on them, especially the very large one over the bar. A perfect place for me to catch tonight's Monday Night Football (pre-season) game. Go Panthers! Overall, an excellent choice and I am very glad that I returned. Good value for money, too!"
Mike C.,"Aurora, CO",6,11,,3.0,5/29/2014,The great white pizza is bomb along with the clam chowder bowl. The food is overly priced and the service is mediocre as well.
Allison O.,"Denver, CO",11,38,1,3.0,6/11/2014,"This is a good choice for the area and if you are looking for a variety of options for your group.  I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but this one is pretty good overall.  Service was also good and our food/drinks were served quickly.  A good choice if you are near the Aurora mall."
Tomas L.,"Norwalk, CA",16,37,2,1.0,6/23/2015,"Took 20 minutes to be seated, after being seated took 15 minutes to be served and the waiter rushed us. Not happy and will be calling corporate. Oh and 2 female managers were standing around laughing and joking it up. Pretty pathetic for a food establishment."
Allison F.,"Aurora, CO",91,422,49,4.0,4/12/2012,"Came here for lunch on Monday. We were quickly seated and it looks like a popular place for business groups. We enjoyed that the seating was a fair distance from each other so you got a more private dining experience. Even though there were only a few tables occupied, it was still fairly noisy. The menu is indeed huge for both drinks and food. I had the berry cider that is made in house and it's a nice change up from your traditional apple. We had a hard time making choices with the food menu and it might actually be too large. I finally decided on the california burger, my husband had the potato skins, and my friend had the fried artichokes, mac and cheese, and tomato and mozzerella salad from the 'small plates' section.  My burger was served on thick texas toast and I liked the addition of the green chilis and the avocado. It was quite a heavy burger and kept me full for the rest of the day/evening. My husband was served 10 potato skins, which were enough to feed him for lunch and dinner. And the little plates my friend got were all very good. I had an artichoke and it was delicious. The mac and cheese was enjoyed, though the tomato salad was too salty. Overall, we had a good visit here. Their patio is huge and looks like an ideal place to be on a sunny day. We've tried to come here for dinner on a weekend and the lineups get to be huge. Either arrive early or see if you can make a reservation."
Sarah S.,"Denver, CO",18,19,,4.0,7/17/2014,"I really enjoyed coming here! Their drinks are amazing, the berry cider was my favorite drink. And their artichoke stuffed mushrooms were to die for! :) The food was alright and the service was decent, could have been better. But the environment was great, the patio at night with the heaters are amazing. :) and the cookie and cream pazookies (cookies and ice cream) are amazing !!!"
Michele M.,"Parker, CO",0,15,,5.0,7/11/2015,"We had a great experience.  Service was fantastic.  We went at 2:30 in the afternoon and are servicer, Shane, was attentive and timely.  We had the honey shiracah brussel sprouts as an appetizer and loved it.  Our entrees included their pasta, pizza, kale salad, and Mac n cheese. Everyone enjoyed their meal.  I must say,  the mac n cheese was a bit runny, but good.  We finished with a pizookie. Yum!! We'd definitely return."
John Y.,"Chicago, IL",363,30,,4.0,4/14/2011,"Person at the Company recommended BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, and we went there on a Wednesday night.  Hockey playoffs just started, and thankfully the place had Versus.  We were considering going to Dry Dock Brewery, but that place does not have the hockey channel package or even the Versus channel!   I ordered the Piranha Beer, Chicken Potstickers and the New Orleans Jumbalaya.  The beer pairing with the Jumbalaya was recommended by the waitress, and it worked well together. If I am back in Denver, I will definitely come back to this place.  The menu is extensive, so I am looking forward to trying something new."
Amanda W.,"Denver, CO",0,7,,2.0,7/5/2015,"Went to this restaurant for the second time. First time was a great experience. This time, not so much. It all started when we were greeted when we walked in. We told the host we had 7 people. She looked at me like ""really how are we to accommodate that"" she gave us the look like it was a hassle to put two tables together.  After we sat down it took 10 minutes for the server to get to us. He got our drink order and then brought us back the drinks. He placed an appetizer order and then didn't return to our table for another 20 min. He checked our drinks, but didn't take our meal order. We ordered after being there 45 min already. When we received our food, the wrong dish came out. He forgot to bring our drink refills more then once and was way slow when returning to our table. The service was horrible and extremely slow. The restaurant was not busy either. We were there for almost 2 hours. I will not return to this restaurant."
Brian H.,"Cincinnati, OH",52,146,86,5.0,5/7/2014,Always great service and outstanding food selection. Wide assortment of hand crafted beers.
Patrick Y.,"Denver, CO",36,42,,4.0,4/2/2012,"Huge selection for food and beers and everything else.  A good play with different variety of ingredients.  The first time I went, I got there California Burger and the big seller for me was the sourdough.  It was not on your traditional hamburger bun.  The second I went, I got a mini pizza with portobello mushrooms and balsamic vinegar.  I never had a pizza with portobello mushrooms. I like the art work on the walls.  Mostly funny pictures of the old paintings."
Christina F.,"Durango, CO",4,34,6,3.0,4/30/2013,"Ugh....I really hate giving places less than 4 stars....but I think I am a little biased....in fact, 3 stars is likely too generous for this experience but luckily I rarely rate less than 3 stars.  I know the restaurant business is tough -- so 3 for me is the lowest I can typically go.   First, I worked at a BJ's in college so I know the system.....I was SHOCKED at how poor the service was at this location. Awful....just awful!   First, we were greeted nicely and sat promptly...but after this it all went downhill FAST....well, slowly.....!  We were not greeted or even acknowledged by a server/greeter for at least 10 minutes (and that's after we had been sitting for a bit and decided to see how long it would take to get a shout out and taking note of the time on our clocks.....). It would be important to also note that after this ridiculous wait (10 plus minutes) my Husband finally got up and politely asked the hostess what was going on....just a water at the point would have been welcomed.  After about 5 minutes after that we finally got a less than interested waitress.  She didn't apologize at all and HAD to have known we were irritated -- Im certain I had it written all over my face. It's just so rude. BUT, I believe in being polite so I pulled it together and treated her nicely. The other thing that really rubbed me the wrong was was that during this period of LONG waiting... I saw the Manager (maybe 2 of them -- I can't be certain)....stroll (and by stroll I mean slllooooowly work their way to the other side of the restaurant -- clearly they didn't want to be there either so I can see why the service sucks so bad) past our table more than a few times.  Did they not notice we were sitting there FOREVER without even a greet or drink order (I know they know this....the coaster on the table after a first greet is a great indicator). Clearly even management didn't care....  As a restaurant manager I certainly notice these things when I'm on the job....or even a customers staring eye?  Nope....not these guys! WOW!     We ordered a lot of food for old times sake -- things we missed and had to try during our visit to the city.  The food of course was good...but the service and lack of care really took all ""longing"" for the food away!  I was pretty disgusted to be treated so poorly on what seemed to be a slower day.  Now, in all honesty...it was a Sunday and I KNOW the Sunday crowd can be rough -- but seriously -- get it together! We left a 20% tip -- I'm not sure why -- I regret it, but again...I always have a soft spot when it comes to this because I have spent so much time in the industry.  What a sucker!   We won't be back....there are WAY too many options to choose from to decide on a place with such hideous service all the way around.  No thank you!  I wonder why corporate hasn't come to straighten this store out -- shocking!"
Phung L.,"Aurora, CO",119,277,69,3.0,1/7/2014,Been here a couple of times with a group of friends for some beers and appetizers.  I thought this place was just ok.  The appetizers were just ok nothing special. A tad bit pricey might I add!  Definitely not worth the price...We always find ourselves racking up a staggering tab and finding ourselves asking why did we even bother coming here?  The place itself looks nice though.
