Rachel M.,"Englewood, CO",109,175,27,4.0,3/25/2011,"It isn't often I so savor the words tomato and bisque together. Met a friend here for dinner this eve and had a very pleasant and quality dinner. Friday night at this location wasn't a problem for seating, plus the two of us got a cool round booth which reminded us of teacup amusement park rides. But I digress... My frozen cocktail, some peach-titled concoction, was delightful and gorgeous. The tomato bisque soup I opted for with my entree was probably my favorite portion of the entire experience. It was thick, creamy, tasted to perfection and warmed me right down to my toes. My entree was the grilled pork chops which was a great choice for what I wanted - something that didn't feel heavy and ventured more toward the health side of things. The sweet apples with the mashed potatoes and pork chops were a perfect combination, along with the side of green beans. Dessert? Lawdy lawd. I ordered two items to bring home to the kids: some berry bramble delightful assortment and the fudge brownie. Both were rich, decadent and entirely sinful. The ambience was nicer than a grill restaurant for sure, and kind of tended toward a darker version of a Cheesecake Factory. I'm sure the majority of the patrons were also in huge favor of the giant screens displaying college basketball for their brackets."
Annie B.,"Aurora, CO",224,266,259,2.0,5/2/2010,"This place is definitely inconsistent.   I've had some pretty good meals here and I've had some not so good meals here.  Today, was not so good.  Our waitress, I think her name was Erin, was bad.  She showed up to take our order, brought our salad and that was about it. The salad was disgusting.  The lettuce was pink, brown and wilted.  How could the cook in the kitchen plate that dish and how could a server let that plate leave the line in the condition it was in?  The management here should be embarrassed. We split the appetizer sampler.  It was alright.  Not fantastic, but not horrible.  It was just, meh.  The artichoke dip tasted like it was a few days old, sauce from the egg rolls had spilled out of the ramekin and on to the plate and the chips were over salted.  It was just very sloppy.  The fact that the appetizer sampler was OK and not horrible saved this review from being only rated with one star.  I also asked for a water when we got our salad and never got one.  I had to wave to a different waitress to get a glass of water. I hope the management at BJ's reads this and sees that there are issues that need to be addressed.  You should be ashamed of yourselves."
Mike H.,"Aurora, CO",41,50,,5.0,10/21/2010,"I highly recommend this place. The food portions are large and very good.  My favorites are the French Dip and the Parmesan Crusted Chicken.  For dessert they have ""pizookies"", which are warm cookies with ice cream--you have to try one! The beers are good.  I have especially enjoyed the pumpkin beer. Try BJs--its not your typical brewery."
Erica R.,"Ava, MO",0,58,1,4.0,8/30/2013,A few minor issues of food not being completely correct but they fixed it instantly and their clam chowder keeps bringing me back for more. I love their soup and salad lunch.
Brigette E.,"Aurora, CO",28,10,1,5.0,8/17/2013,"Such a grey menu, so much to chose from. I recommend parmesan crusted chicken and the pizookie!"
Nikki K.,"Castle Rock, CO",1,12,,1.0,2/12/2014,"Normally a great place that has had very bad service. Their service got better until today. My family are regulars an we go there all the time, an we have always looked past the bad service. Today we ordered food that was wrong on two meals! Mistakes that contradicted their own menu! But the manager Randy shocked me when she insisted on arguing about things that were wrong on the order an kept arguing! Talk about bad management she needs classes in costumer service training again. Very disappointed in the restaurant an management."
Brady K.,"Denver, CO",69,278,30,4.0,5/6/2012,"I use to live around this place and have frequented BJ's often.  I was in the neighborhood and knew it would be a solid bet.  For those who have never been, know that BJ's has great beers!  I recently found out that they have DRY DOCK BREWERY'S VANILLA PORTER on tap!!!!!  If you are a beer fan, get the taster set.  The ambiance is great and it would be a good place to take a date or a crowd you want to impress and the consistency factor with service and food is on point.  As far as the food they try and do a little spin on the traditional bar food, but all in all, it is still the standard bar food.  BJ's gets 4 stars because of the beer selection, great service, and great atmosphere."
Kristin W.,"Aurora, CO",138,42,9,5.0,4/24/2011,"Huge fan of this place. I love breweries anyway, so I was super excited to go to another one.  I had a berry beer that was absolutely fantastic...the kind of beer that you can easily drink too much of because it was THAT tasty.  The food was AWESOME, with enormous portions. I ordered a caesar side salad just because I love salad as an appetizer, and I swear I could have just eaten that by itself! The plate was huge! I then had a barbeque chicken pizza. It was very tasty. It was a little small (I got the individual sized one), but with my huge salad, I didn't need much more.  The staff is also very nice and accommodating. We were there for a friends' birthday, and we brought a cake with us, which they held in the back in the fridge until dessert time. Then they brought it out, candles lit and all! They didn't even moan and complain when we stayed extra long to chat and have a few drinks with the birthday boy.  I definitely recommend BJ's. Great place, great food. Huge venue, too, so plenty of seating room even on busy nights."
Ryan G.,"Denver, CO",8,11,1,4.0,12/10/2009,"Last night was my first trip to BJ's and one of the few times I've ventured out of Cap Hill for a night out in awhile! The Christmas gathering of friends seemed like the perfect occasion for a place such as BJ's and it didn't disappoint.  The decor is modern and the space quite expansive - presumably, because the brewery is in the back and the operations require some serious ceiling room. I'll agree with others that the food is probably a bit overpriced in relation to the overall quality, but it's far from a deal breaker. We enjoyed the pizza, which had a very doughy crust and large tomato chunks over the entirety of it - this seemed to be the case on the all the pies I saw rolling past. The mushrooms and artichoke hearts were fresh and all the elements seemed of pretty good quality. Originally being from Chicago, I'm kind of particular about my pizza, but this was tasty stuff and relatively unique.  On to the beers, which is the most important part of the equation at any place professing to be a brewery. They obviously had their own brews on tap (a pale ale, porter, stout, hefeweizen, and some seasonals), but they also had a GREAT selection from Colorado breweries. Left Hand, Oskar Blues, Tommyknocker, and Boulder Beer were all represented behind the bar! I opted for BJ's own Piranha Pale to get started and enjoyed it. Very drinkable, if not spectacular, but it didn't try to be anything it wasn't. From there I had a Dale's (Oskar Blues), which is my local favorite and hard to ever pass up from the tap. With my meal, I had BJ's porter which was tasty and fit well with the frigid weather we were dealing with.  Our service was lacking in attentiveness for a group of nearly ten people, but he was a nice enough guy and the hostess did a great job of getting us taken care of and accommodating a couple kids in the group.  Check it out if you're in the Aurora Mall area!"
Erin B.,"Denver, CO",26,23,,4.0,1/28/2013,"This is our go-to ""want to grab a quick bite to eat"" spot. The food is consistently decent, the staff is friendly, and you pretty much know what you're going to get. None of the food is unbelievable, but all of it is great for the price."
Love L.,"Pacific Grove, CA",0,20,,5.0,8/23/2014,"This was our last ditch effort to find something good for dinner while traveling through Denver. All the restaurants near our hotel were either fast food or had bad reviews. We chose this place on a whim, and did take out. It was delicious, fresh, and fast! I even ordered off the ""lower calorie menu"" which are usually notoriously bad, but the Mediterranean chicken tacos were so good, not to mention vegetable heavy. Would absolutely order from here again!"
Joanne P.,"Denver, CO",37,24,3,4.0,7/15/2014,Brew pub Pork Chops good! Angel hair pasta pretty tasteless. They do have glutrn free items including pizza.
D F.,"Aurora, CO",0,79,3,1.0,7/25/2012,"An associate of mine and I went into BJ's in hopes to get some work done and have a few pints.  We found out there was no WIFI provided for the customers, too bad it was after we ordered a round of beers.  We quickly drank the beer and tabbed out.  Chips and salsa, two beers for $21?  Seriously $6.95 for a pint of your crappy Hefewizen?  No thanks, never again.  And why does this location call themselves a brewhouse?  They don't brew beer here?  Too many great places in Aurora who do the brewing onsite and provide FREE WIFI."
Na P.,"Thornton, CO",5,22,,1.0,4/2/2012,"We went in at almost 10pm last Saturday night.  There were some patrons there but it was far from being busy.   Our drinks came out pretty fast.  It took a while for us to place our food order.  But when we did, we ordered stuffed mushrooms and fried artichoke hearts to start, and then added a pizza to share.   I asked for a straw for my drink and never received it.  Our appetizers came out pretty fast (it was delivered by another waitress).  Not shortly after our pizza arrived, however, it was warm but with a place known for their pizzas, this should have been pipin' hot.  This is not the reason why I'm giving this place 1 star. Reason for the 1 star - The lack of customer service,  not only to us but everyone in her section.  It was a night full of waiting - from ordering our food to getting our take out boxes, to receiving our tab and to processing our payment.  Apparently she waited until all of her tables needed/requested boxes so that she can go get them ALL at once.  The same happened when we wanted our tabs, she went to grab the tabs ALL at once and then she processed the payments ALL at the same time.  It was so bad that one guy walked around the entire place looking for her!  Basically we got everything at her convenience.   Ridiculous service!"
Joelle Z.,"Uptown, Oakland, CA",30,13,,1.0,7/1/2014,Horrible experience today. Service was slow. When food arrived asked two servers for Parmesan cheese and red chili peppers. One Server said ok and never returned. The other came back with the cheese said he would be back with the chilies. No return. Finally the person who took our order returned. She went to the back and brought me the chilies. Only bad thing now- the food is cold. I guess I can eat my lunch for dinner. Ugh
Marci A.,"Denver, CO",0,6,,1.0,4/3/2015,"I've only set foot into this place twice and that was enough for me to know that I'll never be back.  The first time I went it was the first beautiful sunny day of Spring and my boyfriend and I wanted to sit on the patio and enjoy the sunshine. Well, the hostesses made a fuss about sitting us on the patio for some reason and when they finally took us out there they put us at a table in the shade so I asked nicely if we could sit in the sun. ""Ugh, let me grab my towel... again,"" said the hostess. Our waitress was nice, thank goodness, but the hostesses, not so much. The second time, my mom was visiting from Georgia and we were in the area and decided to have a beer on the patio. Another beautiful sunny day and we saw people sitting on the patio so we asked the hostess if we could sit outside. ""The patio is closed."" she said to us, even though it was a gorgeous day and there were people already sitting out there. I informed her that there were people sitting there and that they were losing business by not opening the outside on a 80 degree day. We weren't about to waste such a gorgeous day so we obviously went somewhere else. Advice to the owner, open the patio or tell your hostesses to lose the attitude. If a customer wants to sit at a certain table or a certain part of the restaurant, accommodate them. They will continue to give you business. As for me, you can find me enjoying a  sunny patio at a restaurant who actually wants my business."
Max S.,"San Diego, CA",16,130,13,2.0,6/5/2012,"Meh. Waited 5 minutes at the take-out counter with no service. No one else waiting, not busy. No acknowledgement or apology for me having waited so long for service. The girl at the counter had to go to the adding machine to figure out my change, and she still got it wrong. Left with my take-out order, and got home to realize my salad had been left out of the bag. Overall a disappointing experience."
Hymae W.,"San Jose, CA",19,391,117,4.0,9/18/2012,Order the Jambalaya here and it was excellent. Very spicy and a huge serving. I couldn't fish it all because i thought i was going to sweat myself to death. I also had their stout and it was excellent.
Chelsea M.,"Denver, CO",29,5,,2.0,9/8/2011,"It hurts me to only give BJ's 2 stars because I do love this restaurant.  I used to go to the one in Boulder and I would give them 5 stars easily.  I have been to the Aurora BJ's 3 times in the past 5 months and each time I've had a couple issues.  First of all, every time it has taken way too long especially since they weren't that busy.  Twice, I have sat on the patio and basically been annoyed.  Last week we were sitting out there and the server seemed put out that he had to come around to the back.  If the patio is open, we are allowed to sit there.  It is not our fault if our table is away from your other ones (mind you, there were 3 other parties sitting back there).  The time we sat inside, we had a very sweet, young girl who struggled a little but we've all had first jobs so it wasn't a big deal.  I ordered a side Caesar that never came, but she took it off the bill right away and was extremely apologetic.  This last time my Caesar salad arrived before our drinks or waters got there (I figured it was just my Caesar from the last visit that has been all ready and waiting for me to come back) but without the appetizer that our friends ordered.  Then when the waiter came around to bring our cocktails (yes, the waters and our friends' 2 beers arrived and then 10 mins later our cocktails arrived), I asked if I could have some more water.  His response was, ""if I ever get a second, I'll try to bring you your water"" with a snippy tone as if I had asked 30 times already.  My friends thought it was pretty funny since I looked like I had gotten slapped in the face, I was so surprised by his response.  Our pizza (for 2 of us), a sandwich and gumbo arrived, however, there were only 2 sets of silverware for the whole table.  The food deliverer (not our waiter) brought the pizza without individual plates or a stand to put the pizza on, she plopped it down in front of my boyfriend and said ""hang on a second"".  Our waiter came by and said, ""Oh yeah, sorry, I would have brought you plates but I was too busy.""  On his way back in, our friend asked for ketchup (she had fries, it didn't seem like an unreasonable request) and he audibly sighed before continuing inside.  If anyone has been keeping track, at this point we are still short an order of potstickers.  We received them about 30 seconds before we got the bill.  He did take off the potstickers and put them in a to-go box so all's well that ends well. All in all, I still love BJ's, I will still continue going there, this location just needs to get their stuff together.  Management, please speed up the service and apologize to the wait staff from me for asking them to do what they get paid to do!"
Randall S.,"Aurora, CO",138,104,20,3.0,6/19/2012,"Decent food and not overly priced. I know one of the Kitchen Managers so we stop in every now and then. LOVE the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. We've had the apps and the majority are decent, typical fare. Service can be so-so but we've never had to wait for a table even when they are super busy."
