Katie L.,"Seattle, WA",75,289,140,4.0,11/1/2009,"Pretty pricey but tastey. Probably wouldn't go out of my way to go here. Got fish tacos for like $10 which is kind of extreme but they were good. They have their own beer which is nice. We sampled the pumpkin and also a porter. Both were really quite scrum. They have a giant screen in the bar that we watched a nuggets game on which was nice. Service, good. They have a turnstyle door and I am a huge fan of that so obviously 4 stars."
Raine B.,"Cedar Park, TX",144,30,39,3.0,6/1/2011,"We go to BJ's a lot because it is very close to our house and we like the drinks.  I just get concerned to go there for an entire meal as the food is tasty but really greasy. Everything seems to be deep fried and/or loaded with grease. BTW, Waiters are TERRIBLE! They always have you waiting long for every request you make, even to refill water or bring condiments. Go there for happy-hour without big expectations!"
Kim O.,"Aurora, CO",13,21,3,3.0,9/11/2010,"BJ's has a nice patio with heat lamps which makes it great for fall evenings! I highly recommend the clam chowder in the sourdough bowl and the calamari. As a brewhouse should, BJ's offers a long list of world renowned beers.  This isn't my typical hangout but even so, my experience was pretty excellent!"
Larry K.,"Littleton, CO",94,109,24,4.0,5/27/2012,"It's Fish and chip Friday!!!  Great food, great scene...  The only annoyance was our waitress reeked of cigarettes. We will be back for more!"
Cynthia L.,"San Antonio, TX",0,10,,3.0,10/17/2012,Ordered the new quesadilla which was delicious but the chicken teriyaki could have been better; service was good
Ivy M.,"Denver, CO",67,92,18,3.0,3/11/2012,"Was not impressed by the food, calamari was not good. The atmosphere seems nice for being in Aurora, I will try it again, and per recommendation I'll order the pink beer. But if your able to eat else where .. head downtown."
Cass D.,"Englewood, CO",140,921,257,3.0,3/2/2009,"My service was alright. Nothing spectacular. The food is very good, but it costs a bit more then I think it should. I'd stop there again if I am in the area and have the money to spend, but I won't be making a special trip... Rock Bottom Brewery & Old Chicago are closer and cheaper for me."
Ami R.,"Aurora, CO",74,14,,4.0,11/3/2011,I really like this place.  They have good food and beer.  I didn't have beer on this visit..just ice tea.  I had the lunch special one toping pizza and salad.  It's a great price and it's good.  I will try the half flatbread pizza and salad next time..the regular pizza is just too much bread.  This would be a great place to go and watch sports...they have serveral tv's.  The staff is very friendly and service was great..as always.  That was a special day for a group of firefighters and I was happy to have them sit at a table near me.  Yum and Yum.
Jodi A.,"Denver, CO",145,237,31,4.0,1/11/2012,"I like this place. The avocado egg rolls are my favorite....the wedge fries were awesome and so was my California burger on sourdough, but after consuming hefewiezen and the appetizer, I was full !  The service here is friendly, and on a Tuesday night, the place was packed !"
Jolene C.,"Denver, CO",4,100,,5.0,7/10/2011,"When you have a big group of people who all like different food, but all love beer, this is a great place to take them.  Big menu full of ""American"" favorites like pizza, burgers, pasta, and salads and a pretty hefty beer list.   The service is great, parking is plentiful, and the location can't be beat - right across the street from the Aurora Mall and about 1/2 mile from the onramp to I-225. Service is truly excellent, your drinks never get empty, the food is always hot, and the bathrooms are immaculate.  Highly recommended for when you need a lot of different food options for a lot of different people. I should also note that its pretty spacious in there - it's like the whole restaurant was designed to accommodate wheelchairs and walkers.  The entrance and aisles are very wide.  Even the bathrooms had extra-wide doors and a wheelchair-level sink."
S. S.,"Aurora, CO",12,68,19,4.0,12/18/2011,"Yes!!!!  Love the beer, fried artichoke hearts, and the pizza was almost as good as old Chicago's which is hard to beat, so... Over all... Grubbin'!"
Randee D.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,4,,5.0,5/2/2014,"Love, love , love everything about this restaurant! Server's,  manager's and the food. Go every day if you can. Try the new Salted Caramel Pizookie!"
Dane R.,"Earlham, IA",0,2,,5.0,7/16/2012,Awesome! I got the pork ribs. Amazing. The cook deserved a hug.
Jason D.,"Denver, CO",1,35,13,4.0,7/13/2012,"AWESOME FOOD!  The atmosphere is very cool, and the servers are always great! I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for something other than burgers and tacos. Worth the drive."
A.J. T.,"South San Francisco, CA",32,63,,4.0,12/9/2010,"BJs rocks. Service was great, food was great, portions were enough to enjoy AND take home. Plus the beer was outstanding, I love the BJs brews but also the fact that their beer selection is more than just the typicals. You can get anything from a seasonal brew to a Belgian to a simple wheat. Plus, the Pazookie is insane. It's basically this delicious warm gooey cookie topped with ice cream and whipped cream. Enough for two to share too!  A little on the pricey side (I'm a hole-in-the-wall cheapass) but even as your grudgingly pulling our your credit card to pay, you'll have nothing but happy thoughts about your food and service. Pros: BEER SELECTION. Good service, variety on menu, good portions. Cons: A little more pricey than you'd find in most of downtown. But not much."
Jason L.,"Littleton, CO",4,78,30,4.0,10/12/2008,"This is a really good place. It lost a star because I feel its a little overpriced (just enough to make it a special trip as opposed to a regular one). The service is good. I have ordered curbside pizza a few times to bring it home and its always been done right. They were 5-10 minutes behind one time. The manager came out and apologized and offered me a free beer. At that point I didn't mind waiting for a few minutes.  For those that have tried things other than pizza, they've enjoyed it. I had chicken tenders once, they were plenty good, not amazing, but fine. Their dessert cookies are an absolute must have. Get the cookies and cream. Best ever! Their pot stickers are tasty too."
Chuck B.,"Denver, CO",2,85,21,4.0,10/2/2011,"Standard restaurant. Cannot say that there is anything special about this place. If you are looking for consistency and a place to enjoy the people you are with, this would be a good option."
Jonathan S.,"Centennial, CO",0,19,,3.0,11/27/2013,"There are a lot of options on the menu, so they get good marks there. The food is average but $7 for an average draft?  I'll stick to the breweries with better beer that only charge $5.  After all, what is the main reason you go to a brewery?"
Suzanne P.,"Aurora, CO",98,212,47,4.0,8/8/2011,"LOVE IT! This one seems better than most of their locations. We had guests from Texas and they are regulars at ""their"" BJ's, they mentioned that the nit whit beer tastes way better at the Aurora location so I know its not just me!"
David M.,"Littleton, CO",130,11,11,5.0,8/18/2011,This restaurant brewery is one of my favorites. I plan my flights from Dallas to Denver to arrive around 4PM so we can get here for happy hour and enjoy a great meal before heading on home to Littleton. They have great homemade fresh beer. It's also a great place to hang out and watch most any sports that may be on at the time.
