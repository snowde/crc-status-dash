Brooke F.,"Denver, CO",20,48,,4.0,10/25/2010,"I am a huge fan of BJs food. They have a wide variety of food ranging from pasta and pizza to baked potatoes (ginormous 1lb+ with toppings) to soup, salads, sandwiches... You get the picture. If you want a wide variety of selections, BJs is your place to go! I highly recommend saving room for dessert and getting a pizookie. Sounds like a silly name, I know but they are to die for. A cookie served in a mini pizza pan, cooked til it's done but still ooey gooey in the center and topped with ice cream, this dessert is always my go-to dessert when we go there! The service is all right, but it could be better. Still, the food makes it well worth it."
Adriena W.,"Aurora, CO",2,35,,5.0,3/12/2012,"BJ's service has really improved over the last few visits and their rewards program is amazing! The food is consistently great. My favorites are the chicken Parmesan and ahi tuna wonton dish.  Plus they have free pizookie day every once in awhile. Overall, great place with great food and service!"
Chris L.,"Antioch, CA",24,117,,3.0,6/14/2011,"well whats there to say hmmmm. well lets start off with the service being kind of slow but the wait staff did make up for it when a small issue arose. The food was great it always is, just a little expensive when it comes to the appetizers cmon 7 bucks for 6 eggrolls cmon thats just a little much and well they didnt taste any different then one i buy at the store go figure. All in all it was a good experience but im not ever getting a appetizer again"
Jain W.,"Commerce City, CO",0,2,,1.0,6/25/2012,"if i could i wouldnt even give one star!  We've been here 5 times total, the very first time our service was Amazing! The avocado spring rolls are awesome. But the service here is awful and getting worse. We came here in May with some out of state friends. The food was great but again our service was bad. We waited for 10 mins after our food was brought out for refills on our drinks, the server had forgotten so when we stopped him again he said he would get them out right away, No apology though. After our meal he brought out our check and we asked if we could get a military discount. He said yes, but needed a manager's approval and went to take the ID cards. That's when we told him politely that he can't take our military id cards away from the table, and that if the manager needed to see our ids he can come to our table. This was the 3rd time being here and we NEVER had the server try to take our ID's (nor EVER had any restaurant try and take our ID's away from the table). He said we would go get his manager. 15 mins later No manager came but he returned with our check with a military discount.  Our most recent t trip and our last to this restaurant our waitress was awful! We ordered an appetizer she said she would get us some plates and silverware. 10 minutes later we got our appetizer but still no plates, or silverware. When my husband got the attention of a different waitress, we asked for plates, and silverware. She rolled her eyes at us! And said ""yeah hold on."" (In a real pissy tone) Finally our food came. But my grandma was having a problem eating her sandwich, the bread was falling apart. When our waitress came walking by we got her attention. When I asked for a new slice of bread she said "" yes sure. But just so you know the bread will fall apart again it's just the multigrain bread they use. But Next time you come ask them to toast it for you it holds it together better.""  Umm why not toast the bread I just asked you to bring out? Instead my grandma said no thank you ill just eat it with a fork and knife. We were all a bit frustrated at this point with our service. Again when she brought our check we asked for military discount. She stated they don't offer military discount. When we asked if that just happened, because they have offered it in the past she told us they've never offered military discount (Also in a really pissy tone). Finally we've had enough my husband asked to speak to a manager. About 15 mins later she returned with NO manager, no apology, but with our check including military discount on ONE of our drinks so the total discount was $1.00 off a $65 bill. We were insulted I can't believe how awful the service is her.  We will NEVER return to this restaurant again.  As for the manager I hope he realizes that his employees need a talking to about professionalism. Rolling your eyes at a customer is so disrespectful and shouldn't be tolerated. If I hadn't of been there with my family, and it was just my husband and myself we would have left then! Also if they don't know what discounts the restaurants offer to customer's maybe they should learn."
Blythe K.,"Haleiwa, HI",9,54,2,4.0,3/25/2008,"I had a hard time deciding on what to eat here - lots of great-looking items on the menu!  I went with a veggie burger, which was very typical (nothing special) but still tasted great.  Better than the meal, the draft root beer was a refreshing change from the syrupy crap you get out of a fountain.  My husband had a couple of the beers and gave them a thumbs up. It wasn't super expensive or anything, but I removed a star because I felt it was slightly overpriced for the quality of the food.  However, the atmosphere was great and the brand-new quality of the restaurant made for a pleasant dinner."
Jamie P.,"Fort Morgan, CO",0,1,,5.0,8/21/2010,"My husband I ate here and loved it! The beer was great, the chicken parmesan awesome, and the fish tacos delicious! For the amount if food we received the price was just right. Our server, Emily, was attentive and friendly. We will definitely return when we're in the area."
Megan M.,"Aurora, CO",0,6,,1.0,7/21/2013,"The service was horrible. My server was a sweet girl, I think the problem is the management. My food was cold, the manager (sm. asian )  was nice to me ( of coarse) and apologized. I was so i sat and observed. She ran around like it was her place. Trying to blame a problem on the nearest working. Will never eat there again. I wouldn't be surprised in a few years if they're out of business."
Alan B.,"Denver, CO",9,54,17,4.0,3/5/2010,"bjs has an upscale atmosphere but a feeling like you're at a small pub. The beer list was presented to us as soon as we sat down along with parings for the beer. They were more than willing to bring samples of their brews to help me make my ultimate decision on the pint I would most enjoy, although they were all very good I decided to try the Jeremiah red which went great with the pizza we had. We tried the buffalo chicken pizza, which basically tastes like a hot wing on crust. Sadly the pizza bread is most of the pizza with a thin layer of toppings. The crust was buttery and and perfectly crisp. The wait staff were very friendly and kept the waters and teas full during the meal."
Bryan H.,"Pine, CO",54,134,44,4.0,10/20/2010,"Great service, atmosphere, and most importantly yummy beer. Food is otay, I'd rather just grab the beer and an app."
Allison M.,"Northville, MI",1,11,,5.0,11/19/2011,This place is amazing! The staff is friendly and always quick to accommodate our table. The menu has everything...seriously...everything.. you could ever want. Their beer is great and try the BJ's  pizza. I LOVE BJ's Brewhouse!
Donovan E.,"Englewood, CO",7,76,1,4.0,1/5/2010,"great balance of beer and food. they brew like 7 of their own beers. all pretty good and they have a great kick. they also have seasonal/special beers at time. the selection is also pretty good for microbrew/draft beers, and imports and bottles.  food is delectable, and i always get the pizza. one of the only places around you can get whole, roasted garlic cloves on your deep dish style pizza. awesome!  i usually do the 7 beer sampler. great buzz, great all around flava! compliments the food/pizza well. they always have cool ambient music playing, numerous TVs and sports games, bar or seating, and a friendly staff. i just wish the place had a little bit better lighting scheme. and this is like 1 of a few in the whole area which is a bummer now that my drive is twice as far. highly recommended for anybody who needs to relax, have a beer, and tasty plentiful food to go along with it. and if you havent had a pazooki, theres no better time to try one (cookie with ice cream on top)."
Jessica C.,"Englewood, CO",15,99,21,4.0,5/19/2009,"Excellent Happy hour, and the staff accommodates the last minute crowd for Fridays. The drinks are gorgeous, the food is portioned, and the crowd varies."
Dana H.,"Centennial, CO",2,21,,1.0,2/7/2012,"The 1st time we visited BJ's was right before Christmas and the food was terrible and after sending back my entree once, the manager came out to apologize.  I mean, who advertises a dish with pine nuts and then leaves them out?  The service was also very slow and what could've been an easy dinner in/out at Chili's, this place took hours.  After that I figured it wouldn't be my 1st choice to go again and we only live 5 mins away. Today my husband thought we should give it a second shot and I'm sad to say I agreed.  Even sadder to say that my food was bad & I've had an upset stomach since arriving home.   The waitress pounced on us a minute after we were sat and seemed irritated that we didn't know what we wanted to drink or if we wanted an appetizer.  I cracked the menu and reluctantly placed our order.  The speed of her first appearance was the only fast thing we got today.  Drinks took almost 10 minutes to arrive at our table.  The iced tea tasted old and stale and I had to ask our server twice for sweetener.  Another 10 minutes later our chips & salsa arrived.  The salsa bowl being barely half full and was gone before half the chips were gone.  Extra salsa would be addt'l so we opted out.  20 minutes later our order was taken and another 20 minutes later our food arrived.  I think the cook should go back in training.  Serving pasta that is still yellow and highly undercooked is a rookie mistake.  My sons pizza was burnt.  My husband's shrimp tacos had shrimp that could've been considered undercooked.  Drinks were empty for at least 10 minutes and when the refills arrived, so did the check.  For 3 adults & 1 kid, we paid $72 for LUNCH!  And it was crap food. I will not be going back to BJ's again.  I gave them 2 chances and both times have been well below par with the service being freaking awful.  Had the restaurant been busy when we went today, I'd given more stars... but our waitress had 4 small tables, so there is no excuse for her being MIA so often.  I think I'll be giving my business to other restaurants who value their customers."
Jody D.,"Aurora, CO",1,26,,4.0,2/9/2009,We are big fans of BJs.  It is one of our go-to restaurants in Aurora for sure.  BJs has a giagantic menu and is somewhat reasonably priced.  Also it has plenty of TVs including a full wall with multiple screens which makes it a good substitute location to watch a game.  Even though it is a chain restaurant it doesnt really feel like a Fridays or Chilis and for the most part the servers are quite nice and the service is good. Their happy hour deals are pretty good also.  Try the appetizer pizzas!
Severin A.,"Aurora, CO",0,15,,4.0,11/20/2011,"I went to BJ's for lunch the other day and I have to say that I am glad I found this place as it fits a particular need I have had for a place with a large menu, good food, somewhat upscale, yet fun environment, in the past to meet this need when I had family over I ended up either driving further than I would have preferred to go to Cheesecake Factory, or I would have went to a chain where the food is not as good, like TGI Fridays or Chili's. Discovering this place was great because I found my food to be good, I ordered the chicken parmigiana lunch and liked the spicy marinara sauce. The crispy coating on the chicken and the abundance of cheese on the chicken. I ordered the homemade rootbeer and it was very good. I cannot speak for the food that the others in my party ordered, but judging from the looks of it, their food was good as well. Our service was really good, and the waiter was prompt on the refills. This is definitely a place to go to when you have a group of picky eaters, due to the large accessible menu everyone should be able to find something they like. They even had a low calorie section in the menu with several meals under 575 calories. It is somewhere I will go back to since it is close to where I live and seems to fit a need for the area."
Sergio C.,"Woodinville, WA",15,30,1,4.0,6/19/2011,Good beer - great prices on happy hour.  Food is normal bar food.
