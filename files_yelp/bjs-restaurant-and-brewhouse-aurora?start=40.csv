Colleen R.,"Aurora, CO",20,17,,3.0,3/21/2017,Food was great. The service however was not.  Theresa...not very engaging and slow.  Didn't even check on us after we first got our food.  Isn't that waitressing 101??
Caleb D.,"Monument, CO",52,58,43,2.0,3/1/2017,"Food was fine once it finally came. Service was below mediocre, server had zero personality and urgency. Very disappointing."
Jeri C.,"Dillon, MT",0,14,10,5.0,9/19/2017,Stopped in to watch some football.  Super friendly staff & good specials during the game. Great place to stop by after shopping in this area.
Chelsea S.,"Thornton, CO",106,26,45,2.0,3/2/2017,"Terrible service... after rushing us through ordering, our server left us after the appetizer because her shift ended, then our next server left us before we even got a chance to order dessert... we were told that we would be getting another server but after 35 minutes of no one checking on us, we paid and left... food was good and good quality, but service was terrible... and this was on a Wednesday so it's not like it was a Saturday or something.... we won't be back despite the good being awesome"
Raven L.,"Aurora, CO",1,17,,2.0,6/9/2017,Pretty good food and large portions but the calamari was chewy and we couldn't finish it. Then the waiter kept bringing my daughter rootbeer floats which we assumed were free refills to find them added to the bill $4 each. Then when we were gonna order dessert we were handed the check. Not even asked if we wanted anything else. So we left and had dessert at home. Really overpriced. Will not go back.
John N.,"Tarrant, TX",72,57,3,3.0,2/8/2017,I usually like BJ's but this particular location gave me food poisoning. And the service was slooooow.
Cameron S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,2,,4.0,6/4/2017,Great food and even better beer!  Staff is friendly and spends an appropriate amount of time between checking on tables.  Also the pizzookie is an instant nap on a plate.
Crystal B.,"Denver, CO",389,10,11,2.0,6/21/2016,"Hate I had to wait at the door with a toddler for 5+ min with servers walking by, eye contact with the bartender and no recognition of existence :(  the place was maybe 1/3 full. I'd rather go to Yardhouse personally for dinner. It seems like they have been trying to cut food costs and lowered the quality. This coming from someone who use to go to BJ's all the time."
Dominique C.,"La Crosse, WI",0,7,,5.0,5/18/2017,Came here on Thursday and got the Rib special. Came with a salad and two sided and a Dessert cookie. I could be more full or more happy. I will be coming back Thanks !!
Kevin K.,"Alexandria, VA",4,56,36,5.0,6/15/2016,"I got the salmon and while i was pretty good, I think i would go for something else on the menu next time."
Russell C.,"Aurora, CO",11,148,10,5.0,7/25/2016,"This is a very interesting five stars.  First off, the service was great! Our server was very attentive and kind. We started with the appetizer sampler. I had the jambalaya as my meal. So, this is where it went wrong. Our meals came out before the app which wasn't good because the app was huge.  Our server noticed and apologized. We were a little disappointed because our meals were going to get cold before we finished the app.  Without us saying anything, the manager came over, apologized, and comped one meal and the appetizer. I was impressed at how they handled the situation.  I have never been treated with that much sincerity after a mix up. The food was awesome! I will definitely be back to get more jambalaya.  Their beer is excellent too. I highly recommend the PM Porter, it's so smooth. You get five stars because of the excellent food, awesome beer, great service, and the way you handled the situation.  I highly recommend coming here."
Britt C.,"Aurora, CO",0,37,,3.0,3/22/2017,"Their menu is good, and if youre lucky it will be good. They have a really hard time with consistency here. Sometimes the food comes out all wrong, or takes almost an hour. Service is very hit or miss also. But, they have nice deals during the week and a decent happy hour."
Cody J.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,10,1,1.0,11/8/2016,"Tables were dirty all around us.  Food was pretty good but the servers were on their cellphones.  Manager was sitting at the bar end watching tv and talking to servers.  She seemed very busy chatting. Not such a big deal but when one of them was my server and I didn't have silverware, it gets annoying.  Beer was good.  Just not very clean in the whole restaurant."
Chance H.,"Denver, CO",421,170,1840,1.0,8/28/2014,"Come to this bjs prob almost 1-2 a week for work lunches, take out & happy hour & it's always hit or miss with service :( one * for service & 4 * for the menu....for some reason in a small party we get not so good service & then in a lrg grp we get EXCELLENT service. Today, Thurs lunch, we sat in the bar for a party of 2 & received terrible service. Server did not check in on us, no utensils or napkins, was told he was bringing ketchup & we got NOTHING until our plates were mostly empty. Keep in mind we obviously needed utensils& napkins we had WINGS, salad, fries, bison burgers & sandwiches... It was my friends 1st time and not a great exp.  I tried to get the servers attention probably almost 5x... I never write neg. reviews but was disappointed in the service :("
Camille H.,"Denver, CO",99,151,20,3.0,12/14/2016,"Went here a week ago for my hubbys work holiday dinner. It looked like they had a more ""private area"" in a different section of the restaurant but we were all on one long table (multiple tables pushed together to form one long table) so you couldn't really converse with anyone that was 3 chairs down from you. We were all able to order what we'd like from the menu which was nice. I choose poorly on my dish. It was the parmesan crusted chicken and potatoes with broccoli. The potatoes were the best part of the dish. The chicken was eh..had some weird flavored sauce on it which I just didn't like. my hubby had a yummy pasta dish, may  have been baked ziti. That was really tasty. And a few others had steaks. They looked delicious but getting them was a weird scenario. After the 2 people ordered their steaks, they were told they were all out of them about 10min later. They ask to change up the size of the steaks and prices(I think they asked for 2 7oz steaks for the price of the 14 or something of that nature), and the server went to ask a manager and then miraculously, they had the original sized steaks. It was just odd. But their steaks were very good they said in the end. They didn't really clear away plates and glasses, we had our appetizer plates still sitting on our table when we left.. other than that it was pretty good. Will be back sometime to try a different entrée!"
Curt K.,"Aurora, CO",0,43,,4.0,2/6/2017,had a nice lunch a couple of times- In the past had a watermelon salad that was so good.  This time did the lunch menu.  had a dish that was a southern chicken on a bed of potato with corn and gravy.  Very tasty  and a step up from the sanders version of a chicken bowl.  Added a garden salad to it which was a decent salad.  I did try the salsa and chips- I liked the salsa a little different flavor than you would expect in a Mexican restaurant but I liked it.  The chips were freshly fried or heated.  A nice lunch.
Jon G.,"Aurora, CO",27,18,5,5.0,5/8/2016,"Never been until just a couple of days ago.  Service. Awesome, friendly and attentive.  Looks of the place. Really clean, warm and inviting.  Beer. House wheat beer, great flavor, not the best I've had, yet not the worse.  Food. Had the steak, cooked perfect and great flavor. The tomato and mozzarella salad, was really nice. The white cheddar mashed potatoes were the BEST I've ever had.  The Pizookie. Had the trio and the white chocolate and macadamia nut one won it for me hands down.  Looking forward to the next visit for sure."
Sandman L.,"Oakland, CA",30,57,7,4.0,12/20/2016,"You know what you're getting here, large portions highly salty food. That was the only downside was the food was too salty. I had the seafood jambalaya one day and had the steak the day before. Sat at the bar to watch all the games the bartender was great can't remember her name but she switched the channels when it was necessary. Drinks are priced fairly also they have a wide selection of beer if you prefer. Great value for your money."
Jennie D.,"Aurora, CO",4,14,1,1.0,1/22/2017,We love coming here but tonight the service was terrible. I don't know if they were short staffed or what but we felt blatantly ignored. Unfortunately our server didn't try to be anything but mediocre
Toni D.,"Orlando, FL",607,534,615,2.0,4/18/2014,"Service was terrible! The waitress took forever with everything. I honestly think she forgot about our table for a while. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken And The wedge salad were both delicious. Also, there's a coupon on the website if you spend $20 save $5."
