Bev C.,"Syracuse, NY",24,118,107,5.0,9/18/2015,6 of us enjoy ran early Friday evening out at BJs.  The avocado egg rolls were delicious: creamy and with a nice spicy bite. The Brussel sprouts were roasted to perfection - a nice size portion for 2 people. Flat bread pizza appetizers were way too big for one person.  We enjoyed beers around and the pumpkin peach had a good pumpkin flavor: good enough for a glass but maybe too much for 2.  All in all this was a good place for happy hour. We'll go again!
Joanne E.,"Aurora, CO",41,140,456,2.0,3/19/2016,"For some crazy reason I thought they could make a decent fish and chips. Nope. They have to go and ""personalize"" it with some type of tartar sauce that ain't.  The fish was over cooked in thick batter and was greasy greasy greasy. Why they can't just leave the whole fish in one piece is beyond me. Almost everywhere I've been in the states tends to have fish pieces cut up into little chunks. Bleh. Hubbs had the clam chowder which was more potato than clams. Not overly excited to return."
Charles P.,"Aurora, CO",17,35,5,4.0,12/22/2016,All and all good service and food tons of stuff to try having a 25 page menu. Lots of craft beer and harder drinks.
Kelcee W.,"Sterling, CO",42,11,1,5.0,1/11/2017,"Came here with my boyfriend and had a more than perfect dinner. Appetizer was out super quick, drinks were perfect, and our food was out in a timely manner. We were told about the  mobile app and downloading it got us a free pizookie and a discount on an entree  Our waiter was Dawan Cushinberry. Very attentive,  always kept a smile on his face.  We were absolutely  impressed!!!"
Kaitlyn E.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",299,26,89,5.0,9/16/2016,"Food was excellent! We had the stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer and that were so full of flavor! I also had the Mediterranean chicken pita, which was delicious!!!! Our server, Jeremy was by far one of the best servers we have had! He was very attentive and full of personality!"
Sonja A.,"Aurora, CO",126,272,598,5.0,7/20/2015,"My son and I love this place.  New food and drink menu items (Hickory BBQ Burger).....totally yummy!  Oh, and the Salted Caramel Pazookie....it's da bomb!  Share it in a Pazookie Trio for sure."
Alex R.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,2,,2.0,1/7/2017,"Howdy, This was the first time my brother, mom, and I went to Bjs.  I ate at a BJs in Jacksonville and had a great meal there.  Needless to say, i hyped it a bit.  That being said, my mom ordered the penne shrimp and asparagus and my brother ordered the ribeye with broccoli and mashed potatoes.  They were both displeased with the quality of the food they received.  The sauce for the shrimp was watery and underseasoned.  My brother complained that you couldn't taste the steak. However, you could taste thr char on it..  The service was good.  The waitress smiled and was attentive to us, coming around filling our glasses routinely."
Samantha G.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,4,3,5.0,9/15/2016,I love the pizza from BJ'S I always get the gourmet 5 meat and a berry burst cider or the Jeremiah red. Best pizza you can get for a sit down restaurant. I highly recommend trying the 5 meat  pizza with a side of parmesan cheese you won't regret it!
Sally H.,"Aurora, CO",126,102,281,3.0,4/14/2015,"I love how this place is open late and close to home.  My boyfriend and I always end up here if all other restaurants near by are closed.  Service here is always good and they have a large menu to choose from.  It can get overwhelming because the pictures looks so good and we want to order everything.  However, the items can be a hit or miss.   This last time we ordered the New Orleans jambalaya, chicken wings, the salted caramel pizookie, and a few alcoholic drinks.  They have a great selection of beers, ciders, and wine.  The jambalaya was pretty good, but it was definitely too much for me to eat.  My boyfriend loves chicken wings and these were just okay.  The pizookie, however, was divine.  It was definitely sweet, but the vanilla bean ice cream cuts the sweetness.  Another time, we had ordered the s'mores pizookie.  That was amazing as well.  I think next time we will just come here for their dessert.  We are dying to try their beignet."
Kathryn T.,"Colorado Springs, CO",22,3,,5.0,8/9/2016,"Stopped by this restaurant last night for a late dinner and was not disappointed!! We were greeted by a friendly host, wound up sitting in the cocktail area and our server was on top of every detail of our dining experience. Always topping off our drinks, food came out flawlessly, despite the late hour. All of the employees throughout the restaurant were working hard, staying busy getting done what they needed to. It was refreshing to see such a well organized work environment. What really caught our attention though was that the manager on staff, Burt, took time out of his evening duties to greet our table and make sure our dinner was going well. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and we'll be back for more soon!"
Brooke F.,"Aurora, CO",0,4,5,5.0,12/17/2016,"We order from BJ's through GrubHub. Never have been to the restaurant itself, but every single time we order from here, the food is SO good! Brussel sprouts, parm crusted chix, pizookies- everything we have tried, we have loved. Worth the $$ to just order & enjoy at home!"
Fred F.,"Centennial, CO",13,113,98,3.0,10/7/2016,"Well this is one of those times  you wish yelp had 1/2 stars.  Dinner was really 2 1/2 stars.  I ordered the full rack of ribs and they were ok but could have used some sauce.  I ordered the tomato  bisque  soup as one of my side dishes. It came late as they were making it I was told but it was barely  warm.  My friend  ordered the sirloin  steak which came as an oddly shaped steak  with no grill marks and was very small.  His grilled  asparagus  looked like it had been grilled yesterday, if you are going to grill asparagus it cannot be as thin as a pretzel, it was shriveled  up to nothing.  Service  was ok but nothing  great.  No real reason to go back we had 2 appetizers  mushrooms  ok and calamari  so so bill would have been just about 60 bucks if not for the 2 for 1 coupon.  2 appetizers  2 entrees and 2 ice teas the meal was not worth the cost.  There are plenty of other places we could have gone and probably  will not bother going back coupon  or not."
Loreen G.,"Aurora, CO",75,22,,2.0,8/27/2016,"To start with the positive, the bartender Brittany is so nice and responsive. She has a great sense of customer service. To move on with my review, I ordered the hot ham and cheese sandwich and it was not hot ...at all...even though I sent it back once. It came back just as cold the 2nd time. I'm not one to send food back as I can generally make anything work, but even the cheese on this sandwich was still cold and unmelted. To be fair, Brittany continued to be awesome and did not charge me for the sandwich, but I certainly don't know if management here knew or cared. My two stars is for the food....maybe the menu is just too extensive for any one thing to be really good, but the customer service from the bartender was great!"
Benjamin F.,"Aurora, CO",17,41,112,2.0,7/8/2015,"The food is pretty poor here. Was with friends and tried a little bit of everything. The top sir loin was like a kids cuisine microwave dish. It was dry, gross, and ridiculously small. The only thing that I would recommend from this place was a the mixed drink they had called ""A Drink like that"" and the sliders. Everything else is was pretty bad and overpriced. The drinks we had were the Jeremiah Red, the PM Porter, The Dark Side of the Moom, and a Drink like that. To be fair, I visit an excessive amount of local brewries and craft beers can be hit or miss. But these beers here were bellow par. If your just looking to try something different and don't care much for taste or quality this is place to go. If I was tell you why the  Jeremiah  Red and PM Porter were bad I would simply say the yeast had not been properly fermented at the right temperature. It was excessively bitter and the red ale I had here before did not have that level of bitterness. The food we ordered was the parmessan chicken, top sirloin, stuffed mushrooms, avocado egg rolls, double chocolate pzookie, and sliders. The egg roll and mushroom appetizers had almost identical fillings. The stuffed mushrooms were clearly the better of two but as you can see from the images many of the egg roll and mushroom appz were overcooked and even blackened at some points. With that said I still enjoyed most of the appz. I just wished it was prepared with a bit more care. I ordered the sliders at the same time I ordered desert simply because I saw multiple people order it and I wanted to actually try a meal that tasteted good before I left. The pzookie was advertised as a American Classic was actually good and the sliderd were great tasting and only $8.95. They were actually cheaper than the egg roll appetizer. The cost just did not come close to the quality for the majority of the things we were served."
Jen M.,"Southeast, Denver, CO",4,51,206,3.0,1/28/2015,"I hate to give bad reviews..... But I have zero patience when I have to wait 15 minutes to even be acknowledged by our server.  There were hardly any tables and we were hardly there at a busy time.... 3:00pm Couldn't get refills, forgot parts of our order. I am not going to be in a hurry to return . It's more expensive than it's worth"
Kat M.,"Preston, Australia",16,9,,4.0,2/19/2016,"I come here mainly for dessert; I must confess I'm in love with the s'mores pizookie, but have yet to eat an entire one in one sitting!  I also quite enjoy their watermelon basil margaritas right now, and I always order the stuffed mushrooms as well! Prices are decent - I do usually feel like I've spent more than I wanted to, but then I remember that that's because my eyes got bigger than my stomach... Service seems attentive and kind whenever I go -  I do tend not to go during busy times, but the one time I did go during dinner, service was still great!"
M K.,"Aurora, CO",3,82,2,3.0,7/12/2016,"Wife and I come to BJ's probably every other month or so. Service is pretty good but they have a bad habit of bringing out the appetizer with the meal, or in our case yesterday, AFTER our entrees were served. Food is hit and miss as well. Tavern style pizza are overpriced for what you get. Everything here is hit or miss. Sometimes we have great food and service, other times its lackluster. Great homecrafted rootbeer though!"
Michael P.,"Aurora, CO",104,389,21,4.0,1/21/2015,"Great place to take a group of friends to eat!  This BJ's location has great staff who do an excellent job making you feel welcome.   The Cheeseburger here is the reason that I come...always cooked the way I like it. Great selection of drinks/spirits, but the desert cookie has been overcooked the past 2 times that I have been.  Overall, very solid!"
Bryan E.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,5,1,5.0,6/27/2016,Ok. So I brought in 15 people at 10pm for Pazookie. I know...good decision right? They were very friendly and seated us immediately. The Pazookie was incredible and the service was great. Would come back if I ever visit the Denver area again.
Anna Z.,"San Jose, CA",531,342,675,4.0,1/11/2015,"Four stars for the pizookie! Three stars for the food. But this review is for all the times I go after dinner for some delicious pizookie:) This BJ is very spacious. It has a large area with multiple compartments for dining and a large bar area with tall tables for those who just want a beer. I like to come with my boyfriend after dinner for some dessert. We walk right in since the bar area doesn't require you to wait to be seated and we just walk in a grab a table. Waiters and waitresses usually come very quickly with menus and ask us what we want to drink. The happy hour doesn't start until 10pm so usually when we go it's too early but we get a beer anyways. My boyfriend always gets the Jeremiah red which is a dark strong beer and I get something fruity and light. The apricot ale is pretty good. And of course we get a single chocolate chunk pizookie which is this warm chocolate chip cookie topped with French vanilla ice cream. It's a heavenly mix of sweetness and both warm soft cookie with the chilling pairing if the ice cream. This is definitely one of my favorite desserts on earth!:) Pizookie also comes in a flight form with three smaller pizookies so if you wanted to try more flavors, get the flight! But I'm very happy with my chocolate chunk. It's a good amount for two people without feeling overwhelmingly sweet and stuffed."
