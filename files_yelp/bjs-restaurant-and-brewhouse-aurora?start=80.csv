Josh M.,"Denver, CO",124,136,3,2.0,12/31/2015,I came here with a friend when our pho joint nearby was closed. The service was good. The menu reminds me of the cheesecake factory since there's so many items on it. I tried two items. The appetizer combo was hit and miss. The Santa Fe spring rolls were good and tasty. The same goes for the spinach and artichoke dip. The mozzarella sticks were room temperature and not melted at all. The avocado rolls got a little soggy. The seared ahi salad was okay. The rice wine vinaigrette was very acidic. Everything else was good about the salad.
Taylor J.,"Aurora, CO",0,17,4,1.0,3/11/2017,Until they bring back the red velvet pazookie I will refuse to go here and so will all of my friends. That was the best dessert and now we feel robbed of our satisfaction. BRING BACK THE RED VELVET PAZOOKIE IT CANT BE THAT HARD
Denise R.,"Aurora, CO",650,491,905,1.0,6/26/2015,All I can say is horrible horrible horrible horrible service big time I don't know if I seen one happy table in the place not to mention after I ate I didn't feel so good maybe it was because they gave our food to the next table over and then came and brought it to us ughhhhhh
Melody T.,"Aurora, CO",62,7,,3.0,2/12/2017,"I had an average experience here. Although this wasn't the first time I went to this location I have come back because the food will fill your belly and excite your taste buds! Two of my girlfriends and I walked in about 5pm on a Saturday night and were not greeted, the hostess just stared at us for a while. Finally (only really a couple minutes) she greeted us and asked how many, but we were not given the option of booth or table. We were given a booth in between two parties (one which was very loud, we couldn't even have our own conversation). Our waiter looked busy but he did let us know were are not forgotten about and that he would be right with us for our drinks. Although he seemed tired and overworked he did his best to connect with us and make our time enjoyable. After a while of waiting for our food we noticed people that had ordered after us were almost done with their dinner. About an hour of having to wait for our food we were finally told the reason it was taking so long is that to chefs burned the burger. Whether that be the truth or not I feel as if we should have been offered at least complimentary drinks for us for the long wait. No compensation was given, and no apology just an excuse."
Curtis H.,"Denver, CO",43,250,301,4.0,9/25/2015,"Decided to have lunch at BJ's with my father, prices were a little high for lunch but we decided to go anyway. My father got the all you can eat soup and salad and ordered the shrimp scampi pasta. My father raved about how great the clam chowder was...I gave it a shot too and I would say it was pretty good.  My shrimp pasta was really good and was loaded with fresh shrimp. However, the pasta needed more salt, I get the need to lower sodium, but this needed more. I'm sure I  will return with my wife, very soon."
Tait L.,"San Diego, CA",9,81,157,5.0,7/6/2015,"Out in Denver Colorado on business and stopped at BJ's. It was on a Monday so... Not really busy. Eat at the bar. Quick service. Good beer and food. Had the jambalaya. It's very good. I am probably not the best person to judge jambalaya tho, (raised in socal) Enjoyed the Jeremiah Red and the seasonal IPA. Thank you Shaina. Well done."
Jack K.,"Denver, CO",141,152,13,4.0,5/15/2014,"This was my second time visiting a BJ's Restaurant. The first time I visited was at a BJ's on the way to Boulder from Denver, and I almost swore them off for life due to terrible service, but that's old news.  My experience at this BJ's was quite different, and the bartender, whose name I cannot remember now, deserves to be running the place. I had just got back from Chicago on Monday evening May 5th. I hadn't eaten dinner yet, and this was one of the only places open in the area.  The food is some of the best I've ever had at a chain restaurant like this, and they had a happy hour going that made drinks and food nice and cheap. The highlight of the evening however, as I already mentioned, was the bartender. She was the exact opposite of the staff at the last BJs I went to. She was funny, she sparked some conversation without being overzealous, it was the end of the day and she still had a smile on her face. It may not seem like much to some, but that is all I ask of someone serving me, and it never ceases to amaze me how many servers screw it up.  Anyway, we came in and sat at the bar right before they stopped serving food. She got us our food quickly, stayed on top of our drinks (alcohol and water), and compelled me to give this particular BJs a good review. Kudos to you nighttime bartender on May 5th!"
David K.,"Aurora, CO",13,7,5,5.0,11/21/2015,I love this restaurant. The food is tasty and i love the ambiance of the room. Definitely coming back for the Pizookie! That dessert is a bomb.
John J.,"Northwest, Denver, CO",50,225,19,5.0,5/19/2015,"We went to bjs due to the recommendation of an out of town friend and the food network showing Chicago style pizza. Pretty cool place.  Open but once seated feels like any other restaurant.  Our server Shane quickly greeted us and got us some drinks.  He also answered any of our questions and was very patient until we were ready to order.   Beer was good, I ordered a Dales and he also brought along a sample of their pale ale... I should have just mustered up and ordered that in the first place.  It was delicious!  I only ate about a slice of my pizza because I was not very hungry and Shane made sure that everything was okay and that I enjoyed my pizza, which I did. Good pizza, good beer and great service... We will definitely be back for a deep dish!"
Morgan M.,"Denver, CO",182,251,2071,2.0,7/12/2015,"Haven't been to BJ's in years and wanted to go to something different well that was a mistake. We went at 11:15 and the restaurant was pretty dead only a couple tables filled. We got sat right away and didn't have a waiter for 5 minutes . Our waiter finally arrived and we greeted him ""hi how are you ?"" And he replies "" dead tired and only here because I really want money"" ! Okay that was the first issue : the negativity . Next we ordered drinks and food right away and it took another 5-7 minutes to receive our drinks. The ice tea came with 4 cubes of ice and was lukewarm melting the ice in the cup. More like room temperature tea. Our appetizer came out pretty prompt, it was the avocado egg rolls but no plates to share with our party of 4. The avocado egg rolls were subpar and kind of spicy. Our food soon came out yet our server never returned. He never asked how our food was or checked up on us, or even asked if we needed anything else ! One of our friends had the Ahi Tuna Salad and said it was decent, another friend had the chicken finger salad and liked it , my mom had the California Chicken Club and liked it , unfortunately my salad was horrible. It was the Berry Brussel sprout  kale salad. The Brussel sprouts were hard and cold not roasted like they said in the description. The Arugula, kale, spinach mix was soggy in the berry dressing. Little amount of nuts and grapes. Would never get again ! Finally after our waiter came back he refilled the tea with no ice of course and was like maybe I should clear these plates. He asked if a friend wanted to box the rest of her salad she said no and he starred at her and looked at our other friend and was just like fine whatever . Rude rude rude and just all around negative. Not only was service horrible and slow but food was just not that good and the waiter was rude. Would defiantly not recommend it ."
Dee S.,"Aurora, CO",3,202,11,1.0,8/6/2016,"Don't order online for pickup.  I ordered the Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad.  The lettuce was brown.  There was no almonds or hard boiled eggs.  Also, they don't provide dressing even though the salad was advertised as  ""tossed with honey mustard dressing"".    The sticker on the to-go container said 'no honey mustard' but there was no place online to opt-in or opt-out for dressing.  I could understand if they have a bug in their online software but the quality of the salad was terrible."
Cecile L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",65,39,7,4.0,5/6/2016,Good food but nothing exceptional... Service is always good with a wonderful selection of beer.
Alan N.,"Oklahoma City, OK",173,513,300,5.0,6/23/2015,"Good place to grab lunch, huge menu selection and lots of beers (obviously). The staff is very friendly and attentive, clean place and decently priced. Plenty of TVs at the bar for sports and TVs around the whole restaurant. I typically get burgers here which are really good, and it's pretty conveniently located with plenty of parking."
Andrew B.,"San Mateo, CA",1,215,12,3.0,6/23/2016,"Inconsistent and poor attention to detail. Mixed up entrees and iffy service.  Great if they are on their game, but its a 50/50 shot."
Darin B.,"Aurora, CO",1,100,101,5.0,9/10/2015,I have never had a problem when eating here! Prices are fair! Food is great! The menu is large many choices to pick from. Mahi-mahi grilled tacos are my favorite! Service is great! I don't have anything bad to say about this restaurant. Chicken wings are also great and spicy if that's what you like!
Denise G.,"Aurora, CO",149,295,269,4.0,5/28/2015,"BJ's is a great place for a variety of food choices.  They have a great menu with a ton of choices. I was feeling fish this time and went with the mahi mahi over pineapple fried rice. We also went with some appetizers, since they were on happy hour. The mozzarella and tomato salad was good except it had too many onions.  They were over powering. The flat bread was okay, but a little bland. The crispy fried artichokes were awesome and seasoned well.  I loved the mahi on the rice.  It had just enough flavor to not overwhelm the whole dish. The service was great. The bartender was active and on top of the whole bar's drinks and food orders. We will be back and continue to try more options on the large menu."
Margie D.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",0,86,12,5.0,4/22/2016,"I love this restaurant.  I'm 45 minutes away so I can't frequent every week (wish I could).  They are consistent with the quality of food and love their home brewed Jerimiah Red beer.  7.5% Alcohol and it is delicious!  usually the higher the Alcohol, the bitter it is, but not with this one.  I'm mad that I can't find anything like it someplace else.  Food is good, beer is good."
Srizzle C.,"North Liberty, IA",0,16,,1.0,9/22/2015,"Nope. I have been twice, today we attempted to give them a second chance. Items ordered: honey crisp salad, avocado egg rolls, pepperoni pizza, kids corn dogs. The only meal that was any good? The corn dogs. Salad ( we also had side salads) had bad lettuce, missing components and just generally lacked flavor. The pizza didn't have pepperoni. Egg rolls were way over spiced, and just tasted awful. Wait staff wasn't that great either.  This trip was supposed to be a redeemer for BJ's, as our trip two weeks ago had the same kind of food and experience. I waited to write a review, wanting to be fair. Sorry BJ's, you don't get a third chance to make an impression."
Sasha S.,"Aurora, CO",51,24,,3.0,4/27/2016,"BJ'S makes it seem like gluten free is easy and super safe. They talk about separate sides of the kitchen and trained staff. Except, the staff knowledge is hit or miss. The food quality is inconsistent at best as is the cleanliness of the dining area. I'd rather not take the risk here anymore. It's not worth it. Also, if you're a celiac, DON'T get ""To-Go"" here...they can't make it GF!"
Paris V.,"Denver, CO",51,53,20,5.0,6/10/2015,"I love coming here, my waitress Sholay makes the best recommendations. The mozzarella salad I didn't even know you had and I don't even think about coffee at a place like this but it was exactly what I wanted. Sholay was on top of everything, even when it got super busy our drinks were always full and we got excellent service. She also recommend the salmon which was super amazing, with her I would probably still be eating the same sandwich over and over. It's great to have a waitress who knows the food."
