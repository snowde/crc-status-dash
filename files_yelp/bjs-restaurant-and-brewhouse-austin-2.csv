Sabryna S.,"Austin, TX",297,27,78,4.0,11/7/2017,"Great food! Good service!  To start, we were seated very quickly. The waiter was very attentive! Although, we did have a miscommunication. We were under the impression that the half off pizza special included all the pizzas, but it turns out it was only if you ordered a large. So in that sense there could have been more clarity when we were placing our orders because the small ended up being more expensive than if I got the large. But, it's all good.  The pizza was delicious!! It came fresh out of the oven with the perfect amount of pepperonis in place. If deep dish is your thing, BJ's is the place. It was also my friend's birthday so they brought out a mini pizooki for him. I had a few bites and it was the perfect finish to my meal. Warm, chocolately chip goodness all topped off with a scoop of creamy, vanilla ice cream. Yummmm."
Bill B.,"Houston, TX",0,18,2,3.0,10/8/2017,"This is a takeout review. Ordered two pizookies as part of the special $3 promo. Not sure if it's the promotion or that o requested take out, but wow the quality has gone down massively!  When I first saw the containers, I questioned the quantity since it looked much smaller. I even asked to make sure it wasn't a mini. I was assured it was a normal sized pizookie.  When I got home, I was disappointed. Since it was only $3 per pizookie, it didn't feel bad but I was upset since I was expecting something good. The cookie barely even filled up half of the plate, and I definitely didn't receive more than one scoop of ice cream. Maybe two small scoops.  Again, I think it was probably because I had takeout, and the special promo. They need to cut corners somewhere to still get some money at the end of the day. I get that, but just charge $5 per pizookie then, and give us what we expect.  Definitely disappointed, and probably will avoid coming here for a while."
Ling C.,"Austin, TX",85,102,340,3.0,8/4/2017,"I love BJ's, I come here often, especial this location, sometimes 3, 4 times a week. We have our favorite waiter and waitress and we memorize their happy hours and I can honestly say there is nothing I have not tried on the menu. While the seasoning on the food are usually on the salty side for me, I still think they are pretty tasty. I'm only giving it 3 stars because the experiences I had this past week.  They sometimes have really good deal on the weekdays, but the waitress did not inform us the extra charge on some of sides while ordering the deal of the day, and of course I wasn't aware of it till I got the receipt. The other time I was charged extra for one of the sides. Kudos to the manager, the first time I called and complained about the issue, I was well taken care off immediately. Nevertheless, having to double check the receipt twice (and happened in the same week) was pretty annoying. We even joke about if we would go to our favorite scam restaurant for the dinner now.  This was where I used to celebrate birthdays at, but not anymore."
Jay N.,"Roosevelt, NY",48,324,1950,4.0,1/8/2018,"Luv this place great selection of both craft beer great pizza,sandwiches and burgers.always a good atmosphere and courteous,professional service.                      Back again love this place large variety of craft beers tonight we're doing salads The super kale salad with grilled salmon and the seared Ahi tuna salad .Two great craft beers the BJ's brewhouse Blondie and the BJ's Jeremiah Red.                                            Still one of the best places for late night eating and drinking or just to chill watching the national college football championships Always great service and great food(Pizza great craft beers)"
Jody W.,"Gansevoort, NY",135,643,1575,4.0,8/3/2017,"Family took me here last night for dinner. I learned that BJ's is a western-state chain that originated in California. The big draw was that have their own beers.....so I was down for trying some new brews. The menu is extensive and it's pretty hard to choose! (Hey! That rhymed!) Lots of heavier fare that are calorie-laden but they also have lighter choices. I opted for the thin crust pizza with pineapple and jalapeño. The thin crust version is new to the menu and there are only a few choices - one was with bacon,ham, pineapple and jalapeño...I just asked to hold the meat on that one. Came out light, crispy, savory and a little sweet/tart/hot with the pineapple and jalapeño. We started by sharing the brussels sprouts - served crispy with a creamy sriracha sauce. Yum. My dining companions had the loaded burger and the chicken parmesan. Fries are really good. (I stole several). Dark beers all around - I had the bourbon barrel stout...delicious and strong. Nope...wasn't driving. Yep - had two. Almost forgot about the dessert! Maybe it's because I was in a beer/food-coma after this meal. We ordered 3 ""mini"" pizookies (get it? pizza and cookie makes a new word...): 1 monkey bread, one triple chocolate and one salted caramel. All were super sweet, decadent and....like I said...coma inducing. High calorie treat for sure but if you're going for it...go for it. They have ""regular"" sized pizookies as well.  The restaurant is clean, large, loud and the food was good. Would definitely go to BJ's again."
Morgann H.,"Houston, TX",126,11,344,5.0,11/19/2017,My favorite Bj's location in Austin by far! Their welcome and hospitality is so warm. They have some of the friendliest staff and are very accommodating. My last waitress was MARLEY!  She was so sweet and just a blessing. Her genuine service made myself and boyfriend loyal. Always great food and a great time when we come here.
Steban D.,"Pflugerville, TX",17,73,15,4.0,6/21/2017,"I really enjoy BJ's They have a large menu so there is a lot to pick from and can sometimes be hard for me to make a decision, to many options. The burgers are solid, and they come with the little thin cut crispy fries that i like.   I have tried their deep dish pizzas and their flat bread pizzas.  It's definitely not Chicago style deep dish but it is good.  The flat breads are very filling.  I'm a big boy and i usually leave a piece or two behind. The salads are huge and very filling.  They have a seared Ahi salad that was delicious.  I am normally not big on desert because i am usually full from my meal but their Pizookie are awesome! Basically they are like a big warm cookie with a scoop of ice cream.  They have a monkey bread pizookie that i have been wanting to try. They also have a really good beer that they make in house.  I like the Brew house blonde, harvest Hefeweizen, and the Nutty Brewnette.  Really good beers!"
Stephanie A.,"Austin, TX",44,161,1262,4.0,12/7/2016,"We have been to BJ's a few times.  This was our first visit to this location.  We fell in love with BJ's a while back because of the beer selections, happy hour, food, and customer service. This trip did not disappoint us at all.  We left happy and satisfied with our visit. For our drinks, my husband ordered a pint of the Grand Cru, a holiday Craft Beer.  He was not a big fan, but I loved it!  I ordered the the BJ's Irish Rootbeer, which includes hand crafted root beer, Jameson's Irish Whiskey, Baileys Irish Cream, and Butterscotch schnapps.  This was absolutely delicious, the only change I would make is a bit more whiskey and schnapps.  I tasted everything else but these two ingredients and both should have been noticeable in the drink if the correct amount was added.  For our meal, my husband ordered the Derby-Style Chicken Cobb salad.  He absolutely adored it.  This is December, and the freshness and quality of the vegetables were amazingly on point. The avocado tasted of a freshly picked one from Summer time, no bruises on it at all.  He loved this salad and ate it all up. I ordered the North Beach Mahi & Shrimp entree.   I am normally not a huge tomato based food kind of fan - heartburn and all....but this dish was sooo delicious and fresh - I would order it again in a heartbeat.  The mahi mahi was super fresh and this fish is just like a steak of the seas- very meaty and hearty.  The flavors were so well blended. The shrimp was spot on delicious. The dish had a saltiness but not salty - more like a briney flavor that hits your taste buds and makes them tingle with happiness.  Of course I had to keep pushing my husbands fork away at his attempts to steal my food lol.  The only suggestion I would have is a few more shrimp, but it was the standard amount - especially for the price which was fairly decent considering the quality and quantity of the dish. Great customer service, excellent food, and fun drinks will always keep us coming back for more. Thank you!"
Jeff P.,"Austin, TX",0,39,,1.0,12/24/2017,Came here with the fam. on 12/23/2017 at around 10pm.... OMG! Just HORRIBLE service.... followed by GOD AWFUL food! It's just amazing how establishments like this can even survive in a place with great food like Austin. But what stands out the most is the absolute horrendous service. We wanted to leave $0 for a tip bec. the waitress was so bad but bec. it was Christmas season we left $5 on a $120 bill Management was absent too.
Donovan S.,"Pflugerville, TX",179,111,62,4.0,5/22/2017,"I went to dinner here with a buddy and it was not very crowded.  It is a big, open restaurant with tall ceilings so it isn't very loud.  Our server was nice but a little slow and when we were ready to pay we couldn't find her so we had another waitress track her down with our checks.   The food here has always been really good for me.  I had their Peruvian shrimp quinoa bowl and it was delicious.  My friend had their guacamole bacon burger and he said it was ""awesome.""  Of course you could put guacamole and bacon on a flip-flop and it would taste good.  :-).  They have some really good beers they brew themselves.  Their Nutty Brewnette is a great American brown ale.  My friend had their hefeweizen, which I tried and it was good too.  They have an extensive menu and the service is usually good.  I'll be back, I've always enjoyed the food and their fried avocado rolls are AWESOME."
Ken R.,"Buda, TX",8,9,,5.0,12/21/2017,"Had an office dinner there last night.  Derrick was our server and we couldn't have asked for a better evening.  Service was exceptional and the questions we had were answered.  It is clear that Derrick is a true professional. Food, atmosphere, and service were outstanding.  Thank you for a great evening!"
Jim O.,"Austin, TX",8,218,16,3.0,4/30/2017,"This place has the usual fare. I nice setting and friendly staff but the food while, good was nothing special. I had the Cobb Salad and I must say it had a generous portion of chicken. The chocolate chip cookie with ice cream was a lot of sweet and not much notable flavor. Alas. Oh, I'd eat here again if I were in the neighborhood, but otherwise no."
Samuel C.,"Austin, TX",93,666,,4.0,2/2/2017,"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse gets no love in Austin. Some Yelpers hate it. The parking lot is deserted. In contrast, BJ's is THE place to be in College Station. The place is always packed. You park far away and walk in. The two establishments are near clones of each other - so the question is not good vs bad establishments in a chain. It is Austin vs Aggie World View. * On this particular question - I have to side with the Aggies. BJ's is a fine establishment. It is not perfect.  It is an eating establishment - and not a drinking establishment. Their homemade beers generally are awful.  (I recently ordered a Jeremiah Red, took two sips of it and sent it back to the bartender. Tasteless on first mouth contact - but with a bad aftertaste.  Talk about a bad combination of attributes.) Their selection of other beers and hard liquors is good but not magnificent. In Austin, which has the best funky bars of any city in a 1000 mile radius .... There are simply too many other awesome places near by for BJ's to be able to compete. In Bryan/College Station, BJ's stock runs higher from weaker competition. * But bar by bar comparisons miss the big picture here. BJ's has three gigantic points in its favor. 1) The room is beautiful. 2) The food is excellent. 3) For Chili's-style American places, BJ's has one of the healthiest menus around.  Good eye candy, good taste and a note from my doctor. With that combination, sign me up. * The room.  The architectural style is deliberately 1930's retro with better lighting.  This is particularly noticeable in the bathrooms - which are some of the best ever for a chain restaurant. But it applies throughout the establishment. Wainscoting. Frosted glass doors with old-style lettering. Brass accents. Walking in here feels like you are entering Sardi's or the Algonquin Hotel lunchroom. I am always happy when I arrive at a BJ's. * The food. BJ's runs a standard American chain bar and grill menu with more light items and more vegetables. You want quinoa? They got quinoa. They have many veggie sides and not just a few. They always have five or six different soups ranging from light and not caloric to loaded with the works.  And yeah -  they got burgers - lots of burgers - and wings and ribs and all the fun stuff we love, for when you need more than a portobello mushroom to keep you happy. Execution is excellent both on healthy stuff and fun stuff. I have been eating at BJ's (although not the Austin one) for years and have yet to get a bad dish. When I made my test run of the North Mopac BJ's, I intentionally ordered dishes I have had at the College Station BJ's. The preparation and final product were the same in both places - which meant I was quite happy with my food. * Now people have told me that they have had bad experiences at BJ's. Maybe there is a new manager now - and the old manager was terrible. Maybe I know too many fussy eaters -  although I doubt that since I hang with the most magnificent people in the universe. But the BJ's on North Mopac seems perfectly fine. For my money, BJ's is at the top of the chain American bar-and-grill establishment - and is still respectable when you add indie bar and grills into the comparison pool. Yeah, it is not better than the best of the best -  but it is as good if not better than much of the pack. Just don't drink their homemade beer."
Dd W.,"North Austin, Austin, TX",0,7,,4.0,12/27/2017,"Been there a few times.  Surprisingly large menu incl. lite dishes, good food, good beer selection.  Service is usually good.  It can be very loud, with multi TVs, music, conversations, etc., so not a good date-night place.  Recommended!"
Marissa P.,"Austin, TX",188,113,739,4.0,6/30/2016,"So apparently my boyfriend is a BIG fan of BJ'S brewhouse, he was very excited when he saw there were some here when we moved.  So obviously he insisted we go. The restaurant is very cute and clean, has a nice casual ambiance, good friendly and attentive service, and pretty delicious food and great beer. I had a blonde ale and my boyfriend got a flight with 4 beer samples, their prices for beer were VERY reasonable too, mine was only $4!! We were starving so we started with 2 apps, BBQ boneless wings and the fried artichokes. The BBQ sauce was delicious and the wings were really good, plus we got a LOT for the price. The artichokes were my favorite though, very good and different. For my entree I had Mediterranean chicken tacos and my boyfriend had the bison burger. He loved his burger and my tacos were amazing, I also loved the side grain salad that came with it!! Everything tasted very good and fresh, also the portions were good for the prices. I'm not usually a fan of chains but I was very pleased with our experience here, we'll be back I'm sure!"
Lisa T.,"Davis Spring, Austin, TX",30,2,,1.0,12/21/2017,"Worst service ever.  I tried to order online and through the app for curbside pickup.  Neither worked.  I called the restaurant four times and no one answered the phone.  So frustrating.  When I got to the restaurant to place my order there were 6 people ahead of me and I waited another 30 minutes just to order.  The person who took my order did not know how to use my points I wanted to redeem and called a manager to help.  I explained my situation and not one apology was offered by the manager.  The counter person told me it would be another 20 minutes for my order to be ready.  I explained that would be a total of one hour since I had tried to place the order.  In a snarky tone she said ""oh well, sorry.""  Never again will I come to this location.  Worst service ever.  It's not too much to ask to answer the phone.  Seriously.  Unbelievable.  And I'm a BJ's Premier member for many years."
Krista M.,"Saint Paul, MN",7,287,145,4.0,11/8/2016,"This restaurant is beautiful inside.  It was later on a Monday night so it was pretty empty.  I could easily see us coming here again (if they were in our area) and watching a game.  It felt warm, cozy, and very relaxed.  It was nice to see that not all TVs were not on football.  We watched a bit of arm wrestling which was surprisingly entertaining.  :) The menu is huge. Too big, really.  I was trying to decide between a burger, pasta, pizza or a steak.  Everything looked delicious.   They were out of the pumpkin beer, so my husband tried the Hopstorm IPA.  He also tried the Piranha IPA.  The Piranha was much better, much more hoppy. Their peach margarita was good.  The glass was full of ice which is why I probably don't drink much when we go out - I always feel I'm not getting my money's worth.  I loved the flavor and the peaches at the bottom of the glass but I should remember to stick to blended drinks.  I switched to a mug of their BJ's Root Beer and that was excellent. Frosty, cold mug...yum.  I'd buy that to bring home if I could.   The hickory brisket and bacon burger was excellent. I would have loved more brisket, but there was plenty of bacon and the BBQ sauce was really good.  The wedge fries were good, too. My husband enjoyed his vegetable penne.  The service was great and we will be back before we leave town!"
Rick O.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,1.0,5/24/2017,"I'm a regular customer at BJ's  and very rarely complain about service at restaurants but the service here basically sucked! After numerous mistakes by our server and lack of attention I went to the bar to get refills on beer and soft drinks. The prime rib was WELL DONE! Who cooks prime rib well done. The server argued about what we ordered after 3 people told her she was wrong.  The manager said she had an ""off night"" and came to our table and tried to soften the anger by joking about irrelevant inappropriate things then compted us for appetizers we didn't even order that was erroneously put on our bill. We are NEVER going to this location again Nd it had soured me from ever going to ANY BJ's"
Yamil C.,"Manor, TX",30,80,134,4.0,5/8/2017,I enjoyed my time at bj's this place rarely dissappoints. They are pretty consitent across their restaurants as multiple dishes i have had at other locations have identical flavors. My favorite appetizer is the calamari and it goes perfect with a cold house hefeweizen. I love this place will come back soon.
Andrea S.,"Austin, TX",24,1,,1.0,9/2/2017,The manager tonight his name was christian was really rude. I ordered a medium well steak it came out well done. Then i ordered a drink and a bug was in it. Then I ordered some wings and they gave me the wrong wings.  The Manager did not try to compensate me at all. I ended up not eating tonight. This was ridiculous
Camilla M.,"Houston, TX",88,59,525,4.0,5/14/2017,"We always enjoy our visit to BJ's.  The waitress was nice and helpful. It took a while for our food to come out, but maybe because we ordered a pizza. Restrooms were clean. Restaurant was clean except for a dead fly & dust on the ledge by our table (right next to the lamp) The closing transaction went smooth. Would go again."
Jana N.,"Austin, TX",124,365,95,4.0,1/20/2016,I'm still not a fan of chains.  The apps were nice and the selection of drinks is great.  I am not a huge fan of the food. The avocado on the tuna thing was tasty.  The queso was great!  Do you want to know the best thing? I thought so.  Our server in the bar area was Jamison.  Now that is a great idea for hiring a great employee -- attentiveness and Jamison. Thanks for your help.
Lis F.,"Austin, TX",3,72,18,3.0,3/28/2017,"Wow what can I saw the fish tacos, tasted just like my husbands ex-mil Jans! She was from the great state of Nebraska. So she knows her seafood and I have always loved her shrimp salad (extra mayo!) you need to see her whole decorated salmon. So I got the tacos thinkin meh, they might be decent but man! They were just like Jan's!"
Jim S.,"Marion, IA",0,2,,5.0,11/27/2017,"This is one of the best restaurants I've been to in all 50 of the state's.  We were seated immediately, and our waitress was extremely helpful and friendly.  The atmosphere was casual,  several tv's going at once but we were still able to have a normal conversation.  Their menu had several choices, and and it hard for us to decide what to order.   My wife ordered the bread bowl clam chowder,  and spinich salad.  I had a bowl of broccoli cheese soup and a brisquit bacon burger.  The food was fantastic, and very reasonably priced.   Would highly recommend you stop and eat here if you are in the area."
Andy B.,"Oltorf/East Riverside, Austin, TX",0,7,,5.0,11/10/2017,I stopped by during a shopping excursion because I honestly needed a break and a cold beer! I sat at the bar and Joshua the bar tender was fantastic! his knowledge of beers and spirits was superb and he helped to guide me to there Jeremiah Red (which I highly recommend). His service and attention to detail was above and beyond what I generally have received in the area. Hats off to Joshua for making my experience great with good conversation and spectacular service. I will definitely be back to see him again!
Daniel A.,"Ingleside, TX",11,7,3,1.0,8/17/2017,Friends you know usually I love the places I go the things we share together tonight I say this is the second worst experience  my girlfriend and I have had to date forget this bj's the service sucked assholes and the manager defending the shitty ass service we got. I think I have been in member service for far to long for this in any way to be acceptable in any way. They get drinks all around us we got ignored great.
Greg G.,"Austin, TX",30,29,,5.0,8/21/2017,"We have been going here for years for 3 reasons;  great food, great beer, and outstanding customer service. We have never had a bad experience here. Nothing much to say, other than, go see for yourself. BJ'S is on our regular rotation."
M. O.,"Overland Park, KS",80,174,292,4.0,11/9/2016,"My buddy and I are big fans of BJ's.   Restaurants!  Keep you head out of the gutter! Each time we visit the Austin area, we head over to the closest location to make sure we do at least one round of BJ's before heading home.   The chain is in the same vein as Granite City, where you have a nice, slightly upscale bar-and-grill approach to the dining room. The food is uber-solid for the genre, and the beer here is super easy to drink across the entire line.  No matter your preference, you'll find a very approachable brew with your name on it.   This time around, I went for the whiskey barrel aged porter, and was not disappointed.  Is it A+ beer?  Negative.  However, it's a solid, passable B all day long, and that's pretty good for a chain bar and grill. I've tried a good swath of the food on the menu as well.  Among my favorites is the pizza. But, the thing that will keep you coming back is the Pizookie.  Goofy in name but dead-serious in flavor, this has to be one of my favorite desserts, anywhere.  It's a fresh-baked cookie, served oven-warm in a micro-dish with a scoop of ice cream and a drizzle of sauce on top. There are multiple flavors to choose from, and all are killer.   On my last visit, our waitress, Ms. Marlie, enticed me with a bit of a tease about a Pizookie Platter, which she mentioned is like having five full-size Pizookies.  It's now on the bucket list. Over three trips to Austin, I've been to one BJ's or another six times.  Frequency alone ought to speak volumes, especially in a land of incredible food trucks and barbecue. I really can't figure out why almost every location of this franchise is rated 3 stars on Yelp.  You people must not have been to your local Crapplebees or Chili's lately! Food = 4/5  Facility = 4/5 Service = 4/5 Ambiance = 3/5 Value = 3/5"
Wendy S.,"Leander, TX",125,110,122,1.0,10/17/2016,"I went there on Friday night with 5 of my gal pals before we went to the movies--easy parking--hostess stand was the issue, and not just one issue--I was the first to arrive (One gal pal was in the bar)  I let the hostess know there would be 6 of us--she asked if I wanted to be seated now, and I said I would wait for my gal pals--ok, so 10 minutes go by, and we are all here--we all get up, I go back to the hostess, and say we are ready for the table of 6--Its going to go downhill from here-- ""You need a table for 6?"" she asked--yes, I just talked with you a few minutes ago-- ""Ok, let me get it set up, its going to be a few minutes"" OMG-- Ok, so we wait another 10 minutes And mind you, half the restaurant is empty They take us back to the VERY back by the dish tub, server station--I stopped walking when I saw where we were going--there was a huge booth that was empty and clean, and I said,'Can we have this one, it looks perfect?"" She replies, ""Yes, but we need to set it up, so we need you to go back to the hostess stand and wait""  OMG--nothing to set up but napkins--but, I should have know better, as they werent going to sit us there--so, they take us back to the hostess stand, another few minutes go by, and they take us to ANOTHER booth directly to the right side of the other cr@ppy table that was in the back that we didnt want --Seriously?  This is probably why I dont like chain restaurants nearly as much as when I was younger--Im not even going to review anything else, because seriously, if it is this much of an issue to sit at a nice table when a place is half empty, I won't be going back"
Xochtil G.,"Austin, TX",0,62,6,2.0,8/17/2017,"Curious a location to find in the Arbor Walk shopping center, yet not all its hyped up to be.  It is nice that they offer a ""steak and beer"" option, yet seemed more like a hyped up ""Bennigans"" with its big burgers and average booths and some upscale touches to the decor.  The entry was nice and the staff friendly, yet the food was not all that great.  We each had different items from their lunch menu and some of us did feel that either it was not well seasoned on their burgers or their other items had some added taste that just did not do the item justice.              I would recommend at least try once, but if you are a beer drinker with no real interest in an actual dining experience; then come to this casual urban place at least once."
Alexa B.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,1.0,8/16/2017,"Visited to spend a gift card I received and everything about my experience was absolutely awful. The hostess looked like she hated her job and didn't talk to us. Our server obviously did not want to be serving us, either. She never smiled and was very short with all of her questions. She never once came to refill our drinks and when I tried to complain about my pizookie (I got the churro pizookie but it tasted like onions) she refused to stop at our table. The evening came to an end by her basically tossing the bill at our table and not even stopping to ask how our dinner was. This was my first and last time visiting BJ's."
Eddie G.,"Austin, TX",0,6,,5.0,6/14/2017,"Always great food and great service. Plenty of healthy options and always happy to accommodate large groups with out reservations, you may have to wait a bit but well worth it."
Bill H.,"Austin, TX",55,13,,4.0,5/4/2017,We meet here once a month so working on going through the menu. Everything has been good to date. Their menu is large so it has something for everyone. I am not into craft beer more like mixed drinks or water. One of the better chain options so I will continue my patronage.
Christopher S.,"Pflugerville, TX",62,191,1293,2.0,7/19/2015,"They actually have very underrated salads. Beer, yes. Atmosphere, yes. Hot and tired and need to duck in somewhere, yes you'll do fine. The pizza here is supposed to be one of their specialties. Sorry, not bad, just not impressed either. The wait staff was good, in fact very attentive. Yes I will go here, but I will be selective in ordering. This place is in a decent shopping district and could really blow it up with some food that was a bit more outside the lines. Unfortunately it is slight predictable and sometimes not all that flavorful.  I am not saying not to come here, just measure you expectations for the mediocre."
Hanna J.,"Dallas, TX",425,383,324,4.0,2/16/2016,"I always come to BJ's when I'm not quite sure what I'm craving. Love their cream sodas. They come in giant mason jars. Alcoholic drinks are pretty average. I'm confident enough in my own cocktail abilities to not order them though, but they are pretty good. There's a full bar and a lot of options so you can't really go wrong! I'm usually drawn to ordering the fish & chips - the wedge fries are to die for, and I like the tartar sauce a lot. Their burgers are also good, and their salads are pretty standard. There is also a pretty good range of pizzas and pastas, fish, and healthier dishes as well. I think everything on the menu is decent - nothing amazing but you can't really go wrong. Price is a little high for what you get in my opinion, but there are generally large portions. Service is generally very friendly but it is hit or miss - one worker once told me I had beautiful eyes and it really made my day. Another server once forgot my appetizer order, which was definitely annoying. I let it go because I wasn't charged but just something to note. They play sports games on the televisions and have a good amount of seating, and a comfortable atmosphere. I think this is a good place to take a family for dinner, or a large group of friends with a wide variety of tastes, or an occasional date night."
Roger P.,"Austin, TX",13,20,3,5.0,6/6/2017,"One of our favorite restaurants, food is good, beer is outstanding and the wait staff awesome! Just about any restaurant can serve acceptable food, and many serve great beer...but few have a wait staff to equal this BJ's. They are the primary reason we drive 20 plus miles (one way) to eat there!"
Tanmay T.,"Austin, TX",78,18,5,5.0,6/17/2017,We went for dinner and were happy to see many options for vegetarian. Spinach filled mushrooms is a must try. They have descent thin crust pizzas and delicious pastas. Huge menu to choose from. Plenty of options for cocktails. Felt the quantity of cocktail is less for the price but it tasted well.
Melody T.,"Las Colinas, TX",608,639,2746,4.0,1/4/2016,"The pizza here is so good! If you are not into thick crust, make sure to ask for think crust! The thin crust pizza is super yummy and I love the BBQ Chicken flat bread! In addition they have 2 happy hours during the week. Monday-TR they have a late night happy hour from 9-11 which features their mini pizzas and a couple bucks off their cocktails! I love their chicken wings. I always ask for the a little extra crispy! Yum Yum! We had a pretty cool bartender that took good care of us!"
Terri J.,"Austin, TX",304,426,2277,4.0,11/5/2014,"I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, especially because there are so many amazing locally owned restaurants in town.  However, when I'm looking for a high protein low calorie option, I will usually go to BJ's if my friends insist on going out when I'm trying to ""behave"".  Their enLIGHTened menu suits my purpose. Today I tried the cherry chipotle glazed salmon.  Holy crap was it good.  I substituted veggies for the cous cous.  It comes with asparagus, which I love.  But the asparagus was really dry.  That's a crime.  The veggies were a bit undercooked, but still ok.   What I liked about this lunch was that they have a secret list (if you ask for it) that shows the calorie, fat, sat fat, sodium, carbs, fiber & protein content of all their menu items.  I was considering the lemon thyme chicken, but omg way way way too much sodium. That's a shame. I've eaten here on several occasions and their veggies are usually pretty good.  Today was an off day.  When I'm not behaving, their pizookies are sooooo good.  But I'm still mad that they discontinued the red velvet pizookie.  It was divine."
