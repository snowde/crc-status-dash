Minna K.,"Austin, TX",8,16,4,1.0,8/17/2014,"I've been to different locations of bjs alot a few years ago and recently i started going back. When i went a couple months ago, everything was great. However, me and my bf went back for the same pasta and it looked different, tasted different and was just not the same. It was so watery, it did not taste like pasta at all. It was salty and the two breadsticks that come with it werent there and our waiter seemed to notice but didnt care until we asked him to give it to us. The waitstaff there is always so unwelcoming and shows that they do not want to be there, like they have to be there or something. I know cuz im a waitress myself, but man you guys are corporate and need to be professional. I know i wont be going back to this location ever again."
Travis X.,"Austin, TX",208,142,1,4.0,12/3/2012,"Atmosphere/Decor:  It has a sports bar type vibe to  it.  Tv's along the  wall playing sports, a large alcohol selection, dark interior etc. etc.  Service: Service here has always been good for us. We've come about 5 times at this point and haven't had a negative experience.  They stay on top of refills pretty quickly, usually partake in minor chit chat and get the food out in a timely manner.  Food/menu: I've had 4 or 5 different things at this point and all of them have been good.  I particularly like the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, just make sure to ask for extra sauce, they never seem to give you enough...or maybe I'm just fat :P I can't comment much on their beer/alcohol menu as I generally do not drink at restaurants because it costs an arm and a leg and I'm cheap! The food menu is varied with a good amount of things to offer.  I would say the menu is large but not TOO large.  I wish the selection of the ""personal size"" appetizers was a bit more appealing though.  Price: The price isn't bad for what you get. You get a large plate of  food no matter what you order. The price of the personal size appetizers are great so if you want to nibble on something before your meal, it will no longer cost you the same price as an entree which was a complaint I had about this place before. Overall:  Though I get dirty looks and jeers from people for going to a chain restaurant, I've grown to like this place because  of the quality of food and service they've provided each time I've come."
Dee C.,"Georgetown, TX",0,51,5,1.0,4/28/2015,"We have been here a couple times but we don't come again. Ordered a pulled pork sandwich and when it arrived the meat was old, dry, and burnt. Can't swallow it without water dry. The manager came over and said she wanted to do something for us because of the experience. I said I did not want to wait for anything because my husband was just about done eating. She persisted and offered dessert because it would be fast. Well, it wasn't and we were still waiting and when I got the bill and found she charged me for it both my husband and I were shocked. She INSISTED that she bring something. I walked up to her and asked for her to remove the charge and she did. No ""I'm sorry I did not mean to charge you for that"" . WOW! You mess up my lunch date with my husband and make us wait around for a dessert I did not want and then charge me for it. We won't be going back."
Stef S.,"Austin, TX",90,262,116,4.0,6/9/2012,"Come on, admit it: you've chuckled at the name, too. Regardless, BJ's is one of the better chains out there. I like to think of it as the Cheesecake Factory for Men: both have ridiculously large portions for what you pay for and extensive menus. There's something for everybody when the menu is the length of a novel.  As with many brewhouse eateries, I think the house beer is made so as not to overwhelm the food. I can't think of one that's really memorable besides the berry cider that they have, and that's only sort of related to the beers. The berry cider is like a fizzy pinky-purpley glass of fruity Sprite. It's fantastic. I haven't had a beer here that I haven't liked, but I haven't had one that I'd go out of my way to seek out, either. They're all pretty simple brews--no strong flavors or complex flavor combinations. So, I suppose they're good to sip on with food.  The food and service at this BJ's are the bigger reasons why I'd come back. Service was attentive. Even when I've just ordered a glass of water because it was past my bedtime (hey, get off my lawn!), they made sure that it always stayed full. The food is a bit less salty and processed-tasting than many chains and for that, I'm thankful. The salmon is flavorful, flaky and huge. The deep-dish pizzas--while not a true Chicago-style deep dish--are still fantastic. They're like big, fluffy cheese breads with fabulous toppings all over. Their take on the southwestern eggroll is delicious and not over-fried to the point of being greasy and gross. Overall, it's pretty tasty."
Scott J.,"Denver, CO",51,17,,5.0,9/9/2012,"I've been a fan/customer of BJ's for years. I was so happy when they finally opened other locations around Austin (until 2010 there weren't any BJ's within 20 miles of me).  They have locations all over Southern California (where I'm orig from) so cheers to them for opening up more TX stores. Today I lunched with my parents at the Arbor Walk location - this location is about 2 years old - awesome decor and menu updates. Our server, Andrew, although new (which he told us, otherwise we'd never have known) was exceptionally friendly and outgoing. He really took care of my mom and made suggestions for her drinks. The coursing was timed just right, and Andrew checked on us no fewer than 5 times, we needed for nothing. We notified Andrew's manager of his terrific performance and after sharing our appreciation with Andrew, the manager gave us a few 'thank you' gift cards. (PS I had the sesame chicken salad - was yummy). With an updated decor, menu and look - BJ's always provides a great casual dining experience. Their lunch menu (weekdays) also rocks and is awesomely priced - cheaper than grabbing something fast."
Monica C.,"Austin, TX",6,9,,3.0,6/7/2013,"My review is mixedas I like the food but the other day I ordered curb side. I ordered a pot roast dinner (which was so good) and a kids meal, with a regular size root beer and Kazookie (I think that's what it's called) and my bill was $33 before tip. I wasn't provided an itemized bill and it seemed like a lot of money to feed my daughter and I. The curbside service was slow and my chidren (the reason I do curbside) were restless. I like the food though...not the price for that food."
Linda P.,"Austin, TX",5,86,2,3.0,12/14/2012,"Met up with some friends before the Holiday's  Hostess not very friendly, I asked if my friends had been seated, she said I could go and look. After I looked and saw they were not their I went back to the Hostess to get a table. She asked if I had a Reward card and I said no. It was like I had the plauge because I did not have a Reward card. ( I don't even know what that is?  A new promotion?) Once we were seated things looked up, the waitress we has was fantastic, I wish I had remembered her name. The food was good. I find the menu a little over whelming...so many choices.  All in all a good experience, I will be back."
Suzie P.,"Austin, TX",103,205,389,4.0,9/26/2012,"Been here 3 times now, once with my best friend, once solo and then I had to take my family.... it was delicious! Lunch specials are remarkable and priced VERY reasonable...  huge menu to select from. Dessert menu absolutely rocks! Lots of choices, and the few we've had, were delicious! Brownie and Ice Cream is by far, my fave! Stuffed Mushrooms are to die for. Really, they are that good. Such a small bite, but so much flavor, its unreal.  Love the fries too... could not keep hubby's hands out of them, we had to order more! Very good. Light and crispy, thin, shoestring fries!  Happy with the selections, happy with the service... overall a great experience, and we will definitely go back!"
Stephanie F.,"Austin, TX",17,99,33,4.0,2/26/2012,"Really enjoyed everything I experienced today. Came at 2pm on a Sunday and there was no wait.  Waitress came over immediately and my fiance ordered a Chimay Red and I got a root beer with a double shot of Absolut vanilla. Sublime.  We ordered the chicken pot stickers for appetizers and they were delicious.  A short time later our entrees arrived. My fiance ordered the new mahi mahi tacos and really enjoyed them. I got my usual broiled Atlantic salmon with mashed potatoes instead of rice. It came with a huge amount of butter-soaked vegetables that I just pushed to the side. I got the chardonnay-lemon sauce on the side and it was SO good. Salmon portion was HUGE. Perfectly cooked. I ordered 3 drinks and was surprised to be charged $3.90 for the root beer all 3 times. I guess no free refills on that since I was ordering $10 worth of vodka. Thought they'd throw in the root beer for free the 2nd and 3rd times. Didn't happen.   Our service was great, nothing really wrong, but just cannot give 5 stars. Reserving that for our dinner at Craft Steak in Vegas in April...I hope. Will definitely be back!!!"
Michael D.,"Cedar Park, TX",21,5,,3.0,11/14/2014,The Christmas beer wasn't quite to my liking but the rest of the crafted beers are delicious. We really enjoyed the great white deep dish pizza but the deep dish appetizer with the fries was not up to the normal BJ's standards that we are accustomed to. The pizookie desserts are Awesome. The service was great.
Thomas R.,"Austin, TX",8,12,55,5.0,7/19/2014,Great food and service. Plus their iPhone app made it so easy to pay when we were ready!
Nik H.,"Vallejo, CA",82,4,,1.0,12/8/2013,"Food wasn't too bad, when we got it. Maybe three stars. But this review is all about the service, and that's a one star story. On a night that wasn't crowded at all it took over forty five minutes to get avocado rolls; the server's response when we grew impatient waiting the same amount of time for our drinks, ""everything will be out when it's out ok""...hmmmm surely there's a better response than that. Even the manager was a Debbie Downer. After the crazy wait, our food came out completely wrong! His response, ""well, it'll go to waste if I take it back"". I'm all about being careful about waste, but in real life, it should have been done correctly or responsibility should have been taken or maybe a tone that reflected a sliver of good customer service. None of that. Not tonight."
Kathi H.,"Austin, TX",26,5,,3.0,9/22/2014,"Bjs has excellent salad, when you actually get the ingredients the salad is supposed to have, which is about 2 out of 25 times. I related having problems previously at the time I ordered. The waitress tonight didn't even come back to offer missing ingredients after being told what was missing and  looking at menu herself. (To see if I was correct) I am astonished! After i asked about the ingredients, when the salad was 3/4 gone, well after she checked the menu, she told me she could check on it but they may not have ingredients on the menu. She didn't even check with the kitchen! So, bad service, inconsistent kitchen, uncaring attitude, incomplete meal."
Teresa H.,"San Saba, TX",0,12,14,5.0,7/7/2014,"I have been eating at BJs for 10 yrs. I am a caterer of 32 yrs , this is my fav place."
Jordan M.,"Austin, TX",0,25,6,5.0,9/18/2014,"This is the place where my entire family loves to go for our teice a month family dinner. It has a great kid menu. The adult menu is very big. Sometimes this takes away from the quality of food, but this is not the case. I eat something different everytime and I have been happy everytime. There are tons of BJs draft beer and they are all really good. All ranging from light to dark on their very explanatory beer menu. Highly recommend this place"
Jesse G.,"Round Rock, TX",5,76,4,2.0,8/5/2014,"Service was good, only reason for two stars... Food is terrible tastes very out of box or microwave."
Miss S.,"San Diego, CA",0,18,,1.0,7/30/2011,"Big menu of TERRIBLE, greasy, caked on butter food. If you eat here enough you will be the size of Texas.  Service started out ok. Then came the waiting and the waiting.  When I am done I want my check promptly. When I hand you a credit card dont tell me to wait AGAIN so you can clear some other tables dishes. Then wait AGAIN, cause you screwed up the bill.  All the while my 4 year old is climbing the walls. Then comes the real kicker.  The tall African American MANAGER followed me to the parking lot and stood at my car asking me what was wrong with the service!!!  Who does that?   I will never go back there unless it is to piss on the walls. If you want a wide selection of fancy beers then this may be to your liking.  Eat BEFORE you come to this junk."
Mark G.,"Austin, TX",134,275,41,3.0,9/6/2011,"Take The Cheesecake Factory. Kick the decor up a notch. Kick the prices and food down half a notch. Swap in beer instead of cheesecake as the signature item. Make the menu only slightly less epic, add a few televisions and - voilá - you pretty much have BJ's. I start with their house-brew pale ale - quite hoppy enough to pass for an IPA, and pretty darn decent stuff. Went well with the appetizer sampler platter, complete with all the requisite fried goodies - cheese sticks, southwestern and avocado egg rolls as well as spinach-artichoke dip. All standard-issue quality, though the avocado egg rolls vanished first. For entrees, my fish and chips was good, the cajun pasta passable, and the baby back ribs a bit below par. Portions were massive, so our plans for dessert were replaced with overstuffed moans and to-go boxes. Service was attentive but a bit schizo - we had a newbie waiter as well as his trainer serving us, so there was a fair amount of overeagerness and confusion about who was fetching what. No stars off for that but no bonus, either. All-in-all an impressive interior, a vast selection of passable but mediocre food (at least based on our sampling), large portions and decent prices. And with the concept of the place so parallel to that of The Cheesecake factory, I'll have to remind myself not to refer to it as The BJ Factory. Ahem."
Tiffany W.,"San Francisco, CA",290,204,103,3.0,12/6/2011,"Dear BJ's,  I adore you for giving your patrons an option of thick wedge or skinny shoe string fries to accompany their burger/sandwich. Your thin & crispy fries are among one of my favorites. In fact, my stomach just grumbled loudly in agreement.  Oh, what I wouldn't do for a cold scoop of vanilla ice cream atop a warm chocolate chip pazookie... Om nom nom... Peace, love, and good food & beer, Tiffany"
Gary K.,"Austin, TX",472,494,1855,4.0,10/16/2011,"A friend and I went to BJs on a Wednesday night, we were seated immediately by the hostess and giving our menus.  Yes the menu is large which is fine; I like many choices, no Boo hoo here! My friend ordered the grilled burger melt with shoe string fries and liked both of them.  I ordered the Tuscan tomato soup bisque inside a large bread loaf of some kind with the top baked into a piece of garlic toast and a small salad, the salad was the standard side salad and good , the tomato bisque was great. Yes it is large place with lots of dark wood, I like it, no Boo hoo here! Yes the prices may be a little high, but food prices have increased just as everything else has, Boo hoo, if you can't afford it, don't go! The service tonight was great! No comment on beer I don't drink it, but it looks like they have a large selection. Would I go back? Yes, I will I want to try the deserts and the grilled burger melt and the pizza."
