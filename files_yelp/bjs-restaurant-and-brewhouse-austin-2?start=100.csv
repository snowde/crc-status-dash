Julie H.,"Austin, TX",9,151,79,1.0,11/7/2014,"Horrible. Waiter in training kept calling the men at the table ""boss"" and then had a condescending tone with the women. What the heck? Food took forever  and then we were told by the gum-chewing waiter that our order was ""stuck"" behind a huge party.  The salad I ordered tasted like a bowl of soggy, soppy lettuce. I think they made the salad early and it just sat in a warm spot for a while. The burger they brought me when I sent back the old lettuce was wayyy over-seasoned. I'm a saltaholic and I couldn't eat it.  I seriously want my 2 hours back. Never again."
John H.,"Bastrop, TX",110,21,1,4.0,5/25/2015,"Like the ppl who ""dont get"" the 4 and 5 star reviews, i  ""dont get"" the 1 star reviews,when your only complaint was about 1 thing(incompetent server) or you got 1 app(greasy etc).  I have never had bad food here, beer is always decent to great, but will admit that the servers can be spotty. But overall, i have great meals and drinks at this venue. Since its opened i go there at least 2 or 3 times a year(live in bastrop, hard to get to austin and way too many venues to eat at lol)  But i have had the loaded baked potato which was awesome, my friend had the salmon which he loved on my last visit. I was able to introduce my buddy to great beers as well and watch the Rangers game so he wouldnt miss it.  In the past ive also had other dishes that were really good, never bad. They used to have a decent chicken parm, which i was suprised at since there are some so called italian restaurants in austin that cant get even spaghetti right. (but of course there are others that are amazing!)  So the only thing that is hit or miss for us anytime i go can be the servers. This visit it was a particular bartender that wouldnt talk directly to us while she was doing something below the bar so we couldnt hear her repsonses or questions clearly. She ended up leaving about halfway through dinner and was replaced by a pair of super friendly bartenders, a guy still learning and a woman that was just delightful, witty and charming.    Overall a great visit, yet again.  always averages 3.5 to 4 stars in my book."
Jennifer B.,"Denver, CO",1026,1320,1786,3.0,5/5/2013,"I completely forgot I even came here.  In Austin for work and this was the choice by the group since it had a patio and was close.  Nothing wrong with BJ's just nothing memorable either.   I had a cold beer and a BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad (a safe bet).  Salad was good with fresh ingredients.  Other entrees I saw at the table was the Balsamic Grilled Chicken, a White Pizza of some kind and a veggie burger.  All looked pretty good.   You will receive good service, solid food Americanized style with little creativity and lack of flavor usually.  I like to support local businesses so this is not on the top of my list for returning.  If you're on a business trip and looking for a place that will appeal to everyone this would fit the bill."
Leslie U.,"Austin, TX",146,59,292,5.0,1/29/2014,"I would eat at BJ's multiple times a week if I could afford it.  I have eaten a lot of different things here and EVERYTHING is delicious. With their multiple page menu, you can get something completely different every time you go and trust that you will love it. 3 words: FRESH BREWED BEER! Love their reward program, you get a point for every dollar you spend each visit. You can either use points at each level you reach or save them up to get more money off your meal or even use them for a fancy dinner or auctions they have."
Kim S.,"Pflugerville, TX",79,294,29,3.0,1/9/2014,"This, I think, is my second time here.  I ate here with Martie H.  She ordered a strawberry martini and had to send it back--it was horrific.  bleck!!  I had some potstickers that were pretty yummy--but really...again...how difficult is it to make a potsticker?  I don't think BJs is making them from scratch...are you??? At any rate...I keep trying this place b/c it's by my friends' place and or by my office--I'm just never overly impressed with it.  It's good for what it is, though...I guess."
Michael B.,"Austin, TX",11,127,50,3.0,2/28/2015,"Roast Beef Dip was good. Does it compare to anything from West NY? No. But it's good. Service was decent.  Atmosphere was good. Getting to this place was troublesome. Will I return? Sure, I'll try it again."
Scott W.,"San Antonio, TX",0,5,,1.0,10/10/2015,Usually love BJs when we travel. The service at this location was aweful. Had to get hostess to take my order since my waitress didn't approach my table. Food finally came out and was cold and not that tasty. Not to happy for $15 dollar entrees.
Philip T.,"Humble, TX",0,28,6,5.0,9/29/2015,We had a party of eight and received stellar service.   Ashley was always there as if we were the only table.   Great Job Ashley!!!
N S.,"Bentonville, AR",0,24,,5.0,2/16/2016,"Honey crisp salad is wonderful and chicken fried steak is great and crispy with very tasty mashed potatoes and gravy. We didn't care much for the queso. It was kinda grainy and not very hot temperature wise but we did not tell our waitress. Her name is Ashley M and she is absolutely one of the best waitresses we've ever had. Very attentive to our needs and friendly. I love that she never responded ""no problem"".  She noticed that the chicken fried steak didn't have much gravy on it and asked if she could bring more. Ask for her."
Aaris E.,"Pflugerville, TX",2,20,4,1.0,10/14/2015,"The evening of Monday, October 12th will mark my final visit to BJ's on Mopac.  I was entertaining a guest from out of town and thought it'd be cool as her home town doesn't have a BJ's.  Boy was I wrong!  We were greeted by the hostess and seated.  A waitress immediately provided us with water and said our waiter would be with us soon.  We were seated in the center of the dining area at a four top table.  Additionally, a waiter literally swept around us.  I mention the location so that you'll know it was impossible not to see us.  10 minutes later we completed reviewing the menu and was ready to order however the waiter never showed.  There were roughly four other parties in the dining area (all of which had waiters).  At 15 minutes in a family of five  were seated.  My friend finally became frustrated and left the restaurant stating how ridiculous the service was.  I stayed behind because I wanted to see just how long this fiasco could go on.    At 20 minutes in as a waiter served the family of five sodas I decided it was time to speak with a manager.  I explained to the manager that we had basically been ignored.  He stated he was certain it was not the case;  that perhaps we were overlooked.  I then walked him over to the highly visible area where we previously sat.  He apologized and offered courtesy meal cards as he saw it was impossible not to have seen us.  As he went back to the kitchen for the courtesy cards he was visibly upset with his staff.  I saw him admonish staff and could almost imagine what he was saying by the hand gestures he used.  As soon as he went into the kitchen the staff (a group of four or greater) literally began laughing at him.  When he returned I told him I what I witnessed.  What I didn't tell him was that this was not my first, but second HORRIBLE experience at the Mopac BJ's.  Because BJ's has good food, nice atmosphere and an extensive beer/wine menu I'll continue to patronize it however I will NEVER go the Mopac location. The first time I experienced the horrible service (actually no service) I thought to myself ""things happen"".  The second time showed that poor service is perpetual at the Mopac location."
Steven D.,"Austin, TX",0,20,,4.0,2/19/2015,"Got a couple of pizzas with the curbside pick up option. Very easy process and very good pizza.  I have yet to eat here, but I would definitely come here to catch a game."
Eric O.,"Houston, TX",1,45,1,2.0,8/22/2015,"I cam here with a few friends after rock climbing for beers and some food. I had never been before and someone had suggested it, I was down for it despite the Yelp reviews. We sit down and order a pitcher, the waiter asks us for our IDs followed by ""This one looks a little young,"" pointing at one of my friends. Now, why the heck do you feel the need to single someone out and say something so asinine and rude? That was completely unacceptable and incredibly out of line. Fast forward a bit, we get our beer and food. I got the French dip. It was fine, nothing too special, and the fries were fine as well. We got a pitcher of their Jeremiah red though and the beer tasted a bit off / skunky, but maybe that's how it was supposed to taste... Overall the service was somewhat slow and the food was OK. I was put off by a few other comments our waiter made throughout the course of the meal, and probably won't be coming here again. To top it all off, I got food poisoning and was actually out on a date when everything set in. For the next few hours I tried to play off the fact that I was purging myself in the bathroom. Service - 2.5 / 5 Food - 3.5 / 5 Experience - 1.5 / 5"
Joe C.,"Austin, TX",468,339,1252,3.0,10/23/2012,"I did it all for the Pizookie. The gluten-free Pizookie! If you're going to review a place with a dated joke for a name, you may as well channel Limp Bizkit... *shrug* This is an easy 3* review.  I don't mean it bad.  Some things they do well, some not so much. Beer:  Sure... 4+ stars.  Plenty of selection.  The house-brand seasonal is the best pumpkin ale I've ever had.  I guess I'm just easy, because I don't care if they make it in house any more than I care that the cheesecake place down the road isn't located inside an actual factory.  Menu:  3*.  Typical large disjointed menu.  The gluten free menu looks like a brochure for a timeshare, and half of it is salads.  Yeah, I get it.  Leave out croutons, and your salads are gluten free.  Execution of Menu:  2*.  The patty melt was OK, not great.  The calamari I had at lunch seemed like it sat in the window a little bit.  At another location, the calamari was great.  Service:  we liked.  The work-lunch speed is good.  Our waitress at dinner was helpful and responsive.   But.... The gluten-free crust pizza is the real deal.  Wife declares it the ""second best gf pizza in Austin"".  The meatball topping is NOT gf, but unlike some places, the pepperoni *is* gf.  And since her fave pizza is 20-odd minutes away (plus time to find parking on E. 6th) having a place in the 'hood to satisfy her pizza cravings is great.   And... Then there's the gf pizookie. Cakey (in a good way) gooey chocolate chip cookie goodness, topped with ice-cream.  Wife even asked (like she sometimes does when she's impressed) if we accidentally got the 'regular' instead of the gluten free.  The waitress said she prefers it over the regular one, and I don't really think she was exaggerating for our benefit Iron out the kitchen inconsistencies, and it would easily be a solid 4*+ place in our 'hood.  As it is, it may just be a ""pick up in a pinch"" kind of place for us.  But the call-ahead curbside pickup is simple and efficient. Or, we'll just drop by for the pizza, beer, and pizookie..."
Sajjad K.,"Austin, TX",9,11,,5.0,8/17/2015,Ernest the Manager and Jamison our waiter turned a potentially disastrous dinner into an amazing guest services experience.  We will definitely return to this BJs!!
Monte R.,"Austin, TX",28,258,5,1.0,12/11/2012,"Like, ugh, what happened to this place, BJ's Restaraunt?  My god, maybe the most massive downslide so fast in quality since Pompeii. When BJ's Restaraunt first opened, we would dine at BJ's a couple times a month.  We would order ALWAYS order their DEEP DISH PIZZA (BBQ Chicken) and it was divine, some of the best deep dish I've ever had.  Super thick crust, like two inches high, served in a metal pan, like it's supposed to be made.  Always filled us up.  Service was  solid and prices were higher than average but I gladly paid it since the food was good. But we moved house and it had been about nine months since we dined there.  But we recently got a hunkering for their DEEP DISH PIZZA and we returned ... and that's when the horror happened.  We ordered the deep dish pizza ... and it wasn't deep dish pizza.  Instead, it was served on a regular white plate and it was just regular pizza, like Papa John's, maybe a half inch thick.  We were like totally confused, man.  We asked our waiter like, uh, this isn't DEEP DISH PIZZA.  There is no deep crust.  No pan.  The pizza is relatively average in thickness.  And the waiter was like oh, yeah, we changed our recipe awhile ago and this is now the DEEP DISH PIZZA.  Oh, man, the horrors!  What a bad decision.  We still ate it, had no choice.  But we were still hungry afterwards ... a $15 dollar pizza, to boot. Also, our meal for our toddler, the veggies come out half cooked.  Had to resend them back, ugh.  Total disaster. BJ's has gone downhill.  For $50 bucks total with beers, we left hungry and dissatisfied.  Go elsewhere, I say."
Jason R.,"Cedar Park, TX",62,17,10,3.0,10/20/2013,"I'll start off by saying I'm not a huge fan of this chain. It's just the right amount of impersonal service to rub you the wrong way. The actual hamburger meat here was decently seasoned and had good flavor, especially when put against the other pricey burgers I've had up to this point. The lettuce was lame iceberg considering the price and stood out like a sore thumb, but at least it and other condiments tasted fresh. Similar to the burger, the fries weren't great, but also weren't that bad either. Overall this burger/fry combo was decent, but not excellent. If you were forced to go to BJ's and are in the mood for a burger you could do much worse. With that said, in Austin, you can do much better for much cheaper. Read more burger reviews at "
Henry Z.,"Austin, TX",451,139,3,1.0,6/28/2014,"The food here was really good, but the service is among the worst I've had. When we first got here, I ordered a drink and when delivered, a significant amount was spilled and the server said nothing.  Then our waiter refilled everyone's waters except mine. But it was okay because I still had quite a bit. Then the Caesar salad came and it had barely any dressing. I did not have any utensils so I asked for some along with extra dressing. I never got my dressing so just ate basically lettuce and cheese shreds. At the end still no one had refilled my water so I asked the waiter for a refill one last time. I still never got the refill. In conclusion, no utensils, no apology for spilled drink, no refills, no dressing, and we were neglected most of the meal. When the check came, almost everyone's bills were wrong and my whole table had complaints. Stay far away or hope for a competent waiter."
Brad F.,"Austin, TX",69,131,62,4.0,3/1/2016,My wife and I eat here all the time and their selection is incredible. We have not had a dinner less than good.  Salads are incredible but don't eat desserts without being prepared to go overboard.  Incredibly delicious.
Walker F.,"Austin, TX",252,650,177,4.0,10/4/2012,"So food and drink here doesn't contain ingredients you can't pronounce or have never heard of. Or cost a billion dollars for three bites artfully arranged on a plate. And a lot of times, that exactly what you want.  I frequent BJs when I'm in the mood for good, reasonably priced food, and a lot of it. I love their P.M. Porter. It's nitro conditioned which I've never seen in a porter, and tastes more like a stout to me (though I'm no expert). They have a ridiculously huge menu, but I usually stick to the pizza (during HH the mini's are half off!) or the salads (huge). Other HH specials include $2 off apps, and $1 off beer and well drinks, and HH is 3-7 M-F. Can sit in the bars to enjoy a game, out on the floor for more conversation, or on the patio (not bad considering this location is off Mopac).  Service has always been great here, and maybe it's just us, but manager often comes by (and once, with coupons!)."
Martie H.,"Galveston, TX",225,169,295,3.0,12/4/2013,"My friend and I decided to eat here because it was getting late and it was close to home.  They have an extensive menu, but not too many items to suggest a lot of frozen instead of fresher items.  I expected something like Chili's and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't.  They have small appetizers for people that want a small amount instead of a meal sized starter.  Their prices are a little higher than I would expect for the items they offer, but not too high to be ridiculous.  I had a specialty burger that's new to the menu and it was tasty, but quite greasy.  My friend had pot stickers that were good, especially for a non asian restaurant.   My one complaint- I ordered a Strawberry Martini and it was horrible!!  I asked the server to take it back and she said no problem, that it was a drink that is returned 9/10 times."
