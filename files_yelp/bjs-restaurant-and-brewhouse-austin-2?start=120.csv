Debra R.,"Austin, TX",10,33,,2.0,11/13/2015,"Let me start off by saying I used to be huge fans of this place, but that was back before they kept taking off my favorite dishes.  I came here a few weeks ago and was very underwhelmed by the whole experience. We sat outside because the weather was nice, which i appreciate that they have a patio area. But this is the second time that BJ's has taken away my favorite dish with no notice! But I know I can't expect a chain food place to keep something that they don't want to, so I digress.  Once I realized that I would have to order something else I decided to try my boyfriend's favorite dish, the fish tacos. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time, but the tortillas that the tacos were served in were disgustingly stale. I took one bite out of them and my teeth hurt stale. I would have told my server this and requested fresh ones or something else, but no one ever check on us after dropping off the food. Granted, our server had a large table that was nearby, but we never even received an ""Everything tasting ok?"" walk by. A manager even came by and talked with the large table near us, but never stopped to talk with us.  So after waiting for 10 minutes and seeing no server, i just ate the now cold fish out of my tacos.  Good beer. Underwhelming food and service. Don't think we will be back anymore."
Angela H.,"New Boston, TX",13,21,20,4.0,11/10/2014,Handmade burgers. Toasted buns. Skinny or wedge fries. Meat very good. Strawberry Margarita delicious! Sliders are handmade patties too. Very good meat. Make sure you tell them well done if you don't want pink in the middle. Salted Carmel pizookie is delicious.  Would have given five stars but waiter was lacking.
Bobby M.,"Austin, TX",4,58,17,5.0,7/13/2015,I don't know why this place has such bad reviews! I went here on a date and it was the best time. Marcus was awesome and weirdly enough helped make the whole experience tie together nicely. The Pizookie trio he suggested was AMAZING. Oreo cookie is a must.
Holly O.,"Austin, TX",37,21,4,1.0,1/27/2016,"This is heartbreaking for me to write because I love this restaurant... My office took me here for my birthday at lunch time.... We sat at a large booth to the left of the door. The food was great! Our drinks when we could get them were fine but the server lol - oh that server was the worse her name I believe was Audrey or something similar but she was what made the whole experience horrible... Your job is to be a server and with her customer service skill set she isn't where she needs to be, such a rude individual to have a job such as hers.. One of my co-workers was even trying to help her out lol and close the menu for her lol and her response for that was we have people that we pay to do that lol"
Carlo G.,"Austin, TX",1,15,3,5.0,12/28/2015,"Probably my favorite ""Chain"" restaurant. I always get the New Orleans Jambalaya, and every once in a while I will try something new and love it."
John R.,"Pocahontas, AR",316,319,596,4.0,4/18/2012,"For months, I stayed away because the name alone. Then I heard it was loud and crowded, so that gave me another excuse to not go. Finally, curiosity took over and I went here with someone who made me see Titanic 3D all by myself.  Because I'm only 25, I took childlike joy in walking through the revolving door over and over (sorry, dining partner)! We were seated quickly. I was pretty puzzled with the erratic decor, but it somehow works. Our server was excellent and on my next visit, I'll make sure to request his section.  For libations, I had the Nutty Brewnette and it's pretty great. Being a sucker for mushrooms anywhere, everywhere, all the time, I knew that I'd be ordering the spinach and cheese stuffed mushrooms. They were pretty standard, which means that they were completely awesome. We couldn't resist ordering the fried artichokes, and the dipping sauce was delicious. For our entree, we split a vegetable pizza on a whole wheat crust. It nearly had me screaming ""PIZZA!"" over and over again, because it was without a doubt one of the better deep dish pizzas I've ever eaten. I want to talk about this pizza, eat this pizza, and eat this pizza while talking about it. It's good.  BJ's is a good idea and I will definitely be returning. And yes, I did another few spins in the revolving door on the way out."
Harrison C.,"Snyder, NY",55,250,59,2.0,2/14/2013,"Disappointing given how nice other locations are in California.  This Mopac location starts with a freezing cold lobby, and ends up with slow service which resulted in overcooked food. We went to BJs for an 8:30pm dinner and the place was deserted.  That apparently meant that the staff had shifted into slo-mo, because it took forever for our server to take our order, refill drinks, or give us an update on an overcooked burger and dried out ribs that took almost 45 minutes to get to the table. That time of night must mean the graveyard shift, because the place was out of most of the salads. Very disappointing food, inexplicably cold interior, and slow service."
Jacob G.,"Austin, TX",3,13,3,1.0,6/20/2015,"First instinct was wow this place is big and has a great menu. Very expensive but great atmosphere. The table was sticky, seats were dirty. Waitress was very informative however extremely slow. Got our appetizer, it was delicious. Then the food came out. My mom's shrimp scampy was so Spicy it was unedable, my dads chicken fried steak looked looked like it was fried in cold oil because it was dripping and my chicken Alfredo has super hard noodles. The manager came and tried to correct the situation however we were quite done with the night. Expected more out of a nice restaurant like that."
Danielle W.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,6/19/2015,"Have you ever had a burger that was so good, you called your mom and apologized because the next time you see her, you will have to slap her?  That did not happen at BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse.  I went for lunch with a coworker and it was a celebration for a promotion for me so I was super excited.  I had eaten at the location south before and so I knew what to expect in regards to the menu and service. Well, you don't know what you have until it's gone.   We sit down and wait for about ten minutes to even be greeted by our server.  She did not provide a name.  We were next to a very large table of people, maybe fifteen or twenty in total, but they were not rowdy or noisy at all. They had just finished placing their order when we sat down.  After waiting for a long time, we finally get a server and are able to order our drinks. Five minutes later, we actually get our drinks. We ordered lemonade so you wouldn't think it would take that long but that is neither here nor there.  When she comes back to our table with the drinks, we place our orders. We both order burgers, her's medium and mine mid-rare (I like my meat to fight me when I eat it).  Then we wait. And wait. And wait. The large table gets all their food, they get drink refills, they get asked if everything is alright, they are happy.  We are left waiting like Leo DiCaprio waiting for his Oscar. Finally, food arrives. HAHA NOPE. Not our food, the runner got the wrong table and then asked us if we are sure that that food isn't ours. Yes, we know that we ordered two burgers, not three sandwiches.  After 50 minutes and no sign of the waitress or really anyone, the large table is paying, getting to-go drinks and boxes, and is leaving. We FINALLY get our food. The fries are hot and tasty. Her burger is fine. Mine is like a hockey puck of overcooked sadness. I also asked for ranch for my french fries and I am only assuming that the woman had to go to the elusive Hidden Valleys themselves as she was never seen or heard from again and I never got my ranch. I take a bite of my burger as I am starting to eye my arm with a ravenous gaze at this point but no, I can't eat it. I just can't. Waitress is gone. She finally walks by, attempting to avoid eye contact but I manage to get her attention. We place an order to go for my other coworkers who stayed behind, two burgers with fries. She then realizes that we have no drinks left, we had even drunk the ice that had melted into water. Brings back two drinks and then scurries away.  Never once asked if everything was ok and never gave me a chance to say ""hey, I can't eat this.""  Just runs like Forrest Gump.  After eight minutes, she brings out the to go order. So they CAN cook burgers faster than an hour, they just choose not to. Gives me the check and then FINALLY notices that my burger is sitting there in it's entirety, gently congealing. ""Do you want a to-go box?"" I can't help it, I laugh. Tell her no, I can't eat this now, I won't eat it later. ""Was there something wrong with it?"" Told her that I had ordered mid-rare and this is quite obviously well done, then prove it by picking up the burger and tapping it against the plate, making the clinking sound of WAY overcooked meat.  ""Oh"" and walks away. Never apologized, never asked if I wanted something else. Nothing. No response other than ""oh"". She returns with the check and said that they took the burger off the bill and then walks away again.   I am a grown up. I understand that sometimes, things happen. Sometimes, burgers overcook and nobody notices. Sometimes, its busy and you can't get refills for a table. Sometimes, Mercury is in retrograde and a ninja just killed your pa and you have to work four jobs to support your grieving mother and you get to those jobs walking barefoot, in the snow, uphill both ways.  Ignoring a table and not following up on them is unacceptable. Maybe management needs a more hands on approach. Maybe this entire restaurant needs a sternly worded Come to Jesus talk. Maybe someone will ACTUALLY APOLOGIZE when they are told the food is inedible. I know that I will never eat here or at any BJ's again and I will try my hardest to never even drive by this location."
Charlet A.,"Chicago, IL",0,5,1,2.0,7/8/2016,"Food was tasty, but extremly small portions. My fiance had the bison burger and steak with asparagus and mashed potatoes. The burger and asparagus were flavorless. Our waitress must have been new because service was horrible. The waitress forgot to place our order so we were waiting for a long time for our food. The drinks were watered down too."
Wes O.,"Austin, TX",894,891,14,5.0,3/5/2012,"Imagine an upscale brewpub/sports bar with a menu approaching the variety of the Cheesecake Factory, but with excellent food.  That describes my trip to BJ's last night. With the expanisve menu, we asked our waitress, Christina, for her recommendations.  She was candid about the strengths of the menu, which were especially helpful with our appetizers.  Both the meatball appetizer and the fried cheese were excellent.  My dinner of the BBQ beef sandwich was excellent.  The fried onion strings on top of it may have been the best onion strings I've had in ages. The BBQ sandwich was more like a great roast beef sandwich slathered in BBQ sauce, reminding me of Jason's Deli's ""Deli Cowboy"" sandwich back when they served it. All in all, a very pleasant dinner surprise that I look forward to revisiting."
Al N.,"Austin, TX",0,18,,1.0,7/3/2016,"Haven't been to our local BJ's in Sunset Valley for about a year and then remembered why we stopped going there; just had the worst hamburger I have ever had, very highly over seasoned and covered in grease. When I complained to the waiter he said ""must be the new cook as he messed up one for the next booth also"" so? Sunday evening at 6pm and very few customers, go figure."
Jack N.,"Austin, TX",240,353,37,4.0,2/13/2012,"We had a nice little meal here after running errands.  In fact, the only way I agreed to run errands, much less brave the horror that is Arbor Walk, was to be able to stop somewhere for a bite and a brew. Veek suggested BJs, and after a short moment of considering the possibilities of what she meant, I agreed that the brew house would be fine.  I wanted to try it, I had only been to a BJs one other time and it was fine, if not remarkable. We're trying to eat a bit healthier and one tactic is portion control, so a lot of times we split items   We both ordered a bowl of soup (pro tip - their ""small' soup is well over a cup and plenty unless its your main meal), but we split a burger.   Lest you start worrying about our sanity, we did also split a pitcher of their house made hefeweizen.  Calm down, we're old but not senile. The forced patter of the wait staff is somewhat off-putting:  ""Would like you try one of our appetizers such as XYZ"" and ""Would you like something to drink, perhaps one of our signature cocktails such as the ABC"".....  but our server was prompt, friendly and efficient.  Really, hard to fault her for the ridiculous policies of the restaurant.  It sounds for all the world like they took it right out of ""Office Space"". Food was good, beer wasn't bad, and service was fine.  So BJ's is a viable option if you've found yourself in that version of Hell named Arbor Walk.  i suggest that you let your shopping partner loose to hunt and gather while you sit at the bar at BJs and chill out."
Seon B.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,275,366,2.0,3/15/2015,"I like the south Austin BJ's location. My experience here was subpar. My burger I ordered medium well was well done, which killed it for me. The fries were decent. I had come here for acompany dinner and service wasn't the best either. A few other people had complaints with their orders as well. I won't be returning to this location hopefully it was an off day. I also had a frozen strawberry margarita, which was very very sweet. The corn fritters with corn aioli was tasty however."
Jim L.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,2.0,11/30/2015,"On the recommendation of a friend, we went there last night. Let's just say it was a forgettable experience. The food was mediocre at best. The fried artichokes we ordered as an appetizer was overlooked. The entree mahi mahi was dry and flavorless and the creole shimp were tiny and the sauce had zero spice to it. Let me also add the prices were way out of whack for the quality of food served. The only reason it got an extra star was the service, which was quite attentive. Pass this one by."
Vinny P.,"Austin, TX",0,11,,4.0,11/11/2015,"The place has good food, it's a little pricey for what you get. But  the food is good and the service is good.   The pizza is excellent and so is the tortilla soup."
Laura A.,"Pasadena, TX",255,540,14,5.0,1/3/2012,"We were very impressed with BJ's and suprised of all the negative reviews.  Usually when we go to a brewery, I have found I dislike the beers and end up choking one down or getting a regular beer if available.  Of the four beers we tried, we really liked all four of them.  The Piranha was our fave, followed by the Brewnette and the red.  We look forward to trying all the rest of them. We got appetizers for our meal.  I really liked the mozzarella & tomato salad, and for only three bucks it was a good deal.  The sliders were good, and we got a large pile of fries for just $1.  The stuffed mushrooms were good too.  I want to try the thai wontons next time.  We noticed too late that the appetizer pizzas were half off, so we will have to try that next time. Also, we wanted the dessert cookie with ice cream (forgot what they call it) but of course we can't agree on a cookie or the ice cream.  They can customize it, do 1/2 batter of one and 1/2 batter of your other choice and whatever two ice cream flavors you want!  It was really good and hit the spot. I really liked the ambiance of the place... dark wood, cosy, clean restrooms.  We are looking forward to going back to try more beers and some different food!"
Roberto E.,"Austin, TX",38,23,11,1.0,3/13/2014,"Wow....honestly this place sucked from the time we walked in... The host greeted us, not by saying ""welcome to BJs,"" but by asking if we had a rewards card. We said no so she told us to wait off to the side. After a very few uncomfortable moments of silence, another host motioned for us to follow him.  The place was nice inside. Whatever--looked like every other bar/restaurant that seems to be popular nowadays. Waitress showed up promptly, asked us what we wanted, so we got drinks and calamari appetizer. The picture on the menu (hah, I know, pictures on a menu) looked pretty good. The menu was huge. I'm not joking--the burgers were broken down into categories based on which piece of equipment you wanted it cooked on...not necessarily a bad thing...but strange. Everything served here is frozen food that could be prepared at home. Well--when we got that calamari...it looked nothing like the photo. It was $10, but probably had three or four bites of calamari. It was a very, very small plate of food.  I never send back food. I work in a kitchen and I know how annoying that can be. But...this wasn't right. My wife asked if this was a normal portion, apparently it was. I told her we didn't want it. $10 is quite a bit of mula for a measly portion of food.  Instead, we just ordered some food to try and hurry this trip up. We were both pretty ready to get out of there, but we were also hungry. Sadly--I think our calamari (which say on our table for awhile) was served to another table. Gross. Anyways--we get our food and it's not horrible. I had the jalapeño burger, which came with fried jalapeños. The burger had only a couple of jalapeños, but two different sauces...kinda weird but whatever. The Asian salad was alright as well. I guess the mandarin oranges and sesame seeds made it Asian. Whatever--this place just didn't do it for me. The staff was bad, the food was alright and the best part of our experience was leaving the restaurant."
Judy D.,"Jenks, OK",0,28,2,2.0,5/17/2015,"The seat in the booth was torn. The hostess was curt. But our server, Andy, was nice and the food was good. But I'd rather eat at a local place where the management cares about the customers and the atmosphere. Why wouldn't you repair a torn seat?"
Sadia H.,"Austin, TX",22,33,9,1.0,7/2/2014,"This place has a great atmosphere and is pretty, but that is all. Yes this is a chain but I was incredibly disappointed at the low quality food. I ordered the house salad which came out as a tiny portion and dripping with excess balsamic dressing.  My entree of angel hair pasta with vegetables was extremely bland and badly cooked, the angel hair pasta was in clumps. This was also a small portion. Very dissatisfied  and I won't be returning."
