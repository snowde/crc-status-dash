Summer P.,"Austin, TX",29,117,34,2.0,4/29/2015,Reminds me of Cheesecake Factory - big menu with nothing worth a darn on it. I got a pasta dish with grilled chicken on top that was 75% fat. I gagged trying to eat it. I doubt I'll be back unless someone twists my arm and even then I will probably pass. Don't waste your time.
Jennifer Y.,"Austin, TX",486,1024,9615,3.0,8/29/2012,"Great service, clean dining area and restrooms.  Just make sure you check your bill for over charges though."
Thomas B.,"Austin, TX",1708,114,2051,4.0,10/23/2013,"So many great things on the menu, I know not where to start.  Probably my favorite is their Culinary Creation ""Parmesan Crusted Chicken.""  It's even better (and bigger) than Cheesecake's Chicken Bellagio.  And the Lemon Chardonnay Butter Sauce!  OMG  At $14 for a lunch item, it's great to share -- everything tastes great, everything gets eaten, and your wallet doesn't explode at the end!  Everyone I know who has tried this dish has loved it.  I've posted some pictures of it.  Try it sometime!"
Karen Y.,"Mansfield, TX",6,10,,2.0,7/26/2015,"I visited this location last week when a group of us were visiting from DFW for a nursing conference. Our plan was to meet for happy hour and then stay for dinner. The drinks were good but pricey. I have never seen a restaurant screw up appetizer orders so perfectly. One order after another was wrong. It was almost comical. Needless to say we did not want to risk dinner! No apologies, no service recovery, no acknowledgement of a problem. I suspect this location suffers from poor leadership. As we were leaving I noticed a clue. At 5:30 in the evening (prime happy hour time) the place was almost empty. I am a BJ's fan and frequent them often at home. However, this location will never see me again. They lost out on a dinner tab for eight hungry nurses!"
Christine A.,"Austin, TX",861,1069,1200,4.0,9/11/2011,"Who names a restaurant ""BJ's""? I know that most men are thinking what I think they are thinking when they walk in the door. The guys I went with joked about it in the parking lot.  ""Great, I want one for dessert!""  ""I'm getting one for an appetizer!"" Sigh. So initially I knew it was going to be a macho place.  And it was.  Many flat screen TVs are positioned high on the walls for optimum viewing. But, like many sports bars, music is piped in through the sound system so don't go to actually listen to a game.  The dining room is spacious with partial walls separating tables, booths and the bar and high end finishes in browns, blacks and neutrals. Service at BJs is timely and gracious.  Though the BJs were not. Beer is the star on the menu and beer is on everyone's mind.  Other than the BJ's. For a brewhouse, the food is surprisingly good.  The guys enjoyed a delicious Mediterranean deep dish pizza and the girls had salads.  My BBQ Chicken Chopped salad with shredded chicken, black beans, corn and jicama was great.  I love it when someone else does the chopping and I barely have to chew my food.  I'm lazy like that.   I will be going back because hubby will want to go back.  Not for the BJs, mind you, but for the beer."
Dan L.,"Austin, TX",97,160,56,5.0,2/1/2014,"Jessica, our wonderful server, I am so sorry we had to leave. You were great, the food was incredible, and thanks for getting my margarita frozen! I am sorry that the family with the screaming child ended my date night. We were hoping to try those spinach stuffed mushrooms but the child was just too much. You were great and I promise we will be back. Thanks"
Emily J.,"Austin, TX",2,38,15,2.0,6/30/2015,"Great food, terrible service. Every time I go to BJ's, the waitress doesn't seem to know anything about the food and they have messed up orders on multiple visits. Today I saw my waitress taking to her friends at another table for 15 minutes. We ordered 2 burgers and it took them 45 minutes to bring the food out. It wasn't busy in the restaurant."
James F.,"Austin, TX",0,81,,3.0,7/20/2015,"I used to go to this location all the time. It was great. Always clean, great servers, etc. I've always loved going there. But something has happened. I went there on a recent Sunday in July, and was surprised at how this location has slipped. The floor was sticky, and the restaurant had a less than clean smell about it. I'm sorry, I don't know what other words to use. I'll leave it at that.  The hostess who greets you at the door was less than friendly. Very standoffish, like she would rather be somewhere else. It wasn't even that busy.  Our server seemed to struggle with keeping up with her station. She was nice enough, but I think she had too much to handle.  As a place to go, I'll continue to go the this restaurant. But never this location again. There are better locations with better service. I wish this location would improve. I really would love to go back."
Irwin F.,"Warren, MI",0,278,5,2.0,2/9/2014,"Had a very disappointing visit. Auctioning off  food ""who had the....."" was a common phrase from the servers working our large group. No one came around to ask how things were or if the dishes were fine. The food was hit and miss. Some dishes were solid but others were not. The appetizers were just warm and cocktail service was ""beg and hope"" someone sees you and helps you. Spend your $ elsewhere - as this place seems to go through slow and unproductive motions."
Nathan I.,"Austin, TX",1997,455,3219,4.0,8/1/2011,"When Dillard's has an extra 40% off sale, you can bet I set aside the day to expertly comb over the Ralph Lauren merchandise to find all the best deals. I've never served in the armed forces, but this task is completed with military precision. However, before I could make it out to Lakeline to complete the Austin Dillard's Trifecta, I had to refuel in a big way. I figured now was as good a time as any to try the deep dish pizza that N and K had said that BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse was known for.  I never guessed they had a revolving door out front, since I never really grasped the size of the place when viewed off MoPac. The place is enormous; a slicker, pumped-up version of other chain restaurants with the added allure of doubling as a microbrewery. And while not as easily parlayed into cheap puns as 'Evil Wiener"", don't think for a second the name ""BJ's"" didn't have me giggling a bit. I may have used one on Facebook when someone commented on my check-in, though (Gary: I LOVE BJ's! Me: Who doesn't?).  My God, was it busy. This was a Thursday. You'd think the damned Super Bowl was on the way everyone was packed in like sardines around the bar. A bar, according to K, that uses hundreds of bottles of top-shelf liquor simply for show. Expensive items just for show? That's so up my alley. My little electronic beeper even had a note that said you could call ahead to put your name down as you leave the house. I guess that was for the days when EVERYONE in Austin decided to show up for chow, and not just half of the city like I witnessed.   The hostess said there'd be a 5-10 minute wait, which I found suspicious when she told the same thing to three other people who came in after me and absolutely no one was leaving the restaurant. I sat down on the only free edge of a bench to ride it out, even though a charming couple was taking up the enter thing. The man made a token movement down to give me more room, but the chick decided to remain splayed out. Keeping it classy, I see.  Once I was seated, the din of noise and constant movement didn't stop. Raucous groups of people were knocking back micro brews; a Paris Hilton look-alike and her super hot boyfriend were chatting; and three moms and about a dozen kids rounded out the table next to me. Apparently, BJ's attracts a lot of different people.  I began with a Tatonka® Stout -- ""A classic style so rich and flavorful that it was once the private beverage of Russian Czars....Beer doesn't get much more intense than this!"" It's delicious and tastes like Guinness. It also makes you feel you've just drank a loaf of bread.  It was an extensive menu, with token light fare. I started with the small bite version of the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad. On top of a nice presentation, the appetizer was surprisingly flavorful, with basil, red onion, Parmesan cheese, and a balsamic glaze that mixed beautifully. It's a nice, light appetizer to hold you over before a heavier entree. An entree such as BJ's Classic Combo deep dish pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms. The pizza is brought out and placed on a raised platform. It was cooked perfectly--not too crispy, and not too doughy. No one ingredient overpowered the other, and the cheese and sauce ratio was spot on. They were a little light on the mushrooms, but the Italian sausage was actually quite flavorful, and not just greasy little fat pellets like they can be. The waitress suggested a size ""small"" for one hungry person, and the portion was correct. A medium could be split, and I'm not sure how many people are meant to chow down on a large.  Thanks to their flashy slideshows by the bar, I was made privy to the existence of something called a Triple Chocolate Pizookie®: An obscene chocolate cookie made with chunks of Ghirardelli chocolate and topped with two scoops of double chocolate ice cream with Ghirardelli chocolate chips and a Ghirardelli dark chocolate square. Oh--it's chocolate, FYI, in case you missed that. I only ordered it because I love Ghiradelli, having visited the factory during a trip to San Francisco.  The waitress thankfully informed me that this dessert came in a mini size. Thank God, because what was described above would have sent me into sugar shock before the bill arrived. It may have skirted the line of decadence and tackiness just a bit, but you know it was awesome.  Our waitress was polite and seemed remarkably composed during what I can only imagine was a veritable sh*tstorm of activity. She and a couple other waitresses who brought me my food were all blonde, attractive, and somewhat interchangeable. No one missed a beat, though, and the service was punctual during the entire meal. I know that it's a chain, and it's a little loud and cramped, but BJ's pleasantly surprised me. I'd suggest it to fans of beer, pizza, and those who don't mind crowds.  At the end I was glad there was a revolving door. After THAT meal, you could have practically rolled me out. 4 Stars."
Mindy T.,"Austin, TX",49,32,2,5.0,1/24/2015,"So packed on a Friday, of course. My boyfriend and I didn't wait too long though cause I caught a seat that was free. :) anyways sat down and was quickly greeted by a friendly waiter! (Daryus) super cool and funny. Anyways since it was super busy our food too about 30 minutes to come out. 30 minutes was worth the wait! The food was prepared excellent and was executed nicely and how it should be. I loved how much food there were for only $21. 2 filling sides and a big sized rib. So I had to take it home. Usually I get the pazookie dessert, didn't have enough room:( but I can tell you it's absolutely delectable. The brownie is hot and ice cream on top melting is so yummy."
Paul R.,"Cedar Park, TX",76,548,60,3.0,5/16/2012,"My business guest spied the BJs restaurant as were speeding up Mopac to his hotel. He proclaimed that he loved this restaurant when he lived in Houston and that we needed to go there for dinner. Really, a chain restaurant noooo. But being open minded, I've never been there, and seeing that it was his treat I acquiesced. We arrived right behind a family with a couple of small children and I leaped to the conclusion that we would be seated right near them. Wrong, the hostess sat us in a booth by the bar and the ginormous TVs, cool. While looking over the menu and the interior I realized that BJs reminds me of the old 99 restaurants I used to frequent when I lived in Boston. A family friendly pub - restaurant with good but not great food.  Well the service was very good, our drinks were always full and our appetizers and entrees were served promptly.  My appetizer a house salad was pretty weak but passable. My dining companion ordered the tomato soup and he said it was great. We both ordered steaks and they were OK not great but fine. My medium rare steak was really medium to medium well but it was seasoned very nicely. My companion had a couple of their beers and he said they were good. Bottom line a good place to go with the kiddos or to have a few beers and a decent meal with the guys."
Lupita L.,"Pflugerville, TX",49,5,,4.0,5/4/2016,"Everything was really good , not the best piña colada I've tried but it was ok. They forgot to put the shrimp on my plate , i told my waiter and minutes after manager showed up with my shrimp for my jambalaya  yay!!"
tim b.,"Leander, TX",29,326,1,3.0,1/1/2014,three stars for the beer. Grand cru belgian - very nice and 10 pts ROH Some type of red - smooth and easy to drink two stars for the food. I asked our waitress if the Steak sandwich was a good choice.   She said that it was excellent.  Well the interior ingrediants were definately good if slightly overcooked - but the bread was a little stale and dry.  Not surprising for a chain but that worries me if this is considered one of the better things on the menu.
Kat M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",673,731,348,2.0,6/2/2011,"My hubby and I have been to BJ's down south numerous times and enjoyed it.  I decided to meet one of my friends at the new location for lunch.  It took almost 90 minutes for us to grab our ""quick"" lunch. Here is what happened.  I ordered the cobb salad and clam chowder soup.  He ordered the house salad with a spinach pizza.  When his pizza came, it was an artichoke pizza.  They had to bake him another pizza, which took forever.  I was eating my lackluster cobb (maybe my least favorite cobb ever) and feeling bad that he was without anything for so long. What really annoys me is that it was the waiter who rang in the order wrong and the manager knew about all of this and did not even comp my buddy's meal.  What is up with that?  Our waiter was super nice and we both did not want to complain, but afterwards we were annoyed.  This was going to be our go to lunch spot, but now I am not sure. It would have been nice customer service to have offered him another house salad while he waited, or an appetizer... Or comp the meal.  I feel like BJs handled this situation poorly. The hubby and I have never had any issues down south.  Maybe they are still getting things worked out at the new location.  Oh, and my salad came with the croutons I asked to not have.  This experience has left a bad taste in my mouth.  I hope management sorts these issues out.  A weekday lunch should not literally take 90 minutes."
Tony H.,"Austin, TX",81,269,53,4.0,12/6/2013,"It's always so hard to pick something to eat here, not because the selection is great, but quite the opposite.  There is so much good food here.  I stuck with one of my favorites which is the Fresh Atlantic Salmon.  Its always sooo good and the sauce is amazing. My only complaint is with places that don't advertise their drink prices.  I was a little shocked to discover my ""House Margaritas"" were a whooping $8.50 a pop.  I'm used to a house marg being in the $3 to $6 range, but to be fair they were pretty big.  The waiter also didnt seem very attentive to us, especially considering it was a party of like 10.  Oh well... I still enjoyed the food, drinks, and company."
Chris B.,"Austin, TX",341,376,26,4.0,6/15/2011,"It's big, it's loud, and it screams ""I'm a big chain restaurant!!!"" at the top of it's lungs.  But you know what... it's not a bad place.   We had a large party of 15+ people and we waited less than 30 minutes for a table, which was nice. The hostesses were very friendly and more than accommodating when our party unexpectedly increased in numbers.  It was a good start.  Our server was kickass.  He took orders efficiently, didn't mess anything up, and he was friendly to boot.  The kitchen had a few stumbles and food took longer than expected but the Manager stopped by and comped us a few items (as well as a few birthday desserts!).   We had appetizers and beer only during our visit, but I must say the apps are quite good.  The beer was sort of 'ho hum', but it certainly wasn't bad.  I would recommend the Santa Fe Spring Rolls, the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Piranha Ale Nachos.   The desserts were also yummy. I especially loved the Baked Beignet. It was warm and tasty with ice cream on top. I want some more of it right now.   So yeah, it's a big EVIL national chain... but if you ignore that stuff, it's a decent spot to grab some apps.    Pros: Very Nice Staff, Accommodating to our Large Party,  Apps Were Good, Service was Solid Cons: It's Huge and Loud, The Beer is Just ""Okay"""
Kirsten A.,"Austin, TX",180,27,2,5.0,3/13/2015,"Have been to a few different BJ's locations and have always had a great meal!  Enjoyed the California flat-bread the last time and this time was a delicious and healthy mediteranean chicken pita tacos. Refreshing, and gave me the feta fix I was looking for!"
John B.,"Round Rock, TX",86,260,89,3.0,7/13/2011,"I was very surprised at the quality of the beer and the fish tacos.  Everything tasted pretty good, and I have no concerns with the food. Atmosphere was nice - I'm not sure about the oversized barn they call a dining room, but it was very nicely appointed with artwork and lots of wood.  BJ's seems to be suffering from a mild identity crisis as it strives to be a grown up restaurant while still maintaining its bar feeling with many TVs.   My only real criticism is the reception area and the service.  They seem to have some odd computerized system that tells the hostess where to seat people.  I guess that is easier than just counting on her to do her job with training.  The waitstaff is hot-and-cold, and they still seem to be suffering some growing pains."
Anna N.,"Austin, TX",96,65,143,4.0,7/22/2011,"I am tempted to give this place five stars to counter the unfairness of all the low-stars reviews from when the place first opened (teething problem), or in extraordinary situations (party of seventeen!). We've eaten lunch here half a dozen times, all on Saturdays.  Food-wise, it resembles Cheesecake Factory: chain restaurant with a well-researched and well-developed menu with much varieties and very consistent.  Of special note are the flatbreads (see pic), and the tomato and mozarella appetizer salad (tomato, mozarella, lettuce, basil salad with a balsamic reduction dressing (see pic), for $2.95!!!).  The wings are alright, not outstanding (see pic);  it's tough to go wrong using Frank's hot wings sauce.  We've only had the roasted turkey Cobb sandwich (see pic): it's good but probably not a ""keeper"" for me;  the shoestring ries are great, though. The service is always just right, if only a little too friendly and too chirpy! I have not sampled any of the beers, yet."
