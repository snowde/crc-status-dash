Melissa N.,"Austin, TX",6,9,,1.0,5/3/2015,Came here for lunch today with my family from Chicago.  We were not impressed.  Food was not what I remember.  Pizza tasted like it was from Pizza Hut.  Mozzarella sticks had no cheese in them.  Mediocre bar food.
Jaime G.,"Chicago, IL",124,516,967,3.0,3/8/2012,"BJ's is a cool little place to have a decent craft brew.  While a chain, they do have a decent selection of beer and food.  Had the nutty brown and porter - both good options.  For apps, we had the wings (deep fried and served with no sauce - wing sauce and ranch served on the side) as well as these decant avocado rolls.  Really good. Would come back again.  3 Starts for good food but they are a chain."
Rob K.,"Austin, TX",306,382,754,3.0,1/30/2012,"Went on a Sunday night with limited choices, so ended up at BJ's.  For beers, I had a Harvest Hefeweizen (not a fan), followed by a BJ's P.M. Porter (big fan!). For meals, my gal had an ""Enlightened Entree"" (less than 550 calories); specifically, the Mediterranean Vegetable Pasta. And I had the Santa Fe Salad. The pasta did not look very good, nor was it filling as my very yummy salad was being pirated by the owner of the pasta. The Santa Fe was a delicious and huge salad with just the right amount of heat (from ground cayenne pepper) for me. While not a ""have to go to"" spot, it was comfortable and I will end up there again."
Tina H.,"Round Rock, TX",55,96,2,4.0,8/11/2013,"We generally don't go to chain restaurants here in TX because we want to fully experience the food here just having been in Austin for a year now but BJ's is always a safe bet if you want a clean place with plenty of TVs to watch in the bar area and decent food.  We often end up here if we don't have a specific craving for non-American food and just want something we can depend on and is close to home.   Some of our favorites: - Fish and chips - Spinach and artichoke dip - Chips and salsa (something about their chips is SO YUM!) - Grilled chicken club sandwich - Buffalo wings (bone-in) with ranch - Jalapeno Burger with bacon - Thin crispy fries - Pizookie with vanilla ice cream The service has always been pretty good at this location.  Doesn't matter what day or time we come, this place is always pretty busy which is a good sign."
Scott T.,"Austin, TX",869,245,638,1.0,3/30/2013,"Atmosphere is cool - but the food is pretty bad - calzones are supposed to have cheese.. Apparently they do not know that here? Also, waitress laughed when I asked the difference between specialty calzone and traditional... Not to mention a rude attitude to begin with... Rather have given the 40 bucks to the homeless lady at the corner of the street leading into the restaurant."
Ashlee M.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,3,,4.0,7/9/2015,"Come here with my husband a lot for weekend meals or the occasional lunch--have probably visited about 10 times.  The food is always above average and the service is overall good.  My personal favorite is the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad . . . it has all my favorite stuff.  If you want an overall good experience and a great place to get together with friends to watch college or NFL football, give BJ's a try!"
Linda V.,"Elgin, TX",35,5,,1.0,6/4/2015,They have the worst steaks. My medium rare steak came out blackened and well done. They did not resolve my issue and I ended up eating a baked potato for dinner.
Eric G.,"Norwalk, CA",43,16,,2.0,11/3/2014,Don't come here if you are picking up an order. This is the 3rd time my order has been wrong. This time they really messed up. The turkey burger sucks especially with the lack of tomato mustard mayonnaise and pickles that were suppose to be on it. They didn't even have the bake potato ready with my food so I had to wait for it. meanwhile my food got really cold but I was too hungry to make a big deal about it.
Lauren F.,"Montgomery, TX",59,158,31,3.0,10/1/2013,"We come because of the beer. The food is decent. This is your typical overpriced restaurant that serves pre-made food.  The menu is gigantic. They offer so many entrees and appetizers. No way any of it is fresh. I can't say that they have one thing that stands out more than anything else.  The beer is really good. They also brew seasonals, which is fun."
Ryan B.,"Austin, TX",30,40,,1.0,8/18/2013,"Used to be an ""OK"" place, maybe three stars when they first opened.  Went there last week for the first time in a year and a half since I moved back from South Carolina, pretty sure my dog was happier with her lunch that I left in her bowl. Ordered the half pizza/salad, pizza was stale and disgusting, salad was severely underdressed.  Seems like they are pinching and being a bit more cheap these days than in the past. Oh well, another stain chain."
Danielle Z.,"Austin, TX",50,81,15,4.0,7/6/2011,"I've been to the south BJ's location before (and one in Colorado) but I really enjoy this north one more for some reason.  My girlfriends and I went on a random Thursday around 6:45pm. The restaurant was surprisingly full, all the bar tables were full, and there was about a 10 minute wait to be seated which wasn't bad at all. We were promptly taken to our table which wasn't a booth but didn't feel like we were exposed like it sometimes feels when you're in the middle of a dining room. Our server was a little soft spoken but, in my opinion, hit all her marks in offering drinks, apps, etc. The girls and I were in the ""trying"" mood so we opted for quite a few things! Oh and we were there in time for happy hour which were a few bucks off beers and cocktails but none of that struck our fancy that time. First, we got a sample of the Berry Cider (hard cider!) and decided to get a pitcher of that. It was very delicious and tasted like berry champagne actually! Then we shared the appetizer sampler of mozzerella sticks (standard), spinach and artichoke dip with tortilla chips (actually very very tasty), avocado egg rolls (not bad), and the santa fe egg rolls (yummy).  The menu is very extensive but all looked great! I would find it hard to believe if someone didn't find something they liked here. So, our app plates were all cleared away and it actually took a little while for our entrees to come out but it wasn't too long that anyone said anything- but I know the girls were all thinking it too. I got the fish and chips which were tasty but were a little over fried (they were fried past the golden color and were a little more brown). I opted to try both fries- the thin and the wedge and both were good. The wedge fries reminded me of the fries from KFC. My friend got the parmesean crusted chicken and white cheddar mashed potatoes and she really enjoyed it and said they were some of the best potatoes she'd ever had. My other friends split the Mediterranean pizza and said they loved it as well.  After our food was boxed up by the server tableside (nice touch), we ordered dessert. We split the oven baked beignet topped with strawberries, whipped cream, and a side of vanilla ice ceam. We also shared the red velvet cookie thingie (the actual name escapes me) which was also topped with ice cream.  By the end, needless to say, we were stuffed, satisfied, and probably had a pretty happy server since she probably wasn't expecting 4 girls to give her the ideal ordering experience from top to bottom!  All in all, I liked the food, the atmosphere is high energy, and there were all sorts of peole- couples, groups of friends, families, business associates, etc. I'll definitely keep BJ's on my list of places to take all of the above mentioned parties when in a bind!"
Nick M.,"Medford, MA",0,11,,5.0,5/25/2015,"Great food, great beer, great service. We had Marlie at the bar, she was courteous, prompt with service, and knowledgable about the many beers on tap. Of course, she also allowed us to sample beers before buying a full pint. The meal - pork chops with home made mustard - was excellent, the best meal I had in Austin during a recent week long business trip to the area."
Nikolas T.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,3.0,2/24/2016,"I did not appreciate tall guy (I did not know his name) who waited our table. He was impatient. I felt pressured to hurry to read the menu to order. It was only few minutes after I ordered a drink. He come over several times. I kept telling him I will be ready in a little while. He should have shown the courtesy to wait for me to call him over when we are ready to order. It took a while for pizza order to be ready. A cook came over to apologize for mishap with pizza. He or the cook staff accidently dropped pizza. And, asked me if we would like salad. I assumed that will be at no cost because he apologized for pizza mishap. When we are ready to check out, I looked at receipt. Charge for the salads were on the receipt. There was communication misunderstanding.  After the experience at that location, I do not think I will return to that place again. The whole meal end up costing more than I expected with half off offer for pizza."
MacKenzie M.,"Bossier City, LA",37,4,,4.0,4/6/2015,"Got take out last night pretty late and even though it was late and they were probably all tuckered out from a busy easter sunday, they were still in great spirits and the take out presentation was phenomenal. Plus, everything tasted great. Will be back!"
marc s.,"Austin, TX",96,149,15,4.0,2/20/2013,"Our favorite wednesday night happy hour spot. If you just order whatever, you'll get what you get. But . . . here's the rules 1. Tatonka Stout: unbelievably good with a 9% alcohol kicker, if they happen to be out (rarely) so are you 2. Flatbread pizza: goat cheese is excellent as well as the more traditional types 3.  Pizookie: chocolate is excellent. For happhour, 2 Tatonka, flatbread pizza, shared pizookie and generous tip runs you $20. Hit these 3 and I dare you not to be happy. If you order anything else, it's russian roulette."
Son N.,"Houston, TX",147,84,800,3.0,6/13/2013,"BJ's love the name but when I walked in it was a letdown of sorts... It's clean, the bartender was nice but there's just something that screams mediocrity.  When I walk in the feeling of a forced hello is deposited on my ear drums. Perhaps they were having a bad day but I sensed no feeling of joy. I had their version of Guinness at the bar and felt ok with it. Nothing too bad but it wasn't great.  I ordered a burger and it was ok as well. This place is good but not great. But oh well... it met the minimum requirements.  A-OK indeed."
Steve W.,"Round Rock, TX",620,113,117,5.0,9/25/2013,"Southwest Egg Rolls and Tortilla soup are outstanding!  Great environment, Service is always good.  Have not been disappointed at any of their locations so far.  That is a well run restaurant chain!"
Andrew H.,"Austin, TX",41,13,,1.0,3/4/2016,I sat at the bar once and a server come up and crowded me to flirt with another person at the bar. When I tried to say something to management when I was leaving the guy the server was flirting with got right in my face and threatened me and the staff just stood there and watche.
Biswajit G.,"Austin, TX",0,4,,1.0,3/4/2015,"Pathetic service , spent $100 on food, but neither the food nor the service was worth it !! Will never visit or recommend."
Kristine C.,"Austin, TX",36,10,4,5.0,4/11/2014,"I go to this place almost every week.  They're a chain, but it's much better than Cheesecake Factory.  Also, there isn't usually a long wait, staff is very professional and food is great.  I especially like their new Enlightened menu choices.  The only place I know that has a pretty decent barbecue bison burger.  My favorite is also the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi.  It's also pretty family friendly for a brewery and bar b/c the booth tables are the perfect height for my 2 year old to sit without needing a booster seat.  The rewards membership is also great for getting money off meals or free desserts.  I recommend the Baked Beignet.  It's hands down better than any of the pizookies they try to push on you."
