Robyn S.,"Austin, TX",64,18,,2.0,12/30/2012,"Sad sad sad. I used to eat at B.J's when I lived in Southern California and I remember the delicious food,plethora of beers and the infamous pizooki. At the Austin location only the latter two survive.    We ordered  take away so this may influence the weight of the review but it was truly awful. I ordered the fried shrimp,I got some teeny tiny,chewy over fried shrimp that would be more easily passed off as Long John Silvers' rejects (btw not Gulf shrimp either but farm raised in Asia)The ""boneless chicken wings"" looked like the chitlins at the bottom of the popcorn chicken pile. I think the salads had a single cherry tomato and half a slice of cucumber. My man had the fish and chips and it was the only thing in the whole order that was not completely deplorable but even it was soggy and greasy. Not bad for $50 huh? Save your money and just go for an overpriced beer and the pizza-shaped cookie thing."
Kiwe M.,"Cedar Park, TX",6,41,6,1.0,8/8/2012,"People with Food Allergies Beware!  My daughter and I went to BJ's to get some lunch - we are both allergic to egg. So before going I looked up their food allergy menu on their website.  I found something that said it did NOT contain eggs. When at the restaurant we told our waitress of our allergies and confirmed again the food we were ordering was safe. About an hour later we both start to get SICK!! Sick sick! I called up the manager of the restaurant - asked him to confirm that the food we ordered was free of any egg. He checked and came back to the phone saying ""it contains EGG WHITE"" WTF? With hardly an apology he tried to hang up the phone. I called him out and he then apologized profusely and offered a refund. Oh geez - thanks for my money back now that we are SICK!  We will NEVER go back to BJ's and recommend that anyone with allergies or sensitives beware. If you cannot trust their corporate food allergy list or the staff - who can you trust. Terrible Terrible Terrible!"
Robert L.,"Austin, TX",32,17,2,1.0,1/13/2013,"I ordered takeout from here because I assumed for the high prices it'd be a sure thing. Wrong. My fried shrimp were tiny, hard, and nearly inedible. The boneless chicken wings were more like glorified chicken Mcnuggets and laughable considering the price. Oops. Won't make that mistake again. If I want subpar, dispassionately-made food in the future I can get it for cheaper at Chili's or Crapplebees."
Cody F.,"Austin, TX",128,9,,3.0,1/20/2015,The food was great at this place but where we were seated the table was attached to the wall and was vibrating non stop none the least it was very disturbing but because of how busy it was there was nothing i could do about it. The first beer i ordered the glass was cracked and didn't realize it till the beer was leaking out all over me. wasn't 100 happy but will give this place another shot sometime soon.
Charlie G.,"Surprise, AZ",2,34,3,3.0,10/31/2013,"I've been to this chain in several cities in my travels and never really had much to say other than its basic food you can get at TGIF and the likes. The waitress made the experience pleasurable she was very attentive and even though I went off the menu so to speak she never flinched.  I ordered the Bison BBQ burger basic without the BBQ sauce just the bison lettuce tomato, onions and nothing else. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and very delicious. Good food good times, my guest also commented that their food was very good. Guest one had a pizza the other had fish and chips all came out perfect......kudos to the cook."
Sue E.,"Cedar Park, TX",4,17,,1.0,8/23/2014,"Went to BJ's for lunch for the first and last time with my husband yesterday. 1)  The food is overpriced, and low quality for what it is.  $12.75 for a chicken caesar salad.  The chicken was cold, which I am totally okay with, but the caesar dressing was straight out of a gallon container.  It was too salty, and I'm pretty sure it was poppyseed dressing and not caesar. 2) My husband got clam chowder.  He said the potatoes were hot, but the clams were lukewarm.  The soup was not hot, and too thick.  ""Pasty"" is what he called it. 3) Inattentive staff.  We waited forever at our table before our waitress came over to take our drink order.  We waited nearly 5 minutes after that before our iced tea and water came out.  The place wasn't that busy for noon, either.  She never came back until it was time to bring us a check, which she did while I was still eating.  She never asked if everything was to our satisfaction."
William T.,"Pflugerville, TX",8,4,,1.0,6/24/2012,"Oh man this is the only time we will ever be here.   just gonna make this simple cons: 3 plates were ordered two of them salads.  one salad was sent back.  it took more than 20 minutes for the manager to come talk to us and apologize and even longer than that for the salad to come back.  20+ minutes for a reorder? on a salad? service was so-so and food really didnt make up for it.  waitiress didnt even ask if we needed refills on our alcohol.  i was looking for this place on their website and i couldn't even find the location on their own website.  it only gave me the one in sunset valley  pros: atmosphere was nice, my food was okay and my water refills were sufficient."
Casey S.,"Austin, TX",111,176,155,1.0,9/10/2014,"Went here today for lunch with co workers for a first time. Had a very rude waitress who seemed very uninterested in her job. My pizza was soggy and cold and my salad was warm? Not sure how you accomplish that. I ate the food anyway, reluctantly. I wasn't back from work for 30 min before I was in the bathroom hugging the toilet. Had to leave work early. All in all it was a terrible experience and I must say I will more than likely never go there again. I guess that's what a fellow Austinite gets for eating at a chain restaurant lol."
Meghan B.,"Austin, TX",8,3,2,4.0,12/13/2014,"Brett, Riley and Nick rule this place. Go to them if you need anything. They have lots of good beer on tap, bar is great, service is good if you go through those I mentioned before. Yay for bjs."
Melissa W.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,5.0,1/23/2015,"Last night was my first time to BJ's.  The food was delicious. My husband and I both really enjoyed the fried artichokes, the corn fritters, and our entrees.  I ordered the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos, which were totally awesome.  My husband ordered the jalapeno burger which he also really enjoyed.  The service was fantastic.  We will definitely return on our next date night!"
Kalanit K.,"Austin, TX",0,10,3,1.0,1/12/2016,"terrible service. Food was nasty. Took forever to get our food and some of it was cold (chicken, pizza) . We had to ask someone to heat it up. thought BJs was a great place before this...."
Lucy V.,"Austin, TX",16,190,352,3.0,8/14/2014,"Very similar to Cheesecake factory? What you'd expect at a major chain restaurant that basically serves everything!  I had salmon it was fine. Nothing amazing, a pricey safe choice."
Chris P.,"Spring, TX",8,4,1,4.0,10/25/2014,The food was great! Waiter was nice but the wait staff was abrupt and unattentive.  Their house brew was tasty (piranha pale ale). We had a build your med pizza that was served perfect temp and taste good too. I would come back if ever in the area.
Rosco T.,"Round Rock, TX",1,35,1,2.0,10/9/2013,Food is very average. Calzone was bland and small. It reminded me of a hot pocket. Service was below average. The Waitress was polite but inattentive. The beer was good.
David A.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,25,286,1.0,7/27/2013,"The place is nice , but I had the classic burger & the buns were too thick . The burger tasted more like bread then meat. I didn't like it. I will never come back ."
Lori A.,"Hutto, TX",2,70,15,2.0,10/16/2012,"My first time to a BJ's, and I was not very impressed. The place was almost empty about 9 p.m. on a Sunday, and you would think we would have received amazing service because our server had no other tables. Unfortunately, that was not the case. Our server was abrasive and, the majority of the time, just simply not around. Lack of service aside, the food was OK. Fried cheese was some of the best I have ever had - it really was exceptional. I got the Cajun Pasta, with blackened chicken. The blackened chicken was awful - the seasoning did not match well, the ""application"" of the seasoning was odd. The whole ""blackening"" of the chicken seemed like an after-thought. The pasta itself was cooked well, but again the seasonings were off. The flavors seems disjointed in the entire dish.  I may go back and give them another chance - but maybe a different location. I was not impressed at all."
M F.,"Pflugerville, TX",1,82,41,2.0,1/23/2014,"Don't be fooled by the atmosphere, revolving doors, and upscale uniforms... this is actually a dressed up Applebees with ridiculous prices, crappy service, sulky hostesses, and pitiful food that is way over salted or under seasoned.  You're greeted with ""Are you a member of our loyalty program?""  ...What is this, Kohls or a car wash service??  Then when you say no, they go ""oh... please have a seat."" Terrible margaritas too!!  & tell that girl with the high sideways ponytail that people aren't paying $12.50 per wine glass to look at that mess.  Thanks.   -Patron"
J P.,"Austin, TX",25,110,1,3.0,11/17/2012,Service was friendly.  But slow but they were very busy. Food was ok.  Appetizer was very lacking. We ordered mozzarella sticks. They were border line cold.  Everything else was decent.  Will probably give them another shot.
Megan M.,"Austin, TX",13,27,4,2.0,8/24/2014,"This was our third visit to this restaurant who won our business by being in a shopping center and convenient to our route home. The service was pretty good but sadly we were  quite disappointed with the food. My husband got a turkey club which was average but he felt that some how there was way too much salt incorporated in it. I later checked the nutritional information and found it has over 3000 mg of sodium! I had the chicken pesto sandwich which was on their ""light"" menu. The sandwich was extremely  overpowered with red pepper flakes in the pesto which made it incredibly difficult to eat I left over half of the small portion on my plate because of the bad flavor. Pesto, Chicken,Red Peppers and Mozzarella are usually a no brainier choice for me. I'm sorry to say we will not return due to the low quality of food."
Christina M.,"Austin, TX",1,1,1,5.0,10/9/2013,I had the best service by a beautiful almost white long haired female. She was so sweet even when some one sitting next to me skipped out on the bill. Mad props to her for keeping it cool and still being awesome!
