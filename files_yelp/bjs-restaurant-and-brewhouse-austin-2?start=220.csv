Austin C.,"Austin, TX",444,33,15,5.0,8/10/2012,"This is my second time to go to BJs and the best is the flatbread pizzas with a salad which was filling to me. I was not too mindful about the TVs or the brewery. However my parents did order the Chicken marsala and it was PERFECT! compared to Cheesecake when leftovers are taken home... it results in a really not so cool leftover. However when noting perfection it was pasta being al dente, veggies with ample chicken breasts. My mom had a lighter menu entree the Mahi Mahi which was good and the fish was perfect also. When joining as a their rewards member it was worth the email perks and guests to be able to redeem for some awesome rewards."
Tony W.,"Plano, TX",0,20,,2.0,12/27/2013,"Went here with a party of 5, and only 2 were pretty happy with their orders. 2 people ordered steaks with steamed veggies. The steaks were cooked to order but were only warm when served, definitely not ""hot off the grill"". Much worse, the veggies were barely cooked. Some people like broccoli, carrots and cauliflower raw, but most people prefer them fully cooked, especially on your dinner plate. The server was apologetic, but the damage was done. Probably won't return to any BJ's anytime soon."
Andrew B.,"Austin, TX",84,266,,4.0,12/8/2011,"Made my first trip to BJ's today with a couple co-workers. Even though they were on the lunch rush, we were seated right away. Hostess was friendly and attentive, and so was the waitress. We even had the manager stop by our table to check on our meal and bring us some more water. As far as the food goes, I had a lunch special of a half baked potato and a cup of soup. The half potato is huge! I would not want a whole one. The clam chowder was some of the best I've had in recent years. My dining companions had salad, pizza and chili. They both had good things to say about the food. The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is upscale casual. It's more like a really nice Applebee's. Cover Three has similar decor, if you're familiar with that restaurant/bar. BJ's is definitely a great addition to Arbor Walk and I know I'll be eating there again."
Melise L.,"Austin, TX",27,47,7,3.0,6/26/2011,"They have a spiral bound menu so it's pretty extensive.  Also, there are pictures which I like.  More often than not if there are pictures on a menu I'll just point and grunt when asked what I would like.   --Their snack size Caprese salad is pictured so I got that to start.  It was SO good.  The mozzarella balls were super fresh.  When you combine cheese and balls, you better make sure it's topnotch or else you'll go home aching or with chlamydia. Most likely both. That was $4.  --I then got the fried artichoke.  Usually ""fried fill in the blank"" is good anywhere and this didn't disappoint.  It's quartered artichoke hearts breaded and fried and come out in a little pile with lemon garlic aioli.  It was a little lemon-y for me.  Kinda perfumey in a way so I am gonna ask for ranch next time. These were $3.  --I also got two mini barbacoa tacos. The corn taco shells were the size of a large cookie, and the meat was tasty (I know, I know that's what she said).  They were $3. I think the service is on the over-eager side, but somehow negligent at the same time.  That ain't easy to do.  I think they are staffed with friendly people who are sometimes hindered by the new computer system. And management probably gave them a ""be friendly, we're new kids in town"" talk.  I kinda like it, though I recognize this can be suffocating to some people.  I like when if I'm spending money at your establishment, you are nice to me."
Kate  G.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,2/5/2015,"I will never be coming back to BJ's again after my last experience.  Over the holidays, my parents came into town and we made a reservation at BJ's due to its family-friendly atmosphere (we had a 2 year old and 6 month old in our group). Our server appeared to be high and had a lot of trouble getting the order straight with our table. Ok, whatever, this is Austin - as long as the food comes out it will be fine. The appetizers and drinks came out with no issues.  When the food came out, ALL but one order was incorrect. (We had a party of 7). None of the pizzas had sauce OR tomatoes. The one vegan pizza that was ordered was covered in sausage. The two year old's macaroni and cheese took about 40 minutes to come out and his fries never did show up. A manager came by to apologize about the macaroni and cheese taking so long, so we took the opportunity to let her know that all of the food came out with errors. Instead of apologizing and fixing the issue, she argued with us. 'The sauce is baked into the pizza.' We tore the pizza apart to show her, no, there is no sauce and the deep dish pizza promises cooked delicious tomatoes. She then took about 10 minutes and came back with an ice cold cup of ice cold chopped salad tomatoes. Again, never apologizing for our completely ruined dinner. No one but one person was able to eat their dinner in the restaurant. She re-made one of the deep dish pizzas into a thin crust pizza to go and came back and acted like she did us some big favor (even though it was not asked for and was not what was ordered).  I could go on and on, but the unprofessionalism of the manager alone was enough to never bring me back. They took some money off of the bill, but considering that no one was able to eat and our entire evening was completely ruined, they should have waived the entire bill.  I emailed corporate to let them know how things are being run at this location and was sent back a standard form email with a $25 gift voucher attached - even though I will never use it and never ever go back. I strongly suggest you go anywhere else.  This restaurant would be great if they didn't have so many staffing issues and incompetent rude people. Too bad. I would give zero stars if I could."
Samantha S Y.,"Austin, TX",38,81,27,4.0,10/24/2011,"They have a great Gluten Free menu and the first time I have ever seen a gluten free desert (Brownie with ice cream) on any menu...I'm watching my diet so I didn't order it but I'll save up and try it next time.  They also have several gluten free beer options, I tried the fruit one and wasn't impressed but I'll try the others the next time I go. Lot's of TV's kept my hubby happy."
Jamie P.,"Barboursville, VA",0,11,,4.0,7/4/2015,"We had the chicken potstickers and pepperoni extreme flatbread pizza....delicious! I also tried the draft root beer and was quite happy with it. Great service, as well!"
Joey M.,"Austin, TX",19,126,5,4.0,5/6/2012,"BJ's is a great place to go when you want above average, consistent food and don't really want to think about where to eat. The menu is strong all around: good salads, pizza, wings, burgers, and just about anything else you could want.  The beer menu is large, offering both in house brewed beers and others on tap. Prices are average for a brewhouse. Be careful about going here during peek times, especially on weekends. The wait can get long. The place sports a ton of flat screens, so it makes a great place to have a meal and catch the game. The staff is generally attentive and helpful, although we did have a newbie that was so nice it was borderline scary. It is great to be pleasant and friendly, but no one can be that happy working food service. Prices are reasonable, but you can spend a bit if you do appetizers, beers, and dessert. Go late for happy hour (after 9) to save some money."
Tim C.,"Georgetown, TX",1,46,4,2.0,7/16/2012,"""BJ's"".  Come on.  A worn out formerly funny cliche from the 1970s. ""Brewhouse"".  Liar liar pants on fire. In a pinch, I hoped this would be a place for ""Suburban Factory Food the Safe Mom"".  Nope.  I would rather have spent my money at Chili's or McDonald's.  And with the size of the building, I was hoping too for at least a halfhearted effort to have beer served that was actually brewed on-site.  Nope. Service was slow and borderline of poor, the portions were smaller than I expected, and the beer was good but overpriced.  The fried chicken --with a scant plop of gravy-- tasted similar to Chick-Fil-A so one star there. From Wikipedia:  ""The BJ's Restaurants Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to support charities benefiting children's health care and education, with primary focus on the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. ""  So another star there. =2 stars.  Moving on..."
Stefanie Y.,"Austin, TX",127,70,8,4.0,9/27/2011,"Service can really change your perspective.  In this case, our awesome server Lindsay made me add the extra star.   Tonight my husband and I went to BJ's and sat in a ""Tooth"" (our word for half Table, half Booth).  We were greeted immediately by Lindsay.  Let me tell you, she was genuine, knowledgable and suggestive without being pushy. I was a server for many years and she definitely had it.  Chatty, but not too much so.  Friendly, but not fake.  She definitely made our experience. But on to the food....What did we have to eat and what did we think? Avocado Egg Rolls: I love me some avocado and egg rolls.  So I have to love this, right?  Meh....  A little bland.  Wasn't too sure what the dipping sauce was, but all in all the dish felt like it was missing something. Fish & Chips:  My husband's food... He said it was just okay. I snuck a bite and thought it was pretty good.   Parmesan Crusted Chicken:  I was super excited about this, but wasn't too crazy about it.  I NEVER add salt to my food.  But I did here.... it just was lacking a little flavor.  Unfortunately, I also received literally 3 or 4 small heads of broccoli, so I felt like I didn't really get the full serving. Overall the food was good, but not necessarily worth the price tag.  But the service was worth every cent.  Other servers have alot to learn from her."
Jason H.,"Austin, TX",2,126,,2.0,11/7/2014,"It's ""Chili's"" on steroids.  The façade is a little nicer, the prices a little higher, and some of the home-brewed beer options are pretty decent, but in the end, you're basically just getting sub-par fried food, chain-restaurant style."
Colleen C.,"Austin, TX",0,13,,5.0,7/31/2014,"Great service and food!  Our waiter Kittrick was super attentive, friendly, and professional. And the food (salmon with cherry chipotle glaze....mmmm!) was delicious! Overall great dining experience."
Steffi V.,"Norwood Acres, TX",17,45,3,5.0,11/23/2013,I went there for dinner today for the first time & loved it! Had the pulled pork sandwich & it was massive. It was also super delicious :) my mom had fish tacos which she also enjoyed very much. Will deff go back. The service was great!
Robert G.,"Round Rock, TX",394,360,1,3.0,5/18/2012,"Ok is the first thing that comes to mind. I had the Ca burger and a Thai chicken mango salad. Both, were good. I'd not complain about it but I wasn't floored. I'll eat here again, I found the burger was tasty and the mix of avocado with chiles was nice. The beer selection was ample and overall the place felt like a grown up Applebees maybe? The salad was light and the mango paired well to lighten the dish. Good. Reading other reviews it seems like their food is consistently good from item to item and I wouldn't be opposed to eating here again. Nothing made me want to rush back immediately but it's...ok."
Jeffrey M.,"Austin, TX",14,94,11,5.0,8/27/2011,"I am rating this restaurant 5 stars only because you cannot give it 5MM stars. I was headed to Mighty Fine but the wife was not having a burger.  So we ended up at BJ's --- up north --- first timer. Experience --- literally perhaps the best dining experience of that genre in my entire life. Restaurant is nicely done at a high but not obnoxiously level of finish.  Clean crisp and brewery like but very nice w/ lots of booths.  I love booths. Service --- Matt Bowman --- perfect.  Not good, not great, perfect.  Undoubtedly the best waiter I have ever been served by.  Un - freakin' believable.  I am going to have to hire this dude. Fabulous food recommendations and then the promises were met and exceeded. Ice cold home brewed root beer.  Brewed on site.  Fabulous. In an ice cold mug. The experience was so good, I literally cannot express myself. I will be back time and again."
Amanda G.,"Austin, TX",3,15,18,5.0,6/6/2014,"We always love us some good BJ's! This one was great, as they all seem to be. No wait at 1:30 on Friday. Had the avocado egg rolls, Asian salad, and crispy jalapeño burger. All were great. The burgers are HUGE so don't fill up on appetizers. Clean and friendly. Go!"
Scott T.,"Pflugerville, TX",69,205,4,3.0,4/9/2012,"We have been to BJ's a few times and have enjoyed something different each time. Recently, I sat at the bar and enjoyed a personal pan pizza and a few beers. I can't remember what the beer was called but I do remember they have seasonal selections that change at a good pace.  Great Bar scene but it also has a great dinnerarea for date night!"
Dave I.,"Pflugerville, TX",49,17,4,4.0,10/9/2012,"The atmosphere is a big plus here, its beautifully built and very slick.  The food, so far, hasn't dissapointed either.  Last two times I sat at the bar and the tv is huge, great spot to watch the game or games, they will sometimes split the screen into four sections (great for the Olympics).  The pricing is high though, even with happy hour, so be prepared for that.  Last time I went I sampled a beer and they gave it to me in a broken glass, I had to spit up the beer and the glass shards I almost swallowed.. the manager stopped by after to apologize, however I was suprised the didn't comp a single item, bad form."
Michael J.,"Austin, TX",194,108,13,2.0,6/29/2011,"BJ's is one of my favorite chain restaurants.  This one isn't.  I've been to this one four times.  The first time, if I had never been to BJ's, I wouldn't have returned.  It has gotten progressively better, but it's still really behind the 8-ball when it comes to what I expect when I visit BJ's.  The last visit was the first time our orders came out right, although out of order.  The appetizer came after the main dishes. I have a lot of hope for this BJ's as it's the only one local for me.  I've been to the one in Cupertino by the Apple campus, and the one just north of Dallas.  It's a good chain and deserves better than the portrayal this one brings."
Owen P.,"Austin, TX",3,14,2,4.0,5/22/2011,"TL;DR: Good food, variety, lots of beer, sort of high prices, get there early. This is more like a 4.5 star review because I feel the prices need adjustment. We went at about 5:30 PM on a Saturday of opening week. We were seated immediately, but by about 6:15 the lobby was packed. You might want to call ahead, but this might change as the new wears off. The booth seemed a little small, but the dining area wasn't crowded. It was quite noisy though; don't expect an intimate date night. There were plenty of kids there but I'm not sure I'd call it kid-friendly. It was noisy enough people might not notice a loud kid though; that might be a plus. The menu's big and is all over the place. Pizzas, burgers, salads, fish; it was kind of like The Cheesecake Factory only not quite as bewildering. The pizzas look interesting, but I decided on a Pirahna Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger. My wife got some kind of cajun pasta dish. Neat tip: you can nix the chicken and go shrimp-only on some dishes even though the menu doesn't say so. Maybe we paid more for it; I didn't check. The cheeseburger was a true knife and fork affair; it was served open faced because no way could it be eaten like a normal burger. I found it quite tasty and prepared well, though the chili was much better than the burger part. My wife's pasta dish was a pasta dish; it's hard to get blown away by pasta. I was born and raised in Louisiana and no one ever seems to get that ""Cajun"" means ""spicy"". Portions were big; my cheeseburger was too much and my wife had 2 meals from the leftovers. This balances the prices; I paid $10 for a chili cheeseburger with fries and hers was maybe $15. Service was OK considering it's the first week. Some of the waitstaff seemed inexperienced, but everyone seemed nice and willing to please. I was *just* starting to think it was taking a while to get my food when I heard my waiter complaining to a manager that we'd been waiting a while, then the manager apologized. They were *busy* so I wasn't concerned; the food showed up shortly afterwards. I'm not a beer snob so I'll leave those reviews to someone else. I got the Pirahna Pale Ale and liked it, but my wife's Jeremiah Red was better. They've got a list of brews that the restaurant makes and they range from a few lights to some stouts and porters; there ought to be something for everyone. It cost us $40 to get two entrees and two pints of beer. I think it probably should have been more like $35 and could have done with smaller portions to offset it. I'd like to try a pizza and see if those are worth the price. My only regret is I got so full from the cheeseburger I couldn't order one of the pizookie desserts. It's a cookie in a deep dish cooked like a pizza smothered with various ice cream toppings; it reminds me of the Cookie Monster dessert at Cheddar's. I'll be back for it. I'm not sure what could make this a 5-star restaurant. The food can't get much better without higher prices; trying to make it quieter ruins the sports bar atmosphere; lowering the prices doesn't really offset either of the two. I'd say I walked in expecting a three-star experience and I got a little bit better than 4. Exceeds expectations."
