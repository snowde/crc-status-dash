David R.,"Austin, TX",3,62,,4.0,1/25/2012,"The food is solid, and the beer selection is first rate. Belgian, British, US specialty, you name it, BJs has it. In my view, it is over priced, so I only go here when I'm in the mood for some good beer. If I'm just looking for a decent casual restraint, I avoid it because of the cost. Great place for guys night out, though."
Fahad N.,"Austin, TX",6,4,2,3.0,7/8/2012,Food is just ok. I like the creole tilapia and tomato basil soup. Going to try my pizzokie now. Last time i want there my soup was luke warm and when i asked for fresh pepper the waitress got it after i completed the soup and just slammed it on my table and walked away. I was surprised by her behavior. My creole tilapa was undercooked and i asked them to take it back. they got me a new one which presented in pathetic manner.A portion of tilapia was lying on the side of the plate. Was not impressed by their service. only plus point they are open late and decent place to grab food after 10 pm
Ryan S.,"Austin, TX",102,49,1,4.0,9/22/2011,"My girlfriend and I tried BJ's tonight.  We asked the waiter why it seemed so similar to Cheesecake Factory.  He told us that the current CEO of BJ's used to be the CFO of the Cheesecake Factory.  Well, it definately shows.  The menu is massive, the bar has rows of liquor bottles just like Cheesecake Factory, and the staff is knowledgeable and courteous.  The dining floor is laid out with medium size walls that make it possible to have a private conversation in a crowded room.   We tried the avocado egg rolls, the seared ahi tuna, the crispy fried artichokes, the spinach stuffed mushrooms, and finally the Italian Market Salad.  I enjoyed the house blonde beer and my girlfriend had a chardonnay.   Overall, we really thought that the restaurant was outstanding.  The food was great, the price was reasonable, and the ambiance is nice.  We highly recommend the Italian Market Salad, the Seared Ahi Tuna, the Crispy Fried Artichokes, and the house blonde beer."
Erika G.,"Santa Fe, NM",0,2,,1.0,5/9/2015,"Wow...what a place. Where to begin? So I took my family to bjs for an early mother's day dinner. The 1 star is a generous rating that I'm only ok with giving since my grandmother was the only one fully satisfied with her ribeye steak. My sister ordered a turkey sandwich which had sour tomatoes and ham, she choose not to finish her meal. My boyfriend ordered mahi mahi, bland, dry and small portioned. My mother the mahi mahi tacos she was unimpressed. I ordered the house sirlion medium rare... Apparently this is foreign meat to bjs. The ""steak"" was tiny and over cooked and they forgot to load my potato....a nightmare that was just beginning, they took back my meal only to later bring me just a loaded potato...this was my meal. Then came another steak and potato, this time the meat wasn't even a steak more like a dry hamburger patty. Round 3 the meat again was questionable, I cut into it and no juices...plus the meat looked brown.,..meanwhile the potatoes wouldn't stop. At one point my boyfriend had to go find our waiter and beg for the potatoes to just stop coming. The 4th steak at least wasn't over cooked...BUT rare as hell. So i just gave up, enough was enough. Plus there was no toilet paper, my mother had to use toilet covers. That was my first and last visit to this over priced and poor portioned establishment. LEARN TO COOK MEAT!!Ted (waiter) get out of that train wreck of a restaurant and earn better money elsewhere."
Tenessa V.,"Austin, TX",3,3,,1.0,10/1/2011,The food was good however the person who cleaned the plates off the table stole a wallet and the server screwed up on the bill twice the last time i went i use to go there atleast twice a month before and never had any problems there deep dish pizza is awesome however do my last experience i seriously doubt i will be going there again
Carolynn B.,"Austin, TX",0,4,,1.0,6/10/2015,"TERRIBLE. Terrible service, terrible food, and the waitress rolled her eyes and popped a 'tude when i asked if they had gluten free beer. I wasn't annoying or rude, just asked.  AND they messed up a baked potato. IDK how you even do that. i will never ever go back. Oh and in case you thought the crowd was gonna be young and exciting, i was probably the youngest person there by 30 years."
Robert S.,"Pflugerville, TX",58,67,,1.0,2/10/2013,"I have always liked BJ's and have dined at several around the state. No matter which one I go to my order comes out wrong half the time. Once I ordered a small pizza and got a REALLY small pizza. About four inches across. The waiter said he misunderstood and ordered me the correct size which I wasn't charged for and gave me a small salad while I waited so I could at least have something to eat with the rest of my table. Another time I was asked if I wanted the shoestring fries or the wedge fries. I got the kind I didn't order.  Today I ordered the open face Pot Roast sandwich and that is when seemingly all hell broke loose. Here is the menu description: ""Tender Angus beef pot roast slices are served on a toasted garlic cheese French roll and topped with white cheddar mashed potatoes and mushroom brown gravy. Served with oven roasted vegetables."" My waitress asked what kind of fries I wanted. I double checked the menu to see if I read it right and showed her that it came with veggies as it already had mashed potatoes. I asked her why I would want fries on an item that already came with potatoes and she just shrugged and said, ""You never know.""  Now here is where things get complicated. If a menu item says a dish comes ""with"" something that means in addition to right? Catfish WITH coleslaw. Hamburger WITH fries. Am I not right? The server brings my food MINUS the veggies after what I had just gone through with the waitress. I call him back and he says he will go get them and brings them to me a few minutes later.  This should be the end of the story but no. He makes a point to return to the table presumably to ask me if I liked the veggies to which I responded in the affirmative. He then makes a big point of saying he's glad and that he was going to ""take care"" of them to make me happy even though they don't come with the meal and that in fact the veggies mentioned on the menu description were already included on my plate. What was he referring to? The mushroom gravy on my potatoes? The celery garnish? The handful of shredded carrots? Had he just shut up when he brought me the veggies I wouldn't be writing this. Yes I know the customer is always right but he made a big point of saying I was WRONG but he comped me the veggies that should have been included in the meal to begin with just to make me happy. Big man! you gave 20 cents of ""free"" veggies. Happy now? Way to go! Make yourself look superior to a customer over a cupful of veggies that cost next to nothing.  Had I accepted the offer to SUBSTITUTE fries for my veggies I guess it would have not been an issue but asking for something that was already included in my meal seemingly makes me a problem customer to the employees.  I emailed the management saying they need to amend the menu description from just, ""Served with oven roasted vegetables."" to, ""Served with oven roasted vegetables and a free double helping of grief from the restaurant employees."" For the record the sandwich was delicious but I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have because the attitude of the employees left a real bitter taste in my mouth."
Lauren G.,"Denver, CO",2,65,4,1.0,8/1/2013,"Just ate shrimp tacos and almost immediately felt dizzy and sick to my stomach..... You guys need to cook fresh food, that was $10 thrown to the trash!"
Antoinette G.,"Austin, TX",427,244,2,4.0,7/16/2011,Our first time there was on a Friday evening a little after 5:00. It was already bustling with lots of people. The atmosphere was very nice--they have really nice big booths with granite tabletops.  The menu is huge--takes a long time to figure out what you want--everything from salads to sandwiches to pizzas to regular entrees.  We enjoyed our food and thought the prices were very reasonable. The service was excellent--our waiter was very efficient and friendly.  We will return!
Barry C.,"Georgetown, TX",89,328,,5.0,7/15/2011,"Just for happy hour. Fast review, great service for a table of 16, good drinks and an amazing mini pizza for half price. It was packed from the time we got there(5:30) till we left(8:00), so you might have to wait to get a table or even a seat at the bar."
Katon M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",6,12,15,3.0,6/17/2013,Great place. Good beer. Gets busy at lunch time.
Korey A.,"Austin, TX",117,224,7,3.0,11/11/2011,We went there after a UT game.  My dad was not very impressed with his burger.  He thought it was over cooked and a little bland.  My brother and I shared a pizza.  The pizza was thick and pretty tasty.  It could have used a little more pizza sauce.  I don't know that I would go back there again.
Kristina B.,"Pflugerville, TX",98,96,109,3.0,5/29/2011,"I think I can like this place.  The food is nothing spectacular, but it seems like it would be a fun place to watch a game.  We first attended the soft opening with its short menu. I hated it. Because I am vegetarian, I had one option, the Asian Chicken salad minus the chicken. It was awful, but not because it was gross, but because it is not something I would ever even order.  I did, however, fall in love with the mash potatoes on my boyfriends plate.  I don't think I have ever had such delicious mashed potatoes in my life. So it was worth a second chance.  I kept it generic today  with the veggie burger and fries and yum! I wasn't disappointed.  The portion was huge so I saved half for later.  Boyfriend had chicken fried steak with the same heavenly mashed potatoes and steamed veggies.  His plate looked good and he finished it all up, so thumbs up. We tried one of their deserts, I don't remember what they call it, but some sort of pizza cookie. A chocolate cookie + Ghirardelli chocolate squares + chocolate ice cream= Chocolate Coma. The desert was definitely decadent and rich, not something you can eat every day, but definitely worth it.  Our server was nice, but not very helpful.  I think we had three different people bringing our food and water, so we were never lacking anything.  I can't really say much more about the service.  Next time I go back, I think I will ask for a plate of mashed potatoes and maybe some veggies."
Sondra S.,"Austin, TX",166,95,6,4.0,1/2/2012,"I am sick sick sick of all of the usual choices.  There are so many restaurants that are so meh as to be unmissable, and the ones I do like, I'm bored with, so I was glad to see another choice pop up relatively close to home. We've only been once but the food and service were good and fast even though they were pretty busy (we went the day after Christmas).  We would go here again!"
K S.,"Austin, TX",164,19,80,4.0,9/4/2011,We were there for the Grand Opening. They gave out free food and it was great! The place was very nice and they have a full bar! They even make the beer from start.
Jennifer P.,"Austin, TX",59,103,2,2.0,6/11/2011,"This might be a good place to get a few beers at the bar. But it wasn't a great place to get a meal. The kitchen has no idea what it's doing and the place is so poorly laid out that you have to ask other diners to scootch and press themselves into their tables in order to squeeze through the dining room. We had a table of 7. The shrimp lettuce wraps tasted ok but were really hard to eat (bad filling-to-lettuce ratio). The ribs were overcooked and tough. The ahi tuna had been seared at some point, but must have then been put in the fridge, because it was icy. The gluten-free pizza with extra cheese, came with hardly any cheese at all. Also, their gluten-free crust is herbed, which is a weird choice that I didn't like -- it overpowered the other flavors in the pizza. But the worst was my friend's dinner -- he ordered the salmon with spinach instead of rice. His plate came with rice, and no spinach. So he asked for the spinach, and a while later he was presented with a bowl of broccoli. Um, that's a vegetable and it's green, but still not spinach. By the time he finally got his spinach, he barely wanted it anymore. Not to mention that his fish smelled like it was slightly past its prime. The only food on the table that anyone loved was the broccoli cheese soup. We had one server who took our orders and checked up on us, and she was great -- the only positive aspect of our visit actually. But when the food was delivered, every single plate was brought to the table by a new and different person. I'll never understand that style of food service -- it's annoying to have to play air-traffic-controller with the plates and tell 7 different people where to place each plate. This style of service also held true for drink orders -- especially entertaining was the server who couldn't tell the difference between a pint of beer and a pint of raspberry cider. (Wow, really dude? The pink one is the beer? Really?) So, bad food, inconsistent service, and a dining room you have to squeeze and shimmy through just to move through it? No thanks."
Hannah C.,"Austin, TX",2,15,,2.0,6/20/2011,"Biggest menu of mediocre food ever. It's overwhelming. We were there around 9pm on a Friday night and had a small group of three. After taking forever to narrow down what we wanted, we ordered and then our waitress came back to tell us that 3 of the things ordered were out (we ordered appetizers and some side things to share). Seriously?! Why have such a HUGE menu if you aren't going to keep things in stock? After a little more time we finally were able to order and then the food was just meh. Nothing to really go back for. It was really loud and busy, so it took a while to get our stuff and all around we were unimpressed. SO bummed! I will say that the waitress was awesome. She checked on us often and made sure our drinks/beer needs were met. Not a place I plan to go back to any time soon!"
Monica Nelson R.,"Round Rock, TX",68,3,6,5.0,1/12/2012,"I really like this place. The food is great, there are big screens with sports everywhere, and the beer is really good. My meal was the Pizza (Italian) and the French Dip both of which were Awesome..yum!!! Can't wait to go back!"
Alex R.,"Austin, TX",286,31,1,3.0,6/13/2011,"Went there for the first time yesterday for lunch. The good: the place is huge, nice decor, has flat screens everywhere if you want to keep up with games, getting seated took no time - great with a toddler. Plus, a very deep, diverse menu with a lot of options, including a full slate of options for kids. It's family friendly in that way. I didn't have any this time, but they have a nice selection of micro brewed beer. The bad: the prices are a bit steep, so it can't just be your neighborhood weekly place, since it is a bit overpriced. They have a ton of TVs so when we walked in, I asked the bartender if they could put one of the TVs on the Astros-Braves game and she said she would but never got around to it.  Maybe it's because it's a chain, not sure why, but our server was over zealous. As someone who used to wait to tables, it's always better to check too much on a table than too little, but we couldn't even get a bite of food in our mouth before the server was in our faces asking how the food was - ""don't know, haven't eaten a bite yet - it just arrived this second"" - was my response with both the appetizer and dinner. In addition, when you're dealing with a toddler, if you look at him and ask him if he wants ""chocolate"" he will say yes - which is why a good server should be thoughtful of parents and look at the parents and simply ask if we want dessert - we had to cut our server off in mid sentence since we knew our son would create a problem being offered chocolate and us having to say no. Not OK for the server to go past us just to try and make a buck.  The manager was a nice game and came over afterwards to check on us so overall, they are friendly, but they could relax a little more & have their servers tamp down their upselling and overzealousness.  In addition, while the adult meals they brought us were good and had nice presentation, my son ordered mac n cheese and it was clearly the same 'instant Kraft' we could make him at home.  Overall, I'd go back but they need fix a few things."
Ann K.,"Austin, TX",53,137,6,1.0,7/19/2013,"The ""gourmet"" mac and cheese was some of the worst I've ever had. Yes, worse than school lunch. Imagine sticky cheese and noodles drowned in milk, with way too much salt. Somebody needs to learn to make a white sauce, or just stick with velveeta if it's too much trouble. My stomach didn't feel too good after either."
