Cindy O.,"Austin, TX",0,90,1,5.0,5/27/2011,"Well not sure about the other reviews but a new location opening can have its ups and downs. It's a Friday night so I had to wait about 50 minutesbut the food was very good as I remember of BJ's. The fried artichoke appetizer was crispy, crunchie and wonderfully complimented by the side of lemon alioli sauce and a cold brew. My mini pizza was awesome. I have always enjoyed this restaurant from my days living in San Diego. Try the deep dish cookie desserts......oh my! Did not have that tonight but have in the past and it is sinful. A special mention to my server Brad. Prompt, personable and did a great job. Never met him before but ask for Brad next time you go to this BJ's location."
Anh P.,"Austin, TX",120,312,1,4.0,10/28/2011,I've eaten here only twice or so and honestly can't remember if it was good/great or average. I can say that every year I come and drink the DELICIOUS PUMPKIN SPICE BEER! Just try it!!
Chris P.,"Austin, TX",1,22,,3.0,4/18/2012,"BJ's is one of the most OK places to eat that I can think of. The service is friendly but can be slow or forgetful at times. Other times it's - not really a big deal either way. I've eaten there 3-4 times and every time my entree has tasted fine, but it hasn't been anything special or worthy of eating out. There are tons of better options for every type of food on the menu. The most disappointing aspect of BJ's is that their personally hand crafted brews are subpar to everything else they have tap. Fortunately, what they have on tap is a reasonable selection of good beer. The ahi poke appetizer is really good so I'm happy ordering that when I go. The other times I keep trying out new dishes hoping to find something really enticing. The pazookie is an above average dessert too considering how many of them they probably make. I like the TVs here, but it's not really a place I'd watch a game at.  So yeah, BJ's is alright at every level. I don't dislike eating here, but I don't really enjoy it either."
Jared M.,"Aurora, CO",27,34,5,3.0,6/25/2011,"This place has a huge menu of okay to mediocre food.  It's almost as if several people collaborated to make a restaurant and the criteria was, ""what's your favorite restaurant.""  After about ten people named their favorite they made BJ's and jumbled up a menu from those ten restaurants.   That leaves you with a variety of mediocre but far from stellar food.  Thus the three stars.   There are however, five star worthy highlights to this place.   1. Their beer selection is outstanding and their house brews are very good.  My particular favorite is Tatanka Stout which every time I see that name I have to start quoting Dances With Wolves and thus I rename the beer buffalo stout.  This place has the beer selection but not the great food to go with it.   2. They actually have a very good Tomato Bisque.   3. I am fishing for a third here but the wait staff is annoyingly helpful.   Overall I have decided this place is where I will go to eat an adequate soup and salad and enjoy fairly good beer."
Andrew C.,"Round Rock, TX",303,107,18,4.0,5/22/2011,"I haven't been to a BJ's in ages and I was excited to try this new location out with a few buddies of mine a few nights ago for some happy hour. We arrived at about 6:30 and it was completely packed. We somehow managed to grab a table after just a few minutes of waiting, but for those wanting to beat the happy hour rush, I recommend arriving early or visiting during their late happy hour.  It took a little bit longer than expected to find someone to greet us, but it's something that happens with any new restaurant that opens up, so it wasn't that big of a deal (hopefully this will improve as time goes by). Our waitress was very nice and was definitely trying her best. They had a nice selection of beer - my favorites were the hefeweizen and the blondie. I ordered the mini pizza (pepperoni, sausage), which I had to say was quite hearty and satisfying. The pan crust was crispy on the outside and had the warm, buttery texture on the inside. We shared a huge sampler appetizer plate which also had some good eats. I don't think there was anything really wrong with the place, except the food being greasier than I'd like it to be. The inside environment and decor is trendy, but it doesn't feel Austin. I'll definitely come back again, but based on my overall experience, I'd have to give this BJ's location 4 stars."
William Z.,"Round Rock, TX",25,171,2,4.0,7/1/2011,"My son said to make sure we ordered the bacon cheeseburger pizza and that's what we had.  It was terrific!  The deep dish crust was cooked to perfection!  Had a ""Nitwit"" beer that complimented the pizza perfectly.  BJs is a welcome addition to the Austin restaurant scene."
Christina P.,"Pflugerville, TX",73,103,10,2.0,6/29/2013,"I came here for lunch and it was a comedy of errors.  Things started off well and then shifted after my coworker and I ordered.  She has a lot of dietary restrictions and in the process of the staff working to meet her requests it all went to hell.  Not only did they mess up her requested changes (so they had to redo the order) but my order (which had no modifications) was completely held up and delayed.   The amount of time from when we ordered to when we finally got our entrees was absurd. The manager tried to help in getting her order correct but not much changed.  It felt like the manager, waitstaff and kitchen staff were not communicating.  At the very least, they weren't communicating much with us.  A bright spot was the chocolate pizzookie.  I would go back for that alone. It was decadent and fabulous.  I am going to give BJs another try and hopefully my second experience will be better."
Texas F.,"Austin, TX",0,23,,2.0,3/7/2015,"The less-than attentive waitress really ruined a birthday lunch for a friend and I. We ordered a shareable appetizer, then decided on soup & salad for the main entrée. Coffee arrived first without enough condiments; the waitress was gone a long time as coffee cooled. When she finally did return & inquired about our order, I said she would get that when we got more sugar & half 'n half for our coffee. Placed the order and within five minutes here comes the salad, on its heels the delicious chicken tortilla soup (my favorite), which were served by other waiters. Again, our waitress (Abbie) pulled a Houdini. One of the waiters provided us more dressing for our salad. Then ""Abracadabra!"" here comes the appetizer. HA! My friend and I laughed at how ridiculous the service was as our soup cooled quickly in the wide-mouth, thick-lipped serving bowls. We sent the appetizer back; I asked for the manager, who appeared in time making lame apologies but not making any attempt to fix things. After his appearance, the waitress gave us the cold shoulder. One of their ""Pizookie"" desserts is offered for birthday customers, so my friend ordered one. It is an oversized cookie baked into an aluminum pan and served with a couple of scoops of ice cream. The dessert arrived and the dough was raw, not completely baked. It was sent back; the manager reappeared, saying, ""That's how we make it..."" as we wondered why would a restaurant serve undercooked cookie dough? I advised the manager to make it right and comp the soup. The full-baked Pizookie arrived later; our coffee was cold and the waitress made no attempt to offer more. After we finished what we wanted of the dessert, the aloof waitress swept by. without asking if we were through, and took away plates. When she brought our bill, I advised her to take it to the manager to get it right; he discounted my friend's meal and the dessert was ""on the house"" as her birthday gift, I suppose. All in all, it was really a very unpleasant dining experience, and after being treated so shabbily by the BJ staff, we won't be back anytime soon."
Gretchen D.,"Austin, TX",21,72,2,2.0,2/17/2013,"I was disappointed.  We went at 5pm on a Saturday, as we usually go out early because of our 2 year-old. Earlier usually means fewer crowds and faster service.  Well, it  was not extremely crowded, but the service was SO slow. Initially, our server came fast and was very pleasant. But once our order was in, it took at 45+ minutes to get our food.  I ordered the deep dish pizza, which was far from deep dish (I now read another review here stating their experience was the same - wish I had seen it before ordering!). It was basically a regular pizza, with slightly puffy crust. And upon our server stating that the small one was in fact really small (less than 6""), I opted for the next size up. Yes, it was enough, but it was NOT worth the $15 price tag. My husband got a steak (which he loves to do wherever we go) and said it wasn't great. It looked pretty charred on the outside, even though the inside was the right color. (The only upside was the baked potato with everything on the side came with nice chunks of what appeared to be fresh-cooked bacon, although it didn't have a lot of bacon flavor.) My brother got the jalapeno burger and it looked yummy and big. In the midst of conversation, I didn't get to ask him how it was, but it didn't look like he had complaints. Perhaps the burger is the way to go.  Overall, the prices are way too high for the food quality. It's decent food, but not worth the $60 bill (before tip) we had for two meals and a couple of beers."
L L.,"Austin, TX",0,135,15,2.0,2/6/2012,"CONS weak beer (their brand) Lame veggie burger with ""steamed"" toast, wilted lettuce, (I guess the plate was stil hot from the sanitizer when they added my food to it) and pickle-sized tomatoes (though they did give me four of them). Few veggie options...and the menu is a spiral notebook of choices. If they are going to have so very many options, could there be some veggie and vegan things besides a burger and pasta marinara? Cold potatoes Undercooked green beans PROS two french fry options the thin/crispy fries are quite good the atmosphere is very nice; love the bar lights the TVs are nice the tap list (not the BJ's brand beer) is long our server knew the menu well and could answer questions -1* for no customer WiFii. ...specially in a place with so many TVs for sports. I still want to check other scores, fantasy teams, Tweets, etc. I'd actually give them 1* after deducting for the absent WiFi, but nothing ""bad"" happened, so I just can't be that harsh. I might come back to watch a game and have a non-BJ's beer, but I doubt I'll order food here, again. This place just didn't leave us with ""happy ending""...."
Edward P.,"Austin, TX",9,30,31,1.0,9/6/2013,These is nothing good to say about the food. It will fill you up but leave you regretting your decision to dine here.
Richard M.,"Austin, TX",13,91,6,3.0,6/9/2011,"Well despite all the complaints about the service, our waitress was quite attentive and our drinks were never dry. The only mistake she made was after we finished our first beer she asked if we were ready for another round, we said yeah and reached for a menu. Before we had even picked it up she was already gone. We wanted to try something different but we wound up with refills of what we had already had. Not a real big deal and that was the only mistake. The good: They have an excellent beer selection and a fairly broad food menu. The bad: Nothing I'd really call bad. The indifferent: Although fairly nice, it DEFINITELY has a sterile, corporate feel, although far better than that sorry Brick House place up the road.  I had the Cajun pasta, it was not very impressive, about what I'd expect from a chain. Certainly not bad, there just wasn't anything all that special about it. I had their porter and their stout. The stout was the better of the two. Their porter is nitrogen conditioned, which is something I don't really care for and if I'd caught that before I ordered I probably would have skipped it. The stout was far more satisfying but certainly nothing out of the ordinary. Even if I find their other in-house brews as average as the two I've tried so far (I intend on finding this out with another couple visits) they have many other beers I am familiar with that are very good."
Carrie S.,"Austin, TX",204,63,127,4.0,6/16/2013,"First time here. We went at lunch when it was starting to get busy. Sat at the bar top. No waiting. Our bartender, Joe, was quick and attentive. Explained the brews to us. I chose a seasonal Belgium. My boyfriend with the brunette brown. Mine was a little hoppy if you like that. The brown was very smooth. We decided to go with a variety of appetizers. We had the tomato bisque, BBQ chicken chopped salad, stuffed mushrooms and the mac and cheese.  Our least favorite was the Mac and cheese. The 3 cheeses and bacon with bread crumbs was good, just a little dry. The mushrooms were yummy. The salad and bisque were the highlight of the day. The bisque was creamy and delicious. I would order both of those again. We signed up for their members perk program. They also have special dinners with highlighted beers. Looking forward to attending one soon."
Holly B.,"Austin, TX",0,17,,4.0,4/23/2013,"I like to come to BJ's as a treat, or whenever they're doing their 2 for $20 special (2 people - salad/soup each, 1 pizza, and a pazookie, GREAT deal). The beers are good, the avocado egg rolls are heaven on a plate, and their pizzas/sandwiches are pretty decent too. All in all, it's a little too much on the expensive side for me to come here often, but I always feel happy with my meal, beer, and the service whenever I do."
Ricardo G.,"Austin, TX",255,331,10,4.0,8/20/2013,This one is a very nice place. I like the food and it is cool just to look at everything that is in there. Great place to hang.
Sam B.,"Philadelphia, PA",73,431,108,3.0,8/13/2013,"Like the many different types of beer and drinks to choose from, and this location is not usually crowded. Food is ok too, lots of options."
Nancy S.,"Austin, TX",18,14,,3.0,11/30/2011,"So i ate here with a friend before going to the movies. it was 6 oclock ish, which is usually the dinner rush, and it seemed pretty full but we were seated pretty fast. The menu is pretty big, for drinks and food. We both ordered the Irish red beer which was pretty tasty. My friend ordered the santa fe salad which looked pretty loaded and delicious. i ordered the bbq chick chopped salad. His looked way better than mine... Full of avocado and veggies and a good dressing.. Mine looked like a bowl of shredded iceberg lettuce with a few pieces of chicken and random pieces of corn. i was kinda disappointed.. Someone else's review of this salad said it was awesome and delicious, so maybe they were having an off night? Although we also split a side of the mac and cheese and the cheese was watery, didnt really stay on the pasta. Our server was friendly, cant complain about anything there. She did check on us a good amount and stayed on top of drink refills and such.. Atmosphere, good. Service, good. Food, ok."
CJ M.,"Elgin, TX",0,5,,5.0,1/28/2014,My family loves this place.  Has a vast selection of food and drinks that are good to the taste buds. Kid friendly with a very large childrens menu. Would recommend this to anyone.
Jenny P.,"Pflugerville, TX",1,19,10,4.0,9/11/2013,Visited here Sunday 8/11 and had a great experience. I have been to BJ's before and honestly was underwhelmed both times. This visit was great and I believe our server was Cameron. He was awesome from start to finish and the gluten free pizza was just what i was craving.
Nick C.,"Pflugerville, TX",2,107,,3.0,7/24/2013,I have been to the Arbor Walk and the one out in Round Rock near the outlet malls.  This place is good but a bit pricey for the portion size.  The food was served warm and tasted well prepared.  The feel is very much California-ish.  The booths can be small and some of the tables are oddly placed but it is ok for a change of pace.  When you go you can play like you are in a real city in California and not in the hinterlands of Texas. Be nice if one of the televisions wasn't play sports and the noise leevl was addressed.  All hard surfaces and the place can get very loud.
