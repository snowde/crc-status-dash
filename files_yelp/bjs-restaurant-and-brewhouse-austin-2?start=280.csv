Gabriel D.,"Austin, TX",40,19,2,4.0,7/20/2011,Just on a whim we thought we'd try BJ's for lunch and were pleasantly surprised. While the place was pretty packed we had plenty of space and our waiter Chris was right on time and helpful in every way.  Everything was served timely and perfectly at temp. While we peeked at the regular prices (that seemed kind of high) the lunch prices were actually pretty decent. There were even handcrafted beers on drought for only $3.  All together I think only spent about $21 for the two of us including some very yummy beer.   The food portions were smaller of course but more than filling and very delicious. We'll definitely be back for lunch again soon!

Dawnielle A.,"Austin, TX",32,19,3,3.0,6/26/2011,"Today was my second time going to this brand new place in the Arbor Walk area.  The first time my boyfriend and I went during lunch. They have a great selection for a lunch menu. The soups are excellent! But what got me the most is that our server didn't know anything about the menu. I would ask the server what comes on the wedge salad (because I am a huge fan of wedge salads) and she replied ""I don't know."" The first thing I learned as a server or any position in the restaurant is to know your menu so you can sell it. The server couldn't sell me on anything. Again, today was the second time being there. The hostess was very friendly; however, told me that I could sit at a high top if I wanted to. It was just me and I don't want to take up a table that could sit 6 people. I asked if I could sit outside. There really wasn't a wait which was really cool. In the shade it felt fabulous! The person who escorted me outside was very friendly and helpful. I completely thought that he was my server. He was kind enough to get me some water while I wait for my server. That was very sweet of him! However, my turn-off about this place is that I sat outside for over 5 minutes with no one to greet me. I read the entire menu twice and was ready for a nice cold beer. Many servers came outside and not one said ""Someone will be right with you."" I could understand that if someone did say that but they didn't.  I went to go talk to the manager not looking for any handouts. I just wanted to let him know about what kind of service I got so he can make his restaurant better. He was super nice and pleaded for me to stay. I told him that I wasn't into it anymore but don't worry I will be back.  I will be back and I hope my next server will know what they are doing. I tell you your tip can be whatever you really want it to be if you just pay attention."
Jon C.,"Austin, TX",43,34,1,4.0,2/26/2013,Awesome service! The manager and server checked on us even with a busy floor. Our drinks were always full and our appetizer and food came out quick! I told them I was under a time limit due to being called into work and they did a fantastic job! I had the Shrimp Scampi and will be back for more!! Thanks guys!
Adam M.,"Austin, TX",67,130,38,4.0,2/20/2013,"Good service, yummy food, good beer, very minimal wait-time.  I will return."
Art C.,"Hutto, TX",235,100,51,3.0,1/13/2013,I had a good burger on their second try. The first one was incredibly salty. They promptly remade my order and it was fairly enjoyable. I would go back and give them a second chance. Good beer.
Hillary H.,"Austin, TX",3,4,2,4.0,5/18/2013,My boyfriend & I came here for the first time the other day. The burgers were in our top 10 faves. We liked the sampler of beer you could try. Pretty nifty. Our waiter was also weird yet friendly. I liked it. We will come back here!
Bill S.,"Austin, TX",1,6,,1.0,10/10/2011,"Atmosphere was nice, but the food was awful. We ordered Crispy Fried Artichokes and Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms as appetizers. The artichokes were awful and tasted like the vinegar brine that low-end canned artichokes come in. We couldn't eat them. The mushrooms were thoroughly bland and had no flavor at all. I had ice tea and my wife ordered a marguerita. She said her drink tasted like it had been made with ice in a blender rather than in a frozen marguerita machine. She said it barely had any taste other than ice.  I had the Tuscan Chicken Limone. I chose a minestrone soup. The soup looked and tasted exactly like Progresso's canned minestrone. The entree tasted like it had just been warmed up in the microwave. The pasta did not appear to be fresh. The artichokes in it tasted just like the ones in the appetizer, a heavy brine taste. I couldn't eat them either. It was supposed to come with fresh steamed baby spinach. There were only 3 leaves of it on my plate.  My wife had the Brewhouse Blond Shrimp. She had the broccoli-cheddar soup with it.  It also looked and tasted like fresh out of the can. The description of her entree suggested a lightly battered, tempura-like crust, very lightly fried entree. What came on her plate was very dark, deep fried, corn meal encrusted, barely edible shrimp. My wife ate two of them. I tasted one and didn't want another bite. The cole slaw was inedible; however the thin crispy fries were very tasty.  The service was adequate, but not exceptional. To her credit, our waitress took the artichoke appetizer off our ticket when we told her how bad they were. We are not restaurant snobs. We have favorite places, both chain and local. We like to occasionally try new places. We always hope for the best, but BJ's Brewery came closer to the worst. I would have considered the prices reasonable if the food had been tasty. It's too bad the food doesn't match the atmosphere of this restaurant. We will not return or ever recommend it."
Greg M.,"Austin, TX",1,7,1,4.0,3/24/2012,"Great place. We've come here dozens of times but it never gets old. Deep dish pizza is delicious down to the crust (My kid tried the gluten- free thin crust today, and it was superb!), voluminous salads (Italian Market Salad is awesome, others like the Garden Medley Salad are soggy and not worth it), terrific subs (I tried the Angus Roast Beef Dip, seriously some of the best stuff you can get), large variety of appetizers that are all equally unique and yummy... And don't forget the draft beer!  Service is usually great, although there are occasionally some dips. Huge TVs all around the vast room, just right for those sport fanatics to get enough out of their game while not so overwhelming for those who want a quiet meal.  One of my favorites. I will be back!"
Destinee W.,"Denton, TX",99,163,20,5.0,12/7/2012,"LEGIT... like too legit to quit; BEER is amazing; friendly service and from what i have had excelent food  meatball, alittle sweet but very well made as is the peice of bread it comes with  also the buffalo style chicken wontons (wowzza) and the were so price respectable. i know that this a chain but this place is great"
Maureen S.,"Greensboro, NC",18,35,8,4.0,3/3/2012,Great selection of beers on tap and knowledgeable bartenders.  I highly recommend the avocado egg rolls the garden medley salad.
Mario P.,"Katy, TX",72,164,370,4.0,2/4/2014,"Ok, I've been to a few BJs and when traveling , I often sit at the bar. Today was no exception. Brittani was my bartender and waitress in one . She did a fabulous job of taking care of me. Even when the kitchen ran behind on my spinach stuff mushrooms, she was able to fill the gap with great suggestions and timely visits to check. Though it did come out a bit late, the snack appetizer had a very good taste. I had a couple of beers to start, a Oasis ( BJs brew and a Stone Arrogant Bastard { love the name } and both were very good. Next I ordered the Limone Chicken Pasta dish based on her recommendation. Ok. Here's the skinny on this dish. The sun dried tomatoes and artichokes hearts in the dish, AWESOME, angel hair pasta, OK. Th chicken, I'm split on. I got 2 pieces and one was full of flavor and the other totally absent. I can't even begin to explain how that happened. The sauce was good. Oh , baby Spinach was ok. Overall the fish was a 3, service a 5 and beers a 4. Will I be back. Yes, especially if they keep great employees like Brittani around!!!"
Ryan A.,"Austin, TX",177,36,1,3.0,12/24/2011,"Generally speaking, I'm a very forgiving person when it comes to poor service and/or bad food. I'm a firm believer that everyone deserves a second (or in this case, third) chance to account for any unusual circumstances which are bound to happen in the service industry. Unfortunately, BJ's used up the last of its three chances today when a friend and I tried it out for lunch.  We arrived around 2:30 or 3:00 to a mostly empty restaurant and a very friendly greeting from the hostess and were sat immediately. We were greeted semi-promptly by our server who took our drink order and returned with  water (until my beer arrived) and a soda for my friend. He then asked me what I had ordered to drink because he forgot. Eh, it happens...no big deal. Five minutes go by with no beer. A few more go by before our server walks by the table and says ""What happened to your beer? They told me it went out!"" I jokingly say ""Where did it go?"" and proceed to speculate as to why my beer has now taken nearly ten minutes to find our table during lunch, when service should be much quicker than any other time of day. He left the table, went to the bar, returned to our table and told me that they were changing the keg at the moment. I attempted to order a different beer, in hopes that I would actually get it, but our server said that the beer I had initially ordered would be up when he returned to the bar. Finally, after at least ten minutes of waiting, I was sipping on a nice, cold, delicious beer. It was then that I decided that I would not be ordering another and that it would be best for me to make this one last throughout the duration of the meal. After the beer situation was sorted out, we went unacknowledged for a few minutes more before our order was taken. My friend tried to order a lunch item, which is only available Monday through Friday. Ok, fine, we didn't see the fine print at the top of the lunch menu...our mistake, but that doesn't change the fact that only offering a special lunch menu Monday - Friday is just plain silly. We ordered our entrees along with an appetizer and two salads.  Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock..... A stone-faced, emotionless server (not our own) arrives with the appetizer we ordered, sets it on the table, and walks away without a friendly greeting/salutation, or asking whether we needed anything else at the moment. Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock..... A manager arrives at our table with both or our salads in hand and greets us with a very friendly salutation, asks if we need anything else, and walks away, never once acknowledging the fact that his restaurant is running at the pace of a dead turtle. Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock..... Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock..... Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock..... Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock..... Our entrees fiiiinnnaaalllyyyyyy arrive at LEAST a half hour after we ordered them. Our server delivered our food and acknowledged that fact that they had taken much longer than they should have to come out and that he had alerted his manager, who was in the process of ""yelling at the kitchen"" for the long time order. Food quality is consistently okay here and both my friend and I were satisfied with what we ordered. At $13.00 per entree at lunch time, you get what you pay for. An hour and a half, and $40 later, we found ourselves asking for the check ASAP after our food was delivered at our table, since we didn't know how long it would take for it to be delivered. Strangely enough, it was on the table a minute or two after we had asked for it. Hmmm....?! On my previous two visits to BJ's (both during dinner), I've not had anything to be unhappy about. The service was as prompt as could be expected for a moderately busy dinner shift, our server was extremely friendly and skilled, and the food was good. Unfortunately, this experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and I can definitely see myself not returning. The ONLY reason I could see myself returning is because of their awesome beer selection. Sorry to say it, BJ's, but unless you get it together and significantly improve your level of service, I'll steer clear."
Rusty W.,"Austin, TX",1,7,,3.0,9/8/2014,"Yesterday was my second visit to BJ's, and I would have to stay it is a step down from my previous experience.  I was seated fairly quickly with my party of 10 or so, and my server was pretty good.  I tried my friend's hose made Root Beer, and I have to say it was excellent.  I ordered the bone-in New York Steak cooked medium, with a side of clam chowder and loaded baked potato.  The clam chowder came out first and I was surprised at the portion size, larger than expected.  It tasted good, but was nothing special.  The steak temperature was spot on, but the taste was bland, as if there were no seasoning, or if the seasoning was put on after the cooking, not cooked into the meat.  The only complaint I have about service is that I asked for the loaded baked potato, which in my experience comes with butter, cheese, sour cream, and in some cases bacon bits.  I only received the butter and sour cream, no cheese or bacon bits.  This was not a huge deal for me personally, but is important as a service point and in presentation.  I will be back eventually, but probably not for a steak."
Aaron L.,"Ventura, CA",15,18,10,4.0,4/15/2013,I always enjoy BJ's and frankly it is a great place to have some pizza and drinks. I am a fan of this chain of restaurants. it has a great atmosphere and staff.
Jim A.,"Austin, TX",3,50,,4.0,6/18/2014,"Food a little better than average, and a huge menu means you will probably find what you want.  Not a fan of the ""craft"" beers the sell and staff not familiar with the beer products.  Overall a good experience and will go back."
Janet Z.,"Pflugerville, TX",176,16,,2.0,12/14/2011,I have tried this restaurant 3 times- twice for lunch and once for dinner. The food is pretty good- a standout is the thin crust pizza appetizer-- very good. The service is among the worst I have experienced. Wait times are very long and they often do not bring you what you ask for until 2-3 times asked.  Would not return due to poor service.
Angelica S.,"Austin, TX",47,471,2,4.0,9/15/2012,"Bj's is a little pricey but the service is good and so is the food,  I recently went here with my family and ordered the fish n chips.  My husband ordered the grilled pork chops and I am ticked that I didn't order those instead! The pork chops are soooooo goooooood. I'd go back just for that alone.  yum!"
Sandra P.,"Austin, TX",22,7,3,5.0,2/28/2013,"OMG!  I love this place!  Love it, Love It, LOVE IT!  The food is awesome.  Portions are not so big that you feel like you are eating at a trough.  Just really good and delicious food.  The tomato bisque tastes like Long Island pizza ~ so help me, it is true.  Will be going back every chance I get unless something changes.....  Thank you, BJR&B"
Connie I.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,2.0,4/16/2012,"On quality of food alone, I would give this restaurant a 4, but given service is just as important to us, we give it a 2.  We've been 4 times now and service has been poor 3 out of 4. :( We won't be returning"
