Leslie P.,"Austin, TX",0,47,,5.0,9/2/2014,Love BJ's!  Everything I've had there has been good.  Corn Fritters rock and the tomato bisque in the sourdough loaf is the bomb.  I've always had good service (unlike some reviewers)  Only 1 time did I have an issue but it was resolved.  Great for lunch!  Have never been for dinner so can't comment.
Nibbler ..,"Seligenstadt, Germany",11,44,,1.0,8/7/2011,"C'mon people, this is Austin.  You don't have to spend your money eating aweful tastless food and washing it down with overpriced beer.  It's Applebees with a beer selection.  We immediately went to Draughthouse to wash the corporate taste out of our mouths.  One star for our waiter that was actually pretty good."
Aiden C.,"Austin, TX",28,16,5,4.0,7/21/2012,"I like the BJ's on MoPac. It is not a hipster hangout with live music and trendy drinks.  What BJ's has is consistent service, American comfort food, and drinks that don't contain lavender or elderflower.  My favorite cocktail, is the beverage named ""That One Drink"".  The drinks are strong, have good flavors, and don't require a chemistry degree to comprehend.  If you are looking for a place with lots of TVs to watch the game, a 20+ selection of beers on tap, and solid burger and food choices including several fresh salad choices, BJ's is a fine place to chill."
Christina F.,"Pflugerville, TX",10,2,,1.0,6/5/2011,"I ate here for the first time ever for lunch on a Wednesday. Everything was going good until one waitress brought out our appetizer. She somehow tripped another waitress walking by and I got a full glass of tea and a full glass of water down my left side.  I was drenched. It took the managers 5 minutes to come to our table and for someone to clean up the mess. When we asked for the manager to replace my drink which was in the line of fire and he asked my why. Seriously???  Since the mess wasn't our mistake, I was hoping that something would have been comped. When we got our bill, they only took $1 off each of our alcoholic drinks, so $2 total.  I went onto their website the next day & told them my frustrations with their service, its been almost 2 weeks and have yet to hear from someone. Will never go there again!!!!!"
Marisa P.,"Austin, TX",4,54,11,2.0,3/13/2014,"My Asian salad was great! The fries were tasty.  The calamari portion was a joke (literally about half the size as the menu depicts). My husband's burger with ""crispy friend jalapeños"" had one crispy jalapeño...the rest had no breading and no crisp.  The service was among the worst.  Their cider tasted like Boone's Farm taking me back to my underage drinking days.  No sign of a manager. Did I mention the service sucked?  Do yourself a favor and order to-go if you absolutely must try their food.  Their beer wasn't that great anyway."
Philip G.,"Austin, TX",5,55,,3.0,7/28/2012,"UPDATE 7/26/12 Had a not-so-great experience this last time.  We sat at the bar, and that was a mistake.  They make sure you know everyone's name behind the bar because they expect you to flag them down if you need something.  Maybe it's just me, but I expect a waiter or bartender to check on me, not the other way around.  As a result I had to wait a little too long to place an order and to get a refill on my drink. Maybe that's what led to the mistake that ensued:  I ordered a calzone.  I figured if the pizzas are really good, the calzones are probably just as good.  But first I was served the wrong order.  They brought me someone else's calzone, so obviously I sent it back.  I got the correct one soon enough, but it was almost half dough.  That was a big disappointment.  Paying that much for just a loaf of bread just isn't right.  I said as much to the server, who just agreed that yes, it was a lot of dough. I'm sure I will return here, but I have to lower the rating for now. ********* This place reeks of chain restaurant, but that's not entirely bad.  The ambience is raucous and loud, and given that there is a huge -- and I mean HUGE -- set of 4 TV screens behind the bar it stays like that most of the time.  If you can ignore that everything else about this place is good.  The TV screens obviously makes this place a sports bar type of place, but the food is a step up from that kind of food.  If you've experienced Cover 2 and Cover 3, B.J.'s tries to be that kind of place. The pizzas are their specialty.  They are very good, actually.  I have had the Meat Lover's equivalent.  I liked it.  Unless you're barely hungry you should get a small.  The mini is barely more than a pizza roll. The seared ahi tuna small bite is actually very good.  Be careful with the wasabi, though.  It's about twice as strong as any wasabi I've had with sushi, so it can be overpowering. My choice the past couple of times has been a salad.  Their BBQ chicken chopped salad is excellent.  This last time I tried the honey chicken salad.  It was ok.  Not that great, but still good.  I tried it with the bleu cheese dressing, but the dressing had gone bad.  If you try anything with the bleu cheese dressing ask for it on the side.  It can go bad. Their beer selection is very good.  If you're looking for a place to go just for the beer and some pub food to watch a game, this is an excellent option.  They have seasonal beers that rotate in and out of their lineup, as well as plenty of other domestic and international choices. It's a great place for parties and groups."
Laura G.,"Austin, TX",8,11,1,1.0,7/30/2011,"The boyfriend and I hoped visiting BJ's would provide us with a new local pub that served both great food and beer.  I should have know it was not to be when my arm almost broke due to weight of menus the hostess handed me.  The interior of this ""pub"" is not pub like whatsoever, it is more of a steakhouse decor than anything else.  Dark, dreary and cold!  We opted for the bar which seemed more inviting due to better lighting.  Now to tackle that menu...  I immediately had unpleasant flashback to Cheesecake Factory visit where I developed a headache reading the 50 page menu.  BJ's menu is overwhelming and overpriced for what they offer.  They are trying way to hard.  The cheapest beer in the house was 4.95??  Oh but wait its HH the beers are all 1$ off (menu page 15 stated).  So okay we try some of their specialty brewed beers and two appetizers (I'll stick to apps when a burger is 11$). Sadly the disappointment continued ...  The beers were the best part of the visit, though not great they were solid (hence the one star).  The app sampler plater that we ordered ""to try all our best apps"" was cold and unoriginal.  I could have put this platter together gathering samples at Costco on a Saturday afternoon!  The avocado egg rolls were literally disgusting (boyfriend disposed of his bite in napkin discretely).  They were tasteless, oliy and mushy with a weird yet horrific honey sauce??  The mini burgers were better but hard to mess those up and for 10$ I will make my own. We got the check as soon as possible still hungry and thirsty.  The service is unimpressive, the food is horrible and the beer you could find somewhere else cheaper.  I wish this place would have stayed in Dallas because it has no place in Austin."
Konrad H.,"Ozark, AR",8,137,33,4.0,5/17/2012,I've always had decent chain food at this location.  I would not order a steak here it's not a steak house.  They do a splendid job of having a Gluten Free and Food Allergy meny which lists the common allegens in their menu items.  They also have a decent selection Ciders that are Gluten Free.
Alfred L.,"Round Rock, TX",0,55,,4.0,11/4/2011,"Personally, I think the name of the Restaurant blows (pause for laughter). OK, now that we've gotten the inappropriate jokes out of the way, lets get to business. I walked into Bj's already having information about the place. The CEO here once ran Cheesecake Factory, so I had great expectations. This place would be CCF if CCF painted their ceilings black, pushed the dimmer switch down a little bit more and placed several big screens around the place. It has a louder, more festive atmosphere than CCF. Its nice. A good place to bring a date and they stay open on weekends til 1am. Yay! No more having to go to the taco stands at Rundberg and Lamar with my wife backed up against me, her hand in her purse with her finger on the trigger of her Glock while I try to scarf down a few taquitos... The CEO brought along some nuances of CCF in case you missed going there: 1. Waiters with aprons (white over black, instead of white over white) 2. Telephone book menu that you need a Kindle to read through 3. attentive food servers 4. nice atmosphere 5. large portions I had the crispy jalapeno burger with fires. My wife had some huge salad, I think it was Sante Fe something or other. They were both very good. reminded us of Cheesecake factory, or have I mentioned this already? For dessert, we had a red velvet pizookie. Think cookie dough placed in the oven, then taken out at just the right time and slap on two scoops of vanilla. We rolled our way out to the parking lot minutes later. Price alert!!  They call it a Brewhouse because they brew their own beer. No problem. The food servers go out of their way to steer you to their home brews. Good strategy, no problem. Each pint is $6.00. Problem. Well, problem for me anyways, b/c I'm a cheap ass, but for the record, the blonde brew house is a good flavorful beer but the pumpkin ale? It was like tapping into a fresh pumpkin with a straw. But I still drank it. So, if the price of their beer is not an issue for you then go ahead. For another $1, you could go to HEB and buy a six pack of Miller lites. Over all, I would still come back for the food and I'll drink my beer elsewhere."
Kellie H.,"Lee's Summit, MO",45,57,,2.0,8/27/2011,"We went here for dinner yesterday (Friday), it was pretty busy but the wait wasn't long. After we got seated our waitress brought our waters then walked off not even asking if we were ready to order (which we were), we waited another 5 minutes to order. Then we waited for our food for a good 10+ minutes which was very frustrating considering what we ordered shouldn't take that long. After we got our food the waitress only came by once and then disappeared for about 10 more minutes while we waited for our plates to be taken. My husband wanted to get the pizookie (which is delicious and a must at BJ's) so of course we waited yet again. I think we spend a good hour + at this restaurant waiting and waiting. I was not impressed at all. We lived in the Bay Area for years and every time we had bad service so it's not just this BJ's, unfortunately it's an all around bad service chain."
Kali R.,"Austin, TX",7,80,,1.0,4/26/2012,"This place is two for two for me in disappointment.  The first time I tried it, months ago, I cut it slack because it had opened fairly recently, but my burger was on the stalest bun I have ever tasted.  I brought it to the waiter's attention and he shrugged me off, but when the manager came by, I pointed it out to him as being inedible.  Props to him for going back to the kitchen and discovering that the entire bag of whole wheat buns were in that condition. My meal was comped and I figured I would give it another try in the future Fail, part deux.  This time I brought my mother along after a Dr. appt. in the area and she ordered the broiled tilapia while I tried the soup and salad combo featuring clam chowder. The chowder was hot and tasty; the salad was insipid and forgettable.  But that wasn't the big problem.  The waiter brought my entire meal out nearly 15 minutes before my mother's meal arrived.  I was forced to go ahead and at least eat my soup before it got cold, while my Mom got the dubious pleasure of watching me.   To top off the questionable experience (BTW, the waiter never came by before bringing her entree out), Mom's tilapia meal was lukewarm.  We opted not to spend the additional time for them to warm it up and again, when the manager came by, we pointed out the problems and suggested that when entrees like this are delivered, it is usual to bring the salad out ahead (if the patron agrees), but not a great choice to bring the entire lunch for one while the other waits. He agreed and they comped half of the check.  I don't know how they can survive with this kind of performance, but I will not be going there again.  There are too many good options in that location."
David L.,"Pflugerville, TX",3,19,,5.0,5/10/2012,"Been twice already, enjoyed both visits. Our first time we went with burgers, hard to mess up burgers. Our second time, got the pot roast...delicious, but well under-portioned for the price. However, I will continue to return primarily for the vast beer selection. Being from Hawai'i, it's rare to see an island brew on the menu...they do! Also really enjoy their home brewed blonde lager...light and on point perfectly paired for a lunch meal, that's usually when we go."
Peylin F.,"Austin, TX",66,137,,3.0,9/14/2011,"BJs reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory (their menu is like a book just like Cheesecake's) but with lots of tvs for sports watching, so that is a plus. This review is only based on their pizza since that's all I've had the few times I've gone. People have raved about their pizza the most, so I figure why not try it? If you like Chicago, deep dish style pizza, then you'll like what BJs offers. The pizzas might not look that big, but since the slices are so thick, you fill up pretty quickly. The sweet pig pizza (Pineapple, seasoned tomatoes and oven-roasted ham) is just your typical hawaiian pizza, and the BJ's favorite pizza (Oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes) is just like a fancy shmancy supreme pizza. Both were pretty tasty and worth having again. We did take advantage of their 2 for $20 deal which comes with a side salad, a pizza to share, and a pizookie to share. I admit that I went with this deal because I really wanted to try their pizookie, which according to them is a deep dish cookie topped with ice cream. Supposedly this is what they are famous for (besides their beer). The side salad? Meh. Nothing to write home about. The pizza was good as usual, but the biggest disappointment was the pizookie. We ordered the white chocolate macadamia with vanilla bean ice cream. Any warm dessert a la mode is good, but I was expecting something bigger and thicker. The cookie was pretty thin, and it was a bit too sweet. The ice cream did balance it out, but in the end we had more ice cream than cookie left, which normally doesn't happen. I compare their pizookie to the cookie monster at Cheddar's, and the cookie monster is SO much better. The only thing that the pizookie has going for it is the fact that you have many types to choose from. If I come back again, I'll probably check it out during happy hour and take advantage of the half deal on their mini pizzas which is probably the perfect size for me."
Carolyn B.,"Sparks, NV",1,5,,4.0,10/17/2011,Yay I was so glad to see they opened close to my house! I tried my friends gluten free margherita pizza and it was delicious. Our waiter had a great sense of humor and he was very helpful with our menu questions. Yes it was pricey but we'll be back.
Sandra O.,"Austin, TX",0,24,,2.0,9/25/2013,"We walked out paying $76 for a large pizza, calamari, 4 mixed drinks! It's way too pricy for what you get. Their restaurant is nice and seemed clean but not worth the money. Not returning!!"
Rebecca W.,"Austin, TX",8,18,,4.0,8/12/2012,"The Sesame Chicken Salad is yummy as were the Mahi Tacos, the tacos are prepared either grilled or fried. We have been there a few times and service can be hit or miss, as sometimes the waitstaff is a little slow. The other salad that we have both enjoyed is the Thai Chicken Salad as I'm not a beer drinker I would defer to someone else to comment on the beers brewed in house."
Aaron H.,"Round Rock, TX",264,79,19,5.0,8/8/2013,"i always have a great time at bj's.  food's decent and the environment is always pleasant.  i particularly like the bar area with plenty of tvs to watch various sporting events. thus far, servers have been great all the way around."
Bunnie T.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,1.0,8/6/2012,This review is about the food. Ordered steak and vegetables. My ticket was dropped so my companions got their dinners and I did not. When my dinner arrived 10 minutes later the rib-eye steak was covered in pepper - and therefore tasted like pepper. Also the steak was raw inside. My companions were asked to check their steak doneness but I was not. The WORST vegetables ever. They were raw. Huge chunks of squash and cauliflower. The green beans were barely cooked. None of the vegies were seasoned with anything and the steak was over seasoned. Even my iced tea was watered down and tasteless. The wait service was not good either. Waiter kept interrupting us. He seemed fine with talking to us but could not remember to refill my tea. I had to ask many times.  Also waiter did not know the beer menu. Speaking of the menu - it's way too big and the pages stick together. Expensive - you get much better deal at Applebees and food is much better. Lo-carbers BEWARE - BJs salads have carby stuff in them. We'll not be going back.
Larris W.,"Houston, TX",24,20,17,4.0,6/5/2011,The staff and food was awesome. Good first impression!!
Kip C.,"Austin, TX",19,127,,1.0,2/2/2012,What is in a name... Ahem! wink wink nudge nudge. Ok but seriously this place is terrible! Its always over crowded and the food $VCKS. I've only gone when I tagged along with a big group of people for a birthday not on my own free will. I lived in San Diego dbag city and these places riddled every exit on the freeway. I guess this reminds me too much of SoCal being so close to the domain. If you like bad food and beer I highly recomend this place!
