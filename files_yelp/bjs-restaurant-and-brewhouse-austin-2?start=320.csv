Jennifer H.,"McAllen, TX",55,340,144,4.0,12/5/2011,"The avocado rolls were delicious, so stuffed with a nice sauce to dip it in. The fresh basil and Italian sausage flatbread  nice and crispy. go for traditional wings and a drink at the bar, the bartender takes good care of you, and will humor your own mix of fruity drink you want to create on the spot lol. The place has cool happy hour atmosphere, great for hanging out with friends. They have big party deals if pizza, wings, sides, etc. must try."
Stephen P.,"Georgetown, TX",36,72,7,4.0,7/16/2012,"I went here for a good birthday lunch, had a nice steak with some steamed veggies and cheesy mashed taters, it was pretty baller i must say..  Plenty of room with a nice huge sports bar with huge tv's and paintings on the wall, almost as if this restaurant has different seasons you can experience..  The also brew their own beer and it is great! The stout was delicious! Worth a try for sure!"
Tom M.,"Austin, TX",37,217,37,3.0,12/27/2011,Your standard corporate casual with a brewhouse included.  Not bad.  Because of the location it has been added to our lunch rotation.  Service is adequate and they seem to get people in and out pretty well since we have yet to experience a lunch rush wait.  What is with the Marxist art?
Jess V.,"Austin, TX",0,13,,4.0,9/27/2012,"A good old restaurant! I like the atmosphere and the food is pretty standard (in a good way). It's nothing fancy or out of this world, but it's just good food for a night out. I've been there 3 times now and everything I ate was great (pizza, burger, pasta). It can get a bit loud, so careful if you want a nice intimate night out, such as a date. It's a step up from Chili's, and it definitely won't break your wallet. Just a cozy fun place to be on a Friday night with friends."
David A.,"Clarksville, TN",4,87,1,3.0,2/6/2012,"Very good pizza with some decent beers but LOUD. We ate here as a party of four on a Friday night and had to wait for about 20 minutes. It is a typical mid-level restaurant so they gave you a buzzer and you had the option of waiting at the bar but it was packed. The service was below par. I had to wait about eight minutes for her to fix a drink order during which she passed our table three times (she forgot to bring a slice of lime with the drink). The brewery has some of it's own brews but nothing really stood out. The food itself was very good I thought. I had a small pizza and the cheese and ingredients tasted great. I would go back, but wouldn't make a habit of it."
Steven P.,"Austin, TX",6,20,15,2.0,7/23/2011,"We went on a Saturday, 5:30 PM.  GOOD: Creole tilapia, cream soda. NOT GOOD: Acoustics. I like a noisy restaurant, but the flat surfaces and mirrors bounce sound all over, making conversation and hearing the waitress difficult.  Pot roast.  When the plate arrived, it featured a pile of mashed potatoes like the one in Close Encounters   , dwarfing the pieces of pot roast, which combined were somewhere less than six ounces, and at least one ounce of that was fat. We asked the waitress if that was a normal serving and she said ""Yes, let me get a manager.""  Service. The waitress asks ""Is this your first time at BJ's?"" and we answered yes, but we didn't get any additional information for it, she just went on with the same presentation everyone else got. She asked how the drinks were before they had been touched. When the manager showed up (well after we had started eating), it wasn't ""can I help you with something"" but ""the waitress said I needed to talk to you."" No thank you, we're done here."
Brandon L.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,2.0,7/20/2012,"You know, I've been looking forward to actually eating at BJs. I had been there a couple of times just for drinks. I finally had the opportunity to eat and I was kinda disappointed. I had a burger and it was just ok. Really! It tasted like a Luke warm sonic burger. The pics in the menu made it look so much better. It was bland and not worth my cheat meal. I'm kicking myself all the way to the gym! Boo, BJs!"
Kaitlin F.,"Boerum Hill, NY",0,4,1,1.0,6/19/2011,My boyfriend and I got food poisoning from the barbecue chicken pizza here.  Worst experience ever.  Stay away unless you want to go to the hospital.
Courtney E.,"Pflugerville, TX",131,78,27,5.0,10/8/2011,"My husband and I have eaten at BJ's in Sugarland, so we knew the food was good for a chain restaurant.  This time, our server Amanda made the experience a true five star visit.  Amanda was engaging, knowledgeable, genuinely friendly, and the food was delicious.  We will come back and hope to see Amanda again!  BJ's is lucky to have her on their staff."
Greg S.,"Austin, TX",3,59,,4.0,11/11/2011,"Color. It's what any aspiring ""great"" restaurant must have in both food presentation and ambiance to be successful. BJs has both. Love a place that has a splashiness about it? Tell you one thing...it was packed pre-lunch hour. That tell you anything. It certainly falls under the same category as the old saying about what separates a good Chinese restaurant from a poor one. If there's a line outside waiting to get in the food must be aces. No line at BJs put the joint was jumping with celebratory and business-oriented (I suppose) conversation. The open bar is all the way open. Just enter and look to your right. In the right spirit for spirits? A colorful array of beer and booze enablers await you. After hearing my mother brag about the quality of the food on more than one occasion I had to make a point of stopping by. That's a use of at liberty time any Veteran's Day holiday observer would be proud of. The only places I can recall being this inviting from an interior standpoint would have to be Dave & Buster's and Pappadeaux's. They spare no expense to roll out the full red carpet of culinary enticements. The decor whets your whistle for what you'll soon be ordering. There's a long aisle full of booth space. You'll even notice candelabras off to the left.  Onward and most definitely upwards to the food we go. I went with the safe bet house salad. Cucumbers were beefy. The carrots were a thinly sliced visual feast. The balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing had some classy zing to it. One thing I noticed about the croutons that isn't usually a given with most salads of this persuasion. They weren't overly crunchy. Your teeth sort of sink into the soft level of crunch. Fine by me. Gives me more room to savor the whole grain flavor.  On this day the main course was plucked straight from the old reliable section of the menu known as SANDWICHES. Be prepared to either have ample leftovers or a best bud with a hollow leg who doesn't main doing his fair share to both satisfy his own cravings and keep those dollars rolling into the national economy. Exhibit A was the grilled chicken club. This monster's a two-handed job for sure. The marinated chicken breast was blissfully tender. The bacon was suitably crunchy. Don't take that last reveal for granted. I've had bacon-filled sandwiches in some establishments where the bacon was tough and overly stringy. Those aren't two traits I like in my bacon. If it crunches and you can taste the beads of grease forming on your tongue I'm the proverbial happy customer. I'll forgive the line staff for not omitting the roasted garlic mayo as I requested in my lame ass attempt to show a little restraint. It added something divine to the overall taste. The grilled sourdough bread it's served on at least in terms of appearance reminded me of the grilled cheese sandwich grill marks Mom made for me as kid. Trust me the sourdough is the perfect flavor match for what's sitting in between. All the sandwich possibilities that don't answer to the name of ""Burger"" come with either wedge-cut or thin and crispy fries. I ordered the latter. Time to get that best bud to, as you seem to always see articulated in the Sports section during crunch time moments, step up. Generous doesn't even begin to describe this heap of slashed spuds. You could pick your teeth with them to dislodge the sandwich remains. They're that thin. What they lack in size they make up for in taste. Neato with a capital N. Had I eaten them all there would have been no room in my gullet for... Dessert. Your physician shudders at the word. Your ultra-sensitive side seeks it out with Pavlovian regularity. I don't want to be part of a world where the possibility of partaking of it doesn't exist. BJs has you covered. I'd have to have ""dumb"" writ large on my forehead were I to refuse one of their noteworthy Pizookies. Just say that word and you're six years old again. Two dessert classics I humbly bow down to are Cookies 'n'  Cream ice cream and Oreos. You wouldn't be considered quackers if, upon polishing off the Cookies 'n' Cream Pizookie, you'd officially claimed you just had a religious experience. Heavenly Oreo cookie, yummy be thy name, thy reason for being, let yourself be adorned by 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and Cookies 'n' Cream mousse. Infidels need not enter the kingdom of decadence. Wasn't it Billy Joel who said ""I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints?"" LMAO. The waitstaff was on its game. Finished plates were taken away on the spot. My server, upon noticing I wasn't quite finished with dessert promised he wasn't trying to rush me. How often are you made to feel like a valued customer and not just a link in the table turn over chain? That merits three stars right off. BJs is way more than OK. It'll tantalize you inside and out."
Seth A.,"Fitchburg, MA",0,5,,3.0,2/19/2014,"Went to BJ's today for lunch to watch the end of the USA Olympic ice hockey game.  When I arrived at BJ's there was a hockey game on all the TV's, but it was the Canadian game.  I asked for the USA game to be put on the TV and they put it on one small TV.  The last time I checked I was in America.  If they want to watch the Canadian national team play, move the restaurant to Canada.  The food was ok.  I asked the server to 86 the tomato's on my burger and guess what, the burger came with tomatoes.  It is the attention to details that would get this place a higher ranking.  Well that and playing the USA hockey game on TV at a bar in the greatest country in the world, USA!!!  I guess when USA plays this Friday, I will take a road trip to Ontario to see if I can watch them play there.  Actually, I don't have to worry about that, as USA plays Canada.  I guess we know which team BJ's will be rooting for.  Here's a hint, they go by America's hat.  In case you don't know what that means, here's another hint.  The country starts with a C and rhymes with ana-da."
Miranda W.,"Austin, TX",112,111,17,5.0,6/3/2011,"Glad to see BJ's on the North side, finally! Great atmosphere, lots of room. The Ahi Tuna salad is the best!"
Divya K.,"Austin, TX",10,20,,4.0,1/5/2012,"Pros: good food, ambiance, huge selection of beers and specialty drinks, pleasant wait staff, and a decent selection for vegetarians Cons: situated in a horribly designed parking lot. getting in and out is not fun. food's probably unhealthy."
Kelley D.,"Austin, TX",4,35,2,4.0,12/30/2011,"Had lunch here the other day. We were seated very quickly in the middle of the lunch rush. The waiter was very nice, speedy, fun, and helpful. Husband and I both had burgers with fries, he the steak fries and me the skinny fries. Both kinds of fries were great! Husband is very picky about burgers not being pink when ordering them medium well and he had nothing to complain about (this is unusual).  We both had the house root beer, which was the best root beer I have had, well, ever. We will be back again."
Michael C.,"Austin, TX",0,7,2,5.0,2/21/2012,I eat here all the time...can't go wrong when you build your own pizza with a Harvest Hefeweizen on the side
Manoj I.,"Leander, TX",4,238,19,4.0,8/3/2011,"very crowded on weekends and some week days, loud, great place for friends & families to gather. Wait times can be up to 45mts on weekends and Friday evenings.The location is excellent right next to Domain. The appetizers are awesome, the entrees are great. I usually go here for Happy hour appetizers and beer. My Favorited are the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps, Avocado Egg Rolls and Crispy Calamari. They have a really good beer selection, I prefer the Piranha Pale Ale or the BJ's Jeremiah Red. The wait staff is very friendly, and I have never had problems with what I ordered. If you are seated at the bar area it might take while before they came get your order. I often have to flag the waitress down to get their attention."
Gregory B.,"Austin, TX",15,92,21,3.0,8/11/2011,Quicker service my 2nd time there. The food was still good. That is the reason from 2 stars to 3 stars. I've been hearing from others that go there more frequently that the service is either a hit or a big miss. Watch out. I got the Creole Tilapia which was good but lacking a flavor of balsamic vinaigrette on the greens which are the side to the fish and rice meal.. However the prices are still too high with a starting house salad at 5.50. The draft beers are still expensive. Basically your entree will not below 9.00. Despite the so called deep dish pizza a place with the same feel but lacking beers on tap with smaller prices is Cheddars.
Vizslas D.,"Austin, TX",2,69,1,2.0,9/2/2011,"My first visit left alot to be desired.  The chip and salsa were terrible.  We returned them and ordered Calamari.  It was pretty good but a very tiny portion for way too much $.  I ordered the Calzone and thought it was going to be the size of a medium pizza  turned in half.  It was about the size of baseball for $10!  Are you freaking kidding me?  I left as hungry as I was when I got there.  Some things tasty, terrible value."
Jen S.,"Cedar Park, TX",9,51,2,4.0,8/2/2011,"I think they have the kinks worked out now.  We went back last night and had excellent service (thanks, Brian). Our pepperoni pizza was yummy, as was the Nit Wit seasonal beer and Berry Burst Cider.  We even randomly got a Pizookie on the house :)."
Todd R.,"Austin, TX",0,56,,3.0,11/24/2013,Good food. Nice atmosphere. My only complaint is that my wife and I ordered house Cabernets and they were $12.50 each. That's a pricey house Cab. Ridiculous actually.
