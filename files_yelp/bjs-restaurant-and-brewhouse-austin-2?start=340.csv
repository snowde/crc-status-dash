Latif A.,"Austin, TX",27,60,,3.0,6/5/2011,"There are a growing number of brewpubs popping up around Austin.  Most have subpar delivery in either the food or, surprisingly, the beer; and then there are the unfortunate few that fail at both.  BJ's gets it right with quality house beers and a great menu."
Omoniyi O.,"Austin, TX",43,30,,3.0,9/14/2011,"This is definitely not a bad place for lunch. Also, not bad for a chain restaurant. They have an extensive lunch menu for under $10 and it's a lot of food. I had the fish tacos and I was definitely impressed. I'm giving 3 stars for now.....hopefully I can move up to 4 stars if i go a couple more times. It also seems that they have great selection of  handcrafted beers, but i'm only going on what i've heard and what my friends have said. I'm not a beer drinker, so I wouldn't know anything about taste testing. I'm sure I will be back. This looks like a good sports bar to catch some good games."
Larry O.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,20,,1.0,1/26/2013,"The call ahead seating is a sham.   We called ahead 20 minutes before arriving, were told there was a 15 minute wait, and had them put our name on their list.    We got there in the expected 20 minutes, checked in, and were told there was a 15 minute wait.   After 20 minutes of waiting, I asked how much longer.   The answer was 15 minutes.  Then they started calling people that arrived after us, but had not called ahead.   I asked what happened and the hostesses (there were about 5 of them) seemed confused, then said we were next up.   Then after 5 minutes she called someone else.   We gave up and went across the parking lot to Mighty Fine."
Amber Q.,"Austin, TX",18,38,6,4.0,8/21/2011,"Its huge and has a nice new modern draft house feel mixed with a good variety in the menu. Lots of selection of beers and a friendly staff. The bartender wasn't on point the other day, but the ahi snack most certainly was! Yum. We'll definately go back to check it out more."
Susan S.,"Austin, TX",0,6,,5.0,1/31/2014,"The pizza is amazing, service is great, and the management staff is always friendly! I love the Jermiah Red! It is the best beer besides Thirsty Goat that I recommend!"
Stefanie H.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,4,,4.0,9/17/2011,I recently have just came across this lovely resturaunt.. They have so much to choose from.. their deep dish pizza is amazing... and their chocolate pizookie is delicious..  I am in love with their bar though.. they have many drinks to choose from... My favorite is called A Drink Like That.. but the Throwback cherry coke and the captains mug is very good as well.. Maybe this resturaunt is so delicious to me because by the time I am done waiting I am usually pretty buzzed and by that time I'm starving and everything would be delicious.. but the sober people in my group tell me the food is delicious anyways.. so.. maybe it's just extra delicious.. lol.. my husband also enjoyed the beer taster thing.. which is a pretty good deal for what you get with it...I definitely think this is a great place for the young adult crowd...
chuck f.,"Austin, TX",1,7,,1.0,9/1/2011,"I went in after running errands in the neighborhood & couldn't have been more disappointed with the service. I sat at the bar which was half full, and the bartender that took my order interacted with me as little as possible. Other bartenders were friendly & the mac & cheese was fine. Details are pointless and perhaps I just got  the one bad apple in the bunch, but the above description of ""Applebee's with a beer selection"" is spot on. Austin doesn't need any more franchise restaurants. I should have known better."
Jesus G.,"Austin, TX",46,21,,4.0,11/1/2011,"I came to try this place out and I'm a fan!  Linda, our server was outsanding!  My brother and I were surprised to see that the food looked just like the pictures on the menu and was really good too.  Definitely coming back."
Chris T.,"Austin, TX",2,20,,3.0,10/9/2011,"Overall, my first time was out with some coworkers. The food in my opinion is not enough to justify the price tag. Perhaps if the food was a little bit larger in portions I could give this another star. Sorry :("
Candace S.,"Austin, TX",0,11,,4.0,6/28/2013,I love this place. I can always expect good quality food and avoid excessive waits. The menu is very extensive and I haven't had anything that I wouldn't recommend. This is a favorite place to grab a casual dinner while we're out and about.
DAVID S.,"Austin, TX",1,22,,2.0,8/8/2011,"Quite honestly the most disappointing pizza I've EVER had. After having lived ( and eaten ) in Chicago for over 12 years, I tend not to expect true Chicago-style pizza from a restaurant not in Illinois, but this example of Chicago-style pizza fails even when compared to the selection in the freezer section of HEB. The crust was nice and thick at the edges but it was even thicker in the MIDDLE of the pizza.  The amount of cheese on this one was so sparse, the I could see single strands of the mozzarella close to the center of the pie. I ordered a regular pizza with sausage, mushroom and onion.  At first glance, I was embarrassed for BJs... the sausage was in pellet form ( ya you know like on the frozen pizza referenced above).  There was very little sauce, I guess using chunks of tomatoes satisfies the ""red"" part of the pizza. OK, I was embarrassed and extremely disappointed in the pizza... But the very surprising thing was that 2-pages of their large menu was dedicated to promoting their outstanding pizza, with multiple topping combos, piping hot 4 cheese blend.   I believe BJs would be better served by instead of paying their menu authors they consulted a cook from Pizzeria-UNO , Genos East or Lou Malnatis to give them a hint what Chicago-style pizza was like. yuck yuck yuck 2 stars given for beer, but their in-house brews were more expensive than the commercial brands, which is a little disappointing, since that is a small incentive to try the home-brewed beer Service is good, but extremely choreographed, as they ask if you if things are OK, bordering on pestering.  But if you do ask for something extra, it takes longer than expected. Decent establishment, if you were in crowded city, but personal service, individual attention to fare ( including beer) goes a long way in  establishing repeat customers. I will go back if I am thirsty, but food (obviously pizza) is underwhelming."
Tipsy C.,"Elgin, TX",0,42,,5.0,2/20/2013,"The BEST deep dish pizza anywhere!  It's my preferred 'go to' spot for pizza.  A little pricey, but worth it for special occassions."
Duane M.,"Austin, TX",7,6,1,1.0,1/4/2013,"Ok. We've been here several times and the experience is usually good. However, tonight we went for dinner and I had one of the worst dining experiences ever. Horrible service compounded by an inadequate manager's response. I ended up spending two hours not getting a cup of soup and a salad after sending back pasta that was overcooked and chicken that was just downright cold to the touch. All I can say about that is thankfully I have leftovers at home. This was just awful!"
John M.,"Austin, TX",0,27,,1.0,6/13/2013,"This review is regarding the Arbor Walk location only. I like BJ's food.. unfortunately, I hate their services at the Arbor Walk location.. I was there twice this week.. first time for dinner with family. We walked in at 5:30pm Sunday and the place was pretty empty.. but the host seems per-occupied and not very friendly. She explain her computer is down and she would need to manually assign seat.. Anyway.. after about 10 mins wait and 8 or 9 additional groups of people showed up at the restaurant.. they finally was able to seat us. The server is ok.. but everything takes forever.. we ended up spending 2 hours there for our dinner.  I went there again today for lunch at 1pm... this time, I was immediately seated... but it took about 12 mins for my waitress to come to my table for the very first time (and she didn't even apologize for the delay).. I already have decided what to order while I wait, so I gave her my order.. another 10 mins goes by.. she still did not give me my Water I requested.. I gave up and left the restaurant and went to Tino's next door instead. As I was walking out, I told the host to cancel my order and explain what happen to her.. she just said ""ok""...  WOW.. terrible customer service! Luckily we have so many great restaurant in the area!"
R A.,"Austin, TX",0,40,,5.0,3/9/2013,BJ's was selected for a rehersal dinner by a dear friend.  I had never been there previously as I travel OUS substantially.  I was impressed with the wide variety on the menu.  The service was excellent.  Have been a repeat customer at this and the South Austin location.  Strong performance every time!
Ericca L.,"Pflugerville, TX",3,7,,4.0,12/21/2011,"I just had an absolutely fantastic meal! The hostess seated me right away even though my friend hadn't arrived (what a nice change of pace from others places!), and the servers were all super helpful and prompt. My friend and I had the avocado egg rolls (delish), caesar salad/tomato soup for me and ahi tuna salad for him. Big rave and I'll definitely be going back! Oh and sangria was great."
John D.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,50,6,5.0,10/31/2012,"Ok, in my way of thinking its not if you screw something up, it's when. Then the real test of a business is what you do about it. I have eaten at this location frequently over the past few months and have had good food & service. The only time I had a complaint about the service (waiter was a ghost - didn't even come by to collect for the check after he dropped it off) the manager gave us half off & a $10 gift card (never saw that waiter again). Great pizzas, good beer( like microbreweries) and nice variety of menu items - keeps me going back for more."
John J.,"Buda, TX",0,21,,1.0,10/4/2012,"went for third try - first two times were bad - poor, slow service from kitchen and bar - a mess both times. Went last night and once again, terrible service. Meal was not good - ordered full rack of baby back ribs and they were the worst I have had - waiter asked why I did not eat them and I told him - so manager comes out and apologizes and says we will comp them - then bill comes and ribs are still on bill! They are so unorganized the manager couldn't even remember to take the charge off.  IT is our last time - 3 tries is plenty"
Colin N.,"Hutto, TX",0,4,,4.0,2/16/2013,"Prices seem a little steep, but food and beer are awesome!  TVs on every wall are cool too."
Kassie M.,"Austin, TX",1,9,,2.0,12/18/2012,"I hate this place. The food is pretty good but the people who work here are utterly incompetent. I have never eaten here when the waitperson has not screwed up my order. They either take forever, bring the wrong thing, don't bring other things that you ordered, or they don't even enter in stuff that you ordered. So then you have to wait another 20 minutes while they cook your appetizer that was supposed to be out before the meal. Something is wrong with this place. The only reason I didn't give them NO starts was because I do kind of like the food. However, it's not worth the hell you have to go thru to get it. Go somewhere else with servers and hostesses that have actual brains in their heads."
