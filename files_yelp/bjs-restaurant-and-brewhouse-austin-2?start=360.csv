Jason S.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,16,,1.0,6/24/2011,"This is a big building with a beautiful design, but the food is not good and is seriously overpriced. 2 Fish tacos with cabbage and 5, count them 5, chips with a ramekin of salsa was over $11. ""That's fine"", you say, ""if the tacos are awesome"". They were fish sticks in a tortilla. Tasted like Mom bought some Gordon's Fishermen sticks from HEB and put them in a tort with some mayo. Blah! No thanks. Service is slow at best and managers are condescending. I have given this place two chances and both visits I left with a similar opinion."
El V.,"Austin, TX",3,126,5,4.0,5/22/2012,"New lunch specials finally lured us in the door. Staff was great and place was spotless. Don't see many places with a revolving door! I had the en-light-end menu item with a half flat bread pizza (California) and it came with a tiny little salad where dressing was not evenly coating all the pieces of lettuce, a very minor thing. I want to reiterate, the salad was just tiny, but the half sized order of pizza was filling enough for a small lady like me. Nice touch leaving the cucumber and tomato on the side of the salad instead of mixing them in like most places do. The flat bread pizza was AMAZING! Crust was awesomely crispy and the toppings were just divine. My date had the classic burger with thin fries and it was fantastic. I would give 5 stars except that the staff was really trying to upsell us on appetizers and deserts to the point of being sorta annoying. Also tried to clear my date's plate while we were still munching on the last of his fries. Don't try to hurry us out when business is slow, if there were people waiting for a table we would've hustled but the lunch rush was definitely over. On the flip side we were checked on frequently and our drinks were always full, so great service on that aspect. I suspect the upselling tactic is an agenda pushed by management. Maybe I'd order the chips and salsa if they were not $5. I mean seriously, five bucks for chips and salsa (which many places give out for free) when the new chicken fried steak is only $6.50 until 3pm? What non-sense. Could write an entire second review on the beers. If you like beer you will NOT be left wanting. We will be back here again for lunch for sure."
Chasity F.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,3.0,6/18/2011,"We went to BJ last night since it had just opened. My husband ordered potato skins they were okay but needed extra cheese and  the skins were very small, but you get 10.  I ordered a bbq mini pizza and it was real doughy.  What I didnt like was I ordered a virgin strawberry splash because i cant drink,  when the bill came out they charged 8.60 for my drink, (so regular price).  I was not happy about this.  My husband ordered a berry ale beer was okay and price was 6.00.  But overall I would go back bit try other items and not order a virgin drink,"
Stephen M.,"Austin, TX",4,35,2,1.0,6/4/2012,"At BJ's Brewhouse North at Arborwalk on Saturday 2nd of June, 2012 after a graduation. We had a group of 16 people. We all arrived approx within 10min of each other. Table was set adequately. We ordered drinks for 4 people while we initially waited, took about 15 min. After all parties arrived we ordered food which took over a 45min hr to reach our table.  I ordered Angel Hair pasta Toscana. It arrived as Spaghetti and they didn't tell me it was going to be substituted. I alerted the manager. Nice guy. 20 min later the waiter came to tell me that they were going to substitute the pasta. It tasted good but dish would have been better suited with Angel Hair. They comp-ted my entree and it was a pleasant surprise. I was hoping for some free sour dough bread or salsa n chips but I guess BJs doesn't wanna give out those types of fillers for free. The raspberry tea I ordered was awful. Returned it and ordered regular sweet tea. Refills took about 45min to an hour. One server for 16 people. Our server said he had back up and the girl helping him told us she was helping out but bailed once the rest of our party arrived. Our waiter was very nice and apologetic. He got a good tip. Not going back to BJs anytime soon. Maybe, if someone I don't like is paying, I'll go. Maybe."
Jake O.,"Austin, TX",31,76,1,3.0,1/2/2012,"Three cheers for the mini-bruschetta!  It's delicious and just about the right size for 3 bucks, even though it probably cost 5 cents to put together. I have been to this location twice now and sat at the bar both times. If you want great service, grab a seat at the bar.  This location has a great beer selection in addition to their homemade brews. Not sure why you would come here to drink Miller Lite or some other watery beer unless you like paying $10 for a sandwich. Or $20 for a large pizza. Look, the food is okay. Both times I have gone to this location I ordered the pizza. Both times the dough-to-topping ratio has been way off. All dough and very little topping. Definitely not worth the money I paid for it.  But, I'm a sucker for big screens and beer so inevitably I give in and order food. The Jeremiah Red is delicious. The Grand Cru (they already ran out), even better. My suggestion would be to go during Happy Hour (3-7 I think) where they offer half price mini pizzas, $2 off appetizers and $1 off their brews. Or, just go for the beer and grab a sandwich from Potbelly next door on your way home!"
Michael V.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,43,,2.0,5/2/2012,"The only reason this review got two stars is that the food was semi-decent. The service was terrible. The server started to take people's plates away even before they had finished dinner. Then after asking us what we wanted for dessert, he dropped the check even before we got dessert. You lost a customer because of shoddy service."
Van D.,"Round Rock, TX",2,4,,3.0,7/5/2012,"I came here July 3rd and it wasn't busy enough for there to be a waiting line, so that was great. I loved the lighting, atmosphere and company was pleasant so I was pretty open minded with the food.  As a heath conscious eater, I'm kinda wary of eating out because I'm never sure of the options available. And paying $10 for a salad? No. Just no. I can make those salads at home.  So with my eating habit, I was grateful to learn that BJ's have the ""Enlightened Entrees"", which are all under 575 calories. I chose the Creole Tilapia simply because I like fish and tomatoes. My two friends got the Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi and a shrimp pasta dish, the name of which I couldn't remember. The guy who's not driving got a Jeremiah Red.  The food came out about 10 minutes later, which I think is decent. My dish was pretty decent. The fish is well-cooked, the sauce is good, the side salad is not bad. For those who don't eat too salty like me, know that the tapenade is salty because of the anchovies. On the health perspective, the dish is pretty balanced: a third each of grain, protein and vegetables. Overall, I would eat it again.  My friends had no complaints about their dishes. The Jeremiah Red, I had  a small sip of at the beginning of the meal, is good even though I don't drink beer in general. We ordered a triple chocolate pizookie because we heard it was good. Personally, I was way to rich for me so sharing was a good idea. While it was good and my friends did enjoy it to, we didn't finish it simply because it was so rich. I am glad to go back to my 72% dark chocolate and home made ice cream after that.  One complaint, the waiter was terrible with refilling water, terrible enough that one of friend got a bit mad and gave only $1 tip. And I got thirsty enough that I asked to drink from my friend's cup.  I will probably come back, although not anytime soon."
Dawn T.,"Austin, TX",21,23,,5.0,7/27/2012,"Great beers, great food, great staff, great atmosphere.  If you want fun and laid back, head to the bar.  If you're looking for a sit down dinner, soft lighting, and some quiet, the main dining area is for you.  Everything we've tried has been delicious. Standouts have been the pizza,  BBQ cobb salad, and fried artichokes.  We look forward to going every chance we get."
Mme B.,"Austin, TX",0,32,,1.0,5/20/2012,"Beer is good but way overpriced and wait staff was slow and unknowledgeable.  She didn't even look us in the eye and seemed totally pre-occupied.  She got two things wrong with our order and ""forgot"" to bring my husband's beer."
Derek J.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,3,1,2.0,4/28/2012,"Two stars is giving them the bonus of a rounding up from one star and change. The place was packed at 7:00p on a Friday and good for them, making money is why you're in the business after all. Don't set your expectations too high, it's not an uppity type of place, just what we were looking to try. Yes, 1st time at a BJ's, ever. Very sticky floor on the way over to the bar. Something must've spilled and wasn't cleaned up well at all. Our drinks were served within reasonable wait. We started with the Ultimate Iced Teas and chose to finish with them even though they were just okay ($10/ea.). Service was a very solid average. Reading the menu I notice the ""deep dish"" pizza. and think that's a great starter piece. We ordered the small sized (size #2 of 4) Classic Combo and added onion/pepper. The pizza came in expected time, however, it was just warm and not hot. The dough was chewy and seamed under-cooked. Toppings we distributed in an acceptable amount. Note: nothing ""great"" happening here, never mind excellent. Next we ordered the calamari. There was a reasonable amount and it was very warm, still not hot. But the squid was horrible. The tentacles were very hard almost crunchy and the rings were beyond chewy. This dish was clearly cooked wrong and long. We are no strangers to some fried squid and this dish had to be worst I've ever had. Because of this, we closed out. Five drinks, two app's, no dinner."
Penelope D.,"Austin, TX",24,3,,2.0,11/11/2011,"I used to love you... now, not so much. Was exited to be the one recommending BJ's to coworkers for lunch. Waited 1:20 minutes for our food today and the customer service was terrible. Pull it together."
Claudia D.,"Austin, TX",0,42,,3.0,12/30/2011,"My first visit for this place. The place gets a five out of five for looks. Beautiful atmosphere. Starts with nice spinny doors, continues with pretty lights. Lot's of photos on the walls, mainly black and white. Clean bathrooms, which were done in brown tile and steel. There was a good variety of dishes, with pizza, steak, wraps, burgers, salad, soup, and pasta. It would be a four stars, but there was only ONE vegan choice in the entire giant menu. This was the veggie burger, which was made with beans and quite tasty. There were four sodas that were home brewed, which were root beer, cream soda, orange cream, and black cherry. The root beer was average, and the cream soda was great. We came with a big party of 12 in the evening, and the food still came in decent time. Overall, nice place, and it's a good place, and I would take a group there."
Josh H.,"Georgetown, TX",89,7,,2.0,8/11/2011,"I will try to  keep this short and sweet.   I looked forward to eating here because I have friends that rave about it.  My main complaint is the service.  No complaints on the food besides it being cold.  We had to ask our server to check on it and then she brought it right out.  I am assuming it had been sitting there for awhile.  The place was very busy which is good for them but our waitress was definitley trying to rush us out the door.  She asked us during the middle of eating our meal if we would be ""sticking around for dessert"". So I asked her to check back when we had actually got close to finished eating.  We asked for a couple other items like ranch dressing, drink refill but never got them.  Don't go if you want to enjoy your time. Decent food though."
Beth A.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,56,8,4.0,6/13/2011,"I know, this a chain...but it is a chain with craft beers! And tasty ones at that. BF and I went last Saturday night after we realized this place had opened. We have been watching the progress of the building in anticipation of trying their brews. BF had been previously but not me. The parking lot was jammed and we thought we were going to be in for a long wait...but to our surprise and delight, we were seated immediately since we were a table of two. That said, the table was rather tiny, but we made do. Despite the crowded restaurant, service was on the ball. Server came to take drink orders and since I couldn't decide (I am not much of a beer drinker), she offered to bring me a sample. Be aware, samples are only offered once in a 24 hour period. How they keep track of that...I did't ask. I ended up with a Brewhouse Blond and the BF had the Nit Wit. We both thought our selections were good, nearly top notch.  The appetizer we ordered was the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps. These were very flavorful, shrimp were chargrilled. They laid on top of some veggies, mango salsa and a nice spicy/sweet sauce was provided for dipping. The miss with this appetizer is the lettuce used for the wraps. It is Boston lettuce, which is very tender (good), but too lightweight (bad) to hold the filling. We ate these with a fork and knife. Our entrees were served promptly. I had a new dish on the menu, the Creole Tilapia.  It is one of their enlightened entrees that is under 575 calories. It's served with rice pilaf...pretty standard...and some baby greens and veggies with a balsamic vinaigrette. The greens were completely limp...maybe due to a heatlamp? The Tilapia was covered with a nice tomato olive tapenade.Very tasty combo, just wish the lettuce would and have been crisp and chilled. BF had the Tuscan chicken limone which was served over angel hair pasta and included nice size pieces of artichoke, sundried tomato and steamed spinach. This was a huge portion and two crisp slices of garlic bread were served along side. He ate it all because it was so delish! Prices are very reasonable. Get over your prejudice for chains and try this place out..great for sports viewing with several large flat screens scattered throughout."
William D.,"Austin, TX",0,22,,3.0,7/7/2011,Went here for lunch once.   The food was OK and the waiter was very engaging.  However the service was somewhat slow .  I find the giant room atmosphere somewhat of a put off.  The place is full of TVs which is great for watching sports but terrible for having conversations.
C J.,"Austin, TX",0,73,2,3.0,1/25/2012,"I've dined at this place a few times now both at lunch and dinner.  Food quality, in my opinion, ranges from ""ok"" to really good.  My recent ahi tuna there was sub par both in flavor and perceived freshness, but my expectations weren't high.  It's not like BJ's is a sushi place.  I've experienced a couple hiccups service-wise, but overall I'm happy with the prompt and attentive staff there.  One thing, however, that I find really annoying -- and I'm sure it's the management that drives this -- is the ""script"" every server delivers at the onset with the message:  SELL, SELL, SELL.  Each visit is accompanied with the host seating you and saying, ""is this your first time to BJs?"" and regardless of your response, they'll bring up their ""handcrafted beers...blah, blah, blah.""  Minutes or seconds later when your server arrives, it begins with ""Can I bring you one of our handcrafted beers?""  This is soon followed by their attempts to push variously named appetizers.  Enough already!  It's annoying enough to me to deter me from visiting very often despite its convenient location."
