Elyse L.,"Euless, TX",599,677,1990,4.0,11/15/2014,"BJ's is a chain I can count on when I'm hungry and need a place I know will be consistent and have something both my husband and I enjoy. I always get the thai chicken mango salad off their enlightened menu but decided to switch it up and try something new today.  I got the mediterranean chicken pita tacos and they were really good! So filling that I couldn't finish it. Two come on the plate with diced chicken, cucumber, tomatoes, feta, and a greek yogurt sauce that tasted exactly like sour cream. I thought they were fine without it. It's also served with 'bistro grains'. I couldn't tell if the grain was barley or farro but I did catch the red quinoa, corn, and black beans and thought they went well together. My husband surprised me by ordering off the enlightened menu too, but he got the bison burger that came with slaw and he cleaned his plate. We like to share something on the small bites menu as an appetizer sometimes and tried the fried artichokes today which I thought were just okay. The dipping sauce reminds me of a ranch but more tangy and the artichoke bites themselves could have used more seasoning.  I think the biggest advantage of dining here is their rewards program which gives you points for every dollar you spend that you can redeem later for free food. It costs nothing to get their card, you just have to remember to check in with it at the hostess stand each time you come. Download their app and that way you will always have your card number on you."
Cher E.,"Austin, TX",70,133,45,5.0,2/14/2017,"We've visited this BJ's location more than six times over the past two years and the food is always great. I'm writing this review today because I went into this location yesterday with one of my girlfriends who was visiting from out of town to celebrate my birthday. Our server, Kelby was so patient and awesome.  I was having trouble picking an entree and she asked me what I had taste for.  I told her, ""Something crunchy, fresh...and healthy.""  (I had indulged in junk food a little too much over the previous week, so I was craving something more healthy.)  She suggested the salmon pita tacos with the quinoa side salad.  I obliged and I am so glad I did!  That dish satiated my palate gloriously :)  As if that gesture wasn't yelp worthy on it's own, the manager, Desmond (whom I see there often and is always so cheerful and pleasant to the guests) came over, asked us what we were celebrating and I told him it was my birthday.  He offered to bring us two prosecco in champagne flutes with strawberries in them.  I hesitated initially because of my aforementioned indulgences of the week prior but he assured me that I would like it so we accepted.  All was well and I will of course be visiting this BJ's location again soon."
Nat P.,"Austin, TX",70,115,35,4.0,5/27/2016,"On 1st  and 3rd Tuesdays of each month, I'll take my nephew out to dinner and I'll let him choose the restaurant.  I'll ask him, do you want ""Chinese, Japanese, Mexican,..."" and before I can finish, he will scream in Trump-ian fashion, ""No, I want White People.""  By that he means ""white people food,"" and by that he means ""BJs.""  Nothing defines WPF more than this restaurant.   Delicious boneless, spiceless, souless, flavorless, fresh from frozen, 3000-calorie delights are this chain's specialty.  My nephew's young taste buds love it and since my own tastes buds never evolved from my mother's TV dinners from the 60s, I love it too. I highly recommend the potato skins, which taste way better than the ones at Cheesecake Factory.  They are fully loaded and a true gut buster. My only complaint is the restaurant name has put me in an awkward position.  My nephew has occasionally asked me, what's BJs mean?  And since I don't like to lie,  I'll have to say , ""Son, it refers to something two or more adults do to show they love each other and that's all I can say until your 18. Now finish your fried turkey sandwich and fries.""  Then he stuffs his face and crisis is adverted."
B L.,"Manor, TX",0,23,9,5.0,3/24/2017,"Just after the lunch crowd around 1:40, waitress very attentive food and drinks very good. Will be back to this in round rock. Hope I get the same waitress service was great."
Susan A.,"Georgetown, TX",21,49,84,4.0,8/27/2016,My husband and I had our first experience eating at BJ's Brewhouse the other evening. We enjoyed our 1st time there so we will have to go back and check it out again. My husband had their homemade Rootbeer and I sampled some of their micro beers... which were awesome!! We ordered a pizza and calamari... Both were delicious!!
Justin H.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,43,,3.0,12/22/2015,"Came here for a birthday dinner for a friend. Servers were great and on top of things: so no issues there.  I ordered a mini pizza and expected it to be a larger quantity for its price. However, I was mistaken. I paid about $10 for a mini pizza and didn't feel that I got the value for its price. I'd recommend getting a burger if you want to spend an average restaurant budget ($10-15). It's way more worth it."
Eric D.,"San Francisco, CA",193,78,35,1.0,11/15/2016,"I'm not even sure where to begin... Let's go with the easy part first. The food, it is what it is and that's all I can really say. It was decent and not as flavorful as you would think a place this size should be. I had the chicken Alfredo with chicken... 5 1/2 small slices of chicken that is. The Brockley that was in it was way overcooked and mushy. The service... This girl has got to go. Amy D She made me feel like I was in a diner. She walked up asking, drink? I asked her about a particular beer and she didn't seem to have a clue as to what I was talking about. As I sat there, I would look up and see her wiping The sweat from her forehead, wipe it off on her apron, then walk around refilling peoples water and taking picking their glasses up with the same hand she wiped her for head with.  When it came time for the check she had passed me several times, never checked on me to ask me how my meal was, never refilled my water glass, (thank God). A manager finally walked by and asked me how everything was and of course I mentioned I need my check and a box for my food. The manager delivered my check and brought me a box. I put my debit card in the check presenter, she ran my debit card, brought me back the check and didn't say a word. She then turned to the table next to me and told the family of four ""I hope you have a great night, it was my pleasure and I hope to see you again soon"".  Made me feel like I wasn't even there. The good news is, I don't ever have to go back since apparently a party of one is an inconvenience to her night. My total time there was 25 minutes, less than anyone else that was around me. And whoever is reading this, please do not respond and don't offer me a gift card to get me back in your doors."
Lee D.,"San Antonio, TX",0,2,2,4.0,4/7/2016,"Sort of overdue as we have eaten here half a dozen times now. The food and drinks are solid. Havent had anything yet we didnt like. The pizzas are awesome and always have abbit left for 4th meal. Lol Drinks are good if not maybe a bit pricey other than specials. Service is usually good. Maybe a little slow at peak times or later after staff cuts. Always froendly and accurate tho. Good for adults. Though kid aafe, id recommend people NOT bring very small kids, as ots more of a grown up place."
Matt M.,"Waco, TX",1,3,1,5.0,4/2/2017,"I've been to this location a few times since I moved here and I love it!!! The service is exceptional and top notch!!!!! The beer is amazing and the place is always clean and a great atmosphere!!! Today I went here for a good lunch and a beer at the bar!!! My waiter, Josh, is great! I recommend people come here Friday and Saturday nights and then on Sundays for lunch to have him as a bar tender! He's accurate fast and good personality!"
Benetta P.,"Shreveport, LA",424,355,2836,4.0,7/11/2015,"Decided to eat something different, something, new. Not my usual dishes. I ordered baby back ribs with big poppa smokers sweet money championship rub, served with BJs Jeremiah red ale bbq sauce, with a side of white cheddar mashed potatoes and a house salad with a thousand island dressing. The ribs were good, meaty, and I really loved the rub and side bbq sauce. I did not get to meet Big Poppa nor Jeremiah. I guess they were gone already. Improvement... After serving your guest ribs, give them wet wipes or a wet towel, something, we eat ribs with our hands, at least I do."
Janet F.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,14,6,3.0,2/2/2017,"Our waitress (Hollie) was excellent. She was attentive knowledgeable and very friendly. The shift manager, Derek was also very good. The food was a 3 star as well as the drinks my husband has to send back a Long Island ice tea."
Kim H.,"Round Rock, TX",6,4,8,3.0,9/8/2016,This is not a lunch place specially coming from work. The service is so slow that you need an hour and a lunch even if you show up at 11.30. There are a lot of businesses around this restaurant so they are serving lunch to a crowd and I get that but they seem ill prepared to do proper lunch service. On the other hand I've not really had any complaints about the food here. It is actually consistently tasty and the deep dish pizzas are the only ones worth mentioning in Austin that I'd go for!
Amy D.,"Austin, TX",829,1051,4364,3.0,4/27/2014,"Ohhh a chain! As a Yelper I am not supposed to like this place right?! Well if you are seeking a decent happy hour, a variety of draft beers and a health conscious menu don't be so quick to judge. I am a fan of their La Crema Pinot Noir, during happy hour it is $6 (otherwise $11.95). And when I am craving some carbs the happy hour (smaller portion) flat bread is just over 400 calories. The ""enlightened"" menu showcases 750 calories and under cuisine. Will the dishes knock you off your feet? Probably not but your tummy will be filled without hitting your pocket book too hard.  Tip: They have a rewards program."
Josue M.,"Austin, TX",48,72,56,4.0,4/15/2016,"I know most folks cringe at the idea of dinning at a chain. It wasn't until my second visit that my brother broke the news to me. By then it was too late. I was already reeled in.  By now, I've had multiple visits and a few happy hours with co-works and I can't find much wrong with this place.  Regardless of your dietary preference, you'll for sure find something to satisfy your taste buds. They have a huge menu, so you won't find an issue in that department...trust me. I personally keep going back to the appetizer and small snack section. I'm hooked on their avacado egg rolls, ahi poke, spinach stuffed mushrooms, and the fried artichokes.  You'll also find a full bar with their in-house crafted beers. Well...not quite in-house. They have 6 BJ breweries in the US that brews for their locations. I was a little bummed when I found out that St. Arnold's Brewery in Houston would brew their beers. It wasn't until I spoke to one of their brewers at Denver's Great American Beer Festival that I found out why. Long story short: Texas houses more BJ's Restaurants then any other state (35), so they obviously need additional help from a super awesome brewery. Next time you walk in,  I highly recommend the Nutty Brunette and Jeremiah Red. Cheers!"
Kris U.,"Austin, TX",509,902,859,3.0,7/6/2014,"The menu here is comparable to the Cheesecake Factory, with an overwhelming array of options in all categories: burgers, pizzas, salads, sandwiches, pastas and other American favorites.  The main difference of course is that BJ's has a larger selection of beer (their own) and Cheesecake Factory wins in the dessert category. That being said, I've never really found my ""go to"" dish at BJ's, until recently.  The Thai Chicken Avocado Mango salad was as delicious as it looked on the plate: a very pretty affair with mango slivers, red bell pepper, jicama, greens and sliced chicken, topped with a generous portion of avocado slices and dusted with chili powder and sprinkled with pine nuts. Their beer is okay, with something for everyone on their standard list.  Of these my favorites are the Piranha Pale Ale and the Nutty Brewnette, but your best bet is to go with one of their rotating seasonal or reserve beers for something more interesting and complex."
Hussain M.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,2,,5.0,2/2/2017,I enjoyed the food and environment greatly.  The manager is the best guy that keeps the place and customers going.  I had the best burger with a side of caesar salad.  This will be my new best hang out place.
Elizabeth Q.,"Austin, TX",670,27,33,5.0,4/12/2016,"Really appreciate all your support with the Fundraisers and 10% of Food and Non-Alcoholic drinks going to our charity of choice - Capital Area Food Bank. Also, I really appreciate the Gluten-Free pizza being actually tasty and yummy!    Great place for Fundraisers and meeting with friends - my fiance and I will be back at least monthly :)"
Erik P.,"Palm Bay, FL",26,144,85,3.0,4/21/2016,"(More like 3.5 stars) I cannot count how many times I've driven past this particular BJ's Brewhouse. Finally decided to give it a shot after hearing positive things. Overall I must say it was a positive experience and I'd be willing to come back again.  Everything we ordered was good but the only thing I noticed that could have been better was the food temperature. Although the Tuscan Tomato Bisque and Clam Chowder soups were warm at best, they were both good. The tomato and fresh mozzarella salad was exceptional, but it was real small. The half-sandwich with fries (the other part of our ""lunch combos"") were good and for $7.99 there are no real complaints here.  Some friends told us that their Jambalaya is really good. One of them cooks that AND is from New Orleans, so I am definitely taking his word on that!        Until next time, BJs!"
Christopher P.,"Chico, CA",3,33,5,4.0,10/3/2016,"The beer is ok without being great. Pretty typical for chain brew house. I first went to a BJ in Temple TX up the road in 2010. This one in north Austin is pretty similar. They have a nice portabello salad that is tasty and good for vegetarians, but not filling. Staff is always well trained and likeable. They had an imperial stout on tap last time that was very good, but it's a seasonal."
Shannon S.,"Irving, TX",52,165,187,4.0,7/30/2015,"I like this spot for a late night snack and sports. It's close to hotels, not crowded, and the staff seems to be nice. Either that or this very tasty ""Angry Orchard"" has me tipsy."
