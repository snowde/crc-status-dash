James B.,"Scottsbluff, NE",0,16,10,3.0,5/21/2016,"Not my first time at BJ's. Good food, casual atmosphere, and great friends. We decided to go a little later (around 1-1:30) to avoid the lunch rush, but our waiter seemed to be a little put out that he had to accommodate our large group (15). Excellent variety of food! Disappointing service. Cheers!"
Elle J.,"Austin, TX",32,9,2,4.0,6/25/2017,"I have often visited BJ's on several occasions and I have found it to be a very good restaurant. I would have given 5 stars, but today was not the case. My family and I arrived and were seated promptly with no problems, as it was not very full. There were 5 servers at the door. However, after waiting 13 minutes, I put a 2 minute timer on, because I wasn't going to wait longer than 15 minutes. With the countdown on, we finally got a server. He didn't wait on us because of the timer, he saw from across the restaurant that we hadn't been served. He came over took our orders and we received our drinks as fast as he could. After he walked away, the manager came over and offered his apologies. We were calm, and the rest of our meal and service was actually quite enjoyable. We offered a thank you for his service to Nathan...our server...and out of his own mouth, he said he just didn't want anyone to leave displeased with their experience. So BJ's, this is a good employee to keep. He was fast, pleasant, and made the children's dining experience a good one. The food was good and no issues except the afore mentioned mishap. I'll one back but I'll always ask to be served by Nathan. A veteran of our Armed Forces, and a model employee (IMO)!"
Ashley P.,"Dallas, TX",70,6,6,5.0,6/17/2016,"Great food.  We had the fried asparagus and California chicken club and it was all good.   Really liked our waitress the most. Ashley S. Had Perfect timing, perfect service."
Lucy T.,"Houston, TX",85,66,62,3.0,4/17/2016,"Went here because the kids in my family acts like there isn't a BJ in Houston... But I believe service was great, BUT our food wasn't as expected. My chicken Alfredo pasta was hard, I usually never ask anyone to redo my plate, but that pasta was not inedible. Even with the second plate, some pasta was still hard.  Our server was very friendly and everything was out on time and orderly! Only thing to complain in the food. No one really liked their food, but my friend. He got the dipping roast beef sandwich! So I guess that's recommendable."
Corinna V.,"Austin, TX",79,323,3,2.0,12/11/2014,"Every time I come here, this place drops another star.  The first time I came to this location, it was a 4 star.  I've now been here 3 times, and it's at a firm 2 star.  I'm fairly certain I'll be staying away. The food isn't bad here.  (It's not good, either, though.  Very middle-of-the-road.)  What's been declining on each visit is the service.  The last visit, I was exasperated.  While our server was pleasant in the beginning, it became clear that she was in a rush to leave, or possibly go gossip with her co-workers.  My 2 friends and I were buying drinks during our meal, (and had planned on continuing to do so after the meal, as well.)  Unfortunately, our server made it very clear that we were over-staying our welcome.  (We weren't loud, the restaurant wasn't busy, and our server had 2 other tables, so it wasn't like we were holding her up from leaving.) Sadly, we were tired of her ""checking in on us"" and suggesting to-go boxes and stopping by to ""see if we needed anything else"" every few minutes, so we left.  She missed out on the opportunity to make a larger tip that evening, because I know each of us would have likely ordered at least 2 more cocktails a piece.  I think we're officially done with this place. If you're wanting a quick meal, this place will work.  Should you want the opportunity to enjoy your meal and talk with friends, you'd be better off going somewhere else."
Eunji S.,"Coppell, TX",39,21,43,3.0,1/10/2016,The food is pretty average compared to other restaurants of this sort. I got the grilled salmon with quinoa and it was delicious! The portion was pretty small for the salmon but my friends got pasta and their portion looked big. The atmosphere is very casual so it would be nice to come with your friends and coworkers to just chill and have a beer.
Dana P.,"Fresno, CA",168,475,26,4.0,2/28/2016,"Usually not a fan of chain restaurants, but I really like BJ's restaurant. The food is good, the beer is excellent and the service is always good. Had a bacon-guacamole burger the other night and was reminded what a great place this is."
Tasha B.,"Port Saint Lucie, FL",0,6,2,3.0,10/18/2015,"This place has a very nice atmosphere. Service was enjoyable, our waitress Diane was exceptional. The food fell a little short. It was just average.  I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich at $10.95 was quite a big portion I just really didn't enjoy the BBQ sauce.  One thing that will keep me coming back is the Pizookie dessert. They are delicious!  I believe with the food being subpar yet the service being wonderful a 3.5 star review suits this joint pretty well."
Susan C.,"Austin, TX",0,13,1,1.0,10/27/2016,"Disappointing.   A steak sent back and still not right.  Of course, cold vegetables when the still raw steak returned.   Lackluster service.  Lackluster food.  Hardly worth it."
Ivy D.,"Pflugerville, TX",210,21,148,4.0,12/5/2015,the food is good ! nice serviced . i love the mushroom satted with spinach and baby pork. Beautiful place open until 12am . Abslutely be back !
Alexandra H.,"Austin, TX",91,76,7,4.0,2/16/2015,"Okay, so I'm a HUGE fan of BJ's, but this location the staff is a little disappointing... They bring all the food out at different times, and even though you say ""can you please bring the appetizer first"" they've brought it WITH the meal every time...  Also our waitress felt it necessary to reach ACROSS our table... More than once. The food was still delicious."
Linda L.,"Austin, TX",0,14,,1.0,10/19/2016,"The chef leaves on the woody part of asparagus, so that you end up choking and spitting it into your napkin. It is a safety hazard and an embarrassment.  The rest of the eateries in town know how to break it off above the woody part before cooking it."
Wade W.,"Austin, TX",0,11,10,5.0,3/29/2016,"As always every time we have came here to bjs brewhouse (the north Austin location) we get exceptional service! This is one of my favorite restaurants in  Austin TX. The food has always been delicious and the atmosphere is nice and relaxed. The beer selection is amazing as well. I highly recommend the Jeremiah Red draft beer!!!  I wish the same could be said for the South Austin Brodie location but they lack leadership, their service is poor and they should take notes from the leadership of the north MoPac location."
Brian A.,"Austin, TX",180,11,,4.0,10/1/2015,I really like this place. Prices are a little high but their beer is good and the service has always been acceptable.  Pazookies are amazing and always put me in a sugar coma. Definitely go on fathers day because they give you a really cool glass beer mug with the date on it.
Scott F.,"Austin, TX",364,21,7,4.0,9/15/2015,"Upbeat staff, consistently good food and a vast assortment beers & cocktails has been my experience at every location I've been to so far. The Arbor Walk location is my current favorite and a great place for a lunch meeting (if you don't mind a little noise)."
Jacqueline S.,"Austin, TX",96,100,24,5.0,9/29/2015,The deep dish pizza is good with a nice crust. If you have a chance to enjoy a weekday lunch try the endless soup and salad offer. Chicken tortilla soup is excellent. Much better quality than competitors. Friendly service every time. It does get busy on most evenings but I've never been disappointed.
Javier A.,"Cedar Park, TX",42,6,20,4.0,9/16/2015,"The beer, the food, the ambiance.  This place has it all. I have never had a bad experience here. And go ahead and try the calamari. It's sublime."
Sarah S.,"Austin, TX",0,28,,1.0,9/20/2015,"One star is generous. I've been to BJ's in San Antonio, and the food and service was stellar. I took my family in Austin here, hoping for the same experience. Avoid this particular BJ's. I do have hope for the chain, though. To compare locations... In San Antonio, at dinner time on Sunday for a table of two we had to wait almost 30 minutes for a table- the place was packed!  At this location, my family of 6 was seated immediately in an empty restaurant. The waiter disappeared with our IDs for an awkward amount of time because he was suspicious. (Why would we use fake IDs with our elderly parents at dinner at a mediocre restaurant??) Despite being the only table in his section, the waiter mixed up our drinks and entrees. The vegetables were undercooked and looked brown compared to the bright green featured in the menu. The food was edible, but not spectacular tasting. Most definitely not worth the price tag attached."
Rochelle R.,"Austin, TX",52,29,38,4.0,8/20/2015,This place is yummy. No wait in line. Service is fantastic. Quick. Friendly. Great presentation. The stuffed mushrooms and potato skins were some of the best I have ever had.
Sophia P.,"Austin, TX",15,83,41,5.0,1/20/2016,"Never had a problem here. Staff is always nice and pleasant. Mr.Deliciousness always brings out our food with a smile and joke! Root beer wings & avocado rolls are pretty dang amazing, along with the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. My favorite is the SALTED CARAMEL PIZOOKIE!!!!! So delicious! They have a cookie, in a mini pizza pan (hence piz-ookie) they put 2 scoops of ice cream on top and have some caramel drizzled. Yummy."
