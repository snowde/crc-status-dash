Mandy D.,"Fort Collins, CO",482,61,283,3.0,1/24/2015,"The atmosphere and bar very nice. Comfortable to hang out in and watch sports if that's what you're into.  Unfortunately, the prices of their mediocre food are jacked up under the guise of being an upscale restaurant.  Most of the food probably is ordered frozen. They don't make a point to get fresh or local ingredients. I ordered a burger that was pretty middle of the road, and the slaw it came with was completely wilted. I appreciate that they include nutrition information on their ""enlightened"" menu, but it would be nice if they put as much care into the quality of the food."
Charlie B.,"El Paso, TX",17,77,156,4.0,8/26/2015,"My first experience at this place was at the El Paso location, and I just wasn't impressed! The food was just not to my liking and too much on the plate! Fast forward to 2015 and my friend suggests this place in Austin. I noticed that the restaurant experience in El Paso and Austin differ from each other. Service was fast, friendly, and not a lot of chatter from the server, which I enjoy! I'm glad I came with my friend, because she is familiar with the menu and cocktails, she new I wanted healthy options! To start off I had the Twisted Spinach Salad, delicious with bacon crumbles, a light vinaigrette, and feta cheese.  Next came the 2 grilled chicken pitas, never had this, and I loved it! I got so full, I was able to take the other one back to the hotel! It came with a side of some cold quinoa salad, very good, and I wanted more! The drink was also delicious, yes it had some kind of alcohol and strawberries, I just forgot the name. I'll be back, and I'll give the El Paso location another chance, 3rd time a charm?"
Violet O.,"Round Rock, TX",1,25,2,3.0,1/23/2017,"I've taken the kids here a few times. If traffic is bad on our way home I will stop here rather than sit in traffic. There's sports on the TV's, service is pretty fast and they give the kids the usual little coloring sheets to keep them occupied. The food is alright, pretty good.  Last time we were here I put in the order for my kids food as soon as we sat down. Couple of minutes later I put in my own order. I thought this would keep them happy while I ate. However somehow my order got lost so my kids got their orders finished eating and I still haven't received mine. Management apologized and got my order out as quick as possible and it tasted fine but by then the kids for animals which made things difficult. It's probably just a simple oversight but it definitely made for a difficult evening and in the future I will be sure to place orders at the same time!"
Travis H.,"Cedar Park, TX",10,15,2,4.0,7/15/2016,Went to BJs for our monthly team birthday celebration. Great service and good food. It is a chain but I would rather come here then Applebee's.
GG M.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,42,6,5.0,12/22/2016,Excellent Food and service !! Had the salmon w quinoa and hubby had the rib eye..... both delish !! Service was above and beyond !!!
Riley L.,"Denton, TX",128,176,58,4.0,4/9/2015,"The beer selection is good and the BJ beers are almost all amazing. The menu is WAY too crowded and big and it's overwhelming, but once you find something you like you can always order it because everything I've had is great and worth ordering again."
Catherine B.,"Austin, TX",451,105,298,4.0,3/20/2014,"Yes, I know it's a chain.  Yes, I know there are plenty of other awesome places to represent austin.  Yes, I know they didn't brew onsite.  Yes, I am aware I'm giving this place a 4/5 stars.  I like this particular BJ's mostly because it reminds me of a similar family bar chain based out of Georgia called Taco Mac. I also like this place because of the bartender Joe.  Poor Joe has seen us in there a multitude of times and it kills me that he still has to follow the corporate ""script"" of up selling and whatnot. We know he has to. I worked my way through Chili's for goodness sakes and they'd send out secret shoppers to ensure we were even offering the Presidente Margarita to every effing lunch patron, otherwise we'd be written up.  But I digress.  I've always been there for lunch hours where their beers are on happy hour lunch prices. Joe has always been the bartender and he remembers us and knows my adoration for their Nutty Brewnette, which is a poor man's version of my favoritism beer on the plant, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar. He is always accommodating and can suggest the yummiest foods.  Looking for something unique, opt for the bruschetta bites as a tasty palate driver before your meal. Their chicken tortilla soup is the jam with a fabulous presentation. They may go a bit overboard with the cheese, which, let's face it, I'm totally cool with.  I'm waiting to try some of their more gluttonous options, but I know Joe will always steer us in the right direction."
Sandy N.,"Sacramento, CA",266,876,2178,2.0,7/6/2015,"I ordered curbside delivery online. They were 10 mins late on my food. We asked for silverware and they didn't even give us any in the bag.n We didn't know until we got back to our hotel. Luckily, the hotel had forks for us to use."
Jacquelyn C.,"Austin, TX",79,26,1,1.0,4/10/2015,"Will not eat here again. Came on a friend's recommendation... the decor was kind of upscale looking but really mixed and ill fitting. The menu had way too many items on it: totally a bad sign. They got steak, pizza, pasta, fish, you name it... which means it's all crappy. I wasn't terribly hungry so I got some small plates/appetizers, their ""gourmet"" macaroni and avocado egg rolls. Both were unappetizing, greasy, and nearly flavorless. The beverages are too sweet. The pizza was mediocre. The deserts were a messy abuse of sugar and chocolate. The host refused to seat us at a booth, when there were three booths open the entire time we were there and never occupied. The waiter was new but nice, but because of this service was slow and spent the entire time with our menus on our table and didn't order dinner until after we finished our appetizers?  When I asked the waiter about what fruit was in ""seasonal fruit cobbler"", of course he didn't know. He went to his boss and asked, and came back and told me what ""seasonal fruit"" they had, which was melon, grapes, etc. I'm like... that's a weird cobbler? He checked again and it turns out it's always a mixed berry cobbler. There's so much stuff on this menu that they don't even know what they serve! This menu could be cut down by like 90% and they could focus on quality over quantity. Overall, for not that much food for four people and poor quality food at that, we walk out of there with some ridiculous $110+ tab.  We could've gone somewhere decent for that much money! I regret the decision to eat there so much. Long story short, this is McDonalds level with a cruddy facelift. I don't know where these 4 and 5 star reviews are coming from at all. I wish I had my money back."
Brett B.,"Austin, TX",0,6,,1.0,7/6/2016,"Getting to big for their own good, no pasta with our chicken Alfredo WOW. This place is a con. Recommended olive garden. UNREAL. even called to ask to add the pasta they said it would be an extra charge."
Bill G.,"Austin, TX",50,171,94,3.0,7/24/2012,"Stopped by BJ's real quick to have a drink and a snack. I've been here several times and the experience is just a-ok. Similar to TGIFridays, Chili's and Chotchkey's without all of the flair. Ha!  Burgers are alright as well as the other appetizers. The drinks I've had have made me think about better drinks I've had at other places. Whiskey sour - OK,  Margarita - Meh,  Light Ale - Meh, Old fashion adult spiked cherry soda - Blah...they use Pepsi. OK, I've been here 4 times now but only for drinks and snax / app's. I will go again and have a real meal someday and I may change my rating. At this point though, I think someone may have to twist my arm to get me to go back. Maybe out of shear convenience. Good looking folks at happy hour is a plus."
Sayeh K.,"Austin, TX",8,13,6,5.0,3/3/2016,"Almost 3 to 4 time a week I go to BJ's,but in this week I been there almost every night because of the new chocolate beer, the best ever beer I had in my life ,I am not a big fan of the chain restaurant but I really recommend it,the food is great and tasty and this place has very nice atmosphere, nice service, the best thing is they are open until 12 or 1 am. Definitely be back."
Jesse W.,"Dallas, TX",55,182,189,5.0,5/15/2014,"Yeah, the lunch specials and the pizza.. Woo, It's a very nice place to go. I really enjoyed my time spent there. The atmosphere was really nice, calm and very well done. The service was very attentive, professional demeanor, and well groomed. Very enjoyable"
Mike S.,"San Antonio, TX",15,5,,1.0,2/4/2016,"The food was okay, there are better locations. I went in around 7 and had the server by the name of Jesus and he was terrible. He barely said three words and never acknowledged us. I will not be returning to this location."
Jourdan D.,"Seattle, WA",33,55,19,5.0,3/24/2016,I went here today to have a drink with my husband and I had excellent service from Sedrick at the bar!  He was very enthusiastic about recommending beers for us and he gave us samples of other things that he thought we would like.  We just stopped in for one drink and he still treated us like we were much appreciated clientele.  We appreciated him!  We also had amazing service the last time we were there.  The food was delicious too!  Those brussel sprouts!!  Yumm!!
Quinn M.,"Allen, TX",39,2,14,1.0,2/20/2015,"Overall slow service here. I have been to locations in Plano with great service and food. Although it has been some time since I have been to BJ's, I was baffled to find the pizza I ordered did not come with pizza sauce. I was expected to order it separately from my pizza. Pizza doesn't come with pizza sauce. That is cheesy bread. Below average cheesy bread.  Very confused why pizza would be called 'pizza' on the menu without pizza sauce."
Theresa H.,"Pflugerville, TX",7,6,,1.0,5/27/2016,My husband and daughter in law and grandkids had dinner tonight. .first its really expensive ...I had the French dip and wedge fries....the sandwich was terrible and the fries were dry and cold...we won't be back!!!!
Jeff L.,"El Granada, CA",32,281,9,3.0,4/2/2015,"This is exactly what you know it will be, McDonalds of Brew Pubs. But I can say that the service was great, the waiter refilled our glasses a million times with ice tea. I had a bowl of chili that was a 2 1/2 out of 5 but I had the Kale salad and it was pretty darn good. I had it before at BJ's and this was a little better than other locations.  My partner had a pizza and said it was pretty tasty but he's from Colorado so he doesn't now pizza. I think that the burger is probably the best choice for lunch but I wanted a salad."
Daniel F.,"Nederland, TX",0,23,3,3.0,7/21/2015,"This place does everything well, but nothing amazing.  The variety is huge and the service was above average.  However, at the end of the day, it just feels like every other middle class American food chain restaraunt. I could see stopping here for a quick meal, but with so many other unique places nearby, this isn't the first place you should consider."
Paola V.,"Jersey City, NJ",7,43,20,1.0,10/24/2014,"If you're going to have condescending waitstaff, at least make sure your food is on point. A group of us went last week and our server managed to: -ID ONLY the females in the group (even though the males were younger and everyone ordered alcohol) -Question why some of us ID'ed females had out of state licenses (If you can believe this not everyone's exes live in Texas) -Question beer selection (""Why did you order that one? It isn't your favorite IPA is it?"") -Mess up a side salad order (Third time's a charm, right?) -Mislead about mac & cheese not being instant/out of the box when asked (Disclaimer: the mac and cheese is the same you can buy from a grocery store but we shouldn't have trusted our server when her description was ""Uh, it's NOT Kraft."") -Not inform us that BJ's does not do ""floaters"" for their drinks and charged double when a cocktail was ordered with a floater. BJ's, you try too hard with your menu and deserve a fail whale medallion."
