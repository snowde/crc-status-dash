Joey S.,"Hamilton, OH",10,134,208,4.0,10/24/2017,"Stopped in here for a late dinner one night with a friend.  Normally I don't eat at too many chain restaurants if I can help it, but as it was getting late and my friend really enjoys this place (and the Mexican place next to it.)  I figured why not.   I ordered the Chicken Pita Taco's, which surprised me by being very good considering it was a chain restaurant. Service was very good as well the young man that waited on us was attentive, but not hovering (he had several tables, and did a nice job of just checking in and filling water glasses as needed; we didn't even have to ask) For dessert (yep I love desserts) I order the small monkey bread pizookie.  It was okay, not amazing, basically just monkey pull apart bread with ice cream on top.   If and when I go back I will try the BJ'S Baked Beignet as it at least appears to even look yummy on a menu."
Wanda M.,"Indianapolis, IN",466,716,5597,4.0,9/25/2017,"BJ's is another of the new brewhouses popping up throughout the Indy area in Avon on Rockville Road. Our first experience, week one,  wasn't a very postive experience but the Manager, Desmond, went above and beyond to correct the various situations. The bar area is first come seating so we opted for a tall top in the bar area. The highlights were a 20 minute wait for our server, slow service even after identifying server, food allergy wasn't adhered to either by the waitress or kitchen, appetizer came out with entree,  entree delivered not as ordered and returned only to be returned with the allergy ingredient. By now we had decided to write BJ's off our rotation. However the food was good after correcting the order and Desmond worked hard to correct the problems. I'm happy to say since then we've had many uneventful visits. Now after months we seem to encounter either appetizers coming out with meal or one item overcooked or allergy item appears. It's been hit or miss. However, when the order is correct we really enjoy the food. Hence, we continue to go back. BJ Oasis Amber is excellent and one of my husbands favorite. Similar to October Fest, less hoppy and a little spicer. There are 10 house beers on tap, 4 seasonal house beers, 28 bottled beers and a full bar. The Bloody Mary has a tasty, smokey mix and nice for brunch. Growlers are also available. The menu is enormous with 6 pages of beers, wine, and cocktails alone. A large variety of appetizers, salads, sandwiches and entrees make it easy to select someone for most everyone's taste buds. We enjoy their lunch menu and I particularly enjoy their personal size pizza and salad. The Chicken Wings are tasty and drizzled in hot & spicy buffalo sauce.   The North Beach Mahi-Mahi and Shrimp is light with fresh ingredients. The Mahi is oven roasted seasoned with their own Big Poppa Smokers' Desert Gold Rub, with sauteed shrimp, red onions, tomatoes, Kalakaua olives with spicy garlic then served over couscous. One of my favorites. My husband enjoys the BBQ Pulled pork sandwich with their own BJ's Peppered BBQ sauce then topped with crispy onion strings served with crispy-thin French Fries. My go-to entree is the Roasted Chicken & Spinach Quinoa Bowl with roasted chicken seasoned again with their Big Popper's Smokers' Desert Gold Rub, sautéed red onions, mushrooms, spinach and seasoned tomatoes served over quinoa. Always good and I love all the veggies.  The Managers have worked hard to correct issues and they continue to say ""They can't correct what they don't know about"" so speak up if your unhappy. On the flip side of the coin, let them know when your meal was great."
Danielle S.,"Indianapolis, IN",153,58,56,5.0,9/6/2017,"The Avon location at BJ's brewhouse has surprised me by being a consistently decent restaurant to get a nice dinner for the past couple of years--something to be said for a chain location. I've been here quite a few times with different friends and always had great service and my food has always been really good to great.  From the minute you walk in, a hostess will greet you with a smile. I have never been to this place when Rockville Road is really busy. So I can't speak for Friday night, or game night crowds and how the service might change when they are busy. On weeknights and we can lunch times when I've been here, the servers are great. My last visit specifically, the server mentioned she had been there five years. I was eating lunch with my mother-in-law, and she was able to ask about certain menu items and the waitress was very knowledgeable about ingredients that were in them.  It's always nice to feel like you're getting an honest opinion and real answers to your questions, rather than getting sold on the most expensive menu items on the menu for the sake of a bigger tip.  Our waitress was also very good about bringing water and offering refills. She offered to bring to go cups when she brought our bill as well. A nice touch.  As far as the menu, BJ's brewhouse can be overwhelming. This is where having a knowledgeable waitress really comes in handy. The menu is as large as a small book, at least 10 pages. My favorite is the pizza, deep dish of course. They also have a decent veggieburger, but it's a little spicy. Their french fries are amazing. The only thing I've ever eaten here that I've not been super impressed with is the salad. The salads are average--made with bagged ingredients, more as an afterthought for the menu. On one occasion, I met with friends and we had drinks. As a brewhouse the bartenders do you know what they're doing. I do not like beer, so I can't speak to those menu items. But some of the mixed drinks specials I've tried (at this location and at Greenwood) are really good.  The only negative I can think of for someone might be the fact that the restaurant can get loud, but it is a brewhouse, with high ceilings and a lot of TVs. So if you walk in and see this, you should probably set your expectations to this. If you go there and hope to have a quiet conversation, my ask for a booth in the corner or at the side of the restaurant, where it tends to be a little more quiet.  I would eat here more often if I lived closer. My next planned trip is to try to make it in on a Monday. I read on the menu that it's half-price pizza and Margarita night. And I think I mentioned before that their deep dish pizza is amazing. If you don't come here for anything else, you have to try the pizza! They do usually have a special if you check in on Yelp! Also, they have take-out and an App in the Apple Store."
Tori C.,"Indianapolis, IN",29,104,92,4.0,6/6/2017,"I went here for dinner once at the recommendation of a friend and it turned out to be a great choice! It's a really nice set up with a spacious bar area. I really liked the inside atmosphere.  The drink menu is cool. They brew their own beers, as well as have imports. There's also a variety of mixed drinks. I got the BJ's Blonde, which is your typical light beer. It was a good choice and I enjoyed it. As for the food, I had the grilled cheese stuffed with buffalo chicken and fries. I highly recommend! It was extremely good. I had enough to bring leftovers home to my boyfriend and even an hour+ later at room temperature, my boyfriend agreed it was delicious. My friend and I also split the avocado egg roll appetizer which I was nervous about because I don't really like avocado or egg rolls. However, it was delicious!! The menu is good with a lot of different choices. It's the kind of place that has something for everyone."
Roxanne T.,"Avon, IN",26,146,264,5.0,10/6/2017,BJ's in our area as sort of knew when they first opened it was always swamped but now they have a convenient app where you can check in online and then wait very minimally when you get there and check in with the hostess I always love their large selection of beers and ciders in their mixed drinks aren't that bad I always seem to get the flatbread pizza and it is so so good my husband he's a little more adventurous and gets a black and blue Burger he loves blue cheese if you're in the area and want a good burger or pizza in you're in the mood for great beer this is your place to be you can even conveniently pay online through the mobile app they usually have a weekday special Mondays it's Pizza Tuesdays it's free dessert so if you ever in the mood for something free and delicious stop by during the week
Sigrid W.,"Indianapolis, IN",107,285,3789,5.0,6/13/2017,"Whenever I have a day off, I like to stop by here for lunch. Yes I like the ample parking, quick seating, friendly and efficient service, managers coming to each table to check if you need anything, the vast selection of dishes and drinks and the reasonable prices along with the sizable portions of food.  But let me address my lunch favorite... pick 2... for less than 10 bucks you can get an infinite combination of food items. My go to is the California Flatbread with the tomato mozzarella salad. OMG... that salad alone is what makes me come back. It is visually stunning. Looks small, all the salad hovers in one corner while zigzag lines of the most delicious balsamic decorate the remainder of the plate. As you fork your salad you need to drag it through the balsamic to get the full flavor. If you like nice ripe tomatoes, marble-sized fresh mozzarella balls and a nice light dressing... well then you just simply have to try this.  The California chicken flatbread is also light, crisp and delicious. Chicken, avocado on the thinnest flatbread you can imagine... wonderful. Of course I tend to mess up my healthy lunch by topping it off with one of their mini pizzookies. Salted caramel is my downfall. Yummy cookie topped with ice cream and caramel drizzle... I mean, really, who could resist?  Also I would like to encourage folks to donate a few dollars to their beer for heroes program. You can buy a teacher a beer (as they are vastly underpaid in my opinion). And let's face it folks, after dealing with today's youth all day long, they are ready and deserving of a brew."
Sankofa T.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,1,,2.0,1/2/2018,"Allow me to preface that I am NOT a disgruntled customer. Nobody treated me badly, the service was cool, and the food was warm. I am giving an objective, unbiased review. I went to this restaurant with my girl, to go somewhere of which we didn't have any knowledge. Simple review Pros - 1) Authentic house made menu. Their fruit drinks are really fruit drinks. (Didn't care for it as much, but...) 2) Good service. It wasn't outstanding, but the normal good service. Good. 3) The cookies n cream piezookie was AMAZING!!! Cons -  1) They didn't have any complimentary bread, which I feel is the standard for a good restaurant. 2) The food was just, well, bad. We had their steak, which was bland, and their jambalaya, which was waaaay too seasoned. Also, we had their mac n cheese couscous, which was okay in my opinion, but my girl thought it tasted like play-do. (I understand why she said that) 3) The prices were on the high side, not because it broke the bank, but in relation to what you can get at a Cheddar's, Texas Roadhouse, or some other restaurant, which all are better options in taste and quanity, is too expensive. In summary, it would be a one star if it wasn't for that cookie. That cookie salvaged the experience."
Travis S.,"Greenwood, IN",107,12,,5.0,12/30/2017,Great selection of BJ brewed beer. Love the selection in the menu. The Italians vegetable penne is my favorite dish. This is an easy go-to for my family thanks to the menu options and fantastic flavor.
Asia A.,"Indianapolis, IN",1,12,3,3.0,1/6/2018,"With BJ's being a chain restaurant, I'm used to a certain standard of food when I go. Unfortunately, when I arrived at 9 pm, the food delivered to the table for my guest and I was quite cold. Instead of replacing the order, since the waitress didn't return for about 20 minutes, I was satisfied with quietly departing, and receiving a refund. All in all, I will continue to visit this restaurant because I love the large variety of food choices, the desserts, and the decor of this restaurant. This was maybe just a one off, not so great experience."
Brian F.,"Fort Wayne, IN",1,8,11,4.0,8/6/2017,"This places passes a better than average chain. But it's obvious that it's a chain. They pump you up with great menu descriptions and the food is good; not great. I think I will use them as a safe place when we need something, but it's not a take them to impress them type of place. Atmosphere is great, decor is great, service is better than average. If you having trouble making a decision then this is a good place because they have so many different types of food. But as most foodies understand; places that offer lots means they don't specialize in anything. I think that best sums up my opinion."
Justin C.,"Indianapolis, IN",23,168,28,4.0,12/13/2017,"The BJ's in Avon rests where the TGI Friday's used to be in front of the Target shopping center on restaurant row and is part of the brewhouse concept a'la Rock Bottom, Ram, Granite City and so on. The menu is pretty gigantic with something for everyone and it even includes an Enlightened section for people trying to watch their calories. The choices on the kids menu are pretty wide as well. The beer selection is pretty vast, as one would expect, and also covers the spectrum. I'd say the theme of BJ's is having things covered for everybody. My experience at this location was pleasant. The dining room and restrooms were all clean along with a friendly and knowledgeable staff. I opted for one of their house IPAs and was very satisfied with it. My sirloin was very tasty and a good portion for the price. My only issue is that the entrees did not look very much like they were pictured in the menu when they arrived at the table. Prices are just below the ""pricey"" side and I would say it is an average value."
Trisha H.,"Plainfield, IN",21,95,33,5.0,10/18/2017,I had not been to a BJ's in years but went a few nights ago with my sister. We got a flatbread pizza and two of the $3 pizookies. It was an AMAZING late-night dinner! I was impressed by the size of the menu here. The Avon location is still new-feeling - very clean and modern. The service was great! It looked like they had a decent selection of on-tap beers and a large cocktail menu. I was expecting a cliche chain bar/restaurant but I ended up having a great time! We'll be back!
Chrissy C.,"Carmel, IN",145,218,2666,5.0,7/28/2017,"BJ's is one of the main places I eat. I love it there. I am in Avon 3-4 days a week with my Aunt and she loves it there. It's just so nice to go and they have so many options. They have daily specials. And an app. Get the app for sure. You earn points and the coupons are in the app. You can also pay with the app. I usually don't though. I eat here at least twice a week. My aunt can no longer drive and we go to the movie in Avon and this location is perfect for us. The food is always good. The staff is wonderful. I mean super WONDERFUL! Like I love them. They treat my aunt so well. They laugh at all her stories even though she has told them 3-4 times that same lunch. We usually get there at off time, before or after a lunch or dinner rush. We often get the same table, which my aunt loves. Consistency is key for her.  Mondays is half price pizza. I get her that every few weeks and then she has some to take home. Wednesdays is $10 burgers with unlimited fries. The Portobello burger is my favorite! The pesto is amazing on it. The Portobello as big as the burger. Thursdays is ribs and it comes with 3 sides. My aunt loves the chicken tortilla soup and I love the new lentil soup. Monday-Friday during lunch you can get unlimited soup and salad for around $10. The caprese salad is amazing!  Anyone on Thursdays the ribs also come with a  free mini pizookie. They are wonderful! I love the mini size! And Fridays and Sunday they have been doing prime rib, which she also loves.  The menu has a ton of healthy choices! The salmon quinoa bowl is my go to. I also like the lemon thyme chicken.  They also now have small plates, all veggies, but yum. It's like every time I go they have something even better! I honestly never get tired of eating there. Sometimes my aunt does, but every time we go to MCL instead we spend just as much if not more on mediocre food. And with so many options I can keep it fresh and I always know the food will be good and the service is always wonderful. I know they can be busier on the weekends, but we still get great service. We just know the staff during the week better. As soon as they see us coming they have my Aunt's Diet Pepsi ready to go for her.   Using the coupons and earning points keeps us coming back as well. I don't check in every time we go. I am sure it's closer to 60 times this year."
Linda H.,"Indianapolis, IN",54,129,649,4.0,1/8/2017,"Love coming here to eat. They were busy. It must have been and off night for the cooks they mush have been in a hurry. Hubby got the Sirloin wanted it medium well it came medium rare sent it back came back well well done - like burnt.  I got my favorite Parmesan crusted chicken.  Mashed potatoes and Asparagus two chicken breast pounded out flat with a crispy Parmesan crust. It has a creamy sauce over it sun-dried tomatoes and basil. It is so good.Ate the first breast but the Second one was not done. When our waitress brought us our bill she asked if I wanted a box I told her no it was not cooked it was still pink inside. She didn't care. I didn't want a free meal but a I'm sorry or I'll get the manager,I just wanted some one to know so it wouldn't happen to the next customer. We will definitely go back-won't let this one episode keep us from going."
Tina L.,"Indianapolis, IN",34,47,133,5.0,5/12/2017,"Yes, we were ""those"" customers. The ones that came 45 minutes before closing, but based on our service you would have never known the difference. We had a craving for late night pizza, and this place hit the spot! The Pepperoni Extreme is a must try! The medium was enough for the 3 of us."
Meenarin P.,"Indianapolis, IN",66,81,328,4.0,1/28/2017,Dining here for the first time and spent 45 mins waiting for table. Parmesan chicken with mashed potatoes  is so good. I will defined go back again but not on Saturday night
Samantha P.,"Indianapolis, IN",286,249,212,5.0,6/11/2017,"I am surprised this place gets such average reviews, maybe a few too many negative reviews from when it first opened up? Who knows, I tend to avoid places when they've just opened so maybe it was more rough back then. This has become our go-to chain restaurant date spot, that's a thing, right? It is very close to our house and has generous hours so we've been able to have late dinners here when we're busy and not feel like an inconvenience with the servers. In fact, that might be one of the reasons I like it so much - we've had excellent servers, every time. Patient, attentive and helpful.  The food has also always impressed! I have a had a few different things here and it's been generous size portions and great flavor. Good club sandwich, good pizza and good fries, basically my three favorite foods, haha. The menu is quite large which is kinda random and made me worried that it would all be mediocre but hasn't let me down yet!  But let's talk about the real gem on the food menu - the pizookies. They are those big cookies baked into a circle pan that comes topped with ice cream and other delicious additions. Goodness, they are amazing. They aren't burnt to a pan like other competitors, they aren't a blah flavor, they are a pan of delight. I have tried a few flavors and they are all great - the monkey bread one is a bit different and kinda tastes like Cinnabon!  Another really cool thing about BJ's is they have a rewards program and send lots of coupons! Think free apps and discounts on entrees - yes please! Their beer and hand crafted sodas are excecllent - overall, this place has not let me down yet, yes, I just said that about a chain restaurant.  Ok this review is getting long and making me want a pizookie so I'm gonna have to end it now!"
Scott E.,"Avon, IN",18,11,,3.0,11/6/2017,The food is really run of the mill.  The pizzia is the best this g on the menu.  While the food is not fabulous the service is perfect every time
Zachery S.,"Indianapolis, IN",94,5,1,5.0,11/5/2017,This was a amazing place.  Our server was very on top of the menu.  Having recommendations and additions( not up sells).  The restaurant was busy and our group was slightly in the way but the staff never once made us feel that way.  I can't possibly rave about them and the staff more than I have.  Food was great and service was 125%.  Good job  I will gladly come back  every chance that I can
Bridget K.,"Indianapolis, IN",114,170,272,4.0,12/10/2016,"I'm updating my review and giving another star because I finally found something here that I would come back and order again! The buffalo chicken grilled cheese, yum! It was very tasty and the sandwich alone would keep me coming back :)!"
Kevin J.,"Indianapolis, IN",60,4,,5.0,10/8/2017,Was in around 530 on a Saturday service was good (she was new but well trained) didn't have to ask for anything she was on top of her game.  Pizza was great.
Mark S.,"Avon, IN",27,170,219,5.0,3/9/2017,"This place is our favorite ""chain"" restaurant in Indy. A wide selection of food, beer, drinks and deserts that we always order 1st as our appetizer. Top quality - well prepared and all at a down to earth cost ----ohh as long as you use the coupons and the BJ's APP. Greg is the best servers in the business and we look forward to seeing him weekly! Keep up the great work Greg!"
Karina S.,"Ann Arbor, MI",2,15,17,2.0,9/10/2017,Went here on a Saturday night. It's looks pretty posh. So we dressed the part.  Unfortunately the food wasn't worth it... the avocado egg rolls didn't look like the photo in the menu as they were overcooked and the avocado was turning brown. We will only be back for beer as the food was average but over-priced.
Doug W.,"Indianapolis, IN",3,44,1,4.0,2/25/2017,First time back in about a year.   We arrived at the perfect time-about 5:30.   When we left the much too small waiting area was  so full we had issues getting through the crowd.    The food was quite good.    Our hamburgers came with a very nice amount of fries.    When we first arrived the table next top us was extremely loud.   The ladies should  have been at a bar based on their alcohol intake  and loudness.    Our waiter was nice and attentive.   I did not understand why the TV we were closest too was on the NHL network on a college basketball Saturday.
Doug J.,"Charlotte, NC",12,3,,5.0,6/2/2017,"Love BJ's, in Avon IN, Good food great service.  Had the new chips and cheese appetizer and it is wounderful.  Love the cucumber added to the cheese sauce.   Mist of all the service is always above excellent.  When I need pick me up the atmosphere, food and the works always find a way to make the day a little better."
Matt N.,"Indianapolis, IN",176,8,,2.0,5/20/2017,Was too expensive for what we ordered.. received the mozzarella sticks and a tiny marinara. Need way more marinara than just a tablespoon. The bun for the burger was either too big or not enough burger patty.  Overall not great but not horrible.. way too expensive for what we got!
Michelle A.,"Indianapolis, IN",29,134,77,5.0,12/3/2016,My husband and I went on a Saturday night around 6 pm. The place was packed and we were told it would be a 45 minute wait for a table for 2 or we could sit at the bar. We chose the bar! The bartender Ashley was amazing. Very friendly and great service. She also had great suggestions on the menu and beer. The food was great. My ribeye was seasoned and cooked perfectly. My husband had a bacon and brisket sandwich and said the BBQ sauce was great. He can't wait to try the ribs for the sauce! And as always the mashed potatoes were perfect! We will definitely be back!
John M.,"Avon, IN",304,117,226,5.0,8/11/2015,"Wins:  Packed out parking lot - was seated in leads than 5 minutes Super friendly wait staff Boast award winning beers and sodas made in house, and a SoCal spin on Chicago deep dish pizza My burger (brisket bacon) was heaven in my mouth. The bacon was cooked perfectly; the burgers come as a standard medium well; the barbecue sauce was great, not spicy; and the thin cut fries were fine, worked well for sopping up BBQ sauce I'm very impressed with the service, atmosphere and very pleased with the quality of food. I will be going back!"
Nikeita P.,"Towson, MD",152,171,161,2.0,1/12/2017,"Great experience, bad results.  We were the last customers to arrive and the only ones there before closing so I ordered what I considered to be a ""safe meal"" the BJ's Brewhouse Burger and the Gluten Free Pizookie.  Everything was great until we left the restaurant and I started feeling queasy. I chalked it up to the ice cream/diary and figured it would get better.  Well 6 hours later I woke up to terrible cramping and (slight tmi warning) had to relieve myself normally and through vomiting before I felt much better. I don't know if it was food poisoning or not but I'm sure glad that food & dessert is out of my system and I feel normal again.  The burger was fine but I did vomit some of the tomatoes so maybe it was a combo of both that did not agree with me."
Jake D.,"Indianapolis, IN",20,17,2,5.0,6/14/2017,"Many repeat trips to the BJ's here in Avon and they've never disappointed.  Avocado egg rolls, salad combos, decent house brews with great local choices and decor keep us coming back."
Tim G.,"Plainfield, IN",27,132,145,4.0,10/9/2016,"Generally a good time here.  The hot ham and cheese is amazing and so are the potato skins. The bar has an awesome selection of beers and taps.  The only thing that could improve is that it seems the initial contact with your server takes forever. Like other reviews below me, it takes about 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledges you are there."
Ali J.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,5.0,2/17/2017,Excellent service! I ordered potatoes skins and didn't realize it comes with bacon. They switched it out immediately!
Brie G.,"Chicago, IL",151,326,691,4.0,9/14/2016,"Looking forward to returning to this location again in the future.  We had great, friendly, quick service and ended up getting a discount we weren't expecting!  My bestie and I came here for her birthday dinner.  She ordered a mini pizza and I ordered the California Chicken Club with fries.  We decided to splurge and split one of their signature items - a Pizookie!  We chose the salted caramel one.  When it came out, we noticed that it was a little smaller than normal, but fine by us since we just wanted a few bites.  Turns out, that was her free birthday dessert (a mini from the normal menu trio).  It was perfect!  Also, since we were there during the Colts game, her pizza was half off.  What a deal!  My sandwich was awesome and tasted good even the next day when I finished the other half of this monster.  The fries were fantastic - crispy and thin.  Be sure to ask for honey mustard as they have a good one it seems.  All in all, a great visit."
Brian C.,"Carmel, IN",27,71,218,5.0,4/21/2016,"BJ's Brew-house is pretty great. I have had a few of the beers and so far the new seasonal Magnolia's Peach is my favorite. The Jeremiah Red is also a favorite which is regularly on tap. I do wish they would get a few local beers in since there are so many good ones around town.  The location is large and open inside with a pretty large bar area, but also a lot of tables. The menu is huge. They seem to have a lot of choices. I keep meaning to try the pizza, it always looks good. The shareable apps are fun and large enough to also eat instead of a meal.  The California Chicken Club is great. I have also had a few of the burgers. We are in the area a lot now and it's one of the main places we end up. It's always a good meal and so far we've always had great service."
Ron S.,"Greenwood, IN",86,52,9,4.0,2/21/2017,This place is nicely run and well maintained. I really like the appetizers and entrees. Service was good and the server was knowledgeable as well. I would definitely return back. The stuffed mushroom was so good i just wanted to have another 1. Great job.
Megan V.,"Indianapolis, IN",32,2,,5.0,1/27/2017,"We finally tried BJs tonight and loved it!! From the friendly service, the snack for our toddler, and the delicious food we were impressed and our bellies were full!!  Definitely recommend eating here!"
Jennifer B.,"Avon, IN",71,49,52,2.0,7/18/2016,So disappointed!  I have been here only one other time and did have a great experience.  Went on a Monday for a fundraiser. They made me have a print out of the fundraising flyer. Had to go back home to get it.  Server took over 10 minutes to acknowledge us. The order took almost an hour to arrive. I ordered a turkey burger and it was over cooked and I received cold fries. I ate it because I was hungry and no one checked on us for over 20 minutes after our food arrive. Server stopped by only 3 times all evening.  Going to try it one more time in hopes it was a fluke!
Chrissy A.,"Brownsburg, IN",71,307,466,4.0,2/16/2016,This place is pretty good.  I had heard mixed reviews.  Went on a Tuesday which was half priced wine night (woot woot).   The ahi salad may just be the most delicious fresh salad I have ever eaten.  Worth every penny.   Great beer selection.  Personally I like this place.  Service was pretty good.  Very clean.
Jen F.,"Indianapolis, IN",131,313,209,3.0,10/17/2015,"Um, I like the look of the place.  Their beer selection is great.  Service is wonderful.   Chips & Salsa are good.  Salsa is smokey and delicious.  Guacamole is a little bland.   The roasted Brussels sprouts taste okay, but the putrid pink sauce they cover them in is just so unappealing.  The sprouts had obviously been pre-cooked and then reheated which zapped most of the crispness.  The rest was destroyed by the pepto-bismol colored drizzle.   Ahi tuna salad & chicken barbacoa were pretty good.   Our service was exceptional.   I'm sure we'll try it again."
Karla R.,"Pendleton, IN",0,6,,5.0,2/25/2017,"So happy a new one has opened near me! Lots of good menu choices, the staff is friendly and efficient."
