Frank E.,"Avon, IN",0,8,2,5.0,8/24/2015,"I had the lunch special pan pizza with wedge salad, 6.99.  Both were excellent.  Service was fast and friendly.  I love the BJs ap.  Saved 20% using their ap to pay."
J M.,"Danville, IN",0,2,,3.0,11/18/2015,"Dissapointing.  The portions were small and my wife's came late and cold.  The server and manager got involved with the corrections and comped her meal. I'd give the service 4 stars for the effort but all around experience was a 2 or 3.  In all fairness, my son has been there since I have and had a great experience.  I'll try again if somebody forces me."
Jennifer B.,"Brownsburg, IN",0,3,,3.0,1/4/2016,Service was just ok (took way too long for refills and to get our check and the place was dead at the time) and the place is clean. The music playing was so loud I could not hear the people in my group. Feel it is overpriced for what you get and quality. It was just so-so. I got a burger and fries but it was nothing special. Beer selection seems great though. Not sure if I will be giving this place another try.
Samantha P.,"Clinton, IN",26,1,,4.0,9/14/2015,"Berry blast is super tasty. Alex is a charming fellow and great waiter! Can't wait to try the kale and busses sprout salad. It was delicious especially with pasta bread,"
Karen M.,"Avon, IN",0,3,,1.0,6/7/2016,"I can't believe I'm even having to give this place a star but, I must do that to write this.  I have visited this place on several occasions always at a friends suggestion because they have never been there or have talked me into giving it yet another chance.  Well...I don't care how much anyone would like to dine here I will definitely NOT be a member of their party.  The first few times I just chalked it up as being new and working out the tweaks...well I'm tweaked-out.  My last and FINAL visit was a dining nightmare.  I ordered an appetizer of fried portabella mushrooms and they arrived soaked in grease and cold.  Then my cup of tomato bisque arrived and the soup was congealed and clearly broken.  You could visibly see the oil floating in pools on the top and it too was cold.  I could only eat a few bites and set it aside.  The server (not very attentive) took the full bowl away without asking if there was anything wrong.  Maybe she is just used to people not eating their food.  Finally our food arrived and there was a lot of confusion with trying to fit plates on the table (nothing had been cleared except my full bowl of soup) and after the servers figured out who had what and what was missing I was presented with another bowl of what appeared to be soup.  I had ordered a Mahi-Mahi and shrimp dish which was supposed to be a spice rubbed mahi-mahi with sautéd shrimp...supposed to be...it was horrid.  If the fish had ever seen a rub it must have floated away.  The fish and shrimp were literally floating in a sea of red broth with absolutely no flavor at all.  I doubt the fish or the shrimp had ever seen a pan as it all tasted like boiled seafood.  The shrimp tasted like it came from a bag full of frost bite and I would have fared better going to the local grocery picking up previously frozen shrimp from the seafood case.  I had one shrimp and offered one to another diner in my party and he agreed.  I had a bite of fish and just as horrid.  No flavor at all and no Big Poppa Smokers Desert Gold Rub in sight...apparently there must have been a gold rush in the bowl my fish was swimming in and it had been panned out.  I sent it back and while the manager came and asked if I would like something else, he did not ask what was wrong with the food I ordered. I declined to order another dish as this was not the first time they had disappointed.  The other diners (we had 3 adults, 3 teens and one young person) were satisfied with their food but, said they wouldn't put it on a list of ""must go to"" for a great dining experience.  They said the food was average and something you could get at any brew pub.  They did try to order dessert but, I put a stop to that as I've made that mistake before.  I had their ""monkey bread"" once and it was hard and so cold it didn't even melt the ice cream.  I was fortunate that I left with all my teeth intact after trying that once.  Definitely not going to give them another try...wish I hadn't this time..."
Taylore F.,"Avon, IN",0,1,,4.0,11/2/2015,"My finace and I arrived about 3:30 and we were seated promptly. We were greeted in under a minute by a very happy and cordial server. Our server was very knowledgeable and gave great recommendations. I settled on a grilled chicken club which was phenomenal! It took about 20 minutes to receive out order, which would be my only complaint. However, for a new restaurant they are doing great! Will definitely return to try some of their extensive beer selection."
David O.,"Plainfield, IN",0,2,,5.0,10/29/2015,Sriracha Dry Rub Wings are outstanding along with the mini pan pizza's. Piranha Pal Ale is a great craft beer also.
Amy K.,"Avon, IN",0,3,,2.0,10/22/2015,"After waiting just a short time to sit down, seemed at least 10-15 minutes to be recognized,  drinks took another 10. My sons meal came out 15 minutes before ours still wondering why it didn't come out with the rest of our food none the less he was done eating shortly after our dinner arrived, which led to him rushing us bc he was bored. Food just ok, my opinion is they are way over priced. My return will not be likely. Stick with Chili's or Applebee's.  Much better food."
Dionne S.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,7,1,2.0,9/27/2015,"This was our first visit, and there was definitely something lacking with the kitchen.  There were 4 of us, and we ordered 4 salads, 2 pizzas and 2 desserts.  Two salads arrived but no silverware.  We waited for the other salads and silverware.  We were then told that they had run out of silverware.  The two pizzas arrived but still no silverware and the other 2 salads were missing.  Finally we had salads and silverware after much confusion.  When we ordered our desserts one of them was the wrong one.  So once again we had 1/2 of our order.  Our waitress was very pleasant and the manager came over and just sort of apologized.  No compensation though.  Overall a very confusing evening with an awkward eating situation."
Anthony E.,"Bloomington, IN",189,7,,1.0,9/20/2015,"Well, me and my roommate just TRIED to eat here. Hostess didn't seat us, just kind of pointed to an area by the bar and told us to find our table. Then we sat and were completely ignored for fifteen minutes before walking out. No one even made eye contact with us. I'm sure the food here is great but the front of house is totally abysmal. P.S. There was a kid seated at one of the tables by the open bar which I'm pretty sure is illegal. Thanks for nothing BJ."
