Mackensy A.,"Terre Haute, IN",86,6,,2.0,2/12/2017,We were seated right next to the front door so everyone (and their screaming kids) waiting for their table were standing right next to us  our server was slower than molasses in January. I got the salmon quinoa plate and hubby got the ribeye. Food was decent.
Nick J.,"Indianapolis, IN",243,94,2,2.0,5/8/2016,"We didn't have a bad experience at all, but it certainly wasn't good enough for us to go back with the prices. We ordered a deep dish pizza for $20+. I was expecting something akin to Chicago where you eat two slices and are stuffed. Here, I could have eaten the whole thing. A good quarter of the pizza was crust, which, again, for $20+, should not be the case. The portion with toppings on it was good enough, but nothing to write home about. Service was good and the interior is nice. The food simply wasn't worth the 30-min wait to sit down or the cost."
Holly G.,"Danville, IN",238,57,15,5.0,12/3/2016,"My husband and I love this location. The service is always good. Twice it's been so busy we sat at the bar. Honestly, those visits were the most fun. The bartenders  are always attentive and the multiple games on is a fun time. The chicken pot stickers and BJ's Favorite deep dish are two favorite dishes. I also liked the flat bread pizza a lot. The lettuce wraps had decent flavor, but the portion is ridiculously small. I'll go to Yard House for lettuce wraps and stick to the pizza here."
Alanna F.,"Wayne, Indianapolis, IN",9,1,,5.0,3/2/2017,Great food! great service! great atmosphere! love this place! My new favorite go to spot for any lunch or dinner occasion
Eric B.,"Avon, IN",0,11,7,5.0,4/22/2016,"The food is great and the managers are on point,nice clean with all their teeth!        Delicious fresh salad and real juicy burgers that are not dried out.        I don't drink but they have a big beer selection and a clean bar area.        The bathroom is clean and I saw an employee in the bathroom the ""Yes"" he washed his hands before returning to cook our food, great job,but still don't touch the door handle when leaving lol!"
D E.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,21,21,1.0,2/28/2016,"Noisy, with Bland, boring, greasy, overpriced food, and service with a bad attitude.  We were greeted by a hostess who sounded completely blasé and fake in her welcome. Seated in the middle of the busy restaurant, and treated to 10 min of very loud grinding from the bar blender that deafened everyone in the place. Couldn't they do this in the kitchen?  Our server brought our drinks but left us for 14 min before taking our order. We asked if they could make a kids meal out of mozzarella sticks, and she said flat-out NO. We pushed it gently, so she left us ""to go ask"". A very long time later, she reappeared to say ""we absolutely can not do that for you"". I am not exaggerating. That is a quote. So we ordered a full $8.99 order of mozzarella sticks for our 7 yr old daughter. She took one bite and left them. We tried them too. They had the taste and texture of fried Playdoh. These were bad, And I'm not picky about my sticks. I even eat the ones at McDonalds. My husband's chicken fried steak had undetectable breading on it, and tasted dry and tough like a beaten-down over-cooked  bad burger. His mixed veggies looked naked like they were dumped out of a frozen bag. My California chicken club was bland and boring... How can you make bacon with no flavor? The ""sourdough"" bread was just greasy white bread. The ""crispy"" thin fries were soaked with grease and anything but crispy (chewy!). And the heap of soggy sticks featured random dark crunchy lumps of something unrecognizable left in the fryer. Bonus!  The only thing I liked was the crispy fried artichokes. They were a delicious combo of soft, tangy goodness inside and flavorful crunchy breading outside. I should have only ordered those. Too bad I won't be back. I would have ordered those again."
Patricia R.,"Indianapolis, IN",44,7,1,1.0,7/31/2016,"I wanted to take my 2 sisters out for their birthday dinner, and the agreement was on BJ's. First we were told it would be a 50 min wait for our party of 6, so we waited in the heat outside, as there was no room inside in the cool. I went in at 50 minutes to ask how much longer would it be to sit our party, and the hostess told me we were the next large party to be seated, and they were waiting to have a place to seat my nephew who only needed a booster seat not a high chair.  I went outside and told my family and we all went directly inside to get out of the heat. We sat and waited another 20 minutes, listening to parties of 2-5 being called verbally out loud continue to be seated.  Finally my sister saw the text that was sent 8 minutes before while other parties names were be said, but yet our name never was. I shared with the hostess, whom I already inquired about the wait, who was only 3 feet from me during the additional 20 minutes we had waited inside, yet failed to call our party name out loud. She went and talked with the next set of workers who seat patrons, about this yet no one talked to me. A manager came up and talks with the group of employees and was overheard saying, ""Did someone tell them,"" looking  slightly in my direction. I then said, ""No, no one has talked to us or apologized.""  At this time a party of 8 came In and stated that they had waited over an hour and wanted to know how much longer. He was told he was texted an hour prior and he showed his phone showing no such text happened. My party was becoming more agitated as it was now 1 1/2 hours wait, a hungry and antsy 3 year old, a diabetic husband who needed to eat, and hot and frustrated family members. One manager tried to rectify the situation in an apology that wasn't even worth her speaking and wasting her breath and my time and intelligence,  as in the end I felt somehow it was my fault for this error.  Another manager came to seat us and apologies again were said but more hear felt this time. As we passed the other workers that were around and the first manager, my sister felt the manager rolled her eyes at her.  Later she saw the two mangers talking, one glancing at my sister and laughed. My sister shared this with the nicer of the two managers of what she just witnessed between the two managers. The other large table who had nonchalantly been blown off too, sat next to us. Both of us were given complementary luke warm mozzarella sticks as an apology. I would think that if anything, an appetizer of our choice would have been a little more intelligent, as only 1/2 our party would eat the deep fried not so warm sticks, mainly out of the need for something in their system. Our waitress did well trying to recover from our ill feelings of what all occurred, that she had nothing to do with. After spending $125 on mediocre dinner and drinks at best, I saw that no compensation was taken off of our bill, we generously tipped our waitress as we knew none of this experience was her fault, we left this restaurant with such a bad taste in our mouth. Let's just say, we will not recommending this establishment, even after visiting in on several occasions prior."
Brittany C.,"Waverly, MN",178,31,10,4.0,4/14/2016,"I have been to BJ's probably at least 5 times since they have been open. Everyone's food is always tasty and have never had an issue with service.  The Crunchy Ahi Tuna Salad is so good, I get it almost every time. Portion sizes are good for what you pay.  Tortilla Soup is also really good, I thought it was neat that they serve the ingredients in a bowl to you then pour the soup over the fresh ingredients right in front of you.  Great place for groups!"
Jasdip K.,"Plainfield, IN",0,5,,5.0,4/30/2017,"Food is good, but what's even better is the service! I wasn't happy with the way one of my entrees was cooked and they replaced it for me for a different item no questions asked. They even bring out a ""kids starter"" which when you have a toddler you totally appreciate. My favorite item was actually a side tomato and mozzarella salad...like it was so good!"
Duane B.,"Indianapolis, IN",17,12,1,1.0,6/3/2017,Not very well organized ask to seat 7 and it was all hands on deck 6 people and 2 managers To figure out who was working and to slide 2 tables together to seat 7 The place was almost empty easy solution It would've been faster for us to saying 2 tables of 4 that we want to sit next to each-other Waitress was great manager need some training
Troy M.,"Indianapolis, IN",39,5,6,4.0,1/1/2016,"Usually get burgers which are fantastic, but tonight we tried the deep dish pizza. Salad and mozzarella sticks were amazing, pizza was a little dry for my liking. Ask for Angie Payne though when you go, she is awesome waitress"
Jeremy M.,"Indianapolis, IN",254,320,132,3.0,2/2/2016,"We waited a while before checking out this newer addition to Avon's growing list of chain restaurants, but it didn't seem to prevent us from having a pretty mediocre experience. The service was ok, but not overly helpful or friendly. The food was also just ok. We tried one of their ""deep dish"" pizzas. It looked and tasted more like a Pizza Hut pizza than any sort of deep dish pie. Not that it was bad, but it wasn't very special or worth however much we paid for it. If we go back we'll be sure to try something else. Their beer was maybe the one bright spot. They've got a good variety and the ones we tried were pretty good. Nothing mindblowing, but good. All that said, BJ's seemed like a nice place and their menu is varied enough that I wouldn't mind giving them another shot. Hopefully our next visit is more impressive than the last."
Rusty S.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,36,,5.0,11/17/2016,"I have always had good service/food. Have been 5+ times. I recommend the fish and chips or the late night open faced burger. Be prepared to wait at peak times, as I would expect for a popular place to eat."
Dawn G.,"Indianapolis, IN",124,74,115,3.0,12/2/2015,"We stopped into Bj's last Saturday after a wedding.  We didn't eat any of the appetizers offered at the wedding, so by the time we sat down I was so hungry I couldn't even decide what I wanted to eat.  I let my husband choose meals for us to share. He chose the Bj's Favorite deep-dish pizza and the Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger.   The pizza wasn't anything special.  It was good, but you can get a pizza with everything on it anywhere.  The deep-dish crust was good, I will definitely try one of the other pizza selections another time.  I reheated a slice for lunch the next day and I think it tasted better than the night before.   My husband loved the Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger.  I didn't.  The fact that he went on and on about how good it was makes me believe that my displeasure had more to do with my tastebuds than the burger itself.   Maybe I'm just not a fan of the hickory flavor?  Maybe it was too big?  Maybe there were just too many flavors combined for my liking?   Whatever the reason, I wasn't a fan of it, but my husband definitely was.    Service was okay.  Not bad, but not the greatest.   In defense, it was a busy Saturday night and there were a couple of large party tables just sitting down at the same time we were.    I always give restaurants two tries before I give up on them.  We eat out 3 or 4 nights a week.  Being fairly close to home, I would love to be able to put Bj's on our rotation, so we'll definitely give it another shot."
J R.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,15,1,1.0,7/31/2016,We had a party of seven. We waited over an hour and a half.  Then was told they gave our table away.  As we were talking with the manager another group was told the same thing.  Management was not helpful at all.  Our waitress tried to do her best to help make our dinner enjoyable.  Food was average.  I won't be going back. Third or fourth time there.  I would try the greenwood location if I was  you.
Courtney G.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,11,1,4.0,6/19/2016,"We love the atmosphere of this place but the food quality is hit or miss. We keep coming back because the service is always great and my husband loves the beer selection (and I love the black cherry soda). In my opinion, the menu is too big. They should focus on doing a few things really well instead of doing so much ""so-so""."
Lynette A.,"Indianapolis, IN",57,62,31,5.0,2/14/2016,"Update: After they ironed out the kinks, it appears that they have their stuff together now. I usually get seafood and they never fail to deliver. Tons of beer on tap. One of my favorite places in Indy now.  Old review: It looks nice from the outside, but I don't know, I can't get on board with a menu that reads like a damn novel. Seriously? Find 15 things you're REALLY good at and sell those. Why so many options that are all subpar? I ordered chicken alfredo and what I ended up with, now that I'm looking at the menu, was the Sriracha chicken and penne that, if you're not used to spice ... WOW. No wonder it was so spicy! We went when they first opened, so I'll cut them some slack. I've been to the one in Greenwood and loved it, so maybe I just caught them on a bad day. Either way, I wasn't a huge fan, but now I know it was because I was served the wrong meal. Oops!"
Jeff H.,"Apollo Beach, FL",26,14,8,4.0,4/10/2016,"First time to BJ'S. Of course being a brew pub I had to sample some beers. The four that I had were all wonderful. Good tastes, clean finishes.  I went with my whole family.   I ordered a burger and was slightly disappointed.  Was expecting a large juicy burger worthy of the price tag. Was extremely small as compared to a Red Robin burger. Actually looked like pre-made patty was assurred by the staff they were hand formed in-house.  The bun itself was larger than the burger. Restaurant was clean, staff efficient but this store has only been open for about a year. I will return since it is close to home but will try some of the other meal options next time."
Brianna B.,"Avon, IN",23,7,,5.0,10/8/2016,"I had the best experience here at BJ's. I have never had a bad waiter/waitress. Always had fun, great food, and made memories!  This is a great place to eat. I even spent my birthday dinner here"
Palmetto P.,"Charleston, SC",39,21,243,4.0,12/30/2015,"Perfect place to watch a game and enjoy a beer and burger. Lovely atmosphere, but not too loud. Quick and friendly service."
