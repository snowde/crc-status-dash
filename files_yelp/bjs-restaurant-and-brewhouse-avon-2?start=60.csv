Nicholas F.,"Avon, IN",22,1,,5.0,9/8/2015,Met with a bunch of friends so we had a large group but the waiter was kind and prompt. The brisket burger was a gift from Jesus and the Mac and Cheese was one of the best I've ever had. Will definitely be coming back with more people.
Michele R.,"Indianapolis, IN",74,57,28,4.0,1/5/2016,For a chain this place is great. I first tried it in Colorado and now it is in Avon. If you like fish try the Ahi tuna appetizer and the wasabi tuna salad. So good. We did order the pizzocokkie when told how good it was. We thought it was good but it wasn't needed.
Sarah N.,"Avon, IN",73,1,,5.0,10/10/2016,"Ordered the Barbacoa Chicken, a lower calorie option on their menu, and was pleasantly surprised that the portion wasn't huge. Definitely worth it if you're watching calories and trying to make healthier choices."
Robert E.,"Indianapolis, IN",13,92,18,3.0,12/17/2015,I debated between a two or three star rating.  We sat down immediately but waited about ten minutes before anyone took our order.  Then it felt like we were bothering her.  The food came and it was ok.  We had the fried brussel sprouts for an appetizer and it was food.  For the entree I had the east coast mahi mahi and it was dry with an overpowering taste of olives.  The couscous was cooked well but couldn't enjoy it because of the dry fish.   My wife had the Italian ziti and it didn't have enough meat in the dish.   They have plenty of tvs to watch the game but service needs improvement.
Laura S.,"Avon, IN",6,78,120,5.0,12/21/2015,"I love the sourdough bread bowls.  The salads and potatoes are delicious.  The burgers are great.  The pizookies are so good, warm cookies with ice cream.  They even have a gluten free chocolate chip cookie."
Arielle T.,"Indianapolis, IN",33,146,129,1.0,10/25/2015,"I was very disappointed with BJ's. Our server was clearly at the end of her shift and kept attempting to push us along to close out the table. My boyfriend ordered pasta and it had absolutely no flavor. I had the pizza and it was very good. Cut to about a month later, my boyfriend wanted to give it another shot. Yet again, we had terrible service. This time, this server would disappear for long periods of time. It took forever to get drinks and food despite the place only being 1/4 full. We had an appetizer to split and it tasted awful. My boyfriend enjoyed his steak-even though it was mostly fat. We will not be returning."
Julie M.,"Brownsburg, IN",0,13,7,1.0,1/3/2016,Very disappointed in their 'deep dish' pizza.  The pictures of their deep dish pizzas are very misleading.  Considering their menu pics and the $26 price I expected a thicker pizza with more toppings than I received.
Cathy C.,"Noblesville, IN",49,5,1,4.0,1/30/2017,Went to Avon to try BJ's for the first time. We went around 1:30pm. We were seated right away. The bartender greeted us and told us she would get our server. She offered a drink and told us her favorites because we asked about the beers. Our server came back and told us that our beers would be right out! We ordered calamari as our app. Tender and fried properly with Lemon garlic aioli and marinara for dipping. Brandon gave us some ideas for entrees. I ordered the Jeremiah red beer and my boyfriend ordered the nutty brunette.  Both are made by BJ's. Beyond great!! I ordered the Spicy peanut chicken with soba noodles! Very very well made! Spicy like it says.  The lunch item my boyfriend ordered was a great deal! He got the half triple decker sand. with fries and pale ale chili! Lots of food!  We opted for more beer instead of dessert although they have many to choose from. The beer was so delicious that we had to have more. Great service! Great food!! DO NOT GET WATER!! TASTE THEIR BEER!!!!
Sarah W.,"Hudson, IA",1,3,,5.0,7/26/2016,"I love, love, love this place! I went to a BJ's in the Bay Area earlier this year on a work trip and loved it, but there are no locations even remotely close to where I live, so when we went on a family trip to Indianapolis and drove past BJ's I knew we HAD to stop so they could all experience the greatness that is an avocado egg roll. :) We went on a Sunday evening and were greeted right away and seated promptly. Our server was awesome - very friendly and accommodating. The avocado egg rolls were great - highly recommend getting them! I had a flatbread pizza appetizer and it was fantastic. Everyone else said their food was great as well. We take this family trip to Indy every summer, so I can only imagine we will be back next year!"
Stephen W.,"Coatesville, IN",0,9,,2.0,1/21/2017,"Service was great, really liked the server. The food was absolutely horrible. I had the brisket bacon burger. The bacon was just about raw and there might have been a piece or two of brisket. The appetizers must have been under a heating lamp for a couple days it seemed. Again, great service poor food quality"
Kristen B.,"Indianapolis, IN",52,47,51,3.0,9/14/2015,"Great food & drink variety...nice to have options that are different than the usual fare at other west side Indy restaurants.  Started out with the avocado egg rolls (yum) then had the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos, one of their offerings from the Enlightened Entrees portion of the menu & give it two thumbs up!"
Alicia P.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,1,1,5.0,7/15/2016,"Great service and great food! I had ordered the California club flatbread with the tomato and mozzarella salad, and it was the bomb! The messed up on my order by giving me the California club ""sandwich"" instead of the flatbread, but the manager fixed it .. The manager was very efficient and very nice!"
Dianna M.,"Greencastle, IN",0,1,,1.0,11/18/2016,Hostess wasn't welcoming. Waited 30 minutes. Had two kids with us. Put us at booth where they said we couldn't have a highchair. Had to leave or wait longer. Waited 30 minutes for nothing. Ended up leaving.
Alex M.,"Indianapolis, IN",6,79,62,5.0,2/14/2016,"10 min wait or immediate in bar. We sat in bar. I had the blu burger wife had the acocado chicken both were very good. Ordered the grilled Brussel sprouts. I thought the were too well/burnt. Took them off no problem. Great beer, great service, will definitely go again. Mary, the bartender was excellent."
Michael B.,"Plainfield, IN",0,10,,2.0,2/29/2016,"Even with advance seating wait was not worth the experience. Ran out of ribs that one party member ordered prior to 8 pm then delivered  a reorderd entrée prior to everyone else's food. Waitress should have fixed that or got manager but she hadn't a clue on customer service. Waitress while friendly and chatty was slow and appears frazzled. This was my first and probably last time to visit. Not worth the wait, the price, or the hassles of poor service."
maria m.,"Indianapolis, IN",26,16,13,5.0,1/7/2016,"Went with a big group of friends and it was fast and friendly service. We didn't feel rushed to eat and leave, good brews too! I recommend the avocado egg rolls for an appetizer- SOOO GOOD!!!!!"
Jennifer T.,"Avon, IN",8,7,10,5.0,2/19/2016,Been here twice for lunch within the last few weeks. Today was the second time. Never have to wait for seating. The food is really good and my husband loves the black and blue burger. They have a great beer selection and we have had great wait staff each time. I would definitely recommend it!
Scott N.,"Indianapolis, IN",19,4,,1.0,11/11/2015,"Arrived at 5pm for dinner on a Wednesday. It was not crowded at all. Sat down in about 5 minutes and waited for a server. After 30 minutes, no one came by to greet us or take a drink order. We left and won't be back."
Steve W.,"Indianapolis, IN",1,60,13,5.0,4/12/2016,"Great food. Great staff. Will definitely return. We showed up kind of late, but still received great service. We never felt rushed or like we 'ruined' someone's night. Everything was cooked perfectly and my water was promptly refilled l."
Michael V.,"Brownsburg, IN",38,72,59,3.0,1/29/2016,"Beer selection isn't half bad, food selection isn't half bad either. Their pizzas are what makes this place good. Staff is friendly but the prices are a bit high. As far as corporate chains go... It is what it is, nothing more. But I would go back for the pizzas."
