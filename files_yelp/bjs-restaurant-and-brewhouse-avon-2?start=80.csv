Jared B.,"Battle Ground, IN",0,4,,1.0,9/19/2015,Service was very slow.  Waited for 10 minutes for waiter to take our drink order and another 10 minutes to get silverware.  Food was equal to Applebee's or OCharleys. Nothing special.
Doug D.,"Plainfield, IN",0,5,2,4.0,9/10/2016,"Food was very good, beer was excellent, wait staff was superb. Enjoyed visit very much, definitely will return."
Erik P.,"Indy Metro, Indianapolis, IN",28,5,,1.0,10/30/2015,"My wife and I arrived for lunch. After watching multiple other tables get sat and have orders taken, we didn't even get a greeting or drink order taken. 20 minutes later,  we left. Stopped by hostess on way out and advised she could get us ""a perfect server"". Too little, too late. Not sure we will ever go back. Great food, but stuff just wrecked all that today."
Yale W.,"Indianapolis, IN",131,19,4,4.0,10/11/2015,Overpriced but good food.  The fresh brewed root beer and cream soda are worth going for!
Dave P.,"Indianapolis, IN",7,1,1,2.0,1/17/2016,"The food and beer is good. I have enjoyed BJ's since they have opened, but tonight was disappointing. Buyer beware... You cannot substitute sides on meals less than $14. I ordered the Mediterranean Tacos and asked for the Chili instead of the grain side. My chili and meal came san the side and when I got the bill, I had a $4.25 up charge for my Chili. I asked my server and was told the above. I am very disappointed in BJ's handling of this and probably won't be back for a while."
Andrew O.,"Indianapolis, IN",32,8,,4.0,11/21/2015,"My girlfriend and I felt so overwhelmed by the menu that we ordered a tapas from their appetizers section. They were extremely delicious and the beers we had a really great, too. Staff was friendly and helpful!"
Bobbie U.,"Avon, IN",0,24,5,4.0,8/20/2015,"The place was packed. We used the mobile app and was able to get advanced seating and 20%off with mobile pay.  We had the California flat bread pizza for app- delish.  I had the Santa Fe chicken salad. It was tasty but a little too much dressing, would suggest asking for dressing on the side.  My husband had the ribeye which was cooked the way he wanted but commented that it the cook overdid it with salt. My son had a burger and loved it. He recommends the homemade root beer. Both h had the piezookie double choc desserts and loved them. Staff was friendly and attentive. Will return."
Angie R.,"Plainfield, IN",0,3,,1.0,1/23/2016,"We went here for the first time last night. I'll start with they were very busy so I won't complain about the wait. Once we were seated our order was taken promptly but our food came out wrong, we had to flag down our waitress to get any service. Then we sat with no drink refills for 20 minutes waiting to flag her down again. Ordered another beer & asked for boxes. After another 20 minutes we flagged her down again & asked for our drinks to be cancelled & again our to go boxes. We saw the manager cancel our drinks & give the server a new bill, I would have thought he would have came over to speak with us but instead ran around playing with staff.  I do understand being busy but our last drink was ordered at 8pm after the rush, it's hard to enjoy your food without even a water."
Tyler W.,"Marion, IN",7,72,1,5.0,10/24/2015,"I went here tonight with my college roommate and his wife and I had a great time! We arrived around 6 and had to wait 25 minutes to get seated, but it was worth the wait. Our waitress was attentive and got all our orders right. I ordered the root beer glazed wings as an appetizer and had the hickory bbq brisket burger with fries as my entree. Both were absolutely delicious! I had the orange cream soda the restaurant makes to drink, which also was good. Both people I came with were similarly pleased with theirs meals."
Amy N.,"Aberdeen, SD",0,2,,5.0,7/21/2016,Amazing appetizers and pizza!! I suggest the stuffed mushrooms and deep dish chicken bacon ranch pizza!
Duwayne S.,"Danville, IN",54,7,1,1.0,1/14/2017,This place has sucked all 4 times I have been here. The first time was a birthday party for my son and he picked it. It was -10 out and it was freezing in there. Assume one of their heating units were out and can't blame them for that but the way they responded to our requests was not proper. Second time was a party of 10 for friends and a friend of mine had to send back his steak 3 times to get it right. The 2nd time me my wife and other son come here to eat dinner. Ordered a burger med rare cause places tend to overcook. Manager made it right. 3rd time was there with a party of 10 and my friend had to send back his steak 3 times for them to get it right. NOT a steak joint. 4th time we are here now STILL waiting after 70 mins for a party of 7!  Was told 40 mins. I would NEVER recommend this crappy ass place. They keep in business from their selection of 20 different crappy ass craft beers!!!!!!  Never again!!!!
J R.,"Avon, IN",0,11,,4.0,1/7/2016,"Service and hospitality exceeded expectations.Monster menu specializing in beer, burgers and pizza but not overshadowing the balance of other offerings such as the many chicken dishes and excellent jambalaya.  The music is extremely loud in the general area but ask and found a quieter table in the porch section.  Although this chain started as a pizza restaurant we were extremely disappointed in the very expensive deep dish pizza. One in our party said it was the worst and most expensive pizza they had ever had."
DeAnna M.,"Panama City Beach, FL",94,6,3,3.0,9/20/2015,"Went to this restaurant on a Sunday evening and sat at the bar. I was impressed by their beer selection. They only had 2 bartenders working a reasonably sized bar and the bartenders were also preparing drinks for the servers. So if you were at the bar, you received very little attention. They were very nice when they made it around to wait on you. My advice is don't go if you are in a hurry or really thirsty. We had appetizers and the sliders were quite yummy!"
Jenna D.,"Plainfield, IN",0,7,,3.0,11/23/2015,"Overall service and atmosphere is excellent. Disappointed with the last dining experience. Ordered a portobello mushroom sandwich, and the mushroom was completely burnt. Waiter was  very polite and brought out another meal. Cider and other beers were delicious! Will definitely give this place another try in a few months. Plan ahead---very crowded on the weekends!"
David G.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,27,,5.0,11/20/2015,"I have eaten here twice already, and each time I have had a great meal.   I tried the jumbo spaghetti and meatballs, and cheeseburger meal-- both entrees very good!   All sides were great, the side salad was fabulous as were the fries.   I am serious when I say this-- the spaghetti and meatballs dinner is much better than what Olive Garden offers. I could eat here for dinner all week long-- not because their dishes are great (but they are), but because they have a pretty extensive menu to choose from.  As the name mentions, it is a brewhouse, so they do carry microbrews, and have quite a large list of beers overall. Another thing worth mentioning is that they have TVs for viewing from any angle-- fantastic for a Sunday afternoon lunch for people like me that enjoy NFL Football, but maybe not so much for a quiet romantic meal. Service was perfect each time I went there.  BJs is now my go-to restaurant in Avon for a good quality meal.  Nothing has dissappointed yet here."
Mark B.,"Avon, IN",0,21,,4.0,9/9/2015,"Great menu, plenty of beer options, blows away scottys Service was very good. I had the mahi tacos for lunch just enough. I will definitely be back to try the pizza."
Monica C.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,17,,3.0,8/24/2015,"Started off on a bad foot with the hostess staff.  There is a stupid revolving door that lets into a rather small waiting area.  On a Monday night, it was standing room only at the front door, so had to make two revolutions in the revolving door before there was room to step inside.  Waited in a line 4-deep to check in.  Asked for a table for 2, but she did not ask for our name, just said ""Ok, we'll seat you in a few minutes""  Another hostess who takes you to your seats only announces ""Table for 2?""  or ""Table for 4?"" etc.  It's left up to your fellow patrons to determine who was there first.  We waited to the side of the hostess stand for 5 minutes or so.  While we're waiting, another party of 2 walks in the door, checks in at the hostess stand, and she said ""Right this way"" to them.  At that point we had to throw a small tantrum that we were obviously there before they were and were still waiting to be seated.  The hostess looked at us perplexed and asked what our name was?  We told her we were never asked for our name.  Still looking perplexed, she told another hostess to seat us, but never did apologize for the screw-up.  They really need to improve on their process at the front door. While we were waiting, we noticed another party of 3 that had to question the hostess why they hadn't been seated yet.  No one wants to start their dinner pissed off. The food is good.  The service is hit or miss.  Thankfully, when other waiters notice your drinks are empty, they'll get you another, just in case your waiter is a dud. A plus is free refills on their in-house root beer/cream sodas, which are delicious. I felt rushed by our waiter - he brought the check before we finished eating, and he took the signed receipt w/tip from me before we left. Reluctantly, I signed up for their rewards program, only because I now know you can get 20% off with mobile pay and ""preferred seating"".  But because I only like them for their food and nothing else, I'll probably do carry-out from now on. *Update*.  Been here a few more times since original post and all is good now.  I still love the food, and wait staff have been great.  They offer some good discounts through their rewards program."
Jeff R.,"Avon, IN",0,1,,1.0,2/18/2016,"Good beer, bad food.  I got the fish and chips. The fish tasted like burnt grease and overdone on the outside with raw batter inside. The waiter didn't seem too concerned when I told him. Id go back for a drink but never again for dinner."
Brooke N.,"Manhattan, KS",0,13,,3.0,2/12/2016,"A bit cramped compared to other BJ's locations,  but the food is good.  If you get the fish and chips,  split it or take half home because it is huge!"
Travis M.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,6,,5.0,9/18/2015,"Great food, great atmosphere, great service. Do yourself a favor a dine here for a meal. Good beer selection and even better food. I love this place and I'll be back many times."
