Jeanne T.,"Porterville, CA",4,140,466,4.0,12/23/2017,"I have not been in for a long time. Just always trying ""locals spots lately"". Decided,  to give it a go. I'm glad I did. The food was great, atmosphere was happening, and service was good. Beer selection was good. They have decent craft beer, but I prefer the craft brewery scene. The only down is the price, not cheap eats here. But all in all worth our money. I got lunch for next day!  Good visit, I will definitely come back."
Ezra A.,"Ridgecrest, CA",4,17,6,5.0,11/22/2017,"came here with friends tonight & got the best service ever by ANDREW. he made wonderful recommendations about the prime rib & sides dishes. i almost thought he was too good to be true because of how friendly & quick-paced he is, but he deserves a standout in this review because of his genuine passion for his work! give this man a raise!  & as always, the pizookie is to die for! i'm one happy girl right now."
Jeff N.,"Nakaniikawa District, Japan",96,5,1,2.0,8/30/2017,The only reason they're getting two stars is because they have beer. That's it. Service was horribly slow and unfriendly. Items that my wife and I loved are off the menu (chicken nachos) replaced by cheap imitations.  Everything has gone down since we first came here. I AINT NEVA GOIN BACK. Fuck outta my face.
Chandi M.,"Kern County, CA",31,57,240,4.0,8/7/2017,What can I say the food is just so so and if your going to order any kind of seafood it's going to be overcooked. The Ahi Poke is good but the portion of fish vs avocado is not equal. Overall it's an ok place but it is a brewery so just enjoy the drinks.  Update: I have returned a few more times sense this review and the service and food has improved a lot. The Pita Chicken tacos are amazing and the clam chowder I tried today was delicious.
Judith M.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,5,,4.0,1/9/2018,"Great handcrafted soda (so good!!)  The food is good (not fantastic) and the service is great, The only reason for 4 stars is because its so pricey... I could have made good food at home for a lot cheaper."
Katie M.,"Sacramento, CA",34,9,,5.0,1/7/2018,"We visited BJ's yesterday for lunch, a group of 3. We were there shortly before the lunch rush, so we were seated quickly. The service was good and the food came fast, that was great since we were on a schedule. The food was great also, although I wouldn't order the blistered shishitos  again since they lacked seasoning. The couscous mac n cheese and cheese grits were very good, and the soups are amazing. Overall, very good."
Ambra H.,"Bakersfield, CA",80,5,2,3.0,12/18/2017,"I had a company Christmas dinner party sunday night...came a little early, so a group of us Sat @ the bar and ordered drinks...customer service was amazing, i ordered a patron Cadillac with a grand Marnier shot on the side...it was amazing, nice shot size..cashed out our tabs out...went to the area where we where having the party@...ordered drinks with a different waiter..ordered the same drink i had @ the bar...the drink was good but the shot on the side was a teaspoon size..told the waiter and he said he would fix it..he came back with what i would not consider a shot@ all..very disappointed..and still paid for the high price drink..other than that the company party was a success..."
Lulu H.,"Bakersfield, CA",357,146,931,3.0,9/6/2017,I love their chicken wings and their late night happy hour. They have a great variety and great kids plates .... but they are horrible for take out!  I was trying to save time tonight because I have so much work and a kiddo to feed but I've been waiting here for almost 25 minutes! Ugh!!!!!!
charlisa h.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,15,1,4.0,1/3/2018,I would have given them all five stars but they discontinued a great drink lol called cucumber jalapeño margarita I always ordered it ugh but besides that it's a great place to eat I went there a day before my birthday (which is Christmas) and they still offered my a bday Cookie which was awesome! I LOVE their shrimp and asparagus pasta also their Jambalaya
Diana S.,"Bakersfield, CA",10,109,159,4.0,4/22/2017,"I've been here a few times because of convenience due to location and late time hours. Also, love that they have dessert. Came in on Saturday late  afternoon and was seated promptly. We split a flight and I ordered Belching Beaver Peanut Butter milk stout.  Hubby got the a hickory brisket bacon burger with wedge fries. He liked it very much. I tried the late night burger served  open face with wedge fries. It had patty, chile verde sauce, fried egg,  bacon, and cheddar. Delicious! Nice kick to it. Didn't eat the bun so I'd be able to finish it with my knife and fork. Great service from the staff today!"
Kaitlin B.,"Bakersfield, CA",67,5,7,4.0,11/13/2017,This is the California chicken club and it is amazing!! I have never came here and not loved the food.If you have kids I recommend asking your server for a kids starter (it's free!) my husband and I love this place!
Stephanie P.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,16,,5.0,12/28/2017,My friends and I love it here. We can get a spot at the bar fairly easily. They have so many options to choose from and pretty much everything is delicious. My favorite is the great white pizza!
Josiah T.,"San Diego, CA",106,4,1,5.0,11/22/2017,Stopped in with some friends for an after-movie-dinner and had an amazing server by the name of Andrew. Andrew made our dinner an experience. He was super helpful with his suggestion of the prime rib dinner as well as the pesto sauce for our pizza. He took the time to chat with us and genuinely engaged us. He was super friendly and very attentive. I'd definitely come back to this location just for Andrew.
Yari S.,"Bakersfield, CA",4,33,30,4.0,8/20/2017,"Good food and very family friendly restaurant , Always enjoy their drinks and pazookie  The Avocado Rolls are a MUST  Never had a bad experience here"
Frank B.,"Hawthorne, CA",1,15,2,1.0,12/24/2017,"1st and last time I will ever eat at this BJs location. Where to begin? 1st, we were delayed being seated because they hadn't placed menus on the table. This was complete b.s. The reason we weren't seated is because they didn't have enough chairs for our table. Which we reserved. 2nd, they botched the salads that were ordered. One never came at all. 3rd, there was no rhythm to the food being delivered, so a few received their food, while others did not. Of the 7 entrees ordered, 4 were wrong. They comped 2 of the four then promised coupons for free desserts. They gave us 2.  Service was crap, food was cold, manager completely inept.  We turned away 7 items that were not ordered by our table. It was the worst dinner experience I've had in years."
Eva S.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,12,6,5.0,11/14/2017,Really good specials Monday-Thursday.... Monday wasn't packed at all we walked in right away.
Chelsea R.,"Long Beach, CA",0,18,,5.0,10/27/2017,"I love coming here for happy hour. Unless there's a big game on it's not too busy. I've never had any issue with the service, and I like the happy hour food options.  The beet salad which you can get as a side with the happy hour burger (extra cost) is delicious."
Christina R.,"Bakersfield, CA",83,68,47,5.0,10/8/2017,"We came here today for a ladies party of four lunch meeting. They have a vast menu to choose from, it can be overwhelming! I went with the derby Cobb salad, it was huge. It was probably the best Cobb salad I've ever had. But I couldn't finish it, because it was so big. I brought the rest of it home for my husband and he loved it as well. Service was good and so was the atmosphere! It was packed but we got a table within a couple of minutes."
RJ P.,"Seven Oaks, Bakersfield, CA",27,1,,1.0,12/24/2017,"Place sucks, shitty service to African Americans. Didn't even bother to help us, just sat andlaughed. Very Disprectful To Paying Customers. How very rude never returning"
A C.,"Bakersfield, CA",2,57,31,1.0,12/1/2017,"Went here last night with a friend.  All I wanted was soup.  Friend got the zitti pasta thing.   Service:  horrible.  It seems like around 7:15pm the place was so packed the wait staff were overwhelmed and couldn't handle the tables.  Wasn't sure who our waiter was as we got 5 different people come and drop stuff off and walk away without even stopping to ask if we needed anything.  YES I NEEDED A PLACE SETTING!! YES I NEEDED A NAPKIN!!!! YES I WANTED MY WATER GLASS REFILLED.  NONE OF THAT HAPPENED!!  waiter was very stand-offish and short as if he was in a rush to go somewhere when he came to take our order.   I got the soup.  When ordering I asked that it be hot.  Nope.  Came to the table barely Luke warm and thick as porridge.  Whatever.  I asked for tobacco from the dude doing the drop and dash and never got it.   Soup was mush like.  Edible but hey it was late and I just wanted out at that point.  I mean it's cold outside.  Why bring over barely like warm soup that's as thick as porridge when I asked for hot soup when ordering.  Horrible service.  Shit I'm lucky it came with a damn spoon at least.   I'd never recommend this joint to anyone.  It's packed, loud and service is horrible!!! Stay away from BJs.   It's not worth it.   No I did not leave a tip."
Lisa I.,"Long Beach, CA",21,49,9,4.0,1/3/2018,I'd recommend the chicken tyme. The chicken was very moist and well cooked. Waiter was very attentive. Not very packed and noisy.
Juan M.,"Bakersfield, CA",9,8,15,4.0,4/11/2017,"Came in late around 10:45 pm and sat in the bar area, our server Brittney greeted us right away. I was ready to order when she came back with our drinks.  She did a great job of keeping drinks full and making sure everything was perfect through out the dining experience.   I only gave 4 stars because food took a little over 20 minutes to arrive. I tried a new item tonight from their ""enlightened"" section; the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos with a side of their quinoa vegetable medley and it is now my favorite item!  The chicken tacos came with red onions, feta cheese and cilantro tossed in red wine vinaigrette, I'm not a fan of Greek yogurt creme so I got that on the side.  This would be a perfect lunch, they also have a couple vegetarian option which also looked really good.  It was overall a great visit and I only spent $21 for two entrees."
Dan M.,"Bakersfield, CA",10,95,16,4.0,5/10/2017,"Been here many many times. My family usually come here for special occasions. I have quite a few pint glasses from Fathers Day visits. Came here for a pre birthday dinner with the family since i could not celebrate it on the actual day. My daughter gets her usual, a brew house burger, wife gets a chicken club and my son gets a extreme pepperoni pizza. But i like to explore the vast menu. I have had the jambalaya, bison burgers, fish and chips. But i decided to try the enlightened barbacoa chicken. Its chicken over brown rice and black beans. It was pretty good, would do again. We also had the Pizookies, they are $3.00 on Tuesdays. Always good, we tried the white chocolate macadamia. The only thing I don't really like is that they charge $3.00+ per drink. I mean soda and tea, not alcohol of any kind. No tea or soft drink should be over $3.00."
Leila C.,"Stockdale West, Bakersfield, CA",0,3,,4.0,1/4/2018,I like this place I live near here and it's nice to have a nice/fancy place to eat for birthdays or parties.i recommend their clam chowder soup and their spaghetti
Mario H.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/8/2017,"Long wait time, horrible service, mediocre food. Overall: don't waste your time here."
Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32,1.0,2/20/2017,"I have frequented many BJ's up and down the coast and I can honestly say that our experience at this establishment was by far the worst. First off we order our appetizers, the stuffed mushrooms, and the queso/chips.  When they arrived, everything was cold.  The Queso was gritty like it had sand in it and tasted like Velveeta cheese, cold Velveeta cheese.  Gross!!!!!! I brought this to the attention of our waitress and it was ' an oh well attitude' and walked away.  Nothing was done about this.  Very poor customer service! I asked for a side salad with no croutons and extra tomatoes and cucumbers.  I was brought out a regular salad with everything just the opposite of what I asked for.  Again, no attention to detail.   The tortilla soup was the poorest excuse for tortilla soup I have ever seen.  There was not one tortilla and it was mainly a broth.  Again, terrible QC! The ribs tasted like day old re-fried ribs and far from fresh!  Poor presentation and even worse, it was like eating a dry old dog bone! When you go out to eat, I understand mistakes happen, however on our visit, all the marks were missed completely by the staff.  Poor customer service and poor QC/quality/freshness of the food.  Ugg!!"
Rocio G.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",157,239,498,3.0,1/23/2017,"I used to frequent this location with friends years ago and never really had negative experiences.  This visit I came here with coworkers for business lunch.  It was 11:20am, given it had recently opened for the day. I went to the restroom prior to sitting down at the table.  The toilet paper dispensers were all empty. Why aren't these being refilled at the end of the night? I literally walked to each stall and no toilet paper in sight. Not good.  I washed my hands, didn't use the toilet and proceeded on to my table.  I ordered the unlimited soup and salad. I got the wedge salad and tomato bisque soup. Both were really good, and this is the experience I remember.  Our server was attentive we were in and out in a decent amount of time and satisfied from the meal.   I hope the bathroom issue was only a one off, such a bummer."
Eric E.,"Bakersfield, CA",10,69,125,2.0,7/14/2017,"This place embodies all that's wrong with big chain restaurants. Warmed over food from a frozen bag. No theme to the menu. Just everything. Lots of salt on everything. The pizza is pretty decent though. I get drug here for an occasional work lunch, but that's way more than enough for me."
Jesus O.,"Bakersfield, CA",25,5,5,3.0,11/18/2017,This was my first time here since it opened. Let me start by saying  great food nice atmosphere. The only thing that killed my veterans day celebration was my waiter Martin seemed kind of a snob. No mattered how much I tried to be nice or joke with him all he would give me is a courtesy smile. I was glad when he went on break and someone else took over. I will be back but hopefully with a different  server
Johnny Q.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,2,1,1.0,12/25/2017,"We went for my Dad's 76th Birthday. About 2:00 or so. My sister Beverly called ahead, however when we showed up they had no record of her calling. Surprise, not!! The waitress was changed almost immediately and they sent another person to serve us. Me and my Dad ordered the bison burger with fries. Medium well. My sister ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Tacos. The burgers arrived and they were absolutely RARE! I had about half the fries as my Dad. My sisters chicken tacos were fish tasting. Yuk! We showed the waitress our raw burgers and my sister explained her discontent with the fishy tasting chicken tacos. The waitress said she would show her manager and they would remake the burgers for me and my Dad. My sister ordered s chicken sandwich meal instead. The food finally came and now the burgers were well done and burnt . My burger was partially well done and raw in some parts. My Dad's burger was extremely overcooked to the point it was so much smaller than before! The salsa was basically obsolete and missing for his, just one plop of salsa and almost a half onion on his burger? Wow I mean Wow! My sisters chicken sandwich was fine. We informed the waitress and they comped our burgers and the chips and guacamole. The Manager did apologize the first time but no apology for the second time. We ended up paying for my sisters chicken sandwich and the drinks only. I will needless to say that I definitely will not never return here for anything involving food! Absolutely the worst experience ever. The cook is not a cook at all. I myself haven't been a chef for sometime, but I could still do much better than what we received that day. Please tell all your friends to never set foot in this restaurant. You will do yourself a big favor. If I could give negative stars I would. One star for service only. I can't express enough that this was absolutely just horrible. I say no thank you very very much if I ever am invited to go again."
Clarinda D.,"Bakersfield, CA",117,2,,5.0,10/14/2017,Awesome beer and appetizers. My boyfriend and i wanted to grab a snack and beer so we went to The Firehouse. We walked in and it felt so weird and unfriendly. Being a server myself i knew that easnt a good feeling but hey you never know so we tried asking if we seat ourselves could barley get anyone to acknowledge us so we sat down waited ablut 5 mins and yep we walked out and not one person said one word to us. Thank you to our server/bartender at BJ's for making us feel like we were welcomed. Jake was awesome and helped us with everything. Again. Amazing food and amazing service. Thank you Jake! And thank you BJ's
Mrs. P.,"Bakersfield, CA",16,64,5,1.0,6/22/2017,"I've had pleasant dining experiences while dining in the restaurant. My review is solely for take-out. Never have I arrived to pick up my order and had it handed to me without waiting at least another 10 mins. Not once. Never. Ever. Doesn't matter what day it was or what time it was. It was never ready.  My kids love the kids meals, so we order take-out often. Specifically, once a week for the past 6 weeks, and several times before that. After the first few times that I arrive and had to wait, I started stretching the pick up time out longer. It was a game I was playing with myself. Order, wait 15 mins. Go. Order. Wait 20 mins. Go. Order wait 25 mins. Go. It didn't matter how long I waited, my order was never ready.  The last straw was this past Saturday. I ordered my food, showed up 30 mins later and still had to wait another 7-8 mins. I get home (3 mins later) and the food was awful! Cold, salty and my daughter's cheese pizza had no cheese on it. It was just sauce and bread. She took two bites and left it.  I will never order take out of BJ's again."
Garrett G.,"Bakersfield, CA",51,20,18,4.0,8/3/2017,Wife and I are always a fan of their chicken tortilla soup. The flavor is incredible. Sometimes I do wish it comes out hotter but that is okay. Hamburgers are good as well as their pizza. Next time you are there and they still have the churro pizookie....do yourself a favor order one!!
Hansel B.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,3,,4.0,6/23/2017,"BJ's is by far one of my top, if not the top restaurant in Bakersfield. I have been here several times and i can't say that i have ever had a bad experience. The staff for the most part is very attentive and the waiters really do their absolute best to cater to their customers. The only reason that this review is not a 5 star is for (2) reasons.  1) No shock top beer. For being a brewery id assume they'd have a variety of all types of beer.  2) It wouldn't hurt for their hostesses to be more welcoming as customers are walking in. Typically if their backs are against the front door, you have to get their attention to be seated. Other than that this place is great and i overall recommend it to anyone who is looking for good food and a good environment."
Jacob P.,"Bakersfield, CA",120,132,28,3.0,6/8/2017,Eh...I'm not a big fan of this place. But i'll go if I'm with friends or my girlfriend wants to go. To me this place always reads as a place people go on first dates to or where girls go to have dinner with their friends ....I feel like the food is 'good' not great and when I get my bill I feel like I'm paying more for the decorations and TV's by the bar than the food. it's not my thing.
Cheyenne C.,"Bakersfield, CA",14,38,31,3.0,11/11/2016,Come here last night. We wanted to sit at the bar area but there were no tables the ones that were available were not cleaned.  The host said he would recommend us standing by the table so that a busser knows we want the table cleaned off. Which instantly annoyed me. I don't want to stand by a dirty table it would be nice if you could go tell the busser to clean the table .  As we were standing in the waiting area a server as if we had been helped I said yes we are waiting for a table to be clean in the bar. She said the same thing she would recommend a standing by the table until a busser comes.  After about 15 minutes of standing there I asked what looks like a manager if he could get a busser to clean a table off for us.  He apologized and cleaned the table off for us. Which I appreciated.  I got a personal $4(happy hour) panned pizza. Soo yummy & filling for only $4!!! Also drank Margarita's which never fail me.
Allea N.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,31,,4.0,11/8/2017,"I really like this place. The atmosphere in my opinion is the greatest in town. Fantastic location as well. The food is great and gets to you in a reasonable amount of time. Although, I'm not crazy about their salmon dish. I personally do not recommend it. This place is so great that if you ever receive a meal that did not satisfy you, you should definitely tell them because they're capable of doing better. Other than that, take your family, friends, boyfriend, girlfriend, or whatever and go to BJ's."
Kathryn C.,"Delano, CA",39,47,38,5.0,5/29/2017,"Came here on a Sunday to celebrate me and my boyfriends anniversary and surprisingly, we both got seated right when we walked in! Our waiter was really friendly and attentive. Ordered calamari appetizer and it came out quick! It was really delicious. Also ordered the small bbq chicken pizza & my boyfriend ordered a cheeseburger with an extra patty! Both were so good. We had to get the pizookie trio and we both decided that the cookies and cream was the best! It wasn't too sweet like the other flavors. We definitely would come again!"
Courtney M.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,149,3,2.0,6/7/2017,"Updated**** Aaaand the pizookie was completely burned to a crisp. Inedible.  They were 20 minutes late with our take out order today without so much as a ""I'm sorry for the wait"". When your website says it will be ready at 5:30, and it's not ready until 5:50 and your customer has been standing there for 20 minutes the least you do is apologize. And the pizza is ridiculously salty and I love salt but this was too much. They have almost no sauce on the pizza. And they used to have big chunks of tomatoes in their sauce and now they don't and they don't have the option to add tomatoes on their website. This will be the last time I get a bjs pizza. Two stars because pizookies are the bomb but I mean it's a cookie and vanilla ice cream so..."
Tiffiny K.,"Bakersfield, CA",44,65,173,1.0,5/29/2017,"ANSOLUTELY AWFUL IN EVERY WAY!  We scheduled a party of 15 for my sons high school graduation, only 12 people showed. So, we were a party of 12. The service was deplorable! Slow. We had to flag her down constantly. Asked for more chips 5 times by the time we finally got them our spinach artichoke dip was completely cold and coagulated. The waitress was awful from the very beginning and she even came to take orders and we were on different tickets and she took one order and left we had to scream after her to come back to us and take more orders because other people wanted order besides just two of us.  Everything was painfully slow we had to fight for every single thing we got and the food was greasy and nasty. To top off what was an awful experience she told us we could not use the coupons that we had presented before the meal even though she had told us that we could. So she lied to us at the very beginning of the meal and waited till we were completely done and told us she was going to charge us anyway.  If it had not been for the fact that I did not want to ruin my son's graduation lunch and any more than it already had been I would have thrown a fit! Then to top it all off she was so frustrated with her little handheld electronic device that she was using to swipe our cards that she literally punched it over and over again before storming off. I CAN'T EVEN!  NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN!  we spent about $350 and got the worst crap experience ive ever had.  IM APPALLED! MANAGEMENT NEEDS TO CONTACT ME! I WANT A REFUND!"
