Joey G.,"Bakersfield, CA",133,91,33,1.0,6/8/2014,"Food is typical of a chain restaurant and some of the meals are great (specifically the cheeseburger pizza) however the service at this location is terrible. The staff is rude, management does nearly nothing to fix it and when I have reached out to discuss these issues with upper management not a single response was given. I refuse to go to this particular restaurant here in town just because of the service. I'm better off going elsewhere where I'm actually treated decently."
PatrickJ T.,"Bakersfield, CA",193,2910,14296,4.0,6/24/2013,"When we go here, I always save room for their yummy pizookies!!  Their White Chocolate Macadamia Nut  Cookie topped with two scoops of delicious Vanilla Bean Ice Cream is one of the best tasting desserts that I've ever had in a chain restaurant. I wish that I could be as happy about the rest of their menu, but I cannot.  I would rate their appetizers, salads, and entrees 3 stars.  Not bad, but I'm not quite a fan though.  Appetizers that I have tried are the chicken lettuce wraps, the nachos, and the calamari.  All pretty good, and the portions were generous. Entrees that I have tried are baby back ribs, atlantic salmon, and the pizza.  The ribs and salmon tasted fine, but not ""pizookie fine""!  My favorite pizza would have to be the Barbecue Chicken pizza.  A couple of times I've even ordered to go for Super Bowl parties. Yeah, I am a fan of BJ's Restaurant.  For the atmosphere and service, I'd give them 4 stars.  For the appetizers and entrees 3 stars.  4 stars for the pizza   A gigantic 5 stars for their desserts!!!  Honestly, I could just come here for their pizookies and I'd be completely happy!"
Abby H.,"Bakersfield, CA",27,2,,3.0,2/15/2016,Don't take reservations unless your party is over 7 people? Stupid. Food is alright and service was just average.
M K.,"Buena Park, CA",21,30,9,2.0,11/10/2015,When I go to a restaurant in want to have a good service.....refill my glass before it runs out bring me ketchup if I have 3 orders of fries. My fries got cold didn't get enough service to ask for ketchup my daughter ordered macaroni and cheese the worst....we actually had to send our calamari back because it was refried and stale.
Camposgirl P.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,7,12,5.0,11/5/2014,"The food was great and the service was excellent, if you are in a hurry I don't recommend you go you will be there a few hours but it is oh so worth it!"
Catherine G.,"Bakersfield, CA",12,12,21,3.0,3/26/2016,"I go to Bj's all the time and usually everything is fine. Tonight was different. I felt ignored by my waiter. I was told his name was Juan, but the receipt said Andrew. Anyways, he didn't really come around to check on us. It wasn't even that busy when I was there. After we were done eating, I had some left overs and our waiter just dropped off the check and took off. I didn't even get a chance to ask him for a to go box. We asked one of the bussers for one and he looked up and around like he was looking for our waiter; he seemed slightly annoyed. Then as we were leaving the hostess looked at us then looked down. She didn't say anything. Usually we get a ""have a good night!"" I know it seems like little things but it's a restaurant. You expect more from a place like this. I just felt like none of the employees I encountered really cared. Since this was the only time I had this kind of experience here, I'll still give em 3 stars."
Tricia S.,"Shafter, CA",6,33,,1.0,4/12/2016,This restaurant is horrible several nights ago my friend had tortilla soup tasted more like cornstarch than tortilla soup I had a big potato had the worst dressing in the world the vegetables were overcooked and soggy the wine was good and the calamari was good but I will never go back there again and I've been there.
Missy C.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,10,,1.0,8/4/2016,"Please don't worry or bother about reaching out and trying to make this right, because while I'd appreciate the effort, there is nothing you'd be able to do about this.  So my husband and I were in the Bakersfield BJ's not too long ago and were horrified.  Not only had the menu ballooned into this monstrous entity that made fresh food impossible, but the crust was completely different from what made BJ's pizza great to begin with.  My husband was a BJ's employee for 20 years, mostly prior to BJ's becoming a chain...all of this at the Balboa Peninsula store.  I worked there and at the Laguna Beach store for a total of four years. Even though half of his time was under the new ownership and franchising, THE CRUST PREP HAD NOT CHANGED! NOR HAD THE MENU BECOME GIANT! Those two things have ruined what we once loved so much about the restaurant that caused both of our families to become addicts. So, so sad. And yes, there will be people who know exactly who we are by this post."
Joshua G.,"Bakersfield, CA",78,43,106,3.0,8/27/2015,"Okay, so I love the food at BJ's. The service is also fantastic. The problem doesn't manifest itself in either of those things. Oddly, the problem is the size and seating capacity. Every single time I have been here, it was packed, and due to the high number of people, and low number of staff on duty at any given time, problems usually arise. Twice my table was given an order that was totally wrong, and one of those times our order was burned, only to be replaced with another wrongly ordered pizza. The staff IS very accommodating though, and like I mentioned the food is delicious, regardless of what you order. Both times this occurred we were totally reimbursed and both the incorrect and replaced order were covered by the restaurant, which is nice. For night such as Friday or Saturday, this place would probably be best in terms of quality, but low on the list in terms of ease. The establishment itself is pretty stressful."
Geo M.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/23/2016,"Just went to BJs for a night cap after a movie tonight(1/22/16) around 11:30. We were seated promptly but we sat there patiently for 35 minutes. No one came to take our order. Figuring we can sit there for hours we will simply be ignored, we walked out and on the way out we told the hostess we are leaving since no waitress came to the table after sitting there for over half an hour. She apologized and went to get the manager. Waited a few more minutes for the manager to come out. She offered to seat us again.... really? for sure?  It's too bad because we enjoyed BJ's food and the atmosphere and go there often but not anytime soon.."
Balon N.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,107,441,1.0,8/26/2015,"Disappointed. This is usually a great chain. Beer was good as usual (well, it comes from a very consistent brewry in Reno. So not really a brew pub). Avocado rolls were just OK. Not crispy, a bit oily - my guess the oil wasn't hot enough. Chicken Lemon Thyme - while sounded healthy was totally inedible. The dish tasted liked burnt rubber, was soaked in sauce and the chicken was so weired it felt like a squid or what I'd imagine a dense flip flop soaked in lemon would taste like. Bottom line - go for the beer for happy hour. Avoid the food. Definitely not a lunch place."
B F.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,23,1,2.0,7/9/2016,"Decent food. Been here several times, but the last time I came in, one of the waiters kicked the back of my wife's foot with no apology the waiter then tossed our plates on the table, to the point pieces of salad came off the plate onto the table and just walked away. For me, one bad experience ruins it. We spend lots of money, usually around $100 a visit so, yes they have decent food, however this was enough for us to spend our money elsewhere. Good customer service can make me come back to an OK restaurant."
Elle S.,"Houston, TX",99,203,,4.0,6/2/2014,"This is your typical chain American food restaurant. I've never had an issue with the food or the service at this location, which pulls it up to 4 stars (really, it's a 3.5). I end up here every time I come to Bakersfield. Normally, I grab the Chicken tacos. It's 3 small corn tacos with a side of black beans. Perfect for lunch. Not mind-blowing, but good. You have to try the Pizzookie. This is perfect for those evenings when you're thinking ""Dinner?... Nah, I just want chocolate and carbs with some ice cream."" They do make this to go. Pop in your favorite Disney movie and melt into the couch with this 2000 calorie treat."
Suzy O.,"Visalia, CA",0,79,16,1.0,3/11/2014,"Horrible experience!! We've given them two opportunities to redeem themselves and have been let down BOTH times. Mediocre food, AWFUL service!! Stay away. You're better off spending your money elsewhere."
James H.,"Bakersfield, CA",199,2,,1.0,7/3/2016,I went in this weekend and I knew it would be kind of busy but we waited until later to go so it wouldn't be crowded. The front stage seated us at the bar area there were 3 of us all eating. Our waitress must have been off or having a bad night. 50 minutes after we ordered we finally get our appetizers and our food comes out shortly after that. That would have been alright if the waitress hadn't just thrown everything on the table and took off every time. I mean come on I may need something this one time you have talked to us. I guess someone ran out of the bar without paying their bill so we got to wait another 30 minutes while the whole staff talked about it. Mind you my bill is $85 and I can't even get service. I have only been here once before and I can say I probably won't be back. Focus on your customers and they won't ever have time to think they can run out if they know you are paying attention to them.
Anici S.,"Bakersfield, CA",48,62,1,2.0,3/15/2015,"I give up! I've tried the restaurant 3 times on different days of the week during different hours and it's always mediocre. They are always slow, food ( calamari) either comes out burnt or soggy! Fries oily and pizzas tastes sauce less and 95% dough! I wanted to like this place, everyone seems to flock to it but why?"
Tanya W.,"Bakersfield, CA",10,11,12,2.0,7/28/2015,We waited for an hour and a half and the hostess heather was also rude so my friends birthday was almost ruined but pur waiter john was so sweet and made everything better
Jayna D.,"Bakersfield, CA",43,2,,1.0,12/11/2015,Hey fellow YELPERS  I'm currently at BJ's and I've been waiting for 1 hour and 36 minutes...amh they advised our party of and hour wait then proceeded to seat a party of 19..mind you we only have 15...being that I'm here for my best friends birthday I feel they could have made better arrangements...mind you there are people who travelled from out of town..sigh..the waiters are not displaying any signs if hospitality...therefore GOOD LUCK!
Jackie B.,"Bakersfield, CA",10,25,17,5.0,8/15/2015,"My mom and I went there for dinner, arrived about 530 or so. We were seated immediately. Our waitress, Christine, was absolutely amazing! I had only been here once very long ago. She recommended the avacodo egg rolls for an appetizer. They're delicious by the way! She kept our drinks refreshed and checked on us frequently! I highly recommend getting the Black cherry rootbeer!! The food was fabulous and filling! Will definitely be back and requesting Christine ad my waitress!"
Ruben M.,"Las Vegas, NV",359,387,5,1.0,3/30/2012,"No doubt they have great food, but it is very pricey. Waiters were more on the stuck up side, when I went. And still expected a high tip?!?! Hmmm.. Wait for food was pretty long. In fact, wait for a table was long too!!  Food is good regardless, but I rather be someplace where I can hear my conversation, and for a better price."
