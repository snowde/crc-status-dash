Chey E.,"Bakersfield, CA",184,27,16,1.0,3/7/2017,"I used to love coming to Bj's, but lately the customer service is just getting worse. I always feels like my order is being rushed, none of my waiters even have a nice attitude, and I feel like they're never listening because my order is always wrong. I'm not coming back anymore."
Connor S.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,3,,2.0,6/17/2017,Consistently good food. Consistently bad service. Always in the back of my mind when people suggest going here.
Olivia C.,"Nokesville, VA",46,2,,3.0,6/17/2017,"Use to be my favorite, I would order to go all the time. But since they got rid of my favorite chicken dish, everything else I've had there has been kind of blah. I asked if they could still make the dish I liked (grilled chicken with cooked spinach, crispy onion straws and mash potatoes)..but instead they gave me a bland grilled chicken, with uncooked spinach, a glob of caramelized onions and a side of some undercooked rice....the alcohol is still good."
Jaylan J.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,8,,4.0,1/23/2017,"Came here for dinner with my brothers, the place gets very busy, i was greeted and nicely helped by a lady named tatiana"
Jade T.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/30/2016,The food was good as always.  Night went well service was good until waitress mentioned a persons tip at table.  Then came around again to proceed and tell the table AGAIN about their tipping habits. Terrible service from one of the Sara's. Many were paying with a card and wanted to leave cash as their tip. Dont be rude and disrespectful.
Matt H.,"Redlands, CA",11,10,31,4.0,10/5/2016,"This is a favorite place of my wife and I, we love the seared Ahi salad and you can never go wrong with pizzas."
Penny L.,"Bakersfield, CA",210,188,470,3.0,12/25/2014,"BJ's has consistently decent food for a chain restaurant. They've got a great variety and a decent selection at the bar.  A vodka tonic will set you back $8.50 though, which I feel is SUPER overpriced.  Tomato, mozzarella, balsamic, red onion salad is the BEST. It's tossed with fresh basil and is excellent. This is big enough to be a meal, tbh.  Balsamic glazed chicken is great. Comes with garlic mashed potatoes, shoestring onion rings, and some greens.  Tomato basil bisque is pretty good. Clam chowder is okay, but I'm not a big clam chowder fan anyway.  Any pizza you put together is gonna be excellent. Their sauce is a little too sweet for my liking, but alas.  I've always liked all of their fish I've had, too. Good pasta selection.  Everything here is very, very heavy on sodium, fyi. I know a lot of you try to watch it.  However, our service was so crappy I'm tempted to just give it three stars. 35 minutes to take our order. They weren't busy. When I asked for a lime wedge for my vodka tonic (they usually come standard, why did I even have to ask??) it took nearly ten minutes to get them. By that time, most of the ice had melted.  She took our menus away without taking our order. In the ten minutes between that and when she finally came back to get our order, we had forgotten what we wanted and what they were called. When we expressed we weren't sure we were ordering the right thing, she didn't want to walk over and get us menus again! She played the guessing game instead for a few minutes. Super, SUPER annoying.  It took her nearly 20 minutes to get our bill. Another 10 for her to come and take our card.  Now that I am remembering my frustration, I'm taking them down to three stars. After that service, even despite the good food, I feel like that's being generous."
Dayna S.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,3,,2.0,2/16/2017,"My husband and I have eaten here a few times. Every time we come in to eat, the service is awful. Especially at lunch time.  I tried to call ahead for a large party and I was informed that a party of the size I was calling about had a time limit of 2 hours maximum. Keep in mind the girl that answered was completely snobby and rude. It didn't matter that we were celebrating a 21st birthday. 2 hours is all we were allowed.  I was quite upset so I called back and spoke to the manager that was on and I was issued a ""curtesy gift card""  I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and go back again (only bc I had a gift card). The server we had was good to start. We got our food and then he disappeared. When he returned it was only to ask if we wanted dessert. He then brought us the check. We waited for him for about 20-25 minutes to come and get the check along with the gift card. Instead we watched him pace around and go in and out of the back, and stand at the bar and stack coasters in a tower. We ended up leaving cash and no tip and we didn't get the chance to use the gift card.  I can assure, we won't return again."
David I.,"Bakersfield, CA",147,164,282,4.0,1/9/2016,"Today was a special day as my youngest just turned 20 and this is where he wanted to go for his birthday. We had a party of 8 and was able to do a  call ahead to get on the list for a table. FYI, if you do not know about the call aheads it's a form of making a reservation at a place that doesn't take reservations. We arrived a little before 6pm and there was a huge line of people waiting to be seated. Within 5 minutes of our arrival we were sitting at our table.  Terry was our server and was one of the best servers that I have experienced in a while. Within a couple of minutes he was taking our drink orders and it didn't take long for them to arrive. I ordered a featured guest beer that was on the flat side so without any trouble Terry immediately took my beer and I ordered a different one.  We ordered the Mozzarella Sticks the kids favorite, the avocado roll which we absolutely awesome. Real nice crunch on the outside and devious taste on the inside without the grease. My wife order the Rib Eye which was cooked the way she preferred Medium Rare. It had a great char on the outside and nice m/r juicy color on the inside. I ordered the flat bread pizza with green chilies and chicken. The crust nice and thin and crispy. Great flavor of smoky green chilies with out a lot go heat.  The  night wouldn't be complete without desert. The Birthday Boy got a Pizookie topped with ice cream. Nice and warm thin chocolate chip cookie with the creamy vanilla ice cream was a perfect ending to a great experience. Terry and the BJ's staff did a great job taking care of us."
MaryAnn T.,"Long Beach, CA",141,25,20,2.0,3/17/2017,"Usually we have a good night... but today it seems as if everything was over cooked. I had the happy hour ribs and it wasn't good at all. So over-cooked and the meat was tough. Our pazookie was over baked as well. Cookie part was way too crunchy .. the 2 mini pizzas were alright.. not the best.. seemed to lack toppings. Our drinks took a while to get as well.. it wasn't busy when we came.., the only upside... our server was very nice... but she seemed busy... overall... the only reason why I put stars... was for our waitress"
Heather L.,"Bakersfield, CA",64,67,40,5.0,8/17/2016,I was definitely impressed with the food here. Also a good beer selection. I ordered Salmon and my man got the kielbasa. Both dishes were amazing! My kids got the mini corn dogs and I surprised that they were actually really good! Carnival style taste. Not like those frozen ones.
Brandi B.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,13,,1.0,5/1/2017,I come here all the time and this is the worst experience ever! It's my dad's birthday and it has just been ruined. He asked for refills over and over again never got one. My son wanted a refill and didn't get one til all his food was gone. My dad's apps came right when his food came. We saw her shake her head like she was frustrated. It was awful.
Chefcrazzy C.,"Bakersfield, CA",42,3,2,2.0,12/8/2015,"My family and I always dine at BJ's.  This has always been a place for us to go to.  We would order the fried calamari to start off w/ a couple of cocktails or the blonde brew. For entree, I usually get the seared ahi tuna salad (which is the only reason) why I come to BJ's.  However, I've been noticing that the tuna portions on the salad has been getting smaller and smaller.   I mean was there a different chef that day?  I'm highly disappointed.  Probably won't be here in a while."
Eduardo B.,"Bakersfield, CA",2,22,32,5.0,1/18/2016,"Came Here at 2:10pm On a Monday Got Seated Really Fast Exellent Service Honestly. Lupe  and Alejandro Our Server's Had Exellent Customer Service Skills Really Make You Feel Welcome. On Top Of Refills, Always Friendly and Helpful When Asked About Menu Options. Extremely Knowledgeable. Would Definitely Come Again"
Gregory S.,"Lodi, CA",34,127,16,4.0,3/13/2017,"I normally do not write reviews of chain restaurants but BJs is such a hit and miss chain, I feel obligated to name the good, bad, and ugly. Bakersfield falls in the good category. Our waitperson made sure that our experience was as good as she could make it. She moved us away from a table of children. My Chicken Salad was everything I expected from reading the menu. I highly recommend it. My wife enjoyed her southwest salad. My daughter said that her sandwich was very good. I could not resist stealing some of her fries."
Kaitlin C.,"Bakersfield, CA",428,1,,1.0,4/11/2017,"I usually come here for lunch 2-3 times a week, but lately the service has been HORRIBLE. Food did not come out as ordered. Not one refill or even asked if needed anything. Horrible horrible customer service!"
Analyn A.,"Bakersfield, CA",91,200,1211,3.0,12/14/2015,"Hubby likes the beer here.   I like the pizookies.  It's a great place to hang out witth friends and family.  The food is good, not the greatest, but it's good."
Bonnie M.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,4,,2.0,8/6/2017,"Used to be good, but has gotten worse over time. The pizza was always the best item, but now it is usually cold by the time it gets to our table. I've had several of the menu items, which change constantly so if you like something it may not be there later. I don't really like eating here, the service is sub par, and the food is basic. The fries are usually soggy, the burgers are undercooked even when I request well done, and the sandwiches are cold and plain. I think they need to get better at their customer service, the servers either bother you too much or ignore you the entire time. They are not familiar with their menu items, and when asked to fix something they get easily frustrated. The ""pizookie"" is absolutely nothing special it's just a cookie with ice cream on top. This is definitely not my first choice to eat at and I only end up here about once a year when I've exhausted my other options in town."
Chuck R.,"Bakersfield, CA",15,27,5,2.0,2/1/2017,"Food was good, they ran out of Dos Equis , slow service, in ready to leave even w/out a pazuki... Sad Sad Sad..."
Alicia B.,"Bakersfield, CA",113,144,192,4.0,4/15/2016,"Having been here many times I figured it was time to write a review. For a chain I really like this place and it's large offerings on their menu. They offer a large selection of appetizers and small bites with my favorites being the cheese sticks, avocado egg rolls, or artichokes. There broccoli cheddar soup is very good and the extra cheese on top makes it even better. My favorite dish is the Parmesan crusted chicken and I get it almost every time I go. Plus who can resist a Pazookie??? They have this heavenly one with chocolate, peanut butter, marshmallow, and ice cream. Sooo good! They have a wide selection of beer although I'm not much of drinker but I will say their craft soda selection is pretty good. I usually go for the classic root beer but the others are tasty too. My kids love it here too with the wide selection of kids meals as well which makes dining with them easier. I have always had friendly wait staff and the one time something was wrong it was fixed promptly and a discount was given. One major plus that this restaurant offers is call ahead seating and reservations for larger parties!!!! I wish more restaurants would offer this especially in a town with tons of restaurants filled with small lobby waiting areas with temperatures that exceed 100 on the regular during the summer."
