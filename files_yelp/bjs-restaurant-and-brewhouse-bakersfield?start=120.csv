Janna L.,"Bakersfield, CA",285,1276,928,3.0,8/30/2015,"Had never been here before and the location is so convenient for us.. had heard good things so in we came on a Sun afternoon. Pleasantly surprised that it is large, airy, seemed clean enough upon walking in. Bartender service barely there. Took a long time to get a drink at the bar with 2 patrons. Listening skills not the best. Ordered a lemon drop. Seriously watery. Hubby said beer sampler was good and cold. Decent selection of beer.  Not sure how much of an actual 'brewpub' this is. Ordered a deep dish pizza. Was honestly overwhelmed at how large the menu is. Too much stuff. A novel read. So, we went with what they started out with thinking that would be good. First off the pizza was cold. The tomatoes were canned. There was no sauce on the spicy Hawaiian chicken. I did like the chicken chunks and the crust but would order differently next time. NOT spicy. Had to ask for cutlery, napkins and no seasonings accompanied the pizza. Maybe sitting at a regular table would have worked out better with a server. Also, the 20 percent off BJs mobile app does not work. At least did not for us dining in. We liked the atmosphere at the bar. Not too loud but we had wished Happy Hour started before 10pm to get a better deal on drinks. Likely will return."
Brittany J.,"Sheridan, WY",0,78,15,2.0,11/30/2016,Food is always good here but the service SUCKS every time we come here and that's few and far between because of the bad service. Red head waiter dude was the worst. They need to hire more people so they can give some quality service
Shannon G.,"Bakersfield, CA",7,11,2,1.0,10/5/2016,This last weekend my husband and I took my mother to dinner as a thank you. We've all been to BJ's before and have had good to great service. To start with we ordered an appetizer for the table and while this was brought out fairly quickly we did not get any plates and the plater was left to sit on the table after being empty for nearly twenty minutes. During that time two different servers were by the table and could have grabbed it. My mother and husband both ordered salads and neither got them until after the main dishes arrived at the table.  So that by the time my mother got to her beef dip sandwich it was stone cold. Not only did the server not do anything about the fact that the meal came out in completely the wrong order all he said was sorry can I get you a pizookie! I'm sick of terrible service.
Maria V.,"Bakersfield, CA",21,11,4,2.0,11/25/2016,Didn't care for their boneless chicken wing. It wasn't chicken wings it was chicken nuggets and I wasn't impressed. Last time I had the bone in and they were great. I wish they would have told me it was nuggets I wouldn't have ordered t
Dan G.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,53,,1.0,4/3/2017,Food took forever to get to us. I had fish & chips which were greasy and tasted terrable. The waitress was terrible too. She took forever to get us anything and couldnt remember what we ordered. It was one of the worst dinning experence Ive ever had. Im not going back.
Shawn B.,"Bakersfield, CA",24,107,85,4.0,3/29/2016,"The food was very good. We got the mozzarella sticks to start (as we always do). Both my wife, mused , and my kids love mozzarella sticks and the ones from BJs are our favorites. They are always served with the cheese warm and gooey and the breading is unique. It is very crunchy and seems hand battered.  I got two of their small app dishes, artichoke dip stuffed mushrooms and fried artichoke hearts. Both were very good. I enjoyed this tapas style meal with there specialty root beer, which was excellent as always.  The servers were friendly and prompt except for our original drinks, which came to our table about 3-4 minutes after out appetizer. That's a first for me."
Jason S.,"Clovis, CA",7,117,74,5.0,10/14/2016,They have a very good lunch special. I had the half sandwich and salad and my girl had the half potato and salad. They were both amazing! We both got the wedge salad which is one of my favorites. The chicken club half sandwich and wedge fries were a perfect size for me. My girls half potato was huge! She couldn't finish it with her salad. The customer service we received from the bartender was exceptional! I believe her name was Nicole. She was very attentive to us. I highly recommend the lunch specials
Ronald C.,"Ridgecrest, CA",0,9,,1.0,6/23/2017,Don't eat here if you have food allergies.  The chefs substitute ingredients from those listed on the menu.  The asparagus portabello salad came with pinenuts... which my wife is allergic to.  The spicy peanut chicken soba noodles?  Toasted blanched almonds instead of peanuts.  I'm allergic to almonds.  And the friers aren't zoned so don't order anything deep fried if you have a shell fish allergy.
Mike D.,"Bakersfield, CA",10,43,,5.0,12/13/2016,"Updated...Went on a Sunday afternoon and couldn't find my favorite entree on the new menu (Balsamic chicken)...I asked the young waitress and she said that it had been taken off the menu but I could still order it, so that was what I did...amazing dish....by far the best thing they serve IMO....Had a delicious meal with the wife (who also had the same thing) and we left happy but puzzled...I had been told this was one of the more popular dishes they served and am wondering why it was taken off the menu?? Service as usual was stellar..."
Jay L.,"Bakersfield, CA",2,14,1,1.0,3/20/2016,"If I could give anything less than one star I absolutely would it. Not one of the five waiters that passed us by stopped to check if anyone has taken our order.  There is a group of degenerates hanging out in the front where the host is supposed to be at, not one of them could stop by. Mind you it wasn't very busy.  Incredibly shitty service the store manager asked if my friend and I were still there and I told him absolutely not why would I wait another 30 minutes before my order gets taken.  Sitting there for thirty minutes waiting for a fucking waiter. Shitty service."
L R.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/29/2017,"Service was horrible!!! We were a party of 4 and taken to a table that only had 2 chairs and still had drinks on it from the previous party. Once we were seated it took 10 minutes for a server to greet us. She seemed flustered and annoyed. She took our orders. Food came in a reasonable amount of time. Food was good. We were never offered any refills and we were all out of drinks. When we paid our server she disappeared for at least 10 minutes. The party next to us also complained about the service. There were at least 6 tables around us that had been left dirty and were never cleaned off. When our server finally returned, she said she could only find one $20 bill and paid us the rest in $5's."
Randy S.,"Bakersfield, CA",9,118,17,3.0,3/18/2016,"I really like this restaurant but it is SO ANNOY ING when we get here, there are 15+ open tables but there is a 30 minute wait. I don't stick around for this nonsense but hunger takes over. That said, the food is GREAT!!! I love everything I've ever had here!!"
Matthew R.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,1,,3.0,2/14/2017,"Food was decent, waited over an hour for a table. Host at front desk, large African American woman, was very rude. She told us we could sit at the bar. I informed her we needed a booth for my wife. She told us that would be a lot longer wait. I informed her we have been waiting over an hour. She rolled her eyes and told us it will be a longer wait and to sit at the bar. Food wasn't the best. Will not be coming here again."
Sarah B.,"San Pablo, CA",288,120,387,4.0,3/29/2015,"I have lunch with my Dad at BJs when I'm in town as it is close to his house, and as I mentioned in my previous review, I've never had bad service.  This visit was no exception.  Their menu has a variety of options from pizza to burgers to salad.  Some may not agree with me on this,  but I actually really like that they include the calories on the menu.  They have a lengthy beer selection here as well.  I noticed that they have added a few more ""healthier"" options, which is great given how caloric their signature items can be.  I ordered their bison burger, that comes with a small side salad, and an iced tea (no beer for me this afternoon!) I 86'd the bun bc I knew Id be having a carb-loaded dinner later that evening.  She asked if I wanted it lettuce wrapped, and I love that more places are doing this.  My burger was cooked to order, always a good thing.   My dad had the bacon burger and subbed a wedge salad for the fries; there is a charge to do this.  He enjoyed his meal.  We were asked if we wanted dessert, I had to decline even though my Dad was hoping we'd share one of their delicious pizookies. I've had them before and they are delicious, maybe next time."
Snooky C.,"Bakersfield, CA",65,81,185,3.0,11/11/2015,"Food was OK,  I also tried the Mahi tacos and riser were very good.  Waitress was very nice."
Stephanie Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,97,46,1.0,8/17/2016,"I would have to give them a low score because they didn't honor my coupon for a free appetizer I got my check then I told the waiter about the coupon. He said ""okay I got you"" then another man came back with my credit card and same exact check. If I can save 10$ I would've loved it because the food was good. But don't offer something you want to pretend doesn't exist at your convenience. It was so late I didn't want to argue I just miserably payed the check and left"
Lynn L.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/18/2016,"Think twice before using the curbside service.. If you don't mind waiting 30-45 minutes and don't care about them getting your order correct, then this is for you!!"
James D.,"Bakersfield, CA",21,108,,2.0,9/28/2015,"""Watch your step."" BJ's reminds me that customer service is dead.  We live in an era where, in the cost vs. benefit equation, it's more profitable for a restaurant to invest in moving units/product than establishing relationships between companies and customers. And that makes sense because why should a company invest in competent employees when they can procure more profit by hiring quick and selling fast. The truth is that BJ's would rather have ten unhappy customers than two regular customers because on either side of the analysis, they still got paid.  To that effect, employees here don't go above and beyond. They aren't paid to do that. They exhume their motivation: Good performance means doing just enough not to get fired. And should we blame them? In Post Recession America, where men and women who devoted decades of their lives to companies only to get terminated or laid off, loyalty is dead. And loyalty always means that employees will do their best for the customers because value between an employee and a company are mutual.  I have been to BJ's many times. Food is cheap (relatively) and satisfying. But service is deplorable. And that's okay because I don't expect much out of anyone anymore and I mean that about all companies across the board. I can't remember the last time I walked into a restaurant or store and encountered an employee and thought, ""Wow they treated me with respect and work hard."" Instead I can't even get yogurt without some asinine late teens high schooler giving me attitude because she has to actually work on a Friday night instead of getting hyphy with her friends.  And why do I constantly need to be told to watch my step upon entering the dining area? If it is such a bane, fix the step!"
Joseph S.,"Tehachapi, CA",90,10,3,1.0,8/3/2016,"I have been here multiple times and tonight would have to be my first time having a bad experience. I ordered an iced tea and a BJ's Baked Beignet. I received my iced tea within 2 minutes (which isn't bad at all) After waiting roughly TwentyFive minutes I finally received my desert. The ice cream was soup and barely any strawberries at all. There literally was no more ice in the ""Ice Cream"" I don't feel I should pay for this desert although they offered me another one. The service wasn't bad but I didn't receive any refills for my iced tea until she handed me the check and I verbally asked her. I am highly upset with how things went tonight and I think I will stop coming for awhile."
Emily L.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,7,4,5.0,3/24/2016,"Great overall experience! My bestfriend and I love the pazookies here so we always come on dates to try new ones. We definitely recommend the monkey bread one it tastes like a cinnabun! We had great service from Amber who was very nice and funny. And also were very welcomed and complimented by Oscar, both of them made our bestfriend date such a great  night! Thank you so much! Will be coming back soon!"
