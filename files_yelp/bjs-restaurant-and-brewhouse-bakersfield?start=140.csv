Nicole D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,4.0,3/21/2016,"I have been here a lot and I love this place. Brews and food are always on point. However I recently went this past said Patrick's day and had the worst waiter ever. I believe his name was Oscar. He constantly interrupted all of us at the table in the middle of our order and at one point I went to ask him for ranch for my pizza and he literally yelled at me saying ""I have a lot going on right now girl"" basically scolding me for asking him to do his job. On Top of it he called me ""girl"" which just felt rude. Being a server myself in usually suuuper chill about it because I understand but this guy was completely out of hand and made everyone at the table uncomfortable. The place wasn't even that busy for him to be like that either   Again, I love this place. Just hated that guy."
Shannon C.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,21,,5.0,8/18/2016,I always like what I order. It is consistently good. Service is good. Place is clean. Location is great. I get especially excited about the Cobb Salad....Yum
Arlene M.,"Bakersfield, CA",12,39,93,3.0,6/3/2016,"Agree with fellow yelpers. Food is good not great.  After a concert at amphitheater, came here to eat and drink.  Enjoyed the happy hour pricing.  Sat in booth at bar area and our waitress Izzy was pleasant, quick, and friendly even though she was extremely busy."
Chris K.,"Bakersfield, CA",92,10,12,5.0,6/22/2016,Team Jacob!!! Food drinks are ok it's all about great service thanks Jacob the bar attendant !!as far as that manager Joe Overall good service!!!
Lorraine S.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,9,,1.0,3/12/2017,"Everything has gone downhill from the customer service to the food!! They don't serve wedge cut fries or the skinny fries anymore!!! I called Burbank and one in Ventura county and they still serve those fries, I guess I'll have to go out of town to eat at a Bj's. You would think that the waiters would be on top of their tables as they would like it if it were the other way around."
Trish S.,"Bakersfield, CA",47,89,92,3.0,10/8/2015,"The Parmesan crusted chicken is one of my favorite items on the menu.  It's light yet satisfying, with a bright flavor and nice texture to the thin chicken cutlets.  I also recommend any of their handcrafted sodas.  The orange cream reminds me of childhood."
Michael D.,"Bakersfield, CA",16,11,10,4.0,12/26/2015,"After being the ""new"" restaurant in town for so long this is now a Bakersfield staple. Great food and service and always polite with great service. The Black and Blue Burger is great and so are the pizzas. Dates or family either will have a good time."
Holly W.,"Bakersfield, CA",14,67,14,5.0,10/15/2015,Love this place! They have a gluten free menu and lots of choices! The staff took good care of us. Also Great atmosphere!
Yonnie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",95,1972,1916,3.0,4/24/2013,"My coworkers and I came here for lunch on a weekday and it was packed. I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta (angel hair pasta with shrimp, tossed in some garlic/olive oil sauce). It was quite filling, as I got the regular dinner portion instead of the lunch size. I couldn't finish all the pasta, but ate all the shrimp! There were at least 8 pieces in there. I give the dish 3.5 stars because the flavor was rather lacking.... The entree also came with 2 pieces of toast, covered with some cheese crumbs. I only ate one of them, since it was just way too much carbs. haha :) Our server was prompt, friendly, and even provided us with extra small plates for cake cutting. It was nice of them! Since this restaurant is a chain, the vibe reminds me of the ones I've been to in Huntington Beach. Big screen TVs and would probably be a nice place to come for happy hour... :)"
Chris L.,"Bakersfield, CA",48,3,,5.0,2/4/2017,"Great atmosphere, great food and great service. Our waiter Casey kept our drinks filled and any request was addressed quickly. The pazookie is awesome."
heather h.,"Tehachapi, CA",77,73,62,3.0,11/17/2016,"While our service was very good and the food was great I'm upset with your gift card policy for the holidays. We planned on buying a $100 gc because our bill was $90 and getting the extra perks of the holiday bonuses ($25 cars for future use, 20% VIP card, and the glasses) but our server told us that we couldn't use the $100 gc for a few days. We were very perplexed because we've done this at many restaurants including yours every year for probably the past 5-7 years. I asked ""if we bought a gc as a gift today and gave it to someone tonight they couldn't use it for a few days?"" The server went and double checked with her manager and he said that's correct. Seems kinda crappy for people buying last minute gifts and people wanting to buy your Christmas bonus gc and not being able to use them right away. I understand not being able to use the extra perks. I know those are always good after he holidays. But the gift card should be usable right after you load money onto it."
Pat B.,"Bakersfield, CA",116,218,162,4.0,3/22/2016,"Tonight we shared their new triple decker sandwich with their wedge cut fries, a house salad with blue cheese dressing and a couple of Jerimiah Reds.  It was delicious.  Service was great.  No complaints at all.  This is still one of our favorite places."
Patricia M.,"Bakersfield, CA",3,50,14,2.0,6/2/2016,"Service is ATROCIOUS. I've never had good and timely service; not even once. Food is delicious, but not worth the trouble. They hate to split checks, often wait 20-30 minutes to take your order, and food usually takes another 30-60 mins after that. They rarely check back for refills on water, but will check in and offer more bar (read:expensive) drinks often. You must ask for refills otherwise."
Deborah G.,"Bakersfield, CA",48,2,,2.0,7/17/2016,Early dinner with family Saturday night.  Waitress was not a people person and our food order was not correct.  Fair experience.
Krista E.,"Castro Valley, CA",252,1,,3.0,12/15/2016,"Liz the waitress is the rudest person to have serve you. She doesn't come refill drinks and she speaks in a very rude tone about everything. I am shocked that she has kept her job. She would go over and talk badly with coworkers about our orders and our table. Very unprofessional. No issues with bjs, just the staff."
Jaime G.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,7,,5.0,7/13/2016,My son and I just had lunch at BJ's. We had the best server named Oscar. He was so attentive and nice. He made our dining experience great! Our food was great! I love that they have low-cal options! Thanks Oscar for being a great server!!!
Stephen S.,"Ridgecrest, CA",1,15,1,1.0,5/27/2016,"When we arrived,  the host explained that it would be a 20-25 minute wait. It has been double that amount of time and we still haven't been seated. When we asked the server about it he simply said ""things change"". This is very upsetting because I have watched 3 other parties of two who arrived after us, get seated before us."
Gail M.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,9,,2.0,7/24/2017,"We have been going to BJ's for  a long time and up until a few moths ago the food was great, service we experienced, not so much.We got a coupon for buy one meal and two beverages and get one free. So we decided to try again. This was about 10 days ago. We went and the first thing was waiting at the podium. Nobody else there a group came in behind us. Finally a hostess comes but has her backed turned to us. My husband and I said party of 2. She turns her back again. We looked at each like here we go again. We get seated and it did take some time for our waitress to come but our server was very bubbly, took our drink order and by the time she was back we knew what we wanted. I had the grilled salmon on a bed of vegetables. My husband ordered the Jambalaya and asked it not be too spicy, so she said mild? he said yes. It took over an hour for our food to get there When it did I took one bite of the salmon and it was tasteless and cold. You had to look carefully to see what was eaten from it, that is how little of it I tasted. My husband said omg this thing is more spice than any other taste. He said he was fine he could eat it. The server came by and I told her, she asked ""do you want to order something else?"" I was skeptical but I said fine. Some guy brought me a menu and I chose parmesan chicken, with mash potatoes. It took over 20 mins to get that. At one point the sever walked by and said they were waiting on mash potatoes. By the time the food came out, the broccoli was cold. She apologized saying she sorry my hubby and I didn't get to eat together.  They sent me a survey which I answered truthfully. I get an email from someone saying they apologize for my experience, and will send us a e gift card with the hopes we will give them a try again. Look for it in a few days. Well this was since the 15th and today being the 24th I guess the few days have not arrived yet. My thing is..I do not want something for nothing and I doubt I will go back anytime soon. But f you give your word on something then do it!"
Mark J.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,10,1,1.0,6/4/2016,I use to really enjoy this place however the last three visits have continued to really disapoint. The service is almost as bland as the food. I'm not sure if ownership has changed but the food is about the same quality as Sizzles or Carl's Jr. I can't recommend anyone to visit as I don't plan on ever going back until I hear things changed.
Camille B.,"Bakersfield, CA",191,224,56,5.0,6/14/2015,"I have no complaints about this place. All the food I have ordered at this location has come out to my liking. The bar area is a quick way to avoid the waiting for real seats. The bar menu is also extensive and delicious. I love coming here for the pizza, a good pasta, appetizers, sandwiches, or wings. They also make their own beers, ciders, and root beer. There are lots of TVs to watch sports. You can also order take out. The servers are attentive and friendly. Not bad, just a little pricey but still worth stopping in."
