Bre L.,"Bakersfield, CA",4,23,18,5.0,8/17/2016,"This is your classic American chain - however BJ's has stepped it up a notch. The inside is very nice, as it always has been. They have great costumer service, although our waitress lost our credit card for like 5 minutes, but she seemed very sincere and I think it was just a misunderstanding. In the end, we got it back. I had the Salmon quinoa bowl, and it was very good. Everything was flavored nicely, and everyone at my table was eating off my plate!! For dessert I ordered the gluten free pizookie. If you don't know what a Pizookie is, you haven't lived yet. It's straight from the heavens. I was very depressed on the way there, because I used to be able to eat them before I went gluten free, which is why I was stoked when I saw they have a gluten free option!!! Never have I ever gone to a restaurant and been able to order a gluten free dessert that wasn't ice cream. It was very very good. I will definitely be going way more often!"
Reyna C.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,5,,4.0,6/27/2016,I have grown to love bjs so much.The food is always great every time we have mostly had great service too.The pizza is great also the stuffed mushrooms are amazing
Brenda L.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,16,3,4.0,4/27/2016,"My family and I come here about once a month. I enjoy the atmosphere a whole lot.  My husband goes for the beer, the kids go for the pizza and I go for their yummy chicken club sandwich.  My husband usually orders their bacon cheeseburger which is a good size and delicious. The kids share a deep dish classic combo pizza (finger licking good) and I usually order the chicken club which has avocado and bacon (pure goodness). The service has always been great, but last night our waiter, Oscar, took the cookie. He was energetic, polite, and very efficient.  It's people like Oscar that make you want to return to these places ."
Mercedes F.,"Porterville, CA",1,23,,1.0,12/17/2016,"Went in for lunch and there was a wait so the host asked for our name and would call us when there was a table ready. Turns out there are tables available with no wait list and my sister and I sat waiting as everyone got seated. The host saw us but didn't bother to ask what we were waiting for. After we got seated because we were hesitant to sit, our server was took our order and didn't check up on us as often as she should have. When our meals were brought they got my sisters order wrong. They sent back the food and had supposedly started on her plate. After waiting a really long time for her food we canceled the order and just paid for one meal. Very disappointed with the servers because people pay for the experience and the food. We didn't get a good experience on any of those two things."
Revan L.,"Middletown, CT",1,55,46,4.0,2/9/2015,"We LOVE BJS! Always order curbside, to go, but the food is GREAT and so is the service when we do order. addicted to the deep dish cookies mmm"
Aaron R.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,2,1,1.0,5/13/2016,"We were told that our wait was 25 minutes. 45 minutes later we are told there is only 10 more minutes. 20 minutes go by. We ask how long the wait is then. 30 minutes they said. After that we complain and then we talk to the manager who is extremely rude and makes horrible comments about our group right in front of our face. We then just say ""whatever we don't want to hear it well just wait"" ... He then says ""excuse me we can just take you off the list , then goes inside and talks to his workers point at us giving us rude looks.  We ended up waiting 2 hours and got horrible staff service. So in conclusion. There staff here is incredibly rude but I guess you have to put up with it because it's one of the few places to get decent food in Bakersfield."
Ron R.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,19,,2.0,12/7/2016,"what they claimed was ""blackened ahi tuna"" was some type of nasty fish. the manager did take 50% off of my meal (i ate the small salad and half of the under-baked potato) after looking at the fish and saying it was over cooked is why it tasted bad,  so i guess he figured since i ate the sides i should half to pay for those items. grandaughters rib eye steak needed a saw to cut through it, same under baked potato, fries were good. my wife had the baked viti and she said it was very good, friend had some type of pasta and she loved it. overall for 2 adults and two 14 year olds a 100.00 dinner (no alcohol, just tea and soda) after the fish was discounted, was a total waste of time and money.  the only reason they received 2 stars was two of the meals (both the cheaper ones) were good and two were awful."
Steve K.,"Bakersfield, CA",102,68,21,2.0,4/26/2015,"Friday night with 2 of my kids. We got the stuffed mushrooms and hot wings to warm up. They came late, right before our meal. Disappointing. Daughter had small chicken bacon ranch pizza. Son had buffalo  chicken n barbeque chicken pizza. I had santa fe barbeque chicken salad. They forgot the avocado. When I asked they brought me a super small portion. Bummer. I was looking forward to that. Son's pizza was good. My salad decent. Daughter's pizza made her sick. She later threw it up. Shucks! She was horrified. I called the next day. The manager apologized. That's it. Oh well. Glad there's many other places to choose from. So long BJ's."
Celeste Z.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,2,,5.0,12/1/2016,"Ate here last night. Food and service were both great! Our server Andrew was very nice, attentive and took great care of us."
John O.,"Los Angeles, CA",136,576,46,3.0,1/22/2015,"I had never been to a BJ's before and wow.........seriously underwhelming.  I had a business lunch meeting here and the client suggested BJ's.  Bleh.  Contrary to the reviews, the service was good.   The food on the other hand was typical chain food (think Applebees).  I figured having never been to BJ's before, I'd try one of their famous pizzas.   A 9"" ""The Works"" sounded like it would suffice.   Oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes.  The pizza tasted not far off from Stouffers frozen pizza you can pick up at aisle 5 at your local supermarket.  To make things worse, BJ's has all of the caloric values of the food they serve listed on the menu.  You can now see why America is bursting at the seams!  Make no mistake, this place is a haven for high calorie food.   Nearly everything on the menu is loaded with calories.   Interested in their famous ""pizookie"" -- that'll set you back 1088 calories and 115% of your daily saturated fat intake , fat boy.  That's  over 50% of the recommended caloric intake for the average American.   Oink oink America!   If you're looking for the ""Applebee's of pizza places"" - you'll find it at BJ's Restaurant."
Alice H.,"Bakersfield, CA",6,106,40,3.0,5/6/2015,"Salmon dishes- the salmon dishes they offer are very tasty.  Basil, mozzarella and tomato salad is very delicious."
Crystal H.,"Panorama City, CA",109,264,81,3.0,2/20/2014,Had the appetizer platter...oh my!!! food was good. :) can't really say much about it. of course had better elsewhere but it was all comfort food. Had the veggie dip dish pizza...and it was ok..I felt it was a bit warm. The server was nice!
Vinn N.,"Biloxi, MS",4,57,224,4.0,6/19/2015,"I really enjoyed this place! Back home we do not have one, so I will definitely visit again when back in town. I had the Mahi mahi which was superb! We all had no complaints with meal and waitress. Shayla was awesome! Oh! Santa Fe eggrolls were yumm too!"
Tiffany P.,"Fresno, CA",3,141,23,1.0,3/19/2016,"Horrible Service!!!   We waited for 45 minutes before a server took our order, only to have her change servers, which delayed us getting served again!     Then, our order was incorrect and we had to repeat many of or requests we had initially given the original server to this new server-yet again!    Worse of all, they took our credit card and we never got it back and had to report it stolen!  We got the receipt, but not the card and we didn't realize it until we got back to the house.  We called them and told them what happened and the card was not found by them!!   Either someone there is shady or they were just sloppy as was our service and food!   NEVER AGAIN!   We're emailed corporate in the morning.   BEWARE!"
Windy H.,"Bakersfield, CA",5,4,5,5.0,7/3/2014,Bj's is my most visited restaurant in Bakersfield.  Delicious food.  great service. And fast servings except on weekend.  Their appetizers are very delicious and my favorite one is the avocado egg roll. I have to order this every time I go in there.  I recommend this restaurant to everyone I know. Updated 3/5/2015 Their food is getting so bad. I used to love their avocado egg rolls. Last time I ordered it. It has no seasoning plus it wasn't cooked right.  I also ordered the Santa Fe salad and the garden vegetable baked potato. The salad had way too much seasoning and salty which it's odd. And the veggie potato was empty except of some great beans. so it was a garden vegetables potato without vegetables.  It was really my favorite restaurant in town I used to come three to four times a month.  but why is that big change in the food quality.  Please be careful to your cooker bcz you will loose more customers.  Updated  4/3/2016 I can't stop coming here. And the service is back to 5 stars. The food is always amazing and the employees are very friendly and nice.  Love this restaurant and will always be my favorite.
Elena K.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,5,,3.0,5/21/2016,I'm OK with their food. Seems like it looks and sounds better on the menu than what winds up on the table. We've ordered the pizza and the middle was uncooked. They do have a good selection of craft beers - too bad the food doesn't match the brews.
Marc G.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,2,1,1.0,11/14/2016,"Bad experience at this restaurant. I've eaten at BJ's many times before. This weekend a group of 7 of us waited about 20 minutes to be sat, which was an average wait time. The waitress took a long time to even bring waters to the table after we ordered drinks. She spilled a beer on me, said she would get me a rag, walked away and brought back a broom to clean the spill. I know you have to clean a spill right away but she could have at least brought a towel back with her. She then made excuses saying ""I'm not a rookie"" ""Maybe someone bumped into my tray, I don't know what you want me to do!"" Very rude and unprofessional."
Sandy N.,"Bakersfield, CA",10,30,50,1.0,9/30/2016,"I'm not sure what happened to this place. The food used to be great but it seems like it's going downhill. I came here to celebrate my mom's birthday, ordered the crusted parmesian chicken for her and the late night burger. The parm chicken was bitter and leathery so I switched my mom and gave her my burger I just didn't want to change the happy birthday mood. Still I couldn't even get to the second piece of the chicken and left it in the plate. To top it off I had actually told the waiter to tell the chef that the parm chicken is for the birthday lady over here so he can take care of her order extra special. I guess he did the other way. The late night burger was soggy and had a ton of chille verde sauce in it which we didn't appreciate, also wasn't finished ... I ordered a drink twice and ended up getting it right before we left! We were told that they were short handed and so they were courteous about taking it back. So didn't really eat much and didn't get a drink to begin with. They also took out one of two appetizers were ordered from our tab, hence, the 1 star. Ended up with a $70 bill and didn't enjoy anything from what we ordered. The waiter didn't even bring us a pizzoki for mom's birthday! Although I did mention it was her birthday when we ordered. Very disappointing! Other than that I'd only be going here for the happy hour drinks... maybe."
Philip And Dahlia A.,"Bakersfield, CA",14,61,73,3.0,7/17/2015,"Out for a little alone time. Grabbed a couple of their house IPAs and that satisfied our beer craving. The Spinach-Artichoke dip is always a hit but that's where the good stopped. It took 45 minutes to get our food. We were long finished with our appetizer and drinks before the waitress came by and apologized for the wait. The mahi mahi tacos were good, but the scampi shrimp pasta tasted like a microwave meal without flavor and texture. I'll give it a 3 for the beers but the food definitely deserves a 2."
William N.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,41,17,2.0,3/11/2016,"Came for dinner. Always love the beers. Got the Jambalaya. Bad mistake. Tasted like spicy paprika. I love spicy. Mexican is my favorite. But this was just spicy paprika. I couldn't taste the shrimp or the chicken or the sausage. I couldn't taste the peppers or the onion. Rice pilaf? I could see it, but I couldn't taste it. Gave up a third of the way through. The waiter asked if I was done. I told him it was terrible. Did he ask what was wrong? No. He asked if I wanted dessert. (BJ's has the worst desserts of any chain (I come here for the great beer and mediocre food). Advice: Don't order the Jambalaya!"
