marisol g.,"Chico, CA",12,34,8,4.0,4/14/2015,"Just ate here. The food wasn't too bad, I just got a hamburger. The prices weren't THAT high as others have complained. We got two burgers, and two house beers on tap for $35 bucks. It is no Sierra Nevada (nothing is better than Sierra Nevada in Chico) but still tasty. Also, our waitress was very friendly and attentive."
Laura J.,"Bakersfield, CA",42,7,5,5.0,6/14/2015,"BJ's never disappoints. The service is top notch. The food is fresh with appropriate portions. You'll love the pizzas and, yes, they have my favorite, Buffalo Chicken Pizza! The wines and beers are always cold. They are consistently awesome."
George S.,"Bakersfield, CA",101,6,,1.0,9/24/2016,"Myself and my significant other are pretty solid regulars (3-5) times a month, plus more if you count the beer-only visits. Hands down, we had the worst service ever this evening. Our table was forgotten about for 15-20 minutes twice, our forgotten appetizer was never mentioned (or delivered), our pizzookies were orders as minis instead of large (adding insult to injury was offering us another mini to compensate; i get the gesture but still, it was too late) and the fact that I had to get up for our tables party of 6 to ask for our tickets. I'm in the service industry, I understand some days are rough, but not acknowledging it and then same is the worst customer service anyone can experience. We paid in exact cash on purpose to not have to wait any longer. It sucks because the guy that got passed on to us is the name on the ticket when it was the waitress before him who is responsible. I will be calling tomorrow (due to the current time) to speak to a manager. Editing to add we did not get a single refill unless we requested one."
Nathan C.,"Bakersfield, CA",2,27,,1.0,6/4/2015,"Booked a table for family and friends after our infant sons' baby dedication. Called 10 days in advance and they said ""No problem, we'll have a table for you"". Called 2 days in advance and day of to confirm and it was still ""No problem"".  Showed up 15 minutes early and they had split our party into 2 separate tables. We sat down and asked to speak to the manager. When she came over we asked why we could not all sit together, she said that ""this is how they do it"" and ""if you wanted to sit at the same table, you would have needed to wait"". We said that we would have waited had we known that. No understanding or apologies were offered. When my wife's meal came there was a long brown hair in her mashed potatoes and sauce. They did apologize and take it back but when the waitress who served us came out she said ""it's blonde so it wasn't mine"", insinuating that it was my wife's hair. They did remove her order from the bill. I feel like BJ's should make people aware that they may be at separate tables and at least apologize when they make mistakes like that. Have ate there several times but will avoud this location in the future."
Kris P.,"Orange, CA",14,25,37,4.0,2/20/2016,Great quinoa and salmon n shrimp for lunch...BOGO FREE rocks...waitress was awesome!!
Kenneth K.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,21,,5.0,4/17/2017,i love their pizzas.  it is kind of pricey but worth it.  to save money i order take out and check for special deal.
Jenifer M.,"Bakersfield, CA",95,88,6,3.0,12/16/2015,"I attended dinner last night for our company Christmas dinner and was really disappointed. I have been here a few time and always with large party's and I have never had a bad experience until last night. We had a party of 8 shoved  all into a small booth space, when I told the girl seating us I don't think we will all fit she counted us and said yep table seats 8 and moved on. Really?? We then ordered drinks and no one was pleased you could not taste the alcohol at all each of our drinks was nothing but juice! So we brought it up to the server and her comment was ""it will sneak up on you"" omg did she just say that? She did not offer to fix the drinks or talk to the bar tender so that was the last drinks we ordered. Lots of money lost for this restaurant we would have drank a lot that night. The server was so slow we had to keep asking for things several times it was very frustrating. Then she starts to see our frustration and tells us all about her personal life running late for work having a small kid at home etc.... Really? We don't care!!! Feed us and get your act together!!! On another note the food was amazing good as always but everything else ruined our company Christmas party sad!"
Brando C.,"Bakersfield, CA",4,7,2,1.0,5/9/2015,"While eating my pizza tonight I found a 12"" hair intertwined in the slice. Come on BJ's it's the 21st Century. There shouldn't be hair in your food!!! That's disgusting."
Mike T.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,13,,2.0,10/5/2016,Went there for a birthday dinner. They lost the reservation for our party of 20. So they jammed us in a corner with little room. The food was ok however they need to learn the art of delivering food to the table at the same! Me and about 3 others didn't get our food until the rest of the table finished. I like BJs but they need to step up their game
Evan F.,"Bakersfield, CA",48,8,1,2.0,9/5/2016,"I went out with a group of friends and we all agreed on Bj's. I decided to splurge and get a nice rib eye steak. I've had many nice steaks at numerous restaurants around the U.S. This steak was cooked as asked and juicy but was one of the saltiest steaks I have ever had.  I also had the Ahi Poke'. It was drenched in soy sauce and salty also. I couldn't even taste the food it was so over salted. We had trouble getting our waiter to refill our drinks, even once! Once we got him, he only refilled half of the table. At one point we were sucking on the ice cubes. We never did get anymore refills, not even water. He took twenty minutes to bring our check. Once we had been served our food, we were forgotten about. Even when we asked for more drinks and then finally just give us the check so I could go home and get some water, we were left hanging. I finally tracked him down and said we need to go, please bring our check and don't make us wait another 20 minutes to process it please. Not very impressed. My tab alone was $38 in food. Maybe because none of us ordered alcohol he couldn't bother with us?"
Claudia B.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,18,14,5.0,10/7/2015,"Love coming here with the hubby, although the wait takes forever the times we have came the service is awesome and the staff is friendly. Enjoy the shrimp dinners they have and you can't go wrong with the chicken Parmesan. The mashed potatoes are the best . Will definitely be back, when my wallet is full. Hehe."
Cristi J.,"Bakersfield, CA",290,52,9,1.0,10/28/2014,Got here at 6:50 on a Tuesday night.  It's 8:18 and we still have not received our food.  We did not order appetizers.  We will not be coming back. ***Update Finally brought the food out at 8:30.  It was cold and no plate for the pizza.  No refills.  Never did bring that plate.  DH was so hungry he just ate it without.  Shameful.
Kalli L.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,40,4,4.0,1/27/2016,"I think BJ's is a very well run chain. I've been to two in Vegas and now this one in Bakersfield and they do a good job training employees and hiring experienced chefs. We came to this location for the first time while in Bakersfield for the week. We had just arrived into town after driving for 5 hours straight so we just wanted FOOD and lots of it, and of course that's what BJ's does best. For an appetizer we had the Queso dip:  -It was not hot. At all. So that was disappointing, but it was really good regardless and we were very hungry lol For our entrees, I had the Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprout Salad:  -Only problem, there were no brussles sprouts! I love brussles sprouts and it's kind of the only reason I ordered that salad. BUT it was soo damn good that I didn't realize there were no brussles sprouts in it until I was almost done. This is honestly the best salad I have ever had. Everything in it just belonged together. A+ My bf had the Deep Dish Ziti:  -He said it was very good. Well, he did his usual food grunt which means ""So good!"". He's not a wordy man... For dessert we had the Salted Caramel Pizookie: -Just the best thing ever. It's like we were silently fighting to eat the last few bits like little god damn savages. That good. Other than the slight errors, we would return in a heart beat! (:"
Trellis G.,"Bakersfield, CA",3,6,,4.0,8/21/2016,Great food and service could work on faster carry out had to wait 1hour for food other wise it was good
Amparito U.,"Ducor, CA",23,17,2,1.0,8/23/2014,Worst place. Everrrrr  Iam.  So mad. At this people. I took my family. For my Daughther  b day. And the service  was the worst. I have ever in counter ... They forgot 2 plates. The waitress forgot some drinking. We  had to keep on stoping other  employees. To help us. I'm never going. To this nasty place again  The one in Downey ca. And Cerritos ca is 10xs better then this one. Even the one in monte bello ca is smaller and wayyyy better
Dre J.,"Beverly Hills, CA",11,9,18,1.0,7/11/2014,"Good food, bad hostess. If give it a 4 for the food but the service got me. The lady up front had an attitude, her name was Simoneel. Very unprofessional for up front representation, front end is the most important part of any service business. A hostess is to host and create the atmosphere you're about to enter. That bitch fucced it up for me. Acting like we in Compton and shit....bitch. Still ate there though. Waited an hour, might as well grub."
Michelle J.,"Bakersfield, CA",8,46,39,4.0,11/21/2015,"We came here with a party of 8 on Wednesday night (11-18-15) for a birthday celebration. I called earlier that day to ask about reservations but they had none available but the manager told me to call about 20-30 mins ahead of time to ask for reserved seating. I called and asked for reserved seating to be told by the girl on the phone that they only do that for parties of 6 or less, I explained that's not what the manager told me so she transferred me to speak with him and he apologized and graciously took my name. We arrived around 6:05 and only waited about 5 mins before being seated. Our waitress was awesome and kept up with our drinks and all the food came out at the same time. Awesome time! Thank you!!"
Victoria H.,"Bakersfield, CA",48,15,1,5.0,9/22/2015,Mostly good experiences here. Love the food. The only complaint I have is the warming of the soup. I order the chili every time and always ask before hand to have it heated up. Either they think it's already hot or they don't communicate. It's frustrating sending it back every time and then getting your food all at the same time. Other than that the service is good and the food tastes great.
Perry F.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,25,,2.0,1/29/2016,Got in fairly quick. ..pray of 12 squeezed into a table for 8 maybe 10.....waited for 50 minutes before we  ate...my burger was cold....steaks and spaghetti were good..overall average but a bit overpriced.....service a bit better tan last time I came here.......probably my last trip...not what I would consider a great restaurant....on par with most chsins...nothing special
Melissa L.,"Tehachapi, CA",1,23,9,3.0,1/9/2015,"It's okay. Not the best! I had black and bleu hamburger. Bun nothing special, blue cheese not melted.  If you want a 'to die for' black and bleu burger go to Bex in Lancaster! Bex has best garlic/Parmesan fries also!"
