Joe G.,"South San Francisco, CA",6,14,1,1.0,5/24/2015,"Multiple times have had problems with food being served cold and tonight ordered a Buffalo Burger and it was served raw and completely cold in the center. Spoke to manager ""Emileo"" about my meal and he didn't seem to care or even surprised. Also, the wait times for the cold food to be served are ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."
Kaley H.,"Bakersfield, CA",28,267,70,3.0,6/1/2015,"First off, I have been here several times and everytime it's the same. Everything about the place is mediocre. It seems the only reason I ever go to BJs is when it's someone elses decision. Last time I went, I was with a party of 8. I had the fish tacos because I had originally order a steak but was later informed that they had ran out. Who runs out of steak at 7pm on a Saturday? The only thing that really stands out is the pizookie; that's a great dessert. The waitresses kept confusing our food with the table behind us when our food came out. They also forgot two of our salads and brought them out after the main course was served. Like I said, except for the pizookie everything else is ordinary...nothing special. Just your typical chain restaurant."
Natalie H.,"Burbank, CA",0,46,18,1.0,3/15/2015,"Got the Fish n Chips with salad instead of fries.  They forgot the salad. When I got it, part of the lettuce had obviously froze. It had that clear look to it. The fish was super greasy and the tartar sauce had way too much pickle in it. It was just all around a lousy meal.  I have had the same exact dinner at BJ's in Woodland Hills and had a completely different experience. All my food was excellent, service was also terrific at that location. I would not recommend the BJ's in Bakersfield at all. Not worth it, but will go to the Woodland Hills location again."
Paul P.,"Pompano Beach, FL",41,411,2592,4.0,6/6/2015,I love this place when in Bakersfield also when I am in South Florida and again when I am in Orlando. It's always very consistent I truly love the atmosphere and the tortilla soup has got to be one of the best I have ever eaten. Their lunch specials are very good and pricing is more than fair.
Lynn U.,"Pismo Beach, CA",58,111,688,2.0,1/11/2014,"This place has made some odd changes lately and I'm beginning to think for all the wrong reasons, I used to think hey let's go to BJ's, never a disappointed meal the last 4 trips there have been weird... This recent one left me in shock! I have to mention the oddest thing happened tonight the waiter informed us as to why the pale ale chili burger is not listed on the menu... They no longer serve it.. Wha-what!? BJ's is a beer and burger type place, right? Or am I wrong? They're known for their piraña pale ale chili right? I mean they'll smother it onto anything you ask for right? Not anymore and I can't believe I forgot to take a pic but they no longer serve giant stuffed potatoes but rather regular size baked potatoes with the tiniest side dish of chili I mean epic tiny I'd say about 1 1/2 tablespoons. Server noted the baked potato came with soup or salad but I could get a cup of chili instead. Glad that was an option, (because after being served a muddy salad last visit I was reluctant to even return) but then They served the potato and though it was enough to fill the gullet it's presentation was strange to me. I get the distinct feeling our location was bought out by someone new and the owner either hired a slew of angry cooks or the owner has no idea what's going on. I have to say despite all that and then some the servers seem very nice. So a second star for them but BJ's as a whole... My desire to visit is dwindling! Get it together B, please!"
K C.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,6,2,1.0,11/2/2015,"Bad customer service. Tried to make a reservation....was placed on hold for 6 minutes. Hung up and called back and was placed on hold another 6 minutes. Hung up and called back and was placed on hold, then the manager ""Baltimore"" picked up and was rude when I told him the complaint of being put on hold for so long each time. Called the corporate office to complain and, of course, was sent to a voicemail. Ended up making reservations elsewhere."
Kristi W.,"Bakersfield, CA",75,2,,1.0,1/25/2015,Waste of my day and left hungry! Waited for 2 1/2 hrs with no drinks and no server in sight received part of our food. When ask to speak to a manager she was not any help as we waited more patiently for our check considering half of our party was children. We made our way to the front of the restaurant. We were chased done as if we were going to skip out on our bill. Completely humiliating ask to speak to the manager again and nothing after standing at the front for another 15 min waiting to pay our bill. Finally done no apologies! Nothing. I have been to this restaurant before and never had a bad experience but because of today I will never return. RUDE RUDE RUDE
Brian A.,"Bakersfield, CA",28,8,2,2.0,8/24/2015,I ordered a martini. I got a very diluted martini. I brought it to their attention thinking it would be handled but my next one was the same way. This is not a good place to come if you are going to order mixed drinks.
Daniel W.,"Portland, OR",18,320,1649,3.0,4/2/2012,"BJ's is not a good value in my opinion.  For some reason every time I leave, I always feel like I paid way too much for what I got.  The beer is fine, the food is fine, the service is usually fine and the atmosphere is fine too.  Sometimes they have lunch specials which are fine too.   Then you get the bill and holy crap, how did that happen?  It's like everything is priced 20% higher than it should be, so when you get the bill, it just feels more expensive than it has to be.   Maybe they should change their name to ""Corporate Expense Accounts R Us""    This is a solid 2.5 stars, 2 was too harsh, and 3 is too generous."
Rdk R.,"Bakersfield, CA",3,41,27,1.0,3/1/2015,"This afternoon my family and I went to BJ's for lunch as we often have for the past 6 years. Sadly it's been our experience to expect long waits after ordering. But the Food is good so we choose to except the long waits. Today we waited for 30 minutes and was served ""Cold"" food. I spoke with our Waitress, she didn't know why I spoke to the server who was Rude and brought just one persons meal and said I don't know where the rest of your order is and promptly walked off. I ask to speak to the Manager who said I will promptly see that you get your meals. We were brought the meals which had been sitting in the Kitchen for 30 minutes. I again asked to speak to the Manager she assured me we would be getting Freshly cooked meals if we would wait and she would cover the cost of the meals. We waited for 15 more minutes No Food ! BJ's truly has lost its ability to care if one group of Four people are served as long as 50% maybe 60% are served. A Free Meal is not worth being treated like that's all that matters and you will shut up and go away.  There are many places to Eat good food served by people who care about you in Bakersfield.  It's time for all of us to demand to be treated with respect and not miss lead by Managers who really just want us to go away. And Free screams to us the customer, Shut Up and Go Away. And telling us we are busy, really we are why you are busy !!  If we wanted to be treated poorly we would order Lunch at the DMV."
Jay D.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,9,,3.0,10/7/2015,A few years ago I would have given this place 5 stars but my last experience really disappointed me. I know it's not the restaurants fault but the waiter was terrible and ignored us for close to a half an hour until we had to bring it to the managers attention and the waiter didn't even apologize nor did our meal get comped or discounted even for sitting there with nothing to drink and couldn't get acknowledged. I will say in a positive note that the food was good after we actually got it.
Anna L.,"Bakersfield, CA",4,21,,1.0,10/6/2015,"Wasn't asked how I'd like my burger cooked, waited 45 min for it to show up (on a Tuesday night) only to have it extremely underdone with no sauce. Drinks ran dry and there was a hair in my cousin's food. If I wasn't there with a party I would have left 20 min into the wait and gone across the lot to panera. Will never go back and will strongly recommend against others visiting as well."
Suzanne Z.,"Bakersfield, CA",67,9,24,1.0,5/29/2015,"I don't know why it's so hard for BJ's to figure it out I'm giving him more than enough chances .. The service is terrible ... It's always somebody else's fault ..nothing is in a timely manner,  it's confusing for them to even think about splitting a bill and when your waitress goes on a break the one that supposed to cover doesn't even show up ...I think this is officially my last visit to BJ's"
Tracy H.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,9,3,1.0,5/15/2016,"We have been coming to this location since it open.  Today was the worst experience we have had at a restaurant in a long time.  There were several mistakes on the order from the drinks , appetizer, the meals .  The service took 3 hours.  The server kept coming up with excuses. She made us feel like it was our fault we ordered a plain burger and it came with cheese and pickles all over it. No compensation was offered by the restaurant.  Needless to say  won't be coming back anytime soon, maybe never.  Time to try something new"
Christine W.,"San Diego, CA",149,10,1,4.0,6/14/2015,The food was good! Our waitress was amazing. We ordered a pizza and salad. The call ahead app was very helpful.
Ric W.,"Arvin, CA",1,3,,3.0,9/11/2015,Food was good. Drinks were strong and tasty. But the customer service left much to be desired. Waitress at the bar area had attitude issues. Intentionally messed up food order and claim it was correct. Drinks took forever to make but they were the most redeeming quality.
Aaron M.,"Indianapolis, IN",78,108,153,4.0,3/29/2014,"Great beer & drinks, good food. Have loved everything I've eaten at BJ's, in fact, except the fish & chips...which are disgusting. I have had them twice. I forgot that I'd had them and they were bad, ordered them again a year later. Oops. Their porter is one of my favorite beer ever :)"
Kenny L.,"Bakersfield, CA",36,87,78,4.0,12/6/2013,"Blonde beer and a french dip is always a great meal while at BJ's Brewhouse. Another strong option is the Jalapeno burger which has a nice kick combined with sweetness of the onions.  Or can always go with one of their many pizza options. BJ's offers both the flat crust and a thick crust pizza which i find best. They never skimp on the toppings on their pizza which is always good.  If you like beers, mixed drinks or even homebrewed root beer this is definetly a place to go!"
Desi Girl 7.,"Bakersfield, CA",62,22,1,3.0,5/22/2016,This location could use some improving. I have eaten here a handful of times and majority of the time I or my friend get sick from their food. They need to work on hygiene!
Matt G.,"Morro Bay, CA",191,19,32,1.0,11/10/2014,"Don't bother making reservations for the beer dinners at BJ's. My fiancé and I had made reservations, supposedly guaranteeing we would have seats. That is a reservation, right? We showed up, and we were told that they were full, unless we were meeting a party there. So...they are holding OUR seats for people who haven't shown up on time. They actually had the balls to ask a seated couple whether they would share their booth with us. The couple said no, but another couple agreed, very graciously, but my fiancé was not comfortable with the arrangement, since it was supposed to be our night out. So, we took our business elsewhere. We're now at Eureka! Burger, where we have never been let down. Goodbye, BJ's! I'll be calling your manager in the morning!"
