Marcus B.,"Bakersfield, CA",11,28,7,4.0,1/4/2015,"First time I've given someone almost 100% tip. Sometimes you've just got to reward good people doing good things. This server went above and beyond to accommodate me and my little one...'No, I thank you BJs!'"
Ebony B.,"Bakersfield, CA",51,96,197,4.0,12/4/2013,"I'm torn between three and four stars. The first time I had BJ's it was in Los Angeles. An event I was at had pizza & pasta catered. The spicy marinara was best spagetti I ever had. Some months later I decided to visit the Bakersfield location. I ordered the same pasta but this time it was only okay. Since then I've tried several different dishes. The chicken parmigiani was amazing! It was so good that I ordered it again a few weeks later, but for take-out. The take-out version was less than impressive. It wasn't cooked the same and it seemed like it was just thrown together quickly.  If you go here, you must try their famous pazooki! The chocolate chip is great. The steak is also great. In short, I've gathered that their food is pretty good but they are inconsistent."
Mery M.,"Shafter, CA",0,34,12,5.0,2/16/2016,great food (pizza and the pizookie are bomb). great drinks (both beer and cocktails). great service. no complaints here! definitely deserves more than 3 stars
Ian S.,"Bakersfield, CA",47,46,7,3.0,2/26/2015,Exceedingly average...  Nothing great but nothing terrible.
Coburn P.,"San Francisco, CA",404,6,,1.0,5/9/2015,I'd like to give zero stars. Came in during the weekend and got seated back in the family section despite being a couple. Sat for 20 minutes without seeing a server. Didn't even get water. Then they waited on a family that came in after us. We walked out.
Gregory M.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,24,6,5.0,10/30/2014,"Bj's is great, ive been there many times, it is a little pricy for some things like mixed drinks, the food is great, the pizzas are amazing, the avacado eggrolls are amazing, i suggest the pulled pork sandwhich , the jalapeno burger is awesome but more sauce and jalapenos needed, maybe was the cook, the pazookies where amazing my wife always enjoys these after a great meal, and the service is always excellent even during a busy fri/sat dinner rush"
T S.,"Pismo Beach, CA",0,8,,3.0,4/7/2016,"My sister and I stopped by BJs for lunch around 1:30. We were seated right away, the place wasn't as busy as it would have been during the lunch rush. We sat there for 15 minutes before we flagged down the hostess that seated us and asked if we could please have some drinks. She took our order then waived at our server to help us. We didn't receive our drinks, so we reordered, this time with our server who acted like she had never heard of an Arnold Palmer and walked away before we ordered out food. When we finally ordered our food I asked for no cucumbers in my salad. The food was brought out by the kitchen staff and appeared nice until I bit into a cucumber!! I had a hard time finding our server again to send it back, but she finally appeared and took the salad back with her to the ""check out"" computer along with the credit cards and dirty dishes from another table and she checked them out before going back to the kitchen to restart my food. My sister was almost finished with her meal before I got a new salad. The food itself was good, the service was terrible!! I normally like this place, but the service is consistently bad. Be prepared to wait if you plan on dining here!"
Elmer T.,"Delano, CA",111,1,,2.0,4/28/2016,"Food was good, and so was the service but only thing is when it came down to paying the bill and i put $60 for the $41 and change bill, the tip had already been deducted from my change without notice! I'm not a happy customer right now. I was going to tip for the gradituity and great service on my own anyways, but I just didn't like that it was taken without my permission."
Kevin R.,"Bakersfield, CA",15,16,9,1.0,10/5/2014,"There are reasons that I prefer to cook at home and this place reinforced all of them. When we get tired of cooking and feel lazy, we go out to eat, only to get worse food, bad service and the realization that we should have stayed home and cook.  Here we go, 10 min to get a drink order, 10 min to get a drink. Food came at a reasonable time, but was wrong. The waitress NEVER asked how our food was and I had to go ask the hostess for catsup. Then the waitress stood over our table waiting for me to sign the bill. Weird!!  So thanks BJ's I won't be coming back a long time. It's kind of pathetic that this place is always packed. On a positive note, they do have gluten free beer!"
Stephanie H.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,5,,3.0,4/5/2016,The food really disappointed me the past couple of times I have come :( so sad because I loved the bison burgers and pizookies but they have both come out either raw or burnt. Very sad to say but me and my boyfriend will not be returning.
Angela M.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,5,3,3.0,3/26/2015,The food was ok but the price for their drinks is rediculous and they are way tooo sweet definitely won't come here again anytime soon
Netza D.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,1,1.0,4/19/2015,"I've had some pretty good previous experiences at this BJ's years before, but today, it all changed. We waited about 45 minutes for our and had plenty of guests who came after us receive their order, finish, pay and leave even before we received our meal. All entrees received were cold and had obvious signs that they had been sitting for good amount of time. The buffalo pizza I ordered was cold and so were the eggs, French toasts, and a lot of the food items were wrong or omitted completely. This is unacceptable, especially for the ""upscale"" price. I won't be coming to this BJ's and I wouldn't recommend anybody to go for the brunch, as they take their time bringing people's food out."
Melissa K.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,12,7,3.0,3/30/2016,"Cool atmosphere and friendly service. Not much of a dessert menu though mainly only ""pazookies"" which come in different flavors but basically they are very large cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top. Beer was ok, I tried a pale ale."
Tabitha M.,"Bakersfield, CA",4,16,3,2.0,2/1/2015,"Slowest service I've EVER experienced. Food's not horrible, but you need to have time to waste."
Domingo G.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/18/2016,I wish I was able to put a review on the food but since my party of 8 have been waiting for 80 minutes and still haven't been seated we decided to leave and it's not even busy. If you have a large party I do not recommend BJ's
Ashlea W.,"Temecula, CA",24,10,5,1.0,8/29/2014,Terrible service. I've been here two times this week and left a terrible tip because the service was horrible. I've had good service here in the past but really? Bj's? Really? The waitress is more interested in smoking and catching a cigarette than assisting us in doing her job. No thanks. Bj's. No thanks.
Ryan E.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/25/2015,I am giving only one star because they removed my favorite item off the menu which is the grilled chicken pasta and the new pasta they replaced it with is terrible. Too chalky and dry. Lacks the zest and taste the grilled chicken pasta had. That was the only reason i ate at bjs and now i have no reason to continue giving them my business.bring back the GCP!!!!!!
Russ C.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",0,10,,2.0,4/17/2015,"Usually I enjoy my experience at BJ's but this location has disappointed me twice now. The first time we waited 10 min ( I started a timer on my watch) before getting our drink order. The second time we were brought the wrong appetizer, the steak, if you could call it that, looked like a ground beef patty and was incredibly over salted. And to top it off both the correct appetizer and the one we didn't order were on the bill. We will not be going to this BJ's again."
Matrisia F.,"Los Angeles, CA",116,6,,1.0,5/29/2014,Came here for a meal after Graduation. There was a long wait -- understandable given the graduation season.  What I don't understand is when BJs went downhill. I've been a fan of the restaurant since 2006 and tonight was my worst experience. The staff seemed like they didn't want to be there. The waiter never cracked a smile. The food was blah.We all ordered burgers... should of just gone to Carl's jr.
Ken Z.,"Bakersfield, CA",13,119,48,1.0,9/12/2012,"I use to come here quite often a few years back and this place use to be great, but not anymore.  The last few time I've dined here it's just been a complete hit or miss.  I just want some consistency and this place is good or bad, unfortunately more bad than good.  I've noticed that with this place if you get a male server the service and dining experience is GREAT! But when you get a female server it just goes downhill from there.  The girls are rude, don't refill your drinks, and stand around talking about their favorite t.v shows.  I don't mind that they takes breaks and all, I'm for that but when you see them talking in circles and repeatedly passing your table while we're down to the ice c'mon.  Again, the male servers are great you can see them hustle, but once you sit down and you get Buffy the vampire slayer, just get up and leave."
