Alan M.,"Bakersfield, CA",39,90,22,4.0,9/30/2012,OK #1 - They have the best coffee in Bakersfield as far as chain restaurants go. #2 - They have a great breakfast on the weekends #3 - Got some great low calorie options are are always willing to modify something for you if you need it. #4 - Service is always pretty good. I'm a fan for sure.
Tabby N.,"Coalinga, CA",1,5,,3.0,7/11/2014,"This is the worst BJs I have ever been to. My HUNNY and I drove 2 1/2 hours to visit some family, and enjoy a nice summer evening. I unfortunately picked the wrong restaurant! The hostess Simoneel, was very rude. I got a condescending attitude, sassiness and laughing in my face. Very inappropriate for this business, and horrible to see these type of employees employed at well known restaurants. I will not be back to this restaurant. I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars because of the rudeness from the employee Simoneel. The food was a 5 though."
Kenzie B.,"Bakersfield, CA",8,58,,4.0,7/23/2014,"I like BJs because there is a large variety of food and drinks, so everyone in your party can be happy! Pizza is good, sandwiches are good, pasta is good! Great lunch specials."
Gwenyth F.,"Bakersfield, CA",55,41,16,4.0,6/27/2014,"BJ's is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants. I love the food, the service (usually), and the atmosphere. But the wait time can be atrocious.  As for the food, for the appetizer I like the Santa Fe Rolls and the mozzarella sticks, but I recommend the appetizer platter too.  I will say that the mozzarella sticks aren't as good as they used to be. For the entrees, the best ones are the pastas, the Southwest chicken salad, and the pizzas. My favorite deep dish is the classic, pepperoni, but the pizza is expensive. My sister, who has celiac disease, can't eat wheat, so this is one of the few places that serves pizza she can eat. For dessert, order a Pizzookie. The best ones are the salted caramel, white chocolate chunk, and the best one: chocolate chip. I went to BJ's last night with my friend and her mom. Her birthday is tomorrow, so we asked if we could get a Pizzookie. Our waitress was very nice and brought out one. Turns out, they were out of the mini they usually give, so we got a bigger one for free. We looked behind us, and the table behind us had an ENORMOUS Pizzookie. It was the biggest Pizzookie on the menu. It was the size of a extra large pizza with four different sections of different flavors and 8 scoops of ice cream. It cost $20, but it would've been worth it for a group. It's officially on my bucket list.  I love BJ's, but I recommend going to it on a weekday, because it gets extremely crowded."
Gary W.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/29/2015,"Food was good but the service was terrible. From the time we were seated, it took them about an hour to get our food to the table. Other guests seated near us seemed to be in the same boat. Don't think I'll be back."
Christopher P.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,,2.0,1/17/2015,"TL:DR Decent food, mixed drinks, poor service Visited Here for my sister's birthday dinner. I hadn't been for about 2 years but remember loving the place back in my high school and college years.  The Wait was kind of long due to school formals, but my sister scheduled ahead of time so we were seated almost immediately.  For beverages, I ordered BJ's root beer, which is something I always look forward to when coming. My sister and my dad both ordered beers, but my sister's Porter arrived warm, despite being served in a cold glass. The waiter took it away and came back with beer that was slightly colder but still not ideal. My little sister and I both ordered BJ's deep dish pizza, which is always great thanks to a unique, if slightly polarizing crust and generous seasoned tomatoes. Dad ordered a deep dish lasagna, and while he thought it was good, he said that it was not better than grocery store lasagna. Not a ringing endorsement. My mom ordered salmon, which was pretty good. My sister ordered a bacon cheeseburger, but was dismayed by the lack of condiments both on the burger and the table, as well as the slightly soggy bread. Just before the meal, we had asked for water refills. However, our replacement waiter did not return with our drinks promptly. It wasn't until the middle of the meal when we got the water. At one point, we attempted to flag down another waiter, but to little avail. Of course, when visiting BJ's you just gotta order their famous Pizookies. They're Always a five-star dessert in my book, and they did help save the meal. However, the bill came in with an extra Porter and Pizookies, even though my sister supposedly got a free Pizookie and used a coupon for another one. These mistakes were corrected, but should not have been made. We also discovered a used napkin user the tables which was an unclean end to the visit. I hate to give a favorite such a low rating, but tonight's experience had issues that were hard to ignore."
James H.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,18,,2.0,3/6/2014,"I do not drink,  but when I do, which is very very rare, I get super drunk, loud, rude, obnoxious,sexual, and totally out of line..   I told a friend of mine, one night let's go to ''BJ's and let Me get plastered..because if I'm drunk and the name ''BJ's'' is the name of the place, I probably will make LOUD rude tasteless jokes on the name ''BJ's''  especially if there's a bunch of young rude female staff.       I think some of you know where I'm going with this..hehehe"
Chandler D.,"Bakersfield, CA",2,34,8,2.0,9/12/2015,"Yikes. This used to be my go-to spot for some food and drinks but it seems like each time I've gone has gotten worse and worse. This last time was just ridiculous. Waitress seemed very absent-minded and didn't have the greatest attitude. We ordered the 2 for $25 deal which comes with 2 salads, a pizza, and a pizookie. First, she forgot to ask what salads we wanted, and when she came back to ask, ten minutes later, she also had to double check what pizza we wanted.... meaning that whole time had passed without her putting in our order.... we had a group join us for drinks and immediately asked for separate checks which she said she couldn't do until the end because the system didn't let her.... what? There was only six of us...? Anyway, we finally got our pizza which didn't seem like too long of a wait. We drank for a few hours and the waitress was semi attentive but seemed to care more about talking to her friends. She was reallllllly laggy on getting our drinks towards the end. Then the best part, out of nowhere brings our check out. Ummm???? Who said we were done? We were waiting for another round? And when I asked her about our pizookie that comes with the dinner she says ""oh... yeah... what kind.."" in a super annoyed tone like she was seriously hoping I'd forget and just get out of her hair. Um yeah no.... I get Friday nights are hectic but if you can't slap a smile on your face for a few hours and provide halfway decent service, waitressing isn't the place for you. Overall, it took at least an hour to pay our tab without our waitress in sight. Only giving two stars for the beer and some of the food."
Vanessa C.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,7,,1.0,2/10/2014,"So disappointed in this establishment!  I took my high school students (with moderate/severe disabilities) here for lunch for a special treat. My students were so excited, and literally none of them had ever been there before!  Imagine my disappointment when we walked in and were greeted with sour looks and ""can I help you with something""!! Like we had just wandered in by mistake! The restaurant literally stands alone, so we had to be there to eat lunch! This is after we witnessed the happy smiles and ""how many in your party"" greetings given to the other patrons! My students are disabled but they KNOW when someone is treating them poorly/differently than they are treating others (in this case other customers).  When we finally got a table (in the back room of course) it wasn't big enough, so three of us sat at a table right next to the bigger table. The waitress came over and told us that we could not sit there! I asked her where we were supposed to sit because there wasn't any room and she said she had to ask her manager if it was okay. There were six other empty tables in our area (that remained empty the entire time we ate), so it wasn't like they needed that table!  If it had been just me I would have walked out, but I couldn't do that to the kids. We stayed and ate, but I won't go there again.  Any place that treats patrons with disabilities with disdain in a no go for me!"
Robert R.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/19/2015,Called BJ'S to make a reservation for my daughters birthday party.  Was told I needed to speak to a manager and one would call me back.  After several hours my wife called back to try to make the reservation and was put on hold for a manager.  The phone was picked with someone who she believed to be the manager and the staff confirmed her reservation and said she was all set  for Monday night at 530 pm for a party of 17.  A short time later I received a phone  call from Chris a manager at BJ'S who said my reservation was not available and he had no availability till 830 pm. He said only managers could make reservations and that he did not.  He was not accommodating and expressed that his staff would not do that cause it was against company policy.  What poor customer service and disappointment to me and my daughters birthday party especially since I had told her after being told by a so called manager that the party wad a go.
Cayli F.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,32,40,5.0,8/20/2014,I have to say that the waiters and waitresses are very attentive here and friendly. I love their beer selection. And appetizers. Also their pizza. Maybe not everything will be you favorite in the menu. But beer and pizza is highly recommended!
Yen N.,"San Jose, CA",95,108,3,2.0,12/18/2012,"I'm not a big fan of beer,so I will not rate the brewery, but I'm not that impressed with BJ's as a restaurant. I believe they are famous for their deep dish pizza, and my boyfriend raves about the bbq chicken pizza. I'm just not amazed. Their pizza seems like just a jazzed up version of the pizza you order. If you want real gourmet pizza, try Pizza Antica (it costs about the same).  What I do like is the ahi poke and tomato bisque soup. Service is also good. However, much else is just average American dining. Definitely worse than Cheesecake Factory, and Cheesecake is pretty much ""average"" to me."
Cobey C.,"Studio City, CA",7,37,5,5.0,7/13/2014,"Had the jalapeño burger with the veggie patty and the crispy fries. Megan got the spaghetti with marinara. Both were very good. BJ's seems to be the rare restaurant that actually accomplishes ""jack of all trades, master of all"". There's something for everyone here. Lots of cool drinks too."
Patrick H.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,7,,2.0,2/15/2014,"I go to BJ's from time to time and am too often disappointed with the service. Today, items were left off my wife's entree and the kitchen failed to put dressing on my salad.  It took at least 5 minutes for the server to bring me some dressing once I was able to find him. He had a habit of disappearing and we were generally ignored throughout our meal even though it was not busy.  BJ's is beautiful restaurant but I think it is poorly managed. I'll spend my money elsewhere."
Neal J.,"Avila Beach, CA",0,2,,2.0,11/13/2015,The worst Restaraunt service in Bakersfield. This our third visit to BJ 's and nothing has changed. Showed up at 5:20 and told it would be 20 minutes for a table. We were finally seated 45 minutes later. It took 15 minutes to place an order and now it's 6:40 and we're still waiting for the food. We'll let you know if we eat before midnight. NEVER DINING AT THIS PLACE AGAIN! It is a joke.
Joshua P.,"Yucaipa, CA",7,1,,1.0,12/23/2013,Stood in front of the hostess and was completely ignored. Bad service.
Juliet G.,"Northridge, CA",0,23,16,1.0,1/6/2014,"THEY HAVE THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE! Went here last night with my sister around 10:30pm. We walked in and seated ourselves just as two guys walking in right in front of us had done as well. After waiting a while, I noticed that the guys who came in before us were given menus by a waiter.  That same waiter and a couple of others walked right passed our table numerous times completely ignoring us.  My sister had to call across to one of the waiters to ask for menus. When he brought some back to us, she thanked him for doing so and he didn't even acknowledge what she'd just said.  After all that we got up and left. I will never return to this BJS.  They're rude and must have something against people like me. I hate when I see waiters serving others while ignoring some especially when it's not crowded whatsoever. They need to hire new staff ASAP."
Rated D.,"Taft, CA",0,13,7,4.0,7/16/2013,"Great place to eat.  Good service and pretty damn good grub.  Salmon in great, burgers are tasty and beer is crazy good.  Clean, professional environment...if you have never been to a BJ's before, it's well worth it...enjoy"
Angelina D.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,7,5,4.0,6/29/2015,"My boyfriend and I went for lunch today, we ordered the stuffed mushrooms and Chile verde fries as our appetizers and the mushrooms were really good but the Chile verde on the fries tasted like they popped open a jar and put it in the microwave. We shared a large pizza 1/2 was bbq spicy chicken and 1/2 garlic alfredo I think, but they were stingy on the bbq sauce and the alfredo sauce. The bbq pizza was good but the alfredo pizza was really bland and not enough mushrooms. The pizookies are always amazing. We had a great server, but some of their food does taste bland but overall good place to eat."
Gabriel G.,"Bakersfield, CA",2,16,8,1.0,7/28/2015,"Let me start by saying this is NOT a review of just 1 visit.  This review comes after 6 separate visits to this establishment.  The one star review comes strictly on the customer service or lack there of.  Every single time I have been to BJ's it has been the same lack luster, dry, non attentive service.  Waiting to be seated is never a problem for me, if a restaurant is busy that is understandable, but once you are seated and have to wait yet another 30 minutes to even get a glass of water is preposterous. 6 times and the same experience, how do I know it was 6? because I count every horrible experience and never forget, but my friends like to eat and drink here, and can't blame them the food is really good, but I would rather eat by myself at PF changs next door then have to sit around and not be waited on.  If servers can't do a simple task of acknowledging when patrons are out of water or have a sense of what tables have been missed, then either get new servers or management has to do a better job of training."
