Joel W.,"Austin, TX",237,160,288,3.0,6/9/2010,"This BJ's is LOUD! I hope your ok talking very loudly to talk to the person sitting next to you, but the food is good. The food is good like every other BJ's, but this is the largest one I have been to. I will say here in this review that BJ's, no matter where has one of my all time favorite french dip sandwiches. I am sure there are better out there, and I want to know where. Please tell me!"
Kimball H.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,10,,5.0,9/18/2014,I walked straight in to a table.  There is the Thursday night NFL on multiple screens.  Lively music.  Attentive waiter.  Affordable entrees.  So far so good! Excellent food and service.
Bella C.,"Bakersfield, CA",8,26,2,5.0,11/22/2012,You have no idea how many times the restaurant hrs have saved me! Lol Bomb Pizza!
Mimi J.,"Bakersfield, CA",774,1295,3576,3.0,9/4/2011,"If I were to review BJ's strictly on the avocado egg rolls, deep dish pizza, and Pizookie, it would rate 4 1/2 stars.   Unfortunately, this review is for their entire menu, and while I've never had anything here that tasted bad there just isn't anything special about the rest of the entrees that would deserve the 4th star. I have found the hostesses, waiters, and bartenders to be very enjoyable. They have smiled, joked with us, and generally had a good attitude and pleasant demeanor. No complaints here. The decor and atmosphere is that of an overgrown sports bar, but it is clean and well-lit so no complaints here, either. I have sampled the Jambalaya, the Lettuce Wraps,  and the Santa Fe Chicken Salad and there was absolutely nothing WRONG with them. They just did not measure up to the level I have come to expect from the pizza. They are standard bar fare and nothing more. But the pizza - oh the pizza. Deep dish crust - crispy on the outside but substantial and not overly starchy... served tableside right in the pan to keep it at the perfect temperature right up until you are ready to eat it.... Perfection. The sauce to crust ratio maintains the perfect balance and the toppings add to the experience rather than detract from it.   If this place were called ""BJ's Pizza"" I'd seriously be considering giving it that 4th and 5th star.  But - alas - it's not. The Avocado Egg Rolls have been consistently good (as I have been consistent in ordering them). The outside crust/wrapping is crisp and flaky and the insides creamy avocado-y goodness.  I could take or leave the dipping sauce. I'll dip about half of my egg rolls in them and eat half without. I think it is the combination of the creaminess of the centers and the flakiness of the crust that makes these things so good. They earn 5 STARS on their own. I am a big Pizooki fan. The Pizookie earn 4 stars as an after dinner dessert (I'm usually too full from the rest of the meal to truly enjoy them). If eaten by itself, it could rise to a 4 1/2 to a 5. So, in conclusion, for a 4-5 star experience, come to BJ's for the Avocado Egg Roll, Deep Dish Pizza, and Pizookie. You'll be so wrapped up in the food experience you won't even notice that most of the other customers are the overgrown Community College version of Frat Boys and Sorority Girls dressed to ""hook up"". Bro-Central.  Or shall we say the Jersey Shore crowd? PS - They have a pretty good selection of micro-brew beers!"
Nico F.,"Riverside, CA",0,170,7,3.0,4/22/2014,The place has great atmosphere. TV's everywhere. We sat within 10 minutes on a Friday night at 6. Waited for a Beer for about 10 minutes then waiter showed up and said they were out. Don't have it in your menu if your out. Food took forever to arrive. Had the Avocado rolls which were amazing. The pizza was okay.  Service wasn't great wasn't horrible.
Robert K.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",106,204,36,1.0,8/20/2011,"This joint is the top of the charts for ""BROTASTIC"". It looks like the 909 moved into the building. Lazy ass waiters to concerned about texting then taking orders. Why people eat here is beyond me. I guess if your a collage tard looking to get laid this is the joint for you.  You won't find me here again."
Tisha F.,"Temecula, CA",0,3,,5.0,7/5/2015,"My favorite place to eat in Bakersfield!!! Atmosphere is great, waiters always nice and friendly, service is prompt, n drinks are made well!!! Been going there for years and it's one of the best places to host large scale parties!"
Michele W.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,1,,4.0,8/29/2014,"Service was excellent. The food came out cold, but everyone did everything to make it better! Great experience. Loved our server!!!!"
Filipe R.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/19/2015,"Ok so I went here on May 29th to take my girlfriend and her friend out to eat. I heard it was good, and both of them had it and enjoy it. I call 20 minutes advance with that I was able to get my table as soon as I walk in so points to you BJ. Our waiter came and took drinks as well as our dishes, very limit menu and nothing amazing standing out. Once the waiter gave us our drink, she totally disappeared on us for the rest of the night. The worst part of this my friend was got a drink with no ice at all. Sitting there we waited for a the waiter to come back so we can have it fixed, but like I said disappeared just vanish. Lucky while another waiter came to refilled my drink, she was able to replace my friends drink as well. Situation was solved, and I was pleased until I notice how long our food was taking. Me thinking it was just a busy day because it seemed pack was fine with it until I notice 3 table to the left side of us came in after us and got there meal before us. There I stopped a waiter and explained our waiter vanish without giving us our food. More time pass by were the 3 tables all left and were placed with new people. Shortly after that it looked like a chef actually come out and gave us our food. My friends finishing all of her drink asked for another one with a rude manner, which I apologize for her actions for we were all hungry and frustrated. While the drink was getting replaced, I notice my burger I order adding pulled pork was missing the patty! The entire patty was gone! The chef came back out with a not so pleasant face, and I felt bad to ask for him to fix it right after my friend gave him attitude. Sucking it up and eating the burger I then notice that the pulled pork was dry and had no sauce, yet after sitting there for about 2 hours I was to hungry to even complain. I got the closest waiter to bring me my bill and payed and left a five dollar tip. Who ever got that tipped got to much for the awful experience. Those 4 waiters that help us each about once or twice can spilt it up for all I care. I refuse to go back now after ruining a simply dinner for my partner birthday and her friend."
Travis v.,"Oildale, CA",6,31,1,1.0,6/23/2011,"Absolutely despise this place.  It's always an afterthought and consistently 4th or 5th choice on the where should we eat list. Staff is always rude, lazy or brain-dead.  I'm not faulting the servers because their attitude is a reflection of their management. BJ's please change your pitch up!"
Krista R.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/1/2015,"WORST service ever! I have been here for multiple birthdays, the last one over 3 years ago for this very reason. Waiting in 100 degree for OVER 2 hours for a table; not even offering water to those outside. It's absolutely ridiculous to tell someone you have a 30 minute wait and keep extending it. This is the LAST time Me and my family will eat at this location. You should retrain this location professionalism and customer service. Instead of having 5 people standing around chit chatting at the entrance, maybe you should have them bus tables and serve food for faster service."
Richard G.,"Bakersfield, CA",36,127,590,4.0,10/19/2011,"I went here with about seven other friends on a Sunday night. We were seated pretty quickly at a big booth. The waitress gave us menus and brought us waters. My friends got margaritas and some other drink. Everyone enjoyed their drinks. However it did take a while to get the drinks. I got a California burger with fries which was very tasty. Their octoberfest beer is really good way better than their blonde beer. Only knocking off a star for the slow service. The pasta, pizookie, and pizzas are all very good."
Isaac D.,"Bakersfield, CA",35,7,3,4.0,5/3/2012,It has never let me down when it comes to the food. Service is usually great. I suggest you try the asian dishes.
Jay Infamous L.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",150,493,35,4.0,6/12/2012,"Was here recently on vacation and was pleased with everything here...nice restaurant, pleasure decor and the food and drinks were AWESOME...Had a pomegranate frozen margarita, flatbread pizza for an appetizer and jambalaya for lunch...All 3 were pretty good.  Ummm...yeah that's about it. lol"
Della R.,"Mililani, HI",57,7,24,1.0,5/22/2013,"Where to start?  I came down from Hawaii (05-11-13)  wanting to have a good dinner/drink/dessert w/my best friends. I was told over the phone it would be a 1hr wait but when i showed up it got bumped up to a 2 hour wait. After about 30 mins there were a lot of free tables and still no buzz so we decided to sit ourselves. 15 mins later we get a waiter saying he'll sit us in a bigger table shortly. So we finally get seated and this is about 1 hour after we arrive. A hostess comes up to our table, doesn't say a word and starts handing each of us a menu. Finally she says ""your waitress will be with you shortly"" as she walks away...  We then meet our waitress who has permanent BITCH FACE. She takes our drink order and 1 dinner order. She disappears for about 30 mins. I even suggested to just skip out on our bill and leave because of the crappy service but we decided to stay. My friend decides to tell a waiter that she hasn't came back. That waiter comes back with our drinks. BITCH face finally decides to come back and take the rest of our dinner orders. 45 mins later we start to get our food. We all got our food except my friend who ordered her dinner WAY back when we ordered our first round of drinks. She tells the waitress that she didn't receive her food  and the waitress calls out the wrong order. My friend had to remind her of what she ordered. She doesn't admit to not punching in her order but we all knew she did. At this point we're pissed. She comes back with a super hot plate which mostly likely means it got either A. Microwaved or B. thrown in the oven to reheat it. The noodles where as good as a 25 cent pack of Ramon noodles. Completely tasteless. My friend had to ask a random waiter for a bottle of Tapatillo sauce because our ""waitress"" had gone on break. He doesn't come back w/tapatillo but he did have a chalula bottle. Everyone leaves more than half of their dinner because it was downright shitty. I didn't even want desert because the whole experience was just plain SHIT. Only good thing out of the night was that my friend who complained about her food didn't have to pay. Oh and BTW the Margaritas were SALTY as fk AND the FLOOR IS OVERLY WAXED! Some ones is going to fall and SUE!!!!"
Rebecca B.,"Fullerton, CA",0,11,,2.0,9/10/2013,"I've always been neutral towards BJ's. I feel like this restaurant is very overrated. However, my friends and I gave it another chance last week and what a bad idea that was. Their service is AWFUL. Our server practically neglected us and the food was mediocre. Go elsewhere."
Doc S.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,12,,4.0,12/21/2012,"One of my favorite spots for lunch.  Positives: I love the food, great menu, they have a new line of beer other than their terrible house made brews. (try a Boddingtons Beer...smooth). The atmosphere is great, huge t.v. over the bar. Clean bathrooms are always a plus. Negatives: The service might be the slowest in town. Make sure you have dinner reservations because it will be a very long wait. Bar tenders have poor attitudes and like to mess up orders."
Gregory G.,"Bakersfield, CA",10,11,,4.0,3/31/2014,This place has a reputation for bad service. I will admit I have been on the receiving end of it. It has been getting a lot better and the French roast beef dip sandwich almost makes it worth it
Andrew H.,"Bakersfield, CA",36,16,12,5.0,10/29/2013,"I actually walked in 20 minutes before closing and placed a to go order. They were totally cool about it, gave me a soda while I was waiting. Food was out quick, they saved me on a night I didn't feel like cooking. My server was super friendly. Food was awesome."
Ryan R.,"Bakersfield, CA",4,19,26,5.0,12/26/2013,Great service and loved the boneless wings with Maui sauce and the beef sliders ! Yummy!!!
