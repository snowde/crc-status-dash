Amy G.,"Bakersfield, CA",117,205,15,3.0,4/20/2013,"The food is predictably good, but most items aren't exceptional. They have a lot of seating, but there will still be a very long wait on game nights or weekends. Recently it has appeared as though they are consistently short staffed. The poor wait staff seems stretched very thin with tables all over the building. This means don't have too high of hopes on refilled drinks or fast service and response times. However, it is a nice place for a large group to meet or to watch a sporting event as you can see at least one tv from any seat in the restaurant."
Randy N.,"Yucaipa, CA",3,6,1,2.0,7/11/2014,food is bomb. greeter ms. simoneel was extremely rude. snapped her finger at us and twerked her neck. she aint shanaynay.
Benny J.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,1,,5.0,5/6/2012,"We are from Virginia, here visiting family and trying restaurants that we don't have back home. Beautiful restaurant. After a bad experience recently at another local restaurant (The Elephant Bar), I was desperately looking for a place to enjoy a good meal. I had six slices of BJ's Favorite pizza and my wife had a BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad. The food was excellent, and our waitress (Molly) was the best. Thanks again for your wonderful service. I also tried the beer...a Jeremiah Red and a Hopstorm IPA. Pretty good. I got 2 bottles of the Jeremiah Red to go."
Daniel O.,"Minnetonka, MN",185,46,9,3.0,10/3/2011,"I might try this place again but I had the Jambalaya and it was okay. It was shown in the menu and looked like one of their premiere dishes but I wasn't too impressed. I like that they do a lot of varieties which is great but I don't know if I liked the food and that's what I care about the most. I can be in the nicest restaurant and if the food is bad the review is bad.  Pros: Large, lots of TV's, service, vast array of menu items Cons: Pricing a little to high for quality, Jambalaya :( Overall I think it's a good place to hang with friends and grab a beer, but if I'm going to eat somewhere I like, you'll find me in a sushi bar :)"
Shelby H.,"Bakersfield, CA",51,15,3,4.0,10/18/2011,Everything on the menu is incredible! Excellent service. Love all the TV's for sports and beer selection. Can't go wrong with BJ's !
Nikki M.,"Bakersfield, CA",51,297,278,1.0,5/22/2013,"Came here on Sunday for my grandfather's birthday. We got here around 11am so it wasn't very busy at all. At first the waitress seemed on the ball, but that quickly faded. We had to ask for all of our refills. My brother ordered a pan pizza and they brought out one that clearly was not pan crust. He asked about it and inquired as to whether or not they simply changed their recipe. He was told that the oven wasn't working so they didn't have pan pizzas. Clearly this is something he should have been told when he ordered. He kept the pizza since he was hungry. After biting into it he realized there was no pizza sauce. Seriously, no sauce on a pizza??? I had the creole tilapia. The fish and rice were good. My only complaint was that my salad had no dressing. The menu said it had a vinegarette and the waitress also mentioned this, yet there was none. Overall it was a bad experience. Honestly I can't think of a good experience I've really had here. I only go when someone chooses it for their birthday. Not sure why anyone would do this, but it does happen. I would never go here by choice."
Sundai L.,"Bakersfield, CA",415,77,359,5.0,9/2/2011,Dont understand the low ratings? This place is pretty great. Pazookie! Great spaghetti & meetballs great beer great pizza great appetizers.

Albert K.,"Bakersfield, CA",253,484,170,4.0,6/7/2013,"I was just here last saturday evening with a group of friends.  When we walked in, we were going to sit in the dining area until the hostess told us that there was happy hour in the bar area.  We walked to the bar area and sat in a booth.  Before we sat down, the table had not been cleaned and I just said lets sit down and they will clean the table. As soon as we sat down, the waiter came by and told us that the table will be cleaned. The table was cleaned couple mins after. The waiter came by again and asked us what we wanted to drinkFor happy hour, their craft beer is 5.25 for regular price, but for happy hour is 4.00. The pitcher price was 15.00. I ended up getting 2 pitchers and few appetizers. Some of the appetizers we got were California Club Flatbread pizza, Thai Shrimp lettuce wraps, and Avocado Egg roll. The California Club flatbread pizza was ok, it was not that great.  Not to much flavor and the taste was kind of bland. The Thai Shrimp lettuce wraps was actually delicious.  It had cajun style shrimp and it was kind of spicy.  The lettuce makes it even more great with the sauce on top.  The Avocado Egg roll was not bad at all too.  The avocado and egg together wrapped made it great.  The sauce that compliments the avocado egg roll is the best. The waiter was great and always attended to us to see how we were doing. They have lots of parking."
Marie S.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,24,2,4.0,1/13/2014,Martinis and appetizers with the girls from work before returning from break. Food took very long but server did great and knew just what to recommend.
Michelle W.,"Lake Isabella, CA",35,11,7,3.0,7/23/2014,"Food is excellent, don't get me wrong. We come here quite often, and always start with the Santa Fe or avocado rolls as an appetizer, which are both  to die for. My go to meal is usually the California chicken sandwich, which I always take half home to enjoy for lunch the next day. The kids are big on the bbq chicken ranch pizza and the burgers. Quite simply, we've never had a less than stellar meal here. My complaint lies with the service for this review. Most of the time, it's great and we usually have just one server. This last week it was downright confusing. Our server took our order and we never saw or heard from her again. Didn't tell us she was heading to a break (possibly lunch?), just disappeared. A runner delivered our food and  after awhile, I think the busboy, or maybe even dishwasher, took over. He refilled our drinks, pulled our empty dishes, asked if we wanted dessert, and printed our check. I asked if he would be getting the tip since he took over for our server, and was sad to learn that he would not. I'm always a very generous tipper, but I had to draw the line here. I couldn't see tipping someone well who basically greeted us as a hostess would, and then nothing. I still love you BJ's. I guess we've just been spoiled by the awesome service that we've always gotten from the waiters."
chris c.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/8/2014,Been 5 years since the last visit. Ordered a beer it took 30 min to get it.  No apology Ordered my food got the wrong order  no apology. The atmosphere and food are good but the attitudes of staff an management take away the plus of the place correct this an you won't see the low star rating that this nice looking restaurant gets
Tim P.,"South Kensington, London, United Kingdom",173,175,30,4.0,1/5/2011,"One word: pizookie! For those that do not know, a pizookie is a cookie cooked in a pizza pan with ice cream on top. The pizookies are slightly undercooked so they are warm and gooey and all kinds of goodness. BJ's also has some great beers on tap with lots of TVs--so, hit them up for happy hour!"
John L.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,1,,2.0,3/7/2015,The appetizer and salad had no flavor at all. Not a good experience tonight. Only thing they got right was the Jeremy Red.
Samantha C.,"Shafter, CA",0,10,,1.0,3/1/2015,I love this place! Love the food! One male waiter has ruined it for me twice now. Same guy. Rude and has huge attitude. Threw a box at me when asked for it. He is always there on Sunday when I am craving their pizza. I refuse to go back. Might get him a third time.
Caitlyn D.,"Los Angeles, CA",88,118,1,3.0,10/20/2010,Love everything on their menu! They could be a little better with staffing in their higher peaked hours and weekends. Every beer they brew is absolutely amazing! Their seasonals are great and pair well with their food! Love the Pazooki! I am hooked on it. Long wait time though and not efficient with pushing things through. Some of the host girls are a little on the rude side when checking in on your wait time. Waitress seemed a little overwhelmed... meaning staffing was under what it should be to have better customer service. A for food but C for everything else. Same experience at this location every time!
Patricia L.,"Bakersfield, CA",12,58,12,2.0,1/20/2013,"So I ordered curbside/take out on a Sunday night.  My order was the top sirloin, avocado egg rolls and a caesar salad.  The steak was supposed to be well done but was dry and overcooked.  It was bone dry and not flavorful AT ALL.  After having to go inside to the takeout window to get my order because no server ever came out to curbside, I realized they forgot my caesar salad and had to return.  The avocado egg rolls though.... AMAZINGLY good and huge! They made up for the trouble and the bad steak. I would definitely recommend trying that appetizer.  It was really good.  However, overall, I have to give them two stars.  After all that was just the appetizer.  Maybe I'd feel different if the entree was amazing and the appetizer sucked."
John T.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,12,,5.0,9/29/2012,"This is by far the best restaurant in Bakersfield. Food, service, ambiance, all of it. And I have eaten at every place in Bakersfield; believe it. I CHALLENGE you to find me a good place to eat in Bakersfield. Even the places that are ""ok"" in other towns, like the Elephant Bar or Famous Dave's, completely SUCK when they come to Bakersfield. But this place is the one. If you hear anything I say, hear this: it does not get any better than B.J's. I will not try a weak attempt at boring you with what I had and why it was good. See for yourself. A hint.....the double brewhouse B.J. burger. I've had it five times. That is not an exaggeration. If the cook at B.J's is reading this......THANK YOU."
Neya R.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,7,2,1.0,3/23/2014,Very disappointed in the service! Took 20 min for my drink to get to my table! Couldn't find my waiter half the time
Mike P.,"Bakersfield, CA",2,18,1,3.0,2/9/2013,Been here several times. The food and drinks are always good but the service is hit and miss. We've heard servers arguing before to walking out because nobody took our drink order in 10 mins in a half empty place. Kind've a crap shoot this place.
Jennifer P.,"Bakersfield, CA",4,9,3,5.0,3/30/2013,This is our favorite restaurant. We always sit in the bar for quick friendly service. Pizza is good but I usually just order from their lunch menu.
