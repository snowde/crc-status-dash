Christy M.,"Orange County, CA",0,53,,4.0,5/26/2011,"I like the atmosphere and the food is consistently good.  It's a chain restaurant people. Do you expect ""fine dining"" and a $100,000 per year chef quality  food?  Give them a break. It's always good and always fresh. Their pazookies aren't very good, I will say that."
Brooke W.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,10,,2.0,9/10/2013,"The food here is average. Not bad but not exactly great. The pizza is good, nice thick crust and fresh toppings but it is also quite pricey. I would rate this place better if it wasn't for the horrible service. The last few times I've been the service has been absolutely horrible. Drinks don't get refilled, your food takes forever, no one checks up on you to see if you need anything. Also, they wont split a tab more than four ways if you have a group of 8 or more, which gets frustrating when you have a large group and everyone is paying separately, but I'm not knocking them for that. When it first opened the place was much better but now its just average food with poor service. I only come here now if someone is really set on it."
Maria H.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,10,10,4.0,8/23/2013,"Came here a little after 3 on a weekday...glad we did because it was super dead! However, lunch hour ends at three, so if you want better prices make it before three. For starters we ordered avocado egg rolls...delicious! They were perfectly filled with just the right amount of everything in them. I just wish they would come with more in one order for about ten dollars you only get 3 egg rolls, they are cut up in halves so it looks like more but it's not. I ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo. You have the choice of grilled chicken or blackened chicken. I chose to go for the blackened one.....bad idea. The chicken just tasted like it was seasoned with chili powder and paprika, it was not charred more as I was expecting. Overall it just didn't go with Alfredo and pasta, I recommend going with just the grilled chicken. We also ordered steak and a huge baked potato both were just as tasty, but that potato was reallllly good. And lastly we ordered a small Mediterranean pizza, super loaded with a bunch of toppings I may not know the names of but it was good. I think it would have been better without all thirty pepperoncinis sprinkled on top. No dessert, we were too stuffed but the pizookies are very good."
LJ M.,"Bakersfield, CA",322,172,439,4.0,11/5/2007,"Ellie G hits the nail on the head: ""half barflies and half family."" BJ's is loud and crowded with the groups of sports fans, young couples sporting formal attire, and large families eating without regard to price (which is up there).  The beer choices, cider, and wine list is amazing- I've never seen anything like it, even at Gordon Biersch in San Jose. When my husband and I went, the place was PACKED.  The front hostesses, although they happened to be long-lost friends, were relatively ditzy and took awhile to give us our ""little vibrating thingie"" (you know what I'm talking about, don't you?).  Once again, an old high school buddy took us to our table, which was a private, nice booth.  I admired the nine huge televisions blaring different channels in front of us, as well as two more to the side.  Behind us was a bigger room with families at tables, and in front of us, men and women milling about a bar. Our waitress was quick and exact.  She didn't have a very friendly demeanour, but I suppose that's because it was so jam-packed of customers that she couldn't spend time being personable.  I had a veggie burger with a wedge salad (no bacon, thanks).  It was definitely good, but I wished desparately for some good sourdough bread to sop the bleu cheese dressing up (yeah, I'm a bit European ""trash"" like that).  My husband had the grilled chicken tortellini (and damn it was good) with garlic bread (which was worse than Denny's garlic toast), with a glass of DELICIOUS limited-time pumpkin ale.  Oh my god, kids, this was the best beer I've ever tasted.  Clean, with an aftertaste of pumpkin spice...yum.  It wasn't sweet like I was expected, so that was a good thing, as well. The waitress was only excited and perky when she gave us the check, which was surprisingly only about five bucks more than what we pay when we go out to Denny's on weekdays.  So yeah, BJ's is a pretty good price for a couple going out on a weekend.  Especially for that awesome beer, and exciting atmosphere. Overall: I would say BJ's is the place to go for all-kinds, and it's a deliciously great way to spend a weekend night."
Stephanie M.,"Bakersfield, CA",8,14,5,1.0,2/27/2014,"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! I can not believe the service we had yesterday. Let's begin with when we got our table. It took our waitress to come & ask us what we wanted to drink about 25 minutes. We were obvious ready to order by then so we just went ahead & ordered our meal with our drinks. So then it took an additional maybe 15 minutes to get our drinks. It was a Wednesday night & it was my Mother in law, fiancé & my 8 year old son. So I asked for a kids cup. So when we got our drinks my sons was in a regular cup. I asked for a kids cup & that took forever to get as well! We had also ordered an artichoke dip that seemed like they went to pick the vegetables personally at that moment because by then it was already 45 minutes! So when we do receive our appetizer we got what it seemed to be the crumbs at the bottom of the bag of chips!! Okay so let's go on to our actual meals. My California burger, wasn't cooked all the way. I had asked for the chipotle mayonnaise on the side & they didn't bring it out. My sons spaghetti looked like it had been sitting there for like 1 hour (oh wait, it probably was!) & they forgot to put in the meatballs we had ordered! My mother in laws steak was burnt! & she had ordered mashed potatoes & she was brought a baked potato! It was HORRIBLE! Service was horrible & the timing was just wrong. It wasn't even packed! I will never go back. I've been they plenty of times & I've never had such bad service."
Justin T.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",92,22,12,5.0,10/31/2012,"The food is excellently prepared as ordered. I ordered a ribeye that was not only juicy but was also flavorful, accompanied by smoky asparagus and chunky potatoes. Truly a hearty meal, that could only be outdone by their infamous pizooki. This restaurant is one of BJs many successful franchises."
Justin J.,"Chino, CA",115,210,50,1.0,10/23/2011,"I just got back from BJ's on Stockdale in Bakersfield Ca, and I must admit, I am so very embarrassed to have taken a date there. The night started with a very very rude host by the name of ""Travis"" whom for some reason seemed to feel like he had to take his bad day out on me. My date was shocked by the way he treated me and thought that I must had known him in order for him to treat me in such a way. (She was even more amazed by the way he treated me when she found out we didn't know each other."" Once seated, our waiter came to take our order. His name was ""Wess"" and was a very pleasant gentlemen.     The night moved on and after feeling a little bit better about our visit to this location, we were once again disappointed by the food. It was a chicken wrap and was like something I would taste from McDonald's. after, we ordered a dessert to go. We were very excited to get home and taste this... what a disappointment. It was a very cheaply made donut with a tiny scoop of cheap ice cream and cheap whipped cream... cheap and bland in flavor. It was going to be a special evening for my girl and me, but you ruined it BJ's of Bakersfield. It was like you went out of your way to do so. I didn;t know a BJ's could be this bad. Thank you for proven to me that it is possible to run such an amazing restaurant into the ground. These things only come from poor management. You all need to start putting effort into it.  Thank you.. for nothing."
Bryan D.,"Bakersfield, CA",48,128,209,2.0,10/3/2011,"The trendy atmosphere here makes me want to puke.  The beer is okay.  The food is very inconsistent.  The service is consistently horrible.  Seriously, I have been here 5-10 times and never had good service.  One time I went and got the fish tacos.  I thought they were pretty good so then next time I went, I ordered them again.  The second time they were horrible!  What the??  Same thing happened with the pizza.  So I decided that going to BJ's is a gamble that I will probably avoid. I have to share the worst and most unbelieveable story from BJ's.  This was the last time I was there.  I was eating dinner there with the family.  I had to take the kids to the bathroom.  When we walk in the bathroom, my kids almost step on a turd that is on the floor.  I'm not kidding, there was a freakin adult sized turd, sitting in the middle of the bathroom floor, not even in a stall!  It was obviously a prank by an immature kid or adult.  To say it was disgusting was an understatement.  We exited the bathroom and went back to out table.  I quickly flagged down an employee and told her what we just saw.  She looked as if she was holding back a smirk and said it would be taken care of.  Okay, in a way, I understand her reaction.  The most unbelieveable thing was that we sat there for another 8 minutes or so before leaving, watching the restroom door, and no employee went into the bathroom!  The whole time we saw several customers go in and out.  Sounds unbelieveable, but it was true.  GROSS!"
S A.,"Reseda, Los Angeles, CA",43,34,2,3.0,2/17/2014,"Came to this restaurant with my family for steaks.  The steaks were well done for the most part. Mashed potatoes were a bit bland with no flavor. All in all the food for the most part was decent. The problem was with the customer service. First, the waitress took about 10 minutes to serve lemonades and a water. The appetizer came a little later and the steaks took about 30 minutes. When we asked for ranch, the waitress served us a teaspoon of ranch and said that is the last ranch in the entire restaurant. This was the main problem because we eat ranch with the potato wedges and mashed potatoes. After asking to speak to the manager, we were told that there's tons of ranch in the back. He approached us like we were nothing, asking ""hey what's the problem guys?""  This is not good customer service and I don't know how a waitress doesn't know where the ranch is. If I come back, it'll be for the food not the service."
Peter G.,"Baldwin Park, CA",8,17,14,4.0,5/27/2010,"Beer, beer food and sports! We got excellent service when we went to BJ's.  The server was very attentive and kept following up with us to make sure we were well taken care of. Appetizer: buffalo wings and calamari (both better with beer) I had the 5 Beer Sampler, overall not bad, the hefferveisen could have been better. Main course was the Blackened Salmon.  Food was predictable. However, the service was very good, that is why I give it 4 stars."
Becka R.,"Bakersfield, CA",20,32,,5.0,12/17/2012,"This place is great.  The salads, pizza, potato wedges, beer, all good.  The lunch specials are fabulous."
D N.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,80,1,3.0,9/20/2012,"The beers here are good, but overpriced. For a pint of beer you are spending 6 bucks which is pricy. All the alcohol in this place is expensive the cheapest margarita is about 8 bucks. The place just grabs at your wallet from the time you enter. Socially the bar is hard to approach women or get know other people at the bar. The crowd usually looks pretty good, but everyone is there just to eat. Not really the party spot. For being a ""brewhouse"" this place doesn't feel like a brewery. It feels like just like another chain restaurant."
Edgar T.,"McFarland, CA",41,12,3,4.0,5/8/2012,"This is the place to bring your friends and family. Starting off with appetizers, you should get the avocado spring rolls, stuffed mushrooms. Those two are my favorite. Buffalo chicken Ranch pizza is good. The chilli burger and the jalapeno burger are also delicious. They have a lot of beer and drinks to choose from. The only item I didn't like are the fried artichokes. Other than that...everything else is good so far."
Cheri W.,"Dallas, TX",23,128,48,4.0,1/19/2012,"Our server, who has a fabulous first name , was attentive, professional and on-time. Our food was great. the Pomegranate Margarita was good but expensive! Would eat here again, but won't order any cocktails!"
Big J.,"Bakersfield, CA",68,228,5,3.0,6/19/2011,"The food,beer,and service is all ok.It's not bad but nothing to write home about either."
Sandra L.,"Bakersfield, CA",42,198,108,4.0,10/23/2011,Great food/beer. I love the spicy spaghetti. Service is always friendly and fast. This restaurant is a great place for large party celebrations.
Janice C.,"Delano, CA",1,4,1,3.0,10/6/2012,"Not the best place for mixed drinks.  But the Pizza was good, because we were a very big group it was buffet style."
Jacob V.,"Santa Clarita, CA",160,47,28,4.0,1/26/2009,"A friend of mine is a Sheriff in Bakersfield who was injured in the line of duty in December 2009, so I do what I can to come up and visit him while he's on his time off. For some reason whenever I travel to Bakersfield, I feel the need to drink. It might be something in the air, or I might be an alcoholic. I haven't quite decided yet... So we decided to go to BJ's, as it was very close to his house, and we needed some beers and a solid meal. I had eaten at this BJ's the week before, and have eaten at the BJ's near my house, so I knew it was a safe bet. There were 3 of us that strolled in, and immediately sat ourselves down at a table near the bar. We were quickly greeted by our server and ordered our drinks. I prefer the ""Blonde"" beer, which was so delicious I eventually ordered 2 more. As for the server, he was excellent with his timing, and as my beer got critically low, he brought me a replacement. Impeccable timing. As for the food, I was borderline starving, so I ordered a small Blackened Chicken Pizza (an off-menu item FYI), which arrived shortly after my first beer was replaced. The temperature was perfect, and it was quite tasty. I inhaled the entire pizza, and almost started licking the pan it came in, but realized I was in public and that would look a little weird. But the pizza was definitely worth mentioning. Bottom Line: This trip to BJ's was one of the best I've had at any BJ's, the food was pan-licking-good, the beers were tasty, and the service was excellent. So why 4 stars Jacob? I'm glad you asked... I had come to this BJ's a week ago and ordered the Calzone... I am used to calzones filling my plate. The calzone I received was the size of a hot pocket. No joke. I am the kind of guy, where if I'm hungry, I'll scarf down an entire pizza and lick the pan when I'm done. However, when I spend $9 on a calzone, I expect more than a hot pocket."
Seema P.,"Irving, TX",146,219,52,4.0,9/4/2011,"Love coming here for the drinks.  My fav is the Blue Topaz Martini (not on the menu anymore).  Service is usually slow in the dining area, so I opt for the bar area as much as possible for faster service and the deals during happy hour on the appetizers.  Plus, you get better service and your food and drinks a lot faster.  Oddly as well, I can hear my company when seated at the bar rather than the dining area."
D R.,"Lake Forest, CA",120,17,,5.0,5/1/2009,"This place is SO good that I wouldn't care even if I had bad service (as many of you have had). I  mean, come on, you're saying a deep dish, Chicago style pizza and pizookie can't soothe your wounds? Maybe I'm much too easily won over.  But, in any event, I grew up with parents who once lived in Chicago and they could never stop telling my bro and I how amazing pizza there was. So when I finally got the chance to take them to BJs, I was quite pleased with myself. They actually really liked it, but WORD OF ADVICE, if you have impatient friends/family members, dont go on Fri or Sat night. Try an early dinner or lunch instead. Also, DONT DO TAKEOUT. The pizza just doesn't taste as good cold or reheated. It gets soggy and loses the yumminess that comes with the crisp, deep crust. Also, be prepared to only eat 2 slices, max--remember, deep-dish=filling! My favorites/recommendations 1. BJs Favorite 2. Vegetarian 3. Great White Also, I'm not a beer fan so I always get a crisp, refreshing Pear Cider. YUM. Lastly, don't even think about ending your meal without a pizookie! I like the basic chocolate chip best."
