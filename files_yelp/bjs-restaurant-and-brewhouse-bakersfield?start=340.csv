John H.,"Seal Beach, CA",23,110,,3.0,8/4/2011,"Ive had spotty service here. It seems like it depends on who is the waiter. Most everything here is OK, but the Pizooki for desert is a must."
Nicole F.,"Stockton, CA",49,104,39,3.0,9/19/2008,"I come here for two reason: 1. It is one minute from my house. 2. Pizookies! They are so yummy. I like to get 1/2 chocolate chunk & 1/2 white chocolate macadamia nut. Who doesn't like a fresh baked cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top?  Some other items on the menu that I have tried are: - Avocado Egg Rolls (good) - Santa Fe Spring Rolls (really good) - BBQ Chicken Pizza (yummy & full of toppings) - BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad (California Pizza Kitchen has a better version) - Turkey Breast Sandwich (pretty dry and bland, don't order) - Classic Burger (good burger, good fries) - Fish Tacos (pretty good, nice & crispy) Cocktail of choice: Ultimate Raspberry Lemon Drop"
Casey R.,"Honolulu, HI",292,523,451,3.0,3/18/2011,"I enjoy the beer and the bar area. It's a great place to go hang out with some friends, drink some beer and watch a game. The food is your typical chain restaurant fare but most of it is really well done and super tasty. Service is hit and miss but usually better in the bar area. It can get very packed during dinner and on the weekends so plan on waiting around a bit if you want a table. The bar area is first come first serve so I usually have good luck finding a spot there with no wait."
Nicolas V.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,21,,4.0,5/4/2012,Good Vibes and crowd. The pizza is always pretty good too. The waitress are goodlooking as well. :))))
Mike H.,"Bakersfield, CA",13,273,41,3.0,4/18/2011,"Good beer selections.  The problem that I have with this place is that their menu is so extensive, they don't have the opportunity to do any one thing great.  It is all just ok..."
Steve S.,"Bakersfield, CA",340,136,66,3.0,6/23/2011,Good food good beer.  Not great food and not great beer.  I would enjoy their beer more if they made it in house- Just makes it taste better...  Great happy hour place since I work around the corner...
Blake L.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,10,,3.0,3/1/2010,"I've been to BJ's three times. I have good experiences every time, just not fantastic. I like the food, I would know good food, I'm a cook. But the service is not spectacular, on more than one occasion we had to wait longer than you should for our drinks to be refilled, or clear away the table. A waiter should be able to manage all their tables. Good place still for dinner."
Erica T.,"Bakersfield, CA",6,26,10,3.0,4/7/2009,"The food is good...I just wish their drink selection was better.  They have great beer, sure.  But for their ""cocktail"" menu, it sure is weak.   Good Grilled Chicken Pasta! I substitue it with blackened chicken for that extra burst of flavor.  To make it have a spicy feel, just add a little of the pizza peppers.  Delicious!"
Ellie S.,"Bakersfield, CA",234,71,9,4.0,8/5/2007,"What a glorious town Bakersfield is. Just when I think there is nowhere to go for good entertainment, I stumble upon this little jewel. Apparently the Bakersfield club scene has taken to beginning their long night of partying at BJ's. Now this may seem a little troubling. You may ask yourself, ""Hey, but isn't BJ's a pretty well known chain that serves moderately priced American food to huge families?"" Indeed, BJ's reserves this demographic but in Bakersfield, BJ's also lends itself to haggard 30-somethings looking for happiness in the next meaningless hook-up. In fact, the restaurant is perfectly split in half: Half for the families, half for the bar-flies. This is especially convenient for me as I have found it to be much like dinner theatre. My booth on the family side is set up perfectly for people-watching. In the last episode of  Days of Our BJ's, a new character was introduced. A quite desperate-looking female waltzed in with that air of ""look at me please before my tits sag and I lose this waist"" which, to be honest, wouldn't have been that different but she was. She had a little extra flair in the form of a pageant sash and a tiara. I wish I could tell you what the sash said but all I could catch was ""Miss Outta..."" I guess I will have to fill in the blank with the art of using context clues. Perhaps it was ""Miss Outta of Her Twenties"" or ""Miss Outta Wedlock"". But enough with my catty-ness. She isn't what struck me as especially entertaining that night. In fact, it was the second woman in pageant regalia that struck me as weird, as it seemed that they did not come together. Does this mean that two separate women came up with the idea to wear sashes to dinner that night? I hope so. I also spent most of the night hoping some sort of fight would start between them. Dueling tiaras, if you will. I was severely let down. Oh and the pizookie is amazing."
Laura Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",150,248,1,3.0,12/3/2007,"I always have to work nights when I travel to B-Field, which messes everything up because almost all eating establishments in this truck-stop town close at 8pm, even IHOP.  Fortunately, BJ's comes to the rescue, with their monumental close time of midnight during the week. I am conflicted about this, though.  Here:  PIMPS UP:  I don't have to eat granola bars for dinner anymore!  Yay carboload vegetable-stuffed baked potato and berry cider! HOES DOWN:  Dealing with the late-night schmoes who have nothing better to do except go to BJ's and get shitfaced on a Tuesday.  I called in to get my meal as a takeout because I knew it was a bar scene and didn't want to deal, but as I was exiting the place, some guy having a smoke outside rubbernecked me for too long and his lady friend screamed, ""DON'T YOU FUCKING LOOK AT HER!"" and SMACKED HIM IN THE MOUTH.  I was wearing sweatpants.  I didn't turn around and look back; I just hustled. Ah, Bakersfield.  For a town without much to do, I sure have some great stories about you."
Chris B.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,10,,4.0,7/8/2011,"The Pizza is pretty good here (Nowhere near real Chicago deep dish though)  as well as the other food, but the real stars of the show here are the beers and the pizookies!  If you can't figure it out from the name a pizookie is a Pizza Cookie, and it is amazing!  All the beers here are great, my favorite is the Nutty Brunette.  We go sometimes just to split a pitcher of beer and a pizookie.  Place is usually pretty packed so we sit at the bar to avoid waiting.  Prices are a little high, but it's a chain so I expect that.  Good overall.  GET A PIZOOKIE!"
Conrad B.,"Bakersfield, CA",16,49,10,2.0,9/11/2010,"I laugh at places like these.  How generic can places like these be?  I can make better pizza with cheese, tomato sauce, and cardboard.  The crowd ain't much to speak of either.  Pounds of make-up on the wives of fat, loud, middle aged men who act like they're still 21.  I can go to Chili's and expect the same outcome of food and crowd.  Only thing I enjoyed on the menu was the 'pizookie.'  Class."
Roxanne S.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,14,,3.0,5/7/2013,"The place was alright. I wish the portions were a bit bigger. I'm not going to lie, i walked out of there hungry after getting one of theri New York stakes. (That says something if i ordered a stake and walked out hungry still). The wait time for my food to arrive was horrible. I was with my mother, (which is not a very patient person) and all she could do was complain. I informed here that it shouldn't be any longer. Boy was I wrong. I waited probably 30 minutes from the moment I ordered my food to when it arrived. The waiters were nice but still doesn't make up for the time i had to wait for my food. Reasonable prices. I liked their prices,it wasn't as pricey as I thought it would be."
Ruth K.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,279,56,2.0,5/3/2010,"I am sure no one in Bakersfield check's the last  page on the menu. Well the last page contains the nutritional fact's of all the greasy food on the menu. Diet or no diet it is especially important to check when your at a chain restaurant. The food tends to be LOADED with extra calories and sodium. I usually only eat at mom and pop restaurant's, but I was forced to go for a bday.  So I flipped to the back page and I wanted to run out. Mostly everything was over 1,400 calories with 2,000 grams of sodium or more. That's just ridiculous! My poor heart can't take that much sodium, so I stuck  with the lowest calorie entree on the list. I had the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps. They were ok. The Shrimp tasted farm raised. I finished and left. I didn't want to stick around for dessert."
Kayla G.,"Salt Lake City, UT",562,167,14,2.0,6/22/2009,"Don't you hate when you're totally craving Basque food while in the LOVELY city of Bakersfield, and then your brother decides he needs to stop at the bank and then again to get a ""five hour energy"" and makes you miss dinner hours at Woolgrower's by 6 GOD DAMN minutes?! Cause I sure as hell do. What I hate even more is that the hostess at Woolgrower's said ""Darn, you almost made it!"" while snapping her fingers. Bitch, why don't you snap those fingers at your cooks instead of me and make them feed me some basque food! 6 MINUTES! But instead, we were left to try and find a restaurant of any worth in Bakersfield that serves food past 9:36. So basically, we were left with a pool of shithole chain restaurants. Wanting a beer to drown my sorrows at this point, we decided to go to BJ's... after driving a good 15 miles, we just wanted somewhere close to get some grub and some draanks. BJ's it is... usually of all the chains, this is on the more tolerable end of the spectrum. I remember when this place was built, I had just moved away from Fakersfield, and everyone was soooo hyped on it. Call me crazy, but I just don't get that excited over restaurants that I can eat at 74 different locations. But, in the spirit of being out of town and hanging out with my brother and his girl, I decided to be a good sport. Right when we were seated, I ordered a Berry Burst Cider... SO GOOD! Its like Wyder's cider, but more bubbly and tart. My brother and Manfriend ordered a pitcher of the BJ's hef, and that was pretty good as well. This is where (most of) the goodness ends.  Our server... sigh. She was terrible. Besides being awful, she had a shitty attitude. Honestly, if you're not the most skilled server and you forget things and spill stuff, I'm really not going to care if you have a smile on your face. But once you start throwin your crappy attitude at me, my compassion halts.  Their menu is pretty big, and I start getting overwhelmed when I have too many choices, food-wise. So when this happens, I usually just order whatever was the first thing to catch my eye. Can't go wrong with gut instinct, right? Wrong. I ordered the ""New"" Italian Market salad, which was described as ""A new twist to the original italian chopped salad. Fresh Mozzarella, chunks of Fontina cheese and salami, artichokes, Kalamata olives, roasted red peppers, peperoncinis, garbanzo beans, red onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, romaine and iceberg lettuce all topped with fresh parmesan and basil then tossed with Italian herb vinaigrette."" Sounds delish, right? It was a total disappointment. I ordered sans cucumbers, but I'm thinking she may think I said, ""with no cucumbers, olives, basil, red peppers, or parmesan."" And another thing, my salad was about 1/2 the size of Manfriend's chopped BBQ chicken salad. WTF.  His salad was pretty good, standard BBQ chicken salad. Manfriend ordered the onion straw thingys on the side for me... and we also ordered a bowl of broccoli cheese soup... which she forgot to even put in, so we ended up unknowingly eating my brother's girlfriend's cup of soup she ordered with her sandwich. The soup was good, but barely even warm. Brother ordered the roast beef dip, which he wasn't super pleased with. We didn't send anything back, because judging by how slow our server was, it would have turned into a 3 hour excursion.  So heres the lesson- Stick with pizza at BJ's, and don't set the bar too high for service. You'll be disappointed. Next time, I will get my Basque food, damn it."
Megan H.,"Baltimore, MD",10,53,74,2.0,2/25/2007,"Bland, boring American food in big portions- and not particularly cheap- it's just not my thing. I can forgive bad service at a cheap hole-in-the-wall joint, but there's no excuse at a resto like this with real prices. There were problems with all the special requests, but the worst is that they almost overcharged us by $60! A couple left early and paid their portion of the bill. When I asked why their items were still listed on the bill the rest of us got, the waitstaff said although the items still appeared on the bill, they weren't calculated into the total. We asked her to recalculate the bill just in case, and of course she was incorrect. She mumbled an apology, but didn't offer anything else. Lame."
Theresa L.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,6,7,1.0,1/24/2013,"I've been to several other BJ's in CA and I really enjoy their food. However, the Bakersfield location has the worst customer service. I myself have horror stories and have heard some from many others as well. I will not go back anymore. I've drawn the line. I'll just have to wait to go out of town to have that great deep dish again!"
Debbie C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",189,769,294,4.0,12/4/2007,It was my first time going to a BJ's and oh my goodness BJ's Famous Pizookie is one crazy dessert!!!! We got half chocolate chip cookie and half white chocolate chip cookie. I really liked this place. A bunch of coworkers and I sat at the bar and got some good bar food and beer.
Unscrewed P.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,2,,2.0,1/2/2013,"First impression: Revolving door needs to be oiled. The place is dim, but clear and just loud enough to not be be able to hear the person your with. Service is poor at best, takes forever and servers could care less if your order is taken correctly or if your drink is filled. My associate ordered the veggie burger only to be informed that they are no longer serving it. After what had to have been 30 minutes we were served  mozzarella sticks which were essentially lightly breaded sticks of string cheese. They were OK. Ended up ordering a Hand tossed pizza which was undercooked (cheese not melted all the way) and missing one of the toppings. My associate ordered the calzone which seemed decent enough although it contained canned pineapples. Overall the food was edible but staff and service needs improvement. Bill came to $33.31"
Amber B.,"Bakersfield, CA",18,93,3,4.0,1/15/2012,"So my husband and I have been here twice now.  So far we like it!  The food has been consistant both times.  The atmosphere is great.  It has a pretty big bar area. You can dress up a bit if you really wanted or show up in a hoodie and still fit in.  We went about 5pm and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  soon after we were seated, the place filled up fast.  Service was pretty good on our first trip.  The waitress gave us some recommendations, which my father in law followed, and he wasn't dissapointed.  He ordered the fish and chips.  I ordered the fish tacos.  I thought that they were awesome! They came with guac and salsa (which were good) and maybe 5 chips.  I do wish that they came with more chips. My husband ordered the crispy jalapeno burger.  It was huge!  He loved it. It had deep fired jalapenos on it which he said added a wonderful touch.  We all ordered their beers and we were all happy with them.  I ordered the brunette, which so far is my fave ( I do like darker beers the most).  My husbands fave is the pale ale.  The second trip , I ordered the angel hair pasta. It was very yummy.  The serving size was huge.  pasta was cooked perfectly.  The flavors were very subtle.  My husband ordered the cajun pasta with shrimp.  he really liked it, but thought it could be spicier.  he thought the burger was better. service wasn't as great this trip.  We sat at the table for a few minutes and then another family was seated later.  The waitress saw them first even though we had already been waiting.  It was apparent that she forgot about us a few times.  She would wait on her other tables, walk away, then literally do an about face and come to our table, like ""Oh yeah I forgot about these two"".  We waited for awhie to get our check and then awhile longer for her to come back for the credit card.   My only reason for not giving them a 5 star is because on the first trip i asked for my tacos without onions, and they still put the onions on, and the second trip I ordered chicken in my pasta and they forgot to put it in, so I had to wait for it.  The food was good though, regardless."
