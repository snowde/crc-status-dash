Kay S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",17,58,4,1.0,2/26/2010,Let me just start by saying that I've been to several other BJ's locations but this one? This ones makes me so ANGRY. I love the food at BJ's and I especially love the beer. But the service here is so absolutely horrible that I can't even enjoy eating here. That's really sad and I wish they'd do something about it.
Adrian C.,"Visalia, CA",8,4,,2.0,6/26/2012,"Food was good... But our waitress was lazy, had to keep asking for refills. Then she just dropped the bill on our table as if we were at a Denny's, and we were still eating. Our waitress name was Cynthia."
Trisha P.,"Bakersfield, CA",6,29,1,3.0,3/23/2009,"I think I feel the same way a lot of people do. From what I've read here and heard around town, the reviews seem to be the same. I've been here twice. I absolutely LOVE the food and they have a nice variety for people. The prices aren't too shabby (i recommend happy hour), but the service is the only drawback for me. It isn't too well. The last time I went, it improved but the first time it was as if we were invisible. However, the food is so good I will go back"
Anosha S.,"San Jose, CA",20,209,12,2.0,6/24/2009,"My boyfriend and I came form lunch the other week. We were both excited to try new cocktails on that HOT day. The waitress asked for our ID's and both of us had re-taken our photos (because nobody believes we look like our pics and quite frankly, we had gotten sick of it) and were waiting for them in the mail. The waitress decided to card of (of course, we always get carded! I may look young but I do look over 21 and as for my BF he definitely looks lover 21, he is going to have his MD in 2 years...come on people!!!) Anyways, he only had the one that the DMV punched because his temp was in his car and we took mine that day. Unfortunately, the waitress decided to run it by the manager, although he suggested he has a wallet full of credit cards with his name on them. And of course we were denied. I then chose to cancel my drink order (I had my temp on me). It was an awkward with the waitress after that. I think she realized that he does look older than 21. UGH.  Anyways, the BBQ cobb salad is good and so was the turkey club sandwich. yum."
Raj L.,"San Jose, CA",0,14,,4.0,11/11/2009,"Never been disappointed to have lunch or dinner at BJ's. I had a great salad with fiends at this place. Good food, right prices - no wonder place is always packed with people. Try their tomato soup, it is awesome!"
Vik D.,"Renton, WA",34,91,8,5.0,5/20/2009,"I hit this place up 3 times a month after 10pm. Always have the same, Sante Fe Spring Rolls and Sausage and basil pizza from the app menu. The Best!!! Friendly service, yet to have a bad experience."
S R.,"Pismo Beach, CA",2,44,9,4.0,2/16/2009,"This was our first time at BJ's and I actually really enjoyed the Blonde beer. I ordered Fish and Chips (GREAT), Hubby ordered a BBQ sandwich of some sort and loved it too. We ordered a Pizookie and it was great. The only draw back was the wait staff...not great. Young and not overly friendly etc., But all in all a great meal."
Don L.,"Bakersfield, CA",55,127,1,3.0,1/2/2008,"I give BJ's one more star than it probably deserves as I do enjoy myself some Pizookie and the Jambalaya while not being the best is decent enough for me to give repeat ordering. I do also like the convenience of their 12AM closing time. Otherwise, BJ's is pretty horrible. Yeah, on the surface everything is all hunky-dorey but I've had awful service there too many times for it to be flukes. When I go I'm helped by sometimes three different people so that I'm unsure of who my official server is. And with such a rotating line of service things are missed that don't need to be such as getting silverware before my food arrives or refills on beverages. They need to either train their staff better or hire more if they are being overwhelmed so consistently. I thought that at the least a corporate restaurant such as BJ's would have the capital to ensure good service."
Charles H.,"McFarland, CA",54,4,,3.0,1/31/2013,"The restaurant is another overpriced and frozen food waste of your time. Maybe the brewery side is better.  I got an encyclopedia for the meal menu. Thats a bit much.  I got the Jambalaya - disgusting, frozen shrimp, processed andouille sausage, and burnt chicken bits. Just a load of ""cajun"" seasoned goup atop a bed of rice. My friend got a prime rib.... it was a measly quarter inch over cooked piece of garbage beef, accompanied by an ice cream scoop of processed mashed potatoes and reheated broccoli. There pyzookie cookie dessert was the best part.... guess thats their only real claim to fame. The service was a bit weird. After my second coke the waiter asked if I wanted to switch to water for some reason, as if they were trying to limit the amount of refills? It looks good inside though, but its just another mid-scale scam as far as a restaurant goes. Theres better food at better values in divier places. But the atmosphere here isnt so appealing that it can justify the restaurant charging mid-scale prices for such low-brow food. I only give it three stars, because Im giving the brew-house the benefit of the doubt, which is the side I did not experience, and Im assuming its better when youre drunk."
Debbie Chiou S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",243,698,4,3.0,5/17/2010,the short of it: it's hard to love a place where everything on the menu is over a thousand calories.
angie c.,"Berkeley, CA",0,46,,2.0,10/5/2009,"I always feel SOOOO fat after eating here, but then I look around the room and its diners and I feel slightly comforted. The food is pretty greasy, but it doesn't impede me from enjoying a meal with overly huge portions smothered in buttery, cheesiness with a caloric intake that I don't want to or care to know.  RECOMMENDATIONS Appetizer: Bruschetta Pizza: BBQ and Southwestern Pasta: Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta Other: Jambalaya Dessert: Half-oreo, half-peanut butter. Mmm... Sadly... THE SERVICE HERE IS TERRIBLE!!!! Consistently among the worst. Staff is inattentive (be prepared to ask for refills) and rude. I went in the other day to watch the game. While we were waiting for our drinks, decided to get a pizookie. So, we asked the girl who brought us the drinks for a pizookie. In the most condescending tone, she muttered ""Go ask your server."" You know, because it wasn't obvious that our sever wasn't present (who in turn hadn't stopped by our table once in the last 10 minutes)? And because it's not apparent that you're totally incapable of putting in the order or telling the server for us that we wanted a damn cookie? Fishing for your server isn't something a customer should resort to when they want to enjoy a meal out (or cookie in this case). On another visit, when I ordered the bruschetta, I said it with the harsh K sound, which is actually the correct way of saying it. The server had the nerve to correct me, ""You mean the broo SHEH da?"" Last time I heard, you were smart.... 4 stars for food. 0 for service. Averages to 2."
hank j.,"Dublin, CA",1,28,3,4.0,8/6/2007,"Great Beer, nice and cold, the Hefeweizen was very refreshing and a bit sweet!  Pizza was good, but it seemed to be just a few toppings thrown on a large soft bread.   It was little spare on the toppings, but it came out fast.  There were a lot of people at 2:30pm on a Sunday afternoon, which was surprising.  They must be doing something right..  The pizookie was surprisingly good, I would highly recommend it.  Bang for the Buck: 3 Atmosphere: 5 Food: 3 Service: 2 (I think our waiter was on drugs)"
david b.,"Bakersfield, CA",159,68,3,3.0,9/4/2008,"we went to this place all the time before they built one here in Bakersfield. for some reason it just isn't as good. maybe the sub par service, it is getting a little better. the grilled chicken baked potato is great. it isn't as healthy as you might think, it's a spud on steroids with chicken, broccoli,  3 types of cheese, and some addictive sauce. the pizza is awesome, with the best crust i have ever had. My 3 favorite pizzas include buffalo chicken, spinach and artichoke, and sweet pig. the pizookie is always a worthy effort, but try one with several types of dough."
Charles M.,"Long Beach, CA",19,31,5,3.0,11/15/2006,"The food is ok, so far I have had their fish and chips, clam chowder in a bread bowl, and roast beef sandwich.  the clam chowder was substandard, although, this is the only place I can think of that serves it in breadbowls around bakersfield.  the roast beef sandwich was about as basic as a sandwich gets, it did come with a rather large slice of baked potato though.  I am told their meatball sandwich is excellent.  The beer is why I came here in the first place and it was hit or miss for me.  Their Hefe-Weizen beer tastes just like a traditional German Hefe-Weizen (meaning very tasty).  Their IPA is very good and their red ale is also worth mentioning.  I was unimpressed with their porter (hardly any flavor) and Imperial stout (strong but bland) .  They have a pretty good selection of Belgium imports such as Chimay, Delirium, Duvel, etc.  In conclusion, a good place to drink, they have a wide variety of beer styles which is always good.  The food from what I got was decent."
