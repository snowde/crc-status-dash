Rebecca B.,"Bakersfield, CA",4,60,101,3.0,5/31/2017,I tried their new Barbacoa Cauliflower Tacos. They were very good. I was pleasantly surprised. It came with a rice/quinoa cold dish.  The service on the other hand was extremely slow. Their service is always bad.
Yaritza C.,"Bakersfield, CA",176,6,,3.0,8/1/2017,"Came by for pazookies with my friends tonight. Pazookies were delicious, but I'm really disappointed by the service. We have Beatriz as a waitress and I'm pretty sure I can count the amount of words she's said to us on my fingers. She took our order, brought us our waters, and then brought us our check. Didn't check up on or bother to say a word. I would understand if it was busy, but it's a Tuesday. Maybe she's having a bad night, who knows, but that shouldn't affect the way you communicate with customers."
Frank H.,"Bakersfield, CA",13,724,,4.0,7/13/2017,"We come here occasionally on weekends when in the area shopping. Service has been good, and the food has been good too. Some of the things we have tried are: Cheeseburgers, chicken alfredo, several pizzas. The bbq chicken pizza is unique, quite a nice pizza.  First time we ordered soft drinks, when the bill came we were charged like six bucks or more. They only got us once on that. Can we afford three dollar soft drinks? Probably so, we both work 50 plus hours each week. But if we want to spend three dollars on soft drinks we will buy a 12 pack. So we just drink water. Anyhow BJs is a restaurant with nice people good food, and we have not tried it but the alcohol looks enticing."
Katie D.,"Bakersfield, CA",13,35,,4.0,10/10/2017,"Consistently good!! I've ordered multiple different items on the menu. All we're good except the mini pizza. They clearly prebake the crust for those and it's just not the same. Service is generally good, sometimes a bit inattentive."
Jennifer B.,"Bakersfield, CA",48,70,182,4.0,3/31/2016,"So I just want to start off by saying I frequent Bjs quite often and I always get the ahi salad. I have noticed that each time it's different! It is still really good, however I swap out the dressing it comes with to the sweet tamarind sauce that comes with the avocado egg rolls. Each time something is different, more or less avocado, smaller or larger cuts of tomatoes, some times there is red bell pepper and some times there isn't, and the seasoning and sear of the tuna is always different!!!! Also take out portion is substantially smaller then what you receive if you dine in.  Not cool !! But I still love it. I just wish the consistency could be improved upon. The drinks and beer selection are awesome! The times I have tried bits of other peoples food have been really good too! The atmosphere is really cool I love the mirrors they have above some of the booths super retro looking in my opinion and the servers really seem to love their jobs and are always attentive."
Brittany M.,"Pomona, CA",91,1,,1.0,9/2/2017,The worst service I have ever received! Drinks sat empty for 20-25 minutes at a time. The green beans were burnt and sent back for more burnt green beans. Add extra drinks on to receipts. Pasta and pizza were under cooked. Employees came out yelling at table.
Julie A.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,6,3,1.0,10/20/2017,"Take out is horrible ... they forgot to include my sides ( I probably should've checked) but I feel like they should make sure everything is in the bags . Got over it, once I Was halfway through my meal there was plastic wrapped on the inside of the chicken breast ?? Not my best experience."
B B.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/31/2017,"Always trying to spend money here but not enough staff to take orders. Fail. The beer and the specials saves this place. I've walked out at least once before, but keep coming for house beers. Don't come hungry or you're likely to starve."
Mel C.,"Bakersfield, CA",21,299,154,3.0,10/17/2016,I think BJs is my favorite chain restaurant in town... Or maybe it used to be.  Then I went there the other day and the entire menu was different and three of my five favorite things were gone. What a disappointment.  I understand that a menu change isn't the fault of one location. The service here is pretty good. What'd I expect from a chain place.  I really hope they don't get rid of the other stuff I like!
Nicole W.,"Bakersfield, CA",266,21,2,1.0,10/14/2017,"Way overpriced for TV dinner quality food. I feel like the food is not good quality at all. Even when I ordered a beet salad, I felt like they had microwaved parts and dumped it on lettuce. Not my first choice of places to eat."
Katie C.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,18,45,5.0,7/13/2017,"The food here is excellent. My friend's first time here and she loved it. I had a coupon for BOGO free and she was very happy about the savings. We waited about 15 mins before a very nice friendly waitress came and inquired about us and immediately took our drink and appetizer order. Shortly after, the manager comes to our table and apologized for our waiting so long. That's what I call integral customer service! So BJs we will definitely be back for more. I highly recommend the peachberry ice tea. Delicious!! Thank you!"
L H.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/9/2017,I was in today and tried to purchase a gift card I was told by an employee and a manager because my card was not chipped I could not purchase. They said it was for my protection. Do they only care about my protection at take out but not in the restaurant? In addition I had to wait 10 minutes for anyone to help me to be told that. Ridiculous. I walked out with no gift card because of bad customer service and a questionable policy. Won't be back.
Sr. J.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/7/2017,"The service was rather less than satisfactory.  The drink order was slow.  The appetizers arrived seconds before the meals.  The silverware arrived shortly AFTER the meals had been delivered.  Fortunately, the meals were excellent. The southern comfort chicken sandwich was delicious. The Parmesan chicken was tasty and the mashed potatoes were superb.  The tables were full of empty dishes. There was no pre-bussing.  The birthday pizooki arrived before others had ordered their desserts. After ordering my dessert, I received a bill. 20-30 minutes later, I asked for the order to be cancelled since it still hadn't arrived and the rest of my party was all finished and had paid their checks.  Several other neighboring tables, had ordered dessert after we had and had already received them.  Several requests for refills or second order drinks were very slow."
Donna C.,"Bakersfield, CA",228,38,30,5.0,10/30/2016,"We had lunch here yesterday and everyone was very happy with their choice. I will definitely be ordering the fried mushroom, brussel sprouts and fried asparagus again as a appetizers. The staff is very friendly and professional and the manager is awesome!"
Seth V.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,11,,5.0,10/2/2017,"Wow! Wow! Wow! 35 of us showed up at 9:00pm and they got us seated fast and our food was amazing. Our server Andrew went above and beyond to make sure we were all more than satisfied with the customer service. I would recommend to anyone. Great personality and attitude all night helping us. A wise man once said, ""You the real MVP."""
Raquel B.,"Chula Vista, CA",113,1,,5.0,11/22/2017,Going out with some friends and had the best server ever. If you go here ask for Andrew is awesome and makes the night super enjoyable. The prime rib was in point and had a delicious Oreo pizookie. If you want good food and a good night come to BJ's.
Jennifer W.,"Bakersfield, CA",224,311,701,3.0,1/22/2016,"I've been to this location several times. A few times we've had less than subpar experiences and one time we had a great experience. The servers can either make your experience or break it and that's what has happened the times we've been here.  Most of the time, I have anxiety looking through their menu and even our awesome waitress mentioned she does, too! It's huge, a novel! It's so overwhelming!  We've tried several dishes here. Most of them are good. I haven't had anything where I have thought that I need to go back to have it again or I haven't been that pleased where BJ's is the first place I choose to go.  I also have a hard time with how loud it is in the restaurant, especially later in the evening. Although I don't have many complaints about the food, there always seems to be a better choice to me than picking here."
Bruce H.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",1,107,345,3.0,9/23/2016,"I had dinner here last night, sat in the bar to watch the game.  I waited for someone to bring me a menu, water, ask me if i wanted a drink, anything.....nothing.  it's not that they were short staffed, i had plenty of servers walk right past me.  I finally asked a server as she was about to pass me if she could send  the server over who was managing my area. Lo and behold she was my server. After that, everything went fast but it took a good 15 minutes before I ever had service.    Typical BJ Fair, everything was okay drinks  were okay"
Melony D.,"Bakersfield, CA",80,121,1339,4.0,7/13/2016,I sat in the bar area and it was nine minutes away from happy hour being over.  I ordered the mini pizza and siracha boneless chicken as a starter.  I also ordered the white peach margarita.  The drink was delicious.  I was glad that it did not come in a small cup.  The chicken was okay; it looked like the Tyson chicken nuggets.  The mini pizza was enough for me to get full.  It was good.  Of course I had to get the chocolate chuck pizookie.  That was the best part of my dinner.
Phyllis F.,"Bakersfield, CA",65,6,3,5.0,5/29/2017,"I really like the ambiance. A bit on the loud side. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. Lil Bit ordered spaghetti as always. Kent ordered the the Brisket burger. Calamari was perfect. Kent's salad looks nice. He's not crazy about the ranch funny spice or something. I'll finish after we eat.  Food was fantastic all the way around. You must try the Pizookle sampler for dessert. We would recommend BJ's to anyone. We don't drink so don't have an opinion on the beer. Looks like they have about 50 different kinds, maybe more."
