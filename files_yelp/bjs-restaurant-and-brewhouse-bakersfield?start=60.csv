Niecee B.,"Bakersfield, CA",81,3,,4.0,9/19/2017,Me and my friends came tonight to enjoy a girls night out and our waiter (older Hispanic male) was very rude service was terrible. He even messed up on my friends checks and he owed me a dollar back and he didn't even want to give it back so he came back to give me the dollar in quarters. I was appalled & so another waiter named Jake fixed it and gave me an actual dollar. Thanks jake great server
J C.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,4,1,5.0,8/9/2016,"Well we just came from BJ's today we r celebrating good news. We just gotta say that our server ED MALONE was AWESOME!!! He was handling it. On top of everything. We appreciated the good service. Thanks ED.  I just gotta say that u can never go wrong w/ BJ's. The beers are always cold. The food well u have so much to chose from so thats a plus. The servers minus a few are always on it. We have a certain waitress we love Amanda shes awesome if u get her ur in good hands. Love, love, love BJ's!!!!"
Carla B.,"Bakersfield, CA",67,8,,3.0,7/6/2017,"I like BJ's a lot and that's because I do not expect the best food in town. This is a sports bar, so whenever I decided order any menu item I know what to expect and what not to expect. I am just real. So food is OK - just ok, not over the top amazing. I've been here twice, and my opinion hasn't changed at all. The first thing I had was a hamburger and it was: blah! And the second time I decided to give the pasta a go and it was slightly under-cooked. I sent it back and within a few minutes the dish was brought back to the table, so not a big deal there. I think that the food is a little overpriced but the atmosphere is really fun and I do not mind spending a little more to be somewhere I like."
Carrie S.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,13,6,3.0,3/14/2017,"Four stars for very attentive service and willingness to correct errors.  Our onion strings appetizer arrived luke warm. We asked for a new onion strings appetizer, and the waitress promptly took back the appetizer. She had a dynamite attitude and really tried to provide us an upbeat dining experience! The new appetizer arrived Luke warm as well, so we just ate it. It would have been delicious hot.  My companion asked for her steak medium rare. The steak arrived rare. She showed the waitress and she promptly returned it to the kitchen. The manager came out and apologized and offered new steak and a free dessert. Stand up guy. The new steak arrived well done. My companion was disappointed and the steak was just too tough for her liking.  The kale and roasted brussels sprouts salad was fresh and delectable.  The baked potato was hot and tasty.  The avocado egg rolls were soggy on arrival.  So, three stars."
Allie D.,"Tehachapi, CA",1,41,2,2.0,8/28/2017,"I have been here many times and have always had good food and service - but this trip something was off. Our server, Lupe was polite and seemed to be on the ball from the start, approaching within about a minute if us being seated to introduce herself and take our drink order. Our appetizer order was taken and our drinks brought out quickly, then our orders taken. From here it went downhill.....  Our salads were brought out wrong but immediately corrected by Lupe with an apology. Our food was brought out - mine with the wrong side, which again was corrected by Lupe pretty quickly, but the kitchen mustve been kinda pissy cuz it came out scorched. She again brought me another side of sprouts, this time not burned. As my date ate his meal, he said it tasted weird - he turned over the piece of chicken to find it also burned....as was our friends ( both had the parmesean crusted chicken ) it looked as if it had been coated in coffee grounds?? They scraped it off and assured our server it was okay - but I know its not the way it should be. About this time I noticed that my Calif chicken club sandwich had no avacado ....again, we had to bother Lupe. She brought it immediately. As she was doing so, our waters were refilled, and my friends Sprite was filled with water....an innocent mistake but on top of the other issues, just a bad experience. As I stated earlier - not typical of this establishment. But trting to get them to go back to this BJs will not be easy. Also - we saw no management presence on the floor, but we didnt ask cuz Lupe handled everything and apologized....."
Sharon O.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,4,,4.0,11/18/2017,"Had the chili always a good choice but just as important the service was good, which has not always been the case at BJ's. Anyway everything was on point today and we will be back soon"
Jody O.,"Bakersfield, CA",62,17,,5.0,9/6/2017,"Went here a few weeks ago for the first time in awhile and I was very impressed. It was pretty busy but we only waited 10 minutes for a table (on a Saturday night). The menu is huge with lots of the usual choices you'd expect, but also lots of new, interesting entrees, appetizers and sides, including several vegetarian options which I really enjoyed. Our server was friendly and efficient, the food was great and we will definitely be making this one of our faves."
H. d.,"Bakersfield, CA",25,36,22,5.0,3/11/2017,"I had a great time last night with a friend. We checked online and were seated within minutes although there were a ton of people waiting to be seated.  The waitress was very attentive to us. Checked on us often and made sure we were happy customers. We both ordered pizza which was delicious, my friend ordered gluten free pizza and loved it."
Melissa N.,"Alpine, UT",40,1,,3.0,8/10/2017,Service was fantastic! Enjoyed the meal until we found a piece of plastic in our salted caramel pizookie. Brought it to servers attention so he could let kitchen know but he didn't seem too concerned.
Manuel G.,"Bakersfield, CA",5,98,27,3.0,1/16/2017,"I used to love this place. Now I just like it. I know they made their name by being a brewery and stuff like that, but they don't have a change in beers. Their food is good and their beer is still good, but sometimes you want their food with different beers. Make sense? Also their service seems to be slipping. We were there on a Sunday afternoon. It wasn't that busy, but it took a while to get service. She was friendly and all, but the time it took for everything seemed long. Still good food.  I love their flatbreads."
Kenia O.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,2,,5.0,8/30/2017,This is my favorite restaurant ! I love going there for my birthday because everything is delicious!! Their mozzerella sticks are a must and you definitely cannot forget their delicious dessert
Lori C.,"Bakersfield, CA",5,127,51,4.0,7/9/2016,"Friends from work and I went for appetizers and drinks this week. Not enough bus people, so we had to wait ten minutes for our table to be cleared. Got seated. Server was very good.  Ordered drinks. New cucumber jalapeño margarita sound refreshing...nope! Overpowered with sweet and sour. Couldn't taste anything else. I muddled my veggies in my drink. Helped a touch, but definitely won't order it again.  We ordered calamari, avocado egg rolls, potato skins, boneless wings with root beer glaze and I think it was called a tavern style pizza with chicken and pesto. All good. Calamari needs to be crispier, in my opinion. Boneless wings with root beer glaze were awesome! Definitely need to have them again!"
Jason E.,"Bakersfield, CA",266,23,2,5.0,7/27/2017,"I'm never dissapointed when coming here,  the food is consistently great (I usually order the Great White Pizza) and the service is always excellent  (ask for Layla, she's usually in the bar but serves in the regular dining as well). If you like different types of beer try the Berry Burst Cider and if you're not a drinker the brewed Cream Soda."
Trish M.,"Bakersfield, CA",7,156,143,5.0,1/21/2017,"BJs is always packed, and rightfully so.  You will receive great service and delicious food when you go there.  We've been there dozens of times, and not once have we been disappointed.  Whether you're with a large group, or just a few people, you'll receive great service.  That being said, I would suggest you go early, or call ahead if you're going with a group because it's always busy.  If you don't mind the wait, you won't have a problem.  But if you're famished, you might not appreciate it. There's always the option to have a drink while you wait, or dine in the bar area if seating is available.  They have several big screens with games on at the bar, which is pretty cool too.  Some of our favorites are the ribs, yummy hot wings, the salmon quinoa bowl, and the pazookie.  We've also tried the pizza and so many other options.  All of them are delicious.  BJs really does it right. Good food and service!"
Janki P.,"Knoxville, TN",285,3,,5.0,8/21/2017,My husband and I come here all the time. Alondra made this last visit a great visit she paid attention to details in our order and was very friendly and always smiling. I've been to so many BJ's but by far she has been the best server I have had at this chain. Keep smiling and keep the great work up. We hope to have you as our server every time we come. Food was great! Restaurant was keep clean and neat. Keep the good work up!!
Amber A.,"Fresno, CA",0,6,6,5.0,11/5/2017,We stopped here on our way to LA. We were seated immediately. The service and food was excellent! I would highly recommend the cookies n cream pazooki!
Shetal P.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/21/2017,"Horrible service placed order online and waited over 30 minutes for my food to be delivered to my car. They apparently forgot me after I called them twice. Girl who delivered my food apologized and assured me everything was in the bag. She saw that I had 2 hungry kids so we didn't go through the bag. Once I get home, I find my kids meals cold and some were incomplete and left out of the bag! Called the manager, Valderom (not sure how to spell) and he said he would send me a gift card which never arrived. I called them again to refund my credit card for the kids meals and no one could help. They took my number and said the manager will call me. Still waiting!!!!"
Hana S.,"Bakersfield, CA",185,7,11,5.0,1/18/2017,"I have been here once and my experience there was WONDERFUL. Our server was so sweet. I came here for my birthday dinner and invited 5 of my friends. Me and two of my friends ordered pizza. We waited for a while and they came back with two ""burnt"" pizzas. To me, I would have never guessed they were burnt. But our server apologized and told us we will be given new pizzas free of charge due to the fact that they had a new pizza chef in training! A while later, I asked if they were finished with my pizza and our server apologized again and took the pizza off my tab, so I ended up getting my pizza for free! Since it was my birthday, they also gave me a free pazookie! At the end of the night, I was blessed with a free meal! I honestly didn't mind the wait for the food at all because my friends kept my mind away from the time :)"
Corby O.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,23,,2.0,2/13/2017,"I want to start off by saying previous experiences at BJ's have been great and I've thought highly of it in the past.  That being said my last outing on Sunday there was sub-par at best and left me pretty disappointed. The last few times I've gone I've ordered the fire-roasted barbacoa chicken, it's amazing. This time it was anything but amazing.  The rice was so undercooked....I took 3 bites and all 3 bites contained grains of rice crunching and breaking on my mouth. I brought it to the waitresses attention and asked her to take it back.  What I got instead was an empty plate they told me I could keep my chicken on since it was fine and they would bring me replacements for the rest. I was brought a small cup of rice and a small cup of black beans to put under the chicken on the new plate. The rice was cooked this time and that's all well and good....however in doing so the new plate had no feta cheese, no cilantro, and no salsa. It was just a piece of chicken with rice and beans. That isn't the dish I ordered and I was really disappointed with the staffs' resolution to the problem, I would have been fine keeping the original chicken if they had prepared a new plate for me with the rice, beans, cheese, cilantro, and salsa so I got the dish I ordered. It was a pretty big letdown this time around, I hope my next visit is better."
Peter P.,"Bakersfield, CA",407,257,2139,3.0,4/8/2016,"BJ's is one of those restaurants for me that sits right in the middle of my mind when thinking of where to eat.  The middle and the reason is that it is not bad nor exciting so I almost want to say it gets forgotten.  One of the odd things is that BJ's apparently has some good craft beers, I drink beer but for some odd reason I have yet to try one here.       The food is good, some better than others and it only goes from what I have tried of course.  I never order the pizzas but my wife and kids like them and when they have ordered them I've tried and liked them as well but not enough to order for myself.  One of the things I really liked but they do not offer in the same manner is their baked potatoes.  It has been a while, but before they would be gigantic baked potatoes and that would be my meal.  However a few visits ago I ordered this and it was a regular sized potato, not something that would be a meal, at least for me.        My most recent visit was for lunch with my wife and I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a boneless breast that was cooked really well and had great flavor, but the mashed potatoes just fell short for me.  My wife ordered a pizza and I grabbed a slice, it was good but yet again, not something I'd order for me.      The service can be inconsistent from each visit I've had here, the last one not so well.  Our waiter took our drink order, then our food order but then went missing for a good 20 minutes.  Other people who were seated after us received their food, some waited on by the same person, some were not.  My question is, if some of the other people ordered what I ordered (chicken), how do they get their food before me?  That is a question that irks me, especially on a lunch time limit since we both were needing to return to work.  I can't for sure what happened, so I chalk it up to a one-time occurrence but it still is annoying.      BJ's is a nice place to eat whether lunch, dinner or just a snack with a beer.  There are times that it can get really packed and wait times are long, but it is nothing different than other restaurants of the same style.  They do have a mobile app that will let you order your food so when you arrive, it will be almost done if not waiting for you.  I think you get a discount for the first order you place and I think you can reserve on it too!"
