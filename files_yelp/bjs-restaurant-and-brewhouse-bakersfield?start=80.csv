Maricel P.,"Bakersfield, CA",180,240,2431,3.0,4/3/2016,"This place is just okay for me. I'm not a huge fan of their food, but it's not the worse either. I came here for lunch one afternoon with my husband because it's just down the street from my work. To me, the best thing that BJ's is known for is their pizookie which is a delicious warm cookie with ice cream. They also make pretty good deep dish pizzas; however, the last few times I came in the food was just okay. The atmosphere is still nice, they are a clean facility and the staff is very polite and attentive. Yes, I know I'm taking a chance with coming here on my lunch time as I am crammed for time and they are busy, but they seriously took 50 minutes to bring my pizza out. So, if you are on a time limit this place definitely is not the spot for your lunch hour. I definitely think you should try this place out and make the judgment on your own because I have friends that absolutely love this place and not only for that pizookie, but for their food."
Chris S.,"Bakersfield, CA",76,349,1772,4.0,5/4/2016,We had a really good lunch today at BJs. It was a chicken Derby Cobb salad. It had avocado and cucumber and chopped egg and tomatoes and two kinds of cheeses and grilled chicken breast with a special Avocado ranch dressing. It was delicious. Special thanks to Vanessa's assistant. The employees are friendly and efficient and we enjoyed ourselves. We will be back. Thanks BJs.
Leslie C.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,6,5,5.0,8/2/2017,"I Love their pizookies, order one every time I go. I have a rewards card with BJ's and always get deals and free pizookies. I always order the same thing, so I would recommend the deep dish BJ's favorite pizza and the grilled chicken alfredo, the bread with it is so fresh and good. The crispy calamari is a great appetizer!"
Amy S.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/25/2017,"We have had many unpleasant dining experiences with our 4 young kids,  but this was not one of them.   Our server was quick and attentive, the menu had an amazing variety.  Our favorite part was when they brought out appetizers for our kids.   A yummy roll and fresh fruit cup.   This is brilliant!  Not only did it keep our kids occupied, but also kept them tied over until their food came.   This really made all the difference in our own meal experience,  but thankfully for the rest of the restaurant as well because our kids can get loud! Way to go BJ'S you now have lower customers for life!"
Cheryl G.,"Bakersfield, CA",57,131,67,3.0,11/11/2016,"I've been there twice, both times for celebration lunches tied to work. The service has been pretty good considering we're there at the lunch crunch and there's about 20 of us, and the food is decent. The menu is quite varied and there's something for almost everyone and almost every diet style."
Moises A.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,6,,5.0,7/27/2017,Great Customer service! I absolutely love the avocado egg rolls for appetizer. I recommend to come and eat here!
Monica R.,"Bakersfield, CA",16,14,26,4.0,1/5/2017,I like BJS I go there at least once a week. The food is consistently good. The service is excellent and the drinks are strong. It has a nice atmosphere.
Kayla E.,"Delano, CA",4,19,10,2.0,12/13/2016,"Came in to grab something to eat after a late movie showing. I didn't want something very filling, so I decided to get an appetizer (crispy artichokes) and the soup & salad combo. Well, I was upset with my soup. I mean how do you mess up soup? Warm it up, put it in a bowl, throw on some toppings to make it pretty, done. I was wrong, so wrong. I thought I ordered soup, but I guess I ordered broccoli cheddar pudding and a tomato mozzarella salad instead. I requested to change my soup to tomato bisque (or whateva) and it came out suspiciously quick. The oil was separating the soup making it look like liquid cellulite *yum* I barely even took 2 bites of that. What. A. Waste. I'm giving 2 stars because our waiter was a trooper. Super nice and he didn't question my request to change soups (but he should've questioned that pudding). Plus, I liked my harvest hefeweizen.  Just about the only thing I enjoyed."
Estrella N.,"Bakersfield, CA",8,15,70,5.0,12/11/2016,"My husband and I have been coming here for a long time. He loves their santa fe salad with chicken! So whenever he says he feels like a salad, I already know he means BJ's Restaurant!! Since it's usually just the two of us, we get seated pretty quickly - sometimes right away! Like today - there only reason we waited about 5 minutes is because I was purchasing their gift card deal - but a $50 gift card and receive a $10 bonus card plus a 20% VIP card. We know we'll use up that gift card right away, so it was a deal with getting! Oh, their avocado egg rolls -- if you haven't tried them, you're missing out!!!"
Lorena S.,"Bakersfield, CA",116,98,1458,3.0,5/23/2015,"I absolutely love BJ's..and I'm so glad that we have one in town. Tonight was not a good night to come, for It was extremely busy with birthday & graduation celebrations. Our waitress was super nice to begin with but you can tell the busy-ness was wearing her down.  Our food took a while to come out and we could tell because it tasted like it had been sitting there a while.  We ordered the Chicken Parmesan, avocado egg rolls, chicken wings, the fried artichokes & the kid's mini corn dogs. The avocado rolls I love so much disappointed me tonight. They tasted extra oily, I only had one. Everything else tasted luke-warm.  The kid's meal was good--mini corn dogs w steamed veggies (broccoli & carrots), but it was also not as hot as it should've been. Tonight was ok, we'll still come back, just not on a Friday night around graduation time.!"
Mike M.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,22,3,2.0,6/9/2017,"One of my favorite spots has started to slip...problems on the last three visits. I think the sharing of wait staff isn't working. ""I'm Bob and I will be your server tonight"" ...and then you never see him again. He takes a drink order and then another person brings out the wrong drinks. My mother in law asks for sweetener for the iced tea...and #2 waiter never brings it. We order food from Bob and #3 brings out the wrong food...a salad instead of a sandwich, soup instead of pasta and the wrong sides with other courses. This means a 25 minute delay in food and the tea never gets sweet. Bob reappears, apologizes and leaves  the wrong tab. Two weeks ago it was a hamburger slathered in mayo when we said no mayo or dressing. Lost wine order and the check never came to table. Service only works in the bar area. Sad...will move over to Eureka Burger."
Will A.,"Bakersfield, CA",114,276,690,4.0,4/1/2016,"BJ's Brewhouse is a really nice place to eat! I have gone here many times, and never been disappointed. The food is average American style and sometimes a little salty, but overall it's always high-quality.  The best thing about BJ's, is the craft beers that they sell. They have a beer sampler that is really good and not expensive at all. I also really like the service there. The staff are always nice, well-trained, and attentive to our needs. If you want a nice, fun, quality place to eat, try out BJ's. I hope that you like it! It is important as well for you to know that they have free Wi-Fi and TVs everywhere! That is awesome! Also, you have to try the pazuki desert. It is a big, fresh baked cookie with ice cream on top and off the hook yummy good! Enjoy!"
Sherri S.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,14,3,5.0,10/1/2016,"I go to BJ's several times a week for lunch and I am part of the rewards program. I always receive exceptional service from the servers there and most of them know my order because I order the same thing everytime which is pasta and a salad. On Saturday, September 24th, I went to BJ's a little after 4 pm for dinner and my server (I believe her name is Gina,) asked me what I would like to order. I told her Fetuccini Alfredo with Penne pasta, blackened chicken on it, no broccoli and a side salad with only spinach leaves. During my giving her my order, she gets out her pad to start writing the order down and said to me ""Wow, that's a lot of food for 1 person.   Upon her seeing the look of anger and frustration, she tried to backtrack by telling me that is not what she meant. I told her I did not want to hear it, told her to get away from me and requested another server. I was humiliated by her comment as there were a lot of people in the original section I was in. I asked to be seated away from other people, spoke to the manager and got another server Merlin who was very kind. My review is not from a personal standpoint, but rather a customer service standpoint. I am beyond tired of crap customer service and in this instance, Gina was on the job serving customers, so that negates her being able to voice her personal opinion on how much or how little food a paying customer orders. While Merlin was very nice and gracious, the above scenario ruined my overall experience this time. And because of all of this unnecessary crap, they failed to add my reward points for this meal as I had asked them to originally. Update: My concerns were graciously addressed by BJ's management, reward points added  and I am extremely appreciative of their efforts to right a wrong. I will remain a customer of BJ's."
Sirena M.,"Bakersfield, CA",9,1,,1.0,7/8/2017,Worst experience with their service!!! Waited forever for them not to acknowledge my party. We had to walk out of the place after waiting 40 min to be seated and another 25 min for them not to even offer something to drink. Never coming back!!!
Marissa R.,"Bakersfield, CA",64,2,,1.0,7/6/2017,"Left hungry, sent meal back and was turned off to order another. Service was awful. Very slow server, hard of hearing, poor customer service. Food lacked flavor and chef was not on his game!"
Roderick R.,"Concord, CA",148,5,3,5.0,7/5/2017,Visited this establishment on my birthday and had excellent service from a pretty handsome server named josh. My mother and sister were flirting the entire time but he kept it professional which I find amazing. I ordered a turkey burger and it surprisingly wasn't dry so good job on that one. And my sisters chicken alfredo was the perfect combination of noodles and sauce. I am extremely happy with the service provided to my family and I.  Service: 5/5 Food: 4.4/5
Tim M.,"Los Osos, CA",4,11,4,4.0,6/3/2017,"First time here. Place packed, but was seated (party of 3) w/in 10 minutes. Food selection was great, except I never saw a choice for fruit or a fruit bowl/cup. My dining partners had an appetizer of chicken wings, then flat bread pizza and salad, and I had the chicken Caesar. Everyone enjoyed the food, taking home left-overs. There seems to be a very good reason why it was packed of lunch on a Friday."
Laci M.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,4,,3.0,7/2/2017,"My friend and i decided to come in for dinner tonight. It took about 15 minutes for someone to even ask if we wanted a drunk but by that time I had alreadly gone and came back from the bar. Charlene was great the white peach margarita was amazing! Martin was our server when he finally came to the table he asked us if we wanted to order an appetizer and we said no he walked away but we had to tell him we were ready to order. The food was amazing. However we asked for ranch with our pizzas whennit came out but it took three people to finally bring us ranch. The service was horrilbe but the food was great. Next time i go,  I hope to have way better service"
Steve B.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,68,43,5.0,10/18/2016,"So 2 nite we had a gang of 18. Servers Christine and Ronnie did a great job taking everyones orders within a few minutes of being seated, having appetizers and food expedited, drinks topped off and checking back on a frequent enough basis to avoid mutiny amongst da troops.  So...........anudder ""All Goods and No Bads""  visit to this particular BJ's outfit."
Mike C.,"Bakersfield, CA",25,1,,5.0,2/19/2017,Had breakfast there. As always it was great. Perfectly portioned expertly prepared and friendly service. What more could you ask for.
