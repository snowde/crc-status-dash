Anna L.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",1946,147,451,5.0,1/4/2018,"Service: amazing our server is hilarious and really helpful just had Such a great time:)!!! We even took a selfie together haha. She reminded us to download the app get free mini pizookie!! She also split our check perfectly without us asking.  Food; I loved my BJ's favorite pizza I can still smell and taste it after hours LOL. It's so delicious and my first time trying deep dish pie pizza. The sausage and pepperoni  green pepper and white onion was a pretty dope blend and it was crispy but soft at the same time!! I'm lactose but yolo. I got the mini which was 4 slice (plenty for me) I was full after 2.5 :) I ordered the grilled cheese to go with fries for my cousin! Emily ordered the pasta dish also deep dish in cheese and it was pretty tasty!!! The mini pizookie was insane I def liked the chocolate chip one WAY more. Would have gotten the avo egg rolls if that wasn't like 1k calories... Cost: this was crazy my total was 14.50$ for pizza, pizookie (free cus of the app), and grilled cheese w/ fries. Apparently my pizza was half off from 12$ to 6 cus it was happy hour. We went around 2:30pm:)! I LOVED this meal and would totally come back. Ppl were right everything here taste great and SO MANY OPTIONS WHAT THE!!!!"
Leonce C.,"Baton Rouge, LA",127,10,3,5.0,11/6/2017,Really quick and easy for lunch. The bartender was amazing. The spaghetti and meatballs are really good. Get an extra garlic knot... I would definitely recommend this BJs. Also make sure to get the app and sign up for the rewards program. Service is by far the best at this location and staff always friendly!
Linda V.,"Baton Rouge, LA",113,56,367,4.0,11/5/2017,"It's been a year since I've been here. I never have been fond of the food, but I feel like a lot has changed in a good way from quicker service to food.  We ordered the dark beer flight, but that just reinforced how much I hate the taste of beer so that was a no go for me. I also ordered pumpkin ale beer and didn't like that too much either and our waitress kindly changed the drink for me to a strawberry splash, which was very delicious! I got my braces tightened that day and the macaroni and cheese and clam chowder was perfect for me to eat! My boyfriend got the weekend special prime rib and it came with 3 sides and a pazooki for $26! The service was quick and the waitress was friendly. I will probably come back here again whenever I want to eat later at night."
Nikki F.,"Addis, LA",8,58,280,4.0,11/25/2017,"I like going here for the atmosphere and nice decor! My little one loves the pizookies! My two favorite dishes are the root beer glazed ribs and the root beer glazed wings. Both items are listed under appetizers but I order them as a entree and add a house salad. On our last visit my husband decided to get the double bone pork chop and a bake potato. This pork chop is very thick! He said the seasoning was phenomenal. He also enjoyed the bake potato. My little ones had the personal pan pizza and it was delicious as well. It's similar to Pizza Hut but better. On this visit our waitress, Natasha was super nice!! We had three little girls with us and she made them feel very special. I don't know if it was a Black Friday special or not but she brought out a complimentary appetizer to the kids. It was a garlic buttered croissant and a small cup of grapes and blackberries. When it came time for the desserts she delivered the pizookies with a candle so the girls could make a wish and blow them out. Natasha displayed excellent customer service. Bj's is an awesome restaurant with amazing food and a nice atmosphere."
Yariana C.,"Lusby, MD",39,23,54,4.0,12/9/2017,"We haven't been to a BJ's in a long time since we lived in Texas. I love that this restaurant is big and has plenty of room for families. The food was great and our drinks were tasty as well. The kids menu had plenty of options for entrees, sides and drink choices. I had a bit of sticker shock at our ticket but hey it was worth it."
Joanna A.,"Baton Rouge, LA",136,97,127,3.0,7/8/2017,"The service this night was way off. The waiter was apparently very tired and had been there all day. He still tried to help, but was just really having a bad day. The menu is overwhelming, just way too much going on. Hard to really make a decision . Our food came out missing a bunch of side items. Our frustrated waiter apologized and went back to get them. We ordered a cocktail from the bar..... it took about 30 minutes to get it. The waiter kept going back asking for it and the bartender kept shoeing him away, and telling him we would have to wait ( we witnessed this from our table). The manager was called to the table, he was very apologetic and offered to comp the meal, but we declined and only accepted a comp for the drink. Our food was ok, nothing to be wowed by. Between the service and the food, we will probably not be going back."
Chelsea J.,"Baton Rouge, LA",90,87,29,5.0,6/19/2017,Love this place! I've honestly never had anything bad here. The avocado egg rolls and the beer sampler are a personal fave. You really can't go wrong with whatever you order!
Melissa W.,"Baton Rouge, LA",2,27,11,4.0,12/12/2017,"Great place if you're looking for happy hour. Extensive menu, beer list and drink options (both alcoholic & non-alcoholic). Haven't dined in in awhile, but take out experience is great. Most times I use the app to place my order, but the times I order over the phone have been pleasant. All my utensils/condiments (even extra) are in the bag, my order is accurate, portions are decent (I've been to other places and they skimped on my take out order) and my food is still pretty warm when i get home. They offer great daily & lunch specials."
Haiqiao J.,"New Orleans, LA",2,72,33,4.0,1/31/2017,"Overall a good place. Below are the tails why Pros: great happy hour with a wide variety of food during happy hour. My personal favorites are the BJ's favorite pizza and the slider appetizers. Also, the shrimp lettuce wraps are also very good. They have a good variety of beers so you will surely find something you enjoy Cons: service is slow during happy hour. The wait staff is nice, but it does take a while to get your food. So if you are getting close to end of happy hour, may be best to just put in a bunch of orders and prepare to wait So if you want something good to eat and don't mind a wait at times, great option"
Mendi B.,"Gonzales, LA",2,18,42,3.0,7/31/2017,"This place is very good if your not in a rush. There menu is HUGE!!!!  I mean about 20 pages HUGE. So knowing that I figured all there food items would be frozen not freshly made. They have a very large beer menu but beer isn't my thing. They forgot our appetizer and it came after our meals were almost complete told them we didn't want them anymore and she said we could keep them only to still be billed for them when we didn't eat them. Blahhhh.... but other than that the kids enjoyed the kids menu. My daughter and I split the BBQ ribs which were very good. (Thursdays they do a whole rack of ribs, salad, two sides and a cookie for $20) you can't bet that deal. Over all the food was worth the wait except for the hiccup we had! Check there website also we found a $10 off a $35 order to use. So it made up for the miss appetizers. We will try them again!"
Kim N.,"Harvey, LA",0,15,,4.0,12/25/2017,We just had a family dinner here last week and surprisingly their food tasted pretty good! We went here a while back for lunch and I couldn't recall anything special about this place . But until recently we tried the prime rib and some shrimp pasta. It was so good!
Jenni C.,"Baton Rouge, LA",186,160,362,3.0,2/16/2017,"I love this chain.  But they missed the mark this day.  My dinner came before my app. Was at the bar,  bartender was very inattentive.  I had to wave my hand to get her attention, as she was laughing and cutting up with the waiters.  She was overly eager for me to pay my check though,  I was still finishing my drink.  Even though I tipped her +20%, I usually do,  she didn't even thank me for coming in nor did she check on me in the 15 or more minutes I was still there.  Rude!!"
Tiff J.,"Baton Rouge, LA",1,4,11,1.0,8/19/2017,I've been here a couple of times. Usually great bartenders. Today the bar staff Both started names started S. (not good enough to make an impression worth remembering)  They were not engaging at all. Most bartenders at least hold a conversation when it's slow. When they do you talk and drink more! Not with them......one drink and I'm ready to go...
Kevin C.,"Destin, FL",0,1,,1.0,11/18/2017,"Worst place ever,  servers/bartenders walk around ignoring tables that have just walked in, I came in expecting to get my dinner and have a relaxing time, instead I came to a host that waited for ever to tell me that it was a sit yourself place, I sat there with my buddy for about 10 minutes, neither the server or coworkers showed up to offer me a drink or anything. I found a bunch of lazy workers  who just walk around not caring about this business, I'm guessing there is no manager on Nov18 at 11:30pm because if there was,  the place would be running like a restaurant and not like a circus. Someone should get a whole new staff on that floor."
Antonia T.,"Houston, TX",230,71,47,3.0,5/28/2016,"This used to be my favorite restaurant, the service could be a little better, sometimes the waiters take forever to bring refills and the food isn't always as great or consistent as usual so that is why I'll give it 3 stars. For the restaurant itself, the menu has so many delicious options to choose from, their chicken and steak are wonderful and the setting is relaxing. One of the most memorable items this place has to offer is their dessert, the pizookie. It's an all time favorite (pizza cookie) so if you go here don't miss out on it!"
Mary N.,"Mansfield, TX",121,92,18,3.0,12/26/2016,"BJ's is my favorite place to eat. Great place for pizza lovers, but also a lot of other things on their huge menu. My favorites are the peach berry tea, calamari, parmesean crusted chicken and the California club Flatbread. This specific location was ok. The hostess were extremely welcoming but the service was slow and just ok. Waited 15 minutes before we were greeted by our server and than food took another entire hour before it came to our table. That's disappointing. Other than that food was delicious as always"
Jenna M.,"Baton Rouge, LA",39,64,112,4.0,8/28/2016,Walking in we were greeted right away and everyone was very friendly. This was our first time here so we were expecting anything. I got the caprese piadina with fries and a water. My husband got the meat lovers piadina with fries and a sweet tea. We also got two chicken strip kids meals with fries and sweet tea. All together it was about $30. A dinner for 4 for under $40 is ok in my book. My caprese was very delicious at about 900 calories including the fries. The meat lovers calorie count was 1160. My food came out fresh but my husband  said he could tell his sat for a little. The bathrooms were very well kept. Over all we enjoyed it and will be back.
C W.,"Cleveland, GA",9,23,5,2.0,5/9/2017,"Decent.  It could be so much better.  The reviews on the slowness of service and lack of enthusiasm from the servers is on point.   The beer is yummy.  (Craft beer fan here.). Food was prepared well.   The Italian thin crust pizza was what I'd expect.   The atmosphere is sports bar meets industrial high end restaurant. Plenty of TV's for sports. In the end, for two, our check was about $40.  (It took FOREVER to get the check and to have the server pick it up!) I expect way better service and quality for the price.   Unlikely we'll return."
Razaa A.,"New Orleans, LA",7,63,43,1.0,8/6/2017,"Horrific service. Waiter's name was Nicholas. Ordered a pizza with no meat, they brought out PORK. Manager hand delivered the new one to my table and didn't even apologize. They didn't comp the pizza on the bill, and they also subbed in shrimp on the pizza for the pepperoni and sausage, AND still up-charged! Wish 0 stars was an option."
Keith W.,"Lanesville, IN",0,1,,4.0,8/12/2017,"I was amazed at the gourmet designed options, delivery, display, and quite frankly the delectable taste of the food I received at prices of big chain ""Bar Food"" vendors.   Just reading the menu makes you feel like you're on an episode of MasterChef."
Quay L.,"Hallsville, TX",5,12,27,5.0,12/21/2016,My experience was delightful. Learned about the different portions. You can get lunch portions for dinner for lower calories. I don't drink beer so I tried the berry cider and loved it. Bartenders were attentive and knowledgeable. Will diffidently be back!
Quynh D.,"New Orleans, LA",228,148,304,4.0,6/24/2015,"Yay! Good bar food. Back in the day, chili's was the only restaurant I knew growing up. Then I was exposed to the world of delicious, natural, inventive good food throughout the southern Louisiana I-10 line. Naturally, chili's became my worst nightmare. However, sometimes you crave that original place that has Americas favorites. (hamburgers, sandwiches, pizza and beer) Bj's has slowly become my go to spot for whenever I need to satisfy the appetites of a variety of people. You can't please everyone at an oyster bar or a sushi joint, but you can at Bj's. The only reason why I'm giving four stars instead of five is because the service isn't the greatest.  The sample appetizer plate comes with mozzarella sticks, spinach and artichoke dip, avocado rolls, and Sante de rolls. Sub avocado for more Sante Fe egg rolls.  Lightly fried Mahi Mahi tacos delicious. Chicken dish also delicious."
Andrew A.,"Columbus, OH",105,7,1,2.0,12/26/2016,"The reviews for BJ's Brewhouse all seem to share a common there: Hit or Miss Quality. Tonight was our third visit to this location.  Our first two visits (a slow summer afternoon and a recent Friday night) we're fine; good service and decent food at a price we expected. Tonight was different.  Tonight was a miss. We arrived at 6:30 ton full restaurant.  The hostess took our phone number and told us the wait was 10-15 minutes.  We had hoped to grab a few happy hour drinks anyway, so we checked the bar area for a bar table/space.  There were 4 ""open"" tables that were piled with dirty dishes.  We decided to wait for one of those and took our seat when the first one was cleaned 20 MINUTES LATER (6:50 - still happy hour).  Someone came to take our drink 15 later and our drinks came 15 minutes after that.  If you're following along at home, you'll notice that we had been at the brewhouse for 50 minutes before w received our first drink.   The server took our food order when our drinks arrived.  We did not see him again until the food came out.  The food (a pizza and a dinner salad) was fine.  We ordered a second round of drinks upon the arrival of the food and those did not come until we had almost finished eating.   And then the wait for the check...    zzz...   zzz...   zzz... Check arrived.  Happy Hour discount for one of the first drinks ($1.50 off a beer - thank you) but did not do it for the other drink (1/2 off wine - WTF?).  We left feeling ripped off. It was a cruddy enough experience that we won't be back. PRO TIP:  If you intend to drink while at BJ's Brewhouse, bring a flask and few bottles of water from home."
Elen C.,"Baton Rouge, LA",87,88,122,4.0,12/21/2016,Pretty good for a chain type restaurant.  Service was on point and beer selection was great! I'll go back for sure.
Rebecca W.,"Baton Rouge, LA",1990,930,7784,5.0,9/21/2016,"I have been here a bunch of times that I can't believe I've never written a review for this place! Honestly, I can't ever say I've ever had a bad experience here. Some may think I am being overly generous with my stars and I say, ""why not""? It's consistent every time. I have come here with me and my small family and have been here with a large party as well. Servers have always been courteous, food has always come the way I requested for it to be prepared and there have been plenty of times that they have gone over and above my expectations. So, I am a foodie and always love receiving food that looks similar to the photo or sometimes better than the photo. Their pizzas here are pretty fabulous. I enjoy thin, crispy crust pizzas and enjoy Chicago-style deep dish pizza with that bubbly, cheesy crust. BJ's has that deep dish, bubbly, cheesy style crust that I can't get enough of. Don't come here just to get a salad (even though they are pretty good), come here to get a large, deep dish pizza and have at it! Don't come here if you're on a diet, go somewhere else for that. I am pretty crazy about the pizza here."
Jasmin K.,"Montreal, Canada",0,6,,4.0,6/6/2017,"It wasn't our type but the service was more than okay. We went to eat and the food was okay, but I feel you go there mostly for the beers with friends"
Matthew D.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,1,,1.0,4/5/2017,HORRIBLE customer service. Food came out 15 minutes before we got silverware. We had to ask for a refill during our 1.5 hour dine in at the restaurant. Waiters and waitresses kept giving us food that belonged to different tables. Food is amazing but customer service keeps me out of here for good. Will NEVER return!!
Evelyn F.,"Raleigh, NC",141,8,4,5.0,8/31/2016,After being stuck in traffic my children and I decided to get off the next exit. We stumbled upon this gem of a place. A wonderful children's menu and wonderful adult menu and a full bar. They make their own wonderful craft brews. My kids ate everything on their plates.. And some of mine too LOL. It's my new favorite place in Baton Rouge.  The whole experience was nice. The hostess was friendly and welcoming as if we were guests at her home. We had a sweet server named Ty who made sure we were aware of all the specials and gave good recommendations on food choices.  Whether you are a health nut or want some yummy barfood. This is the place to go. Be sure to check out their happy hour specials both on food and drinks.
Swatee G.,"Fairfax, VA",515,637,1157,3.0,12/30/2014,"I have only ended up coming here late at night multiple times with people from work in parties of 4 or more. Service can be spotty depending on the traffic in this place. Also, do not expect to get any choice seating unless you are willing to wait  awhile - and that annoys me, because the place NEVER looks like it is more than half full. Now as far as food goes, I think the place does a decent job. I have tried various things here and a few stand out. I had this watermelon salad which was very tasty actually! I have also tried their blackened fish entree which was pretty decent. The tomato mozzarella flatbread was also great. Can't say all their food is great though. Some folks on our table did not enjoy all their food. All in all, I think it's an ok place to come to, just be prepared for a long wait and spotty service."
Mike W.,"LaPlace, LA",19,7,,1.0,5/26/2017,Starting off with one star.  I realize a group of nine isn't common.  But to be told that an entire section is closed at lunch time is ridiculous.  To be told they don't want overload the kitchen is comical.  Let's see where this goes...
Jodie S.,"Baton Rouge, LA",290,29,32,5.0,10/13/2016,"Freakishly fantastic! I love this place, I go often.. try the new menu items, I had the soba noodle peanut chicken today and WOW was it great! Roger the chef came out also to see how we liked the new items too. Also we tried the tomato soup, it was very rich and creamy, I loved it. You should go if you haven't been lately because this place has improved greatly over the past two years I think!"
Jimmy D.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",179,3,,1.0,5/12/2017,"I came here on May 12th at 7:50pm. A white girl was a hostess and told me my wait was 20-25 min and then sat down every couple who came in immediately after us for the next 25 min. Once we asked another hostess, she said we were never on the wait list."
Bobby G.,"Baton Rouge, LA",279,78,71,2.0,11/8/2015,Not the best food but definitely not the worst. It's kinda a hit and miss kinda thing.. The entrée is either over seasoned (like the jambalaya) or extremely under seasoned ( the burgers). The service is not bad but the prices are a bit high for the small portions. You can't go wrong with the stuffed baked potato though.
Chantel V.,"Baton Rouge, LA",314,114,343,4.0,9/11/2014,"I received OUTSTANDING service. I have to say that first. However.....I may have just had the worst bj's pizza I've ever had in my life. I have been an avid fan of their deep dish pizza for over TEN YEARS. My pizza today looked like all the cheese had oozed out from the center of the crust and slid down the sides. It tasted awful. My side Caesar salad was DRENCHED in dressing. Granted im accustomed to bjs in California,  but still. I expect much more from this restaurant. So.....***Review Update*** I frequent this place. Usually to catch a game, or for a late night outing. Service has REMAINED STELLAR and dare I say it, food has also improved. In fact, they have a salad that I have absolutely fallen in love with. You HAVE to try it. It has kale , and cranberries, and Brussels sprouts, OH MY."
Kelly U. N.,"Prairieville, LA",38,24,8,1.0,10/29/2016,"We've come here a lot over the years & everything has gotten worse & worse. First off, the waitress was not so bright. Our sampler appetizer was wrong, but we didn't say anything. Then our so called BBQ chicken salad with NO CHICKEN in it ...& nasty BBQ mixed with more nasty dressing. Then the waitress going to tell us ""ohh, that ain't my fault, that's the kitchen"". The young manager came & brought the small plate of chopped up chicken & said he'll discount something on the salad. And at this point, my husband blood is boiling already. And when he got the bill, nothing was changed on it. We don't care about the discount or money, but its the point of ...when you know you've messed up, do something to show your customers you actually give a damn. So we won't be back."
Bryan F.,"Baton Rouge, LA",188,14,1,1.0,11/16/2016,"Service is the worst in Baton Rouge, managers didn't care that we waited for an hour for our cold food. Had to continually ask for refills while we waited and waited. NEVER going here again and will tell everyone we meet not to go either. Good service brings repeat customers and bad service bring complaints."
Ashley K.,"Baton Rouge, LA",120,149,176,4.0,6/23/2015,Great service and great food. There menu is very overwhelming because there are so many items to choose from. I recommend getting the pizza you wont be disappointed. I also really enjoy there strawberry lemonade.  No matter what you are all of there food is delicious.
Han K.,"Houston, TX",85,31,63,4.0,7/28/2016,"Came in for dinner on a Thursday night and was seated promptly for 2 at a 4 top table by the host. The service started with a confused waitress not knowing if we were greeted already or not so that was a bit embarrassing. After 3 minutes our waitress arrives to get our drink orders but she was not aware of the beer sampler details which made me opt out of it. I ended up getting a pint of Stella and Alabama sunset. The new Alabama sunset was a great cocktail with a nice pineapple orange juice flavor and a slight hint of alcohol present.  The calamari- very delicious! Lightly breaded with jalapeños fried bits which was very complimentary.  Jalapeño burger- delicious tasting burger with a bit of spice. Could have used a tad bit more salt and some kind of a sauce to the burger but still delicious on that amazing bun. The skinny fried complimented it amazingly.  The ahi tuna salad- amazing salad with a nice blend of flavored with the daikon, salad, fish, and sauce. A great choice for a nice and healthy entree.  However during our dining we were interrupted several times with confused servers bringing another tables food to our table. They might need to step up their memorization on their table charts a bit better.  Our server Elizabeth tonight did a great job tonight. We could clearly tell she was new to being a server but she made no mistakes and did a wonderful job.  Overall I gave this place 4 stars tonight due to the lack of communication with the employees at bjs tonight."
Katie S.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,12,1,4.0,1/14/2017,"BJs is a nice place to go for a place to meet with friends to sit back, share some appetizers, and watch a sporting event. At least to me, not too many crazy sports fan screaming, a relaxed way to enjoy. The menu is large, and anyone can find anything on it. I used to love to get the fried artichokes in lemon aioli. It was a small bites dish, so wish there was more. I sometimes shared their chili nachos with others, decent version. I'd prefer typical nacho ingredients to go on it, not just chili like we had. Going there many times though I've had many different types of service. Some amazing and some lack luster. I understand that comes with going to any restaurant though. I gave BJs a 4 out of 5 though because everything I had was good, but not necessarily something I feel the need to get again and again. Also, considering the extensive menu, could help the vegetarians out more."
Marie M.,"Ponchatoula, LA",0,8,12,1.0,12/16/2016,"Hey this restaurant is nice on the eyes , but horrible on the food & service !! It was absolutely awful!!  It took an hour to get our food , and it didn't have that many tables full !! My husbands steak came out cold, undercooked , even though he asked for it to be medium.  My hamburger had mayo on it , when I specifically asked for No Mayo !! I asked for a replacement bun just to save time , so they wouldn't have to cook another one , and it took them 25 minutes just to bring me a new bun.  I had also asked for barbecue sauce with my hamburger , it came out 30 minutes later. Our Server never checked on us , and never refilled our drinks once !! We couldn't find her ! NEVER again !! :(   The manager gave us some off the bill. Bad experience."
