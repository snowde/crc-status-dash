Alayna H.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,15,,1.0,11/29/2015,"I went here on a date about a month or two ago because we wanted to go see a movie and it's all conveniently close together. The hostess was a little rude and didn't acknowledge our existence. Our server was really nice, and I know he was trying his best, but this visit was by far one of the worst experiences I've had eating out. He introduced himself quickly after noticing us and suggested popular drinks and entrees. We informed him that we were on a time limit because we were going to the movies after and that didn't really seem to matter I guess. I am a server and I understand but this was all just unforgivable. We ordered two items and 2 different servers brought out the wrong items, two different times. It took 35 minutes to get everything right. Our server was extremely apologetic and comped off my friend's beer as well as offered us free dessert, but we passed. Will not return most likely. We tipped him 20% because it didn't seem to be his fault, and he tried hard and was super nice."
Scott J.,"East Lansing, MI",9,40,,3.0,5/23/2013,"This is one of the few bars that serve ""there own"" beer in Baton Rouge.  It is also one of the few places that has a menu which anyone can be satisfied with.  I take pride in eating healthy even when I go out, and They have an awesome selection of salads and lighter meals, as opposed to having bar food and grease soaked fries.  One of my favorite appetizers is the thai lettuce wraps.  They are very light and can be a meal for a single person.  They are worth trying. Although there food is excellent and the beer is pretty good, it doesn't get 5 stars because the service is really spotty.  One of the times I went I was with a co-worker and it was very good, and the other time i went alone and sat in the bar self seating area, and after 10 minutes I moved to the bar to try to get some service.  After 5 minutes of staring down the bar tender he finally acknowledged me.   The only problem with the food is I got my appetizer the same time as my meal, which obviously made me feel rushed (I was not rushed, I was watching the basketball playoffs)"
Toy P.,"Atlanta, GA",16,14,11,3.0,7/24/2014,I spent a few days in Louisiana so I stopped by this place Monday night. Louisiana food is amazing and this place is no different . I had the Cajun pasta it was soooo delicious omg :-). Service was ok . The lady who bought out my cocktails to me ( wasn't my server ) was so nice and friendly ! I ordered 2 different cocktails because the first one was gross . Way too much lime. I didn't want to send it back so we just ordered another . That one was terrible also.. Figured maybe the bartender was a new bartender or something ..  All in all good was great and it's right near the mall
Aaron R.,"Alexandria, LA",1,5,1,5.0,9/28/2014,Best restaurant in Baton Rouge.  If you get the chance come get your grub on. Appetizers on deck and they are all great. Brew their own beers and they taste good.
Carvey P.,"Katy, TX",53,58,11,4.0,6/19/2014,Great Service by Josh!   Pizza was a little burnt on the bottom but wasn't his fault. He was very attentive to us. He hadn't been there that long.
Yelp King ..,"LA, LA",1,141,175,5.0,8/20/2010,"Located at the Mall of Louisiana, this place is honestly one of the BEST restaurants in Baton Rouge. From the very modern inside and outside, to the beautiful exterior and interior decor, to vibrant atmosphere and friendly staff, this place is absolutely amazing. There is also a full bar with a HUGEEEE television and lots of rich people come here to enjoy a drink and laugh and watch the games. Not to mention...the FOOD is to die for, seriously!!!! I had a strawberry-lemonade ($1.99) to drink and it was honestly the BEST strawberry-lemonade I have EVER tasted (seriously!!). I also ordered the BJ's Burger ($8.99), which was so good, it practically melted in my mouth. I couldn't even FINISH the whole burger, I was soooo full, thank goodness (because I rarely get full at restaurant servings).  Undeniably, one of the nicest places to eat."
Joe P.,"New Orleans, LA",2,51,7,1.0,9/7/2013,"It's a brew house that does not brew beer. BJ's is to beer what the Olive Garden is to Italian, or better yet it's to beer what Macdonalds is to burgers. BJ's is an appropriate name since It sucks.... It's corporate schlock garbage manufactured fast food trash. Dont waste your time unless you think Applebees is a neighborhood pub."
Pennie T.,"Gonzales, LA",1,33,4,1.0,10/29/2013,"Had the worst experience here ever! Every possible restaurant complaint possible, I had here, all in just one visit. wait 10 minutes after being sat to be greeted by our waiter who had passed by multiple times, took drink order, took 5+ minutes to return with with wrong drinks. Ordered an appetizer, no problems there. Ordered soup/salad/burgers for lunch. The burger was served first, and again was the wrong order. Soup was brought out cold, sent back and then never returned, had to ask about it. Salads were served last like they had been forgotten. Had to go to the bar to get own drinks. After speaking with the manager the problems continued to exist. They did comp the meal, but the ""free meal"" was still NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE."
Nick X.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,11,5,4.0,6/13/2012,"Nice selection of food and great selection of beer. My first trip to BJ's was on a gift card from a relative, I had never heard of the place.  I went not knowing what to expect.  I decided to try the pizza, since it was in their name.  I ordered their signature pizza, which is a deep dish ""supreme"" type pizza. I wasn't too impressed with the pizza, but I've had worse.  The toppings are corse cut, which I found odd.  Large chunks of tomato, onions, etc.  I had vowed to not return because I wasn't impressed. My second trip occurred the following year when I again received another gift card.  I figured I could go this time and try the microbrews at least.  I went in and ordered the Roast Beef sandwich w/ gravy (french dip anywhere else) - this sandwich was AMAZING.  I think there was some grilled onions in there, I don't know, but it was simply the best french dip I had ever had, my previous favorite was Brew Bachers.  My companion had the chili cheeseburger.  The name is a little misleading, you won't be eating this ""burger"" with your hands.  It is served open face and drenched in chili sauce (I believe this was disclosed in the menu).  The burger is massive.  My companion ate roughly half at took home the rest.  I did not personally try it but I was told it was very good. Both times I went was for lunch on a weekend.  The atmosphere was relatively quiet with people of all walks of life coming and going, generally cheerful and relaxed in an environment similar to J. Alexander's, trendy and modern yet a step above typical casual. I tried several of the beer available.  There is an ample selection to choose from for anyone looking for a different taste from the typical domestic pilsner."
Erica H.,"Livingston, LA",4,27,13,3.0,5/5/2014,Food is pretty good and the environment is awesome. Service could be a little better. It's a spacious place to go with a group.
Chris C.,"Geismar, LA",5,45,4,4.0,3/21/2011,"BJ's is one of our favorite places to bring the kids. It's loud and has a great kids menu, while also giving my wife and I plenty of decent options for dinner. I've also been to BJ's several times for lunch, and they have a pretty good lunch menu with several good deals. Even the deep dish pizza is passable - and that comes from a native Chicagoan. There's perhaps no outstanding cuisine here, but I've yet to find anything on the large (think Cheesecake Factory) menu that was objectionable, either.  The only drawback to this place is consistently slow service. Usually the servers are nice and seem well-intentioned, but food and drinks (other than soft drinks) take forever to arrive. Usually this doesn't bother me, but recently I had lunch here with a relatively large group. I ordered a burger without their ""special sauce,"" clearly noted by the server. When the burger arrived with the sauce, the server was extremely apologetic. However, due to the glacial pace at which the kitchen seems to move, everyone else had finished eating by the time my correct dish was served.  Bottom line, BJ's is a solid choice amongst chain restaurant options in Baton Rouge, especially if you're dining with kids."
Darlene B.,"Baton Rouge, LA",10,33,11,3.0,8/4/2013,"Went for a friend's birthday last night and was seated rather quickly which as you know in BR on a Saturday night is pretty hard to find.  It took awhile for the food to come out and the servers seemed a bit confused about what went where.  The drinks are also extremely overpriced.  I ordered the Strawberry Splash, their signature drink and it was almost just as much as my pizza! Of course there were no prices on the menu. Those hiccups aside, the waiter could not have been more polite and friendly.  The food was also delicious and the layout of the restaurant is phenomenal for groups.  We were able to talk, laugh and not feel like we were being disruptive to other people around.  I would recommend to others."
Bill E.,"Houston, TX",0,8,,1.0,10/18/2012,"Went to this location a few weeks back after the LSU/Towson game.  Been to BJs in Houston a few times not because it's great, but because it's good enough.  Saw on Yelp that they close at 100 am.  We arrived at about 1100 pm.  We weren't really greeted. Hostess person was cleaning menus or something in her big round booth thing.  She had her back to us.  She talked to some passing wait staff a couple of times.  A waiter then asked if he could get us something to drink while we wait for a table.  The place was literally half empty!  There were four of us, not  forty.  Why did we have to wait?  It reminded me of walking into a fast food place when employees who hate their jobs clean up an hour before closing and give you a hard time for daring to make them work.  We left.   Our neighborhood BJs in Houston was okay at first, but became mediocre in service and food quality over time.  I was hopeful.  Now their off my ""desperate for anything open"" list in two states."
Debbie C.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,23,,5.0,5/21/2015,"LOVE THEIR BALSAMIC GLAZED CHICKEN!!! This is what I order each time I go. Not a crazy chicken lover but this dish is so heavenly, I think I love the cheddar potatoes the best, but all put together its just plain awesomeness. Kinda like a fancy version of KFC's famous bowl :). But NO WHERE close.. this dish is fantastic. The only negative thing I can say about BJ's is the location, the mall traffic is horrific most days..."
Cade M.,"Bossier City, LA",12,28,69,1.0,3/23/2013,"The two times i have been here the meals i ate were terrible. My father ordered chicken fried steak and expected to get gravy, when it came out i almost laughed because there was so little gravy it only covered a quarter of the steak and the STEAK WAS SMALL!!!!!!!! The pizza was small and was greasy and soft, it was disgusting and covered in garlic. SIMPLY TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Frank R.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,12,2,1.0,5/3/2015,"We said on our last visit we would never go back. Stupidly we did. The absolute worst service of any restaurant we have ever attempted to eat. Even worse than Chimes East. The server came to our table promptly, once.  Brought one of us our beer and announced they were changing the Keg on the other.  15 minutes later, turns out they were out.  Ordered a second choice, sadly it never came, nor did the refill. The beer is ok. Not great but better than Bud. Another waiter stopped by and when we complained rolled his eyes and said ""oh boy here go again."" After a half hour and the second beer didn't show, we saw the manager who brought the beer. After an hour and a quarter, no pizza, no burger, and the place was maybe 10% full. Never, ever will we go there again. Why are there no negative stars!!!"
David P.,"Ponchatoula, LA",11,41,1,3.0,2/26/2012,"The beer was pretty good but the food wasn't anything special.  The appetizer was pretty bland and both entrees my wife and I had weren't all that great either. In fact, I felt the menu to be overwhelming for a chain.  There's no signature dish, nothing that stood out in the menu. My only complaint about the beer is that the glasses you're served with for their craft brews are said to be pints but I'd say they're closer to 14 oz.  The beers are quite expensive, going about 5-6 bucks a ""pint"".  I don't care if its craft brew, those are strip club prices. Basically BJ's is a brewpub with a restaraunt and mediocre food at best. Service was decent.  Probably a good place to hang out with friends for a few drinks but its not a place I'd make my way to go out to."
Joshua D.,"Saint Amant, LA",1,1,,5.0,10/10/2014,Me and my gay lover are crazy about this place. Absolutely cheetos for this one boys. Take my man here and it's a surety I'll be getting a rump that night boys. Mhhhmmmmm *** there's a reason they call it BJs boys.
Phi N.,"Houston, TX",38,199,24,3.0,8/8/2011,"Great place to get some beers with  some friends. There's a great variety of food here and the service has always been good.  The food here in my opinion is average, but it's fun to hang out and get a couple pitchers of different beers they have on tap. Had the ""Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo"" which consisted of spinach & artichoke dip, mozzarella sticks, avocado egg rolls and Santa Fe spring rolls.  Pretty much bar food.  Also tried the Mediterranean pizza and it was okay and nothing to get excited about.  I really enjoyed the BJ's Brewhouse Blonde beer.  It was very smooth and tasty.  ^_^"
Michelle B.,"Sugar Land, TX",69,8,4,1.0,11/19/2013,Food rocks obviously because it is BJ's but service is absolutely terrible every time I've been here and not worth the food. Horrible staff and no sight of any managers ever.
