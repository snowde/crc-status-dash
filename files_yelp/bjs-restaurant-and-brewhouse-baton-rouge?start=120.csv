Randy O.,"Prairieville, LA",61,119,18,4.0,7/11/2013,We had not visited here in quite some time because we usually avoid restaurants that have Pepsi products.  But we decided to try them today and the food was good but nothing truly exceptional.  I had the Buffalo burger and it was flavorful and the slaw on the side was just like I like it....not too soggy and crisp.  It was a bit dry though as can be the case with lean cuts of meat.
Kimberly A.,"Baton Rouge, LA",121,176,214,4.0,6/6/2011,"The first drawback is that the menu is so massive that it takes you 15-20 minutes to read it.  So if you are starving, it is best to review the menu online before you think about going here. Once you order, the food is excellent.  I have not had a bad meal here.  The portions are larger than normal, which is a plus in my book!"
Alex S.,"Baton Rouge, LA",34,45,2,3.0,6/6/2013,"I went for lunch around noon on a weekday, and the value is pretty good. The prices are a little exorbitant for dinner, but I think the lunch portions and prices are more reasonable. The service was quick, especially for lunch. The rewards program for BJ's is free, and I got a $5 off coupon when I signed up! The salad was standard, nothing great, but also not bad. My only real complaint is that my salad had a little too much dressing, so I will be getting it on the side next visit."
Ralph S.,"New Orleans, LA",0,9,1,1.0,1/24/2014,Just got a pizza from BJ s Big long blonde hair hanging off the thing when they brought it to the table. No wonder there is no one here. Wow they offered me another one. No thanks
Jack X.,"Baton Rouge, LA",1,103,,2.0,6/28/2012,"I don't get the appeal of BJ's.  My guess is that it is located outside the Mall of Louisiana and the Rave theater and one of the closest places from I-10, and the interior has a ""classy motif.""  Overall, though, the food is very mediocre and also overpriced. I visited BJ's a few times.  On my last visit, I had a waiter who opted to socialize with a table of female customers instead of dealing with the table I was at with mostly male customers.  He also made numerous mistakes with our order and was very slow to deliver. Sadly, there are many who castigate Baton Rouge for having bad culinary choices, and BJ's seems to perpetuate that stereotype.  There are far better places in the Mall of Louisiana vicinity--you just have to drive a bit on Bluebonnet to find them, although the restaurants on the Bluebonnet side of the mall are pretty good."
Carla V.,"New Orleans, LA",57,171,25,3.0,7/14/2012,"Met a colleague here for a beer before a movie.  There is a great beer selection and an impressive offering of alcohol in general.  Good crowd and quick seating from the hostess made for a nice experience.  The service was average, but friendly.  I recommend drinking your beer from the bottle, as my server over poured the last Hoegaarden in the place only to create a small puddle outside of my booth.  Not cool.  She was so excited to let me know that I got the last one and then wastes some of it by overflowing my glass (which I did not ask for).  Idiot!"
Sheryl F.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,41,35,4.0,10/18/2013,"It's normal BJ's- watered-down drinks  and a ""way-too-varied"" menu. It's a good, decent restaurant for kids. My husband loved the beer variety. Nothing incredibly special, but yes, I wi be back again."
Linda J.,"Hammond, LA",9,28,27,4.0,7/2/2013,Went here for lunch and was pleased with the great lunch prices. Food was good and we also enjoyed the beer.
Mandy V.,"Baton Rouge, LA",78,281,275,2.0,1/26/2012,"I have reviewed before and been pleased, but not this time. Waited forever for food. We had four people in our group and only 3 dishes were brought out. We didn't see our waiter until 15 minutes later to ask for the dish. Then had to wait another 10 minutes for them to bring it out. They knew they were giving horrible service so they offered to take the late dish off the ticket. That's the only nice gesture made all night. I will say that once the food came out ,I did enjoy it...but the service made the meal miserable. Also, our drinks were never refilled."
Jane S.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,9,,1.0,9/28/2012,"I've been here twice.  The first time wasn't great, and the waitress flat-out lied when I asked her a question about the food. Almost a year later, I decided to try again, and now, I will never bother with this place again.  I got take-out, and the food was very bland.  They not only screwed up one of my orders, they also burnt it.  I'm just tired of poor quality food at restaurants.  There's no excuse for this.  If the food you cook comes out burnt, don't serve it!  If I was going to spend $40, I wish it had been for something I would have actually enjoyed.  I also think it is odd that a lot of the negative reviews for BJ's is ""filtered,"" and the ratings don't factor into their overall score.  Really?  I guess Yelp likes censorship and is favoring businesses over their customers.  And... I am probably going to be filtered now."
ScottandLisa V.,"Prairieville, LA",1,12,16,1.0,9/27/2013,"Don't know what happened on 9/22/13. Love the menu, beer and atmosphere. Went Sunday evening, 18 tables with people, counted 22 employees, no service for 15 minutes even while 2 tables next to us got food. Went to bar, employees walked past twice without a word. On third time I said excuse me, are you working back here, they responded yes and walked off. Wife and I went to the hostess, asked for manager, they went in back and 10 minutes later still never came out. We just left, 30 minutes without even being offered a glass of water. Been to BJs over 20 times and never saw anything this bad, here or anywhere for that matter. Management needs to get this situation under control."
Matt G.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,2,,3.0,9/1/2012,"The menu is large and the food didn't disappoint.  There is nothing that pisses me off more than being rushed.  The waitress asked if we wanted dessert about halfway through our meal.  She also asked if we wanted to go boxes - RIDICULOUS...I'm still eating.  Then proceeded to drop off the check but told us to ""take our time.""  I know they do this at a lot of similar priced restaurants but do yourself a favor and wait until the customers are finished.  I guarantee they will be happier and may actually order dessert, stay for another drink,"
Zachary L.,"Prairieville, LA",0,7,,2.0,6/18/2012,"The food was really great, but what made my visit here distasteful was halfway through our meal our waitress began to push desert on us. Again before we completed our meal our check was brought to us. I understand that there was a large party about to arrive, but that is no excuse to push your other paying customers out the door."
Murray H.,"Suwanee, GA",5,48,8,3.0,8/1/2012,"This place is hit or miss... The atmosphere on game weekends is awesome... Most of the time the food is great, then sometimes it's just average. I love the pizza here, but I think the quality goes south real quick when the kitchen gets slammed."
Roderick F.,"New Orleans, LA",130,22,10,5.0,5/28/2013,Great service awesome beers . Huge selection of beers  to choose from . pizzas are great and i really enjoyed the pasta jambalaya
Clayton K.,"Baton Rouge, LA",5,3,,1.0,11/10/2013,"Horrible experience.  I believe that the server's name was Kristian? Something of the sort.  We sat at 2 seater booth in front of the restrooms.  The floor under the table was so sticker that our shoes would completely stick to the floor to the point that they made noise while walking away.  I'm guessing that a drink was spilled and the seats were wiped but the floor wasn't cleaned... not a big deal.  Complaints are for the service.  My girlfriend sat for 10 minutes before being greeted, and 10 more to get a water.  I arrived 20 minutes after her about the time that the water arrived.  The spinach and artichoke app was fine.  It was over an hour when the entrees arrived.  Girlfriend ordered Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo and it was cold.  I ordered something new off the menu, a pulled pork slider and a chicken breast, but forgot what it was called.  The slider was hot but the chicken breast and fries were cold and slaw was hot.  The waitress asked if I wanted another beer when the entrees came out, she never brought it until I was finished my meal.  She asked about dessert and we declined and mentioned the food being cold.  She brought out the kitchen manager! We didn't complain about the taste of the food.  We told him the issues and didn't know why he was brought out.  Now here's the kicker, her meal was comped at 9.50 i think and then a second Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo was added at 12.50 and comped, but my entree was still there.  The kitchen manager did offer to remake but at that point, we couldn't.  There was another table next to us whose waiter my girlfriend knew, he seemed great.  Couple of guys sat on the other side of the wall from us, sat after us, got their food and finished before us.  And the bad thing is our waitress wasn't that busy.  She only has 2-3 tables including us.   Oh, even better, when the girlfriend arrived she asked to be seated in the bar area.  She was ignored.  A different girl brought her to the booth, and she asked again to sit in the bar, the girl made eye contact with her and sat her in that booth.... I'm not hating the food, but the service."
Kenea W.,"Baton Rouge, LA",132,1,,3.0,7/1/2014,Loved the hostesses when you first walk in very attentive. Waiter not so much. Drinks sat empty for the whole table most of the evening. Order was done wrong. Manager came out super apologetic about everything and discounted the meal. With it being my first time waiter could have done a lot better but then again maybe she had a bad night.
Bob W.,"Prairieville, LA",27,12,4,3.0,5/16/2012,Nice variety.    Decent food.   Cold beer.  Good service.   Lots I tv's if that's what u want.   I'll b back
Peter O.,"Lady Lake, FL",1,62,,2.0,9/20/2013,"Overpriced for both food and beer.  Flatbread is absolutely tasteless.  Take a pass on this place.  Wait staff and the seating hostess are bored, clueless and waiting for their shift to end."
Extreme M.,"Baton Rouge, LA",7,92,102,1.0,3/8/2013,"Yet again, I feel like I am beating my head against a brick wall.....humbley.  I gave BJ's another chance to treat me right.  I ordered take-out from them (because they are WAY too slow to eat in the restaurant).  I ordered a Pulled Pork Sandwich but when my dinner companion went to pick up the order, only THEN did they say they were out of Pulled Pork.  This was early into dinner service, like around 7:30 p.m.  There is NO WAY they should be out of Pulled Pork.  When we've eaten in the restaurant, they've been out of Pork chops.  What is their deal with being out of pork entrees???  So frustrating! So I changed my order to the chicken fried steak which I did not really want but couldn't think of anything else that suited my tastebuds.  That's why I had chosen the Pulled Pork Sandwich, it would've hit the spot.  When we got our meal home to eat, I noticed my chicken fried steak was overcooked and almost burnt.  It tasted as such as well.  The only good thing was the mashed potatoes.  The food was barely lukewarm, and it wasn't really a cold night and we don't live that far away.  It's sad BJ's is wasting away slowly but I predict this restaurant will close eventually.  Just not enough good employees to keep it running and not enough good chefs to execute the wonderful menu items, and not good enough management to make sure everyone is doing their jobs AND management who makes sure the kitchen is well stocked with food for orders.  Very poor, I predict a close.  People will keep eating here due to the good menu, but will leave disappointed because patrons are constantly being told the kitchen is out of something or other and the wait staff is SLOW as Christmas!"
