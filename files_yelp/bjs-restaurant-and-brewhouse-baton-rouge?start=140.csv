J K.,"Weatherford, TX",0,8,,1.0,3/2/2013,"Some food is average like their sandwiches and burgers, while some (e.g., sliders, fried shrimp, fish & chips, appetizers) are poor.  Service and decor is okay.   Good beers although mixed drinks are just average.  I keep returning to see if it has gotten better and I don't know why.  I have never been in another location of this chain, but I don't see how this place survives.  I cannot recommend."
Ava F.,"Luling, LA",0,45,,5.0,6/23/2012,"Excellent portion for the price. Got the spinach dip app; tons of chips; nice variance from typical dip; kids burger n bj bacon cheeseburger amazing, but daughters could have shared; mahi tacos could have served 2 and my daughter n I shared parm crusted chicken n loved it!! Server was super nice n efficient too!"
Steve M.,"Prairieville, LA",9,39,1,4.0,12/29/2010,Great beer and food. BATON ROUGE needs more places like this!
Tim S.,"Mukilteo, WA",3,13,,4.0,11/23/2010,Very nice atmosphere.  Menu is diverse enough to please just about anybody.  Great brews.
Alexis Z.,"Oscar, LA",72,13,9,5.0,6/20/2010,"Sooo good, great food nice bar. It's a good environment just nice."
Vince B.,"Baldwinsville, NY",0,3,,2.0,7/8/2012,"Waiter took my order, brought me iced tea. Another waiter brought my Caesar salad which was about average but was chilled nicely. Had the New York Strip Steak which was disappointing as it was not a very good cut of meat with lots of fat and gristle. The strip steak was also delivered by another waiter. All said, I would probably not recommend this restaurant for a good steak dinner. The steak at any Outback is significantly better."
Jason E.,"Auburn, AL",3,7,1,4.0,3/7/2010,"They have their own brand of beers that were very good.  Only down side was it was your typical chain restaraunt menu.  I enjoy one of a kind places, but the Pizookie was very good.  I will definitely go back!"
Eli W.,"Covington, LA",12,37,,2.0,1/21/2012,"I stopped in here for lunch yesterday. I never knew the place existed. Now I know why. The service was horrible from the start. Trying to give my order, the waiter kept looking around at other tables and people coming in. He was more concerned with what was going on around us than us! The menu is quite overwhelming. It had pages of food to choose from, nothing which sounded good to me. Everything either has their ""special sauce"" or avocados. I'm always skeptical of ""special sauce."" I went with a burger thinking that it can't be hard to screw it up. The menu states that all burgers are prepared medium well. Mine was flat out burnt. The bun was even burnt. The other person in my party ordered fish tacos. They sounded very good, but when they arrived the fish was fried! Who's ever heard of a fried fish taco? I wasn't at all impressed with this place and never plan on returning. On the bright side, it wasn't very expensive."
Joel E.,"Baton Rouge, LA",16,30,,4.0,3/25/2009,"This is a new place that has an insane amount of food to choose from.  Everything I have had there is good.  The service is kind of hit and miss depending on how busy they are.  So far, they have the best fish tacos I have ever had in Baton Rouge.  Definitely get the pazookie for dessert too!  They have some good beer selections too."
David T.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,4,13,5.0,10/20/2009,This is a really good place to go. Great little bar area and nice large restaurant area. The menu is extensive and there are plenty of good options to chose from. There are large screen TVs all over the restaurant with lots of options. I like the appetiser menu and their great beer selection.  Try the beer sampler!
Matthew G.,"Prairieville, LA",0,1,,1.0,12/29/2012,"My wife and I, on one of our very few nights out from our kids, decided to eat at BJ's before we went to a movie.  We walked in on a Friday night around 8:30 and sat right down.  Our server greeted us promptly and we ordered 2 beers and the lettuce wrap appetizer.  After about 5-10 minutes our appetizer arrived but our drinks didn't arrive until a few minutes later.  Without prompting our server said he had ""stuff to do"" and that is why our drinks were late.  The lettuce wraps were awful.  For almost $11 we got four pieces of lettuce that was full of holes and tears.  For that price I expect firm, whole pieces of lettuce that can actually hold the food that comes with them.  We then ordered our dinners.  My wife ordered a turkey cobb sandwich.  I tried to order a small, whole wheat deep dish pizza but the server told me that the whole wheat only came in a mini size.  So I ordered the mini Mediterranean pizza on whole wheat crust.  A runner brought our food out.  My wife's sandwich was supposed to come with applewood bacon, avocados, and a blue cheese dressing on it.  It came out without all 3 of those things.  My pizza came out on ""white"" crust instead of the whole wheat.  We explained to our server the mistake on the sandwich and I just decided to eat my pizza.  He said he would be right back.  When he returned he had a plate of sliced avocados and bacon.  He explained that the sandwich guy was new and that my wife could just fix her sandwich herself.  If we wanted to make a sandwich we could have done that at home!  I asked the hostess to send the manager to our table.  He also explained that the sandwich guy was new and that some people didn't mind putting those things on their sandwiches.  At no point were we offered a ""new"" sandwich.  To their credit after my wife explained that she didn't want to eat the sandwich they did take it off our bill.  Poor service from the bar, kitchen, wait staff, and management.  I look forward to the restaurant that takes this one's place in a few years."
