Athena D.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,10,2,4.0,3/19/2016,Really good place in the Mall of Louisiana! It's is a pub and a restaurant with a wide option of draft beers! We ordered boneless chicken wings as appetizer and it was pretty decent portion. My boyfriend ordered a steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The steak was really good but the asparagus were dried. I ordered a pasta and my plate was delicious. The service was decent.
Ambrose S.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,11,,5.0,11/9/2016,"Its not deep dish, but its as good as it gets.  Everything is great here.  Warm and fresh pizza, cold BJ's brewed beer, and the Pizzookie is out of this world.  You absolutely must try the Pizzookie."
Robert K.,"Baton Rouge, LA",1,34,4,2.0,12/15/2015,"Food is normally great, employees friendly as always Wife wanted take out, ordered penne pasta with shrimp and asparagus Meager portion of penne with few slivers of asparagus and maybe 5 shrimp for over $16 Never again. Had I been seated and received that I would have sent it back Live and learn."
Danielle E.,"Claremore, OK",0,3,,3.0,9/5/2016,"I have always loved Bj restaurants so I had to come to this location while I'm working here in LA. The main course dinner was alright. Probably wouldn't get that chicken again. Dessert was wonderful (ofcourse because it was their pazookie cookies!) But I was there for over an hour and a half because it took soooo long to get anything. Even our drinks! It was only around 4pm when we were there and there were barely anyone there yet for dinner.  Wouldn't return back to this location, not worth it."
Bridgette B.,"Baton Rouge, LA",9,25,8,1.0,6/5/2016,Thus was our go to place for date night... not any more my hubby wanted to go this weekend for our 17th anniversary so i said ok BIG MISTAKE  took a while for our waitress to come even longer for her to bring our drinks (we had water) seemed like she got upset cause we asked to see a gluten free menu we wanted to do the 2 for 25$ thing she said *i think we are still doing it* finally got to order took almost an hour to get our gluten free pizza we ordered wasn't cut all the way through we had no spatula to pick up the pizza  and by the way the restaurant was less than  half full .we got there around 6 and left at 8 we will never go back there service was lousy the pizza was awesome though i suggest take out if you wanna try this place
Kyle M.,"Fitchburg, WI",700,43,276,5.0,6/18/2015,"Joshua was the best server I've ever had! He was knowledgeable and funny. He took time to explain the menu and gave great recommendations. (No I'm not related...just impressed!) The food came out hot and fresh. I enjoyed my happy hour prices, too! I give the BJ's experience two thumbs up!"
Tara F.,"Baton Rouge, LA",142,197,603,3.0,12/5/2015,"I've been coming here several times and it has always been pretty ""hit or miss"". Sometimes the food is right on, good and everything you want. Other times it takes multiple attempts to get it right. I can say that recently it's been pretty much a hit. The food has came out timely, has been fresh, hot, and prepared exactly as requested. The last few times I've came the waiters/waitresses have been very nice and pleasant, eager to be sure we were happy and satisfied with our food. This is a nice spot to go to while in the mall area. Be sure to call ahead to get on the waiting list before you arrive!"
Ryan And Lorene S.,"Livingston, LA",0,6,46,5.0,6/1/2015,The food and drinks were great. The desserts are winderful. Our waiter Dominique was awesome. I got the sirloun and baked pitato and steamed green beans. A strawberry splash drink YUM! Everything was delish!! They get 5  from us.
Mary B.,"Baton Rouge, LA",34,132,112,3.0,4/5/2015,"We have been several times, though less in the last couple of years. We went today to celebrate our anniversary (and also Easter). Service was ok, not great. Food was very filling, although my husband ordered a roast beef/french dip sandwich and it was dry. I'm sure they were just short staffed as if was a holiday, but it was a little disappointing."
Nikhil D.,"Baton Rouge, LA",90,104,540,3.0,7/21/2014,I have gone to BJs a couple of times. It's a decent (note I won't say good) place to go to in Baton Rouge.  I think the ambience is 3/5. Good to go with friends and could barely pull off as a romantic spot.  The food is decent. It's the only place I found to have DEEP DISH PIZZAS. But then they aren't that good if you're a pizza fan!  The CHICKEN PARMESAN is a good entree and so is their JAMBALAYA.  I was really disappointed with te service though. We were waiting for water for half an hour. And the cheque took so much time to come that we were totally irritated.  Also the whiskey selection isn't that great.
Ashley J.,"Sacramento, CA",147,433,258,3.0,11/3/2014,"The food took FOREEEEEVERRRRRR. Homygawd. Ridiculous! Took 15 minutes for my uncle to get his iced tea. 15 minutes! And it wasn't at all busy. Needles to say, the food was fantastic. Cajun pasta with shrimp; fish and chips; lettuce wraps; BJ's Favorite pizza. Red wine. Delish. Also, one of the wait staff ran out after us promoting her side catering business. Totally unprofessional."
Jacki S.,"Baton Rouge, LA",51,19,4,1.0,12/18/2015,Service is absolutely horrible. I have been there 4 times and each time it gets even more horrible. The food is just as bad. I enjoyed the parmesan crusted chicken when I took a taste off my friends plate but when I ordered it for myself the next time it went it tasted like nothing but butter. I ordered spaghetti one time and it was so bland and no seasoning. The waitress's are not attentive whether they are busy or not. That place is a joke. The food sucks. I won't be going there again. And the prices are outrageous.
chris s.,"Slidell, LA",3,27,,2.0,3/21/2016,Nice atmosphere and thats about it.  The menu is extensive and the food is good for the type and class of restaurant it is. The pizza is signature and ok. The service is embarrassing.  We had food in front of us before we had silverware. The food came out at different times. The side plates they brought were dirty. Yes dirty!! They hurried you. The bill was dropped off seconds after ordering dessert which took 20 Min to receive and was wrong and had to be remade. The place was half empty so they weren't busy. No excuse.  I have eaten at BJs in L.A. And Houston.  Both were a much better experience. I would avoid.  Great to watch the game and snack but not for a real meal.
Wade H.,"Baton Rouge, LA",2,20,4,4.0,5/29/2015,"A good atmosphere fits the good food.  The staff is always nice, just like the food they serve.  Of course, it can get pretty loud during a game, but they keep it civilised.  BJ's is perfect for a meal before or after a movie."
Katherine D.,"Hampton, VA",23,3,,3.0,1/17/2015,"Let me start with it was very.very crowded.   1pm. Big football game between SF and Seattle.  The atmosphere was great.   The food was okay.  Was expecting better.  This is our 1st visit to BJ's.  Food took a long time to come out.  Had the Carnitas Fries and fried artichoke hearts to start.  Were a little cold as if they had ben sitting a while.   Fries were Excellent just wish they had been hotter.  Sweet pig pizza was good needed less sauce and more cheese.   Southern Fried Chicken... FABULOUS CHICKEN.    Sides.... not so much.  Corn did not taste like corn was overpowered by seasoning and mashed potatoes were either old or instant.  On the other hand tbe staff could not have been nicer or more helpful.  Overall our waitress,    Kaitlyn     , was wonderful.  Just attentive enough.  Even with the crowd."
Shannon T.,"Baton Rouge, LA",4,11,4,4.0,11/15/2015,"BJs has good food and GREAT DESSERTS!! My FAV is the Macadamia Nut Pazookie W Vanilla Bean Ice cream..yummmm!!! A couple of the dishes are hit-or-miss. They HAD a good Happy Hour but they have recently changed it...now its so-so!!! Overall, Great atmosphere and a huge screen to watch Sports in the bar area..also other TV's around the restaurant as well."
Tamisha A.,"Baton Rouge, LA",75,72,5,4.0,2/19/2015,"I was very impressed with BJ's. It was my first visit but won't be my last. We came during Happy Hour and decided to eat off the Happy Hour menu as well. We ordered chicken wings, the sliders and the mini deep dish pizza. Everything was delicious and we were more than satisfied with the portions. I did not have high expectations for the sliders but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of beef and other toppings. If I were to give a couple of negatives. One would be the size of the menu. It is literally like a book. I felt like a needed a table of contents. The second negative was the bartender that attended to us. He did not seem happy to be there and seemed a little impatient at times but he handled our food and drinks promptly. Overall, I will return!"
Joel M.,"Geismar, LA",120,502,1054,2.0,2/4/2013,"To start I've eaten here twice with most recent being 2/4/13...I couldn't check in tonite even though I was sitting in the middle of the restaurant...I'd call that a Yelp problem,  possibly a phone issue...not sure but I was pissed...I digress, let's get to the meat of the matter so to speak... The food here is UNDERWHELMING!!!!! 1st time ordered Chicken Fried Steak with mashed potatoes....they brought it out DRY!!! Are you jackin me?? The described it as smothered in gravy...that was a freakin joke....when I tried to get more you'd think I'd asked to see the waitress' HooHaa.... Tonite, in with the boy, ordered the open faced Pot Roast sandwich. ...description said smothered in a tasty brown gravy...NOT!! Oh the issues with this dish were numerous....For price charged...4 bite size pieces of Pot Roast on a piece of toasted garlic buttered slice of bread with a skimpy scoop of mashed potatoes...the potatoes were so damn dry and thick and gluey I think if you added water you could make a damn decent brick mortar! NO GRAVY!! Had to beg for it....OOPS, my bad....shoulda quit while I was ahead....the gravy looked like it was made from a powder packet you pick up at the grocery store and had an irony wang to it....that DID NOT compliment the garlic buttered toast the potatoes were sitting on....then on top of that the waitstaff was on us so tight it was like we couldn't breathe...but his ass disappeared once the food came out!!! The Guinness was HOT...not lukewarm, not cool, not cold...HOT like the hinges of Hell!!! The only freakin bright spot was the boy's pizza which was huge and actually cost less than that crap that I ordered!!! I tried a bite and it was good.... The interior looks cool and trendy....but between the smothering waitstaff and the crappy meals I've had here I'm done with this place....NO MORE!!!"
Gabe R.,"Chalmette, LA",89,560,156,2.0,12/31/2012,"My kids and I stopped here after spending the day at the Mall of Louisiana spending their X-mas gift cards.  The hostess informed us that is would a 15 minute wait.....her time estimating skills are not very good as it took close to 40.  The words ""15 minute wait"" must have been on a cue card for them to read to everybody. While waiting I noticed this place looked like every TGIFridays/Chili's/Applebees....except they make their own beer.   When we were finally seated, it took another 20 for out waiter to take our drink order.    Ithen had to flag him down to take out food order.  He was friendly but more interested in the young ladies at the tables next to me and 2 kids.  That I don't blame him for but the numb nuts should know men in their 30's tip better than college age girls.   We finally get our food and low and behold the appetizer and entrees all come out at the same time.  I asked the waiter what's the point in ordering an appetizer if you are just going to bring everything at the same time.  He looked confused.  Anyway the nachos were cold, the cheese was a big clump,  the rest of the food was ok at best. The service here sucks. When i say it sucks, I promise it sucks as I am pretty laid back when it comes to this stuff.  They are very unorganized.  No silverwear when the food came out, then they didn't have enough clean to give us.  I shared my daughters fork. The menu is the size of a Webster's dictionary so that may be part of the problem.  They only get a 2nd star because the 2 beers I had that they make were pretty tasty."
Teri D.,"Baton Rouge, LA",62,416,142,3.0,7/8/2015,"The service was pleasant but PAINFULLY SLOW.  My beer was also room temperature so they lost a star for that. My Parmesan crusted chicken was to die for but was served with rotted broccoli--how hard is it to LOOK at the veggies before you throw them in the steamer? Sad kitchen fail on that one, your prep cook needs to step up his game and either make sure the veggies are fresh every day and throw away the rotting ones. The chicken was another story though.  It was crispy on the outsite and the lemon sauce with the sundried tomato bits and fresh basil were a great counter point but it needed a bit of salt which was so WET in the shaker I couldn't get it out.  Here's a tip: put about a quarter of a teaspoon of raw rice in your salt shakers to keep it dry and flowing freely--how can you NOT know this??  My dining companions seemed pleased with their choices, a Tomato cream soup that looked very good, the fish tacos which were also good according to my other friend. Our server was very sweet, but hopelessly incompetent and the service was painfully slow.  A little retraining of the staff seems to be in order here."
