Greg M.,"New Orleans, LA",320,473,527,3.0,7/11/2013,"Typical semi-upscale brew house. Food is mediocre with service to match. Oh, they're friendly enough, and look like they should be able to provide excellent service, but sadly, they fail to deliver.  Mahi Mahi tacos sound good, don't they? Well, don't get your hopes up. Tortilla soup would be great a starter, but here again, the soup arrived after the entree :( I'd maybe go back for a beer and appetizer, but the odds of catching me at this BJ's for another meal, is slim.  Just another reminder why I tend to avoid chains."
Texas B.,"Midlothian, TX",1,21,,2.0,1/20/2016,"Read all the reviews, including the ones under Not Currently Recommended. A word to the wise. Ordered Asian Salad and tea for lunch. Came out fast and good, so no complaints there. Service is very spotty. My server Jill must have had 8 tables just after noon, that's hard. She was running the whole time I was there. Ran out of tea, no one else even offered to refill the glass. Been here two hours and just disappointed in the place, compared to other BJ's I eat at. Spoke with the MOD and I think that the problem lies with him. No response but too bad so sad. Total disinterest, offended that we disturbed him. What kind of training do they do here? Lots of servers on duty, where are they? Seems to be a management issue. Bad service = poor management."
Carmen R.,"Oakland, CA",1,3,,5.0,7/28/2016,"I spent the last month driving across 12 states and today I was headed back to California.  It had been a stressful day,  to say the least; and I was hangry.   I decided to go to BJ'S instead of Red Robin- a beer, food and the atmosphere would settle my nerves and then I could hit the road.  The young man at the door was great.  He sat me right away. A few minutes later he sat 2 young ladies.  I expected the server to stop by soon so I decided what i wanted to drink and eat.  I searched for hotels in Shreveport LA and booked a room; and then I noticed the two ladies had drinks and no menus.  I asked if they ordered and they said yes. I checked... 15 -17 minutes had flown by and not one of the three servers who walked by offered me a glass of water, let alone acknowledge I was there.  So I asked for the manager. Gary, a nice enough guy but, I was so angry I didn't need him to appease me.  I left fully engulfed in anger and frustration.  Then I heard some one call, I took a deep breath, and I turned.   Thank you Roger (executive chef) for taking the extra minute to calm me down and remind me that I just needed to eat- and have a beer. Thank you for talking to me, and listening. Thank you for making sure that my food came quickly and well prepared. Thank you Roger for Kien who smiled and made me feel like my experience mattered."
Ali C.,"Collinsville, IL",6,4,,2.0,8/16/2015,"The service is always awful. The only reason they got 2 stars is because the pizza is decent. You will wait forever when you walk in the door to get seated. Then wait forever for a server to approach you. Then getting your drinks takes another 15 minutes. If they remember your appetizer that's great, but they probably won't. Good luck if you eat here."
Kayleigh J.,"Baton Rouge, LA",33,4,,2.0,1/9/2016,Service is terrible. Food is average and takes forever to come out. Only good thing about the place is their pazookies. I waited 25 just to get my check then was accused of not paying.
Nicole L.,"Baton Rouge, LA",1,14,,4.0,1/4/2016,Where do I even start?? The ahi poke appetizer? The jambalaya? The Pazookie??? It's all amazing. Service can be a tiny bit slow sometimes but it's a busy large place. Also their beers and home made sodas are amazing.
Joe B.,"Baton Rouge, LA",1,20,,3.0,1/15/2016,Overall the atmosphere is nice and the staff is great.   At a business luncheon with a vendor.  I ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya and it was too salty to eat.  The dish the vendor ordered was salty also.  Although he ate his dish; I returned mine and didn't order anything else.   The waitress did report it to her manager and they removed it from our bill.   I'll try them again sometime in the future.  If the food is bad again; I'll never go back.
Samantha L.,"Atlanta, GA",70,220,352,4.0,6/3/2014,"I ordered the half lunch size order of a Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flat Bread (with mozzarella, red onions, and a drizzle of basil pieces and pesto sauce) and a side salad - all for $6.95!! And it was delicious!! Basil is my new best friend... I'd like to try the full size order of the Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flat Bread - yum!!!"
Sherline A.,"Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA",8,8,2,5.0,10/11/2014,"I had an amazing experience overall despite it being a Saturday afternoon and the restaurant being packed with a large birthday group of 20+ people. It was understandable that we had to wait 25 minutes for our entrees. We order the ribeye steak, double deluxe burger, baby back pork ribs, boneless chicken apps with a clam chowder soup. Food was very good and tasty. Our server Meagan was very nice, attentive and had a positive attitude. My friend order her steak to be medium rare but it came out completely rare so they refired her a new steak that was cook to perfection in just a short few minutes. Dessert. Hands down the pizookies are AMAZING. A must have. Cookies and creme is my favorite. While we were getting our check, our server offer us to go boxes and drinks which was very nice of her. Warning though : it can get very loud so not ideal for dates. Also very clean."
Jay C.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,37,,4.0,6/18/2016,Great salads and pizza is half off on Monday's. Be sure to join the rewards club for little extras. Triple chocolate pizzokie is to die for.
Jason C.,"Baton Rouge, LA",39,2,,1.0,11/15/2014,"I would like to start off by telling you I rarely, if ever write a review for restaurants. The only time I do it is if it is extremely good or extremely bad.  Unfortunately this post is regarding the latter. I ordered a Signature Deep Dish Pizza and what I got was a cheap imitation of a deep dish pizza that had no sauce. Well let me rephrase, I think they substitute grease for pizza sauce.  On top of that, the pizza was not true deep dish...It was only about be an inch thick and the crust was way to airy to be true deep dish...Please do not be fooled by the delicious looking pictures of real deep dish pizza on their website. You will not receive that if you order. I don't mind paying for good food, but please heed my warnings, before you order this, take your 25 dollars, crumple it up and throw it in the toilet. Then take another 25 dollars find you're other favorite pizza joint and order.  You will get the same experience (i.e. throwing away good money) without the inconvenience of going to the s*$t hole.  Honestly, this is one of the worst experience I have ever had with pizza. It is almost unbelievable that you can screw up pizza. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!!"
Fiorella C.,"Kapolei, HI",230,3,,5.0,6/28/2015,The dishes were great! Had the salmon and quinoa and it was Delilah! For my drink I had a margarita. My server was brandon and he was super funny! :)
Ashley L.,"Austin, TX",52,8,4,4.0,12/27/2013,"En route from the coast of Mississippi back to Austin. I had been to a BJ's in Austin and had enjoyed the beer.  Have since discovered I am gluten intolerant. I was shopping as procrastination for riding in the car for 8 or so hours, and to spend some Christmas cash at the Mall of Louisiana. The lines in the food court were insane, clearly understaffed and then I saw a little blue arrow in the mall that said ""restaurants"", and hobbled my way under a few too many shopping bags (oops!) to BJ's, where I'm sure I wouldn't be able to get anything more than a sad salad without croutons.  LO AND BEHOLD, gluten free thin crust pizza. And it is a good pizza, y'all.  My server also asked if I was allergic, which made me at least feel like they are aware and might take care not to cross contaminate. But seriously, best gluten free pizza I've had to date, and that actually is saying something. I also got the peach sangria which is almost inedibly sweet; but I think that's my fault. I should have known what I was getting into with the ingredients list. Might be good with a shot of bourbon to cut down on the sweetness, but I do have a 6 hour drive ahead of me, so I'll hold off."
Nicole A.,"Denham Springs, LA",16,75,205,3.0,11/16/2014,Needed to exit the mall for lunch and sanity so we walked to BJ's.  Nice atmosphere. Sat in what looks like an add on section next to the windows. Music was a little too loud.  Menu is HUGE! They can't make that many dishes and have them taste good.  Appetizer was disappointing. Only 2 good points: (1)nice waiter (2)great burger. Will only go if I'm out of other options. And get the burger!!
Sarah B.,"Covington, LA",0,1,,1.0,5/1/2016,"My friends and I have always loved going to BJ's. It has a super laid back atmosphere with a huge menu so everyone can find something they like. However, last night (Saturday, April 30th) was a much different experience than normal. When our group of six arrived at 7:30pm we were greeted with who was perhaps the rudest hostess I have ever encountered. Not only was she very snappy, but she ignored all of our attempts to get her attention after we waited fifteen minutes over our estimated wait time and all other parties who arrived AFTER us had been seated. When she finally did seat us, she all but threw our menus and silverware settings onto the small, square table better suited for four people and stormed off. There were two large, uncleaned booths right next to our table so my friend walked over to the hostess stand to ask her if one of the booths could be cleaned and we could move. The hostess told us we could move to whichever table was cleaned first. Over the next five or so minutes we watched her (seemingly deliberately) clean every other table in our vicinity except for the two that would actually fit our party. When our waitress came by, we mentioned to her that the hostess told us we could move to either of the two tables and she informed us that one of the two tables was bigger than the other. When she attempted to find someone to clean that particular table, the hostess stormed over and actually raised her voice, nearly shouting, at our group and our waitress claiming that we were LYING and she never told us we could move to the larger table. Luckily, while this was happening the other table was being cleaned so we decided rather than cause a scene and possibly get our waitress in trouble, we would move to that table even though it wasn't quite suited for the size of our group. Once we were at the new table we made sure to apologize profusely to our waitress because it was absolutely not her fault. I've never written a Yelp review before, but this hostess' seemingly unwarranted behavior towards customers and a coworker in the middle of a busy restaurant was completely unacceptable and quite jarring in my opinion. I wish I had gotten her name, but that was the last thing on my mind during the commotion. I want to be clear, the one star is not for our waitress or the food (we still love BJ's), but I do not believe the hostess' behavior should be ignored."
Caroline N.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,1,,1.0,2/28/2015,The to go here is horrible. They mess up orders and constantly leave things out. It also takes so long to get your order. I placed an order online and went to the restaurant to pick it up and still had to wait a long time for it.
Mario P.,"Katy, TX",72,164,370,3.0,3/31/2014,"First visit here and I must say I'm a little disappointed in my overall experience. Hey, don't get me wrong the beers where good, but the food left a lot to be desired. I ordered one of their fish dishes, and it tasted fresh, fresh out of the freezer that is. The veggies were over cooked and I can only eat veggies either raw or done right. These fell in between. Carrots hard and broccoli over cooked. I hope it gets better because I frequent this area and always love  a place that is solid and can be counted on in a pinch. But at least the beers were cold, that still counts for something!"
Rachel B.,"Miami, FL",4,41,22,2.0,9/5/2014,"Visited this place for the second time last week. Service was actually very good, but it was slow. We ordered the original crust which is pretty much like thin crust, it didn't seem cooked long enough and the crust was soft instead of crunchy like it was last time(which i liked). We also got the chocolate chip pizzookie which was amazing and boneless wings which were equally good. The only down fall is the hideous lamps right next to your table that has an inch of dust on it. If that's the filth left infront of my face, then the cleanliness must be lacking in other places as we'll. therefore, two stars."
Linda N.,"Baton Rouge, LA",3,28,76,3.0,11/8/2014,"This restaurant has its' good and bad days in the service department..unfortunately today was not the day. Even though we were greeted with a smile and seated promptly by the who we assumed is the manager, it was downhill after that. We were a party of 2 people but since they ran out of utensils we were only given one and was told that he will return with another. 30 minutes later, no waiter or waitress in sight so we had to flag one down to take our order. It wasn't even a full house, it seemed like they were overstaffed. After we placed our order, our drinks came but one of the cups was leaking. 20 minutes later we got our food. Surprisingly the sides were better than the entrees! Fries were crisp and delicious. Clam chowder was flavorful and hot. Our steak was burnt on one side and the angel hair pasta with scallops tasted sour and the scallops were overcooked, rubbery and bouncy. Hopefully the next time we go, we will get good service."
Justine J.,"Baton Rouge, LA",4,4,12,3.0,9/29/2014,"My boyfriend and I came here for a lunch date. The service was great. Our waiter was very attentive and funny. The food was ""okay"" it's not bad or anything, but I think it could be more appetizing. For appetizer we ordered the calamari and it was the bomb dot com. It wasn't chewy and the dipping that comes with it were great. For entree, I had the mahi over rice and my boyfriend had the grilled chicken pasta. Well, when our waiter gave our meals to us the grilled chicken was missing. I waited for a minute or two to find our waiter because he's nowhere to be found. Then he gave us the chicken. I don't know if it's just me or the food was a bit bland. I guess that's just how they season their stuff. For dessert we ordered the famous ""pizookie"" the macadamia nut one. It was sweet. Like very sweet. We just can't finish it. Overall, our visit was okay. Maybe we'll come back to check other things on their menu."
