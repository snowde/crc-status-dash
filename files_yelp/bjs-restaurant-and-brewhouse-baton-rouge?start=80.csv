Brandon P.,"Baton Rouge, LA",14,38,38,4.0,1/21/2015,"I absolutely adore this place, the food is good, I wouldn't say over the top but this place has a calming feel to it. I've tried a lot of the items in the menu and I love the pasta. The house root beer (brewed in the house. ) is delightful and I love the fact that they have a mix of tables and booths so I can choose. I'd totally recommend this place as the servers are very kind and they really smile and they form small chat from time to time versus other places where they smile for show and aren't particularly friendly. Get this place at least once, you won't regret it."
Farah G.,"Baton Rouge, LA",8,38,5,4.0,8/7/2014,"I ordered the flatbread with the chicken as my meal. The waiter suggested putting feta on it, and boy oh boy was it delicious. Our waiter, Jacob or Joshua, I'm pretty sure it was Jacob, was just SO delightful to be around. He was funny, he was very familiar with their menu, which is SO long, and he kept me at ease. I hate it when waiters make me feel like I'm an inconvenience, but Jacob was such a courteous waiter. I wish there were more people like him in the service industry."
Nate H.,"New Orleans, LA",0,1,,2.0,9/23/2014,"The food is ok, I got the lunch chicken quesadilla and my wife got a small pizza. The beer? Wonderful!!! Did two flights, four each and they were really good. My favorite is their amber. The service? Horrendous. Our waitress comes by after roughly 8 minutes of being sat and finally starts taking orders. Once she gets our stuff, she throws things down and walks away in stride, same thing for picking up dishes. She's not personable at all and runs away once you get done talking. For this reason I would recommend sitting at the bar because the bartender talks to his patrons. Really regretting not sitting up there."
Jon F.,"Baton Rouge, LA",24,9,,4.0,3/13/2015,BJs is a place where I consistently get good food regardless of what I order or what I'm in the mood for.
Sarah R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",5,63,2,3.0,8/29/2013,"Its a typical chain restaurant. Most times I dont review chains, simply because most of them will likely be the same. And the review isn't going to help them change or make the restaurant better.  Anyway- down to business.... I visited this BJ's multiple times- lunch, dinner, late night drinks. Each time was different. I've previously had a terrible experience at a BJ's in another state, so my expectations were pretty low to begin.  First time, was awesome! The waiter was knowledgeable about the menu, clear with the specials, and even recommended a few dishes. My fiance even asked to speak with the manager to tell him how great the server did!! (it takes alot to impress the fiance with the food industry!) So we returned... This time for dinner and late night drinks.. This time was mediocre. The waitress wasnt ANYTHING like the first waiter we had. She was pushy- wanted us to get food, but we wanted to sit and drink a little. She had her friends come in at the bar, and it was a large party. She wanted to take care of them which is understandable, but remember.. there are still other tables!! She completely forgot about us when her friends walked in. The table to loud, obnoxious, crowded! So we had to track her down once we were ready to order food.  After we had eaten, my fiance got SICK later that night!! He ordered some chicken dish with mashed potatoes and ate some of my pasta also!!!!  Third time, a friend invited us out and with the last experiences we thought maybe we'll get another good one. Well the waitstaff was again struggling to keep up with his tables. He didnt check up on us often and we normally had to yell at him from across the room so we can ask him questions. The fiance's burger was BURNT TO A CRISP!!! WORST Burger ever!!!!!!! It was like a crispy patty that sat too long under the heat lamps. I think I got a chicken dish and I wasnt all that impressed with it.   With this BJ's its hit or miss.... My expectations are still low. I'll probably return because it was a wide array of choices on the menu, but the service and the quality of food could DEFINITELY be better!!!!!"
Hoanganh T.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,1,,5.0,2/16/2016,My all time favorite.. Go there almost every week .. Love it! Come eat here you won't regret it!! Love love this place :)
Brian R.,"Baton Rouge, LA",22,28,1,1.0,8/10/2014,"Our night started out with us telling the hostess we had 5 people.  4 of us had arrived and they try to seat us at a little booth.  We remind her than a 5th is coming and she puts us at a small square table, smaller than the booth.  On her 3rd try she found a place big enough for 5 people. Our server was always missing and to her credit she looked swamped.  No one could get a refill.  The food was mediocre at best but 2 pizzas never came and the manager finally came over to apologize and said they were being remade.  We spent 2 hours there and we didn't have drinks or anything to add to our time.  Will NEVER go back."
Kelly H.,"Alpharetta, GA",125,208,19,3.0,12/21/2012,"You know, considering that this is a chain brewpub located right outside of the Mall of Louisiana, it's not half bad! I'll start with the beer - brewed in house.  I have found all of the ones I've tried to be quite tasty - well balanced, not overly hopped (as some ""in house"" brews tend to be).  If you are a beer drinker you defiantly want to try the sampler - generous ""tastes"" of several of the beers.  Not a beer drinker?  No worries, there is a full bar. The food - basic but solid pub fare.  Good burgers, decent fish & chips - nothing fancy but it all does go quite well with the beer! One note - the place can get *very* crowded and noisy at times - epically during an LSU or Saints game (the overall atmosphere is sports bar).   Bottom line: Solid pub food and drink.  And it's very convenient to the Mall...."
Jessica H.,"Corpus Christi, TX",6,8,2,3.0,7/20/2014,"Steve saved the day. He is ""new"" management and u can tell he is there to hopefully save the place. We have a hard time goin out to eat especially at corporate chains because we both have been in the food biz for 20+yrs. we chose BJs today because they have the gluten free crusts and in the past at other locations I was able to order a burger and they use the crust for a bun. Which for anyone GF u know it's just not the same to always have to eat a burger on a lettuce bun .. So that was always a plus but here at this location they first told us No, so I settled for a pizza, when our pizza hit the table they looked like hell.. Center loaded and my topping wasn't correct . And our draft root beers were nasty and flat..so we were very unhappy. The floor mgr Steve came and talked to us and we could tell he really cared. He went to the kitchen to make sure our order came out. They made the burger for me and hooked it up and he even sent us some soups to tide us over while we waited. Customer service was great he asked us for a second chance a he came through. I would go back again just to see how he has changed some things.  Good job Steve!"
Marielle S.,"New Orleans, LA",182,1981,4511,3.0,9/21/2012,"I wasn't overly impressed by this place.  I went here with some friends for dinner one night.  We all ordered the top shelf margarita and I originally got a chicken sandwich.  We all agreed that the margarita was weak and mostly margarita mix.  Didn't taste ""top shelf"" at all and definitely wasn't worth the money ($9). When I got my chicken sandwich, I could immediately tell that something was ""off"" about the chicken and it just didn't taste right.  Sure enough, after a few minutes my stomach felt funny.  I complained to the manager who immediately went on the defensive and said, ""Well, it can't be food poisoning, because that takes 24 hours to hit.""  Uh...wow.  Okay.  I wasn't suggesting it was food poisoning, just saying that the chicken tasted weird.  The manager was ready with the ""food poisoning"" spiel, which tells me that I wasn't the first to complain about this.  We weren't charged for the sandwich and they replaced it with a tomato soup (at my request) that was actually really good. I'd probably go back and give them another shot, but I wouldn't order a margarita or anything with chicken."
Scott E.,"Baton Rouge, LA",61,5,,2.0,7/17/2014,"I've been here twice in the last month.  Both times, the service was good but the food was mediocre.  Got the jalapeno burger earlier this week.  I've had better at Sonic for a cheaper price.  But, my waiter was very attentive and friendly.   Beer selection is good.  If one is looking for a cool and casual place to watch a game with good food, better to go to Sammy's or The Chimes."
Jess G.,"Grand Junction, TN",0,39,141,3.0,6/16/2016,"The food was AH.mazing! Me and a friend stopped in for lunch after a morning of shopping (nice location, right outside of the loop of mall madness). I started with the Crispy Portobello Strips as an appetizer and then moved on to the personal sized pizza - BJ's Favorite (no onions please!) with a side of Nutty Brewnette. Pure Heaven. Their pizza is a MUST TRY. So Good! Enough about that, the food was great blah, blah, blah. My real concern with this restaurant is the lack of wait staff. And by lack of wait staff I do not mean the amount of waiters/ waitresses on the clock because there is definitely enough of those. They are everywhere. Running around and around and around... but.. they never seem to be going anywhere. Where is my drink? Why did my friend get her appetizer 15 minutes before I got mine? Where is my silverware? You said you would be right back with my ranch. I miss you waitress, you haven't checked on us in 20 minutes! PS I still never got my drink..."
Jordan T.,"Baton Rouge, LA",8,17,4,1.0,8/5/2014,"This place has really gone downhill in terms of service, over the past few years. I recommend staying away from this place if you're looking for an enjoyable experience. I hate saying this, because the food is really good."
Whit M.,"Black Pearl, New Orleans, LA",4,13,,1.0,1/8/2013,"No.  Shit food.  Shittier service.  Infinitely shittier ""brewpub"" beer.  Very chain restaurant feel. And all the fun that comes with that."
Michael F.,"Baton Rouge, LA",1,46,,4.0,11/1/2014,"We had written this place off after our last visit.  Came back to give it a try, glad we did.  We were greeted by a friendly smile, seated promptly, and they were kind towards our child, unlike last visit.  Our waitress was very swift, getting our ordered and the food came out in a timely fashion.  I really enjoyed the pepperoni pizza dip!  You can always find the run of the mill spinach and artichoke dip for an appetizer, this was different and delicious.  My 2 year old agreed! . I also ordered a black and blue house burger.  It was cooked properly, seasoned well, and the toppings complimented the burger.  I loved the thin cut fries.  I always go for thin fries but these are really thin, crispy, and seasoned well.  My wife had a tomato bisque bread bowl and really enjoyed it.  Our child did also.  He ate some of everything!  Overall, I think they redeemed themselves from our last visit and I will try this again just to have the pizza dip and try a different entree.  Oh, I almost forgot my wife's favorite part, the peanut butter s'mores dessert.  She and my son shared it, I don't eat desserts often, but she coaxed me into trying it and I had to confiscate the dish! We ordered a pizza to take home."
Roxanne K.,"Augusta, GA",58,741,546,4.0,1/13/2011,"What? Another dark, candle lit chain resturant... with a name like BJ's its not the beer that comes to mind!  Out server Ariel was amazing and so on the spot! She was smart, funny and did her thang well, you go girl!  The happy hour pizza did not provide a happy ending for me, but my pal Dave thought it was ok.#1 complaint... too much dough! I had the pasta with some spicy red sauce and it was, ok. Just OK... my problem may have been that bangin spicy bloody mary I ordered to go with it. Dave had some kind of chic salad (he's always making me look bad and ordering the salad! He though it was tasty. Can you believe he complained about the number of choices on the menu? men... complaining about choices and ordering salads!  Its an ok place and I'd go again if I make it back to town, check it out for happy hour, the game or some consistant foods."
Lisa J.,"Seattle, WA",29,214,32,1.0,5/9/2012,"I am so, so done with you, BJ's.  My last review praised you for decent food, but every time I have gone back since (both with groups and to pick up to-go orders) I've had a bad experience.  The hosts and hostesses are all surly and rude, and if you bring in a party that requires a few tables to be put together, they will piss and moan and make you stand around for half an hour.  I'm fine waiting for a bit when coming in with a group of 8, especially if the restaurant is bustling and full, but when four out of eight of us come in at 6:30 on a Tuesday and less than 25% of your tables are filled?  Don't make us stand there for half an hour and insist that we have at least five people arrive before you seat us.  We would have happily sat down and started filling your coffers by ordering drinks and appetizers, but clearly you didn't want the extra $80 on our tab. If you absolutely have to have BJ's because you're craving their pot roast, do yourself a favor and order it to go.  If you're very very lucky someone will actually be tending the curbside phones, and you'll only have to walk in to get your food about half the time."
Shercole K.,"New Orleans, LA",291,423,734,5.0,7/29/2010,"This is one of my favorite places to eat at when I'm in Baton Rouge. Friendly staff, great atmosphere and yummy food. One of my favorite dishes there is the Salmon.   While waiting for my food, they gave out free appetizers so patrons could try their new items. Love them! Wish there was one in New Orleans"
Audrey W.,"Baton Rouge, LA",1,9,7,4.0,7/3/2014,We eat here as a family about once a month.  The service and food is consistent and very good.  I just tried the Kale and Brussel Sprout salad and finished it off with the Salted Caramel Pizzookie.  Delicious!!
Evan B.,"Seattle, WA",19,20,1,1.0,6/13/2012,"Ah, BJs. We meet again. After visiting this restaurant twice in 2009 and finding the place to be lackluster, I decided to give it another try yesterday with my girlfriend.  I beat my girlfriend to the restaurant, so I take a seat at the bar while I waited for her. I ask what the happy hour specials are- they weren't especially impressive. I decided not to order a ridiculously priced $6.00 pint of beer and had water instead.  My girlfriend arrives, we are seated. Our server, Veronica, meekly greets us. She was timid and made us both a bit uncomfortable. After she fetched our water my girlfriend asked what a gin and tonic would cost. ""Umm, I'm not really sure, let me go check"" she replied.. A few minutes later she came back with an estimate. We order the cocktail and begin looking over the menus. What colossal menus BJs has! There are pages and pages of different appetizers, entrees, sandwiches, steaks, seafood, etc. Veronica checks to see if we've made a decision on what to eat. I ask a question about the pizza special for the day and, again, she must go off and find out from someone else. She comes back with a pseudo-answer that doesn't much help me, and not wanting to risk pressing her on the question and making her walk across the place again for clarification, I drop it.  I order the 8 ounce house sirloin, my girlfriend gets the lettuce wrap appetizer with cheese and broccoli soup. The broccoli in her soup was mushy and the soup was disappointing. My salad was good enough.  Our entrees come. My steak is cooked as I asked and is about as good as one can expect a sirloin to be. The baked potato is large and came with everything you'd expect. It was good. The lettuce wraps were also quite good.  I remembered from my previous BJs experiences that the ""pizookie"" was the saving grace of the restaurant. It is a hot chocolate chip cookie served with two scoops of vanilla ice cream that really is just fantastic. I was really looking forward to ordering this. As I'm finishing up my meal Veronica asks if we'd like dessert. I wasn't done with my potato, so I said for now I'd just like more butter and sour cream. She obliges. Once I've finished my potato she brings the checks without asking if we want dessert. Realizing its taken an act of congress for us to get Veronica to do anything efficiently, I decide to not ask for dessert. Veronica picks up our bills a few minutes after dropping them off to us, but we hadn't paid yet. She nervously brought them back to us and apologized. We paid and were on our way, disappointed with the experience as a whole.  BJ's is an overpriced restaurant with too large of a menu. No wonder poor Veronica had no idea what was going on- that menu would take a great deal of time and effort to fully understand. For the product and service we received, I would much rather have gone somewhere else. The food was...pretty good. The service was poor. The prices are high- for what they charge the food (and service) should be excellent. But hey, if you have the money to blow and don't mind sub-standard restaurants, stop on by! If you appreciate value and good service, go somewhere- anywhere- else."
